Various musculature and tissue inside SCP-5527, when applied to a living creature, would be rendered nonfunctional or otherwise superfluous in an aquatic environment.\n\nAside from a thick layer of fat surrounding its innards and the size of such, SCP-5527's anatomy— including skeletal structure, musculature, and the locations of internal organs— is identical to that of a human. Carbon dating techniques have revealed that SCP-5527 is approximately 30,000 years old. Despite this, SCP-5527 has not been observed to deteriorate beyond its present state. Traces of decayed ink have been observed on SCP-5527's left iliac artery.\n\nMaterial derived from SCP-5527 will, upon consumption, allow for the ability to breathe in aquatic environments. This effect has been observed to last for up to 12 hours, and is otherwise poorly understood.\n\nAll DNA strands taken from SCP-5527 have been degraded beyond the point of analysis. \n\n**Addendum.5527.1:** Discovery\n\nSCP-5527 was found on 2021/01/01 when it washed ashore on Bintan Island, Indonesia, in front of a private estate belonging to Overseer Council member O5-12, who had been residing there at the time.\n\nUpon request, SCP-5527 was transferred to Site-02[[footnote]]An unlisted facility staffed exclusively by high-ranking Foundation personnel, used to store and research anomalies of the highest sensitivity to Foundation security.[[/footnote]] for research purposes.\n\n**Addendum.5527.2:** Testing Log\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Collected Information\" hide=\"- WE SWAM IN A SEA WE KNEW TO BE EMPTY\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n----\n**Test #:** 01\n\n**Subject:** One //Peromyscus leucopus// (white mouse)\n\n**Notes:** Subject was prompted to consume a piece of SCP-5527's brain matter. Following consumption, it was placed in a small cage before being lowered into a tank of water.\n----\n**Results:** Subject remained underwater for 4 hours before expiring. Signs of distress were observed throughout the process.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n----\n**Test #:** 07\n\n**Subject:** Researcher Avalon\n\n**Notes:** Subject was instructed to consume a piece of SCP-5527's pectoral tissue. Following consumption, subject was placed in a cage fitted with a safety system, and submerged in a body of water.\n----\n**Results:** Subject remained underwater for one hour before signalling for the cage to be raised. Aside from initial difficulties adjusting to breathing in both environments, no signs of distress or discomfort were observed.\n\nResearcher Avalon was promptly interviewed and asked to describe her experience. An excerpt of her writing can be found below.\n\n> //You lose all sense of who you are and where you are. When I was told I only lasted an hour, I didn't know how to respond. It felt like weeks. Like I fell asleep and dreamed for a month straight. At the same time, it wasn't dreaming. I was cognizant of what was happening, and I could reflect on things as clearly as I could see them in front of me. I relived my life a hundred times. Every regret, moment of bliss, and even the perspectives of those around me. I fixated on the parts of myself I don't like to think about. The whole time, there was a stinging feeling in the back of my neck that told me I was doing something wrong, or that I'm still doing something wrong.//\n\nFollowing the interview, Researcher Avalon requested amnesticization, which was denied in order to further observe the effects of consuming SCP-5527.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n----\n**Test #:** 010\n\n**Subject:** One copy of children's book //The Cat in the Hat//, written by Dr. Seuss\n\n**Notes:** Subject was chosen due to a lack of water present in the narrative. Subject was forced to consume a piece of SCP-5527's tailbone through an anomalous process involving SCP-████ and was then submerged for a half hour.\n----\n**Results:** Upon review, the central narrative of this copy of //The Cat in the Hat// had changed entirely. A summary can be found below.\n\n> //The story begins in a house of 12 unnamed, nondescript children, who express boredom with their current situation. A loud noise is heard from the basement, and the character of the Cat in the Hat emerges from the cellar door. He promises to show the children ways to occupy themselves, but the children's pet fish objects. The Cat laughs, and removes the fish from its bowl. He replaces the bowl's water with a liquid he pours from underneath his hat. Upon reintroducing the fish to the bowl, it drowns. The children, now ecstatic without the presence of the sole supervising force in their lives, begin to vandalize the house, breaking objects and drawing on walls, among other destructive activities. The Cat offers to retrieve two beings, referred to as the \"Things\", from the basement to assist with the destruction. The children become immediately frightened— some to the point of tears—  and beg the Cat to \"leave [the Things] where they belong\".//\n> \n> //As the Cat continues to threaten the children with going into the basement, an obscured figure is seen approaching the house from outside the window. The children realize the mess they've made, and panic. The Cat takes pleasure in their distress, and retreats into the basement. The obscured figure opens the front door, and the children begin to run. The book ends with a question posed to the reader; \"What would you do if you could know the truth?\"//\n\nFurther testing regarding SCP-5527 has been prohibited at the request of the O5 Council.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.5527.3:** Incident-5527\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Collected Information\" hide=\"- WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE CAREFUL\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#D7D7C7 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\nIncident Log\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Date:** 2021/01/12\n----\nAt 00:25, Overseer Council member O5-12 accessed SCP-5527's containment locker and proceeded to consume a large amount of its innards, including the entirety of its brain, heart, eyes, and skeleton.\n\nFollowing this, O5-12 proceeded to her residence on Bintar Island, where SCP-5527 had been discovered. Surveillance cameras reveal that O5-12 entered the nearby body of water and swam out to an indeterminate length, where it is assumed she submerged herself to the point of drowning.\n\nAfter a search effort, O5-12's corpse was recovered on 2021/01/24. It was found embedded in the seabed, partially buried under sand. Various lacerations and markings were observed on the cadaver, as well as its clothing.\n\nA search of O5-12's residence recovered the following document, hastily composed on a napkin following her consumption of SCP-5527.\n\n>  **Wow!** //We should be ashamed of ourselves.
