Jewish stuff, linguistics, music, etc. Autistic and proud. My greatest claim to fame outside of the wiki is that one time I translated Smash Mouth's \"All Star\" into Aramaic and then everyone shared it without crediting me. I have no idea how IRC works and am terrified of the entire format, so if you need to contact me for whatever reason please private message. Currently working towards a masters' in Jewish education. Regular reader on the wiki, incredibly infrequent poster. \n[[/tab]]\n[[tab WHAT I'VE SCIPPED]]\n**[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3735 SCP-3735 — ForbiddeN SouNd]**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Notes\" hide=\"- Not my notes from introductory phonology though, those are long gone\"]]\nMy first article that remains on the wiki, and also my first work for the wiki that isn't total shit. Currently hovering at about +42, which is fine, totally, I don't mind, not like I want to make a cool +50 comment or anything, hahaha. I was a linguistics major in college, and you can tell. In case you're wondering, pharyngeal nasals are impossible for the human body to pronounce. Pharyngeals are defined by the root of the tongue touching the pharynx wall, and that would completely block the airflow from flowing through the nose. The last line was meant to be an opening salvo to a tale about members of MTF Mu-143 having to go to the Amazon Basin to deal with this tribe, then hijinks ensuing of the body horror variety. I haven't written it yet, mostly because I haven't thought of a good plot. If you want to add to it, let me know. [[/collapsible]]\n \n**[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5613 SCP-5613 — Valley of the Flamewars]**\n \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Notes\" hide=\"- Who wants more notes? This guy! By which I mean you\"]]\nIn case it isn't painfully obvious, I'm Jewish. As of writing this I'm in a graduate school program studying to teach at a Jewish day school, and hopefully one day continue onto rabbinical school. Anyway, if any one thing defines Judaism, it's arguing, and if any one place defines arguing, it's the Wadi Sorek. I had a lot of trouble thinking of a good ending for this one, but I'm pretty happy with what I ended up with.\nSome other notes about this one in no particular order\n* World-weary Director Aharon Leib and snarky Junior Researcher Shai Harkabi are the only two OCs I've developed so far. If you'd like to use them for any Israel-themed content, feel free, but I'd appreciate it if you ask me first. \n* The black boxes in Post-Containment Incident B was originally going to be covering \"kidnapping of three teenagers\" in reference to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_kidnapping_and_murder_of_Israeli_teenagers this real story], but I decided not to include the hidden text gimmick as with the Shimshon story for what I hope are obvious reasons re: the ethical implications of using real modern tragedies as SCP fodder. \n* Yes, the number is relevant. Per ancient tradition, there are 613 mitzvot which Jews are required to perform. The number 613 is a bit of an in-joke in Jewish circles, similar to 420 among weed people or 2137 among Polish atheists. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab COLABS ON WHICH I'VE POSTED]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/new-technical-issues This classic colab]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ My addition\" hide=\"- A further extension of Dr. Leib's story\"]]\n> **Note:** __03/08/2021__\n> //Intern Beauvillier היקר,//\n> \n> //We got the new monitors you sent over... you know we use Type H plugs here, right? Please send some adapters or something.//\n> \n> //Also please help us set up RTL text! Every time my researchers try to take down notes it screws up the format. We're local boys, we're NOT going to switch over to English. I don't want another repetition of the \"cock machine\" incident.//\n> \n> //— תודה, [[[SCP-5613|Director אהרן לייב, Containment Site-5613]]]//\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ An explanation of the joke\" hide=\"- which went over the respondent's head tbh\"]]\nSo, Hebrew is written in an abjad, which means that vowels are not generally marked. This means that the words \"Coke\" and \"cock\" are written the same way, which has led to some very funny content over the years. For an example of this exact issue, see [https://i.redd.it/jku1ue1e9wc71.png this image]. \n[[/collapsible]]\n> \n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-044-j The extended log]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ My addition\" hide=\"- I went through a really big Joseph Ducreaux archaic rap meme phase, which is why I liked this one\"]]\n> **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-100 SCP-1000]:** “Indubitably do we consider all of your iniquities as moot.
