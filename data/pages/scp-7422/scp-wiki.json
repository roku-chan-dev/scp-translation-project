There is no available connection for an external power source, and no detectable internal battery. Current hypothesis is that it is powered by absorbing energy from organic matter in its surroundings.\n\nThe attached visual display switches between 3 headers on a 10 second timer, reading \"EAST\", \"WEST\" and \"CENTRAL\", with no accompanying text underneath. The counter in the top right corner indicates the existence of 10 available headers in total.\n\nSCP-7422 came into Foundation possession as part of a collection of anomalous technological artifacts seized after a tip from the AIVD.[[footnote]]Dutch General Intelligence and Security Service[[/footnote]]\n\nOn 2023-11-10, the device activated unexpectedly during analysis of its components. An electrical shockwave transmitted from the device disconnected most of Site-312’s integrated systems, resulting in a site-wide blackout. The investigator and only attendant, Site-312 Head of Technical Infrastructure Mx. Harrit Swanepoel, was the sole casualty.\n\nThe body of Mx. Swanepoel was disintegrated completely upon activation of SCP-7422. Their ashes were returned to their family after thorough analysis showed no anomalous properties.\n\nDocumentation for SCP-7422 was uploaded via the SwanTran tool to lead researcher Gijs van Oosterbeek's review queue, and has been included unaltered.\n\nSCP-7422 has not activated since.\n\n##5BCEFA|{{SwanTran Tool: Update, additional data found.}}##\nOn 2024-04-22, a 4th header and additional text appeared on the visual display of SCP-7422.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=+ Header: URGENT|hide=–1s and 0s.]]\n01001001\n00100000\n01100001\n01101101\n00100000\n01100001\n01101100\n01101001\n01110110\n01100101\n00001010\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[module css]]\n.footnotes-footer {\ndisplay:none;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** BBC Micro Ceefax (4752596631)-edit.jpg \n> **Name:** BBC Micro Ceefax (4752596631).jpg\n> **Author:** Steve Elliott from UK\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Generic\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:BBC_Micro_Ceefax_(4752596631).jpg\n> **Additional Notes:** The text on the TV screen has been slightly altered and mostly removed by [[*user Flypurgatorio]].\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7421]]] | SCP-7422 | [[[SCP-7423]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
