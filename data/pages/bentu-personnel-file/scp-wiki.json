Here's some things I have written in the past:\n\nLinville Arc\n\n> [[[SCP-3025]]]: Lucidity (The Feather)\n> [[[SCP-3058]]]: Concavity (The Mirror)\n> [[[SCP-3066]]]: Absurdity (The Cabin)\n> [[[SCP-3076]]]: Avidity (The Raven)\n\n\n[[[SCP-3098]]]: Triviality (The Antenna)\n[[[SCP-3148]]]: Tranquility (The End)\n\nSome personal facts: \nI'm studying to be an Aerospace Engineer, and I'm loving it so far. I love hiking in the mountains and biking. Outside of writing, I also enjoy drawing. My favorite band is The Naked and Famous, with Logic as a close second. My favorite book is Ender's Game, and pretty much always has been. An unexpected truth: even though I've been a part of this site for a month or two, and have written 6 successful scips, I still feel new here. Bentu, AKA The Forever Novice. I like it.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=G0023819.JPG|\n    caption=A picture that Bentu is very proud of.\n]]",
