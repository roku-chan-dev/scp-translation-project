I wrote it blackout drunk in 45 minutes while on the toilet, got great crit from [[*user A Random Day]] and [[*user PsychicProgrammer]] and woke up to 40 upvotes, seventeen missed phone calls, and one new hobby.

End of Death remains one of my favorite canons, and the tale [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/there-s-a-hole-in-the-bottom-of-the-wishing-well There's a Hole in the Bottom of the Wishing Well] remains one of the best works I've read on the wiki so far.

There is a statistically significant amount of turbulence.//\n\nBorne out of the tripartite desires to make the Chaos Insurgency actually cool, to dissect the realistic shortcomings of teleporting power-armored shock trooper tactics (and also to write something longer than five paragraphs at a time), forged from smoke and flame and fourteen Speed Demon rereads, i brought unto the Wiki that greatest of banes.\n\nLong form fiction. \n\nFortunately, everyone who actually read the damned thing seemed to like it. \n\n-------\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/FALLOUT FALLOUT]** (+50)\n\n//“Mister President, fifteen minutes ago, the Foundation detonated a nuclear device on American soil.”//\n\nThe second step in RED QUEEN'S RACE. An attempt to portray a realistic grand strategy style checkmate set in a very unrealistic universe.
