[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hong-shing-hub|Hong Shing]]] Ocean Park, under the direct jurisdiction of Site-CN-71. Sector-1921 does not have any doors, instead only using visual misdirection and antimemetics to prevent visitors from triggering anomalous properties by accident and conceal the confidential parts of the site. SCP-CN-1921 is located in an open seawater pool in the sector, into which meat is deposited by machine for consumption once a day.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scpsandboxcn.wdfiles.com/local--files/mscarlet/seal.jpg\n|caption= SCP-CN-1921, sleeping on an iceberg in the pool of Sector-1921.]]\n\nStaff on site are prohibited to enter the pool without permission. Permitted personnel should avoid bringing any sealed containers or items, and avoid direct physical and visual contact with the object as much as possible. After leaving the pool area, they must be quarantined to eliminate anomalous contact for a period ranging from one hour to fourteen days, depending on duration of contact with the object.\n\nRemoving SCP-CN-1921 from the pool is prohibited. If SCP-CN-1921 crawls out of the pool on its own[[footnote]] Owing to the design of Sector-1921, SCP-CN-1921 leaving the pool on its own is considered a possible, though highly unlikely event. [[/footnote]], personnel should be dispatched immediately to return it to the pool and comfort it. Any request to transfer SCP-CN-1921 must be approved by the entire O5-CN Council and at least one member of the O5 Council.\n\nIf SCP-CN-1921 leaves Sector-1921 without permission, the incident should be reported immediately to Site-CN-71's Site Director or Zhujihui liaison personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-1921 is a juvenile male harp seal (//Pagophilus groenlandicus//). Its appearance has not shown any developmental changes since it entered containment. SCP-CN-1921 does not need to rely on food to survive, although it will still attempt to forage for food. SCP-CN-1921 has a protective antimemetic property, which causes any organism that develops aggressive thoughts towards it to subconsciously ignore its existence. Otherwise, its habits are no different from an adult harp seal.\n\nThe anomalous properties of SCP-CN-1921 are related to the distance between it and the subject that triggers its properties: when the distance between SCP-CN-1921 and the subject is increased, the enclosed items or containers carried or contacted by the subject will gradually become loose, and their strength will be reduced accordingly, allowing the subject to easily open or break the item or container; likewise, when the distance between the SCP-CN-1921 and the subject is shortened, the items or containers carried or contacted by the subject will be tightened, and their strength will increase, making it more difficult to open or break them.\n\nSCP-CN-1921 will establish a connection with the subject by direct physical or visual contact to trigger its anomalous properties; the duration of this connection is proportional to the duration of contact between the subject and SCP-CN-1921.\n\nSCP-CN-1921 was discovered on Bird Island in Qinghai Lake, Qinghai Province. An urban legend about the \"white-haired seal\" that appeared on Bird Island attracted the attention of Foundation webcrawlers. After sending a team to conduct an on-site investigation, its antimemetic properties attracted the attention of the expedition team, who brought it to nearby sites to conduct research, discovering its abnormal properties towards closed containers and objects in the process. SCP-CN-1921 was subsequently contained at Site-CN-21, and sent to Hong Shing in 2012, as a collaborative research project, part of Foundation-Zhujihui goodwill exchange activities.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ CN-1921/4 Clearance Required\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= cn-1921\n|clearance= 4\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= thaumiel\n|secondary-icon=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/thaumiel-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n\n**Addendum 1:** After experimentation and several related accidents, it has been confirmed that the abnormal characteristics of SCP-CN-1921 can affect the concept of sealing. If SCP-CN-1921 can contact the concept's carrier for an extended period of time, it will strengthen the related concepts, making them hard to destroy. The Object Class has been updated to Thaumiel; the object has been filed as part of a proposal to strengthen containment procedures.\n\n**Addendum 2:** A filled Sky Wall hole in [[[SCP-CN-1997]]]-1 showed signs of instability two days after routine reinforcement in April 2012. The preparatory capacity required to carry out reinforcement again in a short period of time exceeded the capacity of the Sky Wall Maintenance Committee. Following approval by O5-9, SCP-CN-1921 was moved to the restoration ceremony site for reinforcement, which was explained to internal staff as part of Foundation-Zhujihui goodwill exchange activities. When SCP-CN-1921 was placed at the venue, the spatial instability of the repaired section quickly stopped, and EVE fluctuations returned to a stable level.\n\nSector-1921 was subsequently established around the ceremony site for SCP-CN-1921 to live in until the Sky Wall hole was completely repaired. Due to the location, it was explained to the public as \"the new exhibition hall of the reconstructed Hong Shing Ocean Park\" to cover up SCP-CN-1921's presence.\n\n**Addendum 3:**\n> This little pup is very impressive -- not because it blew up a canned surstrÃ¶mming that my men brought in, but its suppression ability. The moment it climbed on the mountain of thaumaturgic alloys and divine energy ores, the undulated twisting Sky Wall calmed down immediately, and all the cracks from which energy was leaking closed up.\n> \n> It is a living Ruyi Bang, a crawling seal, not just as in the animal, but as in \"to seal away\", suppressing all unrest wherever it goes.\n> \n> But its might makes me worry about one thing:\n> \n> The seals that it is reinforcing will loosen when it is moved away. How about where it was found? Is there something suppressed in Qinghai Lake?\n> \n> [[[scp-4290|Have we loosened some shackles without even realizing it?]]]\n> \n> //Malekith Phoenix//\n> //Director, Sector-1921//\n[[/collapsible]]",
