Remix-Con 2023 is here! Remix-Con aims to inspire writers to take existing SCPs classic or otherwise and put their own spin on them! Whether an old article misses the mark, or an author wants to pay homage to the original, Remix-Con is the perfect time to find some new takes on old favorites. Remix-Con voting ends the 11th of September. You can check out the announcement and all entries [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/remixcon2023|here!]]]\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By DianaBerry//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[=image http://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/concurso-scp-es-300/CADENAS.png]]\nWe may have started Remixcon this month, but we aren't the only branch that's having a contest: [*http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/concurso-scp-es-300 SCP-ES-300 Contest] has begun! Similar to the English Branch's k-cons, the Spanish Branch of the SCP wiki is holding a contest to determine which article will claim the esteemed ES-300 slot. \n\nThe theme of this contest is one that many SCP fans know well: //monsters//. From swarms of tiny creepy crawlies to large hulking forms the human mind can barely comprehend, there are many ways to interpret this theme. It doesn't even need to be horror as long as there is a monster present in the story. The posting period begins on September 28th; stop by to check it out!\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be three user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. (One prompt per person)\nThis month's writing prompts are below! As this is the first edition of Site News writing prompts, all of the prompts were submitted by staff, but we are hoping to get user-submitted prompts next month.\n\n[[size x-large]]A new GOI enters the stage[[/size]] //Submitted by ParallelPotatoes//\nThere's many groups of interest on the site. Why not try writing something with a new one?\n\n[[size x-large]]Secure, Contain, Draw![[/size]] //Submitted by ParallelPotatoes//\nIn the fictional wild west, duels were in a style called \"fast draw\", where each participant would try to draw their gun as fast as possible. What would this look like in the SCP setting? Alternatively, this could be a tale about drawings and artwork in SCP! It's up to you!\n\n[[size x-large]]A tale about SCPs 6600 through 6699[[/size]] //Submitted by EstrellaYoshte//\nDid you know that 6600 through 6699 is the only pre-7k block of SCPs that don't have any associated tales?
