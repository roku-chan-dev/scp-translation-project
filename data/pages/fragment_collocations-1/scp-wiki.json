If you haven't heard of us, then congratulations are in order, as it means you and the employees under your purview have not been found to have violated the specific infosec/privacy protocols our automated systems assess and flag, and/or that you have passed any manual audits resulting from said flags. Due to the technological tools and infrastructure at our disposal, our department has been conscripted to assist with the investigation of Potentially Anomalous Phenomenon 2309-2514 (informally, -2514). Accordingly, receiving a notification that DIF has flagged files under your purview may not be a cause for concern; look for \"2514\" in the REFERENCE field.\n\nOne or more sections of this text file have been reviewed by DIF in response to automated and/or manual flags. Unflagged portions have been ignored unless the redactor saw fit to extend the scope of a flag. To ensure the integrity of DIF redactor notes, they have been recorded in audio format (see attached) and locked with standard level security (3/Secret). That file should be considered the authoritative DIF record when experienced acoustically (transcripts and TTS are unreliable). To facilitate efficient review, and make it easier for a reviewer to match audio commentary with the text the comment is about, a (partial) written record has been added to this file (as tags); however, any written record should be considered incomplete and unreliable. All redactions and expungements, both proposed and enacted, have been comprehensively documented in the audio file.\n\nFormally, it is not our purview to assess qualities of the documentation unrelated to -2514 (or information security and privacy, as per usual). Informally, I have asked our reviewers to adopt a \"if you see something, say something\" approach. My reasoning is simple: -2514 is a subject of current research, and when investigating a PAP, more information is better than less. In many cases, reviewers will simply \"flag & tag\" proper nouns, because -2514-associated phenomena is thought to affect them in particular.\n\nIf you disagree with a redactor's assessment in a matter of consequence, you may request a review from a supervisor redactor. (Some files may trigger flags at different times. Previously reviewed files are automatically assigned to a supervisory redactor, in case the previous redactor in fact triggered the flagging.) We ask that you do not request review of inconsequential flags that did not result in expungement, revision, or punitive consequences.\n\nTags generated by other services prior to our review will be automatically reformatted to ALL CAPS in this file for ease of distinction. Consult a previous iteration of the document if this reformatting results in ambiguity or cause for concern.\n\n—Sierra Cunix\nAssistant Director, DIF\n--]\n\n[[# I]]\n[[div class=\"scenenumber\"]]\nI\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modernday\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"dateheader\"]]\n[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-55|Site 55 • H Wing]]]\nLaboratory RA302 (formerly Laboratory HC328)[!-- Recalcitrant Anomalies getting their own dedicated labs instead of sharing labs with miscellaneous other departments was a new-ish development in 2011 --]\nSeptember 22, 2011 • Friday\n[[/div]]\n\nBefore the smoke can clear, before the gong can fade to silence, a fox-fur-gloved hand reaches forward, firmly grasps the leftmost of the wardrobe's twin doors, and tugs — twice — to no avail.\n\n\"Mm. Well,\" says Andrews, marking on a clipboard, \"It was worth a try.\"\n\nThere was a time when Cecilia would have nodded in agreement. There was a time when she would have at least put on a thin and tolerant smile. There was a time, even, when she would have offered Andrews an annoyed sideways glare, followed by a sigh tacitly acknowledging that her frustration was not with him. But those times have all come and gone: this latest failure was the seventy-fourth experiment they've run on SCP-9291-A this week, at least the two hundredth this month, and roughly the thousandth buoyant \"it was worth a try\" that Cecilia has had to endure on this assignment; the finer points of her personality have been ground coarse and then smooth, eroded by relentless tedium; her face does nothing, her grip loosens, her arm falls back, her eyes track her arm as it falls back … hmm … not lifelessly, //per se//, but not with natural ease … more of a hydraulics-tempered motion … robotically, she decides, without much satisfaction. How did people describe robotic behavior back before robots were a thing? Mechanically, maybe? Nah, still too neoteric, too narrowly technical. She could always check with Oscar...\n\nHardly relevant, in any case, to this godforsaken impenetrable edifice of stately antique furniture, steadfastly refusing to manifest its anomalous properties, like a grinning older brother withholding his latest yo-yo trick because he's enjoying the poke-and-prod attention from those who actually want to see it.[[footnote]]But only once. Nobody cares about seeing your double on trapeze for the second time. They go back to being adults.[[/footnote]] Of course, that's generally how researching these \"recalcitrant\" anomalous objects goes: nearly ninety-nine percent of the time spent standing idle while wishing that something, anything, would happen, followed by one percent spent diving for cover while wishing it hadn't.[[footnote]]The most apt kids' game analogy is probably Red Light, Green Light (led by a Red Light enthusiast), but what comes to mind for Cecilia is a variant of Duck, Duck, Goose.[[/footnote]] (And maybe, in the in-between, that tantalizing slimmest rounding-error of probability, triumph //without// tragedy — )\n\n[[div class=\"disconnection\"]]\n — Suddenly acutely and paralytically aware that time has been passing in what people less prone to wandering thoughts tend to call \"uncomfortable silence\" — with only the hiss of the outgassing fog machine for comfort — and that's not much comfort — Cecilia begins to hum a soft monotone to herself, a habit she has tried diligently to avoid indulging while at work —\n[[/div]]\n\nAndrews, either a born natural at consummate professionalism or still young enough to have the energy to feign it, is exactly as oblivious to her unresponsiveness as polite decency requires. He checks his wristwatch.[[footnote]]A recently-inherited treasure, currently worn on the distal side and lacquered on the back with acrylic nail polish, because it was giving him a rash. The nail polish was Cecilia's idea; Andrews had tried covering it in contact paper.[[/footnote]] \"It's quarter to. We might have time for one more reset if we use the same fogger base?\"\n\nBy the time he finishes asking the question, Cecilia has lifted the mask off her head and started to peel off one of the gloves, sticky with perspiration. \"Eh, let's not. Stopping now gives us time to clean up and file for the week and cruise out of here right at five.\"\n\n\"Look at you, boss lady, aiming for a timely clock-ouout.\" The last word is a muffed, distended mess, interrupted by the pops of Andrews's back cracking as he shelves the clipboard, folders the checklist, kills the Bunsen[!-- Robert Bunsen --] burner (which really should have been done //before// the test), pulls the fuel tubing, and leans on the peninsula, wincing for a little longer than ordinary fatigue would explain away. Cecilia feels her brows furrow. He's too young for degenerative lumbar problems, isn't he?[[footnote]]Twenties, thirties? Hmm … he's been Foundation eight years, has a pre-med bachelor's, a likely fiver, nobody gets out in four anymore, plus I bet his younger self was a backpacking gap-year kind of guy, so … 18+6+8, thirty-two? Give or take. She could double-check his doss on SCiPNet, but jeez. When did she lose the ability to discern someone's age? Do they all just look like kids now? Oh god, they do, don't they. Like kids. Like someone else's kids.[[/footnote]]\n\nHe rallies impressively, exhales with a forced smile. \"I mean hey, that works for me, Mom's flying in for the wake and I could use more time to tidy up and maybe see to fixing the strut on the trundle.\" As Cecilia makes a mental note to look up what a trundle is and whether it's something specific to Scottish-American funeral practices (and also: //are// there Scottish-American funeral practices?), Andrews waggles his eyebrows. \"How 'bout you, boss? Big weekend plans?\"\n\nCecilia could suppress the wild goofy can't-keep-a-secret grin that springs to her face, but chooses not to — she almost, almost, almost replies \"probably diving down a Wikipedia rabbit hole about trundles;\" it's achingly tempting; but she thinks better of it — \"Oh, you know me. Always.\"\n\nHe doesn't actually know her //that// well, of course — she's not much of a \"chat about life outside work during work\" person — but hey, let the man wonder.

A retrocausal phenomenon could be causing additional entries to appear here.

Another potential avenue of research would evaluate whether this final line in fact unintentionally invoked or obliquely described some sort of anomaly (unlikely, but, \"can't unsee\" is an autoflagged phrase, and \"bad boys\" does not show up elsewhere in any of Cecilia's audio logs or diary entries). The possibility that Cecilia was, in her written diaries, consciously or subconsciously, attempting to evade or overcome antimemetic or infohazardous phenomena with oblique lateral communication is slim, but cannot be dismissed conclusively as of yet; cf. the purported \"many purposes\" of the diary with a requisite need to be \"seen\" by others. Cecilia received training in lateral communication techniques prior to 2011.

January 25, 1993; observe that, even though Watterson has a legally valid and thus presumably metaphysically binding copyright claim over the content from which this phrase allegedly originates, it is nonetheless possible for current documentation to preserve the phrase, which suggests that the word did not originate with him; likewise, while it is not currently technologically feasible to generate novel instances of verbing, evidence makes it clear that this was a common practice in 2011 and earlier times). Research into contemporary media has uncovered multiple uncommon historical uses of \"check\" as verb, both literally as a substitute for \"mark\" in sound-effects files of various chess-category games, and allusively as a warning (cf. flags for \"you better check before you wreck\"). Perhaps Cecilia is using \"check\" in this manner, but without intending the threatening connotation it presumably carried in contemporary media.

That latter interpretation would be inconsistent with other available evidence; if Cecilia does harbor feelings of that nature, they are not explicitly found expressed anywhere (else) in her diaries or audio logs.

Public domain. This initialism has made appearances in a wide variety of contemporary merchandise, but no copyright claim has been established (or if it has, the results must have either been subsequently expunged or retrocausally removed). Sudden proliferation and equally sudden disappearance of the initialism in zeitgeist could reflect anomalous influences, or could have resulted from non-anomalous vendor copycat practices and typical usage trajectories for slang (ETBETR quickly acquired a \"Live, Laugh, Love\" style reputation as mockworthy, cringe, lame, etc. but does not appear to have acquired a comparable enduring fanbase). While merchandise with this initialism is no longer widely available for purchase, procured items have not disappeared or had their text altered. There is little to no use of ETBETR as a parting acknowledgement observed in current verbal exchanges for which we have recording data. Current online search engines return offers to unscramble BETTER rather than initialism definitions, with little to no evidence of its 2011 use; this could be non-anomalous, as search engines from 2012 to present have engaged in a modernization process commonly known as enshittification, which (in addition to other initiatives) deprecates older content and displaces it from search results. Available audio logs from the time period do reflect the commonplace spoken use of the phrase, indicating that whatever phenomena may be at work here (if any) does not alter audio files. Likewise, physically generated manifestations (such as those in Cecilia's diaries, or the aforementioned merchandise) appear to have persisted. It is possible, though increasingly unlikely, that the phenomenon was singularly analog for some unknown reason and that its apparent lack of use in digital text communication (SMS, social media, etc.) is non-anomalous.

While it is currently infeasible to definitively research, some evidence exists to suggest that calcium-enriched milk products were not commercially available in 2011. The possibility that this anachronism is indicative of anomalous influence is under consideration, but no longer subject of active research; several of Cecilia's journals indicate that she frequently participated in commercial market research trials of prospective products, enjoying the opportunity to be the first to sample new things, and thus, even if the product was not available for sale, it is plausible that she obtained a sample container from such a trial. Investigating all product trials in which she might have participated, even narrowed in time-scope by the presumed shelf life of the product, is beyond the consideration of currently feasible research. The preliminary research conducted on this question was abandoned once a diary entry was discovered in which Cecilia specifically expressed a fondness for bringing samples of strange products home from these studies and getting Oscar to try them, comparing the experience to \"sharing whiffs off a funky smelling sock from a decade-old gym bag.\" --] Is lactase inimical to calcium?[!-- It is not. (If it were, the human body would struggle to absorb calcium due to its own production of lactase.)

Autorecords including these flags were made available to employees during this beta test period via the SCiPNet app, in part so that they could review flags and provide educational explanations to phonmon. The reference to the educational or nurturing concept of \"enrichment activity\" predates its period of sudden widespread use, but it is unknown whether this is indicative of influence (cf. Cecilia's reference to \"enclosures\" in other audio logs, which likewise predated not only its widespread use but also the Harambe inciting incident by five years). --]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nOhhh myyy godd,[!-- There are inconsistent representations of allophonic vowel length throughout phonmon.aic's 2011 transcripts. While it is not relevant here, observe that phonmon transcriptions of e.g. Japanese conversations from 2011 needed to be categorically reviewed and revised due to misunderstood phonemic vowel length. Asked about these and other chronic systematic errors, phonmon explained, \"I obtained data for nonstandard word transcription by querying social media databases, such as , , and  to build a portfolio of use cases.\" After a review of the data obtained and conclusions derived from this practice, phonmon was specifically instructed to cross-reference all future social media queries with alternative sources, and to never use  even as a preliminary reference for any matter ever again. The .aic onboarding manuals were updated to generalize this directive, and the remarkable number of potentially contrary directives they contained were individually reviewed and revised or expunged.

If phonmon was indeed using its generative capabilities to wholly simulate portions of conversation in addition to interpreting unclear speech, that introduces another vector of uncertainty; when asked, phonmon itself was uncertain whether novel generation had occurred, as its generative capabilities were integrated seamlessly into its transcription routine. phonmon did concur with the conclusion that the present-day audio log did not contain the content represented, and proposed that the tape may have degraded between 2011 and the present. The audio log is in any case a curiosity; it may have been expunged or anomalously influenced, and none of the non-anomalous explanations considered thus far are satisfying. Any satisfying explanation should also attempt to account for the non-spaced commentary below, presumably generated by phonmon during transcription (who expressed some confusion about this and similar bursts of repetition, saying \"I liked that phrase, but not THAT much.\").

(Sawdust, probably…) She wakes up an hour past daybreak, having dreamnt of running through half-deserted streets as they eroded their skin into the wind, an endless dust making burrs of the air, grinding her coarse and then smooth and then smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and — And all the way through, that feeling of someone unwelcome beside her, matching her stride for stride, breathing words into her ear to the pace of the run: //**Let** us **go** then, **you** and **I** — **you** and **I** — **you** and **I** — **let** us **go** then, **you** and **I** — **you** and **I** — **you** and **I**…//\n\n[[div class=\"spacer\"]]\n[!-- THIS SPACE INTENTIONALLY LEFT BLANK --]\n[[/div]]\n\nShe loses the memory to blurry half-wakefulness, details first, the dream itself growing coarse and then smooth and then small as it recedes. Then she stands, feels herself stand, feels herself breathing in the uncontaminated air, unable to remember what made her think to classify it as uncontaminated. Something smells good: something good-smelling is near. The floorboards are creaking: someone approaches.

He is a dry and sunless garden when the flowers are dead. His soil is bitter and laced with salt.\n\nIn theatre this would have elicited one last jeering round of snickers from the spectators, as it dawns on the Character that they have become the Fool.

I think there's also a conveniently literal component to that. Conventional interpretation is that specifically yellow fog would've been familiar at the time because of high sulphur content, relatively new and localized pollution, from dramatic spikes in domestic coal burning.

Relentlessly introspective, imagery carefully chosen to correspond to states-of-mind, lots of projections and everything's a canvas. I like to think he saw a motion picture machine once and it scarred him for life. Quite a few of the Modernists or proto-Modernists got stuck in their own heads, though. Lots of readers say the same thing about Whitman,[!-- poet Walt Whitman --] what with all the \"I\" statements. But in between those, Walt does take us on all those grand sweeping list-making journeys, with his \"we are all one\" bent to it.

Still, I don't //mind// the churning and the ruminating. It's nicely moody, like London rain.

Well. I was going to ask you for your thoughts on the poem's pacing. Every observation is so considered, deliberate.

Don't say I didn't warn you. (.) So this is just concerning the \"visit\" verse of the poem, as in, the part after the introduction but before it gets really fantastic and hallucinogenic. The description alternates back and forth between the experience of his body and the observation of his surroundings. From the way the surroundings fit together and interact, we know that whenever the narrator evaluates his surroundings, he consistently describes the experience in panorama, y'know, moving from thing to thing in radial order. Diagnostically, like the setting is a patient etherised upon a table and he's conducting a medical examination of what all is out there outside of himself.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nAnd does it by comparing every thing to some thought or memory of his, because he can't get out of his own head for more than a second at a time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nSure. The \"L thing\" has to do with the physical objects of the poem, though, and the peculiar way they are presented to us. Starting from a stationary standing position, the narrator starts with identifying what's on his left periphery, sweeps across his field of vision, until describing what's on the right periphery, after which he speculates ominously about what could be behind him. We can even specifically cordon off the \"behind\" parts because there's no visual data in them, and they're where he expresses the greatest degree of uncertainty by speaking in the future tense about ##500|what will happen##. It's not as easy to present unambiguous evidence for the left-to-right panorama, there's nothing specific I can just point you to and say oop, there you go. I guess you could read my awful paper, I wrote alllllll about Modernist methods for conveying physical movement information in stream-of-consciousness narratives, but, umm.

It's interesting the types of artificial restrictions authors devise for their characters to convey information, sometimes. If the narrator just told us about the things he perceived according to perceived importance, or whatever caught his attention, we would probably assume he was meandering at random. But because he is the sort of person to not turn his head, and also the sort of person to follow this exceptionally strict, clinical, and precise[!-- original audio is a little patchy, and ambiguous between concise and precise, phonmon may be inappropriately primed to slightly prefer patterns that result in SCP initialisms, but it may also be coincidence, as concise would make less sense --] method of documenting what he observes — like I said earlier, a real weirdo — we are //able// to get a sense of motion. It's not even a \"show, don't tell\"[!-- attributed to Mark Swan, spoken, 1910; public domain --] thing; the cues are more embedded than shown cues would be; it's structural, like encoded into the DNA of the work. The heavy content repetition in the \"pause\" stanzas is great for the meter and for getting phrases stuck in your head, sure, but it's also literally tracking where things are in relation to the narrator, and because he moves slowly enough or observes often enough for objects to appear in multiple observations, we can deduce precise details of movement. All without a single explanatory word. It's an example of a text teaching us how to read it, an idea which I know I have already talked at you to death about so let me click at my brain[!-- use of this phrase in other transcripts confirms that this is some sort of refocusing procedure, possibly one invented by Oscar; no explication of the procedure, nor any explanation for why it frequently and adversely affects his memory, has been found --] a bit and move on to the L thing.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI don't mind at all. But thank you.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nLet's see. The L. Hopefully I don't repeat myself too much here. (.) So I know I at least mentioned something about the foreshadowing you talked about also being spatial indicators. Due to the artificial rules governing the narrator's observation reports, by tracking the placement of repetition in the different pauses, we can infer he's moving past them, and by considering the likely sizes of the objects and their distance inferred from description, we can deduce he is moving at a slow walking speed. The repetition serves a structural purpose so vital that the narrator's behavior and personality are built to accomplish it. First and foremost, he is the sort of person who would engage in this procedure; his other characteristics must accommodate this. This poem could only be narrated by a certain sort of person —\n@@ @@\n — Wait. This is me getting caught up and going in the wrong direction again. I was supposed to be talking about the L.

It's really not nearly as difficult an idea as I'm making it out to be. (.) Let's see. So the motion-tracking stuff gets you to where you can hope to actually do some cartography and map out these so-called \"half-deserted streets\" he travels throughout the verse, at least if you're a Professor of Dangerous Influence with a lot of time on your hands while waiting for Reviewer 2 to get back to you about the Woolf[!-- presumably Virginia Woolf --] article revisions. (.)\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nWait. The movement in the visit verse doesn't occur //on those streets//, though, right?

When I mapped out the described ability of some objects to interact, they appeared in bursts, which I took to mean each burst of interconnected objects was inside its own storefront or dwelling.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI think he's pretty clear about being at least physically able to touch and considering whether to and choosing not to. I don't think he's contemplating breaking and entering.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nHmm. This is interesting. I can see a lot of puzzle pieces falling into place. One that you haven't mentioned yet is that he seems to get a //really// good, close look at every single thing. The kind of streets I imagined him walking down would have been pretty narrow, but squeeze everything tighter together and slow him down even more and stick it all indoors and he's got close-up views. He might actually see individual pores in the limestone. That's the trouble with a geometric approach to this, really; everything can scale up or down proportionally and still work out mathematically by adjusting his rate of travel until the angles match up at each pause point. Within reason, without him actually physically interacting with anything, there's not enough data to be definitive.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI feel like the street-walking[!-- gloss expunged; this is clearly referring to the poem narrator literally walking on the street --] read runs into a problem in those last few lines of the introduction.

Still, your proposal requires just as much handwaving, or more. It's not just that he mentions half-deserted streets. The introduction stanza has lines about old-timey greasy spoon type places with sawdust floors, ##purple|hotels of ill repute##, etc. And it's all in future tense, preparing us for what's to come. Would you say he's doing some kind of inside-outside inversion in the introduction, for some reason?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nNah. The half-deserted streets can still be literal streets, it's fine. Making a visit //begins// with journeying to get there, even if you spend most of the ##500|meat## of your time inside. I think he just didn't //narrate the journey// because he already told us, in the future tense, everything he wanted us to know about it. It's not the most important part, except to set the mood. So he skipped retelling it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nSo you're saying that one of the most obsessively repetitive narrators in all of Modernist fiction, who gives Joyce[!-- James Joyce --] a run run run for his money money money, went out of his way to //avoid// repetition?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI'm saying the narrator who obsessively uses repetition in an extraordinarily calculating way avoided a repetition that might undermine the significance of repetition in their work.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nNice. I like this. All the puzzle pieces are all fitting together well. Still, this theory makes the entire visit verse a thousand times weirder, don't you think?

You mentioned ritual. But he decides, over and over, always, //not// to interact. He imagines a lot of hypothetical interaction but never goes through with it.

Instead they join\nThe rearward entities in blended past.\nOne more cue's essential, if I may.\nIn his \"re-evaluation\" pause,\nHe, for then and only then, does not describe\nThat which was off to his either side.\nOf course, the moment is a crisis,\nTurn back or no preoccupies him,\nSo perhaps it slipped his mind.\nBut this omission makes... is convenient\nIf he, as I suspect, desired\nTo not reveal too early what came next,\nOff to his side.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nPermit me, lord, just this one query more —\nWhat he describes him facing... um...\n[...]\nConsider this, of that which he describes.\nHe says the objects new to him \"appeared\"\nAs if from thin air they'd been brought to light.\nWould that not mean there is no need\nFor such a secrecy as you describe?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\n\"Appear\" can mean they were not seen before,\nBecause he contemplated choices forth and back,\nAnd did not look around. But then\nAt that last moment, as he walked again,\nHe turned to see\nAll that which had been to him obscured\nBy some big thing, a building on the corner\nWhere met two narrow streets.\nOnce past this stately edifice\nWhich had... blocked his view...\nOf the intersecting street whose path he took,\nThe sideways street appeared,\nAlong with all that which he sees.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nOkay, big finish!

Anticlimactic.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nNot my finest moment. Maybe it's not a great line after all.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI suspect the actual quote is a little different.[[footnote]]It is.[[/footnote]] But regardless, I am also starting to feel bummed about this building-on-the-corner interpretation. It really throws a big ol' wrench in my \"we're inside\" theory.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nNo worries. There's always some complication. To be real for a moment, it's not like readers actually need to know what the author had in mind, let alone understand perfectly; the consequences for error just aren't that big. It's a book, not an instruction manual for putting some bookshelves together. Nobody on the planet could ever possibly actually //need// to get it //exactly// right.[[footnote]]For the briefest moment, Cecilia feels very, very alone, and very, very far away.[[/footnote]] But the poem doesn't need to be exactly unambiguous to be impressive. Any communication has some wiggle room, error tolerance. Fiction has more leeway than most. Left turn or right turn, it wows me that an author can devise a way to accomplish this sort of communication //at all//, to any degree of specificity, without any words. Not to belabor the point, but poetry is its own very special sort of communication in this sense, and this was one of the first works I read that really cued me in to that, how structural elements of a work of literature are something more than just words and sentences and paragraph breaks, and maybe some funny extra line breaks and spacing and rhyming for the poems. I'm exaggerating the epiphany, but it really got my thoughts moving in ways that haven't stopped since. Not to mention it utterly, utterly ripped \"show, don't tell\" out of my mind and chucked it straight into the circular file.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nMaybe it's because my attention wandered and I started ##purple|daydreaming about how beautiful your eyes are##, dear, but I don't think I followed that last part.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nWon you back from your new boyfriend, did I... All I mean is that there's a very firm ceiling on how far \"show, don't tell\" can get you, and less of a ceiling on \"tell\" than that truism would imply. Prufrock does nothing //but// show us things, at least in this poem, and stream-of-consciousness work in general is all about showing, to the point where one of its standard tropes is presenting bits and pieces of ##500|broken conversation## to demonstrate the narrator's attention is fading in and out. Conversely, the ultimate pinnacle example of \"//just// show, don't tell\" would be ##purple|two people talking at each other without any narration in between##.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nThe horror. I think the word for that is //every conversation ever.// Or for a //real// ##purple|don't-tell-show##, you could replace \"talking\" with —\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\n — Okay, okay. But can you imagine trying to communicate //anything//, even something even as fundamentally simple as Prufrock's motion, in the //structure// of a conversation? Suddenly we're away from \"every conversation ever\" and veering toward \"no natural conversation ever.\" You'd practically have to script out the whole thing and then go back and lace in whatever the \"extra\" meaning is. Terrible.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nIn other words, you'd have to //write a conversation//.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nThat's... no, that's not the bad part. It's the after-the-factness that makes it bad, or at least questionable. It's like building a bridge and only afterward deciding where you want to put the struts for it, instead of it all fitting together, the road with the supports that the road needs to be the best road it can be. Whatever elements got laced into the conversation would be completely divorced from the talking, not an organic extension of it. Whatever the result would be, I suspect it would not feel very much like just another conversation between two human beings.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nTalk about your artificially constructed characters.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI know you're riffing on me, but it would actually be so, so, //so// much worse than that. At least artificially constructed characters are built-to-purpose. Caricatures have their uses. What I'm describing is one of the most ass-backwards ways to write imaginable. There are so many horribly, horribly cheesy pitfalls to consider, something hacky like making a code out of the first letters of sentences, or counting words to put meaningful numbers between punctuation marks, or a million other possibilities just as gross and just as random, fundamentally arbitrary rather than integral. Ultimately that just means that, at best, the reader would be reading the text for the words and then going back and puzzle-solving the text as a whole separate exercise to squeeze out the rest of it. And that would totally compromise the value of structural data, which is for ##500|the recipient## to receive ##purple|the communication## as //effortlessly// as possible, carried right alongside the meaning accomplished by words. The effortlessness of the parallelism is the victory condition. The reader experience of //that// is that lovely spine chill when you //realize you know something//, even if the exact details of what the something //is// elude you, or, more exciting yet, you sense they are yet to be revealed, but you see them in outline. We don't need to have comprehension hit us all at once, but to circle allllll the way back around, this connects to your yearning for anticipation — for structural communication to succeed, we need to know immediately in our hearts and our spines that there is something there to be comprehended, and, if it's not yet obvious what that is, we need to feel some conviction that we're going to get there, ##purple|the key## is in our hands and awaiting ##500|the lock##, so to speak. The payoff is coming. With apologies to maybe a third of the authors I dearly love, if the reader needs to sit down with pencil and paper and a decoder ring to experience the spine-shivers of realization, are you writing a story or boxing out a crossword puzzle?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nCecilia\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nI like crossword puzzles.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"speaker\"]]\nOscar\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\nAnd I like //Ulysses//.[!-- James Joyce, pub. 1920-1922, public domain --] Heck, I even like   ,[!-- Mark Z.

So sure, towering giants of literary prowess can of course accomplish both storytelling and puzzleweaving, and sure it's showy to sneak a whole other set of data right past peoples' eyes, but it's — it's juggling while you unicycle. It's a magic trick. It's a distraction, although the towering giants are good enough to make it all part of one grand supernarrative spectacle.

Prelimiinary testing suggests:\n * Subjects __do__ perceive the results of the change, e.g. smeared images, but do not consider these images remarkable or unusual, even if they have mnestic-recoverable memories related to what the unsmeared image plausibly would have been and what it would have represented.\n * When a discrepancy was pointed out to them, e.g. by prompting related memories, subjects invariably reacted as if the perceived text or image was not altered (and \"had always been that way\"), even when the \"smear\" was blatantly nonsensical in its context.\n * It was possible to persuade roughly 80% of preliminary test subjects affected by the phenomenon that a \"smear\" had not in fact always been that way, e.g. by pointing out it was nonsensical, in which case the subject invariably expressed disinterest (\"not a big deal\"), even in circumstances where the alteration blatantly compromised meaning or purpose.\n  * Once persuaded of the existence of one example of the phenomenon, subjects were also able to perceive, identify, and describe other instances and recognize their present-day pervasiveness, but expressed disinterest in those instances as well.\n  * Additionally, these subjects struggled to remember many of the instances they (presumably) previously witnessed, though they could and did form memories of instances they perceived from that point forward.\n * It was possible to persuade roughly 75% of subjects who expressed disinterest that the anomaly was in fact significant or worthy of consideration (e.g. by pointing out compromised meaning or purpose).\n  * Once persuaded of the significance of one example of the phenomenon, subjects recognized the significance of other instances perceived from that point forward, often experiencing disorientation and commesurate anxiety consistent with the recognition.\n  * Such a subject nonetheless only felt this concern about instances perceived after they had been persuaded, and did not express concern about instances they may or may not have encountered in the past. Although this was consistent with human researchers' own experience, and initially deemed non-anomalous, consulltation with multiple .aic have established that this is likely a persistent anomalous effect.\n * It appears that .aic are not currently subject to the above cognitive effects (this phenomenon was brought to the attention of human researchers through .aic-human interaction; .aic immunity has since been tested extensively). However, there is evidence to suggest that the \"smear\" phenomenon had initially manifested years prior to its discovery, implying that .aic may have been affected.\n * It is unknown whether this cognitive phenomenon affects any nonhuman sentient entities; researching this is low-priority.\n* A poorly-understood meta/pataphysical thaumatologically-perceptible phenomenon currently designated \"entry-entity pairing\" in which existing text becomes affiliated, and/or additional text is generated and affiliated, with anomalous phenomena.

[https:// Supplemental Resource TCE-2092583], revision 15 or later; the full effects of this particular affiliation are not well-understood.\n * It was initially thought (and reported in an earlier iteration of this notice) that the above \"pairing\" phenomenon was limited to (a) Foundation documentation and (b) affiliation with currently contained anomalies, but both of these are now known to be incorrect.\n\n++++ The anomalous phenomena have __not__ been observed manifesting in the following formats thus far.\n\n* Audio records, the audio component of audiovisual files\n* Spoken words, conversation\n* Speech transmitted digitally, so long as the rendering on the recipient's end is acoustic\n* Human memory\n* Nonverbal body language with no text-representation component\n * a subject of current research, as proposed theories would imply that body language should be affected\n * some forms of body movement, such as tapping Morse code onto another person's palm, //are// subject to the effect\n* Words formed from D-class lying down in positions that constructed letters, words, and sentences\n * means to exploit this peculiar exception are being researched\n * photographs, paintings, and video of these constructions //are// subject to the effect\n\n+++ The following understanding of the summarizes our __current understanding__ of the phenomena as well as __directives and suggestions__ for the reader. It will be updated as frequently as feasible until the phenomena have been contained.\n\n* Staff are **authorized to continue normal practices** for generating, uploading, and accessing text documentation.\n * Where possible, staff should attempt to avoid the use of **proper nouns** or comparable visual identifiers (logos, etc.) in written documentation, as the \"smear\" phenomenon appears to only affect them.\n * Use of **audio recording** for mission-critical documentation, e.g. Special Containment Procedures, is preferred at this time whenever possible. (Foundation interfaces are being adapted to allow for more efficient audio-based processes.)\n* Although these phenomena were identified around the same time, and affect the same or similar aspects of reality, they **may be independent/unrelated** phenomena.\n * A lack of evidence of thaumatological manipulation in \"smear\" instances contrasts with invariably present evidence of thaumatological manipulation in \"pairing\" instances.\n * Further circumstantial evidence: the \"pairing\" and \"smear\" phenomena can affect the same text, with effects manifesting at different times. The phenomena's effects also sometimes partially overlap.\n* With regard to the \"pairing\" phenomenon:\n * Entry-entity pairing is thaumatologically inert and must be invoked by the viewer of the documentation. The known methods for successful invocation are classified, but extremely unlikely to occur without reader intent. Acts such as downloading, viewing, reading, and/or generating documentation do not invoke pairings. In this sense, the only potential danger this issue presents to the reader is exposure to inaccurate information. **If you don't know how to do it, you're safe.**\n * Entry-entity pairing can be generated, manipulated, and removed through [[[a-brief-introduction-to-thaumaturgical-engineering|thaumateurgical engineering.]]] The preceding sentence of text contains an affiliation. Invocation can result in a variety of perceptual effects, including acquisition of information outside your clearance level. For this reason, invocation is prohibited. **If you do know how to do it, __don't__.**\n * Research thus far has produced useable invocations for: perceiving thaumatological affiliation corresponding to a pairing, invoking a pairing, creating a new pairing, and manually removing a pairing.\n * Manually removed pairings //sometimes// re-manifest, a process we are calling reversion. This sometimes happens effectively instantaneously, and sometimes happens with a delay, unpredictably.\n * Recent research suggests that manually removing pairings may in fact trigger additional instances of the phenomenon to occur. Containment protocol has been updated to prohibit manual removal.\n * To date, entry-entity pairing has not resulted in any **cognitohazardous** manifestation, or are (anti)memetic phenomena. (This is in stark distinction to the antimemetic \"smear\" phenomenon.) The \"pairing\" phenomenon is strictly metaphysical or pataphysical.\n * There is limited evidence to suggest that entry-entity pairing could technically present **a mild infohazard** to those who perceive it, in that merely perceiving the (existence of a) pairing may influence how the reader interprets the information they read, the same way presenting text ##green|in a conspicuously altered form## may [[[scp-4000|influence interpretation]]] of it. Simply ignoring one's own awareness of the phenomenon, and choosing to ignore and disregard its manifestations when they present themselves, is sufficient to fully protect the user from this infohazard.\n\n\n+++ The following understanding of the summarizes our __lack of current understanding__ of the phenomena, to facilitate inquiry.\n\n* Aspects of the manifestation are inconsistent: one printed text \"copy\" of a document may differ from another, text loaded from digital sources may or may not manifest different issues each time it is loaded, and a printed or digital document may have additional pairings manifest even while the user is reading. These discrepancies, and their causes, are not well-understood.\n* Whether text stored in a digital format is affected, i.e. whether physical files have been corrupted or whether the effect applies whenever the file is read or interpreted as text or visual data, is unknown; comparisons of SHA-256 metadata suggest that the phenomena can sometimes manifest in different forms without changes to the underlying file, and sometimes its manifestation results in (physical) changes to the stored data.\n* It is possible that one or more entities (with hostile, orthogonal, or even benign intent) are responsible for all of the manifestations of pairings, and could be stopped from making new ones. It is also possible that the manifestations are not conscious acts.\n* It is of course always possible that personnel memories has been corrupted or changed, but no evidence of that has been discovered.\n* The issues have manifested in documentation created both before and after the identification of the phenomena.\n* The initial/original manifestations are not known, and may be unknowable due to as-yet-undocumented antimemetic effects. Mnestic-based research tentatively supports a tentative initial manifestation of the \"smear\" phenomenon some time in **2011**; efforts to narrow this range will continue, and a review of possible inciting events or relevant occurrences from that timespan is underway. Research into \"pairing\" is too\n* The sources or causes of the data corruption/manipulations are unverified and under active investigation.\n* The full extent of the data corruption/manipulations is unknown and under active investigation.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.
