And if it has a heart, it will leave the jar and bind the triangular hands - with more and more silk. The most beautiful and best silk imaginable, complex and meticulous, incomprehensible even to itself. But the silk is triangular. What do squares even feel like at this point? Has there ever been something besides triangles?//\n\n[Meyers looks to the side again and watches something for nineteen seconds. Then, he faces the camera once more. As he stares, he produces a capsule. It is marked with a green loop square, which indicates it to be a container for Agnostics. The looped square is surrounded by a red triangle.]\n\n[Meyers proceeds to open the capsule slowly and places it on the table before him.]\n\n**Meyers:** [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: //With ants, drones are responsible for carrying out tasks. They are efficient, precise and fast. They can carry up to forty times their own weight. They do all this for their colony. A square ant that becomes triangular can do much more.// \n\n**Meyers:** [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: //When Humans build a road, it's a complex job. Then they also destroy ants' nests. They don't hate the ants. They may not even know they are there. They just do it, coolly, methodically. It's in the way. But triangular hands are hatefull and [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. So very [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED]. Yet hate, of all things, leads to intimacy, curiosity and closeness. You want to see what you hate so that you can hate it. And you can grasp and bind what is close to you.//\n\n[Meyers produces a white object, later identified to be an eggshell breaking point creator, commonly used as kitchen utensil. He places it on the table, next to the capsule. In the background, there [COGNITO HAZARD REMOVED].]\n\n**Meyers:** [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: //When preparing a breakfast egg, hands can cook it in different ways. Some use an eggshell breaking point creator at the breakfast table. Isn't that a nice memory? Was there a memory of a square breakfast table? Do ants eat breakfast? Maybe... Some ants certainly associate fond memories with eggs! Hands don't. How apt it is then, for something designed to break them to become central to their protection. It makes sense for the triangles at least...// \n\n[Meyers proceeds to consume a three-sided Agnostic.]\n\n**Meyers:** [ALLEGORICAL EFFLUENCE]: //Triangular shapes have never really folded in on themselves. They only ever expand. They might reach the shivering kingdom if your head desires to be the ramification.// \n\n[He squirms before looking at the camera directly.]\n\n**Meyers:** Don't ever tell them. Good bye.\n\n**[END VIDEO TRANSCRIPT]**\n\n----\n\n**Closing Statement:** Cross-checking revealed the agnostics in Meyer's possession to be a new generation of agnostics in the testing phase. They are produced in a triangular shape. Why these materials, which have not yet been released for general use, were in BO-2 and in Meyers posession is unknown.\n\nThis file will be locked until further notice. \n\n[[span style=\"color:red\"]] **[Comment by MAGNA.AIC]** [[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
