Unlike the **[[[Guide Hub]]]**, the following articles are not considered required reading or official advice, but may still be interesting or useful.\n\nUnlike the “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/guide guide]” tag, the “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/essay essay]” or “[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/resource resource]” tags can be added by authors to their own works, which you can then add here in the appropriate section (list works in alphabetical order). Essays are intended to offer advice and opinion on specific aspects of the SCP Foundation or SCP Wiki, while Resources list information about various aspects of the SCP Foundation setting, often as a collaboration open to new contributions. Hub pages containing useful information have also been listed below for ease of access. Message a member of the [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main| MAST]]] collab log pruning team if you're unsure whether your work meets the criteria to be classed as an Essay or Resource, or if you think a new subsection should be created. \n\n[[toc]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel standalone series\"]]\n+ On the Setting of the SCP Foundation\n//Official and unofficial hub pages and resources, including compilation lists open to contributions from any site member.
