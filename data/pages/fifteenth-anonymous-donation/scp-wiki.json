No matter how much aide we give and how far our strides in the sciences and paranormal go, we cannot offer the very thing those we help (and those within our organization) desperately plead for the most; sleep.\n\nWe have known it possible to achieve sleep thanks to the upper echelons of society who use their wealth and contacts to [[[hypnotraline|buy rest.]]] Those who hold the secret of sleep refuse to share it, as is expected of their avaricious nature. While they enjoy slumber, those who need it most toil and despair in an endless waking state, unable to meet with the [[[oneiroi|Collective.]]] \n\nBut kind souls still exist in this world. Some few weeks ago our Gulf headquarters received several hundred Amazon-branded boxes with no return address, all of them crudely marked [[[SCP-3866|'sleepy time snooze em up pills']]] in Sharpie. Though I was initially hesitant to receive them, I simply could not pass up the opportunity to test if these so-called 'sleeping pills' worked. With an entire world desperate for sleep, I owed it to those in need to at least try.\n\nOne of our older volunteers, one brave and gentle soul named Leonor DeCastro (a lovely woman 132 years of age) offered to test it herself. With medical staff on standby, she took a pill, swallowed, and drifted off into what looked like a much-needed rest. \n\nMuch to our alarm, her heart rate slowed to a crawl and we feared she was suffering a negative side effect. Our medical staff quickly made sure her blood was flowing, and much to our surprise, it was. Theoretically speaking, one can remain in a peaceful slumber nearly indefinitely, so long as they are tended to by a waking being.\n\nLeonor rested for about a week under our care. She woke up after eight days without any major complications, aside from minor atrophy. Leonor described her rest as 'the best she's had in years' and was even able to dream, even meeting the Collective once again! \n\nI have great hopes for this miracle, and I look forward to the rest we will be able to provide with it. The world, now more than ever, needs sleep.\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[size 130%]][[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]**Addendum~**[[/span]][[/size]]\n\nOne of the relief workers in Sudan found this note within an unopened box of the item, believed to be written by the anonymous benefactor of these pills.\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 15px; text-align:center\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Comic Sans MS; \"]]\n> helo\n>  \n> sorry for not make the time for give sleepy time pills in person\n> i has to leaf sleepy time pills in big hurry or fundashiun find me \n> i trust u to keep secret of sleepy time snooze em up pills and use for feel entropy\n> have good sleep\n> \n> yours trulee\n> [[span style=\"color: transparent; text-shadow: 0 0 7px rgba(0,0,0,.5)\"]]dado[[/span]]\n> \n> \n> [[span style=\"font-family: Comic Sans MS; \"]]pes\n> sorry for name erase dado like to do charitea anonymoose\n[[/span]]\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[size 130%]][[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]**Maintenance and Operation:**[[/span]][[/size]] All  supplies must be kept in a sealed and dry environment and should only be administered by trained medical specialists.

There's a lot to do today so this bulletin will be brief, but I just want to let you know that we're focusing on recovery, medical aid, and I assigned a few crews to restore downed power lines. \n\nWishing you well,\n\n- Emergency Response Force Captain N.

At the time of writing, there are 15 individuals which are slated to awaken in late October. I would love to be able to grant them all a peaceful rest, but I have explained to them that we only have a limited quantity and have to follow very strict instructions. Though they didn't seem to be happy, I think they got the message.\n\nWishing you well,\n\n- Emergency Response Force Captain N.

After the first one last month we wisened up and are keeping the sleeping pills in the basement, but these are getting more and more frequent. We're still waiting to hear from the President about sending a unit to help protect us from opportunists.\n\nLast bit of bad news: the locals are getting uppity. A few of them keep hanging around outside our facility to spit and jeer at volunteers as they move around. They keep asking to be put to sleep. Having had my own dosage and period of rest last year, I completely understand why they would want one, especially after having faced such a traumatic natural disaster. We keep trying to reason with them, but it doesn't seem to be helping. We will, however, endure.\n\nThe good news is we've finally gotten potable water flowing through most of the city, all thanks to the efforts of our wonderful construction crews. Our next focus: build a shelter for those who have been left homeless. \n\nLooking forward to the future,\n\n- Emergency Response Force Captain N.

Many of them are crippled as a result of the recent earthquake, are ancient, or both. Fortunately, the army was able to step in and is protecting us for the time being.\n\nOur construction crews have also been getting harassed by the locals, but the army is not willing to send men out to the disaster site. Due to concerns regarding the safety of the construction crews, I have recalled them and temporarily re-assigned them to patient care. I hope you join your hearts with mine in hoping this blows over soon so we may resume helping unimpeded.\n\nSeeking solidarity,\n\n- Emergency Response Force Captain N.

Many of them pleaded to be put back to rest, begging to not have to endure their mortal toil any further. One, a man in his late fifties, attacked a medical volunteer, leaving her concussed.\n\nAfter enlisting the help of a few of the army's men to remove the offenders from our premises, we have ensured the well-being of our volunteer. She is expected to make a full recovery.\n\nThis event has me worried, however. By releasing the individuals into society once again the public is sure to become more desperate in their demands. The army men are starting to give us the side-eyes as of late, too. I can't help but suspect as if they will turn on us eventually, but I sincerely believe that goodwill will win out here.\n\nHoping for the best, \n\n- Emergency Response Force Captain N.
