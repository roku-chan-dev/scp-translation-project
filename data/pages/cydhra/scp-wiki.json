Four neon lamps decorate the ceiling, but two are broken. The center of the room is dominated by an industrial cooking island, the walls are covered in shelves containing an assortment of weird stuff. Dozens of containers, glasses, boxes and kitchen utensils are floating through the air, seemingly staffing and running the kitchen all by themselves.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-1 users=\".\"]]\n//\"Greetings, %%title%%!\"//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-2]]\n//\"Hello, stranger!\"//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-3]]\n\nA simple fishbowl sitting on the kitchen island speaks to you. Or rather, the small axolotl inside it. It is wildly flailing its tiny arms, as if orchestrating the chaos.\n\n//\"Take a look around, something ought to be of your taste!
