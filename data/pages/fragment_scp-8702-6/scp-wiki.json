It's hard to //chew.//\n> \n> //[Canned laughter.]//\n> \n> Anyway, this guy's a scientist from Foundatia, from the province of Diet Russia -- Belarus, sorry.\n> \n> //[Canned laughter.]//\n> \n> And because he's //clearly// got that much time on his hands, his work in the field of RNA Compassing is gonna let me keep hosting this show for the next 200 years.

I //hope// is true.\n> \n> //[Canned laughter.]//\n> \n> **DeGeneres:** But like, I'm talking about the specific part where you said the two things you hated the most were, uh, lemon juice and zebras? Kinda... I dunno, oddly specific. Like, \"hey guys, I'm afraid of balsamic vinegar and kangaroos.\"\n> \n> //[Canned laughter.]//\n> \n> **Fabrikant:** I mean, is not so much being //afraid// of, more like feeling weird around. For one thing, the smell of lemon juice -- I have very good sense of smell, but... like a blessing and a curse, because --\n> \n> **DeGeneres:** So you like eating salmon with nothing on it?\n> \n> **Fabrikant:** I mean --\n> \n> **DeGeneres:** Your fish is //naked,// sir.\n> \n> //[Canned laughter.]//\n> \n> **Fabrikant:** Heh, well, I don't --\n> \n> **DeGeneres:** Just keep swimming, am I right?\n> \n> //[Wild canned laughter, canned applause.]//\n> \n> **Fabrikant:** As for zebras, I dunno.
