While the vast majority of memes develop through transmission and evolution, a metastatic meme develops through appension, a process during which the meme will completely absorb an idea and append its retained ideatic mass to itself. Eventually, a metastatic meme will consist mostly of absorbed concepts, to the point where the original meme is unidentifiable. It is at this point that it is considered a complex. (Calloway, A. G., Marness, L. P. (n.d.). //A Comprehensive Guide to Ideatic Anomalies// (2nd ed., Vol. 2, Ser. 1). Foundation Research Press.) [[/footnote]] currently occupying the linguistic aspect of the noosphere. SCP-5712 develops through the subsumption of English lexemes humanly associated with concepts already appended to its ideatic mass. The process by which SCP-5712 associates concepts can be controlled through interactions with SCP-5712-A in the form of word association games.\n\nSCP-5712-A is the Foundation supercomputer //Peirce//, constructed in ████ for the purpose of analyzing ideatic and conceptual anomalies within the noosphere. SCP-5712-A's anomalous properties demanifested following the disappearance of SCP-5712-B (See **Addendum V**).\n\nSCP-5712-B is an experimental thaumaturgical component infused with the Tartarean entity commonly referred to as Belial (TE-0068).

SCP-5712 (which [*https://www.scpwiki.com/scp-3125 may or may not be the only one of its kind]) appears to be a predatory meme that devours other concepts. What actually occurs to its prey is uncertain, but in all known cases thus far, subsumed concepts effectively develop antimemetic properties and are either erased or replaced within the noosphere. I suspect they are absorbed into the mass of SCP-5712.\n\nThe infosphere is a hostile environment that we feeble humans should never have sought out.

The best we can do right now is try to slow it down, and even then, its complete subsumption of all concepts is inevitable. The fact of the matter is, we are fighting a losing battle; Murasaki.aic has already had to resort to several high-risk, compromising maneuvers to limit the transmission of SCP-5712.\n\nFurthermore, the effects of //every// transmission of SCP-5712, whether beneficial in the long term or not, has to be dealt with by the Disinformation Bureau. During my inquiry with the regional Disinformation Bureau liaison, Xavier Solera, he sent me the following list of recent Disinformation Bureau operations regarding SCP-5712:\n\n> * Officially renaming the Arab Republic of **Egypt**\n> * Replacing all copyright records of **jelly** with **preserve**\n> * Unofficially aiding multiple billion-dollar restaurant franchises in rebranding their primary product, the **hamburger**\n> * Redefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with **axis**\n> * Redefining geography, mathematics, and physics terminology associated with **projection**\n> * Developing an alternative American history without the existence of Abraham **Lincoln**\n> * Administering mnestics to all Foundation personnel to ever have worked on GoI-005 (\"**Fifth**ism\")\n\nIn conclusion, the impacts of SCP-5712 correspond with that of an uncontained anomaly, and as of writing, no effective containment procedures have been developed. As such, I am officially requesting a Keter-classification for SCP-5712 with a strong recommendation for decommissioning if at all possible. I've already submitted my official proposal to the Decommissioning Department.\n\nJacqueline Sydney\n**Classification Committee**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Decommissioning Proposal\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block; border: dashed 1px #cdcdcd; background: #F5F5F5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto; padding: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**Decommissioning Proposal Form**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Item #:** SCP-5712\n\n**Object Class:** --Thaumiel-- Redesignation Pending\n\n**Head Researcher:** Dr. Alistair Dankworth\n\n**Supporting Personnel:**\n* //Dr. Nadia Amari representing Occult Studies Division//\n* //Jacqueline Sydney representing Classification Committee//\n* //Xavier Solera representing Disinformation Bureau//\n\n**Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**\n☑ Excessive Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n☐ Excessive Danger\n☐ Expense\n☐ Ethical Concern\n☐ Legal Concern\n☐ Potential to Decommission Apollyon-Class Object\n☐ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s)):\n☑ Other (please state): Invasive anomaly under TYR Protocol[[footnote]]A preemptive executive order by the O5 Council that invasive anomalies originating externally to the Earth ought to be prevented from fully manifesting within the Earth if at all possible.[[/footnote]] and theoretically uncontainable without neutralization.\n\n**Summary:** Containment of SCP-5712 is unsustainable. Assuming continuation of current containment procedures, Murasaki.aic estimates that SCP-5712 will subsume 100% of the noosphere within 12 years, resulting in unknown and likely undesirable memetic effects. Furthermore, SCP-5712 has already demonstrated considerable likelihood in resulting in a Lifted Veil scenario due to difficulty of proliferating disinformation regarding SCP-5712. Lastly, SCP-5712 has been officially designated an invasive anomaly, technically justifying neutralization under TYR Protocol.

A contingent of Foundation semioticians and linguists have been organized and officially established as STF σ-14 (\"Wordsmiths\") to deter the development of SCP-5712 through the creation of superfluous lexemes for feeding purposes.\n\nAlthough Foundation supercomputer //Peirce// no longer displays any anomalous properties, it is still referred to as SCP-5712-A in relevant documentation for archival purposes.\n\nAs of writing, neither SCP-5712-B nor Dr. Nadia Amari have been recovered.\n\n[[div style=\"display: block; border: dashed 1px #cdcdcd; background: #F5F5F5; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: auto; padding: 10px\"]]\nWe were fishing in dangerous waters. Should've known we might end up baiting a shark, but Amari kept pulling, until she pulled it out of the water.\n\nAnd for a brief moment, I saw [*https://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5800 the other side] —  the infosphere.\n\nSCP-5712 is barely the tip of the iceberg. Belial called it a \"bottom feeder\", and they weren't lying. It might be a shark to us, but compared to the things on the other side, it's less than nothing. It just happened to be the first one we let in.\n\nNow the real sharks know the way in. And they smell blood.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5711]]] | SCP-5712 | [[[SCP-5713]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
