The contents of SCP-1020-J prior to this are unknown, and attempts to take samples resulted in the equipment becoming disgusting beyond usability before any readings could be made.\n\nInside of SCP-1020-J is a self-sustaining boutique blend of garbage, visually comparable to a protoplasmic cube composed of and containing the rotting curdling, self-bleach-proofed dregs, of what once may have been edible foodstuffs. \n\nThe stink wave unleashed by opening its door can be detected from inside a ground-level enclosed structure by sniffer dogs from a distance of 2.5 kilometers. Survivors of direct exposure have not been able to compare it to other odors due to the obliteration of their olfactory nerves.\n\n[[div style=\"background-color:#000080\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ [[span style=\"color:white\"]]**{{TEST LOG}}**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n= __**1020-J Cleaning Attempt 111-331**__\n\n> **Subject:** D-0918\n> \n> **Materials:** Chlorine-based cleaning chemicals, scrubbing and cleaning equipment, garbage bags, PPE\n> \n> **Results:** During and after fifteen minutes of testing, D-0918 reported burning pain in their nose, throat, chest, ears, mouth, eyes, and skin[[footnote]]Including beneath the toenails[[/footnote]].
