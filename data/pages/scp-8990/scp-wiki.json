One must stare at the inexplicable with explicative sight. Sometimes we must pay our coin of attention to the cosmologically intense- right now, it's two incredibly loud men who might end the world.\n\nAnomalies with two aspects or individual elements that make up their totality are not uncommon. Many anomalies possess multiple instances beyond the duelist amount. Some anomalies are theorized to be hundreds of individual entities, but there are very few anomalies that are cohabitive. Cohabitive in this case means that the anomaly is composed of two or more parts whose paranatural effects do not activate until they are within contact. One may look at [[[SCP-2273 | the man in the alien suit]]] for the prototypical symbiotic anomaly, most importantly how both creatures benefit from the arrangement.\n\nSCP-2273 is the low bar for cohabitive oddity anomalies. Parathreats come in all sizes, and thankfully that one is relatively easy to contain. There are many with dual components that are nearly impossible to contain, that constantly run their clawed hands across our thin veneer of a Veil, that push and challenge our capabilities to their highest points. They may only possess two parts, but it can take two entire departments in order to contain them. In this piece we will take a look at these anomalies, and attempt to understand why dualism is so relatively common within the anomalous world...\n[[div class=\"page-fullline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"notepage-footer\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"mz-cover\"]]\nA CK-Shift of Reality occurred on August 15th, 1954, when Noxin and Pressler were within one hundred feet of each other.

As such, much of this research has been collected utilizing willing members of Project Collibus and Foundation contacts within the US Census Bureau and is based on our current stable reality. Born in Yorba Linda, California on January 9th, 1913, he was raised in a nuclear family consisting of --seven six-- five siblings and two conservative Quaker parents. His parents, the father a former roustabout and latent entrepreneur, the mother a stay-at-home parent with incredible virtues, massively affected his outlook on life. In private moments, Noxin claimed to fear the Abrahamic God based on the assumption that He took away Noxin's parents as punishment. Two of his siblings died early from tuberculosis, which seems to have caused a consistent desire to have updated inoculations.\n\nFrom his early years, he invested his time into political pursuits, all of them utter failures. His father was a successful politician, but was unfortunately struck down by an errant milk truck as Noxin cusped the age of sixteen. The loss of this father figure caused a subsequent downhill trend in Noxin's life- he began and continues to drink heavily, extricate himself from as much of his family life as possible, shut out any lines of communications with his mother, and move as far away from his home as possible. He still carries his family with him, but demonstrates it in odd ways.\n\nHis current occupation is garbageman in Toledo, Ohio, a position that takes him around almost every neighborhood. Within every area he resides within due to his frequent wandering, he is considered a brash, uncompromising individual with ridiculous opinions and far-fetched ideals. His intense dislike of any people's of the following categories has lead to his friendships being reduced to close to zero- Africans, South Americans, Europeans, Jewish peoples, Asians, queers, \"uppity\" women, and any man who has hair longer than six inches.\n----\n@@ @@\nEric Aaron Pressler, born on January 8, 1935, in Tupelo, Mississippi, wasn't exactly destined to be much. From an early age, Eric exhibited a profound interest in gospel music, heavily influenced by the sounds resonating from the local church. His family's financial struggles added a layer of hardship to his childhood, contributing to a sense of isolation that would accompany him into his early twenties.\n\nEric developed an astonishingly inflated sense of self-importance. Even when he was a kid, all research indicates that he lacked in intelligence, leading to him being held back for several years. His youth was marked by financial struggles, a fractured family dynamic, and a feeling of estrangement from his peers. While this may make you feel bad for him, the way he continues to blame everyone for his own misgivings may make you think otherwise.\n\nEric's early twenties were characterized by an unparalleled egotism, a trait that, while contributing to his undeniable charisma, also alienated those around him. His arrogance, often bordering on rudeness, became a defining feature of his personality. Despite his undeniable vocal prowess and looks, Eric Pressler's interactions with others were tainted by a relentless pursuit of self-interest and a disregard for the feelings of those who surrounded him.\n\nAs he sought opportunities in the music industry, Eric displayed an unapologetic and cutthroat approach to achieving success. His ruthless ambition sometimes overshadowed the collaborative spirit inherent in the world of music. Although, like many things, this did not go far for him. Even then, as a bartender at the //Rue & Ruse'd// local pub, he still believed that he has what it takes to become big.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"mmposter-wrap mmposter-blockquote\" ]]\n[[div class=\"mmposter-cell\" ]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"mz-column\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mmposter-wrap mmposter-blockquote\" ]]\n[[div class=\"mmposter-cell\" ]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"mz-cover\"]]\nA CK-Shift of Reality occurred on August 15th, 1965, when Noxin and Pressler met each other in the main supermarket of Toledo.
