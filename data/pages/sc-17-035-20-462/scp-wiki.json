The Foundation and its nefarious cohorts swung their blood-stained right hand, ruthlessly tearing apart the paranormal world. As we strive to mend the scars left by the surging crimson river, those who have freed themselves from the Foundation's diseased grip may come to our aid.\n\nThe Foundation's protection is violence, while our struggle is healing. To save this suffering world, we must eliminate the source of the pestilence. Cast logs into the blazing flames. We shall burn them with their own fire. We shall create reason from illogic.\n\nHereafter, we of Delta Command document the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.\n\n**1. STEP 17/035:** Recently, it has been confirmed that two high-risk anomalous entities under the Foundation's containment have successfully escaped. Known as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-035|SCP-035]]] and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-049|SCP-049]]], these entities partially [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/everyone-wears-a-mask|destroyed]]] Site-19 on August 17, 2017, before disappearing without a trace. As their exact objectives are unknown, efforts to track their current whereabouts have met significant difficulties. However, the highly destructive anomalous properties of these entities strongly suggest that they hold substantial significance.\n\nIt has been confirmed that the entity leading the escape was SCP-035. Accordingly, the R&D department must utilize anomalous data and assets secured since 1948 to develop effective measures for recapturing this entity. The presence of SCP-049 will also act as a significant variable, which must likewise be considered.\n\nDispatched Beta-class personnel are to search Site-19 while avoiding unnecessary conflicts with the Foundation whenever possible. Should the two entities fall under the influence of the Chaos Insurgency, the inevitable war of attrition will proceed from a more advantageous position. There is no need to rush and jeopardize the operation through haste.\n\n**2. Step 18/725:** It has been [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/do-no-harm|confirmed]]] that SCP-049 is among the inventory of Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd. Unfortunately, it is not the entity itself being auctioned but rather a service exploiting its anomalous properties for pseudo-contract killings. Unsurprisingly, these money-grubbing opportunists refused to relinquish their \"product.\" However, thanks to the helpful negotiations of Delta Command, we were able to extract some useful pieces of information.\n@@ @@\n* SCP-049 accompanied SCP-035 to Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd. on July 25, 2018.\n* SCP-035 demanded that MC&D provide SCP-049 with sufficient resources and protection in exchange for SCP-049's assistance to MC&D, a deal which MC&D accepted.\n* At the time of the encounter, SCP-035's host was a woman's body that showed no signs of decay despite exposure to the entity's secretions.\n* SCP-035 stared intensively at SCP-049 as he was transported to MC&D headquarters before departing to an unknown location. Its exact destination remains unclear.\n\nAs the acquisition of SCP-049 has been rendered practically impossible, the pursuit should be limited exclusively to SCP-035. Given that SCP-035 has evidently obtained an immortal body, the R&D department must continue its research with this fact in mind. The military department must also conduct its tracking efforts while considering the significantly heightened threat posed by the entity.\n\nJudging by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-the-shadow-of-the-anguished-lord|relationship]]] suggested by the information gathered regarding SCP-035 and SCP-049, the successful containment of SCP-035 is likely to either prompt SCP-049's voluntary surrender or provide equivalent assistance.\n\n**3. Step 19/049:** While dismantling the flesh of the defeated Fifthist monster to free it from its agony, we coincidentally obtained information from their cult about an individual known as the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/an-angel-who-has-forsaken-sympathy|Star Surgeon]]].\n\nThese twenty-four entities commonly possessed five arms and five heads, with inverted protruding eyes and black smoke pouring from each mouth. Based on their violence and destructive power, their significant potential as military assets has been proposed. It is speculated that this individual known as \"Star Surgeon\" is the creator of these entities, and their recruitment could lead to the mass production of a formidable army.\n\nAcquired information of the \"Star Surgeon\" is listed below:\n@@ @@\n* A black robe covering the entire body.\n* A face resembling that of a pale white crow.\n* Exceptionally advanced surgical skills, occasionally reviving the dead.\n* A journal that he always carries and an obsessive attachment to it.\n\nHe is currently evaluated as an excellent asset to replace SCP-049 detained at MC&D, so initiate the pursuit based on the information mentioned above.\n\n**4. Step 20/462:** While detaining a group of anomalous artist-terrorists affiliated with AWCY, suspicious patterns were observed among them. Although their art is grotesque and utterly harmful to the world, their foolish ideology and inflated delusions, cloaked in the guise of individuality, remain confined to the mass production of bizarre creations.\n\nThe detained individuals produced extremely dark and grotesque artifacts, while secreting a black liquid from every bodily orifice, including eyes, nose, mouth, and sweat glands. Although the exact cause of this phenomenon remains unknown, the R&D department is to study this occurrence and explore weaponization as a cognitohazard or a similar form, as it is anticipated to be highly useful in armed confrontations with the Foundation and its allies.\n\nAdditionally, aside from the neutralization of individuals, the secretions of these artists exhibit properties highly similar or identical to those of SCP-035, suggesting potential for weaponization. This may serve as a substitute for SCP-035.\n\nThe preserved artworks resemble the style of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-5462|Francisco Goya]]]'s \"Black Paintings\" series. Securing the 13th Black Painting, which even the Foundation has failed to obtain, is expected to impact Stage 20/462 significantly. Therefore, postpone Stage 17/035 and Stage 18/725 to prioritize the search for the 13th Painting.\n\nThose who ramble excessively about \"The Mask of Agony\" and \"Eternal Life\" should be executed if their behavior escalates.",
