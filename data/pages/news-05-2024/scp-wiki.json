With such a successful article, we at the Site News team were curious as to what the author had to say. So we are bringing you an interview with the author!\n>\n> **1. What was your inspiration for your article?**\n\n**Plague:** There were a few things. First, I viewed SCP-7001 as a failure and the antithesis of what someone should write for a K-Contest. It was artificially written to meet a quota, not written out of love for the site or the concept. 7001 was my first time writing something \"big,\" with stakes and lore development; it was not a PlaguePJP article. Anyone could have written SCP-7001. That lingering failure has inspired many of my works, most famously my SCP-001 proposal. That brings me to my next point of inspiration, the question of \"What the hell do I do after I post this proposal?\" I view SCP-001 proposals as the culmination of an author's work, and for me, it was bittersweet because it felt like I had nothing left to achieve on the wiki. I wrote three or four short shitpost-ish articles after my 001 Proposal was posted, but all of it felt hollow because I had this achievement, and now it's just gone with the wind. Time moved forward, and I had to keep up or be forgotten. I also felt like I had a new standard to reach; no one pushed me to have this standard; it's just that ever-lingering insecurity that creeps on me occasionally. SCP-8000 is meant to be me bearing those feelings raw and showing myself and everyone else that no matter what you may think of yourself, //you// set your own standards and your own pace, //you// have been successful, and nothing can change that.\n\nOn top of this, I was inspired by A Christmas Carol, one of my favorite books as a kid, and a movie my family always rewatched around Christmas time. I'm also infamously known for the SCP-001-J proposal \"The Great Seal.\" In my efforts to craft the most PlaguePJP piece, it felt wrong not to make the anomaly another seal.\n\n> **DianaBerry:** That’s very interesting! I like how you wanted to write something out of love for the site this time.\n>\n> **2. What made you write the seal the way did? Did you have any other personality in mind before you stuck with the one you went with?**\n\n**Plague:** I'm known on the wiki for my very loud, boisterous, sarcastic characters. I wanted to diverge a bit from that, subvert some expectations, and write an all-good character. The fantasy theme helped this out, as mentors are a genre staple. Think of your Gandalfs or Dumbledores. A seal wasn't my original idea; I actually came up with what became the SEEKER machine before so the character of the seal was something I had to work out as I was writing. Coming up with the character voice was easy, though; I love sewing in small dialogue quirks, such as the seal calling Lague Mr. Paul instead of Mr. Lague. From there I just tried to imbue that character with other elements past just being a mentor. Yes, he does care, but he's also a little chill and can be jokey or sarcastic. He does his job a lot, so he knows all the little tricks and how to play people to make sure they trust him. In total, it was giving this character a history and confidence without outwardly stating it.\n\n> **DianaBerry:** It’s nice that you wanted to break off from your typical character type. I think it turned out very well!\n>\n> **3. You mention that your mother passed away last year and we are sorry for your loss. Based on your author post, its obvious she meant a lot to you. Would you say that the character Wallace (the Seal) is inspired by her? If so, what character traits did you draw from your mother in the creation of Wallace?**\n\n**Plague:** Thank you for the condolences. I wouldn't say Wallace was inspired by her; more so, the piece and overall moral of the story were inspired by her. Many of the little memory vignettes are direct events that have happened to me with some more dramatization to oomph them up. The main similarity between her and Wallace is how Lague reacts to advice. I am a bit of a hardhead, and my mom would always point this out to me. We'd argue when I was a teenager, and I'd make my choice, but in the end, she was always right regardless of whether I agreed with her or not. As I grew older, I found myself seeking her advice more and more, so losing her was losing a major guiding force in my life. I worry if I'm able to make the correct decisions without her input or opinion. Having Wallace serve as that figure for Lague lets her be a constant reminder to me and also shows me that she taught me how to make my own decisions and be confident in them.\n\n> **DianaBerry:** My condolences once again, and you’re very strong for being able to well, stay strong during something so difficult. I think that shows in the piece very well, and it’s something many of us can also relate to as readers.\n>\n> **4. Do you wish you had done anything differently in SCP-8000? If you could change anything, what would it be?**\n\n**Plague:** I wish I had more time. I had heard a rumor that the theme would be Infinity, so I concocted an idea with that in mind (the SEEKER machine), but when the Fantasy theme was revealed, I had to toss the story I had in mind. It took me around a week to develop the base idea of an interdimensional seal therapist. The writing process for this one was difficult for me since it was so divergent from what I usually write. I mention this in my author post, but I was extremely unconfident in this article and sent multiple WIP drafts to critiquers to get heat checks. If I had a little more time, I think a few kinks in the story could have been worked out, like the character development of Lague. While I think it's strong, I also think it could be stronger. The main change I want to make and probably will make is extending out the opening dialogue between 8000 and Lague. I cut a lot out for pacing and I didn't have enough time to get as deep into that part as I would have liked since I was so focused on the ending.\n\n> **DianaBerry:** I believe it still comes across as a very strong article, and considering the fact it won I think many people would agree! It’s interesting to know this wasn’t your first idea though!\n>\n> **5. What is your favorite aspect of this article and why?**\n\n**Plague:** I'll give you two. First and more lighthearted, the intervention transcript was so much fun to write. This was part of the original SEEKER machine focused SCP I would have written if the article was Infinity. I wanted to parody Christopher's intervention in The Sopranos, and my god, it was a blast taking characters I've written before along with my friends' author avatars and putting them in this situation. Coming up with unique character voices and jokes and moving the story through that one transcript was a smooth process and is still one of my favorite parts of the article. It was the first thing I wrote for this draft.\n\nI think the emotion I was able to put out with SCP-8000 is what I'm most proud of. Like I said, I had a very hard time writing this article because it's a complete tonal shift from what I normally produce and post. I always have a small sense of nervousness when I post any SCP, as you're depending on a lot of factors for an article to do well, and banking on that after spending days or weeks on a piece is slightly nerve-wracking. I was sick to my stomach as I clicked the save button for SCP-8000. I almost psyched myself out of posting it, but seeing the outpouring of compliments as the days of the contest passed by was so incredibly touching. The number of people who cried, were moved, or felt like they saw themselves in Lague was overwhelming. Every insecurity I had about this piece was dashed as more and more comments told me that this article really meant something to people, enough for them to let it start a series. I always felt like my catalog of entries was never groundbreaking. Yeah, many of my articles can make someone laugh, and they may walk away with a smile on their face, but that ever-lingering feeling of wanting to leave a mark remained a constant insecurity with me and inspired this piece heavily. Being able to prove myself wrong and move people is something I'll cherish.\n\n> **DianaBerry:** Well I think you definitely did prove yourself wrong. Thank you so much for doing this interview! And final thoughts?\n\n**Plague:** Final thoughts: Go birds. Go Phils. That's a great seal. PlaguePJP.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nAnd there you have it!
