At the time of acquisition, the church had been empty and unattended for decades, despite a well-maintained exterior.|link=https://scpsandbox2.wdfiles.com/local--files/amnestic-protocol/church.jpg]]\n**Item #:** SCP-2601\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The locus of SCP-2601 is to be secured to a rectangular steel conveyance assembly using bolts. The assembly must be further encircled by a welded steel cage with gaps wide enough to permit physical contact with the locus. The conveyance assembly is to be located at the center of four specially-constructed long term humanoid containment units numbered A through D. Maintenance access to the conveyance interior is possible only via remote-controlled doors inside the containment chamber.[[footnote]]Controls routed to Control Node 2601 in Site 179, Area 4 (S176/4/CN2601).[[/footnote]]\n  \nThe construction of rooms S176/4/2601/A through S176/4/2601/▒ is largely typical, with the exception of maintenance hatches, a titanium grate aperture to allow voluntary physical contact with SCP-2601, and a circular one-meter aperture in the ceiling for dispensing concrete. Finally, the floors are capable of sliding into the wall and exposing a sheer, concrete-walled pit thirty (30) meters deep.[[footnote]]This presents logistical challenges to plumbing, both for life support and waste removal. For the time being, a portable composting toilet should be provided, along with sufficient drinking water for the duration of the planned experiment.[[/footnote]]  \n\nIn the event of a breach or noncompliance event within the conveyance access chamber, procedure 2601-MALCHIAH[[footnote]]Procedure 2601-MALCHIAH consists of dispensing anesthetic gas into a chamber and withdrawing the floor, and must be performed for 30 seconds prior to opening the external door to a S▒P-2601 containment unit.[[/footnote]] must be performed in all four chambers simultaneously. If this is insufficient to resolve the noncompliance event, procedure 2601-JULIAN[[footnote]]Procedure 2601-JULIAN is a fully automated process consisting of filling the entire SCP-2601 research space, including containment chambers and disposal pits, with concrete. Once initiated, Procedure 2601-JULIAN cannot be stopped.[[/footnote]] must be implemented except by order of the O5 council within ten (10) minutes of the noncompliance event.\n\nD-class personnel selected for testing must not be eligible for the amnestic recycling policy, unless otherwise required by SCP-2601's conveyance maintenance schedule.\n\nTest logs must not be numbered sequentially, and should convey no information about the order or number of tests performed.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2601 is an unstable equilibrium of antimemetic and infocaustic phenomena which combine to form an extremely potent, slow-progressing, biologically bound infophage. The phenomenon is transmitted by --physical contact with-- an object catalogued as SCP-2601-Locus. SCP-2601's locus was retrieved from an American church in 2013, presumably by Foundation personnel, but no records of the object's acquisition have survived.\n\nSCP-2601's first-order effect is comprised of two parts: an antimemetic component, which renders information about the subject unrememberable or imperceptible, and an infocaustic component, which physically deletes information from reality. As such, mnestic treatment is only partially effective in persisting knowledge about SCP-2601 and individuals affected by it.\n\nSCP-2601's second-order effect is similar, but affects all individuals perceiving or attempting to perceive SCP-2601's locus. Information about the locus's appearance, creation, discovery, and durability are impossible to observe or confirm by any means, including indirectly through electronic surveillance or recorded data.[[footnote]]In rare circumstances, data about the locus's nature may be reported by subjects. However, the anomaly's self-censoring effect renders this information illegible regardless of medium.[[/footnote]] Although the second-order effect seems to have the same dual antimemetic and infocaustic components, --it does not in itself progress to full infection by SCP-2601's first order effect.-- \n\nAt first, highly personal information is erased, such as parental relationships, sibling relationships, and fundamental preferences. This is not purely an amnestic effect: with time the information is erased directly from reality, rather than rendering it imperceptible or impossible to remember. As the infection progresses, it radiates outward into the subject's Errol-Klein boundary, erasing the history of events external to the subject's direct influence but causally connected to their actions. Finally, information about the subject's thoughts, identity, and appearance is erased. At this point, the subject is impossible to perceive by any means, and will have ceased to meaningfully exist.\n\nSCP-2601 is thought to only affect living creatures --coming into contact with the Locus of their own volition.-- Exposed individuals may report mental distress and fatigue as a byproduct of their memories being altered. This is immediate and affects written or digitally encoded information as well as human knowledge. There is no known maximum range for this erasure, with core biographical data erasure occurring in family members up to [DATA REDACTED] kilometers away.\n\nIn rare cases, enough data is retained to make useful inferences about an experiment or test subject. Though traditional methods are not effective in tracking research yield, the Wheeler-Ki̴m method[[footnote]]The Wheeler-K̶im method is used to estimate the research yield of experiment protocols when perceptual, infocaustic, or limited retrocausal anomalies are in effect. The calculation uses containment construction costs, researcher staffing expenses, complexity of security clearance architecture, and electrical utilization to infer initial and ongoing costs, and compares that cost to other anomalies with known test patterns to project an expected level of researcher coverage and rate of D-Class consumption. Perceivable or surviving research records are then compared to this projection to estimate rate of loss.[[/footnote]] estimates approximately █% of experiments remain auditable to some extent.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test Log a0a080f42e6f13b3a2df133f073095dd\" hide=\"- Test Log a0a080f42e6f13b3a2df133f073095dd\"]]\n\n> {{**WARNING:** File corrupted.

By forcing entry, ░░ was able to force the system's failsafes to permanently seal it. \n> \n> I don't have to tell you that this isn't acceptable. We have certain expectations here, chief among them that researchers don't make vigilante ethics decisions over the heads of their Site Director and Ethics Committee. \n> \n> In terms of the impact on morale or other researcher following Dr. ░░tr▒▒▒░l░░'s lead, I don't think there is any further action to take. SCP-2601's first-order effect is already eradicating ▒░░ information and knowledge of his subversion from our minds and records: by this time next month, I doubt we'll even remember ▒░ existed. \n> \n> But we also have an obligation to resume regular testing as soon as possible to prevent [DATA EXPUNGED], as well as to have the new testing facilities in place and the Locus recovered before we forget we were looking for it in the first place. To that end, I make the following recommendations: \n> \n> • Ethics Committee to devise updated test plan language to reinforce the necessity of testing without breaching secrecy regarding [DATA EXPUNGED] \n> • Logistics Director Rosso to initiate construction of an identical testing facility using original blueprints. \n> • Site Director Rothfuss to select a new research lead, ideally scoring better than 95th percentile in Foundation loyalty. \n> • Site Director Rothfuss to also reassign Dr. ░░tr▒▒▒░l░░'s other assignments before we forget we need to. \n> • Tactical Lead Reynolds of MTF Theta-90 (\"Angle Grinders\") to provide a shortlist of SCP objects able to facilitate immediate retrieval of SCP-2601-Locus. \n> \n> Gentlemen, we've all got jobs to do.
