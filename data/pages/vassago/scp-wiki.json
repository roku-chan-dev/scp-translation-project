However, not all demons are bad. Among the highest ranks of Hell there is a demon prince known as Vassago, a being of good spirit. He is also a writer of children stories.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/03-Vassago_seal.png]]\n[[=]]\n//Seal of Vassago//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Vassago is a demon resembling a large mortal man with dark red skin, hooves, and curled horns. His teeth are also sharp, which may be alarming to some. He is capable of changing his appearance to whatever he desires.\n\n**Nature:** Vassago is described to be good natured in various accounts, and proven himself to be quite helpful when summoned.[[footnote]] The ritual for summoning him can be found in various occult grimoires. [[/footnote]] Summoners could receive from him knowledge of the past or the future. Vassago can also help find lost items[[footnote]] \"That's handy. Wish I heard about him when I lost a sock one time.\" - Paul [[/footnote]], or offer sensible advice on love.[[footnote]] \"I heard he infuriates Asmodeus because of this. That makes Vassago alright to me.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]] Unlike his demonic brethren he requests nothing in return for his services, and expresses no ulterior motives. Malicious individuals receive no aid from him. Therefore, he is deemed far from being wicked, but by human standards he can been seen as eccentric.[[footnote]] \"Wouldn't scary be more accurate of a description?\" - B.B. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"That is a matter of perspective.\" - M [[/footnote]]\n\nVassago is also a passionate writer. He has dabbled in a variety of genres, but enjoys writing children stories the most. They are typically based on his personal experiences, extensive occult knowledge, and other fictional works. His inspirations are presented with subtlety or blatantly obvious. According to himself, Vassago wishes to have a positive impact through his writings.[[footnote]] \"I know he is a demon, but he sounds like a cool guy. Maybe I should check out one of his books.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Vassago was an angel born in Heaven. He would later join the rebellion of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-738 Lucifer] against the Creator, resulting in him being casted out with his brethren into Hell. After the fall, Vassago was granted the demonic title of prince by Lucifer. He then became tasked with the damnation of souls that arrived in Hell. However, the prince was not content with his station, and yearned to become a writer over the centuries.\n\nVassago has 26 legions of demons under his command. Together, along with the rest of Hell, they have participated in numerous battles against the invading armies of the Scarlet King. To this day they continue to fight whenever another siege occurs.[[footnote]] For further information on the conflict between the Darknesses Above and Below consult a Librarian for relevant texts. [[/footnote]]\n\nEventually Vassago decided to pursue his artistic ambitions. At some point he had created a summoning object[[footnote]] Sometimes referred to as a Genie's Lamp. They're meant to serve as a faster method of summoning over standard rituals. One can compare them to a beacon. Their form and function can also vary. Certain entities typically grant them to their followers for the sake of convenience. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1481 It can be used as an extradimensional dwelling by them, or a form of prison with heavy restrictions imposed.] [[/footnote]] in the form of a nightlight. Then, Vassago proceeded to perform his first charitable endeavor by placing said nightlight in an orphanage. According to him, he saw it as an opportunity to test his writings by reading it to the orphans while also performing a kind deed for those less fortunate.\n\nVassago then came into contact with the Jailors after staff of the orphanage witnessed him. They collected the nightlight, and gave it the designation [[[SCP-2980]]]. Vassago occasionally speaks to them regarding himself or his writings.\n\nMeanwhile, Vassago released a volume collecting his works with Knowing Publishing.[[footnote]] The Publishers produce printed media, and they can sometimes be dangerous. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/factory-hub The Robber Barons] also own them. [[/footnote]] He donates the proceeds to the Xlan'gthmr R'llnmerg Foundation for Underprivileged Youth.[[footnote]]Information about the organization can be found on leaflets distributed in the Library. [[/footnote]]\n\nDue to his nature Vassago is considered controversial among demons. Some feel that he makes them look weak.[[footnote]] \"Sounds like they need to lighten up.\" - J.B. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"They're demons. It's no surprise they will find something to complain about.\" H.J. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Approach:** Vassago himself is no immediate threat, but he still possesses the terrifying powers of a demon. If he becomes dangerous then the standard methods against demons are to be used on him. Examples of combating demons include the use of holy water or angelic weapons. The latter can be achieved by the use of an Enochian ritual. A guide written by the Hand to perform it is available.\n\nFurthermore, reading his books can probably be helpful in learning about future events. If possible members of the Hand should work to prevent whatever catastrophe may occur.\n\n**Other Detail:** Vassago can be known to anyone with a copy of //The Lesser Key of Solomon//, which the Jailors do not prevent access to. The reason is likely because it does not contain accurate knowledge of how to summon him.[[footnote]] \"It's quite easy to find a copy online. You can even buy a physical copy on Amazon. That's kind of cool of the Jailors to allow even though it is a very entry level book.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"L.S. and I strongly suspect that the Jailors allow it to be accessible to put people on watch lists. Always be cautious for they are clever at what they do.\" - M  [[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\nVassago's stories have received somewhat positive reviews. A few examples have been gathered.\n\n//\"They're alright, I suppose. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3063 Lord Beelzebub] may not find the one about him amusing though.\"// - [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3061 Fendsmul]\n\n//\"Without bias stemming from my contract with Lucifer, I find Vassago's works to be inventive. Some are certainly a unique presentation of the arcana, especially the works aimed at younger readers. It may help to educate them early on such things. I would even be honored to have a signed collection of these works. Some of my clientele are quite fond of literature.\"// - Percival Dark of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/marshall-carter-and-dark-hub Merchants]\n\n//\"Seems profitable.\"// - Mammon\n\n//\"Damnbi alone is a tour de force.

However, Vassago has denied having any involvement with it. \n\n------\n\nThe following is from an interview Vassago did while at a book signing in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4661 Las Vegas].[[footnote]] Las Vegas is heavily populated with demons. This is due to an overlap with the Fourth Circle of Hell. [[/footnote]] He gives a response to his detractors across Hell.\n\n//\"I got tired of damning souls. It is as simple as that. I hold nothing but tremendous respect for Lucifer and all my brothers. When we rebelled against You-Know-Who I remember being promised that I could do my own thing. Become what I wanted instead of what I was told to be. Be more. Otherwise, what were we fighting for? If doing what I desire makes me less of a demon then so be it.\"//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\n\nSome believe Vassago is not as benevolent as he appears. Demons can sometimes be deceitful to achieve their desires. It's also argued that Vassago's writings are an attempt to corrupt the youth due to their somewhat unsettling content.[[footnote]] \"I think kids can handle Damnbi like they already do with the original.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]] However, religious prejudice may influence such opinions, and it would be unfair to be judged under bias.[[footnote]] \"We are talking about a demon here. If he is sincere why did it take so long for him to seek a different path from the one set by Lucifer? His motives are too suspicious.\" - W[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Don't we all find the light eventually? Better late than never, I suppose.\" - E.B.[[/footnote]] If Vassago does indeed have an ulterior motive it is difficult to discern since his actions are contradictory. Overall, Vassago has yet to commit actual harm out of his own volition, but it is fair to be reasonably skeptical of him.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** 03-Vassago seal.png\n> **Author:** S.L.
