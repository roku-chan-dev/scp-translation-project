All personnel interested in research with the object must first obtain approval from project head prior to experimentation. Additionally, personnel requests for testing purposes require administrative approval and several rounds of D-Class screening prior to admission.  \n\nAll testing is to be recorded and observed from within Site-76's experimentation chambers. This chamber should be retrofitted with a Faraday mesh and shielded with TO-3 thermal resistance pods that must be inspected daily by members of research staff.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3315 is the designation for a 25 cm black aluminum ice pick with \"p e r s e v e r a n c e\"[[footnote]]It is to note that the white spacing between letters is intentional. [[/footnote]] engraved onto its handle. The object itself is comprised of non-anomalous material, with a handle composed of carbon fiber-reinforced thermoplastic and an aluminum carabiner ring on the blunt end. \n\nSCP-3315 is abnormally cold, registering in at ~193 K (approximately -79.4° C), requiring use of protective equipment when handling. The carabiner ring features a single handwritten note, laminated and attached via plastic zip-tie. Attempts to remove or otherwise alter the components or state of SCP-3315 have failed. \n\nThe note reads as follows:\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"papernote poppin\" style=\"padding-left: 50px !important; padding-right: 50px !important;\"]]\nO wanderer, struck forth on heaven's eye\n\nWhat mysteries of yonder frozen ridges hide?\n\nSteal your fate with the pick on high\n\nWhen you climb to reach perseverance's side\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\nWhen an individual grasps SCP-3315 and lifts it from a surface, they will disappear from all visual and global positioning systems. The subject will then be instananeously translocated to an alternate locality defined as SCP-3315-1. During this period, audio broadcasting reception can still be detected with decent clarity within two kilometers of the point from which SCP-3315 had vanished. \n\nOnce the subject appears within SCP-3315-1, they will be unrecoverable until they expire, whereupon they reemerge alive and unscathed within SCP-3315's original location. During the event, subjects are unable to die of hunger, thirst, or asphyxiation, despite reports of having experienced symptoms of such things. All other forms of termination work without issue. In  addition, subjects are unable to lose SCP-3315, intentionally or otherwise. \n \nSCP-3315-1 is a single mountain range of unknown size, subject to a dense fog that obscures the surrounding area. Topographical expeditions of this locale have yielded inconclusive data, suggesting that SCP-3315-1 is not located on Earth and is randomly or procedurally generated with each instance of its manifestation. However, certain items and features reappear within different manifestations of SCP-3315-1. Research into how SCP-3315 constructs its reality is still under analysis.\n\n**Addendum-3315-A:** Discovery and Recovery Log\n\nSCP-3315 was brought to Foundation attention on 05/11/2002 after the hospitalization of trailer park supervisor Francis ████████, who had claimed to have suffered several \"hallucinogenic episodes\" in which he had found himself with lost time and in an unknown location. ████████ states that he had been cleaning out the unit of a tenant who was presumed dead in a house fire three days prior, when he was transported to SCP-3315-1, perishing rapidly due to hypothermia. After reappearing, he had attempted to return to work several times before admitting himself to a nearby hospital. A Foundation agent stationed as a nurse reported the claims and an official investigation was deployed.\n\n████████'s tenant records were seized and it was determined that the lot in question had belonged to a █████ ██████. It is unknown if this is a real name or not, as no other records of such individual were registered within █████████████ County nor any of the surrounding counties. ████████ was unable to provide any further details about the individual, stating that the tenant was invalid and that he had rarely interacted with the person in question. It should be noted that no remains were discovered among the wreckage of the trailer.\n\nFoundation efforts to properly identify SCP-3315 took place over the next day, during which its anomalous properties came to light. Anomalous Items Recovery Unit 33B (\"Scavengers\") was assigned to the location. Records of their debriefing can be found below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access AIRU-33B Debrief Transcript\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> **AIRU-33B/SCP-3315 Debrief Log 001**\n> \n> //Note: Following is a transcript of AIRU-33B member Agent Mackenzie Driscoll's debrief post-recovery of SCP-3315 to Site-76 Director Mahmoodah Agarwal.//\n> \n> -----\n> \n> = {{<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>}}\n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** Alright, Agent Driscoll, if you would.\n> \n> **Agent Driscoll:** Okay—[clears throat]—Agent Mackenzie Driscoll, Anomalous Items Recovery Division, unit thirty-three-bee, May fifteenth, two-thousand and-\n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** Just—please describe your experience when you were recovering the object. For the record.\n> \n> **Agent Driscoll:** Ah, sorry. We don't really get anything this interesting, usually. Anyway, we were deployed to [REDACTED], some trailer park out there in the pine barrens, and Jacobs—Agent Jacobs—was on the job with me at the time. So, we drove out there and started poking around the burned-up unit. Jacobs was the first to notice something off about the place, I mean it was cold. Like, we stepped into what was left of the trailer and it just felt wrong. Not in a bad way, mind you, but it was weird.\n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** Care to go into more detail?\n> \n> **Agent Driscoll:** Well, I quickly noticed the smell. It was frigid in there, and it smelled like we were outside. Like, I could taste the snow and the mountains instead of smoke and burned plastic. It was refreshing, but we were not dressed for the cold, and everything in the trailer was damp and covered in soot. Jacobs saw the pick after a minute or so, in perfect condition, and he reached for it, barely picked the thing up off the ground before he just up and vanished. The next thirty minutes were a blur. I radioed in that Jacobs had gone missing and I remember that Site Command was in a bit of an argument about whether or not to dispatch a more, uh, trained group before I heard Jacobs yelling from inside the trailer.\n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** And what did you do then?\n> \n> **Agent Driscoll:** I went back inside, of course. Jacobs was young. Not his first roundup, mind you, but this was something different. He was shivering and sobbing, and I just held him until the rest showed up. He kept going on about the cold and the endless snow, babbling like a baby but otherwise unharmed. I'm just glad he was wearing his gloves, because he probably would have lost a few fingers if he wasn't. \n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** Alright. What about the pick?\n>  \n> **Agent Driscoll:** It was just lying there next to him, inanimate. I knew not to touch the damned thing. A little while later more recovery agents showed up, Abernathy and Pierce, and I warned them not to touch it either. They got some tongs and put the pick in a plastic bag, then we brought it onsite.\n> \n> **Director Agarwal:** Thank you, Agent Driscoll. That about covers it.\n> \n> **Agent Driscoll:** No problem, ma'am.\n> \n> = {{<END TRANSCRIPT>}}\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n**Addendum-3315-B:** Exploration Logs for SCP-3315-1.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Exploration Log 3315-1-A\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> **Exploration Log 3315-1-A**\n> \n> **Time:** 11:23 GMT, 09/06/02 \n> \n> **Subject:** D-85748\n> \n> **Supervisors:** Agents Langstaff and Wyatt, switching shifts every 12 hours.\n> \n> **Notes:** Subject was equipped with a two-way earpiece, climbing gear, and an Osprey-52 Variant extreme environment multi-day supply pack.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> = {{<Begin Log>}}\n> \n> //Subject is instructed to activate earpiece and approach SCP-3315.//\n> \n> **Agent Langstaff:** Alright, can you read me?\n> \n> **D-85748:** Yeah.

[groans] Okay. Okay.\n> \n> **Agent Langstaff:** D-85748, are you alright?\n> \n> **D-85748:** Yeah, but I'm stuck. Some snow moved and I-I'm caught underneath. Oh god, you have to do something.

So, I don't know if this is good news for you, but you aren't going to die like this, especially not by thirst.\n> \n> **D-85748:** [exhales slowly] Well that isn't helping me right now.

Radio contact with D-85748 was attempted daily, however, the subject remained uncooperative, leaving his earpiece disabled for most of the time, occasionally activating the headset to goad personnel and reiterate his \"victory\". D-85748 and SCP-3315 are both recovered without hassle.
