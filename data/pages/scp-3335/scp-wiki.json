Compound proved impossible to replicate in Foundation laboratories.]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:[[/span]] Due to the popularity of SCP-3335, it is currently considered uncontained in certain dense population centers of the world.[[footnote]] [[span class=\"bt\"]]THANATOS:[[/span]] The amount of risk this anomaly can produce/is producing is largely dependent on humanity's willingness to interact with it.[[/footnote]] Foundation agents inserted into underground trade markets and international crime syndicates are to monitor the use and distribution of SCP-3335. Clandestine laboratories are to be expunged of all compounds bearing resemblance to the anomalous chemical structures seen via SCP-3335's gas chromatography and mass spectrometry testing.\n\nInformation warfare is currently the most effective deterrent to both usage of SCP-3335 and the discovery of its anomalous properties. Other containment methodologies typically align with the United States' global \"war on drugs\" campaign and thus an undisclosed but significant portion of the Foundation's annual budget is currently dedicated to supporting these efforts.  \n\nAs of 2018, SCP-3335's global trade markets and laboratories have been reduced by approximately 85% from 2003. Despite this, there are assumed to be several operations still producing SCP-3335 to this day. \n\nFoundation interception of large-scale distribution efforts and the eradication of affected individuals are considered top priorities until further notice.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-3335 is an off-white compound similar in appearance to flour. It is a hallucinogenic substance of arylcyclohexylamine structure, with effects similar to other NMDA receptor antagonists, such as those of phencyclidine (PCP) and its derivatives.\n\nAnalysis of SCP-3335 samples have proven to be not useful, many of which have resulted in conflicting or inconclusive outcomes. Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) procured during testing have effectively culminated in various erroneous information. These outcomes imply an inconsistent or nebulous chemical structure. It is unknown how synthesis of the compound is accomplished, and this process is likely anomalous in nature. \n\nSince the time of its surfacing and detection via Foundation operatives, over ~0.5% of the Earth's population have willingly consumed SCP-3335 for recreational purposes.\n\nSCP-3335 exhibits a large array of effects, most of which are common to substances of its kind. These effects include, but are not limited to:\n\n* Euphoria/Sense of serenity\n* Closed and open-eye visual hallucinations\n* Analgesia, numbness\n* Significant change in perception of time (dilation and constriction)\n* Confusion/disorientation, delirium\n* \"Hole\" experiences\n* Intense mind-body dissociation, out-of-body experiences\n* Ambulatory psychotic behavior\n* Paranoia\n* Nausea, vomiting\n* Psychological dependency/addiction, compulsive dosing\n* Frightening, untimely distortion or loss in sensory perception\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\nIn addition to the above, SCP-3335 exhibits previously unrecorded anomalous effects that deviate highly from those of its more explainable analogues, including deficiencies in clotting factors (hemophilia), bone marrow overproduction of red blood cells (polycythemia vera), and compulsive hematophagy of oneself or of others with SCP-3335 still present in the bloodstream, which mimics titration and encourages propagation of the compound. \n\nToxicity reports of affected individuals reveal a consistent low-level blood content of SCP-3335 that does not dissipate nor filter out of the body via metabolization. Dialysis treatments are ineffective in hindering the production of SCP-3335 in the body. It is theorized that SCP-3335 may cause lasting changes in physiology that aid in the endogenous synthesis of the chemical. \n\nDue to the aforementioned difficulty of removing SCP-3335 from the bloodstream to treat affected individuals, widespread use supports theorized potential for large-scale LK-Class Personality Transmutation Events. As such, experimentation and thaumaturgic/clairvoyant use is currently halted, per O5 request.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"jotting transcript\"]]\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]INCIDENT LOG 3335.1:[[/span]] SCP-3335-1 Emergent Event I\n@@ @@\nOn ██/██/████, an unknown portion of civilians in the New York City area that were known users of SCP-3335 became comatose (now designated SCP-3335-1). According to eyewitness reports by other users of SCP-3335, prior to this, victims were seen staring at a \"hole\" in the ground.

After the number of unconscious individuals surpassed ten thousand, the O5 Council held a conference with the Emergent Tactical Threat Response Authority (ETTRA) and Ethics Committee to discuss potential options. Suggestions included adulterating large supplies of SCP-3335 with toxic additives, novel counteragents, and/or analogues with far higher receptor affinity than SCP-3335, all of which failed to pass Council vote due to various logistical concerns. A motion was passed to increase plainclothes Foundation agents deployed to areas of interest, such as known hotspots for illicit activity, entertainment venues, rehabilitation centers reporting higher-than-average rates of SCP-3335 abuse, et cetera.\n\nWidespread amnestic dispersal was considered, should the rate of SCP-3335-1 manifestation fail to decrease. The possibility of an emergency United Nations Security Council summit was also discussed, which would be used to coordinate various international efforts with the wider community. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"pill\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ADDENDUM 3335.1:[[/span]] Civilian Interview Record I\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"⇵ ACCESS INTERVIEW LOG 3335-1A\" hide=\"⇅ COLLAPSE INTERVIEW LOG 3335-1A\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log 3335-1A**\n\n**Interviewee:** Steven ████████, 23\n\n**Interviewer:** Agent █████ Francis, stationed NYPD detective\n\n**Notes:** //This interview was conducted after a Foundation-staged raid of ███████ ████, a popular nightclub in downtown NYC, several days after the events of Incident 3335.1.

He and the guard exchange a glance. The guard points two fingers at his own eyes and then redirects them at the detainee's, who rolls them in response.>//\n\n**████████:** Yeah, yeah. \n\n//<He stretches in the seat as his spine audibly pops and cracks.>//\n\n**████████:** So, what, are you in on this, too? \n\n//<The guard doesn't respond.>//\n\n**████████:** I don't think the 'blue wall of silence' means ya gotta be completely silent all the time, but you do you. \n\n//<Agent Francis returns a short while later with some items from a nearby vending machine, a bag of chips already open.

Maybe this stuff isn't as safe as you might have thought.\n\n**████████:** Fuck if I know, man. I'm not about to fuck anyone over, I'm just trying to get by. Maybe they just OD'd, you know?

Extreme mood swings, visceral reaction to sensory input of any kind, along with overwhelming compulsions to isolate in small and unlit spaces with other SCP-3335-1 instances have been observed. \n\nAffected individuals have shown marked increase of adrenaline and cortisol present in blood testing, as well as a higher blood concentration of SCP-3335. \n\nElectroencephalography (EEG) tests yielded unusual patterns of electrical activity in the brains of SCP-3335-1 instances, similar in effect to those who have undergone partial-to-full corpus callosotomy procedures.[[footnote]] Used as a treatment for drug-resistant, life-threatening epilepsy. Involves severing the corpus callosum, a bundle of approximately 300,000,000 neuronal axons that run the length between cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication and coordination between the two.[[/footnote]] As a result, many subjects develop symptoms similar to, but notably different from, callosal disconnection syndrome, also known as \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain split-brain]\" disorder. \n\nWhen an affected subject appears to have acquired symptoms of callosal disconnection syndrome, hemispheres of their brain will take on attributes of their own and deprive the other hemisphere of existing attributes. This results in separate impulses and perceptions for the left and right halves of an affected instance's body. \n\nUnlike documented cases of callosal disconnection, both hemispheres of SCP-3335-1 instances develop into their own consciousness, one of which may retain some personality traits of the original individual. Retained personalities possessed by SCP-3335-1 will show marked torpor and emotional dampening. Subjects may also experience bouts of catatonia/reduced cognitive function. \n\nThe other hemisphere is occupied by a unique consciousness.[[footnote]] In a vast majority of cases, the affected hemisphere is the same side as the individual's previously dominant hand.[[/footnote]] These personalities are highly erratic and self-destructive, often participating in grievous self-hematophagy to the point of expiration.\n\nDue to the continued existence and function of the corpus callosum within the brains of typical SCP-3335-1 instances, significant \"cross-chatter\" can occur, resulting in some level of neurological competition between hemispheres as they \"fight\" for primary control of various bodily functions. Despite this, neither consciousness appears to be aware of this quality, instead confabulating when pressed for explanation of such behaviors.[[footnote]] Confabulation is the tendency for the human mind to retroactively justify its current state using plausible-sounding yet entirely false information, without intent to deceive, and usually as a means of reconciling discrepancies in internal narrative.[[/footnote]] It is completely possible to inform subjects of the nature of their predicament, and how to identify these effects. Unfortunately, atypical behaviors will always be explained away through confabulation. EEG tests suggest transient epileptic disturbances can occur at the boundaries between these shifts in consciousness, which may result in bouts of sudden but temporary [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6724577/ retrograde and anterograde amnesia.]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"pill\"]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]ADDENDUM 3335.2:[[/span]] Civilian Interview Record II\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"⇵ ACCESS INTERVIEW LOG 3335-1B\" hide=\"⇅ COLLAPSE INTERVIEW LOG 3335-1B\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interview Log 3335-1B**\n\n**Interviewee:** SCP-3335-1, formerly known as ██████ ███████ \n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. █████████ █████, Foundation psychologist\n\n**Note:** //This interview was conducted at the ██████ Valley Hospital in ████, Minnesota.

Other than that, your guess is as good as anyone's. \n\n//<Gamma-7 approaches the apartment's maintenance access door, a battered slab of gray featuring a dull, silver knob.

Investigating quietly, Alpha opens the door to a corroded series of fuse boxes and wiring panels, used to distribute power amongst the individual units of the complex. Most are damaged beyond repair, through neglect; electrical damage and water damage being most obvious, the rest lacking any sign of power leading from the master panel, even if functional.>// \n\n//<The source of the noise is identified as a personal gas generator, dangerously rigged to backfeed into the fuses owned by one apartment of the topmost floor, where an indicator light and the residue of a worn label, which may have been the apartment number, coexisted next to one another.>//\n\n**Bravo:** You smell something toasty? Or am I just havin' a stroke?\n\n**Foxtrot:** I smell it too. Jury's still out on the stroke, though. \n\n//<The team takes a turn leading farther inwards. It passes through an empty laundry room.

The hall is concealed under black curtains of shadow in lieu of light, large and empty, walls alternating from sheetrock, to brick, to gaps between rotting wooden beams and rusted, black-speckled pipes, terminating in darkness. Behind Gamma-7, a set of nondescript double doors stand, the small window on each side obscured completely by further shadows.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/foyer.png]]\n\n**Alpha:** Alright, we've entered the main hallway, but, huh.\n\n**Bravo:** Yo, Charlie, any reason you took us the long way?

One entrance compromised. One exit through maintenance areas. Let's choose a door. Delta, pick one.\n\n**Delta:** This one on the left, I hear voices.\n\n//<Audio feed picks up muffled speaking.

Camera view is obscured while Gamma-7 funnels into the room, although commotion and struggling can be heard, cut short by several suppressed gunshots a few seconds later. View returns, two individuals lying on a broken coffee table. Syringes and wax bags litter the floor.>//\n\n**Alpha:** That ought to do it.\n\n**Bravo:** What the //fuck//, man. No one said they were our targets! We gotta confirm that shit beforehand. \n\n**Alpha:** They've got powder, though.\n\n**Foxtrot:** Nah, see the stamps? That's heroin. And they've got candles. I heard these guys don't like light.\n\n**Echo:** That was a risky move. Don't be an idiot. Why do //you// think we're still TFOs? Shit like this. That's why. If you make me wait another year to re-take MTF certs //again//, I will sneak laxatives into every meal you eat for a year while we wait for the next one. \n\n**Alpha:** I guess I'll just eat out every day for a year, problem solved.\n\n**Echo:** You think that will stop me? I can get fifty part-time jobs. Still less soul-crushing than being stuck in a trap house with you.\n\n**Alpha:** Whew!

At this rate, we'll be spending the holidays here, too.\n\n//<Silence for fifteen seconds as the group navigates back out into the hallway. Checking the next door over, it is determined to be unlocked but barricaded, and cannot be opened. The same result occurs with the next two. Foxtrot goes to check the opposite side but is stopped by Delta.>//\n\n**Delta:** You hear that?\n\n//<Muffled, unintelligible vocalizations can be heard in the distance.>//\n\n**Foxtrot:** It's getting louder.\n\n//<Sound increases in volume over a period of ten seconds. Soon after, a lone figure is seen crashing down the stairs closest to the group. The individual then stands, staggering and swaying before falling again, apparently unable to keep steady for long. Individual is heavily bandaged around the head and arms.>//\n\n**Bravo:** We have someone inbound.\n\n**Foxtrot:** He looks hurt. Or //really// high. Or both.\n\n**Alpha:** What's your name?\n\n//<No response is given, instead, the figure continues to babble and clutch its head in distress. It either cannot or is unwilling to effectively communicate with Gamma-7.>//\n\n**Delta:** What should we do? Look at those bandages. Are you alright?\n\n**Command:** You know our mission parameters. I can't dispatch a medic unless you know they aren't a dash-one.\n\n**Delta:** Don't remind me. Hey buddy, let's see your pupils—\n\n//<Delta shines her flashlight into the instance's eyes, which begin shaking violently the moment the bright torch touches their respective retinas. The instance of SCP-3335-1 loses motor control with a loud thump, falling unconscious and starting to convulse. It then becomes rigid, emitting a groan as the air is forced out of its lungs, capillaries in its face and eyes bursting as the gauze on its head begins to turn red in splotches. The instance assumes [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abnormal_posturing#Decerebrate decerebrate posture], indicative of a severe, soon-to-be-fatal brainstem injury, and its painful warping of form ceases shortly thereafter.>//\n\n**Bravo:** Well, that was something. Never seen one of those up close before. Fuck me.\n\n**Echo:** I don't want to be here. \n\n**Bravo:** You good? \n\n//<Echo nods, though he is pale, arms crossed tightly against his stomach in a defensive stance.>//\n\n**Delta:** Did //I// do that?\n\n**Alpha:** Yeah, there was nothing in the briefings about this. They mentioned photosensitivity—Bit of an understatement if this is what they meant.\n\n**Delta:** Uh. You might want to see this.\n\n**Echo:** What is it?\n\n**Bravo:** Oh god, what the hell.\n\n//<Delta pulls back the bandaging to reveal a set of miscellaneous materials that run in a radial pattern around the individual's head, which is split into several segments along uneven, messy seams. Dried residue suggestive of quick-dry adhesives run their length, as well as a set of inconsistent stitching, supported by the presence of thumbtacks, staples, sewing needles, screws, and broken syringes as an attempt to further secure the pieces in place. The wounds are infected and continue to bleed.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/xiddygriddy.png]]\n\n**Alpha:** Yeah, this guy looks messed up. If I had to guess I'd say he paid for back alley brain surgery, or cracked himself open and tried to put Humpty Dumpty back together using whatever he had laying around the house. Did a shoddy job either way.\n\n**Delta:** These sutures look loose—fuck!\n\n//<The stitching appears to dislodge, the portion of skin and bone falling away, revealing an open hole into its cranial cavity.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Fuck, that's awful. I can see inside his head. \n\n**Foxtrot:** //<stifling a gag>// \n\n**Alpha:** What—\n\n**Bravo:** Where the fuck is his brain? Where the fuck is it?\n\n**Alpha:** No, there's some left.

Let's head up, not looking to hang around too long. I picked the wrong day to eat three slices of pizza before doing fieldwork.  \n\n//<Silence for ten seconds, followed by the crew's echoing footsteps. Something else is heard moving a ways behind Gamma-7, only audible to Delta, who is situated at the tail end of the group. She turns her camera towards the hallway for a few moments. Detecting nothing, she is seen returning to the rest of her team.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/fgure.png]]\n\n//<Gamma-7 approaches the stairwell, ascending to the second floor landing, Bravo at the front. The team can be seen maneuvering around large boxes and furniture that cover the stairs as a poorly-constructed barricade. A few items require relocation further down the stairs, which is accomplished with some effort.>//\n\n//<The second floor is accessed, a narrow hallway compared to the previous, though the residences themselves are likely larger; the maintenance areas from the ground floor are not present and the apartment doors are noticeably farther apart. Bravo throws up a hand sign to his teammates, who immediately stop moving at the command. After a moment, he turns to face the group.>//\n\n**Alpha:** What is it?\n\n**Bravo:** Smell that?\n\n**Echo:** Smells like death. Still hungry, Alf?\n\n**Alpha:** What do you think?\n\n**Delta:** This door up here is ajar.

Bravo, Foxtrot, you come with me. Delta, Echo, check out those two.\n\n**Echo:** You got it.\n\n**Bravo:** Quiet now.\n\n//<Ambient background noise is picked up for the next thirty seconds. Alpha, Bravo, and Foxtrot venture into a hallway and disappear from view. Delta and Echo are seen entering the living space and dining area on the opposite side, determining them both to be empty. Large portions of the furniture and walls have been smashed or torn apart. All light sources have been removed, as well as their fixtures and any wiring which would have connected them to a power source.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/wreck.png]]\n\n**Delta:** Clear over here. Looks like someone tried to redecorate with a sledgehammer.\n\n**Echo:** Same. \n\n**Alpha:** Okay. Foxtrot, check the bedroom. Bravo, cover the bathroom.\n\n**Bravo:** Got it.\n\n**Foxtrot:** We got bodies in here, yo.\n\n//<The camera feed confirms this claim as Echo and Delta rejoin Alpha and Foxtrot in the master bedroom; a number of individuals are seen laying across the moldy floor and against the unkempt bed. Half-melted ice is hastily piled on and around the bodies.>//\n\n**Alpha:** More dash-ones. Are they dead?\n\n**Foxtrot:** No bandages on the heads. Wrists though...\n \n**Bravo:** Bathroom is clear, albeit disgusting. Mirror is smashed through. \n\n**Foxtrot:** //<holding a palm over the mouth and nose of one of the bodies nearest to him, then checking for a pulse>// Still alive. Skin's cold. Shallow breathing. Bradycardia. Probably from the ice, which means they're likely comatose—\n\n//<Bravo enters the room, shining his flashlight in the direction of Foxtrot. The beam illuminates the still faces of two instances of SCP-3335-1, who immediately awaken, eyes in rapid nystagmus for a moment. Another moment passes, and both pairs are fixed on Foxtrot. Bravo panics and attempts to disable his flashlight, fumbling and dropping the object, causing further commotion. A scream is heard, followed by a sharp whine emanating from Foxtrot's microphone.>//\n\n**Foxtrot:** //Bravo! You son of a—//\n\n**Alpha:** Get out of the way!\n\n**Bravo:** Shit—!\n\n**Foxtrot:** Fuck—get em off me, agh!\n\n//<Affected individuals are heard vocalizing in near-harmony, deviating only to express extreme emotion with no cohesive pattern or inciting cause. One appears to be attempting to pull its own arm off of Foxtrot, but fails to do so. The agent's pleas for help are drowned out by a gurgling sound. Alpha is heard firing rounds into the figures, although they do not seem deterred.>//\n\n**SCP-3335-1:** //<in approximate unison>// Flesh cleaved in two. Two. Mind cleaved to one. One. Help. Help. //Help.// //Help!// Let us out!\n\n//<Coughing and sputtering is heard. Delta and Echo rush into the room, camera revealing Foxtrot underneath two SCP-3335-1 instances, who are pinning him down. Both have the same extensive bandaging, though they begin to gnaw at their own wrists with coordination and purpose. Foxtrot thrashes harder but remains immobilized.>//\n\n**Bravo:** Jesus fuck! \n\n**Foxtrot:** //<choking and gasping>//\n\n**Delta:** What the hell are they doing—?\n\n**Foxtrot:** //<wet coughing>//—Shoot! Shoot them!\n\n//<Struggle, more gunfire, then quiet. Foxtrot is heard panting and coughing.>//\n\n**Bravo:** You alright?\n\n**Foxtrot:** No, I'm not fucking alright! Did you see that?! Oh g-god—//<vomits>//\n\n**Command:** What happened? I could barely see your feed. \n\n**Alpha:** Drugheads, came to life without warning. They were all over Foxy here. Damn things were bleeding everywhere. They pinned him down. \n\n**Foxtrot:** //<gagging>// I-It bled into my m-mouth.\n\n**Alpha:** What?\n\n//<Alpha turns his light towards Foxtrot's face to see him ejecting more red-tinged slurry. He coughs and gags further before answering.>// \n\n**Foxtrot:** The fucking thing wrung out its wrists into my mouth! Fuck— \n\n//<Bandages on the attackers' arms are torn away, blood flowing freely out of deep lacerations on the wrists. Fresh scratches are seen on the arm from its other hand, which has skin and blood under its fingernails.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Oh, that's vile. //<pauses>// How come these guys could talk and move like that?  \n\n**Delta:** More questions. None of which I want answers to.\n\n**Alpha:** Charlie, you need to report that Foxtrot may have had contact with the chemical agent in question. Likelihood of contamination unknown. \n\n**Command:** //<pauses>// U-Understood. Suggesting evac for Foxtrot, followed by standard decontamination procedures for the rest of you. I'll make a case for Foxy but we all know what they said about exposure.\n\n//<The room is silent for a moment.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Good plan, Charlie. Let's regroup—\n\n//<A large commotion is heard from the stairwell, along with sounds of structural collapse. Alpha steps back into the hall briefly to see the boxes and furniture replaced by a cloud of dust. When the particles settle, it becomes clear that the decrepit stairs have collapsed.>//\n\n**Command:** Everything okay in there? Seismic sensors just blipped. \n\n**Alpha:** Yeah, the stairwell ate it, though. At least we got another. \n\n**Command:** Yep, opposite end of the building, as you know. I've sent some [[[SCP-3315|recovery agents]]] in to ensure a clear route for extraction. Ah—//<pauses>// Okay. Agent [IDENTITY REMOVED] says there's a bunch of garbage and furniture in the other stairwell, but it is intact. They're working on clearing it out as we speak. \n\n**Alpha:** Yeesh. Alright. Maybe we could get to the roof? Some of the nearby buildings looked close enough, but I wouldn't bank on the fire escape being up to code.\n\n**Foxtrot:** Either way, I don't want to just sit around, waiting to turn.\n\n**Alpha:** //If// you turn. You're not the lightweight of the group, right? //<indicates to the teammate on his left>//\n \n**Echo:** What's //that// supposed to mean?\n\n**Alpha:** Not surprised you don't remember. Though, I'm sure housekeeping remembered having to remodel our hotel bathroom.\n\n**Echo:** It was //one// party. I had skipped lunch...and breakfast.\n\n**Command:** You're cleared to continue if you so choose. Be safe and sober out there.\n\n**Foxtrot:** //<chuckles>// Yeah. Right. I'm okay, I'm okay. Let's keep going.\n\n**Alpha:** Alright, Charlie. We're gonna continue for now. Keep us posted about egress.\n\n**Command:** You got it. Talk to you soon.\n\n**Alpha:** //<pulling Foxtrot to his feet>// Can't stop a Watchman.\n\n**Bravo:** Damn fucking straight.\n\n//<Gamma-7 moves out into the hallway once more, inspecting the remaining doors on their current floor and revealing them all to be empty, and in similar states of disrepair. Echo notes a pleasant greeting of 'Hello :)' spray-painted on one of the doors.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/room.png]]\n\n**Echo:** I guess someone's got a sense of humor. Or maybe they really //are// that friendly. \n\n**Alpha:** Don't know which I hate more.\n\n//<Nearing the last functioning set of stairs, the team finds a spacious yet cramped domicile unlocked, possessing signs of more recent activity; dozens of boxes of varying contents, primarily medical and surgical supplies, fill much of the apartment's floorspace. Ledgers of messy handwriting litter the kitchen table, along with diagrams of the human brain, scored with various marks and denotations.>//\n\n**Foxtrot:** They're surgery notes, for removing a part of the brain. And... //<pauses>// And modifying the nervous system to let one hemisphere take advantage of this criss-crossy thing here.\n\n//<The agent indicates to a diagram explaining how one hemisphere of the brain is responsible for motor control functions for the opposite half of the body. A series of tightly-bound nerve fibres form a rough chiasm across the brainstem.>//\n\n**Bravo:** I'm no neurosurgeon, but doesn't operating on a brain require like... extreme accuracy and a completely sterile workspace? I don't think we can even reconnect a brain in the //right// way once it's severed.\n\n**Echo:** Yeah, this is way outside of our collective understanding of neuroscience. There might be something worth something to the lab coats in here, or it could all be anomalous parlor tricks.\n \n**Alpha:** Amateur science project? //<looking at the notes>// Or the key to unlocking the secrets of the human mind? Who knows. I'll grab 'em anyway, why not. //<glancing at each page as he begins stowing them in his bag>// Some of this stuff has to be made up, //<pauses>// 'Basal ganglia'? I'm pretty sure if I showed you my basal ganglia, I'd get reported to HR. \n\n**Echo:** I'm gonna ignore that. \n\n**Alpha:** //<inspecting a document with hand drawn diagrams and notes, on the topic of rewiring \"foreign\" neurons and synapses together>// Gah, I can't even read this chicken scratch. My kid could've done better than this.\n\n//<The rest of Gamma-7 looks over at him.>//\n\n**Alpha:** What? Oh. Goddamn it.\n\n**Bravo:** You have a child?\n\n**Alpha:** What, did I not tell you? It doesn't matter anyway, it was a slip of the tongue.\n\n**Delta:** //Huh?//\n\n**Alpha:** I don't mix work and personal life. Not in this profession. \n\n**Echo:** I tell you guys everything. All my dirty little secrets. \n \n**Alpha:** You //do//? What a boring life. \n\n**Bravo:** Yowch.\n\n**Alpha:** Hey, whatever mistakes I make in my spare time, and the unfortunate consequences of those mistakes, are noneya. What are we gonna do next, exchange photos of our pets on their birthdays? Have an office sweater party?\n\n**Foxtrot:** Don't knock it until you try it. You'll never know if you never find out.\n\n//<The team goes quiet. Gamma-7 makes their way to the master bedroom, spotting two individuals occupying the center of the room. One is hanging from a noose made of electrical wires tied into knots, fed through a hole in the ceiling, which is secured around a wooden support beam. Its eyes are bulging and bloodshot.>//\n\n**Bravo:** Poor bastard.\n\n//<Another lies on the bed, which is saturated with blood, with layers of rust-colored stains partially hidden beneath bright red that glistened faintly, still wet. On the nightstands, used surgical equipment is piled in a heap. This SCP-3335-1 instance is alive, but just barely; it breathes shallowly, skin blue, possessing the head bandages of other recently-observed brain surgeries and the level of craftsmanship expected. However, something may have gone awry during the procedure; this SCP-3335-1 possesses a hastily-performed tracheostomy. A small, plastic tube extends from an incision in its neck, allowing it to breathe while the nose and mouth may have been unable to provide clear route. A number of empty bottles next to the limp body and its red-tinged lips suggest an inability to multitask.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Damn. At least this will be easy. Keep your distance, though.\n\n//<After termination, Gamma-7 proceeds out again to the front stairway, which appears to have been remodeled sometime in recent decades. Lights moving through the detritus downstairs confirm the presence of the recovery agents, whose team are waiting on chains and a hoist to dislodge a large safe blocking the first floor path. The group decides to continue progressing onto the top level.>//\n\n**Bravo:** I think I know where the smell is coming from.\n\n//<The third floor landing comes into view, which is of similar layout to the second on first glance, with the added remains of several individuals piled in the far corner. All appear to have undergone the same head trauma, with varying degrees of repair. Flies can be seen swarming around the bodies, a writhing mass of maggots infesting the cranial cavity of one unlucky cadaver. Foxtrot is heard vomiting off camera.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Sensitive stomach there, Foxman?\n\n**Foxtrot:** Can't help it, all I can taste is copper, rot, and half-digested pizza.\n\n**Alpha:** Point taken.\n\n**Bravo:** Here— have some water.\n\n**Echo:** —//Agh!//\n\n//<Camera wheels around to show Echo staring back down the stairwell. Delta walks back and aims the camera downward into the space.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/stareway.png]]\n\n**Delta:** What? What was it?\n\n**Echo:** Someone was behind us. \n\n**Alpha:** Alright, stay alert. Bravo, go ahead and check the second floor for any signs we're being followed. Don't venture off too far. Terminate first, ask questions later. None of this moralistic bullshit; as far as I am concerned, it's kill or be killed from here on out. The rest of you, let's start trying doors.\n\n**Bravo:** Alright.\n\n//<The agents are seen attempting to access the apartments, most of which are barricaded or otherwise blocked from the inside. Gamma-7 continues on, Bravo rejoining a moment later.>//\n\n**Bravo:** Stairwell clear. Must have run off. \n\n**Alpha:** Alright no problem, let's try this one—\n\n//<A scream is heard coming from the far end of the hall, followed by some dampened vocalizations.>//\n\n**Alpha:** New plan. Let's go.\n\n//<The team silently makes their way to the door, which is locked.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Echo, get this lock here.\n\n**Echo:** Mhm.\n\n//<After a moment, Echo bypasses the lock and pushes the door open.>//\n\n**Echo:** Oh my god.\n\n//<Camera comes into the view of the doorway, revealing the floor to be littered with SCP-3335-1 instances, at least twenty. All appear unconscious or dead. Blood coats the ground. In the corner, two individuals are hooked up to intravenous lines, seemingly used to siphon blood into buckets. Makeshift chemistry equipment and paraphernalia are noted, along with large containers of powder assumed to be SCP-3335, coolers, ice machines, and shipping materials.>//\n\n//<Echo places an index finger against his lips as he steps into the room, carefully navigating around the bodies as the rest follow suit. He pauses as soon as his head is able to look around the corner into the kitchen and, subsequently, notice the open hole into the next unit; one wall of the domicile is torn down, originally separating itself from the barricaded apartment next door.>//\n\n**Echo:** Bodies just keep going into the other unit. I guess this is where everyone went. Wonder if more of the units are like this. \n\n**Alpha:** //<hushed>// The hell is this, some sort of hive…?\n\n**Bravo:** It looks more like a two-in-one chemlab and trafficking depot.\n\n**Echo:** They're extracting the stuff using… communal blood buckets.\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/bucket.png]]\n\n**Delta:** God, that's fucking nasty. I vote we torch this whole complex and get the hell out of dodge, I want to go back and take a shower.  \n\n**Alpha:** That's starting to sound like the only sensible idea. Let's finish up, I don't think there is much more to learn here, but we need to know for sure before we demolish the place. Some rooms up here. \n\n**Bravo:** —Also, this might not be the best time to point this out, but is that smoky smell getting worse?\n\n**Alpha:** No, you're right. And it doesn't smell the same. It's... more //acrid//.\n\n//<Sounds of movement are heard coming from another room in the apartment. Alpha gestures towards it, he and Delta slowly making their way around the bodies and through the kitchen, where more chemistry equipment is set up, their apparent purpose is reducing blood into paste, then subsequently into powder. A few test batches are seen strewn about the countertops.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/chemistry.png]]\n\n**Delta:** Tweaking the formula?\n\n//<Once through, the two head into the bedroom. Alpha is seen crossing the threshold and disappearing out of view. The camera reveals a single instance of SCP-3335-1 convulsing on the floor.>//\n\n**Alpha:** //<sighs>// Alright. //<whispering>// Let's douse this place.\n\n//<Bravo produces a small container of accelerant from his pack. He starts to pour it on the floor but stops when a lone figure steps slowly out from the shadows. The rest of the group raises their weapons at the stranger, who raises his hands in response.>//[[footnote]]Now designated **POI-3335**.[[/footnote]]\n\n**POI-3335:** Easy now. I really suggest you reconsider your course of action.\n\n**Alpha:** Identify yourself.\n\n**POI-3335:** If you shoot, you will be responsible for the death of everyone on your team, and dozens of lives laying peacefully around us. Pursue your other options, for a new world awaits all of us, and it is approaching quickly. If you lay down your weapons now, you can avoid your planned obsolescence. \n\n**Alpha:** You're in no position to threaten us. Explain yourself. What have you done to these people? How—?\n\n**POI-3335:** I did nothing, and I am not threatening you. I am only a middleman in this transaction, a mere messenger of the danger you are in. Your window is closing.\n\n//<The figure steps towards the group, keeping his hands raised as Alpha trains his sights on the man's face, causing him to lift them higher.>//\n\nPlease, listen to me! You are surrounded by containers for one of two products, or one half of one supply. They also chose to be here. It is their //duty//. To their community. Do you know your duty?\n\n//<Gamma-7 does not react, unsure of how to gauge POI-3335's demeanor. When he speaks again, he reasserts his question with incommensurate anger which does not aid in their assessment.>//\n\n**POI-3335:** //Well?!//\n\n**Delta:** We have to stop your operation. This is... too much. \n\n**Bravo:** It's fucked up, is what it is!\n\n**POI-3335:** You are mistaken. Our methods scare you, understandably, because they are unrecognizable. But they are voluntary, and necessary. \n\n**Echo:** Bullshit. Foxy didn't volunteer for this. They pinned him down! They //bled into his mouth!//\n\n**POI-3335:** //<looking to Foxtrot, smiling, hands lowering slowly as he approaches>// Ah, right. I knew it was you. I //smelled// it in your bloodstream. Paradise is being writ to the inside of your skull. Others will not see it until your mind is twisted back to reflect upon the limitations of Form, and the worlds within.\n\n//<Foxtrot gives a respectful nod, dropping his gun and pulling off his dark toque. His once-bushy hair is now shaven, replaced by a circular pre-operative guide marking drawn in a dashed line around the side of the agent's head. He kneels proudly. Alpha lowers his firearm, keeping it pointed in POI-3335's direction.>//\n\n**Foxtrot:** I did it. I brought them. Get me out. \n\n**Delta:** //<panicked>// What? What are you talking about?! We saw you nearly choke to death, y-you didn't, you //couldn't// have wanted that!\n\n**POI-3335:** Of course not, who would? An unfortunate occurrence. //<to Foxtrot>// It wasn't your fault, remember. Your 'friend' was cavalier with his flashlight and you paid the price. But you will get used to the taste, I just wish it was on your terms. //<to Delta>// Foxtrot—or Randall, as I know him—and I have a preexisting relationship. He wanted a ticket to the Migration, and, to his credit, knew exactly what he needed to do to get there. //<to Foxtrot, caressing his forehead>// You did exceptionally. \n\nThe rest of you should have stayed away. But of course you couldn't. //<pauses, sighing wearily>// You all have yet to realize that you cannot turn back from here. That there are no retakes. These days mark the end the Foundation's edema within the Flesh. I'm sorry it has to be this way.\n\nYour employers trample on a plan far larger than you know, right as it closes in on them, on you. And interfering with a global trafficking operation run by clairvoyants is bad for your health. Isn't that right, [IDENTITY REMOVED]?\n\n**Alpha:** //<eyes widening>// The //fuck// did you just call me?\n\n**POI-3335:** Your name. Well, one of them. We know a great deal about you.\n\n//<Delta, Bravo, and Echo all turn to look at Alpha, who does not acknowledge their glances, raising his weapon again. His eyes are wide and filled with a mixture of fear and anger. After a moment, a Foundation-issue handheld transceiver on the kitchen counter crackles, along with Gamma-7's comms.>//\n\n**Command:** Hey, what's up guys, sorry about the delay, needed to take a piss and couldn't find a bathroom, what's going on//—oh holy shit—<rustling as the headset is displaced from Command's head and deposited some distance away.>//[[size 75%]]—fuck fuck fuck, where's the goddamn situation manual!—oh-//<the sound of tires swerving on asphalt, followed by a loud crash>//—//Ugh//… fuck, agh, my head, ow—oh, hi, sorry!

I gotta go. //<communication ends>//[[/size]]\n\n**POI-3335:** //Ahem//. We know so very much about //all// of you. None of you are free from criticism.\n\n**Bravo:** Do we have to take him in alive? I'm beginning to lose patience with this guy.\n\n**POI-3335:**  //Ah//, yes. Of course you //would// be the one to do so. You've lost your patience with so many people. Did they all deserve it? You tell me... or maybe you don't have to. Maybe they're already here. //<POI-3335 glances amongst the bodies on the tile and carpet>// \n\n**Bravo:** Fuck you.\n\n**Delta:** Stop! Don't let him get under your skin.\n\n**POI-3335:** Oh, ever the realist, aren't you? Always pragmatic. Do you remember why you joined the Foundation, hm? That bright future, thrown away for chemical bliss and long-sleeve shirts to hide the track marks. Do your teammates know? Perhaps the irony of your assignment would not be lost on them. \n\n//<Delta goes silent.>//\n\n**Echo:** //<to Delta>// I thought you transferred in after university... right?\n\n//<Her teammate doesn't respond, camera view shaking lightly in response to the line of questioning.>//\n\n**Alpha:** Get to your point.\n\n**POI-3335:** Of course. Your judgement is built on hypocrisy, your careers built on lies told to drown out the pain of your mistakes.\n\nMeanwhile, there are buildings like these right under your noses, all over the world. You and your kin look down on these places and the people within with pity and disgust, you demonize us as criminals and write us off as lost. We embrace each other, give opportunity to prove one's worth. //<pointing at the bodies nearby>//. These people have //purpose//! The folks on the ground around you, they work tirelessly to realize our collective vision. They're //searching//. Even as we speak. Collecting data. Building mental dossiers. Compiling lists. Learning names. \n\nAnd yet, none of these minds will ever see Paradise. They do this for those that will, fully aware of their position. They have given their lives to their other halves. It is their duty.\n\n**Alpha:** Your paradise and mine are not the same. And what of these people after they have served their purpose, then? You abandon them. \n\n**POI-3335:** We do not abandon anyone. They disembark by choice. See for yourself. If you must. \n\n//<POI-3335 indicates to a large pantry to Alpha's right. The remainder of the team keeps their weapons pointed at the figure, while Alpha very cautiously approaches the doors. Delta eases her way over as Alpha pulls the bifold doors in opposite directions, revealing its contents with a fearful, manic confusion.>//\n\n**Delta:** More questions.\n\n**Alpha:** Ones I no longer want to know the answers to. \n\n//<Camera trains downward on a dark, square hole cut into the floor, descending into darkness, the glow of hazy, sick-smelling smoke drifts upwards, approximately two stories above where the foyer would be. Alpha reels.>//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-3335/shute.png]]\n\n**POI-3335:** Quick, effective. Not everything in this world is pretty, but mercy //can// be beautiful.\n\n**Alpha:** That's putrid. What the hell is this?\n\n**POI-3335:** Disposal. Chemical synthesis produces waste materials, byproducts, excess reagents... and yet. What's still harder to dispose of than toxic carcinogens?  \n\n**Delta:** You... You mean— \n\n**POI-3335:** I don't choose for them. They prefer to slough off their flesh over living in the status quo you seek to maintain. They happily do so, as it is their duty. And Randall has given up his vessel to be my next avatar, in time.   \n\n//<Echo leaves the room upon learning this information, visibly unwell. Bravo simply stares at the the wall in front of him, jaw clenched with indignant anger.>// \n\n**Alpha:** Who are you, //really?//\n\n//<The POI-3335 does not respond.>// \n\n**Alpha:** Answer the question.\n\n**Alpha:** //Who are you?//\n\n**POI-3335:** I'm the herald.\n\n**Alpha:** The Harold? Is that your name?\n\n//<POI-3335 laughs, then groans as if in pain, clutching its abdomen.>//\n\n**POI-3335:** The herald. With an //e//.\n\n**Alpha:** The herald of what?\n\n//<POI-3335's expression is unclear.>// \n\n**POI-3335:** //I// am herald of the Source. Of two in one. Cognitive dissonance in bisected planes. I oversee, I guide, and I prepare.  \n\nI bring messages of hope and bifurcated gifts and relief from the pain of this world. I am herald of a new mode of existence. I birth wasted matter from cages of bone, I sing them lullabies to quell their aching neurons. My name is Sicadîn. Ixtab. Charon. Muut. Anubis. \n\nTarakeshwara. Xolotl. \n\nHerald to the Source.\n\nI am home to those that sleep standing up, to the living dead. I deliver them to worlds of Paradise. You can join us too if you so desire. But you have to make the choice.\n\n**Alpha:** What choice?\n\n**POI-3335:** The process is perfect. Minds are not. You have receded, specialized, commodified. The world needs not realms of exclusivity. It needs not gated pathways to higher states of Man. It needs open roads that lead to everywhere, where all those places lead as well. Opportunity to spread outward infinitely, a ripple through a cosmic ocean of our own design.\n\nAnd yet, you've grown fat on the secretions of divide. Your absence of pain has become worth its displacement and not its shared burden. But pain is inevitable. Weakness is a choice. So, your choice is whether or not you are weak. Paradise is open to all, should they seek it. \n\nAre you willing to give up your most precious gifts to get there? You will miss them, but they will be with you always, in partition.  \n\n**Alpha:** And, what, to you, are my most precious gifts?\n\n**POI-3335:** Not to me, to all. If I give you a choice to live one of two transections of existence, which would you choose? Knowing the face of your daughter or being able to speak her name? Knowing how you felt about her or knowing exactly how old she was when she was taken from you? \n\n**Alpha:** Sick trick trying to get me emotionally invested.\n\n**POI-3335:** To sacrifice these things is the most selfless of acts. To hold on to the pain of your loss just to keep her alive is selfish. She can only exist in Paradise. In here. //<entity points to its own temple>// \n\n**Alpha:** Here's what I think. \n\n//<Alpha fires a shot into POI-3335's head, which pierces its target and does not exit the opposite side. The entity falls roughly onto the tiles, groaning loudly as the remaining life fades from its body. Foxtrot stares at the fresh corpse in shock, which enables the second shot from Alpha's gun to easily contact the back of his neck, killing him instantly.>// \n\n**Alpha:** Typical Sarkic charlatans. I know a grift when I see one. Alright. Bravo, finish dousing this place and light it up. I'll deal with the paperwork.\n\n**Bravo:** You got it. Everyone good?\n\n//<None of the present agents reply, but move to the door in unison. Bravo pours the rest of the accelerant in a line towards the door as he backs out, lighting a match.>//\n\n**Bravo:** Burn in hell.\n\n**Alpha:** Outbound. Let's go, I could use a cigarette and a hose down.\n\n//<Tossing the match, Bravo turns and leaves as the fire starts to spread. Gamma-7's egress was largely uneventful and has been redacted from this document for brevity. The remaining members of Gamma-7 returned onsite without incident.>//\n@@ @@\n= //<END LOG>//\n[[/div]]\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]INCIDENT LOG 3335.4:[[/span]] Situational Update\n[[div class=\"jotting transcript\"]]\nIn the week following the events of this mission, all members of TFO Gamma-7 were found dead in their places of residence.

Upon termination of SCP-3335-1, autopsies confirm the removal of one side of the brain (hemispherectomy).\n\nIn addition, several unidentified hemispheres were recovered from the building, having been removed and carefully reconnected to one another in chains using an unknown but highly sophisticated procedure. Nerve endings in the brainstem were found to have been \"rewired\" to those of the others.\n\nOne RFID-enabled cerebral implant was approved for use in interpolating data from the structure. 392 ms after activation of the implant, the structure underwent a complete cessation of brain activity. A series of images and garbled tones were constructed from the data received, which can be found below. \n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop nohide=1\n| show=ACCESS RECOVERED DATA?\n| hide=GRANTED\n]]\n[[=]]\n[[html]]\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/927220186?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=5847 pi ld9\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write\" title=\"MIGRATION_SEQUENCE\"></iframe>\n[[/html]]\n[[/=]]\nThe exact meaning of the above media, if such exists, remains unknown.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3334]]] | SCP-3335 | [[[SCP-3336]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** thn.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** vary.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** keyter.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** pop.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** tfo7lgold.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** pharmaco.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n> **Filename:** xiddygriddy.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** bucket.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** \n=====\n> **Filename:** mind.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** Hervé Germain\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/48399802@N03/51351047062\n===== \n> **Filename:** chemistry.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:** Chemistry Equipment\n> **Author:** Peretz Partensky\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/68877611@N00/7360175752\n===== \n> **Filename:** fgure.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** foyer.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** hallway.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** incursion.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** room.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:**\n===== \n> **Filename:** shute.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** [tba]\n===== \n> **Filename:** wreck.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** [tba]\n=====\n> **Filename:** stareway.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** [tba]\n===== \n> **Filename:** storage.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** [tba]\n=====\n> **Filename:** sd.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:** high disparity tunnel\n> **Author:** Matanya\n> **License:** CC-BY 2 \n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Flickr_-_jimf0390_-_JimF_04-24-10-0041a_high_disparity_tunnel.jpg\n=====\n> **Filename:** falling.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Billith]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:**\n> -----\n> **Name:**\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** \n> **Source Link:** [tba]\n===== \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n@@ @@\n[[include more-by:billith]]",
