From the storybook world of Sloth's Pit to the cyberpunk hellhole of Eurtec, the people wanted one thing above all else: to visit those living and breathing monuments that acted as testaments to a world they were barred from seeing for so long. _\n _\nThe issue of how to get them there arose almost immediately. Portals are unstable, dangerous, and require an active thaumaturge to open them every time someone wants to go through, and with the GOC's newly-established arcanist license, that's no easy task. The same can be said about Ways, Doors, and other secret passages. The question therefore still stood: how do you get people in and out of the highest-interest objects in the world, efficiently and en-masse? _\n _\nThe Nexus HyperLine stands to answer that problem, for the select few that will be able to afford the luxury it offers. Tapping into the incredibly promising market of inter-Nexus transportation, N7S2M/ER9C3/X56ID will offer a rare, sought-after, and exclusive service that will not only be a permanent source of income, but will also be a //stable// one. With no other competing projects on the market of this nature, our own HyperLine will prove itself to be a consistent and safe way to establish MC&D's importance among the wealthy elite in the new, Veil-less world. _\n _\nMost importantly, however, this project will not cost MC&D untold trillions. Going off a strict legal definition of its contract terms, Dark Real Estate is still the owner of the land it has sold throughout the world to numerous middle-class people in the year since the Veil has collapsed. It also so happens that the land through which the HyperLine would be constructed is already owned in 35% by Dark Real Estate. Therefore, acquiring the land necessary for the project will be significantly easier, as long as the Company is able to present a legal case allowing it to evict the current residents -- which, once more, as per contract terms, it //is//. With MC&D's purchase priority, it's simply a matter of a few billion dollars, and construction could begin right away.||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| N7S2M/ER9C3/X56ID ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n\n@@ @@\n\n||||||~ Project Timeline||\n||~ Date ||~ Event||\n|| 26/12/2022 || HyperLine draft is finished by Skitter Marshall and Robert Carter, and is forwarded to appropriate MC&D Departments. Relevant 3D presentations are shown to all potential investors. Legal paperwork is being prepared, as are the finalized blueprints for the tunnels which the HyperLine will traverse. ||\n|| 29/12/2022 || All necessary users of Dark Real Estate land are evicted, and MC&D's Engineering Department immediately begins work. The foundations of the N7S2M/ER9C3/X56ID highway are constructed within 24 hours via utilization of thaumaturgy, geomancy, and reality-bending. ||\n|| 30/12/2022 || In order to ensure that Iris Dark's vacation is not interrupted by N7S2M/ER9C3/X56ID work and news, she is blacklisted from viewing the file within the Company database and being emailed about the project. Skitter Marshall and Robert Carter are declared the only Project Leads. Work continues uninterrupted. ||\n|| 02/01/2023 || As news about the evictions and the general HyperLine project hit the news, protests emerge in most affected areas. The International Court for the Paranormal takes interest in the case; however, as appropriate legal contracts are cited, the Company's actions are deemed to be fully legal. As the only protesting are individuals that are not members of MC&D's wealthy clientele, security takes care of the protesters, and construction continues without further problems. ||\n|| 05/01/2023 || Parts of the arcane community continue their protests. Citizens of numerous Nexuses and Free Ports -- including Arcadia, Esterberg, and Three Portlands -- officially condemn the HyperLine project, declaring MC&D's actions as immoral. Despite this, following the removal of protesters via the usual methods, construction continues. ||\n|| 09/01/2023 || A series of thaumic charges are detonated at several construction sites. The only damage suffered as a result of the explosions is to HyperLine components. No casualties are noted. Investigation into the offending parties is launched. Construction continues, albeit at a slowed-down rate, now focused on repairing the damage done and protecting the construction sites from further incidents. ||\n|| 12/01/2023 || Once HyperLine construction begins in the waters of the oceans, numerous Finfolk groups begin to join the protests. Throughout the almost-finalized tunnels, further acts of vandalism occur, which effectively result in the tunnels being flooded. A search for responsible parties is ongoing. Re-construction is immediately undertaken. Construction continues, but is significantly slower. ||\n|| 17/01/2023 || The first HyperLine highway -- connecting Germany's Eurtec and Sudan's [[[scp-7372|Silverspire]]] -- is officially opened. Two hours before the first train can be sent along it, however, it is conceptually removed from reality. Later the same day, a rogue ontokinetic ecoterrorist group comes forward, claiming responsibility for the action. All of its members are quickly arrested. Full re-creation of the destroyed line is required. ||\n|| 25/01/2023 || Legal troubles in International Court for the Paranormal continue as a new party becomes active. [[[scp-6987|Goldbaker-Reinz]]], the insurer of a large portion of those affected by the initial evictions, pays the money the occasion necessitates, allowing the now-unified victims to file a group lawsuit. The group claims it possesses evidence that points to MC&D's actions breaking several aspects of the Court's law. Construction is halted. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##8c14c8|robertcarterprivate@mcd_internal.int##\n**From:** ##8c14c8|skittermarshallprivate@mcd_internal.int##\n**Subject:** Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Nexus HyperLine\n[[/div]]\n------\nRobert,\n\nWHAT THE FUCK DO I DO\n\nSorry for the phrasing, but, uh, the public is literally exploding.
