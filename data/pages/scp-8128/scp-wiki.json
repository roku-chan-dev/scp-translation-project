It is granted free roam privileges within designated low-risk zones of the facility, provided it does not attempt unauthorized access to restricted areas--. As SCP-8128 has been reclassified to Neutralized, no special containment measures are required. SCP-8128 is to remain in a standard display case in Site-17’s Non-Anomalous Object Storage for preservation. The recovered notebook and collar are stored alongside it.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8128 is a sentient taxidermy specimen of a domestic cat (Felis catus). It is a brown mackerel tabby with a dense, striped coat. The preserved specimen is in a curled resting position, though it is fully capable of movement, exhibiting typical feline locomotion, stretching, grooming behaviors, and even simulated biological functions.\n\nSCP-8128’s exterior is composed primarily of tanned feline hide[[footnote]]Chemical analysis suggests the hide was preserved using traditional taxidermy techniques from the early 20th century.[[/footnote]], which is stretched and stitched over an internal structure. Analysis of this structure via X-ray and MRI scans has confirmed that there are no organic components or skeletal elements present. Only tightly packed wood wool (excelsior) and cotton stuffing. Despite its apparent fragility, SCP-8128 moves with the fluidity and coordination of a living cat, though it produces a faint rustling noise when in motion due to the shifting of internal stuffing.\n\nAround its neck, SCP-8128 wears a faded red leather collar. Affixed to the collar is a small, oxidized silver coin, etched with the words:\n\n//“Bobby”//\n\n//“1932”//\n\n//“You have loved and you were loved.”//\n\nThe collar is aged and cracked, and some areas show signs of splitting and dry rot. Despite the apparent brittleness, SCP-8128 has not exhibited any discomfort or attempts to remove it.\n\n**Addendum 8128.1:** Discovery\n\nSCP-8128 first came to the Foundation's attention on October 3rd, 2004, after multiple reports from residents of ████████, Pennsylvania claimed to have seen a \"stuffed cat\" running loose in the neighborhood. Initial reports were dismissed as local pranks or misidentifications of a sickly stray. However, after a small group of children was witnessed chasing and throwing rocks at what was described as an \"old, messed-up cat that didn’t bleed\", Foundation assets embedded in local law enforcement flagged the incident for investigation.\n\nAgents dispatched to the area located SCP-8128 in a dilapidated two-story house. The house was long abandoned and in the process of being condemned. The property was identified as the former residence of Elizabeth “Betty” Walker (1879–1950) and had been uninhabited for over five decades. SCP-8128 was found cowering beneath a collapsed wooden table, exhibiting signs of distress but making no attempt to flee when approached.\n\nThe structure where SCP-8128 was found was in a dilapidated state. An iron-barred pet cage that was heavily rusted and partially collapsed was discovered. Within the cage, a decayed leather-bound journal was found, containing only a single legible note written in faded blue ink:\n\n> //“Hey John, Aunt Betty passed away a week ago. We’re moving some of her stuff out, and since you grew up with Bobby, we figured you should have him. They did a good job making him look alive. Visit us up north from time to time, we miss you. Take care. - Lukas, 1950.”//\n\nUpon containment, SCP-8128 exhibited a high level of affection toward Foundation personnel. It actively sought physical contact, such as rubbing against the agents' legs and purring audibly. No signs of hostility or aggression have ever been observed.\n\n**Addendum 2:**  Historical Analysis of SCP-8128’s Post-Sentience Treatment and Repair\n\nFollowing an in-depth investigation into SCP-8128’s history, it has become evident that the entity endured decades of cruelty prior to Foundation containment.\n\nEyewitness accounts from residents of ███████, Pennsylvania , suggest that SCP-8128 was first seen exhibiting movement sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s as multiple individuals recalled stories of \"Old Betty’s stuffed cat\" wandering the neighborhood.\n\nReports indicate that SCP-8128 was frequently chased, kicked, and thrown by children and teenagers. Many regarded it as an \"unholy thing,\" and \"a spawn of the devil,\" The question of when and how SCP-8128 first became sentient remains unanswered. Given the time frame of its known activity, it is possible that it only gained awareness after Betty’s death.\n\n> **Repair Log:** 04/12/2004\n> **Summary:** Due to SCP-8128’s deteriorating condition, on-site taxidermy specialists were assigned to conduct non-invasive preservation efforts.\n> \n> **Repairs Conducted:**\n> \n> 1. Reinforced stitching along SCP-8128’s underbelly and leg seams to prevent further separation of the hide.\n> \n> 2. Application archival leather conditioner to SCP-8128’s aged pelt.\n> \n> 3. Glass eyes polished to remove minor clouding and surface scratches.\n> \n> 4. Partial re-stuffing with acid-free cotton batting to reinforce structural integrity.\n> \n> 5. Collar cleaned and treated with a specialized preservation wax to prevent further cracking.\n> \n> 6. No internal modifications were made.\n> \n> Despite its deteriorated state, SCP-8128 did not exhibit any signs of pain during repairs and remained cooperative. It purred throughout the process and nudged researchers’ hands when they paused.\n\n**Addendum 3:** Morale Increase\n\nSCP-8128's presence has been observed to have a positive effect on on-site morale. Personnel have reported increased feelings of calm and emotional relief when interacting with or working near SCP-8128. Individuals diagnosed with mild to moderate psychological conditions (including anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress) have shown temporary improvement in symptoms during exposure.\n\n Formal testing is ongoing to determine whether these effects are anomalous in nature or the result of standard therapeutic responses associated with companion animals. Regardless, limited interaction with SCP-8128 is currently permitted as part of approved wellness protocols.\n\n _\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS 8128.TRANSCRIPTION.1\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n> **Dr. Reyes:** (soft chuckle) I swear, if Jenkins keeps leaving his yogurt in the fridge for three weeks, I’m going to file a complaint. It’s a war crime at this point.\n> \n> **Dr. Lin:** (quietly) …Yeah.\n> \n> **Dr. Reyes:** You okay?\n> \n> **Dr. Lin:** Yeah. Just… had to put Jasper down last night.\n> \n> **Dr. Reyes:** …Oh. Marcus, I’m so sorry. I didn’t know.\n> \n> **Dr. Lin:** It's alright. He was old. But—he was with me through grad school, you know? Twelve years.

Do you have mind-reading abilities too, buddy?\n> \n> **Dr. Lin:** (quietly) You always know, huh?\n> \n> **[Audio: long pause, no speaking – just purring]**\n> \n> **Dr. Reyes:** …He’s curled up next to you.\n> \n> **Dr. Lin:** Yeah. I think I really needed this.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n _\n\n**Addendum 4:** Additional Items Recovered\n\nDuring a follow-up investigation at the site of SCP-8128’s discovery, researchers recovered a small, brown, leather-bound notebook beneath the floorboards of the abandoned house. The cover bore the inscription:\n\n//“E.W. Betty, 1925”//\n//“To my boy, Bobby.”//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS 8128.RI.1\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n> May 3, 1925\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> You came to me so small and bright,\n> With golden stripes and eyes of light.\n> A tiny thing, but full of cheer,\n> And now, my home feels warm, my dear.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> July 19, 1926\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> You have taken to sleeping on my lap, curled up tight as a button. Even as I write this, your little paws twitch against my arm. What are you dreaming of, my love? Chasing birds? Dancing leaves?\n> \n> I hope you dream of me, too.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> October 31, 1927\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> The children came for sweets tonight,\n> In masks and cloaks, a playful fright!\n> But none of them made me smile so,\n> As when you pounced on falling snow.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> March 12, 1928\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> Today, you stole a biscuit off my plate and carried it off like a great victory. When I tried to take it back, you glared at me as if I were the thief! I let you keep it, of course. I would give you anything.\n> \n> (Except another biscuit, you greedy thing!)\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> June 7, 1929\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> A storm raged fierce, the sky went black,\n> The thunder roared, the trees bent back.\n> But in the night, when all was grim,\n> You nestled close, and fear grew dim.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> August 23, 1930\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> I heard a woman today call her child a “blessing.”\n> I wanted to tell her, I have one too.\n> But people do not always understand.\n> \n> You are my blessing, my boy.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> December 4, 1931\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> You’ve been sleeping more these days.\n> I call your name, and you barely stir.\n> The vet says you are getting old,\n> But you are still my baby.

Please do not leave me.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> June 11, 1932\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> The vet says you don’t have much time.\n> I think you already know.\n> You don’t chase the dust motes anymore.\n> You don’t even try to steal my biscuits.\n> \n> I will not leave your side.\n> \n> Love always,\n> Betty\n\n> September 29, 1932\n> Dear Bobby,\n> \n> The house is so quiet now.\n> Your bed is untouched.\n> Your collar is still warm in my hands.\n> But my arms are so empty.\n> \n> I love you. I miss you.

Just a tiny thing. So small he could fit in the crook of my arm. The man at the shop said he was the runt of the litter. I think that’s why I chose him. Poor guy. I get him!\n> \n> The house has been so empty since Harold passed. I keep listening for his boots on the floorboards, the creak of the stairs at midnight, his hum in the kitchen while he made coffee. But the silence stretches longer each day. And I am feeling very alone.\n> \n> I named the little one Bobby. I don’t know why, it just felt right. He slept curled against my chest the whole ride home. I think he knows he’s safe now. \n\n> September 10, 1925\n> \n> Bobby’s been getting bolder. He’s taken to climbing up the curtains and knocking over the pepper shaker just to hear the noise. I pretend to scold him, but truth be told, I love the mischief. He brings life into the house. Oh, how I miss my children. And you too, Harold. I know you're reading this. \n> \n> Last week, he found Harold’s old wool cap. Dragged it out from the closet and made a nest of it on the parlor rug. I stood in the doorway and watched him sleep in it for nearly an hour. Something about it undid me. I cried, but only a little. Maybe it’s Harold’s way of telling me he's still here, in a way.\n> \n> I never thought I’d feel joy again. But Bobby, in his small, clumsy way, reminds me each day that the world can still be warm.\n\n> March 4, 1927\n> \n> He waits for me at the window every day now. Right around five o’clock, when I return from the market or my sewing circle. He watches the road, tail flicking behind him like a metronome. The neighbors joke that he thinks he's the man of the house, watching over me.\n> \n> Maybe he is. How silly.\n> \n> Last week, I fell while reaching for the spice tin on the top shelf. It wasn’t serious, just a bruise, but Bobby wouldn’t leave my side. He followed me to bed, curled up near the ache on my hip, and stayed there all night. Every time I stirred, I felt him press closer.\n> \n> I love this little thief.\n\n> November 2, 1929\n> \n> The winters are colder now. I don’t know if it's the years catching up to me or the house finally settling into its old bones. Bobby doesn't seem to mind. He stretches out by the fire, belly up, like a king in his court. I envy his peace.\n> \n> He’s slower now. He still plays sometimes, but only for a few minutes before settling down. I think we both feel the years creeping in. We’ve grown old together. Grandpa Bobby!\n> \n> Sometimes I catch him staring at the door like he’s waiting for someone. Maybe Harold. Maybe something else. I don't ask. I just sit beside him, and together we listen to the wind.\n\n> November 2, 1929\n> \n> The vet came today. He tried to be gentle about it. “Not long now,” he said. “I don't know what's wrong with em', possibly his heart.” I nodded and didn’t cry. I waited until he left.\n> \n> Bobby doesn’t seem scared. Just tired. He still follows me from room to room, though his steps are heavier. Sometimes he sleeps so deeply I have to put my hand on his side to make sure he’s still breathing.\n> \n> I carried him out to the garden this morning, just like I used to when he was a kitten. He blinked in the sunlight and rested his head against my chest. The roses are blooming. I told him they bloomed just for him.\n> \n> I don't know how to say goodbye. Why does everyone I love always leave me? Bobby, you're not one of them, are you?\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-8128 has displayed unusual behavior since the notebook’s discovery such as frequently curling up beside it when left unattended. Further monitoring is ongoing.\n\n**Addendum 5:** Sudden Cessation of SCP-8128’s Sentience\n\nOn 06/21/2004, at 02:47 AM, SCP-8128 exhibited an abrupt and unexplained loss of all sentience.\n\nAt approximately 02:45 AM, SCP-8128 was seen leaving its usual resting area and walking slowly toward its original pedestal in Containment Room B4.\n\nUpon reaching the pedestal, SCP-8128 curled into a resting position identical to its original taxidermy posture.\n\nAt 02:47 AM, SCP-8128 ceased all movement and activity. It has not responded to external stimuli since.\n\nNo anomalous energy signatures or disturbances were detected at the time of cessation.\n\nSCP-8128’s physical composition remains unchanged. However, all autonomous functions, including simulated eating, drinking, purring, and movement, have completely stopped.\n\nDespite multiple tests, no external factor has been identified as the cause of this event. SCP-8128’s sudden return to an inanimate state remains unexplained.\n\nAs of 06/22/2004, SCP-8128 has been officially reclassified from Safe to Neutralized.\n\n> **Personal Memo – Dr. Elaine Carter**\n> **Date:** 06/22/2004\n> **Subject**: SCP-8128\n> \n>  I kept replaying the footage. He chose to go back to that pedestal. The way he curled up just like he did when he first arrived. It looked like he was just… going to sleep.\n> \n> I wonder if it was the notebook.\n> \n> The day before this happened, He wouldn’t leave it alone. He wouldn’t even come when we called him. That never happened before.\n> \n> Maybe he finally remembered. \n> \n> Maybe, just maybe, Betty was waiting for him somewhere we can’t see.\n> \n> I hope so.\n> \n> I hope she called him home.\n> \n> //– Elaine//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** bobby.png\n> **Name:** 960px-Crimean_Tom.jpg\n> **Author:** National Army Museum London\n> **License:**CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Crimean_Tom.jpg\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
