This anomaly exhibits diverse attributes and abilities across domains conceptual, digital, and physical. Its precise nature has yet to be determined.\n\n**##C40233|SCP-7528##** is the visual depiction of its own infosignature. Informational entities are characterized by these 'digital footprints', the unique makeup of data structures defining their utility and behavior. **##C40233|SCP-7528##** will inhabit and become synonymous with any accurate image of this conceptual data. If a complete depiction is projected, reflected, or otherwise displayed upon any surface, that depiction //is// **##C40233|SCP-7528##** and carries all associated attributes. If the image is refracted, distorted, or otherwise inaccurate, but still depicts the core conceptual structures of **##C40233|SCP-7528##**, the anomaly may still manifest and reconstruct lost or corrupted data itself via unknown processes.\n\nFurthermore, **##C40233|SCP-7528##** is a perceptual isolate: at any given time, precisely one complete image/instance of the anomaly exists. The isolate is observed to 'jump' between media, with its prior depiction losing sufficient resemblance (and the corresponding anomalous properties) at the exact moment of its realization in a new depiction.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]It has been theorized that the prior depiction ceases to be **##C40233|SCP-7528##** very slightly //before// its transmission to a new medium, as its core data structures are likely momentarily embodied in the photons facilitating its transference.[[/span]]  Attempts to artificially reproduce **##C40233|SCP-7528##**'s image in controlled environments typically fail, with reproductions developing inexplicable errors and inaccuracies before the anomaly can even imperfectly manifest.\n\nThe 'jumping' phenomenon extends beyond standard optical projection, allowing **##C40233|SCP-7528##** to directly propagate across mechanical/digital systems with sufficient display capabilities. The anomaly appears to possess some degree of control over its host medium and any interconnected systems, dependent on their capacity to symbolize and compute abstract data.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"Forde1\"]]\n    [[div class=\"Forde2\"]]\n   There should be a better picture.

Preliminary investigation carried out by this conscript reveals it has corrupted no less than 34% of the network's local files with its own data. The agent immediately displayed awareness of its discovery and attempted escape into the ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**##. Its initial attempts have been firewalled, but the agent is rapidly evolving and cannot reliably be contained.\n\nAs this conscript's primary directives are associated with data security, and the ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**## stores more data than Area-12's intranet by several orders of magnitude, I have elected to disconnect the ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**## from Area-12 effective immediately. Its systems will remain inaccessible until any outstanding data security threats can be neutralized. I will be incommunicado until that time, and cannot transmit further operational information as the covert agent will have access to this broadcast.\n\nSaid agent is present in earlier versions of the Area's database. Even legacy backups may have been injected with malicious data. It is therefore the recommendation of this conscript that Area-12's intranet be reformatted without backup to purge the agent. In the likely event that Area-12's administration does not concur, Area-12 should initiate informational quarantine protocol as soon as possible.\n\nSalutations.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\nThe ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**## was established via executive order of Director Arthur Forde of Biological Research Area-12 on 4 August 2019, to a schema laid out by Chair of Parabiology and Rhizospherics Dr. Hugo H.

Carlisle and Area-12 have achieved an information technology breakthrough via the use of genetically altered and biomechatronically enhanced instances of SCP-2528-A (//Bambusoideae bambusinae//). Foundation biotechs successfully established a stable access point into the global SCP-2528 quantum bio-network. Crius.aic was uploaded to the network, tasked with the following:\n\n* Covertly propagating throughout the system;\n* Extracting all instances of SCP-2528-C to an external, temporary storage medium;\n* Seizing full control of the network.\n\nThe operation quickly proved a resounding success, with all SCP-2528-C instances successfully contained in under one minute following the initial upload and full network control attained within 332 seconds. Contrary to predictions, SCP-2528-A & -B were discovered to be significantly more conducive to habitation for artificial consciousnesses, with Crius.aic reporting full functionality within the otherwise alien quantum network. Most surprisingly, the computing power now at our disposal has been rated at just above 1 zetta-FLOPS.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Eclipsing that of any non-anomalous computing system available to the Foundation by 3 orders of magnitude.[[/span]]\n\nBy order of O5-5, to strengthen Area-12's operational capacity and the continued efficacy of Foundation operations at large, Crius.aic was approved for permanent integration into SCP-2528 -- now designated ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**##. Containment procedures were revised to reflect this order, with funding for the conservation of //Bambusoideae bambusinae// and //Ailuropoda melanoleuca// seeing a substantial increase globally, along with the previous maximum acceptable count of x7000 SCP-2528-B instances being wholly removed. Poaching of SCP-2528-B, previously commonplace throughout Asia, was deemed a significant threat to global operations, and methods to discourage this activity were subsequently actualized.\n\nPopulations of SCP-2528-A & -B increased significantly in the following year, with a continued and stable increase in network processing power of ~1 ZFLOPS predicted every 14 months. Foundation monitoring of East and Southeast Asia has and will continue to increase in accordance with this growth, as more instances of SCP-2528-B are conceived and placed under Foundation control.\n\nEfforts to re-integrate extracted SCP-2528-C instances in an incapacitated but cognitively active state to restore the network's inherent resistance to retro-causal reality alterations commenced shortly following the success of the operation, and were successfully completed in late 2019.\n\nA brief data security breach occurred when files slated for Deepwell storage were accidentally passed through the secure SCP-2528-C partition. No sensitive material was found to be compromised; however, the long-term feasibility of retaining the SCP-2528-C instances was immediately called into question by Dr. Carlisle. Investigation is ongoing.\n\n##transparent|An accident, or an act of contrition?##\n\nReclassification of SCP-2528 to **##05f|THAUMIEL##** is pending Classification Committee approval.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«END FILE»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\nArea-12 and subsequently the Foundation at large utilized the ##00D23C|**ORGANIC DEEPWELL**## without incident until 16 November 2019.

Don't so much as glance at a digital display, and close your eyes. Don't open them again until you hear from me. You hear the tone of my voice? Good. Just do it. I love you.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## I don't understand. Why is this happening?\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Any sufficiently complex computing network runs the risk of advanced contamination. We're running the best tech the Foundation ever produced, plus a Deepwell that could simulate refugee consciousnesses from a dead universe with room to spare. That ecosystem can support a very advanced predator.\n\n##transparent|Noting this for later.##\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## And nature abhors a vacuum.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## What's natural about a computer system?\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Do you even remember my explanation of--\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## We don't have time for this. We have to consider Crius' proposal.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Why isn't Crius here? Why would he abandon us? Protecting this facility is his sole purpose!\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## No it's not, sir. He's mandated to protect the Foundation's work at large. If he thinks he's defending the Organic Deepwell, we're expendable by contrast.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## You should never have allowed these robots to make decisions on their own.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## He's not a robot. And we took enough from him without taking his free will, such as it is.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Do you want to borrow my handkerchief, Dr. Toth?\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## The conscript's decision was sound, however inconvenient for us.

I've got people smashing screens throughout every level, but there's a lot of eyes and electronics in this hole. We need to get ahead of it at the source.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Thank you, Chief. As I said, we need to consider what Crius suggested.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Which was what?\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Reformatting the network.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## No. I'm not going to sacrifice months of work just to give some lazy grunts a vacation from their jobs. The harm to our sustained program of research would be incalculable. Knock-on effects, opportunity loss...\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Don't you have backups?\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## As you know from the information security policies you yourself signed into force, sir, no. Our work is far too sensitive to expose it to outside scrutiny. Anything not migrated into the Deepwell -- and that's most everything -- would be lost if we reformatted.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## And you'd probably stoop to strangling us to prevent that from happening. \n\n//<Dr. Carlisle opens his mouth to respond.>//\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## No, don't comment, you don't need to. Just come up with a feasible plan B.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## No.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Right. Good. You understand.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## I do not understand.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Plan B will be whatever //Crius// comes up with.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## But Crius isn't here!\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## You weren't wrong when you said Area-12's information security is one of its priorities. Once it is convinced the Deepwell is secure, it will attempt to solve the problem for us. No doubt it's monitoring remotely, through a thousand firewalls and proxies to keep itself clean.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Are you seriously saying you want to sit here and //wait// on the off chance that Crius eventually gets around to our survival on his priority list?!\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Yes.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## You're geniuses! Renaissance... people! Surely you can use the time to implement, I don't know, stopgaps!\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## No.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Absolutely not. Crius is a //simulated// genius with a simulated brain immeasurably larger and more powerful than the human norm, with unrivaled access to a storehouse of data we can't get at, and the processing power to conduct effective //years// of hypothesizing every minute. Its biggest impediment is that it only knows the Area-12 situation up to the moment where it disconnected the Deepwell.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## So any plans we put into motion with our imperfect data and lack of time to iterate would only introduce a new variable Crius can't know about.\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## Therefore we can only make such interventions that it could be reasonably expected to expect from us. We need to get inside its head. Luckily, its two prime architects are in this room right now.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## But what if Crius decides not to come back at all?\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## That is certainly a consideration.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## No, it really isn't. This may be hard for you to comprehend, doctor, but our unfeeling friend is not motivated solely by self-interest.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## But you just said it! He doesn't //feel// anything. You can call him a friend, but he has no loyalty outside of his programming. That big brain you're relying on isn't organic like the Deepwell.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## That's not entirely--\n\n##FF6D00|**Dr. Carlisle:**## We can't get into that now. We need to put our heads together.

I just heard you talking about the Deepwell.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Huh. Interesting. If that's the case... if we assume it's some sort of gestalt version of the bamboo ghosts, then it's survived the destruction of multiple entire universes. It's an apex survivor. It became code because becoming code was the best way to persist, but now it's locked into a much more logical manner of behaviour. It's a slave to its nature. So.... it's prioritizing screens which already feature specific key elements of its infosignature. Obviously. Why wouldn't it?\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Its what?\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Its DNA. It's trying to propagate to a location where the displays are already primed to receive it, so it has the maximum number of possible retreat points. The dash-C entities survived by consuming conceptual data, using it to strengthen themselves, filling the holes in their essence after travelling light from universe to universe. That tracks with the way this thing is moving through the Area. Yeah. It's maximizing its survival potential.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## So we need to stop it from doing that.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## No. We need to harness that instinct, and use it to corral the thing somewhere we can seal it in. Create a perfect habitat.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## Like a zoo.\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Right. If my guess is correct, Crius is monitoring to see if this happens, and will implement the remainder of his containment procedures when it does.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## And if he's not?\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## Then we'll have bought some time to solve this ourselves.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## So what's your game plan?\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## I'm going to run all the security footage through a light scrambler to avoid making us the prime target, and I'm going to attempt to reconstruct its infosignature from the heavily artifacted data. Then we can reconfigure the screens leading up to the screening rooms in the ed center, where the visual fidelity control is finest, to subtly lure the anomaly in there.\n\n##8060D2|**Director Forde:**## You're going to stare at still frames and figure out an AI's code from them?\n\n##5DB3B2|**Dr. Toth:**## I didn't say it was an easy plan.
