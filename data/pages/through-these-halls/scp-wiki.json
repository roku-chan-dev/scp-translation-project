A brother always has a brother’s back.\n\nAhead is the ghost. Her scars writhe and thirsts for blood.\nShe sings her, “Vivir mi vida”, while she pops a drop of\npainkillers in her system. Morning and evening is a constant\nBattle with her screaming body. How she wishes to rip it out.\n\nThe angel watches all. Every staff to every monster\nThat their cages can hold. A library of plains, passions\nPleasures, and pains. She promises them that one day\nShe will bring them into the light. If she can fool them.\n\nThe Director of Site-63 makes tabs. To the soldier and his\nMachine body and vicious mind. To the beast and\nThe hunger he shares with a greater lion. To the ghost\nAnd the scarlet hue in her eyes. Angels have long left.\n\nThrough these halls, they pass by each other. Their lives\nAkin to a confluence. It would be the unified reason as to\nWhy they continue to work in The Foundation. Because no\nOne deserves the burdens they carry alone in the dark.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Strange Matter]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
