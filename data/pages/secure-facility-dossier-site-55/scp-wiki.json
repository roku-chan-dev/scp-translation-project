He had previously been a lab technician at Site-19, which had been way too big and had way too many things going on at once. All things told, he had been a mess ever since he had started working for the Foundation. The stress of working under the biggest names (and egos) of the anomalous world had gotten to him in a rather embarrassing way. \n\nRex had suffered a panic attack while on the job.\n\nIt wasn't that he didn't know what he was doing; far from it. He had known well enough that he was working with a Capital A Anomaly, but the pressure of being observed by a Site Director and three Level-5 personnel really got to him. It wasn't pretty. They had to physically carry him out.\n\nHe stayed in his dorm for three days after that. As soon as he emerged, he found out he was being transferred to some Site on the New England coast to be someone's assistant. And now he found himself here, in the back of some dingy Foundation transport vehicle. Alone. At least he would soon have company again.\n\nRex sighed, looking down to his Foundation-issued tablet. \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/secure-facilities-locations/Site-55.svg width=\"150px\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n+ NOTICE OF TRANSFER\n[[/=]]\n\nHello, and welcome to Site-55!\n\nWe're so glad you could make it.

Despite being unable to find the toyshop, ASCI operatives established an outpost in the outskirts of Boston to monitor the goings-on of the extra-dimensional location. \n\nDuring the years between the creation of this outpost and the dissolution of the ASCI/creation of the Foundation in 1944, various anomalous children's products started appearing in the Boston area, all of them emblazoned with a gold and purple 'W'. Due to the sudden spike in anomalous activity and the presence of an extra-dimensional location nearby, the newly-created Foundation elected to convert the former ASCI outpost into a fully-fledged Site.\n\nThe Foundation quickly found itself in an ever-expanding anomalous world, with the Global Occult Coalition's Council of 108 forming in the same year of its creation. The Cold War brought about various organizations such as the GRU-P, the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/mac-hub CMA], and PENTAGRAM, and with them various restrictions as to how they could operate across the world. At the time, Site-55 was the largest Foundation site on the East Coast of the United States and as such was selected to serve as a hub for communications between the Foundation and GoIs.\n\nOver time, this role expanded to containing objects recovered from other anomalous organizations, such as artwork from Are We Cool Yet? cells based out of Backdoor SoHo and recipes from Ambrose Restaurants in the area. In the modern era, Site-55 is effectively the leading center of group of interest research, and with the notable exception of two groups,[[footnote]] The only exceptions to this rule are Wilson's Wildlife Solutions and Anderson Robotics, which are directly managed by [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64]]]. [[/footnote]] serves as the Foundation's hub of anomalous group communications.\n\nDr. C. Thereven (of the Anomalous Communications and Relations Department)  and Dr. J. Everwood (of the GoI Research Department) often work hand in hand in acquiring new anomalous objects from GoIs. The two departments typically perform joint field operations and conduct meetings with groups such as the Global Occult Coalition, the Horizon Initiative, ORIA, and Marshall, Carter, and Dark. Due to the efforts of Everwood and Thereven, cooperation between the Foundation and multiple GoIs has been made possible within the last fifteen years.\n\nDespite this, various hostile,[[footnote]] The Chaos Insurgency, Serpent's Hand, Are We Cool Yet?, etc. [[/footnote]] or at the least uncooperative,[[footnote]] Gamers Against Weed, SAPPHIRE, PENTAGRAM, etc. [[/footnote]] GoIs continue to populate the world.
