All individuals currently teaching at West Hills High are barred from interacting with any of the student body outside of the school, or after school hours. Any devices capable of recording distributable media are to be confiscated from students under the guise of measures against student dishonesty. Any online media originating from within the school is to be taken down, with higher priority given to content depicting students engaging in conversation with each other. \n\n**Description:**\nSCP-7285 is the designation given to the Forced personality distortion field located within West Hills High (and expanding to any property used for the curriculum), primarily affecting the student body, hereby referred to as SCP-7285-2. This effect is entirely isolated to school facilities and has not been observed to persist after SCP-7285-2 leaves the premises. The anomaly alters an individual's personality by targeting memories of important life events and previous sessions of school. SCP-7285 is not wide scale, however, and usually targets a single memory and causes the SCP-7285-2 instance to recall it often over the duration they remain on school grounds. \n\nAltered life events typically become much more simplistic in nature, and a life lesson is made obvious in each one. SCP-7285-2 instances do not question the simplicity and when prompted will discuss the profound impact that it had on them (typically as a younger child). Personality traits that are changed in any way by the alteration of memories are extremely over exaggerated, and cause the instance to exhibit a smaller range of emotions and differing/no reactions to certain stimuli. Altered personalities stay consistent upon re-entering the campus, however, memories are not sustained. Attempting to recall events of the previous school day when not on campus yields in mundane results.\n\nAltered personalities tend to follow a template, with students sharing a multitude of similarities and edited memories. Students sharing a template are known to form friend groups and stay close during the school day. Notably, minor anomalous abilities and physical alterations are granted on campus, but fail to manifest when not on school grounds. Students are not able to sustain bodily harm of any form on the premise. \n\n\n**Addendum:**\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview logs\" hide=\"Interviews with SCP-7285-2 instances\"]]\n [[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Jimmy Stenback, 9th grade student at West Hills High\n \n **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Zavala\n \n **Foreword:** Interview taken under the guise of a school newspaper report. Subject showed momentary distress when separated from friend group during the lunch period.\n \n **<Begin Log, 12:45>**\n \n **Zavala:** Alright, James, I have a few questions for you be-\n \n**Jimmy:** Jimmy. My name is Jimmy.\n \n**Zavala:** Ope, seems like a misread the document a little. Sorry, Jimmy.\n \n**Jimmy:** State questions then allow me to return to my fellows, Sir.\n\n **Zavala:** First question; what's your favorite subject, Jimmy?\n \n**Jimmy:** Easily math. My intelligence is barely tested, but it is still the most complex and enjoyable to me. However, I enjoy all subjects aside from physical education.\n\n **Zavala:** //Chuckles// I remember when I was your age, I felt the same ab-\n \n**Jimmy:** Continue with questioning.\n \n**Zavala:** //muttering// good grief, your a stubborn one, aren't you...\n \n**Zavala:** Well O.K. then, Mr. business. How do you feel about the current homework policy for your grade level?\n \n**Jimmy:** It bores me, Doctor Zavala. I have made multiple requests to the school board to have the difficulty increased for those serious about their education like me, yet I have yielded no results. \n \n//Zavala is visually shocked at the mention of his name, Stenback maintains a emotionless and monotone disposition.//\n \n**Zavala:** We- Well then... I suppose this is your, uh, lucky day! This newspaper is going to be printed publicly, so the school board might take notice...\n\n **Jimmy:** That is satisfactory. Is this interview concluded? I should be returning to my study group now.\n\n **Zavala:** Er, well, yes. You can go now. Thank you for your time.\n\n //Stenback returns to the cafeteria and resumes dining with a table group//\n \n**<End Log, 12:53>**\n \n**Closing Statement:** All potential methods from which it could ascertain my real name, much less my cover one have been ruled out, leading me to the conclusion that this instance has some form of anomalous knowledge. Maybe even mind reading, but its impossible to know for sure. When questioned further he just complemented his own intelligence as if the operative wasn't even there.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n **Interviewed:** Weston Greeves\n \n **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Zavala\n \n **Foreword:** Subject called to the school administrative office with no further context given. After a period of time had passed and the -2 instance had not yet arrived, operatives were sent to forcefully retrieve the instance from its classroom.\n\n **<Begin Log, 2:12>**\n \n //SCP-7285-2 instance is dragged into the room and placed onto a chair across from Junior Researcher Zavala, the two are then left together//\n\n **Zavala:** Er, hello? Are you //papers shuffling// Weston Greeves?\n\n //SCP-7285-2 instance did not respond and appeared to be unconscious. It had not made any form of movement that was noticeable. Light snoring can be heard over the ambiance of the room.//\n\n **Zavala:** Christ...\n\n //Zavala moves to check for a pulse on the subject before recoiling, audibly surprised by the result.//\n\n //Zavala pulls out his radio//\n\n **Zavala:** Can I can medical staff from the SCP-7285 site outpost? I have an instance here that, well, has no discernible pulse. \n\n **Zavala:** Location? Uh, let me see. We are in the principal office currently. Thank you. \n\n //A significant amount of time passes while Zavala and the instance sit in near silence, only interrupted by the snoring noise//\n\n //Zavala signals to end the recording as medical staff enter the room//\n\n **<End Log, 2:32>**\n\n **Closing Statement:** Medical team found the instance to be in a vegetative state, however, high levels of brain activity were noted. The medical team believes this to mean that the SCP-7285-2 instance was not completely unconscious. When taken off site, vegetative state ceased and the instance displayed brief confusion before returning to the school campus. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n **Interviewed:** Claire Jones\n \n **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Zavala\n \n **Foreword:** Subject called to the school health office for a routine eye exam. Instance was then isolated and interviewed.\n \n **<Begin Log, 8:34>**\n \n //Instance comes into view of the camera. Subject's body is altered to a large extent, possessing the mass of 3 baseline humans. Several appendages are located in the relative area of their normal location, and the instance has 3 functioning heads equipped with the proper amount of sensory organs. All three are capable of speech.//\n\n //Zavala can be seen attempting to suppress fear as the instance struggles to fit through the doorway. Subject is eventually successful, however, some of the wall is torn away with it. Instance falls down and sits upright across from Zavala.//\n\n //Heads begin speaking incoherently and simultaneously between each other, only small fragments of speech can be made out. A discussion regarding the \"Cute boys in our grade\" is taking place. Zavala clears his throat, and all three heads immediately stop speaking and face toward Zavala with a disapproving expression.//\n\n **Claire:** What is this? I thought we were getting an eye exam. Are you the doctor? I'm fine as long as it wastes class time. Like did you see Weston yesterday? He is sooooo cute when he sleeps in class!\n\n //Zavala pauses for a moment before addressing the instance.//\n\n **Zavala:** Well, Claire, you have been... selected... to participate in a survey. I just have a few questions before you go to the eye doctor.\n\n//All of the instance's heads assume a neutral expression, and Zavala becomes more noticeably uncomfortable.//\n\n **Claire:** Fine then. This better be important. Take your time, I'm in no rush. Try to make it interesting. Go on.\n\n//Heads speak quickly and in succession, leaving Zavala no time to respond. When it has been made clear that no further comments are being made by the instance, he proceeds with the listed questions.//\n\n**Zavala:** Could you please, uh, describe your relationships with other students in your class?\n\n//The heads, which had begun to slope down in an apparent resting state, suddenly bolted upright and began to blush.//\n\n**Claire:** Sure! This is a little embarrassing... I do not have good relations with all my classmates. I have many friends. A lot of people hang out with me. Friends make me feel good.\n\n**Zavala:** Would you mind going into detail as to specific relationships?\n\n**Claire:** I talk a lot with Johnny. And Samantha. And Randy. And Beau. I talk a lot with everyone. Everyone likes me. Weston doesn't like me. Why doesn't Weston talk to me?\n\n//Heads overlap each other, speaking as one finishes a sentence, but continuing before the last has finished speaking, producing an echoing effect. Upon the mention of Weston, voices unified and became more impatient in tone.//\n\n**Claire:** Is this over yet? I should go. I need to go talk. I need Weston. I need to talk to friends. I need to go. I need to go. I nee-\n\n//At this point, the instance has begun making vague gestures with its hands, causing Zavala to flinch. He has also started sweating and wets his lips before carrying on.//\n\n**Zavala:** OK, OK just a few more questions then you can go. Even skip the examination if you want. Just hang in there a little longer for me, alright?\n\n//Instance relaxes a little and ceased flailing. It reasserts its gaze upon Zavala, startling him. He momentarily positions his arm above the silent alarm located on his desk.//\n\n**Zavala:** Ok, alright. You know what? Just one more question.\n\n**Zavala:** Are you... Are you in pain?\n\n**Claire:** What? Why would I? Are you a doctor? Stay away from me creep. Am I bleeding?\n\n//Zavala's facial expression slightly relaxes, the instance remains inert.//\n\n**Zavala:** Alright. Go ahead back to class now, thank you for your participation.\n\n//Instance exits the room, and various fragments of speech can still be heard coming from its heads. Instance erupts into an argument with itself in the hallway outside of the interview room.//\n\n//Zavala sighs and begins to walk back to the temporary research site erected around SCP-7285, before turning back around and switching off the recording.//\n\n **<End Log, 9:02>**\n\n **Closing Statement:** Due to his disregard for proper protocol, and differing from interview script, Zavala was called in for an interrogation and potential reassignment.

The negligence you displayed caused a good amount of damage to our operation here, and could have easily done more. Do you know what the men doing in classroom research that your interview provided time for had to deal with?\n\n**10:44 Zavala:** I do regret it sir, and I was not aware that other research operations were depending on my interview. \n\n**10:45 [[span class=\"dblock\"]]David Cameron[[/span]]:** You miss the point. Even if you were not aware, you should not have differed from protocol under any circumstances. For christ sake, this interview was even your idea.

I don't think I am fit for further work on this project. Not in my current mental state. It's just that- Well, I saw my little girl in that things eyes, and I.. I can't go back in there. \n\n**10:48 [[span class=\"dblock\"]]David Cameron[[/span]]:** So you will accept re-assignment to another anomaly?\n\n**10:48 Zavala:** Yes, sir.\n\n**10:48 [[span class=\"dblock\"]]David Cameron[[/span]]:** Then we are done here.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-7285-2 observed interpersonal reactions\" hide=\"SCP-7285-2 observed interpersonal reactions\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n**Foreword**\n@@ @@\nThis is Research Derek Adams and I will be transcribing my observations of SCP-7285-2 students during school hours, without their knowledge for a more --pure-- natural environment. Kind of like National Geographic. Without further ado, below is an up to date list of all interactions I felt noteworthy. \n@@ @@\n\n1-03-23\nScience class (No particular specification on which type of science)\nTaught by a \"Mr. Brown\" (Not his actual name, assumed to be affected by SCP-7285)\nInteracting instances --were a-- involved the whole class, but mainly a male instance with no significant physical alterations, and another male student with it's black hoodie appearing to be fused with the flesh on --his-- it's head.\n@@ @@ \nMale student begins walking back to his desk after being called to the front by the teacher to answer a question (Question consisted of a primary school level addition problem). While returning, it walks by the second instance's desk, and spits upon it. (It is noted that during this interaction, the rest of the class --is entirely inert-- show no signs of movement). The hooded instance reaches into --his-- it's black book bag, at an incredibly slow speed. During this time, the rest of the class which were previously inert immediately snapped their heads towards the hooded --students-- instances bag. They all share the same facial expression of shock and fear. The hooded instance pulls its hand out of the bag along with a notebook, causing the classroom to simultaneously emit a sigh of relief. At this point, the male instance and the hooded instance cease activity, and the interaction is deemed to be over.\n@@ @@\nAlright so what I gathered from this interaction is, well, confusing to say the least. The implications of the whole class responding simultaneously leave a couple possibilities. Either a sort of hive mind (interconnected consciousness), anomalous physical/mental manipulation causing the (quite literal) turn of heads, or the exaggerated personalities of each instance lined up perfectly with the situation. If we go with that last idea, then is it possible that classes have been arranged specifically based on SCP-7285-2 personalities? Even then, is this the work of one person, or just another effect of the SCP-7285 campus? Got to go now, janitor approaching closet, check in soon.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n1-04-23\nGym\nTaught by Gus, no last name given.\nInteracting instances consisted of 2 males, both with abnormal height and limb length (particularly in the arms, estimated at around --four-- 5 feet long.)\n@@ @@\nA group of around 68 students are engaged in a game of dodge ball, the student population consists of exactly half male and female. Instances are split into 2 teams based on gender. The instances with the most severe alterations from SCP-7285 are the 2 males listed above. Specified instances are throwing the rubber dodge balls at the opposing team with a speed in which they cannot be observed in motion. On impact, balls thrown by the 2 instances deal immense damage and typically remove limbs when hit. --Victims of these attacks-- Impacted instances do not display pain visually, instead emitting a slight groan (if the head is intact) and walking/crawling to the opposite side. Limbs do not reappear until instance is off campus, and the effects of SCP-7285 wear off. Upon eliminating the opposing team, the 2 male instances vocalize a growl akin to that of a gorilla, and run into each other multiple times before the game resets. This process repeats with little variation each time the game is played, and only ends when the class period is over. Female instances, regardless of --injuries-- damage, go through classes as usual. No other instances take notice.\n@@ @@\nWell, that all but confirms it. These classes are //intentionally// being put together based on personality/alterations. There is most certainly someone behind this. My first guess would be the Principal, but it is entirely possible that an anomalous PoI may be pulling the strings from somewhere offsite. We should rule out the most obvious first, so I am going to request a small task force to storm the principals office. We do not know how dangerous this individual might be, or if there's an individual at all, but it is our duty to find out. When I get the clearance, i'll be attaching the log to this document. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-7285 incursion log\" hide=\"SCP-7285 incursion log\"]]\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n| AUTOMATIC TRANSCRIPTION AGENT: ONLINE\n| RECORDING: INITIATED \n\n**Adams:** This is Researcher Derek Adams, currently positioned outside the entrance of SCP-7285. With me are agents Mar- I mean, Beta and Omega. Since traditional weaponry is incapable of stopping a -2 instance, I'm told they have some sort of shock wave gun?\n\n**Beta:** It's a high frequency emitter, supposedly, this thing will fry the brains of any anomaly that gets in our way. We probably won't use it though since these things haven't been outright hostile.\n\n**Omega:** Not yet. Remember Researcher Adams theory on this theoretical controller, if it suspects we are on to it, one might assume that he would be able to make these things target us. That's what the frequency emitter is for, just pray we don't have to use it on god damn children. \n\n**Beta:** Jeez. If they become hostile we should try to just run first. From the logs that I read these things tend to be impaired from activities they do in school, and even just as a result of some anomalous trait. We should get going now, though.\n\n//The group proceeds into the school, with Researcher Adams in the lead. Agent Omega has his frequency emitter primed and at the ready, while Agent Beta holds it at his side. Once inside, Researcher Adams holds up an object resembling an electric lantern.//\n\n**Beta:** Adams, what is that? Some sort of reality stabilizer? \n\n**Adams:** Correct my friend. This should make those sound guns obsolete, I believe you were worried about using it?\n\n**Beta:** Well, y-\n\n//The school bell rings, and students begin to flood out into the hallways in unusually high numbers. Onboard transcription AI detects at least 700 instances in the current hallway alone.//\n\n//Instances begin to rush past the agents and Researcher Adams, colliding often. Adams fumbles to activate the reality anchor.//\n\n**Adams:** THAT SHOULD DO IT!\n\n//A loud hum is heard emanating from the device, and it begins to glow softly. Instances in the near vicinity of the group are briefly stabilized before succumbing to the effects of SCP-7285, displaying a brief bout of confusion. A large majority of \"instances\" cease to exist when exposed to the reality anchor.//\n\n**Beta:** What the hell? Where did they go? \n\n**Omega:** Calm down, it was likely just some sort of projection caused by one of these kids anomalous traits. Worst case scenario, it was the principal trying to stop us. Either way, Adams reality anchor stopped it. \n\n//The hallways begin to calm down as students return to their classes, the group presses onward.// \n\n//Further down the hallway, an instance is observed walking slowly and talking to itself. At this time, all 2nd period classes have begun.//\n\n**Omega:** I would advise avoiding it, Adams.

Keep your senses sharp. \n\n//Adams pulls the glasses of his face//\n\n**Adams:** That brought back... unpleasant memories. Kids used to ridicule me for wearing glasses like these. \n\n**Omega:** Kids can be insecure and take it out on others, they probably just found you to be the easiest target. It happened to me as well, but it ended when I beat the crap out of a popular kid. Good times, that was back when life was much simpler...\n\n**Beta:** They couldn't come up with a better insult than \"Harry Potter\"? Isn't he a hero?\n\n**Adams:** Regardless of their words, they intended it to hurt, so it did. I'd rather not discuss it further though, not on the job. \n\n//The group begins to approach the administrative section, where the principals office is located, they reach the front desk, where a staff member resembling an older female is sitting.//\n\n//They pass it and continue on to the administrative hallway.//\n\n**Instance:** Hey!

Agent omega prepares to use the battering ram once again, but as he does, the door opens, causing omega to hit an unknown target.//\n\n**Adams:** That has to be him, quickly, get in there and apprehend him. Be prepared to use lethal force. \n\n//Omega and Beta storm the room, with Adams following suit. A battered man is slumped against the wall.//\n\n**Unknown:** God damn it... who the hell are you?

Please stop.. No more..\n\n**Adams:** Then tell me,\n\n**Adams:** What the fuck is going on here? Is this your doing?\n\n//Biddle begins to cry and curl into a fetal position.//\n\n**Biddle:** I just wanted to relive those memories, I wanted them to be able to cherish what I couldn't, it wasn't meant to be this way...\n\n**Adams:** Don't you dare start crying, do you have any idea what kind of misery you have caused these kids? I have seen unspeakable things done unto them by each other, and your telling me it's your fault? You fucking bastard, I’m going to make you pay for this. \n\n//Adams begins hitting Biddle on the face and in the stomach where Omega’s battering ram impacted.//\n\n**Beta:** What the hell are you doing?

It is currently thought that if SCP-7285-3 had not been incapacitated by agent Omega, the incursion team would have succumbed to his effects. Currently, Biddle has been seriously damaged and lost the ability to speak after damage to the throat. The severity of memory alteration within SCP-7285 has begun to cease, but the physical alterations as well as anomalous traits have not lessened. Information concealment efforts have been put forward in response, and the school is set to close under the guise of structural failure soon. Upon closing, a permanent containment site can be set up around SCP-7285. Researcher Adams has been amnestisized and relocated due to his violent outburst and partial decommissioning of SCP-7285. \n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-7285-3 interview\" hide=\"SCP-7285-3 interview\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-7285-3 was given a notebook and pencil in order to respond to questions. Reality anchor is stationed within the holding area to prevent memory tampering on behalf of SCP-7285-3. Interview conducted by Researcher Winter.\n\n-----\n\n<Begin log>\n\n//Researcher Winter and SCP-7285-3 sit across from each other, separated only by a layer of bullet proof glass. A small slit is open at the bottom to allow for the passage of notes.//\n\n**Winter:** Alright, lets start off simple. Did you manipulate the memories of the incursion team in any way?\n\n//SCP-7285-3 scribbles something down on his paper before holding it up to the glass.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** Yes. But not how it works. Only manipulate memories in general area. Team caught in area, not intentional, but manipulated.\n\n**Winter:** And what exactly did this \"Memory Field\" alter? We have seen the effects, but what exactly was altered?\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** Childhood memories. Replaced with good better ones. \n\n**Winter:** I see, must have been pretty important for such a drastic change, eh? Anyways, why did you use your power in a high school of all things?\n\n//SCP-7285-3 sits in thought for a minute before writing a response.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** Memories fleeting. In retrospect, regret not spending time better. Make their memories last life time, to live out simpler times forever.\n\n**Winter:** So, you wanted to help them in a way? I see, interesting. But why specifically this school? \n\n**SCP-7285-3:** West hills anomalous, cover up my existence, not be found. \n\n**Winter:** You were aware of the foundation?\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** No, knew people hostile to anomaly, not specifics.\n\n**Winter:** Alright then. Were you aware of the significant personality alterations that spawned as a result of your meddling? \n\n//SCP-7285-3 holds up a full note sheet, signalling for more paper. Winter obliges.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** My power hard to control. Not precise, memories changed in very simple way. \n\n**Winter:** Did you consider that you may be doing more harm than good? I mean, by implanting false ones, you essentially prohibited them from making their own. \n\n//SCP-7285-3 sits for several seconds, before shedding a tear.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** No, did not consider. Regret much now, only wanted good.\n\n**Winter:** Yea, I gathered. You should have taken your victims into greater consideration before trying to help them. Thank you for your participation, I beli-\n\n//SCP-7285-3 slams a piece of paper against the window, reading the following.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** THEY WERE HAPPY\n\n**Winter:** I said we are done here. Your shortsightedness will not change anything, you buffoon. \n\n//SCP-7285-3 writes furiously before holding his paper up.//\n\n**SCP-7285-3:** I CREATED MEMORIES ONE COULD LOOK BACK ON AND BE COMFORTED BY REAL MEMORIES ONLY BRING DESPAIR AND UNCERTAINTY \n\n**Winter:** That is enough! This interview is concluded, end the recording Adrian. \n\n<End log>\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n| author=guiness11]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-7284]]] | SCP-7285 | [[[SCP-7286]]] >>\n[[/div]]",
