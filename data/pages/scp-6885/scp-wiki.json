The true size and length of the beach are currently unknown, as well as the nature of its two oceans. It is also currently unknown how one gains access to this anomaly, as the Foundation's only account of an entry into the space was unintentional. Foundation staff tasked with researching the anomaly theorize that there may be several specific steps one must take in order to gain access to the anomaly. However, Foundation agents assigned to SCP-6885 have yet to uncover these theoretical steps.\n\nSCP-6885 also houses one additional, sub-anomalous entity. A Limulus Polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab) capable of speech and, according to reports, significantly larger than average members of its species.\n\nSCP-6885 was discovered by Researcher August during a short sabbatical in Baymonte View. She was found by civilians wandering the beaches with no memory of the past day or her time spent inside of the anomaly. On her cellphone were several recordings and one picture. The recordings were taken by August and serve to document her time spent in the anomaly. They are transcribed below.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #1 - Discovery Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//When the recording starts, the camera is aimed toward the sand. When August speaks, she sounds out of breath. The sound of gentle waves lapping onshore can be heard in the background.//\n\n**August:** -alright. It’s alright. Come on, you know what to do. You know exactly what to do. You’ve been trained for this. Just… just have to remember. Remember what they told you. It’s going to be fine. Everything is going to be fine. Just follow the steps… first.\n\n//The camera flips. August is dressed in an open, short-sleeve button-up with a white tank top underneath and sunglasses resting atop her head. The strap of a small, leather satchel can be seen running across her torso. Behind her, a beach around 46 meters across stretches off into the distance with no beginning or end in sight. Two bodies of water with the appearance of oceans surround the beach on either side. August takes a deep breath.//\n\n**August:** My name is July August. I’m a researcher at the SCP Foundation and have been for the past year. I’m currently stationed at Site-78 where I study Type Greens, specifically their numerous manipulations and alterations of baseline reality. Yesterday, I left for an annual three-day trip I take to my hometown of Baymonte View- that’s Baymonte View, Virginia, by the way. I travel back here every year…\n\n//August trails off. She takes another deep breath.//\n\n**August:** …it doesn’t matter. A few hours ago, I was sitting on the beach when I decided that I… that I wanted to take a short walk. So, I started walking. And I walked, and walked, and walked. For hours, I’m guessing. My head just suddenly snapped up, like I… like I was coming out of a trance. I looked ahead and didn’t see any people, so I looked behind me and… there was nothing there.\n\n//The camera flips as August turns around.//\n\n**August:** Well, not nothing. Just… more beach. At first, I thought I’d just walked for //a lot// longer than I intended to, so I looked to my left for the beachfront houses. Just to see if they could tell me how far I’d walked.\n\n//August turns the camera to the left, showing the second ocean.//\n\n**August:** …and the houses were gone, too. I’ve just been walking on this beach for a while now, I… I don’t really know what to do…\n\n//The camera flips. August closes her eyes and takes a shuddering breath.//\n\n**August:** If I had to guess, I’ve accidentally entered some kind of… anomalous space. An endless beach, or… or a world that’s just sand and water…\n\n//The edges of her lips twitch.//\n\n**August:** …or maybe one of them put me here. Breached containment and I… I don’t know. My phone battery should last a while longer. I’m going to try and send these videos to my work computer, but… I doubt it’ll work. And I doubt anyone’s going to check. For now, I’ll just keep walking and try to document this as best I can-\n\n//August stops as the camera suddenly jolts to the right, towards one of the oceans.//\n\n**August:** Did you…\n\n//A dark shape slowly appears in the water and starts rapidly moving towards the shore. A Limulus Polyphemus (Atlantic horseshoe crab) emerges from the waves, crawling onto the sand and beginning to walk towards August. It appears larger than any other known species of its kind. The front of the entity’s (SCP-6885-1) body lifts.//\n\n**6885-1:** Hello-\n\n//The camera turns towards the ground as August begins to run. She runs for approximately 22 minutes before coming to a stop and dropping her phone onto the sand. She puts her hands on her knees, taking in gasping breaths of air. She stands and frantically looks around, paying close attention to the two oceans on either side of her. Immediately, she throws the satchel off her shoulder and drops to her knees, beginning to dig through it. She throws a bottle of sunscreen out and onto the sand. Then a small notebook, a bottle opener, and a pen.//\n\n//Finally, she pulls out a pocket knife. Her breathing quickens as she struggles to open the blade with shaking hands. Suddenly, she drops the knife and cries out. Its blade is coated in blood. August holds her right wrist with her left hand as a gash in her palm drips onto the sand. She begins to hyperventilate. In the ocean closest to her, a dark shape moves towards the shore. August scrambles for the knife, crying out again as she places her injured palm on the sand. She crawls several feet back with the knife in her left hand, pointed towards 6885-1. It emerges from the water.//\n\n**August:** STAY BACK, J-JUST GET THE FUCK BACK! DON’T COME ANY CLOSER!\n\n**6885-1:** Are you alright?\n\n//Slowly, August lowers the knife.//\n\n**August:** …what did you just say?\n\n//6885-1 moves forward and August lifts the knife, crawling several more feet back.//\n\n**August:** I-I said get away-\n\n//6885-1 moves back.//\n\n**6885-1:** I apologize. I just asked if you were alright.\n\n//August’s breathing begins to slow.//\n\n**August:** If I’m… alright?\n\n//6885-1’s body moves back and forth in an almost serpentine manner.//\n\n**6885-1:** Yes. I think you cut yourself.\n\n//Slowly, August lifts her right hand and takes a shuddering breath. She turns to one side and opens her satchel again, looking inside before immediately raising her left hand and pointing the knife at 6885-1.//\n\n**August:** Don’t fucking move.\n\n//6885-1 does not move. August digs through her satchel and around a minute later, curses and closes it, lifting her head towards 6885-1. Without taking her eyes off it, she places the knife between her teeth and rips a piece of cloth from her tank top. She places the knife on the ground next to her and blows as much sand off the wound as possible before wrapping it in the cloth and tying it in a knot. She picks up the knife and stands.//\n\n**6885-1:** …is that better?\n\n//August points the knife at 6885-1.//\n\n**August:** What are you?\n\n//6885-1 sighs. It’s similar to the chittering sound made by some mammals.//\n\n**6885-1:** Is that always the first question you ask when you meet someone?\n\n**August:** Answer. The. Question.\n\n**6885-1:** I… apologize for being brash. You just scared me a bit.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** //I// scared //you//?\n\n**6885-1:** Yes. You //are// the one currently threatening me with a knife, after all. But, it’s clear I also frightened you quite a bit. So… I apologize for that as well. And to answer your question, in all honesty, I… don’t really know what I am.\n\n**August:** …you’re a horseshoe crab.\n\n//6885-1 chitters again. It sounds lighter than before.//\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, I’ve been called that many times before. But it’s like trying to tell the sky it’s called the sky, or the beach it’s called the beach. When there’s only one of something, a name begins to lose its meaning.\n\n**August:** There are literally… //thousands// of beaches.\n\n**6885-1:** For you, maybe.\n\n//August takes a moment to look around at the beach and two oceans.//\n\n**August:** Speaking of beaches…\n\n//August suddenly straightens her arm again, pointing the knife at 6885-1. It moves back slightly.//\n\n**6885-1:** Again with the knife-\n\n**August:** …where the hell are we?\n\n//6885-1 begins to answer before August takes a step forward and interrupts.//\n\n**August:** …did you bring me here? Did you fucking bring me here?!\n\n**6885-1:** No, I don’t have that kind of power. I don’t control this place, nor do I control who walks its sand.\n\n**August:** And this place is…\n\n//August trails off.//\n\n**6885-1:** Home.\n\n//August keeps the knife pointed towards 6885-1 as she looks towards the ocean behind it.//\n\n**August:** So… are there more like you in this place? A… family or something?\n\n**6885-1:** No, it’s… it’s just me. And the occasional visitor, of course.\n\n//August begins to lower the knife.//\n\n**August:** And what are you called?\n\n**6885-1:** I’m called whatever the people who visit me here decide to call me. It’s like I said, when there’s only one of something, names begin to lose their meaning.\n\n**August:** So I… I could give you a name?\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** If you’d like to.\n\n//August thinks for a moment before responding.//\n\n**August:** …alright then. I’ll call you Dash One.\n\n**6885-1:** Dash One?\n\n**August:** Yeah. Where I’m from, we… designate things by number and order. And since you appear to be the only creature here…\n\n//August tightly grips the knife.//\n\n**August:** …if you’re not lying to me, that is… then that would make you Dash One.\n\n**6885-1:** Hm… it’s an interesting name, but I have a feeling it will grow on me.\n\n//August reaches down and picks up her satchel, putting it over her shoulder.//\n\n**August:** Alright then. If you don’t mind, I have some more questions for you, Dash One-\n\n**6885-1:** What’s your name?\n\n//August clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** …my name?\n\n**6885-1:** Yes! Unless you don’t have one, like me. In that case, I could give you a name if you’d-\n\n**August:** No no, I have one. I have one, it’s… it’s Dr. August.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Dr. August… okay. It’s nice to meet you!\n\n**August:** …right. Back to my questions-\n\n**6885-1:** Sure.\n\n//August pauses.//\n\n**August:** …actually-\n\n//August reaches down and picks her phone up off the sand. The camera flips.//\n\n**August:** -I’m going to start a new recording for our interview. So I’ll be back in-\n\n//The recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum - 1 (Missing Persons):** In this first recording, SCP-6885-1 claims that people besides August have gained entry into SCP-6885. This account does corroborate a missing person report filed in Baymonte View several years ago, in which the young man reported missing was found after two days and diagnosed with transient global amnesia by local specialists. However, this is the //only// account of another situation like August’s occurring in Baymonte View, though SCP-6885-1’s claims have led Foundation staff to believe that this has indeed occurred more than twice. If there are other entry points into SCP-6885, their locations are currently unknown. Requires further investigation.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #2 - Interview Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6885-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher July August\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//The recording returns. August places the camera down on the sand, leaning it up against her satchel. She sits down a small distance away so both her and 6885-1 are in frame. The knife rests in her lap.//\n\n**August:** Alright. Here’s what we know so far: I’m-\n\n**6885-1:** I apologize for interrupting so early on, but… could you please put the knife away? It’s making me a bit… uncomfortable.\n\n**August:** I… hm.\n\n//August very slowly closes the knife and places the folded blade into a pocket on the left breast of her short-sleeve button-up.//\n\n**August:** I’m afraid that’s the best I can do. Having it out may make you uncomfortable, but being defenseless in this new place also… makes me a bit jumpy. I figured this is a good compromise.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I completely understand. Thank you.\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** Okay then. So, here’s what we know: I’m in an extra-dimensional, anomalous space in the form of an endless strip of sand between two oceans. The space appears to be home to one other sub-anomalous entity, a horseshoe crab capable of speech.\n\n**6885-1:** …am I supposed to say something?\n\n//August continues.//\n\n**August:** It claims it cannot control the anomalous space, that it’s just a denizen of it. I may be somewhat new to the Foundation, but I’ve experienced altered reality enough times in my life to know what it feels like to be in an area where reality had been manipulated. This place… feels different than all the rest. Which makes me inclined to believe Dash One.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Thank you-\n\n//August clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** BUT… I can’t be entirely sure just yet. So, let’s get on with the interview. That is if you’re willing to comply.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I’m ready and willing, Dr. August.\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** Perfect. We’ll start with some history. How long have you been here, Dash One?\n\n//6885-1 thinks for a moment before responding.//\n\n**6885-1:** It’s… difficult to say. I rise when it’s light and rest when it’s dark. But as you can see, with the beach’s distinct lack of landmarks, it becomes quite the task to keep up with the flow of time.\n\n**August:** Have you ever tried?\n\n**6885-1:** I did, after first gaining consciousness. But it’s been so long, I… forgot when I stopped.\n\n//August hums.//\n\n**August:** So… it’s fair to say you’ve been here for quite some time. Years, maybe? Decades?\n\n**6885-1:** If I had to guess, you could count my life in single years.\n\n**August:** Great. So, you just mentioned something about “rising when it’s light, and resting when it’s dark?” It is light out right now, but I… can’t see the sun anywhere in the sky. Could you explain?\n\n**6885-1:** I really think that’s just a strange quirk of the beach with no real explanation. No explanation I could ever provide, that is. It’s been like this for as long as I can remember.\n\n**August:** …which leads us right into our next question: what is your earliest memory? Despite how long you’ve been here, you should at least have //some// memories from earlier in your life.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I do. My earliest memory is… of me, gliding along the ocean floor toward shore.\n\n//August waits for a moment.//\n\n**August:** …that’s it?\n\n**6885-1:** That’s it. I was the same back then as I am now.\n\n**August:** So, your earliest memory is of you fully formed. You haven’t grown at all since then?\n\n**6885-1:** I don’t think so... but, then again, I have nothing really to measure my growth with.\n\n**August:** …what about the others who have ended up here? Earlier, you said you were the only one here.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Right.\n\n**August:** But you also mentioned “the occasional visitor.” Could you explain that a bit more?\n\n**6885-1:** Of course. Every once in a while, someone will find themselves on my beach. I usually watch them from a distance for a while before I approach… most of them just run, not unlike yourself. But… you stayed to talk, which I appreciate. Thank you.\n\n**August:** And do you know how those people ended up on the beach?\n\n**6885-1:** I’m sorry, but I don’t. I always just find them after they’ve already gotten here.\n\n//August hums.//\n\n**August:** I know I asked you this before, but… where is //here//?\n\n**6885-1:** I… really don’t know. When you’ve lived in one place your whole life, you never really learn where it stands in the grand scheme of things.\n\n**August:** Haven’t you ever tried just swimming out from shore in a straight line until you find something?\n\n**6885-1:** I have, it’s just…\n\n//August waits for a moment.//\n\n**August:** …what is it?\n\n//6885-1 chitters. It sounds low and dull.//\n\n**6885-1:** I really do think I’m the only thing here. And the thought of missing someone walking the beach always managed to bring me back before I went too far… even if they all just run from me.\n\n**August:** …sounds lonely.\n\n**6885-1:** It’s alright. I manage.\n\n**August:** So… if you’re the only thing here, how do you survive?\n\n**6885-1:** I’m afraid I don’t know that, either. I guess I’ve just never really had to worry about dying before.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Must be nice… alright, I’ve got one more question for you.\n\n**6885-1:** Ask away.\n\n//August takes a deep breath.//\n\n**August:** If you really aren’t controlling this place… do you know how I can leave it?\n\n//6885-1 moves slowly back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** …I’m sorry, I don’t-\n\n//August groans and puts her head down onto her lap, grabbing at her hair with both hands.//\n\n**6885-1:** -but, I know people who //have// left the beach before.\n\n//August’s head snaps up.//\n\n**August:** Really? How?\n\n**6885-1:** That’s the part I don’t know. But I’ve watched it happen from the water. They’ll be walking along and suddenly they just… fade away. I’m assuming it’s back to where they came from, but… I guess there’s no real way of knowing.\n\n//August sighs.//\n\n**August:** And you know what they say about assuming…\n\n//6885-1 waits for a moment.//\n\n**6885-1:** I… I don’t. I don’t know what they say about assuming.\n\n//August hums.//\n\n**August:** So… they just suddenly begin to fade away? Like, vanish?\n\n**6885-1:** Yes.\n\n**August:** In that case… I guess I really don’t have much of a choice. I can’t just sit here forever.\n\n//August stands, picks up her phone, and slings the satchel over her shoulder.//\n\n**August:** Alright then, Dash One. I’m just… going to keep walking and see what happens.\n\n//August begins to walk down the strip of sand. 6885-1 follows shortly behind her.//\n\n**6885-1:** Would you… mind if I walked with you, Dr. August?\n\n//August stops and 6885-1 stops behind her. She thinks for a moment… before sighing, nodding, and continuing down the beach.//\n\n**August:** Sure.\n\n//6885-1 follows close behind. The recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #3 - Exploration Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//When the recording returns, August and 6885-1 are walking on the beach. It is unclear how much time has passed.//\n\n**6885-1:** …Dr. August, would you mind if I asked //you// a question? I’ve just… been wondering about this since our interview.\n\n//August thinks for a moment before shrugging.//\n\n**August:** I… I guess not.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Thank you. I’ve just noticed that you’re dressed similar to the other people I’ve seen on the beach and yet… you seem more organized than them. More focused. Why is that?\n\n//August sighs.//\n\n**August:** That’s probably because my life for the past year has been nothing //but// organization and focus.\n\n**6885-1:** Hm. I’m guessing it has something to do with your job? With the people you performed our interview for?\n\n**August:** …yeah. You could say that. How could you tell?\n\n**6885-1:** When you gave me my name earlier, you said that “//we// designate things by number and order.” I just felt that there was something… a bit larger than life behind that.\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** Well, you’d be right in feeling that way. I’d… rather not get into it all now, but I work for a Foundation that studies things that are out of the ordinary. Things that don’t follow the known laws of our universe. Like you and your home, for example.\n\n**6885-1:** How do my home and I not follow your universe’s laws?\n\n**August:** Well… I’m sure you’ve heard this all before, but where I’m from, beaches aren’t this long and horseshoe crabs can’t speak… and they’re a bit smaller, I think. It’s been a while since I’ve seen one.\n\n**6885-1:** How fascinating… and you said you were a doctor at this “Foundation” earlier, right?\n\n//August slowly nods.//\n\n**August:** …right.\n\n**6885-1:** What kind of medicine would a standard doctor of your profession practice?\n\n**August:** Well, these kinds of doctors don’t typically study medicine. Some do, but only when a certain medicine or disease falls into that category of being considered out of the ordinary. Most of us study different aspects of the anomalous. For example, I study any and all manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n//6885-1 stops.//\n\n**6885-1:** …wha-\n\n**August:** I study places that are out of the ordinary and people or objects with the power to //make// things out of the ordinary.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** I see. So you thought //I// was one of those people or objects and that //I// created the beach.\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** Exactly.\n\n**6885-1:** And how does one even begin to study a field like that?\n\n**August:** Typically, you’d start by studying how our world functions the way it’s supposed to. If you truly know what laws govern our natural world, you begin to understand how those laws can be bent to their breaking point.\n\n**6885-1:** That sounds incredibly difficult! …and I can assure you that I am not one of those creatures who hold this power. If I was, I would never be the only one here.\n\n//August hums.//\n\n**August:** I think I believe you…\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** …or maybe I’ve just finally lost it.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I don’t think you’re crazy for trusting me.\n\n**August:** In my line of work, that thought could get you killed.\n\n//6885-1 chitters. It’s low and drawn out.//\n\n**6885-1:** …sounds lonely.\n\n**August:** I manage.\n\n//The recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #4 - Exploration Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The recording returns. August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes. It is unclear how much time has passed.//\n\n**6885-1:** …Dr. August?\n\n//August takes a moment to respond.//\n\n**August:** Hm?\n\n**6885-1:** If your job is to study places like this and creatures like me… then why were you so surprised when you arrived? I would’ve thought that in your field, this is a somewhat common occurrence.\n\n**August:** Well… you wouldn’t //necessarily// be wrong. Of course, anyone who works for the Foundation is always at risk of the anomalous. It’s just… I’m relatively new to all of this, only a year in.\n\n**6885-1:** Ah. I see.\n\n**August:** And I didn’t come here on purpose. I wasn’t even working when it happened, it was just… an accident. I didn’t //want// to end up here. I didn’t //want// this.\n\n//6885-1 doesn’t respond. August sighs.//\n\n**August:** Shit. I’m sorry, I… you’ve been very helpful so far, it’s just… this was supposed to be a special time for me.\n\n**6885-1:** …special how?\n\n**August:** When you work for the Foundation, especially when you’re as new as I am, you don’t get a ton of time off. Only three vacation days a year. I always use those days to travel back to Baymonte View whenever life gets particularly… stressful. And when I got here yesterday, it was because life had gotten //particularly// stressful. I come because this place is familiar. Relaxing. For me, it’s… it’s home. \n\n**6885-1:** …oh.\n\n**August:** So to end up in a place like this when the one thing I needed more than anything was familiarity…\n\n//August trails off. 6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I understand now. I apologize for bringing it up.\n\n//August sighs.//\n\n**August:** No, it’s… it’s okay. You didn’t know. I’m… sorry I said that.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** It’s alright, there’s no need to apologize. We’re all just trying to make the best of a strange situation.\n\n//August laughs, softly.//\n\n**August:** Ain’t that the truth…\n\n//August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several more minutes.//\n\n**August:** …you know, I actually grew up in Baymonte View.\n\n**6885-1:** Really?\n\n**August:** Yeah! My parents raised me just a few blocks away from the beach… //our// beach, I should say. There was only one ocean.\n\n//6885-1 looks to its left and right at the two oceans. It chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Weird.\n\n**August:** We would go to the beach practically every weekend… some days we would swim. Others, we would just sit and read. Enjoy the sun.\n\n**6885-1:** So that’s why you come back. To visit your family.\n\n//August sighs.//\n\n**August:** …no, actually. They don’t live in Baymonte View anymore.\n\n**6885-1:** Hm. Where are they now? …if you’re comfortable sharing.\n\n**August:** Yeah, it’s… it’s fine. They’re… somewhere in South Dakota.\n\n**6885-1:** …you don’t know where?\n\n//August clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** We… don’t really keep in touch anymore.\n\n**6885-1:** …oh. I’m so sorry to hear that.\n\n**August:** …yeah.\n\n**6885-1:** Did… something happen?\n\n**August:** I just… I got the job with the Foundation and, as I said, that keeps me busy pretty much all year round. I can only manage to sneak away for those three days and it’s always to come back here. And the work I do with the Foundation… they //can’t// know about it. Nobody can, only people the Foundation trusts to welcome into its ranks. If the things we study ever got out into the public, it… it would not be good. Mass hysteria and panic would be the least of our problems. Piles of bodies taller than skyscrapers would probably be closer to the top of the list.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** That sounds like a difficult situation.\n\n//August sighs and rubs both of her eyes.//\n\n**August:** Yeah. It is.\n\n**6885-1:** And these things you study, the… reality mix-\n\n**August:** Any and all manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n**6885-1:** Right. They’re… really that dangerous?\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** No, they’re //worse// than dangerous. Trust me, you do not want to know.\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, I… I don’t think I do. But your parents, what do they think you do every day?\n\n**August:** They think I have some government desk job. And it needs to stay that way. It’s better for them. Safer.\n\n**6885-1:** But you’re their daughter! Do you really think they care about what’s better or safer for //them//?\n\n//August doesn’t respond. 6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** I apologize. It appears I’ve overstepped-\n\n**August:** What were you going to say?\n\n**6885-1:** Hm? What-\n\n**August:** I’m pretty sure you were just about to ask a question. I interrupted.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** …oh! Right. I was just going to ask you how somebody gets involved with your particular field. It just seems awfully specific.\n\n**August:** It’s… kind of a funny story. Like I was saying before, I study people with the ability to create things out of the ordinary or //make// ordinary things out of the ordinary. We call them “reality benders.”\n\n**6885-1:** Reality benders…\n\n**August:** Yeah. And I became interested in studying them because… well, I met one when I was a child. Right here, in Baymonte View.\n\n**6885-1:** That must be an amazing story.\n\n**August:** It is… it’s amazing to me.\n\n**6885-1:** Would you… care to share it?\n\n//August thinks for several moments before responding. She sighs.//\n\n**August:** So, I grew up in Baymonte View with my parents. And growing up in a town right on the beach… you’d think it would be great! …at first. But besides going to the beach, it becomes a bit of a struggle to find things to do. So when looking for more ways to get out of the house and explore a bit, my parents found a small hiking trail through some woods about a 12-minute walk from our house. It seemed perfect… we must’ve walked that trail at least a dozen times. I knew it like I knew the back of my hand, I…\n\n//August trails off.//\n\n**6885-1:** …are you alright?\n\n//August clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** Fine. It’s just…\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Looking back on it, I… never mind. One day, and I was nine years old when this happened, my parents were… working around the house? Doing something, I just remember that they were busy. And I… was bored. I figured since we’d walked the trail so many times before, I could easily do it on my own. It’s funny… when you’re a kid, you aspire to have more responsibility than any one person should. And when you’re all grown up, you wish you had none… like when you were a kid… while my parents were distracted, I put my shoes on and walked out the door. And don’t get me wrong, Baymonte View was a pretty safe town back then, all things considered. But still… a nine-year-old walking down the street alone? I’m almost more surprised that I wasn’t kidnapped.\n\n**6885-1:** But you weren’t, right? You made it to the trail?\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** I did. And everything was going to be fine… I can’t really remember when it all went wrong. I must’ve taken a wrong turn or missed one of those red markings on the trees that signaled what path the trail followed. The only thing I remember was that all at once, I was struck with a terrifying realization. All the times I had walked this trail, and yet… I’d never //really// walked its terrain. I’d always just followed my parents as //they// walked it. A half-hour and several more wrong turns later and the tears began to flow. I had no idea where I was.\n\n**6885-1:** …that must’ve been really scary.\n\n**August:** It was! It was //terrifying//.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** I remember thinking that if I didn’t make it back before sunset, a monster was going to chase me down and eat me or something…\n\n//August’s laughter slowly fades.//\n\n**August:** …you know, I used to think that thought was ridiculous. Just the fears of a child…\n\n**6885-1:** …we can stop if you’d like.\n\n//August takes a deep breath.//\n\n**August:** It’s alright. Thank you, though.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Of course.\n\n**August:** Where was I…\n\n**6885-1:** Lost in the woods.\n\n**August:** Right! I had no idea where I was or where to go and… I started crying. I cried and wandered in that forest for what felt like days. In reality, I’m sure it was only around an hour. But as a kid, time always seemed to move slower. Or maybe it could just never keep up with //us//… it was after that first hour that I heard him. It started as just rustling leaves behind me and snapping twigs on either side of me, all of which I ran from. In my mind, a snapped twig was a pack of angry wolves on the hunt for its next meal. But eventually… my legs gave out and I was forced to stop. I stopped in a small clearing with a little pond and massive tree that blanketed everything around it in a cool shade. I heard the rustling again, so I hid behind the trunk of the tree, only peeking out every few seconds to see if I could catch a glimpse of whatever this thing in the woods was… and eventually, I did. It was a man. Just… a man.\n\n**6885-1:** There must’ve been //something// strange about this man, something that tipped you off that he wasn’t normal?\n\n**August:** Yes… what first struck me as odd was the way he walked. He didn’t move between the trees like I did, no. The trees seemed almost to move //around// him. Like we weren’t walking through a forest, but the forest just so happened to occupy //his// space. But… aside from that, he looked entirely ordinary. Dirty blonde hair, if I’m remembering correctly. Normal height and weight, wearing a green jacket, brown pants, and black boots. Like… like someone you’d pass on the street and not even blink at.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** What he did next, though… I think that will stick with me forever. I remember… he walked around the clearing for around five minutes, scanning the ground as if looking for something he’d dropped. Finally, he reached down and picked up a small stone, around palm-sized and covered with spots of moss. He carried the stone to the pond and kneeled down at the edge of the water, holding the stone towards the ground. I blinked and… and the stone was gone. In its place was a small, young turtle, around the same size as the stone with a shell covered in spots of moss! The turtle slowly climbed out of the man’s hand and swam into the pond where it vanished under the water’s surface. I let out a small gasp, and… he whipped around and caught me peeking out from behind the tree.\n\n**6885-1:** Was he angry that you were watching him?\n\n//August shakes her head, adopting a small smile.//\n\n**August:** No… the opposite, actually. He smiled and gently beckoned me forward, out of my hiding spot. I walked out from behind the tree in a strange mix of fear, and embarrassment that I had been caught. He hummed to himself, again turning his focus towards the ground beneath him while I just stood there, unable to move. After a few seconds, he picked up a handful of dead leaves from the dirt and cupped them between his hands. He closed his eyes for a moment, and when he opened them… I could hear a soft whistle coming from where the leaves were. He opened his hands and… a small bird flew out! Its feathers were a mix of reds, yellows, oranges, and dark greens. The bird flew from the man's hands and landed on my shoulder. It poked its beak through my hair and nuzzled against my cheek. I laughed and the man laughed with me. The bird chirped and whispered into my ear with the most melodious voice I’ve ever heard… “Are you lost?” “It’s going to be okay.” “You’re doing great!”\n\n//August falls silent. A few moments later, she continues.//\n\n**August:** After around a minute, the bird flew from my shoulder and landed back in one of the man’s palms. He cupped his other hand over the small creature and when he reopened them, a small pile of dead leaves fell to the ground. I laughed and clapped, and the man smiled again and gave me a wink. He pointed towards one side of the clearing, and… there was a path there, leading through the trees. A path that I could’ve //sworn// hadn’t been there just moments before. The man turned to me and nodded, and I understood with no words spoken that that was the path he wanted me to walk. I nodded back and thanked the man, too young and naive to fully comprehend the gravity of what I’d just seen. The man placed his hands in his pockets and said this: “If you follow the right path… you’ll never be lost again.”\n\n**6885-1:** And did you? Follow his path, that is?\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** I did. I had walked for around 20 minutes when suddenly, almost as quickly as I had gotten lost… I was out of the forest. Another 12 minutes and I was back at my house. When I walked inside, my mother was sitting at our kitchen table balling her eyes out while my father was on the phone with the police. Apparently, I’d been gone for five hours. I… wasn’t allowed out much for the next few months, and never alone. Especially after telling my parents about the “strange man” I’d met in the woods.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** I was too young to understand how that was the //last thing// a parent wants to hear after their child goes missing…\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, I can see how that could’ve been… distressing.\n\n**August:** Totally. So… yeah. That’s how I became interested in the many manipulations and alterations of baseline reality.\n\n**6885-1:** Really? Just like that?\n\n**August:** Well… no, I guess not. From that moment on, I… became kind of obsessed. At first, I just wanted to find the man again so I could thank him for his help. Ask him if he could do all of those amazing things for me again… but as I grew older, my obsession slowly spiraled more into //how// what he did was even possible. I spent practically every waking moment reading everything I could get my hands on, even if I was reading someone’s crackpot internet theories. I put all my energy into academia and eventually… it just paid off. I was approached by the Foundation and offered a job. And… I accepted. With the increased pay, I helped my parents with the move. House became too big for the two of them, I guess. And that… that was the last time we spoke.\n\n**6885-1:** So, all of your hard work paid off.\n\n**August:** Yeah, it… it did. And after joining the Foundation, the first thing I did was check to see if they had the man I’d met in the forest in containment. They-\n\n//6885-1 chitters, interrupting August.//\n\n**6885-1:** Containment?\n\n**August:** Oh, right! Yes, that’s what our Foundation does. We locate places, people, or objects that fall outside of normalcy, contain those things to the best of our ability, and study them so we can better understand how they work. It keeps them safe, as well as the rest of humanity. We die in the dark, so they can live in the light.\n\n**6885-1:** Hm. Are you… going to contain me?\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Maybe, if I knew how I even got here in the first place. But if everything you’ve told me so far is true, I wouldn’t worry too much. You’d most likely be a Safe class anomaly or minor Euclid. Once we discover how people end up here, I have to imagine it would be pretty simple to stop. The most you’d have to put up with is an occasional interview from another Foundation researcher… or a doctor, like myself.\n\n**6885-1:** Interesting…\n\n**August:** Yeah! And who knows, maybe I’ll even be assigned to watch over you. \n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** I would enjoy that very much. But first, I must apologize. I believe I interrupted you.\n\n**August:** Wha-\n\n**6885-1:** Something about trying to locate the man you’d met in the forest?\n\n//August thinks for a moment before responding.//\n\n**August:** Ah, right. The Foundation, they… they didn’t have him. I uhhh… never saw him again, after the forest. Instead, I was assigned to… something else…\n\n//August trails off.//\n\n**6885-1:** …are you alright-\n\n**August:** Fine. Just… could we not talk about work stuff?\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Of course.\n\n**August:** …thank you.\n\n//August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes. August laughs, softly.//\n\n**August:** …you know, they send me cards on every holiday. Valentine’s Day, Saint Patrick’s Day, my birthday. Even Easter, and I don’t remember them taking me to church //once//.\n\n**6885-1:** …and what do the cards say?\n\n//August sighs and crosses her arms over her chest.//\n\n**August:** …that they’re sorry for whatever they did wrong. Whatever they did to push me away. That they completely understand how important my new job is, and how busy I probably am… that they wish I would talk to them about it so we could figure everything out together.\n\n//6885-1 doesn’t respond. August continues.//\n\n**August:** But they don’t understand. //I// barely understand. I just know that the closer they are to me, the more danger they’re in. And I… I’ve caused them more than enough trouble already.\n\n**6885-1:** …it’s like I said. You’re their daughter, Dr. August. They don’t care about any danger to them. If they believe //you// to be in danger, however… I have to imagine they would swim through the deepest, darkest oceans for only the slightest chance to help. It’s what parents do. And I… I don’t think you’re in any position to stop them.\n\n//August doesn’t respond. Minutes later, she holds her left hand above her eyes.//\n\n**August:** It looks like the sun is beginning to set… or whatever controls the light here.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Yes… it looks like it. How is your hand feeling?\n\n**August:** What?\n\n**6885-1:** Your hand, the one you cut earlier. Does it feel any better?\n\n**August:** Huh…\n\n//August lifts her right hand.//\n\n**August:** You know, I… I kind of forgot about it. I guess that means it has to be feeling better, right?\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, I believe so. I’m glad.\n\n//Slowly, August turns her phone towards the ocean. The water is bathed in a soft, orange glow.//\n\n**August:** …it’s very beautiful here.\n\n**6885-1:** Yes… I think so, too.\n\n//The recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #5 - Exploration Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The recording returns. August and 6885-1 walk in silence for several minutes before she clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** …hey, Dash One? Can I tell you something?\n\n**6885-1:** Of course, Dr. August.\n\n//August cringes slightly and sighs.//\n\n**August:** I… haven’t been entirely honest with you. I’m sorry.\n\n//6885-1 stops for a moment before continuing to move forward.//\n\n**6885-1:** …oh. What haven’t you been honest about?\n\n**August:** The thing is… I’m not really a doctor at the Foundation. I’m just a researcher. \n\n**6885-1:** Is there a big difference between the two positions?\n\n**August:** …honestly, not really. It’s just… becoming a doctor with the Foundation takes much more time and effort. Sure, a promotion could come from an achievement, like creating containment procedures that completely neutralize the risk of a Keter class-\n\n//6885-1 stops for a moment and looks up August.//\n\n**August:** -don’t worry about it. But most times, it really is just how long you’ve worked with them. How well you know their operations. Becoming a doctor //does// have its perks, though. Access to restricted files, field agents… stuff like that. But… I’m not a doctor. I haven’t earned it, so I should stop pretending to be one.\n\n**6885-1:** Why did you lie in the first place?\n\n//August shrugs.//\n\n**August:** I… really couldn’t tell you. I think it just… made me feel safer? If that makes any sense. I was trapped in this new and strange place, so maybe if I acted like I had the experience and wisdom they do, the //power// they do… I would know what to do and how to react.\n\n**6885-1:** Well, if it makes //you// feel better and doesn’t really hurt anyone… I don’t think it’s that bad of a lie.\n\n**August:** Yeah, maybe not. But now I just feel… kind of icky.\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Okay, Researcher August.\n\n**August:** Ehhh… too wordy. You can just call me July.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** July August?\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Hey, you can take it up with Mr. and Mrs. August.\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, that is quite an… unusual name.\n\n**August:** Says the crab with no name at all.\n\n**6885-1:** …fair enough. Though, I have been //given// names before.\n\n**August:** Oh yeah? Then I can’t be the only one with a weird name. You must’ve picked up some strange ones, right?\n\n**6885-1:** Yes…\n\n//6885-1 stops for a moment.//\n\n**6885-1:** …somebody called me a god, once. I… didn’t really like that one.\n\n//August hums.//\n\n**August:** Yes… I can see how that would be uncomfortable.\n\n//6885-1 continues to walk.//\n\n**6885-1:** But July August is more unusual than most, is it not?\n\n**August:** I guess so. My dad and my friends growing up always used to just call me Jules, though. Well… most of my friends. This one girl I met in college just //insisted// on calling me Auggie, no matter how many times I told her not to!\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** It’s kind of a funny story. We met at this super shitty dorm party sophomore year. It wasn’t really my scene, and it was clear she’d had a bit too much to drink, so I offered to walk her back to her room. From there, it’s like… I just started seeing her everywhere. Or maybe I just began to notice… anyway, once I properly introduced myself, it was Auggie from that point on. A few months before graduation, I asked her why she called me that. She told me that when we’d met, she had been taking a Latin class. She said it was because the meaning of the name Auggie was “great, or magnificent…”\n\n//6885-1 waits for a moment before responding.//\n\n**6885-1:** …she sounds like a great friend.\n\n//August clears her throat.//\n\n**August:** …y-yeah. Yeah, she was. Morgan was… a great friend.\n\n//6885-1 stops and looks up at August.//\n\n**August:** …don’t give me that look, Dash One.\n\n**6885-1:** What look?\n\n**August:** You know exactly the look I’m talking-\n\n//The recording cuts. When it returns, August and 6885-1 are walking on the beach in silence. The sky has gotten darker.//\n\n**6885-1:** So, how is Morgan doing with all of this?\n\n**August:** W-what?\n\n**6885-1:** Morgan, your… friend. How does she handle working for your Foundation?\n\n**August:** Oh no, she… she doesn’t work for the Foundation.\n\n**6885-1:** Ah. I apologize. From the way you spoke of her, I figured-\n\n//August quickly interrupts.//\n\n**August:** You figured wrong. I… haven’t talked with her in a while. We got into a pretty big argument a few months ago…\n\n**6885-1:** …oh. I’m so sorry. We don’t have to talk about it if it’s too much-\n\n**August:** Well, it was mostly the same fight I had with my parents. Morgan can’t know what I do with the Foundation, so… she’s safer this way. Without me. And that’s the end of it.\n\n//6885-1 hums.//\n\n**6885-1:** I’m still a bit confused about those rules, if you wouldn’t mind clarifying them for me?\n\n**August:** What rules?\n\n**6885-1:** The rule your Foundation enforces where you’re not allowed to see your family, friends, or loved ones. It just seems like a steep price to pay for the knowledge you seek.\n\n**August:** …there’s no rule about not seeing them. They just can’t know what work we do for the Foundation.\n\n**6885-1:** …oh. So, what were you two fighting about?\n\n**August:** I had decided to move closer to the Foundation Site I work at, and… Morgan wanted to come with me.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** //That’s// why you argued?\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Of course it is! I had to shoot the idea down before it had the chance to become anything more than that.\n\n**6885-1:** But… why wouldn’t you want her to go with you?\n\n**August:** Didn’t you listen when I told you about my parents? The work I do is dangerous! The more she followed me down that road, the more danger I was putting her in.\n\n**6885-1:** Danger of what? Her finding out what you do?\n\n**August:** Her finding out was the least of my worries.\n\n**6885-1:** Then you still could’ve been with her-\n\n**August:** You don’t understand. The danger doesn’t come from her //finding out// what we do… it just comes from what we do.\n\n**6885-1:** How is what you do dangerous? Isn’t your Foundation supposed to //contain// these things that-\n\n**August:** Stop talking about things you don’t understand. Our Foundation is the last line of defense against an unending wave of an apocalyptic magnitude. And when that wave manages to bleed through our defenses, //we’re// going to be the first things standing in their way. My parents… Morgan. I don’t want them anywhere near that! They can’t be.\n\n**6885-1:** That… that sounds awful. Why would you ever choose to do something like that?\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** I’d dedicated my //entire// life to this research. I wasn’t going to trip at the finish line. I was an idiot, though… I thought… I just thought they would all be like him.\n\n//6885-1 doesn’t respond. August continues.//\n\n**August:** People with extraordinary gifts… who turned stones into turtles, or leaves into songbirds. Who helped lost children find their way out of the forest. But that… that is not what greeted me at the Foundation’s doors.\n\n**6885-1:** Then why didn’t you leave?\n\n**August:** Because nobody ever leaves. Once we learned of our mission, learned just how… //important// the work we were going to do was… nobody left.\n\n**6885-1:** But is this work worth everything? Your family? Your-\n\n**August:** You act like I //want// to do this! Like I //want// to spend day, after day, after day studying these creatures that wear human skin and can erase people from existence with the blink of an eye! I do it because I //have// to! Because we of the Foundation have a duty and obligation to shield the rest of humanity from those unnatural who seek to do us harm.\n\n**6885-1:** …that’s an awfully heavy burden to-\n\n**August:** Of course it’s a heavy burden to shoulder! But it’s one that we have to… alone.\n\n**6885-1:** Your logic is flawed. Your task of safeguarding humanity is doomed to fail if your Foundation continues to cut itself off from what makes its people human in the first place. \n\n**August:** I think about them. EVERY. DAY. I’m doing this. FOR. THEM. Every night, my dreams are plagued with thoughts of what would happen to Morgan if one of these merciless, satanic, death-worshipping creatures escaped containment. To my parents. It wouldn’t be fair to them.\n\n**6885-1:** …to them? It’s not fair to y-\n\n**August:** It’s not fair to anybody! You say someone called you a god once? You’re fucking insane. //We// contain actual gods, real gods. BARELY. \n\n**6885-1:** So cutting them off completely is your solution? If you truly care about them, you’ll come to realize that it’s not your choice to make. If they want to be there, they’ll find a way-\n\n**August:** Yeah? And what the //fuck// do you know? You’re just another one of them. So don’t lecture me about my life and my relationships when the longest conversation you’ve ever had is the one you’re having right now. Like it even matters. Once we figure out how to shove you and this entire place into a box, you’ll just be another number. Just a drop in the bucket of things that shouldn’t exist. If I were you, I’d savor this. It’s going to be a very long time before you speak to anyone else, //Dash One//.\n\n//6885-1 stops and looks up at August. Her breathing is erratic and shallow. 6885-1 turns forward and continues walking down the beach.

When she speaks, her voice is barely above a whisper.//\n\n**August:** …I’m sorry. About what I said before. I’m sorry.\n\n//6885-1 does not respond.//\n\n**August:** I’m… I’m //terrified//, okay? You really do have //no// idea about the things we contain. The things we only //just// manage to contain…\n\n//Tears begin to drip from August’s eyes.//\n\n**August:** I thought it would be easy, I thought… I thought they would all be like him. Do you know what I’ve heard them describe most of these reality benders as? “Child-Gods.” I’ve seen what they can do to people, what they //have// done to people, even outside of the stories. I can’t-\n\n//August chokes out a sob.//\n\n**August:** I can’t let that happen to her. To them. I can’t. I wouldn’t survive it. At least this way… I know they’re safe.\n\n//August places her head onto her lap as sobs silently rack her body.//\n\n**6885-1:** …do you know what I don’t think I’ll ever understand?\n\n//August’s head snaps up. She stares at 6885-1 for several moments before responding.//\n\n**August:** …what?\n\n**6885-1:** The people who you choose and don’t choose to put your trust into. When you first arrived on the beach and thought //I// was the one who controlled it, thought //I// was the one keeping you here… I can understand that mistrust. But the lack of faith you have in the people you love most… I don’t think that will ever make sense to me.\n\n//August wipes at her eyes with the back of her hand.//\n\n**August:** I-it’s not that I don’t trust them… I don’t trust myself! I don’t trust myself not to let them get too close… to put them in harm’s way.\n\n**6885-1:** And what about your Foundation? Isn’t it their sole purpose to protect humanity from these things? Don’t you even trust your own people?\n\n**August:** …the fact that I’m here right now is proof enough that I can’t trust them as much as I thought I could. I know this is the right thing to do, the right path to walk-\n\n**6885-1:** But that’s not your choice to make! You can’t force the people who truly love you to stay away, not for long at least.\n\n//August falls silent. 6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** …if I had a family like that and a person like Morgan in my life… I would never let them go. NEVER.\n\n**August:** …even if you holding on killed them?\n\n**6885-1:** Then you quit. Get rid of the danger altogether.\n\n**August:** I can’t quit! Even if I wanted to leave, I’ve seen what happens to the people who do. They take their memories from them. I can’t lose everything I’ve learned… it’s all I am.\n\n**6885-1:** …but look at yourself. You carry the weight of the world on your shoulders and refuse to share that weight with the people in your life who want nothing more than to help you.\n\n//August slowly tucks her head between her legs and grabs two fistfuls of her hair with her hands. Her voice shakes when she speaks.//\n\n**August:** No… no, this has to be right, it has to be! I’m on the right path, I’m //staying// on the right path. I know I am. Because if I follow the right path… I’ll never be lost again.\n\n//6885-1 chitters and moves closer to August.//\n\n**6885-1:** Oh, July…\n\n//August slowly looks up towards 6885-1.//\n\n**6885-1:** Just because you’re walking the right path, doesn’t mean you have to do it alone.\n\n//Tears begin to drip again.//\n\n**August:** …but I am alone.\n\n**6885-1:** …no, I don’t think so. I’ve been here the whole time, haven’t I? Right under your nose.\n\n//August slowly nods.//\n\n**6885-1:** …and they’re here for you, too. It doesn’t have to start big. Just… a message. Something that says you’ve been thinking about them, and you miss them. Something that says… I’m sorry.\n\n**August:** I’m sorry… I’m so sorry…\n\n//August’s breathing relaxes but tears continue to drip down her cheeks.//\n\n**August:** …can we stay here for a little while longer? This place really is wonderful.\n\n//6885-1 chitters.//\n\n**6885-1:** Of course.\n\n//The recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Recording #7 - Recovery Log\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The recording returns. The sky is bright. August stands and stretches.//\n\n**August:** What’d you say we keep walking, Dash One?\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** I’m ready when you are, July.\n\n//August nods and the pair begins to walk. They walk in silence for around a half-hour. August whistles.//\n\n**August:** I’ll tell you what… when we get back, I’m going to sleep like a newborn.\n\n**6885-1:** Me as well. I am tired both physically… //and// mentally.\n\n**August:** You said it.\n\n//6885-1 stops. Moments later, August stops as well, turning around to face it.//\n\n**August:** What? What is it?\n\n**6885-1:** You may get your wish sooner rather than later. Look…\n\n//August turns and looks down the beach ahead. Around a hundred meters in front of them, the sand on the beach begins to make a sharp turn left, creating another beach and cutting off one of the oceans. Another hundred meters after the new beach, the geography begins to resemble that of baseline reality.//\n\n**August:** Oh… I guess that means we’re coming to the end?\n\n**6885-1:** Yes, it does. Please, don’t sound //too// thrilled about it.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** Sorry, sorry… it’s just… I thought it would be a bit longer.\n\n**6885-1:** Selfishly, I had secretly //hoped// it would be a bit longer. I apologize.\n\n//August shakes her head.//\n\n**August:** No need. I think… I think I hoped for that too. If only just a bit.\n\n**6885-1:** …thank you. From this point on, I believe I know what happens. If you continue to walk farther down the beach, at some point… you will begin to fade.\n\n//August nods.//\n\n**August:** Alright then. Until that time… let’s keep walking.\n\n//August and 6885-1 continue to walk in silence. Around eight minutes later, August staggers back and grabs her head.//\n\n**August:** Ahhh…\n\n**6885-1:** Are you alright?\n\n**August:** Fine, fine… it’s just my head… just a wave of a migraine, it should pass in a moment…\n\n//6885-1 avoids looking towards August.//\n\n**August:** …Dash One? Are //you// alright?\n\n**6885-1:** I’m… okay.\n\n**August:** Are you sure? I’ve never seen you act like this before. Almost… bashful.\n\n**6885-1:** …I’m sure.\n\n//August crouches down and leans in towards 6885-1. It shies away.//\n\n**August:** …what aren’t you telling me-\n\n//Suddenly, August falls to her hands and knees, closes her eyes, and grits her teeth as another wave passes over her. Slowly, her eyes open halfway as she looks out into the distance, across the ocean. After several moments of silence, she slowly turns back towards 6885-1, her eyes melancholic.//\n\n**August:** …when I go back, I’m not going to remember any of this. Am I?\n\n//6885-1 slowly moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** No, I… I don’t believe you will.\n\n//August sighs and presses both of her palms onto her eyes.//\n\n**August:** Why didn’t you tell me?\n\n**6885-1:** I-I must’ve gotten lost in our conversation a-and it slipped my mind… I’m sorry.\n\n//August removes her hands and smiles. Her eyes look red.//\n\n**August:** It’s okay. I just wish I’d known earlier. \n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** I would’ve paid more attention to what we talked about…\n\n**6885-1:** …while yes, you will forget the specifics of our conversation, I do believe you’ll retain… the feeling of it. If that makes any sense.\n\n**August:** I guess I’ll find out, huh?\n\n**6885-1:** I guess you will.\n\n//Still crouched next to 6885-1, August raises her phone, turns the camera towards them, and takes a picture.//\n\n**6885-1:** What was that?\n\n**August:** It’s called a selfie. Now, even if I don’t remember exactly what we talked about…\n\n//August shows 6885-1 the picture.//\n\n**August:** I’ll still have something to remember //you// by.\n\n**6885-1:** …thank you, July.\n\n//August smiles.//\n\n**August:** And thank you, Dash One… or, whatever you decide to be called next.\n\n**6885-1:** I think… I think I’m going to stay as Dash One. At least for a little while longer.\n\n//August laughs.//\n\n**August:** You know what was just a designation, right?\n\n//6885-1 moves back and forth.//\n\n**6885-1:** Maybe to you. But to me… it was a wonderful gift from a friend.\n\n//Slowly, August lowers her hand towards 6885-1, stopping just short of its shell.//\n\n**August:** …would it be alright if I-\n\n//6885-1 chitters and nuzzles into August’s palm. They remain there for several minutes. Slowly, August stands and wipes her eyes.//\n\n**August:** Could you… keep walking with me? Until it happens?\n\n**6885-1:** I would love to.\n\n//August and 6885-1 continue to walk down the beach in silence. After around three minutes, the recording cuts to black.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum - 2 (After Action Report):** As stated above, Researcher August was found wandering the beaches one day after she was supposed to have returned to Site-78. She had no memory of her time spent in SCP-6885 or her conversation with SCP-6885-1. When asked how she received the cut on her right palm, she claimed that she hadn’t noticed it until it was pointed out to her. She was not given access to the recordings but did show signs of intense confusion when first viewing the photo. All lie detector tests performed on August came back negative. \n\nSeveral days after August was recovered, she failed to appear at Site-78 and was reported out of state for two days. A tracker placed on her person after recovery showed that she stopped once in South Dakota and once in Wisconsin before returning. Upon her return, she was severely reprimanded by her Site Director and placed under careful observation. While observing, Foundation staff noted that she had printed out a copy of the picture taken inside of SCP-6885, framed it, and placed it on her desk.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6884]]] | SCP-6885 | [[[SCP-6886]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** DashOne.jpg\n> **Name:** Limulus polyphemus (Atlantic Horseshoe Crab) adult underside\n> **Author:** Plant Image Library\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Limulus_polyphemus_(Atlantic_Horseshoe_Crab)_adult_underside_(26923436154).jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
