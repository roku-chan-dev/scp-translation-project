The New York Hospital Med Center (temporarily designated Emergency Outpost B701) is being used as a treatment facility for SCP-5509 infected individuals.\n\nAssets within the CDC and New York City Department of Health are to continue to advise citizens against the consumption and use of unboiled tap water, under the guise of borough-specific water contamination. In conjunction with these efforts, several Foundation backed non-profit organizations will continue to distribute bottled water to affected areas in need.\n\nThe Medical Department is consulting with the [http://scpwiki.com/kelipat Kelipat Nogah Initiative] to determine a possible cause for the spread of SCP-5509 and its connection to other Sarkic-related anomalies.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n\nSCP-5509 is a highly invasive species of artificially created schistosome[[footnote]]Microscopic parasitic worms commonly known as blood flukes.[[/footnote]] organisms, proficient in the infection of and multiplying within human hosts. Unlike non-anomalous schistosomes, SCP-5509 instances are capable of releasing fertilized eggs into fresh water sources. These eggs are capable of infecting hosts through consumption or exposure to mucus membranes; once within a host the eggs will hatch before rapidly maturing. Short term symptoms of SCP-5509 infestation are congruent with schistosomiasis including: skin lesions, fever, chills, headache, stomach pain, joint pain, cough, fatigue, and muscle aches.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"‚ñ† 5509.doc.01 - Memo to Dr. Low ‚ñ†\" hide=\"‚ùê 5509.doc.01 - Memo to Dr. Low ‚ùê\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**SCPF Internal Memorandum**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**FROM:** Dr. Samira Golzar\n**TO:** Dr. Judith Low\n**DATE:** 2019/09/13\n**RE:** SCP-5509 contagion\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:donk2/bloodfluke|caption=SCP-5509 Organism|width=300px]]\nThis has to be an artificially mutated blood fluke.\n\nSchistosome infections are typically nonlethal in humans when treated with praziquantel or other anti-parasitics, which kill the worms causing the infection. When treated with anti-parasitic medications, SCP-5509 instances are highly sensitive to these treatments, and are thus easily cleared up by generic over-the-counter anti-parasitics.\n\nThis would normally be a good thing, as the cells dissolve and the organism itself dies. However analysis of all known SCP-5509 instances has revealed the presence of both strains of [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-3862 SCP-3862-Œ£], the pathogenic bacterial infection that is highly resistant to all commonly known antimicrobial therapies, and is considered biologically immortal.\n\nWhile mostly innocuous on their own, the two strains combine to manifest SCP-3862-Œ£, the disease that killed my predecessor, Dr. Forrester. The more I study this, the more I believe that the SCP-5509 organisms were specifically created to be a biological containment and delivery system for SCP-3862-Œ£, allowing 3862-Œ£ to spread undetected in the general populace.\n\nFurthermore, there are certain genetic markers in the SCP-5509 organism itself which make me think that they're all //designed// to die on their own at some point regardless of the presence of anti-parasitics. There is no way for me to know how far this contagion is spread, but I can tell you that we're about to see a lot more cases of SCP-3862-Œ£.\n\n‚Äì Samira\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAs the origin and long term effects of SCP-5509 are currently unknown, this file will be updated as new information becomes available.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nThe first known SCP-5509 infection was reported on 2019/09/01 at 12:54 GMT, from the New York Hospital Med Center in Queens, NYC. Within the next six hours, 103 new SCP-5509 related cases were discovered, leading to Foundation-led investigations into the situation. While initial attempts to quarantine and treat affected individuals appeared to be working, by 2020/09/07 there were over 3,600 cases, prompting the Foundation to begin quarantine procedures for the entire borough of Queens.\n\nAn exhaustive and rapid series of field examinations of the homes belonging to affected individuals first turned up no common factors. The infection initially appeared to be spreading at random, until all collected tap water samples in the infected homes revealed traces of SCP-5509, leading Foundation scientists to theorize that the water supply itself was the source.\n\nFoundation assets within the NYC municipal government attempted to contact the reservoir and aqueduct facilities responsible for water quality testing. Of the 13 facilities, the Ashokan Reservoir[[footnote]]A fresh water reservoir; acts as a main-source for the Catskill Aqueduct that provides water to the borough of Queens.[[/footnote]] was the only non-responsive agency. Local law enforcement was used to perform an initial investigation but contact was lost shortly after their arrival. Mobile Task Force Gamma-44 (\"Meat Lockers\") and a medical research team were dispatched to the Ashokan Reservoir for further investigation.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"‚ñ† Video Log 5509/1 ‚ñ†\" hide=\"‚ùê Video Log 5509/1 ‚ùê\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:** 2019/09/10\n**Location:** Ashokan Reservoir, Ulster County, New York\n**Depicted:** Captain R.

In conjunction with the CDC and assets within mainstream media, a disinformation campaign has begun downplaying the severity of SCP-5509 and its impact on civilian populations.\n\nThe New York Tri-State area has been placed under a state of emergency and the Department of External Affairs has executed Article 2, section 3[[footnote]](SCPF Chart. art.

Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") and MTF Gamma-44 have been dispatched to respond to a drastic increase in organised criminal activity throughout the city. In several instances, security check points have been targeted by rioters, instigated by known members of [http://scpwiki.com/scp-2408 GoI-0432] (\"The Hunter's Black Lodge\").\n\nThere are currently an estimated 2.45 million SCP-5509 infected individuals within the New York Metropolitan Area. To date, the Medical Division has been unsuccessful in creating a viable method of removing SCP-5509 from an infected human host. Further testing has indicated that long-term SCP-5509 infection will result in an altering of brain chemistry, making infected individuals more susceptible to manipulation. This is confirmed by the high percentage of infected civilians engaging in directed criminal activity, with no prior history of such.\n\nIt is believed that the UN itself is the primary target of this attack as multiple heads of state are on site due to the General Assembly and the previously scheduled meeting of the UN Security Council. As there has been no coordinated Global Occult Coalition response, the Foundation has initiated Operation Unison, in which a joint task force comprised of multiple Mobile Task Forces will secure and evacuate high priority targets.\n\nThe UN Secretary General and the Special Envoys to the UN Security Council will be transported to one of the secure locations designated in the Foundation Charter. Following their extraction all other diplomatic and political officials will be secured as dictated by field command. The Kelipat Nogah Initiative has been given provisional command over the Foundation response, with field operations being led by Commander Malachai ben Liraz.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#d1b386; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Emergency Notice to All Foundation Personnel.\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:90%; border-radius: 5px;\"]]\n[[image http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:donk2/UNbuilding style=\"width:90%; border-radius: 10px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 2019/09/16 at 07:12 EST, a Foundation convoy consisting of 42 Foundation security personnel and five transport vehicles arrived at the Headquarters of the United Nations in Manhattan.
