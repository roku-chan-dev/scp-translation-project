It is to be fed twice a day.\n\nTesting of SCP-7031 is to be conducted with approval from Head Researcher Joseph Statham. SCP-7031 must be administered a dose of Class-A Amnestics following the conclusion of each test to prevent it from becoming uncooperative.\n\nIn the event of a containment breach, security personnel are allowed to use lethal force against SCP-7031 should standard recontainment protocols be unsuccessful.\n\nSCP-7031 must receive psychological counseling sessions once a week by the on-site therapist Carol Hulsey. These sessions are to be conducted on Dr. Hulsey's office.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7031 (formerly identified as Emma Charlton) is a 24-years-old human female of British descent measuring 1.65 Meters in height and weighing 57 Kilograms.\n\nSCP-7031's anomalous property manifests whenever it is fatally injured. Immediately upon neutralization, SCP-7031 will trigger a retrocausal anomaly which nullifies the cause and circumstances leading up to its neutralization.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7031 came to the attention of the Foundation on 12/02/2015 after a video showcasing SCP-7031's anomalous property during a robbery on New York, United States was uploaded on the video sharing website //LiveLeak.//\n\nThe video in question was successfully taken down by Foundation personnel one week after it was originally posted and Mobile Task Force Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") was dispatched to locate and bring SCP-7031 into Foundation custody.\n\n**Addendum 7031.1:** Initial Interview.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Open Interview Log◀\" hide=\"▼Close Interview Log▼\"]]\n> **Date:** 02/03/2015\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Joseph Statham.\n> \n> **Interviewee:** PoI-9262.[[footnote]]SCP-7031's designation before being given proper SCP classification.[[/footnote]]\n> ----\n> [Begin Log.]\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** Good day Ms. Charlton. I presume you have been informed of the reason why you're here.\n> \n> //PoI-9262 makes a light nod.//\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** Y-Yes, well, sorta. Everything the other guys told me about this... 'Foundation' is that it's like the Men in Black and does things with supernatural stuff.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** More or less, but that's besides the point. [Pause.] So, what can you tell me about your anomalous ability Ms. Charlton?\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** My... Oh, the uh, the thing. Uh... Not a lot? it just sort of happens, you know. Every time I... Well, die, my vision sort of goes black for a few seconds, and then i'm just back like i just woke up from a nightmare.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** Every time you die?\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** Yes, uhm... [Pause.] I fell from the stairs on my house when I was like... Five or so? I don't remember. I had a car accident when I was Fourteen, and some... Jackass shot me in the head last month.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** I... think that's what happened, at least. It was so fast that I didn't realize it at first.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** I see. Could you perhaps elaborate on what you experience whenever it happens?\n> \n> //PoI-9262 remains silent for a moment and began to fidget with its hands.//\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** It feels almost like falling from a really, just a //really// tall place and then being forcefully shoved into a locker. [Pause.] It's not comfortable, at all.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** Hmmm. Does this also occur when you're injured?\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** I wish, but... No, only when I die apparently.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** Does your family, friends or anyone else know about this?\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** No, no. I don't think so at least.\n> \n> //There's silence for a few seconds.//\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** Well then, that would be all for today Ms. Charlton, it was a pleasure to-\n> \n> //Dr. Statham is interrupted by PoI-9262.//\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** Hey, wait a minute! You guys, uh... [Pause.] Fuck. Can I... Can you guys send me home? This place is making me feel sick.\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** I'm... Afraid that's not possible, Ms. Charlton.\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** W-What? Why not?\n> \n> **Dr. Statham:** One of the Foundation's primary missions is the containment of anomalies, of beings like you. We can't just integrate you back into society.\n> \n> **PoI-9262:** Huh? T-That's-... You fuckers kidnapped me! I-I was just in my house a-and then y-you all break in a-and-\n> \n> //PoI-9262 begins to hyperventilate and show signs of a panic attack.

As such, several sessions were scheduled with the on-site therapist Carol Hulsey to determine SCP-7031's mental state.\n\nBelow are transcripts and excerpts of the most relevant sessions.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Therapy-Session-7031-1.◀\" hide=\"▼Close Transcript.▼\"]]\n> **Date:** 14/03/2015\n> \n> **Subject:** SCP-7031\n> ----\n> [Begin Log.]\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Good morning Ms. Charlton, it's a pleasure to-\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Jesus Christ, finally.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Excuse me?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Somebody finally calls me by my actual name and not '7031' like I'm some sort of science experiment.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Right. I understand that it can be frustrating Ms. Charlton but I assure you that my colleagues are just following protocol and not doing it out of malice.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** I don't care, my name is not a fucking number.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Well, you won't have to worry about me calling you by a number then.\n> \n> //Dr. Hulsey chuckles. SCP-7031 is silent.//\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** So, why don't you tell me something about yourself?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Like?\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** You know, likes, dislikes, hobbies, anything you'd like to.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** ...Why?\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** To get to know you better.\n> \n> //SCP-7031 is silent for a few seconds.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Alright, what the hell is this? First I get kidnapped, then you asshats throw me away in a room with the bare fucking minimum and now you want to 'get to know me'?

You don't know shit.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** You're right, I don't. \n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Is there anything else you'd like to let out...?\n> \n> //SCP-7031 remains silent.//\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Another time it is then.\n> \n> [End Log.]\n> ----\n> **Notes:** //As I predicted, SCP-7031 demonstrates the same pattern of behavior as most humanoids do during their initial time in containment.

[Pause.] But, why do you think I had anything to do with that?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** I'm not an idiot. That happened right after our previous whatever this is.\n> \n> **Dr. Charlton:** Alright, I can't really argue with that.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** This doesn't mean that I suddenly love this place. I still fucking hate it.\n> \n> **Dr. Charlton:** And that is perfectly fine! You don't //have// to like us!

I've heard that yesterday was your first test.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Eh, what can I say? It was just a physical, nothing particularly interesting. Although...\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Although?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** I feel like I'm forgetting something, but I don't know exactly what. It's weird.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Hmm. Forgetfulness could be a sign of stress, anxiety or depression, so it's probably related to that.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** If you say so.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** So, there's something I have been curious about ever since I was appointed as your personal therapist.  I understand that it's a sensitive topic, but, how did you manage to get through your previous experiences with death?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** [Sighs.] What a question, doc.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** You don't have to answer right now if you don't want to.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** No, no, It's fine.

That specific day my parents were outside buying stuff while I was sleeping... and you can probably imagine how this is going to end. [Pause.] So I woke up, don't remember exactly why– maybe i was thirsty, or whatever, and decided to go downstairs. And when I was doing that... I tripped, and fell down, and hit my head a couple of times on the way down.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** And that's it, that's the story of how I died for the first time.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** You're... Surprisingly calm about this.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Yeah, well. It really wasn't that big of a deal.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** [Tilts her head.] How so?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** I mean, I was confused alright, really confused, but not exactly traumatized or anything like that. My mind just didn't really register what happened at the time, I guess.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Hmm, I suppose that makes sense.\n> ----\n> //The following 20 minutes of the recording have been cut due to a lack of relevancy.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶Therapy-Session-7031-8-Excerpt.◀\" hide=\"▼Close Transcript.▼\"]]\n> **Date:** 02/05/2015\n> \n> **Subject:** SCP-7031 \n> \n> **Foreword:** This fragment is an excerpt belonging to a longer session.

We did everything and shared everything ever since we met, we... \n> \n> //SCP-7031 is silent and scratches its head.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Yeah, I mean– Anyways. One night  we were at the birthday party of another friend that ended at around nine pm and her mother came to pick us up. \n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Now, I don't know if she relaxed or- or whatever given that the streets were so damn empty, but... another car crashed with ours, and you know, it's- it's uhm...\n> \n> //SCP-7031 let's out an exasperated sigh and looks down.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Goddammit.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** Are you-\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Yes, yes, I'm fine. I just need a moment.\n> \n> //Dr. Hulsey nods. There's a silence for 11 seconds.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** It all happened so fast.

Committed suicide?\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Yes, that's what I said \n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** That is a rather heavy subject to just drop like that.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** It is? [Shrugs.] I guess I've become desensitized to talking about these topics then.\n> \n> **Dr. Hulsey:** ... Alright, please go on.\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** Right. So, after the... Accident I became an emotional wreck for a while. I got therapy and medication and whatnot, but it was still hard you know?

I convinced myself that I would die for good if I ended it myself, so I made a noose with a scarf and... Well, that didn't work.\n> \n> //Silence.//\n> \n> **SCP-7031:** You know? Standing there like nothing had happened was... the most painful and liberating experience in my entire life.
