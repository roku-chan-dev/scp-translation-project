Access is to be made available at Site 135's media observation centre.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7958 was a television broadcast, shown on Freeview channel 149, titled \"//Deals and Bargains 4 U!//\". It is believed to have been a continuous broadcast, although the feed frequently cut out. The source of the transmission is unknown, no participants in the show have been identified outside it, and all attempts to block it failed.\n\nSCP-7958 was structured as a typical teleshopping programme, with a host advertising and demonstrating a range of products. Attempts to call in and purchase products proved successful.[[footnote]]See Addendum 17.[[/footnote]] Items on sale ranged from the generic to the esoteric and conceptual, and it was not uncommon for them to be anomalous or Veil-breaching in nature.\n\n**Addendum 3:** Transcripts of SCP-7958 broadcasts.\n\n> **BEGIN LOG**\n> \n> \n> //The set is clean white, with a marble island centred in the shot.

I'm very sorry if... if my demeanour has hampered your enjoyment of the show, you can report it to...\n> \n> \n> //Brief silence.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** To...\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** How long have you been here?\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** What, presenting the show? Long as I can remember. Does it matter?\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** This is a continuous broadcast, right? No other presenters?\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** //[she hesitates]// No. Just me. Never needed anyone else, I can do the job just fine.\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Oh?\n> \n> \n> //Hayes swallows.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Look, what are you getting at here?\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** You said you get to go when you sell the ruby?\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Well, I //suppose//-\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** How long have you been trying?\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** It... it doesn't matter. I have a job to do, I-I-I've gotta-\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Ms. Hayes...\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** No, like, like - it doesn't matter how long, it's what I'm here for, it's what matters, how long-\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Ruby.\n> \n> \n> //Hayes hesitates.//\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Long enough?\n> \n> \n> //Silence.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** //[whispering]// Yeah.\n> \n> \n> //Brief pause.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** It's just... a lot. Y'know. The idea of... of stuff that's, y'know. Not this.\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** I think it's worth it. Do you?\n> \n> \n> //Lengthy pause. Hayes swallows.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** It's, uh, Hermes delivery. That okay?\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Absolutely. Thank you very much.\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** And... you... you really want this?

I'm very much looking forward to receiving it, then.\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Just - before you go. Is - I mean -\n> \n> \n> //She stops, and exhales deeply.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Thank you.\n> \n> \n> //Dr. Whitaker laughs softly.//\n> \n> \n> **Whitaker:** Go on. God in his mercy lend you grace.\n> \n> \n> //Dr. Whitaker hangs up. Faint breathing can be heard for several seconds.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** No mystery.\n> \n> \n> **END LOG**\n> \n> \n> **Closing statement:** The ruby arrived twelve days after purchase, in a battered cardboard package. It was found to be non-anomalous, and made of plastic.\n\n**Addendum 18:** Final broadcast.\n\n> **BEGIN LOG**\n> \n> \n> //The transmission opens on the usual set, vacant. The lights are dimmed, and a boom mic is visible in the top left-hand corner of the screen. Underneath it is the plant pot, shattered against the wall; soil is scattered everywhere, and the marigold lies on the floor. The recording is silent, save for the gentle hum of the studio lights. There are no signs of life.//\n> \n> \n> //This continues for one hour and fifty-one minutes.//\n> \n> \n> //Then, Hayes enters the shot. Her shoulders are relaxed, and she wears an easy smile. None of the previous decay is apparent. She wears an identical, clean, dress, and a fresh coat of makeup.//\n>\n> \n> **Hayes:** Good evening, everyone. I'm glad to be here. Really. \n> \n> \n> //She smiles down the camera, right hand clasped over her opposite wrist.//\n>\n> \n> **Hayes:** I just wanted to say, I'm sure it's clear to you all that I've... well, I've been going through some stuff recently. I've been doing a lot of thinking, I've really needed to, and I... think I've worked things out. And let me tell you, I am //so// glad.\n> \n> \n> //She rubs her eyes and exhales deeply.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** So welcome. I'm so happy to be here with you tonight. We're gonna have a great time here together, I just know it. And now there's no little devil on my shoulder to lead me into the desert, we can actually do it in peace.\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** But enough talk, let's get on with the show! Up first, we have a marvellous deep-fat fryer from Russell Hobbs. Recommended retail price is £53.99; we're doing it for just £39.99. £39.99! For //this//!\n> \n> \n> //She gestures with her right arm. Her palm is visibly slick, and what appears to be concealer has come away from where she was holding her wrist, revealing dark, discoloured flesh underneath. Looking down, her face drops, and she quickly moves her hand back to cover.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Well, ah, any - ah, anyway! Of course, it goes without saying that the main attraction is our special offer, and it's a big one tonight! We have...\n> \n> \n> //With her left hand, she retrieves a ruby on a crimson velvet cushion.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Come on. You can see it. You can see how beautiful it is. And it's yours, for the frankly astonishing price of three - uh, £599.99. //[she laughs]// Best of all, I get to go once it's sold! Yeah...\n> \n> \n> //Hayes swallows, smiling quickly. She nods to herself.//\n> \n> \n> **Hayes:** Yeah. This time.\n> \n> \n> //Transmission continues uneventfully for another minute, before Hayes walks forward to reach something and appears to accidentally knock the camera from its stand, at which point the feed cuts out.//\n> \n> \n> **END LOG**\n\nNo further transmissions have been detected, and SCP-7958 has been reclassified to Neutralised accordingly.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7957]]] | SCP-7958 | [[[SCP-7959]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** abeautifulnameforabeautifulsoul\n> **Name:** Synthetic ruby 3.jpg\n> **Author:** James St. John\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Synthetic_ruby_3.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
