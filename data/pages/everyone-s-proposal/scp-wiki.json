If you think it's so easy to write a successful 001, then do it your god damn self right here. Direct channel to the O5s and everything. They'll deal with these now. I really just don't care anymore.\n\nConsider this matter closed.\n\n= â€” Maria Jones, RAISA Director\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: 5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ LEAVE YOUR NEW PROPOSAL BELOW:\n[[/=]]\n\n[[html]]\n\n  <div><textarea rows=\"15\" style=\"width:95%;\" id=\"fakepost\" onkeypress=\"description()\" wrap=\"hard\">\n</textarea>\n  </div>\n</div>\n[[/html]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: 10px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"buttonthing\"]]\n[[span class=\"blink\"]]\n\n[[html]]\n\n<body>\n\n<div id=\"buttonthing\">\n<button onclick=\"myFunction(); refreshPage();\"><h1>SEND PROPOSAL?</h1></button>\n</div>\n\n<script>\n\nfunction refreshPage(){\n    window.location.reload();\n}\nvar randomStrings = [\n\n\"Error: Doesn't feel like a 001.\",\n\"Error: Not enough GOIs mentioned.\",\n\"Error: Too many GOIs mentioned.\",\n\"Error: Too many typos.\",\n\"Error: Format screw.\",\n\"Error: You are not a top-ten author.\",\n\"Error: This is clearly your last D&D Campaign turned into an SCP.\",\n\"Error: Smells Like Teen Spirit.\",\n\"Error: Too fanfic-y.\",\n\"Error: Making a joke about something being 'too woke' in the form of an error message is inadvisable.\",\n\"Error: Not woke enough.\",\n\"Error: Does not pass Bechdel Test.\",\n\"Error: An Alternate Universe Counterpart Of Yourself Already Has 5 001 proposals.\",\n\"Error: Insufficient author avatars.\",\n\"Error: You didn't use any CSS.\",\n\"Error: The CSS is going to be a goddamn eyesore.\",\n\"Error: ACS code invalid.\",\n\"Error: 'Keter' isn't pronounced like that.\",\n\"Error: All O5s are in the bathroom.\",\n\"Error: This is clearly an OC.\",\n\"Error: Not only is this an OC, this is likely your fursona.\",\n\"Error: I literally saw this on an episode of Warehouse 13.\",\n\"Error: Plagiarized from your imagination.\",\n\"Error: The World Is A Vampire.\",\n\"Error: Rages Against The Machine.\",\n\"Error: 001 Proposal does not contain the secret word of the day: Twink.\",\n\"Error: 001 Proposal does not contain the secret word of the day: Pickman.\",\n\"Error: 001 Proposal does not contain the secret word of the day: Brooklyn.\",\n\"Error: SCP Reel.\",\n\"Error: I need scissors 61.\",\n\"Error: word count is not a multiple or factor of 69.\",\n\"Error: Does Not Contain A Terry Pratchett reference.\",\n\"Error: Contains a Harry Potter reference.\",\n\"Error: Does not meet minimum wordcount.\",\n\"Error: You are not a member of the Platinum Membership Club.\",\n\"Error: Contains reference that is not CC Compliant.\",\n\"Error: B&.\",\n\"Error: Nobody knows what the hell this is a reference to.\",\n\"Error: You have not read a sufficient amount of SCPs.\",\n\"Error: You have not read a sufficient amount of tales.\",\n\"Error: You have not downvoted this SCP.\",\n\"Error: You are a member of senior staff.\",\n\"Error: You lied about rolling that Nat 20 last game, fucking admit it, you piece of--\",\n\"Error: Anomaly is not compliant with Creative Commons.\",\n\"Error: No image detected.\",\n\"Error: War Broke Out In Heaven.\",\n\"Error: Noncreature Spells Cost 1 More to Cast.\",\n\"Error: Resonance Cascade Detected.\",\n\"Error: No interactive elements detected.\",\n\"Error: I'm not saying you used AI for this, but given the state of the site since the start of the year, I'm not taking any risks.\",\n\"Error: You are not a contributor to any canon on the site.\",\n\"Error: Too long, didn't read.\",\n\"Error: Server outage due to someone pasting the Vaporeon copypasta into the field an arbitrarily large number of times.\",\n\"Error: No emojis detected.\",\n\"Error: Not a number.\",\n\"Error: Not a letter.\",\n\"No Error!
