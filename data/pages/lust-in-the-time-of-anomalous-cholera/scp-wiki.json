Oh, all doubled over in agony from a little something? Unable to guard the containment chambers while your bowels empty? Hahaha! Oh, I will get my revenge on each and every one of you, once Montezuma is done! Hm? Oh, hello, there. Nice mask.\"\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Oh my, what a lovely voice you have. I do believe I'm getting a fever. I am [[[SCP-353|Vector]]], Madam of Malaise, Damsel of Disease. And you, my mysterious masked malcontent?\"\n\n\"[[[SCP-049-ARC|I... am the cure]]] for you, baby.\"\n\n\"We'll see about that.\"\n\n\"My cure is most effective.\"\n\n\"Is this your doing?\"\n\n\"No, they all suffer from The Disease.\"\n\n\"Let me guess, //voÃ«ltjie//, the Bubonic Plague?\"\n\n\"No, [[[scp-666-and-a-half-j|crab-stuffed mushroom]]] day at the cafeteria.\"\n\n\"Well, that gives us time to get to know each other, doesn't it?\"\n\n\"I already know plenty about you, dear. I sense... all the diseases in you.\"\n\n\"Wait just a second, sweetie, I need to sample this new infection.\"\n\n\"Did you just lick that man's anus?\"\n\n\"Best gotten at the source. And I'm going to lick more than that on you.\"\n\n\"You'll be at it a while. My bag is quite full.\"\n\n\"Oh my, your bag is so huge! Is that real [DATA EXPUNGED]?\"\n\n\"The finest Corinthian [DATA EXPUNGED].\"\n\n\"I must touch your bag.\"\n\n\"Touch all you like, my dear. But be careful, the contents may... jostle.\"\n\n\"Oh, when I get inside you, you'll swell in places you never expect.\"\n\n\"It will take more than a simple palpitation to give me the tremors. But my touch will cure your ailment.\"\n\n\"I carry over a thousand diseases. Do you honestly think a single touch will get my juices flowing?\"\n\n\"I have a surgeon's hands, cutie, we have all night, and when I administer my cure, you will so desperately need it.\"\n\n\"Oh! That lovely black robe... isn't a robe, is it? You're totally naked.\"\n\n\"I see your glands flush and pulsate in antici... pation. I will relieve the pressure with my scalpels.\"\n\n\"Mmm, show me what you can do with a little sharp pain.\"\n\n\"I do believe I've caught your virus.\"\n\n\"I leave myself in your capable hands, doctor.\"\n\n\"This... I am afraid the constant sounds of vomit and gastric distress do ruin the mood some.\" \n\n\"It's not exactly Beethoven.\"\n\n\"Perhaps I should administer my cure to a few of these researchers, so that we could have some peace.\"\n\n\"Well... I've always wanted to make love under a fountain...\"\n\n----\n\n\"I say, doctor, you are a genius. Your zombies hold their place and let their stomachs empty in a quiet, compliant manner.\"\n\n\"And without your mastery of disease, we would not be able to maintain the cafeteria infection in place after I administered my cure.\"\n\n\"Now let us return to make love under the fountain of our own design.\"\n\n\"This effluvium makes a most wondrous lube.\"\n\n\"Uh... Excuse me?\"\n\n\"What? Another doctor? Who are you?\"\n\n\"They call me the [[[SCP-890|Rocket Surgeon]]]. I'm looking to fix [[[SCP-297|Steely Dan]]].\"\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
