Upon closer inspection,\nI descried a foul connection:\ninsects, personnel and poison\nand a cry for chloroform...\n\nSagging deep into the cushion\nof my chair, and roughly pushing\nback the pile of papers which had\nfallen on me as a storm;\nrubbing 'til my eyes were red\nand plunging down the deep'ning dread\nI spoke these words into the night:\n\"Grow up, Karen, sign the forms.\"\n\n\"Clear your head, and be professional\nat this desk — it's no confessional!\nYou're a cog, a spinning wheel;\nit's not your role to make a fuss.\nDo you really think they're plugging\nopen wounds with bees, or drugging\nconvicts just for kicks as though \nthe ethics were superfluous?\"\n\nSplashed the ink, then on to Bremmel\nWho required a high-speed dremel\nand a surgeon — why a surgeon?\nReasoning felt incomplete.\nNow a purchase order from\nthe MTFs, for bubble gum\nand scalpels (for their medkits? Or...?)\n\"Dammit, Karen, sign the sheet.\"\n\nSome of same were missing data,\nand as their adjudicator\nought I not to mark them as\nunfit to thus be passed along?\nAh, but the Administrator\nhad signed off, and he's no traitor.\nSurely I could trust these worthies!\nSurely they could do no wrong.\n\nThen again... that vivisection...\nThere was cause to raise objection!\nFrom an expert engineer,\nsuch a suit defied the norm.\nDared I essay non-compliance\nand accuse him of mad science?\nWhich of us would pay the price?\n\"Fuck it, Karen, sign the form.\"\n\nForty fan blades; sure, why not?\nA compound that induces rot...\nHad I cause to judge each brief?\nMy doctorate's a D.B.A.\nSafety razors by the gross,\nexcitants at a lethal dose,\nrabies virus multi-packs...\nI wasn't qualified to weigh.\n\nShould indeed these parties various\nbe engaged in deeds nefarious,\ncould I stand to stand aside\nand face my own face at the dawn?\nDid I owe a deeper debt\nto humankind? Would I regret\na squandered chance to set things right?\n\"Sign it, Karen, and move on.\"\n\nBlind to all coincidence,\nincapable of insolence,\nI did my bit in parcelling off\nour dire doings underground.\nAny evil in this batch\ncould wait for someone else to catch;\nscrawled my name upon the lines\nand uttered no dissenting sound.\n\nWas it my imagination?\nThat unseemly jubilation\non the face of Bremmel when\nI met him on the following morn?\nWere those moans upon the air\na novelty, or always there?\nMore the point: why did I care?\nDuty done: I'd signed the forms.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[Pride of Place]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[[[SCP-6121]]]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** TheForms.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
