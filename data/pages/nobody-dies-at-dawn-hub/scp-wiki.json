To whispers of ghosts, lost on wind of the storm-torn Aegean.\n\nCertainly, those who live on the path to the black heart of Kalmaktama claim otherwise: they speak of a revenant clad in dark iron, his steel ship and his bronze crew haunting the dying empire of the flesh. They speak of a warrior who once was a man, now baptised through fire under a moniker far older than any of the truths he had once served. A man cursed to forever wonder the wine-dark sea, in endless atonement for the blood staining his hands; in pursuit for a peace that will never come.\n\nAnd if you listen real close, when the hour is darkest and air is coldest, you will hear the lost and wicked speak of another. Of a husk as tall as the waves, the vigor in her hands matched only by the hatred in her eyes. A burning need for justice against the man who's taken her home and murdered her people in the name of a shattered demon. A demon she has promised to slaughter alongside its seabound pawn -- a demon whose black blood she swears will one day stain the altars built to honor her fallen Ion.\n\nBut here's what I know: both are but fools, caught in a conflict greater and more ancient than any of their own pathetic wars. They are pieces to forces far beyond their understanding -- and, indeed, far beyond their control.\n\nNeither realize it is it is only a matter of time before the game they have been forced to play drowns them both, sinking them amidsts a burning, broken world.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Asterisk.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n++ **The Shattered Path**\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"mainmap\"]]\n[[image map.png style=\"border: thick outset #282e48; border-radius: 50px;\"]] \n\n[[div class=\"enlarge\" style=\"left: 62%; top: 42%; height: 6vmin; width: 6vmin;\"]]\n[[image Odyssey.png link=\"*/laid-in-blood\"]]\n[[div class=\"subtitlemap one\"]]\nPart I\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"enlarge\" style=\"left: 83%; top: 60%; height: 6vmin; width: 6vmin;\"]]\n[[image Odyssey.png link=\"*/my-name-is-no-one\"]]\n[[div class=\"subtitlemap two\"]]\nPart II\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"enlarge\" style=\"left: 18%; top: 30%; height: 6vmin; width: 6vmin;\"]]\n[[image Odyssey.png link=\"*/favoured-son\"]]\n[[div class=\"subtitlemap three\"]]\nPart III\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"enlarge\" style=\"left: 33%; top: 54%; height: 6vmin; width: 6vmin;\"]]\n[[image Odyssey.png link=\"*/empty-trail\"]]\n[[div class=\"subtitlemap four\"]]\nPart IV\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"enlarge\" style=\"left: 48%; top: 51%; height: 6vmin; width: 6vmin;\"]]\n[[image Odyssey.png link=\"*/scp-8472\"]]\n[[div class=\"subtitlemap five\"]]\nPart V\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» Accessibility Version «\" hide=\"« Accessibility Version »\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"borders\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++++ **1.

Strategist advisor to the prophets of MEKHANE and king of Ithaca, one of the city-states of the Broken Empire. A cunning warrior who does not revel in war, but nevertheless does what is neccessary to ensure victory, often reaching for trickery and deceit in place of brute force. The current reluctant bearer of the Nobody mantle.\n\n* **Circe** -- witch and minor deity descendent from the Tuatha Dé Danann peoples. Child to Helios-alias-Goldbaker. Resident of Aeaea. Capable of oneiromancy, prescience, and incantations. Profficient in name magic and metamorphosis, which they utilize to enchant their enemies from men to beasts. Often shifts between appearences and genders, moving between both like a raging, wind-torn sea sea.\n\n* **Halyna Ieva** -- Nälkä warlord, karcist, and leader of one of the largest halkosts in all of Kalmaktama. Master of carnomancy and shape-shifting; most often assumes the form of a woman with serpentine growths in place of legs, bearing a trident made of bone. Hardened by years of war into a strong but brutal leader. Would kill and die for her people.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-base name=ieva.png\n|caption=Survivor.\n|width=250px\n|align=left\n]]\n\n* **Grand Karcist Ion and the Klavigars** -- religious and political leaders of Kalmaktama and Adytum. Carnomancers of ferocious proficiency, matched only in fervour in their persuit of bodily freedom from the gods of this world. Gone after the fall of Adytum -- whether from  the way of life (as the Mekhanites claim) or on a journey between worlds to oppose the gods (as the Nälkä claim) nobody knows.\n\n* **Robert Bumaro, Legate Trunnion, and Saint Hedwig** -- Prophets of the goddess MEKHANE and triarchs of the Broken Empire. With differing characters and perspective, often at odds with each other; united almost solely by their shared -- though often differing in interpretation and practise -- servitude to MEKHANE and a burning hatred for the Nälkä people. \n\n* **Aurora** -- Fae demigod with a shattered soul. Source and power behind the Nobody mantle. Guides her Nobodies from beyond the grave in endless persuit of vengance against her sister and her killer, Mab.\n\n* **Mab** -- Fae demigod with a shattered conscience. Long-gone specter of a dead Empire desperate to claw back from the dead to once again conquer the world for her own glory. Willing to do anything to bring back her kingdom.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab The Places]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ **The Places**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n* **Adytum** -- the black heart of the sarkic nation and the home of Grand Karcist Ion and his people. Besieged by the Mekhanites for reasons long-since forgotten as a final, desperate target on the altar of a self-rightous war. Once a great tree born of flesh and bone, planeted and grown on soil littered with Daevite corpses; now naught but a ruin, broken and burnt by a trick of Odysseus, its ashen remains haunting Anatolia and the rest of the decaying body of Kalmaktama.\n\n* **Ithaca** -- home of Odysseus and city-state of the Broken Empire. Seated somewhere west, near the border of a decadent theocracy. A fading memory, its smell stuck between a sorrowed wind and the arms of a beloved. A goal to reach, no matter the cost -- the only thing worth dying and fighting for.\n\n* **Aeaea** -- where leylines and fates meet beneath an empty sky. A refuge and dwelling of the witch Circe; a place of momentary respite amidst a raging sea. A grave for that which once was and a warning for that which shall yet still be; the point of no return.\n\n* **Amoni** -- the burning engine of the Broken Empire and its south-most residence. A capital and seat of power of all three of MEKHANE's prophets; the place from which they sing the words of their Goddess towards her war-torn nation. The cradle and grave to tonnes of beryllium bronze, and an archive to secrets -- and men -- older than time.\n\n* **Gyaros** -- a temple sleeping somewhere underneath the restless Aegan, built from flesh and hopes of a better tomorrow. The first to fall during the war; the echo that brought the avalanche.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Timeline of Relevant Events]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ **Timeline of Relevant Events**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n* **240th millennium, BCE**\n * The soul of the Fae demigod Aurora shatters at the height of a civil war, its shards scattering in a desperate cry for someone to avenge her and kill Mab. Most of them fade away, into the rebirthed world around them, now free of an Empire which has chained it for millenia; but one finds itself a willing host -- the first in a lineage of Nobodies to carry its Mantle.\n \n* **18th century, BCE**\n * Grand Karcist Ion liberates the Daevite slaves through a bloody revolt against their masters. Amidst the conflict, he finds himself four Klavigars with which he establishes Kalmaktama --a new, free nation -- and sarkicism -- a new, free religion. The Nälkä spread their culture like wildfire, much to the dismay of another, Broken power rising in the south.\n\n* **12th century, BCE**\n * Adytum falls under a Mekhanite siege, its walls breached by trickery and its people killed. Somewhere inside the black ruin, a Nobody breathes their final breath. With it, they pass their mantle onto the reluctant Odysseus of Ithaca.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Background Reading]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ **Background Reading**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nGathered below are pieces that -- though not mandatory to understanding the plot of Nobody Dies At Dawn -- might help paint a better picture of the world and events described therein at large.\n\n++++  __**The Tapestries of War**__\n\n* **[[[art:nobody-draws-at-dawn|Nobody draws at dawn]]]** -- //by [[*user vilsolad]]//\n\n++++  __**The World at Large**__\n\n* **[[[A Baptism of Fire]]]** -- //by [[*user Ralliston]]//\n\n* **[[[A Faerie Tale Of Twin Queens]]]** -- //by [[*user LordXVNV]]//\n\n* **[[[fret-not-dear-heart|Fret Not, Dear Heart, Let Not Them Hear]]]** -- //by [[*user Dino--Draws]]//\n\n* **[[[Echoes of Shattered Erikesh]]]** -- //by [[*user Jasiu06]] and [[*user Ralliston]]//\n\n* **[[[mother-who-demands-ones-toes|Karcist Halyna Ieva, or The Mother Who Demands One's Toes]]]** -- //by [[*user Naepic]] and [[*user TheMightyMcB]]//\n\n* **[[[scp-217|SCP-217: The Clockwork Virus]]]** -- //by [[*user Dr Gears]]//\n\n* **[[[scp-2095|SCP-2095: The Siege of Gyaros]]]** -- //by [[*user Metaphysician]]//\n\n* **[[[scp-2406|SCP-2406: The Colossus]]]** -- //by [[*user Metaphysician]]//\n\n* **[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/6130/pg6130-images.html The Iliad]** -- //by Homer//\n\n* **[https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/1727/pg1727-images.html The Odyssey]** -- //by Homer//\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[size 75%]]\n= //Written by [[*user Diogene_s]], [[*user Dino--Draws]], and [[*user Ralliston]] for [[[pdcontest2025|PUBLIC DOMAIN CON]]].//\n[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n| [[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives]]] |\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Dino--Draws, Diogene_s, and Ralliston]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** header4.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** ieva.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** odysseus1.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** odysseus2.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** Asterisk.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jasiu06]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** Odyssey.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jasiu06]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies-at-dawn-hub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** map.png\n> **Name:** Mediterranean Basin and Near East before 1000 AD topographic map.jpg\n> **Author:** Flappiefh\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mediterranean_Basin_and_Near_East_before_1000_AD_topographic_map.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Additional Notes:** Edited by [[*user Dino--Draws]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
