SCP-7210 is to be provided with appropriate sustenance and monitored for any changes in behavior or abilities. No direct communication with SCP-7210 is to be initiated without approval from Level 4 personnel.\n\n**b2-7210**, and more specifically, SCP-7210-1, are to be monitored 24/7 with a variety of forms of surveillance, such as, but not limited to, visible CCTV security cameras, hidden microphones, and a multitude of hidden cameras. Upon the beginning of every night in **b2-7210**, the stars visible in the sky are to be counted using advanced algorithmic celestial-object imaging technology. If the amount of stars visible differs from 4544 on any given count, all entrances to **b2-7210** are to be immediately located and sealed.\n\n@@\n@@\n\n**Description:** SCP-7210 is an anomalous humanoid entity, exhibiting no discernible physical characteristics to differentiate it from an average human being. SCP-7210 displays above-average intelligence, scoring an average of 129 IQ on various tests. Although SCP-7210's anomalous abilities are still under investigation, a few important abilities have been noted.\n\n# The ability to produce tears of an extremely acidic nature, enough to cause second-degree burns on human flesh.\n# The anomalous lack of a need for sleep.\n# The ability to 'spectate' different dimensions that branch off of baseline reality.\n# The ability to create pocket dimensions.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Assumed, given the discovery of **b2-7210**.[[/span]]\n# The ability to manifest as a stellar object in said pocket dimensions when observing them.\n# The ability to populate said pocket dimensions with artificially conscious entities.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Assumed, given the discovery of **SCP-7210-1.**[[/span]]\n# --The ability to communicate with the outside world.--\n# --The ability to physically travel between its pocket dimensions and baseline reality.--\n\nSCP-7210-1 is a non-anomalous artificially conscious entity observed in SCP-7210's only discovered pocket dimension, **b2-7210**. SCP-7210-1 displays a remarkable similarity to SCP-7210's physical appearance, mannerisms, and accent, however differs in its personality, and vocabulary. SCP-7210-1 is not capable of any of the same anomalous effects that SCP-7210 is, and does not seem to be aware of SCP-7210, nor of its constructed surroundings or life. \n\nSCP-7210 appears to have developed a pseudo-parental relationship with SCP-7210-1, which has, on multiple occasions, led to increased protectiveness regarding SCP-7210-1, separation anxiety when disallowed access to spectating **b2-7210**, and an innate desire to communicate with and \"raise\" SCP-7210-1. As such, the Anomaly Health & Psychology Committee are tasked with boosting SCP-7210's morale and mood in order to promote ethical and safe research of SCP-7210's anomalous abilities, and minimize symptoms of depression and separation anxiety.\n\nSCP-7210 is under strict orders to never communicate with SCP-7210-1, due to raised security concerns regarding the security of allowing an SCP to access and communicate with a pocket dimension that near-identically mirrors the outside world. \n\n------\n\nRecently, SCP-7210 has been consistently requesting a chance to contact a researcher. Upon review with the Anomaly Health & Psychology Committee, this meeting has been granted. However, given the SCP's history of contempt for SCP researchers, the meeting will be conducted under the strict orders that it must be limited to five minutes, and that there must be a tempered-glass screen separating SCP-7210 and the interviewer to prevent physical violence.\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n\n//Date:// 31/01/2023\n\n**Researcher:** Researcher Norman McMurphy\n\n**Subject:** SCP-7210\n\n------\n\n**BEGIN LOG**\n\n**McMurphy:** Good morning, SCP-7210. You've requested this meeting, and I'm here to answer your questions and hopefully clear up any confusion you might have. It's just me, a guard, and our head researcher assigned to you here to make sure everything goes according to plan. All good?\n\n**7210:** Yeah... yeah, all good.\n\n**McMurphy:** Great. And, I'm sure you're already aware of the rules; no violence, no mind games, and no 'negotiation' about your containment situation. Got it?\n\n**7210:** OK.\n\n**McMurphy:** Great. \n\n//He clears his throat, crosses his arms and leans back in his chair.//\n\n**McMurphy:** Go ahead.\n\n**7210:** Who are you?\n\n**McMurphy:** We're the SCP Foundation. We can't tell you anything else. Next question.\n\n//7210 shakes its head and sighs.//\n\n**7210:** Why am I here?\n\n**McMurphy:** You're anomalous. You defy the laws of all-- well, all known laws, really. And we're here to find out what you're capable of. \n\n**7210:** Then why are you hurting me?\n\n//McMurphy sighs.//\n\n**McMurphy:** We're not trying to hurt you. We just need to know more about you. The real world is dangerous for you, and you for it. We need to protect you, in here. Understand?\n\n**7210:** But I didn't choose to be this way!\n\n**McMurphy:** How's that?\n\n**7210:** I made mistakes. And now you're hurting me for it.\n\n**McMurphy:** Well, look on the bright side. We've got another SCP here that we're trying to dissolve in acid, and you get free food, free housing, and you got people studying you every day of the week. Doesn't it make you feel special? Isn't it better than living out in the real world, where you'll be judged? \n\n**7210:** I'm special? Then why am I treated like a prisoner?\n\n**McMurphy:** We're sorry if you feel that way. Genuinely, we are. If there's anything we can do to improve your living conditions, then let us know. (catching himself) But we can't give you a bigger cell. There's not enough space for it as it is. You're free to decorate your cell, though, make it feel like home! Just tell us what you want to order in and we'll hang it up for you.\n\n**7210:** You stripped me of my second chance. \n\n**McMurphy:** Look. I get it. I get that you're scared, and I get that you want out. But we can't just... let anomalies out. The world, they don't know people like you can even exist. Like I said, we're protecting you from them. So, I'm sorry, but you can't leave here. That's why we have departments like the AH&P ensuring that you're as healthy and as happy as you can be.\n\n//7210 shakes its head.//\n\n**7210:** Do you know why I'm \"anomalous\", as you call it? Do you even intend to know? Do you even care about what I did to end up here, or do you want to avoid any ounce of empathy whatsoever?\n\n**McMurphy:** No. That's not it. If you want to tell us, then we'd be happy to know. That's just... not our primary focus at the moment.\n\n//McMurphy sits in silence.//\n\n**McMurphy:** Out there, in the real world, you'd have a different kind of prison. People fear what they don't understand, and they'd try to control you or worse. And hey, it's not just folks like you. We all feel a bit trapped out there from time to time. At least in this place, the laws from outside don't apply. Laws of physics, laws of the government. It's fun.\n\n//7210 appears immensely frustrated.//\n\n**7210:** And I'm the one playing mind games?\n\n**McMurphy:** That your last question?\n\n//7210 bangs the table with its fist.//\n\n**McMurphy (sternly):** Hey. Calm down.\n\n//7210 sinks its face into its palms. Approximately nine seconds pass in complete silence.//\n\n//McMurphy sighs.//\n\n**McMurphy:** The five minute mark has been reached. I'm sorry, SCP-7210.\n\n**END LOG**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\nFollowing the meeting, the Anomaly Health & Psychology Committee raised concerns regarding SCP-7210's mental health and wellbeing. As such, three physical examinations were conducted to accurately determine the health of SCP-7210. \n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n\n**Examination 1**\n//Date:// 2/02/2023\n@@ @@ \n**Observations:** Anomaly accepted breakfast, lunch and dinner.

Anomaly spent the rest of the day in a corner of its cell.\n**Recommendations:** Hold a therapy session.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nUpon the request of the Anomaly Health & Psychology Committee, a therapy session held by Site-17 therapist Lucille Chapman was organized. \n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n\n//Date: 13/02/2023//\n\n**Therapist:** Dr. Lucille Chapman\n\n**Client:** SCP-7210\n\n------\n\n**Chapman:** Okay, I've just started the camera, is that okay?\n\n//7210 nods.//\n\n**Chapman:** Great! We can get started then. How are you today, SCP-7210?\n\n//7210 shrugs.//\n\n**Chapman:** And how have you been feeling these past few days?\n\n**7210:** Shit.\n\n**Chapman:** I'm sorry to hear that. Would you be comfortable explaining why that might be?\n\n//7210 sighs.//\n\n**7210:** Not really.\n\n**Chapman:** I understand that. But if you tell me, it'll help me understand your situation some more, and it'll allow me to help you feel better here.\n\n//7210 rolls its eyes.//\n\n**Chapman:** It helps both of us if you tell me why you feel this way. And remember, this is completely private. Feel free to spill anything and everything.\n\n**7210:** Then what's the camera for?\n\n**Chapman:** This session is being recorded so that I can look back on this in the future, and assess what the best option is for you moving forward, without wasting time taking notes. I promise you, no one else will ever see this.\n\n//7210 sighs.//\n\n**7210:** I don't know. I don't want to give this glorified prison or the people who work for it more info about my life. No offence, I just don't want it to be used in the wrong way.\n\n**Chapman:** I completely understand your concerns, SCP-7210. Your privacy is essential, and I respect that. This session is about you, your thoughts, and your emotions. I'm here to support you in any way I can, and our conversations are confidential.\n\n**7210:** But why should I even bother? It's not like anything is going to change.\n\n**Chapman:** That's a fair concern. It's true that your circumstances won't change immediately, but therapy is a tool to help you cope with what you're going through. It can help you find new perspectives, develop healthy coping strategies, and even manage the stress and frustration you might be experiencing.\n\n**7210:** How can talking about it help?\n\n**Chapman:** Talking about it can be incredibly freeing. \n\n//7210 makes eye contact with Chapman for the first time.//\n\n**Chapman:** Baby steps, 7210. Baby steps.\n\n//7210 looks back down at the floor, rubs its face, and sighs.//\n\n**7210:** Alright. Well, for starters, I'm not myself anymore.\n\n**Chapman:** I understand, it's a common experience fo-\n\n**7210:** No, no you don't. You don't understand. I am quite literally not myself anymore.\n\n**Chapman:** Is there a reason for that?\n\n**7210:** Long story.\n\n**Chapman:** Well, we've got all the time in the world. \n\n//7210 sighs.//\n\n**7210:** Look, I'll spare you the details. One day, I got an opportunity. To \"know what it's like to be perfect\". That was the wording. I took it, as anyone would.\n\n//7210 groans and rubs its face.//\n\n**7210:** That's when it all went to shit. I didn't actually //become// perfect. There's always a catch with those... things. No, I just fuckin' gained the ability to view perfect worlds. To view perfect lives. I KNEW what it was like, but I couldn't experience it for myself. Made me miserable. Knowing what it's like to live happily, and not once being able to experience it. \n\n//Chapman nods.//\n\n**7210:** At least, that's what I thought. Then my mother died, and suddenly my tears burned. I had to stop myself from grieving. My father moved away and became estranged to me, and suddenly I don't need sleep. Had to stay up 24/7 thinking about him. It was like some kind of punishment. More recently, I found out the other... \"worlds\" I can view had all the information I needed to know to prevent all of this. Real world fucking events. Every mistake I've made, every bad thing that's happened to me could've been prevented if I had just looked at the bigger picture. It really was true; I could've lived a perfect life. God, fuck, I'm sorry. \n\n//7210 sinks its face into its hands.//\n\n**Chapman:** You're doing great, 7210. This is very brave of you. \n\n**7210:** I don't wanna talk about this. \n\n//7210 raises its head, and locks eyes with the camera lens. 7210's face turns to disgust.//\n\n**7210:** Can't believe I said all that shit anyway.\n\n//Chapman turns around and acknowledges the camera. She slowly exhales, and turns to face SCP-7210.//\n\n**Chapman:** SCP-7210, it would be better for all of us if you continued your story.\n\n**7210:** All of us? What happened to just \"both of us\", doc? Someone gonna be watching this footage?\n\n**Chapman:** I sincerely promise you that no one other than me will be viewing this footage.\n\n//7210 raises an eyebrow. Chapman turns to face the camera lens.//\n\n**7210:** Red means recording, right? So what does blue mean, doc?\n\n//Chapman sighs deeply. She reaches underneath her chair, pulls out a pair of noise-cancelling wireless headphones, and puts them on. She looks back at the camera, nods, and looks back at SCP-7210.//\n\n**Chapman:** It means streaming, 7210. [COGNITOHAZARD EXPUNGED FOR READER SAFETY].\n\n//7210 reverts to an emotionless facial expression for one second, before immediately breaking into tears.//\n\n**7210 (through tears):** I could've lived a perfect life.

Sorry, I didn't mean to come off rude there. You're fine people. Well, at least you are.\n\n**Chapman:** I'm what?\n\n//7210, somewhat quizzically, glances at Chapman.//\n\n**7210 (regaining composure):** A-a fine person?\n\n//Chapman looks on empathetically, before turning around and knowingly looking at the camera, and turning back to face SCP-7210//\n\n**Chapman:** Thank you, that means a lot. And thank you for telling me all of that. I know that must've been difficult.\n\n//7210 nods, avoiding any and all eye contact. Chapman glances at the camera again.//\n\n**Chapman:** Has anyone from the AH&P committee talked to you about developing some kind of coping mechanism?\n\n**7210:** No.\n\n**Chapman:** Well, maybe we can work on that first. Help keep your mind off of all of these thoughts of yours. You mentioned that you can create \"worlds\" of your own, right?\n\n//7210 nods.//\n\n**Chapman:** Perhaps you could use a world of your own as an outlet. Vent all of your frustrations and worries out, and no one gets hurt.\n\n//Eight seconds of silence pass. 7210 is staring at the floor, as if realizing something.//\n\n**Chapman:** 7210? Everything ok-\n\n**7210:** Holy shit. \n\n**Chapman:** Have you come up with something? Would you be willing to share it?\n\n//7210 looks up at Chapman, revealing its fresh burn marks.//\n\n**7210:** Doc, I got it. It doesn't have to be me.\n\n**Chapman:** 7210, what do you mean by that?\n\n**7210:** I mean that you've given me an idea. Maybe my life will never be perfect as it is. Maybe I've just hit a roadblock. And maybe, just maybe, I need to start over. But I can't do it myself. \n\n//7210 begins smiling, before recoiling in pain, and relaxing its face.//\n\n**Chapman:** I'm not sure I entirely understand. But, if it doesn't hurt anyone, and it helps you keep your mind off of the things you've told me about today, then I'm glad to have helped you!\n\n//Chapman smiles warmly. 7210 nods, suppressing a smile.//\n\n**Chapman:** Oh, uh, do you want an ice-pack?\n\n**7210:** Oh, yeah. If that's okay.\n\n**Chapman:** Down the hall, second door to the right. It's labelled \"MED\". Just ask for one.\n\n//Chapman gestures towards the door.//\n\n**7210:** Thank you! Thank you, doc, thank you!\n\n//7210 rises from its chair and swiftly exits the room.//\n\n//Chapman relaxes her face upon seeing that the door has closed, and exhales deeply. She turns towards the camera, revealing that she looks considerably stressed. She gets up from her chair and briskly paces towards the camera.//\n\n**Chapman:** Alright. F-fuck. AH&P can't know about this, Kubitz. Delete the vid-- wait, no, then Info's gonna get involved. Jesus fuck. Okay uhh, maybe uhh-- yeah, okay. Just kick them off from viewing the file. Y-you can do that, right? Just tell them there's a coghaz or an--an infohaz in the uhh, in the file, and hopefully they'll fuck off. Thanks. Oh, and uhh, sorry.
