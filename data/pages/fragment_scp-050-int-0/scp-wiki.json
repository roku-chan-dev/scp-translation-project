Due to the memetic nature of many Project Polyglot research materials, staff entering and leaving the site are to undergo a week long quarantine and psychological evaluation. Until development of SCP-050-INT’s anti-memetic properties are completed, all information regarding Project Polyglot is considered Level 4 Classified. \n\nAs of 20/1/2022, a Tactical Theology Mobile Task Force trained in Akivan communications is to be stationed at Provisional Site-11.\n\n**Description:** SCP-050-INT is an anomalous language created by the Foundation as part of Project Polyglot. Following a variety of incidents stemming from a lack of inter-organizational efficiency [[footnote]] See 2015 SCiPnet Email Incident for further information. [[/footnote]], Project Polyglot was conceived as an effort to improve cooperation between different Foundation branches, and focused on several guiding principles. \n\n* **Universality** - The creation of a language that could only be spoken, written and perceived by staff would allow for personnel of different nationalities to simply and quickly communicate. This would be facilitated with the simultaneous development of a memetic that grants those exposed to it instant fluency in SCP-050-INT.\n* \n* **Security** - As part of its creation, SCP-050-INT was interlaced with several anomalous qualities, allowing for its use as a secure cipher with increased resistance to both written and spoken memetic hazards. Individuals who did not speak SCP-050-INT would be incapable of hearing the language itself when it was spoken.\n* \n* **Secrecy** - Recent research carried out by the Tactical Theology department on the applications of specific elements of religious scripture suggested that many classes of Akivan entities were not capable of comprehending specific Aramaic languages. This would allow Foundation personnel to operate without interference or fear of repercussions from said entities. Due to the relatively small speaking population, the Western Neo-Aramaic variant was chosen to serve as the framework for SCP-050-INT, and proposals were drawn up for the relocation and amnestization of said population. \n* \n* **Stability** - Project Polyglot would see the development of a conceptual engineering device capable of manipulating and splicing concepts into SCP-050-INT. By grounding it in collective conceptualization, the language will be more resistant to linguistic parasites, be more hostile to pataphysical entities, and be more difficult to host new linguistic memetic hazards on. This will ensure the longevity of SCP-050-INT as a tool for the Foundation's use. \n\n**Addendum INT-050.1:** Project Launch\n\nFollowing the O5 Council's approval on 24/01/20, Project Polyglot was set to begin. The Provisional Site-11 was constructed with the purpose of facilitating the project. Due to the nature of the anomaly, the project requires staff to be members from different international branches. As a result, Provisional Site-11 was constructed in Singapore to act as a neutral country between the different branches. The following Department Heads were assembled for the project:\n\n* Project Lead: Damien Lim Jun Jie \n* Head of Engineering: Sebastían Joaquín Leopoldo\n* Head of Logistics: Marcel Vivier\n* Head of Memetics: Yekaterina Popova\n* Head of Linguistics: Chen Hao Xuan \n* Tactical Theology Consultant: Cole Jackson\n\nAlongside their respective departments. The following is a transcript of their first meeting together.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n-----\n**Lim:** (//claps hands together//) Welcome everyone. Happy to have you all working on this project. So far so good, and as //far// as I can see, things are gonna stay good. First order of business: how's progress coming along? Oh! And how's everyone doing today?\n\n**Leopoldo:** We've begun running diagnostic tests on the Ontological Linkage System, before starting any actual conceptual manipulation. We're also waiting on a shipment of metallic hydrogen so we can continue to power the dumb thing.\n\n**Vivier:** Your request has already been received and processed, expect an arrival in two days time.\n\n**Leopoldo:** Can't get it any sooner?\n\n**Vivier:** Logistics is a well-oiled machine, not some exclusive club. We're not Amazon.\n\n**Leopoldo:** I guess..\n\n**Lim**: Well that's good to hear. Mr. Chen, how's your department fairing?\n\n**Chen:** Ah! Well, we've been settling in alright, accommodations have been satisfactory-- //my// accommodations have been satisfactory. We've already started our analysis of Western Neo-Aramaic, and are planning to cross reference with what we know about [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-180 SCP-INT-0264] in order to start making changes. With assistance from Memetics, of course.\n\n**Popova:** Of course. My team and I are also looking over what we know about [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1098|SCP-1098]]] and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-947|SCP-947]]], making sure whatever we create doesn't get out of hand. Oh, and I like the break room tv.\n\n**Lim:** Right, off to a great start I see. Let's get down to business. Is there a status update on the situation earlier?[[footnote]]Supply Assistant Camille Gustave had tripped on a power cable during the construction process pulling several wires during his fall, causing a site-wide blackout. The resources originally planned to complete the construction of the O.L.S had to be used for repairs and restore power to Site-11 and the Logistics Department had not supplied any extra materials as the Department of Engineering requested. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Vivier:** I recognize that a member of my department was the cause of this recent blackout, and as department head I take full responsibility for this setback.\n\n**Leopoldo:** A setback that could've been doubly avoided if we were given the full set of resources we requested.\n\n**Vivier:** Well, that's on you.\n\n**Leopoldo:** ...Excuse me?\n\n**Vivier:** If you did not receive all the materials you required, then that is because you filed an incomplete request.\n\n**Leopoldo:** We... I-- (//exhales//) I sent you, the request, and--\n\n**Vivier:** And I delivered the requested materials, just as I promised.\n\n**Leopoldo:** You //explicitly// denied the full request.\n\n**Vivier:** No. What happened was that you sent an email, which was processed, and then hours later sent a second email asking for surplus, which was denied.\n\n**Leopoldo:** It wasn't goddamn surplus, that was the full order!\n\n**Vivier:** Then you should have included them in the first email. \n\n**Leopoldo:** We would have, if we knew a pipe was gonna burst thirty minutes later and start spraying everyone with phonetic refuse. Do you know how hard it is to organize an emergency clean-up when everyone keeps pronouncing their words with too many vowels?\n\n**Vivier:** That... does sound inconvenient. I am sorry that happened, but there is nothing I could have done.\n\n**Leopoldo:** ...No, no you could have done something! You could've given my department the //goddamn// things we needed!\n\n**Vivier:** //As// I said before, Dr. Leopoldo, Logistics is a well-oiled machine. You can't just... break the machine when it isn't doing what you want!\n\n**Lim:** Alright this is going in circles. Now, Mr. Vivier, if you were informed that the requested shipment was for an emergency situation, surely you would be a bit more lenient, yes?\n\n**Vivier:** I...... well, hm. Yes... there are procedures for that. But- but only if those situations are, in truth, emergencies. I have had more than one-- I have had... occurrences, wherein people would lie in order to abuse the system.\n\n**Lim:** Dr. Leopoldo, I trust you would not do the same?\n\n**Leopoldo:** Yeah, yeah. I cut down a cherry tree and never told a lie again, and all that.\n\n**Vivier:** I don't watch movies, I don't get that reference.\n\n**Lim:** Mr. Chen, Dr. Popova, how're things running on your end?\n\n**Chen:** Slow-going, as Dr. Popova and I have run into... creative differences.\n\n**Lim:** How so?\n\n**Popova:** Chen's too much of a perfectionist to get anything done.\n\n**Chen:** I'm not being a perfectionist, I'm trying to modify a mundane language into an anomalous one.\n\n**Popova:** Heheh, and I'm trying to make a memetic antimeme, but you don't see me sitting around with my thumbs in my ass.\n\n**Chen:** No, but I do see you and your team shotgun blasting half-baked memes and then calling it a day.\n\n(//Popova leans forward.//)\n\n**Chen:** \"I don't take kindly to having my work insulted.\"\n\n**Popova:** I don't take kindly to having my work insul-- fuck.\n\n**Lim:** From what I was told beforehand, you're trying to develop small prototype words to test out. Let Chen work on the language until it has an internal logic, then let Popova graft some memes onto a few words and phrases.\n\n**Popova:** Sure.\n\n**Chen:** Alright.\n\n**Popova:** That reminds me. Uh, uh, Leopoldo. (//snaps fingers//) There's something you learned that you said would be a problem for the project.\n\n**Leopoldo:** That's right. While mapping out the local noosphere, we discovered conceptual barriers that seem to be blocking any attempt to construct a universal language. They also show Akiva radiation signatures.\n\n**Lim:** Okay. No worries, I'll request for some experts in this subject matter to come down and give us a hand. \n\n-----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum INT-050.2:** Experimentation Logs\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **AUDIO LOG**\n----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n**Chen:** Linguistics Head Chen speaking. I thought it would be wise to record some… musings, on the work we are carrying out here. This project is a important step forward, and for reasons of posterity I think that future generations should know our thought processes. Previously, we had operated on the unspoken assumption that English would be the official language of the Foundation. This idea is a relic of our past and our founding. As the world we protect moves into the future, so shall we. \n\n//Chen pauses. A page can be heard turning.//\n\nSCP-050-INT is our opportunity to create a rigorous framework for that future, resistant to info-hazards and outside interference. It is our opportunity to bring a greater unity to our scattered branches, and foster a new age of cooperation. Our first trials will focus on this aspect. I have- \n\n//A loud cough is heard in the background.// \n\nRight, sorry, Researcher Popova and I have created a crude prototype, consisting only of a limited vocabulary. So far. We plan to introduce it to personnel, who will be attempting to communicate. If all goes well, they will be able to completely understand each other. End of dictation.\n----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n||~ TEST ||~ TEST SUMMARY ||~ NOTES ||\n|| SCP-050-INT was shown to Senior Researchers Akira Kitsui[[footnote]]Virtual Anomalies Department, JP/PH branch.[[/footnote]] and Nicholas Jonas[[footnote]]Department of Worldwide Phenomena and Anomalies, EN branch.[[/footnote]] before the start of the experiment. They were then tasked to converse for around ten minutes on any topic. || The two researchers conversed without issue for the first five minutes before Dr. Kitsui asked about Dr. Jonas’ day. He responded by talking about what he had for breakfast, mentioning that he had a cup of coffee and a mango. Upon mentioning that he ate a mango, Dr. Kitsui asked him to repeat himself and when he did so, she began yelling at him. The two then began arguing for the next three minutes before Dr. Kitsui stormed out of the interview room.|| Further research found that “mango” sounded very similar to a Japanese slang, which may have caused the prototype memetic to mistranslate the word into something offensive and cause Dr. Kitsui to mishear what Dr. Jonas was trying to say. ||\n|| An updated prototype of SCP-050-INT was shown to Senior Researchers Leon Choo Boon Kwee[[footnote]]English Communications, EN/JP branch.[[/footnote]] and Alexandre Lavigne[[footnote]]Department of Ancient History, FR branch.[[/footnote]]. They were then tasked to converse for around ten minutes on any topic. || During the conversation, Dr. Choo mentioned that during his return to Singapore, he ate Swedish meatballs at an IKEA. Dr. Lavigne began laughing uncontrollably for a minute before quickly clarifying what Dr. Choo said. The two seemingly laughed it off before continuing with their conversation. || Further research found that the French term for “Swedish meatballs” sounded similar to “Swedish balls”, which caused Dr. Lavigne to misinterpret what Dr. Choo was trying to say. ||\n|| An updated prototype of SCP-050-INT was shown to Senior Researcher  Rokugo Nakano[[footnote]]Anomalous Humanoid Welfare, JP branch.[[/footnote]] and Junior Researcher Wang Yu Rui[[footnote]]Junior Containment Specialist, CN branch.[[/footnote]] before the start of the experiment. They were then tasked to converse for around ten minutes. || During their conversation, Dr. Wang asked Dr. Nakano about her prosthetic arm[[footnote]]Dr. Nakano had lost her right arm in a containment breach at Site-19 7 years ago.[[/footnote]]. As they continued conversing about it, Dr. Nakano visibly became more and more uncomfortable until she excused herself from the testing room. She was later found crying at the Site’s reception area. || A later interview with her found that the memetic affected Dr. Wang’s tone when they conversed, causing him to sound like he was making fun of her. ||\n|| An updated prototype of SCP-050-INT was shown to Junior Researchers Hyun-Ji[[footnote]]Department of Spatial Anomalies, KO branch.[[/footnote]] and Marcin Nowak[[footnote]]Digital Entities Department, PL branch.[[/footnote]]. They were then tasked to converse for around ten minutes.|| Around three minutes into the test, the two researchers began arguing with each other. They continued yelling at each other for another minute before a short scuffle ensued, causing security personnel to enter to separate them. || Further investigation revealed that the memetic malfunctioned roughly three minutes into the test and began mistranslating their words into insults. ||\n|| An updated prototype of SCP-050-INT was shown to Junior Researcher Camille Gustave[[footnote]]Department of Logistics, FR branch.[[/footnote]] and Assistant Engineer Moreno Averielle[[footnote]]Department of Engineering, ES branch.[[/footnote]]. They were tasked to converse for around ten minutes on any topic. || The memetic malfunctioned roughly five minutes into the conversation. Both researchers were re-administered the memetic, but it once again stopped working around three minutes into the conversation. The memetic was re-administered to them two more times, with it working for a shorter period each time before the test was called off. || Further investigation found that due to the constant modifications to the prototype memetic, the core foundations of it, which include how long it will last after administration, have been altered fundamentally. This drastically decreased how long the memetic’s effective duration was. ||\n----\n@@ @@\nWith the completion of the Ontological Linkage System, a battery of tests were carried out by the Engineering department. These tests were carried out with the intention of determining the limits of the O.L.S, the efficacy of a successful conceptual splice, and the ease of manipulating a dense concept such as Western Neo-Aramaic.\n@@ @@\n||~ TEST ||~ TEST SUMMARY ||~ NOTES ||\n|| The first test of the Ontological Linkage System consisted of combining the concept of \"Umami\" with  the concept of \"Junior Researcher Muñoz\" for five minutes before reverting the change.|| Those who thought of Muñoz during the test experienced a savoury flavour, which also extended to saying her name or conversing with her. || \"My nametag still tastes like soy sauce.\" - Jr Researcher Muñoz.||\n||Researchers created a fake language consisting of a few simple words and named it \"Testese\". This language was then spliced with \"Imperceptible\" and \"Secret\"||Reseachers involved immediately forgot how to speak \"Testese\" and could not perceive the vocabulary they had noted down prior to the test. || \"Whoever came up with that name should be very grateful that I literally can't remember who it was\" - Dr Popova.|| \n||First test in splicing concepts into the Western Neo-Aramaic language.

As such, the gateway to conceptual reality, no longer held in place by the SRA array, began to spread throughout the Engineering department. \n\nThis caused vast amounts of damage to the facility, as much of the matter contained within was transmuted into neighbouring concepts. For example, the standard epoxy resin coating on walls, floors and ceilings was converted into a mixture of honey, pine sap and an unknown crystalline substance which bore a strong electrical charge. Due to its conceptually dense shielding, the O.L.S itself was largely unaffected, but much of the site had to be replaced and repaired, setting research back considerably. In addition, Engineering Technician Edilio Gil disappeared during the incident, and was presumed dead. It was later determined that the malfunction in the SRA array was caused by a sudden and unexplained spike in background Akiva radiation, which overloaded the array as it attempted to return the levels to baseline.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n**Leopoldo:** Is this thing on? Oh, good, okay. Hello. This is Engineering Head Leopoldo. Chen said that they were recording some of their in progress work “for future generations”. Whatever that means. Kept bugging me to do it so here we are. Guess I’ll show you what we have been working on. \n\n//Leopoldo picks up the camera, turning it to face a colossal structure.  A metal circle is filled with a sharp white energy. The circle is entangled with pipes and wires, through which various fluids can be seen moving.// \n\n**Leopoldo:** That is the Ontological Linkage System. This is the main tool we are using to carry out the development of SCP-050-INT. Now, if I were to go through there, I would dissolve into a semi-fluid non-mass of ideas and concepts. Very painful, I’ve heard. However, I’m not going through. For that job, we have created this, the Leopoldo Conceptual Splicer, Mark 2. \n\n//The camera turns to show a boxy drone with six short legs, encased in a reflective chrome shell.// \n\n**Leopoldo:** We’ve designed the LCS MK2 to be quite conceptually dense. If most people can’t understand the terms we use to describe it, we find that helps prevent semiotic diffusion. On top of that, whilst in operation, we have a helpful volunteer. \n\n//The camera pans to Junior Researcher Muñoz, seated in a chair with various electrodes attached to her head. Her face is strained in concentration.// \n\n**Leopoldo:** Muñoz here is keeping the LCS MK2 firmly pictured in her mind’s eye, which should help keep it conceptually stable. You ready?\n\n**Muñoz:** Yes sir, ready when you are.\n\n//Sitting at a computer, Leopoldo begins to manoeuvre the LCS MK2 into the O.L.S.// \n\n**Leopoldo:** Now, there isn't really any physical reality to the other side, so actually knowing where you are is difficult. Progress has been…. slow. But, what we are doing, bit by bit, is pruning concepts from the Western Neo-Aramaic language, and attaching concepts we want. I have spent the last month creating conceptual links between it and ‘secret’, as part of our anti-memetic efforts. What you are seeing now is the last touches before we can hand over to Popova for counter-meme synthesizing. \n\n//30 minutes pass as Leopoldo concentrates on operating the LCS MK2 and guides it back through the O.L.S. to physical reality.

Gil then collapsed to the floor and fell unconscious due to a severe chemical overdose. Following an extensive medical check-up and brief education in ASL, he was transferred to a specialist veterinary site for treatment and research. It is believed that Gil's transformation was caused by the relative conceptual adjacency of humans and monkeys. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum INT-050.3:** Countermeasures to Divine Elements\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n-----\n**Lim:** Alright team, before we get into the progress updates, I would like to give a warm welcome to Mr. Cole Jackson. \n\n(//Short round of applause and greetings.//)\n\n**Lim:** Mr. Jackson will be our Tactical Theology consultant and liaison.

This resulted in both Departments’ laboratories, cafeterias, dormitories and offices to be completely flooded, which also resulted in nearly $50,000 of damages to equipment, resources and personal belongings. \n\nDuring a later inspection, surveillance footage of the Memetics laboratory revealed that the Technician Gil, whilst in a panicked state due to being transformed into a Crab-eating Macaque, had loosened a pipe fitting when he broke into the lab. This went unnoticed as the Site had been preoccupied replacing the other damaged equipment.

First up on the schedule, we’re meeting with Popova to work out some snags with the security side of Foundationese.\n\n**[20 minutes of extraneous footage removed]**\n\n**Jackson:** So essentially, the initial idea is that Akivan entities, usually immune to anti-memetic effects, won't be able to even comprehend it.

Really interesting stuff. Basically, the Talmudic interpretation is that these entities are literally incapable of understanding Aramaic, and since we used that as the base, we should be in the clear. As all you folks at home know, we have to do some difficult things for our work, with the best interests of others at heart.

After all, most Foundation members just decide to pick up another language at some point, especially if they work with other branch staff on a regular basis. However, a nice little bonus of this language is how, thanks to its anti-memetic effects, most people can’t even comprehend what you’re saying. This can be especially handy with any entities that like to mess around with geases, contracts or other sorts of binding agreements. But now that we know that, how can we put it into action?\n\n//Jackson approaches the Djinn, unnoticed from behind.// \n\n**[2 hours of extraneous footage removed]**\n\n**Jackson:** By infecting entities with Foundationese, we can communicate with those who we could not before.

We didn't steal the meme, we were doing our jobs: analysing the prototype for signs of divine interference. Your experiments kept failing, and while I can't say I know much about the process of making an anomalous meme, from the outside it looked like you and your team were doing everything right. So, we looked for any evidence of outside influence.\n\n**Popova:** Well I appreciate the concern, but I would've appreciated it more if you actually //asked us first//.\n\n**Jackson:** But... we did.

Walking in the opposite direction is Lim, who is talking to another member of staff.//)\n\n**Lim:** Keep them from meeting like they're the goddamn beryllium hemispheres of the demon core. The auditor's going to be in less than an hour-- ah mi- mi- mis- mister- mister Perez! Hello. Welcome!\n\n(//Perez sniffs.//)\n\n**Perez:** Doctor Lim, I presume.\n\n**Lim:** Yes, that would be me.\n\n(//The other staff member leaves.//)\n\n**Lim:** ...Would you like me to show you around?\n\n**Perez:** It's what I'm here for.\n\n(//Perez follows Lim down the hallway.//)\n\n(//The two enter the workroom of the Engineering Department: messy workbenches dot the space, with splotches of syrup stains visible on the floor. The O.L.S. rests in a powered-off state, with structural damage visible.//)\n\n**Perez:** I, uh, see your machine here seems in need of repairs.\n\n**Lim:** Ah, yes. Dr. Leopoldo informed me...\n\n(//Behind Perez, Ramiel can be seen approaching the two, smiling and waving. Leopoldo and Muñoz rush to the entity's sides, attempting to direct it away by convincing it of a fish rehabilitation aquarium in another room.//)\n\n**Lim:** ...eeeeeeeee...\n\n(//Perez begins to turn around.//)\n\n**Lim:** THE!\n\n(//Perez's gaze snaps back.//)\n\n**Lim:** The, the, yes. The... water filtration system broke, and so this part of the project has been paused, wh-while we wait for repairs.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard.//)\n\n(//Leopoldo gives Lim an \"all clear\" gesture as he and Muñoz shove Ramiel out of the room. Lim directs Perez further into the site.//)\n\n**Lim:** The project has had more than a few hiccups recently, so I apologize for the harried state we must look like.\n\n**Perez:** I am well aware of the... //incidents// that have been occurring here.\n\n(//As Perez looks down to take notes, █████████ exits from a doorway down the hall.//)\n\n**Lim:** Ah, here we are!\n\n(//Lim quickly pushes Perez into the nearby Memetics Department laboratory: broken glass is collected atop the tables. The door to the testing chamber is ajar, with visible damages in the chamber itself.//)\n\n**Lim:** Uh, Memetics is a very hands-on profession. Can't expect to get a contagious idea out the door without getting your hands a little dirty, haha.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard. Bright light can be seen emanating from under the door behind him.//)\n\n**Lim:** I believe you might find the test chamber to be of interest.\n\n(//Perez enters the chamber with Lim. █████████ phases through the wall into the laboratory, with Popova and Jackson rushing in after it. Lim observes this through the glass divider.//)\n\n**Perez:** Hm. (//Looks at the ceiling then back to Lim.//) You're sweating quite a bit.\n\n**Lim:** Ah, yeah. The AC broke. Like I said before, the water filtration for the site is in need of repairs.\n\n**Perez:** I didn't think air conditioners needed water to work.\n\n**Lim:** Oh these are a different kind. From Sweden. They're built different.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard. Popova requests the entity to leave, citing fragile equipment. █████████ responds. Popova wipes the blood from her nose.//)\n\n(//Light from the entity reflects off the clipboard and into Perez's eye. As he begins to turn around, Popova switches on the shutters, obscuring the glass divider.//)\n\n**Perez:** (//Points.//) Why is that window black all of a sudden?\n\n**Lim:** One way glass. Helps with testing.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard. Jackson repeats Popova's request in Enochian. The entity complies, opening the door and leaving. The two department heads turn off the shutters before following suit. Perez looks back up.//)\n\n**Perez:** I thought you said this was one way glass?\n\n**Lim:** Oh, it is! Situational one way glass; the see-through side switches every hour. Uh... anomalous manufacture, Foundation made.\n\n**Perez:** I fail to see how something like this would be practical.\n\n**Lim:** Hey, can't argue with results.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard.//)\n\n(//The two walk to the site's garage, which is under the purview of the Logistics Department: the space is in relative order, save for a couple small upturned crates and a supply truck with its trunk door broken open.//)\n\n(//Perez walks over to inspect the truck. A staff member approaches Lim and informs him that █████████ recently summoned its \"superior\", John, to the site as well.//)\n\n(//Perez stands at the rear of the truck; a humanoid entity with four wings, arms, and heads[[footnote]]Specifically those of a human, lion, ox, and eagle.[[/footnote]] walks out from behind the front of the truck.//)\n\n(//The staff member rushes towards John and directs it back behind the truck. Perez notices the commotion starts walking to the front; the staff member pushes John to the rear.//)\n\n**Perez:** Who was that?\n\n**Lim:** Oh, they were just informing me that a printer malfunction has been fixed.\n\n**Perez:** Doesn't seem like a very pertinent thing to be updated on.\n\n**Lim:** Well, each wing of the site is only allowed one printer.\n\n(//Perez writes down on his clipboard and walks to the other side of the truck; John is moved to the opposite side.//)\n\n(//Vivier enters the garage and approaches the entity. He informs it that any divine emissaries that wish to enter the garage must fill out the proper paperwork, as the materials housed within could potentially harm them or vise versa. John eagerly accepts and leaves the room with him.//)\n\n(//Perez finishes writing and walks over to Lim.//)\n\n**Perez:** While messy, things seem to be in general order.\n\n**Lim:** Wonderful! Now--\n\n**Perez:** But before I leave, there's some things you can't hide very easily.\n\n**Lim:** Uhh what?\n\n**Perez:** Hand them over.\n\n**Lim:** H-hand over what?\n\n**Perez:** Your receipts. The numbers for your purchases don't lie.\n\n**Lim:** (//small sigh of relief//) Of course, yes.\n\n(//Lim leads Perez to his office, where he shows him the site's financial records on his computer.//)\n\n**Perez:** I'm, uh, seeing lots of purchases for equipment replacements. Lot of them due to human conflict.\n\n**Lim:** It's a bit ironic, that a project with the goal of creating unity would have so much discourse.\n\n**Perez:** And... huh. I have to be honest, I was expecting the claims about the monkey to be a load of bullshit.\n\n**Lim:** Oh, no. The monkey was painfully real.\n\n(//Perez finishes reviewing the records and stands up.//)\n\n**Perez:** Well, looks like you aren't performing money laundering after all.\n\n(//Perez opens the door and turns around.//)\n\n**Perez:** I suppose I have to respect someone who's running an O5's pet project, especially since it's going this badly.\n\n**Lim:** Oh yeah, tell me about it. It's... (//sighs//). I... try to keep my head up most of the time. I'm a glass half full kinda guy. But... at times, it feels like the everything's conspiring against us. When the world is crumbling around you, and you feel useless in the face of it. Sometimes it gets so overwhelming that... it all just seems pointless.\n\n**Perez:** Listen, I know how it feels: to have everything riding on your shoulders, and try as you might, your best just isn't good enough. But you have to stick with it. The odds may seem overwhelming, but you gotta be stubborn in the face of it all. And hey, if you beat your head against the wall enough, maybe a crack will form, and sometimes that's all you really need to push through.\n\n**Lim:** I... yeah. Thanks.\n\n**Perez:** (//Softly chuckles//) Who knew creating a universal language was this hard?\n\n**Ramiel:** What?\n\n(//Perez looks out the doorway: all three entities are present//)\n\n**John:** (//In four voices//) Did thy say... \"universal language?\"\n\n(//The site rumbles.//)\n> [[=]]\n> **EMERGENCY CAMERA FEED**\n> [[/=]]\n> A heavy storm is present outside the Site-11. The clouds part, and a large, indeterminate mass[[footnote]]Descriptions of the mass are inconsistent among observers, but common appearances are a human hand, a technologically advanced aircraft or throne, and a lion's face covered with eyeballs or an eyeball covered in lion faces.[[/footnote]]  protrudes out and towards the site. A bright light flashes from the tip of the mass, and all personnel present at the facility report hearing the following phrase:\n> [[=]]\n> \"STRIKE 2\"\n> [[/=]]\n> The mass vanishes.\n\n-----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-050-int/offset/1 |Warning!
