  "content": "**Update 8/31/2011:** There are now three of us missing, so we are redacting all researcher names.\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6006\n\n**Object Class:** Unknown\n\n**Special Containment Procedures**: Evidence of the existence of SCP-6006 must be kept only in this file. The Foundation's anomaly numbering system has been modified to prevent reassignment of this number.\n\nFurther evidence regarding the phenomena must be collected in this file. Those of us who have experienced an event related to SCP-6006 are required to meet every third Thursday at the 'usual meeting place', at which point two of us must enter a password into the embedded deadman switch program. If this procedure is not carried out for two consecutive months it will cause these containment procedures to self-destruct.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6006 is an unofficial designation for the events, people, and evidence surrounding ongoing attempts to infiltrate the Foundation.\n\nThe files collected, when analyzed as a whole, provide strong evidence to suggest that the Foundation has, through careful and granular replacement of components, personnel and resources, been fundamentally altered over time. This evidence consists of interview logs, photographs, and personal experiences which suggest that the Foundation and its mission was at one time focused on the utilization of - and cohabitation and cooperation with - anomalies.\n\n[[include component:coltop show=Addendum 6006.1: Initial collection of data | hide= Addendum 6006.1: Initial collection of data]]\n\n+++ Document 6006.A\n\nIn December 2008, a Foundation security operations tech performing a routine cleaning of Foundation assets discovered emails in a disconnected backup server at Site-██.

In this report, the Chair of the Board answers many questions which have been fielded in the past several months regarding our ongoing efforts to maintain a quality standard of living for sapient species under our care and observation.\n\nThrough our partners, liaisons with the anomalous community, and continued outreach programs, we are making a difference. The full report is available at [REDACTED]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nThe operations tech, Lt. M, suspected the email to be either test data or intentionally-planted misinformation. They shared their findings with a peer, Dr. C, who agreed.\n\nThe next day, Dr. C. did not appear for work. Lt. M. reports that Dr. C.'s office was empty, and several other Foundation peers did not question the sudden absence. Lt. M did not initiate any queries into the matter, assuming it had been related to an unrelated containment procedure or protocol.\n\n+++ Document 6006.B 1-5\n\nIn early 2009, another researcher named Dr. S. encountered a database error which dumped several collected pieces of unencrypted, but highly-corrupted, data from a Foundation server.\n\n++++ 6006.B1\n\n> D-4≡22: There's doors here.

Why would you, as a committee, try to stand in the way of that during such a tumultuous time in our society? It is only through mutual respect that we can move forward and make a difference.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding-left:1em; border-left:1px solid silver;\"]]\nWe've fielded a lot of questions about this. We have done more for them than anyone else. We care. We communicate. Look at SCP-049. These advances in medicine. We couldn't have done so many things with that without his help. It's created a real sense of wholesome living. It's not a prison. Anyone who says that doesn't respect these people. They are happier here and we've done so much for them. Ask any of them, and they'll tell you the same thing.\n\nIf you're out there, and you're anomalous, and you're in contact with us, then I say what the hell do you have to lose? You’re living in poverty. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of you are unemployed. Last in crime, last in home ownership, last in the economy, lowest wages. You have no education, you have no jobs. You don't want to live that way, come on.\n\nSo what do you do? Let us //know// you're having a problem and you //let us// help you. We have programs. You take //advantage// of what's given to you. Imagine. Peace and harmony. It's assisted living. It's tailor-made. You don't have to be afraid here.\n\nWhat has happened to the respect for authority, the fear of retribution by the courts, society and the police? We have the power to keep you safe. And not just the people in that community, right?\n\nOutreach. We need outreach. Where is our outreach? I'm calling on Foundation leadership for more funding toward outreach. Let's take these people by the hand. Bring them into the fold, put them at one of our many, many safe and secure locations. They're all over the place, you don't have to go far from home, you don't need to be afraid. You can see your family every day if you want to. And you don't have to worry about the way the towns you live in feel about you.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nHow are comments like this acceptable?

The evidence, it was determined, suggested that the Foundation had previously had a different purpose: protecting anomalous people and objects from the outside world. Given the likeliness that amnestics were involved in the previously-described evidence, it was agreed that minutes would be taken and added to this file in order to maintain evidence of the meetings to safeguard against future suppression attempts.\n\n[[table style=\"border: 1px solid silver;\"]]\n[[row]][[cell colspan=\"2\"]]Minutes[[/cell]][[/row]]\n[[row]][[cell colspan=\"2\"]]Unofficial meeting, November 13, 2010 0915 GMT[[/cell]][[/row]]\n[[row]][[cell]]Present:[[/cell]][[cell]]Dr. S., Researcher[[/cell]][[/row]]\n[[row]][[cell]][[/cell]][[cell]]Prof. H., Containment Specialist[[/cell]][[/row]]\n[[row]][[cell]][[/cell]][[cell]]Dr. B., Researcher[[/cell]][[/row]]\n[[row]][[cell]][[/cell]][[cell]]Lt.

Upon being presented with proof of having attended this meeting, Prof. H. expressed anger and volunteered for research.\n\nDir. R. made the hypothesis that, if this suppression had been aided by the application of Amnestics, that applied Mnestics as well as cognitive therapy such as hypnosis might give insight into what information was being suppressed.

M:** Minimum security site, maybe?\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Even those have electronic locks outside the door. This one's just a deadbolt. Though...the building looks like it's been abandoned for a while. Might be before electronic was standard. But that would have been the 80's...\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Hm. Door's unlocked. //(pushes the door open manually)//\n> \n> **Dir. R:** There //are// facilities with open fronts. Ones that pose as businesses.\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Well, sure, but this one's in the middle of the woods.\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Fair.\n> \n> **Dr. B:** Got it. You guys still hearing me? You're coming in clear here.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Affirmative. Lobby's got water damage, overgrowth. Lots of open doors. //(pause)// There's a layer of dust on the floor that's pretty thick. Looks like we're leaving footprints. No sign of any others.\n> \n\n++++ 1320\n\n> \n> **Dr. S:** You smell that?\n> \n> **Dir. R:** I do. Burnt plastic?\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Yeah. Smells like fabrication equipment. Styrene, maybe.\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Where to, Lieutenant?\n> \n> **Lt.

Hit me like a brick wall is all. Looks like an open lobby area. Sending you a snapshot.\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Might be coming from there. There's a dark residue around that door. //(pause)// Want to take the doors in order or take that one first?\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Let's go in order. //(opens the nearest door)//\n>\n> **Dr. S:** What are those things? I've never seen any machine like it.\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Those...those are Bright/Zartion Hominid Replicators. //(pause)// Now we know how it's being done.\n> \n> **Dr. S:** So you think they actually...printed Foundation employees.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** And the infiltrators—whoever they are—they're using Foundation technology?\n> \n> **Dir. R:** But I don't understand why. If the Foundation's mission was once coexistence, why did that change?\n> \n> **Dr. S:** There's a connected office over here. I see some computers, some credentials printers...there's enough stuff in here to outfit any duplicate with imitation Foundation credentials.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Which just leaves the question: What about the originals?\n\n++++ 1355\n\n> //(They proceed to the next room.)//\n> \n> **Dr. S:** //(softly)// Shit.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** We've got...lab equipment. Medical slab. Morgue, operating room, hard to tell.\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Definitely an operating theater. There's a VSM[[footnote]]Vital signs monitor.[[/footnote]] over there. And there's a window over there into the next room, which might be for observation.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Good call.\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Is there someone on that slab?\n> \n> **Lt. M:** I think so. I'm approaching it. //(pause)// Well, it certainly //was// someone. Near complete decomp. Just bones left. Doctor, want to give your professional opinion on the deceased?\n> \n> //(Dr. S approaches and examines the skeletal remains.)//\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Human or close approximate. Sex likely female, rib pitting suggests around 40 years of age. It's been here for 12, maybe 18 months. \n> \n> **Dir. R:** Cause of death?\n> \n> **Dr. S:** Nothing obvious. No blunt trauma or anything. Can't do much else without labwork. //(Dr. S takes samples. Lt.

M:** You do?\n> \n> **Dir. R:** //(hands the bag to Lt. M.)// Car key fob. House keys. Brown wallet containing civilian credentials.

M:** //(deep, audible breath)// Director, if you're suspecting what I think you are, then—\n> \n> **Dir. R:** I know.\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Before I open this, would you mind—\n> \n> **Dir. R:** Of course. //(Hands Lt. M her sidearm.)// Thank you for your—your courtesy. L-let me know what you want me to—\n> \n> **Lt. M:** Just relax, Director.

And then underlined: 'No outside forces.'\n> \n> **Dr. S:** What does 'No outside forces' mean?\n> \n> **Dir. R:** I don't know, but I just realized something. Something that hasn't shown up in any of the documents that have been recovered. The O5s.\n> \n> **Dr. S:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **Dir. R:** They're not in any of the files. No references to them. Everything we have has been to, from, or about the Ethics Committee.
