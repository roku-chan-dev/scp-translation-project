The exact cause or reason for O5-1's disappearance is currently unknown, and a Top-Priority investigation is currently being conducted by the Overseer Council to find the whereabouts of O5-1 and the culprit, if there is one.\n\n**History:** On September 8th, 2019, an O5 Council Summit was held. All parties were registered as having attended, save for O5-1, whose presence wasn't detected at the meeting. After waiting an hour for O5-1 to appear, the remaining twelve Overseers dispatched units from MTF Alpha-1 (\"Red Right Hand\") and STF Alpha-0 (\"Backstreet Boys\") to their physical and spiritual residence. O5-1's spiritual residence was noted to have completely deteriorated, with trace amounts of an unidentifiable concept. Their physical residence, on the other hand, showed signs of a break-in, with most of the windows and furniture being broken or otherwise damaged. No evidence pointing towards the identity of the malefactor was found, and the reason why the building's security systems did not activate is also unknown.\n\nAs of writing,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]%%updated_at|%Y/%m/%d%%.[[/span]] O5-1 is still considered missing, and no information has been found on their current location and status. Until O5-1 is found and safely recovered, the Ethics Committee is to take on the role of Acting O5-1.\n[[/module]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"One (1) New Update.

Due to this, O5-2 has been placed under high security, with a majority of MTF Alpha-1 assigned to safeguarding her and her location. O5-1 was declared KIA, and the Foundation is currently undergoing the process of promoting a new Council Member to take their spot.

Our animators work tirelessly in our studios to produce such fine products for you to enjoy. I believe we deserve just a little compensation for that.\n\nRegardless, I've added the Board of Directors to this email. Some of the people on this board have been here for ages.
