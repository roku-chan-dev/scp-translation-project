The chamber is not ventilated and is temperature controlled to 2° C. Dr. Roberts is not permitted to leave his containment chamber under any circumstances. No meals are to be supplied.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7727 refers to an anomalous scent produced by Dr. Jackson Roberts. SCP-7727 possesses a low odor detection threshold and high concentration, making it extremely potent and overpowering. The scent has been compared to Cadaverine[[footnote]] (CH2)5(NH2)2.[[/footnote]] and Putrescine[[footnote]] (CH2)4(NH2)2.[[/footnote]] by Foundation biochemists. \n\nTo date, Dr. Roberts is the only individual not affected by SCP-7727.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7727 first came to Foundation attention following various Human Resources complaints regarding Dr. Roberts. At first thought to be a personal problem, Dr. Roberts was ordered to take steps to improve his hygiene by HR personnel. After 16 further complaints were filed within a span of 3 days, Dr. Roberts was forcibly taken from his office during work hours and thoroughly bathed by two D-Class personnel supplied with gas masks. \n\nFollowing the conclusion of this bath, Dr. Roberts still exuded SCP-7727 and was taken to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-55|Site-55]]]'s Intake Department for processing. While present, two personnel fainted from the smell and the remaining five refused to process Dr. Roberts until they were similarly supplied with gas masks. \n\n**Addendum 7727.1:** The following attached document is a recorded conversation between Dr. Roberts and Researcher Chun, an Intake Department member assisting in Dr. Robert's processing.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Note: Chun had previously commanded Roberts to remove his clothing as part of the standard humanoid intake assessment procedure.//\n\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**Roberts:** This is so humiliating. \n\n**Chun:** It could be worse. \n\n**Roberts:** It can't be //that// bad, can it? I mean, come on. I shower just like everyone else! I put on deodorant //and// cologne!\n\n**Chun:** Sit still a moment, I'm trying to take your blood pressure.\n\n**Roberts:** Sorry.\n\n//[There is a ten-second silence.]//\n\n**Chun:** Stupid sphygmomanometer. It's probably broken. I can't seem to get a read on your blood pressure. Hold on. Let me grab a pulse oximeter. \n\n//[There is a five-second silence.]//\n\n**Roberts:** Is that one of those that goes on the finger?\n\n**Chun:** Yup.\n\n//[There is a five-second silence, followed by a beeping.]//\n\n**Chun:** Huh. What are the odds of my sphygmomanometer and oximeter being broken at the same time?\n\n//[Chun removes the oximeter from Roberts' finger, but half of his index finger comes along with the oximeter. Roberts recoils.]//\n\n**Roberts:** My finger! Aaaah!\n\n**Chun:** Don't be such a baby. We can grow it back.\n\n**Roberts:** You psychopath, you broke off my finger! What's the matter with you?!\n\n**Chun:** Dr. Roberts, please calm down. We can't process you if you keep yelling. \n\n**Roberts:** Fine.\n\n//[Chun reaches for his stethoscope.]//\n\n**Chun:** One last try. Let's see what's going on with you.\n\n//[There is an eight-second silence.]//\n\n**Chun:** Nothing. \n\n**Roberts:** What do you mean nothing?\n\n**Chun:** Exactly that. I got nothing. \n\n**Roberts:** Well... I feel fine. I guess nothing ain't so bad.\n\n**Chun:** Except for the fact that you stink.\n\n**Roberts:** Oh come on, it really can't be that bad if I can't even smell it!\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n\n//End-Note: Dr. Roberts continued to argue with Chun over the smell of SCP-7727 for approximately fifteen minutes before being escorted to his new containment chamber. On the way, Dr. Roberts stubbed his toe against a wall and complained about it coming unattached but was quickly stopped from complaining by guard personnel. Dr. Roberts' next of kin were informed as per [[[family disclosure protocol]]] and direct containment of SCP-7727 began.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7726]]] | SCP-7727 | [[[SCP-7728]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n\n> **Filename:** stinky.jpg\n> **Name:** Dr. Batista\n> **Author:** Assembleia Legislativa do Paraná\n> **License:** CC BY SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/legislativopr/32085911838/\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
