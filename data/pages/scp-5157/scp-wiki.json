The original documentation is preserved below for posterity and access by lower-level personnel.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-5157\n\n**Object Class:** Pending\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A research team led by Dr. Levitt will maintain observation of SCP-5157 from Site 51, and pursue development of technologies capable of observing SCP-5157 with greater fidelity. Any development in SCP-5157’s behavior should result in notification of the site director, as SCP-5157’s conceptual fortitude is weak enough to threaten a CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenario.\n\nFoundation contacts will be positioned at all civilian astronomical observation sites technologically capable of detecting SCP-5157 to deter such an event. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5157 is the designation for an anomalous area of the sky positioned near Xi Piscium[[footnote]]SCP-5157 is offset from Xi Piscium by a declination of approximately +0°17′43″ and a negligible right ascension.[[/footnote]] possessing a remarkably low conceptual fortitude. SCP-5157 is of small enough celestial area as to make measurement inconvenient. Current estimates describe SCP-5157 as vaguely oblong, approximately 500km in length, 11.6ly from earth, and possessing a conceptual fortitude of -326.8 Humes.[[footnote]]A measure of conceptual fortitude, describing how resistant to anomalous warping reality is in a specific region. The baseline (non-anomalous) conceptual fortitude is 1 Hume.[[/footnote]] Little beyond this is known about SCP-5157 at this time.\n\nSCP-5157 was discovered on ██/███/1981 when it emitted a Level Cyan reality-destabilizing pulse, temporarily decreasing the ambient Hume levels of multiple Foundation sites to 0.98 Humes, disrupting the calibration of the containment system of SCP-████. SCP-5157 was not catalogued as an item until its conceptual fortitude was recorded as part of routine Site 51 observations on ██/███/1997, at which point it was upgraded to its current containment procedures.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Additional File / ██/███/2006 / Level 2 Clearance Required:\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n**Addendum SCP.5157.1 - First Imagery of SCP-5157**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Site 51 Internal Memo**\n**From:** Dr. Elizabeth Levitt\n**To:** Site Director Hayward\n----\nGreetings,\n\nAs you’re likely aware, the Celestial Conceptual Fortitude Array (CCFA) my team and I have been working on has reached functionality and begun surveillance of SCP-5157. The CCFA operates with enough precision that we’re finally able to discern the shape of SCP-5157 beyond a blur. The initial imagery we’ve received is concerning, to say the least. (See attached image.)\n\nSCP-5157’s documentation has been updated to reflect the new findings (also attached), and I’d like to request additional funding and staffing priority for the SCP-5157 project.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Elizabeth Levitt\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=erosandpsyche.png\n| caption=SCP-5157-A (left) and SCP-5157-B (right). \n| width=200px\n]]\n\n**Revised Description:** SCP-5157 is the collective designation for two entities (SCP-5157-A and SCP-5157-B) residing in nearby space, approximately 11.6ly from earth, and possessing a remarkably low conceptual fortitude (-483.7 Humes). The conceptual fortitude of the entities and the area surrounding them has decreased significantly since original discovery, and is projected to continue dropping as time passes. SCP-5157’s conceptual fortitude, if it continues dropping at its current rate, will cause a CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenario by the year 207█.\n\nSCP-5157-A is approximately 200km long, and is shaped like a masculine humanoid upper body with four arms. SCP-5157-B is 130km long, and is shaped like a feminine humanoid with skeletal wings in place of arms. The two entities are connected by a thin tether 10km in diameter, and slowly orbit each other.\n\nThe heads of the entities occasionally produce what are theorized to be transmissions, oscillating electromagnetic emissions consisting of all frequencies of light. Unfortunately, due to the constant movement of the entities, the relatively small size of their heads, and the low refresh rate of measuring equipment, accurate recording of these potential transmissions is infeasible at this time.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Additional File / ██/███/2007 / Level 3 Clearance Required:\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n\n**Addendum SCP.5157.2 - Incident Report 5157.██07**\n\nOn ██/███/2007, the conceptual fortitude of SCP-5157 decreased rapidly over the course of 13 minutes, descending to -783.9 Humes. The diffusion of lower Hume levels into the surrounding space constituted a Level Violet reality-destabilising pulse. The ambient Hume levels of Foundation sites dropped to 0.87 Humes, returning to their original levels after approximately two weeks.\n\nThis event coincided with multiple international containment breaches, including but not limited to [[[SCP-3160]]], [[[SCP-3166]]], and [[[SCP-4205]]]. Dr. Levitt was killed in the breach. Her responsibilities regarding SCP-5157 have been assumed by Senior Researcher Munro.\n\nThe conceptual fortitude of SCP-5157 has not returned to its value preceding the incident, and has continued decreasing at its previous rate. As such, the projected CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenario is now estimated to occur by 205█.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Additional File / ██/███/2009 / Level 3 Clearance Required:\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n**Addendum SCP.5157.3 - Transmissions**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**File 5157.AU.01**\n\n**Summary:** The first log recorded and analyzed, confirming the sentience of SCP-5157-A and SCP-5157-B. SCP-5157-A mentions an “ascension”, theorized to be the CK-class Reality Restructuring event the anomaly poses, given its description as transcendent beyond reality.\n\n----\n\n**SCP-5157-A:** My love, your beauty is yet beyond compare, your existence a pure release of true ecstasy and transcendence.\n\n**SCP-5157-B:** //[emits a noise described by D-724381 as “It’s… laughing, I think? Oh, god, it’s so beautiful, it burns.”]//\n\n**A:** My love for you grows infinite, and I know those that wish to keep us apart will never succeed. We shall never be apart. And yet, my love, this is not all that can be.\n\n**B:** No?\n\n**A:** Nay, for there are taller mountains to scale, and higher peaks to reach. You, my Psyche, are yet to //ascend// with me, and exist pure, central, the focus of reality, matter and mind.\n\n**B:** My darling Eros, you know I have not the strength for ascension. As much as I may wish to join you in that form of dreams beyond reality, I cannot.\n\n**A:** Cannot yet. Take my hand, let me guide you. The road may be long, and travels hard, but together we can brave all barriers, limited in power as you yet may be. I refuse to leave you behind, my exultant beauty, so we shall undertake this journey together.\n\n**B:** Then let us never be apart, my love. Success or failure, we shall never be separate. This is my oath to you, my decree of everlasting love.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**File 5157.AU.27**\n\n**Summary:** This recording is notable, as it contains the first reference to the tether than connects the entities, not clearly visible in the photography collected by the CCFA. Following this recording, the tether was identified in said photography.\n\n----\n\n**SCP-5157-A:** With this tie, we become one. Connected to our hearts, this cosmic tether shall ensure that never we are apart.\n\n**SCP-5157-B:** Do you feel that? Our hearts beat as one. Each pulse makes the galaxies a little more our own.\n\n**A:** Our union brings us closer to your //ascension//. The energy around us will slowly become us, my love, until our combined strength is enough to take us to that form beyond forms.\n\n**B:** Not now, perhaps not even soon, however. I doubt my vitality, even combined with your own, is yet even a fragment of what must be consumed to empower our ascension.\n\n**A:** My love, you mustn’t talk about yourself that way. If anything, it is I who is weighing you down.\n\n**B:** Perhaps we are neither weighing each other down, then. Together, as one, in unity. This bond makes us not two separate entities, but not one, either. Our love binds us into a conglomerate, a unit to ascend together.\n\n**A:** Indeed. And with you and I now together, anything is possible.\n\n**B:** But only as long as our love binds us.\n\n**A:** You should not doubt my devotion to you, my love. We shall never be apart, now.\n\n**B:** And that is all I could wish for.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**File 5157.AU.83**\n\n----\n\n**SCP-5157-A:** You look resplendent, my love.\n\n**SCP-5157-B:** Is that all?\n\n**A:** Of course not, my dear. But it takes time to think of new ways to describe your beauty without sounding as a false, pompous mortal trying to describe the sky they’ve seen for the first time to those who have only ever seen shadows on a cave wall.\n\n**B:** I do not mind, darling Eros. Perhaps I //want// to hear those words, because their coming from you makes them all the more sweet, for I know their honesty and truth. No melodies can compare, too alluring is hearing it whisper in my ear. I wish nothing more than to lay with you for all eternity, whether ascended or otherwise, because being with you is all I wish for in this existence or those beyond.\n\n**A:** That your lips do not spill charming lies, but I can see in your eyes you believe every word you say. And you call //me// more alluring than any melody, where you can weave prose that puts the beauty of the cosmos to shame, not even to speak of your beauty itself, speckled with stars that will one day create new life, new worlds.\n\n**B:** You flatter so. Do not speak as if your beauty, your form of infinite fantasy incomprehensibly choosing to orbit my own, is not infinitely superior in its allure to anything else this universe could offer. We shall guide each other down this road we’ve chosen, of love and ascension. I shall never let you go.\n\n**A:** And I, you.\n\n**B:** Together, we will find our way.\n\n**A:** Together, indeed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Current Documentation of SCP-5157 / Level 4 Clearance Required:\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n\n|item-number= 5157\n\n|clearance= 4\n\n|container-class= esoteric\n\n|secondary-class= apollyon\n\n|secondary-icon= http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Aanomaly-class-bar/apollyon-icon.svg\n\n|disruption-class= amida\n\n|risk-class= warning\n\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A research team led by Dr. Munro will maintain observation of SCP-5157 from Site 51, utilizing the Celestial Conceptual Fortitude Array (CCFA) to make measurements of the anomaly. Any development in SCP-5157’s behavior should result in notification of the site director.\n\nFoundation contacts will be positioned at all civilian astronomical observation sites technologically capable of detecting SCP-5157 to deter such an event. \n\nThe oscillating electromagnetic radiation emitted from the heads of SCP-5157-A and SCP-5157-B is to be recorded and transcribed in as close to real time as possible. In the event that the entities indicate that they are soon to lower their Hume levels and emit a reality-destabilizing pulse[[footnote]]Typically described by the entities as a“step closer to ascension”, a “sharing of power” or “making this world ours”.[[/footnote]], all high-risk items in the possession of the Foundation are to be locked down worldwide.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5157 is the designation of an area of nearby outer space, approximately 11.6ly from earth, that possesses a remarkably low conceptual fortitude (-1098.3 Humes). The conceptual fortitude of SCP-5157 has decreased significantly since original discovery, and is projected to continue dropping as time passes. SCP-5157’s conceptual fortitude, if it continues dropping at its current rate, will cause a CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenario by the year 203█.\n\nWithin SCP-5157 reside two entities of unknown composition, SCP-5157-A and SCP-5157-B. SCP-5157-A is [[[scp-2317|approximately 200km long,]]] and is shaped like a masculine humanoid upper body with four arms. SCP-5157-B is 130km long, and is shaped like a feminine humanoid with skeletal wings in place of arms. The two entities are connected by a thin tether, 10km in diameter, and slowly orbit each other.\n\nThe heads of the entities consistently produce electromagnetic radiation of oscillating amplitude and of all frequencies. These signals, when treated as oscillations in air pressure and played through speakers as such, manifest within the listener’s mind as a coherent conversation, apparently between the two entities. These conversations are of remarkable lexical complexity, and, while they may continue for days or months at a time, cover a very limited range of topics:\n\n* Discussion of the “ascension” of SCP-5157-B, aided by SCP-5157-A. This “ascension” is theorized to be the inevitable CK-class Reality Restructuring Scenario posed by SCP-5157.\n* Discussion of “others” that stand against the union of the entities. The identity of these “others” is unknown. ##F0F0F0|//The old gods stand steadfast against change.//##\n* Poetic expression of their love for one another.\n\nSince its discovery, SCP-5157 has emitted seven reality-destabilizing pulses, the most recent five of which have resulted in multiple worldwide containment breaches. There is no apparent method by which these effects can be mitigated. There is no available method by which the entities may be communicated with. There is no way to contain SCP-5157.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n##F0F0F0|//They cannot tear us apart, my love.\nI will not let them.//##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5156]]] | SCP-5157 | [[[SCP-5158]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
