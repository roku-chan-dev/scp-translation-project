Maria Johnston was standing on the right side of the room admiring her sister's drawings.\n\n\"You've really gotten good at this.\" Maria pulled a drawing off the wall of a futuristic soldier with a sword on his hip and a rifle that looked straight out of //Blade Runner//.\n\n\"Thanks. Since you have been away at college, I wanted to make some of my designs into reality.\" She made a sweeping motion with her hands. \"//The Heroes of the Future Collection//. Good name, right?\"\n\nMaria smiled and re-pinned the drawing. Her sister was already working on her next piece. She took a seat next to the drawing table, watching her work in progress.\n\n\"So, what's this one about?\" \n\n\"Well... this one is more of an action piece.\" She flipped through some sketches showing a soldier with high-tech gloves moving a box toward him with an unseen force.\n\n\"Teleportation gloves?\" Maria said. \"What purpose would that serve?\"\n\n\"During combat you could bring an enemy to you and get 'em with your sword!\" She made a stabbing motion. \"Or if you needed to move stuff quickly.\"\n\n\"Sounds kind of impractical. What if you didn't want to bring him into melee range?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"//Mareeeya,// it needs a skilled user! Obviously. Plus, it's all just fantasy. It works well because we want it to.\"\n\nMaria chuckled. \"I guess it does. Maybe you could give one to that... oh what would you call him? The one you drew up with the katana and the casual clothes... A 'Street Samurai'?\"\n\nHer sister raised her eyebrows, \"Street Samurai! I love it! Oh, I wish you could just stay here and help come up with concepts. You just had to go off to some fancy school to study biology.\"\n\n\"I'll be back home for the Summer, Mary. Then we'll see how your collection turned out.\"\n\n/1/\n\n//May 30th, 2022//\n\nA rolling crack of thunder startles Maria Johnston awake, pouring rain pounding against the window above her. It was in the afternoon, but the dark storm clouds above would have fooled anyone without access to a clock. She rubs her eyes as they adjust to the low light of the room.\n\n\"Hmmm?\" Johnston spotted a humanoid figure watching her and immediately jumped up against the backboard.\n\n\"Rise and Shine, gringo.\" The humanoid smiled. It assuaged Johnston's fear, but her heart beating heavy in her chest.\n\n\"Ugh, Avalerra!\" Johnston said, \"W-What are you doing here?\"\n\nMichaela Avalerra. MTF designation, Omega-45-4. SCP designation, [[[SCP-7261]]]-1. She was Johnston's closest confidant in the Foundation. \"Simple, this is the part of the vampire movie where I come in through the window and profess my love for you!\" \n\n\"Real funny. You better not be hiding the fact that you breached containment.\"\n\n\"Nope. You requested a thaumaturgic analysis of your house, remember? I'm the only thaumaturge on staff, so Richter sent me. With handlers to make sure I didn't act up, of course.\" \n\n\"Well? What did you find?\" Johnston's voice was still shaky and reeking of paranoia.\n\n\"Nothing. I checked every nook and cranny. No one is using magic to watch your house. Nor are there echoes of magic being used previously.\"\n\n\"Check again.\" Johnston said. \n\nAvalerra sighed.\"I did. Several times. You  really need to relax.\" Avalerra had concern in her voice.\n\n\"You weren't thorough enough. Corra is probably just manipulating us. Making us believe that she isn't watching!\" \n\n\"Johnston, listen to yourself.\" Avalerra crawled into bed with Maria. \"What is with you? Your blood reeks of cortisol and not garlic for once. I don't know which is worse, to be fair.\"\n\n\"I- ah\". Johnston took a deep breath. \"I don't know what to think about anything anymore. I just feel like I'm being watched all the time.\"\n\n\"Watched? Honey, you work for the damn Foundation. We're both being watched 24/7.\"\n\n\"No!  I mean by her. Corra. Not only is she manipulating every facet of our lives, but she has eyes everywhere. I just- can't take it.\" Johnston hung her head.\n\n\"No matter how you look at it, higher powers are always trying to manipulate us, Chica. But you always have a choice. Humans were given free will after all.\"\n\n\"But free will can be taken away.\" Johnston shook her head. \"I'm sorry you have to see me like this.\"\n\n\"Hey, you're the only reason I'm not just wasting away in my containment cell. Plus, you're our commander. I'm not the only one who's worried about you.\"\n\n\"I know, and I'm trying to be there for you guys but... I feel so overwhelmed. There's something wrong with the world. I think.\" Johnston got out of bed, leaning against her nearby dresser.\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"It doesn't feel strange that every other day there's a new anomaly to catch? Or some new GoI we have to fight? It didn't use to be like this... until those damn books showed up.\"\n\n\"I'm sure it's just a coincidence. Power tends to attract bad actors. Just look at the Sepulchrum.\"\n\n\"It's not just that. How did you get into my house?\"\n\n\"Through the front door?\"\n\n\"You know, that's not what I meant. The ritual. How did you perform it? Don't you need more than one Thaumaturge?\"\n\n\"Normally, but I managed it on my own. I just figured my magic was getting better.\" Avalerra pondered the situation, mouth slightly ajar.\n\n\"Your magic is stronger, isn't it? I've noticed it in my work too. Even with the anomalous, I've seen things that were thought impossible become possible.\"\n\n\"And you think the Set of Nine had something to do with it?\"\n\n\"It's just a theory for now. I remember reading something when I first joined the Foundation. It was a book speculating that the power of the anomalous waxes and wanes through history.\"\n\n\"Like the moon.\" Avalerra hopped out of bed and walked over to Johnston's desk.\n\n\"There's more evidence I've been gathering since I've been home. Sightings of the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7975 Chugwater Frogman] are up, Wilson's Wildlife's has reported a 150% increase in rescued critters in the past ye- Avalerra are you paying attention?\n\n\"Yeah, yeah, frogman. Who is this a picture of?\" Avalerra held up a picture of Johnston and a younger girl.\n\n\"That's Mary. My sister.\" Johnston's eyes darted away from where Avalerra was standing.\n\n\"Mary and Maria?\" Avalerra chuckled. \"Your mother sure was great at naming.\"\n\nJohnston closed her eyes and smiled. \"You know, Chudley would say that was a total white girl moment.\"\n\n\"Certified Gringo activity.\" Avalerra laughed. \"But seriously, I thought you didn't have any siblings.\"\n\n\"I don't. Not anymore.\" Johnston pursed her lip. \n\n\"Oh. Maybe I shouldn't have joked about that.\"\n\n\"No. No. It's fine. She would have thought it was funny. Mary passed away when she was just 17. Hodgkin's lymphoma. Just came out of nowhere and spread through her body like it was no one's business.\"\n\n\"Dios Mio. I'm sorry for your loss.\"\n\n\"The one thing I couldn't have protected her from, Foundation or not. Some hero I was.\" Johnston's voice catches in her throat.\n\n\"Don't beat yourself up. The best thing we can do is honor her memory.\" Avalerra pauses before speaking again, \"Wait. I just realized. The \"Bouncing Mary\"... it's not named after you is it?\"\n\nA smile crosses Johnston's face. \"In loving memory. I do my best to honor her through my designs.” Johnston clicked her tongue as she mulled over the memory of her sister. Would she really want her sulking around like this? “Come on though; I'm sure John and whoever else Richter sent along doesn't want to wait in the rain all day.\"\n\n\"You're going to work? You seemed like a wreck just a moment ago.\"\n\n\"I just needed to be reminded of what I'm fighting for. You'll need to give me some time to shower though. Catch you in fifteen.\"\n\n\n/2/\n\n//An hour later...//\n\nJohnston walked into Site-78's security checkpoint alongside Omega-45 members, John Cassington, Michaela Avalerra, and Cole Marcus. She split off from the MTF, who had to go through more rigorous security checks due to their weapons and Avalerra's status as an anomaly.\n\nJohnston passed through one of the X-ray machines and slid her ID badge into the scanner.\n\n**Identity Confirmed: Level 4 Researcher Maria Megan Johnston. Parabiological Sciences.**\n\nSecurity Officer Hanli Su, turned to Johnston. \"You're all set. I see you got Omega-45 with you. Is everything alright?\"\n\n\"Yes. We were just performing a house sweep. Nothing to worry about.\"\n\nOfficer Li nodded, \"Must have been quite the sweep, if you needed the Omegas. You can enter.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\" Johnston waited for the members of MTF Omega-45 to finish passing through security before telling them to go on about their business until called up.\n\nThe soldiers saluted and Johnston did the same. Now alone she headed into the nearby hallway towards the Department of MAUDE[[footnote]] Mundane Artifacts and Uneventful Data Evaluation [[/footnote]]. //Chudley... at a time like this I could use a laugh.// \n\nThe inside of Maude's offices had dozens of workers processing uneventful data and filtering through irrelevant paperwork to reach Chudley's office in the back. \n\nJohnston gave the door a few knocks. \"Chudley, it's Maria. Can I see you?\"\n\n\"Yarr.\" Chudley responded. Johnston sighed.Chudley had taken to saying “Yarr” and “Narr” instead of yes and no before she’d gone on her sabbatical. What a strange man.\n\nJohnston opened the door and took a seat in front of Chudley's desk. The man himself was reviewing a file, which was a rare find even on a good day. \n\n\"What's got your attention?\" She asked.\n\n\"Take a look,\" Chudley said handing her a file.\n\n\" SCP-77763 is approximately 45 milliliters of sentient cu-\"\n\n\"NO NOT THAT ONE, under that one.\"  Chudley threw his hand out before Johnston could finish reading.\n\n\"Oh- alright. 'SCP-71777 is a series of billboards with various mildly threatening religious phrases. The one common denominator is they all share a phone number ‘555-FIND-GOD'.\" Johnston placed the file down.  \"Hmm, interesting. Very //mundane//.\" She handed the file back to Chudley, who placed it on his stack. \n\n\"That's the name of the game down here. It's honest but boring work. It can be a bit refreshing after dealing with the big stuff.\" Chudley cocked an eyebrow at Johnston, \"Also are you alright? You look... tired.\"\n\n\"I didn't sleep well. I'm hoping nothing really big comes up today.\"\n\n\"You want coffee?\"\n\nJohnston scoffed, \"You know I don't drink that garbage. I need the good stuff.\"\n\nChudley smiled, \"Coming right up.\" Chudley reached over to his mini-fridge, procured an //Ultra White Monster//, and handed it to Johnston. She graciously accepted, cracking it open and taking a sip.\n\n\"That's the stuff.\" She put it back on the desk. \n\n\"Was there anything you wanted to talk about? Or did you just come to raid the mini fridge?\"\n\n\"There were a few things. How are you holding up after... meeting //her//?\"\n\nChudley's look went from one of aloofness to contemplation. \"Ah yes, our grand adversary. I've been keeping my eye out for any snakes. Don't want her sneaking up on us again.\" He flashed a cheeky smile.\n\n\"Real funny. It doesn't bother you that she's been watching us, or potentially manipulating us?\"\n\n\"Wouldn't be the first time,\" Chudley reflected. \"Who knows if she was telling the truth? Would knowing your story is being manipulated by an outside force really change how you operate?\"\n\n\"I would just- keep acting the same.\" Johnston realized. \"But we have to tread carefully. She could be anywhere.\"\n\n\"Look, as someone who used to work in Pataphysics, you get used to the idea that your actions might not be your own. I'm not about to live my life scared and neither should you. You have way too many cool guns to be scared of DeviantArt's most wanted.\"\n\nJohnston chuckled, \"I guess you're right on that one. Maybe I'm just being a bit too paranoid.\" She pauses for a second. \"There was something else I wanted to mention, a theory that I had. Ever since the Set came around, have you noticed anything different with the anomalous?\"\n\n\"You kidding? I wouldn't be able to run this department if there wasn't something going on. Everywhere you turn there's some new doodad or trinket popping up. I thought it was just because we were expanding our containment efforts but I remembered something fishy about PeppaPig'sStrongestSoldier.\"\n\n//Oh Gamers Against Weed, never change with the silly usernames.// Johnston shook her head. \"You noticed something fishy about a pig? Does he have gills?\"\n\n\"No, I was referring to his smell- OF COURSE, I WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS GILLS. Actually, it was about his abilities. His reality warping was originally confined to fictional works but, then one day he could manipulate works of non-fiction. He powered up.\"\n\n\"And that's why Finland is no longer real... or was never real?\" Johnston sighed. \"I'm still confused about that.\"\n\n\"You and me both.\"\n\n\"That does track with my theory. Anomalous abilities are growing stronger. Why? No freaking clue. It's good for us because it allows us to do more with our work but for the enemy...\"\n\n\"I getcha, but there's no way to know for sure exactly. Again, could be random chance.\"\n\n\"Or it's our snake friend up to her tricks. Regardless, this was a nice talk. I have to get down to Intelligence and see if there's anything that needs responding to.\"\n\n“Wait.” Chudley threw his hand out. “Before you go, I have to ask, who's Mary?”\n\nHer name hit Johnston once again like a freight train but she knew he would ask. She simply shook her head with a slight smile. “Narr.”\n\n“Why won’t you tell me who she is? We’ve been working together for this long, I would have assumed you trusted me more.”\n\n“I’ll tell you later, I promise. I need to get down to Intelligence and see if there’s anything new.”\n\n\"Alright.\" Chudley paused. \"Godspeed, Johnston.\"\n\n/3/\n\nSeveral years ago...\n\n\"J-Johnston? Maria. Are you alright?\" An older male voice said to her.\n\nMaria snapped out of her lucid haze having stared off into space. \"Oh, sorry.\"\n\n\"We were talking about how you've been dragging your feet in the lab, I just wanted to know if you were alright, and if there was anything I could do.\"\n\n//Are you alright?// The words echoed in Johnston's head. She'd heard them over and over again. At the funeral, at the hospital, and now here at her place of learning. Why doesn't anyone get it? Johnston's voice quivered as she let out a small chuckle. \"Am I alright? What kind of question is that? Would you be alright when the light in your life dies? My sister is dead, Professor. For sixteen days now, and it doesn't get any better.\"\n\nThe professor clicks his tongue. \"My apologies, Maria. I wasn't aware that-\"\n\nJohnston was still chuckling faintly, \"Is there anything you can do?\" She parroted. \"You can't bring it back, can you? None of us can. We think we're so advanced, but a few renegade lymphocytes still do us in, no matter how hard we try. I don't know why, people keep treating me like I'm fragile!\" Her voice started to raise. \"Like I could just break. But there is nothing left to break, she's gone!\" Johnston got out of her seat.\n\n\"She had so many wonderful ideas and I was going to try and make them a reality.\" Tears were rolling down Johnston's reddened cheeks. \"Now she'll never see them.\" \n\n\"Well... there was something that I wanted to propose to you, it's the main reason I brought you in here.\" He passed a set of papers in front of her, marked with a circular logo with three arrows pointing inwards.\n\n\"I'm working with a government project that I feel you'd be a good fit for. I think this might be the best way to keep your sister's dreams alive. This organization has technology you've never seen.\"\n\nJohnston started blankly at the pages as she flipped through them. Her eyes darted from word to word, seeing biological terms she thought were only fantasy; creatures beyond the human imagination. Perhaps he was right, maybe this is the place she could make real change. To be like the heroes that her sister used to draw-\n\n\"What do you say, Maria? Would you give it a shot?\"\n\n\"I....\" The words were heavy on her tongue.\n\n\"Maria?\"\n\n/-/\n\n\"Johnston. We have something.\" One of the intelligence technicians said, snapping Johnston from her train of thought. She took a sip of her Monster and approached. Whenever she heard those words, they usually meant trouble.\n\n\"What do you have for me?\" She said looking at paused video footage of a girl walking down a back alley.\n\n\"This just came in from Director Moose over at Site-19. She wants to know if Omega-45 can respond.\"\n\nA video was played of several armed men escorting young men and women inside of an establishment. The video feed then cut inside to a club-esque setting, where patrons were being served drinks with disheveled-looking people doing drugs nearby.\n\nMore images flashed by of the interior rooms with men and women suffering signs of drug abuse. Johnston's time in Mexico made her recognize the insignia she saw on some of the products being offered.\n\nSin Nombre.\n\n“Where was this footage taken?” Johnston's voice quivered with anger seeing those poor women in such a state. She knew the cartel trafficked and forced women into these types of jobs but to actually see it? There wouldn't be enough gauss rounds in the armory for the people responsible.\n\n“Footage was geolocated to Cheyenne. It's been operating for about a week now. The place is called 'La Curandera'.\"\n\n\"On our turf? Not on my watch. Tell Director Moose we'll handle-.\" Johnston trailed off as her head throbbed hard. Her vision went blurry and nearly stumbled over. A voice rang in her ear.\n\n“There you go, gallivanting off pretending to be a hero. Didn't you order the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7899 executions of civilians] just last month? You'll always be a scared little girl, Jailer.\"  Corra’s voice echoed in her brain, assaulting every synapse with her breathy voice.\n\n“Johnston, are you alright?” Johnston regained her composure and looked to see Rinah Blunt, Omega-45’s heavy weapons specialist, standing by her.\n\n“Yeah, I just… got lightheaded for a second. As I was going to say: we've got a mission to do. I want anything you can gather on La Curandera sent to me, Rinah you are with me.”\n\n“At once Boss.” The technician turned back to their workstation while Johnston started walking with Blunt in tow.\n\n“Johnston, the Electoballistics division wanted me to tell you that they finished their Arc Pistol Prototype.” Rinah said.\n\n“Excellent. I can head over there and check-in. Let John and the rest of the squad know to be ready to move once Intelligence figures out where that girl’s mom has been hiding.”\n\n“Can do.” Rinah started to walk off from Johnston but stopped as she said: “Oh. Have the armory make sure my Hephaestus grade body suit is ready. I will be joining you in the field this time around.”\n\nRinah raised an eyebrow, “As in from a command center or?”\n\n“I mean in the field, Blunt. I’ll be leading this operation personally.”\n\n“Pardon me Ma’am, but you don’t have any combat training. It’s not-”\n\n“Safe? I’ve tested every weapon I sent you in the field and cleared all the training courses. I’ve defended this Site against the Chaos Insurgency and directed the Street Samurai in the worst of situations.” Johnston's voice trembled.\n\n“I didn’t mean to offend, I just don’t understand why-”\n\n“That’s an order, Blunt.\"\n\n“I understand. I’ll tell the men to get ready.” \n\n/4/\n\nSamantha Russell unlocked the door to her house with this month’s bills in hand. The seventeen-year-old had been living by herself with only her dog to keep her company. She was feeling exhausted after her shift and her uniform was dirty from the day's work. The last thing she needed was to be reminded of crippling financial obligations.\n\n“Bubba! I’m home! You won’t believe the day I had.” Her Golden Retriever came scampering by as she slapped the mail on the kitchen table and kicked her shoes off.\n\nShe bent down to pet him, rubbing behind his ears. “Still no mom?”\n\nBubba yipped.\n\n“Yeah I figured, but I’m glad you are here to keep watch for her. She could be back any day now you know.” She got up and looked around. The house was still looking spotless for her mom's eventual return. It had been three years since she'd disappeared without a trace.\n\nShe had to be, right?  Dad wasn't in the picture and her extended family had declined to take her in. She'd figured her mom wouldn't have left without a good reason, even if her mom had a tendency to give into her vices at times.\n\nAs much as she missed her, there wasn't really much she could do but wait. Sam headed for her bedroom next, taking off her uniform and tossing it in the hamper. She then changed into her PJs and hopped into bed.\n\nShe rolled over and stared up at the ceiling, her mind drifting to the thought of the Wanderer's Library. It had started a few months back. She had pressed her hand against her bathroom mirror and suddenly she was there. A kind librarian had given her a card and told her the rules of the place. Sam was special in that she could create portals, so-called \"Ways\" to the Library. She was free to come and go as she pleased, as long as she stayed away from the restricted sections.\n\nSam wished she could spend all her time in the Library, away from the creepy customers and annoying Karens. It had become a place of solace that she could escape too when life got hard or her loneliness overtook her. However, despite supposedly holding infinite knowledge, the Librarians couldn't tell her what happened to her mother.\n\n She held her hand up to the air and began to distort the reality in front of her. //Maybe one day, I’ll open a Way to her. Wouldn’t that be nice?// She put her hand down and pulled the blanket over the top of her, drifting off into the realm of sleep.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, a visitor was at the door, waiting to be let in.\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false| hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-78| previous-title=Secure Facility Dossier: Site-78\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lost-souls-broken-toys-chapter-2|next-title=Lost Souls, Broken Toys Chapter 2\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-ninth-world-hub| hub-title=The Set of Nine\n]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** site-78.svg\n> **Author:** Equinox Doodles\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-78 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
