Experimentation with SCP-5318 is prohibited without express permission of --Lead Researcher Juan Martinez and-- Site Director Holman. Staff interested in experimenting with SCP-5318 must undergo ego-examinational evaluations as well as maintain a Level 4 Learinian [[footnote]]A scale, developed in a joint UIU-CIA project under the supervision of Researcher Timothy Leary, on the concept of “psychonautic retention”.[[/footnote]] knowledge of the psycho-space.

[[footnote]]Micrograms.[[/footnote]] Persons who have received a dosage of SCP-5318 higher than 200 µg are to be terminated immediately, if they have not already been rendered comatose or deceased.\n\n= [[size 120%]]**__DESCRIPTION__**[[/size]]\n\nSCP-5318 refers to a 315 g [[footnote]]Liquid.[[/footnote]] batch of lysergic acid diethylamide — specifically, ((+)-LSD));[[footnote]]The psychoactive form of the 4 different compound configurations.[[/footnote]] hereafter referred to as \"LSD\". Post-delivery, a subject under the influence of SCP-5318 will experience typical auditory and visual hallucinations commonly associated with LSD. [[footnote]]Most notably ego-death and a release from the fear of the finality of death.[[/footnote]] These effects will continue for a duration of 8 to 12 hours, depending on individual and method of delivery. Between completion of the third and fourth half-lives, [[footnote]]”Half-life” in user experience is defined as the time the body breaks down the compound — Typically, between 90-120 minutes per repeating cycle.[[/footnote]] a subject will enter a catatonic state in which they will remain unresponsive until after the completion of the fifth half-life.\n \nAll subjects, upon entering this state, report that they find themselves viewing and experiencing a dream-like memory in which they seem to live for a variable amount of time as an agave farmer in the south of Mexico. This person is henceforth referred to as SCP-5318-1.\n\nSCP-5318 differs from standard LSD compounds through the addition of an as-of-yet undetermined polypeptide coupling reagent. Current theories and examination of the byproduct of the reagenting processes suggests the use of a polymer, isomeric in chirality to the compound █-███[[footnote]][[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3000| Security Level 5/3000 REQUIRED]]][[/footnote]]. Additionally, the anomalous effect of this reagent prolongs the degradation of the compound by several factors.[[footnote]]In the decades since its discovery, the compound has not yet shown any observable degradation.[[/footnote]]\n\n= [[size 120%]]**__DISCOVERY__**[[/size]]\n\nSCP-5318 was first discovered in November, 1997, after twelve researchers were dosed by a fellow researcher at Site-64. No permanent mental or physical damage occurred, but resulted in all twelve staffers experiencing the anomalous effects now currently associated with SCP-5318. Due to the gross unprofessionalism, the researcher involved in the dosing has since been reprimanded, demoted, and detained as D-Class.[[footnote]]D-569003.[[/footnote]] After interviewing the staffers involved, it was deemed necessary to trace the production and origin of SCP-5318.\n\n= [[size 120%]] **__INTERVIEWS__**[[/size]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Incident Disciplinary Review]]\n**Asst.

How are you feeling?\n\n**D-623321:** Not great. I was groggy for a while and had trouble sleeping last night.\n\n**Eskew:** Why is that?\n\n**D-623321:** Why do you think? You white coats dosed me. My mind was on overdrive all night.\n\n**Eskew:** Sleeplessness is a side effect of LSD, unfortunately. Would you like to talk about your experience?\n\n**D-623321:** Which part? \n\n**Eskew:** Well, we know that at some point you would have felt like you were living as someone else, most likely around 6 hours into your “trip“. Could you elaborate on what you saw, what you heard?\n\n**D-623321:** Yeah, that was so strange. I woke up, in a field, there were these spiky green plants everywhere. My hands were covered in dirt. A little boy ran up to me as I was working. He called me “//Señor Luna//”. He started saying things to me, but I couldn’t understand. It sounded Spanish, but I never took more than like… one or two years of that in high school. But when the boy was talking, I could feel my heart start racing. I ran across the field, following him to a small house on the outskirts of the farm. I felt so scared for some reason.\n\n**Eskew:** Was something chasing you?\n\n**D-623321:** No, it wasn’t like… a fear of death, but the fear of losing something.\n\n**Eskew:** So you would say, although you could not understand the language, you could still feel emotional responses to the stimuli around you?\n\n**D-623321:** If you want to use big words like that, yeah… When I arrived at the house I went through the front door, and up to the bedroom, where there was a woman on the bed and another woman next to her holding her hand. She was in the middle of having a kid.\n\n**Eskew:** How did this make you feel?\n\n**D-623321:** I was scared, in love, confused, but felt strong too. The woman said something to me, but I can’t remember. I stayed there for a few hours and eventually she had a baby boy. But she didn’t wake up. I felt so sad, even angry, but as I felt a sharp pain in my chest, I held the baby.\n\n**Eskew:** And what happened?\n\n**D-623321:** All the fear and anger melted away and I felt a kind of love I have never experienced. I haven’t had any kids, but I know now the kind of love that comes from being a parent. An Angel let slip one name out of my mouth, “//Gabriel//“.\n\n**Eskew:** And then?\n\n**D-623321:** I came back. I woke up. What do I do with this, doctor?\n\n**Dr. Juan Martinez:** Thank you for your time, D-Class.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-5318-B]]\n**Subject:** D-687120\n**Profile:** Male; Age: 43; Origin: Nevada, US\n\n**Dr. Morgan Eskew:** Good day D-Class, how are you feeling?\n\n**D-687120:** Jesus! What more you //locos// want?!\n\n**Eskew:** Just trying to figure out how you are feeling, D-Class.\n\n**D-687120:** I’m as good as anyone who just got through a //pinche// acid trip!\n\n**Eskew:** I can understand your frustration, though could you please share with us your experience, especially from around the 5–6 hour mark? Did you have an out of body experience?\n\n**D-687120:** I felt like I was gone for years!\n\n**Eskew:** What did you experience in your time out of body?\n\n**D-687120:** I was some //ranchero// in what looked like Oaxaca. I remember visiting some place like that when I was little. I had a little //mijo//. A son. I got to watch him grow up. I tried my best. As he got older, I felt that he started to resent me for not saving his mother, like I could have done anything about it. It was hard, but I wanted him to take over the agave farm when I was gone. It had been in my family for generations. But he wanted to do other things.\n\n**Eskew:** You are speaking in first person like this experience was //yours//. Can you elaborate on why?\n\n**D-687120:** Doctor, like I said, I felt like I lived whole years in this… what do I even call it… a dream? I can hardly tell what’s real anymore.

Could you tell me about it?\n\n**D-569003:** Ugh, I guess…. It just makes me feel so betrayed.\n\n**Eskew:** What does?\n\n**D-569003:** That little shit. //Merida! Mijo//! I gave him everything.\n\n**Eskew:** Who?\n\n**D-569003:** My… his… whoever that kid was… my son?

It was time for him to step up, he was 16 now, and had to be a man. He refused, said he hated me for it. Said he never wanted any of this life. Said he wish he had died in birth and not Olivia, his mother. Said he blamed me for everything. That there was no life here, only death. That he wanted to discover the world, see it. I said I agree with him, that Olivia should have been here, not him. We both said horrible things.

Is this real? //Dios Mio//!\n\n//D-569003 flies into a fit of hysteria and is sedated.//\n\n**Jennifer Lam:** Martinez, I’ll give you one more, after this we are done.

That you just experienced time in the life of his father, Señor Luna?\n\n**D-089644** I gathered that much, but I was there for so long…\n\n**Eskew:** How long was that?\n\n**D-089644** I don’t know. Maybe a few decades.\n\n**Eskew:** What happened?\n\n//A tear drops from D-089644’s eye.//\n\n**D-089644** Time… Time happened. I spent years, waking up, tending the fields, and looking to the sky for answers. Praying to God to bring my boy back to me. But time brought me nothing but hardship.\n\n**Eskew:** You said years, maybe decades. Can you highlight what transpired or how you felt?\n\n**D-089644** It’s so much, like trying to remember the memory of a dream I had a year ago. Really, what stays is the feeling and big events, not much else… Just a constant sadness…\n\n**Eskew:** Would you care to elaborate? You are our last interview, so there is no pressure. We have enough info for our purposes.\n\n**D-089644** I would, actually. Besides being locked in here for however long, I only have this. I just... I just have to get it out.

I woke up in a bed too big for myself. Within its sheets, I could feel the absence of something meaningful, something important. Early on, as I would go through my day, the house I was in seemed to have a population in the negative, as if so much was missing. I felt constant drain and agony. It went like this for so long. I tried my best to honor my father, his before, and his before, to keep the land as us Three Lunas had. But... \n\n//D-089644 pauses and looks despondent.//\n\n**Eskew:** But what, D-Class?\n\n**D-089644** With no son to carry the farm into the next era, production slowed, a rot took the soil, and the only path was to start selling plots back to the bank. Slowly, the farm and field were bought up by a large company. As the land belonging to my fathers suffered, so did my heath. The encroaching cities, industry and soot, took its toll. My sight started to fade. Shape, forms, color and light soon faded into distant memory, until all that was left was darkness and the sounds of a hospital. The farm, my son, my health gone…. I think I died shortly after. I had nothing left. If the universe ever offered anything besides cold indifference, I felt that the only thing I could ever ask of God was to hold my boy again. I just… Gabriel… //lo siento! Lo siento Gabriel! Mi Gabrielito! Lo Siento//.\n\n//D-089644 cries for 46 seconds before becoming completely silent.//\n\n**Dr. Juan Martinez:** D-Class, thank you for your time.\n\n\n**__Post Interview Note:__** \nD-089644 presented symptoms of extreme depression post-SCP-5318 until amnesticization. \n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-5318-E]]\n**Subject:** Juan Martinez\n**Profile:** Male; Age: 52; Origin: California, US\n\n**Dr. Morgan Eskew:** Dr. Martinez.

Perdón por no estar allí cuando sé que me necesitabas. Necesitaba ver el mundo, pero ahora sé que el mundo no importa, solo nosotros. No temas la absolución que viene. Este no es el fin.

He was known to be on a Foundation-approved constitutional; however, he has since not returned to his position. The following is a transcript of different CCTV and independent footage from the area:**\n\n**__Hotel CCTV Surveillance:__**\n\n**21:26:** Dr. Juan Martinez sits at the hotel bar with a female in her late thirties. [[footnote]]Notably not his wife.[[/footnote]] They appear to be close.\n\n**21:27:** The bartender places drinks in front of Martinez and his companion. Martinez’s drink contains a piece of paper underneath its base.\n\n**21:27:** Dr. Martinez picks up the paper and reads.\n\n**21:28:** Dr. Martinez stands up, shakes his guest’s hand, and gives her an undetermined amount of currency.

Martinez begins crying.\n\n**21:43:** The man and Martinez embrace. Martinez holds the man’s face in both hands.\n\n**21:43:** Martinez says something indiscernible.\n\n**21:44:** The man nods.\n\n**21:44:** Martinez and the man embrace.\n\n**21:45:** The embrace ends, the man whispers into Martinez’s ear and he hands Martinez an envelope.\n\n**21:45:** Martinez looks shocked, but then smiles at the man. The two then part ways.\n\n\n**__Hotel CCTV Surveillance:__**\n\n**22:01:** Martinez walks back in through the hotel bar. The aforementioned female is with another man.\n\n**22:01:** Martinez approaches the front desk and hands the now opened envelope to the hotel staff.\n\n**22:02:** The front desk agent nods and puts the parcel into a trash bin.\n\n**22:03:** Dr. Juan Martinez checks out.\n\n**22:05:** Juan Martinez leaves the hotel, and is able to be tracked via various city cameras until disappearing at 22:38.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n= **__ADDENDUM (August 12th, 1999)__**\n[[collapsible show=\"Open\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAfter Dr. Martinez failed to show back at Site-64 following his vacation, his pervious whereabouts were tracked.
