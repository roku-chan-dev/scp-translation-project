This blade, comprised of blood, follows the pattern of the original knife, forming an edge reminiscent of a falchion.\n\nDespite being composed entirely of liquid blood, SCP-7276's blade is completely solid in addition to possessing a razor-like sharpness.\n\nDNA analysis has determined that SCP-7276's blade is comprised of blood sourced from both a wide variety of animals and an estimated six hundred human subjects.\n----\n= **Discovery:**\n----\nSCP-7276 was discovered following the murder of Jane Woodrow, a forty-seven-year-old person of interest at the time. She was found completely exsanguinated in an alleyway, with cuts and lacerations stretching across the corpse. SCP-7276 was found nearby.\n\nLocal law enforcement was unable to make an arrest for Woodrow's murder, and the list of suspects is still being investigated at the time of writing.\n\nDespite SCP-7276's composition, retroactive historical analysis in the past two hundred years has revealed no other known incidents involving it or relating to it.\n\n----\n= **Testing:**[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]##black|Heavily truncated list devised by the newly appointed lead researcher.##[[/span]]\n----\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n||~ [[size 110%]]Subject:[[/size]] ||~ [[size 110%]]Procedure:[[/size]] ||~ [[size 110%]]Result:[[/size]] ||\n|| D-6412 || Pierce the subject's left foreleg and attempt to gauge an additional supposed anomalous property from SCP-7276.|| N/A [Denied by Site Director] ||\n|| D-6412 || Cut the subject's left foreleg and attempt to gauge an additional supposed anomalous property from SCP-7276. || N/A [Denied by Site Director] ||\n|| D-6412 || Pierce the subject's chest and heart and attempt to gauge an additional supposed anomalous property from SCP-7276. || N/A [Denied by Site Director] ||\n|| One domesticated pig. || Pierce the subject's heart and attempt to gauge an additional supposed anomalous property from SCP-7276. || The subject reacted violently to the procedure, vocalizing wildly as sedatives were not employed.

Senior Researcher. Dunno what makes him more qualified to take over this assignment than me, but they say he's experienced.\n\nHe's currently out of action at the minute, but, uh, what's really funny, yeah, is that he made a list of test proposals for the knife.

Her connection to GOI-850 had caused her to evade the Foundation for a period of six years before her body was discovered.\n\nSCP-7276 was not a known possession of GOI-850, nor is it believed that the group was capable of its conception. Investigations are ongoing.\n\nThere were symbols found on Woodrow's body, carved with lacerations and cuts, that corresponded to another set that manifested on the tested pig. Due to the decayed state of Woodrow's corpse, these symbols were not originally noted as anything more than brutality.\n\nAfter noticing this, Junior Researcher Herida, under orders from the newly instated lead researcher, began a search of the Foundation database for other symbols like this, discovering a possible link to another anomaly - SCP-6234-D.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[span]]Internal log - Herida and Lead Researcher dialogue[[/span]]\n\n//[Herida is seated in a lobby outside the medical wing reading a magazine]//\n\n//[After a few minutes, footsteps can be heard down the hall and Herida puts the magazine away as he stands]//\n\n//[Senior Researcher König enters the shot wearing sunglasses and a took]//\n\n//[Herida moves to greet him]//\n\n**Herida:** Senior Researcher König, sir.\n\n**König:** What is it that you want?\n\n**Herida:** Uh, oh- sir, I'm here about 7276, the blood knife.

I'd like to get to know you.\n\n//[König is silent for a moment]//\n\n**Herida:** Sir?\n\n**König:** We, no, I, I was so very, very close to achieving something in this organization. So very, very close to creating something. But it was all ruined; all destroyed; all shattered into dust.\n\n**Herida:** What happened?\n\n**König:** An anomaly, happened, junior researcher. An anomaly was allowed to fester its unnatural disease amongst our ranks. An anomaly was allowed to spread its influence and seep itself deep into a pocket of this Foundation.\n\nI gave it a chance; I will not make this mistake again. Even for the purposes of experimentation, we must not allow anomalies any advantages. We can not allow them to reign in their terrible night.\n\n**Herida:** Terrible night?\n\n**König:** If we allow them to infiltrate our ranks, the foundation of our Foundation will grow with their vile seed. They will take over our final bastion, and every cataclysm will follow. We can not compromise on our beliefs, junior researcher. Remember that, above all else, you must be uncompromising in holding true the values of the SCP - secure, contain, and protect. Secure anomalies, contain anomalies, and protect humanity.\n\n**Herida:** I believe I understand, sir.\n\n**König:** This is good.

Now, we are here on the topic of SCP-6234-D; you used to work on this project, correct?\n\n**Brown:** I did.

To investigate how those symbols were carved into the pig without prompt?\n\n**Brown:** Excuse me?\n\n**Herida:** Sorry, the anomaly we're testing appeared to leave a cut mark on a woman and a pig we tested on, an- wait, how do you know it was definitely suicide?\n\n**König:** Because it's obvious, Researcher Herida. She was asking, no, pleading for us to find her. Us, the Foundation. Otherwise, Researcher Herida, who in their right mind would leave such an interesting and unique weapon behind?\n\n**Brown:** I'm a bit confused here, wha-\n\n**Herida:** But all the suspects-\n\n**König:** No ties to the anomalous, any of them.\n\n**Herida:** Then what was she trying to draw attention to?\n\n**König:** Herself and her cult. You could use a regular knife to do the deed; you could use a rope, a gun, or a simple jump would suffice. Why else would anyone use an anomaly to do it other than to draw us in?\n\n**Herida:** Then aren't we playing by her game? By doing what she wants us to do?\n\n**König:** And that is what we must find out. Perhaps these documents will help us in finding the answer to this mess.

In the end, twenty-five test proposals were accepted.\n\nThe tests employed a variety of anomalous sciences and standard or thaumaturgic practices, which concluded with the finding that SCP-7276's secondary blade is not limited solely to SCP-7276, and can be extracted and harnessed //[See Addendum: 7276.3 for more information]//.\n\nAdditionally, among other less noteworthy discoveries, the blood of Jane Woodrow was found, singled out, and extracted from SCP-7276's secondary blade. Multiple requests for the usage of this blood, notably among a thaumaturgic blood ritual, are pending.\n----\n= **Addenda: 7276.1.2:**\n----\nFollowing six weeks of testing and analysis on SCP-7276, Senior Researcher König came to a conclusion on the possibility of replicating SCP-7276.\n\nThe proposed procedure would involve utilizing the blood of forty pig specimens, which would be channeled into a spear-shaped mold and enriched with various elements of thaumaturgic significance, as well as undergoing several other procedures listed [# here].\n\nAlthough all requisite materials were collected, Site Director Velkes intervened and prevented the experiment from being performed on the basis of a lack of prior Site Director authorization regarding testing upon living subjects as well as the large inventory withdrawal required for the test.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ##red|RsrKönig@Scip.NET##\n**From:** ##red|SDVelkes@Scip.NET##\n**Subject:** My tests.\n**Date** 3/1/1993\n[[/div]]\n------\nMr. Velkes, I would like to know as to why my progress has been continuously hindered by your short-sightedness.

This was excused due to his stable condition as well as his current nature.\n\nFor a period of one month after this, König continued analyzing SCP-7276 with the assistance of Junior Researcher Herida. All inventory requests for test-related purposes made during this time were denied.\n\nIt was noticed afterward that multiple materials and utilities granted to other research personnel had been borrowed by König, as well as Herida.\n\nA list of known items utilized by these two includes:\n\n* 50 grams of sulphur.\n* 25 grams of magnesium.\n* 5 grams of potassium chloride.\n* Enchanted charcoal sigils[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]##black|Enchanted - referring to a subject enhanced by thaumaturgic methods.##[/span]]\n* 100kg of flesh (sourced from domestic pigs)\n* Human skeletal anatomy (sourced from Class-D personnel)\n* 1 EVE counter.\n* 2 Wrought iron poles.\n\nAttached below are several files that directly led to Incident-7276-1, collected from security monitoring as well as materials collected afterward.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[span]]Internal log - König, Herida, Madisson dialogue[[/span]]\n\n//[Footage begins in a hallway, viewing Senior Researcher Madisson walking toward the break room]//\n\n//[König walks out from the break room and turns towards Madisson, Herida following behind him]//\n\n//[Madisson notices the two and tries to swerve out of their way]//\n\n//[As both groups pass, König turns suddenly to face Madisson]//\n\n**König:** Researcher Madisson, are you well?\n\n**Madisson:** S-senior Researcher König!

Further details are obscured by König's body]//\n\n**König:** This is Senior Researcher Friedenfänger, recording the testing of SCP-7276. Previously, I had discovered a thaumaturgic spell that could be used to temporarily resurrect, using the blood we had sourced from her own weapon, Jane Woodrow, a woman who knows about SCP-7276 well, as well as GOI-850 which she originates from.\n\nWith me is Junior Researcher Herida, who is preparing the ritual by which we can bring Ms. Woodrow here.\n\n//[He steps out of the way, revealing Herida struggling to put the pieces together]//\n\n//[The idol he is working on stands in the center of the circle, with both rods impaling through a large chunk of meat in a barely humanoid shape.

This wasn't the least messiest option, but, it's the best we could do.\n\n**König:** Help me with the skeleton; the neck vertebrae keep falling back out. Get a rope.\n\n**Herida:** Right away, sir.\n\n//[He runs out before returning with a rope, handing it to König]//\n\n**König:** Thank you.\n\n**Herida:** You're welcome.\n\n//[König stops]//\n\n**König:** I, I would like to thank you for everything, Herida. I appreciate your being here.\n\n**Herida:** Thank you, sir.\n\n**König:** Even as all these idiots and fools try to stop me, you are the only one who will stay by my side. I appreciate your loyalty, something this Foundation sorely lacks.\n\n**Herida:** Thank you, sir.\n\n**König:** The Foundation is like a flame in the eye of the storm. We must take well to cherish and protect it. But while a flame will act erratically, and will sometimes seep into the death around it, there must be people like us that will die to keep it in check. We need more researchers like you, willing to stand and push back against the ongoing crisis.\n\n**Herida:** T-thank you, sir.\n\n//[The two set to work rearranging and mangling the components for 2 hours]//\n----\n**König:** It is ready.\n\n//[He takes the camera over to view the idol, then readjusts it to keep himself in the frame]//\n\n**König:** Beginning the test now.\n\n//[He produces a vial of blood and pours it over the idol.
