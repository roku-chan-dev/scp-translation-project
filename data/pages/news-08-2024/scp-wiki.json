Congratulations to all the authors' hard work that helped us achieve this meaningful milestone!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By DianaBerry//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n\n[[=image http://o5command-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/tech-team:graphic-templates/scp-logo-int-full-400.png]]\n\nA new International Wiki has been recognized! Well, sort of. The Hungarian branch, or HU for short, has been recognized as an upcoming project with trustworthy staff and a growing userbase. You can visit it [http://scp-hu.wikidot.com/ here]! We wish the up and coming Hungarian Wiki the best of luck and steady growth.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=image https://khoaigarret.wikidot.com/local--files/ht:scpfvn-staff-image-hub/Banner_FeralFes.png width=150px]]\n\nThe Vietnamese Branch is hosting FeralFest, a contest based around writing about animals and other wildlife! Posting deadline is August 4th and voting goes on until August 11th. Check out the details [http://scp-vn.wikidot.com/feralfes2024 here]!

In Chinese folklore, the word \"elements\" refers to the magical elements such as fire, water, metal, wood, air, etc. It was originally going to be an Elemental Periodic Table, but the contest runners decided against that in the end. Either way, the writing period was between July 15th and ended on August 21st, but voting ends on the 31st of August! We look forward to seeing translations, be it on EN or on INT!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n-----\n[[=image https://cuarteldelo5.wdfiles.com/local--files/secret%3Ac3g/banner1.png]]\n\nAnd last, but finally not least, the ES Wiki is hosting a GoI contest, seeking to develop the smaller GoIs of the wiki and reimagining the older ones. The posting period begins on the 13th of August and ends on the 18th, and voting ends on the 31st of August. And as always, we look forward to seeing translations on EN and INT!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts!
