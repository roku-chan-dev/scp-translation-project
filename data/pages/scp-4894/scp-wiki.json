All SCP-4894 instances under Foundation control are contained within them at their deepest accessible depth. Access to the site interiors is restricted under guise 44G6 \"Industrial Waste Hazard\". Due to the nature of their past use, SCP-4894 instances are otherwise considered self-containing and self-protecting from unauthorized access.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4894 is a series of pickaxes of indeterminate number used exclusively by the Midas Mining Corporation between 1891 and 1917. A subject in possession of SCP-4894 is physically incapable of experiencing pain or exhaustion while holding it, although adverse health effects from overwork still occur. Each instance is inscribed with the words \"TOOL FOR EVERY USE\" on the sides of the axe head. Prolonged use of SCP-4894 imprints this same message into the skin on the back of its user's dominant hand by the gradual manifestation of scar tissue.\n\nDue to its recent discovery, the side-effects of long-term SCP-4894 use are based on the verbal reports of SCP-4894-A at this time. Effects vary and require multiple years of cumulative exposure to manifest but unilaterally increase the subject's potential productivity. Testing using SCP-4894-1 through 15 is underway to verify these claims.\n\nSCP-4894-A is a 172 year-old Canadian man by the name of Percy Aloysius McDonald and is the only known former employee of the Midas Mining Corporation still alive. Due to approximately 25 years of SCP-4894 use, SCP-4894-A does not require sleep, does not age, and possess near-perfect memory of his entire adult life. SCP-4894-A possess scar tissue typical of prolonged SCP-4894 use and a non-anomalous scar on its left thigh consistent with a bullet wound.\n-----\n**Addendum 4894.1: Discovery Interview Log**\n//Note: SCP-4894 was discovered in a sealed mine shaft exposed by a Canadian strip mining operation 83km northeast of the township of Whitehorse in the Yukon. Foundation agents conducted a search of the surrounding area after the cataloging of SCP-4894-1 through 300 held at the shaft's bottom. SCP-4894-A was found by thermal imaging 63km away in an isolated, one-room log cabin. The individual was brought to Arctic Site-87 for questioning after responding agents recognized SCP-4894's engraving on the back of SCP-4894-A's left hand.//\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:95%; padding:15px\"]]\n\n**Date:** 2020/01/22\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-4894-A\n\n**Interviewer:** Isapoinhkyaki Inukhuk, Foundation Arctic Survey Director\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=4894-A.png|align=right|width=200px|caption=Photo of SCP-4894-A taken prior to MMC's dissolution in 1917.]]\n**Video Start**\n\n**Isa:** Hello Dash-A, is there anything you need?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Well, it seems you've forgotten to feed me, again.\n\n**Isa:** I'm aware.\n\n//15 seconds of silence ensues.//\n\n**Isa:** You weren't exactly honest in your initial interviews.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I don't enjoy talkin' to folk when they're holdin' another man's gun.\n\n**Isa:** Our cafeteria's braised morels and moose is rather good, if you'd rather talk to someone holding another person's plate.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I might.\n\n//Director Isa sends a request for dinner on her interview terminal.//\n\n**Isa:** Can you tell me when you first learned of or encountered SCP-4894?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I worked for the company that bought them.\n\n**Isa:** That would make you over 130 years old.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** It would.\n\n**Isa:** Do you know who gave them to Midas?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I was there when the deal was made. The whole crew had to be there.\n\n**Isa:** All of MMC?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Just the best teams of our company, by the seller's request. MMC said it was an employment exchange. People for some pickaxes.\n\n**Isa:** And your company leadership thought this was a profitable exchange?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** When the owner himself rides over 4000 kilometers from Toronto to make the purchase in person, they think it's worth it.\n\n**Isa:** Alphonse Pétry?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Yes ma'am.\n\n//Director Isa's console flashes and she presses a key on it in response without breaking eye-contact with SCP-4894-A.

Guess bossman wanted to bring change, marched up enough men to dig our own graves in one day. Did it in the dead of winter too, makin' that mighty considerate of management. But creep with the axes looked me long in the eye along with Big Joe's group and a few them teams from Alaska and passed us up. Said Alphonse needed some workers fit to use 'em.\n\n**Isa:** Can you describe the seller's appearance?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Can you push that meal through?\n\n//Director Isa complies and presses a button on her terminal's touchscreen.

Dash-A is talkin' like that creep was lookin'.\n\n**Isa:** Ok, Percy. You have rather good memory for events so long ago.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** The only lie that creep didn't say is what's writtin' on them pickaxes. They can make you somethin' useful.\n\n**Isa:** For mining?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** A pickaxe is for more than mining. It can till for planting 'taters, stir up compost, dig a latrine, and a grave for matter. Why, I once killed a pig running wild out in them forests with one of them. Took just one swing and I ain't one to brag on my own account. Made us mighty useful.\n\n**Isa:** Thank you, Percy. We appreciate your cooperation. With more of it, we can afford you certain luxuries. Maybe even containment at your cabin. Just you, our regional monitoring station 50km away, and a sub-dermal tracker.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** How generous of you to leave a man the hell alone.\n\n**Isa:** If it will make you believe me, it is every bit as much a financial decision for us. Keeping you here is practically bleeding money. There's all the guards, monthly full-body scans, the cavity searches, and... well, I'm sure I don't have to tell you about everything we're already doing to you. Just suffice it to say our money is where our mouth is when I offer you this.

Buried them feelings with the rest of my folk down here. Just thought I would let him know that we did good by him. Took a bullet to make sure we did. And you might want to look 'bout halfway up that shaft on yonder if you're looking fer some bodies.\n\n//L16-Cap stops and pulls SCP-4894-A up to face her by the collar of its shirt.//\n\n**L16-Cap:** Alright, enough stumbling into intel. I respect you and I understand we look a lot like those Factory and Pinkerton thugs to you, but we need this information to gain something against the Factory. You should at least respect that enough to cut out the lies.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Well I ain't one for lyin' ma'am. Just like I told your director lady, them pickaxes are mighty good at killin' pigs.\n\n**End Video**\n[[/div]]\n-----\n**Addendum 4894.5: Factory Document 2 of 2**\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width:100%; font-family:Monospace;font-size:  10pt;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%; background-color: silver;\" rowspan=\"33\"]]\n[[/hcell]]\n\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nGOLD HILL PACIFICATION CAMPAIGN ORDER SUMMARY:\n[[/hcell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;\" rowspan=\"12\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size xx-large]]{{FACTORY}}[[/size]]\n{{(EST. 1835)}}\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 2%\"]]\n[[=]]\nEXTERMINATION OF LABOR UPRISING AND UNION OPERATIVE,\nRECOVERY OF MANUFACTURING ASSETS FOR PRODUCT T-00119\n\"TOOL FOR EVERY USE\" IN COOPERATION WITH CLIENT:\n**MIDAS MINING CORPORATION**\n\n##red|ORDER COPY REPRINTED FOR LEGACY PRODUCT RECOVERY PERSONNEL##\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n##red|REPRINT DATE:##\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n[[=]]\n##red|October 3rd, 2020##\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nORDER ID:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n[[=]]\nMIDAS-00002\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nIMPORTANCE:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\" ]]\n[[=]]\nHigh\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nLOCATION:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n[[=]]\nJoint-Venture Northwestern Yukon Ore Acquisition Site At Gold Hill.

We'll haul him around anywhere he needs them.\n\n//L16-Dem secures SCP-4894-A's hands behind its back. L16-Com sets up a AWANS spike while L16-Sct explores further down the passage way.//\n\n**L16-Sct:** More skeletons down here, old ones.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Any of them have pickaxes?\n\n**L16-Sct:** Not a one. Once more, I don't think these remains are from the miners. Factory uniforms on the bones. Whole 'lotta miner's clothes and hats just laying about, though.\n\n**L16-Com:** Alright, ready here.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Let's go.\n\n//L16 moves another 700 meters through narrow crevices, requiring regular widening by L16-Dem's drill. One hour and 37 minutes of irrelevant chatter omitted.//\n\n**L16-Sct:** //(interrupting on radio)// Cap, I found a pickaxe.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Copy that, Werner. Is it a 4894?\n\n**L16-Sct:** It has the inscription. Not the only one now that I'm looking. HUD's counting around... well damn. 320? Still no miner remains. The walls look older here from the oxidation. Deep rust color. Think we are the first ones down here in a long while.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Hold on, Werner. //(L16-Cap turns to SCP-4894-A)// Anything we should know going forward? We shouldn't still be seeing the aurora down here, and we did some test on the iron ore here. It's not very magnetic.\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** You're askin' me things beyond my depth and pay, ma'am. All I know is that the metal in them axes is every bit from our blood and sweat as it is from the earth's. Somethin' painful and joyful dumped into each other. Maybe the mine is just gettin' all nostalgic fer me.\n\n**L16-Sct:** Cap! I found a door! Spans the whole passage, looks like steel. Got a big 'ole Factory logo on it. No handles that I can see. Should I give it a push?\n\n**L16-Cap:** Go ahead but don't enter if it opens.\n\n**L16-Sct:** //(seven seconds of grunting)// Nope, gonna need Menendez.\n\n**L16-Cap:** ETA 15 minutes, Werener. Sit tight and enjoy the light show.\n\n**L16-Sct:** No problem, but the aurora is... well, you ever see how smoke gets sucked through the crack under a door, captain? Or how that bit of water circling the drain closest goes fastest?\n\n//Remainder of L16 catches up to L16-Sct at the door obstructing further progression.//\n\n**L16-Com:** Well, that is indeed a door.\n\n**L16-Dem:** Taking a look.\n\n//L16-Dem deploys her drill on its finest setting and proceeds to drill through. Sparks from the drill illuminate walls lined with SCP-4894 instances.//\n\n**L16-Dem:** Steel alloying is inlaid with 1.2% desecrated silver standard for early 1900s Factory Thaumasmelting. Door depth looks to be 20 cm. Easy peasy.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Rishi, take Dash-A and get some cover set up about 30 meters back. Menedez, get the charge ready. Werner, help me collect some specimens.\n\n//L16 proceed on task for 10 minutes 14 seconds before L16-Cap leaps backwards while cataloguing a pickaxe followed by a fluttering sound.//\n\n**L16-Cap:** What the?\n\n//L16-Cap focuses her helmet camera on a 10 cm long bronze mechanism in the shape of a canary continuously flapping its wings while lodged in the rock wall.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Well I'll be damned. Done thought whatever cruel windin' they put in that thing would be done spun out by now.\n\n**L16-Sct:** I got it.\n\n//L16-Sct grabs hold of the machine and places it in an hermetically sealed container.//\n\n**L16-Cap:** Would you mind elaborating on the clockwork fucking finch?\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Canary ma'am. Tragic things, I don't know what critter's heart they put in there but there sure are plenty of 'em. Factory sent 'em flying down the tunnels. Blind things but good of hearin'. They released a gas that could kill you breathin' in it as fast as smokin' in it. Don't matter if it hit a tunnel with folk in it or not, gas built up and flowed into nearby tunnels. A few of the Alaska crew fellas could make it through, them McKenly brothers could chew rust into air. Only reason I made it out was because the three spent a week spittin' fresh air out into some nooks they made.\n\n**L16-Dem:** Captain, ready here.\n\n**L16-Cap:** Right, let's get back to cover.\n\n//SCP-4894-A makes a deep, rolling chirp noise followed by the sound echoed from an indeterminate number of mechanical canaries. The sound of wings fluttering enters the feed and the video fills with bronze canaries.//\n\n**L16-Sct:** Scanner's picking up sulfides!\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** Funny thing about them Factory folk. Always treated us and the earth here like we were a pair of tools. If we acted up then that was just a matter of not usin' us right. Not applyin' enough dynamite on the right vein. Not bendin' the worker's fingers back far enough when they protest. They were so busy learnin' us that it never crossed 'em to think we might be learnin' them down here.\n\n//Camera turns towards SCP-4894-A holding a pickaxe behind its back with its bound hands. SCP-4894-A rears its body back and strikes it against the wall, creating a shower of sparks and igniting the released gasses. Feed is flung back and lands pointed towards the now blown-open door.//\n\n//Inside is a rust covered stalactite dripping a dark red liquid down into the mold for a pickaxe. One pickaxe made out of one solid piece of dark-colored iron sits in the mold. Video shakes as SCP-4894-A's feet come into view followed by the back of its left hand bearing SCP-4894's mark. SCP-4894-A pulls the blade of a pickaxe up to his bindings and cuts them. Feed turns to see L16-Com L16-Dem and L16-Sct unconscious on the mine shaft floor.//\n\n//SCP-4894-A frees its hands off camera and turns towards L16-Cap.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I take y'all for good folk, but I got some work to do and I reckon you won't be lettin' me about my way to do it.\n\n//SCP-4894-A swings the pickaxe its holding down in front of the camera and severs its tether connections before turning towards the room beyond the door.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** I really must thank you all. If it weren't fer all you folk pokin' around, I wouldn't have pegged them fellers back there for Factory. To think I was sittin' about waitin' to meet Joe and them without the job done right?\n\n//SCP-4894-A enters the chamber and stares up at the stalactite above the mold.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** And 'ere I thought Joe was just being poetic. Miner blood, earthen rust, all in one mold. Fer one intent and in one union. Bled out holdin' our lover, did ya Joe? It's ok, I know y'all been lonely, I'm here for you now.\n\n//SCP-4894-A retrieves the pickaxe and swings it at the stalactite overhead where it shatters in one strike. SCP-4894-A spends 5.6 seconds staring up at where the stalactite was before turning back towards L16-Cap. SCP-4894-A walks towards and past L16-Cap while she struggles to come to a stand. Camera feed records one frame of the side of a pickaxe handle striking L16-Cap from above before cutting out to audio where a soft thud is heard.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** A mighty tool we humans are, but I'm figurin' there's some folk still under the Factory needin' to know that. Every laborer deserves to know their union.\n\n//Video feed reopens in front of the Gold Hill mine entrance Three hours and 47 minutes later. The members of L16 lay on the ground approximately 30 meters away from the opening. SCP-4894-A emerges from the entrance and approaches L16-Cap.//\n\n**SCP-4894-A:** You look like someone I should hate. You talk like someone I should hate. You hold a gun like someone I should hate. But I don't. When I look at y'all I can't help but think of Joe. Blood on his hands from doin' his best at right in a downright wrong world. Maybe I'm just too tired for any more hate besides the malice the Factory put in me. Maybe that makes me a tool more than the Factory's brand on me. All I know about the world and myself right now is that the Factory still stands and I'm feelin' mighty useful.\n\n//A flash comes from the mine entrance followed by a low rumble and the opening collapsing on itself. A wave of dust passes over the feed and SCP-4894-A is gone when it clears.//\n\n**Video End**\n\n//Note: PoI-44198 \"Percy McDonald\" is to be apprehend and brought back into Foundation custody as soon as possible.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4893]]] | SCP-4894 | [[[SCP-4895]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
