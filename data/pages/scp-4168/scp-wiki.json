SCP-4168 is to remain in the care of SCP-4168-1, except for testing purposes.\n\nSCP-4168-1 is not to be more than two meters away from SCP-4168-2 at all times excluding testing periods. SCP-4168-1 and SCP-4168-2 are to be sedated when the other is being interviewed for the duration of the interview period, but are to stay next to one another.\n\nSocial media posts made by SCP-4168-1 have been hidden from public view and stored in Foundation Web Archives. \n\n**Update as of 03/30/2019:** Due to SCP-4168-2's uncooperative nature pertaining to containment protocols, SCP-4168-1 and SCP-4168-2 are to be handcuffed together except for testing periods.  \n\n**Update as of 04/03/2019:** Due to SCP-4168-2's continued violent tendencies towards SCP-4168-1, it is to remain in a medically induced coma for the foreseeable future.

SCP-4168's anomalous properties currently only manifest when worn by SCP-4168-1. SCP-4168-1 is a 23-year-old woman named Marie Ang. SCP-4168-2 is a 24-year-old man named Simon Langson. \n\nSCP-4168-1 experiences decomposition of the body, starting with the heart if either SCP-4168-2 is not within two meters or if SCP-4168 is not worn. If SCP-4168-1 is wearing SCP-4168 but is not within two meters of SCP-4168-2, it will still experience decomposition and vice versa. \n\nDuring testing, SCP-4168-1 was separated from SCP-4168 and SCP-4168-2 for a period of five days (the longest such test conducted). At the end of this period, SCP-4168-1 had large abscesses covering approximately 70% of its skin. Additionally, its heart, ribcage, and other internal organs were partially exposed due to the advanced decomposition of surrounding tissue. SCP-4168-1 reported severe pain but was not otherwise impaired or in danger of death. Upon returning SCP-4168 and SCP-4168-2 to the presence of SCP-4168-1, these changes reverted sequentially in the reverse order that they appeared, and on a similar time frame. \n\nThe injuries caused by SCP-4168 can only be viewed on film or video by SCP-4168-1. For others to witness SCP-4168's effects, said individuals must be in the physical presence of SCP-4168-1.\n\nUpon being questioned, SCP-4168-2 has refused to reveal any information about the origins of SCP-4168, only briefly making statements that led researchers to conclude that it was aware of SCP-4168's anomalous properties prior to gifting it to SCP-4168-1. This interview has been added to [# SCP-4168-Supplement.]\n\n@@ @@ \n**Addendum-1:** SCP-4168-1 and SCP-4168-2 had a significant online presence prior to containment through a Youtube Channel called 'TheSweetCheeksDuo' which had a significant amount of posts pertaining to SCP-4168 and its effects. SCP-4168 came to the Foundation's attention when news reports of a popular YouTube personality being hospitalized for unexplained and sudden decomposition began to spread, along with hospital reports of an unusual medical condition. Upon investigation, Foundation researchers found several videos and social media posts made by SCP-4168-1 and SCP-4168-2 discussing SCP-4168, including deleted videos retrieved by digital trackers. \n\nBelow is a series of transcripts of excerpts from YouTube videos relating to SCP-4168.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\" Open Transcripts\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Video Title:** SWEETEST FIANC√â EVER GETS FIANC√âE AMAZING GIFT üíïüòç\n\n**Upload Date:** 02/16/2019\n\n//Transcript from 2:03 to 5:38//\n\n**SCP-4168-1:** So ANYWAYS!
