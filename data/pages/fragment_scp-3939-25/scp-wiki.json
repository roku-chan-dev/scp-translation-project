When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.\n\nSCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nThe Foundation is lazy?\n\nNo.\n\nThe Foundation is many things. It's cold. It can be uncaring. It does what has to be done, even if everyone is opposed to it. And sometimes it's even unethical. But it is not lazy. Billions of dollars go into containment. Just as many man-hours. Just as many lives. Well, not just as many, but a lot.\n\nWhatever reason this thing is still down here, it's not because no one could be bothered to sort it out.\n\n//It's a completely valid reason, though//, you think to yourself. And it is. This skip might just be so minor that nobody bothered to document it. There are so many more important skips that really need the effort to keep them contained, to keep them properly documented so that they can be properly contained. If this is the reason, you can't write that down on the document. So you just leave it out.\n\nThat does still leave one question, though.\n\nWhat makes this thing an SCP? What makes it anomalous? What makes it something that jeopardises normalcy? What makes it something worth documenting in the first place? Why have you been tasked with this job?\n\nThe answer to that question will be a job for tomorrow.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/29 Publish the draft â€” it's time to go home.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
