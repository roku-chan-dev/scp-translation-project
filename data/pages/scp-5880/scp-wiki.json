Access to the item or information regarding the item is prohibited unless approved by the item's acting HMCL Supervisor, currently Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson.\n\nKnown instances of SCP-5880-1 are to be sedated for approximately 3 weeks. Recovered instances are to be quarantined until 24 hours after the cessation of symptoms, at which point they are to be subjected to amnestic therapy sufficient to eradicate all memories of the symptomatic period. \n\nParavirology Division Unit 2 has been assigned to the investigation of SCP-5880 and other non-anomalous strains of influenza and develop vaccinations as necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5880 is an anomalous, highly contagious strain of Influenza B contracted through either physical or memetic infection. Initial infection of SCP-5880 progresses similarly to other, non-anomalous infections. Common symptoms include coughing, congestion, upper respiratory irritation, head/body ache, fever, and fatigue. Due to the anomalous effects of SCP-5880, infected individuals are significantly less likely to receive medical assistance, and thus more likely to suffer complications. The current fatality rate is approximately 32%.\n\nSCP-5880-1 designates any symptomatic carriers of SCP-5880. Anomalous properties manifest with the onset of compulsory symptoms, approximately 48 hours after initial infection. Following this, individuals will begin to religiously worship the influenza virus, as well as related infections and symptoms. The specific actions varies between individuals, but in all instances, individuals will attempt to actively transmit SCP-5880 and proliferate instances of SCP-5880-1. Sedation during the symptomatic period of SCP-5880 infection has thus far been effective in preventing this effect.\n\n**Addendum 5880-1:** Discovery\n\nOn 11/12/2019, Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson submitted a behavioral report regarding his assigned team of Foundation personnel investigating the global outbreak of Influenza B for potentially anomalous influences. The following records includes the report and subsequent documentation.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Report 5880-1\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\n[[div style=\"display : block ; border : none ; background: #FFFFFF; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding : 15px; box-shadow : 0 0 7px rgba(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.3);\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 140%]]**Administrative Report**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 120%]]//November 12th, 2019//[[/size]]\n//Senior Researcher Lukas Johansson//\n[[/>]]\n\n-----\n\nAs the most senior researcher assigned to my team (after accounting for the condition of liable administrative personnel), I am submitting a report regarding the situation in Site-██.

Paravirology. Co-lead of Unit 2.\n\n**Nguyen:** Thank you, Dr. Johansson. Now, I'm sure you know what I'm about to ask you about.\n\n**Johansson:** What's going on? Or why I'm not affected?\n\n**Nguyen:** Both. Let's start with the former.\n\n**Johansson:** As I'm sure you know, every year, one research team from the paravirology division is assigned to investigate influenza, since its pervasiveness makes it extremely susceptible to anomalous influences, or at the very least, compromises immune systems, allowing anomalous infections to occur. \n\n(//Johansson leans forward and places his palms together.//)\n\n**Johansson:** This year, it wasn't a secondary infection, but the flu //itself.//\n\n**Nguyen:** How so?\n\n**Johansson:** I'm not completely sure //how//, but I //do// know is that it has something to do with influenza's genetic instability. You know how every year, the civilian population is administered a different vaccine?\n\n**Nguyen:** Of course.\n\n**Johansson:** Influenza develops mutations quite rapidly. This appears to be some...extreme mutation, allowing for optimal proliferation. Strain B infects basically only humans, or at least what resembles human organic material. And I think that somehow, this strain has adapted to human //intelligence.//\n\n**Nguyen:** But the Foundation has dealt with superviruses before. They simply become immune to vaccines, or develop a counter-\n\n**Johansson:** No, no, not like that. The vaccine for influenza has been available for, what, 80 years? Life //always// finds a way. Think about it. Why keep trying to fighting, if you can just convince them to //give up?//\n\n**Nguyen:** Or better yet...to worship you.\n\n**Johansson:** Exactly. And if it's already done it once, it'll probably be able to do it again.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Johansson:** Now that we've got the //bad// news out of the way, let me tell you the //good// news.\n\n**Nguyen:** What's the good news?\n\n**Johansson:** Well. As usual, when a contagious disease affects a population, individuals begin developing immunity.\n\n(//Johansson leans back into his chair and crosses his arm.//)\n\n**Nguyen:** You're saying you're immune.\n\n(//Johansson returns to a normal sitting position.//)\n\n**Johansson:** I've displayed absolutely //no// symptoms. No coughing, fever...no compulsive effects, either.\n\n(//Nguyen furrows his brow.//)\n\n**Nguyen:** So you're saying that...we can neutralize the flu?\n\n**Johansson:** Not quite. Even the Foundation hasn't been able to completely neutralize the flu. Believe me; I was part of the 2009 flu team, and we all know how //that// went. New strains pop up all the time. \n\n**Nguyen:** So what //are// you suggesting?\n\n**Johansson:** We figure out what makes it work. Every non-anomalous disease, we can see //why// certain symptoms occur. Now we have a sample of the disease, and an individual that is immune. \n\n(//Johansson point to the door.//)\n\n**Johansson:** Out there, there's dozens of people who we know are //not// immune. And if that's not enough, we have a few dozen more D-Class. We can compare our genetics, figure out how the hell it's getting into peoples' minds.\n\n**Nguyen:** I see.\n\n**Johasson:** First thing I'm doing when this is done, I'm submitting a request to the paravirology division administration.

In October.\n\n**Nguyen:** So this began in October?\n\n**Sherman:** I think...yeah. That's right. Must have started coughing and stuff around the same time. Hart - the doc in charge of sanitation - got on me about that. Pretty soon, I was coughing intentionally, but since I'm a field agent, I only met with a few people before the whole thing blew up. I think...hang on...\n\n(//Sherman furrows her brow and appears to be deep in concentration.//)\n\n**Sherman:** I think it was Bates or Watson next. Bates wrote up some flu bible, and Watson called in a sick day around that time. Since Watson was out, Johansson took full administration, and, well, after that, you know what happened.\n\n**Nguyen:** What do you know about Johansson?\n\n**Sherman:** I've never known much about the guy. He transferred over from some other unit a while back, and the records say our whole unit got amnesticized to save us from SCP-2559 - course, I wouldn't remember the specifics - so he isn't so close to the rest of the team.\n\n**Nguyen:** Do you have any idea why he's immune?\n\n(//Sherman shrugs.//)\n\n**Sherman:** No clue. I know we definitely coughed on him, and at any rate, we got to the guys in administration after we sabotaged the air vents, so I have no idea how he's fine.\n\n(//Nguyen closes his notes.//)\n\n**Nguyen:** Alright, that's it for today. Thank you for your time, Ms. Sherman.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAs of writing, Paravirology Division Unit 2, led by Senior Researcher Lukas Johnasson, has been assigned to research SCP-5880 and potentially develop a vaccine.\n\n-----\n\n\n[[include :scp-sandbox-3:component:login-module |id=lukas-johansson2@paravirology.scp|pw=Scorpio49!!|disc=true]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Login Account\" hide=\"Logout Account\"]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : none ; background: #FFFFFF ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding : 15px; box-shadow : 0 0 7px rgba(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.3);\"]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 120%]]**Lukas Johansson**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n##grey|To: <cameron-nguyen@parabiology.scp>##\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n##red|Details##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n[[size 120%]]**5880**[[/size]]\n##grey|March 2nd, 2020 at 6:21 PM##\n\nCameron,\n\nYou said you figured something out?\n\nSenior Researcher Lukas Johansson\n**Paravirology Division Unit 2**\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : none ; background: #FFFFFF ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding : 15px; box-shadow : 0 0 7px rgba(0 , 0 , 0 , 0.3);\"]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 120%]]**Cameron Nguyen**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n##grey|To: <lukas-johansson2@parabiology.scp>##\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n##red|Details##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n[[size 120%]]**5880**[[/size]]\n##grey|March 2nd, 2020 at 6:34 PM##\n\nLukas,\n\nThe team's been trying to see what's different about your genome for ages. But I had a talk with Tori Sherman the other day, and she reminded me of something.\n\nParavirology Division Unit 2 was assigned to SCP-2559 a few years ago. In the end, every single member of the team was amnesticized. Half the team was replaced.

Modern amnestics? About 40. It's time these common, everyday contagions started responding to all the parabiological tampering the Foundation has done to its hundreds of thousands of personnel, let alone millions of amnesticized civilians.\n\nLast week, I ran the tests with an unamnesticized D-Class. You were right.\n\nWhat the fuck has the Foundation created.\n\nSenior Researcher Lukas Johansson\n**Paravirology Division Unit 2**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5879]]] | SCP-5880 | [[[SCP-5881]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
