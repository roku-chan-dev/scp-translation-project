  "content": "You take a desperate chance and try to escape through the doors you entered from. You make a mad dash through the maze of filing cabinets, ducking and weaving through your pursuers like an action hero.\n\nUnfortunately, you are an auditor, not an action hero.\n\nA swift kick from an unseen pursuer knocks you to the ground. Rolling to try and get up, you suddenly find yourself pinned by a booted foot on your chest. You look up to find yourself once again face-to-face with the barrel of a revolver. “Awfully curious for an auditor,” Hannah repeats while her booted heel holds you down. “Well, you know what they say: ‘Curiosity killed the cat.’”\n\nThe last thing you see is the muzzle flash of the revolver.\n\nCongratulations! You found the Dead Ending! Your curiosity got the better of you, and you died for it!\n\n||= Page 18 - Dead Ending||\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/0 Try again to get all 7 endings!]||\n||= or||",
