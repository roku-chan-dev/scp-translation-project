The area has since widened to include civilian populations, such as the evacuated town of Neagra, now a designated Zone-of-Alienation by the Romanian Government and Military Police, specified Zone-622, and is currently understood to inflict perception-alteration properties on individuals within its area.\n\nThe object at the centre of Zone-622 known as UTE-9839 is unknown in shape or dimensions, expected to be the source of the sensory-debilitating effects of Zone-622. Understanding of UTE-9839 would provide insight into the unexplained existence or purpose of Zone-622, and considerable efforts to recover UTE-9839 are currently underway.\n\nThe exact mechanics of the sensory-debilitating effects of Zone-622 are unclear, however individuals affected by these properties express similar narratives after exit from the zone. These include:\n\n* Mild amnesia, and slight loss of subconscious memory. Affected individuals take 1-3 days to regain coherent speech.\n* Some examples of unconsciousness or development of a mild comatose state.\n* Poor eyesight. Partial loss of smell/taste.\n\nSymptoms described above share resemblance to post-traumatic amnesia, often associated to be caused through severe neurological trauma. It is expected that this neurological trauma caused by exposure to Zone-622 is subconscious, occuring within a 1-2 hour period after entry, during which all sensory functions gradually decrease in condition. Effects are often mild, but cases of repeated or prolonged exposure to Zone-622 (exceeding 24 hours) have demonstrated severe capabilities:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #112211; background:#f4f4f4; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **[PHYSICS] ANALYSIS COMPILATION**\n+++++ **FOCUS : UTE-9839**\n+++++ **[EXTRACTS #1-2]**\n+++++ @@---------------@@\n[[/=]]\n\n= **[Extract #1 | Mikkael Caine | 67]**\n= Elderly individual, pastoral farmer, former resident of Neagra.

Operator [040-50█-2███] was found to have been exposed to the effects of Zone-622, and sustained minor yet permanent hearing loss from the duration of the call. Incident may prove UTE-9839 emits a resonance capable of inducing these effects, which was capable of transmitting across the landline.//\n[[/div]]\n\nThe subconscious neurological trauma experienced within Zone-622 will result in the entire 'desensitisation' of individuals following 5-6 hours of exposure, in which subjects will lose all sensory function; including sight, hearing, smell, taste, balance and pain. This process is irreversible after exit from Zone-622, despite individuals having suffered no physical damage to sensory organs. Individuals who have become desensitised are incapable of the most basic influence or understanding of their environment, and are without assistance observed to expire within 24 hours from accidental injury.\n\nIt is suggested that Zone-622 inflicts these properties on subjects through application of specific stimuli on the senses in order to incapacitate them. The most accepted hypothesis implies that Zone-622 is capable of emitting a resonance which induces these effects, with the use of sound-waves to disrupt or entirely block certain neurological processes while within the zone. It is expected that UTE-9839 may be the source.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #112211; background:#f4f4f4; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **[PHYSICS] ANALYSIS COMPILATION**\n+++++ **FOCUS : UTE-9839**\n+++++ **[EXTRACTS #3]**\n+++++ @@---------------@@\n[[/=]]\n\n= **ANALYSIS OF WAVELENGTHS EMITTED FROM THE EPICENTRE OF ZONE-622.**\n\nQuiet infrasonic resonances have been recorded to be emitted from Zone-622 continuously. These sounds remain at a consistent frequency of 18.97 Hz to a degree of accuracy seemingly unaffected by environmental factors (wind, pressure, echo.) Measurements taken from the forest and Neagra give the exact same reading, regardless of conditions.\n\n18.97 Hz is noted to be remarkably close to sound waves emitted by the eyes and facial muscles. Frequencies of 18.98Hz are already known to cause vision disorientation due to vibrating of the eyes, however the resonances emitted by Zone-622 are incapable of causing any lasting physical damage to sensory organs.\n\nIt is highly noted that all wavelengths considered radio, microwave, infrared or ultraviolet are nonexistent, or further cannot exist within the Zone. Remote operation of drones or other such devices cannot be performed due to this. Species of wildlife, including birds and insects, are reported to be severely affected by the disappearance of all ultraviolet light. Inexplicably, visible light still exists within Zone-622. There is no reasonable cause for this phenomenon.\n\nTracing of the ultrasounds emitted across Zone-622 point towards the epicentre, suggesting that the alleged object UTE-9839 suspected to be the source may be possible to locate using a land-based response team. However, no solution to the problem of total desensitisation has yet been made, and communication between the team and operations outside the Zone would not be possible, relying on the return of the task force if any information is to be recovered. Experimentation of possible psychological resistance to the effects of Zone-622 is pending.\n\n= **END OF EXTRACT**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe exact purpose of this perception-alteration influence is unknown. As the zone expands, it is noted that the time until total desensitisation delays. Measurements have concluded that the relationship between these two factors maintain so that time until total desensitisation is equal to the time it takes to reach the centre of Zone-622, reasoning that heading directly for the epicentre with a fast speed is unadvisable. Early hypothesis suggests that the perception-alteration influence has two theorised purposes: to prevent human interaction with or understanding of an object (UTE-9839) within the epicentre of Zone-622, or remove human influence from the area indiscriminately.\n\n[[size large]] **Rules of Engagement:** [[/size]]\n\nUTE-9839 is interminable due to our lack of whereabouts or understanding of the object. If the exact nature of UTE-9839 is determined, further means of liquidation may be approved. Research efforts are currently underway; --the proposal of co-operation with the SCP Foundation is currently pending review--.\n\n[[size large]] **History** [[/size]]\n\nZone-622 was originally discovered by Romanian Police in 2012, but began rapid expansion in early 2017. On March 4th, Zone-622 expanded unknowingly into the rural town of Neagra. Reaction from the authorities was slow and hindered, despite previous knowledge of the existence of Zone-622 for many years in the nearby wildlife reserves (notably Călimani National Park), existing in folklore but mostly nameless in the public domain.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #112211; background:#f4f4f4; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n+++ **ROMANIA POLICE SERVICE**\n+++++ **SENDER: █████ ███████ (TEL: ███-███-████)**\n+++++ **RECIPIENT: INSPECTOR GENERAL**\n+++++ **REPORT CONCERNING THE SITUATION WITHIN NEAGRA. (7/3/18)**\n\nNeagra has been isolated for 3 days. Many of the residents who have not exited through coincidence are now unknowingly dying from dehydration. They cannot communicate with us. Rises in the local bear population are suggested to be due to the abundance of a human food source. The birds are eating them as they stand.\n\nThe Foundation is nonetheless closer to finding it's so-called 'blackbox' which they claim will supply the answer to all of this. Meanwhile evacuation is occurring but not at a sufficient speed. We do not have a large enough workforce to undertake this operation. I am requesting more assistance for the evacuation process. We lost several teams who entered the town of Neagra before we were made aware of its indescribable effects. We understand as of now that while within the zone we are operating within a narrow timespace, suggested by the GOC to last 2 hours before all primary senses are lost. This means each man can withstand 2 hours within Neagra before we need a replacement. Volunteers are hardly abundant. Please, send more personnel. The people in there are being eaten as we speak.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nEvacuation of Neagra was ceased on 9/12/18 (5 days after the alienation of Neagra) after reports confirmed that 70% of residents were deceased. The highest cause of death was due to mauling, presumably from bears or other animals from the local area.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #112211; background:#f4f4f4; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ **TRANSCRIPT COMPILATION**\n++++ **FOCUS: UTE-9839**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n= //[8/3/18] (00:00 - 58:38)//\n= //Recording Transcript of GOC Intervention Expedition Into Zone-622.//\n\n= **Involved:** 93320001/431 (Pvt.

Current understanding of UTE-9839 prevents us from taking appropriate action. Recommend contacting external sources for assistance on this matter.||\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Foundation was unsupportive of both nuclear tests, indicating that removal of UTE-9839 may hinder further access to Zone-622. Events have recently escalated, and the Foundation has temporarily discontinued cooperation with the GOC. It is expected that due the breaking of this alliance the CI may attempt to intervene with the Romanian Government. To prevent further harmful interference, additional nuclear tests are awaiting deployment. Diplomatic efforts to lower hostilities from the SCP Foundation and Romanian Government are underway.\n\n= **EVENTS IN PROGRESS**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
