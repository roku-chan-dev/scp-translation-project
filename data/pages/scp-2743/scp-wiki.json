Due to the size of SCP-2743 instances and its distance from Earth, academic and government-backed astronomy centers are the only institutions that require monitoring. \n\nObservational satellites have been placed in orbit around each instance, as well as three surface probes equipped with a thermonuclear device with a yield of approximately 30 megatons. \n\nIn the event of discovery, a cover story is to be disseminated among the astronomy community attributing all findings to a practical joke. The original publisher of the report or photographs is to be discredited by any means necessary. At this point, the thermonuclear probes must be detonated to prevent a Broken Masquerade scenario.\n\nBecause of the continual advancements in the fields of astronomy and space exploration, the discovery of SCP-2743 is considered an inevitability if it remains in its current orbit. As such, the ongoing development of physical containment methods for SCP-2743 instances is a Class IV Priority. \n[[include component:image-block\n    name=1.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-2743 highlighted on an orbital scan of Saturn's outer satellites.|\n    width=300px\n]]\n**Description:** SCP-2743 designates four organic satellites within Saturn's Phoebe Ring.[[footnote]]The Phoebe Ring is made primarily of debris from Phoebe and orbits Saturn at a distance of 180 to 250 radii. The ring itself has a thickness of 40 radii.[[/footnote]] These satellites, ranging from 2km - 5km in length, have been identified as the corpses of four Jötnar-Class[[footnote]] An anomalous species of extra-dimensional entities, referred to by Norse mythology as Jötunn or giants. [[/footnote]] humanoid entities, documented as SCP-2743-1 through SCP-2743-4. All four instances were discovered wearing armor and clothing resembling 10th-century depictions of Norse mythological warriors.\n@@ @@\n**Addendum/2743/A**\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\n•\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nReport/2743-1\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nDiscovery\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\n2000/2/23 Rhea Orbital Satellite revealed SCP-2743-1 approximately 13 Gm from Saturn's outer atmosphere. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSubject is a humanoid entity measuring 2.1 km in length with a physical appearance of a human female between 8-10 years of age. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nNotes\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSubject appears to have expired due to blunt force trauma to the zygomatic and maxilla region which caused the entity's facial structure to collapse inward.
