The well-oiled bearings in the simple platform she has constructed don't make a sound, and her surroundings move around her perspective in blessed silence. The long window comes into view once more and the stars are different, the ship in its own rotational pattern, maintaining an artificial sense of gravity.\n\n//You are still Qasim.//\n\nThe voice of her master speaks to her unbidden. She can hear his rasping, insistent tenor clearly in the arched gateways of her mind. Her own voice responds. \n\n//Yes. I am.//\n\nShe has been her own master since leaving her village.

Their pronouncements, made quietly but audibly to the villagers leaving the evening prayers every Friday, are nothing in the face of true knowledge.   \n\n//There is none but Allah.//\n\nShe stands up now, planting her bare feet on the platform as though bracing herself against a coming wind. \n\n//There is none but Allah.

The path ahead is obscured by great clouds, burning to the touch, annihilating to the unwary.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
