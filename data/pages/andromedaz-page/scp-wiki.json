This idea stemmed from an alien civilization intent on enslaving us for our ideas and creativity, but was eventually turned into a civilization who wants quite the opposite; to protect us from the dangers of the universe, and ourselves. Additionally, when we think of powerful skips, they are usually the type that wants to eradicate us, either intentionally or because we are microbes to them. SCP-6812 on the other hand is a powerful, extragalactic civilization that cherishes us.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **[[[SCP-6746]]] - Trollskogen** 🌲\n= //Pine's camera faces upwards, where the fog layer begins to change.

This was an attempt to SCP-ify one of those, and incorporates elements of body horror, deities, and overall the paranormal in general. Additionally, certain Scandinavian celebrations are usually affiliated with rituals, the paranormal, sacrifices, etc., which is another aspect in this article.

While there are certainly people with creations out there who want to help you become more inspired and motivated, most of those books and videos about how to improve your life aren't among them.

I wrote this at a time when I had little motivation to write for the SCP wiki. Then the announcement for the 7k contest came, and the ideas began flowing. The initial idea with the endings was to have them randomized, but I preferred going with a you-choose-the-ending formula. This was a hard story to write, given the headache that is pataphysics, and I hope to revise parts of it that were...less good. However, I can proudly say I've tackled pataphysics and made it (somewhat) comprehensive!  \n\nThe 7k contest was a fun time, I must say! \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n= [[size 150%]]**Others**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/andromedaz-page Andromedaz's Universe of Dreams]** 🪐\n= The page you are on.

[[/footnote]] ||  \n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Andromedavice]]\n**Downvotes**\n\nDownvotes can be a headache to put up with as a writer for the SCP wiki. The reason for this is that //votes are more blunt than critique.// Constructive critique tells you what the reader liked and/or disliked about your work. A vote simply tells you \"this is good\" or \"this is bad\", which is less useful. I have received a number of downvotes across my works, which can get frustrating. However, simultaneously I've developed methods of 'coping' with them, and better yet, translating them into critique; so to speak. Here is my advice for you if you are getting downvoted without knowing why.\n\n* **Who is downvoting?** - Are they experienced veteran readers? Casual readers? Newer readers?[[footnote]] Who might not quite understand the rating system. [[/footnote]] People who have set their standards absurdly high? Realizing //who// is downvoting can help you see what standard you are not meeting. This can also be applied for upvotes, where you may be appealing to twelve newer readers, but in reality your work is not up to site standards.\n\n* **What type of article did you write?** - Let's say you wrote an exploration based SCP, and it did well. Next you wrote a journal-based SCP, and it didn't do as well. This is where compare and contrast comes in. From this you can perhaps realize what type of article you do better with, and what you can improve in.\n\n* **Keep them away from your head!** - Your writing is not necessarily a reflection of your ability to be yourself, neither are votes. The reader is downvoting because they are not a fan of the //article//, not because they dislike you. And if they're doing it out of a dislike towards you, then staff shall bring down the banhammer on them![[footnote]] It's called malicious downvoting. [[/footnote]]\n\n* **Don't get discouraged!** - If you are a new writer and your first article does poorly, and you just cannot understand what you did wrong, sometimes it's best to see the module rate as just a number and move on. It is more important what you do //afterwards//. We all start at different places on the writers spectrum, and most people don't get a runaway success off the bat. I would put myself rather low on that spectrum, but what I try and do is //commit myself to improving// with each article. Overall, my best advice is //don't give up.//[[footnote]] And don't take advice from SCP-6480. [[/footnote]]\n\nNow, for some of my personal //immediate// downvote triggers.[[footnote]] //Immediate//. Just because an article avoids the following, doesn't clear it of a possible downvote from me. [[/footnote]]\n\n* **Obvious low-effort** - These are usually the result of new writers who scramble to get something onto the site, only for it to get deleted. If it happened to you, don't feel bad about it. Nobody here hates you for it (not even me who probably downvoted it). Just slow down, read some newer articles to get familiar with the site standards, and seek some critique, to tip the odds in favor of positive ratings. Also, we do have a sandbox site.\n\n* **Series I syndrome** - This usually hooks in with what newer writers try to do. Articles that are just Wikipedia articles about magical or deadly objects or entities, with a bunch of blackboxes and expungments. This is not 2010 people. We need stories, not generic scientific documents. While on this topic, I'd say keep expungments out of your article completely, unless you're doing some type of format screw where it is appropriate.\n\n* **Too specific conprocs** - Does it //really// need to be 10 m x 15 m x 10.765 m? Will a 2 cm difference cause a containment breach?\n\n* **A deadly monster? Let's nuke it!** - I'm not talking about a GOC format. I'm talking about the Foundation putting a deadly monster to the test by detonating the Tsar bomb on it. Yeah, that is unlike them.  \n\n* **Massive hearer in which the overseers tell me the file clearance**  [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6746 A small hearder for styling is okay to me], but throwing up a header that takes up the entire screen is...excessive. We don't need the clearance level screamed in our faces.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab So you want to talk with me?]]\nThe easiest way you can contact me is through Wikidot PM!
