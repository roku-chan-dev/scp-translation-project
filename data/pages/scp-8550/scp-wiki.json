Infected individuals are to be quarantined in a sealed standard humanoid containment cell, and immolated upon cessation of life signs. Any site personnel showcasing typical symptoms of early-stage infection are to be reported to Dr. Graham as soon as possible.\n> \nWhen interacting with SCP-8550-2 instances, a grade 3 hazmat suit must be worn at all times. Equipment is to be inspected daily for holes, or any other possible means of entry for infection. Should a hole be torn in a hazmat suit while interacting with SCP-8550-2 instances, affected personnel are to leave the area immediately, and submit themselves for quarantine. \n> \n**Description:** SCP-8550 is composed of three constituent parts. \n> \n--SCP-8550 refers to the theoretical cause of SCP-8550. Proposed by Research Head Dr. Graham, it suggests that there's a sentient entity at the heart of SCP-8550-1. Further research into the validity of this proposal is ongoing.-- SCP-8550-1 refers to an anomalously altered circovirus. These alterations have granted it status as a new species, hereby designated //Circovirus minimafrange//. //C. minimafrange// appears to be extremely small, only about 0.8 nanometers across. SCP-8550 has displayed several odd traits, such as random periods of inactivity, despite possible hosts being nearby.\n> \nSCP-8550 has also displayed the ability to lay dormant for a period of up to 3 days, which would help transmit it.\n> \nThe only currently known way to destroy SCP-8550-1 permanently within an area is immolation. \n> \nSCP-8550-1 refers to a process by which people slowly degrade on an atomic level. The amount of time this process takes varies, ranging from 3 to 24 hours. However, it has been universally observed to be extremely painful to the subject. There are no currently known ways of reversing the process once it has started. A document detailing typical symptoms and stages has been attached below.\n> \nSCP-8550-2 refers to individuals and objects infected with SCP-8550. They are extremely contagious, with even a touch allowing for communication of the disease. \n> \nFailure to contain SCP-8550 could lead to a DK-Class \"Infected Earth\" Scenario[[footnote]]Humanity collapses in one way or another due to anomalous disease.[[/footnote]].\n> \n**Discovery:** SCP-8550 was discovered on 17/02/22 when Foundation spies embedded within several hospitals across the United States started sending in reports of deaths caused by spontaneous degradation of the body's structure. SCP-8550 was officially designated as such soon after.\n> \n**Addendum 8550.1: SCP-8550-2 Interview**\n> \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 19/02/22\n\n**NOTE:** The following log details an interview between Researcher Richards, from the Department of Microbiology, and James Howe[[footnote]]Designated as SCP-8550-2-1.[[/footnote]], an individual recently afflicted with SCP-8550, conducted at Site-10 The interview was conducted before anyone was aware of how contagious SCP-8550 was. \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//James Howe is sat down in a detainment cell. Researcher Richards enters and sits down opposite them.// \n\n**Researcher Richards:** Good evening, SCP-8550-2-1.\n\n**Howe:** Where am I? And why does everyone keep calling me that? My name is James. James Howe.\n\n**Researcher Richards:** We're aware of your real identity. \n\n**Howe:** When can I go home?\n\n**Researcher Richards:** I'm afraid that's not possible.\n\n**Howe:** I want to go home! I'm not saying anything unless I can go home!\n\n//Researcher Richards sighs.//\n\n**Researcher Richards:** Will you tell me what I want to know if I promise to let you go after?\n\n**Howe:** And I want you to call me by my real name, not that stupid number. \n\n**Researcher Richards:** Very well. You have my word.\n\n**Researcher Richards:** Now, why don't you explain to me what you've been feeling? Physical symptoms, that is. \n\n**Howe:** Pain. It's in my legs and chest, mostly. Hurts like crazy. It's almost like someone's taking me apart bit by bit. I also ran my hand through my hair the other day when I was showering, and half of it came off. \n\n//James Howe shudders.//\n\n**Howe:** That's when I went to the hospital, where you guys kidnapped me. \n\n**Researcher Richards:** We didn't... whatever. When did you start feeling all these symptoms?\n\n**Howe:** About two days ago. \n\n**Researcher Richards:** Very well. Guards, you can take him to his cell.\n\n**Howe:** What?! You promised I could go home!\n\n**Researcher Richards:** That's not up to me.\n\n**Howe:** You bastard! You'll regret this!\n\n**Researcher Richards:** This interview is concluded.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n> \n**Closing Statement:** Approximately six hours after the conclusion of this interview, SCP-8550-2-1 collapsed, in apparent agony. Medics sent in discovered it on the floor, seemingly shedding all their skin and muscles at a rapid rate. At roughly the same time, Researcher Richards and the guards involved in SCP-8550-2-1's interview also began displaying typical symptoms of SCP-8550. Contact with the site was lost soon after and the onsite nuclear warhead was detonated remotely. \n\n[[/div]]\n> \n**Addendum 8550.1: SCP-8550 Typical Symptoms**\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nStage\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nSymptoms\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nStage 1\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nExcessive itching, particularly in the chest and thigh areas, theorized to be SCP-8550-3 targeting the areas of most mass.

The only choice you do have is whether or not you go willingly. I wish it were otherwise, but it's not. So, what will it be?\n\n//Dr. Graham hesitates before answering.//\n\n**Dr. Graham:** Very well. I'll go willingly.\n\n**Site Director Patterson:** Excellent.

Blackwell:** And then you're going to send us into an atom, and just hope something is there?\n\n**Sr. Researcher Allen:** Our research suggests there is. So yes.\n\n**Cpl. Meadows:** And this also happens to be inside the body of a person infected with a highly contagious disease that has a 100% fatality rate?\n\n**Dr. Graham:** You missed a couple parts, but essentially, yes.\n\n**Cpl. Jansen:** And you're sure this is safe.\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** Mostly.\n\n**Cpl. Meadows:** What does that even - \n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Can you just be quiet please? I have a headache already. \n\n**Cpl. Jansen:** Look, can't we just, I don't know, shrink there or something? It's an atom, right?\n\n**Researcher Williams:** This isn't Ant-Man. You can't get to another universe by shrinking into it anymore than you can reach another universe by speed-walking. The only way for normal people like us to reach said universes is through the use of Way's or some other form of anomalous transportation.\n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** Can you at least tell us if we'll live.\n\n**Dr. Graham:** 90% sure.\n\n**Cpl. Meadows:** Wait, what?\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** Oh, and one more thing to keep in mind. Time is going to move a lot differently down there, simply because you'll be in another universe. So we'll be out of most forms of contact. Just try and stay alive. And if you need to come back, press this.\n\n//Senior Researcher Hanson hands Squad Captain Hayden a device.//\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** This is the one device we have that we've found can reliably reach other universes with its signal. Good luck.\n\n//All the researchers leave the room.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** Shortly after the room was emptied of researchers, there was a flash of light, presumed to be Way being activated and Chi-7 entering it.\n\n[[/div]]\n> \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Notes:** The following log was recorded by the bodycams placed on MTF Chi-7's outfits upon entry into SCP-8550.\n\n**Date:** 24/02/22\n\n**Responding Team:** MTF Chi-7\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8550\n\n**Mission Command:** N/A\n\n**Team Lead:** Squad Captain Hadyen\n\n**Team Members:** Corporal Blackwell, Corporal Jansen, Corporal Meadows\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//The camera opens up on what appears to be some sort of city, though not one of Earth.//\n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** Holy shit.\n\n**Cpl. Jansen:** Graham was right, it would seem.\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Indeed. Alright, mission report. From what I can tell, we've been \"teleported\" into some sort of city. However the structure here is... baffling at best. \n\n**Cpl. Meadows:** The geometry is all off. It's like this entire universe runs off of some form of geometry I've never seen before. I'm not sure what to make of it. What I can see is that it looks...\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Dead. Or dying. I don't see any living things around.\n\n**Cpl. Jansen:** It's kind of freaky.\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Alright, let's move. See if we can find anything. \n\n//Chi-7 begins rapidly sweeping the streets, until they come across a vaguely familiar building, despite the vast differences in geometrical structure.//\n\n**Cpl. Jansen:** Is that...\n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** Yeah. That's Site-09.\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** For the record, it appears that this universe had its own Foundation as well. Let's go. Perhaps we can find something about SCP-8550 in here. \n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** Are we sure that's a good idea? I'd be willing to bet the geometry in there is just as confusing as it is out here. And I'd rather not knock over a jar of... atomic smallpox, and die. \n\n//Squad Captain Hayden looks at Corporal Blackwell sternly.//\n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** You know what, fair enough. Onwards, I say. \n\n//Chi-7 enters the building and begins to navigate through, despite the inherent difficulties present, and successfully reach where SCP-8550 research chamber is on Earth.//\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Hm. Important to note. Despite the differences in geometry between here and Earth, computers appear to be able to be used just like our computers, albeit with some visual changes. Meadows, see if you can get in. \n\n**Cpl. Meadows:** I dunno. Might as well try the same password as usual. Oh, it works. That's... oddly disconcerting. And here's SCP-8550 file.\n\n//The file has been transcribed below, though most of it was illegible due to the state of the computer.//\n> \n> **Item #:** SCP-8550\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8550 is to have a blood sacrifice every day at noon.

Meadows:** Done. Now can we get out of here?\n\n**Cpl. Blackwell:** And, uh, can we do it fast?\n\n//Corporal Blackwell points at the sun, which is in the process of turning black. The city Chi-7 arrived in also begins to flake and vanish, presumed to be a result of SCP-8550-3 arriving.//\n\n**Squad Captain Hayden:** Oh shit.\n\n//The flaking effect begins to spread at a rapid pace towards Chi-7, who escape via the device given to Squad Captain Hayden by Dr. Graham.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** MTF Chi-7 reappeared in the testing chamber 3 minutes after they left, physically unharmed. All data was collected and screened for memetic hazards, before being viewed.

We still learned valuable information, even if it isn't necessarily going to help us contain SCP-8550 more effectively, or cure it even.\n\n**Researcher Williams:** And that's the point. This info is useless to our containment efforts. I'm beginning to think that - \n\n**Dr. Graham:** Peace, Duncan. \n\n**Researcher Williams:** Yes, my apologies. But regardless, my point stands. We did not learn anything beyond the fact that gods may be germs.\n\n**Containment Specialist O'Reilly:** Perhaps it doesn't bring us closer to curing this. But that doesn't make the information useless.\n\n//Researcher Williams attempts to talk before Security Officer Chance enters the room.//\n\n**Security Officer Chance:** SCP-8550-2-2 is dead. \n\n**Dr. Graham:** I wish it hadn't had to happen that way. \n\n**Researcher Williams:** And that just proves my point. What has this little excursion of ours shown? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. We are no closer to curing this disease than we are to changing species 100% reliably. \n\n//Senior Researcher Hanson snorts//\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** We're closer to that than you might think.\n\n**Dr. Graham:** Wait, what was that?\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** What, that we're closer to being able to change species than Williams thinks?\n\n//Dr. Graham laughs.//\n\n**Dr. Graham:** That's how we'll deal with it. Alter the atomic structure of humanity! This is a virus that breaks down atoms, so we'll teach the body how to build them back up, allowing time for antibody formation! Good job, Hanson.\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** I, er, you're welcome?\n\n**Researcher Williams:** Wait a second. How do you even plan on changing the atomic structure of every human on Earth? Even ignoring that, how do we even do that with one person?\n\n**Dr. Graham:** We could use vaccines? Most people tend to get them anyway. And the resistant few could be convinced to through use of an artificial meme. Simple.\n\n**Sr. Researcher Allen:** Right. Simple.\n\n**Dr. Graham:** As for how to do it at all, we will be using the same technology Hanson mentioned, just repurposed.\n\n**Sr. Researcher Hanson:** I shouldn't have spoken.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** Tests were shortly undergone regarding atomic restructuring and their impact on SCP-8550 infection.\n> \n**Addendum 8550.12: Atomic Restructuring Tests**\n> \n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nAttempt Number\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nResults\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n1\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSubject exposed to SCP-8550.
