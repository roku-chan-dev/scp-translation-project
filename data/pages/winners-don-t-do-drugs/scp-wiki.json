All he could do now was just sit there in his seat and stare forwards now that he was in the spotlight. His father continued reading paragraph after paragraph of his teachers' notes and complaints.\n\n\"It's all just the same stuff, over and over,\" his father huffed as he flipped the report card over, his voice hushed and monotonous as if he were sighing every word. It was a voice that suited the dreary-looking man well, as well as his clothes. Johnny's father normally wore a rather monochrome outfit: a short sleeved Oxford shirt, black tie, and black slacks. \n\nHe scanned over the inverse side of the report card. \"Same 'he loves the class but won't do the work,' every single time.\" \n\nJohnny looked at his dad wide-eyed as if he was a confused pet. The wall behind him in his father's study was lined with a multitude of diplomas, class photos, and vintage, grainy portraits of men in labcoats standing beside their experiments. It did well in adding a stinging irony to the whole ordeal.\n\nHis father continued. \"'...Jonathan Ward has a great attitude in class but almost religiously fails to turn in homework...' '...I fear Mr. Ward lacks the work ethic to succeed in this rigorous course...' '...Johnny's attention in class is seemingly //ad-hoc// and gung-ho to topics he takes great interest in, but this is not reflected in his homework or quizzes...'\"\n\n\"I got a 90 on the history quiz.\" Johnny cringed internally as his attempt at lightening the mood only drew ire from his father.\n\n\"You know, Johnny...\" his father began, rolling his eyes as he set down the report card. \"You're on track to flunk out if you keep this up. I don't know what else to do.\"\n\nHe then began assessing his son with his judgemental black eyes, briefly scratching the top of his black crew cut before returning his attention to the report card. He pulled out a manilla folder where he stored Johnny’s report cards and slipped the latest inside. Johnny watched as his father carefully adjusted the folder’s orientation until it was as parallel with the edge of the desk.\n\nHe then lifted his hands from the folder, careful not to disturb its perfectly straight orientation on his meticulously neat desk. \"I can't continue to waste my money on your mistakes anymore. You need a tutor. You're old enough to find one, and the school has plenty.\"\n\n\"How am //I// supposed to get a tutor?\" Johnny whined. \"I don't know how to, or where to start, and the ones at school...\" He then began backtracking. \"Wait, no, I can do this. I can do the work, just trust me...\"\n\nJohnny's father rubbed his temples. \"You're eighteen. Ask your friends, ask your counselor,\" His father paused, jabbing a thumb backwards to the diplomas behind him. \"Or, ask me. I know a few people. You can also look it up online. Make use of all those hours you spend gaming on that damn computer for once.\"\n\n//This sucks balls,// Johnny thought to himself, almost blurting those words out loud as he shrugged his shoulders, defeated. \"It's weird, Dad... because I want to do good, but, like, I don't know //how// to do good. Can't focus, don't like the work...\"\n\n\"Man up, and have some faith in yourself, Johnny. After all, I have all the faith that you //can// do so.\" His father's tone lightened for only a split second as he sighed. \"You've made it this far. Don't waste it away. Like I said, I can't pay for your mistakes or hear your excuses anymore, unless it's to get a tutor. So, go get one.\" \n\nJohnny's father then stopped, noticing his phone had begun vibrating on the table. He reached for it, standing up from his seat. \n\n\"Maybe then, you'll learn a thing or two about good study habits.\" He looked down at his son with the same judging glare, although a smidge of affection was in his tone this time around. \"Let me know who you pick by the end of the week, and I'll work something out. Gotta take a call.\"\n\nJohnny watched his father pass him and exit the study, then waited until he was out of earshot. He pouted, resting an elbow on the table as he propped up his chin against his palm, then gave a loud sigh.\n\n\"This sucks //balls//.\" \n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=brick\n|username=brick\n|msg-time=Today at 8:46 PM\n]]\nbrick wants to know where Johnny is\nWe supposed 2 b raiding 2nite\nduble XP\nhget on vcoice\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=astro\n|username=astro929923\n|msg-time=Today at 8:46 PM\n]]\nHow did you make those rune pics in [[span class=\"at_mention\"]]#brick_archive[[/span]]?

The man-shaped void emanated an unnatural, cosmic darkness as it stood there motionless, almost as if Johnny was viewing a chunk of the world that was missing from reality.\n\nThere were no defining features on its face except an unnaturally large open maw, filled with rows of white, razor sharp teeth... albeit vestigial, given the sheer volume of teeth. A clear liquid dripped from its mouth and fell to the wood floor, giving off a repetitive wet pitter-patter noise. \n\n\"//Jooohhhnny//...\" it whispered, its voice slurred and slow as if it were artificially modified. It slowly turned its head towards him, its open maw reshaping into a crude smile. It then raised a fist, two clawed fingers extending out in a peace sign.\n\nJohnny could barely speak at all. His mind stopped thinking about his //run, hide, or fight// plan as he instead started losing his shit. His legs slightly buckled as tears formed in his eyes, which were still having difficulty adjusting to the paranatural darkness before him. He just stared at the //thing// in the doorway, frozen in awe and fright.\n\nThe silhouette entered as smoothly as a panther, its steps giving off a light thumping noise as if it were walking barefoot on the floor.\n\n\"...//I shall get my fair share//...\"\n\nThe room seemed to warp and contort around Johnny as if it were being stretched like silly putty as the entity extended a hand out towards him.\n\n\"....//one way or **another**//!\" \n\nIts movements were surreal, as if they were from an animation in 60 frames per second. In only a few bounds, the entity had made it halfway across the living room and into Johnny's face, pushing him towards the kitchen with a single shove as it bounded over the sofa.\n\nJohnny fell to the floor, but before he could move, the entity had pounced on him, pinning him to the floor as it opened its maw. More of the slimy, clear liquid dripped down onto his face as he bore the brunt of an otherworldly howl that seemed to vibrate him and the room around him.\n\nJohnny's ears continued ringing as the monster grabbed him by the neck, beginning to squeeze tight as its breaths became more and more laborous. He flopped his arms onto the entity's wrist in an attempt to get it off his neck, but to no avail. His hands began to slip across its oily skin, his fingertips feeling a tingling sensation similar to the effect of his arms falling asleep as he began losing control over his limbs. \n\n\"Clethos...\" Johnny croaked weakly. The creature only continued huffing as it placed two hands around his neck, tightening its grip.\n\n\"...//squeeze his head off... squeeze his head off... squeeze his head off... squeeze his head off... squeeze his head **off**...//\"\n\nJohnny began seeing stars as the world began to darken around him...\n\n= ***\n\n= **CLICK-CLACK**\n\nClethos immediately loosened its grip on Johnny's neck. Johnny took a long and loud gasp as he broke into a violent coughing fit, painfully turning his head towards whatever the entity looming above him was looking at. He saw black dress shoes and black slacks... along with the shape of something long and dark held in the arms of his father.\n\nThat sound he heard was instantly recognizable as the sound of a shotgun racking, the universal \nsound to kiss your ass goodbye. \n\n**BANG**\n\nThick, tar-like ectoplasm spattered against Johnny's face and the nearby furniture as Clethos staggered backwards, slowly looking down at the dinner plate-sized hole in its chest. It hissed with fury and assumed a combat stance as it lunged at Johnny's father, but not before he racked the tactical shotgun again and put another blast into the entity's head at point blank.\n\n**BANG**\n\nJohnny cringed as he saw Clethos's body fly across the room, ragdolling and dropping to the floor atop their coffee table, snapping it in two. It raised what Johnny now assumed to be its head, which it was missing half of along with a sizable portion of its jaw, as it turned towards his father.\n\n**CLICK-CLACK** \n\n**BANG**\n\nJohnny's father wasted no time in shooting the monster again. More oily chunks were blasted from Clethos's head as it was almost completely reduced to pulpy ribbons, its teeth littering the floor like confetti from a party. It weakly raised an arm towards Johnny's father as it hissed and groaned like an injured animal.\n\nJohnny saw his father simply kick the arm away, bending it at an impossible angle to the side and placing his right foot on the arm, while he planted his left foot on Clethos's chest.\n\n**CLICK-CLACK** \n\n**BANG**\n\nClethos finally went limp as Johnny's father stepped off the monster, racking his shotgun for one last time. Johnny really had no words about the whole ordeal as he watched his father calmly place the shotgun against the couch, reaching into his pocket for his phone and dialing a number. He then placed the phone to his ear.\n\n\"Hello? ...yeah. It's Dr. Ward. ...yeah, I had a bit of a situation at home. ... Yes, it's been resolved.\" His father began to pace back and forth. \"Just need cleanup and some Class A here,\" He paused, turning to his son as he glanced at him. \"For one.\"\n\n\"..Dad..? What's going on..?\"\n\nHis father hung up the phone and put it in his pocket. \"Johnny... holy **shit**. I thought I //told// you to work //smart//, not hard...\"\n\nJohnny sat up on his butt. \"B-but I did—\"\n\n\"**No**. You worked //dumb//.\" His father said sternly as he emphasized his frustration with a knifehand. He sighed, briefly glancing over the corpse of the entity he had just killed. Steam rose from the body as the onyx skin melted away, leaving behind a blackened husk of a skeleton with large, misshapen extremities.\n\n\"How the //hell// do I explain this to them.. to //you//..\" Johnny's father sighed loudly as he began talking to himself, pacing back and forth.\n\nAn idea for a response formed in Johnny's head as he finally stood up with great effort. \"Dad... is that an, uh, infohazard?\"\n\nJohnny's father stopped, turning to his son with an incredibly confused look, his nose wrinkling as he narrowed his eyes in confusion. \"No, that's not an info— how the //hell// do you know what those are? Oh, jeez...\"\n\n\"//He// taught me.\" Johnny gestured to the corpse. \"And he gave me some pills that helped.\"\n\nHe saw his father roll his eyes and shoulders as he gave a loud, extended sigh. \"//Pills//? From online?!\" He shook his head. \"Like I said, Johnny... you should've just hired a damn //tutor//. Not a goddamn anomalous //fiend// from online.\"\n\nThe sound of a car approaching and parking in their driveway caused Johnny's father to lose focus and turn to the window. \"Sounds like my coworkers are here. Wait here. Everything will be normal soon.\"\n\n\"Wait, what do you mean—\" Johnny's voice trailed off as his father completely ignored his pleas, exiting the house. He peered over at the smoking body of Clethos for a split second, grimacing at the gruesome sight one last time, before crawling to the window.\n\nOutside, his ectoplasm-spattered father was standing beside a white van bickering with a bespectacled man in a pristine white labcoat, with two men in blue jumpsuits and respirators close by inspecting a trail of darkness leading up to their front porch. The men in jumpsuits were also spraying some hazy aerosol around the place from strange machines they wore like backpacks. \n\nThe area was already being cordoned off by yellow caution tape by two more men in blue jumpsuits and respirators, but, otherwise, the world moved on as if nothing was going on. \n\n//What.. the.. fuck?//\n\nHis mind was going in circles as his vision went fuzzy again. As the haze approached the house, he felt memories swap and shift around in his head. The raid sessions with Brick and Astro, the lectures with Clethos, and the clarity he felt when taking the Forbidden Fruit pills... all were forgotten in seconds much like the details to a dream that he'd just had the night before.\n\nJohnny struggled to stay focused as he assessed the situation in the driveway and front yard, trying to make sense of the bizarre scene before him.\n\nThen, he saw it.\n\nHis focus was now on the nondescript white van his father and the man in the labcoat were conversing beside. Rather, he'd //thought// it was nondescript. \n\nIn reality, the two men were standing beside a large black insignia on the side of the van: one inner circle was surrounded a larger, outer circle. A broom, mop, and vacuum cleaner were positioned around the inner circle, the head of each cleaning tool pointed inwards...\n\n...and right before his vision went blurry again, he saw the name on the van: **Sasha's Cleaning Products**.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** catdanse.jpg\n> **Name:** \"funny-dancing-cats\"\n> **Author:** roosac\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/93065544@N07/8464141324\n\n> **Filename:** cognitdog.png\n> **Name:** \"Dry biscuits again ?\"\n> **Author:** Elsie esq\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/61132483@N00/3481276250\n\n> **Filename:** johnnypfp.jpg\n> **Name:** Project 365 #215: 030813 Now That's A Brick\n> **Author:** comedy_nose\n> **License:** CC PDM 1.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/23408922@N07/9429653741\n\n> **Filename:** astropfp.jpg\n> **Name:** \"Eclectus Parrot\"\n> **Author:** Bernard Spragg\n> **License:** CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/88123769@N02/17325433132\n\n> **Filename:** brickpfp.jpeg\n> **Name:** \"Clay Woman\"\n> **Author:** Solly Markovitch\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/28280729@N05/2850359352\n\n> **Filename:** clethospfp.jpeg\n> **Name:** \"Clethos Pfp\"\n> **Author:** [[*user MarcusLCrassus]]\n> **License:** N/A\n> **Source Link:** https://i.imgur.com/wVzzTfy.png\n> **Note:** I took this picture in-person and edited it.\n\n> **Filename:** memeticfractal.jpg\n> **Name:** \"Fractal models\"\n> **Author:** kevin dooley\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/12836528@N00/9580809739\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
