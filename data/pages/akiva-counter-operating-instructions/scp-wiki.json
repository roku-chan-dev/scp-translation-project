Akiva radiation refers to fluctuations in the anomalous field responsible for interactions between belief and reality, typically quantified in centiAkiva (cAk). Although this Akiva field does not consist of particles, changes in the field can affect non-anomalous matter and energy, enabling fluctuations in the Akiva field caused by human belief to produce tangible alterations to reality. \n\nFluctuations in the Akiva field can only be produced by sapient entities, primarily humans, although human belief is capable of elevating or depressing the Akiva field around specific objects or locations. Further fluctuations in the Akiva field can be produced by the manifestation of a divine entity. It is unclear whether this increase in Akiva radiation reflects the human belief in the entity that is manifesting, or whether it is due to the divine being's faith in its own abilities.\n\nIt should be noted that a particular kind of belief is required to produce changes in the Akiva field. It is not affected by mere awareness of narratives featuring mythological entities, or by simply acknowledging the existence of another person, and so it appears that perceiving a being as both real and supernatural is required to affect the Akiva field, with the greatest changes occurring when the existence of the entity is regarded as justifying or requiring specific actions. While some refer to these beings as \"gods\" or \"deities\", these terms are not appropriate descriptors for all divine entities, as the veneration of saints, the belief in angels, and the reverence of ancestors also produce fluctuations in the Akiva field, despite these being perceived as theologically distinct from deities. \n\nFervently-held philosophical and political beliefs may also perturb the Akiva field, even when individuals openly profess their atheism. Abstract concepts such as \"justice\" or \"the nation\" can function similarly to divine entities, being non-material yet still compelling concrete action. The most notable example of this phenomenon is the so-called \"Specter of Communism\", which achieved apotheosis during the early 20th Century, but this phenomenon is not unique to any particular political philosophy. The best-studied example of nationalistic sentiment influencing the Akiva field is the American civil religion, which elevates Akiva counts around objects like the US Constitution, and in locations such as Washington, D.C.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n2\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# akiva-counter]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n++ How The Akiva Counter Works\n\nHumans have been aware of divine presence as something that can be sensed since ancient times, but this experience of the numinous could not be numerically quantified until the Paranormal Renaissance in the 19th Century. The earliest thaumometric instruments developed during this period quantified the Akiva field by measuring supernatural manifestations, such as the period of time that olive oil burned for in a menorah, or the rate at which blood flowed from the eyes of a statue of the Virgin Mary. While ingenious in their construction, these primitive Akiva counters were notoriously unreliable outside of their own specific religious context. \n\nIn the 1960s, the recently formed Department of Tactical Theology phased out these older designs, replacing them with Akiva detectors based on [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-brief-explanation-on-demonics | demonics, electronic circuits that summoned and incorporated demons]]]. While a properly calibrated Demonic Detector could much more reliably quantify manifestations of the divine, the demons that made them work were exorcised by high levels of Akiva radiation, and so these devices required frequent repair and recalibration. Greater awareness of the dangers of demonic technology in the 1980s resulted in their replacement by modern Akiva counters, based entirely on non-anomalous scientific principles. \n\nThe N-THEO (New Theological HT,,2A,, Entheogen Organic) line of Akiva Counters were created by a team lead by Foundation biochemist Doctor Gerald Dennison. Although not originally employed by the Department of Tactical Theology, he contacted the department in 1982, proposing a new method for detecting fluctuations in the Akiva field based on recent research into a class of psychedelics known as entheogens, substances which Doctor Dennison had extensive experience with. These drugs, when used as part of religious or shamanic rituals, are capable of inducing altered states of consciousness that aid the perception of the divine. Doctor Dennison hypothesised that the Akiva field affected the affinity of entheogen molecules for receptors within the brain, a theory that was later proven to be correct. \n\nAlthough early designs required cultures of human neurons to be maintained within the device to be exposed to the entheogen mescaline, later versions of the device refined the process. The current model, the N-THEO Gen IV Akiva Counter, utilizes a cartridge containing multiple temperature-controlled chambers, each filled with a mixture of mescaline and recombinantly produced 5-HT,,2A,,, a serotonin receptor modified to produce a detectable fluorescent signal following agonist binding. As an entheogen, mescaline's affinity for the 5-HT,,2A,, serotonin receptor is increased by elevated levels of Akiva radiation. After calibration of the device using relics with known and consistent Akiva counts, the Akiva radiation emitted by other sources can be quantified and digitally recorded based on the detected fluorescence. This enables the ambient Akiva field at any given location to be measured, and also enables the Akiva radiation emitted by individuals and objects to be detected and quantified relative to the background.\n\n[[=]]\n3\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# reference-tables]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n++ Reference Tables\n\nThe following information is intended to enable interpretation of the Akiva counts of locations, individuals and objects. For accurate measurements, a background reading of ambient Akiva radiation should be made in the absence of the individual or object, before repeating the measurement after bringing the individual or object into the room. While Akiva radiation is generally only detectable in the immediate vicinity of a person or object, higher than expected values will be recorded if large numbers of believers or objects with religious significance are in the same room. For optimal performance, measurements should be made under controlled conditions in a secular setting.\n\nAkiva counts cannot go below zero, as this represents a complete absence of divine presence, although certain entities and objects can bring the value very close to zero. \n\n@@ @@\n\n[[# ambient-akiva]]\n\n++ Ambient Akiva\n\nBefore attempting to assess the effect of an individual or object on the Akiva field, it is essential to first quantify the background level of Akiva radiation in the location that the measurement is to be made in. While the Akiva field is primarily affected by the presence of believers or objects of religious significance, elevated levels of Akiva radiation are detectable in places of worship, even if all worshippers and religious symbols are removed. \n\nTo accurately assess a building's ambient level of Akiva radiation when unoccupied, multiple measurements should in taken in locations throughout the building, as prominent places such as the pulpit of a church or the minaret of a mosque will have notably higher readings than the rest of the building. \n\n||~ Rating (centiAkiva) ||~ Location ||  \n|| 0 || [[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spikebrennan-s-proposal REDACTED]] ||\n|| 0.01-5 || Desolate, profane, or desecrated space ||\n|| 5-15 || Typical background level in a secular environment ||\n|| 15-25 || Former place of worship ||\n|| 25-75 || Place of worship in regular use  ||\n|| 75-99 || Site of pilgrimage ||\n|| >99 || Focal point of a major world religion ||\n\n[[=]]\n4\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nThe exact level of ambient Akiva radiation in a place of worship is affected by the number of worshippers that regularly meet there, their average level of piety, and the length of time that the location has been in use for. Higher Akiva readings are detected at sites that have a history of spiritual significance to people who do not regularly attend, such as the cathedrals and monasteries that pilgrims travel to. The highest levels of ambient Akiva radiation can be detected at the focal points of major world religions, such as Mecca, Jerusalem, and Vatican City.\n\nThe Akiva reading of a place of worship will decrease if the location is no longer regularly used, with the definition of regular use being at least partially dependent on the religious sect utilizing it. Even if a building is formally deconsecrated and repurposed for a secular function, Akiva radiation within it will remain elevated as long as the location is recognizable as a former place of worship.\n\nOutside of places of worship, Akiva levels in secular environments vary based on human population density and the general level of religious observance, although there are remote and sparely populated regions with unexpectedly high levels of Akiva radiation.  Experiments performed by unmanned probes sent into outer space have determined that the Akiva Field has a [[[scp-3570| cosmic background constant]]] of 0.07 centiAkiva, and so Akiva counts will not get lower than this value except through anomalous means. Akiva levels below 5 centiAkiva are associated with a palpable sense of \"divine absence\", and include remote and inhospitable environments, former crime scenes, and most Foundation Facilities.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n5\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# akiva-individuals]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n++ Individual Akiva Emissions\n\nAkiva readings of individuals correspond to rankings on the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-475 |Brandon-Spencer Piety Scale]]], with higher Akiva readings correlating with a greater willingness to make decisions based on faith in the supernatural.

Involvement with organized religion correlates with, but is not necessary for, an elevated Akiva count. Although formal recognition as a religious leader typically corresponds to an higher Akiva reading, this is not universally true, and Akiva counts provide a more accurate measurement of piety than self-reported religious observance. \n\nIndividual Akiva levels will be affected when within a place of worship, increasing or decreasing the ambient Akiva field. Since Akiva readings are made relative to the background level, for accurate and consistent results individual Akiva readings should be made within a secular setting (<20 centiAkiva).\n\n||~ Rating relative to background (centiAkiva) ||~ Individual ||  \n|| <0 || Antithetical to ambient Akiva ||\n|| 0-5 || Non-human animal with no perceived religious significance ||\n|| 1-25 || Non-religious individual ||\n|| 25-50 || Non-practicing believer ||\n|| 50-89 || Regularly practicing believer  ||\n|| 90-134 || Notably pious believer, religious leader ||\n|| 135-159 || Devout religious leader ||\n|| 160-199 || Prophet, Saint ||\n|| >200 || Messiah, Demigod, Deity ||\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n6\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nWhile most individuals emit a relatively stable level of Akiva radiation on a day-to-day basis, temporary spikes in Akiva readings are a normal part of religious observance, with individual prayer and contemplation typically resulting in increases of around 15 centiAkiva, and communal religious gatherings may briefly double or even triple an individual's level of piety. Temporary reductions in Akiva readings have also been reported, generally in individuals experiencing a crisis of faith.\n\nWhile attempts have been made to correlate Akiva readings with various psychological measures, it is difficult to generalize. Although exceptionally high Akiva readings are often associated with increased altruism, elevated Akiva readings have also been reported in individuals suffering from grandiose delusions, manic behavior and pathological narcissism.  \n\nAkiva readings close to zero are generally detected around individuals with little or no interest in or engagement with the spiritual, supernatural or divine. When measured within secular settings, individuals with a strong commitment to atheism frequently have a higher Akiva reading than non-practicing believers, and extreme commitment to a secular political ideology has been reported to produce effects on the Akiva field that are indistinguishable from devout religious belief.\n\nSince the Akiva emissions of individuals are quantified relative to the ambient level of Akiva radiation, it is possible for negative values to be registered relative to this background. In religious contexts, a reduction in the Akiva field is typically caused by antithetical belief, a strongly held objection to the religious observance occurring at that place of worship. This may be motivated by an atheistic opposition to all religion, or by a conflicting religious belief that regards the observed practices as heretical or idolatrous.\n\nIn secular settings, a reduction in the ambient Akiva level around an individual is usually only caused by Tartarean entities or certain forms of post-mortem reanimation. These entities can also suppress the Akiva Field within places of worship, but these effects are generally short-lived, since these entities are repelled or destroyed by sufficiently high levels of Akiva radiation. A notable exception is religious contexts in which Tartarean entities are perceived as divine, which enable these beings to increase the ambient Akiva field without being harmed by the emitted Akiva radiation.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n7\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nWhile a high Akiva reading is not anomalous, it is associated with the ability to prophesy accurate information about the past, present and future, perform miraculous healings and probability alterations, and exorcise Tartarean and spectral entities, with further increases in Akiva radiation being detected during these extranormal events. Additionally, the anomalous effects studied and produced by thaumatologists are frequently accompanied by elevated levels of Akiva radiation, and it has been proposed that a certain level of faith is required to perform these anomalous reality alterations. However, this may simply be because thaumaturgy has traditionally been practiced as part of a religious or spiritual tradition, and invocations of deities and spirits continue to be used by many modern practitioners of \"magic\". Ontokinesis has also been associated with elevated levels of Akiva radiation, although usually only when the ontokineticist regards their abilities as a divine gift, or perceives them to be a manifestation of their own divinity. This phenomenon has not been well studied, due to the inherent dangers of reality benders with grandiose delusions. \n\nExceptionally high Akiva readings have been measured around individuals recognized by others as messiahs, demigods and deities, although many of these beings are capable of suppressing their Akiva emissions to the level of a pious human. If travelling incognito, proclamation or recognition of their divine identity will correspond to a dramatic increase in measured Akiva radiation. \n\nThe origin of these divine entities is the subject of ongoing debate, as there is evidence in favor of multiple hypotheses. It has been argued that these beings were [[[scp-3480| once human, but used thaumaturgy or ontokinesis to convince others of their divinity]]]. Others theorize that these beings are extradimensional entities originating from realities with more permissive physical laws, or that they are egregores, [[[scp-6659 | created and sustained by belief in their existence]]], with any miraculous reality alterations occurring in accordance with human expectations.

The values listed below indicate the typical range for different classes of artifact. \n\nAs with individuals, the Akiva emissions of objects should be assessed with an ambient level of Akiva radiation <20 centiAkiva. Compared to measurements taken in a secular context, Akiva readings of the same object within a place of worship may be lower, if the object is only one of many within the building, or higher, if the object is placed at a focal point in the building or is perceived to have particular significance within that place of worship.\n\n||~ Rating relative to background (centiAkiva) ||~ Object||   \n|| <0 || Antithetical to ambient Akiva ||\n|| 0-4 || Inanimate object with no perceived religious significance ||\n|| 5-30 || Object or clothing regularly used as part of a religious ritual ||\n|| 15-60 || Religious scripture or symbol ||\n|| 30-100 || Icon or idol ||\n|| 80-149 || Holy relic ||\n|| >135|| Body of a saint ||\n|| >150 || Major holy relic ||\n\nMeasurements of Akiva radiation made before and after religious services indicate that the use of any object in an act of religious observance gives it at least at some religious significance, but the increase is dependent on how significant the object is perceived to be. While a piece of bread typically has negligible religious significance, its consecration as part of the Eucharist results in an elevated Akiva reading. This increase is greatest and most durable during a Catholic Mass, due to a belief in transubstantiation that is absent from most Protestant sects. Akiva radiation will gradually return to normal levels if an object is discarded or repurposed for secular use.\n\nPareidolia may also elevate the Akiva reading of an inanimate object, with increases in Akiva radiation being detectable around objects that coincidentally resemble religious symbols, such as pieces of bread that are toasted in patterns resembling depictions of the face of Jesus. \n\n[[=]]\n9\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nReligious symbols and scripture tend to have permanently elevated Akiva levels, only returning to baseline levels if the object is destroyed in a manner that leaves it unrecognizable as an object of religious significance. A number of factors determine exactly how much Akiva Radiation is emitted by these objects, including how sacred the physical object is believed to be by the individuals that make use of it. For example, Jewish Torah and Islamic Qu'ran consistently have higher Akiva counts than Christian Bibles produced through identical methods and used with identical frequency, likely due to differing beliefs on the sacral quality of the text itself. \n\nAnalogue or digital recordings of religious symbols, texts, songs or sermons will also result in the storage medium emitting Akiva radiation. If an electronic device is not exclusively used for religious purposes, it will only emit Akiva radiation when displaying or playing religious content.\n\nConsistently high Akiva readings are detected around objects officially recognized as holy relics, such as the bones of saints and fragments of the True Cross, making these objects useful for the calibration of Akiva counters. Whether claims made about these objects are actually true does not appear to be important, as carbon dating confirms that none of the fragments of the True Cross used by the Foundation to calibrate Akiva counters actually existed at the time of Jesus of Nazareth's death. \n\nThe highest Akiva counts are measured around holy relics that are explicitly mentioned in religious scripture. The exact Akiva counts of objects such as the Kaaba are difficult to quantify, because their surroundings are also regarded as holy, and there are few opportunities to transport major holy relics to a laboratory for study in a secular environment.\n\nIt is possible for a holy relic to suppress rather than enhance the Akiva field, if brought into a place of worship with an antithetical source of Akiva radiation. This effect is most apparent if a religious icon is brought into a place of worship used by an iconoclastic sect that regards any depiction of divine entities as blasphemous. Suppression of the Akiva field within places of worship has also been observed with certain objects of atheistic significance, such as [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4519 | SCP-4519]]]. Additionally, a small number of \"unholy relics\" have been documented, usually associated with diabolism.
