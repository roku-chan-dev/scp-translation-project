LCD displays are to constantly stream reality TV programs, and triple-wide ventilation systems are to diffuse various perfumes in one-hour intervals.\n\n**Addendum-7097-1 (01-27-2023):** A minimum of --two-- 250,000 live female Drosophila specimens are to be contained near SCP-7097's cell.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7097 is a sapient entity that inhabits female members of the Drosophila genus,[[footnote]]Commonly known as fruit flies.[[/footnote]] and has a strong proclivity for learning and/or sharing personal secrets.\n\nSCP-7097 will inhabit the nearest suitable Drosophila specimen after dying, with no noticeable change in personality or mannerisms. The entity is fully aware of this and may attempt breach-by-suicide if insufficiently entertained. If sufficiently entertained, SCP-7097 will become dormant and unresponsive.\n \nSCP-7097 has an innate sense for secrets, which testing determined is a form of anomalous olfactory detection. SCP-7097 often utilizes this sense during communication, and it has been known to make unsolicited remarks about Foundation staff and/or initiate games such as truth or dare.\n _\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interaction Log Two\" hide=\"- Interaction Log Two\"]]\n**Foreword:** As SCP-7097 neared the end of its natural one-month lifespan, Dr. Mendoza instructed Dr. Kelly and Dr. Landstrom to procure two Drosophila specimens suitable for containment purposes.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[Video & Audio Log, 12:24 hours]**\n\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Alright, the jars are secure.\n _\n**SCP-7097:** Oooh, I don't feel so good you guys.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly [whispering]:** Couldn't we at least give her some painkillers?\n _\n**Dr. Mendoza [muttering]:** Waste of Foundation resources.\n _\n//SCP-7097 expires.

I like to mix it up every day, but most people don't even notice. Just you and Cassidy, funnily enough.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You mean the skip?\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Yeah, she always remembered little things like that. //[sighs]// And she always had something nice to say when I visited.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Interesting, for a common Drosophila specimen to have a memory that strong is quite atypical. I'll have to add a note about this in my insect compendi- OW!\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Can it with the nerd-speak //genius,// or I'll yank another hair.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Are you alright?  \n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Yes, just a little headache is all. You were saying about Cassidy?\n _\n//Dr. Kelly is silent for several seconds.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** I feel sorry for her.\n _\n**Dr Landstrom:** You //what?//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly [flustered]:** I mean, how would you like it if you were forced to live in a prison without any true friends? We treat her like some monster, but all she wants to do is... live a normal life. \n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** It has you, doesn't it? How can you say you're not a true friend when you visited that thing practically every day?\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** //[sighs]// I made a promise to her, and then left her alone when she needed me most. I really liked spending time with Cassidy, but when push came to shove I was more worried about keeping my job than keeping my word.\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** She really //did// care...\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** I just wish I could make things right with Cassidy somehow, but every time I ask-\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom laughs hysterically.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Huh?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //[laughing]// It's not- //[hunches over from laughing]// -I can't...\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** I'm being serious here!\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom makes his way to the nearest bathroom, laughing along the way.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** What the hell? The deal was for you to help me hold a conversation, not tickle my scalp when we're having a moment!\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom takes off his hat, revealing the entity.//\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Hey, I needed to get your attention somehow!\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** And what was so important you had to embarrass me like that?\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Listen, I need you to bring Dr. Kelly here. It's about the only place where the cameras won't be watching,[[footnote]]SCP-7097 was wrong about that.[[/footnote]] and-\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You want me to bring a //woman// into the //men's restroom?!?//\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Well it sounds pervy when you put it //that// way.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [blushing]:** It //is// pervy! \n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Just tell her there's something in here you need to show her. She'll trust you, I'm sure of-\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //[head in hands]// Do you have any idea how that //sounds?// \n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** I promise I'll make it up to you, alright?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** //[pauses]// No.\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** C'mon, I'm not asking for that-\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I have a better idea.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom returns to the cafeteria. Dr. Kelly is by herself.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** There you are! What happened?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Oh, uh... indigestion.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Indigestion that made you laugh hysterically?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [sheepish]:** Yep.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** //[raises one eyebrow]// ...Anyways, I just wish I could apologize to Cassidy. She deserves to be treated like a person, instead of being locked up in a cell all by herself.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** You want to //apologize// to a Keter-class anomaly?\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** Whose side are you even //on?//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly [chuckling]:** Now you sound like Dr. Mendoza.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [chuckling]:** Hey, those are fighting words! \n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Seriously though, I wish Vera could see Cassidy as more than just a problem to be locked away.\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Or, you know, that Dr. Mendoza would smile and act like a //normal human// once in a blue moon.\n _\n//Dr. Kelly laughs.//\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom finishes his meal and gets up.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Well, erm, see ya.\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** See you later.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom begins walking away from the table.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Oh, and one more thing Mike...\n _\n//Dr. Kelly pauses for a moment.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** I like this side of you. You should show it more often.\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom leaves, before wincing in pain.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [muttering]:** Alright, alright! I'll tell her, just stop yanking my hair follicles!\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** Grace, would you, erm, mind trying on this hat for a sec?\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** Uh, sure?\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom:** I just think it would really complement your hairstyle and-\n _\n**SCP-7097 [whispering]:** //This// is what you call a //better// idea?\n _\n//Dr. Landstrom takes the Metallica hat off and passes it toward Dr. Kelly.//\n _\n**Dr. Kelly:** What a day...\n _\n//Dr. Kelly receives the hat but is interrupted by Foundation security agents before she can put it on. Both researchers, the entity, and numerous nearby staff members are incapacitated via sonic attack.//\n _\n**Dr. Landstrom [barely conscious]:** Tell... me... about... it...\n _\n[[/div]]\n _\n**Closing Statement:** The entity was re-contained in a quarantine cell following this incident, and Dr. Landstrom had to be detained with it due to unintended consequences of re-containment. A request was filed by Dr. Kelly to release Dr. Landstrom and allow SCP-7097 out of its cell periodically.\n _\n**Request denied.**\n//-Dr. Mendoza//\n _\n[[/collapsible]]\n _\n\n= [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7097/offset/2|ACCESS UPDATED DOCUMENTATION]]]\n _",
