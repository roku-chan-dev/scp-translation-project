Certain contained anomalies are capable of such probability manipulation, proving it to be possible and capable of directly affecting Foundation operations. \n\n**METHOD:** The primary focus of Project Loaded Dice is the study, utilization, and replication of anomalies capable of altering probability or luck. Research Area-8 is to be established within 250 kilometers of Site-01. The research and experimentation involved in Project Loaded Dice are to take place exclusively at this area. Temporary housing and containment facilities are to be built for all personnel, humanoid anomalies, and objects used in the project. A substantial budget is to be at the project’s disposal until its success or failure as deemed by the O5 Council.

In the time since her appointment six months ago, we have noticed an unusual and alarming rise in the number of incidents the Foundation has experienced. Below are some of the statistics our various departments have reported:\n* 65% increase in the number of successful D-Class escapes,\n* 27% increase in the number of incidents involving anomalies in containment,\n* 5.3% decrease in site efficiency,\n* █ Euclid/Keter class anomalies breaching containment since appointment,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Most of which were approved for cross-testing by O5-7 or per O5-7's precedent.[[/span]]\n* Neutralization of █ probability-affecting anomalies.\n* ██ personnel injuries higher than average,\n* No change in personnel’s adherence to protocol.\n\nAdditionally, the destruction of Research Area-██, resulting in ██ personnel being terminated, is still fresh in our minds. An investigation into the incident found the cause to be a shipment of bad concrete which went unnoticed for █ years. This is an extremely rare occurrence for an organization as thorough as ours.\n\nA majority, if not all, of the incidents were caused by random chance or “bad luck.” While we do not have any direct evidence, we suspect that the Foundation’s recently poor performance is due to sabotage on O5-7’s part. The correlation between her appointment and the start of these incidents is just too blatant to be written off as coincidence. As such, we are urgently calling for her removal from the council as her current position is a detriment to the Foundation. We hope you take our concerns seriously.\n\n@@ @@\n++ __//Sophie Gray//__\nChairwoman of the Containment Committee\n\n++ __//Illya Vitalijovych Pavlov//__\nHead of the Department of Health and Security\n\n++ __//Jewel Jayde Morales//__\nHead of the Department of Internal Affairs\n\n++ __//Noe Young-Soo//__\nHead of Logistics and Foundation Asset Management for Site-19\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n[[=]]\n= **ADDENDUM 7771.11:** Overseer Conference on 17/12/2005\n------\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n{{[17/12/2005]}}\n\n**PARTIES PRESENT:**\n* Overseer Council (sans O5-7)\n\n**FOREWORD:** In response to the official complaint from four department heads regarding effects on Foundation activities possibly caused by O5-7, an emergency session of the O5 Council sans O5-7 was called to discuss potential courses of action. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>**\n-----\n= //<Twelve of the council members are seated in Site-01’s main meeting room.>//\n\n**O5-1:** I’m sure you have all seen the memo sent to us by multiple department heads.\n\n**O5-5:** This is ridiculous.\n\n**O5-12:** I have to agree with Five.\n\n**O5-13:** Of course you would!

All personnel are accounted for and sent to Site-██ for reassignment and amnesticization. Fireteam BETA secures all physical project materials, documents, and anomalies for extraction.\n\nAt 11:00 AM, all present Overseers save for O5-1, -7, and -13 discreetly exit Site-01 with MTF Alpha-1 (“Red Right Hand”) escort, while O5-1 and -13 enter the secure bunker and seal it behind them. O5-7 is not notified of either event. At 11:07 AM, an unannounced sitewide lockdown is initiated. At 11:12 AM, MTF Omega-1 Fireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12 (“Achilles’ Heels”) enter Site-01 with orders to intercept and terminate O5-7[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Onsite Kant counters reported the local Hume level suddenly rising by ~20 Hm at this moment before dissipating to normal.[[/span]]. Onsite elements of MTF Alpha-1 are ordered to protect the bunker exclusively and to not engage with other personnel. At this time, O5-7 remains in her office, not notified of the lockdown or arrival of Mobile Task Forces.\n\nAt 11:18 AM, MTF Omega-1 secures the camera control room. One member of Omega-1 is injured by a falling ceiling tile. No cause apparent. MTF Omega-1 reports seven additional injuries resulting from accidents and improbable occurrences, such as falling bricks, broken bones from slipping, and others. Zero recorded fatalities.\n\nAt 11:23 AM, simultaneous containment breaches are reported at Sites-06-3, -17, and -19. MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) is mobilized to respond to these breaches. Presumed related to ongoing action at Site-01. By order of O5-2 and -9, half of onsite MTF Omega-12 personnel are reassigned to guard the Overseers from potential ontokinetic attack. Fireteam ALPHA and remaining MTF Omega-12 personnel continue into Site-01.\n\nFireteam ALPHA and MTF Omega-12, now ███ feet from O5-7’s location, approach the hallway containing the Overseer’s office. As they round the corner, all members of MTF Omega-12 simultaneously complain of dizziness, nausea, and severe headaches. All members collapse within minutes, with Fireteam ALPHA unable to revive them. Medical team dispatched to their location. Fireteam ALPHA is ordered to continue into the site by COMMAND, with assistance affirmed by several nearby Mobile Task Forces.\n\nAt 11:28 AM, Fireteam ALPHA assembles outside of O5-7’s office, who remains typing at a terminal. At this time, Site-01 experiences an electrical blackout, with backup generators failing to power more than the Site’s terminals and database. Fireteam ALPHA don night vision goggles and attempt to shoot O5-7 through the wall, but all provided weapons malfunction. As Fireteam ALPHA troubleshoots their weapons, several negligent discharges occur which strike other personnel. Only one member is left unharmed. O5-7 is unharmed. Full power is restored to the facility, which temporarily blinds the single member of Fireteam ALPHA. As they recover, the single member of Fireteam ALPHA enters the office to terminate O5-7. However, a weapon malfunction (presumably caused by an incomplete discharge) causes the member’s firearm to explode. This injures the member, resulting in significant damage to the hands and bleeding. \n\nThe single active member of Fireteam ALPHA attempts to engage O5-7 with a knife. O5-7 unharmed. Surviving member's vital signs destabilizing; presumed incapacitated. \n\nFurther support from nearby Mobile Task Forces, including MTF Alpha-1 and Omega-12, are en route.\n\n**//THE CURRENT SITUATION IS ONGOING.
