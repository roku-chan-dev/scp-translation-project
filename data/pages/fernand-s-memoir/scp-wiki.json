Instead of asking for clothes like it usually does, it asked for a set of books. Specifically, it asked for books of poetry, as well as an issue of //Oxford Dictionary and Thesaurus//. SCP-082 has also asked for a stack of paper, along with a quill. All requests have been approved, and the materials should arrive by tomorrow morning. Since its request, SCP-082 has refused all food and water, and sits quietly in its chamber. Quite peculiar behavior for a skip so amiable...Well, as amiable as an 8 foot cannibal can be.\n\n> **10.28.2016:** Ever since SCP-082 has gotten those books, it's been reading and writing nonstop. I've been surveying it for five hours and it hasn't taken a single break. It has used up three full stacks of paper already, most of which is crumpled on the floor. What the hell is it up to?\n\n> **10.31.2016:** I have never seen 082 this happy before. When I came into my shift this morning, it was still writing. It's been listening to more upbeat music and I saw it dancing to some of the tunes. If someone told me that I would spend my day watching a 700 pound cannibal dance like a ballerina, while writing poetry, and humming to Chopin, I'd laugh in their face. \n\n> **11.3.2016:** Still writing. It's still writing. Over the past few days, it's gone through ten stacks of paper. Well, I guess this is better than eating off the heads of the D-class. \n> \n> 082 spoke to me today. It said that it wished to read me a piece of poetry that it wrote. Oddly, it seemed quite genuine with its emotion. I told it that it could read it to me tomorrow, as it was 11 at night, and I needed to go to bed. 082 seemed alright with it, and I headed home. What the hell did I get myself into?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Audio Log 082-A\" hide=\"Audio Log 082-A:\"]]\n\n**Foreword: The following is an interview of SCP-082 by Dr. Bernstein, head of SCP-082's containment.**\n\n> [BEGIN LOG (11.4.2016)]\n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** What exactly did you want to show us, 082?\n> \n> **SCP-082:** It is a piece of literature that I have written. I'm quite proud of it. \n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** *sigh* Alright then. Go ahead, 082.\n> \n> **SCP-082:** One moment please. I just need to reorganize my pages. (papers rustling) My apologies. I'm not normally this flustered...I'm ready.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** Any time, 082.\n> \n> **SCP-082:** Here we go. And--and do be warned. This is the first piece of poetry I have written. It will not be perfect.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** I'm sure it's fine 082. Go on and read it.\n> \n> **SCP-082:** Alright. Here we go. (clears throat)\n> \n> In the dank, deep depths of the dark alleyway,\n> Where no man can see the light of day,\n> There stood a boy wearing tattered attire,\n> And, in the corner, a small campfire.\n> With rags as a sleeping mat, and a box for a house,\n> And laying there, quiet as a mouse,\n> The boy knew not to make any sound,\n> For he knew what would happen if he were to be found.\n> \n> While sleeping in his cot, the boy slept well,\n> And felt, as a whole, rather swell.\n> The boy woke the next morning, hearing a shout,\n> And from his cot, he began to sprout.\n> Looking to the light, he saw a figure,\n> Though its full shape, he could not configure.\n> Two more entered sight, all were a blur.\n> Should the boy run? He was unsure.\n> \n> The figures came charging at a rapid motion,\n> Nothing could be heard over the commotion.\n> They grabbed the boys limbs, and pulled him madly,\n> The boy had to flee, but he could not, sadly.\n> Trapped by the figures, he was unable to walk,\n> With a cloth over his mouth, he was unable to talk.\n> With a thump on the head, his world became dark,\n> And along with the men, they disembarked.\n> \n> With a groggy grunt, the boy awoke with tears,\n> He was locked in a cage, the worst of his fears.\n> Draped in red, he could not see,\n> With bars of steel, he could not flee.\n> There was a rustle, then a light so bright,\n> The boy had almost lost his sight.\n> Then, a man, with a twinkle in his eye\n> Grabbed a cane and top hat, then began to outcry:\n> \n> \"Ladies and gentlemen, children of any age!\n> Allow me to show you what is in this cage.\n> Around the world, I've travelled, sea to sea,\n> And I have brought a gift for thee to see.\n> Be warned, you may run crying in fear,\n> And this gift may also cause you to tear.\n> But fret not, my dears, for it will cause no harm\n> For if he does, I'll cut off his arm!\"\n> \n> \"This great, hefty beast has arms so strong,\n> That he could cut down trees all year long.\n> Yes, it's true, this beast has some muscle,\n> He could certainly proclaim victory in any tussle.\n> But folks, if you will have a look at this creature!\n> We must not neglect his most prominent feature.\n> With jaws of steel, and teeth so bright,\n> This creature's smile could light up the night!\"\n> \n> The man turned to the boy, scowl on his face,\n> He whispered, \"Come on, beast, pick up the pace!\n> Your audience is waiting, give em' a show!\"\n> The man took the cane, then delivered a blow.\n> The boy shook with fear, not knowing what to do,\n> The audience before him began to boo.\n> With one last breath that reeked of bile,\n> The boy stood tall, and then, he smiled.\n> \n> Cheers, cheers! Cheers all around!\n> Not a single frown was able to be found.\n> The man stepped forward, and said, \"How about that?\"\n> The crowd before him threw coins in his hat.\n> The man was rich, all thanks to the boy.\n> \"Perhaps,\" the man thought, \"there is more use for this toy\"\n> Then the man reached into a pocket in his back,\n> He pulled out a whip, and let out a //crack.//\n> \n> Blood cre--...blood...uh...\n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** Are you alright, 082?\n> \n> **SCP-082:** Yes...yes of course. Where was I? Oh yes:\n> \n> Blood crept down the boy's back, as thick as molasses.\n> Brought to his knees, right before the masses.\n> The boy let out a roar, all could hear.\n> The crowd shrieked, then ran in fear.\n> The man chuckled, and looked at the boy,\n> Then said, \"Oh come now, don't be so coy.\n> From here on out, I'll be your guide.\n> And, together, we shall travel far and wide!\"\n> \n> Days passed like months, and months like years.\n> Each day he was alive, he bathed in tears.\n> Was this his place, his final destination?\n> Is this life his only true application?\n> Whatever questions he asked, no one answered the boy.\n> For what was he if he not a toy?\n> It took many years, and much contemplation,\n> But at last, the boy received an explanation.\n> \n> In the crypts of his mind, there came a voice.\n> This voice allowed the poor boy a choice.\n> Shall he remain in his cage, filled with dejection?\n> Or shall he get revenge with divine retaliation?\n> The boy stared at his thousands of scars,\n> Then brought his attention to the light of the stars.\n> In order to escape, the boy needed a plan,\n> But most of all, he must become a man.\n> \n> It was the last day of the tour, the final show\n> What would happen? The boy did not know.\n> The man in the hat came out from the back.\n> He took out his whip, then gave another crack.\n> Still locked in his cage, the boy could not fight.\n> All he could do was shake with fright.\n> The man just chuckled, not giving a care.\n> He grabbed his cane, and gave one last declare:\n> \n> \"Now folks, hear me, as I tell you my feat!\n> I stand here, offering you all a treat.\n> After many years of teaching and rehabilitation,\n> I present this beast to the entire nation!\n> For he is no longer a beast, no longer so cruel,\n> And with my teachings, he is now my mule.\n> Don't believe me, you say? Need I show you?\"\n> The man then unlocked the cage, and out the door flew.\n> \n> Slowly, the boy inched from his crib,\n> To encourage him, the man jabbed him in the rib.\n> Picking up the pace, the boy made it out,\n> The audience before him let out a shout.\n> \"Beast!\" they called him. \"Abomination!\" they cried,\n> The boy could not smile, no matter how much he tried.\n> The man beside him, with eyes full of rage,\n> Shouted at the boy, while hitting the cage.\n> \n> \"Come on, my boy! What are you doing?\n> Can you not see that the audience is booing?\n> After all these years, and all of this time,\n> Now is when you decide to begrime?\n> Show them your power, show them your might!\n> For I know that you're human, just ever so slight.\n> Show them how a beast like you does no harm.\n> For if you don't, I will saw off your arm!\"\n> \n> The boy stood still, unable to move.\n> He could not find his internal groove.\n> The crypts of his mind internally froze,\n> Then suddenly, in front of him, a shadow arose.\n> The shadow engulfed the boy, entrapped his soul,\n> Then slowly and quietly, it began to cajole.\n> Finally, the boy knew what must be done,\n> And chuckled to himself, \"Let's have some fun.\"\n> \n> The boy grabbed his captor, and held him tight.\n> He stared into his eyes, and saw the fright.\n> As the boy lifted the man, the man screamed in fear.\n> From his left eye, the boy saw him tear. \n> The boy did not care, he had no remorse,\n> For he knew that this man was truly so coarse.\n> The boy opened his jaws, and placed the man inside.\n> And though it was muffled, the man still cried.\n> \n> He squirmed in his mouth, as the boy began to munch,\n> Then he grew limp with one final **CRUNCH**.\n> \n> //(SCP-082 is silent for a minute, and then continues)//\n> \n> Blood gushed in the boy's mouth, it was quite a sight.\n> Still, unrelenting, the boy held on tight.\n> For he was no longer a boy, much more vicious and malicious.\n> As he devoured the man's flesh, he whispered, \"How delicious.\"\n> Still wanting more, he turned to the crowd,\n> Who had already started running and screaming aloud.\n> The beast chased after, grabbing a few.\n> He ripped off their arms, then began to chew.\n> \n> After those few, he grabbed some more.\n> He ripped out their entrails, which leaked on the floor.\n> After those meals, he ran to the street.\n> He feasted on those with livers so sweet.\n> In the corner of his eye, he saw a young man,\n> With a pair of ripped trousers, and a gun in his hand.\n> Though he tried to take on the beast,\n> It was upon his corpse that the beast would feast.\n> \n> But before the beast could go any more,\n> He took a look down, and stared at the gore,\n> For this boy was like him, alone and afraid,\n> With no one else who would give him aid.\n> The beast was now alone, blood creeping in his scars,\n> No one could see him except for the stars.\n> With much shame, the beast fled the scene,\n> For he did not know how he could be this obscene.\n> \n> He took shelter in the woods, unable to cope\n> With the actions he made; he was out of hope.\n> He washed himself in a nearby river,\n> Scraping off the remnants of the young man's liver.\n> He grabbed some leaves, and then some sticks,\n> Then made a small cot, in which he affixed\n> A small drape for a door, and some leaves that were dead,\n> This was the only things the beast could call his bed.\n> \n> //(SCP-082 begins to tear, but continues to speak)//\n> \n> After the night passed, he awoke in a room,\n> With many bright lights, and a mood so gloom.\n> There were people above, staring at the aberration.\n> The creature then knew the reality of the situation.\n> His life flashed again, all of the pain,\n> All the creature could do was exclaim.\n> For he was again alone, with nothing to do.\n> Then, a voice from above said, \"Hello, 082.\"\n> \n> //(SCP-082 breaks down into a fit of crying)//\n> \n> **Dr. Bernstein:** Is that...is that all 082?\n> \n> **SCP-082:** (sniffs) Yes...yes that is all. Thank you for your time.\n> \n> //(SCP-082 travels to the corner of the containment chamber and sits, facing the wall)//\n> \n> [END LOG]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
