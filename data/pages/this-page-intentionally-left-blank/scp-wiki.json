For that reason my articles so far have absurdly-long edit histories as I keep thinking of better ways to say things which were already said perfectly acceptably weeks ago.\n\nI also adore all of you.

How many years of being screamed at by a mirror monster can you take before it all gets a bit... samey? Less than eighteen, apparently. The concept came to me as I lay in bed reading the site and asking myself \"So, got any ideas, since you're so damn smart?\" I hadn't even been thinking that I was so damn smart, so that was pretty rude.\n\n**Assessment:** My first SCP, and it //didn't// get deleted! I mean, it came close, but it got better. Literally. Literarily? And that's a good thing, 'cuz it sets up Site-43 and teases SCP-5243. \n\nThere's a tie-in tale, as outlined below; [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-significant-others-part-a both] [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-significant-others-part-b halves] are up. \n\nIf you haven't seen this article since it was first posted, it might be worth another glance... it's been through a lot, and come out quite profitably scathed.

I wanted a story where the researchers were the real anomaly — how much mischief could they get up to with this phrase, and how could I convey that without it becoming SCP-050 or some other lolFoundation thing? I wanted to create a whole series of short literary Rube Goldberg devices, microstories whirring with their own bizarre internal logic which only this specific plot device could enable. I ended up covering way more bases than I thought I could.\n\n**Assessment:** So, apparently this clicks with most people! I am deeply gratified that you didn't think it was stupid, and the affirmation has been wholly uplifting. (Definitely go downvote it if you think it's stupid, though, because what's it doing there, being stupid? I mean what the fuck.)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #F5D8E0; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px\"]]\n\"The Breach that Keeps On Breaching\"\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\n**Item #:** [[[SCP-5243]]]\n\n**Object Lesson:** Where does all that ectoplasm go, anyway?\n\n**Special Quotation Procedures:** \"I wish this goddamn anomaly didn't have my forwarding address.\"\n\n**Dissection:** A magic sewer explosion is bad. A magic sewer explosion that happens every year, and forces you to roleplay as your past self, and changes history if you do it wrong, is //hilariously// bad. I've been building to this idea for a while, now, and it was a lot of fun executing. Especially the Provisional Task Force idea, and its logo, which came late in the game. Oh, and all those ridiculous pictures. Clinical descriptions of magical shenanigans are a hoot.\n\n**Assessment:** Went from a 15k-word magnum opus to a 2.7k-word bonum opus.

I prefer to think of it as a celebration of the communal writing process. Things that don't work get ejected from the canons over time, and we can appreciate the intent behind them without wanting them to come back.\n\nIt's also a celebration of dumb dialogue jokes that I thought were funny at various fours in the various morning.

There were a lot of rewrites, but the core of the article remains what it was when I hammered it out initially: a furious rebuke of the Canadian federal government's policy towards the First Nations, within a vicious swipe against cultural appropriation, within a story about panthers consuming people on a lake. I did my research and made sure to get the details right, because if done correctly this could be, I think, a nice gesture to thousands of people who have deserved better than they got... but if done incorrectly it could contribute to the problems it's trying to tackle.\n\nI //hope// it was done correctly.\n\nI really piled on the historical injustices here. There were just so many to choose from! I didn't have to make any of them up. Hopefully there's some catharsis in this story, but not so much catharsis that the wrongs committed against the First Peoples appear to have been righted. They most certainly have not, and some tentative further reading is linked in my author post if you want to be a small part of the solution yourself.\n\n**Assessment:** Seems to have been done correctly!

I didn't know //why// Rydderech disappeared when I first created him, and I first created him a long time ago (for my only-recently-published Site Dossier for Site-43). For a while I thought he was going to mess around with some indigenous water purification spirit and get burned, and then my training kicked in and I realized how awful that would be. I think it might be that which prompted my previous skip about not stealing indigenous culture!\n\nPlease be kind to the elderly. Take care of them.

Every scene was written by nick first, and then I did a do-over in my own style. I did contribute the image myself, and I'm proud of that. I'm proud of the whole thing, really, I think it's sweet and cute and dumb and fun and more than a little bit sad.\n\nI had a birthday party at Chuck E. Cheese's when I was a little kid, and I have only a few, remarkably vivid, images of it. The animatronics in the far distance, on the stage, being weird; the dim lighting; arcade machines that took tokens... man, I think I still have one of those somewhere... and the ball pit. \n\nThere was no puke in the ball pit.

This one came to me as a pretty pure concept: a set of instructions for what to do when you're in the bad future, and the good guys set right what once went wrong, and your bad future is about to collapse... and the twist is, that's happening RIGHT NOW, and the reader is IN the bad future, and when they refresh the page... their reality has been deleted. I was super pumped about the idea, which is bad, because I get more terrified to share an idea the better I think it is. So I put a lot, a lot, a //lot// of time and effort into making it into something extremely short and punchy that still had characters, detail, and interest. Nothing extraneous, a few chilling lines, and a use of ACS in the second iteration that even the haters have to admit adds something to the proceedings. Tell me that series of \"N/A\" doesn't do //anything// for you. Okay, actually, don't tell me that. It'll make me sad.\n\nOh, yes, by the by, this is technically a Site-43 thing. It's also a Foundation-wide thing, but you'll see, some day, that it ties in with some tales I've got in the pipeline. Unfortunately, the pipeline is very, very blocked at the moment.\n\nListpages! [[*user Croquembouche]] and [[*user Rounderhouse]]'s excellent guide carried me through. Holy fuck, was that ever not fun. Nerve-wracking! Even after I had it all figured out on the sandbox, I wasn't sure if I'd be able to get it going properly on the mainsite. I even messed with the format a bit — I always put fun little descriptions in my rating module infobox, and I wanted a different one for each of the two iterations, so I put the modules in the child pages instead of the main page and I've already lost you because nobody really understands listpages so... uh... check out those infoboxes, I think it's a cool gag.\n\n**Assessment:** So far it's getting pretty much the reaction I expected: more often than not, the stark twist at the end works for people. But! About a third of the readers go \"I want a story, this is shallow.\" And they're not wrong to want that, but for once, I wasn't planning on giving them one. This one's about you, with just a bit of a narrative gloss to keep you reading for the punchline. Hopefully it survives, I think it's neat.\n\n**Update:** Unlike all those poor timelines, it will indeed survive. Many thanks.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFDABF; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px\"]]\n\"The Last Word\"\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\n\n**Item #:** [[[SCP-5751]]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=CDR.jpg|\n    caption=Cut content for y'all.|\n    width=175px\n]]\n\n**Object Lesson:** The end is not the end.\n\n**Special Quotation Procedures:** \"You shouldn't be allowed to read SCP files anymore.\"\n\n**Dissection:**  This one took a while. I got the idea early — it was always meant to be a followup to the 5109 format, a log of events that escalate rapidly as a simple anomaly gets used for increasingly bonkers purposes. \n\nI ejected several items from the final list. I was gonna have some \"all cops are bastards\" content with multiple counts of switched-off bodycam footage or intentionally-destroyed evidence resurfacing; it appealed to me politically, but it didn't progress the narrative. I was also going to have more examples of the anomaly doing moralistic work, sometimes going against what we perceive to be present-day morals — having it seem to judge people's proclivities rather more harshly than we might like, judging by the files it chooses to dredge up. Again, though, that wasn't the story I'm telling here. One log was long and detailed and interesting enough (to me, anyway) that I think I'll repurpose it as the inevitable companion tale some ways down the road.\n\nLike the pics? They're mostly of stuff in my own collection. I faked up logos for Ananasoft Inc. and VISUS, did a lot of editing to remove logos for Sony, Memorex, etc., and tried to get a good variety of discs going. That horrific one at the top is a truly ancient CD of mine which has had gaps in the surface covered over with electrical tape and permanent marker, so that a CD-ROM drive wouldn't refuse to read it; I was actually able to salvage all the data from it, using a combination of that method and brushing the bottom with toothpaste and vaseline. Yes, really. Looks fucking horrific, no? Similarly, Bright's busted-up Blu-Ray is a disc that burned badly which I've resultantly been using as a coaster. That's staining from Coke condensation, y'all. Fun stuff.\n\n**Assessment:** Doing well! Rather like its predecessor.

I've been using the esoteric classes with icons in ACS as inspiration, trying to come up with one article for each, and Tiamat... Tiamat was the last one I figured out. Tiamats are Veil-breakers, or, rather, they make //us// break the Veil to fight them. I don't //want// to break the Veil in my stories, any more than I want the world to end in my stories. The Apollyon sorted itself out well enough, but how the fuck was I gonna manage this?\n\nThe answer that came to me was \"make a joke out of it.\" Make the Babylonian goddess Tiamat, and make it so someone keeps editing the class to //be// Tiamat. I was surprised when nobody'd made a Mishipeshu skip, but I was absolutely floored that there were no fucking Tiamats already. I still didn't think this was gonna be great, but I was willing to test out the idea and see if I could make something I was proud of.\n\n...I like it better than the rest of this trilogy. I like it better than my first trilogy. I think it stands up to the three history skips, which are easily my best things. I just really enjoyed how this thing turned out. The banter was fun, the in-jokes were fun, the emotional payoff worked for me. It'll probably come off as cloying or abrupt to some people, but at least a few so far have suggested it went just the way I wanted it to. Really shows you why writing under limitations is a great way to do things.\n\nSo... yeah. That's three trilogies. What next? Three more, I guess.\n\n**Assessment:** I posted it late at night. I'm going to bed in the early morning, and it's at +20 with no downvotes. So... that's certainly something.\n\n**Update:** Then I woke up and it was at +32 with no downvotes so I guess we're on the same page?\n\n**Another Update:** +56 in two days.

What if one of my characters pretended to have access to a device that allowed him to speak to past versions of himself, and this let him use multiple copies of an anomaly otherwise contained in his brain alone? I actually never intended the device to //work//; I wanted it to be the cover story for an even wackier series of explanations, which is still actually the plan for when I (finally) finish those tales. But when I decided, quite reasonably, that Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate was the most likely candidate for having invented this fake machine, well, things took a turn for the productively strange.\n\nI told Place himself, and he called me on Discord to rant and rave and brainstorm for several hours. By the time that first call was over, we had a truly bonkers SCP concept on our hands.\n\nHe'd always been very complimentary towards 5243, so he wanted to make it a dark reflection of that. I'd always been amazed by his ability to weave a web of otherwise impenetrable story strings into something that makes terribly sane sense, and he did that here //par excellence.// I poured in the character beats, he kept the lunacy straight and storyboarded it all out. I did the Photoshopping, he did the CSS. I wrote the logs, he wrote the SCP. We had a creative back-and-forth for weeks, and when it was done we'd hammered out something really, really cool that belonged so equally to both of us it would be a supreme chore to finally say who did what.\n\nI wasn't sure anyone else would like it as much as we did.

I just piled tons on tons of evidence up for why this guy is nothing but bad, why it's a literal no-victim crime to put a bullet in his head, and it still causes a disaster when they finally do it. Couldn't have asked for a better theme.\n\nThis one did pretty well! I'm still tremendously pleased with JamCon, because I ended that exhausting three-day period with three full-fledged, high-quality skips that I only needed to edit a little afterwards to fix some minor errors.

My greenlighting conversation with [[*user Boogey_Man23]] and [[*user Sonderance]] particularly emphasized this potential.\n\nWhile the article as it stands does touch base on that theme, I wasn't able to explore it as much as I wanted to without breaking the format. I always intended to write a short tale about Phil and Doug.\n\nThis is not a short tale. It's not even two short tales! [[*user Grigori Karpin]] got it right: it's a novella in two parts.\n\nI'd meant to come up with an adventure for the 5056 couple, something that would allow me to delve into their backstory across eighteen years of awkward companionship. Then I actually started writing, and a romance plot developed out of thin air, and I started seeing Doug as a manifestation of certain... mental mechanisms I have considerably personal experience with, and before I knew it I had over twenty thousand words written.\n\nGeez, I hope they're in the right order.\n\nOh, fun fact: the title was one I was kicking around for the original SCP. I'm glad I used \"The Constant Companions,\" though, because \"The Significant Others\" actually has more than one meaning in the context of this tale.\n\nI wanted to put my ersatz drawing \"skills\" to work this time, since one scene in each half struck me as evocatively melancholic. I think they turned out alright. The real hard part was figuring out how the fuck to draw Doug; as the page image for 5056 shows, it's almost impossible to render the description I wrote without making him look like a fucking electrical socket. (There's even a joke about that in Part \"B\"; there are also jokes about how bad my original Photoshopped pic for 5056 was, and how much Doug's design has changed since the once presently in use.) I'm pleased that I've now drawn him three times now without him looking //too// doofy.\n\nYeah, three times.\n\n------\n\n[[=image Doug.png class=\"img-responsive\"]]\n[[=]]\n> \"Hello, Philip.\"\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nAnd now for something completely collaborative.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #CDD5F5; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px;\"]]\nCanon Renaissance Contest - Team Resurrecting Resurrection\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[[[Such a Shame It Didn't Work]]]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nThis tale is my first contribution to our contest series, **Old Foes**. I wanted to use Dr. Dan pretty much from the moment we picked this canon, because he struck me as uniquely grounded among the author avatars. Dude's got a personality, and he's got some stuff to atone for. But what could he have been doing all this time, if he wasn't executed? Nobody's ever written a word about him on the site, as far as I can see, except [[*user Dr Dan]] himself.\n\nWhen the solution came to me, I knew I had to do this. And boy, it's gonna pay off further with my tales later on. Hope you're ready for some nonsense!\n\nYou're not. Trust me, you just aren't.\n\n**Update:** Holy //shit,// this contest. My //tale// just hit //fifty.// And this was just the entrée.\n\n**Update 2, No Sequel Joke:** Uh what the fuck this is my highest-rated thing now. Thank you?\n\n**Update 3, Update with a Vengeance:** This just spent rather a long time as the highest-rated contest entry. Currently, it's tied for that honour. No matter what happens, I want you all to know that I have appreciated your votes and comments tremendously :)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[[[Sun (Sister) and Moon (Champion)]]]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nI revise. It's what I do, it's how I write. I start with whatever part of a story immediately grabs me, banging out the context as I go, building where I can and developing a structure on the fly. When I've got most of the structure figured out, most of the parts in place, I re-write the entire thing from scratch. Literally type all the words out a second time, while my brain tidies it up before it hits the keyboard. I do this several times for everything I post. I have thousands of revisions on my sandboxes.\n\nIt's a good thing I do it that way, because Moon Champion is //so hard to write.//\n\nYou might think you can just have him say Moon-this and Moon-that a lot, spout some gibberish, and be done with it. Nope. A very little of that goes a very long way. Too much of Moon Champion being Moon Champion quickly becomes infuriating; part of the undeniable beauty of the original article, by [[*user CadaverCommander]], is how well it balances the character's absurd dialogue with little slice-of-life depictions of him //not dialoguing.// Because I couldn't do that here, well, I had a hell of a time getting him to not irritate the fuck out of me with my own words. But I revised, and revised, and //revised,// and here we are.\n\nSauelsuesor also took a few passes to get right; I think I can say that was the result, getting it \"right,\" because people seem to have found the piece charming so far, and that's what I wanted.\n\nThese characters, and their creators, are fantastic, so I hope they take this as my thank-you to them for their great work. Wait'll you see what I do with them next, mwahaha.\n\nOh, also, holy shit thank you all for reading and voting, love y'all.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-bowe-decommission-part-one The Bowe Decommission, Part One]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nWhen I want to write, I want to write. Once I knew what canon we were doing for this contest, and once I knew our overall plotline, and once I'd picked my main character, I quickly figured out what I could get started on without stepping on anyone's toes. Site-19's inventory dumped out on the world, and creative solutions to the problems that poses; what a premise!\n\nIt took an incredible amount of work. I opened every SCP that contains the term \"Site-19\" and scanned it, looking for stuff I could use. I made up a list of about forty skips, and started trying to imagine what mini-stories I could tell with them. There were some real winners in that list, and I wanted to make more extensive use of them; I got in touch with a few authors, for more recent or more famous skips, to make sure I wasn't stepping on any toes.\n\nBut I particularly wanted to showcase stuff that's not doing as well as it should be, because there's a lot of that on this site. With that in mind I made sure each part of this story includes skips from all six series, and at least a few things with two-digit ratings. I hope I can get a few extra eyes on that stuff with my little (huge) ode to anomalous wackiness.\n\nEach part of this tale escalates said wackiness until it's balls-to-the-wall insanity. I hope you enjoy that progression as much as I have; this has been endlessly entertaining and rewarding for me.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-b-b-decommission The B&B Decommission]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nThe idea was to buffer my Bowe Decommission tales with stuff that //wasn't// my Bowe Decommission tales. Originally TBD was a two-parter, so it was just gonna be the collab in between. And then I realized I was writing an epic three-parter.\n\nSo, the idea //here// was to tell an off-side story. I wasn't trying to \"show off\" my stuff, I just thought I could use it to write a quick, fun action story showing how one Site, my Site, dealt with the situation. Did that come through? I dunno. But it's what I did. And I'm still super proud of that ending.\n\nI'll be writing a lot more about these people in the days to come.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-bowe-decommission-part-two The Bowe Decommission, Part Two]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nSo, here's where I'm clearly just endangering our lead in the contest by writing long stuff. Yeah, yeah, I know, you don't like long stuff. Well //listen,// strawman, I wanted to really dig into Dr. Dan and this disaster, and it turned out that I couldn't cover all the really important story beats without taking my sweet-ass time. So, I did.\n\nI think each of these stories ended up telling a different sort of tale, as Dr. Dan's hour grew increasingly late and the chaos ramped up. This is the tale where it becomes apparent that we're dealing with the full extent of our site's insanity, that Harry takes a Grant Morrison view of canon - it's all real. \n\nThis is also the tale where I got to have a lot of fun with other people's toys. My goodness, Bigg Redd and Moon Champion and Turbo Thompson are fun. Writing for this series has taught me something I thought I already knew: shared universes are fantastic.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/scenes-from-a-comprehensive-clusterfuck Scenes from a Comprehensive Clusterfuck]**  \n(with [[*user Karakatt]], [[*user notgull]], and [[*user The Pighead]])\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nThis thing, wow. It call came together so fast! I wrote most of my stuff after the other three members had submitted their scenes. I knit them together, and was amazed at how well the whole thing worked as a... well, as a whole. Kara's parking scene and gull's FEC mixup were the first two ideas floated, and on the strength of that nuttiness I suggested calling it all \"Scenes from a Generalized Clusterfuck.\" A slightly different name, and many, many scenes later, and we have this thing here.\n\nI think it's quite coherent, and I like it a lot. I built many of my scenes on the backs of what my colleagues gave me, used them as glue for my more disparate ideas. It was a real group effort, just like the project writ large has been.\n\nCollab at me, bro.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-bowe-decommission-part-three The Bowe Decommission, Part Three]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nI've had this endgame in various stages of constuction for the entire time I've been writing for the contest. I knew how I wanted this to end, the scenes I wanted to set. I laboured long and hard over these three long tales to make sure they did what I wanted them to: expose people to popular //and// overlooked SCPs that I think are great, play around with fun characters, build Dr. Dan into someone I can use a lot for tales going forward, and present some wildly hilarious fanservice along the way.\n\nI'm extremely proud of the way it turned out.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; background-color: #EEF1FC;\" colspan=\"1\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[http://www.scpwiki.com/broken-bowe Broken Bowe]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\nOriginally we were just going to end with gull's General Bowe skip. And then I suggested we do a collaborative epilogue, in addition to our other collaborative tale.\n\nAnd then I wrote the epilogue! Oh well. I wanted to hammer home what had happened, explore the characters some more, do a sort of //Animal House// check-in on our protagonists, set up future directions and introduce a few last-minute twists. I think a good epilogue should be melancholy, bittersweet, kinda funny and cute, and it should also put everything that came before in a different light. Did I manage all that? Well, uh, you tell me.\n\nThis contest has been the most fun I've had writing for the site, and I have had NOTHING BUT FUN writing for the site. I'd do it all over in a heartbeat, and I hope to continue to write for Res in the future. It's great fun, and I think it has real value as a showcase for the best of what the community has to offer. \n\nIn these five tales, we reference **fifty-four SCP files**.\n\nHow do you like //them// anomalies.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Blank Pages, or Words What Won't Conform, Man\" hide=\"- Hope you like whatever these are!\"]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: center; width: 700px\"]]\n**The Scariest Thing I've Posted (But It's Only Scary to Me)**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #F9E7FF; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px; padding-top: 6px; padding-bottom: 6px\"]]\n\"The Lake Huron Research and Containment Facility\"\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding-left: 12px; padding-right: 12px;\"]]\n**Secure Facility Dossier:** [http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]\n\n**Object Lesson:** Worlds build themselves while you're doing other things.\n\n**Special Quotation Procedures:** \"The victors are written by history.\"\n\n**Dissection:** I have wanted a Site dossier, and not wanted to post one and get critically savaged, for a long time. I've been working on this one since the end of my first trilogy of articles, although only the basic boilerplate text from the earliest iterations survived. I was going to make the meat of the dossier the story of how the Site came into existence; in the end, the whole thing came to a whopping 5.5k words, and [[*user Grigori Karpin]] convinced me to split that shit off. That's when I came up with the idea of doing a slice-of-life thing, really characterizing the ominous departments I'd been name-dropping since 5056. I did a //lot// of work in Inkscape, making up vector images for Section logos, and I had great fun with that insane map.\n\nOnce I was definitely making the history pieces their own separate things, I got the idea of using the dossier as a hub for Foundation academic material. If the two articles I already have up don't fail utterly (one of them is in serious danger of this) I'll produce more... and shop them around a bunch before posting them, this time. I think it's a fun idea.\n\nGod, was I afraid of posting this thing.\n\n**Assessment:** So far, nobody hates it. That might be because the hatred has been reserved for the academic articles, though.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Blank Friendart, or Drawing a Blank \" hide=\"- Thank you for your pixels!\"]]\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=700px\n|url=5494.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=[[*user PLAGUEPJP]] DREW MY THING\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=300px\n|url=Xilas.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Portrait of my IRC persona by [[*user XilasCrowe]] who thinks I look like a hairy turd apparently\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=tiamat_final.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A lovely rendition of [[[SCP-5866]]] by [[*user Ralliston]], hooray!\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=highaltitudetiamat.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A gorgeous interpretation of [[[SCP-5866]]] by [https://red-sprite-lightning.tumblr.com/ red-sprite-lightning!] Follow that link to check out their tumblr\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=700px\n|url=Lillian.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Portrait of Dr. Lillian Lillihammer by [[*user EstrellaYoshte]] which takes my breath away\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=700px\n|url=pastawynn.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption= [[*user pastarasta1]] absolutely goddamn nailing [[[SCP-5520]]].\n]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author's Will \" hide=\"- or \"Author's Wont\"\"]]\nIf I die/ragequit/disappear for six months/die/get banned/die, anything co-authored goes to whoever co-authored it.
