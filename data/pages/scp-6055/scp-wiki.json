A defensive perimeter of Foundation craft should be maintained 1 mile around SCP-6055’s current borders at all times. Civilians wishing to enter the waters surrounding SCP-6055 should be told that the area contains undetonated undersea mines left over from the Second World War. Requests to enter SCP-6055 must first be approved by at least two (2) Level 4 researchers.\n\nIf species resembling SCP-6055-2 are discovered between the months of August and November, a Cetacea Event should be declared.\n\nDuring a Cetacea Event, a small fleet of Foundation-operated military ships should accompany the SCP-6055-2 instance(s) for the duration of their pilgrimage to SCP-6055. Civilians are to be told that this is a routine military training exercise. Unauthorised persons who view SCP-6055-2 instances should be administered amnestics accordingly. Interaction with SCP-6055-2 instances during this event are prohibited.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6055 is an extradimensional space located within the Baltic Sea, 50 miles off the coast of Stockholm, Sweden. The space is known to be extremely large within, despite not being able to logically fit with the geometry of local surroundings. \n\nThe only known entrance into SCP-6055 is a small cave opening that is currently {{4}} metres in diameter though is shrinking at an exponential rate. At the time of its discovery, the gap was approximately 95 metres in diameter and has been slowly getting smaller. The space is known to contain an area noted as having ‘extreme natural beauty’ with abundant corals, aquatic flora and an extremely high density of marine animal life. \n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/ozzylizard/Lake\n| caption= The lake in which the first recorded SCP-6055-2 manifested.\n]]\n\nSCP-6055-2 are anomalous creatures that have manifested during a Cetacea Event. Yearly,[[footnote]] Between the months of August and November. [[/footnote]] 5% of Earth’s ocean life begins to migrate towards SCP-6055, designated a Cetacea Event. During this time, affected fauna will gather in large shoals. These consist of species that would normally never interact with one another and predatory creatures will display no requirement for sustenance (Though strictly herbivorous creatures continue to consume plant matter). All fauna present will circle around SCP-6055 for 2-3 days, though none have been observed to enter the space.\n\nAdditionally, a small number of undiscovered species will manifest from unknown locations and join other creatures influenced by a Cetacea Event. These species will be similar in some way to an already known species, though typically have features including drastically altered size, proportions or some biological feature that makes them divergent from a non-anomalous creature and in most cases display bioluminescence.\n\nIt is currently unknown how long SCP-6055 has been present in baseline reality, though descriptions of ‘sea monsters’ fitting descriptions of SCP-6055-2 characteristics worldwide indicate that Cetacea Events may have occurred as long as 500-600 years ago. A small engraving in modern Swedish can be found above the direct entrance to SCP-6055, reading //Här är vi, skickade till våra gravar, begravda under havsvågor.// (//See Exploration Log 6055-1//). The significance of the text is unknown.\n\n**Addendum 6055.1:** POI Interview \n\nOn 12/03/1995, Brodie Campbell, a 46 year old Scottish fisherman was discovered to have posted a thread [[footnote]] Which was swiftly removed. [[/footnote]] on an online fishing forum about his experiences with SCP-6055-2 instances in the past. It was discovered that he had known of of the SCP-6055-2 longer than the Foundation had been aware of the anomaly’s existence. An interview was swiftly arranged by Foundation personnel.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Person of Interest Interview Log 6055-1\" hide=\"- Hide Person of Interest Interview Log 6055-1\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** Brodie Campbell\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Agent Carter\n> \n> **Foreword:** This interview was conducted 3 days after Mr Campbell’s initial post regarding SCP-6055-2, and took place within his residence in the town of Crail, Scotland.\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Greetings, Mr Campbell.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Hello. Please, just call me Brodie.\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** As you wish. I’m here to inquire on your recent online post regarding ‘Strange Beasts in the North Sea’.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Oh, yeah I remember. Are you the guys who took it down? Did I do something wrong?\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Not at all, Brodie. We just want to know some more about the creatures you claim to have seen.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Why? Did you see them too? I think I put the majority of my experience in the thread. \n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Yes, I uh, I have seen them. I’m currently trying to research and document the creatures and want to know if you have any additional knowledge surrounding them.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Oh, well in that case I’ll tell you everything I know. You see, it all started when I was born..\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** You don’t need to start that far back, Mr Campbell. Just from your first experience with the creatures.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Aye, alright then. Well my first experience was when I was doing my fishing about 5 miles off the coast in 1972 in Autumn, the sea was very rough. Alongside my regular catch, I got a huge amount of fish, I can’t remember what type but I think they were only found in Mexico or somewhere so I thought that was odd. On my way back to shore, this.. (//Pauses//) Well I don’t know how to describe it, a huge shoal of all sorts of fish just swam underneath my boat. I mean it wasn’t even just fish, there was turtles, jellyfish, whales, dolphins and.. Something bigger..\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Please elaborate.\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** There was a giant.. Shark.. A hammerhead, but its skin wasn’t right.\n> \n> (//Mr Campbell sits in silence for 15 seconds.//)\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** It was like it had something weird for scales. Covering its skin, I could see underneath when it moved. And it was absolutely huge. A regular hammerhead’s like what, 6 metres? This thing must have been 40 or 50. And its eyes glowed like a slight blue colour. I swear it looked at me, its eyes glaring right into my soul. \n> \n> **Agent Carter:** And you didn’t tell anyone else about this?\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** I didn’t really have anyone to tell, my parents died when I was little and I had no siblings or real friends. I vaguely remember telling someone at the Pub when I had a bit too much to drink, but I doubt they believed me.\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Okay then. Have you had any other encounters?\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Yeah, well in ‘83 I got a job for some fishing company in Sweden. I saw more of them in the Baltic Sea than I did when I was fishing here. I mean it happens every year, about autumn time. All the beasties in the sea start moving towards Sweden, Norway, Denmark sort of area.\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Alright, have you gathered any additional information about the creatures you encountered? \n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** They don’t like rubbish.\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** They.. Sorry?\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Well, one time I just threw my water bottle over the side when I was finished with it, there wasn’t really too much worry about pollution back then, and then the huge shoal came by, and one of the huge turtles with oddly shaped rocks on its back came up to the surface and just kind of poked the bottle with its nose and well.. Died.\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Immediately?\n> \n> **Mr Campbell:** Yeah, just kind of went limp and sunk to the bottom of the sea.[[footnote]] __Note:__ Based on Mr Campbell’s description, it is believed that an object discovered in 2011 known to the public as ‘The Baltic Sea Anomaly’ may be the remains of the creature. [[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Agent Carter:** Okay, I understand. This concludes the interview. //(To radio)// Prepare the amnestics. Thank you for your time, Mr Campbell. \n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 6055.2:** Discovery\n\nSCP-6055 was discovered following the first documented Cetacea Event in the Autumn of 1987.\n\nThree humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) displaying unusually large size (approximately 60 metres in length), near black colouration and large amounts of moss, kelp and flora along their backs manifested in a large lake leading to the North Baltic Sea. The lake was a popular local destination, meaning that numerous reports were filed to agents embedded in local law enforcement regarding the creatures. This lead to Foundation intervention. The creatures were followed using small fishing craft for 205 miles. \n\nDuring this journey, a school of fish and other marine life had amassed over 3 million entities, with the SCP-6055-2 whales leading the group. After 26 hours, the instances reached SCP-6055 which at the time was approximately 95 metres in diameter. All creatures present began what was described as ‘like a huge underwater dance’, circling around SCP-6055 in a manner of patterns and forms. At this point, a wider Foundation force was called to the scene and the Swedish government sectioned off the area. It was noted that the SCP-6055-2 whales caused instantaneous growth of kelp, moss, algae and even undiscovered species of aquatic fungi to manifest in the immediate area.\n\nTwo days later, all creatures had fled the area, and the SCP-6055-2 whales begun to rapidly descend into the Baltic Sea before seemingly disappearing once out of line of sight of Foundation personnel.\n\nFollowing this, a search of SCP-6055 was conducted by MTF Gamma-6 ‘Deep Feeders’. //(See Exploration Log 6055-1)//.\n\n\n**Addendum 6055.3:** Exploration Logs\n\nDespite SCP-6055’s remote location, attempts have taken place to explore the extradimensional space, though many were conducted via ROV [[footnote]] Remotely Operated Vehicle [[/footnote]]. The following are all manned explorations to date.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Exploration Log 6055-1\" hide=\"- Hide Exploration Log 6055-1\"]]\n\n> **Foreword:** This expedition was carried out by Foundation divers of MTF Gamma-6 and was conducted on 19/10/1987, 2 days and 23 hours after the onset of the first Cetacea Event //(See Addendum 6055.1 for description of events leading up to the expedition)//.\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **G6-1:** Everyone ready?\n> \n> (//The task force responds positive and begin descent into SCP-6055.

Despite visually being a short distance from below, the swim took teams 3 hours. Even though divers were seemingly travelling at a constant speed, they appeared to be moving excessively slowly. When teams emerged, they found themselves in a vast expanse of water with no land in the visible distance. The journey back took only 3 minutes. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Exploration Log 6055-2\" hide=\"- Hide Exploration Log 6055-2\"]]\n> **Foreword:** This exploration was again taken out by divers of MTF Gamma-6 on 06/07/1988 . Following numerous unmanned ROV missions, it was determined that no threat was present within SCP-6055. At the time, SCP-6055 was at a width of about 52 metres, meaning that a manned vehicle was able to be deployed for a wider area of investigation. The following is the log of the second manned expedition into the space.\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **G6-1:** We are at the target location, Command please deploy the sub.\n> \n> (//A muffled splash can be heard.//)\n> \n> **G6-1:** Thanks guys.

G6-1 gathered better recording equipment to document and incite a conversation with the unknown entity. G6-5 and G6-6 continued to move north in the submersible. \n\nJust minutes before Gamma-6 left the area, the Piper Alpha Incident occurred. [[footnote]] Piper Alpha was an oil platform located in the North Sea approximately 120 miles north-east of Aberdeen, Scotland. An explosion and resulting oil and gas fires destroyed Piper Alpha on 6 July 1988, killing 167 men, and caused an immensely large oil spill. It is, to date recognised as one of the worst oceanic catastrophes ever witnessed. [[/footnote]] Upon Gamma-6’s exit from the space, the entrance had noticeably decreased in size.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 6055.4:** Interviews With Anomalous Intelligence\n\nOn 06/07/1988, during the second manned expedition into SCP-6055, a golden sphere was discovered that displayed heightened intellect, capable of maintaining conversations. MTF Gamma-6’s commander organised an interview attempt with it, 32 hours after the object’s discovery. Their conversation can be found in Interview Log 6055-1.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Interview Log 6055-1\" hide=\"- Hide Interview Log 6055-1\"]]\n\n> **Interviewed:** Unidentified Anomalous Intelligence\n> \n> **Interviewer:** G6-1\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **G6-1:** Let’s try this again.

[[/footnote]], though it would not respond to any vocalisations.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n__Sidenote:__ After the conclusion of this interview, G6-5 and G6-6 returned from their submersible expedition. They travelled 83 miles north from SCP-6055’s entrance before returning. The pair noted that a pod of sperm whales (Physeter macrocephalus) accompanied them for the duration of their journey. They noted that SCP-6055 was on a large hill or undersea mountain.\n\nUpon making it to the bottom of a large slope that SCP-6055 seems to be located upon, the team discovered the remains of a large urban area in the far distance. The area seemed to resemble the modern city of Stockholm, though showing heavy decay. Notably, this slope is not present in the local area within baseline reality.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Interview Log 6055-2\" hide=\"- Hide Interview Log 6055-2\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** Anomalous Intelligence, designated ‘Ubi’\n> \n> **Interviewer:** G6-1\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **G6-1:** Hello?

Ubi inserts itself into the space and begins spinning. Rumbling can be heard, as the rock face is lifted up, into the surrounding area. It is revealed that behind the rock is a large room, approximately 30 metres in height and 15 metres in width and length.

Due to their nature, it was determined that they were intended to be read in a similar manner to those found in ancient tombs, and some outside help was acquired to ascertain their meaning. The following is the results of heavy analysis of the chamber’s walls.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Concealed Chamber Analysis\" hide=\"- Hide Concealed Chamber Analysis\"]]\n**Leftmost Wall:** [[footnote]] From perspective of entrance.

The vague forms of [[[SCP-169|SCP-169]]], [[[SCP-1126|SCP-1126]]] and [[[SCP-3000]]] are present. All 3 are notably being observed by a submersible crew in white lab coats.\n\n**Central Wall:** Everything above the aforementioned seascape is becoming drenched in a black substance, that is being secreted by the land above. The previously mentioned anomalies are no longer present, though multiple SCP-6055-2 that resemble the first discovered, are covered in the substance and other pieces of debris. Numerous SCP-6055-2 are seen lifeless and decomposing on the ocean floor. The average sea level is noticeably higher than on the left wall. Figures resembling the 05 Council are overlooking the scene.\n\n**Rightmost Wall:** Shows the cities entirely submerged. A mountain, still above water, with a clear crater or ravine within, is present to the right. It’s slope is being traversed by a vehicle that appears to have the Foundation insignia engraved upon it, with all members of the 05 council within. An entity resembling 05-4 appears to be residing within a hut (one of many located in a large cove on the top of the mountain) composed of clay and wood, with 2 golden semicircles in either hand. The semicircles are glowing, and a partially constructed golden ring is engraved within a nearby cliff. Figures in lab coats watch it intently.\n\n**Ceiling:** The 2 semicircles are now one whole. A large, golden circle is centred, emitting a yellowish light into the surroundings. The entire cove once inhabited is now underwater and has corals, kelp and a landscape resembling SCP-6055’s immediate area. Through the previously described ring, now instead of rock, shows a cave entrance, leading into a much darker seascape. Many fish, crustaceans, cetaceans and cephalopods are present in this area, though the huts are now abandoned and lifeless. \n\nThe ceiling has a distinguishable difference in art style from the other surfaces, indicating that it may have been created by a different entity.\n\nTo date, Ubi refuses to respond to questioning about the room, though it has been observed to stare at the ceiling before returning to its pedestal.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"RESEARCHER’S NOTE\" hide=\"Displaying...\"]]\n**Note from Site Director Moore (08/06/1999):**\n\n**[BEGIN VOICE LOG]**\nGreetings, I am director of Site-115, responsible for research of SCP-6055. Though we have sent Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 into SCP-6055 many times following the second exploration log, Anomalous Intelligence UF-11 designated ‘Ubi’ no longer responds to questions regarding SCP-6055, its origins, or Cetacea Events. It seems to enjoy conversations, though it instead prefers to discuss more.. mundane subjects. These include the current state of the Foundation, the global economy, it cares deeply about our oceans but most notably the current state of the 05 Council.\n\nIt expresses great.. How do I say.. Care. For 05-4. Upon questioning, 05-4 did not seem to have any knowledge of this anomaly. I have requested other members of the 05 and the Administrator to search his files, see if there was any information on Ubi. \n\nIt seems that he was legitimately telling the truth about his lack of knowledge regarding Anomalous Intelligence UF-11, though we have decided to... Terminate his research into a personal project of his, named ‘**U**ndersea **B**alancing **I**nitiative’. He claims it could help lower the rising sea levels, though seeing what occurred within SCP-6055, I think it’s for the best. Plans indicate that the physical creation of this plan is immensely similar in composition to A.I UF-11 ‘Ubi’. Based on these recent discoveries, it is believed that the dimension accessed by SCP-6055 is a near exact mirror dimension of our own, that has undergone an XK-Class End of the World Scenario of unknown origin. We are currently unaware of what event or entity(s) were responsible for the XK Scenario or if they have a counterpart in baseline reality. \n\nO5-4 was simply doing what the SCP-6055 equivalent of O5-4 would be doing, without his knowing, beginning to create ‘Ubi’, a.k.a the ‘**U**ndersea **B**alancing **I**nitiative’. Evidence points towards UF-11 ‘Ubi’ utilising Cetacea Events to attract the attention of our dimension’s equivalent of its creator, O5-4. We are… Unsure of why Ubi wishes to speak with him. For his own safety, UF-11 should be denied contact with O5-4.\n**[END VOICE LOG]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 6055.6:** Update (06/05/2021)\n\nSCP-6055’s entrance is now at a width where it has become increasingly difficult to send divers into the space, and due to the size of ROVs, it is now challenging to explore the area further. There has been a direct correlation between SCP-6055’s closing and oceanic pollution, and funding has been sent to organisations dealing with the ocean’s health. This endeavour, and rising public awareness of oceanic corruption has significantly lowered the rate of SCP-6055’s closing. Despite these endeavours, research must be put on hold as SCP-6055’s entrance has closed drastically.\n\nIn response to the Mauritius oil spill in the Indian Ocean, SCP-6055’s entrance closed a further 3 metres. 12 days later, during a Foundation assisted mass cleanup operation, a radio signal believed to originate from Anomalous Intelligence UF-11 ‘Ubi’ was broadcast from SCP-6055. This was intercepted by a patrol ship, the message reads as follows:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Messsge from A.I.
