It's not particularly impressive or long but it's a cute fun little thing. Sometimes that kinda stuff just catches my imagination better, I guess? Yeah. There's another spec-bio article I want to draw something for too eventually but I have been pretty busy getting ready for my hand surgery and had to pick one or the other.\n\nSpeaking of surgery, that's happening next Friday and I've got some stuff I need to get done before then so this is going to be the last one of these for a while, at least until after I've healed. I am gonna try and read out some of the articles I've drawn so far in full on youtube though, just to have SOMETHING to do while I'm healing.\n\nStill, I hope I landed on a high note. I love drawing foliage and I kinda went all out for this one. I wanted to semi-accurately portray the species of trees listed(Japanese Red Pine and Silver-leaf Oak) and draw a cute little creature in there. That fox-like repto-mammal.  \n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
