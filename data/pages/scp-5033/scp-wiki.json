The cell is to be outfitted with multiple stress-reducing amenities, including but not limited to the following:\n* A stereo system playing slow, classical music\n* An automatic feeding system stocked with hay, sticks, and twigs\n* Stacked blocks and plastic balls for climbing\n\nUpon the detection of a 5033-IGUSHA event, a sleeping gas is to be administered to the cell. If necessary, SCP-5033 is to be sheared at this time.\n\nA safe testing area is currently under construction, as SCP-5033 is suspected of having additional anomalous abilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5033 is a Valais Blacknose sheep[[footnote]]//Ovis aries//[[/footnote]].\n\nWhen stressed, SCP-5033 will go into a 5033-IGUSHA event. During a 5033-IGUSHA event, SCP-5033 will detonate with an energy equivalent to that of a kilogram of TNT every ten seconds. Notably, SCP-5033 is unaffected by the force generated by these detonations. The detonations are also not a stressor to SCP-5033. Upon significant relaxation, the 5033-IGUSHA event will then conclude.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5033 was discovered in the Valais region of Switzerland after a number of reports concerning multiple explosions in the mountains. MTF Zeta-35 (\"Mountain Goats\") was dispatched to the location, at which SCP-5033 was contained through the use of a tranquilizer. \n\nNear SCP-5033 was a charred human corpse carrying a rifle, later identified as Helmut Hammerschmidt, who was associated with a poaching organization dedicated to the hunting of potentially anomalous animals.\n\nA notepad was discovered on Hammerschmidt's body, which contained data tracking certain animals and reports. The following entries were legible: \n\n> Schmid's getting closer and closer to his so-called 'big discovery,' and everyone is on his dick about it. He hasn't even revealed anything yet, I bet that fucker doesn't even have anything, just like all the other fakes. They're all just here for attention.\n> \n> But I'm gonna be going out to the mountains tomorrow. People have been talking about some interesting things up there, and my rifle's itching for some action. \n> \n> I'll show him what a real 'big discovery' is. Can't wait to see the look on his face. \n\n> I hate climbing. All this goddamn equipment is heavy as hell. \n> \n> Every time I feel like giving up, I think about Schmid. About his dirty smirk. About everyone congratulating him. About how //I// can't let that happen. \n> \n> And I keep going. Fuck him.\n\n> The target is in my sights. A little sheep. It reminds me of something, but I can't quite put my finger on it.\n> \n> It's eating sticks. Are animals supposed to eat sticks? Maybe it acts as fuel for its... powers? Still not sure what it does.\n> \n> I'm gonna watch it for a bit. See if it does anything interesting. My camera is set up to track it. \n\n> It's been a few hours, and I can't get Schmid out of my mind. Fucking asshole. \n\n> I shot at the sheep. A warning shot. It started fucking exploding. \n> \n> I've struck gold. I bet it'll wipe Schmid's grin right off his face.\n> \n> Just gotta shoot this thing dead. It's a shame, it's actually pretty cute. Maybe I can get it stuffed as a little trophy.\n\n> The bullets aren't doing anything. I've shot it five fucking times. I think it's invincible to bullets.\n> \n> I should get backup. But also... I don't want to go back. I bet Schmid would make fun of me for being a coward, or something idiotic like that. \n> \n> I'm gonna stab it. It only explodes every ten seconds, and the range isn't that far... I might be able to get up close and kill it.\n> \n> Then I'll come back with its corpse, and I'll be a hero. I'm so close...\n> \n> I can't fucking wait.\n\nDespite multiple bullet shells littering the ground and other evidence that Hammerschmidt had been firing at SCP-5033, no bullet wounds were found on the entity. Investigation into the poaching organization, as well as SCP-5033's suspected invulnerability to harm caused by hostile actions, is ongoing.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5032]]] | SCP-5033 | [[[SCP-5034]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
