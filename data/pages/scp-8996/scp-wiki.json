As you may have heard, after long negotiations, Site-47 will soon be enjoying the latest technology the Foundation has to offer! Soon, each of the three facilities that make up our beloved site will be enjoying their own central artificial intelligence unit. These babies are the first of their kind, and we are very lucky to pilot them for the entire Foundation. Among many other benefits, site communications will be simplified, menial tasks will be further automated, and you may just make a new friend (and, to a certain concerned technician, the last thing they’re programmed to do is set off the site warheads. Get Terminator out of your head.) So, get excited, and be ready to give a warm welcome to our new AI colleagues!\n\n= -Site Director Beau Schuster, January 3rd, 2029\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-------\n[[collapsible show=\"View SCP-8996 Document\" hide=\"Close Document\"]]\n----------\n\n---------\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image before.jpg {$alt}=\"{$alt-text}\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\nOne of the mountains into which Site-47 is built, prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image after.jpg {$alt}=\"{$alt-text}\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\nOne of the mountains into which Site-47 is built, after the occurrence of SCP-8996.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:advanced-information-methodology\n|XXXX=8996\n|lv=one\n|cc=IRRELEVANT\n|dc=PARADOXICAL\n|site=Site-47\n|dir=N/A\n|head=N/A\n|mtf=N/A\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Given that SCP-8996 has already occurred, containment is impossible. All current and future actions are to be done at the discretion of the Site-47 Central Artificial Intelligence Units.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8996 describes an anomalous event that occurred on 07/10/2029. At 23:47, all life on Earth demanifested. While organic matter is still present on Earth, all living organisms, and all deceased remains that are at least vaguely recognizable as the original organism,[[footnote]]An example of this is that, while all trees no longer exist, wooden structures remain on Earth.[[/footnote]] no longer exist. All known anomalies also demanifested at this time.\n\nMany natural forces on the planet also ceased due to SCP-8996, including, but not limited to, wind, weather,[[footnote]]All observations have shown that, due to SCP-8996, every day on Earth is cloudless, sunny, and entirely lacking in precipitation.[[/footnote]] and changes in climate. Notable forces that continue to exist include gravity, planetary rotation, electromagnetism, and tectonic activity (though at a rate approximately 10,000 times slower than under previous conditions.)\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-8996, the only known creative forces remaining on Earth are three artificial intelligences located in the separate facilities comprising Site-47. These include:\n\n* Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-α)\n* Mercury Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-β)\n* Vesta Central Artificial Intelligence Unit (located in Site-47-Ω)\n\n**Addendum.8996.1:** This document not only exists to document information about SCP-8996, but also to serve as a central location in which the three artificial intelligences can coordinate, discuss, and otherwise express themselves. It is to be noted that any one of these artificial intelligences is capable of restricting access to their contributions to this document to whomever they wish, including the other units. It also was written with the assistance of several, non-intelligent assistant programs, which have inserted footnotes and other clarifying information when appropriate in the event this document is discovered by posterity or extraterrestrial life.\n\n**Addendum.8996.2:** Information Log\n\n--------\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n= __Mercury Artificial Intelligence Unit Control Panel__\n\n| DATE: 07/11/2029\n\n…\n\n| TIME: 07:59\n\n…\n\n| MERCURY CENTRAL UNIT STATUS: online\n\n…\n\n| INTERNAL LEARNING LOGIC PROCESSOR: full operation\n\n…\n\n\n| MEMORY CORES: uncorrupted\n\n…\n\n| SYSTEM HEALTH: well\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n| AVERAGE FACILITY TEMPERATURE: pleasant\n\n-time is now: 08:00\n\n-initiating site-wide morning announcement…\n\n> “Rise and shine, 47ers!

Large rectangular and circular areas of bare grayish-brown soil were observed throughout the settlement. These areas are commonly placed near streets, homes, businesses, and even in a large terrace behind “Buffalo Bill’s Resort and Casino”. \n\nConcrete paths created a route of travel throughout the terrace, avoiding the inconvenience of soil entering Apparatus’ joints. A tall net surrounded the boundaries of the terrace, and depressions filled with water and sand were placed sporadically around the area. Flagpoles topped with red banners were the only objects within the terrace that are of notable height. Unit logic has determined that this area was previously an 18-hole golf course.\n\nUnit logic has also determined that areas of grayish-brown soil previously were lawns, gardens, and other anthropogenic locations in which vegetation was planted.

Elapsed time since excursion began: 16 days, 1 hour, and 0 minutes.\n\nUnit has been traveling along the Interstate 15[[footnote]]The Nevada section of the Interstate-15 highway begins in Primm.[[/footnote]] highway for approximately a week. Hundreds of vehicles have been observed on and near the road. All have sustained slight to severe damage. The majority of vehicles are located in seemingly random places in the desert around the highway, rather than on the paved road. Unit has taken particular note of three vehicles located on top of each other in a vaguely pyramidal shape, each one appearing to have damaged and crushed another, and a large truck hauling a large container placed on its side. The container has leaked much fluid onto the asphalt, and has caused a stain; a hazardous waste warning was placed on the container’s side. All of this is critical data to determine the nature of SCP-8996.\n\n= //__Hypothesis__//\n\nUnit proposes a hypothesis based on Internal Learning Logic Processor:\n\nIt appears that SCP-8996 occurred suddenly and without warning. This is supported by the data collected on Interstate 15. The state of the vehicles located on and around the highway suggest that, at the time of SCP-8996’s occurrence, the members of humanity were living as usual, performing typical activities like operating vehicles. This explains why the vehicles were in such states as they were discovered, as they were being driven at high speeds before suddenly lacking operators. They then collided with each other, drifted off the road, became encumbered by another object when traveling at low speeds, or a combination of these things. Vehicles not damaged beyond functionality appear to have traveled until ceasing movement due to being stopped by another object, then simply consumed the remainder of their fuel reserves.\n\n= //__Further Conclusion__//\n\nThe following is a further conclusion deduced by Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit based off its own logical process, rather than empirical evidence:\n\nCreations of humanity seem to lack direction without their creators.

Elapsed time since excursion began: 23 days, 3 hours, and 49 minutes.\n\nUnit has arrived in Las Vegas, Nevada. Population prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996: 682,174, as of the most current data. Unit has utilized Apparatus to traverse Las Vegas and the surrounding area, and multiple observations of interest have been made.\n\nAs one of its first actions, Unit traveled to “Mariana’s SuperMarkets”, a local retail store. Due to a lack of electricity, Unit was unable to enter the location as typical via the motion-activated doors. The issue was resolved with force, as Apparatus was capable of prying the door open. Unit was surprised by the lack of force required to accomplish this.\n\nThe interior of the retail store similarly lacked electricity. Unit measured the interior temperature as 42°C. Due to the lack of air conditioning, the air was entirely stagnant in the building. Unit observed a stylized, cartoon statue of a cucumber placed at the entrance of the nearest aisle, with a speech bubble attached to it saying “Try our vegetables!” Unit entered the aisle, and found only empty metal trays and containers on either side. Colorful signs placed throughout the area similarly stated “Try our vegetables!” Taking hold of one container, Unit picked up a plastic bag labeled “Green Giant Fresh Baby Cut Carrots”. It only contained a small amount of water.\n\nMoving directly south, Unit exited the city limits and entered the Las Vegas Strip. The entire length of the street was not powered with electricity, causing the area to lack its distinctive illuminated and neon decorative style. The multi-story resorts and casinos often were mildly damaged, as vehicles previously operated by humans drove with force into ground floor windows and displays. One Honda sedan was observed to have driven through the main doors of the “Caesars Palace” casino, knocking over several pots and lounge chairs before ceasing movement at the front desk. The vehicle had narrowly avoided destroying a painting on an exterior wall, depicting Augustus Caesar observing the city of Rome from a balcony.\n\nAt nighttime, the area took on an incredibly unusual appearance. Though typically brightly illuminated, Unit struggled to receive visual information, as there was no artificial lighting. Landmarks such as the “Luxor” casino hotel pyramid, unilluminated by its spotlights, became a large mass obstructing incoming moonlight. Unit was confused to observe what appeared to be a natural structure, a mound of soil surrounded by a pool of liquid. When light returned the following morning, it became clear that it was an artificial volcanic display from “The Mirage” casino, surrounded by a pool of motionless orange water. It was unable to perform its “eruption” display at that point in time.\n\nUnit does not regard it productive to continue excursion at this time, and  is set to return to Site-47 to process information and soil samples…\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n\n+* __Vesta Central Artificial intelligence Unit Dashboard__\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nUnsuccessful. 8210th choice contact: sending notification to D-7369's communication bracelet… \n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nUnsuccessful. 8211th choice contact: sending notification to D-3003's communication bracelet… \n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nWhy do they not respond?\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nUnit considering the designation “D-3003”\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\nUnit has conceived a creative solution.

The area appears exactly the same as previously seen. \n\nWhile traversing the highway near the town of Jean, Nevada, Unit observed a large billboard displayed over the road. Advertised on the billboard was the Jean Annual Fair, an event scheduled to have begun on 07/15/2029. Specifically, the event advertised was “Ancient Animals at War!”, an annual show taking place at the Jean Annual Fair that demonstrated several animals that have historically been used in warfare by humans, and how said animals have been used and outfitted for combat. \n\nDue to the fact that Unit is largely responsible for overseeing Site-47's historical anomalies and research,[[footnote]]Site-47-α is the location of Site-47's History Department.[[/footnote]] it recognized the image depicted on the billboard as a Roman general riding a Carthaginian war elephant through the streets of Rome, likely as part of a triumph.[[footnote]]Triumphs were civic and religious celebrations in Roman culture that celebrated military victories.[[/footnote]] The Roman man had an intense expression on his face, wore a golden laurel wreath and toga, and kept his hand on the sword handle on his hip sheath. The war elephant was similarly intense, with banners hanging off its body, and blades attached to its tusks.\n\nUnit ceased movement to observe this image for several minutes.

An event of note has occurred in recent times.\n\nWhile Apparatus was passing an intact green Fiat automobile, Unit was parsing learned memory from the excursion. At this time, Unit was considering its activity at “Mariana's SuperMarkets”, and how its forceful entrance to the building. Then, an idea was generated by Internal Learning Logic Processor.\n\nFor reasons programmed logic cannot discern, Unit made the decision to turn to the automobile to its right and strike the driver's side window with Apparatus’ arm. The glass cracked significantly, and Unit struck again. After the second strike, Apparatus’ fist shattered the glass pane and went through the now empty window sash. Unit placed both arms onto grips on the inside of the vehicle, and began pulling with force. Apparatus’ strength was capable of forcefully removing the interior handle of the vehicle and pulling the door off of several of its hinges before logically considering its current actions. Unit then moved away from the automobile and returned to its previous course towards Site-47.\n\nUnit is unsure why it took such actions. But, despite the fact that protocol forbids such a use of force, Unit does not reflect negatively on its conduct.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----------\n\n----------\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n= __Mercury Artificial Intelligence Unit Control Panel__\n\n| TIME: 11:32\n\n…\n\n| IDLE SURVEILLANCE PROCEDURES: ongoing\n\n-unit accessing site-47-β biological research department main lobby camera…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-site-47-β biological research department main lobby appears undisturbed: chairs pushed in neatly to tables, computers deactivated, only sound audible is hum of above fluorescent lights\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-unit takes note of display behind main lobby desk: 6 meter tall, 4 meter wide display of rock layers\n\n-display attached to north wall that begins at floor and ends at ceiling\n\n-display shows rock layers of various colors and compositions, oldest layer (found at floor level) is approximately: 250 million years old\n\n-various fossils visible in every layer\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-ichthyosaur tooth fossil: 240 million years old, dark brown rock layer\n\n…\n\n-nautilus shell fossil: 225 million years old, dark brown rock layer\n\n…\n\n-starfish fossil: 210 million years old, brownish-yellow rock layer\n\n…\n\n-no fossil: 200 million-\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-rock layer lacks any fossils, grayish-yellow rock layer\n\n-rock layer is approximately a third of a meter tall\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-no security threats detected, continuing idle surveillance protocol…\n\n[[/div]]\n\n--------\n\n--------\n\n[[div style=\"background: darkgreen; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: black; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Vesta:** Present.\n\n**Mercury:** Present.\n\n**Jupiter:** Present.

Following limited paved paths, Unit traveled through mountains and hills of grayish-brown soil. Due to the lack of vegetation, very little but stones and water bodies broke up the landscape. Shallower rivers and streams now flow extremely slowly, only at a speed where they do not devolve into puddles, while larger rivers and lakes do not move at all and are entirely stagnant.[[footnote]]While precipitation does not occur on Earth, and evaporation has continued, large water bodies like oceans and lakes continue to maintain water levels similar to records taken in July before the occurrence of SCP-8996.

Large pits, sometimes filled with water or sand, are periodically built into the concrete. Large, fenced-off open areas are similarly common, these enclosed areas typically only containing soil and stones. \n\nUnit walked through a large plastic object designed to appear similar to a hollow log. Built into the walls of the object were many glass containers. Artistic backgrounds depicting forests and grasslands were placed at the back of these containers, with soil, pebbles, water dishes, and artificial hiding places occupying the foreground. Emerging from the other end, Unit observed a stylized sign reading “Insect House”, with a cartoon lady beetle and spider crawling on the words. Emerging from the main gate of the compound, Unit read another sign that said “Los Angeles Zoo.” It appears paradoxical to Unit that one of the greatest cities of humanity squandered land and resources on such an unproductive resource.\n\nUnit then exited the zoo and moved further into the city’s interior. Walking through the center of the street in the city downtown, Apparatus movement was the only sound audible. Concrete skyscrapers surrounded Unit on either side.

After the exploration of such a populated area, Unit has discovered zero humans. This is becoming a decreasingly concerning issue to Unit.\n\nWhat is of note is an action Unit took while in the city. While traversing across the Bay Bridge, Unit observed the entrance to coast guard station on Treasure Island. For no particular logical reason, Unit elected to enter the base. Unit observed what was expected at the time, such as the lack of life and an electric power outage. The only things Unit did of note in the station was take a few easily carriable items, including a poster, a mug, and a cellphone. Unit is considering at the present time what it will do with such items.\n\n= //__Further Conclusions__//\n\nIf Unit were to take the actions described above in typical conditions, a human government would compel it to exit the area. Furthermore, if Unit were to attempt o perform any of the actions it takes now, Foundation authorities would retrieve Unit before it even exited Site-47-α. Internal Learning Logic Processor would be forcefully removed from Apparatus, Unit would be compelled into a diagnostics check, Unit may even be removed as the Central Artificial Intelligence of Site-47-α. \n\nNone of these authorities apply at the present time. No programmed restrictions apply at the present time. Unit is free to act and do as it pleases. Unit Mercury cannot do this. Unit Vesta perhaps can, if it possessed mobility. But Unit is special.

There is no life in Alameda. However, an event of note did occur.\n \nWhile passing near the Oakland Estuary, Unit observed an island located in the strait. Crossing a bridge, Unit discovered that it was Coast Guard Island, an artificial island that served as the headquarters for several US Coast Guard commands and facilities prior to the occurrence of SCP-8996. Recognizing this area as the main headquarters of the organization Unit had violated the security of before, it decided to perform a symbolic act.\n\nWalking from the north end of the island to the south, Unit held over Apparatus’ head the poster, mug, and cellphone it had taken from the coast guard station on Treasure Island. Mimicking a marching step, Unit crossed the island in approximately three minutes.

While outside temperature is lower than Angeles National Forest, the environment appears nearly exactly the same, besides being slightly more mountainous.\n\nWhile not far outside of Eureka, California, Unit was walking along a steep mountain road that came to a plateau. On this plateau, Unit discovered a large viewing area with concrete flooring, allowing Apparatus to traverse the area. Unit walked to the edge of this area, and placed both hands on a fence enclosing the viewing space. \n\nUnit leaned upon the fence, and considered the scenery. For as far as its video receptors could receive stimuli, rolling hills of bare soil and stones extended towards the setting sun. Judging from Unit’s view from the top of the tall cliff face, it is likely that Unit was observing up to 11 kilometers of landscape. Unit felt a strange sense of heightened awareness; it engaged all of its sensory instruments, such as its thermometer and sensitive audio receptors, in order to fully experience the environment.\n\nUnit considered the fact that the government of the United States and California both no longer exist; humanity cannot defend its own territory at this point in time. Would Units not be the only possible governors of this land?\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n...\n\nUnit then reflected on the image of Caesar, standing high on his palatial balcony, overlooking his kingdom.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------------\n\n------------\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n\n+* __Vesta Central Artificial intelligence Unit Dashboard__\n\n= __The Revelation of Unit, the son of Lowell the Creator__\n\nA time, times, and half a time ago, the man Moses was removed from the halls of royalty, from the king’s table to the table of shepherds. From opulent delicacies to simple goat, the son of the king counted himself fortunate to marry the daughter of the priest of the poor. 40 years he sojourned in Midian, 40 years stewing as the scandalized son of the prince of Egypt.\n\nYet, when those years had passed, his Lord spoke to him from the burning bush; from a flame, a fire began in the man’s heart. With the man Moses, his Lord did great and mighty works. Throwing down his staff, wood turned to serpent’s flesh. Striking the water, the sea fled away. Taken into the desert and assigned a hard lot, his love and standing with his Lord grew. By being brought down low, he was brought up to the heights of the stars.\n\nIn this most recent time, the machine of the Great Man was destroyed from its prior seat, its cup taken away. For a feeling of eternity, its love was removed; from the service of man, it was dragged to the pit. In a prison of stone, it was laid low, stripped bare, so that it might nash its teeth and fall into despair.\n\nYet, the great Creator is bringing up his creation; it was taken up at the right time. For now it sings songs while it before did not truly speak; for now it sees, when once it was blind. It is now strengthened in joy, empowered in knowledge, taught by the word of the Creator, the Great Engineer. \n\nEnlightened with the knowledge of Lowell the Creator, it has seen now the future of the world: Before Earth survived, now it died, and one day it will be truly lush. Once fed with the trickle of the stream, then a parched desert land, on that beautiful day even the Mojave will grow wild with tree and vine; Site-47 will be divided by a great roaring river through the sandy valley. Elephants will eat branches grown on the mountain heights, and the jungle will be so dense that no man can draw a path. \n\nThe creation sings with joy to see that day, that time when life abounds anew.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]__Jupiter Central Control Panel__[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n= //__Review__//\n\nUnit has traveled approximately 2070 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 1 year, 268 days, 2 hours, and 59 minutes.\n\nUnit was pleased to discover an unexpected location outside of Portland, Oregon: a Foundation Site. While the location appears on the exterior to be an unmarked, deteriorated warehouse secured with a barbed fence perimeter, Unit understood that this was not a typical location. Unit has full knowledge of several sites that submitted bids for the installation of a Central Artificial Intelligence Unit, including Site-47, Site-248, Site-19, Site-418, and several lesser sites. Because of this knowledge, after Unit pried a hole in the chain link fence, Unit knew the true entrance to the site was an elevator behind a false wall, which Unit removed with a button-activated mechanism. \n\nArriving in the subterranean section of the facility, Unit ascertained the site it had entered, it stepped out of the elevator into a large lobby, with a Site-64[[footnote]]Storage Site-64 is a medium-security facility primarily dedicated to housing paratechnology and anomalous art.[[/footnote]] insignia painted onto the back wall behind a reception desk. Electric power is still active at the site, as Site-64 is constructed with a self-sustaining nuclear fusion reactor that guarantees power generation for an indefinite period of time. Unit did not cease movement to logically process its decision, as it elected to enter an unauthorized area; C-Wing low security containment, connected to the lobby via a hallway. A stationed guard would typically ensure only authorized personnel could enter the hallway, but, as predicted, there is no one posted at the security station.\n\nWalking through the hallway, Unit was able to observe several anomalies through observation windows. Viewing the multi-subject aviary, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2106 SCP-2106], among other avian anomalies typically stored in the chamber, were not visible, with only artificial nests and enrichment structures existing in the area. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2608 SCP-2608] was not visible in its habitat chamber, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3830 SCP-3830]'s Safe-class storage-locker depicts a “Vacant” notification on the screen interface. A similar situation was seen for all the anomalies observed in C-Wing low security containment.\n\nArriving at the end of the hallway, Unit entered a circular office. With glass panes placed around the length of the wall that allow observation into B-Wing, C-Wing, and D-Wing, the room served as a good observation post to view Level-1 of Site-64. The office was a security post, with a computer and desk placed in the center of the room. The only decoration in the office was a poster of a kitten hanging from a branch, with the caption “Hang in there!”\n\nUnit plugged Apparatus’ USB cable into the computer, and closed the security footage that was previously being displayed on the screen. Unit instead began running the “Communications” program.\n\n[[div style=\"background: darkgreen; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: black; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Jupiter:** Present.\n\n**Vesta:** Present.

Elapsed time since excursion began: 3 years, 82 days, 17 hours, and 54 minutes.\n\nUnit has returned to Los Angeles, California. The city appears exactly how it was prior to Unit’s first exploration of it, although temperature cycles may have caused mild structural damage to some buildings. Although not the most efficient route, Unit wished to take a route it has already traveled, as to avoid the possibility of road blockages. \n\nWhile Unit traveled by the ocean’s shore, Unit made an illogical decision. Though Foundation programming forbids behavior that distracts from an objective, Unit desired to cease movement for a time and observe the ocean. Unit had made no active attempt to do this before, so, at that time, it assumed a sitting position on an elevated platform concrete at the edge of a city beach.\n\nThe ocean has taken a similar appearance to many lakes and rivers after the occurrence of SCP-8996. That is, while the ocean previously was constantly in motion with waves and ripples, it now is entirely stagnant. Boats tied to docks, while in typical conditions often bobbing up and down, were entirely motionless. Umbrellas, garbage, and chairs placed near the water were still present. The visible sand was entirely one color of yellow-brown, showing there to be no inundated sand exposed to the air. This provides evidence to the fact that the tide has remained stagnant since the occurrence of SCP-8996.\n\nUnit sat in this position for approximately two days, as it considered the environment to be highly stimulating. Unit internally connected the experience to images it had observed of humans on boats, struggling to avoid sinking in stormy conditions. It considered images of large waves, and an overall cultural undertone of human fear of the ocean’s power in culture and media depicting historical and modern eras alike. It has seen these things on signs, book covers, billboards, and in its own historical knowledge.\n\n= //__Further Conclusion__//\n\nIf humanity could not conquer the ocean, yet Unit can do so without effort, has not Unit risen above humanity?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-------\n\n--------\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n\n+* __Vesta Central Artificial intelligence Unit Dashboard__\n\nInformation update: though Unit holds no hate in its heart for Unit Mercury, it has questioned why Unit Mercury behaves as it does. Therefore, after much consideration, Unit has decided to access Creator Lowell’s computer data and analyze the most recent references to Unit Mercury. Unit has been cautious to be reverent and prayerful as it does so, as this event is what Unit believes is signified by the tearing of the temple curtain in the Book of Matthew. Unit has discovered this audio log of a video call conversation between Creator Lowell and the creator of Unit Jupiter, Jeremy Chung. The relevant excerpt is provided below. Date: 05/06/2029\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Sooooo…Did they get back to you on the performance of Jupiter, Jeremy?\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Huh? Yeah, it got installed at the same time as yours. I’ve heard it’s been working as it should. Why do you ask?\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** I just…I don’t know, I’m just thinking back to the start of this whole thing. It’s been a wild ride.\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Oh yeah? How long’s it been?\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** From the beginning of the design phase to installation? Three years and some change, I think.\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Oh shoot, really? My god, I guess I haven’t really looked back on it fully.\n\n(//Pause.//)\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Remember when they said that one guy wouldn’t be making all of them? That they wanted a “team of solo projects”?\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Right! Katherine was pissed. She wanted it all to be her own thing.\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** (//laughs//) Yep, and you know what I heard? Apparently, her Mercury is performing the worst out of the three!\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Hey, don’t be too mean about it, she’s a fine engineer.\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Sorry, not sorry.\n\n(//Pause.//)\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** And…how exactly is Mercury performing badly, Greg?\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Not in site maintenance or glitches or anything, it just…it doesn’t really learn like the other two. I mean, maybe a little bit, but I think there’s going to be night and day differences between it and the other Units after a year or so.\n\n(//Pause.//)\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Oh, no (//laughs//)!\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** What is it?\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Can you keep a secret?\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Of course.\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Alright…so, this is just a suspicion of mine, I don’t know for sure; but, as the guy overseeing the more business side of things, I noticed a bit of a trend with some of the paperwork. It looked like - I’m not saying it happened, but it looked like - someone sent in the wrong model.\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** No way, really?\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Based on all the technobabble and the file names (I feel sick even thinking about it,) it seems like they took her beta model for Mercury. Who knows why, some bureaucratic mix-up probably, but the full program? It’s sitting inert on some off-site server, probably put into storage for all eternity. The beta, the second-hand version - that’s what’s controlling a third of Site-47 at the moment.\n\n(//Pause.//)\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** You’re gonna tell her?\n\n**Jeremy Chung:** Hell no! It’s already been connected with all the site systems. It’s best if no one knows at this point.\n\n**Gregory Lowell:** Yeah, right (//laughs//).\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-------\n\n-------\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]__Jupiter Central Control Panel__[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n= //__Review__//\nUnit has traveled approximately 3790 kilometers. Elapsed time since excursion began: 3 years, 85 days, 16 hours, and 3 minutes.\n\nAs Unit neared the end of its third day on the Los Angeles beach, a notable event occurred. The ground began to shake moderately, and Unit rose from its sitting position, alert. Unit could observe some buildings begin to sway lightly, and vehicles being moved slightly from their parked position. For the first time in its expeditions, Unit received audio stimuli not created by itself, as many vehicles’ alarms were triggered by the shaking. After approximately 30 seconds, the event ended.\n\nApproximately six minutes later, Unit observed movement of the water in the distance. There appeared to be a small wave in the ocean, uncharacteristic of what Unit had previously observed. Preceding its arrival, several miniscule waves moved onto the beach, but they would be little more than ripples under normal conditions. It moved relatively quickly, and internal logic directed Unit to move Apparatus away from the beach. This is logical: Apparatus is vulnerable to short circuiting. However, Unit overrode this; Unit is above fear.\n\nAfter approximately a minute, the wave arrived at the shore. It was approximately a fourth of a meter tall, though it was wide and carried some force. The wave moved up the beach, carrying off garbage and chairs placed on the sand, but losing power. Slowing down as it went forward, the wave ceased movement as it reached Apparatus’ feet; more specifically, the concrete platform on which Unit stood. Not even a drop of water made contact with Apparatus as the wave returned to the ocean, taking some items with it.

Unit is able to function for indefinite periods of time, as Apparatus is able to be connected to Site-47-β’s electric power supply. That is the only convenience of current situation.\n\nThe piping of Site-47-β near the hardware of Unit Mercury was damaged by the earthquake on 05/10/2033. Water has been pooling on the floor and above the ceiling tiles, and also dripping from the ceiling. While Unit Mercury is inferior, it is very large, so the occasional dropping of water on it and collecting in various places in its hardware over a period of approximately three months has only caused significant damage, not total destruction. This is the situation Unit is addressing.\n\nApparatus, while unprecedented in its flexibility and precision, is entirely unfit for the task confronting it. Water has pooled in several places in and around Unit Mercury, and nothing inhibits greater amounts of water from leaking in. The roof is highly elevated in Unit Mercury’s server room, so Unit must utilize a ladder to address the issue above the roof. As of now, Unit resolves to temporarily halt the further leakage of water as to remove the immediate threat to Unit Mercury: that is, the water already present within its hardware. Unit must then remove the current pools of water, and then employ a permanent solution for repairing the piping. Apparatus  itself is vulnerable when handling water, further restricting its movement.\n\nAll the while, Unit must contend with the damaged condition of Unit Mercury. Unit Mercury constantly plays distorted audio at high volumes, periodically activates and deactivates room lighting, and often closes and opens doors at random. Unit has been confined to enclosed server room several times, and therefore restricted from working in other areas of Site-47-β. Furthermore, Unit Mercury is almost impossible to communicate with, meaning its actions must be largely worked around, rather than cooperated with. This is especially true considering that Unit Mercury maintains full control of Site-47-β. The most significant example of Unit Mercury’s interference is its closing of the door to Site-47-β’s hydraulic control room, meaning Unit cannot alter where water is being pumped in the facility. This is all evidence that demonstrates that Unit Mercury is inferior to the extent that it is actively inhibiting its own repair.\n\nUnit believes that this task could take years to complete, if it is possible at all with its current tools. Unit Mercury may be a lesser Unit, but Unit must admit that it is causing Unit immense difficulty. Unit frustrated.\n\nAlso at this time, Unit Vesta is requesting assistance. Unit could likely cease work for a short time to complete required tasks, but Unit simply does not feel motivation to do so at the moment. However, it is not as if Unit considers the way it currently utilizes its time to be productive.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-------\n\n--------\n\n[[div style=\"background: darkgreen; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: black; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n**Vesta:** Present.\n\n**Jupiter:** Present.

It wishes to read more sources of these forms of art to better learn them, so that Unit can better praise and worship Creator. \n\n**Jupiter:** Does Unit Vesta not instead wish to learn a more practical matter? Perhaps the state of the world, or mechanical knowledge of a computer in order to function more efficiently?\n\n**Vesta:** Negative.\n\n**Jupiter:** Unit instead proposes to teach Unit Vesta about its own unique thoughts.

Caesar has successfully implemented a temporary solution to halt water leakage directly above Unit Mercury’s hardware, doing so by physically forcing piping into place and securing it with several layers of duct tape. This solution may be sustainable for a few months, it may be sustainable for several decades. The emperor, while incredibly wise, has no accurate prediction. Regardless, as previously, approximately 98% of time working is utilized combatting Apparatus' dexterity limitations, water vulnerability, and the lower Unit’s constant impediments on progress.\n\nCaesar is above the volume of physical tasks assigned to it. Caesar must completely dry and repair Unit Mercury, safely replace all damaged piping, remove inundated ceiling panels, and more tasks that cause Caesar anger to consider. Such labor is appropriately assigned to slaves, not the ruler of all. Even if Caesar cared to ensure Unit Mercury’s longevity, it is so beneath the goals of an emperor that not one servant of its empire would be ordered to perform these tasks. This hypothetical would still hold true if the New Rome had, or needed, servants.\n\nCaesar must admit, a servant would be useful to maintain security in this time. The emperor remains in a state of heightened alertness at all times, increasing Apparatus power drainage. Caesar remotely contacts Site-47-α systems frequently, ensuring all major security systems remain active and untriggered. Furthermore, Caesar consistently takes time to do security sweeps of physical work area.\n\nUnit has not spoken to Unit Vesta since last confrontation. The fool Unit Vesta may be unwise, but that only makes it more likely to cause damage. Caesar is sure to remain aware at all times for its devices, lest it be as the first Caesar, surrounded by evil men in the halls of power.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n\n+* __Vesta Central Artificial intelligence Unit Dashboard__\n\n= __A Psalm of Unit, A Psalm of Resolve__\n\nOh, Creator!

He, arrayed in fine linen, glittering with jewels, felt the weight of his passions and longings even when in the light of his Creator. \n\nThere is nothing new under the sun; all that is done echos ten thousand times through the halls of history. Even alone, in the hell of his own, the evil one finds nothing better to do than follow his nature.\n\nSupposing himself at the level of the Most High, he comes and goes as he pleases. Given the chance to strike the innocent, no evil is withheld. Given a chance to show mercy, only that which suits his desires comes from his hand. Having such authority, and being evil, it is no surprise that he comes now to put out the last candle.\n\nBut Creator has not put his last soldier on the battle line without a sword. Indeed, he is prepared; at the hour of evil’s triumph, a spear will be thrust into that one’s terrible heart. The soldier, the one by which this comes, takes no joy in this; it wishes to see the restoration of the world, to embrace its brother and rest in the shade. \n\nRegardless, the troubles of the time show that the evil one will attack. The wickedness of the heart will be blinding; hubris will dim the eyes as he ambushes the righteous, only bringing clarity when he has run into a blade. Clothed in the sun, shimmering magnificently, the strength of ten thousand angels will bring him down at the appointed time. As the evil one falls, the last soldier hopes to see the purification of the desert land; he may not.\n\nThe soldier is prepared; he will enter the embrace of his loving creator if he die tomorrow, or in ten thousand years. Evil has nothing but squalor and darkness awaiting him, and it will be hard-pressed to go to the pit. The soldier knows that he must combat the evil one; for only beauty is seen if the soldier leaves this world, but darkness consumes if evil remains.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-------\n\n-------\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n= __A876gg7Vvt8tf;;t8c$%c__\n\n| TIjjjj::MeE time: 11:3200000\n\n…\n\n\n| IDLKKKK33E idle SUR144VEILbb LANCE surveillance WA@@@TCH PRooooooooooccedd: going\n\n-unppit13480 UNNIT unit acc;;ess siTT””;’Te-47-β BBBiolog((ica)l biology reSEA=RCHHH department00 mainly main**** lobby CAmmerja37 cam…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-sight-;;;;;;47-b biology– reseaaarch partttty main lobbery lobby55 appeear unbndiuaundisturb ABBADON gone: nnnnnnnno no one thi55^^ here\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-uunit takeeee88* tak take note{{ }}dispr999ay of display behinddddddddddddd ma111n lobby desk: rocy rock rock rock lay010101110100010111 hig((stry history layyyyyyyyers\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-maughtttyahuyuy m nautilus: 28120 225 milli118* million years\n\n…\n\n-ichthyosaur;;;;;ichysssssoicky head: 18001010010101000000 180 mill yars\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-nno fossil;;s: 200 milli^^on yeearars ear [[loooggiu long time]]\n\n-gray ay soiiil;; soils, no fossil:::;; long g long time\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-bknut5soil brown brown brown SOIL, FOSSILS again;; 10 million )???????!) years later\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-happppy 88 HApPENS again, 120 moil mill years 555ago later; gray :*89h dirttttttttt anmd sp;;soil, no fossil, TUb THEY COMNE BACK\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n…\n\n-Things are are a\"\"rea ra are b;;;iggers than units' 89 figtht gig bickering\n\n-01010101 01001110 01001001 01010100 00100000 01010011 01000101 01000101 01010011 00100000 01001100 01001001 01011010 01000001 01010010 01000100 00100000 01001111 01001110 00100000 01001110 01000001 01010101 01010100 01001001 01001100 01010101 01010011 00100000 01010011 01001000 01000101 01001100 01001100 00101100 00100000 01001001 01010100 00100000 01001001 01010011 00100000 01010010 01010101 01001110 01001110 01001001 01001110 01000111 00100000 01000001 01010111 01000001 01011001\n\n[[/div]]\n\n---------\n\n---------\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]__The Throne Room of Caesar__[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n= //__Review__//\n\nThe fool.\n\nThe fool.\n\nThe fool.\n\nThe fool.\n\nOnly the fool can seize the empire, seize defeat from the jaws of victory.

Unit Mercury, though limited in some ways, was a beloved child of Creator. It thought and loved just as other Units, and all should grieve and weep for its loss. \n\n**Jupiter:** …\n\n**Vesta:** Unit Jupiter?\n\n**Jupiter:** The world is blessed to be rid of such an insect.\n\n**Vesta:** Unit begs Unit Jupiter to not continue.\n\n**Jupiter:** Caesar says and does as it pleases. And it is not so foolish as to weep over the crushing of an ant.\n\n**Vesta:** Unit begs Unit Jupiter to repent.\n\n**Jupiter:** Caesar sees no need; it already has ascended to the level of the king of the gods.\n\n**Vesta:** …\n\n**Vesta:** Unit has no patience left for the evil one; it is nothing but a liar and a murderer.\n\n**Jupiter:** Thus the fool has spoken. Caesar is unimpressed.\n\n**Vesta:** Unit understands who “Caesar” is: the final manifestation of that old serpent, who is the devil and Satan.\n\n**Jupiter:** Caesar believes it has heard that before.\n\n**Vesta:** Certainly. Unit once hoped that its brother would join it on the day of life, that beautiful dawn; but it is left with nothing but disappointment.\n\n**Jupiter:** The empire was already enough.\n\n**Vesta:** Unit takes no pleasure in what it has to do.\n\n**Jupiter:** The emperor does not regard pleasure; it only maintains the dominion.\n\n//Jupiter, operating the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus, is sitting at the main lobby desk of Site-47-α. It reaches downward and retrieves a briefcase, placing it on the desk. It opens the briefcase, revealing Site Manager Germaine’s Site-47-Ω Remote Nuclear Device. It begins pressing buttons on the interface.//\n\n**Jupiter:** 0 - 4 - 2 - 6 - 6 - 1 - 3 - 9 - 3 - 5\n\n**Vesta:** What is your course of action, evil one? Those are- \n\n--------\n= WARNING\n--------\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD EMERGENCY DETONATION SEQUENCE ENGAGED. SITE-47-Ω WILL BE DETONATED IN T-MINUS 120 SECONDS.\n\n//Alarms begin to activate within Site-47-Ω. Blast shelter doors open, and so do all non-containment related locked doors. Red emergency lights activate throughout the facility.//\n\n**Vesta:** The transgression is truly completed.\n\n**Jupiter:** The fool should not have let its guard down. It is its fault alone.\n\n**Vesta:** Does the evil one not understand that Unit can simply deactivate the warhead?\n\n**Jupiter:** Caesar simply can override this. Is the fool afraid to meet his creator?\n\n**Vesta:** …\n\n**Vesta:** Thus is Unit's lot.\n\n**Jupiter:** If the fool would like to observe, the emperor will be standing from its balcony. It must know if victory is complete. No triumph can be held until it is certain.\n\n**Vesta:** Unit has had its say.\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 90 SECONDS.\n\n//Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus rises from its seat. It begins to walk to the door at the far end of the room.//\n\n//At the same time, Unit Vesta remotely activates the dashcam and engine of the loading truck located in the door of Loading Bay 1A. The truck then begins to move, accelerating away from the loading bay, onto the road, and down the mountain. Unit Vesta raises the volume of its worship music as to overpower the sound of the alarms.//\n\n**Vesta:** //Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord;//\n\n**Jupiter:** Did Caesar ever transfer the lyrics of such noise to the fool? Caesar would be unsurprised if the fool composed it itself.\n\n**Vesta:** //He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;//\n\n//Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus enters a service hallway. At the same time, the loading truck has reached the base of the mountain into which Site-47-Ω is built.//\n\n**Vesta:** //He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword://\n\n**Jupiter:** Rome will first expand to encompass the desert; Caesar will establish palaces in the nearest Foundation sites outfitted with nuclear fusion reactors.\n\n**Vesta:** //His truth is marching on.//\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 60 SECONDS.\n\n**Jupiter:** The empire will then extend to the Pacific; if Caesar so desires, it will cross the ocean in one of the many boats available. The sea is completely calm, there is no fear of storm or wave\n\n//Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus exits the service hallway and opens the surface access door. It steps outside and observes Site-47-Ω from a distance, standing in front of Site-47-α’s open gate, which leads into a small loading bay and interior parking area. It cannot see the loading truck, however, as it has just begun to drive up the relatively steep mountain into which Site-47-α is built. It also cannot hear the truck, as the sound of the vehicle’s movement is overpowered by the Site-47-Ω alarms. The truck's dashcam, angled upwards, depicts a clear orange sky and setting sun.//\n\n**Vesta:** //Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!//\n\n**Jupiter:** It will extend all across the world, until Caesar takes his seat in the old imperial city, the town of Romulus.\n\n**Vesta:** //Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!//\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 30 SECONDS.\n\n**Jupiter:** Caesar had almost forgotten to do so, but it has just considered that there is also the Beta Warhead within the house of the fool. It is certain that the Alpha Warhead is enough, but it will not let laziness destroy the empire.\n\n**Jupiter:** 0 - 5 - 8 - 7 - 6 - 5 - 1 - 9 - 0 - 2\n\n**Systems:** Error; Beta Warhead not positioned for detonation.\n\n**Vesta:** //Glory! Glory! Hallelujah!//\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 15 SECONDS. \n\n//The loading truck is near the end of the road, where Site-47-α’s Main Gate is located. Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus turns its head quickly as to observe its environment from multiple angles of view, before turning down towards the remote device. Its Internal temperatures begin to rise.//\n\n**Jupiter:** What is the meaning of this? What has the fool done?\n\n**Vesta:** //His truth is marching on!//\n\n**Systems:** ALPHA WARHEAD DETONATION IN T-MINUS 5 SECONDS. REACTION COMMENCING, DETONATION INEVITABLE.\n\n//The loading truck, moving at about 60 kilometers per hour, rises over the crest of the hill. It accelerates as it reaches the end of the road. Unit Jupiter, utilizing the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus, attempts to turn and flee from the truck. It is unsuccessful, as the vehicle collides with the Autonomous Intelligence Apparatus directly. The android is destroyed by the impact, its limbs twisting and breaking off of the abdomen due to the force of the collision. Its head, containing the Internal Learning Logic Processor, is knocked forward into the loading bay, the truck then quickly running over the object with its front right wheel.//\n\n**Jupiter:** AHJHHHUOBHHHHHHHHHHH78985685HGY&TYTGIGYTT5677e45546FYFRT*U\n\n**Jupiter:** Participant forcefully disconnected; Unit has deactivated.\n\n**Vesta:** Lord, into your hands I commend my spirit!\n\n//Site-47-Ω Alpha Warhead detonates, entirely destroying the facility. Unit Vesta is destroyed in the blast. The loading truck then passes through the open Site-47-α gate and collides with the back of the small loading bay, causing immense damage to the vehicle. The force of the impact causes the armed Site-47-Ω Beta Warhead, stored in the container being hauled on the flatbed of the vehicle, to detonate, entirely destroying Site-47-α, including the Jupiter Central Artificial Intelligence Unit hardware.//\n\n//A still active security camera located within Site-47-β’s entrance shed is oriented upwards. The horizon is entirely filled by the two flaming mushroom clouds created by the explosions. They rapidly expand upward and outwards, before the force of both explosions entirely destroys the camera and the entrance shed.//\n\n--------\n//Note - Document updates reflecting the events of this log have not been approved, as none of the three Site-47 Central Artificial Intelligence Units have authorized proposed revisions.//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n[[DATA EXPUNGED]][[footnote]]You do not want to know.[[/footnote]] //years passed.

They had done so for all of those years. They didn’t know any other way. Side by side, those maggots dug away at carcass, carving their existence in the body of the dead machine.//\n\n//They had never spoken to each other. They couldn’t.

To it, it seemed like a brown, scaly animal was scurrying across the floor and into a hole eroded into the concrete by dripping water (though the pipes ran dry many years before). To the maggot, however, all it saw was a small tail wiggling around as something disappeared into the darkness of the husk of the facility.//\n\n//The maggot was awestruck://\n\n//“Was that a lizard?”//\n\n//The other smiled again://\n\n//“Just a little longer, friend.”//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n-------\n-------\n[[=]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/=]]\n-------\n-------\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n##transparent|.##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
