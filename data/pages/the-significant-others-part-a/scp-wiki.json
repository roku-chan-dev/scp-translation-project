A familiar voice growled at him from the bedside table, but he didn't look and he didn't really listen.\n\nWhen he felt the slippers sliding on tile, he slowed his pace. When he bumped his knees against the towel draped over the sink cabinet doors he stopped, took a deep breath, and opened his eyes once more.\n\nThe washroom mirror was filled with a dull grey face which wasn't his, and it was screaming silently from a mouth which wasn't really a mouth but was really a jagged gash in its wrinkled, overlarge skull. Two more scars, these ones vertical, flexed open and closed like madly blinking alien eyes as the mouth-gash rippled and the monster in the mirror continued its mute roar.\n\n\"Good morning, Doug,\" he said to it as the roar became audible, steadily increasing in both volume and pitch.\n\nHe reached for his toothbrush.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **7:29 AM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"JM64,\" he said. \"[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5056 Philip E.

Phil looked up.\n\n\"Oh. Hey, Dr. Blank. You're up early.\"\n\nHarold Blank was a slightly podgy, more than slightly disheveled middle-aged man with too much facial hair, too much hair in general and a pair of too-large black-rimmed eyeglasses. He clapped Phil on the back, too hard, and said \"Got a lot of work to do. It's apocalypse eve in the Great Underground Empire, you know.\"\n\nPhil blinked.\n\n\"Wow. Did you actually forget?\" Dr. Blank's bushy, unplucked eyebrows went up a notch.\n\nPhil looked down at his tablet. //September 7.// \"Well,\" he said. \"Shit.\"\n\n\"Yep.

It was swimming with a heterochrome gas, dark orange and lime green, and there were specks of what looked like ash suspended within it. There was also a tiny grey face attached to a tiny grey torso, the rest of its body lost around the receding edge. It was pulling a ridiculous face at him.\n\n\"Eighteen years is what, porcelain?\" said Phil, flashing his light on the pipe. The gas colours inverted; the specks disappeared; the apparition was momentarily obscured. \"I'll get him a coffee cup, let him go for a swim in the morning.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **7:29 PM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"Give it to me.\"\n\nSeveral obvious responses jockeyed for Phil's attention; he carefully selected none of them. \"Orphic outflow's recondite-positive again,\" he said instead, scrolling aimlessly on the tablet.\n\n\"No big surprise there.\" Amelia Torosyan, Janitorial and Maintenance Section Chief for [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43], leaned back in her cheap plastic chair. \"What with the big bang tomorrow, and all.\"\n\n\"Yup yup.\" He blinked; he sighed. \"Can you read the rest of this?\" He held out the tablet.\n\n\"Sure,\" she said, sitting forward again. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Doug.\" His voice was flat. \"The whole screen was Doug.\"\n\nAmelia nodded. \"I wondered where he went.\" She glanced at the wall-mounted mirror to her left; it once again contained a glowering grey figure, peering intensely at the man with the wire-framed glasses and salt-and-pepper stubble standing in front of her desk.\n\nPhil watched her perusing the concise details of his day's activity, dimly aware that Doug was emitting a low hum which was making his teeth vibrate.\n\n//Your teeth are vibrating,// he thought. //Your teeth are vibrating and you're only dimly aware of it.//\n\nHe was fully, painfully aware, as he always was, that Amelia Torosyan was beautiful.

He could feel his colour rising; he turned to go. \"The stick up your ass is shorter than the ones the other Chiefs have.\"\n\n\"Sentence structure,\" she said.

It fogged up. //Fuck.// He knelt down to retrieve the hose.\n\nThe concentration cell in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D was, theoretically, the most dangerous of an incredibly dangerous series of rooms. It was two cubic metres of untreated concrete, stained pitch black, accessible only from the vault-locked door which yawned open behind him. There were all of two things in the room: his own augmented self and the wheeled metal frame he'd brought with him, in which he now stood. It hummed slightly.\n\nHe reached over his shoulder and turned the faucet on the tank slung across his back, and the hose shuddered to life. Nothing visible came out; it was coming out with a great deal of force, however, and a growing pool of thick white fluid now pooled beneath his feet.\n\nHe raised the hose and cranked the faucet, hard.\n\nA radiant spray of white //something// erupted from the empty space one foot in front of him, splattering on the black concrete and gradually lightening it. He extended the hose so that the nozzle was outside of the frame; the abatement fluid was now visibly spurting from its tip. //Surely there's a way to describe that without it sounding filthy.// He pulled the nozzle back again; within the humming frame, the fluid again became invisible. It never got old, seeing that.\n\n\"Work is its own reward,\" he muttered. \n\nWhatever was in the hose was slowly dissolving whatever was making the concrete so dark. //Random wizard shit.// Acroamatic Abatement, what his colleagues called the Sorcery Sewer, was a vast refinery for what the Applied Occultism Section called \"esoteric effluence.\" This was the dreck produced by too many impossible artifacts and beings contained in too close proximity. //Magic statue cack, magic mask drool, magic bug sand, magic god goop.// AAF-D had been constructed to precise occult specifications, so that the otherworldly unpleasantness which would otherwise seep out and suffuse the entire facility manifested instead within this confined, controllable space. It had sloped floors, and it had a drain.\n\nPhil called it the Gunk Tank.\n\n//I'll try calling home again tonight,// he thought. He waved the hose back and forth, imagining he was watering a garden... no, conducting an orchestra. Tchaikovsky, maybe. He almost imagined he could hear the cannons, booming in the distance.\n\nHe could definitely hear the cannons. And they were getting closer.\n\n\"FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK\"\n\nPhil turned around, still blasting the whitening walls. The hallway beyond the vault door was brighter than it had been when he'd pushed the frame in; it was also upside-down.\n\nHe blinked.\n\nNo, it wasn't upside-down, it was... two-dimensional? No, it was three-dimensional. No, it was f-\n\nHe closed his eyes.\n\n\"FUCK FUCK __FUCK__ __FUCK__\"\n\nHe opened his eyes. A man he thought he recognized appeared in the vault door, wearing a Security and Containment agent's uniform, a terrified expression, and what appeared to be several men's worth of blood. No, it wasn't blood, not unless blood came in all colours of the rainbow at once.\n\nAs Phil stared at him, the not-blood turned a uniform vermillion and began drifting upwards, gently stippling the hallway's tile ceiling.\n\n\"What,\" said Phil, and then he stopped. He stopped because his hazmat suit had crumpled up against his body like a paper bag, and for a moment he thought he couldn't breathe. He also stopped because the man in the doorway had also crumpled up like a paper bag, only he wasn't wearing a suit.\n\nThere was a bright flash in the hallway, and the spray from the end of Phil's hose //ha ha// blew back against his face mask, obscuring his vision, and the last thing he thought was //Weird, I'm in the frame, I shouldn't be able to see that.//\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bf0000\"]]\n++ 9 September\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bf0000; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **6:15 AM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nHe opened his eyes.\n\n\"Good.

The walls were gleaming, glazed green tiles, and the floor was sparkling stained grey concrete. Phil had always hated cleaning it, but he figured it was one of Doug's favourite rooms in the Site; there were two dozen mirrors, plus a wide variety of vending machines, light fixtures, and even shiny, waxed tables to apparate upon.\n\nAt this late hour the room was almost empty. From the double doors, in the dim fluorescent light, Phil could only see one table that looked occupied. He walked into the self-serve nook to search the cabinets, vaguely hankering for something microwaveable. //Soup? Popcorn.//\n\n\"Evening, gents.\"\n\nHe looked back across the cavernous space, realized what he was looking at, and quickly closed the distance without remembering to shut the cabinet doors. \"You're up late,\" he said.\n\n\"Stupid thing to say, isn't it?\" asked Amelia. \"If you can see I'm up late, you're up late too.\" \n\nShe was sitting at a short green table beneath one of Doug's red-and-black mirrors, cradling a small styrofoam cup of noodles in both hands. She was still wearing her jumpsuit, and Phil suddenly realized he wasn't exactly at his best either in an old t-shirt, hooded sweater and track pants. //Please don't let there be any holes I don't know about.// \n\n\"You don't have a 'best', Philip.\" Doug was already in the mirror.\n\nAmelia pointed, raising an eyebrow quizzically.\n\nPhil sighed. \"He says I don't have a 'best'.\"\n\nShe frowned as he sat down across from her. \"That sounds like half a thought.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Mine.\"\n\n\"Still psychic after all these years.\" She dragged the pot of noodles in a circle on the tabletop, still massaging it with both hands; the soup tossed and swirled. \"It must be great, having someone who knows exactly what you're thinking about.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Phil looked at the mirror; Doug was gone. He looked back, then right, then straight up; the spectre was hovering over him, its ghastly figure distended by the lens of a security camera dome on the ceiling. //Welp,// he thought. //That feed'll be all fucked up tomorrow.// He made a mental note to check it in the morning.\n\nShe was smiling sadly at him, and he had a sudden desire to say something uncoupled from any particular sense of what he might say. \"We, uh. You haven't been in here much, lately.\"\n\nThe smile warmed significantly. \"We used to come here a lot.\"\n\n\"She pitied you.\"\n\nHe gently nudged her finger, pointing up at the camera, back onto the side of the noodle cup. \"Just imagine he's saying something mean about me. It won't be far off.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"I can't think of anything mean to say about you.\"\n\nHe grinned. \"Bullshit. You're nine-tenths snark.\"\n\n\"That's it, Philip. Push her away.\"\n\nShe was grinning now, too. \"You're the one with the snark. Or is he a boojum?\"\n\n\"If he was a boojum, I'd have disappeared. And if he was a snark, I'd be hunting him. Not the other way around.\"\n\nShe looked down at the cup. \"What sort of supernatural beastie do you figure he is, then?\"\n\n\"He's an anagazander.\"\n\nShe looked up. \"A //what?//\"\n\nHe felt sheepish. \"It's from an old song my parents used to sing to me. The only thing I know about anagazanders is, they roar. Doug roars; he used to roar a //lot,// but now it's mostly warm-up roars in the morning.\" He adjusted his glasses. \"These days he's more... existential horror. The evolution of the media is a glorious thing.\" He grimaced.\n\n\"I always thought of him as a predatory psychological complex,\" she said. \"I guess it doesn't help that he has access to all your worries and phobias.\"\n\nPhil ran one hand through his hair, conscious of how little there still was. \"And my hopes. The worries and phobias I can deal with, but the hopes, not so much.\"\n\n\"Any hopes in particular?\" Her voice was very quiet, now, her tone very soft.\n\nShe was looking at him sadly again, and he couldn't quite bear it. \"I hope some day they'll let me trade in my Employee of the Month Award for some vacation time.\"\n\nShe bit her lower lip. \"What?\"\n\n\"You've never heard me call him that?\" He pointed up at the camera. \"Maybe I should think of a new nickname. How do you feel about Long Service Award?\"\n\nShe pushed the noodles over to his side of the table. \"Here's your Long Service Award. You'll get a pizza at forty-two years.\"\n\n\"You're not hungry?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"These things are inedible. They've done tests.\" A few strands of hair came loose and caught on her features, and she started plucking at them. \"Just wanted to warm my hands up.\" \n\nHe nodded; he knew she had circulation problems.\n\n\"Anyway, people ask stupid questions when you're sitting in the cafeteria late at night by yourself with no food.\" She pulled her hands up into her sleeves.\n\nHe closed his fingers around the noodle pot and nodded. \"Like, 'Why are you sitting in the cafeteria late at night, by yourself, with no food?'\"\n\nShe nodded back at him. \"Yeah. Stupid questions like that.\"\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\n\"Amelia?\"\n\nHer eyes widened. She looked over his shoulder, towards the door, and gasped.\n\nPhil swung around in his chair as a tall, dark-haired man in a labcoat walked into the cafeteria. He was handsome and fit, and walked with a studied self-assurance. He was at the table in seconds, but Amelia was on her feet even faster.\n\nBefore Phil could say anything, the man reached out and cupped Amelia's chin with one hand, and Doug was already starting to speak when the man kissed her on the lips.\n\n\"You should stay and watch, Philip.\"\n\nThe kiss seemed to go on forever.\n\n\"So you can think about it later.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf\"]]\n++ 8 September\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **9:16 AM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"I told you,\" Eddie Simms crowed. \"They're expanding the systems for Arms and Equipment!\"\n\nPhil nodded, nursing his cup of coffee.\n\n\"That's more tech work for us,\" Eddie continued. \"And guess who just got his SCPT-12 certification?\" He jerked both thumbs at his own face.\n\nPhil nodded.\n\nEddie's thumbs remained in place.\n\nPhil pointed at him. \"That guy,\" he said.\n\nEddie grinned. \"Somebody's in a mood today.\"\n\nThe door to the Chief's office swung open, and Amelia Torosyan walked out with...\n\n\"Oh,\" said Eddie. \"You two know each other?\"\n\nPhil shook his head. \"Bumped into him.\" He'd tried to end the sentence with \"last night,\" but his mouth wasn't having it. \"Doctor Niemenin.\"\n\n\"Nils Niemenin,\" said Eddie, watching the researcher sweep out of the break room with Amelia in tow.

It won't stop.//\n\nIn the mirror on the containment chamber wall, the mirror monster was screaming its ugly head off. Its ugly head was thrown back, its ugly scars were wobbling as it warbled its awful, ugly song; he stared at it, glared at it, and noted without much caring that the scars seemed maybe an inch deep, and the flesh within them was a dull dark mauve.\n\n\n//Eggplant,// he thought, and he grasped at the thought as a drowning man grasps at a life preserver. //Eggplant bastard from hell, eggplant monster, screaming eggplant. Eggplant.//\n\n\"Eggplant,\" he muttered. He couldn't hear himself.\n\n\"What was that?\" said a voice from the ceiling.\n\nPhil uncoiled on the cot and stared up at the ceiling speaker from whence the non-screaming, non-eggplant voice had come. \"Eggpl... eggplant,\" he said, haltingly. He wasn't even sure he was saying the right word, under the mirror monster's roar. He was even less sure how he'd heard the voice from the speaker, or how it expected to hear him.\n\n\"Go on,\" said the voice from the speaker. He could definitely hear it.\n\n\"The scars,\" he said, slowly, taking great care with each syllable. \"The scars are... eggplant. Purple. Under... underneath. Purple.\"\n\n\"Your scars run darker and deeper, Philip,\" said the thing in the mirror. It was suddenly, blissfully, no longer screaming. Phil's ears weren't ringing, but his mind was.\n\n\"Oh,\" he said. \"Oh, thank god, it stopped.\"\n\n\"What stopped?\" said the voice from the speaker.\n\nPhil glared at it. \"What stopped?\" He jerked a wavering finger at the mirror. \"Eggplant fucker stopped!

It wasn't his usual J&M jacket and pants, of course; it was, he noted, what humanoid containment subjects usually wore, a bright green jumpsuit with a distinct lack of pockets. But it wasn't filthy, and neither was he, and that went a long way towards restoring his sense of reality.\n\nThe image of the eggplant monster on the shower floor, swimming in the pool that swirled around his feet, distending with the impact of each sheet or stream or drop of water, well, he was trying not to focus on that.\n\n//Here's sweat in your eyes,// he thought, as the guards led him back into the containment chamber. There was a shiny new black-and-white sign on the door: \"SCP-5056.\" This made him feel even better, for some reason; he decided not to focus on that either.\n\nThere were two doctors sitting at a metal table in the middle of the room. He recognized them both: Dr. Bradbury and Dr. Blank. They were research partners; Dr. Blank called them \"the B&B Commission.\" He told everyone it was a history joke. He had to, because nobody got it.\n\nDr. Blank was a slovenly mass of dark brown hair with glasses. Dr. Bradbury's hair was silver, but she looked very young. Her skin was perfect.\n\n\"Don't even bother,\" said a voice to his left. The mirror was still on the wall; he refused to look at it.\n\nBoth doctors were smiling at him. The smiles seemed genuine enough. \"Sit down,\" said Dr. Bradbury.\n\nPhil sat down.\n\n\"So, here's what's going to happen,\" said Dr. Blank. \"We're gonna try to to figure out where your new husband came from, and hopefully get you a divorce.\"\n\nDr. Bradbury nodded. \"We're going to run some tests. Nothing too taxing, nothing that should be dangerous to you. We need to know what we're dealing with.\"\n\nPhil squirmed. \"And if you can't figure it out?\"\n\nDr. Blank shrugged. \"We'll let you pick out a colour for the chamber walls.\"\n\nDr. Bradbury shook her head. \"Not without a security deposit, we won't.\"\n\nPhil blinked.\n\nBoth doctors folded their hands on the table simultaneously, still smiling at him.\n\nTo his surprise, he smiled back. \"Alright.

It was causing him actual, physical pain; his earbones were vibrating harder than they'd ever vibrated, his teeth were rattling on his jaw, his skull was buzzing like a sack of bees.\n\nThe test chamber's vault door finally swung open. In the hallway beyond, filling a mirror on the wall, the monster was shaking so intensely Phil couldn't even make out the craqueleured ridges of its eye-scars. Its madly fluttering mouth-scar, though, that he could definitely see.\n\nThe apparition was staring directly at him; it had apparently been doing so through the vault door. They made \"eye\" contact.\n\nIt stopped vibrating, its mouth stopped fluttering, and //the screeching also stopped.//\n\n\"██, █████ ███,\" said Dr. Blank.

Her face was streaked with tears. \"At least this time we could hear the damn thing.\"\n\nDr. Blank replaced his glasses. \"We certainly could.\"\n\nShe leaned heavily against the chamber wall. \"They heard it across the entire Site.\"\n\n\"I should think so.\"\n\nShe shook her head, wincing as she did so. \"No, I don't think you understand, Harry.

He was keeping his distance.\n\nPhil pushed the mop head up against the wall, pulled it back, pushed it up, slowly converting the spotless floor into a shiny spotless floor. \"It won't look at anybody, minus yours truly.\"\n\nAzad shook his head. \"I still can't believe this.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well. Join the club.\" Phil stretched, enjoying the familiar resistance of his old J&M jacket. It felt good to get out of the jumpsuit; he hated jumpsuits.\n\n\"Looks like a private club, from where I'm standing.\" Azad moved closer to the mirror, tensed up like a cat ready to spring back at a moment's notice.\n\n\"Speaking of where you're standing,\" said Phil, returning the mop to its bucket.\n\nAzad glared at him. \"Just because the eggheads think it's fine to let a mirror monster run rampant over the Site, doesn't mean I'm gonna give it a big hug.\"\n\nPhil squeezed out the mop and rolled the bucket down the hallway, noting how Doug's eyes followed his every step. //And why not? You don't see a guy pushing a mop every day... unless you're a janitor's personal demon, that is.//\n\n\"All your friends are dead,\" said Doug.\n\n\"What did it say?\"\n\n\"It said 'Do you know, Philip, what the most aggravating sentence in the English language is? It's 'What did he say?'' And you know, I think it's right?\"\n\n\"Somebody's touchy.\"\n\nAzad headed down the hallway and Phil ambled along behind him, shakily tracing a clean path with the mop. He noticed a sudden movement to his right, as Doug popped into existence on a fresh mirror mounted between two unmarked doors.\n\n\"I think I'm gonna be touchy forever,\" said Phil.\n\n\"You'll get used to it,\" said Azad, glancing down at his duty scrip and frowning. \"Vending machines, seriously. Nothing important's broken right now?\" He reached into his toolbelt.\n\n\"How am I gonna get 'used to it'?\" Phil snapped.\n\nAzad stared at the vending machine. It was a glass-fronted snack dispenser; the snacks were entirely obscured by a gaunt grey figure.\n\n\"This is already a shitty job,\" said Phil. \"Now it's a shitty job with a foreman I can't duck who occasionally screams at me.\"\n\nAzad began removing screws from the vending machine, his eyes locked on the apparition. \"Sounds like a pretty typical foreman to me.\" He smiled at Doug, weakly, as though trying to placate it. \"Or maybe a wife.\"\n\n\"Do you want a wife, Philip?\" asked the thing in the glass, sneering with its scars. Azad briefly recoiled, then removed the final screw. \"Do you want to be //wanted?//\"\n\n\"Call me Phil, asshole. Everyone else does.\"\n\nAzad swung the front of the vending machine open. Doug's image disappeared from Phil's view for an instant; when the back of the glass became visible, the apparition had already flipped around to face him again.\n\n\"Talking to yourself?\" Azad asked.\n\n\"Yeah. I call myself 'asshole', asshole.\"\n\n\"I might start calling you that, too.\" Azad attached a small electronic device to the interior of the machine, and tapped a few buttons on it.\n\nPhil felt a hand on his shoulder. He winced; he could remember when a sudden sensation like that would have sent him into the ceiling tiles. He looked behind him.\n\nThe hand was Dr. Blank's. \"How's it working out so far?\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"Fine, I guess.\" He gestured vaguely at the hallway walls, decorated every few metres with black-and-red mirrors. \"But this is a bit... much, isn't it? Not really our style?\"\n\nBlank laughed. \"I think the \"S\" stands for something else. We don't do 'style' here. We do security, and this is what security looks like.\"\n\n\"It //looks// like a funhouse,\" said Azad. \"Without the fun.\"\n\nBlank blinked. \"We've considered the matter with care. And the matter is closed.\" He smiled briefly at Phil, and walked away.\n\nAzad watched him go. \"Asshole,\" he muttered.\n\nPhil shrugged. \"Not used to talking to us lowlifes.\"\n\n\"Subjects in containment get talked at all the time.\" Azad removed the device and swung the vending machine shut again, Doug inverting mid-swing.\n\n\"I'm not a subject in containment,\" said Phil.\n\nAzad grinned. \"Sure you're not.\" He started replacing the screws.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf\"]]\n+ 2020 [[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf\"]]\n++ 8 September\n[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#bc00bf; font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]] **3:32 AM** [[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\nHe was standing in a long, pipe-lined hallway.

He never so much looks at anyone but me.\" There was a strange edge to his voice; he realized that he felt vaguely proprietorial about the apparition. //Oh, brother.//\n\n\"So I've heard.\" Niemenin continued to tap the glass. \"Or, I should say, read. You two have had quite the experimentation history together! More than a dozen in just over two months. Of course, that was almost twenty years ago... not much interest, since.\"\n\nPhil felt his pulse quicken. \"You've read Doug's file.\"\n\nNiemenin nodded, still tapping the mirror. \"Yes, //Doug's// file. Interesting stuff. Bet you'd like to get your hands on it!\"\n\nPhil forced himself to shrug. He felt sick. \"Not really.

Really?\"\n\nPhil blinked slowly. \"//I// am,\" he said. \"You're not really saying much.\"\n\nNiemenin turned to face him. \"I don't really have that much to say to you.

I suppose I was focused on Amelia. I hope we didn't make things too awkward for you.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\" Phil pictured the words in his mind and recited them one by one, fighting back a sudden taste of ashes in his mouth. \"She seemed happy to see you.\" He felt like he'd just described a violent murder.\n\n\"Trust me, she was.\" Niemenin grinned, adjusting his tie in the mirror with a bit of ducking and weaving. \"She must have been lonely with nobody to talk to.\"\n\n\"Nobody to talk to,\" said Doug.\n\n\"I wouldn't know,\" said Phil. \"I always have somebody to talk to.\"\n\n\"Not much of a body,\" said Neimenin, tapping the glass one more time, \"but I take your meaning. Most of us spend our entire lives wondering what makes us special, but you've got an all-day, every-day reminder right here. What more could a man ask for?\" He chuckled; it rang false. \"Still, can't be fun flying under everyone else's radar. I've heard so much about your friend here, but next to nothing about you. Besides what's in the file, of course.\"\n\nPhil looked away. \"Yeah, no one else would've mentioned me.\" He didn't care how tellingly bitter that sounded.\n\n\"No one else ever has.\" Niemenin smoothed out his tie. \"But that's a good thing.

She yawned three times while Phil was giving his daily report; she apologized after each, but didn't look at him. He thought he caught her smiling softly a few times, but the smile disappeared whenever they made eye contact.\n\n\"Late night?\" he asked, on the third occasion. //What the fuck what the fuck what the fuck,// he thought. //Don't answer that!//\n\nShe nodded. \"Yeah, been busy. Uh.\" She was clearly trying to think of something more to say to him, and failing.\n\n\"Just leave,\" said Doug. \"She doesn't want you here.\"\n\nShe pointed at the mirror. Phil shook his head. \"He's speaking French, and I don't.\"\n\nShe nodded again, obviously distracted.\n\n\"I'd better go,\" he said. \"Curfew's in an hour, and you're doing Chief Nascimbeni's duty this year.\" He smiled, squinting behind his glasses so he didn't have to see her face clearly.

All the other doors had rectangular, black-and-white labels. His had a yellow-shaded octagon split into quarters, the top three each containing a single symbol. An eye, reflecting fire; a padlock; some sort of knotted thing. The bottom of the octagon was empty; below it, \"SCP-5056\" in bold.\n\nHe unlocked the door and pushed it open.\n\n\"Forget about her,\" said Doug. Phil didn't bother to check the mirrors. \"She's already forgotten about you.\"\n\nHe kicked the door shut behind him; it slammed, loudly, in the frame. He wanted to cry. He wanted to shout. He wanted to —\n\nThere was a manila envelope on his dining niche table, next to his pens and pencils in the empty soup cup.\n\nHe didn't own any manila envelopes. On closer inspection, it looked a lot like the one the All-Sections Chief had used to file his report, all those hundreds of thousands of years ago.\n\nHis heart skipped a beat when he saw what was written in the title field: \"SCP-5056.\"\n\nHe picked it up and opened the flap. There was a thin stack of printouts inside, and he recognized the format immediately; until 2002, he'd sometimes liked to peruse the Clearance Level 1 files via 43NET before bed. They'd helped him fall asleep.\n\nUsually.\n\nThere was a photograph clipped to the pages, a fuzzy, badly-sharpened image of a subway car with a familiar blurry silhouette visible in the door window. It looked like someone tall, thin and oddly-proportioned was standing outside the train as it sped along its underground track. It looked, he thought, fake as all hell. He glanced at the caption: \"Enhanced detail from ultra-long-range photograph: SCP-5056-A within the Site-43 Inter-Sectional Subway System.\" That made sense. Doug loved to apparate on lenses, and he always wrecked them in so doing. They would've had to shoot the photo from far enough away that the monster couldn't manifest on the camera without abandoning Phil.\n\n//I must be just out of frame. I wonder when they took...//\n\n\"Hang on,\" he said. //5056-A?//\n\nHe laid the photograph on the table and read the first line of the file. \"Special Containment Procedures: SCP-5056 is contained by the Janitorial and Maintenance Section of Site-43.\" He had to smile; someone had clearly enjoyed typing that line. \"Its position depends upon, is determined by, and may be directed via the work schedule of Philip Eugene Deering (JM64/SCP-5056-B).\"\n\nHis mouth went dry. //What?//\n\n\"SCP-5056-B is confined to Site-43...\" //What?!// \"He is not to be apprised of his SCP status.\" //WHAT?!//\n\nHe dropped the file on the table and sat down, heavily. He nearly missed the chair. //That can't be right. That __can't__ be right.//\n\n\"You and I, Philip.

He is naturally introverted and antisocial, maintaining a small circle of friends and only rarely seeking out the company of others. After psychiatric evaluation and off-site conversations with concerned parties, I have reached the following conclusions:\n\n1) Deering does not pose a flight risk;\n2) Deering's surviving family members will agree to suspend contact with him indefinitely;\n3) Deering's limited leisure requirements are easily fulfilled by existing on-site facilities;\n4) Brief visits to the topside interdiction zone should satisfy Deering's intermittent need for natural environments and daylight;\n5) The fiction that one month's lead-in time is required to plan any off-site vacations should keep Deering at Site-43 indefinitely, of his own volition, as he is poorly motivated and resistant to long-term planning;\n6) Individuals with Level 3 Security Clearance or higher demonstrating close relationships with Deering, if any, must be given access to a variant of the Special Containment Procedures File for SCP-5056 which omits any mention of him as a component of the anomaly;\n7) New personnel should be directed to Deering for orientation on the properties of his counterpart, to facilitate the maintenance of his social circle over time;\n8) Embedded agents should periodically encourage personnel to pursue Deering romantically, where compatibility has been indicated by Hiring and Regulation Section cross-referencing; records show he has never made romantic overtures without direct prompting.\n\nThe above measures should be sufficient to maintain Deering's emotional equilibrium //ad infinitum,// facilitating the containment of SCP-5056 at Site-43 until his death from natural causes. At that point, obviously, reassessment will become necessary.\n[[>]]\n//- Dr. N. Ngo, 8 February 2003//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nHe dropped it on the floor. His legs felt weak. The rest of the file washed over him like a tidal wave of shame, every sentence offering up a new insult: he was \"reliable, amiable, melancholy\"; he \"engaged in brief romantic relationships invariably terminated by his partners\"; he displayed \"degraded responses to sudden audio and visual stimuli.\" By the end of the file, it was getting truly ridiculous.\n\nHe read a few of the final lines out loud: \"His personal appellation for the apparition is \"Doug,\" but when referring to it indirectly he prefers the term \"my Employee of the Month Award.\" No such award has ever been granted to him, and in light of his present duties no such award is likely forthcoming.\"\n\nHe tried to throw the file across the room, violently; it caught the air wrong, and fluttered to the floor in front of him like a black-dappled butterfly.\n\nHe clenched and unclenched his fingers.\n\nHe took a deep breath.\n\nHe looked back at the mirror.\n\n\"You and me, Doug.\"\n\nNo response.\n\n\"Eighteen FUCKING years.\" \n\nThe apparition blinked.\n\nPhil checked his watch. It was also blinking: 6:00 PM.\n\nHe grabbed his PDA from the table, and headed for the door.\n\n----\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[SCP-5243]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[/the-significant-others-part-b The Significant Others, Part \"B\"]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Everything!\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
