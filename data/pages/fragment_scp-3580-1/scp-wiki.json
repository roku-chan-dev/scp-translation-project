THETA-1 encounters some turbulence as it flies toward the target. Thunder crackles outside.//\n\n> {{Dozens of reports are being received all at once.}}\n\n//As the team is rocked back and forth, they ready their equipment.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Lads, tonight we ride into Hell.\n\n//The sounds of guns cocking are heard; rifles and sidearms are all being loaded and prepared. Lights inside the vehicle rotate, shining red.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Tonight, we end this charade once and for all.\n\n//Two more helicopters - Designated THETA-2 and THETA-3 -  fly in close by, followed shortly by a plane - THETA-4. All units carry separate teams of Nu-7 operatives.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Tonight, we will tear down these demons...\n\n> {{Accounts being filed detail both major disturbances.}}\n\n//The teams pass through Turkish borders. Michaels stands.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Lock them up tight!\n\n//Crowds have formed around the target below.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** And lose that fucking key!\n\n//The group rallies. The helicopters begin their descent.//\n\n//Gunner seats are taken up onboard THETA-1 and THETA-3.//\n\n> {{News coverage of both incidents is underway.}}\n\n> {{Attempts at shutting down either feed are underway.}}\n\n//THETA-4 rapidly descends, opening its back door and releasing an aerosolized amnestic agent down onto the crowd below.//\n\n//Captain Michaels leans in.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Agent Mortimer here will be joining us, lads. Do not underestimate the devils we will be slaying tonight. This man lost two teams to them.\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** And I won't lose another.\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Attaboy!\n\n//All THETA teams prepare their gas masks.//\n\n> {{German officials take notice of the event.}}\n\n//As THETA-1 descends through the clouds.//\n\n> {{Turkish news feeds are being jammed. Shortly after landing, agents from THETA-4 move in to deal with the civilians and the police.}}\n\n//Agents watch as the Bagger 288 comes into view.//\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6a/Bagger-garzweiler.jpg/1920px-Bagger-garzweiler.jpg {$alt}=\"{$alt-text}\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\nBagger 288 Excavation Vehicle.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Atop the first tower, SCP-3580 watches as Foundation forces enter the area. Hanging from the second tower, SCP-3580-A watches the THETA units as they enter the scene.//\n\n//SCP-3580-A lets go, falling for seventy meters as it crashes down onto the steel platform. It takes a moment to rest before bringing its gun into position and aiming at the incoming THETA teams.//\n\n//It opens fire, targeting THETA-2. All units engage in evasive maneuvers.//\n\n//THETA-2 rapidly flies up and away from the target, rotating around the Bagger 288 as it gets hit. Once it exits SCP-3580-A's range, SCP-3580-A refocuses on THETA-3. THETA-3 turns, facing its side towards the anomaly as gunners return fire, and closes in at an angled vector. One agent is killed during this, forcing THETA-3 to rapidly ascend while maintaining cover fire.//\n\n//THETA-1 joins this effort from afar. They both pepper SCP-3580-A from either angle. SCP-3580 leaps downward, catching itself by impaling the Bagger 288 with its sword while sliding down the tower.//\n\n//It lands and gets in front of SCP-3580-A, manifesting a large thaumic shield that absorbs the incoming rounds. This holds for a moment, showing signs of damage after three seconds, and shattering after nine. By this time, SCP-3580-A has seemingly recovered and gets in front of SCP-3580. Its back is shredded as it absorbs the munitions. A roar can be heard from both THETA units.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Hold it! Hold your fire! We need them alive!\n\n//THETA units cease shooting and close in. THETA-2 operatives dismount on the ground as THETA-1 operatives deploy on the Bagger 288. THETA-3 maintains its aerial position and the situation from above.//\n\n//Half of THETA-2's agents move toward the control room at the base of the complex while the rest assist THETA-4's team in dealing with the crowd of civilians, several of whom are seen videotaping the incident.//\n\n//THETA-2 moves in three groups of three agents, Captain Dodger taking the lead. As they approach the central station, they stop as they hear laughter from above. The operatives collectively stop and disband, taking up positions while watching the sky. Eighteen seconds later, they spot a figure descending, jumping between the walls of the Bagger 288 before it leaps toward them.//\n\n//THETA-2 opens fire. SCP-3580 evades these by near-instantly creating a thaumic portal along its trajectory and placing the other end behind one of the agents.//\n\n//A smoke screen forms a second after it is seen executing the operative from its impact with the ground.//\n\n//The rest of the agents fire on the cloud. They continue closing in without noticing a thaumic portal forming behind them.//\n----\n= **//Up Top//**\n----\n//With Captain Michaels leading the charge, THETA-1's team moves up towards the stationary SCP-3580-A, which overlooks the conflict going on down below. They encircle it and take aim as Captain Michaels approaches it.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Put the gun down, big guy. No more good people need be hurt.\n\n//It looks back at him.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** You are right, my friend. Take your army and leave, for we are almost finished here. \n\n//He holds his hand up, signaling the group to await his command.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Afraid we can't let you do that, //friend//.\n\n//It turns back.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** It's always the same thing with you people. \n\n//It promptly walks off the platform.//\n\n//A massive clang can be heard from below them, and THETA-1 moves in to investigate. They spot nothing, and back away from the ledge. Another clang can be heard below them, followed by another. The sound begins to emanate from below their feet. Agents aim at the platform, holding their positions as they wait for several silent moments.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Captain?\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Back up. Spread out.\n\n//More and more sounds can be heard beneath them. The Captain holds his hand out, gesturing for silence.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n//The team is stationary as it waits. Operatives look back and forth at the flooring and Michaels. Duke leans down, inspecting a crack in the terrain. A slight shift occurs below, and Michaels nods at Duke to shoot. Nothing happens.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n//SCP-3580-A's Gatling gun bursts through the machine eight meters behind the team and blindly fires at them.//\n\n//Five agents are terminated in this attack. Agent Woodlock is nicked by a stray round across his leg before he can take cover as SCP-3580-A emerges from the platform.//\n----\n= **//Down Below//**\n----\n//SCP-3580 continues its assault on THETA-2, continuously blocking each shot fired at it with thaumic barriers as it presses forward. By now, only four agents remain in this half of the unit, which desperately try to back away from the anomaly.//\n\n//Captain Dodger reaches for her communicator and speaks into it, calling for aerial support on their location. THETA-3 descends and orients its gunners to face the battlefield. SCP-3580 gets behind cover and looks up at the incoming helicopter. The remnants of THETA-2 distance themselves from it, meanwhile, and head to the control center of the Bagger.//\n\n//Both subjects maintain their positions for a moment, neither moving, both intently watching the other. The gunners aboard THETA-2 take the initiative. SCP-3580 sprints forward and outruns the gunner's line of fire. It dashes into a slide, creating a thaumic portal with its hands before reappearing high up in the air. It maintains its momentum and glides into a kick, knocking one agent out of the vehicle. It grabs ahold of the vehicle's landing gear and swings itself inside in one motion.//\n\n//It unsheaths its katana as it refocuses on the rest of the operatives in the helicopter.//\n----\n= //**Up Top//**\n----\n//THETA-1 is down to nine operatives, all of which are scattered, taking turns peaking out from cover, throwing stun grenades at it, or taking shots at it when able. Despite all this, SCP-3580-A shows little sign of slowing down as it charges through a steel wall, grabbing one agent by the head and using her body to attack the other one there. THETA-1 is down to seven operatives.//\n\n//Agent Woodlock, alongside Captain Michaels, hides behind cover in an overhanging junction in the metallic terrain. Above them, a series of flashes can be seen overhead, accompanied by a blood splatter as bullets pass by overhead.//\n\n//Captain Michaels reaches for his communicator and commands the remaining agents to prioritize evading SCP-3580-A. While he does this, the body of Agent King falls and hangs down from the wall, dripping blood and bones down onto them as her skull has been eviscerated. Woodlock stares at King's corpse. He squeezes the grip of his gun, deforming it in the process.//\n\n//Over the radio, the voice of Agent Duke can be heard.//\n\n**Agt. Dule:** Captain!\n\n//His shouting can be heard from outside the radio. Woodlock pops his head over the cover, despite Michaels' protests, and looks out across the terrain. Over on the opposite end of the platform, he watches as SCP-3580-A holds Agent Duke in its hand, rearing back its other arm.//\n\n//Woodlock levels his rifle and takes several shots at the back of its head. He gets up and runs in at enhanced speed. Watching this, Captain Michaels orders the rest of the team to hold their fire. SCP-3580-A is momentarily stunned while this happens, still holding onto Duke, as Woodlock runs up to it, knife in hand.//\n\n----\n= //**Down Below//**\n----\n//The four remaining agents of THETA-2 continue on their way to the control center some fifty meters ahead. Captain Dodger directs them forward, but stays behind and looks up as THETA-3 is overrun. She signals her communicator and commands the other half of THETA-2 to return to the helicopter and fire on SCP-3580.//\n\n----\n= //**Up Top//**\n----\n//Agent Woodlock impales SCP-3580-A in the side with his knife, twisting it deep into the crevice of its waist joint. It tries to bat him away with its gun, but he yanks the knife out, drops it, and catches the entity's arm with both his hands. It turns its head to him, looking at him for a moment, before tossing Agent Duke away and winding back its other hand.//\n\n//Woodlock dodges this and moves under its incoming fist. He rotates around it, takes his rifle, and aims it at the back of SCP-3580-A's head.//\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Don't you move. Not another goddamn move out of you, you son of a bitch!\n\n//Agents all around the two move to better positions and take aim.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** Very well, my friend. I may not move, but maybe your friend will.\n\n//Woodlock turns his head slightly, not moving the rifle from its place, and watches as an injured Agent Duke struggles to hold himself up from falling off the platform eight meters away. He turns his head from Duke to the rest of the team, still running towards them from twenty meters away.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** Your comrades will not be able to hold me for long. You know that. Your Foundation will not tolerate you killing me. You know that. A dog has no choice. What do you choose?\n\n//Woodlock's breath hastens. He looks between SCP-3580-A and Duke, who is quickly losing his grip on the flat metal surface.//\n\n//He lowers his rifle to the back of SCP-3580-A's knee, firing once, before doing the same for its other. He tosses the gun away as the entity drops down on its back. He runs after Duke and reaches out for his hand a moment after Duke had already fallen.//\n\n//Woodlock leaps over the edge, holding onto the platform with one hand, and grabs Duke's arm. With the aid of his enhancement, in conjunction with his other hand, he swings Duke upward and back onto stable territory where he lands on his back. Duke screams throughout this procedure.//\n\n//The other operatives of THETA-1 immediately try to get behind cover as SCP-3580-A stands and extends its gun toward them. Above, THETA-3 can be seen entering the shot, hovering above SCP-3580-A with its gunners reared.//\n\n//Through the stained windshield, SCP-3580 can be seen piloting the aircraft.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Hit the deck!\n\n----\n= //**Internal View//**\n----\n//Inside THETA-3, Junior Researcher Fallen can be seen emerging from a crevice in the back from the body cam of a downed agent. He wears a leg prosthetic and looks around at the mess of sixteen dead operatives. He hyperventilates, falling to his rear whilst trying to avoid stepping in anyone. His head bobs back and forth between one sight to another, before staring straight ahead into the broken door of the cockpit. He grabs an assault rifle from one of the dead and heads towards it..//\n\n//With rifle raised, visibly shaking, he reaches for the door with the barrel of the gun but gets slammed into a wall as the helicopter jerkily ascends. The door falls off its hinges as THETA-3 rises above the Bagger. Fallen struggles to his feet and pushes forward, stepping into the flight deck where SCP-3580 can be seen staring at the conflict down on the platform below.//\n\n//He raises the rifle and instantly takes a shot, piercing its chest and sending it sprawling onto the controls of the vehicle, disrupting only minor systems. It turns back to him, sword swiftly raised.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** You. You survived.\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** Oh, you fucking remember me now?\n\n//He fires again at the seat beside its head.//\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** You deserve to die for what you've done!\n\n//It chuckles at this. He fires another round into its leg, replacing its laughter with groaning.//\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** What the f-fuck are you laughing at?\n\n**SCP-3580:** That sounded familiar, that's all.\n\n//It tries to nurse its wounds, grunting all the while.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** Tell me, how long will you carry that vendetta with you, everywhere you go? What will you be willing to lose just to bring somebody else down with you?\n\n//Fallen takes a deep breath, leveling the gun with its head.//\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** Whatever it takes.  \n\n**SCP-3580:** That's the spirit. But I don't think that'll help you now.\n\n//It gestures behind Fallen. He takes a quick glimpse behind himself, turning back to SCP-3580 for a moment before doing a double take.//\n\n//THETA-2 flies in from the rear and moves up to be side-by-side with THETA-3. The pilots within THETA-2 look through THETA-3's windshield, seeing SCP-3580 as it clambers to stand. By the time Fallen can look back at it, it draws its sword and attacks him.//\n\n//With his augments, Fallen barely manages to keep up with SCP-3580 as it slashes wildly at him. He uses the rifle to block the incoming hits. He backs away and gets pushed back into the main cabin where he attempts to hold his ground. Clumsily swinging the gun like a club, his remaining leg, his arm, and his lower ribcage are all cut.//\n\n> THETA-2 calls for permission to terminate SCP-3580.\n\n//SCP-3580 kicks Fallen in the stomach which knocks him onto his back. Taking a second to get himself upright, he aims at the entity just as it waves to him and drops out of the helicopter. Fallen crawls over to pursue it, firing repeatedly after it as it free-falls away and missing every shot. It creates a portal and disappears from sight.//\n\n//Fallen crawls back into the cabin and shuts the doors, laying on his back to catch his breath for a moment.//\n\n//Dozens of rounds penetrate the hull of THETA-3. Fallen curls into the fetal position as all around holes begin to form in both walls and the clang of metal on metal rings out. Major onboard systems are taken out, and THETA-3 loses motor control entirely. As the helicopter falls, Fallen tries to get to his feet and notices several bullet wounds along his legs.//\n----\n= **//Down Below//**\n----\n//The remaining members of THETA-2 gather around the control consoles of the Bagger 288, tearing through the chamber in search of a way to shut it down. They radio for assistance, as all of the controls are written in German.//\n----\n= //**Up Top//**\n----\n//SCP-3580-A sprays the platform, covering the area from left to right as it advances on the operatives behind cover. Taking four steps, each covering about a meter and a half and quickly closing in on Michaels' location, it stops its barrage and turns back to THETA-3.//\n\n//With the entity stationary, agents manage to pelt it in the back, causing further significant damage to its body. It kneels as it watches THETA-2 fly in to take out THETA-3.//\n----\n= //**Aerial View//**\n----\n//Struggling into the pilot's seat, Fallen tries to regain control over THETA-3. He throttles up, causing the helicopter to slightly reangle its descent on its crash course.//\n\n//THETA-3 glides down and onto the platform of the Bagger 288 with SCP-3580-A in its path; the entity does not react to this or the agents. As THETA-3 collides with the Bagger's framework, SCP-3580-A instantly dashes into a sprint after it. THETA-2 intercepts this by flying closer in and firing a short burst at it, buckling its knee.//\n\n//THETA-3 crashes through SCP-3580-A. Most of the vehicle's frontal hull is smashed before the remains of it arc over the entity and skid to a stop nine meters away. This impact creates a short smokescreen that follows THETA-3 and briefly lingers around SCP-3580-A.//\n\n//The agents move in and watch the smokescreen. As it clears, the collapsed body of SCP-3580-A can be seen. The entity's severed Gatling gun lies a short distance from it.//\n\n//The operatives run in to secure SCP-3580-A while Woodlock goes after THETA-3. He tears the door away and steps inside, pausing momentarily to react to its interior. He looks around the gore-stained hull at the mangled bodies of an unknown number of personnel. He heads back out to vomit.//\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Oh god. Oh fucking Christ. \n\n//He heads back inside and tries to navigate through the hull to the cockpit. He wedges himself past the doorframe, where inside he finds Fallen clutching at his wounds at the control panel.//\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Holy shit, Leon?!\n\n//Fallen looks up at him, revealing his paled face. He speaks faintly.//\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** //H-hey there, sir//.\n----\n= //**Up Top//**\n----\n//SCP-3580 appears from a portal on one of the Bagger 288's towers. It quickly descends the pillar and rushes over to SCP-3580-A's side. As it runs, the entity is shot more than once along its way. It crouches down beside SCP-3580-A and creates a variety of symbols with its hands, which channels a thaumic dome around both of them. The body cam of a downed agent inside this barrier picks up the ensuing conversation.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** Prox... im... a.\n\n**SCP-3580:** How? How were you bested, Warden?\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** You must go.\n\n**SCP-3580:** The gate, Warden-\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** -The blood we have spilled exacts its price.\n\n**SCP-3580:** I've heard enough of your bleeding-heart bullshit, now stand and fight, Cascade!\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** Proxima, listen to me. You must learn to temper yourself. Moving on like this will only lead you to misery. The Order knows that, but he uses you anyway. He is selfish, he does not truly care for you.\n\n**SCP-3580:** And how does any of that help us right now?\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** Because if you survive this, you would do well to remember my final words. I would appreciate that, at least.\n\n//SCP-3580 shudders as it looks at SCP-3580-A.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** What are you doing?\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** I am sorry, Proxima.\n\n//It stands and rears back//\n\n**SCP-3580:** No, wait, stop! Don't you dare!\n\n//SCP-3580-A charges through the barrier, shattering it instantly, before breaking past the lines of agents before it. It is hit repeatedly as it runs across the Bagger 288 platform, leaving noticeable damage on its exposed body. THETA-2 hovers over and opens fire on it again. It staggers under this and falls to its knees, taking a second to recuperate as THETA-2 ceases fire. Agents close in on it and watch as it crawls to the edge of the Bagger and throws itself off.//\n\n//It lands on its back down in the lower framework of the machine connected to the digger. Its voice can be heard over SCP-3580's wrist, and an aerial shot of the target shows it reaching into its chest.//\n\n**SCP-3580-A:** I... I am... proud of you... Run. \n\n**SCP-3580:** Cascade!-\n\n//An explosion erupts, causing ripples throughout the vehicle and shaking the entire structure. The sawblade dismounts as the combustion severs the framework from the Bagger and halts its progress.//\n\n//SCP-3580-A is terminated.//\n----\n= //**Aerial View//**\n----\n//The explosion continues throughout the vehicle, causing the entire system to tremble as chunks of steel break off, bend, and warp in reaction to the newly missing segment of the Bagger. One of the towers falls and crashes while the other is constricted from the strain on the support beams.//\n\n//SCP-3580 sits motionless and stares at the ensuing chaos. Operatives, distracted by watching the terrain rapidly destabilizing, look to the captain. Michaels calls THETA-2 to pick them up. Agent Woodlock walks out of THETA-3, carrying Fallen with him to rejoin the rest of the group.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** What do we do with her?\n\n//Captain Michaels, Agent Woodlock, and the rest of the operatives turn to watch SCP-3580 as it reaches out toward the missing section of the machine. Its sword lies a short distance away, and its legs appear to be limp.//\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** Sh- sh- oot.\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** We need to get out of here. Let her burn.\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Scratch that, Morty; we got a job to do. Lads! \n\n//Excluding Woodlock and Duke, the remaining operatives move in with guns raised. Michaels pulls out a set of thaumaturgy-restricting handcuffs as he runs towards the entity.//\n\n//SCP-3580 looks up at Michaels.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** You bastards! \n\n//It casts another incantation directly below itself, sending it through a thaumic portal. The gateway's opposite end manifests above Michaels, and SCP-3580 drops through and lands on him. It begins rapidly assailing Michaels as the rest of the team take aim.//\n\n//Michaels punches the entity in its side and again in its face. The two continue to struggle before Michaels can bat SCP-3580 off of him which sends it careening away to the edge of the platform.//\n\n//The team closes in with rifles raised. Michaels cracks his neck as he walks up to it, handcuffs in hand.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** It's over, wench. Not another goddamn move.\n\n//As he bends down to restrain SCP-3580, it looks up at him with tears in its furrowed eyes. A shot rings out from behind the team, appearing to hit the entity in the face and causing it to jerk back and fall off the edge.//\n\n//Every other agent around looks back to see Fallen with his arm outstretched, Woodlock's sidearm in hand.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** What have you done, son?\n\n**Jr. Fallen:** I finished the job.\n\n//THETA-2 lands and opens its doors for the operatives. Rain begins to fall and fight the fires aboard the Bagger.//\n\n----\n= //**Down Below//**\n----\n//The body cam of a downed agent picks up as SCP-3580 crashes into the ground. A loud crunch is heard as one of its metal prosthetic arms is crushed. It shouts in agony, crawls onto its back, and lays there for some time as it clutches its wounds.//\n\n//It tears off the damaged arm and tosses it away, grabbing at its exposed and heavily lacerated shoulder. Eventually, it manages to get to its knees, causing it to cry out in pain. It tries to stand and collapses.//\n\n//After some time like this, it notices the body of the agent. It turns onto its stomach and crawls towards the corpse. It tears off a piece of the operative's uniform to apply tourniquets to its wounds, it ties the stock of the agent's rifle to its leg to act as a splint, and it uses the rest of the gun as a makeshift walking stick.//\n\n//While dabbing at the blood on the side of its head, it stares down at Agent Kimson's face. It drops the cloth and crawls forward to lean over Kimson. Its breathing intensifies and quickly transitions into grunting as it strikes the operative's head, causing it to lose balance.//\n\n//It reorients itself and continues pummeling the agent. As the brutality concludes, SCP-3580 screams. It soon after collapses and wailing is heard.//\n\n//Around the entity, the Bagger falls apart, the rain continues falling, and SCP-3580 is still alone.// \n----\n= //**Internal View//**\n----\n//Inside THETA-2, the operatives are being treated for their injuries as the pilot hovers around the target, searching for SCP-3580. Woodlock is seated beside Duke and Michaels while an unconscious Fallen is being operated on aboard THETA-4.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** That young agent... You two have any idea who he is?\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Someone who wasn't supposed to be on this mission.\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Well, all things considered, he ruined the point of this entire operation, but he also stopped that lunatic before she could turn our guns on us.\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Reckless and self-centered. \n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Hey, you think I didn't catch what you were suggesting back there?\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** Yeah, well, look what happened anyway. Lost the damn target again, a whole helicopter's down, God knows how many good people are gone for fuck-all.\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** They died serving their duty. It's part of the job, Morty.\n\n//Woodlock mumbles to himself.//\n\n**Agt. Woodlock:** //The job.//\n\n//THETA-2 flies over to the newly created ravine at the Eastern end of the scene. After a moment, they observe a small figure shambling towards the mouth of the cavern as it begins drawing a portal incantation.//\n\n**Cpt. Michaels:** Target sighted!\n\n//Michaels as well as the rest of the team, save for Woodlock, watches while descending as the entity travels to the bottom of the ravine and begins creating another thaumic spell.//\n\n**Cpt.

A review of both the current state of this place, as well as compiled THETA footage, revealed that a large structure in its center appears to now be missing.\n\nOngoing Veil protection operations are in effect.
