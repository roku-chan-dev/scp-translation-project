In light of the growing list of uncontained anomalies and emergency situations, Light has opted to expand the original roster and form another squad of MTF Alpha-9.  Additionally, in support of Project Resurrection, she has authorized the Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority (ETTRA).\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Dr. Dan ███████]]\nIncarcerated for his crimes involved in the containment and proposed neutralization of [[[SCP-096]]], Dan has spent the last 10 years coming up with solutions to hypothetical anomalous disasters.  Now, Director Light has released Dan so as to head ETTRA as its Director.  Fresh from the widespread destruction in the wake of the Foundation Elimination Coalition’s attack on Site-19, Dan is ready to tackle the next big problem.  Because there’s always another problem, and too many end-of-world situations have been left unaddressed, and Dan is the man with a plan.\n\nHe’s been called in to consult on the investigation, containment, and possible neutralization of the anomalous entity referred to as “Him” in [[[SCP-093]]]’s documents.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Agent Deneb]]\nEx-UIU agent specializing in investigations and apprehension of anomalous individuals, Carlotta Deneb was recently headhunted by the Foundation to work in containment.  She was tapped by Director Light to join MTF Alpha-9, to better use her skills.  Agent Deneb has no anomalous abilities but is tenacious and proficient with small arms.  She is also in the early stages of romantic entanglement with fellow MTF agent Lucretia Popescu.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Lucretia Popescu]]\nLucy (“POI-2408-351”) grew up in Romania, but when she was very young she was the victim of human trafficking by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2408 | The Hunter’s Black Lodge]]], a neo-Sarkic cult/organized crime ring, and raised in their fighting pits.  For more than 15 years, she has been fighting to the death for the profit of the Lodge and to honor Orok, the Lodge’s semi-mythic founder and attendant to the ancient Sarkic messiah.  Lucy was contained by Foundation forces during a raid on the Lodge, and was contained for some time before Director Light decided she was wasted potential in a containment cell.  Lucy has significant anomalous strength and control over the shape of her physical form, performing carnomantic transformations to suit the situation as it develops.  She is romantically involved with Agent Deneb.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Rainer Miller]]\n[[[SCP-4051]]], otherwise known as Rainer Miller, has significant anomalous capabilities. He can manifest portals, reach into them and retrieve whatever item he is presently searching for — or at least that’s how it appears from the outside.  He also has been known to produce flames from said portals, and has significant experience working with Mobile Task Force personnel in the field.  Director Light found him at Site-17 in a medically induced coma, and opted to recruit him to her new team.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab The Specter]]\n[[span class=\"shadow\"]][[[SCP-4494]]][[/span]], better known as [[span class=\"shadow\"]]The Specter [[/span]], is an anomalous entity with various unclear capabilities.  He has been known to “fight crime wherever it shows its dastardly face” and has been observed moving in and out of the shadows in a manner similar to teleportation.  [[span class=\"shadow\"]]The Specter [[/span]] is also capable of manifesting numerous weapons from within his person.  His appearance is that of an animate shadow, but with substance as he can manipulate objects and has exhibited significant physical strength.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Dr. Gat]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5310 | Dr. Irving Gat]]] is a Foundation scientist who had to reformat his mind to better tackle irrational concepts and surrealistic containment scenarios.  He’s brilliant, strange, funny, and an all-around difficult person to speak to.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab General Wilford]]\nGeneral Jack Willford has been commanding MTF personnel in the field and from the rear for over 20 years.  10 years ago, he was in direct command of those MTF personnel who were killed by SCP-096 as a result of Dan’s manipulations (in effort to convince the Foundation to kill the anomaly).  He takes his job seriously, but he hates Dan with a passion, and there’s always a little debate in his head concerning whether or not Dan deserves to live a moment longer.  He’s not usually in the field, but has decided to take a personal perspective on the situation now faced by MTF Alpha-9 and Dr. Dan.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Grigori Karpin & HarryBlank]]\n\n=====\n> **Filename**: Postcard\n> **Author**: [[user Grigori Karpin]]\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-6/PostCard%20SCP-093-E.jpg | Link]]]\n> **Additional Notes**: Made up by editing the three below images.\n-----\n> **Filename:** Loner\n> **Author:** Marketa\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: https://www.flickr.com/photos/toffee_maky/13793068983/\n> **Additional Notes:**\n\n> **Filename:** Mannequin\n> **Author:** bahind\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: https://www.flickr.com/photos/bahind/4844913116/\n> **Additional Notes:**\n\n> **Filename**: vintage paper texture\n> **Author**: pinkorchid_too (Sandra)\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: https://www.flickr.com/photos/artfullife/6030107724\n\n-----\n> **Filename**: Postcard2\n> **Author**: [[user GremlinGroup]]\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/PostCard2%20SCP-093-E | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**: Used with creator’s express permission.
