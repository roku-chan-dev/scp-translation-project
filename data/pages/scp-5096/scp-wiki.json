This cell is to have all life support equipment[[footnote]] E.g. automatic feeding units and climate control systems. [[/footnote]] removed and retrofitted with a 5-meter-tall concrete pedestal for SCP-5096 to rest upon.\n\nSCP-5096 is to be kept at least 3 meters from all soil and other forms of particulate silicate matter and is to be kept at least 50 meters from living organisms belonging to the phylum Annelida[[footnote]]Ringworms and Segmented worms.[[/footnote]]and the phylum Arthropoda.[[footnote]]Insects, crustaceans, arachnids, centipedes, and scorpions.[[/footnote]]\n\nTwo weeks following a GARDEN-PARTY event, SCP-5096’s cell is to be cleaned of the remains of all SCP-5096-2 instances present. SCP-5096-2 instances displaying properties previously undocumented will be retained for further study; all other instances are to be brought to a standard Biological Containment cell for storage.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5096/butterfly\n| caption=SCP-5096 prior to containment.\n| width=WIDTH-GOES-HERE]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5096 refers to a singular painted lady butterfly (//Vanessa cardui Rhopalocera//). SCP-5096 can manifest an entomology book titled //'Life of Insects: The Study and Story Behind Entomology'// by Jane Woodsburrow (designated SCP-5096-1). SCP-5096 is capable of turning the pages of SCP-5096-1 via the flapping of its wings. When SCP-5096-1 is opened, the environment depicted on the chosen page will manifest. (Ex: A page about the average earthworm will result in the manifestation of soil and grass.)\n\nIf SCP-5096 is introduced to soil or other forms of particulate silicate matter, SCP-5096 will produce a number of duplicates of itself (designated SCP-5096-2). When introduced to any organism belonging to the phylum Annelida or the phylum Arthropoda, the entire vicinity around SCP-5096 will transform into that of outdoor scenery (though will remain indoors), and instances of SCP-5096-2 will metamorphosize into organisms belonging to the phylum Annelida or the phylum Arthropoda (designated GARDEN-PARTY event). The effects of a GARDEN-PARTY event will persist even if the organisms introduced to SCP-5096 are removed. A GARDEN-PARTY event will last for approximately two weeks before SCP-5096-2 instances are able to be removed. It is of note that this event does not occur if SCP-5096 interacts with soil that manifests along with the environments depicted in SCP-5096-1.\n\n\n**Addendum-1: SCP-5096-1 Excerpts** \n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Page Number:** 23\n\n**Page Contents:**  The habitat and behavior of the American Cockroach (//periplaneta americana//).\n\n**Effect:** A small portion of SCP-5096's cell transforms to wet cement and stone resembling a house garage. Half-eaten food items are scattered across the pavement, as well as nine cockroaches scavenging said food. SCP-5096 flutters over to each cockroach, aiding each one in the retrieval of a food item. SCP-5096 stays in the affected area until SCP-5096-1 is closed.\n\n**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 29 reading: //'A lot of people hate cockroaches, but I just love these little guys. I try to help them get food whenever I can. And they only want shelter from the rain! Why would you squish the poor creatures? Bugs are more like us than you'd think, I know you don't like being hungry in the rain.'//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Page Number:** 40\n\n**Page Contents:** The behaviors of the Average Honey Bee (//Apis mellifera//).\n\n**Effect:** A large tree trunk with a honey bee hive located within a large central hollow manifests along with several rocks and a small grassy area. SCP-5096 flutters around the hive, but remains carefully outside of the bees' detection for approximately two minutes before SCP-5096-1 is closed. \n\n**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 40 reading: //'I like bees. Bees are calm. I like calm. Many think bees are dangerous, but they don't want to hurt you. They want to help you! They want your garden to be the best it can be! I guess I'm like them in that way. I spend lots of time in my garden watching them. You should let bees help.'// \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Page Number:** 67\n\n**Page Contents:** The habitat, behaviors, and background of the Drugstore Beetle (//Stegobium paniceum//).\n\n**Effect:** A small section of SCP-5096's cell transforms into dry tile with a large open bag of dry dog food. Several dozen drugstore beetles can be seen within, scavenging the food. SCP-5096 flutters above the affected area, then flies away from it.\n\n**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 67 reading: '//Man, those drugstore beetles are quite the thing aren't they? There's a whole lot of them. You know the name comes from the fact that they like to feed upon pharmacological products such as dried herbs and plants. Haha, that's pretty cool! Most people think they're a nuisance, but I think they're just like us. I've been eating more outdoor things recently, but that's fine! Gives me more time to observe and document for this book.'//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Page Number:** 115\n\n**Page Contents:** The habitat, behaviors, and information about the painted lady butterfly (//Vanessa cardui Rhopalocera//).\n\n**Effect:** All of SCP-5096's cell transforms to mimic that of a backyard-like area typically found in temperate climates, including trees, a patio-style porch against the wall with a door, grass, flowers, and daytime sky. No other insects manifest. SCP-5096 flutters around the entirety of its cell for approximately five minutes before landing on a stack of papers lying in the grass. The effects of SCP-5096-1 demanifest approximately seven minutes after it is closed.\n\n**Additional Notes:** Handwritten notes in the margin of page 115 reading: //'You guys get to see a bit of where I grew up, ey? Technically I'm just talking about butterflies here, but I mean I guess I connect to that now. It's a wonder I've still been able to write in here. But how will I share this? There are a million books about insects out there, but you'll never find someone more passionate about it than me. I'll still spread the message, I'll get there somehow.'// \n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum-2:** Approximately two months after the discovery of SCP-5096, the home of Jane Woodsburrow was found vacated, and is believed to be associated with SCP-5096. Within the home, an indoor butterfly enclosure with multiple butterflies inside was found. Next to this was a collection of notes. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Hello! You're trying to write a book about insects!// Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ\n\n//You don't have to freak out, I'm a butterfly, not a ghost! See? I'm right here!// Ƹ̵̡Ӝ̵̨̄Ʒ\n\n//I can't understand what you're saying.

We could share this book in a different way, if you're willing to become a little bit more like me.
