Dame Scriver\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Dame Farloom\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> An oracle, a seer, the greatest prophet to grace this enclave. Able to peer forward in time as easily as thinking about a memory from her past.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Our fearless leader. She assists Sir Light with our plans, working together to lead us into the night. Her visions of future happenings lead us to the helpless individuals we've been tasked with protecting.\n\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/famineren/banner.png\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Sir Light\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> The brightest glow emanates from his skin. A true knight through and through, Sir Light's heart is a shining star of pure energy.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Through this world of everlasting dark, he is our lantern. The beacon we follow as the only light we can depend on in this world. His work is not in the fray but as a leader of this enclave. Well, him and the wonderful Dame Farloom.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Dame Seaworth\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> All within Dame Seaworths immediate vicinity are granted the gift of underwater breathing.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Though normally our shelter would be incapable of traversing distances blocked by bodies of water, with her on our crew, it becomes fully traversable. She has full control over who benefits from her gift so a chase by adversaries is able to be easily halted by a retreat into the sea.\n\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/famineren/banner.png\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Sir Lyre\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> The flute with which his music is played is one of the most prized possessions our entire group owns. With Sir Lyre having trained in woodwind instruments, when Queen Isabel discovered this artefact, Sir Lyre was recruited to our enclave to wield it.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> A musician by trade, Sire Lyre's music inspires all the enclave members through indescribable means.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Sir Featherfoot\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Pure silence.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Our scout in the shadows, his work involves sneaking into any outpost or guard tower blocking our path and reporting to Dame Farloom and Sir Light on its layout. The inability to speak was a choice he made. He comes from an order of monks, where at the age of 18, he went through a magical ritual inducing the most involved vow of silence capable of students from his abbey.\n\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/famineren/banner.png\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Dame Thornn\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Our immortal. Any beings attempting to harm her succumb to the injuries she takes as well.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Although her power is great, it is not infallible. She can still expire from her wounds, although the beast that slays her would be slain in the same blow. When negotiations between the Knights of Wonder and other hostile communities take place, Dame Thornn is sent to meet with the one in charge. This ensures no blood is shed lest their leader perish.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Dame Phantom\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Having refused to leave this mortal plane, she haunts our enclave in a ghastly form.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Not known for a power in life, she has proven her worth since her passing. Enemies being killed at the hands of their own weaponry, a whisper through the wind warning us of dangers before they strike, and messages scribed by those forgotten have all been happenings attributed to Dame Phantom. From beyond the grave, Dame Phantom has become one of the most trusted in the enclave.\n\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/famineren/banner.png\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Xyr Burns\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Their skin is hot to the touch, a searing heat subsumes anything coming in contact.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Not only the most fearless, deadly warrior in our company but a very talented chef as well. Xyr Burns both catches and cooks delectable feasts for our whole crew without fail every evening. If they're not on the battlefield or out hunting, you'll find Xyr Burns in the galley roasting steaks on each arm.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Sir Rider\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> The largest of our enclave, Sir Rider is as long as 6 of us combined. It may at first not seem to be a power, but the ability Sir Rider possesses is that of intelligence. The ability to communicate at a level similar to a human.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Our home. Given our duties from Queen Isabel, we must be ever moving, always headed to our next challenge. If it weren't for Sir Rider, we would have nowhere to rest between quests. If it wasn't obvious by now, this knight is not of our species, he is a colossal tortoise. On the back of his shell, we have built our base of operations. A mobile dwelling befitting of a wonderous crew such as ours.\n\n<img src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-knights-of-wonder/sir_rider.png\">\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Sir Redd (Dishonorable)\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Unknown\n\n<b>The true enemy of the enclave:</b> Having been knighted by the banished King Lionel, Sir Redd fled with him. He is a blight on this land, roaming the countryside with Lionel in the shadows. Together they have wrought pain and destruction across this land.\n\n<img src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-knights-of-wonder/sir_redd.png\">\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Viscount Maximus (but we just call him Max)\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Heightened senses.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Max is the Queen's pet dachshund. He was sent with us on this mission for the purposes of tracking Sir Redd. He had lived with Lionel for the first 2 years of his life and knows his scent impeccably. Without Max, we wouldn't know which direction to head.\n\n<img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/famineren/banner.png\">\n\n<b>Title:</b> Dame Scriver\n\n<b>Abilities:</b> Possession of this magical book. Its pages infinite and its ink never running dry.\n\n<b>Role in the enclave:</b> Writing this very book. Within these pages, I have chronicled all we have done. The skirmishes with beasts of all shapes and sizes, negotiations with many a kingdom and community, and fixing all the destruction brought down by Lionel and Sir Redd. All documented here, by me, in this book. I hope you find it as informative to read as I found it comforting to write.\n\n]]\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:more-by:tstaffor]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** sir_rider.png\n> **Name:** Tortoise (PSF).png\n> **Author:** Pearson Scott Foresman\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **URL:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Tortoise_(PSF).png\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** sir_redd.png\n> **Name:** Knight's helmet\n> **Author:** Unknown\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **URL:** https://freesvg.org/knights-helmet\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
