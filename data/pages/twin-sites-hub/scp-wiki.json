This led, among other things such as the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-brief-history-of-the-foundation-s-logo 1953 Unification Act], to the mass construction of containment Sites. Due to the new influx of tech, the rate of discovery for anomalies became unmanageable, and more space was needed.\n \nDuring this mass construction period, quality control went down, and some Sites suffered from the lack of care. This eventually came to a head when the Council signed off on the construction of Site 403 twice, which had been resubmitted after an adjustment of location.\n \nThe mistake wasn't caught until construction was nearly complete, and by then, two separate Sites with near identical layouts had been built side by side on the same plot of land. In the end, the Western Site was designated as Site 403, per the original plan, and the Eastern Site as Site 404.  \n\n------\n\n[[size 140%]] **__//The Plot So Far...//__** [[/size]]\n\nGroup Of Interest Lightspeed Inc. is known to most as a Fortune 500 lister, a corporate conglomerate centered around space tech owned and run by the prestigious Vega family. Not many people know that the company is just a front. The Vega family's true goal is simple - make sacrifices to the Nothing God, Abyssum, in the hopes to one day pull him from his world into ours, filling our reality with endless void. \n\nEstrella Vega is the next in line for the Lightspeed throne - the daughter of matriarch Marilla Vega. But when Marilla Vega dies suddenly, she leaves Estrella to take her place, with little training or knowledge of her mother's real work. So Estrella turns to a place she found in her mother's notes - the Twin Sites. The place that contained [[[SCP-7218]]]. \n\nSite 404 Director Emerald Reynolds takes Estrella under her wing, helping her refine her powers and come into her own - with the trade-off that Estrella will help Emerald find and destroy her mother's legacy. Meanwhile, the Site works to help uncover the years of destruction that Lightspeed has caused - and Dr. Sage West works with the Department of Disappearances, keeping her cards close, and her enemies even closer. \n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 140%]] **__The Estrella Vega Chronicles__** [[/size]]\n\n++ [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7218 SCP-7218]\n\nby [[*user Dr Vikki Lost]]\n\nCase Notes: \n//I've heard of Lightspeed Inc. before.

She grew up in New York as the oldest of six children in a low-income household. Their parents didn't provide much support, so she took it upon herself to raise her siblings alone. She still feels obligated to be a caretaker for others, and struggles to get close to the people she feels responsible for. Rarely gets the recognition her work deserves, but does it anyways. No matter how much she does, it will __never be good enough for her.__\n\n**Assistant Director Celeste Novak** - (She/Her)\nEmerald's protegee. While she often comes across as very similar to Emerald, being quite driven and intelligent, she has less of a caretaker instinct, being more willing to make friends and learn from others. Has a better sense of self-preservation, but isn't as quick of a thinker as Emerald yet. \n \n**Dr. Viktoralai Amity Lost** - (They/Them)\nA reality anchor with an inferiority complex. An incredible researcher, they struggle with making connections to others. Often self-sabotages due to their own anxiety. Desperate for friendship, they often end up being manipulated by those around them. \n\n**Dr. Sage West** - (She/Her) \nA whip-smart Forensic Scientist, driven and self-confident. She often crosses into narcissism, acting impulsively and selfishly. Extroverted and funny, she's well liked by most of her colleagues. A member of the Department of Disappearances - an unofficial department that organises the Disappearances of subjects involved with anomalies to the point of posing a threat. She has little moral compass, and often manipulates those around her to further her own agenda. \n\n++ Site 403 Characters\n\n**Director Moira Fernsby** - (She/Her)\nBubbly and bright. Will do anything to raise morale. Lover of Feminist history and strong women in STEM. A chronic extrovert, who believes in the power of daily positive affirmations, cat calendars, and hot yoga. Sometimes comes off a little bit //too// \"Hello Fellow Kids\" in her attempts to connect with the younger staff. Despite her energetic optimism, she's incredibly smart and observant. Managed to break down Emerald into being her friend. Together, they're unstoppable. \n\n**Ezekiah Lenora** - (They/Them)\nWorks at both sites as a proofreader and editor, formatting SCP files to look professional and organizing charts and data tables submitted by different departments in a way that makes sense. A plural system, the main other headmate being Mabel, who tends to front when Ezekiah is stressed. Nerdy and fastidious, with a particular fondness for Star Trek and Game Of Thrones. Considers being a Ravenclaw as a core personality trait. \n\n**Sam \"Levi\" Leviticus** - (They/Them)\nAn Engineer with a heart of gold. Trustworthy and kind, doing their best to bond with others and be a peacekeeper. Very close with Ezekiah, and one of the few people who know they're a system.\n\n**Dr. Maddie Simes** - (It/They)\nAn employee who was destroyed by an emotional reality bender during the early days of their career, and now lacks a concrete physical form, appearing mostly as a humanoid cloud of black mist in a lab coat. Pessimistic and sometimes bordering on openly hostile. Was the only one to sit with Researcher Turnpike during her 500 year tenor in SCP-7218. Still carries guilt at not being able to save her, but hasn't yet figured out how to personally settle the score and redeem itself. \n\n++ Other Characters\n\n**Marilla Vega** - (She/Her) \nCut-throat and secretive CEO of Lightspeed inc, before her death. Left a trail of enemies and allies behind. \n\n**Estrella Vega** - (She/Her)\nThe daughter of Marilla. Easily bored, and extremely intelligent. Still new to the anomalous world. Striving to learn more about her mother. She tends to cover up her fear of the unknown by acting overly cocky, sometimes to her own detriment. Likes to feel like she's in charge, even when she's the one asking for help - much like her mother, she values having an upper hand. \n\n**Agent Jack \"Jackrabbit\" Marlene** - (He/Him)\nAn agent for the SCP foundation, working undercover as a detective with the Ohio Police Department. Involved in the Department of Disappearances with Sage. While Sage is Trying (Adjective), Jack is Trying (Verb). He does his best.  \n\n**The Curator** - (She/It)\nThe founder of the Museum of Shapes. Formerly a human, but after a car accident, was sucked into a patch of unreality. In her fear, she bound herself to the closest object, allowing her to stay partially within existence. Now, she collects anomalous objects, binding her soul to them in order to keep herself alive and gain their magical attributes. Was a friend of Marilla Vega's, but they parted due to ideological differences. \n[[/tab]]\n[[tab How To Contribute]]\nYou're welcome to use these characters however you wish! Or make your own!!! This is a very open world. Art, writing, or even as just cameos in your work is much appreciated. If you want ideas or more character information, you can contact me ([[*user Dr Vikki Lost]]) literally any time, and I'll probably send you a 20 paragraph essay. \n\nThe general thing to keep in mind is that a lot of the humor in the series comes from the fact that within this horrific anomaly-ridden world, the main troubles at the Twin Sites are admin errors and management oversight. This is kind of a workplace comedy - Lightspeed Inc is a hellscape for it's employees, presenting all the headaches of a management that refuses to communicate their plans. And Site 404/403 is the product of what happens when major parts of an organisation are left underfunded and overlooked. \n\nIt's chaos. But it's a home to the people inside. \n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
