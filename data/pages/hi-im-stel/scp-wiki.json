'Future Pennies' what the hell\"]]\nAs an artist, I think it's healthy for you to look back at your old works and want to puke.  That means you've grown!  You're better at what you do now!  That being said, what the fuck is this article?\n\nI wrote this one back in 2016, and I genuinely couldn't give you more than a few lines of proper commentary on this one if I tried.  I think Future Pennies was supposed to be some sort of commentary on American greed, with the pennies themselves generated by some hostile party in an attempt to demolish the country.  I was planning on some sort of tale to go along with it about some Evil Alien Factory Worker telling his story while he mints the evil pennies and sends them to the US.  Thank god we never got that far, though!\n\nAlright, I'll stop bashing my own work.  To those of you struggling to get started on the site or not sure what to do next with their lives, never forget that no matter how hard it is to believe, the people you look up to and idolize were just like you once.  Whatever kind of journey you're on, just know that the journey is never some glamorous valiant quest where you discover yourself or whatever the fuck - the journey always sucks.  Someday, you'll look back at your own personal Future Pennies and sigh at how young and naive you were.  I promise.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[size 1.2em]][*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3800 SCP-3800 - Many Grandparents Ago][[/size]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-3800\"]]\n**(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%)**\n[[/module]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author Commentary\" hide=\"- \"How wonderful it must have been, long ago when the world was still not known.\"\"]]\n[*https://www.shauntan.net/ Shaun Tan] is one of my favorite authors and illustrators - this one was heavily inspired by his 1998 work, The Rabbits.  The skip itself is a print of one of the works featured in this story.  I've also got a copy IRL, too!  Cool beans!  \n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/hi-im-stel/author%20page%202.png\n|caption=oh shit it's real\n|align=right]]\n\nSuffice to say, this one was brought about by one of my many hyperfixations growing up.  I definitely did want to tell an original story centering around colonialism and anomalous invaders, though.  The word of god with this one is that the -1 instances are some cursed manifestations of ancient would-be colonizers from the Children of the Sun, transformed by 1000's magic to wander the earth and build worthless structures forever.  At least, that's what my intentions were.  Where the print itself comes in and the lore behind what the colonizers were initially trying to accomplish is beyond me.\n\nOut of my older works, this one is definitely the one I want to come back and rewrite the most.  I feel like I had a decent idea going, but didn't have the chops to pull it off yet.  Maybe one of these days!  If you'd like to collab with me on this one hit me up, I'd be down to give it a try.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[size 1.2em]][*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4819 SCP-4819 - Never Miss the Last Day of Summer][[/size]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-4819\"]]\n**(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%)**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author Commentary\" hide=\"- \"Always remember the way home.\"\"]]\nI spent my last day before leaving my hometown with my friends at a park by the lake.  Even now, however many years later, I consider it to be one of my fondest memories.  I can't imagine where I would be if that day never happened.  Essentially, 4819 is just a big inside joke with myself - a way to immortalize a very personal place in a very subtle way.\n\nThat being said, I've always been a fan of 'soft apocalypse' stories, where some horrific catastrophic event has happened in the background but the story focuses more on the bonds between people and personal struggles that come from it.  Despite the TEMPERANCE-PRINCIPALITY event beating the shit out of the Foundation and the world at large, time moves on.  4819 isn't going anywhere.  What happens at that lake between Navares and Rhodes is so incredibly minor in the grand scheme of things, but to those two it means the absolute world.\n\nI'd love to write more stories in this style, where I focus on smaller-scale conflicts with a massive apocalyptic conflict happening in the background.  Will the TEMPERANCE-PRINCIPALITY extended canon happen someday? Hopefully.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[size 1.2em]][*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8883/ SCP-8883 - You are rotting.][[/size]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-8883\"]]\n**(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%)**\n[[/module]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author Commentary\" hide=\"- Dig.  Dig, dig, dig.  Bury this worthless, rotting body.\"]]\n\nAfter 4819 I had sworn off writing for the wiki, as the process of writing articles has always left me pretty drained.  Out of curiosity, I stumbled back onto the site in the midst of the 2024 Anthology series, and suddenly there I was back on my old Sandbox I hadn't touched in five years.\n\n8883 is the most blatant and obvious metaphor for depression you're ever gonna find on this site, but I'm glad it's managed to resonate with so many people.  Because that's how it feels - you know something is inherently wrong with you.  There's something about you that isn't quite human, and it's impossible to really articulate.  Whether it be minute parts of yourself that you obsess over in the mirror or the feeling of your passions slipping away as you watch helplessly, that's 8883.  And no matter how much progress you make, no matter how much you change your mindset or realize that you're more than the things that make you rot, it never truly goes away.  It's a sad reality, for sure, but that's the way it is.\n\nSuffice to say, I'm proud of this one.  I'm glad I was able to put something into existence that so many people can find deep personal meaning in.  As a certified Creator of Things, that's the most wonderful feelings in the world.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[size 1.2em]][*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7041/ SCP-7041 - Prince with a Thousand Enemies][[/size]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-7041\"]]\n**(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%)**\n[[/module]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Author Commentary\" hide=\"- Run for your Life - clipping.\"]]\nI don't have a lot of profound stuff to say about 7041.  This is a super old idea I came up with way before my long break from the site, which initially revolved around a mysterious D-Class evading all attempts at capture to contain an anomalous item.  The idea of having some random guy who's just really good at parkour as your containment procedures seems pretty cool, right?\n\nAdmittedly, though, I'm not very happy with how this one turned out.  The site's grown a lot over the past decade, and I don't think any of my other ancient drafts would fare better than this one.  Still, I'm glad to be done with it.  I don't have any word of god answers about 7041-1 or -2, other than what's stated in the article.  -2 is unspeakably dangerous, and -1 is the only one with the skills needed to contain it.  Simple as.  Writing the incident log for this one was pretty fun, though.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n||[[size 1.5em]]TALES/CANONS[[/size]]||\nMaybe someday!\n@@ @@\n||[[size 1.5em]]SOCIALS[[/size]]||\n= Come and see more funny Stel!
