SCP-6599-1 did not appear affected by the vacuum of space and attempted to float towards SCP-2721-LORD. It punched at the metal exterior a few times before disappearing.\n\nThe reason behind the interaction between the two anomalies is unknown. The SCP-6599 research team has been advised to focus on locating any possible chatrooms or forum boards that may have been visited by both SCP-2721-LORD and SCP-6599 in the last 24 hours.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n> **##grey|bones:##** What the fuck.\n> **##red|HOGSLICE:##** WHAT THE FUCK. -HOGSLICE\n>\n> [[=]]\n> **##red|HOGSLICE##** was banned by **##grey|bones##**.\n> //Reason: No reason given.//\n> [[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
