  "content": "**Name:** Fire, Knight, Fireknight, or Watersday occasionally\n\n**Pronouns:** He/him\n\n**Likes:** Most things that could be considered “nerdy”, animals (preferably vertebrates), anything with enough spectacle to turn a few heads\n\n**Dislikes:** Must I really list these? Seems so negative. But, off the record, if I see one more Scranton Reality Anchor, I am going to lose it.\n\nHowdy hey! I’m a small time author who doesn’t know the meaning of the phrase “too big for his britches” (seriously, what are britches? I could look it up, but that would take all the fun out). Anyway, my hubris is my weapon and I’m about to make that everyone else’s problem. Does any of this rambling make sense? Probably not! I’m writing this while partially sleep deprived because despite being on break, I refuse to have any semblance of a coherent sleep schedule.\n\n[[size 150%]] **Ladies and Gentlemen, One and All, Feast Your Eyes on These Marvelous Works!**[[/size]]\n\n[[include component:author-page order=created_at]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
