Note the white substance that pooled during expulsion (hover to unredact).]]\n----\n**Description:** SCP-6481 is a species of macroparasitic centipede that populates urban hospitals that exhibit unsanitary conditions.\n\nSCP-6481 instances reproduce exclusively inside the human body. Instances perceive no phenotypic sex difference among human hosts whether female, male, or intersex. Each viable instance locomotes into a bodily orifice and navigates the host body, pursuing the mammary glands. After having settled, it lays 60–150 eggs inside the mammary alveoli. These eggs have a median incubation period of 14 days.\n\nAfter the eggs hatch, the parent instance secretes prolactin into the surrounding intramammary veins, thereby promoting lactation and providing sustenance for the offspring.\n\nAt the onset of maturity, offspring traverse the lactiferous ducts and egress through the nipples ({{__Fig. 1.1__}}). Fully developed adult instances reach lengths of 15 cm.\n\nA different approach is taken in the event that an SCP-6481 instance reproduces inside a child-rearing host. When its offspring reach maturity and are ready to leave the body, the instances secrete pheromones that induce the host to breastfeed. During breastfeeding, the human infant chokes on SCP-6481 offspring and expires. Then, the offspring feed on the corpse from the inside out. After organ consumption, SCP-6481 instances egress through the bodily orifices.\n\nThe behaviour SCP-6481 exhibit when exposed to pregnant hosts is presently under investigation.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n= **Investigatory Findings**\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box grey-tint\"]]\n**BACKGROUND:** Golden Valley Medical Centre was an independent hospital in Ontario, Canada, which provided for-profit health care. It administered maternity care, long-term care, and various other services. Erected in 1953, the aging building complex required costly renovations and maintenance from 2010 onwards. Amid financial straits, the hospital’s operating company consolidated its services, and relocated its staff, supplies, and equipment to sister facility Silver Hill General Hospital.\n\nIt underwent liquidation bankruptcy in 2021.\n\nQueen’s Park[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The seat of the Provincial Parliament of Ontario.[[/span]] declared the hospital condemned in 2022 and issued its demolition at a later date.\n\n**SCP-6481 CONTEXT:** Golden Valley’s Maternity Ward sustained a frequency of SCP-6481 activity that was significantly greater than the yearly average among other hospitals. All instances to date have been successfully contained and their effects concealed. The Canadian Vital Statistics Registry also reported a disproportionately large number of miscarriages at Golden Valley in the same period. These factors, alongside its vacancy, designated Golden Valley a suitable candidate for investigation.\n\nShortly before its demolition, a covert research team helmed by Mobile Task Force Psi-0 (“Cassandra’s Canaries”) commenced an investigation at Golden Valley under the guise of a geotechnical survey.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box grey-tint\"]]\n+++ VIDEO LOG\n----\n**DATE:** 30 April 2022\n\n**OBJECTIVE:** Determine a source for SCP-6481 activity.\n\n**NOTE:** MTF-Ψ-0 piloted an autonomous telemetry drone into the Golden Valley Medical Centre. It engaged in exploration activities for 32 hours.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box grey-tint\"]]\n= [[span class=\"terminal-span\"]][BEGIN LOG][[/span]]\n----\n||= **RAISA NOTICE -- Log Format:** //Footage Source **|** Footage Description// ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n= [[size 110%]]{{[IRRELEVANT EXPLORATORY DATA OMITTED FOR BREVITY]}}[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**DRONE CAMERA |** Drone hovers 2 m above the lip of a trench that was excavated along the southern exterior of the hospital complex.\n\n**AUXILIARY SITE CAMERA |** Drone descends; exits view.\n\n**DRONE CAMERA |** Drone descent continues below grade, capturing exposed underground utilities. At [[$ d=−24m $]], it meets the bottom and travels eastward, following the trench laterally until it terminates. Drone identifies a narrow gap in the base of the trench wall. It enters into a subterranean junction.\n\n**LASER-ILLUMINATED INFRARED CAMERA |** Travel continues north, along the ceiling of a tunnel that depresses for 45 m and resolves at an antechamber. Numerous SCP-6481 instances linger in a heap, beshrouding a warm (≈37°C), humid space beyond. Drone advances. Instances adhere to the drone, exercising coordinated swarming to block ingress; the drone continues undeterred.\n\nDrone enters a pitch-dark, cavernous chamber embedded deep in the earth. Positional data indicate the Maternity Ward is located at grade-level above. Camera swivels downward. The entire chamber is panoptic in layout, and at its base, terminates in a platform overlooking a large basin structure. Abutting the chamber walls are hundreds of organic pods. Each one is enmeshed in a thin, moist, translucent membrane resembling human flesh pulled taut. Many pods contain infants resting inside, though some sit vacant. The pods constitute a ringed stack extruding from the floor to the chamber’s ceiling.\n\nDrone descends to basin-level. A dense cluster of SCP-6481 instances line the basin’s rim. Camera tilts 60° upward.\n\nIn the middle of the chamber, a colossal SCP-6481 instance (**6481-ALPHA**) jockeys pods by the meticulous use of hundreds of legs in tandem. Each pod contains a human with a fatty body plan and elongated, slender limbs. Body proportions are roughly adult. The humans are nude and inactive, with inflamed chests pulsating rhythmically and facial cavities covered in paste.\n\n6481-ALPHA is immersed in an opaque white substance containing a mixture of water, C,,12,,H,,22,,O,,11,,-rich carbohydrates, lipids, protein, and other, trace minerals. It wades in a pool of unknown depth, masking additional submerged legs. Its thorax measures at least 15 m.\n\n6481-ALPHA readies a pod just anterior to its mouth. The human inside crawls around in a quick, erratic manoeuvre, mimicking that of a centipede. The pod tips backward; 6481-ALPHA quickly feeds on the human contained within, crushing its torso with sharp mandibles, and then disposes of the depleted form.\n\n[[div class=\"imagediv\"]]\n[[image scp-6481-hands.jpg]]\n||~ {{__Fig. 1.2__}} ||\n[[/div]]\n\nDrone creates distance between 6481-ALPHA and itself, now inspecting the platform. Here, a number of other humans mill at the pods along the wall. Each individual human is frail; these humans are of advanced age. Distending from each human’s abdomen is a deflated sac covered in papilla. Drone inspects a nearby pod. One human crouches and interfaces with the pod. It employs a sac to nourish the infant through stored calcium deposits.\n\nAnother human of this stature undergoes movement. Drone follows the human. It lowers its body to a prone position and ambulates, steadily dragging itself. Its limbs tremor; thin, long, and atrophied. A thick, white substance trails behind it, marked with human handprints ({{__Fig. 1.2__}}).\n\n@@ @@\n\n= [[size 110%]]{{[.@@@@.@@@@.]}}[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nDrone continues exploring and sampling this area for several hours before exiting.\n----\n= [[span class=\"terminal-span\"]][END LOG][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box grey-tint\"]]\n++++ __AFTERWORD__\n\nThe former Golden Valley Medical Centre was levelled on 2 May 2022 without further consequence.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footing\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-6480]]] | SCP-6481 | [[[SCP-6482]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"centered\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Ellie3 & Lt Flops]]\n[[<]]\n=====\n> **Name:** Pasteurized milk\n> **Author:** Aejahnke\n> **License:** [*https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported (CC BY-SA 3.0)]\n> **Source Link:** [*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pasteurized_milk.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Name:** Centipede in our Hotel room\n> **Author:** [*https://www.flickr.com/photos/brewbooks/ brewbooks]\n> **License:** [*https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 Generic (CC BY-SA 2.0)]\n> **Source Link:** [*https://flic.kr/p/4EgBWc Flickr]\n\n> **Note:** Edited by [[*user Lt Flops]].
