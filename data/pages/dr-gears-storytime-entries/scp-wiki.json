  "content": "+ Introduction\n\nIn many ways, I question my entry here.  To even attempt to put myself in the same realm of Black Fedora and Josef K seems like a terrible sacrilege.  Still, I have been told that my little chat stories have merit as creepypasta, so in the spirit of greater entertainment, I now post them here for your enjoyment.\n\n------\n\n[[[Reentry]]]\n\n[[[Swimmer]]]\n\n[[[The Vault]]]\n\n[[[Influenza]]]\n\n[[[Meteor]]]\n\n[[[Late Night]]]\n\n[[[Peeled]]]\n\n[[[Knives]]]\n\n[[[Jaywalk]]]\n\n[[[Devotion]]]\n\n[[[Feverish]]]\n\n[[[Cold]]]\n\n[[[Alone]]]\n\n[[[Mice]]]\n\n[[[Elevator]]]\n\n[[[Potty]]]\n\n[[[Life Saver]]]\n\n[[[Bloody]]]\n\n[[[Mad Love]]]\n\n[[[Sa Jin (Photo)]]]\n\n[[[Breaker 1-9]]]\n\n[[[Delia]]]\n\n[[[Climber]]]\n\n[[[Shy]]]\n\n[[[Dog Man]]]\n\n[[[Sleep It Off]]]\n\n[[[Puffy]]]\n\n[[[Washed Away]]]\n\n[[[The Rainforest House]]]\n\n[[[Marathon]]]\n------\n\nOccasionally, I get ambitions and write something above and beyond short creepypasta.  Here are stories that slip over in to the \"short story\" realm.  Longer, but I hope still worth the price of admission.\n\n------\n\n[[[Stitches]]]\n\n[[[Love/Hate]]]\n\n[[[The Dire Mother]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
