Please leave some criticism.\n\nIn writing this out, it started as an innocent puppy-like car. Then, believe it or not, that changed a little.\n\nI wrote Abelsonâ€™s part focused on finding John because, in any situation, regardless of specifics, my first concern would be finding my partner and making sure they're safe. I wanted to include something like that in the tale so it could be a bit of a gift to my wife when she read it, and because I would like to dedicate all my writing to her, Abelson being an analog of myself, and John of her. Still, I completely understand how some viewers can misconstrue it as me wanting to define Abelson solely by John, which I wanted to address and sincerely apologize for. Should this be a primary concern for anyone, please PM me and I'll begin to work on revisions.\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n\n[[module ListPages category=\"fragment\" parent=\".\" order=\"created_at\" limit=\"1\" offset=\"@URL|0\"]]\n[[div class=\"meta-title\"]]\n%%title%%\n[[/div]]\n%%content%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[!-- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:scp-7484-0 --]\n[!-- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:scp-7484-1 --]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=--V--173]]\n> **Filename:** ROC-MOTC-DGH_Keelung_Motor_Vehicles_Supervision_Station_20100330.jpg\n> **Author:**  Solomon203\n> **License: CC BY-SA 3.0**\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROC-MOTC-DGH_Keelung_Motor_Vehicles_Supervision_Station_20100330.jpg\n> **Derivative of:** N/A\n> **Additional Notes:** Let's pretend it's an unidentifiable make and model and also not in Taiwan rather than the U.S. since that interferes with things.\n\n> **Filename:** Red_SCP_Logo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user V173]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/\n> **Additional Notes:** (Optional)\n> **Derivative Of:** (Below)\n> **Name:** header-logo.svg, body_bg.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr_grom]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://github.com/Grombald/Common-Theme GitHub]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n@@ @@",
