Only this strong secondhand evidence, and a number of coincidences are currently known to the Foundation. \n> \n> EE-3682 has no containment protocols, and its designation as an object is maintained in such an event. This record is presented as evidence and warning in real time. Plans have been prepared as to how to prevent such a thing from happening again, and where it may happen, and what may have caused it.\n\n**Event Designation:** EE-3682\n\n[[include component:image-block name=church.jpg|caption=Site containing evidence of EE-3682.]]\n\n**Preceding Events:** Evidence of EE-3682 was first considered based on further investigation into urban legends in Sakha, Russia referring to hitchhikers and travelers who asked directions to a town that did not exist. The traveler would refer to the scenery around the nonexistent town. No consensus or verifiable memetic properties have been identified, but locals sometimes refer to a town named Volodin, or Volodi, located in a valley in a grove of flowers.\n\n\"Volodin\" may have been discovered in a region nearby matching the description. Located in the center of the valley is a dilapidated, 20 occupant church. No other signs of human occupancy in the 30 miÂ² area were detectable. Located within the church were a 15cm ivory knife located on the altar, a machete, a garbage can lid, a first aid kit, a satchel, a note, 9 VHS tapes, and the skeleton of a young woman (20) who is lying on her stomach, positioned with her hand touching the altar. The altar was covered with a thin layer of congealed blood. The blood, when tested, was that of a human fetus. The blood has congealed in such a way that would suggest the object bled out there.\n\nOne resident of the town of Tomtor matched dental records and DNA of the corpse but otherwise showed no other signs of relation to it. The individual [REDACTED] did recall visiting the area at one time, but was not able to remember when.\n\nVHS tapes were secured in the altar cabinet within the church. This space was nailed in and secured with duct tape. The tapes contain images of a town that is not currently known to exist. It is not known if the tapes were compiled to arrange a narrative. Due to damage of these tapes it is not known which order these events occurred in, if these events occurred.\n\n**Item 0:** A note, in Russian.\n\n> It happened fast, I think. April 16th, 2018. It's happened everywhere. There was no warning. We don't know why this happened. If you find this, I'm sure I'll be dead. My bones grind when I walk. It is excruciating. I am lucky I had access to my father's medicine.\n> \n> The thing couldn't change me. Or something helped me.\n> \n> If I succeeded, you need to find Iepureanu.\n\n**Item 1:** Tape 1. Written in the center space is \"Ezekiel Valeriy Iepureanu, last seen in Moldova.\" The VHS is an overwritten copy of \"Homeward Bound\".\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Load\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n\n> //Paid promotional advertisement for a can opener, 4 seconds.//\n> \n> //Footage of a woman opening a can of green beans with an electric can opener.//\n> \n> **Voice Over:** ...and you can do all of this and more without injury...\n> \n> //The audio is interrupted by an old man chuckling.//\n\n> Footage of the internals of a beehive, 5 minutes.\n\n> //Street view of an unknown city in Russia.

No markings. An entity is visible on each of the tapes, inter-cutting itself into the footage sporadically.

[//chuckles//] Oh what a beautiful day it is, yes.\n> \n> //The man takes a moment to write something on parchment, seemingly forgetting about the viewer. He takes several minutes, occasionally looking outside onto a view of the city in its affected state. The man turns to the camera again, looking surprised.//\n> \n> **Man:** Ah, yes. The Lord comes now for all of his faithful, and for those who at least did no harm, I hope. Hmm. But what can we say for them. I digress.\n> \n> **Man:** If you're seeing this, GOOD! If you suffer well through the tribulation, you may just be worthy to serve the Lord our God later in Heaven!\n> \n> **Man:** Ah, or you can say to hell with it.
