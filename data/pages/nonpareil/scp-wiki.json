Set her down; she’s not going anywhere.\n              She’ll have finished her transformation by tomorrow.”\nI put her egg down on the seat\nand continued to eat,\nsavoring the taste \nof my own imperfections.\n----\n----\nShe was born the next day\nat the dinner table. The egg cracked and then ceased\nto exist, shattered into infinitesimally small bits\nby a dragonfly of jade and gold. She buzzed\ncontentedly as I held her in my arms,\nadmiring the circuitry in her wings.\n I crooned to her\nto let her know that I was there.\nShe brought her head to meet mine.\nWe connected, man and beyond-man.\nI kissed her, savoring\nComplex mouthparts, dexterous legs\nLithe exoskeleton, slender antennae\nDeep eyes, lofty wings\nA scent of perfection to which I could only dream to aspire.\n----\n----\nJust me and her now,\nman and beyond-man. What was she seeing, thinking\nin that body beyond my mere comprehension?\nThe cybernetic capsule within her head,\nseat of her human emotions, that last\nVestige of imperfection in a body\nthat was above my own. How could I love her any less\nknowing that she was destined to surpass me.\nBut for now, us together\nsharing the jointed metamorphosis\nof this body of hers, more beautiful than before\na soft, wet, warm thorax\nwings ripe with the scent of ambition\nA mind built to perceive\nA soul meant to dream\nA body created to achieve\nA destiny within the stars.\n----\n----\nShe left me the way she entered\nin a flash that changed my life\nI ate her and took her capsule\nSeat of her mind\nSeat of her emotions\nSeat of her previous imperfection\nwhy\nWhy did I eat her\nwhat dream did I have\nthat I would seek to ruin hers?\nDoes she realize what has happened\nIs this a nightmare\nthis impulse to consume\nThis horrific imperfection\nHow do I save her from myself\nJoin her in the capsule\nconnect to her mind\nUploaded to her world.\nShe tasted of everything I wanted to be.\n----\n----\nstars. a platform. the sea.\njust us. her imperfect body. the one we shared.\nwhat can I tell her\nhow do i save her dream\nshe knows\nshe looks at me and\nthe virtual ocean in her eyes\nthe burning of a sun in her heart\nshe knows and\nshe still loves me\nis this a dream?\ndespite my imperfection\nthrough the nightmare\nthe nightmare i created\nshe still loves me\nshe was never imperfect\nshe has always been perfect\nshe has always been headed for the stars\nthis is her dream\nso this is my dream\nshe can have my body\nmetamorphosize and find the stars\ni remain in the capsule\nstars. platforms. the sea.\n----\n----\nSometimes she visits.\ntells me stories of the stars\ntells me of the metamorphosized body I once had\nand of the stars it visited.\nthe stars she visited.\nThey sound beautiful.\nI look at the false ocean \nand look at the virtual stars\nand wonder what might have been \nin this dream\nwhat we might have been together\nbut \nshe is happy.\nthe stars are open to her.\nthis is the dream.\nthis is my perfection.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
