As you see the time, you greet it with an audible groan as there's only a few hours until you need to be up. \n\nYou've always struggled to sleep, but it's been particularly worse as of yet. Any sleep you do get is disturbed. Intruded by dreams of her, and more recently, dreams of it. You turn the pillow over, hoping the cold side will seduce you to sleep. It does not.\n\nYou could never understand how people could easily fall asleep. Just climb into bed and turn off, unplagued by all the worries and fears which currently stream through your mind. Thinking on this, you realise you're even further from sleep than a few moments ago and berate yourself. \n\nTime passes. Five minutes? Ten? You could look at your phone and find out but is it worth the glare of the blue light? \n\nMaybe it would be better to get up now? Start the day earlier than planned, but use the tiredness to get an early night when evening comes? Or do you attempt, once more, to rest?\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: 1.0em 1.0em; text-align: center; border: 8px solid #141618; background-color: #a3a1a6; width: 50%;\"]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-always-ends-the-same/offset/13 |Get up; try and start the day fresh.]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: 1.0em 1.0em; text-align: center; border: 8px solid #141618; background-color: #a3a1a6; width: 50%;\"]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-always-ends-the-same/offset/14 |Rest; try to fall asleep.]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]",
