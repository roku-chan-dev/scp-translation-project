Any footage of the object is to be taken down under cover story CC-1221 (\"Copyright Claims\").\n\nSCP-8984 is currently contained in a standard containment chamber at [[[scp-2910-jp|Site-311]]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-8984 is an amorphous mass fluctuating between 1 and 2 meters in height which levitates approximately 1.5 meters off the ground at all times. Its surface constantly displays an ever-changing array of images, the meaning of which is currently unknown. The object is sentient and capable of telepathic communication within a range of 5 meters.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8984 was originally discovered when it manifested in downtown Manhattan, USA on April 2nd, 2024. Though there was a minor panic when SCP-8984 was initially observed by bystanders, most civilians quickly resumed their routine even after SCP-8984 communicated with them. It is unknown how long the object remained //in situ// before being detected by Foundation plants in the area, however, due to New York City's Native Unusuality Reading, the use of amnestics was opted against.\n\n**Interview Log 8056.22:** The following document is an interaction between SCP-8984 and Researcher Mallory. This interaction was routine as per Ethics Committee Dictate 7.26.D[[footnote]] Dictate 7.26.D declares that all non-dangerous or breach-inclined anomalies are to be spoken to by designated Foundation personnel in order to maintain their social skills and keep them from becoming withdrawn. [[/footnote]].\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n//[Mallory enters SCP-8984's chamber. She approaches it and smiles. SCP-8984 continues to display contextually unknown images across the surface of its body.]//\n\n**Mallory:** Hello, 8984.\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{HELLO.}}\n\n**Mallory:** How are you doing today?\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{CONFUSED.}}\n\n**Mallory:** What's got you confused?\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{YOU DO NOT FEAR ME.}}\n\n**Mallory:** Are we supposed to? //[Mallory folds her arms.]//\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{YES.}}\n\n**Mallory:** Well, to be honest, at first we were concerned you were broadcasting memetic hazards, but once we ruled that out we just kind of assumed you were just a weird blob that shows weirder pictures. That's nothing to be scared about.\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{AS I UNDERSTAND IT, YOUR ORGANIZATION DEALS IN MY KIND OF HORRORS. CORRECT?}}\n\n**Mallory:** I suppose so.\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{SO IT IS SAFE TO ASSUME YOU WOULD NOT BE FEARFUL. HOWEVER, THE CIVILIANS I ENCOUNTERED DID NOT FEAR ME EITHER.}}\n\n**Mallory:** This is New York, sweetheart. If you want people's attention you've gotta really try.\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{BUT I SHOW YOU HORRORS OF THE DISTANT FUTURE.}}\n\n**Mallory:** Yeah, you've said that before. But none of what you're showing us looks like... well... anything.\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{PERHAPS I AM TOO SOFT IN MY DELIVERY METHOD.}}\n\n//[SCP-8984 levitates 2 meters off the ground and emits a red light while continuing to display images of unknown context.]//\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{FEAR ME, MORTAL.}}\n\n//[Mallory shields her eyes.]//\n\n**Mallory:** Ah!\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{YES! IT IS WORKING! NOW YOU KNOW WHAT AWAITS YOU! NOW YOU KNOW THAT YOU MUST CHANGE YOUR WAYS, OR FACE HORRORS BEYOND YOUR COMPREHENSION!}}\n\n**Mallory:** I think that's your problem. You're showing us things that we just don't understand, so we can't really be scared of them.\n\n//[SCP-8984 comes back down to its average levitation height of 1.5 meters and ceases emitting light.]//\n\n**SCP-8984:** {{... I MUST PONDER. TAKE YOUR LEAVE, MORTAL.}}\n\n**Mallory:** Sure thing, 8984. Take it easy.\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8983]]] | SCP-8984 | [[[SCP-8985]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
