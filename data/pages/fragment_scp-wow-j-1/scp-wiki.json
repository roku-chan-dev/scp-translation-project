SCP-WOW-J is theorized to be in a standard containment cell in Site-107. \n\nThe entities in question are to remain in questions?\n\n██████ ██████ ███████████ ██ ███████████, ███ ███████-██ \"█████ ████\" ███ ██████████ ██ ██████ ██ ███████ ██ ███████ ███ █████████ █████████ ██ ███████ ███ █████████████ ██ ███████-███████ ███████ ████████ ██ ████ ██████ ████████ ███████ ██ ███ ███████ ████████'█ █████████.\n\nMaybe in a bucket.  Maybe...\n\nIt must be given a doggo three times a day.\n\nUnder no circumstances should this document be deleted from the Foundation databanks.\n\n**Description:** SCP-WOW-J is to be considered a 5 km by 5 km by 5km cube. SCP-WOW-J's almost random description errors are assumed to be due to its anomalous nature. SCP-WOW-J cannot be intentionally observed. SCP-WOW-J also causes any personnel to indirectly see it as a different anomalous object. Foundation researchers are sure that SCP-WOW-J harbours a memetic effect. We're not sure what it is, but there definitely is one. If you figure it out, send it to scp.wow.j.research@gmail.com, thanks. Foundation researchers are also encouraged to submit their SCP-WOW-J forms to their Site head.\n\n**Addendum 01:** In the event of SCP-WOW-J continuing, all parties who participated in the creation of SCP-WOW-J are to be ████████ ███ ████ ████ ████ ████. ████ ████ ████ ███ ███, ███ ████ ███ ███████ ██, ███████.\n\n\n**Addendum 02:**\nThe author of this SCP, Dr. Pavel, was resigned to Kegel duty following his unwillingness to adhere to O5 orders.\n\n+++ [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-wow-j/offset/0 « BACK]\n\n[[size 0%]] if there's a god please just let me die [[/size]]",
