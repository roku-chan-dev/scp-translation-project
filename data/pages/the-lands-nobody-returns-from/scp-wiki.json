He took a deep breath, walking through its threshold, exhaling again only upon exchanging looks with the woman. He was ready.\n\nIt only took a few words between them to set everything up -- most of the agreement remained unsaid, but one thing was certain: she couldn't help him within the Forest. There, he would be alone. She wouldn't risk that much for a stranger.\n\nWith just a snap of her fingers in an alleyway hidden from view, the fabric of reality momentarily shattered as a green line formed a circle within the boundaries of existence. It cut away its insides, playing with the strings that made the world what it was, and the gateway to his destination was ready. He walked through.\n\nWhere he went, Nobody didn't see his own people. Instead, he saw fear.\n\nHundreds if not thousands of [[[taboo|broken people with their bodies twisted into forms that mocked them, forever trapped in a hell designed by their own queen]]]. They screamed with not insanity or fear, but with sadness, tainting their green prison with world-shattering sorrow. Endless sadness of their lost world, pouring from every single one of them.\n\nWith a heavy heart, he walked along the path, piercing the shroud of their trap, trying to aid a single one of the lost souls, only to be met not with hostility. He felt like he needed to aid them -- he wasn't sure why, but... something deep within made him care. He felt that, at a certain level, they were the same. Soulless vessels left by the universe to rot, forever stranded between life and death.\n\nWith each step he took deeper into the forest he saw more despair until sorrow was all he could feel. It overwhelmed him, trying to make him one of its prisoners. And that's when he understood.\n\nThe people trapped here weren't aggressive by choice; they were like an animal caught in a trap, desperate enough to chew its own leg off just to escape what awaited it. If he had eyes, he would weep. Not because he was an emphatic person, no, but because he could not bear what felt like his own people suffering.\n\nFor days he walked the only path there was, marching tirelessly to find something, nay, //anything// that would explain this place. But, for each time he looped around the endless road the path was, he did not understand anything more.\n\nOnly after his hundredth journey around the domain of the nameless did he realize that to truly become one with them and be able to help his people, he must become what they truly feel. With a heavy heart, he disobeyed the mage's instructions, stepping out of the only safe path into the forest to aid one of the hurt people.\n\nAt first, the entity that once had been a Fae was terrified at who Nobody was, screaming into the skies about how the Queen will never get them, trying to use one last-ditch effort to save themselves from a doom far worse than their current fate. But Nobody didn't double back; instead, shushed them, coming closer while attempting the skeletal equivalent of a smile. The only response he got was shock at the fact the Forest did not take him as a punishment for disobeying its sacred rules, but when he told them who he was, they immediately understood everything, calming down in a matter of seconds.\n\nHe asked what happened, pointing at their wound, only to hear a trembling voice speak of the Queen taking control of some of the inhabitants of her hell in an attempt to kill them, this time for good. He nodded with understanding, and asked one simple question -- \"Where is the Queen?\" He did not know why, but something deep within him -- deep within the soul of Nobody, the soul of the Hunter, and the soul of the nameless that felt like a part of their kin -- told him he needed to go there.\n\nAnd the Nameless showed him.\n\nWith his crossbow ready he walked where they pointed him to, approaching one diseased spawn of Mab after the other, pulling the trigger of his sacred weapon over and over until the accursed were free of her mocking touch. He purified every one of the unfortunate he met on his path, his bolts soaring through the sky like lightning smiting sinners. He didn't want to do this, for they were his people, but there was no other way.\n\nIn just a matter of what felt like millennia, they were gone. The Forest was once again free of the Queen's touch, making it the holy sanctuary it should be once again.\n\nThat was when he felt it -- an entity he could feel was evil incarnate, seeping into the man-shaped hole in place of his soul. It told him of everything it could give him, should he simply provide it with a host. It told him parts of his real name and the stories about who he once had been, saying it could give him all of that back and more if he was kind enough to let it in for one simple second.\n\nIt showed him everything and everywhen in the void it was, shrieking the name of time itself in a final attempt to take him over. But it was all futile. With one final bolt of his weapon, he pierced its very essence. And then everything went silent.\n\nHe did not kill it, no; nothing nor anyone could fully kill a demon so powerful, but he destroyed all of her essence which remained in the Forest, freeing the forever-wandering from their pain. At least for now -- he knew she would return, wanting to destroy them one more time. Their still-namelessness wasn't good for her. She needed more. And yet, despite all of this, deep within him, he felt his mission there was complete.\n\nHe came back to the fellow to whom he gave the promise of revenge, telling them of all that he'd done. At first, they did not believe him, thinking him a liar -- but the scars on his bones and damage done to his coat were enough evidence on their own. They took a deep breath, and, as a sign of thanking him for what he'd done, they told him of his real name in a way a human could understand.\n\n[[[the-beast-that-shouted-i-at-the-end-of-the-world|His name was Damien Nowak]]].\n\nBut that sentence carried one more message: a call to war with of a group he'd hesitate to call anything but the spawn of the devil himself. A group so foul as to wish to bring the Queen back into reality, to cast this fate onto every single living being it would find. Nobody shuttered, realizing what a threat this was.\n\nTriumviraté.\n\nHe knew what had to be done. He swore to them he shall not rest until they were eradicated from this Earth, forever. As a sign of the truthfulness of what he said, he told the Fae they could take his name if they simply wished to. But, despite their situation, they refused, saying that the name he had was his and his only, telling him he now had a goal to fulfill.\n[[/==]]\n\n[[size 1%]]##transparent|.##[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"page nobody\"]]\n**__12th October, 2003__** \n@@ @@\nMy name is long gone, and I am no longer who I had been so long ago.
