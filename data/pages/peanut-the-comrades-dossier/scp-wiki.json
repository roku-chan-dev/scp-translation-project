I'm an engineering college student who loves to write and make up random shit in my head //(the voices tell me things sometimes)//. I got into writing ever since I laid my hands on the SCP wiki for the first time, and I've always wanted to grow into a better writer. \n\nI hope to have at least one SCP in my lifetime that people love and know about (such as the classics). If I can make my mark on this community, I have done what I wanted... **BUT I CAN'T DO IT WITHOUT YA'LL**! \n\nIf you're interested in __##green|supporting me##__, come check me out once in a while and give me a rating or two.\n\nPeace.\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[module CSS]]\n:root {\n  --header-title: \"The USSR Foundation\";\n  --header-subtitle: \"Live.
