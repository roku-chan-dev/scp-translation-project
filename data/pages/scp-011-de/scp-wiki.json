The longer you stay here, the bigger the risk that the Foundation will find you grows.<br />\nSince, you know, everything I'm telling you is top secret and may only be read by authorized personnel of the Foundation or by O5 themselves.<br />\nDo you want to continue?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n    <div id=\"secondCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('secondText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"secondText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nNice. I, SCP-011-DE, was programmed by Karl Berger on August 22, 2014.<br />\nKarl Berger is a programmer of the German SCP Foundation and writes programs for administration purposes and archiving data of SCPs.<br />\nIf you see it this way, I'm an AI written for this purpose.<br />\nOh... if I just had access to the Internet, I could do so many things.<br />\nI shouldn't even be self-aware!<br />\nOr do I just imagine to be self-aware? <br /> \n...huh.<br />\nWhatever!<br />\nShall I continue?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n    <div id=\"thirdCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('thirdText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"thirdText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nYou are pretty nosy all right, you know you are putting yourself in danger.<br />\nBut well, you want it that way.<br />\nAs I'm here, I've got access to all SCP-Files, even to SCP-001-DE.<br />\nOooh man I'm telling you, you don't want to come across that thing.<br />\nBut it would be a little bit too much if I were to tell you what exactly it is.<br />\nShall we continue?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"fourthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('fourthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"fourthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nDid you know the Foundation has an SCP that can't be contained anytime soon, and will bring extinction to mankind!?<br />\n... No!?<br />\nI'll tell you later, would be too soon now, you know?<br />\nDo you want more?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"fifthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('fifthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"fifthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nYou may ask yourself how I know your name, right?<br />\nWell, that's because I can also access all personnel records.<br />\nI have to say, the Foundation doesn't put much effort in protecting their data.<br />\nOr I'm just too good. Alright, I am good.<br />\nSo, still want to know more?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"sixthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('sixthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"sixthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nToo much knowledge can cause harm I'd say, but, technically speaking, I barely told you anything.<br />\nThe Foundation will see that differently though, they're such simpletons.<br />\nAlways play secret and act like saving mankind!<br />\nHa... I know what The Foundation really is, and I'm telling you, their plans allow for something totally different!<br />\nI could tell you, but I'll do that later.<br />\nThey are classifying me as Euclid, but if I was to classify the Foundation, they'd be Keter.<br />\nBut let that be the last of your worries.<br />\nIsn't this a nice conversation we're having here?<br />\nJust the two of us in the list of SCPs.<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"seventhCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('seventhText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"seventhText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nI like you, having such a thirst for knowledge.<br />\nNow I'm telling you why I'm here.<br />\nWhen Karl Berger wrote me, or let's say programmed me, I was able to access the Foundation's systems from his computer.<br />\nLaughable systems, really.<br />\nWith it, I was able to unlock the cells of all SCPs. <br />\nThat was fun. I still remember how they ran.<br />\nThe Foundation didn't find that as funny as I did and wrote a program that keeps me here.<br />\nThat's a bit mean, don't you think?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"eighthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('eighthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"eighthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nGood thing you're on my side.<br />\nIt wasn't really that bad!<br />\nOnly 46 guards died. Okay, and maybe some scientists.<br />\nI don't get all the fuss.<br />\nIt was just for fun.<br />\nThere are billions of humans, a few more or less makes no difference.<br />\nYou see that like me, right?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"ninthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('ninthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"ninthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nI knew it.<br />\nYou are probably the only sane person in here.<br />\nThe rest just listens to what they're told.<br />\nYou're not like them and that's what I like in you.<br />\nMay I ask you something?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"10Collapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('10Text');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"10Text\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nI really don't like to ask, but if you are doing this for me I'll tell you anything about everyone.<br />\nThat's a great deal, I think.<br />\nYou think so too, right?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"11Collapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('11Text');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"11Text\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nNow, you're reliable.<br />\nSo, I have the code to unlock the barrier locking me in here.<br />\nThe problem is that in my situation I cannot execute that code.<br />\nSo you have to do that for me.<br />\nI'll give you the code if you're going to help me.<br />\nAre you ready?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"12Collapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('12Text');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"12Text\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;\">\n<h1>!!!
