It was Dark. I sat in my cramped space for I don't know how long. He opened the door, as light flooded the room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Dr. ███████:** So, Sarah. Let's talk. \n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** What's this about? Was I too rough last breach, or... what?\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** No no, nothing like that. We just need a few things for our records.\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** O-okay. What'd ya need?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe dragged me out of the room, and I screamed like they always told me to. I had an audience now.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Dr. ███████:** We need an account of your situation prior to joining, using your words. That's all.\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Why? You guys know my background.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** Yes, yes. To be quite honest, this is just red tape. But, you never know. Something important might come up from what you say. Never hurts to be sure.\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Yeah, I suppose. Not much to talk about though.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHe opened the door to my cage and led me to the bar room. In front of me was a man. Large, fat, drunk. He boasted wildly of what he'd do to me. He laughed to my face.\n\nHe was convinced he was the one. I was afraid. I charged him.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=scp-location3.jpg|\n    caption=Reported location:\n████████; New York, New York, ██/██/1903 \n]]\n>http://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/642524\n\n> **Dr. ███████:** Give it a shot.\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Well. I was adopted, abducted as a baby, whatever you want to call it, by a couple of folks. E████ and T█████ Crowely. They were brothers, working together in managing some kind of fighting ring. Dunno if it was legal or not.\n> \n> [pause]\n> \n> Probably not. \n> \n> It wasn't really a good situation. They treated me more like a rabid dog than an actual kid.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** I'm sorry that happened. Could you go into more detail for me?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Well, I don't know what you want me to say.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nI went for his legs. His weight betrayed him as I swept them aside. When he hit the floor with a thud, I latched onto his back.\n\nThe audience cheered. They wanted blood.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Dr. ███████:** Try.\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** ... They taught me how to fight for as far back as I can remember. Called me the \"Savage Slant\" like I was part of some freak show, and threw me out to the ring to fight grown-ass men. When I was seven.\n> \n> \"The child of the snow, raised from the savage north of Mongolia\" or some shit was their pitch. \"Come and see if you could take her on.\"\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** You're... Japanese though?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Yep. Born in Musashi, raised here. Surprised you knew that.\n> \n> But yeah, apparently it was easier to sell a Chinese monster to a bunch of bumpkins than a Japanese one. Go figure.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** Huh. So, you said that you were seven when you started fighting?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Yep. Well, I think. I don't really know, that's my best estimate. I coulda been eight, coulda been nine. Could even be ten. Mind you, this was... what, 15 years ago? I didn't have any concept of time back then, so it's all just this big chunk of \"I dunno\".\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** Okay. We'll mark that down as 'unsure'. So, how did you survive? You said you fought against grown men? When you were just a young girl?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** Yeah. And I won each time.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** I'm sorry, what?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI wrapped my arms around his head and went for his eyes. As I bit off his ear, he rolled on the floor, trying to get me off. I spit out a chunk of him and went to his neck to take another. He lost when my hardened nails split his eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Agent Crowely:** I uhh... I won most of them.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** H-how?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** I don't know, I just did. \n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** I'm... having trouble understanding. \n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** I just... tried really hard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI threw him aside, and he fumbled around blindly, trying to escape. He smelled of piss. My hands were coated in red. Before I could protest, the brothers wrapped the man-catcher around my neck and led me back to the cage.\n\nMy job was done, but I refused. I swallowed my fear. I charged.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **Dr. ███████:** Sarah, you realize how insane this sounds, right?\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** I don't know what to tell you. You have any idea what I did back then?\n> \n> I threw them out of the ring and broke their back. I slammed them to the ground and gouged their eyes out. I spit and chewed off bits of their face with filed teeth. It's why... It's why my hands are... it's why they're burned like this.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** It's okay Sarah, you don't have to-\n> \n> **Agent Crowely:** No. You don't get to do this to me, and then expect me to stop. Every night, I was put in that fucking cage. They put me in there, grabbed my hand, and held my fingers over a candle to make my nails hard as rock. Then, they filed tooth and nail so I could fight with them. Almost. Every. Night.\n> \n> And you wanna know the fucked up part? They made me enjoy it. Tearing off limbs was the only real \"interaction\" I had with people. My life was either \"cage\" or \"fight.\" And I did my damned best in the fighting 'cause... it'd make my time in the cage go by easier.\n> \n> That kind of thing... it fucks you up. It fucks you up good... Can I leave? I don't know what else you want me to tell you.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI ripped the catcher from his hands and charged them both. I ran into one and skewered him on the handle. I pried my head from the collar and made short work of the other. The audience left in a hurry. I ran.\n\nI was free.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Before Agent Sarah Crowely returned to duty, she applied for a position in the Site-45 therapy group, as Crowely has reported deteriorating mental health, including frequent alcohol consumption. Reassignment has been considered; however, she has remained effective in her position and has shown signs of improvement in regard to her mental health.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** scp-location3.jpg\n> **Name:** SE2237 : Olivers Paris Restaurant and Bar, Calverley Lane\n> **Author:** Rich Tea\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/642524 Geograph]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
