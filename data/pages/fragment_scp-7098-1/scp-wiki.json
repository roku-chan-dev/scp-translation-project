Please do not attempt to contact your local RAISA field office with questions or queries.    \n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7098 \n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Secure Facility Site-96 shall be monitored for SCP-7098 phenomenon and its effect. Due to the nature of the anomaly, Containment Procedures are still in development. Staff are encouraged not to write or research SCP-7098 as a precaution.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7098 is the designation for a currently isolated anomalous phenomenon affecting the research and record keeping staff at Site-96.\n\nSCP-7098's effects manifest as a memetic trigger that occurs whenever Foundation personnel, henceforth known as “subjects”, attempt to write about SCP-7098. Upon attempting to write about SCP-7098, subjects show significant decreases in cognitive writing ability. These decreases correspond with spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. \n\nSCP-7098 was discovered after multiple requests for a formal designation of the SCP-7098 effect were denied by Site-96 leadership. These designation rejections were due to immature writing style, formatting, lack of clinical tone, loss of objectivity, and issues with POV perspectives. Site leadership retracted their rejections once a clear and present pattern emerged.\n\n= **__Addenda__**\n\nOnce Researcher, Dr. Arthur Encert, submitted a precursor to this particular version of SCP-7098 protocols on 20/10/2022, the need for containment became evident. The subsequent process of determining the nature of SCP-7098 was decidedly difficult, given that most staff involved in the designation and conceptual phases of the Containment Procedures communicated solely through departmental email. It wasn’t until 22/10/2022 upon leaving the Site, multiple staff engaged in active, in-person conversation involving the SCP-7098 phenomenon.\n\nUpon consensus agreement of the phenomenon’s effects, the assigned team unanimously voted to use Dr. Encert’s original proposal as well as to include this current extant data as additional information in Addendum. RAISA Director, Maria Jones, was contacted via phone call of an incoming data entry that would appear as an unacceptable, non-standard-quality file. Dir. Jones reluctantly accepted the entry given the extenuating circumstances of the SCP-7098 phenomenon. \n\nAs of 31/10/2022 the effects of SCP-7098 have not been shown to spread from Site-96. However, it is to be noted that researchers and staff from other Sites who have viewed the SCP-7098 file have shown a marked decrease in work quality, though it is unclear if this decrease is SCP-7098 related.\n\n= ##red|[__[WARNING: RECURSIVE__]]##\n= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7098/offset/0 Exclusionary Site-Δ-2 (A Secure Site that concurrently exists outside nominal reality and, thusly, is unaffected by baseline memetic hazards) was given multiple logs of SCP-7098 related material and surmised the following file, however, the one submitted by Dr. Encert is, by gross and appropriate technicality, the most accurate.]",
