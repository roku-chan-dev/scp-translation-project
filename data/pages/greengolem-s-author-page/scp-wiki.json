Activity was too minimal for the UIU to detect during this period. However, during July of 2021, activity spiked. Suspect began doing shitty research projects, posting a large number of them. They even started going over to other GOIs in order to \"Get a feel for their environment\", and created documentation for them as well.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]\n\n**Name:** Hudson Bassett (Alias: GreenGolem)\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Shitposter\n\n**Capabilities:** Suspect is capable of making a large amount of very terrible posts in a short span. These usually range from unfunny jokes (i.e. puns), all the way to creating false conspiracies about large-scale threats.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown.\n\n**Modus Operandi:** Suspect gets online very night and forces himself to write thousands of words within an hour. After this is done, he goes to the IRC channels, and attempts to get a critter for 3 hours before giving up and coldposting the article.\n\n**Behavior:** Suspect is said to be incredibly dumb, but somehow still was able to get into the Foundation. Investigations ongoing.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Evidence]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-list= --]\n|language=en\n|order=rating desc\n|perpage=50\n|shadow=no\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthor-header= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-coauthored= --]\n|name=scp-6447\n|feat=A lot of people\n|language=en\n]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Bureau Record]]\n\n**Current Status:** At large.\n\n**Crimes:** An immense number of really really bad posts.\n\n**Sentencing:** Banishment back to the Ideas Critique Forums\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Achievements]]\n**Foreword:** Despite possessing literally zero talent whatsoever, Suspect holds a number of \"Achievements\" within the Foundation.

Each of these flyers detail the suspect's policy on \"Critiques\". It is unaware of whether such policy is present within the Foundation ranks.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAy, so you want me to critique your work? See the list below.\n\n||~ ##green|Likes## ||~ ##red|Dislikes## ||\n|| Comedy || Overly Gorey Articles ||\n|| Mystery || Drafts longer than they should be ||\n|| Antimemetics || Murder monsters ||\n|| Pictures and Color || Articles whose narrative doesn't match how good it looks ||\n\nDo you still want me to critique your work? Great! I'm always happy to critique a work. Please PM me on Wikidot or DM me on discord (Golem#1668).\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Suspect's Will]]\n**Foreword:** The suspect's will has been located. It is listed below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIf you think I'm dead, then think again! I will never die! If I am missing, I am simply on a hiatus. If I am on a hiatus for a minimum of 1 year (Not having made a single post or edit), then [[*user tstaffor]] will be able to do whatever he wishes with my articles until I return (In which case, it will go promptly back to me). If Tstaffor is unable to complete this duty (or doesn't wish to), then that responsibility goes to [[*user Fish^12]]. If Fish^12 is also unable to take up such a role (or doesn't wish to), then [[*user Zyn]] gets the responsibility. As for co-authored articles, the responsibility of keeping those articles are to be left to the other co-author(s) until I return.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Reviews]]\n**Foreword:** Suspect has a listing of reviews on his resume, readily available online.
