  "content": "**Name:** Dr. Charles Anborough\n\n**Security Clearance:** Level 4\n\n**Location:** Site-59\n\n**History:** Born ██/██/19██ in █████ ████, ██.  Former nuclear physicist at ███.  Recruited by the Foundation after one of his experiments accidentally transported himself and a portion of his laboratory to █████, France.  The anomalous event has not been reproduced.  Dr. Anborough is currently the director of Sites 59 & 117.\n\n**Profile:** Dr. Anborough is 1.8 meters tall and weighs 81 kg.  He is currently in stable health but is hindered by a gunshot wound in his right calf.  To date, Anborough has given 45 different explanations for this injury.  The angle of impact on the wound, however, suggests that [DATA EXPUNGED][[footnote]] I did NOT accidentally shoot myself in the leg; stop interfering with my file, Adler.[[/footnote]].  Due to this disability, Anborough utilizes a crutch, and has been known to occasionally poke his subordinates with said implement.  Anborough possesses a notable dry wit and will often insist that works by Igor Stravinsky be played in his presence.  Due to this, Site-59 is stocked with multiple versions of \"Petrushka\", \"The Rite of Spring\", and \"The Firebird Suite\".\n\n__SCP Articles Authored__:\n\n[[[SCP-1769]]]: **The Beloved**\n[[[SCP-1428]]]: **Jinwu**\n[[[SCP-1734]]]: **The Hole in the Deck**\n[[[SCP-1815]]]: **A Mercurial Doppelganger**\n[[[SCP-1847]]]: **The Rake**\n[[[SCP-1748]]]: **The Dragon's Legacy**\n[[[SCP-1824]]]: **A Mother's Son**\n[[[SCP-1838]]]: **Bob**\n[[[SCP-1518]]]: **The Bubble Fountain**\n[[[SCP-861]]]: **A Fallen Angel**[[footnote]] Collaborative work co-authored by Dexanote, originally posted by Far2, original author unknown.
