The mausoleum is to be checked for damage or deterioration once every 30 days. Any reality-restructuring effects of SCP-194 which appear to impact the space outside of it should be reported to containment staff. \n\nDue to the effects of SCP-194-Z upon the SCP-194 designation, the acting documentation of SCP-194-Z is presented in the form of various addenda to the acting SCP-194 designation. Any secondary classifications are to be assigned in reverse alphabetical order (i.e. SCP-194-Z), and all addenda are to be designated alphabetically, rather than numerically (i.e. Addendum 194.A). This is to prevent conflict with documentation applied to the SCP-194 designation.\n\nDespite changes to the SCP-194 designation, Addenda 194.A through 194.C describe the true nature of SCP-194-Z, and will remain unaltered regardless of other edits.\n\n**Addendum 194.C (Description):** SCP-194-Z refers to a phenomenon surrounding the SCP-194 designation. Various objects are assigned to the SCP-194 designation at various times, causing the SCP-194 file to be altered based on the affected object. Only one object can be assigned to the SCP-194 slot at any time, causing minor retroactive alterations to support the containment of each object in Foundation custody.\n\nNotably, most affected objects assigned to the SCP-194 designation are non-anomalous in nature.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 194.D: Inserted Data\" hide=\"close\"]]\nOn 04/23/2019, SCP-194 document underwent a period of accelerated flux, before returning to normal stabilization.

I know you think I don’t care, and that I don’t think about people, but I really, really do. And I care about you most of all. To prove it, am going to make something for you: a collage of all the amazing things about you, to show what a unique and amazing person you are!\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 194.E: SMS Text\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> It’s never going to happen, Garth. Take your crap and just leave me alone. Please.
