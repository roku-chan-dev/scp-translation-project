With this in mind, agents embedded within major internet service providers are to prevent the expansion of internet services until SCP-3178 is identified and contained.\n\nMobile Task Force Gamma-691 (\"When Something Interesting Happens\") is to be kept on standby in case of activity that may escalate SCP-3178's Object Class or Threat Level. Two officers are to remain within Whitewater in order to investigate SCP-3178.\n\nDue to the presence of a GoI-952 (\"Olney Ironworks\") manufacturing center within an hour's drive of Whitewater, the Foundation is looking into solutions to the issue of cross-contamination with SCP-3178.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3178 is a phenomenon, entity, or series of rituals responsible for several anomalous events within the village of Whitewater, Mississippi. The nature of SCP-3178 is unknown, including whether or not it constitutes a singular entity or force.\n\nThe populace of Whitewater is aware of SCP-3178, attributing it to the actions of the Christian Trinity. Confinement of SCP-3178's events' to members of the Whitewater Baptist Church (of which 71% of Whitewater's population belongs to) is cited as proof of this.\n\nIt is known that SCP-3178's influence was first recorded by the populace on 09/13/2001, following the inexplicable recovery of Pastor Redd Harding after two hours of clinical death as the result of an untreated coral snake bite. Since then, multiple anomalous events have been recorded, including:\n* A \"prophetic vision\" depicting the exact location of Calvin Harding, then missing.\n* The spontaneous pregnancy of Ms. Maisie Hill immediately following a confirmed miscarriage.\n* The occurrence of snowfall during the funeral of Deacon William Barnes, despite the date (July 7th).\n* The impromptu recitation of Luke 23 and subsequent spontaneous combustion of Mr. John O'Connolly, during his court appearance for kidnapping and battery.\n------\n= [[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]\n\nSCP-3178 was discovered following post-incident investigation of [[[SCP-5952|Incident-5952-C-Ford]]]. The nature of Researcher Ford's injuries, as well as interviews with witnesses, suggested the existence of a separate anomalous force or entity related to the SCP-5952 project. However, further investigation revealed no apparent links between SCP-5952 and SCP-3178, aside from the involvement of Joseph Comstock Rockwell, a Whitewater-based Baptist preacher working as faculty in WWSCSTT.\n\nElder Rockwell rebuffed initial requests for an interview, citing both his schedule and the Foundation's alleged conduct during Incident-5952-B Schumer-Velasquez-Ford. Furthermore, persons of interest to the SCP-5952 project either refuse to cooperate or lack significant knowledge of the SCP-3178 phenomenon.\n\nOn 05/13/2010, Foundation Overwatch ordered investigation into SCP-3178 and its connection to Whitewater. Officers Efrain Rodríguez and Connor Zhou were deployed in response.\n------\n= [[size 150%]]**ADDENDUM-3178-003**[[/size]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ GAMMA-691 LOGS\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Wednesday, May 13th, 2010}}\n\nOfficer Zhou and I entered Whitewater from the South, through one of the two roads in and out of the city. We went through a backroad, coming off the MS 26; I'm told the Northern road is a Thoroughfare.\n\nMy first impression wasn't positive, you could say. The locals weren't very friendly. This was to be expected, though, given the racial demographics of Whitewater and its home county.\n\nStill, there was one or two friendly faces. Marjorie, a charming old lady with bright red tortoiseshell glasses who apparently works as the town barber. Walter Barnet, a local schoolteacher who offered to show us around town. Elliot Ngo, an ironworker employed by night in the town of Starling, and one of the only non-white residents of the town.\n\nChief among the people who didn't like us, unfortunately, was Mrs. Judy Davis. She owns the Saltside Inn, the only motel in town and where Zhou and I will be staying during the investigation. It's clear she's annoyed that we're here for what, to the town, is essentially investigation into the workings of the --Judeo---Christian God, but I'm not sure she could afford to turn us away. This place doesn't look like it sees much commercial traffic.\n\nI'll keep you posted.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Thursday, May 14th, 2010}}\n\nLocals seem hesitant to interact. Not for lack of trying on our part: Zhou and I did the rounds, or as much as we could in a dry county. Assuming they're not just writing us off, a big problem is that there isn't a lot to //do// in Whitewater. If people want to do anything, they have to drive to Starling out West. Really, there aren't even //grocery stores//.\n\nIronically, the one person willing to talk to us was Mrs. Davis. She doesn't quite like us, but she stopped short of calling Whitewater a Sundown Town. I logged our interview, should be included with this week's report.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Friday, May 15th, 2010}}\n\nElder Rockwell came back to Whitewater.\n\nThe locals treat him like something of a celebrity: when he came into town, everything stopped and took attention. Locals practically mobbed him, showering him with praise and begging him for spiritual advice on a great many matters. Even the schoolhouse stopped class so student and faculty alike could gawk.\n\nWhen I saw him for myself, it wasn't hard to see why. Rockwell's the tallest man in town, built like a carpenter with the charisma of a con-man. Something about his voice just puts one at ease. It's easy to recognize he's a PoI, but you'd think it was for the Horizon Initiative, or something equally benign. Despite this, I have reason to believe that\n\n... there's no clinical way to say this: he's hiding something. Zhou and I made eye contact with him several times over the course of today; both of us came away with something similar.\n\nRockwell has a way of making you feel small. There's something indescribably imposing, how he looks at you. Like you're a sheep, and you're being hunted by a wolf. He's not necessarily the wolf in this case, but you get the feeling he could //save// you from the wolf. Keyword \"could\"; you see no intention of doing so.\n\nSuffice to say, he rebuffed all attempts at an interview.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Monday, May 18th, 2010}}\n\nElder Rockwell is something of a prophet to these people. Unlike most prophets, he has a schedule, spending most of the week at the nearby boarding school before coming back on Friday to fulfill his diocesan duties. He's gone by Monday.\n\nNeither Zhou or I were privy to any \"miracles\" performed by SCP-3178 during our stay; however, a few of the locals would accost him as he went about his duties, seemingly to interpret \"miracles\" they themselves experienced. We're still at the thin-ice stage of our relationship with Whitewater, so we tried to limit our espionage. It all seemed standard.\n\nAnd then it was Sunday.\n\nWhitewater isn't particularly active on a good day. Again, there's not much to do. But Sunday morning stood out to us as particularly still. Nobody went outside, not to tend a lawn or sweep their driveway or anything like that. The only thing open was the station just outside the limits.\n\nZhou interviewed the teller, or tried to. He's a heavyset, middle-aged latino from the town of Starling; that's as much as we could get out of him. Says he doesn't know much about Whitewater, only that he's heard the locals can get \"really weird\" about the Sabbath. We don't have the clearance to probe him about SCP-3178, so that's as much as can be gotten until we check in with Command.\n\nAltogether, we'd assumed it'd be a quiet day. We're here to investigate miracles, and the strangest thing we'd seen is a distinct lack of any activity, not even Sunday morning church commutes.\n\nAs we later learned, Whitewater's Sunday services begin in the evening.\n\nIf you haven't seen it, Whitewater Baptist Church hosts a single \"bell-tower\". The bell itself is small, and shouldn't have been able to reach much further than the campus. Theoretically, the bell's tolls cannot reach Saltside Inn, which sits at the other end of Whitewater, except that they did.\n\nI'm unsure if this was one of the \"miracles\" of SCP-3178, but at 8:17, Zhou and I heard a series of loud tolls of a bell. This wasn't the tinny buzz you'd expect from the actual bell, but strong, lingering, deep. The kind you'd expect from a cathedral. You can listen to the recording we included, Audio Log-3178-A.\n\nZhou and I rushed to the church to investigate, and sure enough the bell was ringing. By this point, the church lot and surrounding streets were packed with empty cars, and the lights in the chapel were on. Evidently, services had started. Having made little progress over the course of the week, the two of us endeavored to make our way inside and observe.\n\nExcept we couldn't.\n\nThere were two men stationed in front of the door to the chapel. Tall, dressed in khaki shorts and polo shirts, what looked to be darker complexions than most of the town; it was too dark to make out much more. They wouldn't speak, and they wouldn't move from in front of the chapel. I tried getting through regardless, and that's when the one to my right\n\n... I don't remember what happened. I know he did something to me, and I know that Zhou helped me in the aftermath, somehow. But there's a space between then and this morning where I can't remember anything, save a dream I had.\n\nIn case it becomes relevant, I'm including a transcription of the dream with the report.\n\nAs I'm writing this, it's half past noon. Zhou was gone when I woke up; I'll speak with him after I investigate the church campus for anomalies, and I'll keep you posted.\n\n\nGoing to be wearing a bodycam in case this happens again.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Monday, May 18th, 2010}}\n\nI will be taking the rest of the day off, along with tomorrow; I apologize for the inconvenience.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ INTERVIEW LOGS\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INTERVIEW-3178-F**\n----\n**DATE:** 5/14/2010\n\n**SUBJECT:** Judy Davis\n----\n{{[BEGIN LOG]}}\n\n//Interview begins in what appears to be the residence of Mrs. Davis.

The walls are lined with pipes and trilingual hazard signs, and crowding the various halls and rooms are vast arrays of industrial equipment. My only source of light is a handheld flashlight.\n\nI know, somehow, that I am trespassing. Moreover, something in the back of my mind insists that whatever I may be looking for, I won't find it within the maze. Something drives me to continue, some external force I have come to see as a yoke around my neck. The maze hates me for this.\n\nSomething is hunting me.\n\nThough I have no idea where my hunter lurks, I am somehow intimately aware of the fact that my hunter is gaining on me. What began as trespass quickly becomes a frenzied rush to escape my hunter; however, I have gone too far into the maze, and have lost track of the exit. Part of me believes that whatever holds my yoke is indifferent to my survival.\n\nAs I run deeper into the maze, I begin to occasionally notice windows on the walls, overlooking impossible, horrible visages:\n* A field of scorched earth, filled with ramshackle gallows from which pale, screaming bodies are hung over fires.\n* An impossibly long hallway, where a milk-white cloud pours itself into the IVs of sickly men packed frame-to-frame in dirtied sickbeds.\n* A fattened sack of flesh sitting under a weave of clay blades, fed blood from children thrown to the weave to thrash themselves into a pulp.\n\nSoon, I grow tired. I cannot escape my hunter.\n\nWhen finally I collapse to the rust-covered floor, my flashlight goes dark. My hunter comes closer; it knows //exactly// where I am.\n\nIt turns me over, and I can see it through the darkness.\n\nMy hunter is shaped like a human, but it has been mutilated into such a shape with stitches and zip ties and butcher twine. Its \"skin\" is a tangle of slimy tentacles, red in color, lined with hooked suckers that cut into it with every motion. It is wearing a leather apron. Around my hunter's \"waist\" is a belt, from which hang three clay heads. On its left hangs the face of a woman, missing her lips. On its right hangs the face of a bull, missing its horns. In the center hangs the face of a man, missing his eyes. Around its neck hangs a thick wire, threaded through an array of severed penises.\n\nOn its head, my hunter wears a rubber mask. The face is of a jovial, clean-shaven man, with a double chin and a grey combover. It is remarkably clean.\n\nAnd then I woke up.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n= [[size 150%]]**ADDENDUM-3178-004**[[/size]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ GAMMA-691 LOGS\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n{{Officer Efrain Rodríguez}}\n{{Wednesday, May 20th, 2010}}\n\nZhou and I were woken up around 3 AM to a loud banging sound from the door to our room.\n\nJutting from our doorpost was a massive nail, with a shaft easily two inches in diameter. With every pound, more of it poked through, until it was easily three feet out. Soon, the pounding stopped, only to resume once again as another nail emerged from the doorpost.\n\nI yelled at whatever was behind the door, but they ignored me, continuing to hammer nails through the doorpost. Then I tried opening the door to confront them, but something was pulling it shut from the other end.\n\nIt was then that Zhou pushed me out of the way, retrieving his firearm and ordering whatever was responsible to back away before he opened fire. That didn't deter whatever was outside, and neither did the warning fired into the ceiling. It was only when Zhou fired at the door that the pounding stopped, interrupted by the sound of a man screaming.\n\nZhou threw open the door, levelling his firearm at whatever was behind it, just in time for him to see a man dressed in black fleeing around the corner. The two of us gave chase, but by then he'd fled the motel. We hadn't brought flashlights or shoes, and the trail of blood he'd left was too small to track in the dark. The shot must have grazed him.\n\nZhou tried to contact Mrs. Davis, but apparently she'd gone on vacation on Monday and hadn't come back since. I put in a police report; hopefully, they can sort this out.\n\nOf note is what we found nailed to the doorpost.

The plan was that if all was clear, if nothing happened over fifteen seconds, he'd call out to me and we could continue. Our original plan was to go through the factory; however, a quick survey of the grounds revealed a cellar door leading down into what must have been a maintenance tunnel. Between that and getting caught on the Olney cameras, we decided the cellar would be our entry point.\n\nSo Zhou went in, and\n\nI don't know what I saw. One moment the door was there; the next, there was an exposed patch of concrete, not even a manhole to show for it. I searched the whole grounds, everything I could get to, I even looked at the street view (as much as I could on the spotty cell service). Not only couldn't I find an entrance, the grounds didn't match what I saw on the maps.

My eyes stung, my head pounded, and my whole body ached. I was fully dressed, and my bodycam lay crushed beside my bed. When I went to the mirror, I could see my face was burned, somehow, all reddened and blistered. My eyes were red, like I'd been crying too hard for too long.\n\nI hadn't written any reports for yesterday, or none that I could find. Knowing that yesterday was a Sunday, however, I'm certain that one of two things happened:\n* I travelled to Starling, or along the MS 26, to investigate the landscape.\n* I had stayed inside for most of the day.\n\nAssuming I wasn't messed with during such tasks, I suppose I might then have gone to the church grounds a little before the beginning of Mass, presumably to investigate the grounds or infiltrate the gathering. I know I would have tried to avoid the men from before, or at the very least have threatened them if they tried to interfere with my work. I'm not in prison, so I assume either the police don't care about what I might have done, or they were never called to begin with.\n\nBut what //did// this to me? Unless I'm not cleared for it, I can't find anything close to my experience in the records.\n\nOne more thing. I tried reciting my morning prayers. I'd been forgetting to do them in the past few years, but ever since the incident last week I've been better about it. Call it a crutch, but after what I've seen it felt good to ease the burden, if only a little, and rituals can be good for that.\n\nI felt nothing. I knew the words, I knew the motions.

Sounds like some kind of research society.\n\n**Rodríguez:** Of a sort. We're looking to disprove some rumors going around about Olney Starling. There's been some rumors, however outlandish, about it being frequented by some kind of space cult, and we we want to quash that before... well, small town America does what it does.\n\n//Mr. Ngo blinks, then relaxes his posture.//\n\n**Ngo:** I... might have heard tell of a little. Can't say I've //seen// a space cult.\n\n**Rodríguez:** Right, right. So... let's start off talking about squids. I've... heard tell that the facility has more than could be expected.\n\n**Ngo:** Can't say I've seen them. //(Mr. Ngo sips from his coffee)// Depending on the... the space cult's relationship with squids, it'd have made a lot more sense if the nonexistent cult had taken root in a fishery. Olney Starling is a steel mill. As for, say, //walking// squids... Olney has no financial incentive to create such a thing.\n\n**Ngo:** Moreover, if, say, the space cult was less of an Olney operation and more of a parasite, and for a bigger if, if crafting such a thing were possible, such an organization would have to be pretty well-funded to ensure any sort of cooperation from Olney. The company's been firing on all cylinders for a while, so leasable basement space would be pretty sparse.\n\n**Rodríguez:** Sounds reasonable. So, how much basement space //is// there?\n\n**Ngo:** That's... fairly complicated. While I can't give you an exact number, I can tell you right now that most of it is tunnels. Not a lot of space for blood rituals. And, moreover... I can't see a situation in which the space cult would need the tunnels.\n\n**Ngo:** //(italics denote a possible emphasis based on Mr. Ngo's tone)// //Despite some of the rumors//, Olney has no plans for long-range tunneling. Whitewater is an hour's drive, and we don't have the capital for a private railway. Simply put, the logistics of transport don't work.\n\n**Rodríguez:** That all makes sense. So... why, then, do you think rumors persist?\n\n**Ngo:** Dying in a thresher of your own fault doesn't make as good a story.\n\n**Rodríguez:** People have //died// in the tunnels?\n\n**Ngo:** Everyone wants to find a squid monster; considerably less want to respect private property and heed the warnings we've put out.\n\n{{[END LOG]}}\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ RECOVERED MATERIALS\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Designation:** I-3178-F\n**Date of Retrieval:** 5/20/2010\n**Description:** Item has been identified as a //Balaenoptera musculus//[[footnote]] Blue Whale [[/footnote]] penis.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Designation:** I-3178-G\n**Date of Retrieval:** 5/26/2010\n**Description:** Item consists of hair and body fat samples taken from Officer Efrain Rodríguez.

The town is larger than before, much larger: from the roof of my house, I can see the trappings of rural America stretching for miles in every direction.\n\nI am on my roof, because I must put up Christmas lights. All of Whitewater will be lit up for what's to come, whether or not the owner puts up their lights. In the back of my mind, I instinctually know that the Christmas lights are preferable to whatever the alternative method should be.\n\nNone of this should be new to me, but for some reason I struggle. The instructions are simple, easy to understand, but so narrow as to obscure the arcane technicalities that short the lights, fail to close the circuit, threaten to set my house aflame. Why me?\n\nMy neighbor, Marjorie, she lives in the same model of housing, uses the same materials, reads from the same instruction booklet. Her lights are beautiful. Mr. Barnet, my other neighbor, his lights are even grander, bulbs of green and red and violet and white spelling mantras I can't decipher. Across the street, Ngo's house shines like a beacon in the daylight.\n\nNightfall is my deadline to complete the lights; but whether or not I succeed, my house will be lit up by nightfall.\n\nMs. Hill, Connor, that pale woman I somehow know as \"Princess\", they all shared a house. It's behind mine. Their deadline was earlier than mine, and they failed to complete their lights. I shield my eyes whenever their house should come into view. Their house is lit up. I have no intention of learning how.\n\nAm I missing something? Some integral piece of the puzzle? Everyone makes this look easy, but my lights form a labyrinthian nest of ports and plugs and power. All I consult is vague, sparse, predicated on a seemingly elementary aspect of lighting that eludes me. To go fast is suicide; to go slow is unacceptable tardiness.\n\nThe sun drips down the sky, squeaking like whale blubber dragged across a butcher's board.\n\nIt's late afternoon, and I have no hope of completing the lighting in time. I am behind where I started: only suicide cables and broken bulbs remain. There was never any grounding. The instructions insult and belittle me for my ignorance.\n\nIt's sunset, and I make up my mind to kill myself, but the powers that be have shut off my electricity. The grass and pavement of my lawn has decayed to a slurry, sticky and soft, gently pulling me back as I struggle from its grip. Someone has stolen my kitchenware. The sprinklers I can't remember installing scream as they put out my fires.\n\nIt's nightfall. I cower on my roof as Whitewater surrounds my house. Elder Rockwell knocks on my door. Despite my failures, my house will be lit up by nightfall.\n\nAnd then I woke up.\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: UNVERIFIED ADDITION\n----\n+++ ASE.aic CANNOT VERIFY THE CREDENTIALS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSED ADDITION.

What faceless things flanked either side of him?\n\nI remember his sermon.\n\nHe called me up by name, introduced me to the congregation. Told them we'd be starting at the beginning. There were so many people in the pews. Actual, living people. People who listened to Rockwell regularly, who sought him for advice or miracles or whatever else that horrible man offers. Such a terrifying prospect.\n\nHe sent me to my seat, and began. He spoke of Adam and Eve, which I knew, of Cain and Abel and Seth, which I knew less. He hated Cain. He hated Abel. I don't know what he thought of Seth.\n\nCain and Abel, according to Rockwell, are born of the seed of what he called \"the Serpent\". Rockwell reserved a special hatred for the Serpent. He accused it of polluting humanity, the Basalt Children of Adam, with the Children of Clay. The Children of Clay steal the Children of Basalt's babies, cutting off the tips of their penises and baking their blood into bread. They torture the Children of Basalt's livestock to death, bleeding them slowly and cruelly, flooding the markets with cheap, diseased meat. The Children of Clay plunder the gold of the Children of Basalt through trickery and intimidation, keeping the vast majority for themselves and circulating barely enough for the Children of Basalt to get by. To Rockwell, they are less than rats.\n\nRockwell screamed in tongues, but he was no Charismatic charlatan. Every babble accompanied an idea, a vision: I saw the Clay hordes of Canaan strike cruelly at the husbands and children of a city called \"Kazenrud\"; I saw them lash the Messiah to the cross; I saw them emasculate God's Red Right Hand; I saw them sink a peaceful icon of Liberty; I saw them turn the Children of Basalts' simpleton slaves against their righteous masters; I saw them live through every attempt by Adam's descendants to extract righteous justice for their myriad crimes.\n\nThe congregation screamed for blood. Rockwell called forth an assistant, who wheeled to him a cage obscured by cloth. Brought onto the dais, the cloth was pulled back.\n\nSeven snakes writhed around in a glass tank. One by one, Rockwell, removed them from the tank; he took no precaution as he handled them, and showed no discomfort as the snakes bit into his flesh. He'd scream something in a language lost to time, and then he'd bite into them, devouring them whole.\n\nThe collection plate, more bowl than plate, was soon passed. Lined with wicked blades, the congregation bled themselves into it, sometimes a drop, sometimes a pint. When filled, the \"plate\" would be passed to one of the assistants, who would drink every last drop before passing it back down the pews.\n\nRockwell knew when you didn't donate.\n\nI can't remember how long it had been when Rockwell began to scream of the end times, of a \"calamity\" that would restore dominance to the Children of Basalt, descendants of Adam. His predictions were dire, of the fall of the Idolatrous Machine Cult, of the reinvigoration of the \"Madonna of Soronești\", of Clay blasphemies swallowed by the worms. He screamed of the suffering to be brought upon the unbelieving, to be served torment sevenfold that which they'd suffer in life. I've never seen such raucous cheering for the end of the world.\n\nThey took my God from me, and this is what they seek to replace it with. No more.\n\nI am awake, and I will set this rotten monument of horrors aflame.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG 3178-A**\n----\n{{[BEGIN LOG]}}\n\n//Footage appears to have been taken from Rodríguez's bodycam.//\n\n//Rodríguez stands in front of a church door, breathing heavily. He kicks at the door, but it does not budge; so he kicks again, and continues to kick at the door until he's interrupted.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** I'm afraid Sunday School's out for the night, and we don't hold remedial classes. Look, I have to leave in the morning for Whitewater's graduation ceremony, do you think you could save this for next week?\n\n//Rodríguez screams, dropping something to the ground as he retrieves his firearm and open fires into the lock. Bending down to pick up what looks to be several plastic canisters, Rodríguez kicks at the door again, throwing open the doors to the chapel.//\n\n//Unscrewing the cap of one of the canisters, Rodríguez stumbles into the church and begins spilling a clear fluid over the floor. Elder Rockwell whistles.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** You can cut the seed off the Serpent, but you can't cut the Serpent out the seed, I suppose. Was really hoping you were one of the good ones, Efrain.\n\n//Rodríguez apparently attempts to say something; however, it comes out indistinct. He moves further into the church.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** What'll you get out of this, Efrain? There's no peace of mind in burning a church. I'd have thought a cursory reading of European history would tell you that much. //(Elder Rockwell sighs)// I really did expect better of you.\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** Are you doing this for them? The Foundation? You think this is what they want? They're not the pagans you think they are, Efrain. Maybe the leaves of that tree, but the roots walk with God, whether they know it or not. This'll only hurt //you//, Efrain.\n\n//As Rodríguez makes his way further into the church, Elder Rockwell can be heard following.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** It's not like you can stop God's march. The church is a conduit, Efrain, not a heart. God lives in the heart of every real American, and doing what you're gonna do will only embolden God.\n\n//Elder Rockwell circles around into view of the camera. He reaches out to Rodríguez, but Rodríguez screams and splashes him with the clear fluid. Elder Rockwell blinks.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** You're not a killer, Efrain.\n\n**Rodríguez:** Shut up.\n\n//Rodríguez moves past Elder Rockwell.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** Maybe my flock took too much of the Serpent out of your head. Maybe they took your common sense along the way. Your decency, morality, right and wrong. I'm truly sorry, Efrain. Maybe there was too much of the Serpent after all.\n\n//Approaching the dias, Rodríguez begins splashing the fluid across the various furniture pieces on the dais. He stops only at the pulpit, where a book lays open. He cannot seem to bring himself to splash it.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** You're weak. We took the Judeo- out of your Christian, and I don't think the services took. Why can't you bear to burn that simple little book? Means nothing to an animal like you.\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** Go on. Do it. Burn it. Just a drop of coffee on the Book of Life.\n\n//Rodríguez hesitates.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** You know, we ain't even killed your first friend. He's alive. Gonna wish he wasn't, but he's alive. I'll take you to him if you burn that book. It's gonna catch either way, Ef-\n\n//Rodríguez screams, pulling out a lighter.//\n\n**Rodríguez:** One more word, I'm doing it, I'm killing you and your stupid, //fake// church, so go on, do it, do it, do it, //(voice raises to a mocking pitch)// \"do it, do it, do it, do it //do it//\"!\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** You really are an animal, Efrain. Where'd you come from, anyways? Down South? Across the sea? Test tube? You ever stop to notice that all your coworkers are dirt-skinned, and all middle management's hook-nosed?\n\n//Sobbing, Rodríguez puts his lighter away, only to douse both the book and Elder Rockwell with yet more fluid.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** Good doggie. Let's get you to the library, you've a lot more-\n\n//Rodríguez shrieks, retrieving the lighter, sparking a light, and dropping it to the floor. He runs out of the chapel, careful not to step into the flames; however, Rodríguez trips as soon as he crosses the threshold, screaming in apparent pain.//\n\n//When Rodríguez turns around, he sees Elder Rockwell, calmly walking down the aisle towards him. The flames seem to avoid him as he walks.//\n\n//Though Elder Rockwell does not appear to be shouting, his words can be heard clearly despite the distance.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** How anticlimactic. You'll make me do this myself, won't you? //(he sighs)// This changes nothing, you know. I'll move on to another town, have someone else take my place at the school. Whitewater is nothing, and neither is any other town dying to hear what I have to say. There's nothing you or a puny little gas fire can do to change that. \"No weapon formed against me shall prosper\", for divinity is at my side.\n\n//Standing at the precipice, Rockwell holds his arms outstretched and smiles.//\n\n**Elder Rockwell:** And through the right God, all the right things are possible.\n\n//Two massive tentacles emerge from either side of the church, wrapping around Rodríguez and dragging him back into the burning chapel. Rodríguez screams.//\n\n//Recording is stopped.//\n\n{{[END LOG]}}\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3177]]] | SCP-3178 | [[[SCP-3179]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/a-dove-in-a-chicken-pen | previous-title=A Dove In A Chicken Pen\n| next-url=/irregularity-proposal-2001-489 | next-title=Irregularity Proposal: 2001-489\n| hub-url=/christ-in-scarlet-hub | hub-title=Christ In Scarlet\n]]",
