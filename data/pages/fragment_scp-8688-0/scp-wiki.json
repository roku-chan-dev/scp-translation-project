We need to keep this here, otherwise we'll forget about it. Again. Don't worry about it.\n\nYou're also going to see email correspondence between Heather Garrison and I included in both versions of the document. These are, unfortunately, needed for containment. Something about context helping 'fix' it in our minds. And again, don't worry about it.\n\n-- Dr. Lillian Lillihammer, Chair of Memetics and Countermemetics, Site-43\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Site-43 SCiPNET Email? One (1) new message!\" hide=\"Welcome back, Heather\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Heather Garrison\n**From:** Lillian Lillihammer\n**Subject:** Fw:Re:Old AO Project You Started\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nHey Heather,\n\nI'm swamped with trying to undo the mess we made last week when we were trying to help M&C remember to lock the cognitohazard lab, so I can't handle this.\n\nBut it looks weird. I think there's some meme fuckery happening, and I only know a handful of people who can understand them as well as I can.\n\nPretty please will you look into this and just write a quick file on it?\n\nThaaaaanks,\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer, Chair of Memetics and Countermemetics\n\n------\n\n//Hi Dr. Lillihammer,//\n\n//I was going through some archives in I&T and found some documentation from your old workstation. We flipped through it, and realized that we had an unresolved AO just sitting around in our archive, that you never finished working on.//\n\n//After you stopped work on it, it seems like everybody just...forgot about it? It's been sitting there for years now, and my boss wants it gone ASAP, so could you help us out here? We keep trying to figure it out, but nobody seems able to stay with it that long.//\n\n//Regards,//\n//Richard Furrier, Digital Archivist, I&T//\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Lillian Lillihammer\n**From:** Heather Garrison\n**Subject:** Re:Fw:Re:Old AO Project You Started\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nHey Lillian,\n\nYou owe me. You can buy this week.\n\nI'll let you know what I find out.\n\nHeather Garrison, Researcher\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Heather Garrison\n**From:** Lillian Lillihammer\n**Subject:** Re:Re:Fw:Re:Old AO Project You Started\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nSo you want to go out with me? You're being so bold Heather, on professional SCiPnet too!\n\nHere's my old unfinished file that they found on it, hope it helps!\n\nDr. Lillian Lillihammer, Memetics Chair\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Item #:** AO-8688\n\n**Object Class:** Unknown\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** AO-8688 is in Site-43's I&T Isolation and Storage area, kept within containment chamber IT-8688.\n\n**Description:** AO-8688 is a set of anomalous objects consisting of a desktop computer, monitor, peripherals and assorted unknown components. AO-8688 has undetermined anomalous properties - the Foundation is, however, positive that containment should be continued. I'm sure it's important, I'll get to it once I can get Eileen off my ass.\n\n**Addendum:** Hey, this is Lillihammer -- I swear I'm going to get back to this eventually, so **NOBODY ELSE TOUCH IT**, okay?\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nReally Lillian? You thought that this might help me?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nI haven't looked at it in a while, alright? What does the file say?\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nYou still haven't looked at it? It explains why nobody else worked on this file, they're all too scared of you and your threatening addendum.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nI'll show you my threatening addendum.\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing this email correspondence, Researcher Garrison attempted to locate AO-8688, to begin further research. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 11/19/2018\n\n**NOTE:** Footage is from Foundation security cameras within Site-43's I&T AO containment archive, inside of Chamber IT-8688. Heather Garrison was the only researcher in attendance.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Heather Garrison enters the chamber, placing a pad and pen on the desk, as well as setting a tape recorder down. She presses \"record\".//\n\n**Heather Garrison:** This is Heather Garrison, taking care of Lilli's messes. I mean, examining AO-8688. AO-8688 appears to be some old computer covered in a thick layer of dust. I don't think the dust is anomalous.\n\n//Heather wipes her finger over the keyboard, and the monitor turns on. Current information suggests that AO-8688 has been plugged in to a power source for the entire span since last worked on by Dr. Lillihammer//\n\n**Heather Garrison:** It's still plugged in? Lillian, don't you know you should always power down your electronics? Now let's see--\n\n//Dr. Garrison looks at the monitor -- an unlock screen for a currently unidentified operating system is displayed. The image stutters, glitching and being replaced with a minor cognitohazard for 5 milliseconds. Heater winces, and looks away.//\n\n**Heather Garrison:** Well. That's definitely Lil's work -- I'd recognize it anywhere at this point. It feels like her.\n\n//Heather begins to write on the page. As she does, she dictates to the tape recorder as well.//\n\n**Heather Garrison:** I am now transcribing this with pen and paper, as I record it into a vocal recorder. I believe that I have been exposed to a minor cognitohazard designed to induce forgetfulness or lack of interest in this anomalous object.\n\nI believe that this is the result of Lillian's possessiveness, and not related to the anomaly. However, due to the fact that the anomalous effect may be more than just one of Lillihammer's creations, I am recording this across multiple media forms, in an attempt to avoid any antimemetic effects.\n\n//Heather puts down her pen and stops the recording. She releases a frustrated, but subdued yell of frustration.//\n\n**Heather Garrison:** Thanks Lils. Guess you have to help me out here.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**NOTE:** Dr. Garrison exited the containment chamber, and appeared to pause for a second. After a beat, she resumed walking, exhibiting only slight symptoms of disorientation. After Dr. Garrison examined her notepad, it is noted that she reacted in surprise and frustration based on the contents.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nOkay, in my defense - it's really funny. Like it's so rough and a complete hack job of a meme? I can't believe I made this.\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nI can't believe you work-roofied me, from something you did over two decades ago. Can you please fix this?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nHuh. Two decades?\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nYes Lillian, time unfortunately, marches ever onwards.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nI don't think that's right.\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\nLilli, it doesn't matter how many times you blow up the site, time is still passing.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"danke site\"]]\n[[>]]\nHmm. Doubtful.\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter Dr. Lillihammer was alerted to the existence of a cognitohazard limiting research into AO-8688, a countermeme was developed that negated the effect, allowing Dr. Garrison to continue research into the anomaly. After beginning research into the AO, Dr. Garrison moved for the object to be reclassified as a full SCP. Reclassification is pending.\n\n[[=]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8688/offset/-1| You are currently viewing an outdated version of this document. View current revision?]]]\n[[/=]]",
