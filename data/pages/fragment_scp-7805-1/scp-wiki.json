It is only known to be able to travel to realities within Dimension-Cluster-6193. While its travelling between dimensions alone does not cause any threat of a GC, it has been found to break boundaries between realities when passengers are in possession of any significant technology. As a result, boarding GCP-10 instances may only be done when it has been confirmed that one has no technology above level 2 on their person.[[/size]]\n-----\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-7805-1/gcpf.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**[[size 125%]] The GCP Force has determined that the anomaly known as GCP-10 should no longer be used by any personnel wearing any technology above level 2. Failure to adhere to this regulation will result in termination within 3 days of the offense. Due to the interaction between technology and GCP-10, no organisations tasked with researching this anomaly will be able to further their research in a substantial way. To mitigate the unfortunate effect this may have on containing any potential threat GCP-10 poses on any given reality, we have archived as many research documents on GCP-10 we can and have embedded this list into all research agencies' documentations on the anomaly.[[/size]]**\n[[size 110%]]{{NOTE: To avoid risking a GC or adjacent through data transference between realities, we have limited the available documents per reality to contain ones from realities within Dimension-Cluster-6193 (the only cluster currently documented to contain GCP-10), yet do not have a shared point in space with the host reality.}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n##blue|Searching archived articles containing tag: \"GCP-10\"...##\n##grey|5 results found (23.6 seconds):##\n\n* //##grey|Already viewed -##// Document Title: **SCP-7805** - Originating from the Secure Contain Protect Foundation located in Dimension-6193C ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/0 click to view])\n* Document Title: **CPF-148** - Originating from the Contain Protect Filter Society located in Dimension-6193AG ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/2 click to view])\n* Document Title: **SDT-62** - Originating from the Secure Detain Treat Corporation located in Dimension-6193EH ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/3 click to view])\n* Document Title: **805-SCP** - Originating from the Secure Contain Protect Foundation located in Dimension-6193JF ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/4 click to view])\n* Document Title: **The Everlasting Bus** - Originating from the Final Flame Alliance located in Dimension-6193ZB ([https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7805/offset/5 click to view])\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
