Please leave some criticism.\n\nI didn't get much critique before posting this. Please, please, please, tell me what you guys think.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n\n+ What is Memetic Inoculation?\nInoculation refers to preemptive measures against infection. By introducing another infectious agent, such as a vaccine containing a dead or weakened virus sample, the body is allowed to develop the appropriate defenses against the actual virus. \n\nOur Glossary of Terms defines memes as “basic units of culture, ideas or behaviours that can be transmitted to others through communication or imitation. In the context of the Foundation, memetic effects are a sub-class of cognitohazards and infohazards that deal with the transfer of information (...) and may have anomalous effects on anyone exposed to them,” while memetic inoculation is defined as \"a countermeme [that] protects against or reverses the effects of an anomalous meme.\"\n\nIn other words, memetic inoculation centers around preventing the flow of anomalously harmful ideas. This introductory guide, written for those with limited experience in the field, will describe how memetic inoculation works and various methods of implementing it.\n\n+ How Does Memetic Inoculation Work?\nWhen entering a political discussion, you might notice that both sides often talk past each other without changing their minds. They enter and leave with the same opinions because these ideas are not merely opinions but reflections of how their brains have developed; reaching a new conclusion is impossible because doing so would require altering their logical frameworks, built on years of life experience.\n\nInoculation methods against memetic hazards work similarly by creating a temporary pretense, assumption, or belief in the brain, providing specific bias that counteracts typical realizations or conceptualizations. For example, if the appropriate inoculation phrase were \"you have nothing to lose but your chains,\" a subconscious pretense arises in the thinker that hinders the conceptualizations and realizations the relevant memetic hazard relies on.\n\nThere is no universal inoculation method just as no experience can universally cement, create, or prevent any opinion.\n\nSaying \"this memetic will not kill me\" is as effective as saying \"I won't start blinking manually when it is mentioned to me\" because that phrase likely doesn't protect the targeted areas of your brain. Inoculation phrases integrated into memetic security measures are typically designed alongside their relevant hazards, as it’s much easier to create a matching pair of meme and countermeme targeting the same areas than to retroactively develop a countermeme for a hazard you don't fully understand. For instance, if we fully understood the regions of thought affected by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-571 SCP-571], a countermeme would likely be developed within a year.\n\n+ Inoculation Methods\nNow that we understand the basics of memetic inoculation, we can explore the various methods used to implement them.\n\nWhile phrases have been the primary inoculation method we have discussed thus far, several others exist. The most effective meme-countermeme pairs are of a uniform type. Nonetheless, images linked to inoculation phrases are the most common, which often function like a security pass. Below is a short list of other commonly used methods you might encounter.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/introduction-to-memetic-inoculation/Dry_Tree_B%26W.jpg\n|caption=A dry tree, showing its fractal resemblance.\n|width=37.5%\n|align= right]]\n\n* Phrases\n* Five senses\n * Visual\n * Auditory\n * Tactile\n * Olfactory\n * Gustatory\n* Counterinfo\n* Cross-Memetic Interference\n\nAll of these methods benefit from providing an encapsulating, intriguing feeling. A three-dimensional fractal render, for instance, is more likely to attract attention and lead you to examine it further. It engages the pattern-sensing areas of your brain, and due to a fractal's often natural appearance, it also stimulates the emotional regulation and reward mechanisms triggered by nature. The intricate details and beauty similarly appeal to your primal, instinctual brain.\n\n++ Visual Inoculants\nAn image speaks a thousand words, making an image a great tool for inoculation. Though it varies individually, an image can carry an idea better than any phrase. For example, one person may prefer geometry due to being a visual learner while another may prefer algebra due to being a verbal learner. The same can be applied to visual inoculants.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/introduction-to-memetic-inoculation/The_Abstract_Face_in_pink_by_Gela_Mikava.jpg\n|caption=The Abstract Face in Pink by Gela Mikava, remaining identifiable as a face despite abstraction.\n|width=37.5%\n|align= right]]\n\nFractals are the most common base-image[[footnote]]A \"base\" medium refers to the non-anomalous media on which a memetic is designed. The non-anomalous and manufactured neurological responses should be aligned as close as possible for greater effect.[[/footnote]] for any manufactured memetic for their ability to captivate the mind, as explained above. However, regardless of effectiveness, any image can be converted into a memetic carrier.\n\nVisual memetics can avoid the loss of their properties through various means, as opposed to many of the other methods, simply because of the medium they are in. For example, a face can remain identifiable across different styles, resolutions, transformations, etc., while a voice can become much more difficult to recognise with a change in pitch.\n\nMost visual memetic hazards can only be safely viewed without inoculation when there are significant changes in color or brightness, as lower contrast between details makes them harder to make out. The same is true for visual inoculants. \n\n++ Auditory Inoculants\nWith audio, brevity is key. Manufactured audio memetics are so rare because they rely on complex timings, frequencies, and a little more focus than other methods. For instance, if I had two minutes of inoculation audio to listen to, my focus on something else could hinder proper inoculation.  Additionally, speaker quality can hinder it in the same way. Visual memetics are much more resilient to poor-quality technology than auditory memetics, as speaker issues could easily cause interference, shifts in frequency, and detrimental changes in timing and pace, among other issues. Refer to the section for visual inoculants for an example.\n\n++ Tactile Inoculants\nTouch conveys more information than we often realize. For instance, the resting heat of a metal can tell you what type of metal it is, with practice. Coarse hands tell you that someone has a physically demanding job. Smooth yet splintered wood with chipped paint tells you it's been well worn. However, I'm sure you understand that conveying any substantial information this way can be challenging. Memetics can be just as hard to communicate. \n\nThese are typically made of metal because it is a precise, workable, durable material. Replacement or re-texturing of these is usually done bi-annually. Washing and maintaining them is crucial for effectiveness.\n\nThese are usually reserved for high-security purposes utilizing precise neurological targeting, as tactile inoculation is much better with activating single parts of the brain rather than large sections. Users must always keep the inoculant on their person to avoid theft or loss.\n\n++ Olfactory Inoculants\nSmell can convey information. You can \"smell\" when something becomes hot or when the air is cold, recognize the smell of a loved one, or smell the weather; is it raining? Misty? Dry?  Inoculants can be transferred similarly, though olfactory methods are rarely used.\n\n++ Gustatory Inoculants\nThere is an edible, temporary vaccine for a few memetics. Yet, it’s made of nothing special—sugar pills, no placebo. How does it work? Gustatory inoculants. Gustatory—or taste-based—inoculants have limited application, are often single-use, and are somewhat impractical. However, they have faced more testing than any olfactory methods and are still currently in use by certain, undisclosed facilities as an entry pass.\n\n++ Counterinfo\nAs we’ve covered, memetics are a sub-class of infohazards. Separate from phrases, counterinfo can weaken or entirely negate an information/idea-focused memetic. For example, if I told you the moon is green, your preconceived counterinfo regarding the moon’s actual color negates the idea.\n\nYou have lived your entire life with a non-green moon. Without thinking, you refuse the notion of a green moon. Additionally, it would take a long time to undo this knowledge. As such, counterinfo can be very effective with repetition and long-term implementation. However, without this type of preparation, use may require the conscious consideration of the counterinfo.\n\nWhen utilizing counterinfo, be aware of any infohazards against it. This may sound obvious, but information can easily be falsified and weaponized to directly oppose counterinfo. For example, if I showed you a fabricated image of a green moon, you might question yourself for a moment.\n\n++ Cross-memetic Interference\nConflicting memetics can negate their individual effects through simultaneous exposure. For example, having two witnesses providing contradictory information can make you question the whole. Testing has revealed that a third memetic effect can result from combining two others, though only a tiny handful of memetics with this trait have been found in the field.\n\n+ Conclusion\nI hope this guide has fulfilled its purpose as a basic introduction to memetic inoculation. However, as your academic supervisor will show you, this is just the tip of the iceberg.
