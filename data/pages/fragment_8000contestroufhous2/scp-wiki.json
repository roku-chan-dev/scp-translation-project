Should all other countermeasures fail, personnel are to intervene in order to protect the anomaly.\n\nSCP-8090 is to be held in its location of origin. Personnel are not allowed to enter without express permission from at least one member of major faculty. Junior researchers entering through it are to wear protective hazmat suits for the duration of their stay inside SCP-8090-A. These suits are to be destroyed afterward.\n\nA list of safety procedures can be [# found here] for operations concerning SCP-8090-A and/or SCP-8090-1. Personnel are to observe these protocols thoroughly prior to performing any work within SCP-8090-A.\n\nOperations made inside SCP-8090-A are to be supervised by at least one member of major faculty. Personnel are prohibited from disturbing any of the superorganisms within SCP-8090-A. Personnel are instructed to immediately leave the dimension upon noticing an SCP-8090-Ψ emergence event.\n\nInterviews are ongoing to uncover more about SCP-8090-A. Subjects of interest include POI-8090-1, SCP-3580, and SCP-8090-Ω. These interrogations are to be handled by Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper.\n\nFor concerns pertaining to the ongoing cooperation from the entity, as well as those related to safety and the severe lack of information regarding the inner workings of the anomalies the Foundation is currently facing, Mobile Task Force or other Foundation personnel are not to attempt engaging SCP-8090-Ω at any time.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n----\n= [[size 125%]]**Description:**[[/size]]\n----\nSCP-8090 denotes two arched pillars, 7.8 meters in total width and 14.2 meters in height, located within the center of SCP-8090(I). The structure is comprised of severely weathered ivory and is coated in flames reaching across either column, in addition to a series of thaumaturgic and non-anomalous carvings. These sigils are believed to be solely responsible for maintaining SCP-8090's anomaly.\n\nSCP-8090's primary anomaly is situated at its back end, taking on the appearance of a perpetually shifting vortex composed of gold and light blue colored lights and mid-air thaumic symbols. When any form of matter is placed within the effective range of the anomaly, it will disappear from baseline reality entirely. This material will then be transported to a miniature alternate dimension, designated SCP-8090-A.\n\nSCP-8090-A is an interior system spanning an unknown but vast distance from SCP-8090 in all directions. Nearly every surface inside SCP-8090-A is constructed from rotting flesh or decaying bone structures. The only exception to this is an ivory pathway, 4.6 meters in width, that connects SCP-8090 to multiple sections of SCP-8090-A. Notably, the main section of this area maintains an ambient source of illumination from a collection of small black dots lining the ceiling, which will periodically gyrate in place.\n\nThe terrain of SCP-8090-A is chaotic and constantly writhing. Levels will shift on an hourly basis. Occasionally, structures will emerge from it and will take on appearances similar to limbs, pillars, animalistic heads, or humanoid heads, as well as a wide variety of other unknown parts from flora and fauna.\n\nAdditionally, multiple living entities have been observed within SCP-8090-A. These creatures (SCP-8090-A1) feature inconsistent anatomical designs; no two same instances have been identified thus far. However, they uniformly experience an extreme aversion to making contact with the ground of SCP-8090-A. They generally keep to the air or make nests within pillars. SCP-8090-A1 instances, after emergence from SCP-8090-A's terrain, will usually last for no longer than twenty-four hours before succumbing to exhaustion and making contact with the ground, practically, though not completely terminating them.\n\nSCP-8090-1 is the collective designation for an unknown number of viral diseases discovered within SCP-8090-A. From early estimates, it is believed that there are far more than 10,000 different viruses inhabiting the area. These diseases are excessively lethal and highly contagious. Any entity that makes contact with the terrain of SCP-8090-A, or other elements from the outside hazardous space, will contract multiple of these and are expected to perish shortly after.\n\nSCP-8090-Ω is a human entity discovered within SCP-8090-A //[See Addendum 8090.10 for more information]//.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Associated Passage:**\n> Let no one ever enter here again.\n> Let the souls of old find peace.\n> Let the age of yore be.\n> Let the accursed memories die.\n> Let this monument serve as our final sepulcher.\n> For ever and afterward.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n= [[size 150%]]__**Addenda: 8090.6/Initial Interactions**__[[/size]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 125%]]**Operation Transcript**[[/size]]\n----\n**Foreward:** Footage takes place two hours following SCP-8090's discovery after basic safety precautions were affirmed, utilizing the same team as before.\n----\n**18:58:** //The operatives, all suited up and ready, wait on COMMAND to give them to go-ahead for the mission. Senior Researchers all dotted around SCP-8090(I)-A analyze the surroundings of the room with keen interest.//\n\n**Agt. Smithson:** Look at them all.\n\n**Agt. Duke:** What's wrong?\n\n**Agt. Smithson:** While we're about to jump into God knows where they're all lounging around charting even more notes about the same shit.\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Heh. You're just mad that you're not smart enough to work with them.\n\n**Agt. Smithson:** Sure. Which sounds cleverer to you: sitting on your arse, kicking up your feet, and spending all day doing nothing of value inside your head, or making the split-second decision that'd decide your brother's fate?\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** The first option.\n\n**18:59:** //Smithson sighs as he lays back.//\n\n**Agt. Smithson:** Figures.\n\n**19:00:** //The operatives receive confirmation from COMMAND. They stand and walk over to the anomaly, entering through the portal after being waved clear by the attending senior researchers.//\n\n**19:01:** //The agents each step through and promptly disappear from baseline. Researchers attempt to tune into the operatives' body camera signals.//\n\n**19:01:** //Connecting briefly, the footage COMMAND receives is distorted and cuts out.//\n\n**COMMAND:** Captain? Captain, are you there?\n\n**19:02:** //Woodlock's voice comes over the communicator.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Roger, over.\n\n**19:02:** //Cameras come to life, viewing the exterior all around the team of a sprawling cavern-like complex stretching well beyond the horizon. White stone pillars are placed scarcely around, many of them breaking off into dozens of splintered branches at their middle marks, creating an appearance similar to a plethora of trees. These structures branch off chaotically further up until they connect with the roof of the space, which itself appears to be melting and sloughing off, dripping down with large chunks of meat and droplets of a green sludge that corrodes the ground below on contact.//\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bb/Tulipa_pestle_surface_-_SEM%2C_colorized.tiff/lossy-page1-800px-Tulipa_pestle_surface_-_SEM%2C_colorized.tiff.jpg?20190531170459|align=center|width=95%|caption={{Fig 2.2}} Attached file.]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**19:02:** //Taking a step forward, the agents turn to look at the pathway they are standing on, which extends out beyond the range of the camera deeper into the complex. On either end of the platform, there are high-faring flames that sear whatever material is dropped or forced toward them. They arch above the path, acting as a ceiling that incinerates all of the flesh dropped from above instantly.//\n\n**19:03:** //Operatives take to the sides of the structure, peering down through the fires at the terrain that crackles and disjoints continuously, wriggling and writhing as incalculable amounts of flesh shift. The liquid from above can be seen collecting here in pools that puff with steam and smoke as they expand outward. Behind the agents, a similar structure as SCP-8090 can be seen, this one in near pristine condition. Behind its portal, however, there is nothing but an open expanse of the same terrain stretching out for kilometers.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Command, you guys getting all this?\n\n**COMMAND:** Roger, that's a positive on the visuals.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Don't think it'll be possible to get any samples at the moment.\n\n**COMMAND:** No need. You're clear to proceed with the exploration.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Roger. Over and out.\n\n**19:05:** //Woodlock moves to the front of the group, craning his neck in a signaling motion as he turns to lead. The operatives follow, and they all walk along the path through the anomaly.//\n\n**19:08:** //As they travel, operatives can overhear a faint gusting sound that moves through the branches of the pillar structures and causes them to rattle, adding additional noises to the cacophony that echoes through the complex. It only grows in intensity as time passes, soon becoming all-encompassing.//\n\n**19:11:** //After some more time, the noise slowly quiets down to its original volume and later fades, leaving behind the dead silence of the crackling flames occasionally disturbed by the sounds of squelching meat below and burning tendons above.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Where the hell are we?\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Somewhere God blinked.\n\n**19:24:** //Agents look out. Through the inferno, they can observe a group of entities gliding through the air, making frantic efforts to evade each of the falling droplets of caustic liquid or lumps of flesh. The camera watches as one of the creatures is struck by a piece of debris, and its wing instantly corrodes. It drops to the ground, where it screeches as it violently thrashes. Its body quickly assimilates into the rest of the terrain. At no point during this process, or afterward from the camera's perspective, did the specimen appear to functionally die.//\n\n**19:30:** //The camera zooms in as Agent Duke takes to the side, focusing on a small perch on one of the pillar structures where a multitude of creatures similar to those previously spotted can be seen nesting. They huddle close together. A series of meaty strands can be seen climbing up the pillar.//\n\n**19:35:** //Taking another peak outward, Duke spots an entity perched on a lower alcove within a differing structure, only a few meters aboveground. The camera focuses on it, observing it to be in an advanced state of decay. Much of its hide has been stripped off, revealing its bones and now external organs. It lays there, shaking.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Lord almighty.\n\n**19:41:** //Up ahead, the sight of a large hanging formation comes into view, the pathway bending to reach around it. Further details are obscured by the distance.//\n\n**19:43:** //Getting closer, agents can view as the structure appears to jerk itself. A mild tremor is felt. Distant, echoing roaring is heard. The wind from before returns and quickly fades.//\n\n**19:45:** //Approaching the intersection, the agents are disturbed when the platform starts to shakes. Below them, the sounds of breaking bones and wet flesh tearing are heard as the terrain frenziedly shakes.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** What on- Hold onto something!\n\n**19:46:** //The flames around the path grow higher, intermittently completely blocking visuals of the exterior. From what can be seen, the ground parts in two separate sections on either side as the noises intensify.//\n\n**19:46:** //The fires continue to rise, then separate on both ends, revealing two large chasms that make way for the figures beneath.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Hold your positions! Hold!\n\n**19:47:** //On the left side, a massive form emerges from the flesh, covered completely in a pristine red-blue metal intricately patterned with scales. It rises up as a singular body before its head raises from behind itself, revealing a pair of slit eyes and its bottom jaw as the only uncovered sections of the great serpentine creature.//\n\n**19:48:** //On the right side, another form can be seen breaking through the terrain with apparent difficulty. It raises itself high into the air, making its heavily cracked, rusted, and ruined armor visible on its underside. It then arches, staring down at the agents several dozen meters above them. Its head is scarred; there is a long gash on its exposed face stretching from the side of its mouth to above its right eye, which is clouded. Its other eye, meanwhile, appears to study the agents.//\n\n**19:49:** //The two serpents maintain their positions staring down at the agents as the flesh below crumbles and crashes to fill the hole made by the emergence. The armored instance can be heard making a repeated chirping sound while the other lets out a low droning grumble. The diseased instance's jaw hangs low, the ligaments keeping it there having withered extensively with tears.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Nobody move.\n\n**19:49:** //The armored instance droops low, its meter-wide eye level with the operatives as they examine one another. The agents all maintain their positions, each of them clinging to their rifles. The diseased entity starts to do the same but holds itself above the roof of the path. The sounds of sizzling are heard, and it lets out a hoarse growl.//\n\n**19:50:** //The armored instance puffs once, then rises and retracts itself back into the flesh, taking twenty seconds to do so. The diseased serpent stays outside, meanwhile, as the flames close once again, obscuring it from view as they retain their increased height.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Command?\n\n**COMMAND:** It seems like you're clear to continue.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** I don't think that's a good idea. Ugly one's still there. We aren't prepped for if things go wrong over here.\n\n**COMMAND:** You have Krow's instant evac if that happens. Please proceed with the mission.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Command, I don't-\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** You heard them, //Captain//.\n\n**19:52:** //Woodlock flinches.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Yes sir.\n\n**19:53:** //The operatives continue forward. The serpent watches as they leave.//\n\n**19:58:** //The hanging formation comes into the camera's view now. Above, the ceiling extends roughly two hundred meters, forming an upward circular pit where the massive sac can be seen connected to the roof by a collection of thin and thick strands. The structure possesses a number of blemishes and swollen areas, and a river of the caustic fluid seen previously spews from a spout near the top of it, all of the liquid seeping and dropping off of it and into a comparably sized abyss below it.//\n\n**19:59:** //The pathway bends to encircle this chasm and ends directly after it. Agents approach the wall of flames and try to peer out into the pit below. Agent Cowrite ties his camera to the barrel of his gun and pushes it through the flames. Woodlock tries to stop him, but Cowrite succeeds. The camera looks down into the pit. The darkness of its depth conceals the bottom. Pulling the camera back in, the gun barrel begins to glow.//\n\n**20:02:** //Tremors begin again. Agents take up positions all around the circular platform looking outward. Cracking is heard from below, and the form of the diseased instance raises itself and coils around the pit, its head at the top center just below the hanging sac. It remains there, its eyes tracking and darting between the operatives.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Orders, Captain?\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Do not disturb it. Whatever you do, do not piss it off.\n\n**20:09:** //The team explores through the rest of the ring, approximately one kilometer in diameter, the serpent watching all the while.//\n\n**20:10:** //A mild trembling is felt. The agents look up to see the sac faintly undulating. The serpent looks to the back of the ring, then hurriedly retreats into the flesh, taking ten seconds to do so.//\n\n**20:11:** //The tremors grow. The operatives start their way to the back. In the distance, a loud, echoing bellowing can be heard. The sound continues for fifty seconds before it slowly fades down into the gusting sound heard previously.//\n\n**20:11:** //The agents all turn as the undulating sac begins rapidly spasming. It shakes for several seconds before it stops. It convulses once, sharply. The entire system of SCP-8090-A shakes.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Command, we should leave now.\n\n**COMMAND:** Negative. Please try to observe the phenomenon.\n\n**20:11:** //The tremors slowly fade. In the distance, another animalistic sound is heard, this time much louder than before.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Sir?\n\n**20:11:** //Roufhous looks at Captain Woodlock.//\n\n**Agt. Smithson:** //Sir?//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Fuck. Come on.\n\n**20:14:** //They continue to the back of the ring. There, they look out from the wall of fire, which has died down enough to allow them to see the outside. Far away, peaking out from the terrain along the horizon, a mountainous figure can be seen reaching upward.//\n\n**20:15:** //The camera is unable to make out more of the shape as it slowly extends to roughly half of the complex's height. It moves as four proportionately large forms erupt from it and stretch out, creating quakes with each movement. After sixty-two seconds, it appears to turn towards the team as its wings expand to their full several hundred-meter length.//\n\n**20:16:** //The creature opens its mouth and throws its head back, letting out an incredible roar that shakes the pillar structures all around and causes further tremoring as it begins charging forward.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Evac now! Move it!\n\n**20:16:** //The operatives all turn and start making their way back towards the front of the ring.//\n\n**20:19:** //The tremors intensify. In the distance, the faint sound of immense tearing of wet flesh can be heard.//\n\n**20:23:** //The agents make it to the start of the ring and head back onto the track. Another roar is heard. The ground shakes again as the flesh rapidly parts to make way on either end of the path.//\n\n**20:24:** //The serpents emerge, breaking through the terrain at great speed before launching into the air above the agents. Operatives are able to make out the entities' extraordinary length as they leap across the path and the entirety of the ring section in a single bound over the course of a minute.//\n\n**20:26:** //The operatives continue back along the path. Various sounds can be heard behind them, decreasing in volume only slightly as they get further and further away.//\n\n**20:29:** //A flash of light is seen from one of the white stone structures, and a golden streak passes through the air.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** What was that?\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Keep moving.\n\n**20:30:** //Repeated flashes of the same light are seen behind the ring. The agents continue.//\n\n**20:36:** //Now sufficiently far enough away, the operatives slow down to catch their breaths. Far behind them, the noises, still there, continue to echo through the complex. They soon move on.//\n\n**20:42:** //Agt. Cowrite moves to the side of the path, looking out to the terrain below. He keeps to this wall for some time as they walk before he stops.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Captain, look!\n\n**20:42:** //The team crowds around Cowrite. Outside, there is a skinless humanoid figure that emerges from the flesh. It walks up a series of steps and reaches out towards Cowrite. Though missing a face and multiple teeth, the entity is visibly, seemingly confused and afraid. Its hand touches the wall and it begins to burn, the fire then spreading up its arm to its entire body before it swiftly incinerates, screeching all the while. Its ashes fall back into the pile of meat below.//\n\n**Agt. Duke:** Jesus Christ.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** He ain't here. Let's go.\n\n**20:53:** //Agents make it the rest of the way to SCP-8090 and begin passing through it.//\n\n**20:54:** //Cowrite takes one last look out at the anarchic landscape around the path before stepping through. Woodlock joins him a second later.//\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[OPEN MEETING TRANSCRIPT 1]\" hide=\"[CLOSE MEETING TRANSCRIPT 1]\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++* Internal log - Meeting 1\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n**In attendance:**\n* O5-3\n* Director Pendant Roufhous - Project Labyrinth Director\n* Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper - Project Labyrinth Historian\n* Senior Researcher Helius Krow - Anthropologist\n* Nu-7 Captain Mortimer Woodlock - Chief of Security\n----\n= //All personnel are seated at a round table.

He's the only one who had access to the gateway?\n\n**Pepper:** As far as we know, yes.\n\n**Krow:** Thus far, we've had an atrocious time trying to read him.\n\n**O5-3:** Then we'll have to up the ante and force a confession out of him.\n\n**Krow:** His hide is thicker than his containment cell's walls. That may be difficult.\n\n**O5-3:** Everyone has a weakness. If you can't find it in his body, then look outside of it.\n\n**Pepper:** You don't mean...\n\n**O5-3:** An entire new world has been opened to us. One I'd argue is uglier than Hell itself. We need to know what we're dealing with here before we can send more people in.\n\n**Woodlock:** How many more people need to go in there?\n\n**O5-3:** As many as is needed, Woodlock, until the job is done.\n\n**Krow:** I believe we should begin with sampling trials. Perhaps some remote exploration. That pit at the end of the anomaly intrigues me, and there are many other things therein that we should learn more about.\n\n**O5-3:** Then we each have our roles for that better tomorrow. See to it that it all gets done, //Director//.\n\n= //They grumble. The Overseer sighs.//\n\n**O5-3:** Anything else, then? No? Get to work, everyone.\n[[/<]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nThe first exploration log footage showcased Agent Cowrite managing to push his inorganic rifle through the flame wall along the path to get a better view of the outside. Analysis of that gun showed that all of the bacteria had been incinerated while leaving the metal material unharmed. Additionally, this had an interesting secondary effect of leaving the gun entirely devoid of new bacteria for a seventy-six-hour period.\n\nBecause of this, a series of experiments were performed involving the employment of inorganic instruments to interact with the terrain of SCP-8090-A, conducted by Senior Researcher Krow. A working station had been set up a short distance from SCP-8090 inside, where researchers were able to transport samples of the material and begin work on the substances there.\n\nKrow has also authorized the employment of a prototypical drone surveyor unit for the purpose of delving further into SCP-8090-A. The device will be delivered, following extensive transferral safety protocols, to the Outpost-8090 facilities and be utilized on 30/3/1979.  \n[[/div]]\n-----\n= [[size 150%]]__**Addenda: 8090.7/Initial Investigations**__[[/size]]\n-----\nFollowing the interview prior, POI-8090-1 was given twenty-five hours before another was conducted.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[OPEN FILE]\" hide=\"[CLOSE FILE]\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++* Internal log - Interview: POI-8090-1/004\n[[/=]]\n----\n//POI-8090-1 is seated.

Why?\n\n//It chuckles.//\n\n**POI-8090-1:** The better question here is why I should help you with any of this.\n\n**Pepper:** I have put my offer on the table.

It wasn't any form of government or any sort of //unnatural// organization, such as yourself, that put it there. It was my young protege, Sigismund, defecting from my wise counsel to start his empire somewhere off in the East. He is a cunning sorcerer and a cruel man.

The test had been set up to observe and analyze the viruses therein to gain a better understanding of the possible dangers the anomaly may pose. Beforehand, several batches of these tests had been successfully moved to the station and safely disposed of. However, during the sixth series, Junior Researcher Markus Green had incorrectly inserted the sample container into the related device, resulting in it leaking onto the surfaces of the table and the pathway.\n\nThe sample then became partially airborne, causing two other junior researchers besides Green to be affected. The suits utilized presently were improperly calibrated for this form of infection, resulting in their immediate inhalation of the virus.\n\n**Afterward:** Intensive care was required to neutralize and clean up the spillage of the material after it had spread across the station and several meters onto the platform. Green, as well as the two other researchers, were expeditedly, hurriedly treated, as medical personnel had rushed to reach them from outside SCP-8090.\n\nEach of the junior researchers was declared deceased on the 29th. An emergency medical station has been established at the worksite, and additional sanitation practices have been employed. Senior Researcher Krow has been asked to extensively cover safety procedures with the attending researchers before beginning any form of study inside SCP-8090-A.\n\n**Addendum:** Head of Security Woodlock has launched a complaint for reprimandation against Senior Researcher Krow on grounds of irresponsible working conditions. This notice is pending.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[OPEN FILE]\" hide=\"[CLOSE FILE]\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++* Internal log - Interview: SCP-3580/002\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[<]]\n**Foreward:** SCP-3580 was transferred from its cell to one of the activity grounds within SCP-8090(I) beforehand.\n----\n//The two guards escorting SCP-3580 stand back as it enters the chamber, a spacious room lit up by a series of windows at the farside wall. They close the door and lock it before assuming positions at two corners of the room, watching it closely.//\n\n//It walks around, noticing Director Roufhous at the back of the room leaning on their cane turned away. It stares at them for several seconds before looking down by its side to find a table loaded with a katana and two prosthetics.//\n\n//It bends down, keeping its eyes ahead, as it tries to put one of the prosthetics into its shoulder socket. Once it gets into range, the arm begins to faintly glow as it attaches itself to SCP-3580. It grabs the other arm and slots it into place quickly before picking up the sword and charging over towards the Director.//\n\n//Running up, it takes a swing at Roufhous' neck.//\n\n//Then it stops, holding the blade there. Its breath grows heavy.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** This time, you'll stay dead. \n\n//The guards start to intervene but stop as Roufhous gestures towards them.//\n\n**Roufhous:** If it were that simple then you would still have your arms.\n\n//It kicks them at the back of their legs, causing them to fall to their knees.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** For everything you took from me, for everyone you killed - the one family I have ever had - I will make you know that same agony over, and over, and over again.

The unit, featuring a wireless camera connection, possessed a maximum battery life of roughly four minutes. It was delivered to the ring of the path overlooking the abyss below and was promptly activated and deployed.\n\nThe unit successfully passed through the wall of fire and began descending down the hole. At one minute and twenty-six seconds, the unit's visuals began to distort intermittently. At two minutes and forty seconds, after having made little apparent progress, it was decided to deem the drone expendable, and it was sent in further.\n\nAt three minutes and forty seconds, the drone passed through the hole and into a larger, open system. The area was completely dark, forcing the unit to activate its flashlight to little effect. At four minutes, the unit ran out of energy to operate its rotors, causing it to rapidly fall towards the bottom.\n\nAt five minutes and thirty seconds, it landed. The light briefly illuminated the footage, revealing, for only one frame, the image of a mound of skulls.\n[[/div]]\n-----\n= [[size 150%]]__**Addenda: 8090.8/Unkown Territory Exploration**__[[/size]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[OPEN MEETING TRANSCRIPT 2]\" hide=\"[CLOSE MEETING TRANSCRIPT 2]\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++* Internal log - Meeting 2\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\n**In attendance:**\n* O5-3\n* Director Pendant Roufhous - Project Labyrinth Director\n* Senior Researcher Adelaine Pepper - Project Labyrinth Historian\n* Senior Researcher Helius Krow - Anthropologist\n* Nu-7 Captain Mortimer Woodlock - Chief of Security\n----\n= //The group, save for Krow, is present all around the table, all silently waiting.//\n\n= //After two minutes, Krow enters the room with a collection of papers in hand.

There's no remote operating one down there.\n\n**Krow:** Well aware, actually. Which is why it will not be remote-operated at all.\n\n**Woodlock:** Excuse me?\n\n**Krow:** Two agents, at most, will manually fly it down there. That should give us plenty of time to observe that space, map it out, and what have you.\n\n**Woodlock:** Doc, sending drones in there is one thing, but sending real people down there is another. What about that fire wall? It may not singe the helicopter, but what about the persons inside piloting it? What happened to \"squeezing\" the POIs for all they're worth?\n\n**Krow:** From all of our experiments, we have come to an almost certain conclusion that when inorganic material is transported through the flames, the wall will part to make way for that shape. Their interior is unharmed. How do you think we perform our tests?\n\n**Woodlock:** Evidently not harmless enough. \"Almost certain\"? You want to send my people in there with nothing more than a half-assed guess?\n\n**Pepper:** Mortimer, please. Your concerns will be taken into account. We can have some Class-Ds test out Helius' hypothesis.\n\n**Krow:** It should work. The roof and flooring will prevent the fire from making contact with the personnel inside.

Woodlock:** For God's sake.\n\n**20:23:** //The team backs away as the helicopter flies up. It holds there for a moment as Cowrite awaits the final confirmation from COMMAND. He receives it, and the helicopter makes contact with the fire, causing it to open up around the hood of the vehicle before passing further to the cockpit and beyond. They emerge on the other side, unharmed. As they do, symbols begin to form on the exterior hull.//\n\n**20:23:** //Krow reaches for his communicator.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Well, how about that, Morty?\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Showoff.\n\n**Sr. Krow:** //Hm hmm//.\n\n**20:24:** //Cowrite flies them forward, overlooking the abyss below as they begin to descend.

They have to rise several times as the terrain grows and falls. As they pass by the skeletons below, their arms try to reach out towards the vehicle.//\n\n**20:50:** //The helicopter reaches a wall. The operatives look out to see hundreds of bodies all attempting to scale it. The caustic fluid seeps from high up, dripping down onto the skeletons and sending many of them falling back into the pile. Some manage to make it several hundred meters up and others climb out of sight.//\n\n**20:51:** //Maintaining this position overlooking the scene below, the roof of the helicopter audibly thuds. The top half of a skeletal figure lands on the hood of the vehicle before tearing into the hull with four arms. It looks up at the personnel, revealing its hollow, withered appearance. The top of its skull is caved in while its bottom jaw is cracked into two. It lets out a rasp as it reaches towards the cockpit.//\n\n**20:51:** //Krow grabs Cowrite's sidearm from its holster and steps out from the cockpit. The side door opens and he leans out, taking several shots at the figure, cracking what remains of it. He takes a sixth shot and the figure's skull is shattered. It lets go of the hood and slides off, falling back down with the rest.//\n\n**20:52:** //Stepping once more into the cockpit, Krow takes a seat.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Follow the walls. We might have the fuel to keep going.\n\n**20:52:** //The helicopter stays close to the edges as it begins to circle around the space.

Can't say they warned me if they can't say anything at all, though.\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Hmm.\n\n**21:20:** //Continuing at a heightened elevation, they watch below as the humanoid bodies slowly begin to fade out and are replaced by animalistic carcasses, all of which do not move. As they progress, the corpses soon transition again, though this time, the terrain below appears like a white desert. They move up several hundred meters and observe a vast number of structures jutting out from the ground, all arched over and grouped up in collections of eight.//\n\n**21:24:** //One large figure can be seen sticking out from the sand-like substance with a thick shell on its back and numerous appendages reaching out from its front side. This one appears dormant. Later, similar entities are seen embedded within the walls.//\n\n**21:40:** //The two pass through several more biomes, observing a variety of unknown animalistic and monstrous skeletal remains, the majority of which, however, appear to be humanoid.//\n\n**21:47:** //Symbols begin to appear on the walls that faintly glow with a golden light. Cowrite flies in closer, getting a better look at the innumerable lists. The writing is disproportionate to the size of the wall, allowing for, potentially, hundreds of thousands of these notes to be fitted within the space that the helicopter has seen thus far.//\n\n**21:51:** //Flying up, a larger passage can be seen cutting off the rest above them all. Cowrite backs up, allowing Krow to record the phrase before they continue on.//\n\n**22:12:** //In the distance, an echoing growl is heard.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Just this last bit, then we're out of here?\n\n**Sr. Krow:** I can live with that.\n\n**22:23:** //The symbols cut off here. Krow examines his recorder, taking note of the eight photographs.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Productive enough, it seems. Very well, you may take us out of here.\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Gladly.\n\n**22:26:** //Ascending quickly whilst heading towards the center of the chamber, another growl is heard, now in front of the helicopter.

Krow focuses on finding the source of the disturbance.//\n\n**COMMAND:** Your fuel is low. You need to return to the surface immediately.\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Not helping.\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Little they can do from up there.\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Yeah, I know that!\n\n**22:28:** //As the helicopter steadies itself, Krow is able to observe a large pillar-like structure ahead, tens of meters in diameter. It is curved semi-circularly and descends into the darkness below. Soon after he observes this, Krow spots another, then three more.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Fascinating. We're more than a kilometer above the ground, aren't we?\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** What are those things? Why do they look...\n\n**COMMAND:** Nevermind that. Get out of there now!\n\n**22:28:** //A roar is heard shortly below. The light peers into the darkness, noticing a singular, then a pair of long, slim strands of what appears to be bone. They then fall back out of sight as a series of six glowing red eyes open, staring straight at the personnel.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Oh dear.\n\n**COMMAND:** Pull out, now!\n\n**22:29:** //Cowrite forcefully throttles up. The semi-flesh-coated skull of the beast below comes further into view, revealing its head to be multiple times larger than the helicopter as its mouth gapes open, exposing hundreds of long and lean teeth placed about the three individual sets of jaws. More strand bones emerge along the spine of its head, as well as two front-facing horns that take up positions on either end of the helicopter.//\n\n**22:29:** //Flames begin to form inside the maw of the creature between its jaws. Further down, dozens of sparks can be seen positioned in numerous disparate sections of the unseen space. The sounds of wet flesh tearing are heard as the entity's mouth expands, letting out a guttural, echoing scream.//\n\n**22:30:** //Cowrite continues their ascent. The horns surrounding the helicopter follow closely in line with it. As the creature's shouting ceases, further unknown noises occur from outside the camera's view. The helicopter experiences major turbulence. A slow, furious, yet booming cacophony of voices is heard from below.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** //[[size 130%]]**HUMAN[[/size]]**.//\n\n**22:30:** //The horns bank to the right, skidding across the side of the vehicle as Cowrite narrowly avoids destruction. The structures retreat into the black for a short period as the head reorients itself beyond the camera's range.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Now may be a good time to test these wards, Martin.\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Just give me a minute!\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Got mine at the ready. I'd suggest you do th-\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Stow it!\n\n**22:31:** //Lights can be seen in the distance in front of the vehicle. The darkness is semi-illuminated as the three pairs of meter-wide eyes open in front of them. The onboard light tracks the horns as they encircle the helicopter once more.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** //[[size 145%]]**BEGONE![[/size]]**//\n\n**22:31:** //The head of the entity rushes forward at the personnel, jaws opened wide. Cowrite tries to fly up before the impact.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** //**[[size 155%]]FUCK OFF, YOU FAT LIZARD FUCK![[/size]]//**\n\n**22:31:** //A golden streak of light shines through the space, quickly emerging from well out of the camera's range to the scene in a half-second. A figure appears, which strikes the head of the entity, causing it, alongside its horns, to jerk back into the shade. The spikes scarcely do not strike the helicopter's hull as Cowrite hurriedly flies it up towards the entrance of the tunnel, screaming all the while.//\n\n**22:32:** //Below, quick flashes of light can be seen throughout the space before a massive burst of flame tears through the darkness. All manner of noises are heard as Cowrite flies back up through the pit.//\n\n**22:36:** //The walls around the helicopter begin to shine again as the two pass back into SCP-8090-A.//\n\n**22:37:** //Carefully, Cowrite flies the helicopter out from the abyss and around the sac in the center of the ring.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Well, we should have much to discuss now. This was very productive, thank you, Martin.\n\n**22:37:** //The rest of the team stand and approach the inferno. Cowrite speaks between panting.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** You're, you're not welcome. Jesus.\n\n**22:37:** //The helicopter nears the flames.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Hmm. Well, I appreciate it anyway.\n\n**22:37:** //A winged instance of SCP-8090-A1 navigates around the debris, the fire, and the sac. It begins to glide, claws outstretched, as it enters through the hole in the side of the vehicle. It thrashes around in the hull as it tries to reach the cockpit.//\n\n**22:37:** //Agt. Cowrite backs away from the fires, causing the helicopter to back up near the sac. Inside, he momentarily refocuses, handing his sidearm to Krow, before reverting his attention to the controls. At that time, the top rotors of the helicopter make slight contact with the sac for half a second, causing the structure to tear and drip with the caustic green liquid.//\n\n**22:38:** //The serpents reorient themselves to face the sac as it leaks. The diseased instance begins growling as it quickly closes the distance to inspect the structure while the other begins coiling around the ring.//\n\n**22:38:** //Krow opens the cockpit door and begins firing at the entity. It wildly attacks, swinging at his leg and tearing through his protective suit, leaving a gnarly gash beneath. He grunts and continues firing, holding onto the railing as Cowrite reorients the helicopter to avoid the sac.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** The hell are you thinking, Martin?\n\n**22:38:** //Krow struggles with the entity as it assails him. He takes repeated shots at its head, noticeably disfiguring it beyond functionality, but it continues its assault. He fires rounds into its wings, forming holes in them, and kicks it out. It falls and lands on the terrain of SCP-8090-A, screaming, before assimilating into it.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Clear?\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Yes- yes, just go.\n\n**22:39:** //The helicopter passes through the fire and lands. Agents assist Cowrite out of the vehicle as he begins panting, but freeze as they watch Krow limp away, crumble, and begin violently coughing. Woodlock looks over.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock** Doc?\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Stay back, agents.\n\n**22:39:** //Cowrite ceases hyperventilating and turns back.//\n\n**Agt. Cowrite:** Sir?\n\n**22:39:** //Between coughs, Krow manages to answer.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** It appears... unfortunately... I may have been... contaminated.\n\n**22:40:** //The group becomes silent. Krow gets to his feet and tries to patch the holes in his suit.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Adelaine should be able to cover... most of my duties.\n\n**22:40:** //Woodlock tosses his communicator over to Agent Duke.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Max, tell the station we need a medic.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** No.  \n\n**22:40:** //Woodlock spins around to face the director as they walk up.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** Excuse me, sir? And why not?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** We will not risk this anomaly spreading. He is already dead.\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** He still has a chance. There has to be some kind of a cure. What, do you want to just leave him here to die?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** His body has to be burned as well to kill the infection.\n\n**22:41:** //Both parties are silent. Woodlock's expression changes to a look of disgust.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** What is wrong with you?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Pardon me?\n\n**22:41:** //Roufhous' cane taps against the ivory.//\n\n**22:41:** //Woodlock's fists clench. He takes a sharp inhale.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** You and the goddamn higher-ups are always treating us like we're expendable - sending us out into whatever godforsaken situation just popped up on the other side of the world! You don't care if any of us will make it out alive so long as the problem is taken care of!\n\n**22:41:** //Woodlock steps forward to meet the director.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** We aren't fodder, we ain't your damn sacrifices either. He's a good man, and I'm sick and fucking tired of watching those die all around me by your Overseer's orders!\n\n**22:42:** //The Director reaches into their coat and puts their revolver to Woodlock's head.//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** This is a direct order. Stand down, Mortimer.\n\n**22:42:** //Around the two, the team takes hold of their rifles, readying them.//\n\n**Cpt. Woodlock:** No. I'm done spending lives for a pisspoor //job//.\n\n**22:43:** //The two stand there staring at each other.//\n\n**22:44:** //Roufhous clicks the hammer into position.//\n\n**Cpt.

They stash it away and turn, moving over to assess the damage to the helicopter.//\n\n**22:45:** //Woodlock lets out a deep exhale before nodding at Duke. He turns and walks over to Krow.//\n\n**Sr. Krow:** Bold putting yourself in that position. Now the rest of them will likely throw a fit over this insubordination.\n\n**22:45:** //Woodlock looks around him at the serpents surrounding the sac, which has begun to bloat around its injury as the wound closes itself. The armored instance watches the outside while the diseased entity stares at Krow. The Captain sighs.//\n\n**Cpt.

Because of his affliction, he will not presently be allowed to cross back into baseline reality. Currently, he is in a near-critical condition; multiple antibiotics have been employed, though show minimal signs of slowing down the infection.\n\nKrow's research team, as well as some junior researchers from Senior Researcher Pepper's group, have shifted their focus onto working on a method for healing Krow.

But, speaking of understanding threats, I think it would benefit us all if we... got a better understanding of your incident in particular yesterday, Woodlock.\n\n**Woodlock:** I stand by my actions.\n\n**O5-3:** Right, right. I saw that. Very brave, standing up for our hard-working, hard-fighting MTF.\n\n**Woodlock:** Thank you, sir.\n\n**O5-3:** And, while I do love impromptu strikes as much as the next man, I really don't.

Whatever this was, it saved Helius. We saw it before during the first exploration log when it flew to that other creature. I've designated this one SCP-8090-Ω.\n\n**O5-3:** But what is it?\n\n**Pepper:** I can't say for sure. But I have a theory, and it relates to something we saw earlier on.\n\n= //She fiddles with the projector again, changing the footage to the photos taken by Krow.//\n\n**Pepper:** These.

I'm sorry. Please go on.\n\n**Pepper:** Good. Now, I spent hours looking at these images. They translate to whatever language you're best with and even appear to change when looking at them remotely. That's how the others worked, at least. That's how some of these appear to work.\n\n**Pepper:** But not all of them do that. Some of them will change their spelling to letters I know, but their pronunciations look nothing like any dialect I know. And I think that's because they can't change. These words aren't translatable.\n\n**Woodlock:** What does that mean?\n\n**Pepper:** It means, from everything I've gathered, everything points to one idea. Those aren't words. They're names. Millions and millions of names.\n\n**Pepper:** But there's more than just that. The upper walls of that graveyard space - which I've taken to calling the cradle - Krow took special care to photograph a series of these special texts.\n\n= //She showcases a collection of photos, each displaying one to five words significantly larger than the rest.//\n\n**Pepper:** These ones, besides being bigger, are the headers for all the other passages. These have a bit more translatable meaning behind them, besides the unknown pronunciations. In fact, this one here, \"Holy First Home\", this sounds very similar to an old legend discovered within Yhiloyehyra.\n\n**Pepper:** The description told of a place, Hyphera, the domain and grand city of a goddess of magic. The same one the myths say Archine pledged herself to.\n\n**Woodlock:** So, these are all city names?\n\n**Pepper:** I don't think so. Hyphera, from what we've found, wasn't a city in the same way as New York. More like an entire continent.\n\n= //She swaps between the collection of photos of each instance of these writings. The sounds of the clicking projector fill the room.//\n\n**Pepper:** With this discovery in mind, I decided to take a group of juniors with me to take another look at that globe we found inside SCP-8090[I]-A.

Anything I could say now would almost derive entirely from fairytale myths and a shaky source.\n\n**O5-3:** Right.\n\n= //The group is silent for twenty seconds. Pepper winds the footage forward, viewing the unknown entity.//\n\n**Pepper:** This thing, I'll call it SCP-8090-Ψ, I believe it is either similar to or the same entity you observed in the first mission, Mortimer.\n\n**Woodlock:** It was too far away to see it properly. It's hard to tell what that even is.\n\n**Pepper:** Whatever this is, it is hostile, not just to us but to other parts of SCP-8090-A. SCP-8090-Ω saved Helius from it, and if it is the same entity observed during the first log, then the serpents, who have yet to attempt to harm us, are also against it.\n\n**O5-3:** It's insignificant. Whether or not the anomalies try to kill us does not determine our place in this. 8090-1 has been acting as if the world is going to end if we don't act now. What does it mean?\n\n**Pepper:** Well, Proxima has little idea of the inner workings of the dimension and 8090-1 won't talk without us giving into its demands. The only others we could theoretically speak to either tried to kill our guys or left before we could chat.\n\n**Pepper:** I hate to say it, but I think we may have to consider taking up the Monarch's offer.\n\n**Woodlock:** Hell no! Did you forget what that conniving son of a bitch did?\n\n**O5-3:** With Krow out of commission, we are down a major facet of active research into this anomaly as well as figuring out our best course of action. We can monitor it; we'll have to choose our words carefully and keep those cuffs on at all times. But we have to consider this.\n\n**Pepper:** I've taken a look into the Order's texts. Murals around Yhiloyehyra depict the group as having great medicinal powers. Even what I've seen from the requirements to ascend a member to knighthood has the person undergo massive physiological changes stemming from technological and carnomantic methodology.\n\n**Pepper:** If we were to accept POI-8090-1's offer, then he might be able to help Helius.\n\n**Woodlock:** Or he could lie to us and have us chasing geese while the man rots from the inside out!\n\n**O5-3:** Well then, we should discuss this some more before we decide on anything drastic.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\nOn the 2nd, POI-8090-1 was transported from its containment cell and was brought to meet with the four remaining major faculty.

When the battle was over, Akrim chose to stay with Archine while Xyrja called his sibling a fool and fled to seek a legacy of his own.\n\n**Pepper:** I'm listening.\n\n**SCP-3580:** Later, during the Second Storm, Archine asked Akrim to once again aid her in bringing an end to the Era of Yehyra. The two of them then sought to accomplish an unthinkable goal. With Archine's prowess in the arcane, and Akrim's scarcely matched might, they struggled for months until eventually they had done it - they sealed Yehyra away.\n\n**SCP-3580:** But the costs of their feat had taken their toll on both Archine and Akrim. Both of them had been crippled. Archine was laid to rest, her only family now her brother and sister to see her off.\n\n**SCP-3580:** But Akrim, still clinging to his old bones, knew the danger of leaving Yehyra unguarded. Xyrja, later meeting again with his brother, found him in his terrible condition. Xyrja had found no glory in his path. Instead, he had only found conflict with the mortals, who feared and hated the monster.\n\n**SCP-3580:** When the two met again, neither could utter a bitter word. Xyrja looked upon his ruined kin - years of dashed away disloyal regret realizing in the wounds he didn't shoulder with his brother. And so this time, when Akrim asked Xyrja to fight with him, Xyrja said yes. They traveled into Yehyra, and it is said there they have stayed, standing as a true testament to duty, even despite their inhumanity.\n\n**Pepper:** That word, Yehyra, what is that? Your temple is named after it, seemingly. There are references to it all around Yhiloyehyra in scorn of it. What is Yehyra?\n\n//SCP-3580 pauses for a moment and closes its eyes.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** An old legend. The realest of old wives' tales to tell the children at night. A place of unfathomable suffering. The Second Storm. The world, already on its knees, was brought down even lower. Cracked already, the Second Storm cleaved through what remained of the realms.\n\n**SCP-3580:** Few were left after it. But those who survived told the tale of how the old Crafter {{Ill}}, beloved by his people and his texts as a magnificent giver of life, but a coward who fled and hid at the peak of the Storm, took to his furnace amidst the one, newfound, hard-fought moment of peace. Like the rest of their accursed lot, he desired to clamber together a force to defend his domain. A weapon to keep the others at bay, and to force the others to bow should the wish arise.\n\n**SCP-3580:** He took the ether of the world and honed it down. He hammered away at it, chipping away as it got smaller and smaller, but more perfect for his design. For years, he worked to make his champion indomitable. Until no longer could he even see it.\n\n**SCP-3580:** Then the flesh started to spread. It burst outward from his cave in the ground, reaching out with alien tentacles. Then the animals ate from these free offerings of meat. It tasted magnificent, so they said. It had gifted them with the power to shape the world around them, and so they went back for more. But then the meat became rancid when they returned, and it was no longer so appetizing.\n\n**SCP-3580:** The animals began to decay and falter, but in the time that it had taken for their ailment to become apparent, they had already traveled out far. Some played in the waters and rivers. Others died before their bodies could fall back to the ground. And it continued from there.\n\n**SCP-3580:** It spread to the cities. And the gods began to fall once more. Children, the strong and stoic, and the elderly all alike were unable to fend off this affliction. Entire nations fell. And when the people begged the gods, their gods, their makers, - those resilient paragons, icons of what to aspire to appease, fight in their names, die in their names - they, they...\n\n//It stops for a moment before continuing.//\n\n**SCP-3580:** They were silent. They distanced themselves, taking to their realms untouched by the spreading curse, and left their creations to fend for themselves.\n\n**SCP-3580:** The world burned then. But not by the hands of the Crafters, no. Humanity's crown, our dominance we forged out of the ashes of that age. We left it behind and forgot about it for a chance at controlling our fate.\n\n**SCP-3580:** That's what //he// always told me.

The wind inside of it seemingly carries voices from one end of the chamber to another. At the center of this nightmarish domain sits the festering heart of, what we now know to be, {{Ill}}, the long-forgotten Crafter of plagues.\n\nWhile we are still trying to figure out the theological and historical aspects of this - separate from GOI-850's own perspective - there are certain things at play here that we do know for certain: SCP-8090-A is currently alive and it __must__ remain so.\n\nAmidst our explorations of SCP-8090-A, our agents have encountered numerous entities, whether hostile or neutral, that have become of key interest. Akrim and Xyrja, the diseased and armored serpents, legendary sworn protectors of this realm among them. From what we know, these two are a positive force that has proven instrumental to our organization's concept of normalcy.\n\nBesides them, there is another force inside that reality of immense importance: SCP-8090-Ψ.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Description:** SCP-8090-Ψ is a mountainous entity of indeterminate calculable size, observed by the Foundation only four times since SCP-8090-A's discovery, twice during missions. It is universally hostile, having attempted on one occasion to terminate personnel. Its scaled epidermis is intermittently exposed, revealing the recycled muscles making up its entire composition. Four equally massive wings protrude from its back, allowing it some amount of aviation capability.\n\nWhen its body is destroyed to the point of termination, SCP-8090-Ψ will temporarily cease functions, and its form will begin assimilating into the terrain of SCP-8090-A. After an indeterminate amount of time, however, it will fully regenerate within the cradle of the dimension, and reemerge topside, beginning its migration towards the heart once again.\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8090-Ψ is of critical concern to the ongoing containment of SCP-8090, and the status of the SCP Foundation itself.\n\nDuring every reemergence, SCP-8090-Ψ has attempted to reach the heart of SCP-8090-A. Before it can reach that point, it has always been blocked and neutralized by Akrim and Xyrja. These entities are protecting the heart from SCP-8090-Ψ, and keeping it alive, prolonging the current situation and potentially the status quo as a whole.\n\n__Divinity is fallible. Divinity too may die.__ The consequences of killing a god are not ones we are ready to face, especially one this volatile.\n\nFor this reason, SCP-8090-A cannot and must not be allowed to cease living under any circumstances.\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++* Incident Report: 03\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Foreward:** Taking place on the 3rd, while visiting the ring of SCP-8090-A, personnel encountered an unknown entity, detailed below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Camera footage begins with Captain Woodlock spending several minutes traversing the pathway on foot, accompanied by two other agents as well as Captain DeMarcus.//\n\n//As they pass into the ring section, he looks out toward the empty spots where the serpent entities would usually be. The group then takes the to the left side, making for the end of the path.//\n\n//After another few minutes, they arrive at the back, where Director Roufhous can be seen peering out through the cracks in the flames. Woodlock walks up to them.//\n\n**Woodlock:** You want to explain what you're doing here this far out alone?\n\n**Roufhous:** Relaxing. Sightseeing. You could stand to try it.\n\n**Woodlock:** I really wish I could here.\n\n//Woodlock gestures at DeMarcus and his group. They step back and talk amongst themselves.//\n\n**Woodlock:** So, are we gonna talk about what happened?\n\n**Roufhous:** Would rather not.\n\n**Woodlock:** Right.\n\n//The two silently stand for thirty seconds.//\n\n**Roufhous:** How long are you planning on staying there?\n\n**Woodlock:** Not sure. You?\n\n**Roufhous:** Fine. Come.\n\n//They move to the eastern side of the ring, walking for two minutes until they approach a table. On its surface, an oversized polished Gatling gun can be seen, an accompanying ammo belt right beside it.//\n\n//Woodlock looks directly at it. His eyes slowly open wide.//\n\n**Woodlock:** What... what did you do?\n\n**Roufhous:** More than dog tags were salvaged from that shitshow, even though you lot botched it entirely.\n\n**Woodlock:** That's...\n\n**Roufhous:** A complimentary part of your promotion.\n\n**Woodlock:** The weapon //that thing//[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]SCP-3580-A.[[/span]] used to kill my teammates.\n\n//Woodlock turns away from the table and looks through the flames down below.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Lock it away. Incinerate it. Fling it into this red sea, I don't care. Just get rid of it!\n\n**Roufhous:** It's a gift. What you do with it is up to you.\n\n**Woodlock:** I don't want it!\n\n**Roufhous:** Why not? It's a great tool, evidently effective!\n\n//A flash of light is seen high above from atop one of the pale structures.//\n\n**Woodlock:** That's fucking why!\n\n**Roufhous:** Don't you think that a gun is separate from the one pulling the trigger?\n\n//Turning, Woodlock faces them.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Excuse me?\n\n**Roufhous:** Do you think there's a distinction between the thing being used and the person using it?\n\n**Woodlock:** Yes.\n\n**Roufhous:** Well, there you have it. The monster used this piece to murder your comrades. Now, in your hands, you can decide what it is used for now.\n\n**Woodlock:** This is... this isn't right.\n\n**Roufhous:** //Make it right//, then. Take it or leave it. Either way, the past still faces us. Whether or not you can face it is up to you.\n\n//They take a step away. Woodlock moves away from the table, pacing around for a bit. His breath is heavy. Soon, a sound comes over his communicator, and he hastily pulls it up to his ear.//\n\n**Woodlock:** What is it?\n\n**DeMarcus:** We're under attack! It's too fast it's-\n\n//The communicator cuts out.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Andrew? Andrew come in! Andrew- shit!\n\n//The sound of falling sand is heard as a streak of golden light swerves in action high above and around the path. At its forefront, a bright glowing figure is seen quickly bounding around the air.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Sir, look out!\n\n//Roufhous arcs their cane over their head. Their Zweihander slams against the ground. Woodlock tries to aim at the figure but fails to keep up with it.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** //[[size 140%]]**I TOLD YOU ALL TO STAY AWAY![[/size]]//**\n\n//Moving back and forth, it lunges down and charges around the two. It slams into Woodlock, sending him to his back. It turns and attacks Roufhous, who struggles to block the hits as they come. The two are locked there as Woodlock manages to get a look at it.//\n\n//The figure is huge and coated in thick armor, apparently constructed from various flesh materials and bones, and wears a cowl made from large scales. Its head is covered by a four-horned Spartan-like helmet. Two pairs of wings are tucked into its back. In its only arm, it holds a shield. A scabbard at its side holds onto a long strand of flame.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** //[[size 130%]]**YOUR KIND ARE NOT WELCOME HERE!**//[[/size]]\n\n//The two continue their exchange while Woodlock gets to his feet. He aims his rifle at it and fires at its leg. Without looking, one of the figure's wings extends outward and absorbs the bullets.//\n\n//A spark of light erupts from its shield, blinding Roufhous, and allowing it to bash them backward several meters. Its hand rises as its fingers contort to create a thaumic symbol towards Woodlock. His rifle instantly crumbles apart while he is sent to the ground.//\n\n//Running up, Roufhous takes a swing at the figure. Their sword is stopped in mid-air as it connects with a golden barrier.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** **[[size 115%]]I should'a known no child of mine would obey a pissy order like that.[[/size]]**\n\n**Woodlock:** Who are you?!\n\n//It briefly laughs as it turns to him. It grabs its helmet and takes it off, revealing an aged, morbid, dark-skinned, vaguely feminine face with long drenched hair. Both of its eyes glow bright yellow.//\n\n**Archine:** I'm disappointed. Can't even recognize your greatest grandmother?\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"widetable tableb table5\"]]\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n||~ [[size 175%]]**Ω** __[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8090/offset/2 FILE 3/3]__ **Ω**[[/size]] ||\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
