He'd tried to use watches, but watches only worked when you had eyes to watch them with. Same with a metronome. So Moon counted. \n\n//One... Two, Three...//\n\nThirty two thousand, four hundred and sixty seconds. That was how long he'd been able to see. Moon felt his bones cry out in protest as he rose to the chamber door. In approximately three hundred twenty four seconds, a Security Agent would open it and let him out. Give or take twenty nine, if the Agent was slow.\n\n//Thirty... Thirty one... Thirty two.//\n\nMoon's face was clouded, partially with worry and partially because it was a cloudy night. This particular Agent was an early-bird, and it'd thrown off the count. Deciding that he could make do until it reset, he timed the approximate two and a quarter of a second it took him to make a step with his cane. \n\n//Four and a half... Six and three quarters... Nine...//\n\nThe air conditioning had been on for five hundred sixty seconds when Moon took his seat. Waiting here was the hardest part. In five hundred seconds, the doors would open and they would see him. He'd watched one hundred and twenty pitying expressions staring at him. \n\n//Five thousand, six hundred seventy three....

Mr. Moon had lied to her three thousand, five hundred times. At least Jim hadn't accompanied her this time.\n\n//Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven...//\n\nShe cut the visit short by ten minutes. Apparently she'd been five minutes late to a social event, and had been paying him a favor to visit. Fifty seconds later, she'd left him again. She was getting quicker.\n\nFive thousand, nine hundred seconds later, Moon's ear began to grow dull. He paced his cell, counting the steps. Eleven and a half steps north to south, fifteen and a quarter east to west. Pacing until the count could reset and bring him respite.\n\n//One... Two...
