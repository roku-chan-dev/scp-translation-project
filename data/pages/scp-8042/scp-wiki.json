It simultaneously works alongside Foundation accountants as a freelance tax agent for various entities and Groups of Interest. Priority is to be given for high-risk anomalous entities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8042 is a sapient male //Ornithorhynchus anatinus//[[footnote]] A platypus. [[/footnote]], capable of instantaneous spatial and dimensional translocation, and is anomalously durable. It has an obsession with finances, and displays a manic desire to maintain them for any entity it encounters, to the point where it is willing to risk its own safety to achieve its goal. SCP-8042 possesses a photographic memory regarding taxation and finances, and is completely impervious to memetic hazards in this regard. SCP-8042 can also anomalously produce economic records for any entity it encounters, regardless of whether or not said entity has ever possessed any finances.\n\nWhenever SCP-8042 engages an entity regarding its finances, anomalous or otherwise, it temporarily renders said entity indolent and docile, where it may remain in this state for a minimum of three hours. It is hypothesized that these effects are Reality Anchoring in nature, but as this has no effect on entities with long-term business relationships with a separate accountant, the data is inconclusive.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8042/Duck-billed_platypus_%28Ornithorhynchus_anatinus%29_Scottsdale_3.jpg\n|caption=SCP-8042.

Information regarding the entity was provided by WWS and supplemented by SCP-8042 itself during a later interaction (See Addendum-1). Due to its capabilities, it was initially registered as a Keter-class object; subsequent negotiations with WWS representatives and SCP-8042 have since altered its class to its current designation.\n\n**Addendum-1:** An interaction with SCP-8042, conducted by Beta-4 Captain Natalia Szabo.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Szabo:** So: you're a platypus.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Yes ma'am: Joriah Shenandoah Cuthbert, eleven years old[[footnote]] The average lifespan of a non-anomalous platypus in captivity is thirty years. [[/footnote]], CPA[[footnote]] A Certified Public Accountant. [[/footnote]]. \"J.S.\" to my friends.\n\n**Szabo:** That's...\n\n**SCP-8042:** Certified Platypus Accountant. //(SCP-8042 indicates its Master of Accounting and Taxation Degrees)// What can I do for you?\n\n**Szabo:**  You...went to school for that?\n\n**SCP-8042:** Yes ma'am, at the University of Melbourne.\n\n**Szabo:**  Can you verify this?\n\n**SCP-8042:** Certainly, ma'am[[footnote]] A Foundation background check verified that while SCP-8042 is fully certified, it did not attend any known university. [[/footnote]].\n\n**Szabo:**  And...why did you go into accounting?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Oh, because I love numbers, ma'am, and economic organization and record-keeping excites me. I guess it takes all kinds, huh? Wakk waak.\n\n**Szabo:**  I...see.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Of course, my parents thought that I should just spend my life swimming around, eating larvae, worms, and shrimp like every other platypus, but I had a different goal in mind! I had ambitions! And look where I am now.\n\n**Szabo:**  //(stammering)// Y-yes. So you're one of Wilson's accountants.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Not just their accountant, ma'am: their //chief// accountant! And I run a tight ship, too: clean, precise, accurate, and on the level. But that's only my side job. Otherwise, I'm strictly freelance.\n\n**Szabo:**  What do you mean?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Tax season, ma'am, tax season! Let me tell you, it's the most stressful time of the year, wakk! You wouldn't //believe// the kinds of people I've ran into during that time period! The horror stories, wakk wakk, would make your gizzard churn. So many people wait until the last minute -- and their taxes are either so far behind that they predate the Pyramids, or so sloppy that sometimes I just want to sit down and cry! That's why I have to take a whole month off after everything's over. Waaaaakk.\n\n//(silence. Captain Szabo appears stunned.)//\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Yes, I know. It's disheartening, and yet so preventable!  But I'm always willing to help people, because it's my job and I love it.

Not too many people like an accountant getting on their case.\n\n**Szabo:**  Wh-what... //(Szabo pauses to drink from a flask.)// What sorts of clients do you have, if you don't mind my asking?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  I don't mind, ma'am, though I can't divulge the state of their finances. I take confidentiality very seriously!\n\n**Szabo:**  Uh, of course, of course. I'd just like to...uh, see who you've assisted.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  I'd be glad to. Heh, I always like to round off a few of my high-profile clientele to -- oh, shoot, I just forgot!\n\n**Szabo:**  What?\n\n**SCP-8042:** I was supposed to meet some new clients today. Heh, I guess I lost track of time!\n\n**Szabo:**  New...clients?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Yes. How do you think I stay in business, ma'am? By sitting on my keister? //(laughs and quacks)// Of course, I could just send them an email or call them, but I prefer the personal touch, you know?

I have to go meet some clients for awhile. Would it be all right if Captain Szabo accompanies me?\n\n**McLeod:** It's all right by me. We just need to check you out.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Of course, of course. If you'll excuse me, ma'am: I won't be but a moment.\n\n//(McLeod assists SCP-8042 with the checkout process. Szabo notes that SCP-8042 has some difficulty writing with a pen.)//\n\n**Szabo:** So, um, how did you acquire this, uh... The services of this //individual//?\n\n**McLeod:** Oh, //(laughs)// he just came in through the front door around early March last year, begging to do our taxes for us. The little fella was so persistent that we figured, \"why not give him a chance?\", and he's been with us ever since.\n\n**Szabo:** //(nods slowly)// And do you have any records of where he was before that?\n\n**McLeod:** Well, platypuses are native only to western Australia. As far as we know, he was swimming along merrily in some river until he started attending University.  Oh, before I forget, would you mind doing me a favor? There's a carrying case in that refrigerator over there; it's got J.S.'s meals for the day. Could you take that with you, please?\n\n**Szabo:**  Uh, sure. \n\n//(Szabo opens the refrigerator and takes out a large cooler. Inside are packets full of various worms, centipedes, larva, and raw shellfish. Szabo cringes and immediately closes the cooler.)//\n\n**McLeod:** Thanks. Just make sure he eats every two hours, okay?\n\n//(SCP-8042 finishes checking out and approaches Szabo.)//\n\n**SCP-8042:**  There, that wasn't so bad.

I'm guessing you have a...boat or airplane or...\n\n**SCP-8042:**  No, I hate riding in vehicles:  it rattles me horribly and upsets my digestion. I have a much better way of getting there.

Any I might know of?\n\n//(SCP-8042 puffs its chest out, slapping it with a webbed foot.)//\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Marshall, Carter, & Dark for one!\n\n//(Szabo's eyes widen.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Are you serious? You do accounting for MC&D?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Yes, or at least I used to. They wanted someone to work year-round for them, but my contract with Wilson's forbids that. Still, they were very courteous and professional, and we parted on good terms.\n\n**Szabo:**  //(whistles)// Color me impressed.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  I've also done taxes for IKEA, or at least [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3008|one of their stores]]]. Boy, what a stubborn lot //they// were!\n\n//(Szabo turns pale.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  You've...done taxes for IKEA.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Hmm, yes, and I almost regret it. Terrible communication during the daytime, and violence during the night! I managed to score a few private clients the last time I was in their store, though. Had to promise them I'd get them out, which was odd, but...a client is a client![[footnote]] It was later confirmed that SCP-8042 was able to extract four civilians from SCP-3008-1. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Szabo:**  //(muttering)// Of course you do taxes for 3008, why wouldn't you?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Hehnk? What's that?\n\n**Szabo:**  Never mind. So who will you be seeing next?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  A Mr. Wondertainment -- wak, or is it Ms. Wondertainment? The instructions were a bit unusual.\n\n**Szabo:**  //(grumbles)// Fantastic.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n__Location__: directly in front of a Wondertainment, Co. Factory\n\n__Date__: 20th November\n\n//(Dr. Wondertainment is carefully reading a document. He is currently male.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:** Hmm, yes, yes, I see, yes, hmm. Taxes, you say? Accounting, is it?\n\n**SCP-8042:** Yes. You seem to be in need of someone who can keep your financial affairs in order, and tax season's right around the corner!\n\n**Wondertainment:** Ho, ho, yes, they are a bother and a nuisance. Keeping track of all my profits and losses, net gains, the cost of my goods, the transaction data...\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Not to mention the dividends, the taxable interest from loans, all your stocks, the adjusted journal entries every month, the use-in-excise files... Oh, and employee healthcare provisions!\n\n**Wondertainment:** Yes, yes, and on top of all that, I have to worry about the federal returns on all my territories! If you think going international with my business is stressful enough, imagine going multiversal! Oh, and all the partnership returns I have to file! Some of them, I don't even think I could describe, much less file a relevant form for!\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Frankly, it's more stress than you deserve, sir.\n\n**Wondertainment:**Yes, I'd love nothing more than to wave my hand and send all that flying away in a puff of smoke, but even I must follow a //few// rules! Tax season is the one time of year that I must take seriously. Very painful, yes, quite embarrassing--and yet you say you'd take that proverbial bullet for me?\n\n**SCP-8042:**  With a smile, my good doctor.\n\n**Wondertainment:** Ah, indeed, and platypuses are remarkable accountants, or so I've been told. The last individual I trusted with my taxes was a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7333|lizard]]], but he didn't... Well, to put it politely, he didn't have a sense of humor.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Well I love a good joke, wak-wak.\n\n**Wondertainment:** Is that so? //(Wondertainment smiles, twirling his mustache.)// Well then, how about a proposition? I'll agree to hire you on as an accountant, //if//!!!\n\n//(He pauses dramatically.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:** You agree to my terms.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  And what are your terms?\n\n**Wondertainment:** You must accomplish thr-r-r-r-r-r-ree tasks for me, to prove that you have a sense of humor! First, I want you to walk through that door and out the other side. //(He indicates the entrance to his factory.)//\n\n**SCP-8042:**  That's it?\n\n**Wondertainment:** Yes. That's it. Oh, and you have to survive the ordeal. Naturally.\n\n**SCP-8042:**  Hahnk! This'll be easy! //(It waddles up to the door.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  All right, have fun. I think I'll take the long way around.\n\n**Wondertainment:** Oh no, my dear:  you're going with him!\n\n**SCP-8042:** Wakk?\n\n**Szabo:**  What?! Wait: he's the one who wants to do your taxes; I'm just following along to keep track of him.\n\n**Wondertainment:** Ah, so his health and safety is a concern of yours?\n\n**Szabo:**  //(stammers)// Well, I...it...I mean you... The relationship between Wilson's and the Foundation would--\n\n**Wondertainment:** Then perhaps you should continue to monitor him, yes? You wouldn't want //my// relationship with the Foundation to suffer, either, would you?\n\n//(Szabo continues to stammer as she glances between Wondertainment and SCP-8042. Finally she throws her arms up in resignation.)//\n\n**Szabo:** Fine, have it your way. So we just go through that door and out the other side.\n\n**Wondertainment:** That is correct, my dear. //(He chuckles grimly.)//\n\n**Szabo:** //(sighs)// All right. Lead the way, Cuthbert.\n\n//(Szabo and SCP-8042 enter the factory together. They find themselves in a colorful reception area.)//\n\n**Szabo:** Well, at least it's well-lit.\n\n//(Suddenly, all the lights go out. Szabo sighs.)//\n\n**Szabo:** I fully deserve that. \n\n//(She produces a flashlight, and the two make it through the reception area. They soon find a hallway branching off in two directions. On the right is a brightly-lit sign reading \"SEKRIT [sic] EXIT! Totally safe! (trust me!)\". The left sign is adorned with a plastic skeleton draped over it, and reads \"DANGER! Deadly lazors [sic] ahead! 100% chance of mutilation!\")//\n\n**SCP-8042:** Ha! See? We're almost out of here! //(It waddles to the right path.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  No, wait. //(She points to the left path.)// We go down here.\n\n**SCP-8042:** B-but it says--\n\n**Szabo:**  Trust me, Cuthbert: this is Wondertainment we're talking about.\n\n//(SCP-8042 hesitates. Szabo produces a dummy grenade from her belt and throws it down the right path. It bounces on the floor once before a hidden panel opens and a stream of flames incinerate it.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  See? Down here.\n\n**SCP-8042:** W-well, if you're certain, captain.\n\n//(They take two steps down the left path before a trap door opens beneath them. Wondertainment is heard laughing over the P.A. system as they fall.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:** Hahahahahahaaa!  SECRET THIRD OPTION!!\n\n//(Szabo and SCP-8042 fall down a chute and land on top of a large mass.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Ow. Ugh, I guess had that coming to me. Well-played, doctor. You okay, Cuthbert?\n\n**SCP-8042:** Wak, just some ruffled fur. Nothing a mouthful of wriggling shrimp can't fix! Hehnk, where are we?\n\n**Szabo:**  No idea. Damn, I lost my flashlight while we were falling. I don't suppose the doctor would be willing to turn the lights back--\n\n//(Suddenly the lights come back on. Szabo and SCP-8042 look down, discovering they have landed on a large red entity. It roars, flailing countless appendages. Szabo and SCP-8042 yell in surprise and fall off.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:** OH MY GOD, IT'S A MONSTER! WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO?!\n\n//(SCP-8042 panics and tries running away. Szabo holds her ground and produces her sidearm. She fires four shots at the entity. It falls over, but quickly gets back up.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  //(sighs)// I don't know why I thought that would work.\n\n//(The entity wraps one of its appendages around SCP-8042, squeezing it. Another disarms Szabo. She rolls out of the way and produces a live grenade.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Cuthbert! Fire in the hole!\n\n//(The entity wraps an appendage around Szabo's arm, preventing her from using the grenade. A second appendage wraps around her waist. She attempts to free herself.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Augh! Damn it! Why is it so sticky?!\n\n//(Her eyes suddenly widen in realization.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Oh. I get it.\n\n//(She reaches into her belt, producing a serrated knife, and cuts herself loose. Szabo quickly rolls under another appendage and frees SCP-8042. Two appendages pin her to the floor, causing her to drop her knife.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Hey! Cuthbert! A little help here?\n\n**SCP-8042:** W-wakk, but I hate violence! I'm an accountant, not a fighter.\n\n**Szabo:** JUST DO IT, YOU PIECE OF-- \n\n//(An appendage wraps around her head. SCP-8042 cringes as it takes the knife and quickly cuts Szabo loose. It eagerly hands the knife back.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Thanks. Watch it! \n\n//(Another appendage snaps at them; Szabo and SCP-8042 dive for cover. Szabo grabs SCP-8042 and hurls it at the entity, where it becomes stuck. She uses this distraction to charge at the entity, plunging her knife into it and cutting diagonally. The entity roars and flails in pain. Szabo peels SCP-8042 off and stands back as the entity rolls around, finally collapsing and laying still. They take a moment to catch their breath.)//\n\n**SCP-8042:** Ca...captain, that was...that was marvelous! How did you...\n\n**Szabo:**  Simple. //(She approaches the motionless entity and nudges it with her foot.)// It's red tape. You literally cut through it.\n\n//(SCP-8042 laugh-quacks as they find an exit and make their way back outside, where Dr. Wondertainment awaits them. She is currently female.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:**  Ah, well-done, well-done, both of you! I hope it wasn't too rough for you in there? Of course, you could have just taken the long way around.\n\n//(Szabo glares at her.)//\n\n**Wondertainment:** Kidding, kidding! //(laughs nervously)// And now, for your final task! You must prove to me that--\n\n**SCP-8042:** Wakk, but didn't you say you had three tasks for us?\n\n**Wondertainment:** Well, yes, but the so-called \"Rule of Thr-r-r-r-r-ree\" is so banal! So stale! So...ugh, //predictable//! Nobody expects to only have //two// tasks to complete! Besides, all this talk about taxes and finances has exhausted me.  I may just shut down early today so I can relax. \n\n**Szabo:**  Fair enough. What do you want us to do?\n\n**Wondertainment:**  Behold! //(She removes her hat, firing off several sparklers from it.)// You must prove to me that your wits are as sharp as your sword! Answer my -- oh, hold on a second. //(Wondertainment quickly stomps out a stray sparkler.)// Sorry! Answer my riddle and my services are yours--or is it \"your services are mine\"?\n\n**Szabo:** So we just need to answer one riddle and we're done?\n\n**Wondertainment:** Correct!\n\n**SCP-8042:** Wak, I'm ready!\n\n**Wondertainment:**  Good! Ahem: \"When stormclouds gather and raindrops fall, you'll be glad you have this fella; but don't name it anything mundane at all, no! Don't call it an umbrella!\" What is it?\n\n//(SCP-8042 mutters quietly to itself.)//\n\n**Szabo:**  Do you want me to help?\n\n**SCP-8042:** No, I want to do it myself! You took the last one, now I want to give this one a try. \n\n//(It continues to mutter to itself. Szabo shrugs at Wondertainment. She types a word on her cell phone and presents it to Wondertainment, who winks and places a finger on her lips.)//[[footnote]] The word she typed was \"bumbershoot\".[[/footnote]]\n\n**Szabo:** Hey, if you don't need me for anything else, do you mind if I call it a day? I'd like to report back to base and...find a good tavern to self-amnesticize in while I wonder what I'm doing with my life.\n\n**SCP-8042:** Don't you want me to take you back?\n\n**Szabo:** I'll call up Zeta-15[[footnote]] One of the task forces assigned to monitor Dr. Wondertainment. Code name \"Golden Ticket\". [[/footnote]], they owe me a favor.\n\n**SCP-8042:** Oh. Well, if you're sure...\n\n**Szabo:** I am //very// positive.\n\n**SCP-8042:** Wak, all right. And be sure to put in a good word for me with the Foundation! I've been wanting to do their taxes for years now!\n\n**Szabo:** Oh, I'm sure they'll arrange something.\n\n**SCP-8042:** Thanks, Captain. You'd really be doing me a favor! Hehnk, now...I'm pretty sure it's not a parasol...hmm...\n\n//(Szabo looks at SCP-8042 one more time before bidding Wondertainment farewell. The doctor tips her hat and bows as SCP-8042 continues trying to solve the riddle.)//\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum-2:** Following Captain Szabo's report, SCP-8042 was contacted by the Foundation, who made an arrangement with Wilson's Wildlife to acquire its services on an as-needed basis.

[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-179|SCP-179]]] was observed waking up from its stasis, and appeared puzzled as the object approached it. Sounds of faint, mechanical breathing could be heard from the object as it drew closer to SCP-179.
