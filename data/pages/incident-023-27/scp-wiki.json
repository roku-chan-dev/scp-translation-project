D-class personnel sent in to check area around SCP-023's enclosure. [DATA EXPUNGED] gone. Only trace of SCP-023 is a burnt section of floor around a puddle of colored glass.\n\n----\n\n**Personal Log of:** Dr. ████\n\n**Date: ██/██/████**\n\nIt's my fault. I have doomed my research team, and possibly the rest of the facility. All that's left is to keep trying. We must contain SCP-023.\n\n\n**Note:** On ██/██/████, one year after Incident 023-27, ███ personnel were interred in an unmarked mass grave outside Site-██.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
