Captured positive TR is to be redistributed into high-ranking members of staff to increase the efficiency of site operations at Experimental Site-87. Due to the invention of TCED devices, usage of TRT has been banned, and violators are to be reprimanded.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6153 is the designation for a previously widespread probabilistic phenomenon affecting the outcomes of certain individuals, designated SCP-6153-B and SCP-6153-A instances. SCP-6153 levels are measured using the Tyche Emanation Quantifier, with lower levels indicating more negative outcomes and higher levels the opposite. SCP-6153 is currently the sole responsibility of the Department of Anomalous Probability (Formerly Project Lakshmi).\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n__**Addendum; Procedure Lakshmi**__\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Procedure:** All incoming Class D personnel are to be scanned for Tyche Radiation, if high levels of positive TR are detected, they are to be sent to Experimental Site-87. All Tyche radiation in these subjects is to be removed via TCED, and former SCP-6153-A instances are to be sent to sites in need of Class D personnel. The staff of experimental site 87 are to utilize TCED's on objects and staff around the site to increase site efficiency. All anomalous objects at Site-87 are to be imbued with negative Tyche Radiation if possible.\n\n**Results:** Extreme increase in efficiency and safety at experimental site 87 \n\n**Analysis:** Request for expansion of Project Lakshmi submitted to 05-12\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum; Project Lakshmi success report:** \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nTO: 05-12\nFROM: Dr Malcome Reese\n----\n05-12, I am incredibly proud to inform you that Project Lakshmi has met with incredible success. The site we have been using to test potential widespread application to staff has had no containment breaches since its creation, and site funding is no longer a problem thanks to the financial department having high levels of Tyche Radiation. Overall, site efficiency is up 214% over site 19. Due to this tremendous success, I am submitting a formal request to have Project Lakshmi extended to all sites, and so far there has been only huge increases in site productivity.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nRE: Project Lakshmi success report\nFROM: 05-12\n----\nThat's great to hear Malcome, you have my permission to extend Project Lakshmi. I will increase funding for the project, however, TCED's currently located at site 87 are to be delivered to the council for inspection. \n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n> [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6153/offset/2|A revision of this article has been found, please enter SCP 6/6153 clearance]]]\n[[/=]]",
