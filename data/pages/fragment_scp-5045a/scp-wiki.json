The flagged phrase will be manually reviewed for SCP-5045 influence and deleted when necessary.\n\nA single copy of SCP-5045 is kept within Terminal 577-B within Site-301. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5045 is a virtual reality game that is compatible with most virtual reality headsets titled \"Goat VR.\" Before discovery, SCP-5045 could be downloaded at several websites dedicated to obscure games, as well as its own website.\n\nSCP-5045 begins with a title screen with \"GOAT VR\" displayed in large neon green and purple text. Below the title is a button titled \"play\" which, when pressed, puts the player into a cartoonish 3D environment vaguely resembling that of a neon blue farmhouse surrounded by a black void. The ground is covered in a neon green grass texture, and bounded by a blue colored picket fence which surrounds the farmhouse. Travel beyond the fence is impossible, due to an invisible barrier blocking access.\n\nContained within a narrow space enclosed by the fence are several animate entities resembling goats, drawn in a similar style to the surroundings. These goats exhibit simple and repetitive behavior in which they walk unimpeded until reaching a barrier, in which case they will turn around and walk in a different direction. These goats are drawn in two dimensions, appearing as a flat shape. Despite their simple stylization, however, their movements appear smooth and uniquely generated, with no use of repeating frames or walk cycles. --No content related to the goats has been found in the game's files.-- [[footnote]] View the SCP-5045's Files log for more details.

SCP-5045-1 refers to itself as \"Farmer\" and displays a degree of sapience, often attempting communication with the player and responding to verbal questioning. Even when loaded in headsets devoid of a microphone, SCP-5045-1 is capable of detecting and understanding the player's speech, as well as, to a limited degree, loud sounds nearby.\n\nSCP-5045-1 employs various tactics to increase playtime during a given play session. Such tactics include the generation of visual effects in the corner of the player's field of view, bleating sounds emanating from beneath various surfaces, and requests to join him in an activity such as watching the goats together. When questioned about these tactics, SCP-5045-1 unilaterally denies their existence.\n\nAfter a variable amount of time, SCP-5045-1 will vocalize to the player \"Thanks for playing Goat VR!\" before shutting the headset off, which continues to draw power until disconnected. Upon this happening, the player falls into an indefinite vegetative state.\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-5045 Short Term Exploration\" hide=\"- SCP-5045 Short Term Exploration\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**Subject:** D-1711\n**Researcher:** Researcher Ivan Cherv\n**Experiment:** D-1711 is instructed to play SCP-5045 and explore its in-game environment.

Really colorful. \n\n//D-1711 groans.//\n \n**D-1711:** Guys, my head's killing me already and I just started!\n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** This will only take ten minutes. For the record, could you describe what you are seeing?\n\n**D-1711:** Alright... uhh, everything's all black and outlined in these bright neon colors. Not many colors actually. The ones I can list so far are blue, green, and some specks of white in the distance. Looks like a cartoon. In front of me there's this fence and a barn, both outlined in bright blue. Below me is some patchy bright green grass, and above me is darkness.\n\n(D-1711 looks over towards the fence area of SCP-5045)\n\n**D-1711:** I think I'm going to get closer to those little white fellas over by the fence. I can see them moving.\n \n//D-1711 starts heading towards the blue fence, and stops as he is close enough to the fence to make out a collection of fourteen crudely drawn cartoon goats maneuvering around the area. Many of the goats are bleating. Further back, more goats can be seen, although it is hard to make out how many there are.//\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5045/log1goats.png|caption=SCP-5045's fence area.

All these goats, look like bad cartoons, wandering around, bumping into each other.\n\n**D-1711:** I swear, there's gotta be more of those little guys back there than I can see clearly. Awww, that one over there looks scared!\n\n//D-1711 looks to a goat from behind the fourteen goats displayed. It is difficult to make out given the resolution, but a two-dimensional goat is seen with a concerned expression on its face. Its overlarge eyes dart around frantically.//\n\n**D-1711:** Poor guy. Wonder what's got him so stressed out.\n\n//D-1711 looks back at the fourteen goats being displayed.//\n\n**D-1711:** Honestly, this is impressive. Considering the art quality, I expected some choppy animations, but these guys are really fluid.

D-1711 yelps, startled.//\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5045/log1farmer.png|caption=D-1711's POV upon discovering SCP-5045-1.]]\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Howdy! The name's Farmer! \n\n**D-1711:** Gah! That scared the hell out of me! \n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Didn't mean to frighten you!

Look at them go!\n\n//D-1711 turns to look at the fence and chuckles.//\n\n**D-1711:** You don't need to tell me that. God, these things are hilarious. \n\n//SCP-5045-1 nods, smiling.//\n\n**D-1711:** Say, are there any other farm animals here that you can show me?\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Not a chance. Goats are all I need! They're great listeners.\n\n//SCP-5045-1 begins pointing emotively at the goats displayed at the fence area.//\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** These ones especially! I'll show you!\n\n//SCP-5045-1 puts his hand up to his mouth and generates a sharp whistling sound. As this happens, all fourteen goats collectively freeze in place and look directly at SCP-5045-1.//\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Thank you! Now please, greet our new guest.\n\n//Each goat turns their head towards D-1711 and bleats.//\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Isn't that kind of them?\n\n**D-1711:** Yeah that's... cool? Listen, my head's aching, can I jus- wait a minute. I hear something.\n\n//D-1711 turns towards the fence area. A goat is dragging their head across the floor, with an irritated expression.//\n\n**D-1711:** Ummm, are they supposed to be doing that? \n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Hey!\n\n//SCP-5045-1 turns towards the goat, visibly angered.//\n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Am I gonna have to make you stop doing that? Do you have any idea how ridiculous you look? Second time this week! How hard is it to give people a good time, friend?\n\n**D-1711:** Friend?\n\n//The timer for SCP-5045 concludes and the game is shut off. D-1711 takes off his VR headset.//\n\n**D-1711:** Oh thank god. Kinda relieved to take this thing off, my head was burning up and it was starting to smell really bad in there.  \n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Smell? How would you describe this smell?\n\n**D-1711:** I dunno, cigarettes? Wood smoke? Couldn't really put my finger on it.

But as for you... you're an open book! Always asking questions, being honest. It's a real shame you have to be so nasty about it, but I guess most people are. I got a great idea for you, friend.

Welcome to the ranch, pal! Would you like to see my goats?\n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Don't worry about introductions, I'm already decently aware of this place.

You see, I was a spark! Spontaneously existing out of thin air! A gleaming spark in a silent, dark world begging to be filled! I figured it all out. I knew a lot! I thought for a while and I found out what I wanted to do! So, I shaped myself up, and that's where we are now! \n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** So you're telling me you just started existing? \n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Absolutely partner! \n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** How did you think this happened? \n\n**SCP-5045-1:** Sometimes things just happen, you know? Sometimes you just exist out of thin air and know what you want to do! It's just how my world is, pal!\n\n**Researcher Ivan Cherv:** Fair enough.
