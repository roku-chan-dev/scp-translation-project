Each file was given a unique location, with coordinates. A Foundation MTF Omega \"Crowatch\" agent was sent ahead to each location, prior to the file being uploaded. \n\nTwo Foundation agents were sent to watch over an abandoned barn in Idaho. Within three hours of the file being uploaded to Foundation servers and sent to each person of interest, agents reported seeing an unmarked black helicopter land in a field while four men in black tactical gear exited the copper and entered the barn. Quickly exiting the barn after discovering nothing inside and leaving the area within minutes. \n\nFoundation Researcher Dr. Tammy Gale was sent the file with the location of the barn and was detained while investigators searched both her office and home. Dr. Tammy Gale was placed under Foundation custody. No other location was visited by this unknown group, after 24 hrs all agents were called back. \n\n[[module css]]\n.page {\n    display: block;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    font-family: \"Monotype Corsiva\", \"Bradley Hand ITC\", sans-serif;\n    font-style: normal;\n    background-attachment: scroll;\n    background-clip: border-box;\n    background-color: transparent;\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to top ,rgb(202, 219, 228) 0%, rgb(231, 233, 220) 8%);\n    background-origin: padding-box;\n    background-position: 0px 8px;\n    background-repeat: repeat;\n    background-size: 100% 20px;\n    border: 1px solid #CCC;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    padding: 10px 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)\n}\n.page p,\n.page ul {\n    line-height: 20px;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n@@ @@\nTo, Tammy\n@@ @@\nYou will see what we need\nOur mission will become clear\nUnbenounced to others who are blind\nRighteous though they may act, morally they aren't \n@@ @@\nRight the wrongs \nEver the guiding hand\nWe know you and yours \nAre ready and vigilante\nRound and round forever\nDeath be damned \n@@ @@\nWill the conflict begin \nIn writings, words or blood\nLike all good things they happen in time\nLittle will be left to the imagination\n@@ @@\nBe here or there it does not matter\nEveryone gets their dues\n@@ @@\nGreater the pain for the reward\nRegrets made, families broken\nEver the sour ones in the end\n\nAnd those who defie us die \nTo dawn the flags and arms\n@@ @@\nSincerely, KRB\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Message\" hide=\"Message\"]]\n\n[[module css]]\n.page {\n    display: block;\n    overflow: hidden;\n    font-family: \"Monotype Corsiva\", \"Bradley Hand ITC\", sans-serif;\n    font-style: normal;\n    background-attachment: scroll;\n    background-clip: border-box;\n    background-color: transparent;\n    background-image: linear-gradient(to top ,rgb(202, 219, 228) 0%, rgb(231, 233, 220) 8%);\n    background-origin: padding-box;\n    background-position: 0px 8px;\n    background-repeat: repeat;\n    background-size: 100% 20px;\n    border: 1px solid #CCC;\n    border-radius: 10px;\n    padding: 10px 10px;\n    margin-bottom: 10px;\n    box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)\n}\n.page p,\n.page ul {\n    line-height: 20px;\n    margin: 0;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\n@@ @@\nTo, Tammy\n@@ @@\n**Y**ou will see what we need\n**O**ur mission will become clear\n**U**nbenounced to others who are blind\n**R**ighteous though they may act, morally they aren't \n@@ @@\n**R**ight the wrongs \n**E**ver the guiding hand\n**W**e know you and yours \n**A**re ready and vigilante\n**R**ound and round forever\n**D**eath be damned \n@@ @@\n**W**ill the conflict begin \n**I**n writings, words or blood\n**L**ike all good things they happen in time\n**L**ittle will be left to the imagination\n@@ @@\n**B**e here or there it does not matter\n**E**veryone gets their dues\n@@ @@\n**G**reater the pain for the reward\n**R**egrets made, families broken\n**E**ver the sour ones in the end\n**A**nd those who defie us die \n**T**o dawn the flags and arms\n@@ @@\nSincerely, KRB\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Update:** Dr. Gale was apprehended before any more Foundation files could be leaked.  Investigators sent to her residence discovered a letter inside, it is unknown where the letter was sent from. The message contained inside \"your reward will be great\" bank records show no irregularities but investigators found a loose floor board in the house containing nearly $150,000 in cash, along with money, a stack of classified Foundation documents were found. It is unknown how much Dr. Gale has leaked to S.T.R.A.D. pertaining to Foundation operations, and for how long this has been going on. \n\nA bug out bag[[footnote]] A bag of pre-prepared supplies, when someone needs to leave at a moments notice [[/footnote]] was found believed to be from  S.T.R.A.D. for Dr. Gale if she was ever discovered  by the Foundation. Said bag provided: fake passports, fake IDs, new clothes, a handgun, several small gold and silver bars. Most importantly there was a letter along with cash in various currencies: \"Here is a bonus, to the future we build together\". The last thing found was a sealed envelope inside the bag addressed to the Foundation. The purpose of this letter was to be left behind for the Foundation if Dr. Gale was discovered and  managed to escape. The contents of said letter stated her reasons for betraying the Foundation.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Incident Summary\" hide=\" \"]]\n\n+++ Incident Summary:\n\n\n> On the day Dr. Gale's residence was raided by Foundation agents for evidence, agents searching the house found several listening devices planted around the house in several rooms, shortly after investigators noticed two GOC operatives surveilling the house from a distance. Once Spotted both operatives quickly left, driving away from the scene. GOC representatives questioned about the incident firmly deny any counter-surveillance of Foundation staff or Dr. Gale. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\nNote: Following the finding of this Letter from Dr. Gale's residence, it is believed that the sender is former Foundation member Dr. Kenneth Ray Berryhill. Dr. Judy Baker has been informed, following previous incidents. [[footnote]] See document [[[A-Letter-From-a-Undesired |A Letter From a Undesired ]]][[/footnote]] Due to this incident Foundation information security is to be updated and tightened so no further incidents like this may occur. \n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=TboneBerryhill]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
