Such anomalies can strengthen itself through its presence among public view, and it can be neutralized if the legends are forgotten and lost in public memory. To prevent the objects from being overly powerful or neutralized, the ULAC Department classified the anomalies by their presence rooting within public memory, integrating the related factors into a classification of Spread Level ranging in ascending order of its strength as follows: Seed, Sprout, Sapling, Vine, Tree, Forest. Usually, it is ideal to contain the anomalies with its Spread Level remains between \"Seed\" and \"Sapling\".[[/footnote]]\n----\n**Item #:** SCP-ZH-968\n\n**Object Class:** Ticonderoga\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Currently, there is no containment procedures in place, nor the necessity and feasibility for such procedures. The current measure employed by the Foundation focuses on maintaining the status quo of SCP-ZH-968, implemented by the Ukrainian Branch (\"UA Branch\" as mentioned below) of the Foundation. Active measures against SCP-ZH-968 is limited to concealment of damages caused, and can only be initiated after the end of Russo-Ukrainian War.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ZH-968 designates anomal phenomena with their origin attributed to one MiG-29 Fighter aircraft (Designated \"SCP-ZH-968-UA\"). The range of their activity is inferred to cover the territorial airspace above Kyiv Oblast, Ukraine. However, any attempts to locate the object, or to reveal its true nature and pattern of its movement have failed so far. With collaborated effort of UA Branch and local civilians to conceal military whereabouts, vast majority of aerial loss of the offense had their attributed perpretrator redirected to be SCP-ZH-968-UA in collective cognition within humanity.\n\nAs containment of SCP-ZH-968 inevitably involves alteration of collective cognition of mankind, as well as overthrowing all messages spreaded along with its activity, along with danger to local defensive force and civilians, and possibility to evoke unpredictable reactions from SCP-ZH-968, and therefore leading to infringement against the modus operandi of the Foundation, SCP-ZH-968 has been deemed uncontainable in terms of both feasibility and necessity as a result, and thus assigned to Ticonderoga class.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n##ff5c48|[[size 150%]] **WARNING: Following Section Classified in LEVEL 2** [[/size]]##\n----\n[[size larger]] **Any personnel accessing the following file section without LEVEL 2 Clearance will be recorded and face immediate disciplinary consequences.**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:coltop |show=+ View LEVEL 2 Restricted Section |hide=- Hide LEVEL 2 Restricted Section |ifprot=1]]\n\nThe UA Branch discovered SCP-ZH-968 within [DATA EXPUNGED] hours since State of Full Alert come to effect due to Incident 2022-001 caused by [[[SCP-ZH-223]]]. Researchers in Foundation determined that the appearance of SCP-ZH-968 is causally related to the anomaly of SCP-ZH-223, and therefore delegated the archival duty of SCP-ZH-968 to the Traditional Chinese Branch (\"ZH Branch\" as mentioned below), while the duty of direct monitoring, security and containment remained on the UA Branch.\n\nDuring initial discovery of SCP-ZH-968, the battle loss with their attributed cause redirected are listed as follows:\n* Two Su-35 Fighter aircrafts\n* Two Su-25 Attacker aircrafts\n* One Su-27 Fighter aircraft\n* One MiG-29 Fighter aircraft\nThe aforementioned loss was consistent to that suffered by the Russian Air Force in its first day of Kyiv offensive according to the Ukrainian Command.\n\nSimultaneously, messages about the legend of the \"Ghost of Kyiv\" have been identified in social media platforms due to civilian activity from Ukraine and other countries, with the alleged kills consistent to the loss mentioned above, and determined to be a result of SCP-ZH-968-UA's behaviour.\n\n> As if there was some kind of force spontaneously emerged shortly after the incident caused by ZH-223, and it is fighting against ZH-223's effect in its own manner. Even though its method seems unrelated and indirect, but it seems that it is trying to stop the subsequent disasters, as well as to encourage the people that know of its existence to join the resistance. Since the disaster takes form of war in this case, maybe that's the reason why it chose the form of a fighter aircraft.\n> 　　- Assistant Researcher ███-███ ██████ Lau, Member of SCP-ZH-968 Editorial Team\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n##ff5c48|[[size 150%]] **WARNING: Following Section Classified in LEVEL 3** [[/size]]##\n----\n[[size larger]] **Any personnel accessing the following file section without LEVEL 3 Clearance will be recorded and face immediate disciplinary consequences.**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include component:coltop |show=+ View LEVEL 3 Classified Section |hide=- Hide LEVEL 3 Classified Section |ifprot=1]]\n\nDuring the war between Russia and Ukraine, UA Branch of the Foundation discovered a moving spherical space with low Hume level. SCP-ZH-968-UA was found in the centre of the field during the tracking process. It was also confirmed that the movements of both SCP-ZH-968-UA and the spherical field were identical. The field measured a radius of 3km, consistent to range of the GSh-30-1 Machine gun conventionally equipped on MiG-29 fighter aircrafts. Simultaneously, a spherical space concentric to the aforementioned field with baseline Hume value and a radius of 10m was also confirmed, forming a spherical shell of weak Hume field around SCP-ZH-968-UA with range between 10 and 3000 meters. So far, the retroactive reality bending phenomena were limited to the cause of aircraft damages within the perimeter (See Addendum 1 for information of the only recorded exception). Relevance between this phenomenon and SCP-ZH-223 is still under investigation.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Spherical Weak Hume Field Emission Event:** UA Branch confirmed a spherical weak Hume field with radius of 5m was emitted from the perimeter of low Hume level around SCP-ZH-968-UA [DATA EXPUNGED] days after initial discovery, with its Hume level consistent to that of the weak Hume shell around SCP-ZH-968-UA. The emitted field moved towards Southeast beyond Kyiv Oblast, until collision with a cruise missile launched by Russian Military midair above 12km Southwest of Novomoscovsk, Ukraine. Agents from UA Branch discovered a cone made of depleted uranium in the correspondent location, without any discovered object around said location consistent to any cruise missile components.\n\nThe field agents in Foundation found a piece of paper inside the cone with text written in Ukrainian Language, translated into English as follows:\n\n> [[[wanderers:a-freak-accident-also-a-forced-anchorage|Кєзтел]]]: When I get back to the venue of celebration, turns out there are two dirt mounts with similar size. There is also a wooden bridge between the mounts, spanning at 20 metres long and 2 metres wide, with a wooden tower beneath its centre.

Or even, the whole wooden bridge could be built solely for the ritual.\n> \n> Кєзтел: In the celebration, my colleagues are sharing cakes with the engineering contractors from another company, while chit-chatting with them. I am mistaken for the pilot by the contractors, and I even heard the people around me comparing the pilot with the \"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]Ghost of Kyiv[[span class=\"rt\"]]Привид Києва[[/span]][[/span]]\", the legend popular at this time.\n> \n> Кєзтел: Not taking the rumour seriously, I only expressed my thanks to them, while walking through the celebration.

However, the inscription on the bridge tower was in an unknown language and therefore untranslatable.

Simultaneously, the Russian Branch of the Foundation (\"RU Branch\" as mentioned below) reported similar phenomenon within Russian territory, yet with the pulses most concentrated in gathering places within cities.\n\nFollowing aforementioned discovery, UA and RU Branches received reports of Akiva radiation pulses occuring all over territories within and adjacent to Ukraine and Russia every day, with those of densely populated areas being the most frequent. With consideration of personal safety, the detailed map of the Akiva radiation pulse distribution has been listed as top secret and accessible only to the O5 Council and personnel directly responsible to investigation of the Akiva radiation pulses.\n\nThe Department of Urban Legend Anomaly Countermeasure (\"ULAC Dept.\" as mentioned below) from ZH Branch of the Foundation compared the data from the series of investigations so far, and reached the conclusion that SCP-ZH-968 influence on collective cognition within humanity had a religious nature. Therefore, ULAC Dept. requested for professional opinion from the Department of Tactical Theology as well as professionals of comparative religion, and thus authorized by the Three Enclosures Council to send such request.\n\n> [[span class=\"ruby\"]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Kyiv The Ghost of Kyiv][[span class=\"rt\"]]Привид Києва[[/span]][[/span]], [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FGM-148_Javelin Saint Javelin], and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baykar_Bayraktar_TB2 The Bayraktar].

However, as determined by the Foundation, civilians from Ukraine and other countries would not be able to immediately receive relevant information, thus the causal relationship between appearance of SCP-ZH-968, Akiva radiation pulse phenomenon, and KIA event of Colonel О█████████ is still uncertain.\n\nUpon enquiry of ULAC Dept., the Department of Tactical Theology replied that although SCP-ZH-968 possesses some features of militaristic religion (Colloquially known as \"War deity religion\", \"Military deity religion\" or \"Martial deity religion\"), there are some fundamental differences between the two, in addition to the fact that SCP-ZH-968 had not formed any official doctrines for the believers yet, rendering intervention through tactical theology unfeasible, and the Department could only provide theoretical advice. The two Departments agreed to remain contact along with the monitoring team in UA Branch, in order to keep in touch with any changes in SCP-ZH-968.\n\n> Like all the anomalies we have seen so far, existence of the Ghost of Kyiv lacks solid proof for scrutiny from mainstream science. However, there is another feature that sets the Ghost of Kyiv apart from the vast majority of anomalies: Even if it must be fake, as long as there exists someone believing it was real, or needing that it was real, then it exists.\n> This is the nature of urban legends. Such volatility based on collective cognition of mankind is what the ULAC Department deals with. This is not where tactical theology places its focus on, so it is difficult to solve with tactical theology.\n> 　　- 3E-13\n\n**Addendum 3 - Updates on SCP-ZH-968 Anomalous Activities and Subsequent Countermeasure:** As Russian military was confirmed fully retreated from Kyiv Oblast since 2022/4/2, in addition to lack of observable activities from SCP-ZH-968, the Foundation prepared to tweak the strategy responding to SCP-ZH-968. Therefore, the Foundation collaborated with the Ukrainian Air Force to experiment with anchoring of its urban legends, and adjustments of strategies according to its future activities until when containment deemed feasible. As of the time of writing, object classifications were tentatively remained as originally assigned until conclusion of the war between Ukraine and Russia. See the details in the following updates.\n\n**__Update 2022/3/10:__** UA Branch of the Foundation reached an aggrement with Ukrainian Air Force to deploy Air Force Major Степан Тарабалка for presentation to general public, inheriting the name of \"The Ghost of Kyiv\", in order to serve as an anchor of urban legends associated with SCP-ZH-968, as well as a preparation for SCP-ZH-968 containment experiment after complete retreat of Russian military from Kyiv Oblast.\n\n**__Update 2022/3/13:__** Major Тарабалка, the nominee of \"The Ghost of Kyiv\", was confirmed KIA in airspace above Zhytomyr. Experiment proposal to contain SCP-ZH-968 remained in place.\n\n**__Update 2022/4/2:__** Russia concluded its offensive to Kyiv, and fully retreated from Kyiv Oblast, in order to concentrate its forces for offensive towards Eastern and Southern Ukraine. Frequency of SCP-ZH-968 activity continued to decrease. UA Branch began to establish plans for active containment of SCP-ZH-968.\n\n**__Update 2022/4/8:__** In response to shift of Russian offensive towards Ukraine, general public attention gradually concentrated towards the humanitarian crises all over Ukraine, weakening the spread of SCP-ZH-968. ULAC Dept. started to study the feasibility to adjust the Spread Level Classification for SCP-ZH-968 as an Urban Legend Anomaly. Proposal to change Spread Level of SCP-ZH-968 was withheld since the stability of collective memory of among civilians is still under assessment.\n\n**__Update 2022/4/22:__** The experimental plan to anchor the substance of the urban legend using inheritance of the name of \"The Ghost of Kyiv\" by Major Тарабалка was leaked to public. UA Branch initiated investigation on the leakage and countermeasures required. Said plan was tentatively abandoned.\n\n**__Update 2022/4/30:__** Ukrainian Air Force accepted a back-up proposal from UA Branch of the Foundation, and released a cover story of \"'The Ghost of Kyiv' is a collective symbol of Ukrainian Air Force\" to general public, as an experiment to further weaken the effect of SCP-ZH-968 by anchoring the content of its urban legend. ULAC Dept. continued monitoring of reaction from SCP-ZH-968 and urban legends associated with the object, and prepared to adjust its classification accordingly.\n\n**__Update 2022/5/9:__** Since 2022/5/1, the Foundation detected no activities nor reality bending effects from SCP-ZH-968-UA. However, the Akiva radiation pulse phenomenon in Ukraine and its neighbouring countries remained ongoing and gradually spread to the whole world. Upon meetings of the monitoring team, the Foundation passed a resolution in 2022/5/9 to reassign SCP-ZH-968 into [[span class=\"ruby\"]]Nagi[[span class=\"rt\"]]凪[[/span]][[/span]][[footnote]]An esoteric object class firstly established in the Japanese Branch. Applies to objects losing anomalous and dangerous features along a prolonged time for any reason. The containment procedures would remain in place, and the object class will be subject to appropriate reassignment should any sign of anomal activities occurs.[[/footnote]] and archive the files related after conclusion of war between Ukraine and Russia, with ULAC Dept. agreed to adjust Spread Level of the object afterwards.\n\n**__Update 2022/6/25:__** A self-hit incident occured in a Russian surface-to-air missile system deployed in Alchevsk, Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. UA Branch of the Foundation identified a weak Hume field identical to that of SCP-ZH-968 left outside Kyiv Oblast for the second time, heading to the place of aforementioned incident and disappeared after the incident. The Foundation failed to locate SCP-ZH-968-UA. The plan to reassign SCP-ZH-968 into Nagi after conclusion of war remained in place.\n\n**__Update 20██/█/██:__** UA Branch of the Foundation retrieved the body of a personnel KIA from Azovstal iron and steel works, Mariupol. The personnel was given funeral of the highest order. The funeral procedures were taken charge of by А.Д., the Head of the External Relations Division in Site-██[[footnote]]A site located in Kyiv, with its designation occulted by antimeme.[[/footnote]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-zh-tr:component:colend |nohide=1]]\n[[include :scp-zh-tr:component:colend |nohide=1]]\n[[include :scp-zh-tr:component:colend |nohide=1]]\n[[include :scp-zh-tr:component:colend |nohide=1]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n[Jamcon Trilogy \"As the 'Ghost of Kyiv' emerges\"]\n<< [[[wanderers:a-freak-accident-also-a-forced-anchorage|A Freak Accident/Forced Anchorage]]] | [[[SCP-ZH-385]]] | SCP-ZH-968 >>\n[SCP-ZH Series I]\n<< [[[SCP-ZH-967]]] | SCP-ZH-968 | [[[SCP-ZH-969]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Edward Knave]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
