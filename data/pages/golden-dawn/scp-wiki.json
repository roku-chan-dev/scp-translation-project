There are only so many bastard-filled ways to die, so many righteous punishments to undergo, so much limit to abuse, that it soon becomes nothing more than a fleeting blip. Only the one in charge of Hell can keep up with that kind of track record, and the [[[scp-3999|One]]] overseeing it now has lost Its touch.\n\nBecause the only one who can keep that luster alive is the self, and Talloran has better ways to spend their time.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[span style=\"color:white\"]]Because who would want to keep waxing on about torture? Certainly nobody with a healthy conscience.[[/span]]\n\n------\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 80%]]\n//January 3, 2017//\n[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\nTwo people curled up to each other in bed. They were more than lovers; they were cosmological bastions of safety for each other. Researcher James Talloran and Agent [[[portraits-of-your-father|Draven Kondraki]]] have a moment's worth of peace in between their hectic schedules. Half-asleep, and the only things of interest are the snow outside illuminated by the balcony lights, and each other.\n\nTalloran feels Draven's heart rise and fall. It's obvious what this means, having been together for this long now.\n\n\"The transition to Site-118 won't be that bad for me. I'll be focusing almost exclusively on Keter objects, but staff know what they'll be assigning me to. I won't be at risk.\"\n\n\"You just won't be around here any longer.\" Draven kisses Talloran's neck, a reaffirmation of grounding.\n\n\"Yeah. I'll video call every day.\"\n\n\"What if your schedule is too different?\"\n\n\"Site-17 isn't that far away from where I'm going, you know. Even if it is, it's not like either of us sleep much anymore.\"\n\n\"It's only been a month since we moved into this apartment anyway. I'll miss you.\"\n\n\"I'll miss it too, Draven, hon.\"\n\n\"Mmhmm. Who's going with you?\" He was curious to know; he knew there were some reassignments, but to Site-118 in particular was odd. It seemed well-staffed enough.\n\n\"You remember Dr. Yamada, right? She's coming with me... I guess to look over me. Glass won't see me anymore, but I'll be seeing someone there. I can stay sane enough.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Neck kiss.\n\nThey stayed quiet for another half-hour. The songs snow made when it fell rivaled that of any musician, and its existence made the season more colorful for them. Lingering silence never bothered either one of them in each other's presence, nor any of their characteristics and mental traits that made others such a pain in the ass to deal with. They weren't pure, but all they needed to be was transparent.\n\nTalloran turned around, facing Draven now. The both of them were exhausted, but Talloran... they were borderline asleep. Even through half-opened eyes, Draven... he was cute. There's so much love to give and so much space for that love and so little time to love and it kind of hurt to not be able to keep giving that love as much as they wanted to. In the grand scheme of things though, 95km would ultimately not be as devastating as it otherwise could be. The Foundation, as draining as it was, at least made sure to give some consideration to Draven's family.\n\n\"I'm still not sure about a first name, hon. James doesn't quite fit me, I think.\" Mumble mumble.\n\n\"Too attached to your old self, or something or other.\" Mumble.\n\n\"What do you think about Jasper?\" they questioned.\n\n\"Joyce.\"\n\n\"Jaden.\"\n\n\"James. No wait, that's already your name.\" In response to Draven's mistake, Talloran tried opening their eyes and exaggerating a disappointed look. //giggle//, then they both shared in the laughter. \"Jules? Why stick to J anyhow. Go big, go bold. Avery.\"\n\n\"Alex.\"\n\n\"Erin, with an E.\"\n\n\"Jules, Aiden, Blake, Ari, Devin, E... Eli, Kai. Gr...ey... S... ky......lar......... J............\" Talloran drifted off to sleep.\n\n//snore//\n\nDraven smiled and got out of bed. Tired as he was, there was still some stuff he had to take care of before his boyfriend transferred sites in a couple days. He could no longer afford to be put off by the minutiae of day-to-day work. There was business to take care of.\n\nHe wandered the apartment, one inherited from his deceased father, stumbling in the dark. Being tired and still unfamiliar with a new place wasn't the best option. When every step forward was also for confronting a trauma still being processed, things were even harder. Luckily for him, he had the tenacity of an angry, hungry dog, so minor issues like \"adjusting to dark rooms\" and \"avoiding bumping into objects\" were no problem in any capacity.\n\nThat is, until he stubbed his toe with full force onto a metal plate.\n\n\"G-gah, fu--\" He slapped his hand over his mouth, trying not to yell and wake up Talloran. It hurt like a motherfucker. Though once he turned the corner in an attempt to find the bathroom, he managed to stumble across it. The door had a single nameplate on it.\n\n[[=]]\n> //{{Doctor Benjamin Kondraki}}//\n[[/=]]\n\nCalling him a doctor was always overstating it, and maybe he didn't fully deserve the honor of being a Foundation employee at times. But he did. He absolutely did. He was as good of a father as any, and more importantly, he was //his// father.\n\nDraven entered the room, and his heart stopped for a brief second. In a way, it almost resembled his father's old office. It was still being unpacked, and shit was strewn all over the floor. That was fine. The desk was positioned in front of the window, the way his father typically liked working. The moonlight was potent tonight, and shone right onto the dilapidated chair. For a brief moment, he could have sworn he saw his father there, looking down at some documents with bourbon on the desk, before looking back up at his son and smiling.\n\nHe blinked.\n\nHis father left. Only the bourbon remained.\n\nDraven knew where he could find the thing he needed to give to Talloran the most in the mess of a room. He needed to keep it a secret, after all. His father's desk had a drawer, which contained a manila envelope. And there it was, same location as he put it in. No tampering either. At least his boyfriend didn't find it.\n\nIt was still weird to Draven that his father left this behind for them. It wasn't even found until the move to the new apartment. His father was mysterious in ways that don't befit the adjective, but this was maybe the most strange. Talloran thought a lot of his dad despite his issues, because the two of them got along together well (or rather, well enough), because Ben was his dad and even because there was some level of understanding underneath it all. But the fact that he thought of Talloran in the same way at all, enough to leave this behind, was odd. At least he was considerate.\n\nClosing the door and choking down sobs again, Draven made his way back to the bedroom with one less toe stub this time. It'd be sort of pathetic to wake his boyfriend up crying over recent events again, but they would understand, surely.\n\n\"Night, bun.\" Draven kisses their forehead and holds onto them, falling into sleep soon after.\n\nAt least they'll always have each other.\n\n------\n\n[[size 90%]]\n[[=]]\n//Year 1,996,437//\n[[/=]]\n[[/size]]\n\n\"Why is it that you keep pushing on?\"\n\n//I'm still not sure myself.//\n\n\"Tell me.
