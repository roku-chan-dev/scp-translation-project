I'm not satisfied with it.\n\nA: Absolutely. You will always have that option at any point.\n\n++* Q: I noticed an error/typo/incorrect information and wish to correct it. May I?\n\nA: Sure! If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.\n\n++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?\n\nA: Yup! It's much easier if you come to us about it, and it gives you the control over what you want shown on the news page.\n----\n\n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[news-08-2020|August 2020]]] | __[[[news-09-2020|September 2020]]]__ | [[[news-10-2020|October 2020]]] »**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n----",
