Residual moisture is to be removed with a second unused dry cloth.\n\nEvery 28 days, or immediately following the start of an SCP-7214-01 Event, SCP-7214 must undergo a complete inspection for any sign of stains, abrasions, warping, mildew, rust, infestation, or any other damage or blemishes. All wear and damage must be repaired immediately, and additional wax or polish applied as needed. \n\nRoutine maintenance has been shown to reduce, but not fully prevent, the occurrence of SCP-7214-01 events. Maintenance beyond the regular intervals prescribed in this document is not advised, as damage sustained from excessive cleaning has also been shown to trigger SCP-7214-01 events.\n\n++* Description\n\nSCP-7214 is an 18th century oak armoire, consisting of one interior chamber with cabinet doors set above two sliding drawers. Each cabinet door is connected to the body of the armoire by two sets of steel hinges, and is ornamented by decorative ironwork. SCP-7214 measures 196 cm x 152 cm x 90 cm, and weighs 150 kg.\n\nDuring periods of prolonged disuse, neglect, or damage, SCP-7214 begins to produce a number of anomalous environmental effects, collectively described as an SCP-7214-01 event. These effects have remained limited to a 200 m radius since current containment procedures were implemented.  \n\nObserved effects include:\n\n* Production of diffuse metallic screeching sounds at volumes of up to 30 dB\n* Malfunctioning of electronic equipment.\n* Tremors and vibrations felt in furniture and small objects.\n* A foul smell resembling that of decaying organic matter.\n* Feelings of headache, nausea, confusion, and fatigue in individuals within the area of effect.\n\nAfter appropriate containment intervention has taken place, most effects dissipate within 4 to 6 hours. In some instances, lingering effects have been observed for up to 7 days. Individuals exposed to an SCP-7214-01 event have reported feelings of dread, anxiety and depression during this cool down period. No additional effects or lasting harm resulting from multiple exposures have been observed.\n\n//The above documentation has been certified by Dr. Lorenzo Ventnor, Chief Administrator of the Department of Paracarpentry and Domestic Anomalies.//\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab SCP-7214 Certified 19 May 2009]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 7214\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= safe\n|secondary-class= none\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= danger\n]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://live.staticflickr.com/7303/26635166454_ee6d68ecce_b.jpg|caption=SCP-7214 at site of discovery, prior to restoration.|width=280px]]\n\n++* Special Containment Procedures\n\nSCP-7214 is to be contained in a 40,000 m^^2^^ annex adjacent to Site-277, along with SCP-7214-A. Additional intervention by Foundation personnel is not required, as SCP-7214-A obsessively performs routine maintenance.\n\n++* Description\n\nSCP-7214 is an 18th century oak armoire, consisting of one interior chamber with cabinet doors set above two sliding drawers. Each cabinet door is connected to the body of the armoire by two sets of steel hinges, and is ornamented by decorative ironwork. SCP-7214 measures 196 cm x 152 cm x 90 cm, and weighs 150 kg.\n\nDuring periods of prolonged disuse, neglect, or damage, SCP-7214 produces a number of anomalous environmental effects, including auditory and olfactory disturbances, tremors, and malfunctioning of electronics, collectively described as an SCP-7214-01 event. Repeated exposure to SCP-7214-01 events has been shown to cause irreparable psychological harm to humans. Symptoms of prolonged exposure include generalized apathy, listlessness, irritability, lessening of empathy, inability to perform essential duties of self-care, and sociopathy. Individuals suffering from symptoms of prolonged exposure to SCP-7214 represent a threat to public safety, and Foundation personnel are authorized to take all necessary steps to prevent them from harming the public or themselves.\n\nSCP-7214-A is a 62 year old human male. He is to remain in containment for the duration of his retirement.\n\n//The above documentation has been certified by Dr. Melissa Woodridge, Chief Administrator of the Department of Paracarpentry and Domestic Anomalies.//\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n-----\n+ Site-277\n-----\n+++ THE FOLLOWING DOCUMENTATION IS INCLUDED FOR REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY.

Disruption levels are pretty much flat across the site. At least, nothing that can't be explained by the variations we normally see during the course of an event.\n\nJean performed the graphic spectral analysis you asked for and from what he showed me his results were no better. No concentrations of effects in any one area, and no empty pockets, either. Quantum readings were just as useless.\n\nI don't know if it even makes sense to file this, since it's a lot of work to tell us what we already knew. It's not proximity based, it's a blanket effect. At least, if there's any way to modify or shape its area of effect, we don't have it. \n\nIt was worth a try, but it doesn't look like there would be any point in relocating your office.\n\n– Melissa\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n**Statement on Budgetary Proposal D0157-006065-G**\n\n12 January, 2006\n\nThe Department of Paracarpentry and Domestic Anomalies' request for funding for expanded interdepartmental research into containment of SCP-7214 is hereby DENIED.\n\nAlthough SCP-7214 has been shown to possess properties that may at times transcend its containment area, these properties have always been localized to a limited and predictable area of effect. Furthermore, adequate methods to combat these effects have been identified and implemented. Beyond this, SCP-7214 is itself virtually incapable of breaching containment, as it is an inanimate object weighing 150 kg.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Budgetary Commission that SCP-7214 does not present a level of risk that merits special funding for further investigation. It would be inadvisable to divert resources from more essential departments to address an anomaly that has already been effectively contained.\n\nOffice of the Budgetary Commission\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n**Incident Report 277-006-00002**\n\n//The following incident report is compiled from a review of all pertinent video footage and direct interviews with involved personnel.//\n\nOn 15 February, 2006, at 13:05, D-Class personnel D-18752 sustained a workplace injury (Type C-107.05: liquification, other) in the performance of his routine duties. Reasonable attempts at resuscitation were made but were unsuccessful, and the personnel succumbed to his injuries.\n\nWhile attempting to inspect for signs of possible termite infestation during an SCP-7214-01 event, D-18752 entered the main chamber of SCP-7214, allowing both doors to close behind him. Following closure of the doors, D-18752 could be heard vocalizing distress from inside the chamber, followed by pounding sounds from within. After 45 seconds, vocalizations became muffled as a thick, white, odorless steam began to rise from SCP-7214, and a viscous pink substance began to pour from its lower drawers to the floor of its containment chamber. Emergency personnel arrived approximately 5 minutes from the start of the incident, and opened the main chamber of SCP-7214 to find only D-18752's Foundation-issued uniform and three gold teeth, coated in the previously noted pink slime. The continued non-localized sound of muffled vocalizations continued for 45 minutes following the incident. The interior of SCP-7214 showed no signs of harm.\n\nAs the ongoing SCP-7214-01 event ended at the conclusion of this incident, further maintenance procedures were not attempted. Special cleaning of SCP-7214's chamber was completed without incident. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n++++* Addendum A-7214.01\n\nEffective 20 February, 2006:\n\nAll maintenance and cleaning procedures are to be performed with no fewer than two personnel in SCP-7214's containment chamber at once.\n\nIf internal maintenance is performed, one door must be manually held open by a second individual standing on the exterior of SCP-7214 at all times.\n\nIf any human is fully sealed inside the main chamber of SCP-7214, SCP-7214 may spontaneously convert the individual inside to liquid form, by a process categorized as an SCP-7214-02 event. No method by which to interrupt or reverse an SCP-7214-02 event has been identified. \n\nSCP-7214’s risk class is updated to “Danger” pending further study.\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Email correspondence archived 27 April, 2006 10:53\" hide=\"- Exit\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** DR.

It's not going to be long before someone higher up than me notices how you've been timing your sick days.\n\nQuarterly departmental reviews start Thursday, and I can't find where you've put most of the testing logs from the past three months. It looks like half of the files were never digitized, and a good chunk of the ones that were have been misclassified, so we're going to have to redo everything from the ground up.\n\nYou might not be planning to be here much longer, but if I'm going to be taking over when you're gone, I need this department to still be functional. I don't care what the rest of them say, we do good work here, and it's work that needs to be done. I don't know how important it is to you anymore, but when I'm the one running it I'd like it to be a department I can still be proud of. So many other departments think we're a waste of space. Don't prove them right.\n\n– Melissa\n\nBy the way, the SCP-7214-01 event started winding down this morning.

However, SCP-7214's disruptive effects do not create any challenges to effective containment, nor do they introduce any demonstrable risk of containment breach. Though unpleasant, they pose minimal threat of lasting physical or mental harm to Foundation personnel. As Site-277 has functioned and contained SCP-7214 successfully up to this point, there is no indication that site productivity will increase if containment facilities are expanded.\n\nFurthermore, given the relatively low importance of Site-277 to broader Foundation operations, and the narrow sphere of relevance of the Department of Paracarpentry and Domestic Anomalies, it would be irresponsible to make significant infrastructure investments at this time. Current Foundation priorities do not leave room for constructing a 40,000 m^^2^^ annex to Site-277 just to contain a wardrobe.\n\nOffice of the Budgetary Commission\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n**Incident Report 277-006-00003**\n\n//The following incident report is compiled from a review of all pertinent video footage and direct interviews with involved personnel.//\n\nOn 17 November, 2006, at 11:40, D-Class personnel D-18902 sustained a workplace injury (Type C-107.05: liquification, other) in the performance of her routine duties.

These requests have been DISMISSED, and will not receive further review.\n\nPlease recognize that though working in close proximity to SCP-7214 may be a nuisance to you and your staff, it does not constitute a threat worthy of further intervention.\n\nThere is a hierarchy of priority at the Foundation. Though we value the work you do at Site-277, and appreciate your high rate of successful containment, we must allocate resources according to need, and invest in safety measures according to risk. Until you have demonstrated that any objects covered under your department require more than mundane maintenance, observation, storage and inspection, please do not submit any further proposals for special funding. Your department's budget has been set, and will be limited to basic operational equipment and personnel needs.\n\nIf you continue to file frivolous requests, you will be recommended for disciplinary action.\n\nSpeaking frankly, Dr. Ventnor, other departments are developing ways to mitigate existential threats to humanity, unlock the mysteries of the cosmos, and preserve the fabric of reality itself. Your department operates a furniture warehouse. If you don't like being around the effects of SCP-7214, find a better way to contain them.\n\n\nEileen Banner\n\nOffice of the Budgetary Commission\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Email correspondence archived 5 March, 2007 14:22\"|hide=\"- Exit\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** DR.

Budgetary Commission into Examining the Misuse of Foundation Resources at Site-277, 17 November, 2008**\n\n//Testimony of Dr. Lorenzo Ventnor, Chief Administrator, Department of Paracarpentry and Domestic Anomalies//\n\n**Speaker of the Office of the Budgetary Commission**\n\nBefore we begin, I would like to remind you that the purpose of this hearing is not to determine your guilt or innocence regarding the actions we're investigating. We're only seeking to understand what happened, so we can identify the causes of the issues at hand, and better address them moving forward. This is not a disciplinary hearing: the Budgetary Commission has no authority to discipline Foundation staff members. This is just an audit. Is this understood?\n\n**Dr. Lorenzo Ventnor**\n\nUnderstood.\n\n**Speaker**\n\nExcellent; we can begin. So, Dr. Ventnor, can you please explain, to the best of your ability, what's wrong with you?\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nWhat do you–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nYou had one year to run your department without direct oversight of routine expenses. That's not an outrageous thing to ask. In fact, being able to manage a simple budget is entirely within the expected skill set of a department head. One year. Do you know how many personnel you cost the Foundation during that period?\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nI can estimate–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nYou don't need to estimate. We know. We all know. The fact that you don't know is mortifying, if not unsurprising. Are you a child?\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nI don't see how–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nBecause a living, breathing functioning adult must have at least a shred of self-reflection, duty or restraint, all qualities which appear to be alien to you.\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nIf I could–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nThe resources of the Foundation are vast, Dr. Ventnor, but not limitless. More importantly, our resources do not exceed our costs: the Foundation has access to as much funding as it does because every penny is necessary for it to serve its purpose. Do you understand?\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nI think I–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nThe Commission cannot stress strongly enough that no Foundation staff member is of negligible value. Do you have any idea how many hours of recruiting, vetting, orientation and training goes into onboarding even a single Domestic-Class staff member? Do you have any concept of how many people the Foundation employs, with full salaries and benefits, just to perform those duties? Are all of those resources worth nothing to you?\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nThe other departments–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nThe actions of other departments will be assessed according to their needs. This hearing isn't an audit of other departments. It's an audit of your department. The furniture department. There is no doubt that at some times, in some departments, some sacrifices must be made, but this Commission fails to see how a sacrifice of over 500 human lives is necessary to keep a wardrobe secure.\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nI may have–\n\n**Speaker**\n\nHuman lives aren't free, Dr. Ventnor. They're not breadcrumbs to be thrown to the ducks, or pennies to be tossed down a wishing well. They're costly, fragile, and essential to the Foundation's operation. At this point in your career you may be more concerned with your pension than your department, but the resources you've squandered are worth more than your pension a dozen times over. Bearing this in mind, do you have anything to say in your defense?\n\n**Deputy Secretary**\n\nMadam Speaker, your time has elapsed.\n\n**Speaker**\n\nVery well, this hearing is adjourned. We'll pick up after lunch with the inquest into irregular overtime pay at Site-98.\n\n**Dr. Ventnor**\n\nDo I at least-\n\n**Speaker**\n\nThis may come as a surprise to you, Dr. Ventnor, but the Commission has responsibilities that extend far beyond sitting here listening to you make excuses. If you have anything else to say, you may submit it in writing. This hearing is adjourned.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n**Re: Budgetary Proposal D0157-007122-F**\n\n19 December, 2008\n\nDr. Woodridge,\n\nYour budgetary proposal for special infrastructure projects at Site-277 has been provisionally APPROVED, pending reclassification of SCP-7214. \n\nPlease keep careful documentation of all costs and expenditures, as they will be reviewed monthly until all projects are completed.\n\nEileen Brenner,\n\nOffice of the Budgetary Commission\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/==]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7213]]] | SCP-7214 | [[[SCP-7215]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 26635166454_ee6d68ecce_b.jpg\n> **Author:** Thomas Quine\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/quinet/26635166454/\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
