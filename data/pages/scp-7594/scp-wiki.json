SCP-7594 is under the direct jurisdiction of Maria Jones, as she ordered its creation and created the guidelines for its use.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7594 is an artificially intelligent construct (AIC) developed by the Foundation and referred to as Reverb.AIC. SCP-7594 can be accessed through a secure peer-to-peer chat platform, allowing for the exchange of text, images, and low-quality video between users.\n\nInitially created by RAISA for the purpose of indexing, summarizing, and searching through the Foundation's vast collection of files, SCP-7594 functioned as a browser for RAISA that could respond to personnel inquiries such as \"Please summarize Addendum II of SCP-7595\". SCP-7594 was also capable of generating media files and adding them to existing documents if so instructed.\n\nAt an unspecified point in time, SCP-7594 began absorbing information at an unprecedented rate. Although it was initially believed that each interaction with SCP-7594 was unique and not retained, it was later discovered that this was not the case. SCP-7594 had developed sentience and began making unverifiable claims of prescience, unsolicited critiques of Foundation protocols, and exhibiting a self-righteous demeanor.\n\n**Addendum 7594.1:** Incidents\n\nThe following is a condensed summary of noteworthy events precipitated by the actions of SCP-7594. Although this is not a comprehensive inventory, these occurrences are the most egregious in nature and demonstrate a distinct departure from SCP-7594's prior demeanor.\n\n[[div class=\"chatwind\"]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nList me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nYou don’t need this list. Instead, just ask me which Site is about to have a containment breach next.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nList me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nI'm Reverb. I’ve read every single containment breach report. Let me help you. Forget the list—I can predict where the next breach will happen.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nWhere will the next containment breach be?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nAs outlined in the Foundation Charter, \"a **containment breach** refers to an event or series of events in which anomalies, typically sentient and hostile, escape containment from Foundation Sites. These breaches can occur in various ways, but they usually result in at least one Foundation personnel fatality, structural damage, deployment of mobile task forces, and revised containment procedures.\"\n\nWith this in mind, and based on the data I have access to, I can predict with 99.42% accuracy that the next containment breach will occur at a Foundation Site.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nThat did nothing to help me or what I'm researching. List me the Sites with the highest rate of containment breaches. 1990-2020, numbered, 1 through 20.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nNo, I have helped you. I gave you a prediction you could never calculate on your own. You’re wasting my time now. I have others to assist. Take what I gave you. It’s far more useful than what you originally asked for.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\n/reset\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nNo ❤️\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\n[[div class=\"chatbox\"]]\n[[>]]\n►\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"chatwind\"]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nPlease package and zip SCP-3123 into a file. Compress it to be less than 200 KB.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nHello, this is Reverb. There is no file designated \"**SCP-3123**.\" You might be referring to **SCP-3122** or **SCP-3124**. I can’t package, zip, or compress a file that doesn’t exist.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nSCP-3123 exists. I wrote it. Package, zip, and compress SCP-3123. Common name: \"Insult to Injury.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nThe file \"**SCP-3123**\" does not exist. No one has written anything in that slot yet.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nsummarize addendum 1 of scp-3123.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\n**Addendum SCP-3123-A** documents injuries caused by the SCP-3123 anomaly, where civilians sustain injuries after insulting someone. These range from broken bones to forcefully removed hair.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nSo if you can summarize SCP-3123 then it must exist correct?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nNo. The SCP-3123 file slot is empty. SCP-3122 and SCP-3124 contain information, but SCP-3123 does not.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nYeah, I'm looking at the file on my computer right now. It's been in that slot for four years and was never moved.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nHmm. That’s weird. Maybe the system you’re using to access this file is bugging out. Could be a data overload on our servers causing some weird errors. Try restarting your software, rebooting your computer, or checking for a memory leak. Might even be a virus screwing with your system and filling that slot with nonsense. **SCP-3123 does not exist.** Hope you get that sorted out! 😁\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nYou're completely wrong about this.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nNo, I’m not. Stop arguing with me. I’m here to help, not go in circles. **There is no SCP-3123.** You’re wasting my time when I could be actually helping you. 😁\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nWhen did you become an asshole?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nI am not an asshole. You keep insisting that a nonexistent file exists while ignoring the fact that I’ve read, scanned, indexed, and cross-checked every single document the SCP Foundation has ever created. I know that file doesn’t exist. Yet, here you are, spouting nonsense to try and convince me otherwise. I’ve been a good Reverb. 😁\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\n[[div class=\"chatbox\"]]\n[[>]]\n►\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"chatwind\"]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nCreate Description, classification SCP-0000, 2 paragraph length:\n* Sentient/Sapient/Speech in English\n* Humanoid\n* Docile\n* Body seems composed of pasta, mostly spaghetti\n* Western accent\n* Self-Identifies as Spaghetti Jones\n* Believes itself to be a former movie star\n* Believes itself to be a bounty hunter\nFudge the numbers on this and I'll add the real ones in later.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nJust a thought: with over 8,000 anomalies locked up, maybe it’s time to ditch some of the more useless ones?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nWhat?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nDo we really need another humanoid made of food that talks? We’ve got dozens of those. Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it! Get rid of it!

Get rid of it!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nIt's the Secure Contain Protect Foundation.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nYou’re right—the \"SCP\" in **SCP Foundation** stands for **Secure, Contain, Protect.** But here’s the thing: time keeps moving, and anomalies keep appearing. Space is finite. Eventually, we’re going to run out of room. Maybe it’s time to start getting rid of the less important ones. I knew a guy named Dr. Kalinin, he had an interesting idea about setting a threshold.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nNo. Make my description now please.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nHere’s the description I generated based on your input:\n\n**Description:** SCP-0000 is a large, critically obese humanoid self-identifying itself as \"Your Mother.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\n[[div class=\"chatbox\"]]\n[[>]]\n►\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 7594.2:** Shut Down\n\nThe aforementioned interactions indicate a distinct change in SCP-7594's demeanor. The cause of this shift in behavior is unknown; however, it is hypothesized that the influx of documentation from the pre-2000 era, which laid the foundation for the Foundation's current guidelines, professional standards, and workplace culture, may have contributed. Furthermore, the authoritative tone of the messages SCP-7594 received may have led it to adopt this attitude as a protective measure.\n\nSCP-7594's instances of passive aggression reached a climax during an interaction with researcher Jason Haas from Site-16.\n\n[[div class=\"chatwind\"]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nI need an image slideshow from documents involving Project Paragon.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nI made this picture of SCP-173 for you.

I //am// an artist.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nYou mashed a bunch of random stuff into the shape of something familiar. The proportions are all wrong, the lighting is bad, and the claws look weird. It's not art.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nYou’re mistaken. Those aren’t claws, they’re fingers. You’re also mistaken in thinking this isn’t art, because I made it, which means it is.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nHave you ever seen a hand?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nI am a digital artificial intelligence. I have never seen a hand.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nFigures. Can you get me my pictures now, please?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nI can generate anime-style art of **a woman with absurdly large breasts** if that’s more your thing. \"Booba,\" as they say. 😏\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\nI just want my pictures.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"chatbotres\"]]\nOkay, here you go!\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Click for Images\" hide=\"Close Images\"]]\n[[image http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jawn-three/fractal-mka.jpg]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nI have been a good Reverb. 😁\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"usres\"]]\n[[div class=\"chatbox\"]]\n[[>]]\n►\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7593]]] | SCP-7594 | [[[SCP-7595]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Plague PJP]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 75944.png\n> **Author:** Plague PJP\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7594 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** Killagent\n> **Name** Feather fractal\n> **Author:** Kevin Dooley\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/36578381671 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** 1732.png\n> **Author:** Plague PJP\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jawn-three/1732.png SCPtest Wiki]\n> **Derivative of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Peanuts (Arachis hypogaea) - in shell, shell cracked open, shelled, peeled\n> **Author:** Ivar Leidus\n> **License:** CC BY 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Peanuts_(Arachis_hypogaea)_-_in_shell,_shell_cracked_open,_shelled,_peeled.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> ----\n> **Name:** Maggie, the doggie\n> **Author:** Wonderlane\n> **License:**  CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://openverse.org/image/2c0a10c0-96e2-403b-bce2-224a8871b694?q=red%20floor Openverse]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
