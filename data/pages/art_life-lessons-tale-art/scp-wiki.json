Every opportunity it has, it takes. Please go read it. For now, I hope you like the art!   \n> And of course, my dumb boring author page is here [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-vikki-lost if you want to meet me outside your window at 3 am tonight, holding the weapon that brings your demise to reality!] \n>  \n> And as always - thanks. Have a wonderful day.",
