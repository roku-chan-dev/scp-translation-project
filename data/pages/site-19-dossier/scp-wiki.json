The Foundation has thirteen permanent employees involved in various parts of cleaning operations, logistics, maintenance, and management.[[footnote]]See \"Staffing.\"[[/footnote]] The building itself is mundane and possesses no unusual properties.\n\nThe FBI's Unusual Incidents Unit currently has a contract employing the SCP Foundation to handle extended storage and disposal of possibly anomalous items, and allows them to retain possession of such items they may recover during their operations. As of September of 2007, Site 19 stores four (potentially five) confirmed anomalies. Given the Foundation's small size and low item count, it is likely that the UIU is the Foundation's only long-term contract.\n\n[[=]]\n-----\n+ Staffing\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\nOf the Foundation's thirteen employees, background checks have been performed on six.\n\n**Fritz Diedrich Williams:** Male, German-American, early 30s. Administrator of the SCP Foundation. Typically clad in a bowler fedora and business casual wear, and has a habit of smoking. Primary contact between the Foundation and the UIU; all contract revisions should be forwarded to Williams. Role played in the Foundation is largely oversight, with next-to-no field work. Being the primary individual responsible for the Foundation, Williams is the most knowledgeable about the anomalous.  \n\n**Tilda David Moose:** Non-binary, white, early 30s. Director of Site 19, and Williams’ second-in-command-- can generally be relied upon to answer phone calls and emails while Williams is unavailable. Responsible for the finances and maintenance of Site 19, as well as oversight of cleanup operations.\n\n**“Dr. Alto Clef”:** Male, East Asian-American, approximately mid 30s. Legal name and background unknown, but likely born in Britain. Field agent for the Foundation, easily distinguished by a brimmed hat and a Hawaiian t-shirt. Often carries a crowbar; reason for this is unknown. Generally abrasive and rude to UIU personnel. Tends to spread disinformation (possibly at Williams’ behest), almost compulsively so.\n\n**Charles Ogden Gears:** Male, white, late 40s. Accountant and HMCL[[footnote]]\"Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison.\"[[/footnote]] supervisor at Site 19. Typically unemotional and level-headed, especially in comparison to those around him. Files most of the paperwork for the Foundation.\n\n**Dee C. Lass:** Non-binary, unknown ethnicity, early 20s. Intern frequently seen on Foundation cleanup jobs. Dark hair, typically wears an orange hoodie and jeans. Despite a low rank, they are intimately familiar with numerous Foundation items due to their field experience.\n\n**Maria Jones:** Female, Black, late 20s. Site 19’s only IT worker, believed to play a fairly important role within the Foundation, though not much else is known about her. Typically appears disheveled and is often intoxicated.\n\nFurther information on Foundation employees is currently classified or is otherwise unavailable.\n\n[[=]]\n-----\n+ Layout\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=site19_floor_map.png\n|caption=Site 19 floor plan.\n|width=100%\n|align=center]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:;left; width: 12em; padding: 0 1em; margin: 1em 0 1em 1em; border-left: solid #888888 1px; background-color: #000000;\"]]\n++ Key\n1.

Storage unit contains a number of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/welcome-to-site-19 trivial items]. Closet is empty. Records need review. Containment wing contains items [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/biweekly \"SCP-173\"], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lake-oahe-monster \"SCP-682\"], and two locked rooms.[[footnote]]Presumed empty, though this cannot be confirmed.[[/footnote]] Break room contains item \"SCP-294\".[[footnote]]Under no circumstances is the prompt \"SURPRISE ME\" to be entered into the coffee machine.[[/footnote]] Additionally, \"SCP-999\" can often be seen roaming the hallways. Administrator's office contains item \"SCP-001\", likely non-anomalous. Numbers of SCP items are presumed arbitrary, as no coherent explanation could be provided by staff when questioned.\n\n[[=]]\n-----\n+ Bureau Records\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n++ History\n\nSite 19 was constructed in 1987 by an unknown real estate company, whereupon it was sold to Prometheus Labs Inc. Six years later, due to significant monetary losses, Prometheus Labs was forced to liquidate the facility and sold it to Scranton Realty in 1993. Despite numerous attempts by Robert Scranton to sell the building, it went unused for twelve years,  likely due to local rumors that the facility was \"haunted.\"[[footnote]]A possible connection to Prometheus Labs' paranormal activities, though this cannot be confirmed as the company has been unresponsive since 2001; its records are pending recovery.[[/footnote]] Site 19 was finally sold to Fritz Williams, Foundation Administrator, in 2003.\n\nCurrent intel reveals that the reason for the facility's abandonment is likely due to item “SCP-173,”[[footnote]]Currently possessed by the Foundation, as part of their contract with the Unusual Incidents Unit.[[/footnote]] which was contained in a shipping container at Site 19 since at least 1993.[[footnote]]Origin is as of yet unknown. Investigation is currently not possible, as doing so would constitute a breach of contract.[[/footnote]] The incident that occurred in March of 2003 following the acquisition of Site 19 by the Foundation, which led to the public breach of “SCP-173,” resulted in the beginning of formal negotiations with the Foundation.\n\n@@ @@\n\n++ Recent Cleanup Reports\n\n\"[[[SCP-529]]]\" refers to a house cat seemingly lacking the posterior half of its body. The animal was discovered on the streets of Pierre, when the Foundation was alerted to its presence. The capture methods displayed by the Foundation here have been noted to be rather crude, with \"Standard Cleanup Protocols\" calling for Dr. Clef to be sent after the cat. On the same day, there were numerous reports of a \"crazy guy with a crowbar\" chasing a \"half-cat\" down the streets. The animal is currently at large.\n\n\"[[[SCP-999]]]\" was discovered by hired HVAC repair worker Benjamin Kondraki[[footnote]]Wanted on several charges of smuggling [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-408 illegal butterflies] of an anomalous nature.[[/footnote]] in Site 19's ventilation system. The entity appears to be an amorphous mass of sentient slime mold. Despite the potential health hazard the organism potentially poses to staff, the Foundation willingly allows it to roam freely throughout Site-19. Inspection has revealed there are still mold growths in Site 19's ventilation system, with Williams citing \"budget cuts\" as the reason for their presence.\n\n\"[[[SCP-020]]]\" refers to a cleanup in June of 2004 by the Safe Cleanup Professionals of reported \"invisible mold.\" The Foundation was alerted to its presence when they received a call from an undisclosed civilian about fungal growths in their home. Foundation employees promptly arrived on the scene, only to find a distinct lack of the aforementioned growths. Nonetheless, the civilian's residence was cleaned and sprayed as if said mold was there regardless. Despite the report's questionable authenticity, \"SCP-020\" is now considered to be a neutralized threat.\n\n\"[[[SCP-044]]]\" is a WW2-era howitzer located in Site 19's parking lot. Its origin is unknown, as the Foundation has been evasive about its background. The item is generally inert, save for an unexplained incident in August of 2007 where a vehicle identified as Williams' personal diesel pickup truck was inexplicably launched from the howitzer, crashing into a nearby building[[footnote]]Notably belonging to splinter rival company Clean-up And Optimizing Solutions, Incorporated.[[/footnote]] and causing an estimated [REDACTED] dollars in damages.\n\n@@ @@\n\n++ Report on the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation\n\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #ffffff; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\nThe Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation has numerous issues.\n\nThe company is largely incompetent, as can be seen from their failure to contain \"SCP-529\". There are numerous problems with plumbing and electrical systems, and there is no permanent maintenance staff to take care of this.\n\nFurthermore, numerous issues with containment are present. Notably, the status of \"SCP-173\" is a cause for concern, as the sculpture is simply left to collect in its own filth within its shipping container, though the sanitation issues are mitigated by the bi-weekly cleanings. It is recommended that the company invest in a permanent drainage system, or at least a feces-absorbent diaper. The containment of \"SCP-682\" is also in a poor state, as the animal is left in a steel cage and fed once daily. The Foundation seems to spend a concerning amount of resources and budget attempting to put down the creature, which could construe animal cruelty. The laissez-faire attitude towards containment of \"SCP-999\" raises certain issues as well.\n\nMost importantly, the Foundation appears to be keen on spreading disinformation to the UIU regarding the success of their operation. The reports on \"SCP-001\" and \"SCP-020\", among others, are likely falsified. Furthermore, during inspection, Foundation employees repeatedly falsely reported contained anomalies, including supposed item \"SCP-997\", claimed to be a \"lamp that gets rid of rodents,\" whatever that means.\n\nThe incident with item \"SCP-044\" speaks for itself.\n\nOverall, following my assessment of the Foundation's \"Site 19\", the facility's operational success is rated 4.0 out of 10. Recommending decrease in budget.\n\n-- Jeremiah Cimmerian\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n++ Recovered Document from Site 19\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open File\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel admin-letter\"]]\n= [[size 125%]] SCP FOUNDATION [[/size]]\n= Founding Document\n= March 5, 2003\n\nWelcome to the new site.\n\n A lot of progress has been made with the beginnings of our company, but the hard work of trying to clean up after the things that come our way was always hampered by our lack of a base of operations.\n\nTo keep the Safe Cleanup Professionals Foundation alive, we've moved into Site 19.
