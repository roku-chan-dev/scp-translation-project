Background\n\nOn 06/03/2024, the American-flagged cargo carrier //Saint Sebastian// was found adrift in the Canadian waters of Lake Huron by the //USCGC Hollyhock// on a routine patrol. The carrier did not respond to hailing attempts sent by the craft, and was quickly boarded by an Interceptor deployed by the Coast Guard buoy tender. \n\nThere were no surviving souls onboard the carrier, but the Guardsmen were able to find the dismembered remains of several individuals, seven of which were able to be positively identified as crewmembers of the //Saint Sebastian//. The remains were less than twelve hours old, indicating that the incident had occurred sometime during the night prior on June 2nd. \n\nThe //Saint Sebastian// was recorded to have been carrying steel products from Cleveland, Ohio to deliver to Chicago, but there were several discrepancies within the ship's manifesto. The logs indicated that the carrier had been loaded with much less than the deadweight tonnage of its class, but was reported as at maximum capacity. Further investigations found that the interior of Hold 5 had been left empty save for a large conex box, which had been violently demolished from the inside out. \n\n\nDue to the violent nature of the incident, as well as its reported \"eerieness,\" the incident was reported first to the rear admiral at District 9, then to the FBI. The //Hollyhock// immediately called upon reinforcements, with the Coast Guard tug //Bristol Bay// and several civilian craft answering to help tow it to Port Huron, upon which the UIU assumed command of the investigation.\n\n+++ 2. Current Status\n\nThe Occult and Supernatural Activities Taskforce (OSAT)—the UIU counterpart in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police—has repeatedly demanded that Unusual Incidents turn over all evidence involved in **Case 2024-092**, claiming jurisdiction over the carrier, since the ship was discovered adrift in Canadian waters. The UIU has so far refused to comply with such demands, claiming jurisdiction over the ship due to being American-flagged as per the Jones Act, and due to the right of salvage as excised by the American Coast Guard. Further requests of complete turn-over of the investigation are to be denied, but cooperation and information-sharing by relevant parties is considered to be crucial. \n\nThe nearby Foundation [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub Site-43] has been notified of the incident, but has not responded to UIU requests for information sharing and cooperation. Frustration from the lead of the investigation is duly noted. \n\n\n+++ 3. Leads\n\nThe origin of the cargo container is believed to be the best lead towards discovering the cause of the incident. The conex was significantly damaged during the incident, and the ship's logs never make direct mention of the container itself—contravening international standards of commerce—which makes tracing its origin difficult. As its whereabouts before it was loaded onto the //Saint Sebastian// are currently unknown, further investigation is needed. \n\nWithin Hold 5 itself there were more human remains discovered, but they were damaged so severely that identification is currently infeasible. //Nekyia//s of the victims are to be attempted promptly, though preliminary necromantic forensics suggest ectovorous properties to the attacker. \n\nAs well as human remains, more exotic materials located in the vicinity of the corpses were also discovered, metallo-organic structures reminiscent of insect chitin. This substance may indicate that the attacker was animalian in nature, if anomalous in form. A sample was sent to the Esoteric Laboratory Division at Quantico for analysis. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Collected Evidence]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Interview Transcript\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewee**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nJacob Cooper[[footnote]]American navigator that sailed with the //Saint Sebastian//.

Current Status\n\nIn the days since the discovery of the //Saint Sebastian//, there have been over twenty missing person reports filed within a twenty mile radius of the //Saint Sebastian//'s location at time of recovery. These people were reported to either be on or near Lake Huron at the time of their disappearances, and due to the inordinate number of reports for the region and season, the events are believed to be connected to the case. Additionally, there has been an uptick in reports of stolen vehicles, most often in the form of watercraft[[footnote]]One missing report describes the theft of a personal C-64 Norseman floatplane, but it is believed to be unrelated.[[/footnote]]. \n\nThe remains of the conex were repaired, and the serial numbers of the shipping container were able to be reconstructed through analysis of unworn patches of the container's surface. The earliest mention of a conex with matching serial numbers on the record was in Gdańsk, Poland, a shipping port on the Baltic Sea. It then traveled by rail to Romania, where it was purchased from an unknown party by the Romar Shipping Agency, whom in turn shipped it to Cleveland, where it was then picked up by the //Saint Sebastian// for delivery to Chicago. \n\n\n+++ 2. Leads\n\nAlthough the origin of the conex is now known, the actual contents within are still a mystery. The shipping and proof-of-purchase documents were all tampered or modified in some way, obscuring its true nature. While a possible avenue of further investigation, as of this time the paper trail does not seem to have any relevant or time-sensitive information worth pursuing. \n\n\nA man in disheveled clothing entered the Detroit Field Office at 5:53 PM on June 16th, claiming to have information relevant to the case. He addressed himself as Wyatt Henderson, and also claimed that he was a former OSAT agent taking an unauthorized absence from the agency. As of the writing of this report, that information has been passed to OSAT for verification, and Mr. Henderson has been placed in a holding cell until he is able to be fully debriefed. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Collected Evidence]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Interview Transcript\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewee**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nWyatt Henderson\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewers**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nSAC Quinn Law\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Interview&nbsp;Date>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n06/17/2024\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Session&nbsp;#>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n01\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n------\n\n> //[The door of the interview room closes with a loud// click //as SAC Law escorts Henderson into the room.]//\n> \n> **Law:** Please, take a seat. \n> \n> **Henderson:** Sure. \n> \n> //[Henderson's chair scrapes across the floor as he grabs it.

Current Status\n\nFollowing the interrogation of the corpse of OSAT Agent Wyatt Henderson—and what little remained of his soul—very little information was actually pertinent, though some interesting facts were learned. Firstly, he was killed roughly around 10 PM on June 13th, while walking down the beach, feeling a piercing sensation just below the C4 vertabra before expiring. Examination of the body revealed a tentacle with toothed suckers embedded into the back of his neck. The tentacle led to a puncture wound in his abdomen, ultimately connected to a small, plastic object buried in his chest cavity that resembled a child's toy boat covered in tumors. Secondly, it is now known that the entity is capable of possessing others, both human and watercraft. Unfortunately, the individual formerly known as Wyatt Henderson expired during interrogation, and his body was remanded to OSAT. \n\nChemical analysis of the exotic remains found within the //Saint Sebastian// by the E. Lab returned positive for Krealite, a substance commonly used in bio-mechanical devices, such as early 20th century demonic circuitry and Amrita Therapeutics' Naturbeat, a medical pacemaker. A biopsy report found the same material in a sample of the Henderson tentacle.  Cross-referencing past casefiles has found several instances of the substance entered as evidence, with the most notable example being **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6426 Casefile 2010-021]**. \n\n+++ 2. Leads\n\nCombining the large number of missing persons and watercraft, as well as the presence of Krealite on the //Saint Sebastian// and the interrogation of Wyatt Henderson, the prime suspect of **2024-092** is now believed to be the spree killer (due to its lack of legal name, it will henceforth be referred to as \"Subject V\") of **2010-021**, which has until now been considered at large since its escape from paralegal law enforcement fourteen years ago.\n\nIt is not currently known how it came to be located in Europe, how it was able to hide for so long without discovery, nor the reason that it was shipped to the Great Lakes region. However, following this revelation, External Consultant V.H. is being brought in from the state of Washington to aid the UIU in the systematic search and arrest of Subject V.\n\nAdditionally, certain Veil-aware elements in Coast Guard District 9 have been alerted to Subject V, and have consequently intensified their patrol of southern Lake Huron on both sides of the border, as well as initiating live-fire drills. Canadian OSAT and Foundation Site-43 were also notified, increasing their patrols in turn. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Operational Report]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Operational Record\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Case&nbsp;File&nbsp;#>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n2024-092\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Report&nbsp;Author>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nAlice Harker\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Date&nbsp;Filed>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n06/19/2024\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Irregularity** _\n**@<Cross&#8209;reference>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\" colspan=\"5\"]]\nCoast Guard, Foundation, Homicide, Naval, OSAT, Mind Control, Krealite\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n\n+++ 1. Background\n\nTracing the linked missing persons and vehicle theft reports, it appears that Subject V is slowly moving south down the American coast of Lake Huron. It is currently unknown where Subject V's true destination lies, but it is theorized that it will either attempt to escape to Lake Erie through the St. Clair River, or cross the border into Canadian waters. The latter would be undesirable, as OSAT has become increasingly hostile towards Coast Guard operations in the area, threatening diplomatic retaliation for violating Canadian sovereignty. It is preferred that Subject V stay contained in southwestern Lake Huron, as to limit its exposure to civilian populations, as well as the breadth of the manhunt. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=30\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=200px\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/uiu-file-2024-092/Boat.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Red dots indicate last known location of missing person. Blue dots indicate both the location of the //Saint Sebastian// and Subject V. \n]]\n\nSatellite imaging and radar surveying have been unsuccessful in locating Subject V on the surface. External Consultant V.H. has utilized her time in Huron interfacing with the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5494 local entities], imploring their aid in searching for Subject V. Upon being gifted a meteoric iron dagger, one of the //manido// reported observing Subject V at the bottom of the lake-bed the night prior, slumbering. It is theorized that due to its paranormal nature, the boat only travels at night, submerging or otherwise hiding itself during the day. If it travels slowly as to not alert the passive sonar systems of passing ships, that would explain both its nonappearance and slow travel time. \n\n+++ 2. Objectives\n\nWith the consent of the //manido//, the Coast Guard will conduct sonar surveys near the region where Subject V was last spotted, paired with a limited dredging operation. There will be a security cordon of UIU and Coast Guard vehicles in the vicinity ready to engage with the entity if it is discovered. The objective is to float Subject V to the surface and incapacitate it with wood and silver stakes, allowing for an arrest. In the event it flees, the ships are to force it closer to shore, away from population centers and shipping routes before engaging. Agents are warned of possible secondary entities present in the area. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Operational Report\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div style=\"border: dashed 2px #000000; background: #f4f4f4; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin right-left: 10%; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n\n **1500:** Surveying operation commences. Point taken by the //USCGC Mackinaw//, //USCGC Spar//, and the //USCGC Biscayne Bay//[[footnote]]All three craft were armed with twin .50 caliber machine guns, as well as additional small arms added to the ships specifically for the operation.[[/footnote]]. Six UIU fast picket boats—piloted by the Chicago MOOT under the direction of lead SAC Law[[footnote]]Several members of the Detroit MOOT squad had contracted appendicitis at this time.[[/footnote]]—provided additional coverage, with a MH-65 Dolphin[[footnote]]The helicopter was armed with a 7.62 mm M240 machine gun and Barrett M107 0.50 in (12.70 mm) caliber precision rifle.[[/footnote]] deployed from Coast Guard Air Station Detroit for aerial surveillance.\n\n**1540:** MH-65 reports visual contact with a small plane that does not have its transponder active, nor respond to hailing attempts. Pursuit is nixed in favor of the operation. Plane quickly disappears from view, heading east. \n\n**1620:** One hour and twenty minutes into the operation, //Mackinaw// reports disturbances on the lake-bed at a depth of eighty feet, consistent with that of a shipwreck. External Consultant V.H. dives to inspect the disturbance. \n\n**1622:** V.H. reports a positive confirmation of Subject V. The entity appears to be in an inactive state, with most of its interior purposefully flooded. Preparations for forced dewatering begin. Coast Guard vessels declare all hands as a precaution. \n\n**1647:** UIU dive team and E.C. V.H. guide air hoses down into Subject V, evacuating its holds of water and restoring buoyancy. Subject V begins to slowly ascend, directed by the dive team and V.H.. \n\n**1659:** UIU picket comm team reports chatter on Foundation encrypted channels. Soon after, MH-65 reports movement across the lake near Foundation Site-43. \n\n**1700:** Subject V awakens. Tendrils of Krealite lash out from the craft, lacerating Agent Bauer's thigh and V.H.'s pectoral fin. V.H. attempts to disable Subject V by bashing its rudder with her head, but is warded away by thrashing Krealite tentacles. \n\n**1701:** Subject V attempts to dive, but is prevented by the dewatering process and the air hoses lodged in its hull. It then issues a series of loud mechanical percussive sounds and radio signals before propelling itself eastward thirty feet below the surface at a speed of 17 knots (~19.6 mph). The two UIU picket boats powering the air hoses were capsized by Subject V's sudden movement. \n\n**1702:** UIU picket comm team reports radio response from the shoreline. MH-65 report secondary entities (\"V-1s\") moving to engage allied craft. UIU Agent Doyle, trapped aboard the submerged Subject V, plants a transponder on its hull before being eviscerated by the ship. MH-65 is told to pursue the entity. \n\n**1705:** Eight V-1s—six civilian speed-boats, one jet ski, and one forty-foot yacht—enter within effective firing range. The //Spar// and the //Biscayne Bay// open fire on the lead craft, scuttling it. \n\n**1707:** UIU pickets engage with the enemy craft, harassing them with spell- and gun-fire. two speed-boats were capsized, but a jet-ski was able to flank one of the pickets and fire a harpoon from a Krealite barrel lodged in its fuselage. The organic harpoon speared through Agent Kennedy's sternum and into the hull of the picket. \n\n**1708:** SAC Law utters an incantation and summons the spirits of the drowned, sinking two more speed-boats under the weight of the damned. The jet-ski dives underneath the picket and breaches on the other side. The harpoon's line goes taut and flips the fast picket over, capsizing the craft and sending three agents into the water. Agent Carpenter attempts to rescue Agent Kennedy before he drowns, but is unable to remove the harpoon. The //manido// take the body.[[footnote]]Further negotiations with the //manido// seek to recover Agent Kennedy's body.[[/footnote]]\n\n**1710:** The MH-65 reports the heading of Subject V as it crosses the American-Canadian border. It is on a course for the Foundation convoy as it heads north, intercept in less than two hours. A second MH-65 is deployed from Air Station Detroit for medevac. \n\n**1712:** The //Spar// fires upon the yacht, which receives minimal damage, regenerating quickly. The yacht responds with a salvo of bone harpoons aimed at the seamen on the deck of the //Spar//. Two men were injured, one critically, in the exchange. The yacht begins to reel in the harpoons, accelerating with intent to ram the //Spar// head-on. \n\n**1712:** Picket is able to rescue the three agents in the water, before being accosted by the final motorboat. Alchemist Dent siphons fuel from the picket's tank into the water, transmuting it and portions of the picket's aluminum hull into napalm jelly, setting it alight with a match. The motorboat is unable to avoid the burning water, with the organic portions of the hull quickly set aflame. The V-1 sinks soon after. \n\n**1712:** Consultant V.H. collides with the hull of the yacht, destroying its rudder and altering its trajectory, receiving minor wounds to dorsal region in return. The //Spar// accelerates at full power, narrowly avoiding collision. \n\n**1714:** With the other V-1s neutralized, the three Coast Guard ships and UIU pickets focus fire on the yacht, which is unable to retaliate under the withering gunfire and is destroyed. \n\n**1720:** The second MH-65 arrives and medevacs the injured to Station Harbor Beach.\n\n**1725:** The fleet reforms and matches Subject V's speed and course. The top speed of the Coast Guard vessels are just able to match that of the entity, so interception before Subject V engages the Foundation ships is determined to be nonviable. The pickets are ordered stay with the icebreakers, as they are outmatched in firepower if they engage the tugboat alone.  \n\n**1731:** External Consultant V.H.'s echolocation detects //manido// below her. Communicating with the water panthers, they express a desire to help and remove Subject V and its influence from the lake. After conferring with SAC Law and //Mackinaw// Captain Wilson, V.H. accepts the //manido//'s offer.\n\n**...**\n\n**1830:** //Biscayne Bay// reports visual confirmation of Foundation ship, which is already engaged with Subject V. //SCPS Taiga Tumble// appears to be listing to starboard, with heavy damage from Subject V's organic cannons. An OSAT picket is observed sinking a hundred yards to the south, with no visible survivors. Several more V-1 instances are swarming the //Taiga Tumble.//\n\n**1831:** Captain Wilson orders the //Mackinaw// to engage with the secondary crafts and aid the //Tumble//, leaving the //Spar//, //Biscayne Bay//, and UIU pickets to Subject V. \n\n**1832:** Crew-members of //Spar// report aircraft engine noises above them, growing in pitch. MH-65 confirms, reports visual contact on aircraft confirmed the stolen C-64 Norseman, flying at a steep angle of attack towards //SCPS Taiga Tumble//. MH-65 fires on the plane and punctures the canvas frame in  several places, but is unable to neutralize it before it collides with and breaches the hull of the //Taiga Tumble//. \n\n**1832:** Subject V fires upon the //Spar// with its cannons, causing several barnacle-like growths to impact the ship, quickly growing and consuming the hull. Attempts by Guardsmen to remove these growths resulted in assimilation, with their removal only accomplished by flamethrower. \n\n**1832:** Guardsman Ellis on the //Biscayne Bay// aims a repurposed MK-153 SMAW[[footnote]]Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon, a smoothbore rocket launcher.[[/footnote]] at Subject V, firing after finding their footing. The rocket destroys much of the aft section of the paranormal tugboat, causing Subject V to veer off course before grabbing a nearby V-1 and assimilating it to repair the damage. \n\n**1833:** Tendrils from the remains of the C-64 aircraft move through the hull breach and withdraw a struggling woman, later confirmed to be Foundation Doctor Karen Elstrom. The woman resists, drawing a pistol from an ankle holster and fires it several times into the aircraft, to no visible effect. The floatplane peels itself from the hull of the //Tumble//, and attempts takeoff with Elstrom within it. \n\n**1834:** Subject V breaks away from the //Spar// to follow the C-64, but is struck by two //manido//, developing a list as they claw at its keel. \n\n **1835:** While Subject V attacks the //manido//, SAC Law and her MOOT team covertly sneak aboard Subject V via jetpack. It notices them, and attempts to attack the squad, but is quickly halted by the team utilizing wooden stakes inlaid with silver, hammering them into the tugboat's wooden surfaces. Subject V becomes immobilized. \n \n **1835:** MOOT prepare a ritual to exorcise Subject V.  \n\n**1836:** MH-65 pursues the Norseman, and fires at the flaps and floats of the craft with the precision rifle, trying to avoid injuring Doctor Elstrom. She can be seen within the cabin, restrained by flesh and sinew, though appeared to be quickly sawing through it with a small knife. The Barrett punctures one of the floats, which begins to leak a mixture of water and intestines.\n\n **1836:** SAC Law quickly advances to the boiler room. Though nearly incapacitated, Subject V resists.  \n[[=]]\n**Captured Body Camera Footage**\n[[/=]]\n> //[Agent Law is breathing heavily, the sound nearly overpowered by the firing of naval guns and monstrous roars coming from the exterior.

The remaining V-1s seem to seize up, unable to move under their own power, causing some minor collisions. They are dispatched with relative ease by the combined forces of the UIU, Coast Guard, and Foundation. The Norseman crash-landed five-hundred yards southwest of the battle, Elstrom having taken the controls after Subject V's incapacitation and gently crashed the craft. Elstrom was discovered treading water, aggressive but generally unharmed as she was medevaced by the MH-65. \n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Casualties**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n17\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Fatalities**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n5\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Operation>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n##green|SUCCESS##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n\n[[tab Collected Evidence]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Interview Transcript\n[[/=]]\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewee**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-bitch Karen Elstrom][[footnote]]Foundation Chief of Administration and Oversight, picked up by the Coast Guard in the aftermath of the **Operational Report**.

Findings\n\nIt is now known that the entity called \"Subject V\" escaped from a European Foundation black site and smuggled itself to the Great Lakes Region through a series of shell companies formed some decades prior, aided by a few intermediaries like Wyatt Henderson in its self-trafficking. This series of stunts and crimes was done solely so that the perpetrator may approach Foundation Doctor Karen Elstrom with romantic intentions, which she had previously rebuffed. \n\nThe Foundation knew both of Subject V's escape, and its intentions towards Doctor Elstrom, but choose not to notify the UIU of this pertinent information. Instead, with the aid of OSAT, the Foundation attempted to covertly move Doctor Elstrom to a secondary location during the time covered in **Operational Report**. This movement, observed by the aerial V-1, caused Subject V to awaken, and the severe loss of life noted in the **Operational Report**. \n\n+++ 2. Bureau Actions\n\nThe remains of the crew of the //Saint Sebastian// were returned to their families, with their deaths described as \"an industrial accident.\" The //Saint Sebastian// itself was released to its parent company, though they have encountered legal difficulties in regards to the goods carried by the //Saint Sebastian// at time of impound, as well as improper precautions taken with the impounding of the vessel by the UIU. The ship is to be sold below-market to pay for the cost of legal fees. \n\nThe Coast Guard participants of the actions recorded in the **Operational Report** were sworn to secrecy under //geas//, and compensated with shore leave. The sounds of the action were officially reported as part of live-fire drills by the Coast Guard on American soil, while reporting was gagged by OSAT on Canadian. \n\nFollowing negotiations with the //manido//, the bodies of the Coast Guard and UIU sailors that had perished over the course of the **Operational Report** were returned in exchange for promises to more tightly police illegal fishing and dumping in the Great Lakes. In a gesture of good faith, //Mackinaw// Captain Dennis Wilson personally waded into the water to retrieve the bodies from the //manido//, gifting the panthers copper beads to seal the pact. \n\nSubject V was formally charged with fifty-eight counts of second-degree murder, fifty counts of assault of a law enforcement agent, twenty-six counts of theft in the first degree, eleven counts of theft in the second degree, nine counts of destruction of government property, five counts of murder of a law enforcement agent, two counts of illegal possession of a weapon, one count of stalking, one count of attempted kidnapping, and one count of illegal entry. Subject V was towed into custody at 11:45 PM on June 19th, 2024. \n\nA restraining order has also been issued on behalf of Karen Elstrom by both the American and Canadian governments. \n\n+++ 3. Final Analysis\n\nAlthough Subject V was slated for demolition, its defense attorney argued that the Caldwell test—utilized to determine the sentience of androids—could be applied to other intelligent non-humanoids as well, thus giving their client the full rights and privileges of a human under the Constitution. Due to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/comedown-machine-hub other significant political events] behind the Veil, the Third Circuit Domestic Security Court has issued a stay on **Case 2024-092** for the foreseeable future, and thus (as of August 29th, 2024) the demolition of the entity has been postponed indefinitely. Additionally, if and when the stay is lifted and a decision has been reached, Subject V is most likely to appeal. \n\nFor the duration of the stay, it has been determined that Subject V be relocated to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/paramax Paranormal ADX]'s medium security wing for the safety of the American people. As Paramax is not designed with the imprisonment of a to-scale tugboat in mind, it has been determined that only the boiler—the portion of the tugboat that contains its consciousness—is required to be jailed. \n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n------\n\n**For a different meeting between Karen and Quinn, check out [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/transposthumousism Transposthumousism] by [[*user HarryBlank]]!**",
