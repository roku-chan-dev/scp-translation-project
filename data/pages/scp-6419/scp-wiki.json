SCP-6419 is not to be handled or opened by any living being. If it is to be moved for any reason then the usage of robotics or drones are to be used. If opened, no personnel are to look at its pages. In case of testing, one Pig specimen is to be exposed to the book via drone. MTF Σ-26 (Shinigami's Eyes) are to monitor the subject, intervene to save the life of the subject if requested by the supervising researcher, and mitigate containment breaches caused by SCP-6419.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6419 is a leather-bound hardcover book with a blank front and back cover. On the spine of SCP-6419 is an engraving that reads \"II of IX\".  The book's primary effect is activated when a sentient being touches the book or views its contents directly. This effect will extend to the last person to view or touch SCP-6419 once the current \"target\" expires.\n\nWhile a subject makes contact with or views SCP-6419, a new story will be written in its pages at a rate of 40 words per minute through unknown, anomalous means.  Within 60 seconds of the words being written, the anomaly will begin manipulating persons, weather patterns, and anomalies, among other variables to make the story a reality. The range of this effect is currently unknown, although SCP-6419 has controlled phenomena in a radius of at least eight kilometers. \n\nThe book is believed to have a low level of sentience, as its methods appear to become more focused over time in an intelligent manner. Each additional story seemingly enhances the effectiveness, speed, and lethality of the next story. This level of escalation currently has no known upper limit.\n\nSubjects targeted by the book's effect may be spared by what is written on the pages, but the book will employ increasingly extreme methods to terminate the subject. It will eventually reach a point where even those who attempt to save the subject of the anomaly's focus will also be put at risk. While others may be harmed or killed in the process, no new “targets” can be created by assisting the main target of SCP-6419.\n\n\n**Discovery:** On 12-1-2022 MTF Σ-26 raided a warehouse belonging to a cell of the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chaos-insurgency-hub/ Chaos Insurgency] located in [DATA EXPUNGED], North America. The mission was completed without any casualties and resulted in the deaths of 28 hostiles.  SCP-6419  was recovered from the raid inside a plexiglass container along with the instructions for the object.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ view Step Document SC-48/986-65/327\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** SC-22/186-22/327\n> \n> **Document Type:** Step fragment\n> \n> **Dates Received:** 06-10-2021 through Undefined\n> \n> **Operation Status:** Open\n> \n> **Foreword:** Read clearly, Gamma class of Cell Number #59: Delta Command has procured the book that we have sent to you in accordance with Operation Izanami. You are to hold the book until told otherwise. Keep all Insurgency personnel from reading its pages or touching the book directly. \n> \n> Hereafter I, the Red Scar give you the Steps of the Plan as transcribed by the Engineer of the Chaos Insurgency.\n> \n> **1.

STEP [22/327]**\n> \n> Go on about your business.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe object was classified as SCP-6419 and initially marked as Safe. Shortly after the mission, Σ-26-8 committed suicide by placing the tip of his M4A1 rifle to his chin and pulling the trigger. Σ-26-8 had handled the book before handing it over to the Foundation for containment. The object was then reclassified as Euclid and testing began under the supervision of Researcher Todd Jackson.\n\n**Addendum 6419.01:** The following tests are from the first round of testing of SCP-6419. No interventions were allowed.  Unremarkable tests have been omitted.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Summary of Tests 0001-0008**: Early tests on SCP-6419 with pig specimens showed that the anomaly would take the easiest route to kill the animal with what was closest. Put a pig alone in a room and it dies of a heart attack. Place the pig in a room with a D-Class armed with a weapon and the D-Class will kill the pig.\n\nI thought we weren't going to get any results that way and I decided to use the anomaly on a D-Class with over 40 potential methods of termination. It was a drastic move, yes, but SCP-6419 choose a method that was more complex and grand. I wanted to continue with human trials to see how the anomaly affects the mind of sentient beings, but Director Richter mandated that no more D-Class be exposed to the book for ethical concerns.\n\nI agree and in hindsight, I should have thought about it before throwing life away like that. We have a few more tests planned and if nothing comes of them we're gonna shelve it. - Researcher Jackson\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |responsive-table-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nTest Number\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nTesting Methodology\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nDescription of Event\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nNotes\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-end= --] ]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |row-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Test Number ]]\n6419-009\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Testing Methodology]]\n(1) Male Pig, (1) Female D-Class.

She picks up the book and reads from it, despite being splattered with blood; D-1958 does not appear to have trouble reading. She says verbatim, **' Jona - Oh! He's dead...sad. Samantha, D-1958, has done the intended deed and in doing so has eluded her grim fate.'** After several minutes nothing anomalous or of note happened to D-1958.

I'll even help in these last couple of tests.\n\n**Jackson:** I think I should have the money for a couple but... I don't know, what if everyone is right? \n\n**D-1958:** Look, I'm no scientist. I got twenty for wire fraud, but I know a good deal when I see one. You're a smart guy and when you prove to your bosses that there's more to this book than just killing, they'll be patting you on the back and naming a wing after you.\n\n**Jackson:** You're right, Samantha. But I have to ask, why do you think it spared you?\n\n**D-1958:** I get the feeling those pages are hiding a deeper purpose. It needs me for something big and by helping you, I think we'll find out just what.\n\n[End Recording]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Addendum 6419.03:**\n\nThe following tests are from the third testing sequence of SCP-6419. The goal of these tests was to entice SCP-6419 to invoke anomalies during its stories through consistent intervention. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |responsive-table-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nTest Number\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nTesting Methodology\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nDescription of Event\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-start= --] ]]\nNotes\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |header-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |row-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Test Number ]]\n6419.0060\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Testing Methodology]]\n(1) Female D-Class was to escort (1) Male Pig outside a small rural town.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header= Description of Event]]\nAfter nearly 30 attempts on its life, D-1958 and the subject attempted to flee from an angry mob trying to execute the Pig for perceived crimes. It was then that [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1233 SCP-1233] landed on top of the subject terminating him instantly. Data from the team assigned to SCP-1233 showed that the pig appeared to have been lured to SCP-1233's exact landing trajectory.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Notes ]]\nI was hoping that with this test, we would have lured in an anomaly but according to our radar, Moon Champion was going to arrive there anyway. I was worried about D-1958 participating in this, she nearly got killed a few times but she's adamant that there still is something about the anomaly I'm missing.- Researcher Jackson\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |row-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |row-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Test Number ]]\n6419.0064\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Testing Methodology]]\n(1) Male Pig in a standard testing chamber\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header= Description of Event]]\nThis event proved to be the longest any subject has survived with over 45 attempts made on his life. Such attempts included:\n* 6419 manipulating [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4230 SCP-4230] to give the subject an adversary to terminate them.\n* Nearly being mauled after a Researcher solved [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1313 SCP-1313] in the subject's vicinity.\n*  A researcher telling a bad joke to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-504 SCP-504] and the subject stepping into the crossfire. \n* \nThe test concluded when the Pig picked up the book in its open mouth and walked into the D-Class quarters. Several D-Class were exposed and had to be terminated along with the subject.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-start= --] |cell-header=Notes ]]\nThis has gone on long enough. I'm ending testing on this anomaly. If any of those D-Class were compelled to keep spreading the effect of the book, we could all be dead. - Director Richter\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |cell-end= --] ]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |row-end= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:responsive-tables-source |responsive-table-end= --] ]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View Log of SCP-6419 Containment breach?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n\n> **Timeline of SCP-6419 breach**\n> \n> **12:00:00:**  Without authorization and pending reassignment, Researcher Jackson removed SCP-6419 from its containment. Within the following minutes, the procedures of several Keter class anomalies fail and break containment causing numerous casualties.\n> \n> **12:10:00:** Several MTF units including Σ-26 are deployed on scene to recapture the anomalies. Agents belonging to the Chaos Insurgency can be seen on the perimeter cameras but do not converge on the site.\n> \n> **12:15:00:** Researcher Johnston along with Σ-26-9 are seen evacuating researchers from their workstations.\n> \n> **12:20:00:** Researcher Jackson is seen pressing SCP-6419 on the chest of a passing security officer.  He appears to be reading through its pages and mumbling.\n> \n> **12:30:00:** The security officer heads to the security office and disables all of Site-78's perimeter security. The security officer then terminates themselves with a handgun. Explosions rock the walls of Site-78 shortly after, as Chaos Insurgency agents could now walk through the perimeter unimpeded. Though the specific cell hasn't been identified, they are believed to have been under the command of the POI known as \"The Red Scar\".\n> \n> **12:35:00:** Chaos Insurgency agents engage with Foundation MTF forces. Researcher Johnston is trapped with half of Σ-26 inside of the Parabiological Sciences department.\n> \n> **12:40:00:** Researcher Chudley is seen helping evacuate the D-Class to a more secure location. D-1958 is able to break away in the chaos and picks up a rifle from a deceased MTF. She starts heading toward Researcher Jackson's current location.\n> \n> **1:00:00:** Foundation combat personnel have lost 25% of their forces. All anomalies have been moved to emergency holding cells but the Red Scar and a few of her special forces remain on site.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[Video Recording found, begin playback]\n\n [Researcher Jackson is in his office reading SCP-6419's pages.]\n\n**Jackson:** **' Researcher Jackson is safe from the chaos around him. He only needs to wait until the MTF forces have cleared out the Chaos Insurgency.'** Good. That's good. What happens next? **'Researcher Jackson is nearing the final act of his story, a figure opens the door.'**\n\n [A minute after, D-1958 opens the door and enters the study. D-1958 holds their Rifle in one hand as they gesture with surprise.]\n\n**D-1958:** And it is D-1958! The one that was spared, but not really. Those who are spared can be directly possessed by me. Now, please stop reading from my pages, Jackson. I don't want you to see any spoilers.\n\n[Jackson closes the pages.]\n\n **Jackson:** Samantha? Wait, no. The way you're speaking.... you're the anomaly.\n\n**D-1958:** Haha. She stopped being Samantha the moment she entered my pages. Now, I assume you have some questions?\n\n**Jackson:** I do. To start, why not just start with a heart attack all the time? It's really simple and efficient.\n\n **D-1958:** But that's BORING! Especially when you've got nitro on standby. You always have to mix it up. Use a knife if it's available, maybe a stroke. There's more than one way to kill a pig. (laughing)\n\n **Jackson:**  The next thing is about our conversations. You were encouraging me to keep testing on you but... were those thoughts even my own? Did you convince me or was this just a part of your plan?\n\n **D-1958:** It didn't matter what I said. I just needed you to believe that you had been convinced by me. However, as it turns out your actions and thoughts were all directed by yours truly.  We've had a lot of fun together, Jackson, although I was reeeeally stretching it with your plot armor. Allowing you to continue testing despite all the trouble you caused.\n \n **Jackson:** So Director Richter wasn't being lenient... \n\n**D-1958:** Pssh. When is she ever lenient? She nearly fires Chudley every week for being a minute late. Oh, you naive little man. Every moment up to this point has been orchestrated by Izanami's Grimoire! \n\nI cooked up this vile plot by the Chaos Insurgency to trick the Foundation into picking up the book and then falling into your hands. You would feed me as many stories as possible, trying his best to save my victims but it was only making me stronger. Then as everyone started to shun you for your actions, you would come crawling to someone who shared your interest... me. Did you know that I don't have to kill the first person who touches me? I can keep a person in the back pocket and switch victims if I like. \n\n [Jackson appears distraught at D-1958's words.]\n\n**Jackson:** No. That’s not possible, I'd never touched the book before today... w-wait. When the Sigmas got back, -8 handed me the-, oh god. He handed me the book!\n\n **D-1958:** You got it all figured out huh? Well, let me tell you this little secret. When I told you there was a ledger that needed to be balanced? This is me balancing it.\n\n [D-1958 terminates Researcher Jackson and takes SCP-6419 from his body. They leave and are seen walking down the halls of the Pataphysics Department. They arrive in front of Researcher Chudley and the rest of the D-Class survivors.]\n\n**Chudley:** D..D-1958? Where did you come from? Did you get lost?\n\n**D-1958:** I was just... tying up a loose end. I managed to get that book from earlier.\n\n[D-1958 shows the book to Chudley.]\n\n**Chudley:** Six four nineteen? D-1958 p-put that down right now! \n\n**D-1958:**  Why? It's been a minute, I know how all this works. I also know how scared you are right now Chudley. I wrote you to be this way and you'll make for a //lovely// new story in my pages.\n\n[Chudley moves to shield a few nearby D-Class as D-1958 opens the book.]\n\n**Johnston:** EVERYONE CLOSE YOUR EYES NOW!\n\n[Researcher Johnston enters the frame of the camera wearing ear protection and tosses a flashbang that bathes the footage in white light for ten seconds. A gunshot is heard and when the flash clears, D-1958 has been terminated. There is groaning and sounds of pain from the survivors.]\n\n**Chudley:** G..god! My... ears are ringing...\n\n**Johnston:** Sorry Chudley... oh you probably can't hear me. (Johnston turns her head) Sigmas! Someone find a drone and get this thing secured!\n\n[Recording stopped]\n\n[[/div]]\n> \n> **1:30:00:** The Red Scar manages to escape from Site-78, leaving four mangled MTF in her wake.  Σ-26 begins to do a sweep of the remaining departments. The remaining CI commandos are captured and sent for processing.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6418]]] | SCP-6419 | [[[SCP-6420]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** The Man of Sorrows MET DP-14108-002.jpg\n> **Author:** Michele Giambono (Michele Giovanni Bono)\n> **License:**  Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication\n> **Source Link:** https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/436498\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=first| last=false| hub=yes\n| previous-url=/| previous-title=/\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6952 | next-title=SCP-6952\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-ninth-world-hub| hub-title=The Set of Nine\n]]",
