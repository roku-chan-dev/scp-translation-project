Thanks for viewing my author page!\n\nI'm an irregular writer with a wide range of interests. My main focus is on writing tales.\n\nFeel free to message me any time if there's anything you need.\n----\n+ My Articles:\n++ Tales\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"exactly-what-happened\"]]\n[[[exactly-what-happened|Exactly What Happened to Interdimensional SCP Death Battle Arena-13]]] - (+%%rating%%)\n[[/module]]\n**Posted:** 29 Aug 2023\n\n**Word Count:** 26,411\n\n**Author's Notes:** Written for Remixcon 2023, this was my first ever contribution to the wiki. I had originally planned to write a relatively short piece as my first article and work from there. Then I had a cool idea.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"animal-antics\"]]\n[[[animal-antics|Animal Antics]]] - (+%%rating%%)\n[[/module]]\n**Posted:** 28 Dec 2023\n\n**Word Count:** 6,509\n\n**Author's Notes:** This tale was written for December 2023's Art Exchange event and was a gift for [[*user MetalRavioli]], featuring many of her own SCPs. I had a lovely time writing this one. The healing anomaly I invented for this tale being an axolotl was actually a coincidence; I didn't realize MetalRavioli's profile picture was also an axolotl until after I wrote it.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"drowning-in-ambition\"]]\n[[[drowning-in-ambition|Drowning in Ambition]]] - (+%%rating%%)\n[[/module]]\n**Posted:** 26 Aug 2024\n\n**Word Count:** 765\n\n**Author's Notes:** This is a short tale originally written for a series that was deleted before its posting. It's a mirror of my own struggles with burnout and ambition, and it's something I think turned out very well.\n[[/div]]\n++ GoI Formats\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"the-beauty\"]]\n[[[the-beauty|The Beauty]]] - (+%%rating%%)\n[[/module]]\n**Posted:** 14 Nov 2023\n\n**Word Count:** 933\n\n**Author's Notes:** This article was a bit experimental. I wanted to try my hand at writing a short-form horror story akin to classic creepypastas in the SCP setting. I remain with mixed feelings about the result, but I'm still glad I wrote it.\n[[/div]]\n++ Joke Articles\n++++ Joke SCPs\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-0001-j\"]]\n[[[scp-0001-j|SCP-0001-J - World's Best Boss]]] - (+%%rating%%)\n[[/module]]\n**Posted:**  19 Sep 2023\n\n**Word Count:** 2,016\n\n**Author's Notes:** This article was co-written with [[*user AwhRyan]]. We wrote this rather spontaneously after he had the initial idea for it while planning a completely different co-written article that never came to fruition. I'm very proud of the mandatory movie night and 'scheduled 682 breach' bit.\n[[/div]]\n----\n+ Collaborative Works I've Contributed To:\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[[[log-of-anomalous-items-vol-vi|Log Of Anomalous Items, Vol VI]]]\n**Contribution:** Anomalous Item 1256 (The Revolver)\n\n**Date Added:** 28 Aug 2023\n\n**Author's Notes:** Thought the idea was cool, didn't have anywhere further to go with it, slapped it in there.\n[[/div]]\n----\n+ Relevant Offsite Works:\n[[div class=\"entry\" style=\"width: 95%;background-color: #FEFFFF;border: solid 2px #333333\"]]\n[https://hikarinu.itch.io/stardust I See You in Stardust]\n\n**Published:** 29 Jan 2025\n\n**Author's Notes:** This is a video game I made for Art Exchange 2024. It was a gift for [[*user Daymon Rocker]] (AKA NatCat). This is far from the first game dev project I started, but it is the first one I finished. I learned a lot from its development, most of which was the same lesson I've repeatedly learned and failed to internalize about my own over-ambition. Ultimately, despite how much I rushed to complete it back in December, I'm proud of how it turned out.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
