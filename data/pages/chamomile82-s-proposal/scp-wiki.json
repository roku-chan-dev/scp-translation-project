However, its effects can cause significant disruption both within and outside the Foundation. Currently, there is no perfect way to conceal it. Therefore, preventing the fact and the resulting chaos from spreading is done instead of using containment procedures. Additionally, since the effects of SCP-001-KO also manifest outside the Foundation, discussions are ongoing about how to identify and secure affected individuals.\n\nFrom 15:00 to 16:00 on the first day of each month, all personnel, including D-Class personnel, can access this document's public sections. Afterwards, until 17:00, each base manager encourages personnel to report experiencing SCP-001-KO. The Site Administrator sends a document listing the name, rank, and class of the person who reported, along with the memories they claim to have recalled, to the public email of O5-6. If further investigation proves it is true, they are designated as SCP-001-KO-1. Depending on the circumstances, procedures such as relocation of the base may also be carried out.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only\" hide=\"- Hide Document\"]]\nOn the 1st, 15th, and the last day of each month, for a total of three times, the --29-- 30 individuals who are aware of the existence of SCP-001-KO (referred to as SCP-001-KO-1) gather in the conference room on the 5th basement floor of Site-15. The conference room lacks surveillance cameras; at least five armed guards must be stationed outside. The meetings last for three hours and discuss strategies to handle SCP-001-KO. The room must be checked one hour before SCP-001-KO-1 members gather to ensure no cameras or listening devices are installed. Apart from the designated inspection time, no one other than SCP-001-KO-1 members can enter.\n\nThe conference room has a circular table and chairs for --29-- 30 people. In the centre, there should be a safe with a randomly assigned single-digit password, accessible only to the 12 members who are in a completely 'safe' condition among SCP-001-KO-1. The seating at the table is divided into three flexible groups. The groups are divided into those in a 'safe' condition who have completely prevented their death, those in a 'confirmed' condition who cannot alter their death by any methods currently available, and those in a 'progress' group who are actively attempting various methods to prevent their death.\n\nInside the safe are documents related to SCP-001-KO, writing materials needed for the discussion, and a recorder for verification. Necessary items for the discussion can be supplied upon request by --O5-6-- Researcher R, a Level 3 researcher in a 'safe' condition.\n\nAny documentation regarding SCP-001-KO must only be written by hand. After the discussion, the documents are returned to the safe, and an identical copy is produced. This copy is moved to an underground location at Site-██ within three hours after the discussion ends and stored in another safe with the same password. The safes are made from barium stannate alloy to prevent the destruction of the documents.\n\nNew SCP-001-KO-1 members are selected based on emails received by O5-6 when they meet the same fate as mentioned in the email. They are designated as SCP-001-KO-1 in the next iteration. The base supervisor who sent the email undergoes amnestic treatment regardless of the truthfulness of their claim.\n\nSCP-001-KO can be known to any personnel, including O5 members, randomly. To prevent chaos, all SCP-001-KO-1 members must conceal their status.\n\nIf any SCP-001-KO-1 members enter a 'safe' condition, they achieve a security clearance of Level 0 or higher, not subject to demotion.\n\nChange Log: D-0673's recent designation at Site-12 as SCP-001-KO-1, 'safe', has necessitated revisions to the containment procedures and content of the previous documents. Additionally, D-0673's security clearance has been upgraded to Level 0. The supervisor at Site-12 has undergone amnestic treatment.\n\nChange Log: Following the death of O5-6, who was in the 'safe' group, slight changes have been made to the containment procedures. Following this document, O5-6 will belong to the 'progress' group until a new method is found.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** If SCP-001-KO is confirmed, it must be eliminated as soon as possible and concealed as if it never occurred. Currently, a select few are researching this method.\n\nSCP-001-KO is a type of non-contagious anomaly that appears in certain individuals designated as SCP-001-KO-1. SCP-001-KO-1 suffers from confusion caused by recurring fragmentary memories about future events or their deaths. These memories arise from their perspective, amplifying emotions such as fear and anxiety.\n\nPer the request of O5██, access to this document is restricted beyond this point for those who are not SCP-001-KO-1. If you are experiencing SCP-001-KO, please proceed according to the special containment procedures outlined above.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only\" hide=\"- Hide Document\"]]\nSCP-001-KO is the reality we live in. This reality has been in a continuous cycle since the 'End' of the world. Ordinary people, after their death, wake up from sleep on the day before their death and continue living as if nothing happened. After each cycle, people live the exact life they lived before the cycle, but since they do not remember the life before the cycle, this leads to them dying the same death as before the cycle.\n \nSCP-001-KO-1 are individuals who, at some point, wake up retaining the memories of the reality they lived in before. This happens randomly. SCP-001-KO-1 can recall events from before the cycle from their current perspective. Soon, SCP-001-KO-1 become aware of how they die, experiencing intense anxiety and fear. If SCP-001-KO-1 prevents the death they are supposed to meet, memories from before the cycle cease to surface. (Refer to Addendum requiem-1)\n\nWithin the Foundation, the objective is to prevent the deaths of each SCP-001-KO-1 progressively, thus preventing the death of all of them. Currently, there are --29-- 30 SCP-001-KO-1, divided into --11-- 12 in the 'safe' group, 10 in the 'progress' group, and 8 in the 'confirmed' group. The 'safe' group consists of individuals who have prevented their most imminent death. This group helps the 'progress' and 'confirmed' groups. The 'progress' group, with help from the 'safe' group, seeks ways to prevent their deaths. The 'confirmed' group consists of unique cases where current methods cannot prevent their inevitable deaths. (Refer to Addendum requiem-2)\n\nThe memories retained by SCP-001-KO-1 are never erased under any circumstances. Therefore, it is recommended that SCP-001-KO-1 periodically receive psychological therapy. (Refer to Addendum requiem-3)\n\nSCP-001-KO experiences the 'End' just before the cycle restarts. Currently, three known types of the 'End' and other variables leading to different types of the 'End' are being investigated. A variable refers to a situation where a particular action changes future outcomes. To date, 216 variables have been identified. Records of these variables and the results of actions taken based on them remain even after the cycle.\n\nCurrently, only one member of SCP-001-KO-1, O5-██, has survived until the 'End'. However, no one in the Foundation has yet seen the recently discovered third type of the 'End.' The SCP-001-KO-1 in the 'safe' group is currently trying to find the variables that will allow them to witness this third 'End'. (Refer to Addendum requiem-4)\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-1 \" hide=\"- Secure. Contain. Protect.\"]]\nThis is a part of a diary left by Researcher K:\n\n> Date ██25/03/04\n> //I decided to record this so I could go through the situation peacefully. What exactly is happening to me? Strange things have been happening since a week ago. Is it because of the stress from being overworked? Memories I don't even know of keep appearing. The counselling and medicine I got at the hospital were of no help. Even now, they keep coming and coming and coming. Luckily, when I sleep, I don't think about anything.//\n\n> Date ██25/03/07\n> //'Memories' keep surfacing, but I've gotten quite used to them. For example, the memory of bumping into Researcher ████ in the third-floor hallway and spilling coffee on my clothes helped me avoid that exact scenario. If I use this well, it might even help me get a promotion. Still, I can't decide if this is a blessing or a curse.//\n\n> Date ██25/03/09\n> //Fuck fuck fuck fuck!! I'm a piece of shit. I knew it and still couldn't do anything. I barely saved my own life. Yeah, this is a curse; someone must be punishing me; what should I do now? I can't ask for help from anyone. No one will understand me. I wish someone would help me, please...//\n\n> Date ██25/03/14\n> //I'm coming… Wait for me//\n\n> Date ██25/03/01\n> //I don't know how this happened. Did I go back in time? According to what's written here, I died on March 14th. But I'm writing this on March 1st. And these damn memories are showing up right up to the moments before my death. Damn it.//\n\n> Date ██25/03/08\n> //Tomorrow is the day. Could I do it? I'm considering what I can do to save my colleagues as I assess the situation. First, I need to replace the flask, and I also need to report that the door is broken. Also, if that monster freaks out again, I need to call the security team in advance. I'm nervous, but this time, I won't run away. Definitely not.//\n\n> Date ██25/03/10\n> //I did it! Although everyone got a bit hurt and in treatment, no one died! I did it! I changed it! I don't know who gave me this curse, but listen up, you bastard, it won't go your way anymore, haha! I will change it!//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-2\" hide=\"- Secure. Contain. Protect\"]]\n\nThe following are excerpts from notes documenting attempts to save Dr. ██████, a member of the 'confirmed' group, along with the outcomes:\n\n> I) Replaced the car Dr. ██████ was about to take just before departure > Prevented an explosion and rescued him.\n> Although the explosion was stopped, a traffic accident occurred en route, resulting in his death (X)\n\n> II) After replacing the car, took a different route to the destination > Both explosion and traffic accident avoided.\n> He was sniped. (X)\n\n> III) Used a D-Class personnel disguised as the doctor as a decoy first > The real doctor departed 30 minutes later.\n> This attempt identified the sniper's position. However, the problem was that there were multiple snipers.\n[Further details omitted]\n\nDr. ██████'s comment: //If my death can't be stopped, then so be it. I will do my best until I die. Thanks to everyone.//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-3\" hide=\"- Secure. Contain. Protect.\"]]\n\nThe following is a transcription of an experiment recorded while attempting to amnesticise J, formerly D-3475, who is one of the SCP-001-KO-1 and requested memory erasure.\n\n> **Date: ████/05/██**\n> \n> **Subject:** J\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Researcher R\n> \n> **J:** Did you get authorised?\n> \n> **Researcher R:** Yes, I'm going to administer amnestics to you now. Just lie down and be calm.\n> \n> **J:** (Short pause) I feel a bit selfish, trying to escape all by myself, don't I?\n> \n> **Researcher R:** No, don't think that way. If the world has always been this way and is a natural law, we might need to hold onto this as a last resort.\n> \n> **J:** (Long pause) It's challenging... having unbearable memories constantly rekindled and seeing someone's death over and over. Seeing someone who will soon die smiling brightly in front of me... and having to bury this overwhelming, maddening sadness without anyone knowing... and also...\n> \n> **Researcher R:** (Interrupting J.) Alright, I'm going to administer the medication now. If it works, at least you'll be able to spend this cycle more comfortably. Here we go.\n> \n> (Approximately 10 minutes of silence, after which J's voice is heard, as if just waking up.)\n> \n> **J:** Uh... where am I...\n> \n> **Researcher R:** Hey! Are you awake? You collapsed during your shift. They said it you overworked yourself. I told you to get some sleep!\n> \n> **J:** Ah...\n> \n> (About 3 minutes of silence)\n> \n> **J:** Guess I can't escape, can I...? Don't bother lying. It doesn't fit you.\n> \n> **Results:** The memories of SCP-001-KO-1 are not affected by memory erasure.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-001-KO-1 eyes only: requiem-4\" hide=\"- Secure.

They will be here soon, and then it will end for me. This record will be placed in the safe before they break the door. I hope it survives. I think variable 200 had a significant influence. Had we not allowed SCP-███ to meet [DATA EXPUNGED], it might not have come to this. Unfortunately, I am blind now and cannot describe my surroundings. I am struggling to write this document. Just in case, I will record the last thing I was informed of: 'The ground rises, splits, and breaks.' If only I hadn't gone blind, I might have been able to gather more information. Oh, it seems I've been spotted. This 'End' is a failure.//\n\n\n**Observations by O5-██ on the second 'End':**\n\n> //Implementation of variables 13th, 67th, 99th, 100th, 187th, and ███th leading to the 'End'//\n> \n> //The only Foundation personnel confirmed to be alive are me and agent K-Silver from [DATA EXPUNGED]. The Coalition has been defeated. The GOC is annihilated, and although there are survivors within the Chaos Insurgency, they are few. Who would have thought 'she' could control the SCPs? If this 'End' is to be prevented, destroying 'her' must be our top priority. This must have been what [[[SCP-990|SCP-990]]] meant. I do not wish to describe what I see before me. It would have been better if I had gone blind as before. I am utterly exhausted.//\n\n\n**Observations by Researcher K just before the third 'End':**\n\n> //Implementation of variables [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED], [DATA EXPUNGED] leading to the 'End'//\n> \n> //It's not the 'End' yet, but this seems as far as we can go. I can't handle this alone. I'm not confident. We need to find other variables. I never dreamed such an absurd event could happen. I am overwhelmed and powerless. If O5-██, who has already experienced the 'End' twice, were here, maybe he'd try something... but now it's impossible. The clock will stop soon...//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nOnly accessible to SCP-001-KO-1 who are O5\n[[collapsible show=\"+ requiem\" hide=\"- hymn\"]]\n> Do you know what a requiem is? Yes, that's right. It's a piece of music intended to comfort the souls of the departed, a fitting metaphor for our current world. The world ended a long time ago. In a way, the world we exist in now is no more than solace for the world that has vanished.\n> \n> We tried. To prevent the 'End,' we identified threats, contained them, and conducted experiments, experiencing an endless cycle of blood and pain. But nothing changed.\n> \n> Thus, another world vanished. And we moved on to the next requiem, vanishing and moving on repeatedly. The only changes were the discovery of the Foundation, the place that contains dangerous entities, and more of those entities that came to be known as SCPs. There was no progress. It was the opposite. As the cycles repeated, more entities labelled as SCPs were discovered, naturally worsening the situation, and we despaired, treading the same paths dependent on our previous memories.\n> \n> However, without us realising it, the future had changed at some point. We possessed far greater technology and power and were living beyond the 'End' of the past. We realised that it wasn't that there was no progress; it was just slow. From that moment, we began to perceive this world not as a requiem but as a hymn—a recognition of a new opportunity rather than a lament for a past world.\n> \n> No one knows how many more times this will repeat. But we do not despair. Now, we focus on changing  the future by rekindling memories of the past to prevent the unfortunate 'End.' To do this, we must secure, contain, and protect.\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
