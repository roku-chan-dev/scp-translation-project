According to eyewitness testimony, a flash flood had swept through their campsite and separated Halliburton from the rest of the group he was traveling with. He was presumed dead up until this point.</p>\n<p><span class=\"titled\">Researcher</span> Halliburton was swiftly detained and interrogated.

You didn't need to bring out the whole cavalcade just for me.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It's just standard procedure, nothing personal. Surely you must understand the... <em>gravitas</em> of you showing up like this?</p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Is this because of the sign? Look, I didn't realize it was a big issue, the phrasing is kind of confusing. I thought it led to the commissary—at least, it is the right direction. I would know; I've had to carry a compass just to get around here without being late to everything.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> [pause] Gene, are you aware of the events of the last few weeks? Specifically, what happened when you were on PTO?</p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Wha—of course I am. Is this a comment about my mental acuity? I'd remind you that jokes aren't jokes if they hurt feelings and we are in a harassment-free workplace. [pause] It was my daughter's birthday, Hane, I wouldnt forget that. We went to the beach. I took the next few days off and went to Vegas with the guys. Lost a couple hundred at the casino since I left my wallet next to the vending machines. Most expensive bag of Combos I've ever had.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> And what about Arizona? You must remember that.</p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Yeah? What about it? It was a nice way to round off the trip. Weather was lovely. Got to see the vortex, which was almost certainly anomalous, by the way. We should probably look into that.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> I guess so. Well, while you were gone, Logistics updated the keycard readers and issued new codes. The old ones stop working throughout the day, so I'll need to update yours immediately if you don't want to get flagged every time you do so much as wash your hands.</p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Ah, I guess that explains things.</p>\n<p><em>Some rustling is heard.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Here you go.</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Perfect, thank you. Just be a sec.</p>\n<p><em>A few seconds of silence, followed by the sound of sliding plastic, ending on a series of out-of-key beeps.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> Hmmm.</p>\n<p><em>Another plastic noise, followed by more flat tones.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> Is there a problem?</p>\n<p><strong>Dougherty:</strong> It's probably this shoddy clearance handheld, they have spotty connections down here, I apologize. I'll get it done in a snap, hold tight.</p>\n<p><em>Scraping and creaking as a chair is pushed back. Dougherty is heard getting up and leaving the room.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> [sighs]</p>\n<p><em>Roughly two minutes of silence pass.</em></p>\n<p><em>The door is heard opening, followed by a several pairs of footsteps.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Security Personnel:</strong> Alright, let's go! Up! Now!</p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> What—?</p>\n<p><em>Sounds of commotion, struggling.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> No, look at my badge, I—I'm a level <span ID=\"clearancespell\">three</span>—[grunt]—fuck—LEVEL <span ID=\"clearancespellcap\">THREE</span>!

[yelps]—I <em>didn't</em>—<em>do anything</em>!</p>\n<p><em>Thirty seconds of struggle, accompanied by a dragging sound.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Halliburton:</strong> H-HELP! Somebody help!—Please!—What are you going to do to me?—[sobs]—Let me go! Please, I want to see my family! M-MAGGIE!—[sobs]</p>\n<p><em>Microphone records similar for the next few minutes.
