Due to its proximity to Site-101, the location is occasionally used for staff birthday parties.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-351888**\n**Description:** A building that causes all animals that enter it to turn into a small peach. The peaches are retrievable from the outside since the effect only manifests upon complete entry. Notably, decay of the peaches occurs significantly slower when inside the building. They are otherwise non-anomalous.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** Johns Creek, Georgia, USA\n**Security Protocol:** The building has been purchased through front companies. One security guard is to monitor the area at any given time.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-519422**\n**Description:** A large cabin comprised of pure oxidane. The manner in which the structure maintains a solidified state is unknown though it is theorized to be a telekinetic force exuded from a point in the Earth's upper asthenosphere. When any foreign oxidane comes into contact with the cabin, it will be absorbed into the cabin and be converted into items consistent with that used in suburban homes throughout the late 20th century. As of this current writing, all objects removed from the structure have evaporated after being brought over 5 Meters from the initial entry point to the cabin.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** Inglin's Park, Connecticut, USA\n**Security Protocol:** A 1.5 Meter electrified fence has been constructed surrounding the structure 0.5 Kilometers from the object.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-760460**\n**Description:** A 13x13 meter area in which all metal alloys do not experience oxidation.

Intruders are to be arrested and all plants are to be confiscated.\n**Note:** //The potatoes are non-anomalous and delicious - Senior Botanist Castañeda//\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-487184**\n**Description:** A restaurant named Burger Kingdom. Whenever someone attempts to cook in the kitchen, a voice will harshly criticize whatever meal is cooked. The more mistakes are made, the louder the voice will become. The highest recorded volume was 154 decibels.\n**Date of Containment:** 2003-03-05\n**Location:** Ohio, ██████, USA\n**Security Protocol:** The restaurant is to remain closed and any offers to sell are to be denied. Trespassers are to be given amnestics and removed from the location.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-918651**\n**Description:** A cornfield in which all known flora can be grown, including those that can not normally grow in that environment. The exception is corn, which cannot be grown in the area.\n**Date of Containment:** 1983-10-15\n**Location:** Jamestown, Virginia, USA\n**Security Protocol:** The area has been blocked off via a barbed wire fence. The surrounding areas are to be monitored for unauthorized use.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-129304**\n**Description:** A large patch of land that, when any vehicle enters, will cause multiple small white rabbits to manifest above the vehicle every three minutes. The number of rabbits appearing at the same time is five on average, however manifestations of up to 20 rabbits at once have been observed. All rabbits dissipate once the vehicle has exited the area.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** [REDACTED], Malaysia\n**Security Protocol:** Task Force MY0253 (“Bunny Catchers”) are tasked with removing the rabbits on the area and administering amnestics to civilians who encounter the anomaly.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-169630**\n**Description:** An In-N-Out Burger restaurant where the burgers seem to always be pink (uncooked), no matter how long they’ve been cooked for. Investigation of the kitchen has revealed nothing wrong with any of the kitchen appliances.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** A town in California, USA.\n**Security Protocol:** Restaurant shut down under the guise of bugs in the kitchen. All workers were given amnestics. The customers naturally forgot about the anomaly on their own.\n**Note:** All In-N-Outs should be placed under surveillance in the event that another one has the same (or a similar) anomaly.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-268376**\n**Description:** A back storage room in the former building of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum in ████, ██ in which if a Michael Jackson wax figure is put inside and left for ten minutes the figure will start dancing and singing, with audible backing vocals and instruments, any of the late singer's hits.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** ████, ██\n**Security Protocol:** Witnesses were given Class-A Amnestics. Madame Tussauds has been moved, making the likelihood of an event occurring improbable. However, the room remains under surveillance.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-114527**\n**Description:** A 20x10x4 kilometer region in the upper troposphere of Neptune. Every █-██ weeks, two equally sized squadrons of fighter aircraft, consisting of █-██ P-51 D-30 and Bf-109 K-4 aircraft respectively, will materialize on opposing long ends of the region and engage in aerial combat, with aircraft dematerializing shortly afterwards. No pilots have yet been observed.\n**Date of Containment:** 1989-08-27\n**Location:** Upper Troposphere, Neptune\n**Security Protocol:** A small aerostat observation probe has been deployed above the region. No further containment is currently needed.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-825345**\n**Description:** An abandoned wood shed that is filled with 150 //Acer laurinum// leaves approximately every 24 hours through anomalous means. This effect does not take place if there is no space available for the leaves to manifest.\n**Date of Containment:** 1997-05-17\n**Location:** Nay Pyi Taw, Yangon, Myanmar\n**Security Protocol:** Destroyed in an earthquake. Testing has shown no anomalous effects.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-816064**\n**Description:** A sidewalk where pedestrians are only able to walk while their eyes are closed. Attempting to walk with open eyes invariably causes said pedestrian to expel a large amount of liquid resembling vomit from the mouth via unknown means.\nThe composition and appearance of the substance is completely unrelated to the contents of the affected person's stomach.\n**Date of Containment:** 2019-██-██\n**Location:** Jeju, Jeju Province, South Korea\n**Security Protocol:** The surrounding area was purchased and is being monitored for further anomalous activity.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-364675**\n**Description:** An exact copy of a defunct kebab restaurant originally located in London, England. Exploration by autonomous drone reveals the inside of the building to not only be fully furnished but also fully stocked with restaurant supplies despite its location. The original building that the anomaly appears to be based on was shut down in 2004 and has shown no sign of anomalous activity.\n**Date of Containment:** 2013-11-14\n**Location:** The bottom of the Weber Deep, Banda Sea, Indonesia\n**Security Protocol:** Foundation agents are embedded in various nautical research institutes to divert civilian research away from the area. The original restaurant has been bought by Foundation front company and converted into a safe house.\n**Note:** Radiocarbon dating done 2019-02-05 shows that the building is at least 4,000 years old.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-119221**\n**Description:** A small lake that when frozen over, footprints will appear occasionally on the ice spelling out the name of a person that will die within the next five days.\n**Date of Containment:** 2017-03-22\n**Location:** █████ ████, Idaho, USA\n**Security Protocol:** Snow is to be shoveled bi-daily. The location is also fenced off and labeled as private property. No security procedures are needed during late spring, summer, and early fall.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-490400**\n**Description:** UE-490400 is a retail park that extends itself infinitely when an individual attempts to leave the area through the entrance gates. Witnesses describe victims \"turning upside-down\" followed by them vanishing, along with a persistent scent of plastic and gasoline. \"Generated\" extra stores in the extended version of the park are usually copies of existing stores, although these can deviate at times. Deviant stores include \"Baker Food!\", \"Quiche Quiche Quiche\", \"The Long Way 'Round\", \"Mallwart\", \"Tobacco High School\" and \"This Is An Infinite Retail Park\".\nIndividuals that enter this area can leave by passing back through the gates.\n**Date of Containment:** 2015-██-██\n**Location:** Madison, Wisconsin, USA.\n**Security Protocol:** Little effort is required to contain UE-490400's effect. A sign has been placed on the entrance gate's adjacent wall that promises a $50 fine for exiting through it. Cameras monitoring the gates capture any individual to enter the infinite section, who will be retrieved and amnesticized.\n**Note:** Who exits through the entrance anyway? - Dr Stuart\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-282412**\n**Description:** A basement where items that have disappeared within a 10 mile radius manifest.\n**Date of Containment:** 1987-06-05\n**Location:** South Boston, Virginia, USA\n**Security Protocol:** The house above the location has been purchased by the Foundation. Items are to be disposed of after checking for significance in local crime. Tupperware and left socks may be disposed of immediately.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-700560**\n**Description:** UE-700560-A and UE-700560-B are two areas of land within a 1km distance of each other wherein satellite imaging shows the presence of two non-existent structures, one of which has never existed (a large mansion in a secluded pasture, UE-700560-B), and one of which formerly existed, but has been demolished (an abandoned house located on a nearby side street, UE-700560-A). The latter, formerly existing structure was at one time an anomalous structure, however the structure inexplicably lost its anomalous properties in 2010 and was demolished the following year. Satellite surveillance shows minimal activity occurring at either location, but personnel on the ground report seeing neither the structures, nor subjects coming or going from these areas.\n**Date of Containment:** ████-██-██\n**Location:** Walkertown, North Carolina, USA.\n**Security Protocol:** The pasture land designated UE-700560-B has been purchased by the Foundation and is currently used as a surveillance outpost to monitor activity at either site, itself designated Site-B. Due to the secluded location of both sites and low likelihood of civilians being affected by the anomaly, no action against residents living in the area is authorized.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-561348**\n**Description:** A collective designation for any \"Jamba Juice\" brand beverage chain operating inside the nation of Indonesia. All franchise chains appears to instill a memetic sense of \"dread\" and \"terror\" to approximately 0.005% of costumers who interacted with any of the instance. The effect cannot be removed with any treatment and subjects would often be driven into mental breakdown.\n**Date of Containment:** 2019-03-29\n**Location:** Jakarta, Indonesia\n**Security Protocol:** As per 2019-07-03, the Indonesian Jamba Juice operation have been bought by a Foundation front company, which then shut down all 4 existing chains. A stand built and contained in Site-██ still exhibits the anomalous property.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-66328**\n**Description:** A Pokémon-themed store that sells t-shirts, plush toys, and plastic toys depicting different Pokémon from the series. Once purchased and brought outside the store, the purchased item will transform into a ball of light that reveals an item of the same type that was bought except it now takes the form of the Pokémon Ditto. Only merchandise of said Pokémon is immune to this effect.\n**Date of Containment:** 2018-12-20\n**Location:** ████████, Japan\n**Security Protocol:** The Foundation has purchased the store and placed a front business in the place of the original store. The merchandise for sale has been sent into storage at Site-██, and all items related to the Pokémon series is prohibited from this area.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-773217**\n**Description:** The stall farthest from the entrance of a men's room in a ████████ brand movie theater that, when the door is opened, will automatically flush the toilet. Whilst the water is refilling in the bowl, the pelt of a small mustelid drenched in the blood of either a small rodent or songbird will rise into the bowl.\n**Date of Containment:** 2020-11-26\n**Location:** ███████, Massachusetts, USA\n**Security Protocol:** An \"Out of Order\" sign has been applied to the door, and caution tape has been wrapped around the stall. Any person who opens the door should be administered Class-A Amnestics, and the pelt should be checked for anomalous properties.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-824317**\n**Description:** Five square meters of land in the ██████ Desert of Nevada which, when stood in, will cause extreme vertigo and nausea until the affected individual is moved out of the area.\n**Date of Containment:** 2020-12-19\n**Location:** ██████ Desert, Nevada, USA\n**Security Protocol:** Small house built on top of the location, windows boarded up and door blocked.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-029305**\n**Description:** A crater (.5km diameter) in the Scottish highland, formed by a massive kinetic force converting into thermodynamic detonation. Interior is lined with plant detritus and ash. A badly damaged wooden door was discovered at the crater's center, with a note nailed to its front reading \"KRUG [[[another-goddamn-magic-system | KNOCK]]] TOO HARD SORRY\".\n**Date of Containment:** 2021-02-14\n**Location:** 10km north of ██████████, Scotland, UK\n**Security Protocol:** Note and door kept in containment, environmental restoration efforts underway.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-71135**\n**Description:** A LAN gaming center sponsored by GoI-078 (##purple|Arcadia##). It’s a minor nexus for video game-based Anomalous Items and SCP objects and presents Nexuses’ qualities, including a population of ten people.\n**Date of Containment:** 2023-01-24\n**Location:** Seoul, South Korea\n**Security Protocol:** Every Anomalous Object or SCP object not bound to the Nexus Confines is to be brought to Site-15 for analysis. The Foundation bought the site and it is kept as a center for the study of minor electronic anomalies.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-55984**\n**Description:** A cave in the small village of ██████, France with various cave paintings dating back as far as 2.3 million years. Among the drawings one would expect, several interpretations of figures in lab coats and jumpsuits standard to SCP Foundation personnel are present along with several crude depictions of the SCP Foundation logo.\n**Date of Containment:** 1997-03-03\n**Location:** ██████, France\n**Security Protocol:** Due to the location presenting no danger aside from a small information breach, security is minimal. The parts of the cave containing the SCP related drawings are walled off to the public under the guise of being unstable. They are accessible to study given approval by one staff member of level-2 clearance or above. The remaining area of the cave is now operating as a tourist site \"Special Cavern of Paris\" as a low-maintenance form of income. Any members of the public caught trying to infiltrate the roped off areas of the cave are to be taken into custody, questioned, and then released after given appropriate amnestics.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-55112**\n**Description:** A small area of land at Montauk, New York was accidentally discovered on February 19 by Dr. █████ █. Hawley in which all photos taken depict a massive amount of compression, despite being roughly the same file size as a high quality image. Any photos taken within an area of around 50 square meters will display varying degrees of compression, ranging from 50 to 4 pixels per centimeter (ppcm). Additionally, the photos taken will not compress any organic matter captured in the image, resulting in an effect similar to focusing a camera on a single position. The affected area seems to shift every few hours, but stays within a one kilometer diameter circle. \n**Date of Containment:** 2021-02-19\n**Location:** Montauk, New York, United States\n**Security Protocol:** The area of land affected should be tested daily using Rettru Mini hidden Spy Cameras, positioned around the radius of land described previously. Access will be cut off via a cover story that sharks infest the waters around the land and that quicksand covers the entire beach; care should be taken to ensure no individuals wander into the anomalous zone, and even greater care not to release any media taken of the area. Any individuals who may appear are to be monitored to ascertain whether they are of any degree suspicious of the region and/or if they take any form of media away from the area. Should any media be taken of the region, the individual and any accomplices may be taken into custody, where the captured images and video will be deleted permanently via use of █████.█████.exe at Site-█.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-196224**\n**Description:** Island containing what appears to be a relatively small modern town, complete with signs of current habitation.  Little information is available, as any attempts to actually reach the island result in the island appearing to move away from the observer, remaining at roughly the same distance regardless of speed.  This occurs regardless of the method of travel used and will also affect air traffic.  Testing revealed that the anomalous nature of the island will also affect skydivers.  If multiple people attempt to reach the island simultaneously, all of them will experience the same effect.\n**Location:** South Pacific Ocean\n**Security Protocol:** As the island gets very little traffic and is effectively self-containing, security is nearly non-existent.  Those experiencing the anomaly generally believe themselves to be hallucinating, often from exhaustion.  This is facilitated by a misinformation campaign denying the existence of an unreachable island.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-237179**\n**Description:** Small, locally-owned thrift store.  Contents are completely normal and display no anomalous properties.  However, every item for sale was either lost or sold by Jane Edwards, a certified public accountant from Portland, Oregon, USA.  Worthy of note is that Jane Edwards has never visited the store or even the city in which it can be found.  Items arrive at the store through a series of unlikely yet apparently coincidental events.\n**Location:** Galway, Connacht, Ireland\n**Security Protocol:** Foundation personnel installed as employees of the store.  Original owners and employees placed under Foundation surveillance.  As the provenance of the items cannot be easily discovered by the public, no further security protocols are necessary at this time.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-234872**\n**Description:** UE-234872 is a single bedroom hunting lodge. UE-234872 is constructed of pine wood and has tinted glass windows. The entire interior of UE-234872 is painted white and decorated in a minimalist style. UE-234872 is a Class B cognitive hazard and deteriorates the thalamus of any persons present.\n**Date of Containment:** 2017-07-2\n**Location:** [REDACTED], Forest of Dean, [REDACTED] Drive, Christchurch, Coleford, Gloucester, UK, GL██ 7██ \n**Security Protocol:** UE-234872 has been purchased by the Foundation. All unauthorized individuals attempting to enter the premises are to be turned away and administered amnestic treatment if required. On-site security must wear non-Foundation clothing and be armed with concealed weapons.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-641092**\n**Description:** UE-641092 is a abandoned corn maze. Between October 1st and November 1st multiple small child like entities can be seen within the UE-641092.\n**Date of Containment:** 2013-10-8\n**Location:** [REDACTED], Illinois, USA\n**Security Protocol:** The land surrounding UE-641092 has been purchased. All unauthorized individuals attempting to enter the premises are to be turned away and administered amnestic treatment if required.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-561967**\n**Description:** UE-561967 is a small village and is constructed in the Western Rustic style used for structures in the western United States, dated early to mid-1800s. Any individual present will exclaim that it's 'hotter than hell's basement' and will often point out that the location is 'a ghost town'. The settlement contains no individuals and appears abandoned. Individuals within a 1 km radius will express the desire to engage in a duel via firearms with any person they have major difficulties with.\n**Date of Containment:** 2017-12-29\n**Location:** Death Valley, California, USA. Specifically the exact geographical center.\n**Security Protocol:** The Foundation has inserted personnel into the nearby populace and disinformation campaigns were administered to create the widespread belief that death via escalated temperatures and wild animals is a given in the centre. Place has been investigated and fenced off to prevent anomalous activation.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-343434**\n**Description:** A small hunting cabin in a remote section of [REDACTED] National Park.  No signs of wildlife (of any kind) can be seen within 50 meters of the cabin.  The exterior walls and doors show claw marks from an extremely large bear.  The depth, length, and spacing of the claw marks suggest that they were made by a fully-grown cave bear.  However, the cabin was built in the year 2000 and the cave bear has been extinct since the previous Ice Age.\n**Date of Containment:** 3-14-2021\n**Location:** Pacific Northwest United States\n**Security Protocols:** The cabin is built for occupancy by between 3 and 5 people.  However, only 2 agents are deemed necessary for containment.  Anyone straying into view of the cabin is to be turned away and informed that access is restricted due to the area containing breeding grounds for endangered species.\n**Note:** //Agents stationed at the location occasionally report hearing sounds of bears outside the windows in the middle of the night.  Night-vision and thermal cameras were authorized, but no evidence of any bears has been discovered.  Bears already in the region avoid the location, as do all other animals.// Dr. Somerset\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-BM3**\n**Description:** An area of indeterminate size, located around the deepest point of Lake Tanganyika. Drinking glasses of various shapes and sizes will spontaneously appear, filled with a red liquid that will promptly dissipate in the surrounding waters. The liquid is composed mainly of alcohol, tomato juice, and other ingredients commonly used in the recipe for the cocktail known as a Bloody Mary. Experimentation showed that performing a \"Bloody Mary challenge\" (Vocalizing \"Bloody Mary\" several times in front of a mirror) will cause the objects to appear in the location after a small delay.\n**Date of Containment:** 13/12/2020\n**Location:** Lake Tanganyika, Southern Africa\n**Security Protocols:** Glasses are to be extracted from the lake and disposed of on a yearly basis. Given the volume of the Lake Tanganyika, no other measures are necessary.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-86475**\n**Description:** Conference room in a luxury hotel. Anyone entering the room will have auditory hallucinations of a type of music they find enjoyable. These hallucinations are unique to each individual.

Anyone who has ever worked at a S█████ Halloween store will be compelled to replace the headstones with decorative Halloween headstone props regardless of the time of year.-- An oversized S█████ Halloween store, open year-round, which has been built over a large cemetery previously in the area. It is unknown, even to Foundation personnel monitoring the area, when the store appeared in the cemetery's place. All decorative headstones sold at this location have the names of people previously buried at the cemetery, and the faces on several horror masks in the store bear an uncanny resemblance to them. The store is otherwise non-anomalous.\n**Date of Discovery:** 11-23-2024\n**Updated:** 01-08-2025\n**Location:** Salt Lake City, Utah, United States\n**Security Protocol:** --Undercover Foundation personnel, working at the cemetery as undertakers and landscapers, are advised to deter anyone from entering with decorative headstones. Any decorative headstones found are to be removed at once. Anyone found taking headstones from the location are to be brought in for questioning and administered Class-A amnestics.-- Foundation personnel working as employees at the store are to confiscate any and all items that bear a resemblance to those once buried in the cemetery. The Foundation is working in cooperation with law enforcement and S█████ Halloween to determine where these items are being produced.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-789987120**\n**Description:** A Sears supermarket location, opened next to a Macy's after the Sears bankruptcy. Any attempt by a person to go in one store causes the person to appear in the other. Additionally, all attempts to leave either store through the door causes the person to enter the other. Any attempt to address a coworker regarding this anomaly causes a unique response based on location. In the Sears, they are trapped inside a Whirlpool brand washer that doesn't stop until its occupant is dead. In the Macy's, they are taken to the dressing room and transformed into a mannequin through unknown means. Employees live in the stores, sleeping on beds in the Sears during closing, and are anomalously compelled to remain inside them at all times.\n**Date of Discovery:** 04/9/2025\n**Location:** Port Deposit, Maryland, United States\n**Security Protocol:** Stores have been closed to protect the public under a cover story of condemning the area. Employees have been administered Class-G amnestics and released without incident.
