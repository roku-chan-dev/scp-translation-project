There are a number of interesting coincidences. (1) In both cases, no records exist for the establishment of these cemetaries, with the graves transferred dating between 1846 and 1918. (2) No given date of birth postdates 1899. (3) There are no known living relatives of the individuals interred.  (4) Eight of the graves, in each case, were combat fatalities.   Appropriate records have been altered. Whilst no living relatives of the deceased have been identified, anyone associated with the cemetaries has been appropriately amnesticized. The Foundation is in the process of exhuming and examining the remains of the transferred individuals, under the cover of an attempt to identify strains of Yellow Fever in victims before 1919.\n**发现日期：** 1/1/2018  \n**所在地：** █████ County Texas,  United States;  Isle of Man, United Kingdom.\n**备注：** //My father died in the Falklands Conflict.

The notable exceptions to this are //Firefly// (2002) and //Serenity// (2005), in which his character of Malcolm Reynolds is replaced with an often unseen \"Captain Espinanegra\" and other characters are significantly more hostile and/or distressed.

Notably, there is no evidence of human remains having ever been buried at the site. Within a metal safe-box hidden under the main mound, several anomalous or anachronistic objects were discovered:\n* Clay tablets, Mesopotamian origin. They have been wiped clean.\n* A lead orb. It glows faintly when near a corpse of any species.\n* A rusted-over phonograph player.\n* A Sony Walkman.\n* An unknown electronic device, similar in composition to smartphones, but matching no known construction. It is inoperable.\n* [[[scp-5871|An obsidian knife]]], along with ritual instructions.\n**Date of Discovery:** 1831/04/10\n**Location:** [REDACTED], Mongolia\n**Security Protocol:** Initially, none. The area is remote, and the Foundation at the time was too ill-equipped to set up a permanent presence there. Beginning in 1931, Outpost-871 was set up at the location, and in 1974, protocols changed to leave it largely unmanned and monitored remotely. However, starting in 2050, containment requirements are slated to change to require a full security complement present at all times.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-301729**\n**Description:** An irregular area of space, NNW of The Great Pyramid of Giza, where it is presumed that an alternate reality is shown: approximately 40% of the pyramid is missing, all other surrounding structures including the nearby city of Cairo and the other pyramids are missing; the sky is colored with various shades of red; the sand is a dull grey; and a black, spherical object approximately 131 meters in diameter can be seen above the Pyramid emitting a bright red glow. A faint \"rumbling hum\" can also be heard within the anomaly from all angles.\n**Date of Discovery:**  9/09/2022\n**Location of Discovery:** ~100 Meters above ██°██'██.█\"N ██°██'██.█\"E\n**Security Protocols:** Precautions are to be taken so that no aircraft enter the anomaly.\n\n**Unexplained Location UE-577730**\n**Description:** A disused tin mine in which footwear dating from the 1930's and earlier randomly materialise, all showing appropriate levels of degredation. Footwear is not restricted to those that would have been found locally.\n**Date of Discovery:** 17/01/2019\n**Location of Discovery:** Marazion, Cornwall, UK.\n**Security Protocols:** Mine shaft sealed off and warnings of cave-ins dispersed.

Security cameras in bushes and sand have been set up to watch for any civilians who would shortly be amnesticized upon discovery of entry. Attempts to locate anomalously transformed firearms have been unsuccessful.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki-cn:component:license-box\nauthor=HotCocoaNerd]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki-cn:component:license-box-end]]",
