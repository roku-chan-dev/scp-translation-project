Ship traffic is diverted from the area via the placement of several isolated danger buoys around the perimeter and anchored to the anomaly. These are to be checked by a Foundation team on a monthly basis to ensure that their placement has not shifted.\n\nIn the event that a buoy's placement has shifted, a diving team is to be dispatched and SCP-8770 is to be monitored for changes in its geometry, the buoys then adjusted accordingly to these shifts.\n\nOtherwise, the anomaly is to be left abandoned.\n\nSCP-8770 is not to be inhabited.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8770 is a vessel in a state of irregular structural flux, located upon the sea floor of the Atlantic Ocean at ██°██'███.█''N, -██°██'██.█''W. The exterior of the anomaly most frequently resembles that of a man-made, sunken vessel roughly 355 meters in length on average.  \n\nWhile external changes of SCP-8770 occur at seemingly random intervals, notable or consistent shifts have included:\n* Changes in materials that make up outer structures -- metal into wood, wood into metal, instances of stone, fabric or glass\n* Occurrences of new walls, suggestions of the creation of additional internal rooms\n* Large junctions of metal beams jutting downwards towards the sea floor\n* Indistinct railings along top portions or formed balconies\n* Steering apparatuses resembling those found on ships of inconsistent age\n* Nonsensical directional signs\n* Engine structures and propellers consistent with that of motorized boats and submarines\n* Wires\n* Roofs and sidings resembling those of residential homes\n* Windows resembling those of residential homes\n* Doors resembling those of residential homes\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= https://live.staticflickr.com/5488/9256291653_e6781fc32e_b.jpg |caption= An exterior portion of SCP-8770, showing an entryway. |width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAll structures are often in states of high decay and water damage.  The undersea area around SCP-8770 is almost a complete ecological dead zone, devoid of all marine life, with the exception of some corals that have grown on the structure of the anomaly.\n\nDuring initial analysis, it was discovered that SCP-8770 exerts a minor memetic influence on its surroundings -- increasing feelings of unease and discomfort in those that are within 5 meters of its exterior.\n\nAll attempts to access the interior of SCP-8770 via unmanned submersibles have resulted in the complete cessation of all technological functions upon entry. Approximately three submersibles were lost before the prospect of a manned investigation was proposed and subsequentially approved.\n\n**Addendum 8770:** The first four manned expeditions into SCP-8770 were undergone to determine the internal dimensions of SCP-8770's interior. Teams were instructed to remain on the outskirts, staying along the exterior wall as much as possible. Over the course of these explorations, the following was noted:\n* Interior was notably clear of any water damage that is expected of a structure of its nature\n* The appearances and disappearances of hallways, doors and windows at random\n* SCP-8770's interior dimensions have been recorded differently each perimeter expedition\n* SCP-8770's interior does not match the dimensions of its exterior, in spite of exterior shifts\n\nThe fifth expedition was an attempt to discover the center of SCP-8770.\n\n**Exploration Log 8770.5:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: none;\"]]\n**Foreword:** Three members of MTF Gamma-6 (\"Deep Feeders\") -- codenamed BLACK CARPET, NINGEN and MATAGI CARCASS -- were deployed to find the center of SCP-8770.\n\nTo determine if SCP-8770's memetic properties intensify by internal proximity, the heart rate of all present individuals were monitored and recorded.\n-----\n[[span style=\"color:black;\"]]\n\n**COMMAND:** //Gamma-6, do you read?//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** Copy that, Command.\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]**\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Loud and clear.\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS STABLE]**\n\n**NINGEN:** We read.\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM IS STABLE]**\n\n**COMMAND:** //Good. Proceed into SCP-8770.//\n\n//The team approaches the top portion of SCP-8770. This section has the appearance of the upper deck of a commercial fishing ship. There are broken posts and rotted barrels. Two paddle wheels emerge from parts of the hull, their bottom-halves seemingly fused into the rusted metal. These antiquated pieces appear out of time and place.//\n\n//SCP-8770 visibly stretches on for rough 30 meters in all directions, the rest of the anomaly obscured by the water’s turbidity — leaving only distant, towering silhouettes and shadows against the blue.//\n\n//The water is still, devoid of movement and life aside from Gamma-6 as they draw closer. Their swimming stirs bursts of dust and debris when they level with the deck.//\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/56/Le_Ville_de_Grasse_03.jpg/800px-Le_Ville_de_Grasse_03.jpg?20171204172141 |caption= From the body cam of BLACK CARPET |width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**NINGEN:** There's an opening in the floor of the hull up ahead. Should make for easy entry.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** I see it too.\n\n//The three swim to the gap in the hull. There is a ladder covered in algae and barnacles that descends into the space. The team swims inside.//\n\n//The interior appears like that of a standard submersible, though in the growing absence of sunlight all three members of Gamma-6 turn on their headlights. The three's respirators are the only sounds detected.//\n\n//NINGEN takes a roll of reflective, waterproof tape and wraps a strip around one of the rungs of the ladder.//\n\n**NINGEN:** I'll use these to keep track of where we're going. This place is a labyrinth.\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Good thinking. //[She pauses]// Let's hope there isn't a minotaur.\n\n//There's a quiet laugh amongst the team.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** You sure that’s gonna work, though? The interior of this place seems to shuffle around.\n\n**NINGEN:** Hopefully, when it shuffles, there’s a rhyme-and-reason to it. If we find our markings, they may still lead us back — especially with one right by the exit.\n\n//NINGEN pats the ladder, the orange tape now fastened to the rung.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** It’s also better than nothing at all.\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS nods.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** You think there's something in here they want us to find?\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Since the other teams found squat on the outskirts, they wanna see if there's a center to this thing. They just wanna know if it //has// one, y’know? A source. Not like there's any actual traces of life around this thing, anything that's mobile seems to avoid it like the plague.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** //[She nods again]// Well, that's good for us I'd reckon.\n\n//NINGEN cuts the tape, and pulls away. BLACK CARPET has since pulled out a heavy duty compass.//\n\n**NINGEN:** Alright, let's get moving.\n\n//The other two nod, and follow him as he begins to swim down the corridor. The visibility is considerably low, only allowing sight roughly a meter ahead. After approximately ten seconds of swimming, a hatch is seen at the end of the hall.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** ...it's like a warship's hall in here, all untouched.\n\n**NINGEN:** I'll open the hatch.\n\n//NINGEN goes to reach wheel handle, only for it to turn before he can grasp it. There's a loud hissing heard as NINGEN gasps through his respirator.//\n\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]**\n\n**NINGEN:** The hell--?\n\n//The hatch wheel turns in a full circle, before the hatch itself slowly opens inwards without being [[/span]] [[span class=\"depths\"]]touched[[/span]]. [[span style=\"color:black;\"]]\nMATAGI CARCASS and BLACK CARPET come to a stop behind NINGEN.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** ...I feel a current.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** Me too.\n\n**NINGEN:** Command? Door just opened itself.\n\n**COMMAND:** //Noted. Keep going, but be on alert.//\n\n//Through the hatch is an open room.//\n\n//A living room.//\n\n//Several pieces of furniture are situated around the space, all facing an inactive television. A coffee table with a few coasters and an empty glass upon it. The floor is carpeted. A bookshelf is situated against the far wall. BLACK CARPET approaches it.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** //[She swims to the center of the room, and turns in a small circle]// It's... not rotted. No coral, no rust -- nothing. So at least it’s… consistent?\n\n**NINGEN:** Yet the outside looks like it's been underwater for decades. //[He brushes a hand along the carpet, it stirs no debris]// Hm.\n\n//There is a pause of silence amongst the team.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** You think that lamp over there would be a good place to tape?\n\n**NINGEN:** Yeah, I'd reckon so.\n\n//NINGEN glances back at the hatch. It is still open. He swims over to a lamp that sits in the corner and begins to wind the reflective tape around it.//\n\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]**\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM HAS STABLIZED]**\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Someone come look at this so I know my eyes aren't playing tricks on me.\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS and NINGEN turn to her. NINGEN approaches.//\n\n//BLACK CARPET is holding one of the books from the shelf. Despite being within the water, it is undamaged and unaffected. She turns to show it to NINGEN.//\n\n//Random assortments of words and letters fill the pages without rhyme or reason. Some are shown to be blank when BLACK CARPET begins to page through.//\n\n**NINGEN:** Yeah, yeah no you're seeing that right. It's all... //[He traces a finger along the page]// gibberish.\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** They're all like this.\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS turns to the rest of the room. On the far side, past the couch and lamp, is the open entryway to a kitchen. She swims inside to investigate.//\n\n//Within is a dining table, four seats situated around it. Like the living room, the place is untouched by rot, rust or any other signs of water damage. Upon the table are placemats, plates, silverware -- all organized and laid out. Empty cups. A set of cupboards line the one wall above a counter with an inlaid sink. Along the same wall rests a fridge and an oven, the wires from the fridge are spread out all over the floor. None of them seem to be live.//\n\n//NINGEN and BLACK CARPET enter the kitchen as well.//\n\n**NINGEN:** It's like... everybody up and left. Table's set for dinner and everything.\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Are there any actual signs of this place ever being inhabited?\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS opens one of the cupboards. It is empty. She opens another. It is empty. She opens the fridge, and it too is empty. The light inside it does not turn on.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** ...I don't think so. All empty.\n\n//NINGEN's respirator hisses as he exhales.//\n\n**NINGEN:** Command? We've found an empty living room and kitchen. No sign of any past habitation or life.\n\n**COMMAND:** //Affirmative. Are there any other paths?//\n\n//BLACK CARPET is experimentally turning the knobs on the oven. The one burner begins to glow a soft red when she turns it up. Swiftly, she turns it back off -- than glances over her shoulder at NINGEN.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** I saw another hall past the bookshelf.\n\n**NINGEN:** We'll head there.\n\n**COMMAND:** //Very well. Proceed.//\n\n//The team exits the kitchen as a group, and BLACK CARPET leads the way.//\n\n//At the end of the hall is a child's bedroom.//\n\n//Like the living room, its interior conditions are pristine in spite of its sunken nature. There's a small bed against the far wall, a nightstand by its side. A bureau is a few meters away, with a lamp resting upon it. Everything is untouched, undamaged, unscathed. The walls appear to be pale, but the exact color is difficult to discern due to the water.//\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS finds the interior of the bureau to be filled with children's clothes. Unworn. She swiftly closes the drawer to keep them from floating upwards.//\n\n//A teddy bear is suspended at the ceiling, back facing the floor.//\n\n//NINGEN swims up to retrieve it. He turns the bear in his hands to examine its front.//\n\n//It's face and front is covered in mold and rot. Festering, dark splotches. Bits of coral.//\n\n//He releases it with a hiss of his respirator.//\n\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM HAS RAISED]**\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM HAS RAISED]**\n\n**NINGEN:** Jesus--!\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** NINGEN, the hell--?\n\n**NINGEN:** Well-- fuck. Found our first trace of -- of water damage inside this thing.\n\n//BLACK CARPET swims over, and takes the bear. She examines it.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Sure is... this was up against the ceiling, right?\n\n**NINGEN:** Yeah-- yeah it was.\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS swims upwards and puts her hand against the ceiling. She tries to push against it, test it for any weakness or damage, but it does not give.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** ...still pretty solid up here. The ceiling itself doesn't seem to be damaged.\n\n**NINGEN:** ...huh. I wonder why that thing's like that, then.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** Hell if I know — but it may mean something.\n\n//As MATAGI CARCASS pauses to think, BLACK CARPET turns her attention down to the bear in her hands.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** I'm gonna leave this in here, we can bring it back with us on the swing back to see if it's... got anything specifically weird about it.\n\n**NINGEN:** Sounds good.\n\n//She releases it. It floats back up to the ceiling. Its rotted face now stares down at the floor.//\n\n//The team quietly swims out of the room.//\n\n//There is a new door on the left hall. It is ajar.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Ah.\n\n**NINGEN:** Well, that’s the first structural shift we’ve seen while in here.\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Not uncharacteristic of the anomaly, but good to note.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** It's a way forward, is it not?\n\n//There is a moment of silence, before NINGEN relays the door's appearance to COMMAND.//\n\n**COMMAND:** //Proceed deeper.//\n\n**NINGEN:** Very well.\n\n//They enter through the door after NINGEN marks the handle with tape, and begin traveling down the new hallway. Extraneous exchanges over the next hour and a half have been removed for brevity.//\n\n//Over the course of this time, the team passes forty-four bedrooms, eighteen kitchens, twenty-six bathrooms, and fourteen living rooms. The furniture within range wildly in time period, mixes of modern and ranging previous centuries with little consistency.//\n\n//Periodically, they leave indication of their path via fluorescent tape.//\n\n//As they progress through hallway after hallway -- it is noted by the team that water damage and rust has become noticeable in places. There are holes in some walls, piping visible within. Discordant rods of metal, scattered instances of rotted wood or furniture against otherwise pristine pieces.//\n\n//The team stops for a brief break within the fifteenth living room, having to have opened a ship hatch to enter it. The hatch is left ajar behind them. There is a window on the far wall of the room. NINGEN shifts to check the levels of oxygen within their tanks.//  \n\n//BLACK CARPET holds up the compass and glances at the window. It indicates that she is facing south. Theoretically, this window's placement is impossible in relation to the rest of SCP-8770.//\n\n//Beyond it is an expanse of water. BLACK CARPET's light illuminates off a massive tangle of wires and pipes in the distance. There are unclear silhouettes past it all that appear to be moving. The body camera footage shows only blurs. There is a faint current emanating.//\n\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS RAISED]**\n\n//MATAGI CARCASS is instead examining the walls of the connecting halls, glancing around at the rooms.//\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** It almost feels... deliberate.\n\n**NINGEN:** Deliberate?\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** It's been on my mind since the first room. This all feels like it's... like all this has been set up for something.\n\n//BLACK CARPET turns away from the window.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Or someone.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** ...yeah.\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Maybe it was //supposed// to be, but I don't think it is anymore.\n\n//BLACK CARPET turns back to the window. It is gone.//\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Like when the landlord paints the walls to hide the wood rot.\n\n//She traces the now-wall with one hand, glove sliding over the water-damaged metal and dry-wall. Flecks of rust float off into the water.//\n\n**NINGEN:** You reckon we're... diving past those cover-ups, then?\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** //[She nods]// Peeling back the paint.\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** If we keep going, maybe we'll find what this thing truly is then. Dive past the walls, find the heart -- yeah?\n\n//The team nods. NINGEN informs COMMAND of the plan to continue deeper after ten minutes of rest.//\n\n**COMMAND:** //Your oxygen tanks contain enough air for roughly five more hours. Be safe.//\n\n//MTF Gamma-6 proceeds forward. In spots, the wall paper has entirely peeled away -- revealing metal and wires, wooden planks.//\n\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM IS STABLE]**\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM HAS STABLIZED]**\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS STABLE]**\n\n//30 minutes of travel passes.//\n\n//At the 31st minute, MATAGI CARCASS notices that one of the rotted boards along the floor is shifting. She reaches downwards and lifts it.//\n\n//Under the floorboards is a fish. Wrapped in wire and cables. It is impaled on piping.//\n\n//No. Not impaled. There is no sharp point nor end to the pipe. It stretches onwards, as though it had wound itself through the fish. There is no way it could have been impaled.//\n\n//It is still alive.//\n\n//Its gills flutter against its twitching sides, its eye is glassy and infested. Its whole body is infested. Defunct electrical wiring weaves through its flesh and scales and holds it tight. Its fins have melted into the rotted wood.//\n\n//It lives here. It lives here.//[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"depths\"]]//It loves it here.//[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"color:black;\"]]\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS’ BPM HAS RAISED SIGNIFICANTLY]**\n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** Command, are you— are you seeing this?\n\n**COMMAND:** //Affirmative.//\n\n//There is a pause.//\n\n**NINGEN:** We... we should keep moving --\n\n//She returns the floorboard. Returns the squirming thing to its [[/span]][[span class=\"depths\"]]Heaven.//[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"depths\"]] **COMMAND:** A shipwreck is a type of corpse. [[/span]]\n[[span style=\"color:black;\"]]\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** ...sounds like a plan.\n\n//The team continues.//\n\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS RAISED]**\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS RAISED]**\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM HAS IS RAISED]**\n\n//The halls have widened, the team is able to swim side by side. The wallpaper is [[/span]][[span class=\"depths\"]] beautiful. There are flowers painted on them, little yellow ones. [[/span]][[span style=\"color:black;\"]]It is falling apart. The ceiling has raised upwards, now being roughly ten feet above the team.//\n\n//The team enters a massive, [[/span]][[span class=\"depths\"]]open[[/span]] [[span style=\"color:black;\"]]room. Pi[[/span]][[span class=\"depths\"]]llars stretch up to the ceiling. The floor is polished stone. It is like an entryway to something grand. Dancing patterns are across the walls in bright and lively colors.//[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"color:black;\"]]\n\n**NINGEN:** The hell's that sound?\n\n**BLACK CARPET:** Beats me, visibility's shit in here.  \n\n**MATAGI CARCASS:** All the pipes, I think-- I've got a stronger light, hold on. //[MATAGI CARCASS unclips a heavy duty lamp from her hip, activates it and raises it.]//\n\n//NINGEN places another piece of tape at the doorway they came through. He stares down at the floorboards as they shift.//\n\n= **[MATAGI CARCASS' BPM IS RAISED]**\n= **[BLACK CARPET'S BPM IS RAISED]**\n= **[NINGEN'S BPM HAS IS RAISED]**\n\n//They are able to scan and travel through the room easier with the added light.
