Foundation Webcrawler ΘΨ.2.19 (\"Medical Horrorshow\") has been updated to include a search-and-trace function for any references to SCP-5207 or similarly-described events.\n\nThe SCP-5207-1-10 instances are to be kept sedated and held within an expanded humanoid containment cell in the Medical Containment wing of Site-17. They are to be fed intravenously, and a system of colostomy bags & urea catheters has been set up to capture any resulting waste. \n\nThe corpse of SCP-5207-11 is currently held in stasis within a Biological Cryogenics containment vessel located in the Biological Storage sublevel 2 at Site-17.\n\nAny further requests for psychic or telepathic research into the SCP-5207 phenomenon utilizing the SCP-5207-# iterations must be submitted in writing to the current HMCL Supervisor.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\nSCP-5207 is an exceptionally complex carnomantic ritual that resulted in the rapid conjoining and transformation of ten living and one deceased human individuals designated SCP-5207-1-10 & SCP-5207-11, respectively. The eleven individuals are former low-level members of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-2408 GoI-0432 (\"The Hunter's Black Lodge\")], a criminal organization with ties to both the Russian Mafia and with various [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sarkicism-hub Neo-Sarkic cults.] \n\nEach SCP-5207 instance suffers from severe transfiguration and deformations that occurred rapidly during the SCP-5207 process. While the initial medical assessment rendered at the scene stated that this \"amalgamated entity\" would be terminal outside of a few hours, the entity remains in a medically stable state due to unknown anomalous means.\n\nSCP-5207-11 was deceased upon recovery; after containment procedures were enacted, it was surgically removed from the main body of the SCP-5207 entity and an autopsy was performed.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ SCP-5207-11 Autopsy Results ■\" hide=\"□ SCP-5207-11 Autopsy Results □\"]]\n\n**Date:** 1997/05/19\n\n**Subject:** SCP-5207-11\n\n**Operator:** Dr. Niel Shultz \n------\n**Sex:** Male\n**Body Weight:** 83.9 kg\n**Height:** 176 cm\n**BMI:** 20.5\n**Brain Weight:** 1.65 kg\n------\n**Internal/External Examination -**\nSCP-5207-11 has several extensive biological transformations, none of which show external signs of cause, principally no surgical scarring or bruising present. These transformations are as follows:\n\n* SCP-5207-11's maxilla, mandible, and zygomatic bone structures had been separated from the skull and moved forward 14.6 cm, which has resulted in giving the face an elongated appearance. \n* Both of the subject's central incisors have been elongated, approximately 7.8 cm. Of note, the right incisor appears to have pierced the lower lip as it enlarged, which is an indicator of rapid and unexpected growth.\n* The cartilage in the ears has been flayed vertically and separated to give the subject large, round ears. This occurred without the removal of the skin, which displays hyperelasticity to accommodate the transfigurations.\n* Subject suffers from extreme dermatochalasis[[footnote]] Loss of elasticity of the upper and lower eyelids causing the skin to sag and bulge, also known as \"baggy eyes.\" [[/footnote]], well beyond expected human parameters.\n* Severe subconjunctival hemorrhaging in both eyes.\n* SCP-5207-11's legs and arms are reconfigured into digitigrade limbs, structured for quadrupedal locomotion.\n* The large intestine has prolapsed and now extends almost its entire length from the anus.[[footnote]]Approximately 128cm.[[/footnote]]\n* Subject's larynx and glottis have been reformed to include an unknown bone structure that would make speech impossible.\n* Two 9 mm bullets were removed from the temporal and frontal lobes respectively.\n\n**Toxicity -**\nNormal\n\n**Cause of Death -**\nSCP-5207-11 expired from 2 gunshot wounds to the right temple and forehead. Due to the differences in adaptation displayed by the other SCP-5207 instances, it is hypothesized that the transfiguration occurred posthumously.\n\n[[=]]\n[[html]]\n<img src=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/local--files/scp-5207/medical\" style=\"height:75px; width:75px; padding-left: 0%;\">\n[[/html]]\n[[size smaller]]**Medical Department**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\nMedical evaluations of the remaining SCP-5207 instances show no significant deviation from the transfiguration studied in SCP-5207-11. The carnomatic ritual used to create the SCP-5207 entity left significant thaumaturgical residue, which gives the indication of at least one, though likely several, extremely skilled carnomancers. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nSCP-5207 was found on May 18th, 1995 in the top floor penthouse of an upscale hotel and residential tower in the metropolitan core of Houston, TX. The penthouse had been utilized as a temporary holding location for a group of former Hunter's Black Lodge members who were set to testify the following morning in the trial of suspected Russian mob boss Subotin Pavel (\"Pasha\") Pavlovich.\n\nHotel management, in a call placed from the hotel to the local police precinct, had complained of several gunshots coming from the penthouse. This call was subsequently, and incorrectly, routed to Unit 14, a uniformed patrol team stationed in downtown Houston. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"● HPD Video Log ●\" hide=\"○ HPD Video Log ○\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Unit 14 is walking towards the hotel entrance.]//\n\n**Remirez:** //[Radio Click]// Dispatch, this is Unit 14.

The 10 living instances let out a shriek of distress as their connective intestines pull further from their anuses. Unit 14 rushes to the elevator, Приветствую Короля Крыс[[footnote]]All Hail the Rat King[[/footnote]] can be seen scrawled across the wall next to the elevator.]//\n\n**Hanlon:** Shit, shit, shit– come on!\n\n//[Hanlon frantically presses the elevator's call button. As the elevator doors open, Unit 14 runs inside and the SCP-5207 instances can be heard shrieking as they pull SCP-5207-11 free from the door and continue their approach. The elevator doors close.]//\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\nAfter initial discovery, the Houston Police Department contacted the Texas State Police wherein Foundation assets were made aware of SCP-5207. MTF Sigma-66 (\"Steel Veil\") were dispatched to handle the situation. Upon successful containment of the anomaly all witnesses were amnestisized, evidence confiscated, and Cover Story 77HH1 \"Carbon Monoxide Poisoning\" was enacted.\n\nThe investigation of GoI-0432 and Subotin Pavlovich is currently ongoing, and all acquired data is to be made available for cross-reference with the Department of History - Religious GoI Threat Analysis, care of Dr. Judith Low.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 85%]]Act II: //Exierunt ut Vinceret// | [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/memoria-adytum In Memoria, Adytum][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5206]]] | SCP-5207 | [[[SCP-5208]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
