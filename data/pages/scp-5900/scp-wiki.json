The SCP-5900 Containment Director is assigning technicians to replace all damaged components and investigate suspect auxiliaries.\n\nThe Department of Internal Security has opened an investigation. [DATA REDACTED 5/INTSEC]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5900 was an outage of PANOPTICON, lasting for five days from 2022/05/19 12:15 to 2022/05/24 21:20 UTC. During this time, surveillance satellites, Site-07 communications, intelligence processing, and IntSCPFN file sync were inoperable. The full extent and nature of the anomaly are presently unknown.\n\n@@@@\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 5900.1\n+++ {{PANOPTICON PROJECT BRIEF}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n**Project #:** RAISA-31409\n\n**Authorized By:** Overseer Council\n\nPANOPTICON refers to a number of interconnected technological and paratechnological constructs, which collectively enable global oversight.\n\nThe Atreus Satellite Array is a Foundation-launched fleet of modular satellites, with orbits configured to ensure full coverage of the Earth at all times. Each satellite has a surveillance installation (see 4/PANOPTICON/HDW04 for schematics), including X-ray antennas and Kant receivers. They also have several hardpoints for weapons and reality anchor attachments, set at the direction of the Department of Applied Force.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=relay.jpeg |\n    caption=Relay installed at the base of a streetlamp |\n    width=200px\n]]\n\nAdditionally, the Department of Applied Influence's Field Monitoring Division is responsible for the installation and maintenance of over ██ million input devices, including SEP-shielded cameras, microphones, links into existing civilian and government surveillance systems, thaumaturgic particle detectors, and Kant counters.\n\nAll gathered surveillance information is processed at Site-07, located in the Norton Bay off the coast of Alaska. Due to its secure location and increasing role in [[[scp-6781|Foundation archival operations]]], it was established as the headquarters of RAISA in 1970. Fifteen years later, the DEEPWELL backup system entered service there as well.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=site-07.jpeg |\n    caption=Protected Site-07\n]]\n\nRecords are loaded into an anomalous RDBMS (relational database management system) and indexed accordingly. SKYEYE.aic continuously queries this database to look for correlations or abnormalities which may indicate potential extranormal events, objects, or activity by groups of interest.\n\nOn 19██/12/12 a thaumaturgic ritual was performed at the direction of the Overseer Council, resulting in metaphysical anchoring constructs being embedded within areas of the infosphere associated with the Foundation, normalcy, and knowledge.\n\nAs information is duplicated throughout all PANOPTICON nodes with at least three parallel processing sites each, an extended outage is extremely improbable. Combined with the anchoring constructs, the calculated probability of an outage is less than 1 in 10^^24^^.\n\nAll components of the metaphysical anchoring system were found to be active during SCP-5900.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 5900.2\n+++ {{SERVICE LOGS}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\nThe following is a selection of log events submitted to the Site-07 governance mainframe at the incidence of SCP-5900.\n\n||~ Timestamp ||~ Level ||~ Service ||~ Message ||\n|| 16:58:52 || **##green|INFO##** || I/O-BLUE || Initiating automatic containment of thaumaturgic javascript. ||\n|| 16:58:55 || **##green|INFO##** || SCUTTLE || Successfully pinged Site-28. ||\n|| 16:58:57 || **##e69500|WARN##** || KEENEYE.aic || Text transcription appeared to change.
