  "content": "+ **[error image not found]**\n**Class:** -safe-Thaumiel-\n\n**Description:**\nThe only notable thing about how this anomaly looks is the fact that it has the SCP foundation logo on it, as of 1972 no logos have been put on a weapon. \nNothing else odd about its appearance has been discovered.\n\n**Field use:**\n-After many tests, we have deducted that it can hurt other SCPs that are not harmed by regular weapons.\n-This gun's bullets seem exactly the same as those in our standard-use weapons.\n-All Class-D personnel who were shot with it seemed to either pass out or die.",
