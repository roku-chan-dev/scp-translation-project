A sea-green abandoned office building in the southeastern outskirts of Pittsburgh. Next to the water treatment plant, and behind the Hardee's, the one missing the last \"e\" in the sign.\n\nSergei glanced at the sign to confirm - this was the secluded place that his client had mentioned. He winced at the concept - the word \"client\" evoked professionalism, clarity of purpose, and a mutual understanding. In all Sergei's years as a hired gun, none of his clients lacked these qualities. \n\nBut this was no \"client.\" This was an insane person who put an ad on the Deep Web titled, verbatim: \"$400K UP FRONT - I NEED SOMEBODY TO SKIN ME ALIVE RIGHT NOW!!!\" \n\nIf his old familiar branch of the //Bratva// had kept in touch, Sergei would have ignored this ridiculous lead. But the line ran cold these days -- had the Russian Mob just mastered the deadly, newfangled art of ghosting their friends? \n\nMoreover, Sergei had bills to pay. $400,000 was $400,000 - and weirder still, the money had been wired to him ahead of the meeting, right on schedule.\n\nAs Sergei squeezed through the mangled mesh fence to the basement, a crucial piece of last-minute wisdom entered his mind: he hadn't considered this being a set-up. His guard went up in half a second, and he felt all the more naked in the dusty silence of the basement.\n\nSpeaking of naked -- \n\n\"Right on time,\" said his victim, fully unclothed on an old desk. \"Sergei, right? I'm glad you could be the one to see me off.\"\n\nSergei cringed. The client was a bone-thin, red-haired, and decidedly unwashed gentleman of no more than 26 years. \n\nThere wasn't a hint of fear in his pointed, acne-ridden face -- only a gentle smile. His voice led one to believe that the next words out of his mouth would be, \"now, let us pray.\" His body hair spoke otherwise.\n\n//$400,000.// Sergei sighed, and unpacked his duffel bag of torture implements.\n\n\"You are Ollie, yes?\" said Sergei.\n\nA slight nod.\n\n\"Good. Before we start, I have question: why the fuck you do this?\"\n\nOllie sighed. \"There's nothing to be said, Sergei. You have your duty, I have min--\"\n\n\"No, this is stupid. I have added 'why the fuck you do this’ to price tag. You //answer.//\"\n\nOllie clasped his hands together, lost in thought. \"How could I explain this to one such as you...?\"\n\n\"With //words,//\" said Sergei, with a barely perceptible //\"pretentious fuck.\"//\n\n\"Sergei, do you know what a 'furry' is?\"\n\nSergei glanced at his victim's groin. \"Clearly, you do.\"\n\n\"It refers to someone who seeks the path to the final enlightenment,\" said Ollie. \"Only, they focus on //outer// emulation. It's like someone dying of heatstroke in a desert - and, rather than take their shirt off, they add on a sweater that says 'I'm not hot' and think it'll do anything other than worsen their problems. Do you understand?\"\n\n\"No. Also: shut up.\"\n\nOllie grinned, closing his eyes. \"You see, Sergei, I spent so much time on my //fake// fursuit, that I forgot something critical: my //human suit// was still --\"\n\nSergei slapped the chloroform rag in Ollie's face, nearly jamming it down his throat. Crude anesthesia wasn't part of the plan, but the screams would have likely been bad poetry as well.\n\nHe drew the scalpel from his bag, greeting his old friend with a kiss to its flat side...\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Special Stage]]\n[[=]]\n+++ ...w-welcome to ATF. T_T;;;\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that we must announce the death of our beloved CEO Oliver Fawkes, aka Olliefox.\n\nOn November 2nd, 2019, Ollie was found brutally murdered in Pittsburgh at the age of 26. His killer is still at large; for updates, we encourage you to follow the #JusticePwease hashtag on Twitter.\n\nAfter a lengthy discussion on the future of ATF in his absence, we have decided that it just wouldn't be the same without him. (That, and we’re still trying to work out who embezzled $400,000 from the ATF coffers X_X;)\n\nTherefore, after five years of serving the worldwide furry community, Accelerate the Future is closing its doors permanently.\n\nThankies 4 making the past five yeawz da extwa-speciawest yeawz EVAR~ ^w^;; \n~*disbands corporation at you suggestively*~\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Boss Battle]]\nTwo in the morning. Allegheny County medical examiner's office.\n\nCelia never loved doing the night watch at the morgue, especially not during a horrifying murder investigation. Not that she was superstitious - for one thing, she was an atheist, and for another, no ghost could be more disturbing than her old place's roach infestation. \n\nBut the dismembered corpse of Oliver Fawkes in drawer #401, the one marked for cremation after its autopsy, had more... //oomph// to it. To pass by just felt depressing, as if the reminder that someone was skinned alive had broken into her head every time she saw it. It made her skin crawl - and unlike Ollie, she felt all the more lucky to still have such a thing for crawling.\n\nShe sat across from drawer #401 for a while and stared, lost in thought. She'd never even heard of \"furries\" until the news reports, and they seemed innocent enough.\n\nSpeaking of seeming innocent --\n\n//\"...h-hewwo?\"//\n\nCelia jumped. The source of the wheedling voice was unmistakeable -- there was something alive in #401. \n\nThe drawer shook.\n\n//\"Wet me out... pwease no cweamatey...\"//\n\nHer mind screamed every synonym of \"no, stop,\" but her curiosity drove her forward. She jerked the drawer open--\n\n...\n\nFennec fox. //Vulpes zerda.// Smallest member of the canid family. A perfectly formed specimen sat there, its face adorably nuzzled in its tail. Celia smiled, despite herself -- aside from parts of its fur still being wet from human blood (and the fact that this species wasn't native to Pennsylvania) this was a welcome sight. \n\n\"Hey there, little guy,\" she said. \"How'd you get yourself in there?\"\n\nThe fox jumped from its sleep, smiled, and spoke: \"Uwuu, you stiww have //skin?!// Teehee! No wowwies, Imma hewp you get wid of it.“\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
