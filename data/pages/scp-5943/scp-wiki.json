[[footnote]] Due to the fear of BINARY STAR's data storage being full of all SCP-5943 occurrences, BINARY STAR only focuses on the SCP-5943 phenomena which is affecting our solar system.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5943 is a phenomena which has been observed in the solar system and is hypothesized to occur in other advanced systems. SCP-5943 Is the transmissions of signal waves between planets which allows them to communicate between each other.\n\nThe conversations mainly include the planets talking about any threats that they might be faced with.  and at times they might be regular conversations or conversations without known meaning.\n\nDr. Rynhart has been assigned to oversee BINARY STAR's studies of SCP-5943. Any new discoveries about SCP-5943 are to be documented.\n\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5943 was discovered on 2020/4/20 after several unknown transmissions were detected by Dr. Tomer. Dr. Rynhart proposed that BINARY STAR would translate the signal waves which was accepted. After successfully being translated, the file of SCP-5943 was moved into the Beholder Program. All studies on SCP-5943 will be conducted only in said program.\n\n\n**Addendum-01:** After Dr. Rynhart took over the project, SCP-5943 has moved to the [//scp-wiki.wikidot.com/into-the-void-hub: Beholder Program Database.] The rest of this document is stored in The Beholder Program Database, access is only permitted to members of the beholder program or personnel who've gained special access.

Can you, Luna?\n\n**M-1:** Of course, I will do everything for you!\n\n**P-5:** Won't that hurt Luna?\n\n**P-3:** Don't worry Jupiter, she already got struck by many asteroids she's strong enough to survive them! I just don't want the creatures on me to suffer. Although they did cause some trouble for me, I think they have lots of potentials. Anyways how big are the asteroids?\n\n**P-5:** From what I can see, they will cause so little damage you won't notice. But those creatures you're talking about will.\n\n**P-3:** Then it is completely safe for Luna to block them. When will try arrive to me Jupiter?\n\n**P-5:** In about 40 light minutes.[[footnote]] 5 Astronomical Units[[/footnote]]\n\n**P-3:** Thank you, Jupiter.

The probe has BINARY_STAR.AIC files. It will upload any new information and or discoveries to BINARY STAR's database. The probe has built-in Satelite Discs to detect any signals during its study of SCP-5943.
