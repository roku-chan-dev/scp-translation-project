THE DARDICS THEORIZED THAT THE UNIVERSE WAS AS AN INFINITE TAPESTRY, AND SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE WARP AND WEFT OF EXISTENCE.

IT WAS THROUGH THE STUDY OF THIS TEXT THAT THE ANCIENT DARDICS FIRST REALIZED THE EXISTENCE OF OTHER WORLDS. \n\nAND ONCE AN UNFETTERED MIND HAS BEHELD A DISTANT SHORE, ONE IS COMPELLED TO VISIT IT.\n[[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| contents=\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">DEVIANT ARTIFACTS RESEARCH DIVISION</h2>\n<h3 align=\"center\">EOP-8009</h3>\n\n<strong>Esoterica Operational Parameters</strong> #: EOP-8009\n\n<strong>Esoterica Classification:</strong> Alternate-Omega (Temporal/Multiversal/Existential) <s>Exploratory</s> Strategic (see addendum)\n\n<strong>Operational Parameters Summary:</strong> The object in question is a double-doorway, constructed of rowan wood and ash, three meters in height and the same in width, with a depth of two and a half centimeters. The object has hinges of brass and handles made with the same, with a latching locking mechanism constructed of cold iron. Sigils have been carved into the surface of the doors and their shared frame and filled with a mixture of cold iron and grave dirt taken from the final resting place of Magos T__ S__ M___. \n\nThe exact nature of these sigils is not to be described in this document, except to state that they formulate a Level Ten Esoterica describing a conduit between our universe and the alternate universe initially discovered through Supernatural Phenomenon SPC-1764 (\"Alternate Universe Supernatural Phenomenon Casefile”).\n\nThe object in question is inert unless activated. Activation procedures are restricted knowledge, accessible under permission from a First Circle Authority only to personnel who have undergone Level Ten Esoterica training, as well as certification for alternate universe exploration. Personnel must also receive an inoculation blessing immediately before transition, and may be subject to debriefing and exorcism to prevent transmission of disruptive/counterstatic memetics from the alternate dimension.\n\nA warning: as with all alternate universes, there is a risk of cultural shock due to  incompatible social norms. Information isolation protocols are in effect. Maintain Information Security according to the strictures of The Unifier’s teachings (All Praise be to He).\n\n<strong>Operational History:</strong> The impetus for the construction of this object was the discovery of the altered universe “SCP” as detailed in <a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1764\">Supernatural Phenomenon Casefile SPC-1764 </a>, which will hereby be referred to as \"the information anomaly.\" \n\nAlthough Esoteric Warfare responses were put into place following the discovery of Universe SCP, there was an understanding that a policy based on mutually assured destruction was undesirable due to the inability to engage in nuanced and controlled use of force to respond to less-than-apocalyptic threats. For this reason, research was carried out into the creation of a Esoterica Conduit by a DARD research team led by Master Actuarion I__ C__. \n\nEsoterica formulation was completed by the Fifth day of the Tenth Lunarium in the One Thousandth and Fourteenth Year of the United Empire (All Praise be to the Unifier). Esoterica passed review by the High Secretariat on the Tenth day of the same Lunarium and Year. Actual construction of the object in question was further delayed due to budgetary concerns until the following year. Construction began on the Second Day of the Second Lunarium of the One Thousandth and Fifteenth Year of the United Empire (All Praise be to the Unifier), and was completed on the Seventeenth Day of the Eighth Lunarium of the selfsame year.\n\n<strong>Mission Statement:</strong> The purpose of this Esoterica is the exploration of Universe SCP, the cataloguing of the Supernatural Phenomena within, and the establishment of diplomatic relations with the native population.\n\nProject Manager: Master Actuarion I__ C__\nProject Priority: High.\n \n<h6 align=\"right\">So Let it Be Written, So Let it Be Done </h6>\n<h3 align=\"right\">IN THE UNIFIER'S NAME (All Praise be to He)</h3>\n\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n<strong>Mission Statement Update:</strong> Since the discovery of the Information Anomaly and the construction of this Esoterica, the number of Supernatural Phenomena appearing in our world has increased at an ever-increasing rate. In six-twelfths of these cases, the phenomena is confirmed to have originated from Universe SCP. A further three-twelfths are suspected to have originated from the same, but cannot be confirmed to do so. These Supernatural Phenomena include:\n\n<ul>\n<li> A soul-blighting pestilence with no cure.\n<li> A memory-devouring curse that devours the minds of those who comprehend it.\n<li> A dimensional shambler that feeds on the agony of those it tortures.\n<li> A peculiar madness in which the afflicted believes themselves to be a device intended for the purpose of warming stale bread.\n<li> A Killing Rune which compels those who view it to draw it themselves before death, thus spreading its contagion to others.\n</ul>\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\nAll of which are believed to have entered our world through the Information Anomaly.\n\nWhether due to neglect or malice, the inhabitants of Universe SCP are responsible for the deaths of over one hundred of our people: in some cases, souls thousands of years old have been lost forever. All attempts to sever the Information Anomaly linkage between our universes have failed. \n\nThe only recourse left to us is the destruction of Universe SCP and the deaths of all inhabitants therein.\n\nEsoterica classification has been updated from Exploratory to Strategic. Former Project Manager I__ C__ is removed from the project and is to have no further contact with Esoterica.\n\nProject Manager: Grand Unifier M__\nProject Priority: Existential.\n \n<h3 align=\"right\">LET MY WILL BE DONE</h3>\n\n]]\n[[size larger]]\nA LACUNA.

THEY SPLIT INTO MANY DIFFERENT STREAMS, AND REJOIN INTO RIVERS. MANY DIFFERENT WATERS, ALL FLOWING DOWN THE SAME MOUNTAIN TO THE SAME OCEAN.\n\nTHE MOUNTAIN IS EXISTENCE. THE WATER IS TIME. THE STREAM IS OUR WORLD.\n\nIN THIS ANALOGY, THE OTHERWORLD IS A STREAM THAT FLOWS THROUGH POISONED SOIL, BRINGING ITS POISON DOWNSTREAM. IT SEEPS INTO THE SOIL, THROUGH THE GROUND, AND ITS TAINT POISONS OURS. \n\nTHE ONLY HOPE TO SAVE THE RIVER IS TO DAM THE POISONED STREAM.\n\nWOULD YOU WEEP FOR THEM? DO NOT. THE OTHERWORLDER IS A FOUL THING. WRETCHED, STUNTED, AND FLAWED.\n[[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| contents=\n<center><h2>The People of Universe SCP</h2></center>\n<img src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8009/Otherworlder_Skel.png\" alt=\"The Skeletal Remnants of an inhabitant of Universe SCP.\" height=\"500\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" position=\"top\"></center>\n\nAlthough outwardly similar to humanity, the SCPian is as alien to us as a serpent is from a fowl. Their fundamental essence of life is a twisted double-stranded ladder like ours, but the direction of the twist is reversed, and the fundamental components of each rung are as different as night and day. Of particular interest is the endcap structure, akin to our genetic memory structure: these portions of the essence appear to degrade over time, which must result in the complete decay of the structure within one hundred years of birth. This explains the horrifyingly short lifespan of the SCPian, and the wretched decay that plagues them after a few short decades of life.\n\nThe SCPian’s blood uses ferrum as its base, which is responsible for the unusual red color of their blood and the toxic properties of their flesh. Their internal organs are asymmetrical, like ours, but of opposite chirality. They possess analogues to most of our organs, including the cordia, pulmonia, and hepatia. They lack the oral venom gland and oculus tertium. Their bones are made of calx, making them hard, but brittle compared to ours. Their eyes lack a nightshine layer, giving them poor night vision. Internal structure of the ear is similar to ours, but the auricle is truncated and unarticulated, resulting in poor directional hearing. Their hands and feet have five digits of three joints each. Their skin ranges in tone from charcoal-black to a pallid pink. Their height averages a mere four cubis, their weight around ten petrela.\n\nAlthough their physical form resembles ours, their metaphysics are closer to beast or vegetable than human. They emit no soul-fire: in fact, they will wither and die in the presence of that holy light. With the rare exception, SCPians are completely incapable of any sort of working: they have no gods, anchorum, or magi among them. The current belief is that SCPians are, in fact, soulless beasts without divine spark.\n\nOne might conclude that the SCPian represents no threat to us until one considers the nature of the reproductive systems. A mere decade and a half suffices for an infant to reach reproductive maturity, following which the female engages in a rapid cycle of monthly estrus. Males are perpetually fertile as well, requiring only a single donation of essence for the female to achieve conception. Witness the fact that despite their short lifespans, the reported SCPian population expands quickly, and will exceed one billion in a mere few centuries.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\n<center><h2>SCPian Weaponry</h2></center>\n<img src=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8009/alchemical_bow.png\" alt=\"A diagram showing the internal workings of a SCPian Alchemical Bow.\" width=\"500\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" position=\"top\">\n\nThe standard armament of the SCPian is the alchemical bow. Similar to the ring-bow, this weapon propels a projectile at high speed into the foe. Unlike the ring-bow, this weapon relies on an alchemical reaction caused by the ignition of a greyish powder which burns rapidly when exposed to fire. Through the burning of this powder, great quantities of a caustic gas are released, the pressure of which propels a small tapered projectile down a spiral-cut tube, imparting a spin which serves similar purpose to an arrow’s fletching, increasing its accuracy during flight.\n\n<br class=\"page-break\">\nWithout motive telekinetic force from the user to reload the weapon, the alchemical bow instead relies on a cunning system of moving linkages, tapping part of the energy from the projectile’s firing into a mechanism which automatically replaces the spent projectile with a fresh one held in a spring-loaded box attached to the weapon. Several of these spring-loaded boxes are carried by Otherlander soldiers, and through rapid removal and replacement of these boxes, the weapon can be returned to operation more swiftly than a ring-bow.\n\nShould you encounter an alchemic bow, handle it with care, for it is forged of hot iron, and the projectiles themselves made of toxic plumbum with a copper casing. Should one be injured by an alchemic projectile, it is imperative that the toxic projectile be removed immediately, or the plumbum within will kill the victim’s soul within hours. Such is the treachery and cruelty of the soulless ones!\n\nIn addition to the alchemical bow, the SCPian wears garments of strong fiber, woven fine enough to halt an arrow in its tracks, reinforced with a lightweight porcelain plate cuirass over the chest and back. Many SCPian soldiers also carry a crude but serviceable steel knife: although incapable of penetrating starsilk garments, this weapon is still capable of cutting human throats. Do not approach a seemingly dead SCPian without first confirming that they are dead, for like a cunning beast, they are fond of feigning death to lure us to within knife range.\n\nThe following weapons are more rarely seen among the SCPians, who seem to issue them willy-nilly to individual soldiers. Most often seen is the tube-Arquebus, which hurls canisters filled with explosive or toxic alchemy through a similar mechanism to the alchemical bow. These weapons are often carried suspended under the alchemical bow, and appear to be carried by serjeants and chosen men. Target these individuals when possible. \n\nAnother (more fearful) weapon is the explosive lance, which can penetrate dragonhide from a distance of many leagues. This weapon is characterized by the large launching tube braced on the shoulder, which contains the lance within. Like the alchemical bow, this weapon relies on the ignition of flammable powders to propel the projectile. Unlike the alchemical bow, the explosive lance’s projectiles contain a cunning mechanism which guides it to the target from a great distance: this device is capable of altering direction mid-flight, and can even strike from an advantageous angle to penetrate weaknesses in the target’s armor.\n]]\n\n[[size larger]]\nSEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE IN THIS ACCOUNT.\n\nFIRST: THE OTHERWORLDERS WERE BELIEVED TO HAVE NO GODS, ANCHORUM, OR MAGI AMONG THEM.

THOSE MAGES AMONG THEM WHO DO EXIST MUST FORM THEIR WORKINGS SURROUNDED BY BILLIONS OF ANCHORUM WHOSE WILLS UNCONSCIOUSLY OPPOSE EVERY WORK THEY WOULD PERFORM.\n\nAS FOR THEIR GODS: THE OTHERWORLDERS HAD GODS IN THE PAST. THEN THEY LEARNED TO KILL THEM. NOW, THE FEW GODS WHO WOULD RISE AMONG THEM ARE HUNTED AND DIE BEFORE APOTHEOSIS. \n\n**THIS IS THE NIGHTMARE THAT IS THE OTHERWORLD:** A WORLD DEVOID OF SOULS, WHERE THE DRONING OF EIGHT BILLION WHINING VOICES ECHO FROM EVERY CORNER OF EXISTENCE. BILLIONS OF SOULLESS VERMIN, LIVING IN BODIES THAT ROT FROM THE INSIDE THE MOMENT THEY ARE BORN. VERMIN PLAGUED BY WRETCHED DISEASES, WARRING AMONG THEMSELVES IN FILTH AND SQUALOR BEFORE DYING AND TURNING TO ROT. VERMIN WHO SLAY THEIR GODS AND WORSHIP THE CORPSES OF THAT WHICH THEY KILL.\n\n[[/size]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| contents=\nLet the words of my mouth sing the praise of a brave man. \n\nI sing to you of the death of Sirah Alamande Ulryc, Chevalier of the Unifier’s Knights. Son of Chevaliera Tsuling Ulryc, who forged his helix in her womb, bore him under her heart for a score of years, birthed him under the light of the three moons, raised him into manhood over ten-score years before he earned his name. Sirah Alamande, mighty in battle, master of the sword and lance, a wielder of sacred fire. Sirah Alamande, whose steed was Wotanna the Red and whose blade was Responsum, The Taker of Souls. Sirah Alamande, snow-white of hair and violet of eye, whose skin, it is said, shone like lapis lazuli, whose fair face and fairer words earned the hand and heart of Ofelya Mendal. Sirah Alamande, father to none, whose helix is now lost to us, lost at the hands of the vermin Otherworlders in the five thousand and seventh year of Our Unifier’s Empire.\n\nTwenty-score and seventeen years had Sirah Alamande lived when he first stepped through the archway into the Otherworld. Though brave in battle and feared in war, Sirah Ulrich came as a messenger of peace, bearing a flag of truce stained with his own blood. Clad in the black of peace, his face hidden, he stained the titanium of his sabatons with the mud and filth of that foul place, but the corruption of the Otherworld’s earth could not corrupt his pure heart. Five-score were the Otherworlders who came to meet him, clad in poisonous iron, wielding spears and swords made of the same. Sirah Alamande feared them not, but called out to them, offering peace. \n\nAlas! Curses be upon the treacherous Otherlanders, whose hearts are as black as their garb! Poisoned arrows did they fire from their bows at the words of the brave Chevalier, and though their ferrum arrows could not pierce his armor, the foul vapors still sapped his strength. Three score blows did he bear and did not strike out against his foe, but instead repeated his plea for peace. In response, the Otherlanders did spur their four-legged steeds into battle, and lowered their lances. Sirah Alamande reached out with sacred fire to turn them away, but the ferum of their armor did turn away his magic, and the lances did pierce his body most cruelly.\n\nNow comes the brave Capitaine, Michayla Teichts, a mighty hunter of men and beast alike. Dark of hair and eye was she, and skilled in blade and ring-bow. It was she whose arrows struck down the Queen of Foxes at the feast of blood and lights, she who held the line at the Battle of the Broken Bridge. Bravely she advanced through the doorway, leading three Rangers of her company. She shields herself from the foul bolts of the foe with pavise, but she cannot reach the fallen Chevalier. With regret do the Rangers place arrow to ring and fire. Swiftly did the Capitaine and her Rangers strike out against the foe, felling a score of them with their arrows, so that Eligos himself would nod approval at their war-craft. But the Otherlanders return fire with arrows tipped with poison, and the ferum vapors sap their strength.\n\nSorely wounded, Capitaine Teichts does order a full retreat. Bearing the fallen Sirah Ulryc upon their litter, she and her Rangers return to our world.\n\nThus ended the life of Sirah Alamande Ulryc. Weep for his death, for the broken heart of Lady Ofelya, for the children who will not be born and the millenia of life left unlived. Weep for the death of a brave man, and curses be upon the vermin who slew him.]]\n[[size large]]\n\nIS THIS WHO YOU WOULD PROTECT, OH CHILD OF THE TRAITOR?
