By popular demand, welcome to our Valentine’s contest.\n\nThe criteria for this contest is very simple: Your article must be based around the theme of **romance**. That’s it - no hard and fast rules on what that might mean, but it is subject to judge interpretation.\n\n**Posting begins on Valentine’s Day, February 14 at midnight EST and ends on February 21 midnight EST. The reading/voting period ends on February 28 at midnight EST.**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"RULES\" hide=\"HIDE\"]]\n__RULES:__\n\n> 1) Your entry must fit into the theme of **romance**.\n> \n> 2) Your article must be a solo effort - no collaborations for this contest.\n> \n> 3) Any format is allowed! SCP, tale, GOI, et cetera.\n> \n> 4) Placement in the contest is ranked by the number of upvotes at the end of the voting period.\n> \n> 5) Articles must be new - please write something new and original for this contest, don't take already in-progress drafts and finish them. We want everyone to start on an even playing field.\n> \n> 6) Your article must maintain at least a +20 rating by the end to be considered for the prize. If none maintain this rating, none win. This is a challenge - put your best effort in!\n> \n> 7) Do not make significant edits to your article after posting - SPaG edits are fine, but nothing larger.\n> \n> 8) You can only post **ONE** article as your entry.\n> \n> 9) Please tag your entry with {{cupid2021}} when posting.\n> \n> 10) Articles are subject to the usual deletion process.\n> \n> 11) This is **NOT** a smut contest.
