In the distant Americas, for instance, in each emergent state, a title was given. As the ugly American experiment continues, so do both Native and Vasasoonenütä lose their land.\n\nAmongst the Unseeing, Bigfoot is the most common name for the honored people I discuss  A fitting name if one only considers the surface and little else, as the Unseeing are so delicately trained to do by the Manipulators.\n\nSasquatch, Yeren, Yeti, Orang Pendak, Mapinguari. Titles all, but none they claim, and none that truly speak to the core of their being.\n\nTheir chosen names are the Mountain Keepers. Siblings of the Deep Wood.\n\nYet the name given to them by the Knowing, whether Heretic or Kin, has claimed them longer than any other: The Children of the Night.\n\nJoined with the whisper of \"Monsters.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontainer\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"rmposttitle\"]]\n[[image ]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostmobiletitle\"]]\nLa Rue Macabre\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontent\"\n]]\nDo we Nälkä not know the power of a name?\n\nThe sting of prejudice and alienation spread by those that deign never to walk our path?\n\nA curse spat by both heathen Mekhanite and sly Manipulator has stolen the face of our long and venerable faith, our culture!\n\nProto-Sarkic, Neo-Sarkic, our divisions are cataloged by the tongue of the enemy!\n\nAnd so, too, have the Vasasoonenütä been given a moniker they have no wish to claim.\n\nFor as \"Sarkic\" is a name meant to convey the carnal \"impurity\" of our way of life in the eyes of those Metal-fiending Mekhanites, so too was Children of Night meant to engender fear.\n\nIn time, it would come to deem them true enemies of the Children of the Sun, but I will speak more on this later.\n\nInstead, I say we offer them the titles our ancestors gave them in a time largely scattered to mythos: The Flesh Forgers, the Lost Shepherds, the Ozi̮rmok's[[footnote]]The Sarkic word for  Grand Karcist, referencing their supposed Messiah.[[/footnote]] Guides.\n\nIf, of course, they seek to claim any more titles, except the one they gave us: Vasasoonenütä. \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontainer\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"rmposttitle\"]]\n[[image ]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostmobiletitle\"]]\nLa Rue Macabre\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontent\"\n]]\n**Truth the Second: The Truth of Flesh**\n\nThe Vasasoonenütä regularly stand taller than humans not shaped by Lihakut'ak[[footnote]]The term Sarkics give their process of altering and augmenting corporeal forms.

Aided, of course, by the large feet that the Unseeing have taken such a fascination with. More important are their wide eyes, most commonly tinted brown, that allow them a full breadth of vision even during moonless nights.\n\nThey are girded in fur of black, brown, grey, white, and occasionally red.\n\nOf course, as is known to us, the environment shapes the Flesh, so particular features were adapted amongst particular Clans.\n\nThe Children of the Forest have wide feet and fur that moss takes to quickly, allowing them to hide in plain sight amongst the trunks of their homes in the Western Americas.\n\nThe Mountain Keepers have layered white fur, deep black skin, and clawed appendages to aid in their scaling of the dread Himalaya Mounts.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontainer\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"rmposttitle\"]]\n[[image ]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostmobiletitle\"]]\nLa Rue Macabre\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"rmpostcontent\"\n]]\nAnd the noble Almas, [[footnote]]A furred hominid reported amongst the mountains of Central Asia & Siberia.

There you can find the Canid-Faced Hunters[[footnote]]The Dogmen of Michigan State, perhaps?[[/footnote]] of the Great Lakes and the headless beasts that haunt valleys of newborn West Virginia.\n\nThe keen amongst you will have noticed I chose to say adapted. Not evolved, as is the nature of most beings born of the Flesh.\n\nFor that is what they did. They adapted themselves to the world around them, shaping themselves as easily as they shaped it. See, know the truth the Elders have gleaned, and demand I share with all Kin. There was another before we Nälkä were charged with the responsibilities of the Will and the Shepherd.

A land untainted by the touch of the Mechanism. Flora and Fauna Sheparded into all manner of fantastical shapes.\n\nTheir cities spanned every continent, towering edifices of bone, marrow-glass, and blood-infused wood that rose ever reaching to touch the stars above. A city of Kiraaks[[footnote]] Living buildings, considered holy, crafted from the body of a single individual. A truly torturous and graphic process surely.[[/footnote]], living, breathing, and growing under the careful hand of the Vasasoonenütä.\n\nAnd while it is fair that they reached this pinnacle not by worship or mysticism but by their own keen-minded curiosity.

This makes quite a few of the claims about their dark apotheosis and cruelty in their age laughable.

It was a fountain of opportunity from which to breed and shape new wonders of Flesh Forging.\n\nThey even shaped themselves to better work with the world around them. Gardners, with their pollen sacks and their pruning claws. Warriors of high stature, keen smell, and fanged maws, seeking to hunt any that would threaten their paradise.\n\nAnd in these preserves, isolated and used much as any other animal on earth, could be found our Ancestors.\n\nThe Children of the Sun would lead us to believe that the Vasasoonenütä hunted us relentlessly.
