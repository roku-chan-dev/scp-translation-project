Ownership of its works has been passed on to the Wilhelm estate. All known public recordings of SCP-8308's livestream have been deleted.\n\nSCP-8308 is contained within a standard humanoid containment cell. Should SCP-8308 become responsive at any point, Site Director Richard Donn is to be notified immediately.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8308 is Tony Wilhelm, author of ██ novels in the 'pulp fantasy' genre. It assertedly has the ability to perceive other realities, which highly resemble SCP-8308's novels. However, it is currently unknown how much of its work was inspired by its visions. The exact mechanisms and limits of SCP-8308's abilities are also unknown.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8308/scp-8000-el.jpg|caption=SCP-8308 at the beginning of its livestream]]\n\nOn 02/12/2024, SCP-8308 began a livestream on the social media platform ██████, which it began by announcing that it would be writing its next novel over the next week. It then began to narrate a chronological sequel to its previous work, //The Mourner's Magiks//, in extreme, monotonous detail, which did not fit its previous style of writing. Throughout this narration, it looked directly at its webcam, did not blink, and took no breaks whatsoever.\n\nOn 05/12/2024, approximately 87 hours from the beginning of SCP-8308's livestream, Foundation webcrawler Memo-02 (\"Marathon\") alerted the local Site-309 to its unusual activity. After some deliberation, the livestream was shut down and an investigation proceeded.\n\n@@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Recovery\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-8308 was found at its home in Poplar Grove, Illinois, where it was still narrating its novel to its webcam, seemingly unaware that its access to the ██████ streaming platform had been blocked. Despite not having moved for around 90 hours, it did not show any signs of having urinated or otherwise dirtied himself.\n\nSCP-8308, which continued its narration, did not react to any Foundation agents' attempts at communication as it was brought to a Site-309 Kant [[[and-this-one-explains-humes |Hume]]] Imager, where a Hume level of ~340 was observed localized within its brain. This level did not change until approximately 34 hours later, at which it dropped to a baseline, nonanomalous level as SCP-8308 stopped narrating. Notably, this final narration did not bring any narrative conclusion to the story of the sequel, instead stopping in the middle of a dialogue exchange.\n\nDr. Noah Addams was then able to conduct an interview with SCP-8308, which became responsive.\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Mr. Wilhelm?\n\n**SCP-8308:** Hmm? Ah, this is different. Quite different. And not quite what I'm looking for. But I suppose I can always expand my range.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** ...Tony? I'd like to ask you--\n\n**SCP-8308:** Not sure if my publisher will like it, though.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Mr. Wilhelm, please. I'd like to ask you some questions.\n\n**SCP-8308:** Ah, wait...\n\n//SCP-8308 looks to its sides, then at Dr. Addams.//\n\n**SCP-8308:** It seems like I'm here, then. You seem important. Dignified. Royalty, perhaps? What was it you said, your highness?\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Dr. Addams is fine. I wanted to know more about your livestream, specifically--\n\n**SCP-8308:** Oh, yes! My //look// into the wonderful world of Descotes. It's one of my favorites, even if not many exciting events happen.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Why did you decide to livestream this... so-called look?  \n\n**SCP-8308:** Creative processes are everything these days. I just wanted to share mine. Surely a woman of your stature should understand. You must show the little ones your own process, sometimes. To demonstrate.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Demonstrate what?\n\n//SCP-8308 points to himself.//\n\n**SCP-8308:** The //gap.//\n\n//Dr. Addams pauses for a moment.//\n\n**Dr. Addams:** I see. And can you tell me your process?\n\n//SCP-8308 raises an eyebrow.//\n\n**SCP-8308:** I'd prefer not to.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Wh-- what do you mean?\n\n**SCP-8308:** I'd really rather not.  \n\n\n[[=]]\n**<End Log>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8308 became unresponsive for the rest of the interview. Upon being escorted to a containment cell, SCP-8308 sat in a chair and has since remained motionless, showing no need to blink, eat, drink, urinate, or defecate.\n\nDue to the hypothetical nature of SCP-8308's abilities, further investigations & interviews have been attempted. However, SCP-8308 has shown to be immune to amnestics, psychic suggestion (through both paratechnology and/or reality-bending), memetics, and other miscellaneous anomalous measures.\n\nOn 14/03/2025, during a routine inspection within the Site-309 Kant Hume Imager, SCP-8308 became responsive for a moment, and the Hume levels localized within SCP-8308's brain rapidly elevated to around ~360. It closed its eyes, opened its mouth, then shook its head. SCP-8308 then spoke:\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\nI'd prefer not to anymore. Not here.\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8308 has been unresponsive since.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-8307]]] | SCP-8308 | [[[SCP-8309]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Ellie3]]\n\n> **Filename:** scp-8308-el.jpg\n> **Name:** Webcams suck\n> **Author:** Stephen Douglas\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/stephen_douglas/94530118 Flickr]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
