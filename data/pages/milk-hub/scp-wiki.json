It is industrial in every sense of the word. The act of milking has become fully mechanized. Animal husbandry has been distilled to a science. Complex networks of dairy conglomerates (which are practically governments unto themselves) transport milk products from farm to table and across the world.\n\n[[div class=\"indented end-mark\"]]\nBut the modern-day braiding of the dairy industry with institutions of law and governance is only the latest iteration of a practice that began at the dawn of human history.\n\nWhat remains unclear is how long ago the human species first started cultivating animals for the purpose of harvesting their milk. It is highly likely that the first humans aware of milk-drinking had become so after observing the interactions between mother animals and their young. However, it is unnatural that human beings can drink milk at all. Most adult humans — except for select groups in Europe and the Middle East that exhibit rare genetic mutations — have lactose intolerance.\n\nYet this biological inability for humans (past the age of early adolescence) to digest milk did not stop modern humans from continuing to do so. Milk was an incredibly useful nutrition source. It was renewable and did not hurt or kill the animals that produced it. Furthermore, milk had a higher energy density than water, and, crucially, tended to be safer than water, which was not potable unless boiled. There were early evolutionary pressures to learn how to drink milk, thereby further developing the ability to do so via evolution.\n\nThe availability of the milk-producing animal bridged the gap between the nomad and the farmer. Both nomadic and sedentary cultures tended milk-producing creatures — be they cows, goats, or camels — for the purpose of harvesting their milk. For the nomad, milk was portable; for the farmer, it was clean. In this way, milk motivated the establishment of social structures that incentivized the safe and reliable production of itself. Therefore, milk, alongside agriculture and brewing, may have laid the foundations for modern conceptions of the State.\n\nThe human appetite for milk has been insatiable. In the modern era, millions of cows are kept hooked up to milking machines: Kept alive solely to produce milk. Cows are selectively bred for higher milk yields, and governments administer billions of dollars in subsidies to their respective dairy industries.\n\nWe would be remiss not to mention the various plant-based beverages colloquially known as “milks” and “creams” throughout the world. These substitutes for animal milk reflect the dominance of milk as a drink, such that, when it cannot be consumed, a substitute is found. Plant-based milk is inherently less water-consumptive and deleterious to the baseline human digestive system, although this depends on the biological traits of the specific individual.\n\nThe sheer number of milk-producing animals currently being farmed — which are needed to sustain humanity's dependence on the modern lacto–industrial complex — naturally encourages the manifestation of bovine anomalies.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL1]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Livestock\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-594]]] — Electric Sheep\n> Research has been done on the properties of SCP-594 wool, milk, meat, and horn.

Consuming milk, therefore, instinctively recalls the experience of breastfeeding. It is a fundamental reminder of the second home after the womb: The mother's bosom. Indeed, even after being weaned from the teat, the human being often desires to return to it, thereby becoming trapped in endless epicycles of return to the womb. The societal association between milk and motherhood entwines milk with conceptions of femininity and its own role in society.\n\n[[div class=\"indented end-mark\"]]\nIt is interesting that the human newborn instinctively knows the smell of the mother's nipple: When it is placed near a woman's nipple, it instinctively heads towards it and seeks to feed. The attraction to milk is located within the human species — within all mammals. This trait is so central to the class Mammalia that it is, thus, named after the mammary.\n\nWhereas most animals stop drinking their mothers' milk after early infancy, the human creature continues. However, the human being does not drink its own mother's milk in perpetuity; instead, it drinks the milk of other species. In effect, the human being has tied itself to the womb, tied itself to the nipple, tied itself to the teat so firmly that it replaces its own mother with another animal.\n\nEven so, motherhood plays a vital role in human societies. Let us consider the discredited thoughts of Sigmund Freud. Freud, infamously, was known for desiring his own mother, and described such desires in detail. Crucially, Freud had not been weaned by his mother, but instead by a wet nurse, and when he gazed upon his mother's breasts, he became aroused. He was deprived of a deeply human experience by the realities of the society in which he lived. A society that, at the time, demanded mothers pass the duty of feeding their children onto those of a lower class — ergo, the commodification of milk production.\n\nWe are all products of the societies in which we live, and the role of the mother differs in each. Even so, because Freud was plumbing theories of the mind where none yet existed, he came to believe that his experiences of milk and motherhood were universal when, indeed, they were a product of his society.\n\nIn our modern era, the breast remains associated with milk along another dimension — a sexual one. Foundation web crawlers detect, passively, an incredibly high frequency of the phrase “mommy milkers” as one of desire. Indeed, milk is tied with both motherhood and fecundity.\n\nThe role of the mother in today's societies is under constant flux. In our post-Fordist capitalist society, the archetypes of the working mother, the high-powered business executive mother, and the sexually objectified mother of other people, have all become increasingly common, even as those who express desire towards such archetypical roles do so in modes of behavior that hearken back to their infancy. As the noöspheric links that connect milk, motherhood, and sexuality continue to shift, increasingly unpredictable containment challenges shall arise.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL2]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Motherhood\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-058]]] — Heart of Darkness\n> **SCP-058:** Nightshade is shadows in all honest blinks that sort through the bile of newborn plagues, instant warmth is a mother's milk in dreams before anything was ever evil.\n\n= [[[SCP-395]]] — The Bottle Baby\n> When a female human comes within 5 meters of the jar, SCP-395 is able to telepathically influence her.

It is the drink that bridges both mundane and supernal realms.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL3]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Ritualism (Extramundane)\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-562]]] — Revel Rousers\n> Those subject to 562-Claim events are found dead in the nearest old-growth forest at some point between four and eight years later.

Milk serves multiple purposes in the household: It is drunken in the mornings, as part of a balanced meal; it is drunken after physical exertion, to enhance muscular growth; and it is incorporated into a balanced diet overall.\n\n[[div class=\"indented end-mark\"]]\nMilk has been enshrined in the nutritional guidelines of government-backed health organizations, most infamously the USDA Food Pyramid, active from 1992–2005. The Food Pyramid placed milk in an elevated state, to be consumed more rarely than the base of fruit, vegetables, and grain, but more commonly than the luxuries of fat and sugar. In this way, milk occupied a liminal area, elevated from the succor of the common people but debased from traditional offerings to the gods.\n\nIt is fitting, in a sense, that the average American drinks milk or milk derivatives every morning, whether atop cereal or in coffee. Milk is a prominent part of the domestic ritual of breakfast. Globally, the use of milk as daily ritual and foodstuff has even influenced traditionally lactose-intolerant populations, as the popularity of the Taiwanese-originating “boba” — tapioca tea with milk — demonstrates. The population of Earth has incorporated milk into its daily routines of wakefulness.\n\nMilk is also enshrined within certain body-focused subcultures as a readily available source of protein and nutrients. These individuals view milk as possessing a nigh-ambrosial quality, capable of supercharging their attempts at self-transformation. They will often partake in a ritual “chug” of milk, in which they consume as much of the substance as possible in a brief period, in the belief that doing so will enhance the transformation of their muscles.\n\nEven individuals who cannot drink cow or goat's milk may use milk-substitutes, such as plant-based milks, in their daily rituals.\n\nMilk pervades every aspect of modern human civilization. Fittingly, it commonly appears in anomalies intertwined with or arising from the otherwise mundane passage of human life. Although its presence may appear purely incidental at first, Project GALAXIAS monitors any anomalies that place an undue importance on milk in a mundane context, should additional containment challenges become necessary.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL4]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Ritualism (Mundane)\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-1067]]] — Tea-making Teaspoons\n> Experimentation shows SCP-1067-d to be capable of fabricating pasteurised cow’s milk upon contact with fluids.

Human societies have produced an incredibly diverse assortment of cheeses. Other milk derivatives, such as cream and butter, and fermented products such as kefir, have also served as the backbones of their respective societies. Modern industrial technology has also allowed for the creation of further-abstracted milk derivatives. It is helpful to understand the role of these byproducts and their relationship with milk itself for the purposes of containment.\n\n[[div class=\"indented end-mark\"]]\nCheese can be understood, at base, as solidified milk proteins curdled and separated from milk liquids. These milk proteins are then treated in a nigh-uncountable number of ways to impart flavor, transform texture, and preserve the food. These transformations are carried out by bacteria, enzymes, and the passage of time. However, this scientific description of cheese-mongering does not capture the importance cheese holds in human societies. Cheeses often become associated with their place of manufacture, which becomes embedded in their identity memeplexes. The most notable instance of this association is Parmesan cheese and Parma, Italy.\n\nOther milk derivatives are considered more for their culinary purposes than as dishes in their own rights. While butter is associated with multiple styles of cuisine, such as American Southern and French cooking, it is known in those cuisines for the sense of luxury it imparts, stemming from the milkfat, but often attributed to the fat itself. This level of processing has abstracted the substance away from the milk memeplex. A similar train of logic can be applied to industrial milk derivatives such as whey protein or coffee creamer. These substances may originate from milk and may carry some of the properties of milk — imbuing strength or imparting luxury — but they are not thought of as milk.\n\nOf all milk derivatives, only cheese is a close enough conceptual neighbor to milk such that containment best practices may be transferable between them. For this reason, Project GALAXIAS keeps a tally of cheese-related anomalies, as there may be a need for increased vigilance as the future draws ever nearer. Future developments in cheese-making may one day create a cheese that is no longer considered a milk derivative, but such a development, should it ever come, is far, far, far into the future.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL5]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Cheese\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-1147]]] — Adaptive Plum Tree\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Substance:** Pasteurized cow's milk.\n**Result:** Trunk is white and stronger than normal wood.

It is biologically pluripotent — its effects on human beings are unpredictable.\n\nThere are indications that it is, effectively, a contagion. When imbibed in sufficient quantities, clown milk can transform human beings into clowns — themselves capable of producing clown milk. This would not usually be a concern on its own, except clowns are apex predators for humanity. Clowns are capable of luring humans, both children and adults, with flashy displays of mystical trickery. [[[herman-fuller-hub|Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting]]] is purported to convert harvested clown milk into cotton candy and other sweets to ensure a steady supply of reliable transformations.\n\nThe speciation of clowns is likewise unclear. There are undeniably sapient clowns — who are rumored to run the modern Circus of the Disquieting — but a substantial body of sub-Veil clown enthusiast literature is based upon treating clowns as nonsapient beings, filling the same niche as show poodles and other such pets. It is unclear whether nonsapient clowns can become sapient, or vice versa. It is unclear whether clown milk plays any role in the creation of nonsapient clowns. It is unclear whether clown milk sold for consumption is harvested from sapient or nonsapient clowns. It is unclear whether clown milk harvested from sapient clowns will always transform human beings into sapient clowns.\n\nClown milk is black and abnormally sweet. It otherwise has the texture of regular milk, and can be considered a one-to-one substitute in most culinary applications.\n\nAlthough its properties are fairly similar to regular milk, it is distant enough from the core lactic memeplex that clown milk anomalies are not expected to fall under the purview of Project GALAXIAS.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[# REL6]]\n\n++++* Related SCP Articles | Clowns\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n|show=+ UNFOLD +\n|hide=− FOLD −\n]]\n\n= [[[SCP-1921]]] — Black Cotton Candy\n> SCP-1921-A3 is a black, highly viscous liquid of unknown composition.

The warriors briskly surrounded her, and grabbed her horns and legs; and the woman, who followed them in their march, made her eyes straight with the eyes of the beast, and whispered something to her in her alien tongue. When the cow had calmed down, Anakara, who had a beard of grey and hair crowned with hawk feathers, stood up from the bonfire, took his hammer in both of his hands, and struck her hard in the abdomen. The horned one roared, and dropped her child, but restrained she could do naught. Anakara then snatched the dagger from his right scabbard, took off the baby's caul, and carefully inserted the blade into their abdomen, cutting the convulsive frail body from top to bottom. After removing the bowels, Anakara unfolded them to their full length and cut guts into short ribbons, which he then wrapped around the arms of as many men as there were ribbons and placed them in the front row. The calf was then burned, and their mother was blinded for the eyes to give to the woman who aided them in their work.//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/milk-hub/milk.png class=\"scene-break milk\"]]\n\nNot every encounter with the Anomalactic has been so straightforward.
