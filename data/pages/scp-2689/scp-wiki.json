Attempts to accumulate other possible instances have been abandoned per order of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED) due to their non-disruptive nature.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-2689 designates a male blood parrot cichlid,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]//Amphilophus citrinellus × Vieja melanurus//[[/span]] more colloquially referred to as \"Percy\" by Foundation personnel. Physically, it is similar to other non-anomalous members of its species.\n\nSCP-2689's main abnormality is its ability to induce a slightly heightened level of motivation and serenity in those who observe the specimen.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]This anomaly is also present in recordings and photographs.[[/span]] This effect lasts for approximately ten minutes following cessation of visual contact. It is presently unknown how SCP-2689 possessed these unusual properties, though investigation into its origins has been denied for the time being.\n\n----\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-2689 was initially obtained at an annual festival that was held within [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sun-talk Prescott Valley,] when Dr. Mayfield won the anomaly at one of the town's stalls. Although, its anomalous properties would not be discovered until her decision to transfer SCP-2689 to Site-169 a week afterward.\n\nAs a result of its relocation, personnel and anomaly morale had increased considerably. Research into the cause revealed SCP-2689's abnormal qualities, subsequently leading to its official designation as an SCP object.\n\n----\n= **Addendum:** Excerpt\n----\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= **>>AUDIO LOG<<**\n----\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a recording log of Drs. Kirby Case and Melissa Mayfield's conversation regarding SCP-2689's retrieval. Footage was taken within the facility's break room.\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//(The two are staring at SCP-2689, which is swimming around in its tank. Case is sipping from their coffee mug while Mayfield is wiping her spectacles.)//\n\n**Case:** So you got this guy at the festival?\n\n**Mayfield:** Hm? Oh, yeah. I got it from a stall. It's a game where you catch fish with a paper net. First try, too.\n\n**Case:** Really now? Good for you.\n\n//(Case pauses then chuckles. Mayfield raises an eyebrow.)//\n\n**Mayfield:** What's so funny?\n\n**Case:** Ah, nothing. It's that… (//chuckles//) I'm just picturing a grown woman like you participating in such a game. Somehow, it fits.\n\n**Mayfield:** Oh, be quiet! Can't a woman enjoy her free time? I managed to scoop up Percy here too.\n\n**Case:** I know, I know. I don't mean to offend.\n\n//(Mayfield puts on her glasses.)//\n\n**Case:** I'm surprised you had the time to even go to the festival. Don't you usually have a tight schedule?\n\n**Mayfield:** I'm not the only counselor here, Kirby. My kindness just overtakes my will for free time.\n\n**Case:** (//Scoffs//) Well, aren't you so noble?\n\n//(The both of them laugh.)//\n\n**Mayfield:** You think there are others like Percy? Shouldn't we do something about that?\n\n**Case:** Ah, no worries. Even if there are similar ones, I doubt they would be a worry any time soon. They're just fishes, after all.\n\n//(Case looks over the various items surrounding SCP-2689's tank: Drawings of the specimen, aquatic-themed decorations, and photographs.)//\n\n**Case:** Besides, it'd break my heart to steal them from other people. We're not the only caretakers out there, you know?\n\n**Mayfield:** Heh, you can say that again.\n\n//(Case takes another sip.)//\n\n**Case:** (//Sighs//) Man, I should really stop and enjoy times like these. Sitting here, having a nice cup of joe—\n\n**Mayfield:** Eyeing on the… hm… the happy fish? Yeah, the happy fish.\n\n**Case:** Very happy fish, indeed.\n\n//(The two laugh, focusing on SCP-2689.)//\n\n**Mayfield:** But yeah, I agree… sometimes it's all about the little things.\n\n//(SCP-2689 briefly faces the both of them before swimming off.)//\n\n**Mayfield:** (//Quietly//) …All the little things in life.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**To:** Site-169 Personnel\n**From:** melissamayfield@169.scip.net\n**Subject:** Event Reminder!\n----\nHello, everyone!\n\nThis is just a reminder that we'll be having an upcoming welcoming party for our dear fish Percy.
