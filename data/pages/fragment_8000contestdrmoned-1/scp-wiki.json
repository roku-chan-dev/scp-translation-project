Any reported anomalous phenomena in these locations are to be immediately contained by a suitable perimeter and investigated for signs of SCP-8125 manifestation. All non-living phenomena are to have a preliminary research report completed, noting any anomalous effects, before exploration is allowed to proceed. Any entities captured are to be transported to the nearby site immediately for questioning and termination if deemed necessary.\n\nAny Wanderer's Library Ways near civilian hubs are to be pre-emptively cordoned off utilising cover stories such as delayed construction or funding cuts. Cooperation with Serpent's Hand members in this area is to be made use of for efficient reaction to any anomalous phenomena that may breach the veil. Due to the ongoing agreement between the Serpent's Hand and the Foundation, any sufficiently near-baseline humanoid is to be relinquished to the Serpent's Hand.\n\nResearch into potential thaumaturgical methods of blocking SCP-8125 manifestations is also ongoing with a joint Foundation and Serpent's Hand task force.\n\nDue to the difference in anomalous phenomena created by SCP-8125, no definitive containment procedures for anomalies can be provided. MTF units are encouraged to suggest potential containment methods and to work with nearby departments specialised in the related subject matter to create suitable methods of containment.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; background: url(https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/theme:basalt/RAISA_LIGHTLOGO.png) center no-repeat; float: center; background-size: 50%; background-color: #f2f2c2;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION\n----\nNumerous departments are working in conjunction with the SCP-8125 research team under Dr Michaels to try and figure out the rules of SCP-8125 manifestations, its creation circumstances, and a reason for the initial deviation from Nx-23 default behaviour. Any new information pertaining to SCP-8125 instances, manifestation similarities, or Nx-23 information is to be sent immediately to Dr Michaels and/or RAISA staff for investigation and categorization.\n\n— Jane Berry, Senior Clerk, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nSCP-8125 is the collective designation for anomalous phenomena resulting from pieces of Nx-23 manifesting in baseline reality. Though the first recorded SCP-8125 manifestation was in 2007, Nx-23 was initially discovered and contained in 1996. It is unknown how many SCP-8125 manifestations, if any, occurred during this earlier period.\n\nSCP-8125 instances share no discernable connecting traits, with distinct phenomena and rules applying to each manifestation documented. The majority of SCP-8125 events lead to stationary, non-living anomalies that can be contained in situ, though several entities have been recovered within these initial phenomena. Questioning of these recovered entities has led to no information on SCP-8125 or Nx-23, with all answers adhering strictly to the narrative that they were a part of. Inquiry into any subject unrelated to the entity's narrative causes confusion and a reported \"fuzzy headache.\"\n\nWhilst cooperation with Serpent's Hand operatives has helped discover and contain numerous Ways into Nx-23, it is believed that many additional Ways are still unknown or contained as unrelated anomalies. A combined task force of RAISA and the history department are currently investigating any SCPs with unclear origins.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum 1: Incident-8125-A__**\n[[/=]]\n----\nThe attached research notes were found in a folder after the disappearance of SCP-8125's lead researcher, Dr Michaels. An additional blank page with \"Nx-23's Creation\" was also within the folder.\n\nDr Michaels was captured on CCTV running out of the Sector 2 toilets, towards the sector elevator and stairway, at 9:22pm on the 18th of May, 2008; though the footage cuts off shortly after. It is unknown at exactly what time Dr Michaels disappeared from the Central-Southern Facility, though he was noted missing the next morning by Chronology Division staff. No footage showing Dr Michaels leaving Site-12 could be found.\n\nAn investigation into the Central-Southern facility's electrical system showed a fault in Sector 3, in a janitorial area of the site. The fault was discovered to be a large humanoid wolf creature fused to both the wall and circuit box, with three small pigs lying dead in an electrified pool of water, likely manifested by an SCP-8125 event.\n\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nWe're fairly sure something must have happened recently that made this phenomenon worse, to cause the regular reality imprinting. I'm 90% certain that we've sporadically had escapees from Nx-23 for a long while, but that's hard to prove without wasting necessary resources.\n\nWhat we can say is SCP-8125 is relatively new, starting in the last 10 years or so. We're 99% sure on that. Areas near Library Ways have always been different, but rarely ever highly anomalous like this.\n\nAlso, it's not the Library itself doing this, or at least, as far as the Serpent's Hand tells us. Luckily, they have no reason to lie, it's screwed with their operations as much, if not more, than ours. It's like stepping outside your door and there's a chance a mine has appeared.\n\nThere are more talks ongoing with the Hand too. They're trying out some new thumaturgy for suppressing the Ways. It seems like clever stuff, went right over my head, so I'll keep my fingers crossed. After they started saying \"seventeenth time's the charm\" my confidence in them did diminish slightly though.\n\nNot that we're any closer to understanding the rules (if there are any) of SCP-8125 either. Max hypothesised that somehow things appearing outside of Nx-23 become more real, becoming part of our reality almost instantaneously. But the samples taken from inside Nx-23 suggest it was always real. No, I think it's about stability, they become more solid, perhaps. Confined to a singular idea. Unlike their state of flux within the Nexus. Though not sure how it relates to them getting through the rituals. Perhaps they're just being forced through a narrow crack with such pressure that any barrier in the way is broken.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nI'm wondering if every SCP-8125 manifestation has a related entity...\n\nWhat am I writing, of course it does, the Prime entity. Could the entity be bringing the narrative with them when they leave Nx-23 and\n\nNo no, that wouldn't work. Why would the rules of the //nexus// and prime beings affect out here, besides, we'd have noticed repeated prime entities appearing repeatedly.\n\nBringing a narrative out seems plausible, somehow being out here gives it the ability to manifest... but what would that narrative manifest as?\n\nAnd all of that doesn't explain why SCP-8125 only got worse recently! Nx-23 was fine for ages. And there doesn't seem to be a change from the inside, from what the remaining internal cameras show. Though it's hard to tell given the constant shifting and dream logic in there. I'd check myself but the risk is too high.\n\nDamn, I feel like I'm missing a large piece of the puzzle.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size 110%]]\n[[div class=\"document\" style=\"margin-bottom: 0px;\"]]\n[[div class=\"architects-daughter-regular\"]]\nWhat if something has changed with Nx-23, it just wasn't perceptible.\n\nWe don't actually know what caused its existence. Maybe that's the missing link. Maybe something messed with that, causing a knock-on effect. The big problem there is that I'm no timeline expert. If it's the health of the timeline that's causing these issues, I'm stumped, especially when I lack this much info/context. Normally I'd be able to somewhat piece stuff together. I guess I could try contacting Vane but he went off to the US to help Xyank with a project.\n\nI'll need to request the original documentation again. Perhaps I'll look through nearby anomaly and site records, to see if anything happened that could've caused it to manifest or become damaged.\n\nIt did initially spread Ways across the globe rather rapidly... as if it was copying something. Perhaps it had a memory of something that it was using, or was it replicating something that existed already? Though once again that happened at the beginning of Nx-23, why would it cause issues now...\n\nI mean hell all the SCP-8125 instances and Nx-23 Ways we know of have been near Wanderer's Library Ways. I know the Serpent's Hand hasn't seen anything but maybe something deep in the library is happening. Seems like an awfully large coincidence otherwise.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/size]]\n\n[[div_ style=\"margin-top= -8px;\"]]\nFollowing the electrical fault, a damage report was compiled showing the impact from both the power outage and the resulting power surge. This report showed large structural damage to the nearby Acroamatic Abatement plant and Southern Facility power plant, necessitating significant rebuilding efforts. Also suggested was the construction of a containment cell for the Nx-23 Way located in the Central-Southern facility, mitigating the effects of any future SCP-8125 events.\n[[/div]]\n\nThe report shows that scientific advancements made since the Abatement facility's construction in 1996 allow for safer, more efficient waste management technology to be utilised in the retrofit. Due to time constraints and the risk of an SCP-8125 event nearby, it is suggested that much of the logistical side of the facility remains unchanged.\n\nDuring the dredging of the primary clarifier to prepare for the retrofit, a semi-decomposed, damaged and extremely bloated human corpse was discovered, identified as the body of Dr Michaels. It is believed that Dr Michaels was crossing a catwalk when the nearby sedimentation tank burst (likely due to the monitoring equipment's loss of power) with the resulting debris knocking him into the grit chamber below. It is still unknown why Dr Michaels was in the Abatement Facility during this time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; padding:5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ **__Addendum 2: SCP-8125 frequency__**\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nA year after Dr Michaels' disappearance, the SCP-8125 research team noted a sharp increase in SCP-8125 events globally. Though the rate of SCP-8125 manifestations seems to have plateaued, with at least one manifestation per month, this is vastly higher than the sub-yearly rate recorded prior. It is unknown if the loss of Dr Michaels is related to this phenomenon.\n\nFor the purpose of investigation into causes, links, or containment stratagems, a compilation of SCP-8125 manifestations since 2007 has been compiled below. Any additions to this document are to be authorized by RAISA personnel.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"◉ Known SCP-8125 Phenomena Documentation ◉\" hide=\"◎ Known SCP-8125 Phenomena Documentation ◎\"]]\n\n----\n\n[[table style=\"margin: 0 10px 0 0;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #96182B;\"]]\nPhenomena ID\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nPhenomena Location and Discovery Date\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nPhenomena Containment Progress\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nPhenomena Description\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding:3px; border: 0px solid silver\" colspan=\"4\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 0px #444444; margin-top: -20px; padding:0.5px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n#8125-07-001\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n21st of June, 2007.

A large lobster-like creature with twenty one leg-like appendages was found dead in a deep chasm at the centre of the manifestation.

Researchers did note an unusual grove of oak trees within the manifestation area. Numerous corpses were discovered near these trees, as if mid-battle. One set of corpses was human, wearing simplistic metal armour, and appeared to be fleeing towards the south. The other entities were also humanoid, but made entirely from wood. These wooden soldiers surrounded the human bodies on three sides, excluding the north.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding:12px; border: 0px dashed silver; border-width: 0px 2px\" colspan=\"4\"]]\n[[div_ style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n... //2 additional entries hidden.// ...\n[[/div]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n#8125-09-0011\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n29th of November, 2009.
