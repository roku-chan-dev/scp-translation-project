The board was spread before them all, miniature figures locked in an eternal battle to the death. \n\n\"Well Sam. It seems as though you're being attacked by a Mage. Best roll and avoid that.\"\n\nSam shuddered, stretched, and tapped a switch. Through one nearby window a slight flickering light was visible.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nFelix glanced through the window, and then looked back at Sam.\n\n\"Congratulations Sam. A sixteen.\"\n\nSam shook himself, horrified, but at least he wasn't dead yet. He hated himself.\n\n\"Alright Harry, your turn again. Try not to cock it up too badly.\"\n\nHarry slid his figure, a cleric, closer to Sam's warrior and directly next to a small goblin enemy.\n\n\"I wanna punch that one right there, if I can.\"\n\n\"Indeed you can Harry. Roll.\"\n\nHarry tipped the switch without hesitation.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\n\"Ooh, too bad Harry. A four. You missed him, and how you managed to is beyond me. Rotten luck. Jeremy?\"\n\nThis was Jeremy's third game, and Felix was quite impressed with that. Normally people had given up by then.\n\n\"Backstab the bastard in front of me.\"\n\n\"Excellent choice. Roll.\"\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\n\"You killed the poor man! Oh dear. Excellent form though, I do appreciate that. Continuing! Sam?\"\n\n\"I- I'd like to attack the same guy as last time.\"\n\n\"Fantastic. Roll.\"\n\nSam froze, his finger on the switch, shaking violently. \n\n\"Come on Sam, we haven't got all day. Roll.\"\n\nSam made a fist, and bashed his hand against the table. He stood, his chair clattering to the floor behind him, and screamed red-faced at Felix.\n\n\"I can't do it! I can't do it anymore! This is awful, how can you do this to people it's outrageous and I won't participate in this for another-\"\n\nSam barely even noticed the taser before he was out cold. \n\nHe awoke in a small concrete room, his orange jumpsuit replaced with a black design bearing a large, white number on the back. \n\n\"Oh no. Oh no no nononono...\"\n\nHe could hear everything through the metal sliding door that made up the entrance to his cell.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nAnd somewhere around the room, the sound of a door banging open, pausing, and slamming shut.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nSam pulled himself together. He would die with dignity. He wasn't here because he had lost, he was here because-\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\nOh God.\n//Click//\n\nNot his door. Not this time.\n\nAnother step closer though. He could hear muffled sobbing.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nAnother door. The one next to his? The anticipation was-\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nThe sobbing was gone. His door didn't open. But Sam knew he was next.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n//Click//\n\nThe door to his cell shot open and the tiny floor inside tilted up, dropping him out into the large circular room beyond. The door slammed shut behind him.\n\nHe looked around the room in a daze. Nineteen other men and women dressed like Sam stood pressed against the walls of the room, staring behind him in a mix of horror and apprehension. A slew of dead bodies in the same suits as theirs lined the walls, their heads twisted into unnatural positions, a look of pure fear locked on their faces, terror etched into their expressions. \n\nBut where was //it//?\n\nSam followed the gazes of the other occupants of the room, towards the door that he presumed had opened before his.\n\nA statue, holding the still-twitching corpse of a woman, frozen in place.\n\nSam wretched, grabbed at his stomach, began to stand-\n\nAnd then the lights went out.\n\n//Click//\n**Crack**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
