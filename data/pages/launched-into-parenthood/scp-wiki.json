The mode through which this instance was produced is unknown as the entity was currently not being observed, and was only noticed during routine inspection for containment purposes hours later. The new SCP-1213-1 instance was removed from the containment vessel at once and placed in the care of Dr. ██████ for study. \n\nAs is typical for Foundation sites during times of increased holiday energy, it is believed that this event is an example of immaculate conception, as SCP-1213 has not had access to other members of its original dimension in several years. However, Dr. ██████ has suggested that this event may be completely natural, pointing out the lack of consensus on SCP-1213's reproductive biology. Further work is required before a full determination is made. However, the following addition to SCP-1213’s file is requested in the meantime:\n\n> **Description of SCP-1213-1:** The recently observed SCP-1213-1 instance is a wooden and rubber catapult of similar design to the larger SCP-1213, although much smaller. Of note, the design of the SCP-1213 instance uses rubber bands as a launching mechanism in place of the steel fittings on SCP-1213, taking an appropriate form for its small size. As a result, the SCP-1213-1 instance has been placed into the care of Sector-25 researchers in order to conduct a longitudinal growth study of the entity to determine more about the biology of the SCP-1213 organism.\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails attachment-end=--\n|name= Dr. Donatello ██████\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n|attachment= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/SCP-1213-1.jpeg\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n|subject= Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n\n]]\nSounds good.

When you do get to them, please also add the following addenda:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Addendum ##:**\nResults of Test #36\n-----\nSCP-1213 and SCP-1213-1 were placed in adjacent rooms during routine sample gathering and testing. During the procedure, junior researchers Smith and MacCallum both noted that each entity displayed unusually high levels of energy at identical times when placed near the connecting wall together. How they knew that the other was present on the other side of the wall is yet to be determined.\n\nDescriptions of Observed Behaviour Changes:\n|| Time || SCP-1213 || SCP-1213-1 ||\n|| 2:35 || Slight arm movement, side-to-side rocking || Jittering arm movement ||\n|| 3:10 || Rapid arm movement, “bouncing” rope || Rapid arm movement, jittering frame ||\n|| 3:20 || Rapid arm movement, “bouncing” rope, wheels spinning in place || Rapid arm movement, jittering frame ||\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. Donatello ██████\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= rchan7@scp.int\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n|subject= Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n]]\nHello Dr. ██████,\n\nUnfortunately, your request is still pending due to a lack of rationale for inclusion of this information in the SCP-1213 file rather than creation of a separate file entirely. New combined-designation requirements are either that the entities are either contained together, containment of one requires containment of the other, or by director approval.\n\nPlease send me either approval from the Sector-25 director or evidence of a reason for combined-containment.\n\nWarm regards,\nDr. Rebecca Chan\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. Rebecca Chan\n|title= Foundation Researcher\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/drchan\n]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= dtjredacted@scp.int\n|to= rchan7@scp.int\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n]]\nHello Dr. Chan,\n\nJim is currently on vacation so I will forward you the results of putting them together.\n\nThanks.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. Donatello ██████\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= dtjredacted@scp.int\n|to= rchan7@scp.int\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n]]\nPlease disregard all prior requests to update the SCP-1213 file with information about SCP-1213-1…\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. Donatello ██████\n|title= Foundation Researcher (Sector-25)\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/Default_Profile_Icon.png\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= sector25_director@scp.int  \n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int \n|cc= rchan7@scp.int\n|subject= Re:Re:Re:Re:Re: Request of Addenda to be added to the SCP-1213 File\n]]\nYou think?\n\nSee me first thing in my office on Monday to discuss why we don’t rush testing procedures.\n\n-Jim\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. James Torres\n|title= Foundation Researcher and Director of Sector 25\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/launched-into-parenthood/drtorres\n]]\n\n++ Appended Record Outside of Primary Email Chain\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= TestingRoom13_donotreply@scp.int\n|to= dtjredacted@scp.int, rchan7@scp.int\n|cc= sector25_director@scp.int\n|subject= Recording from December 24 2024 at 10:12-10:15 in Sector-25 Testing Room 13\n]]\nThis is an automated message from the camera system located in Sector-25 Testing Room 13.
