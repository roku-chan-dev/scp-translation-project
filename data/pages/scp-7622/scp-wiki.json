The following Containment Procedures are tentative and experimental. Final Containment Procedures are to be established by Research Head pending adequate analysis and observation of SCP-7622 & SCP-7622-A.\n\nSCP-7622 is to be convinced that it is currently taking part in a year long, alcohol treatment study along with 6 other non-anomalous participants. SCP-7622 has been given strict instructions to be within Off-Site Containment Block[[footnote]]OSCB[[/footnote]] premises at all times, unless otherwise authorized. Time spent at OSCB, designated ‚ÄúResearch Hours‚Äù shall total 148 hours a week, with the remaining 06:00am - 02:00am, 20-hour period, designated ‚ÄúOff Time‚Äù. Off Time must be requested by SCP-7622 and authorized by Research Staff. During Off Time, SCP-7622 is free to leave OSCB and connect with friends and family. MTF-ùõø-10, ‚ÄúLast Call‚Äù, a joint task force operation, consisting of specialists proficient  in containing and apprehending Green-Type anomalies, shall keep a 3-member, covert mobile surveillance team on SCP-7622 during Off Time. SCP-7622 is to have monthly psychological evaluations with Research Head.\n\nOSCB-7622, a former 9-unit apartment building located 5.6km from Site-52, shall be maintained and monitored via live personnel and CCTV feed to Site-52.

The final unit, OSCB-7622-9, shall function as a laundry room with emergency breach equipment embedded within its walls. MTF members are to act as neighbors and fellow participants within the mock study. \n\nSCP-7622 is to never be administered analgesics, barbiturates, or any local/general anesthetics. The only CNS[[footnote]]Central Nervous System[[/footnote]] depressant/suppressant allowed in SCP-7622‚Äôs system shall be ethyl-alcohol, henceforth referred to as ‚Äúalcohol‚Äù. SCP-7622 shall be in possession of a standard issue BAC[[footnote]]Blood Alcohol Concentration[[/footnote]]-Armband Monitoring System[[footnote]]AMS[[/footnote]] and is to maintain a  BAC of at least .04 at all times, with the only exception being while under the duress of PAR[[footnote]]Post-Alcohol Recovery, i.e. a ‚Äúhangover‚Äù[[/footnote]]. As soon as PAR begins to subside, SCP-7622 is to resume alcohol consumption. SCP-7622, may on its own volition be allowed to partake in caffeine and cannabis consumption, however the attempted use of any other controlled substance, including, but not limited to: Cocaine, MDMA, Psilocybin, and LSD, shall be interrupted and dissuaded by a present MTF member.\n\nShould SCP-7622-A emerge, this would constitute a full containment breach. In such a scenario **PROTOCOL:RELAPSE** shall be initiated[[footnote]] See Addendum-7622-A[[/footnote]].\n\n= [[size 120%]]**__DESCRIPTION:__**[[/size]]\nSCP-7622 is the designation for a 1.8m tall, 73kg, 30 year-old, Caucasian human male named ‚ÄúJD‚Äù, Jack Daniel O‚ÄôKinney. \n\nSCP-7622-A is a semi-active, emerging Class-IV, Phase-3.5, Green-Type[[footnote]]Reality Bender, a term originally used by the GOC, later adopted by the Foundation[[/footnote]] phenomena, that manifests as a subconscious, psychosomatic, onto-telekinetic-protection mechanism from within and independent of SCP-7622. \n[[div class=\"scp-image-block\" style=\"width:200px; float: right;\"]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jaykillbam/enzyme width=\"200px\" height=\"200px\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:200px;\"]]\n**3-D Rendering of SCP-7622‚Äôs ALDH2 enzyme.**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nSCP-7622-A is effectively suppressed from assuming its active state when SCP-7622 is under, or recovering from, the influence of alcohol. The biomechanics of this suppression result from the breakdown of alcohol by way of the ADH[[footnote]]Alcohol dehydrogenase[[/footnote]] enzymic pathway resulting in the formation of acetaldehyde, which is then broken down by the ALDH2[[footnote]]Aldehyde dehydrogenase, most notably the ‚Äúmitochondrial‚Äù form.[[/footnote]] enzymic pathway, and into subsequent acetate[((bibcite ARH))]. Kant-Counter measurements alongside concurrent blood samples, collected from SCP-7622, show that higher concentrations of acetaldehyde and acetate correspond to lower fluctuation readings measured in the Hume Field produced by SCP-7622-A from SCP-7622. \n\nDNA analysis of SCP-7622 reveals that it has a rarified ALDH2 mitochondrial DNA-gene variation that is consistent with findings from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/what-we-know-so-far-answering-the-question-of-what-how-and-w recent studies][((bibcite WWH))] correlating the Green-Type phenomena to the ontokinetic relationship with matter on the quantum level, see: QHT[((bibcite QHT))]. This has given the Foundation more insight to how Green-Types form and function. \n\nCurrently, SCP-7622 is unaware of SCP-7622-A and its dormant abilities. SCP-7622 is extremely cooperative with SCP Staff and Personnel, whom it believes are leaders and fellow members in the mock alcohol study. The Foundation became aware of SCP-7622 following a distress call sent by an on-site field agent from the Surgery Center of Long Beach Memorial Hospital, Long Beach, CA on March 18th, 2020.\n\n= [[size 120%]]**__DISCOVERY & ACQUISITION:__**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **__Incident-7622-18-03-2020__**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Forward:** \nAt 03:13 on March 18th, 2020, SCP-7622 arrived at Long Beach Memorial Hospital‚Äôs Emergency Trauma Unit, via county EMS transport, following a severe motorcycle accident. SCP-7622 at the time of arrival was fully responsive and cooperative with hospital staff, despite suffering critical trauma. Injuries included: 12 rib fractures, 8 right-4 left, a collapse of the right lung, complete fracture of the right clavicle, separation of the shoulder, displacement of right arm socket, second-degree road abrasion on 40% of back epidermis, third-degree road abrasion on 15% of back epidermis, and possible impact concussion.\n= **__Comments from CHP Citation/Record:__**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n‚ÄúMotorist, Caesar Cortez, observed Suspect, Jack D O‚ÄôKinney, speeding up the NB-405 freeway, merging from the carpool (lane-1) to the left-passing (lane-2). Suspect was estimated to be traveling in excess of 90mph[[footnote]]145km[[/footnote]]. Suspect lost control of the vehicle. Both vehicle and rider impacted the roadway. Mr. Cortez claims to have observed a bright red flash of light as the Suspect fell. Mr. Cortez stated that he slowed his car down to offer assistance, however, Suspect had already picked motor-vehicle back up and was riding it off the freeway. Mr. Cortez followed suspect and contacted 911 who intercepted the Suspect at a nearby gas station, where upon officer‚Äôs examination of Suspect‚Äôs injuries, EMS was contacted for transport.‚Äù\n[[/div]]\n\nUpon anesthetic sedation, in preparation for surgery, hospital staff performing pre-op procedures reported noticing a substantial drop in ambient temperature. This temperature difference followed SCP-7622 and the surgical team, led by Dr. Emmanuel Madhi, as they brought SCP-7622 into the surgical unit. From witness testimony provided by hospital staff present at the time, upon Dr. Madhi‚Äôs first incision to address SCP-7622‚Äôs protruding clavicle, the lights began flickering and SCP-7622 began to move. Hospital records show that EKG and O2 readings dropped. SCP-7622 then became mobile, witnesses describe a faint red glow surrounding SCP-7622 as it rose and levitated off the operating table.\n\nWitnesses at the scene recall seeing SCP-7622 raise its hand and began to suspend Dr. Madhi into the air. SCP-7622 then proceeded to throw the doctor against the far wall. Witnesses describe that all the metal within the room began to collapse and fold under some unknown force as SCP-7622 walked through a large circular hole in the near-wall that was not present before the procedure, with said hole closing after SCP-7622 passed through. Hospital security personnel were dispatched to intercept, however, were quickly overwhelmed, their tasers reportedly dissolving/liquifying in their hands and causing severe burns. One SCP field agent, Agent Lincoln Short, was on civilian duty as hospital security, and immediately notified Command.\n\nHigh-Command, aware of a potential Green-Type Threat, immediately sent out a High-Priority Anomaly Acquisition Order to all available MTF agents in the area. MTF-Œû-12[[footnote]]Temporary Rapid Response Team, Codename: ‚ÄúSedation Services‚Äù[[/footnote]] was assembled and dispatched to Long Beach Memorial Hospital within 32 minutes.\n\n= **__MTF-Œû-12 AAO__**\n||||||||||||||||||~ **##darkred|URGENT-BY ORDER MTF-HIGH COMMAND**## ||\n||||< **AAO #:**77701  ||||||||||||= **Distribution:** A-4[[footnote]]All Available Agents in Area[[/footnote]] ||> **Date:**18.03.2020 ||\n||||||||||||||||||**Mission Overview:** Field agents within Long Beach Memorial Hospital have encountered an unidentified Threat.

A few things really stood out. One, the Anomaly was only active //**after**// sedation //**and**// while being penetrated by a foreign object. Two, from the extensive background of the Subject, it seems it has survived many ‚Äúnear death‚Äù events, the Anomaly possibly functioning as a protective mechanism. Three, given that waking the Subject up during the MTF op negated the Anomaly's effect, its is plausible to assume that the two, Subject and Anomaly, function independently. Which leads me to my craziest point‚Ä¶ Four, the Subject uses an inhibitor to suppress the Anomalous phenomena‚Ä¶ Alcohol!\n\nMy thoughts for first interview are to get the Subject hooked up to a blood alcohol monitoring system and see what happens to the Hume around it.\n\nThoughts?\n\n**__Dr. Mari Schmidt, PHD__**\n//Researcher, Secure Facility 52//\n//Ext.52042, LV.3, Office 26//\n//Secure.

Usually at this stage we would clearly know about the Subject, but it has stayed hidden under the radar. Usually by now, we‚Äôd be sending in large scale MTFs and dealing with huge amnesticization campaigns. This Green-Type has its own built in containment, a flaw. A Green-Type that has a flaw is one that we can exploit to not only study how they use their powers, but how they develop.\n\nJust humor me on this okay?

We were maybe seven or eight. I was running around my driveway at full clip, which had on it a steep thirty foot decline. I‚Äôm talking a sharp drop. I wasn‚Äôt paying attention. I was just whizzing around and before I knew it, I had sped off the driveway, with about 12 feet of air between me and the pavement. I started falling, but before I could hit the ground, something caught me, and I‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I flew.

It seems to take interpersonal relationships very emphatically, often blaming itself and the universe for misgivings. What is interesting, besides the one strong example given, is the lack of typical Green-Type evolution. It is possible the medicated state that SCP-7622 was put in during its early years helped suppress early Phase-1 and Phase-2 development. It is, however, unclear how such strong disturbances in the Hume field could come from a completely unpracticed Green-Type. What is very notable from its writing is the concept of SCP-7622‚Äôs ‚ÄúShadow‚Äù entity, and the connection that can be made to Jungian references of the ‚Äúshadow‚Äù[[footnote]]In analytical psychology, the shadow (also known as ego-dystonic complex, repressed id, shadow aspect, or shadow archetype) is an unconscious aspect of the personality that does not correspond with the ego ideal, leading the ego to resist and project the shadow. In short, the shadow is the self's emotional blind spot.[((bibcite Shadow))][[/footnote]]. As Jung has noted, individuals first recognize, then merge with, and ultimately assimilate the Shadow, leading to a full and actualized, evolved self. Next interview will attempt to see if as SCP-7622 matured, so did the SCP-7622-A effect.\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= **__Attached File: SCP-7622 28-03-2020__**\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Open File\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[<]]\nI was maybe seven, maybe eight? All I know is that it was a warm summer‚Äôs night. One of those nights you get in the middle of June, in the north of the eastern seaboard. I remember the sky was dark and full of low hanging clouds, the kind that would reflect the distant city‚Äôs glow. And though there was no rain, the clouds lit up with the heated flashes of angry lightning‚Ä¶ But the bolts never touched the ground, as if the lightning itself, too, was afraid of the brewing war in the downstairs bedroom.\n@@ @@\nMom and Dad were fighting again‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if it was ‚ÄúDad‚Äù, or ‚ÄúDaddy‚Äù then, I don‚Äôt really know, I haven‚Äôt spoken either term for quite some time now, and in the middle of my dreaming, I was awoken by mommy‚Äôs cries for answers and my father‚Äôs pleas for peace. Their quarrelsome banter came up through the floorboards and out of the walls as muffled murmurs. My only hope was that my sister, in her room further down the hall, and further away, slept soundly, innocently unaware. \n@@ @@\nA flash of lightning lit the area behind the curtains and a rumble moved through the house. Unsure of whether it was the weather, or whether or not it was them, I sprang to the window and rolled back the curtains. Being so close to the wall amplified the indistinguishable spats of my parentage, their incessant bickering merged with the sound of the wind outside and together, and howled like damned lamentations. \n@@ @@\nThe fear of of wind, the fear of thunder, the fear of storm, of‚Ä¶ familial dissolution swam madly in my young mind. I decided to do something, I prayed. I prayed to God. The same God my father had. If He had saved me, He could save Us. I prayed for Him to take away the fear, the fear of wind, the fear of thunder, the fear of storm, of dissolution. I prayed for their voices to stop, for them to quiet, for something‚Ä¶ \n@@ @@\nWith my prayer finished, I looked up as a flash of light pierced the sky, and I found it a sign. Had it worked? Had God heard my words? Had I finally found providence? When the sound of thunder rocked the house, I saw a giant towering Shadow against the backdrop of that distant glowing city. All was quiet in the house and the wind had subsided. The Shadow stared at me. I stared back. Was this God? Had I summoned Him? Had I saved my family?\n@@ @@\nI heard my mother wail once again and my father scream, his voice shot through the shaking wall, I heard a door slam, a car start. The wind picked back up and the sky once again filled with sound and illumination. I looked to the Shadow and asked, ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. The Shadow stared back at me and said ‚ÄúYou are not a God. You cannot stop the wind, the thunder, or the oncoming storm.‚Äù \n@@ @@\nI started to weep, I started to cry, and as I did, so did the Shadow, and as It did, It morphed into a vision of myself, until all I could see was my own reflection in the window. \n@@ @@\nI‚Äôve carried the Shadow every day since. \n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= [[size 120%]]**__Interview-2 SCP-7622 26-04-2020__**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Date:** 26-04-2020\n**Time:** 12:15\n**Location:** OSCB-7622-1\n**Research Head:** Dr. Mari Schmidt\n**Research Assistant:** Dr. Morgan Eskew \n**Security Detail:** Sgt.

Where we last left off was early childhood. I want to fast forward to more formative years.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Aren‚Äôt all years formative?\n\n**Schmidt:** In a way, but I want to know about the years where you started to figure out who you wanted to be.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Lady, I still barely know that, but I guess we can start in high school.\n\n**Schmidt:** If that's where you want to take off, go right ahead.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Fine, so, my sister and I were shuffled around from mom to dad, to dad to mom, off and on, sometimes with relatives, sometimes with family friends. We never really found our footing. By middle school I was already drinking pretty proficiently. My grandfather had taught me early on how to make a screwdriver! \n\n**Schmidt:** Why‚Äôs that?\n\n**SCP-7622:** So that he didn‚Äôt have to get up and make it himself, just have me do it.\n\n**Schmidt:** I‚Äôd imagine that would have had a big impact on you.\n\n**SCP-7622:** It helped me more than anything. See, I never went to the same school for more than a year from 6th grade on. When I first entered high school, I was a loner, a weirdo, but I wanted to fit in so bad. So I actively developed a strategy to do so. I would learn how to make really good drinks. What's one thing that all high schoolers want to be a part of?\n\n**Schmidt:** The popular crowd?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Parties!\n\n**Schmidt:** Ah.\n\n**SCP-7622:** So I would study classic cocktails and learn how to balance booze for good drinks, then I‚Äôd go to parties, make amazing punches and such and get people to like me.\n\n**Schmidt:** Seems like you researched your way into the ‚Äúin-crowd‚Äù.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Absolutely!\n\n**Schmidt:** So would you say that mixing cocktails is your way of letting people know you want to be liked by them?\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n**OSCB-7622-1-CCTV-A:** //Schmidt looks at her cocktail.// \n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-7622:** I guess you could say that.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n**OSCB-7622-1-CCTV-A:** //SCP-7622 forcibly blinks with both eyes and then stares at Schmidt for 10 seconds.// \n[[/div]]\n\n**Schmidt:** You‚Äôre staring, weren‚Äôt you taught that it is rude to stare?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Oh yes, I know.

Anything stand out to you?\n\n**SCP-7622:** No, as I got older, I just found myself in strange situations, ones where it almost seemed like I blipped out of reality into‚Ä¶ I‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know how to describe it.\n\n**Schmidt:** Try me.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Like, okay, when I got my first car at 19, it was a Jeep. It was awesome, but not without its flaws. The idle wouldn‚Äôt catch sometimes, so at stoplights and such, I would have to also keep the gas going along with the brake. So this one time, instead of possibly have the car die on me if I stopped, I blew through a yellow light, but the Jeep was top-heavy and started to tailspin. I went off the road, over the sidewalk and almost plummeted about 100 feet down into some apartment complex. But suddenly out of nowhere, one single tree, no more than 8 inches thick appeared and caught the front bumper of my car. That one tree, that I swear wasn‚Äôt there, saved my life. And I‚Äôve been in even crazier accidents since then.\n\n**Schmidt:** Yes I can see from your file, 3 car accidents and 2 motorcycle. This one included. Can you tell me about another?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Well there was the time in college, when I was 22, that my girlfriend and I got into a fight, I was drunk and stormed off. Got in my car and drove 20 miles to my apartment, when I got there, I decided to go back to the dorms where she was, another 20 miles. When I got there, her roommates told me she had gone home to cool off, so I drove down to her parent home, 50 miles away. Once I got to her neighborhood, I decided to cool down myself. I turned my car around and started the 20 mile trip home. Mid-way, she texts me asking if I was ok, that she hadn‚Äôt heard from me in too long, was worried. I was sobering up at the time, but was still quite upset. \n\n**Schmidt:** So what did you do?\n\n**SCP-7622:** I texted her back, ‚ÄúNo‚Äù, but I mistyped and sent ‚ÄúNi‚Äù. N. I. Neee. So I went to fix the mistake, while barreling down the I-73 at 80-90 miles an hour. When I looked up from my phone, I was going over the center embankment. The nose of my truck hit the ground, launched me and the truck sideways. I rolled anywhere between four to six times over. When the motion stopped, I pulled myself out the back window and out of the wreck. I was not injured in the least.\n\n**Schmidt:** You don‚Äôt say.\n\n**SCP-7622:** Even crazier, the entire thing, whole truck, mashed metal and shattered glass, only thing that wasn‚Äôt pulverized was the front driver‚Äôs side area. It was like I had a bubble around me‚Ä¶ protection. \n\n**Schmidt:** Seems like a running theme in your life is narrowly escaping severe or deadly situations?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Mari! That's like not even the half of it! So many stories!\n\n**Schmidt:** Like what?\n\n**SCP-7622:** The time when I was 26, I was lost in the desert for two days with no food or water, just a hangover and cocaine! Was found by search and rescue, literally almost died. \n\n**Schmidt:** Another good exam--\n\n**SCP-7622:** And then there‚Äôs the time last year, in Tijuana, that I bought coke off a guy who turned me into the police, they pat me down and everything, but missed the one pocket where the shit was. I then I lost all my money, my wallet and phone, racked up a bill at one of the bars, couldn‚Äôt pay and was held at gunpoint for payment before a fire broke out and I got away!\n\n**Schmidt:** Sounds like--\n\n**SCP-7622:** Again! When I was 16, my friends and I got into parkour and I missed a 4 story jump, and only pinched my sciatica!\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n**OSCB-7622-1-CCTV-A:** //Schmidt is quiet for 3 seconds.//\n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-7622:** Or two years when I was riding to work and got T-boned by an SUV and the only thing damaged was my bike!\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n**OSCB-7622-1-CCTV-A:** //SCP-7622 and Schmidt are quiet for 7 seconds.//\n[[/div]]\n\n**Schmidt:** Any others?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Well‚Ä¶ yeah‚Ä¶\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n**OSCB-7622-1-CCTV-A:** //SCP-7622 looks at the far wall, past Schmidt.// \n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-7622:** I tried killing myself‚Ä¶ Twice.

But, I guess I have bad luck even with that. For the overdose, roommate found me and induced vomiting, took me 3 days to recover. And these, no matter how hard and how much I cut, the blood always stopped. I can‚Äôt even do that right.\n\n**Schmidt:** Well, JD, aren‚Äôt you glad that you couldn‚Äôt?\n\n**SCP-7622:** Jury‚Äôs still out on that.\n\n//SCP-7622 and Schmidt are quiet for 21 seconds.//\n\n**SCP-7622:** Whew, I mean, that's what comes to mind right now.

I think there is clear evidence here for release and use. JD has a strong moral compass, a keen eye and understanding of his faults, and a sense of duty to the world. Should we allow him to develop his abilities, he could be a great asset to The Foundation. Imagine what we could do with a top-tier reality bender on our side. Thaumiel only makes sense at this point. \n\nOn top of all that, it is clear that we cannot just sedate him and keep him inebriated via sedative means. And to be completely frank, these containment procedures are borderline unethical. To actively force this person to drink themselves to death would be against our creed of ‚Äúcold, not cruel‚Äù. Even more so that if his health starts to decline significantly due to the excessive drinking, the SCP-7622-A anomaly may appear just to protect JD anyway. In that case he‚Äôd be weaker and not in control. A secondary class of Cernunnos is necessary. \n\nI propose to dissolve Protocol:Relapse as well, it was a short-sighted & inhumane solution to a potential problem that I did not fully comprehend at the time. \n\nI need your help to push this along. Please follow up with the Council as soon as possible.\n\n-Mari\n\n**__Dr. Mari Schmidt, PHD__**\n//Researcher, Secure Facility 52//\n//Ext.52042, LV.3, Office 26//\n//Secure. Contain.

I am also sorry to report that effective immediately, you are to remove yourself as Research Head on the SCP-7622 project. The Council feels that you have grown too close and too attached to SCP-7622. Some of your research fails to maintain objectivity and proper nomenclature attributes. Data analysis also shows that SCP-7622 maintains a higher level of sobriety before and after your meetings, thus weakening Containment Protocols. The Council, along with myself, feel that you may be being manipulated by SCP-7622 & SCP-7622-A, either consciously or subconsciously, for unknown reasons. \n\nI hope this does not deter you from accepting other work on our behalf in the future. Your knowledge and prowess in this field is valued and appreciated.\n\nWith Deepest Regrets,\n\n**__Dir.

Dr. Schmidt was still able to use her personal access keycard. Internal investigation has revealed that Dr. Schmidt‚Äôs continued access to OSCB-7622 was achievable by way of systemic policy failure, as Dr. Schmidt had a higher clearance level than the programmer assigned to change her access permissions. Formal authorization inquiries hindered the expediency expected of such a general process[[footnote]]Current Polices & Procedures are now pending review.[[/footnote]].
