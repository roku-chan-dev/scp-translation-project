These include:\n* --Cooperation with NASA on a coverup regarding degenerate stars and supernovae within 1000 light years of the Solar System.--\n* Full knowledge sterilization at all major space agencies and astronomical institutions, [[footnote]] NASA, Roscosmos, NSF. [[/footnote]] including amnesticization of staff and introduction of artificial aversion traumas towards extinction-level events. \n* Seize and replace all instrumentation readings showing the presence of degenerate stars or soft gamma repeaters in Earth's stellar neighborhood\". [[footnote]] objects within 1000 light years of the Solar System. [[/footnote]]\n* The following false narratives must be promoted through the usual channels:\n * Catastrophic star collapse activity in the Milky Way (e.g. Gamma-Ray Bursts [[footnote]]Immensely energetic explosions caused by various stellar activity; a typical burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as the Sun will in its entire 10-billion-year lifetime. The energy is released along the neutron star's axis of rotation.[[/footnote]]) is both rare and poses no threat to Earth in the near-term future.\n * Earth was last impacted by a Gamma-Ray Burst 445 million years ago.\n * The consensus understanding of astrophysics is largely accurate and can be relied on to predict stellar phenomena.\n* **Updated 3/31/2022:** The shuttlecraft that carried the RTM-1 crew that was previously declared MIA must be intercepted once landed. Any survivors recovered must be interned, questioned, nerve-stapled, and given identity-reassignment amnesticization, as per Foundation \"Closed Casket\" protocols.\n* **Updated 4/2/2022:** All documentation produced regarding SCP-8440 is sealed under Level-5 Classification. Pending further review. \n * As per Ethics Committee guidelines, personnel with insufficient clearance attached to the project before 4/2/2022 will be offered significant financial incentives for accepting voluntary amnesticization. \n * Personnel found in possession of SCP-8440 materials without authorization are subject to disciplinary action, including amnesticization and summary nerve stapling.\n\nAdditional resources have been directed toward off-planet colonization efforts in the event SCP-8440 //fails// to occur. [[footnote]]Proposals to consider this a 'suspended' K-class phenomenon are currently in progress.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-8440 is an unknown, astronomical entity that is in between Earth's stellar neighborhood and catastrophic core-collapse phenomena of failed stars. The extent of SCP-8440’s capabilities is unknown, even based on [DATA EXPUNGED]. \n\nSCP-8440-1 refers to degenerate stars located within Earth's stellar neighborhood possessing a rotational axis facing Earth, indicating a GRB targeting Earth had previously occurred. The frequency of SCP-8440 manifesting is estimated based on the discovery of stars matching this description.\n\nSCP-8440-2 refers to stars in Earth's stellar neighborhood that possess several key characteristics. These include (but are not limited to):\n\n* Terminal stage stellar behavior. [[footnote]]Rapid expansion consistent with a fusion of hydrogen by-product into helium. [[/footnote]] \n* Indications of imminent core collapse behavior. [[footnote]]Nuclear fusion becomes unable to sustain the core against its own gravity; when the release of gravitational potential energy is insufficient, the star may instead collapse into a black hole or neutron star. [[/footnote]]\n* Accelerated progression through stellar lifecycle.\n* Observed, possibly anomalous discrepancies between estimates of stellar mass and gravitational behavior of star.\n\nWhen SCP-8440-2 undergoes a core collapse sequence, it will discharge a stream of energy along a lightyear-wide band with various projected effects on Earth. This ranges from destroying Earth’s biosphere to vaporizing the crust entirely. When this occurs, SCP-8440 will manifest to neutralize the incoming ejected energy.\n\nThe nature of core-collapse activity makes it impossible to detect a GRB before its effects have impacted Earth. Manifestations of SCP-8440 have been understood to detect incoming GRB activity aimed at Earth’s stellar neighborhood.\n\n**Discovery:** **RESTRICTED TO LEVEL 5 PERSONNEL**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ WARNING! UNAUTHORIZED PERSONNEL WILL BE EXPOSED TO A MEMETIC DEFENSE AGENT+\" hide=\"- CLEARANCE VERIFIED - \"]]\n\nIn 2002, SCP-8440 was encountered by NASA's satellite repair crew Commander Carlson Vilchez, Pilot Jon Duan, Mission Specialist Adam Yarrow, and Mission Specialist Pearl Makil. In their Repair Telescope Mission, NASA lost communication with the RTM-1 crew which was deemed MIA. In 2022, the RTM-1 shuttle suddenly returned and NASA received its signals and messages, along with one survivor, Carlson Vilchez.\n\nThe Foundation intercepted Vilchez before word of his return could be officially released to the public. After enacting a disinformation campaign, the Foundation took Vilchez in custody. Vilchez was unresponsive during the first interview. After 4 months of aided recovery, Vilchez was still unable to disclose anything regarding RTM-1. As of now, he is still in Foundation custody as a Person of Interest.\n\nThe Foundation managed to recover any recorded data that the RTM-1 shuttle contained and wiped it from NASA soon after.\n---------------\n\n+ Addendum-1: RTM-1 Recording Logs\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **AUDIO LOG - 1**\n------------------\n\n**Foreword:** This audio log reflects the last transmission of the Space Shuttle Hyperion before contact was lost with the vehicle.

She has quick and hoarded breathing while she quivers in her seat. Vilchez hastily leans forward to her and rests his hand on her shoulder to keep her still.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Breath! Breath, Pearl.\n\n**Makil:** It hurts- my skin hurts. //(She groans.)// Ah! I can’t see! Carlson?! Jon!\n\n//(From below deck, Duan hears shouting from above. He rushes to the ladder and climbs to the cockpit entrance. Upon seeing Makil’s episode, he gets closer to the pair and stares down at her.)//\n\n**Duan:** What’s happening?!\n\n**Vilchez:** I-I don’t know! She keeps saying she’s hurting but I don’t see injuries. \n\n//(Duan grabs one of her hands. She grips on his hand to the point where Duan grits his teeth. Despite this, Duan lays another hand on top of it.)//\n\n**Duan:** Pearl? Talk to me.\n\n**Makil:** My eyes… They’re melting! God, help me, please!\n\n**Vilchez:** You can hear us, right? We’re right here. We’re holding your hands. We’re not going anywhere. You are okay. \n\n//(Makil screams and thrashes from her seat that she bangs on the panels and even on Vilchez and Duan. Duan goes behind the seat to press down on her shoulders while Vilchez does his best to retrain her wrists next to her legs. She kicks, screams and swears for 2 minutes and 15 seconds until she passes out. Vilchez and Duan slowly remove their hands on her while they are shaking and breathing heavily.)//\n\n**Duan:** I’ve never seen her like this…ever.\n\n**Vilchez:** Just keep an eye on her, Jon. \n\n//(He pats his back and slumps back on his seat.

Have you eaten anything?\n\n**Makil:** I’m not hungry.\n\n**Duan:** Not even tired?\n\n**Makil:** Nope.\n\n**Duan:** Do you at least wanna take a break?\n\n//(She stops what she’s doing and turns herself to face Duan.)//\n\n**Makil:** Jon. I appreciate the concern. But unless you’re gonna help me here, let me focus. Please.\n\n//(Makil readjusts herself and returns her attention to the receivers. The pair sit in silence for a few minutes until the shuttle rumbles. They brace themselves, Duan moving up a seat next to Makil and looking out the window to see what may be causing the turbulence.)//\n\n//(Footage cuts to the front exterior of the shuttle. The frame shows a vague shape of a human male that is covered in an illuminating, white aroma.)//\n\n**Duan:** Holy- Adam?\n\n**Makil:** What?\n\n**Duan:** I swear to God, that’s him. Look at the face!\n\n//(Makil leans closer to the window.)//\n\n**Makil:** That can’t be. \n\n//(“Adam” walks to the shuttle, despite there being no surface to walk on. He gets close until he stops 6 meters away from the front of the shuttle. He sits and gently sways his body and his arms low.)//\n\n**Duan:** The Hell is he doing?\n\n//(“Adam” halts his movements and extends his arms as if for an embrace and stays in that pose.)//\n\n**Makil:** Why are you giggling? \n\n**Duan:** That’s not me. \n\n//(A low-pitched noise blares but Duan and Makil do not react to it and continue to stare out the window. The noise steadily gets quieter and the footage captures small trails of red, orange, yellow, blue, and white lights converging above “Adam”. These lights then swirl and orbit one another, then converge little by little. A red dwarf zooms past the shuttle, leaving a streak of fiery red behind as it draws to the convergence. Several more giant stars rush past them and the collection of stars creates this rough-shaped sphere of light. Suddenly, the collection of stars vanishes, as does “Adam”.)//\n\n**Duan:** My eyes don’t feel cold anymore.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG - 4**\n\n---------------------\n\n(//Duan is in Mid Deck, slipping his legs into the bottom half of the space suit.

I think maybe he can help us out.\n\n**Makil:** We don’t know if that was even him. Hell, we don’t even know where we are.  \n\n**Duan:** I can at least help comms.

Get a better idea of what’s out there.\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** I saw the footage from the other day. And… I’m going to have to agree with Pearl, here. Something is wrong here. Wherever “here” is. \n\n**Duan:** I will literally be right back. I got the cord, you guys can reel me back in if anything happens. \n\n**Vilchez:** Jon. You’re brave. Always have been. But don’t be stupid. \n\n**Duan:** Commander, with all due respect, I’m losing my mind in here. And I can’t just sit around and do nothing. Just- let me try to get some new comms working. \n\n**Makil:** Even if it might work, which it won’t. It’s still suicide. \n\n**Duan:** It could help us.\n\n**Makil:** I’m not gonna lose my fucking friend!\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Makil:** And as your friend, Jon. I’m begging you. Please, don’t do this. \n\n**Duan:** What else can we do, Pearl? Tell me. \n\n//(The trio remain silent for 12 seconds.)//\n\n**Duan:** I promise you both.

Just thinking about what happened.\n\n**Duan:** Wasn’t that amazing? \n\n**Makil:** //(Chuckles)// It’s insane is what it is.\n\n**Duan:** It’s also a gift.\n\n**Makil:** //(She turns her head.)// Huh?\n\n**Duan:** It’s a once-in-a-lifetime moment for us. But maybe it doesn’t have to be. Can you imagine what else the little one can do? What he can be?\n\n**Makil:** God, maybe.\n\n**Duan:** Oh?\n\n**Makil:** I’m sorry. Just just slipped out.\n\n**Duan:** No, no I think you got the right idea. Why not, right? He saved us from that hellfire. He healed me from those episodes. Showing us wonders in this universe. \n\n//(Makil remains silent. Duan gets on both his knees and lays his hands on her thighs as he looks up.)//\n\n**Duan:** You’re still suffering, Pearl. Don’t you want it to stop?\n\n**Makil:** I do.\n\n**Duan:** Then let me help you. Like you helped me. \n\n**Makil:** I didn’t help you.\n\n**Duan:** You did, by being there. You were always there.\n\n//(Duan holds both her hands.)//\n\n**Duan:** Please, let me do this for you.\n\n**Makil:** …Okay. I’m trusting you. \n\n**Duan:** You know I have your back. \n\n//(Sometime later, Duan and Makil ready their suits and exit the shuttle. After 26 minutes, they return to the craft with their suits off.)//\n\n//(Footage cuts to the pair sneaking to the Flight Deck hatch as they try not to wake up Vilchez. By the time they got there, they help each other slip on their space suits and crawl through the hatch.)//\n\n//(Footage cuts to the exterior port side of the shuttle. Duan is the first to exit from the hatch, then Makil. They both wait for a minute until “Adam” manifests in front of them. The entity embraces them both and vanishes in a flash of light. 26 minutes later, Duan and Makil return, this time without their space suits. “Adam” releases the pair and disappears, leaving them to return to the shuttle.)//\n\n\n//(Footage cuts back to the Flight Deck as Duan and Makil laugh and they make their way back in. Makil bumps their head and Duan helps her out and rubs on the bump. She laughs harder now but Duan tries to shush her. She lays her head on his shoulder while he hugs her.)//\n\n**Duan:** I told you everything was going to be okay.\n\n**Makil:** //(Giggles)// Yeah. \n\n**Duan:** So how do you feel?\n\n**Makil:** My eyes can breathe.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG - 8**\n\n----------------------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//(Vilchez is once again working on the panels. Makil floats and sits onto the seat next to him.)//\n\n**Makil:** Hey commander.\n\n**Vilchez:** Pearl? You look better.\n\n**Makil:** I feel better.\n\n**Vilchez:** That’s good. That’s really good. You need something?\n\n**Makil:** Just checking up on you. You still have those episodes?\n\n**Vilchez:** //(Chuckles)// Yeah. But what can you do about it right?\n\n**Makil:** There is something, actually.\n\n**Vilchez:** Hm?\n\n**Makil:** Duan showed me Adam. And the little one. \n\n**Vilchez:** You went outside?! Why?! Why did either of you do that?!\n\n\n//(Makil’s keeps her relaxed expression.)//\n\n**Makil:** Carlson, listen to me. When Jon and I were walking on the little one's body, Adam brought me to an angel. She was like the sky, warm and beautiful. She came to me and whispered a verse. “When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overflow you. When you walk through the fire, you shall not be burned, nor shall the flame scorch you.” [[footnote]] Isaiah 43:2 New King James Version. [[/footnote]] And look. I’m not burned. The Lord is with us.\n\n**Vilchez:** Pearl. I don’t know why Jon told you, but I don’t think you're in the right headspace right now. Just… rest for a bit. We’ll figure out a way back home soon. Promise. \n\n**Makil:** Hm. //(She smiles)// We’re already home, commander. \n\n**Vilchez:** Pearl, just stop! I don’t know what Jon put in your head but you- AH!\n\n//(Vilchez jumps back into his seat. He grabs onto his face and thrashes his body while he screams. Makil’s smile quickly drops as she crouches over to him. )//\n\n**Vilchez:** NO, NO, NO! I’M BURNING! I’M BURNING! HELP ME, GOD, HELP ME!\n\n**Makil:** Commander- \n\n//(Vilchez hits her in the face and she retreats. Covering the spot where it was struck.)//\n\n**Makil:** //(Shouts)// JON! JON GET OVER HERE NOW!\n\n//(Duan hastily makes his way from Mid Deck to Flight Deck. He goes to Vilchez and does his best to hold his arms and torso down. Makil goes to the back holds back his shoulders on the seat.)//\n\n**Duan:** Carlson! Listen to me! You’re okay, just listen to my voice.\n\n//(Vilchez’s screams grow louder and his body gets more erratic.Duan and Makil do their best to hold him down but Vilchez manages to arch his back further up and his breathing gets short and jagged. A Minute later in that position, Vilchez stops his screaming and movement. He slowly returns to consciousness with slow, heavy breathing.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Did- did it happen again?\n\n**Makil:** Yeah. You okay?\n\n//(The crew gets off from Vilchez and he tries his best to collect himself. Vilches slouches forward and covers his face with both hands.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** I hit you.\n\n**Makil:** It’s okay.\n\n**Vilchez:** No, it’s not. I’m sorry.\n\n//(The trio stay silent.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** I just need a minute.\n\n**Duan:** Take all the time you need.\n\n//(After some time, the crew goes and scatters to different spaces of the shuttle. Vilchez is left alone in the cockpit.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Fuck. //(Sighs)// I can do this. I can push through. \n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG - 9**\n\n------------------------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//(Duan and Vilchez are at their seats, watching the trailing stars passing by them.)//\n\n**Duan:** Check it out. Another cluster.\n\n**Vilchez:** I see it. \n\n//(Both remain silent for 13 seconds.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Do you miss home?\n\n**Duan:** Huh? What do you mean?\n\n**Vilchez:** I mean what I mean, do you miss Earth?\n\n**Duan:** Calm down, sir.\n\n**Vilchez:** //(Raises voice)// Why are you telling me to calm down? I am.\n\n**Duan:** Okay, okay. Sorry. \n\n//(They sit in silence again.)//\n\n**Duan:** Are you okay?\n\n**Vilchez:** I think I’ve seen enough stars. And these machines. I’m tired, man. I wanna wrestle with my brother, hug my mom, kiss my girl. \n\n**Duan:** Mm.\n\n**Vilchez:** You don’t?\n\n**Duan:** To be honest, I got nothing but problems back at home.\n\n**Vilchez:** Okay, but don't we all? You can always find somewhere else to move.\n\n**Duan:** Trust me when I say that there’s not a lot of places for me to go. I’ve looked.\n\n**Vilchez:** Sorry to hear that.\n\n**Duan:** It’s fine. But, I wouldn’t mind staying here.\n\n**Vilchez:** Here? Jon, what are you gonna do out here?\n\n**Duan:** Anything I want. There's freedom. And I always have something to look forward to.\n\n**Vilchez:** That thing out there?\n\n**Duan:** He’s not “a thing”.\n\n**Vilchez:** Right there. You’ve been obsessed with it since you came back. I hear the things you say from time to time. \n\n**Duan:** And?\n\n**Vilchez:** I’m worried for you. We’ve all been through a lot since it took us and I think… I think you just wanna see what you wanna see. And you, somehow, convinced Pearl to cope in the same way. \n\n**Duan:** And what about what you’ve seen? \n\n**Vilchez:** I don’t know. \n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** I don’t know anything. But what I do know is that we’re gonna make it back. And that I want you to both know I’m looking out for both of you.  \n\n**Duan:** I know. I’m with you too. Thanks.\n\n**Vilchez:** You're welcome. Just don’t be feeding Pearl any more fantasies. \n\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG - 10**\n\n-----------------------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//(Duan is seen with Makil in Mid Deck. He repeats the conversation he had with Vilchez.)//\n\n**Duan:** That’s what he told me.\n\n**Makil:** Are you serious?\n\n**Duan:** Yeah. Can you blame him? If anything, it's our fault that he thinks that way. \n\n**Makil:** How is it our fault? He chooses to just sit there all day and continue to fix those stupid comms and it's getting him nowhere. And did he forget that he just had an episode?\n\n**Duan:** Maybe it gives him something to do. But you’re right. We’re leaving him in pain. How can we call ourselves a team if we’re not going to help each other?\n\n**Makil:** Then let’s show him our little one. Heal him like he’s healed us. He won’t have to worry about anything, anymore. We can just be.\n\n**Makil:** I agree… Be honest with me, what do you think will be back for us on Earth?\n\n//(Makil remains silent for 14 seconds.)//\n\n**Makil:** A life of constant waiting. A dull, cold life. But for Carlson… I feel like he’s going to be living a life much worse than ours.\n\n**Duan:**  Then let’s save our commander.\n\n//(The pair make their way up to Flight Deck. And go behind Vilchez who is busy with working the receivers. Suddenly, they wrestle with Vilchez in the cockpit as they try to pull him out.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Fuck is wrong with you guys?!\n\n//(Vilchez kicks Duan in the stomach, but Duan grabs his shirt and yanks him close. Vilchez tries to shove his hands against Duan’s face but he is thrown to the side panels. Makil takes the opportunity and grabs Vilchez’s kicking legs and both carry him out of the cockpit.)//\n\n**Vilchez** Stop! Please!\n\n**Duan:** Everything will be alright, Carlson. \n\n//(Makil lets go of the legs and goes by the hatch to unlock it for them. She quickly makes her way back and helps Duan shove Vilchez through but he scrambles and flails his body, making it difficult for them to hold their grip. Vilchez manages to escape and retreat to the cockpit. Cornered, the duo approaches him.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Why are you guys doing this?!\n\n**Duan:** You’re suffering, Carlson. We don’t want that for you anymore.\n\n**Vilchez:** What?\n\n**Makil:** The little one can heal you. From every pain to every discomfort. Anything that would make you feel worse,  he can wash it all away. His ancient innocence can keep you warm.\n\n**Duan:** Carlson. This is our life now.\n\n**Vilchez:** No, it’s not! I’m not gonna let that fucking thing take me!\n\n**Makil:** The little one just made us feel better. And don’t talk to him that way, he hears you. You’ll make him cry. \n\n**Vilchez:** I don’t give a fuck, you two need to wake up! What about all your other friends and family? What about your lives?! Does none of that matter now?!\n\n**Duan:** You matter to us. \n\n**Makil:** We love you, Carlson. Don’t make this harder than it needs to be. \n\n**Duan:** Just let it all go. Let the little one hold you as it held us.\n\n//(Vilchez shakes his head.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** This is crazy. You’re crazy!\n\n//(Duan and Makil pounce and grab him once more. Vilchez does his best to put up a fight but to no avail. They move him near the hatch again and Makil goes to open it and exit first to help Duan by taking one of Vilchez’s legs and pulling it to her. Duan quickly moves to Vilchez and they both push Vilchez through the hatch.)//\n\n//(The trio exit the shuttle while Vilchez continues to scream until the hatch behind them closes.//\n\n//(Footage cuts to the exterior of the shuttle. Duan pulls Vilchez up, who seems to have ceased. Makil helps push him out while also grabbing onto his pants. They both hold onto Vilchez while waiting for “Adam” to manifest. Once he does, he pulls them all for an embrace and they vanish.)//\n\n//(40 minutes later, Vilchez manifests alone and crawls back through the hatch and into the shuttle. Footage cuts to the Flight Deck as Vilchez opens the hatch and crawls through the interior hatch. Vilchez rests his back on the wall. A white light beams through all the windows, enveloping the interior with light, followed by a low-pitch sound.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** I see you too.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOn 06/08/2022, Carlson Vilchez finally agreed to speak to Foundation personnel to disclose any additional information about SCP-8440.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n= **INTERVIEW - 1**\n\n---------------------\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Tyson Gabriel\n\n\n**Interviewee:** Carlson Vilchez\n\n\n-------------\n\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Gabriel:** So Carlson, are you feeling better?\n\n**Vilchez:** Yes. I think so.\n\n**Gabriel:** Right, then. Can you tell me what happened to your crew in ‘02?\n\n//(Vilchez laughs.)//\n\n**Gabriel:** Did I say something amusing?\n\n**Vilchez:** Oh, everything is. \n\n**Gabriel:** What do you mean?\n\n//(Vilchez sways his body.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** Everything. Life. It’s so beautiful. More beautiful than what you can imagine. I didn’t get it at first. But I understand now.\n\n**Gabriel:** What did you understand?\n\n**Vilchez:** You. Me. Everyone. There’s a spark in us. A glow that none has ever seen before. It’s something that many want but never quite seem to grasp. And there are some that can harness it. Those are the ones that defy reality.\n\n//(Vilchez  stops swaying and fails to contain his laugh. After 4 minutes, he calms down.)//\n\n**Vilchez:** The little one sees it in us too. I think that’s why he undid the Gamma-Ray that hit us, why he chose my crew. I wouldn’t put it past you if the little one just thought of us as pretty-looking bugs it wanted to play with, and maybe that’s true. He’s still so young after all. But those eyes. They said something different.\n\n**Gabriel:** What was it that you saw?\n\n**Vilchez:** A dragon, a butterfly, a nebula, a four-pointed star. And yet, he was none of them. It’s hard to remember the details.\n\n**Gabriel:** Can you tell us what happened to your crew?\n\n**Vilchez:** The little one helped them let their glow out. They burned. Like white, flaming angels. \n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n\n----------------\n\n**Note:** Vilchez refused to elaborate further and ceased communication with Foundation staff for the time being. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Elliptical galaxy IC 2006.jpg\n> **Author:** ESA/Hubble & NASA Image acknowledgement: Judy Schmidt and J.
