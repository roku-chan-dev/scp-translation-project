I'm new. \n> **jorgumander:** ASK HIM THE QUESTIONS!\n> **blusepth:** ASK! ASK!\n> **CoolGuy95:** questions?\n> **Phenylalanine:** 1. WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE PIECE OF POST-PHENOM ART?\n> **Phenylalanine:** 2. HAVE YOU EVER CREATED ANY POST-PHENOM ART YOURSELF?\n> **Phenylalanine:** 3. HOW DID YOU FIND US?\n> **CoolGuy95:** I would say Stendhal's Nightmare.\n> **CoolGuy95:** No, and a friend of mine mentioned you guys. \n> **blusepth:** Who?\n> **CoolGuy95:** She said her username is autotrophic or something like that.\n> **Phenylalanine:** Ah, you're with autotrophia. She's cool. \n> **Phenylalanine:** Well, the initiation is complete. your free to go\n> **blusepth:** ONE OF US.\n> **jackomundo:** ONE OF US.\n> **CoolGuy95:** So you guys are Are We Cool Yet?, right?\n> **blusepth:** ah hell noes\n> **jackomundo:** nope\n> **Phenylalanine:** No\n> **CoolGuy95:** but, I thought you guys did post-phenomenological art?\n> **jackomundo:** well yes\n> **CoolGuy95:** i thought that was kind of AWCY?'s thing.\n> **Phenylalanine:** We do post-phenom art, but we're not AWCY. You can't really be AWCY. It's like, a kind of meme really. \n> **blusepth:** AWCY? is definitely not cool.\n> **Phenylalanine:** Everyone is really damn tired of AWCY jokes.\n> **CoolGuy95:** okay\n> **jackomundo:** .tell AWritingDesk https://i.imgur.com/bnCs3.jpg\n> **VanGogh:** Acknowledged.\n> **Phenylalanine:** So we've moved away from using AWCY in just about anything. It's an old, worn out joke that no one laughs at anymore.\n> **blusepth:** Also, AWCY? kind of got used by people who used post-phenom art in a way we don't really approve of. Like Stendhal's Nightmare. What's the point of making beautiful art if people can't appreciate it without dying or going crazy?\n> **jackomundo:** ^\n> **Phenylalanine:** These days, not many people do much of that \"edgy\" crap. At least not in our little circle. \n> **CoolGuy95:** I really didn't know all this, I just heard a little about AWCY and I thought it was interesting. I figured it would be a good way to expand my experience in art.\n> **Phenylalanine:** Its fine\n> **jorgumander:** yea, you're new here after all. can we see some of the stuff you've done before?\n> **CoolGuy95:** Sure. let me dig some of this stuf up\n> **Epimonsterous has joined __#post-phenomart__**\n> **CoolGuy95:** it's not post-phenom, but here it is: https://i.imgur.com/AD9Lz.jpg\n> **Epimonsterous:** ooh are we reviewing art?\n> **jorgumander:** not bad, but not good either\n> **Phenylalanine:** I kind of like it, but it feels like it needs a lot refinement.\n> **blusepth:** it needs to be in color, like psychodelic swirls and stuff\n> **Phenylalanine:** Hey Epimon, we're just taking a look at this new guy's stuff. \n> **Epimonsterous:** Eh. The shapes are a little lopsided, and your shading needs work.\n> **CoolGuy95:** Is it really that bad? I mean, I know I'm not great but.... D:\n> **blusepth:** keep practcing, its the only way to get better\n> **jorgumander:** ^\n> **jackomundo:** background landscape would help too.\n> **CoolGuy95:** thanks for the feedback guys\n> **Phenylalanine:** You take criticism pretty well, that's good.\n> **CoolGuy95:** thanks\n> **jorgumander:** so people, today I put together a quick tutorial for people new to post-phenom. just a simple animated picture.\n> **jorgumander:** https://i.imgur.com/xsnISqj.jpg\n> **blusepth:** lemme look\n> **jackomundo:** the writing is kind of sloppy.\n> **Phenylalanine:** I can barely read it, but I think I know the process you're describing. \n> **Phenylalanine:** The one with the crystals and rat blood? \n> **jackomundo:** yes\n> **Phenylalanine:** That's a good one, tried and true. Still, you really need to improve your handwriting. Maybe use the text tool in Photoshop instead.\n> **CoolGuy95:** it sounds interesting\n> **blusepth:** jacko's tutorial is pretty hard to read, but it is a good technique for you to try out CoolGuy.\n> **jorgumander:** yea, it is pretty simple and cheap. \n> **CoolGuy95:** I think I will. I can read the tutorial well enough since my own handwriting is bad.\n> **Phenylalanine:** It would be good for you as an artist. It's always a good idea to experiment in new mediums. \n> **CoolGuy95:** I'll get started right away. I can get a mouse from the pet store down the road.\n> **Phenylalanine:** One thing before you go CoolGuy.\n> **CoolGuy95:** ?\n> **Phenylalanine:** If you see the letters \"SCP\" in that order anywhere, on a truck, on a building, on someone's clothes, anywhere, drop what you are doing run.\n> **Phenylalanine:** Run like you have never run before.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
