I’m a hobbyist artist and comic book writer. I also occasionally do photo manipulation and other digital art. I have a love for the ocean along with the life found within it and a lot of my art reflects this.\n\nI wish I was a better writer but for the most part I'm an artist. Like many of you though I seek to tell stories but my dyslexia makes that task a bit of a bitch. My art has always been a hobby. I recently got my EMT and I'm working to become a firefighter… very non art things regardless this site brings me joy and for that i'm here. \n\nI dont think ive produced anything special. I like to tell character based stories with crazy creatures and if you like that good. My work might bring you a bit of joy if not no worries. If you have the time, tell me how I could get better. \n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab It all ended as it began]]\n\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-all-ended-as-it-began It all ended as it began ]\nThis was my first story.  It is far from perfect and at that time I was still struggling to understand what worked on the wiki. The story is about nature overcoming the damage man has done and how if the world were to end, eventually the world would move on and perhaps start anew.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab The Idea Of Justice]]\n\n[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-idea-of-justice The idea of justice ]\n\nThe idea of justice was a character study depicting the different approaches to people coming to terms with what they had done wrong. I struggled with dialogue and narrative for this story.  However, it was where I first started to grasp the building blocks of building a narrative.\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Day Trip & Spin In The Library]]\n\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/day-trip Day Trip]\n\nThis is, I believe, the first story where I was fully able to understand and write the story I wanted to tell. It was based around SCP-507 finding happiness and realizing he deserved to be happy. I learned a lot while writing this and while it’s far from perfect, I am happy with the outcome.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Other information]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-whitneys-stinky-author-page/Whitney]]\n//Full art scene above//.
