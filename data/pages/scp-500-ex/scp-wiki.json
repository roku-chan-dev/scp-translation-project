In the event that personnel complain of any ailment that is not immediately harmful to their well-being, they are to be given SCP-500-EX-1 six hours prior to other means of treatment. Exceptions may be made if medical personnel believe that other treatments would be more efficient in treating the symptoms.\n\nSCP-500-EX is to be monitored by two armed members of security personnel. An additional two members of security personnel are to be placed at each of the --two-- --three-- --four-- --six-- seven factories owned and operated by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. All security personnel are to be armed and ordered to not interfere with the actions of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. Any action committed by either the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation or SCP-500-EX is to be immediately reported to Site-11 intelligence command.\n\nIn the event that SCP-500-EX attempts to sell SCP-500-EX-1 specimens without approval from the Foundation, SCP-500-EX is to be threatened with the termination of Agreement-500-EX-A until their actions cease. If SCP-500-EX withdraws from Agreement-500-EX-A or the Foundation invalidates the agreement, SCP-500-EX is to be contained within Site-11.\n\n**Description:** SCP-500-EX is a 1.8 m (5'11 ft) tall 81.6 kg (180 lbs) human male named Arthur Swanson. Medical analysis has concluded that SCP-500-EX's anatomy is non-anomalous, however, SCP-500-EX is able to produce anomalous pills (SCP-500-EX-1) while overseeing a production line within any of the seven factories owned by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. SCP-500-EX is the current CEO and owner of the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation, which apart from the production of SCP-500-EX-1, is non-anomalous. The company was formed in 1878 and specializes in the production of medicine and medical materials such as bandages, disinfectants, and medical syringes. The company owns and operates seven factories across four U.S. states[[footnote]] In the cities of Toledo (Ohio), Sandusky (Ohio), Dayton (Ohio), Cleveland (Ohio), Chicago (Illinois), Detroit (Michigan), and South Bend (Indiana).[[/footnote]]. Around half of the managerial and high-ranking staff at the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation are embedded Foundation agents to ensure the provisions of Agreement-500-EX are followed by SCP-500-EX.\n\nSCP-500-EX-1 provides numerous positive anomalous effects in a several-day/week-spanning period following ingestion. These effects become more pronounced after repeated usage. The label on SCP-500-EX-1 stated that it was able to cure ailments including, but not limited to: Migraines, Cramps, Fatigue, Insomnia, and the Flu. It is not currently understood how SCP-500-EX enhances the properties of SCP-500-EX-1. Prior to its discovery, SCP-500-EX-1 was labeled as \"Miracle Migraine Pills\" and sold across the US States of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Wisconsin, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and the Canadian province of Ontario.\n\n\n> \"Why is, \"-EX\" placed in the text after the mention of SCP-500 and SCP-500-1?

These containers are to be located within the medical wing of every Foundation facility with level-0 security credentials required to access. With the exception of medical staff, personnel below level-2 clearance are to be told that SCP-500-EX is anomalous and shown the original article for SCP-500-EX. If personnel inquire, they are to be informed that \"-EX\" stands for \"Experimental\" and that the Foundation is working to produce an experimental, higher-quality variant of SCP-500-EX.\n\nThere is to be a minimum of ten bottles containing a minimum of fifty pills per bottle at every facility.\n\nAll employees of the Spring Bottom Medical Corporation have been located, amnesticized, and allowed to retain their positions within the company as of 04/08/1913.\n\n**Description:** SCP-500-EX refers to sugar pills produced by the Foundation for medical use via the Placebo Effect. SCP-500-EX does not possess anomalous qualities, however, due to the Placebo Effect SCP-500-EX still functions to cure minor ailments among unaware staff and D-Class personnel.\n\nThe Placebo Effect is a psychological medical effect wherein subjects receive fabricated medical treatment but believe they are getting the real treatment for their medical condition. This results in their condition improving due to a series of complex neurobiological actions within subject's brains. The most common form of the Placebo Effect globally is via Placebo pills which are identical to sugar pills in most cases, although there are numerous variants with Placebo pills having herbs within them. Numerous studies have shown that subjects who undergo the ingestion of Placebo pills may report the pills to improve nausea or pain that they are dealing with and better sleep patterns. \n\n+++++ **SCP-500-EX may be used at the discretion of medical personnel if subjects complain of the following:**\n* Difficulty sleeping\n* Headaches\n* Cramps\n* Anxiety[[footnote]] At a revision undergone during the 2002 Foundation mental health awareness week, SCP-500-EX-1 may only be used to treat anxiety if it is the first time within one year that the subject reports severe anxiety. If reports are more frequent, legitimate medical treatment is to be pursued. [[/footnote]]\n* Symptoms of the Common Cold\n* Fatigue\n* Nausea\n\nWhen subjects are given SCP-500-EX, they are to be informed to return to the medical wing if symptoms persist for a period of eight to seventy-two hours, depending on what SCP-500-EX is used to combat on a case-by-case basis. In the event that subjects return and claim that SCP-500-EX was ineffective, they are to be given legitimate treatment for the ailment that they claim to suffer from. In the event that subjects report similar or identical symptoms within a three-month span, they are to be given proper medical treatment. Failure to do so/the abuse of SCP-500-EX by medical personnel will result in a reprimand.\n\n+++ Discovery and Research\n-----\n\nOn July 18th, 1892, Senior Commander Horace Meier of Site-11 sent a letter to O5-11 detailing an anomalous experience they had, from Cleveland, Ohio, United States.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[size 135%]] Gretings, for I wish that this letter finds you in good health, I most certainly will be. I believe I have stumbled across a most wonderful anomaly which will ultimately prove most beneficial to the Foundation in its recent course of expansion.\n@@ @@\nWhile I was traversing through the countryside my mobility ceased tremendously as my legs had seized into constant cramping for what seemed like hours. I had one of my assistants run into the town of Norwalk to get something to help with my mobility, only for him to return not with a wheelchair nor a cane, but with a pack of 6 white pills that he claimed advertised as being able to cure my pain within hours. I was initially filled with fury at him as he stated that the pills cost 25 cents! But alas, he swore that the merchants stated that these pills would cure any cramps and after believing his rhetoric, I took them and was filled with an immense energy, and within less than 3 hours I was once again walking without being halted by any pain! I immediately went to the store with the assistant again and after inquiring, we were able to learn of this salesman named \"Arthur\".\n@@ @@\nWe bought several more packets of the pills and have sent them in an attached package. The only other information we have been able to extract was that the pills were made by a company named \"Spring Blossom\" and that these pills can supposedly deal with headaches, other pain, and even minor illness. What intrigued me and leads me to believe that these pills are anomalous is that the company advertises these pills as being 3 ingredients only, of which all three are non-anomalous.\n@@ @@\nI hope that my hypothesis about these pills is true, as this will greatly benefit productivity within the Foundation if that is the case.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[>]]\nSincerely,\nHorace.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nTesting would promptly begin with the supply of 80 pills to conclude if SCP-500-EX-1 was anomalous prior to its designation as an SCP. \n\n> [[=]]\n>  **SITE-11 STAFF BULLETIN FOR THE MONTH OF AUGUST 1892.**\n> [[Size 75%]] ALL PERSONNEL WITH MINOR MEDICAL ISSUES WILL BE ABLE TO OPT INTO A MEDICAL TESTING PROGRAM FOR A $10 REWARD FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THE TEST.

[[/footnote]] received a letter inviting representatives of the Foundation to meet with their CEO; Arthur Swan on March 2nd, 1894 at 11:30 AM local time. The letter also informed members of the Foundation that there would be two rooms booked in the Boody House Hotel under the names \"Johannes Miklos\" and \"Emelio Hitchcock\" from the 1st to the 8th of the month.\n\nLetters were sent to the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation in the month leading up to the meeting, though no reply was sent back. Numerous agents arrived at the Boody House Hotel lobby led by Senior Researcher William Wallace at 9:30 AM, local time while waiting for the interview.

Thank you for offering and agreeing to this interview.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** My pleasure! I hope y'all people are having a wonderful time so far right 'ere Toledo! If I am correct, I understand y'all folks are with a group known as the \"SCP Foundation\"? \n\n**Wallace:** Yes we are. The Foundation would like to extend its gratitude for the hotel rooms you have provided to our agents for the duration of their stay.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** No worries at all! It's my pleasure and duty to ensure any customers of my company are well acquainted! You know this city does have quite a history. Ya ever pondered 'bout why Michigan has that weird peninsula above the state? It's cause Michigan went to war with Ohio over this very town! Both sides wanted the Maumee River that runs through the city just a few blocks away from 'ere. Something about controlling the trade from The Great Lakes I think. But regardless, in the end, Ohio won but as compensation, President Jackson awarded Michigan the upper peninsula. I had a granpappy who was part of the militiamen in Perrysburg. You lot should go sightseeing around during your stay.\n\n**Wallace:** Indeed. Grow up in this area? Or are you from somewhere else?\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** I was born 'ere. I mean, not 'ere exactly I was born down in Waterville just down the river but y'know, same area.\n\n//SCP-500-EX lets out a brief chuckle.//\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** But we moved 'round the states lot. Sometime in 1856, ma pappy moved us all out to Maryland. Always was disgusted by the rebels and them owning slaves so he joined the army and fought from 1861 to Appomattox Courthouse. Even in the battle of Gettysburg. When he got back he moved us all out west to San Francisco for 'bouta decade. Then he bought a farm 'round Topeka and I stayed there 'till I was 23. Then I left for my hometown right here in Toledo where I started to sell some medicine. One decade later, 'ere I am!\n\n**Wallace:** Speaking of, today we are here to talk about some of the medicine your company sells. The \"Miracle Migraine Pills\". Can you inform us about how you make them and their anomalous effects? What we are curious about is that they are nearly identical to common sugar pills, but still manage to cure many things. Can you explain how it works?\n\n//SCP-500-EX chuckles.//\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** All in the magic! It's just a little personal secret that I myself know.\n\n//SCP-500-EX taps on their head.//\n\n**Wallace:** As you may have surmised, the SCP Foundation is an organization that is dedicated to the containment of the anomalous and unexplainable within our world. We believe that your pills are anomalous and as such wish to contain them. We hope to get your cooperation with this but will proceed without it.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Relax! I am fully willing to cooperate with the Foundation! I would just like to enter some negotiations first! After all, Miracle Migraine Pills do make up a sizeable chunk of my company's revenue. Can I assume that you use 'em after purchasing them? Or do you throw 'em all into a fire to destroy them after? \n\n**Wallace:** Our goal is to contain anomalies, not destroy them. But yes, we have undergone limited practical use with the pills.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Wonderful! Perhaps we can negotiate a deal where you are the only people who will get the Miracle Migraine Pills at a competitive price, and they're left offa the public market!\n\n**Wallace:** I will talk with my superiors to see if we can attempt to negotiate a purchase.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Wonderous! Perhaps in two days time at 12:30 PM, I'll show you around my factory? It is only a 20-minute horse carriage ride away from this hotel! We can discuss the details right there in my office!\n\n**Wallace:** That would be lovely! We will prepare to meet at that date with any potential deal. Before we end the interview I have one last question.\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Of course! What is it?\n\n**Wallace:** Do you have a list of what stores you give the Miracle Migraine Pills to? \n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Hmmm. I do not know exactly what stores I provide the pills to off of the top of my head but will provide you with one when you visit my office!\n\n**Wallace:** Thank you.\n\n//SCP-500-EX stands up and shakes Wallace's and the rest of the agent's hands.//\n\n**SCP-500-EX:** Well it's great meeting y'all! I hope to see you again soon! Well I know I will haha. I look forward to it! I will make sure to stay quiet about this meeting until our next. Have a good day fellows!\n\n//SCP-500-EX leaves and the team returns to their hotel rooms. A report is transmitted to Site-11 command via telegraph.//\n\n-----\n\n[END INTERVIEW]\n\n**CLOSING NOTES:** Follow-up interview set for 12:30 PM on March 4th, 1894, at 555 Star Lane, Toledo, Ohio, United States.

O5 vote: 11-2. ||\n|| **1900:** || January 1, Distributionary hubs have been established at Site-14 for shipping across the Pacific Ocean and at Site-184 for shipping across the Atlantic Ocean. The previous arrangement has gone into effect, and the price per packet of SCP-500-EX-1 has risen to $0.50. SCP-500-EX has informed the Foundation about the opening of a third factory for its non-anomalous business. ||\n|| **1901:** || June 11th, 90% of Foundation locations globally have received an adequate supply of SCP-500-EX. Global supply is expected to be complete by January 1st, 1902. August 9th, an additional 500 packets of SCP-500-EX-1 have been purchased for $250.  ||\n|| **1902** || January 1st, Foundation medical expenditures since March 20th, 1898 have decreased by 71%. SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of a fourth factory owned by the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. October 12th, SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of another two factories. ||\n|| **1903** || April 14th, an additional 1000 packs of SCP-500-EX-1 have been purchased by the Foundation due to mass shortages. SCP-500-EX offered to give all packets for free in exchange for the price of each packet of SCP-500-EX-1 being raised to $1. O5 vote: 5-8. A counteroffer has been reached to raise the price to $0.75 per packet. In addition, a further 200 packets are going to be ordered per every routine order. ||\n|| **1904:** || February 20th, usage of SCP-500-EX-1 is to begin field testing to determine of SCP-500-EX-1 has practical use during missions. August 20th, SCP-500-EX-1 only had success in improving the results of agents in the field 4.3% of the time. Senior Researcher William Wallace hypothesized that heightened levels of adrenaline lead to SCP-500-EX-1 having a reduced effect in the majority of cases. This was determined to be the solution and field usage of SCP-500-EX-1 has been scrapped. ||\n|| **1905:** || June 14th, SCP-500-EX has reported the opening of a seventh factory for the Spring Blossom Medical Corporation. Senior Researcher William Wallace has announced his retirement effective January 15th, 1906.

Why'd it have to be employees?\n> \n> **Cleveland:** The D-Class'd just tell us what we want them to hear. It's happened before. Besides, barely any of the D-Class in the site have even had the current SCP-500-EX-1 cause we cycle through 'em too fast. So they wouldn't know what it actually does.

With SCP-500-EX saying that it won't work I doubt-\n> \n> **Cleveland:** Come on? You're seriously going to take that charlatan's word for it? You do know that he also charges the Foundation for transportation and imagine aaaaallll of that money he would lose out on if he stopped shipping from Toledo to Sacramento.\n> \n> **Dougherty:** Yeah, but then wouldn't he just decide to not make SCP-500-EX-1?\n> \n> **Cleveland:** Eh. Even if he does it's worth a shot. The old researcher barely did any actual research because he didn't need to as his SCP was \"The Thaumiel SCP that is reducing costs\".\n> \n> **Dougherty:** You make a good point.  \n> \n> //Ten Foundation personnel walk in accompanied by SCP-500-EX and two members of security.//\n> \n> **Cleveland:** Greetings ladies and gentlemen.

All of you have already been handed a note with your designation for this test, you may take this time to memorize it if you haven't already.\n> \n> //Cleveland pauses for two minutes to let the personnel memorize their temporary identification.//\n> \n> **Cleveland:** Alright. I assume y'all are good. Today you have all been selected for a test as you all have reported to the medical bay citing symptoms ranging from migraines to cramps. As you all are aware, the standard procedure is to give you folks a sample of SCP-500-EX-1 until your condition improves, however, we are undergoing testing to discover a new means of producing SCP-500-EX-1. We believe that this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 will work exactly the same and save the Foundation expenses on trans~\n> \n> **SCP-500-EX:** Just to clarify someth'n a brief second, this new way of producing SCP-500-EX-1 likely will not work. From what they've told me, this is merely a test to permanently conclude if it will or will not. Which I am most certain it won't. But I guess the higher-ups just ain't listenin' to me! Guess it makes me more in the end so why should I care?\n> \n> **Cleveland:** Yes... thank you, Mr. Swanson. As he said, this may not be fully effective though we do have significant reasoning to believe it will.

Four subjects (TS-500-EX-2, TS-500-EX-3, TS-500-EX-7, and TS-500-EX-9) reported being symptom-free by the end of the one week period. \n> \n> -----\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-1:** Nothing changed. I had terrible cramps in my leg and they never got less severe and are still present.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-2:** I was a bit skeptical at first, but low and behold within a few hours of ingesting SCP-500-EX-1 my headache was feeling better. By day two it was gone.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-3:** Had some pretty bad sleep. By day six it was pretty much gone and by now I feel a lot better rested.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-4:** As soon as SCP-500-EX said that it wasn't gonna work I knew it wouldn't help. Sure as hell, I was right.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-5:** Felt a really bad headache and the pills didn't help with my pain like they normally do. I would say SCP-500-EX was right in that it wouldn't work.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-6:** Whilst SCP-500-EX-1 usually does help with any issues, in this case, my issue (constipation) did not get fixed by the new SCP-500-EX-1 pills.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-7:** I had been feeling nausea for about a day prior but just two days of SCP-500-EX-1 were able to relieve it. I told TS-500-EX-9 about it and he was shocked. Saying it wasn't working for him or whatnot.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-8:** After this can I get actual treatment for my fever? Cause the pills didn't do shit. I can barely focus on anything. The only thing I remember clearly is you giving me the pills that the guy said wouldn't work. Then over the week, nothing changed. What the fuck is the point of this study?\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-9:** At first the pills didn't kick in. But ironically literally right as TS-500-EX-7 told me it was working for her it started working for me. I didn't really notice it but my cramps were gradually getting better. By today it is gone.\n> \n> **TS-500-EX-10:** Had a migraine for a while and the pills didn't take away my headache. I was pretty much always skeptical from the start and it didn't improve afterwards. The pain slowly went away by around day five but I am not convinced it was the pills rather than just it being natural.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> **Note:** No current explanation has been provided to explain the decisive results shown in the trial. As such, until one is provided the experiment is to be considered a failure.

But in this case, it is critical that SCP-500-EX does not read this report. There is a high likelihood that there is a factor in the production of SCP-500-EX that we were close to discovering which SCP-500-EX attempted to halt via trying to stop the experiment prior to its start. I believe this hidden element was used on some of the subjects, and if we can isolate this factor we may even be able to halt any further purchases in favor of our own production.

All of the ones that denied it said that the pills didn't work, and the only reason SCP-500-EX-1 began to be sold was because SCP-500-EX paid the store around $10 a week to sell it while the store still got the majority of profits. Even then SCP-500-EX spent about a month having to convince people SCP-500-EX-1 worked before it finally took off.
