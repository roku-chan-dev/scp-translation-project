Nothing of note has yet taken place; I continue to travel downwards.\n\n**DAY 2:** Nothing of note took place.\n\n**DAY 3:** The color of the surrounding blood appears to be darkening in hue. It has gone from a deep crimson to a shade of almost brown. I know it's not due to lack of natural light, as I have long passed that threshold.\n\n**DAY 4:** The blood continues to darken. It's closer to black, now.\n\n**DAY 5:** Nothing of note took place.\n\n**DAY 6:** The blood has become completely black. It seems to almost swallow up the light my floodlights produce.\n\n**DAY 7:** Nothing of note took place.\n\n**DAY 8:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 9:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 10:** I've started to see little motes of light in the distance. I tried to follow one, but it never appeared to get any closer. They remind me of something, but I can't figure out what.\n\n**DAY 11:** Nothing of note again, but at least I have something to look at now.\n\n**DAY 12:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 13:** I remember what it was: I compared the lights with photos in my internal database. The motes around me are a 1-to-1 match to the stars in the night sky, transposed into 360 degrees. If my instruments did not inform me that I was, in fact, still within a body of liquid, I might mistake my environs for the Void of space.\n\n**DAY 14:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 15:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 16:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 17:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 18:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 19:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 20:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 21:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 22:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 23:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 24:** Nothing of note.\n\n**DAY 25:** Nothing of note.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"  \t\t\t   \" hide=\"  \t\t\t   \"]]**{{[DATA LOST]:}}** I understand now.
