  "title": "Translations Policy",
  "content": "This is the formal policy for Translations posted on the English Language SCP Wiki - for a list of translations and instructions for posting them, go to the [[[scp-international| International Branches Hub]]].\n\n+++ What is a translation?\n\nA translation is taking an article from another site and translating it into English to post on the SCP wiki. In cases of articles with no text (see [[[SCP-2521]]] for a very well known example), this may involve no changes. \n\n+++ What translations are allowed?\n\nIf an author has specifically asked for a work not to be translated, you are not allowed to post a translation of that work onto this wiki. Getting permission from the author to post your translation is recommended, but not required.\n\nIf the original work is not from a recognized SCP branch (see http://o5command-int.wikidot.com/branch-list for a full list), then you must obtain explicit author permission to post it here.\n\nYou must either be the author or the translator of the work to post it onto the SCP wiki, or be posting at the request of the author or translator and giving them full credit and control over the article.\n\nUnlike most articles, it is not required that the original author of the article that has been translated be a member of the SCP Wiki.\n\n+++ Proxy posting requests by staff\n\nIf an article exists on the -INT wiki, the translator may request that SCP staff post the article onto the SCP wiki. If the translator is impossible to contact, then the original author may also make the request. This only applies if the translation can be posted here anyway. \n\n+++ Changes to Translations\n\nAny site member is permitted to correct the spelling, grammar and phrasing of a translation in order to fix errors and make it more accurate to the original. In cases of disagreements, the person that posted the translation should have the final say on what the wording should be.\n\nIf minor changes are made to the original article, any site member is welcome to translate those changes and update the translation.\n\nIn the case of a full rewrite or delete of the original article, the translation will be archived (URL moved to a -arc, not archived:) or deleted, as decided by the translator and author, so that a new translation can be uploaded.\n\n+++ Author/translator rights\n\nThe translator always has the right to have their translation deleted from the SCP Wiki.\n\nThe author(s) and translator(s) will be treated as coauthors. The author can later request to have the translation deleted, but this will only be done if the translator agrees.\n\n+++ Where to post\n\nIn all cases you must post to the same unix URL as the original page. As an example, a tale from the -IT branch with the URL http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/this-is-a-tale should be posted at scp-wiki.wikidot.com/this-is-a-tale, to ensure the interwiki box in the bottom left works. \n\nWhile permitted in the past for articles like [[[SCP-179]]], going forward this policy will prohibit the posting of translations to the SCP Wiki mainlist. If posted today, [[[SCP-179]]] would need to be posted as https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-es-026, to match the URL of the Spanish original, http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/scp-es-026. This policy will not be enforced retroactively, but going forward if a translation is posted as if it were an original SCP written in English, the person posting it will be asked to decide whether to delete the translation or to rename it to match the URL and SCP designation of the original article.\n\nExceptions to this rule will be permitted at the discretion of site staff, to cover situations in which two original articles on two different wikis share the same unix URL, making it impossible for both to share the same unix URL when translated onto the same wiki or if the URL is disallowed by technical policy.\n\n+++ Licencing, tagging and metadata\n\nAll international works must have the original author included in the licencebox as the author, unless the author is also the translator.\n\nAll international works must have the international tag and, if it is from an official branch, the language tag (like _ru for russian). Translations are tagged like any other article, so if you are not familiar with tagging just tag with international and the branch name, and a tagger from MAST will fill the rest in. \n\nIf the translator is not the author then that must be noted on the metadata page. Translators should contact a moderator for this. \n\n+++ Reposting a deleted translation\n\nThe same policy for reposting deleted articles applies to translations - there must be some difference between the two posts. \n\n+++ Translations and votes\n\nTranslations that go below -10 undergo deletion, as per a normal article. Votes on translations can take into account both the quality of the translation and the subjective assessment of its content.\n\n+++ Translations from EN\n\nAll translations from English to other languages should go on the proper site, and not onto this wiki. If there is not yet an Official or Developing branch, translators are welcome to post their work on the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/unofficial:language-incubator-hub Underrepresented Language Incubator] on the International Translation Archive.",
