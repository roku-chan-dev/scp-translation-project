I can still feel a bit of smoke inside my lungs. \n\n@@ @@\n\n//The sound of footsteps stops. The breathing sounds start gradually becoming less labored.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I'm fine here for now, I think. The fire doesn't seem to have spread since I last saw it.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//A pause.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Come to think of it...\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I'm standing, uh. No clue where I am anymore. Wasn't too far from the entrance when the fire started.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I must've been in the room for, what, ten minutes? I couldn't find a way out through the smoke.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** That... How did I not pass out?\n\n@@ @@\n\n//The sound of breathing stops.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Archie, the fire might have not been real. I don't seem to have any problem breathing regularly. Bracelet says O2 saturation is at 98, too. \n\n@@ @@\n\n//Another pause, interrupted occasionally by the sound of light footsteps.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I'm standing in a small room. Can't be much bigger than a meeting room back at the site. No sign of any exits, though. \n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** There's something propped up against one of the walls. A metal box, the size of a vending machine.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Footsteps, followed by the sound of metal scraping against the wooden floor.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Oh. Must've been hollow. \n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** There's an exit through here. Looks like it leads deeper into the site, which must be something SCP-8118 is causing. I should've hit an exit a while ago.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I'm gonna go through, but it'll be a tight fit. The opening seems to lead somewhere, from the lights I can see a ways in, but the passage itself is barely wide enough for me to be able to fit through. Gonna have to- yeah. Lean into it a bit.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//The sound of footsteps on concrete is heard for the following 5 minutes.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I don't think I'm getting any closer. The light still looks about as far away. Don't know if it's an anomaly or a trick of the light, though.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//The sound of footsteps on concrete is heard for the following 10 minutes, and abruptly stops.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Fuck. It was an anomaly.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** At some point, The opening I came through disappeared. I don't know when, I stopped paying attention barely a couple of minutes ago. It was a couple hundred feet from me every time, too.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I'm gonna stay here for a second. Need to know what to do.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//The sound of footsteps on concrete is heard for the following 40 minutes.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Silence.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I, uh. \n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I got nothing.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** The light does not grow brighter or dimmer no matter what direction I move in. I definitely can't break through the wall, unless I have a sledgehammer in the survival kit y'all sent me.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I think- \n\n@@ @@\n\n//A pause.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I think I'm gonna use it. The thing.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Rustling can be heard, followed by a series of electronic sounds as a device is powered on. A low hum can be heard in the recording.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** You know... I don't even know what it does. \n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I didn't want to know, I think. The guys at briefing told me to turn it on if I knew I wasn't gonna make it. They told me they could explain what the device would do, if I wanted them to. The way they said that was all I needed to know.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** They said it was a last resort, but saying it should only be used if I am sure I can't make it back makes me doubt that.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//A beeping sound.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** 'Armed'. Yeah. That's what I'd call something the user could survive.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I don't have any last words. I could've had some, but then I wouldn't be the person being sent here, would I?\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Fuck it.
