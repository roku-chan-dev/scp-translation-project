As many would know, I took part in the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/visual-archives-art-contest Visual Archives Art Contest]. My personal challenge was to make something related to Gold Proposal/Amoni-Ram for each of the eligible categories. This failed, as there were 5 eligible categories in total, but I was only able to draw something for 3 of them. Regardless, I'm very proud even of this. Below you can find my entries, together with some flavor text! \n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Tales and Other Formats]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Amiss-lapis-visual-archives/tales_and_other.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"fancyborder\"]]\nThere was no tent anymore. There was no shared cloak. There was a metal throne, and in it sat a man with the shepherd’s eyes, but the body of a god. He was bare-chested, furs hanging from his waist, and a golden shine on his arm and leg. He leaned back in the throne, dark eyes staring ahead.\n\nThe figure in front of him was barely recognizable. Long blond hair, fuladh wings spread, bare and exposed for her Emperor. Her dress lay around her ankles, and she trembled in the cold night wind.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Classic SCPs]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Amiss-lapis-visual-archives/classic_scps.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"fancyborder\"]]\n**ARAM:** Don't ask me how I know. It is not your place. But delete it.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**ARAM: I SAID DELETE IT.**\n\n//[Sounds of laptop opening, clicking.]//\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** I… okay. Done.\n\n**ARAM:** Good girl. You played the role quite well. But you felt it watching us too, didn't you?\n\n**NUSSBAUM:** … I felt… something.\n\n**ARAM:** There are bigger things at stake now. And you **will** obey me.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Modern SCPs]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Amiss-lapis-visual-archives/modern_scps.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"round blue\"]]\nThis one has no corresponding quote. It's a totally light-hearted piece and a meme redraw, with Bileath, the Empress who was the most well-off out of them all,[[footnote]] Or at least, that's how it //was// back when I first started this drawing. The release of Fratricide quickly contested this statement. [[/footnote]] giving gentle encouragement to the other Empresses featured in 8600. The sloppy coloring and line style was an intentional choice, for better or for worse. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n _\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** all images\n> **Author:** [[*user Miss Lapis]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:miss-lapis-visual-archives SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> This page contains an excerpt from \"ROUNDERHOUSE's Gold Proposal\" by Rounderhouse, from the SCP Wiki.
