SCP-4653-1 is stored in standard liquid containment units and should be regularly checked for leakage. \n\nFollowing recent developments, any building used for the containment or study of SCP-4653 must comply with the NFPA-780 SILPS[[footnote]] Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems [[/footnote]]. Any instance of the species //Aquila chrysaetos//[[footnote]] Known colloquially as the golden eagle. [[/footnote]] seen in its vicinity is to be monitored due to increased risk of aggression.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=aphid_honeydew.jpg|\n    caption=An instance of SCP-4653 producing SCP-4653-1.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-4653 is an undocumented species of the //Aphidoidea// superfamily. Its only anomalous property is the secretion of a saccharine narcotic liquid designated SCP-4653-1 from its anus. \nWhen a subject first ingests SCP-4653-1, they will begin to develop a small pouch on the lefthand side of their peritoneum, directly connected to the large intestine. Once the pouch is fully developed (a process that takes several days), all components of the digestive system not directly leading to and from it will begin to atrophy. \n\nDue to this degeneration, most foods can no longer be digested properly; however, the newly formed pouch allows the subject to subsist on small amounts[[footnote]] Tests on the effects of long-term consumption are in progress. [[/footnote]] of SCP-4653-1 with no apparent detrimental effects. Notably, as a subject continues to rely on SCP-4653-1 as their only source of nutrition, their opinion of its taste will become more positive over time. \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-4653 was brought to the Foundation's attention in March of 2011 following reports from Litochoro, Greece of a nearby grove of trees sprouting “ambrosia” from their bark. Foundation agents quarantined the grove under the cover story of a new outbreak of //Myzus persicae// and removed SCP-4653 from its trees.\n\n\n**Addendum as of 2012-01-11:** \nDr. Dorothy Bruton has been relieved of her duties as Head Researcher pending confirmation of alleged misconduct. The following email has been logged due to its relevant content as required by RAISA Statute ID9807-E.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** SCP-4653 Research Team ([# research_4653@site-66.scpfoundation.int])\n**From:** Human Resources ([# hr@site-66.scpfoundation.int])\n**Subject:** Staffing Change\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nHello all!\nAs of today, Dr. Bruton will no longer be supervising research of SCP-4653. Dr. Stichol will be taking over her duties.\nIn addition, I would like to reiterate that while taking __anything__ home with you from the Site is strictly prohibited without prior approval, attempting to remove anomalous materials is grounds for immediate termination of employment with potential for further investigation. So for both your sake and ours, please keep all your work in the lab!\n\nMary Coccinell\nHuman Resources Specialist\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum as of 2012-01-14:** \nDuring the initial investigational sweep of Dr. Bruton's office, five handwritten letters were found in her desk drawer. Each letter's envelope is devoid of postage, instead featuring a small holographic image of a rainbow in the upper right corner. A date has been written on each letter's envelope in Dr. Bruton's handwriting and is assumed to be the date of reception.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Letter Received 2011-03-13\" hide=\"- Letter Received 2011-03-13\"]]\n[[div class=\"nobleletter\"]]\n[[size larger]]\nHow foolish are you, that you think you may claim the nectar and ambrosia of the gods without consequence? The taste is not suitable for mortal lips! If you do not return our flock by choice, we will descend and take them from the burning wreckage of your temple. You may think yourselves strong, but nothing can protect a man from the sky above him.\nYou have one week. Seven days, due to my divine generosity, before I fry every mortal creature within five hundred podes of our property.\nThis will be your only warning.\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Letter Received 2011-05-25\" hide=\"- Letter Received 2011-05-25\"]]\n[[div class=\"nobleletter\"]]\n[[size larger]]\nDo you find divine rage humorous? You place poles on your roof to catch my vengeance and act as if you have won the game. But you greatly underestimate the sheer power and persistence of a god’s wrath!\nHowever. I acknowledge that you have a potent bargaining chip in your possession. So, I am allowing you this single chance to request a boon. I have the power of a pantheon at my disposal. Whatever you wish for, you may have for the simplest of trades.\n\nI have seen from my throne that you are a woman who yet denies herself the infinite pleasures of womanhood. With a wave of my hand, I could have you swept off your feet by a man or woman who fits so perfectly against you, it's as if I designed them that way.\n\nOr are you more fixated on your 'scientific' pursuits? I've known many a philosopher; it is not a novel craving. Return the flock, and I will peel back the surface of the universe for you and let you play surgeon on its inner workings. I can tell you anything.\n\nAll you need to do is return the voracious and their ambrosia. I will give you whatever your mortal heart can conceive of!\n\nAh, and if the temptation is insufficient, perhaps your sympathy will tip your hand. You must know by now of the effects of ambrosia. After tasting the food of the gods, how could anything compare? \n\nNothing can compare. Nothing can even come close. We are trying, of course. My children are feasting, but without the nectar of our home, the food sits in our stomachs and rots. We are starving to death, Dr. Bruton, full of food more excellent than you could ever dream of. You are killing us.\n\nBut you can make things right, Doctor, it is not too late! My children’s eyes are full of desperation, yes, but they have not gone dark yet. Request your boon and return what was taken, and whatever rage you’ve instilled in us will soon be eclipsed by relief.\nBut metanoia will not be a possibility for long, Dr. Bruton. And I do not think you wish to experience the alternative. \n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Letter Received 2011-07-18\" hide=\"- Letter Received 2011-07-18\"]]\n[[div class=\"nobleletter\"]]\n[[size larger]]\nMy son died today.\n\nThe first thing he ever asked me for was a bow. He wanted so to have the skill of archery that his sister came to naturally. I will never forget the look of concentration in his eyes as he drew back the bow and fired and sent a gleaming shaft of light soaring past the target and over the hills, his mother and I laughed, and laughed, and laughed, and\n\nThe first sound he made was a laugh, I think.\n\nMy firstborn son, Apollo, my first sign that I could be something greater than my Father, my first true redemption.\n\nThe first thing that touched his lips was ambrosia.\n\nMy son starved to death today.\n\nThere is no rage left in me. Whatever is left is something new. I have boiled down all the wrath in my gut, it seems, to a solid core of //something new//. The hunger is rotting it.\n\nYou are going to rot too, Doctor Bruton. \n\nYou are going to //rot//, Dotty Bruton, and I will watch. My eyes are not what they once were, but the eagles still call me their god with pride in their voices, and I have seen you, Dotty Rhea Bruton, I have seen your tiny, mortal little life play out from the beginning and it was nothing. Absolutely nothing. You have studied and read and worked your entire life to become something to do //something// and you will never achieve anything so important or so terrible as what you have done here in killing my son, my son, my\n\nFine. \n\nFine. As a show of good faith, I will give you your boon in advance.\n\nI have decided, Dotty, in my infinite, divine, inimitable wisdom, that you no longer get to die. You no longer get to escape your pathetic scrap of an existence. Another way we are above you! Starving gods may take forever to die, but at least we get to die! Did you know I could do that? After what you took from us? I will get to die, but you, your eyes, your hidden secret organs, the eagles will descend and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and peck and\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Letter Received 2011-10-13\" hide=\"- Letter Received 2011-10-13\"]]\n[[div class=\"nobleletter\"]]\n[[size larger]]\nMy children are all dying, Doctor.

If you save her. It will happen either way, but you will be able to boast. \n\nBut you can already boast, can’t you? You've killed gods without raising a finger.\n\nI'm humming her the tune, the one my Mother taught me to drown out the crunching sounds. I think it’s helping. I’ll teach it to you too.\n[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nNothing is currently known about the original sender of the letters. However, given their clear association with SCP-4653, MTF Psi-29029 (\"Alpine Echo\") has been dispatched to the Pieria region of Greece along with 100 liters of SCP-4653-1 for the purpose of locating and recovering the author.\n\n**Addendum as of 2012-06-15:** \nThe following letter was delivered this morning to the office of Dr. Stichol, current supervisor of the SCP-4653 research team. Unlike the previous correspondence, its envelope contained postage and a 2012-06-04 postmark giving the letter's origin as Crete. According to postal service logs, delivery was delayed due to the moderate illegibility of the address. A response team has been dispatched to its origin with another 100 liters of SCP-4653-1.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Letter Transcript\" hide=\"- Letter Transcript\"]]\n[[div class=\"lastletter\"]]\n[[size larger]]\nThey're all gone now\n _\nReturned to where they came\n _\n _\nThey all came from me\n _\nFather to Earth to Father again\n _\n _\nHow is my handwriting?

Nor is our purpose to gain power and influence. Our mission, across the entire organization, is to maintain as livable a world as possible for as many people as possible. We secure and we contain, yes, but only in service to those we protect.\n\nWith that in mind, I would like to make something very clear. If you try to work around the Foundation's protocols in secrecy for some perceived great good, you're not a hero. You're a fool. The Foundation has a hell of a lot of experience when it comes to figuring out the best course of action to help people. Keeping information from the organization at large because you think you can do better will do nothing but cause unnecessary damage. And, hell, if you're already doing the right thing, the Foundation can probably do it faster and with a lot more manpower.\n\nWe are not cruel. We are not cold. We simply do what is necessary to keep the world from falling apart. If you can't tell the difference, then find a new line of work.\n\nDr. Myrmica\nSite Director\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4652]]] | SCP-4653 | [[[SCP-4654]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** aphid_honeydew.jpg\n> **Name:** Blattlaus mit Honigtau 6644\n> **Author:** Amada44\n> **License:** CC BY 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blattlaus_mit_Honigtau_6644.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
