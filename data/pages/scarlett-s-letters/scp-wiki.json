It causes them to spend every waking second they have attempting to ruin another person's life and take what they have. Jealousy is a memetic phenomenon, and it's destroying all of us.\n\nOne\n\nBy\n\nOne.\n\n------\n\n**09/10/████**\n\nI've discovered another anomaly.\n\nNighttime isn't normal. Nighttime strips us of our energy. Nighttime causes us to go to sleep\n\nNo this isn't normal everyone thinks it is.\n\nBut they don't see it.\n\nWe're meant to be meant to be awake, spending 24 hours showing the world what we can do.\n\nBut then\n\nThis motherfucking sleep comes along and strips it away\n\nIt's not normal\n\n------\n\n**09/11/████**\n\nWhy do some people not understand that I am very smart\n\naa\n\n------\n\n**09/12/████**\n\nSCP-001 is the nighttime\n\nbecause it shouldn't exist\n\nbut it does\n\n\n**09/13/████**\n\nI've discovered another anomaly\n\nA memetic phenomenon that makes people run out of ideas\n\nIt sucks away their creativity\n\n------\n\n**09/14/████**\n\nyou know, I should start writing these on the database\n\n------\n\n**09/15/████**\n\n**Item #:** SCP-0000\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-0000 cannot be contained.\n\n**Description:** SCP-0000 is the jealousy of man. SCP-0000 has affected an estimate of 78% of the population. The origin of SCP-0000 is unknown, but it has been discovered that SCP-0000 can be provoked by intense emotion.\n\nSCP-0000 was initially believed to be an ordinary human emotion. On 09/09/████, while investigating an unrelated call, Agent Scarlett witnessed a child kick the ground and explode. It is assumed that she was jealous of another child's toy.\n\n------\n\nI think that sounds good\n\n------\n\n**09/16/████**\n\nI've discovered another anomaly\n\nfucking elizabeth wilbert\n\nshe's anomalously a bitch\n\n------\n\n**09/17/████**\n\nI posted another anomaly to the database today\n\ntake that one down too\n\nelizabeth\n\n------\n\n**09/18/████**\n\nthat was not a challenge\n\n------\n\n**09/21/████**\n\ntook a break from writing\n\nI have another anomaly\n\n------\n\n**09/23/████**\n\nokay posted new anomaly\n\n------\n\n**09/25/████**\n\nelizabeth said she banned me from accessing the database\n\nbut I can still access it\n\nfuuuuuuuuuuk you\n\n------\n\n**09/29/████**\n\n{{A single shining star}}\n{{Crashing to the ground}}\n{{It’s all because of you}}\n{{Bottom text}}\n\n{{The moon is in the sky}}\n{{The moon is shining bright}}\n{{Everyone likes the moon}}\n{{I’ve never liked the moon}}\n\n{{SCP-0000}}\n{{Object Class: Blank}}\n{{SCP-0000 is human jealousy}}\n{{It plagues everyone on this earth}}\n\n{{The moon is full}}\n{{The moon is shining in my face}}\n{{The moon blinds my eyes}}\n{{I want to blow up the moon}}\n\n{{You can’t shine sun}}\n{{I’m the fucking moon}}\n{{And I ultimately steal your spotlight}}\n{{Fuck you}}\n\n{{Fuck the stars}}\n{{Fuck the moon}}\n{{Fuck the night}}\n{{Bottom text}}\n\n{{SCP-0000 is why people don’t like me}}\n{{SCP-0000 is why the moon blinds me}}\n{{The moon is jealous of me}}\n{{The moon silences me}}\n\n{{I will not be silenced}}\n{{I will shine in the day}}\n{{I will show the world my discoveries}}\n{{Fuck off moon}}\n\n{{My name is Epon Scarlett}}\n{{Agent Epon Scarlett}}\n{{Ignore otherwise}}\n{{Bottom text}}\n\n------\n\n**10/01/████**\n\n**Item #:** SCP-0000\n\n**Object Class:** Tragic\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** N/A\n\n**Description:** SCP-0000 is the fact that many people don’t understand Agent Scarlett.

POI-44008 is a reality altering entity (class undetermined), and is immune to amnestics and memetic hazards. Its location is currently unknown. Any information/updates regarding POI-44008 are to be reported to Prof. Wilbert as quickly as possible.\n\nPOI-44008 was scheduled for demotion due to reckless behavior. After demotion along with removal from the Foundation at a later date, it still had access to Foundation files. The Foundation was alerted, and investigation is ongoing.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n> fuuuuuuuuuuk u:)\n> \n> -- Agent Epon Scarlett\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
