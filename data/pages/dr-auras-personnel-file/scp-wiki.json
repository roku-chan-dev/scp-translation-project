She had already assessed its unusual differences, contained the animal and provided a full list of habitat requirements and dietary recommendations to the containment team upon their arrival. Her evaluation upon employment has noted her as 'Friendly, open-minded with one hell of a stubborn streak especially where her work is concerned'. She has also been noted to be incredibly trusting of the Foundation staff in general, though whether that is a good or bad thing remains yet to be seen. \n\nAura works on the principle that even though an SCP animal may need containment, a good habitat may make them less likely to attempt containment breach.\n\n**Additional Notes:** \"Can you please stop asking me to look at SCPs that are objects made to look like animals? I deal with the flesh and blood creatures, not ones made of bullets or trees.\" - Dr. Aura\n\n**SCPs Archived:**\n--SCP-582--\n--SCP-740--\n[[[SCP-805]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=ZKZombiekitty]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** auramasked.jpg\n> **Name:** Woman redhead natural portrait 1.jpg\n> **Author:** dusdin on flickr, cropped by Gridge\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Woman_redhead_natural_portrait_1.jpg\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
