At this time, the nature of SCP-001 is poorly understood but continues to be developed as new SCP-001-1 instances are appended to this file.\n\nSCP-001-1 is the collective designation for a series of documents that are inexplicably appended to the SCP-001 file location. SCP-001-1 have proven resistant to various deletion and relocation attempts, and are also somehow present in archived versions of this file dating back to 1970/01/01. SCP-001-1 appear to be records from an unknown civilization (known as Lesser Archivists) documenting their understanding of SCP-001 and its impacts on their belief systems. The validity of these documents remains unknown.\n\nSCP-001 was discovered on 2001/07/03 after Site-01 database security systems detected three unauthorized updates to the SCP-001 file, which was previously used to store a series of retirement proposals known as the Heritage Collection. Only the third of these updates was visible, as the first two had inexplicably not been archived. Upon inspection, it was found that the file had been replaced with SCP-001-1. This edit was made using an unknown set of login credentials, which did not correspond to any user in the Site-01 SCiPnet system.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n----\n+++ __ADDENDUM 001.1:__ {{SCP-001-1}}\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶VIEW ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷HIDE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\" style=\"background: #ffccaa;\"]]\n= **IN THE THREE-GRO EL-DO AND FOURTH ANNUM OF THE TRUE WORLD**\n----\nA prayer to the Primordial Form:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= //To the strengthful and all-making Primordial, we are indebted.

This corresponds with an increase in fractured timelines and conflicting causalities, as detected by the Department of Temporal Anomalies. \n\nAs such, I am formally proposing Project 001-KH-1, to study SCP-001 and the relationship between its component entities. If methods of influencing SCP-001 are found, Project 001-KH-1 is to pursue any available means of re-balancing SCP-001's component entities. \n\nIf the Primordial Form is weakened so as to pose sufficient risks to baseline causality, it is to be revived through collective belief and perception. Personnel are to be reminded of the significance of SCP-001.\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]]//- O5-1, Overseer of Records and Information Security//[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou are accessing file 3 of 4.
