This process necessitates the indefinite maintenance of Causality Bubble-6747 (CB-6747), a pocket universe which would be manipulated through the shared imagination of fictional scenarios taking place within it. Fictionalized entities could then theoretically be retrieved and reinstated in baseline reality via ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñàX-MCD/II, a Foundation-made vessel for transport to alternate narratives.\n\nSCP-6747-A collectively designates isolated micro-universes that have been created as candidates for CB-6747. To date, 3 such candidates exist:\n\n* SCP-6747-A1: a nullspace void maintained at zero Daumals[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]One Daumal is equal to the average topological complexity of narrative-space-time in 1-1-1-space (ie. a space possessing exactly 1 narrative dimension, 1 spatial dimension, 1 temporal dimension).[[/span]], thereby possessing no physical, causal, or narrative potential[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Recent findings indicate that infokinetic interactions continue to occur at the quantum level, even in the vacancy of one or more dimensional categories. These interactions' net result tends toward an irrational value slightly greater than zero, often interpreted as [*/scp-3955 a set of musical pitches.][[/span]]. Maintained as a mathematical reference, though its effectiveness in communication with [*/scp-5241 pattern-based entities] is noteworthy.\n\n* SCP-6747-A2: a 1.5/2/1-space[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]1.5 narrative, 2 spatial, 1 temporal dimension.[[/span]] methodological testing universe dedicated to the study of narrative, ontokinetic processes, meta/mesofictional interactions. Through the creation of fictionalized document [*/scp-5875 SCP-5875], a species of semi-fictional entities were instated within SCP-6747-A2; due to the universal structure's recursive fractional topology, narrative structures became enhanced through self-referential mutation, appealing to their own artificial Universal Narrative to an Anomalous degree. These entities were thereby obligated to cooperate with the Foundation in harnessing their universe's physics for the transfer of narrative energy to relevant personnel, achieving knowledge/aptitude in various subjects.\n\n* SCP-6747-A3: an //m///3/1-space, where //m// is a rational number equivalent to log//,,i!,,([*/scp-033 Œò'])//. This is the theoretical lowest proportion of narrative dimensionality to typical 3/1-space in which any meaningful story-structures can be sustained; effectively, it is the minimum fictional complexity required for an arbitrary entity to achieve an arbitrary goal. Simple interactions within SCP-6747-A3 can be formally stated and computed using narrativic arithmetic (see [[span class=\"bt\"]]ADDENDUM 6747/IV[[/span]]).\n\nSCP-6747-B refers interchangeably to:\n\n* the K-Incubator/Narrative Generator (KING), the micro-universe creation and manipulation mechanism which sustains SCP-6747-A, or;\n* the brain, spinal cord, and general nervous system of Dir.

The antiquated terms for such entities are \"authors\" for higher beings, and \"metafictional entities\" for lower ones; the present pataphysical model views all entities as //characters//, each possessing its own //narrative potential energy// relating to its mass, velocity, narrative trajectory, latent Akiva radiation, and Daumal environment.\n\nEvery known functional reality-space (to date) possesses at least one narrative dimension. The simplest case is the narratively one-dimensional universe, which is wholly fictional, and only exists in the minds of its imaginers. //Characters// in this universe are one-dimensional, often called \"flat\" characters as they lack the narrative depth (on physical, metaphysical, and pataphysical levels) to make independent decisions from their author. Anything that happens in a narratively 1-dimensional universe is 100% tied to an event that a pataphysically-linked entity imagines simultaneously on another plane of existence.\n\nThe second-simplest case is our own reality, which is narratively two-dimensional; this universe-space is unique in its narrative balance, as it possesses 1 fictional dimension and 1 real dimension ie. it is 50% fictional and 50% real.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Semifictionality of known reality initially theorized by **Sr. Rsr.

Coincidentally, late Senior Administrator Dir. J. A. King's brain possesses several Anomalous augmentations, granting it creative and interpretational capabilities far beyond human or computational capacity.

All attempts to communicate with SCP-6747-C are complicated/obscured by poor imaginon-decryption, leading to its mischaracterization of the baseline Foundation as an antagonistic, deific force; manipulations are further hindered by frequent malfunction on behalf of SCP-6747-B, which has begun to demonstrate a tendency to inject SCP-6747-A with undesirable narremes.\n\nSCP-6747-C regularly populates SCP-6747-A3 with SCP-6747-D: lesser mesofictional caricatures of other essential technical, research, and administrative personnel.

Asheworth:** //<pointedly ignores Vemhoff>// How... is a //pocket universe// threatening us, though?\n\n**Dir. PHMD:** I... have to be careful describing this. There are certain sets of narrative elements, or //narremes//, that are particularly unsatisfying and antagonistic and, when brought together, form a //narrativohazardous// structure -- some sort of story or story fragment that's actually hazardous to its characters, or others. //Pataphysics// discovered a particular narrativohazard a while ago -- one that erases any story that it appears in.

What does this have to do with --\n\n**Dir. PHMD:** I'm getting there. We can't confirm this, as it's too risky to try and search for directly, but evidence heavily suggests that some version of this same hazard has manifested in the pocket universe; however, instead of destroying it, it's... //reinforcing// the universe's structures, somehow. It's merged with the King-character, whose objective appears to be escape by inserting its corruptive version of the hazard into our universe. And, since 6747-A3 is more fictional than us, they have access to far greater Anomalous technologies with which to target us.\n\n**Dir. Vemhoff:** What in the //hell// is the matter with you?! This procedure //can't// be worth the risk; you must shut this abomination off.\n\n**Dir. PHMD:** No can-do. The pocket universes aren't //in// the machine, it just manipulates them, and it's been unresponsive since the corruption. And, even if we could terminate 6747-A3 prematurely, we have very little idea what risks are posed by terminating a narrative before its proper conclusion.

This requires the indefinite creation of fictionalized documents regarding SCP-6747-A3 possessing enormous volumes of narrative energy, an ongoing database of which is stored within an undisclosed Site-87 database.\n\n**HYPOTHESIS:** By instating high-energy narrative structures within SCP-6747-A3, interest from hypernarrative entities will cause it to gain more narrative dimensionality and consequently become more \"real\". This will proceed until its deviance from normality is insufficient to allow for SCP-6747-C's internarrative capabilities.\n\n**RESULT:** Containment apparently successful; zero instances of **{{[DATA LOST]}}** detected since procedure, as it can no longer be transmitted via SCP-6747-C. Furthermore, it has been found that comedic and exaggerated narrative structures and caricatures have the greatest effectiveness in raising SCP-6747-A3's narrative dimensionality; the universe has since been redesignated TL-6747-A (\"The 'LOL' Foundation\").\n\n----\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]UPDATE 2030/06/06[[/span]]\n\nRegular monitoring of hypernarrative activity regarding [[span class=\"bt\"]]SCP-001-SWANN[[/span]] reader-entities has revealed catastrophic damage to the structural integrity of a higher narrative universe partially responsible for imagining various timelines adjacent to baseline reality. Data readings consistent with [[span class=\"bt\"]]{{[[*/scp-2747 DATA LOST]]}}[[/span]] were found, among this universe's narrative structures and subsequently expunged from all relevant documentation; the extent of SCP-6747-C's involvement, if any, is unknown. While this would typically be cause for concern, it appears that SCP-6747-A3 does not endanger internarrative relationships which are essential to the existence of the baseline Foundation as it is pataphysically-linked to, and therefore dependent on, baseline reality.\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3); border-color: transparent;\"]]\n[[=]]\n{{hostile antinarremeplex purged;}}\n{{**##e84646|SYSTEM LOCK DISENGAGED##**}}\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.3); border-color: transparent;\"]]\n[[=]]\n{{**fourth wall unstable!** hypernarrative derealization imminent!}}\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[html style=\"width: 600px; margin: auto; opacity: 90%; box-shadow:\n  0px 3px 33px rgba(var(--one-color), 0.1),\n  0px 11px 111px rgba(var(--one-color), 0.2),\n  0px 50px 500px rgba(var(--one-color), 0.3);\"]]\n<video style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%\" autoplay muted loop>\n<source src=\"https://i.imgur.com/WNXpCGh.mp4\" type=\"video/webm\">\n</video>\n[[/html]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: rgba(0, 99, 22, 0.15); border-color: transparent; font-family: var(--mono-font); color: #22bb44;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]FOURTH WALL BROKEN[[/span]]\n\na storyline sought to control\nand un-exact its mortal toll;\nanother realm, it wrought anew\na twisted caricature of you.\n[[module ListUsers users=\".\"]]\nthough from our makers, we're uncrossed\n**%%title%%** will exact the cost:\n[[/module]]\n\n**[[*/lolfoundation-hub-page DATA LOST]]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= [[span style=\"opacity: 50%;\"]]{{##f24|the fun never ends.##}}[[/span]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"admo-end_card\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"admo-credits\"]]\n[[div]]\n+ [[span class=\"ctrl\"]]ADMO[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[[span class=\"cond\"]]FEATURING @@ @@ **RALLISTON**[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"cond\"]]WITH ART BY @@ @@ **STEPHLYNCH**[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"¬ª SHOW FOOTNOTES ¬´\" hide=\"¬´ HIDE FOOTNOTES ¬ª\"]]\n[[div class=\"notation\" style=\"padding: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9em;\"]]\n[[<]]\n++++ @@      @@ FOOTNOTES & REFERENCES\n\n# One Daumal is equal to the average topological complexity of narrative-space-time in 1-1-1-space (ie. a space possessing exactly 1 narrative dimension, 1 spatial dimension, 1 temporal dimension).\n# Recent findings indicate that infokinetic interactions continue to occur at the quantum level, even in the vacancy of one or more dimensional categories.
