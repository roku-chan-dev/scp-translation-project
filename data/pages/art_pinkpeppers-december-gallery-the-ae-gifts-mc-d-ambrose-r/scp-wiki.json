Hav been quite busy the whole December and got lost in my schedule (can only get 30min per day to draw my own stuff :/) so unfortunately this month‚Äôs gallery is very plain and also no time to finish the comics or sarkics D:‚Ä¶ hmm however i think the Art Exchange result turned out nice! Im not even sure abt wat sort of grammar im using right now but anyway, i wish u may enjoy these artworks! \n\nFirsr of all, the Art Exchange gifts!‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXA7GV.png]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXALMF.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**Merry Christmas To Everyone!**//\n\n//{{As you know, Br√≥nach cannot see the real night sky, so I think there should be a lot of stars in the illusion I give her and each one of them could tell a golden memory with her friends, which brings both happiness and sadness.\nAnd Kuobach is showing how they are thinking about Christmas!\nSince [[*user IronShears]] figured the gifter puzzle out before revealing, the last one is your bonus! Somehow im wondering how easy i could be identified by my art style‚Ä¶or my weird grammar.}}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThen the monthly artwork collection. Very plain as i said :DDD\n\nMC&D‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXECRK.png]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXEAqH.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**The Darkness**//\n\n//{{I just can‚Äôt resist the charm of Iris Dark! O M G I LOVE HER SO MUCH.}}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAmbrose Restaurant‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è‚¨áÔ∏è\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXElQS.png]]\n\n[[image https://s11.ax1x.com/2023/12/31/piXEGZj.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n//**The Greed**//\n\n//{{It‚Äôs for showing how I consider these two characters since Marius is shrewd and Chaz would eat 60+ meals during vacation. }}//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOk thats all for this December :DDD well not the ALL all bc i also hav done nearly 70 pages of storyboard and a lot more unfinished illustrations(too messy to be posted sry) so thats all for now! Thank u for clicking this page! I love u guys! HAPPY NEW YEAR!! üé®üéâ‚ù£Ô∏è",
