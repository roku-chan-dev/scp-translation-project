Please see the bottom of the page for a newer version. This is version **3** of **4**, updated on **February 9, 2022**. Important changes from the previous version have been highlighted in ##blue|blue##.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3916\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** One small swarm of SCP-3916-1 is contained in a modified biological containment cell at ##blue|Provisional Site-136. All exposed surfaces in the containment cell are to be covered in at least 1cm of solid hardened glass. The cell is to be inspected daily, and any damage repaired immediately. A minimum of two identical backup containment cells are to be maintained for use during repairs.##\n\nThe swarm is to be fed daily with 500kg of fresh plant matter. Excess instances (past roughly 1500) are to be terminated as necessary. Any instances that escape containment are to be terminated by ##blue|fire. In the case of a partial containment breach at Provisional Site-136, MTF δ-17 is to help re-contain or terminate the escaped instances while the site is being evacuated; if a full containment breach occurs, Provisional Site-136 is to be destroyed via its built-in nuclear warhead.## Any personnel wishing to conduct experiments on SCP-3916 should contact its current head researcher. Personnel entering SCP-3916-1's containment chamber are to wear ##blue|class-12G## protective equipment.\n\nWild instances of SCP-3916 should be eradicated immediately and thoroughly, unless otherwise notified. The Foundation is currently cooperating with the government of the United States of America (through the cover of LARPA, see Addendum) to capture, kill, or otherwise contain all wild SCP-3916 instances, as they have been recognized to pose a significant threat to humanity at large. MTF δ-17 \"Metarhizium\" is to be notified of any outstanding reports of SCP-3916.\n\nBased on previous and projected damage, any uncontrolled population of SCP-3916-1 is likely to cause a Class-ARBH event. All Level 3 and higher personnel dealing with SCP-3916 are to read the [[[ARBH class debrief file|ARBH-Class Event Debriefing File]]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-3916 is a species of insect that physically resembles //Chortoicetes terminifera// (Australian Plague Locust). There are two subspecies of SCP-3916, designated SCP-3916-0 and SCP-3916-1. All instances of SCP-3916-1 are currently contained at Site-121, while all wild instances are SCP-3916-0. SCP-3916 has two anomalous behavioural traits of particular note.\n\nFirst, SCP-3916 eats at an alarming rate. A single instance is able to consume roughly 100g of matter per second. SCP-3916-0 has only been found to eat fresh plant matter, ##blue|while SCP-3916-1 can eat almost any matter, with the only known exception being silicon-based glass. SCP-3916-1 seems to prefer fresh organic matter over other matter.##\n\nSecond, SCP-3916 reproduce unusually quickly, and do so asexually. An instance of SCP-3916 will grow visually larger as it consumes more food, and after a certain size threshold, split into two instances of SCP-3916. Both new instances will be fully-formed adults. Each \"cloning\" takes a significant amount of consumption, currently estimated at 500g of food ##blue|(SCP-3916-1 can consume non-organic matter but must consume organic matter to reproduce)##. However, due to its eating speed, SCP-3916 swarms grow very quickly.\n\n##blue|SCP-3916-1 has developed a remarkable resistance to chemical-based attacks such as poisons or corrosive substances, likely as a side effect of its ability to consume them. It is completely immune to all conventional chemical attacks, and highly resistant against Foundation-engineered and anomalous substances. Physical force is also unreliable as SCP-3916-1 can eat through any weapons used against them (glass-based weapons have not been found to be practical). The most reliable ways to eliminate SCP-3916-1 are currently intense heat and radiation.##\n\n**History:**  The Foundation was first made aware of the existence of SCP-3916 when a small swarm of them escaped the captivity of [[[critter-profile-genghis|GoI-466]]] (\"Wilson's Wildlife Services\") in a transportation accident in in Maupin, Oregon, along US Route 26. GoI-466 contacted the Foundation for assistance in containment, and the majority of the SCP-3916 instances were captured or eliminated. GoI-466 informed the Foundation of the nature of SCP-3916, and the few instances that remained uncontained were deemed to pose a significant threat. The uncontained instances of SCP-3916 spread rapidly across Oregon and into California, prompting the United States of America's government to take action, and leading to the formation of LARPA.\n\nSCP-3916-1's ability to consume animal matter is currently presumed to be a mutation accidentally induced during experimentation. This development was observed during Incident 3916-A, during which a researcher entered SCP-3916's containment chamber, and was attacked and eaten. No such mutations have been seen in the wild SCP-3916, and as such the instances contained at Site-121 and the wild instances are currently considered separate subspecies.\n\n##blue|SCP-3916-1's ability to consume non-organic substances is believed to be a spontaneous mutation. This development was first noticed when the inside of SCP-3916-1's containment chamber suffered repeated damage, prompting review of surveillance footage. Videos showed SCP-3916-1 seemingly eating at the chamber's walls. This ability, and the inability of SCP-3916-1 to consume glass, were confirmed during further testing.##\n\n**Addendum - LARPA:** Due to the nature of SCP-3916, the Foundation determined that it would be overly difficult to eliminate wild instances without alerting the general public. Thus, the Foundation contacted the USA government and negotiated the formation of [[[The Morality of Insects|LARPA]]] (Locust Active Removal and Prevention Agency), an official government organization funded and staffed entirely by the Foundation. LARPA serves as a front through which the Foundation can openly take action against wild SCP-3916. Site-121, the ##blue|former## containment site of SCP-3916-1, has been designated as LARPA headquarters. ##blue|Provisional Site-136, the current containment site of SCP-3916-1, is designated \"Boromine Branch\", and is an official LARPA site.##\n\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; width: 96%;font-family: courier; font-size: 1em;border:solid 2px #d80000; background:#dbdbdb;\"]]\n[[table style=\"margin: 10px 0px 10px 0px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; width: 45%\"]]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3916/offset/1 <<<< View older version]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; width: 50%; float: right\"]]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3916/offset/3 View newer version >>>>]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]",
