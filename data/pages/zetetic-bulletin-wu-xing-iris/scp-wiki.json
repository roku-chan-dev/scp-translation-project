As most of that region has, until recently, been sealed off to the general populace due to internal governmental strife, there have been very few opportunities to obtain the region’s folkloric items and explain their alleged “magical” properties.\n\nToday, I have the pleasure of presenting to you a rare curiosity, generously retrieved by a team of RUBIES in Guizhou.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++++ VISUAL ASSESSMENT\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nA simple yet stunning work of ancient craftsmanship, the Wu Xing[[footnote]]“Moving Star” in the traditional Chinese language.[[/footnote]] Iris is a large jade-stone ring inscribed with middle-pinyin characters. The artifact reads “Our Radiant Father in the Heavens” on one side and “He showers us with blessings” on the other. The ring is connected to a peach-wood handle with a long, thin, handmade rope consisting of yak hair.\n\nThis elegant trinket deserves to be on display in a museum, not clasped between the palms of a cultist in prayer.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++++ HISTORY\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nAccording to a trusted historian’s analysis, the object has been in the custody of sun-worshipping monks[[footnote]]Modern adherents of this belief refer to themselves as the //Huǒjù zhi Zi// or “The Children of the Torch”.[[/footnote]] since the early-to-mid Tang dynasty in the 8th century.[((bibcite Tang))] Adherents of the faith claim that the sun is a sentient being -- known as “The Radiant Father” -- who bestowed upon them abilities befitting that of a ball of gas and flame.\n\nThe first known recorded instance of Wu Xing Iris use can be traced back to the late 1250s when a travelling monk used its “holy properties” to kindle a flame, which he later used to defend a village against the invading Mongol hordes.[((bibcite Tales))] Reported appearances of the Iris are sparse; throughout the region’s history, the Iris is often credited with performing outstanding feats in times of need.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++++ THE MYTH\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following excerpt was taken from a 19th-century text believed to contain a first-hand account from the monk responsible for the Iris’ creation.[((bibcite Creation))]\n\n[[div class=\"excerpt\"]]\nThe Radiant Father cast a light so bright,\nIlluminating a branch of the heavenly peach tree.\nHe commanded I take it;\nI obeyed my father without question.\nHe commanded I eat its fruit;\nI obeyed my father without question.\nHe commanded I not eat for eight dawns;\nI obeyed my father without question.\nHe commanded I sit beneath the heavenly peach tree\nAnd listen to his wisdom;\nI obeyed my father without question.\nOn the eight dawn, from the branch of the heavenly peach\nGrew a ring of perfect jade:\nAn example of my Radiant Father’s wisdom.\nHe commanded I teach his word;\nI obeyed my father without question.\nThus I have spoken.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++++ THE DEBUNKING\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nAs is the case with all ancient religious documents,[[footnote]]Discounting, of course, those which are flat-out lies.[[/footnote]] I firmly believe this passage to be a wildly exaggerated recounting of events witnessed by a madman.\n\nThe Wu Xing Iris’ original wielder was a monk whose name has been lost to time. Over a thousand years ago, being a monk in a remote Chinese mountain province meant sacrificing many of the already scarce luxuries one in their position would have. This leads me to reason that the monk was starving, exhausted, and prone to hallucination by the time he met with his “god”.\n\n[[div class=\"excerpt\"]]\nThe Radiant Father cast a light so bright,\nIlluminating a branch of the heavenly peach tree.\n[[/div]]\n\nPeaches are a symbol of purity, longevity, and holiness in China, and have been for longer than this myth has existed.[((bibcite Peaches))] I would argue that this monk was taking advantage of the symbolism behind peaches to add credence to his false ideology. As for what he encountered? I do not know for certain, but I do believe it may have been a form of powerful hallucinogenic vegetation. It is entirely possible that the monk’s hallucinations began after consuming a rotten fruit, and that he suffered from delirium as his body attempted to detoxify it.\n\n[[div class=\"excerpt\"]]\nHe commanded I eat its fruit;\n[[/div]]\n\nPharmacological studies indicate that hallucinogens affect one’s perception of time and induce stimulus-related hallucination -- //obviously//. One cannot survive properly for 8 days without nutrition or water, and the possibility of a jade ring sprouting from a tree branch is laughable. It is my belief that the monk took a jade accessory he had on his person and fastened it to a nearby stick while under the ill effects of the consumed hallucinogen.\n\nUpon careful examination and testing, no flame-emitting devices have been found within the item: it is simply an ornate fetish. Because of the Iris’ ringed shape, it is theorized that its now-empty socket once held a glass lens. The lens was presumably used under the sun as an ancient magnifying glass to create focused beams of heat, which would eventually erupt into flames given the right conditions.\n\nBased on thorough analysis, it is this ZIRCON’s pleasure to declare the Wu Xing Iris debunked as nothing more than a glorified magnifying glass made by a delusional, if talented, vagrant. The ring is currently held in the hands of our RUBIES in Western China, who are using it to show the truth to the good people of the land -- if they so wish to release indoctrinated hands from their ears and listen.\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[bibliography]]\n: Tang : Roger Stanpike (1996).
