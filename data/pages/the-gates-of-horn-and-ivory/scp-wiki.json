Their first class together was an optional subject, 'The Ontology of Dreams', which Ceballos only enrolled to fulfill his class quotas. Yet his first memory of Aureo was of that annoyingly brilliant boy, genuinely curious about dream ontology.\n\nIt was rumored that Prof. Danielopoulos taught at Alexylva University before coming to Eurtec. Whether or not the rumor was true, his classes were very popular, maybe in part because of his powerful lecturer voice:\n\n\"//Stranger, dreams verily are baffling and unclear of meaning, and in no wise do they find fulfillment in all things for men. For two are the gates of shadowy dreams, and one is fashioned of horn and one of ivory. Those dreams that pass through the gate of sawn ivory deceive men, bringing words that find no fulfillment. But those that come forth through the gate of polished horn bring true issues to pass, when any mortal sees them. But in my case, it was not from thence, methinks, that my strange dream came...//\"\n\nDanielopoulos remained in silence for a few moments, as to give the class time to assimilate the passage he had just read. \"Can anyone of you tell me which is this from?\"\n\n\"The Illiad, professor?\" asked a female voice.\n\n\"Close but not quite, Claudia.\"\n\n\"It's from the Oddysey, professor.\"\n\n\"As sharp as always, Alberto.\"\n\nAlberto looked like he was always daydreaming, yet he always managed to get the right answer. Ceballos envied him, he wished he was as brilliant and carefree as Alberto. Yet what he envied the most was the way Claudia looked at him. Despite this, the three became close friends during their university years. Ceballos became an accomplished scientist, but he never managed to surpass the geniality of his best friend. Always the second best.\n\nAlberto wasn't interested in Claudia, nor in any woman for that matter. Claudias' heart was eventually broken, and Ceballos was there to be a shoulder to cry on. Even though they married, Gael could never shake away the feeling that he was but a consolation prize.

The drone is equipped with 8 segmented limbs ending in gripping claws, used for both mobility and combat. The exterior of the drone is reinforced with titanium alloy, granting remarkable durability in combat scenarios.\n\n++++ Control system:\nThe Oneiros is a Greek concept referring to the personification of a dream. While dreaming, any person has the potential to manifest an Oneiros. Usually, oneiric manifestations are restricted to an alternative plane commonly known as the \"Dreamscape\". However, interactions between the Oneiros in the dreamscape and the physical world are theoretically possible, given sufficient ontological stabilization.\n\nThe proposed control system should allow the user to pilot the Gorgon drone through their Oneiros. Oneiric Remote Control offers many advantages over traditional channels, for example, it would be more resistant to interfering and hijacking and range should be a non-issue. However, the drone can only be reliably controlled under a state of lucid dreaming during REM sleep. To successfully achieve this state, Compound-M0RPh, synthesized from //Calea zacatechichi//[[footnote]] //Hoja madre// o //pasto amargo// has been traditionally used in México and Central America to potentiate lucid dreams and perform dream divination.[[/footnote]], should be administered to pilots.\n\n++++ Disadvantages:\nNo suitable Ontoligcal Stabilizator had been found.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/la-llorona.model| Ceballos was no stranger to ontological stabilization]]].

Their faces had already mutated into parodic facsimiles of the human visage. They began to make out, their unnaturally long tongues twirling into each other.\n\n\"Enough of nightmares!\" shouted Ceballos as he violently turned the page of his dream. He tore into the fabric of his Subconscious to escape into the unconstrained possibilities of the Dreamscape. He found himself floating in an endless stream of consciousness.

Causality feedback loops have been observed to occur between them. In plain words, reality influences dreams, and dreams influence reality. However, the exact mechanism that allows for this interdependence has been the object of unfruitful speculation for ages.\n\nThe Greeks called it \"The Gates of Horn and Ivory\", a metaphorical construct that represents this nexus between planes. The dreams that become reality come through the \"Gate of Horn\". The \"Gate of Ivory\" is for the \"deceiving\" dreams. In other words, fantasy. The gates are an ontological crossroad, the point of divergence between the two planes.\n\nRecent advances in para-neuropsychology have confirmed the long-suspected theory that a biological correlate of the metaphysical \"Gates\" exist in the hippocampus. Humans have two hippocampi, one in each hemisphere of the brain. The left one corresponds to the \"Gate of Horn\". The right one is the \"Gate of Ivory\".\n\nBesides its non-anomalous neural functions, the hippocampus serves as a natural ontological stabilizer, allowing access and communication between the material world and the Dreamscape (the famous Oneirios phenomena).\n\nFor the application of drone control, it has been proved that a high dose of Compound-M0RPh (//Calea zacatechichi.//) amplifies the hippocampus's metaphysical activity during REM sleep. Thus, synchronization between a dreamer's hippocampus and an artificial hippocampus module in the drone's chassis becomes possible.

They came to investigate, discovering the killer robot and their unfortunate comrade. Gunfire rained down over the drone. From Santiago's point of view, new friends had come to play. They shot at him with water guns while he ran for cover. He jumped to a height only possible in dreams and fell over one of them. They wrestled lightly until the other child said \"You got me!\". On the other screen, the drone crushed another unfortunate merc.\n\nIn the dream, Santiago wielded a wooden sword and played \"pirate wars\" with his childhood friends. In reality, the drone brutally but efficiently dispatched all of the enemy squad. Children's laughter came from one monitor, men's screams from the other. Alfredo looked at the spectacle in awe and horror. \"What have I done?\"\n\nEventually, the game changed. There were no longer more pirates to fight. Instead, it was hide-and-seek in a whimsical forest. Most of the Volk troops had already been massacred. The survivors hid in the corners of the warehouse. The joyful Santiago looked for his friends. Whenever he found one, he said \"I found you!\" and hugged as the drone tore a panicked Volk apart in the other screen.\n\n\"Respectable audience, we have almost finished this demonstration.

But I will turn off the Drone Screen for the benefit of the sensible members of the audience.\"\n\nSantiago approached the hiding girl and gently touched her with the tip of the sword. \"You got me\", the girl laughed.\n\n@@ @@\n------\n------\n@@ @@\n\n\"What the hell is wrong with you!?\" screamed Alberto furiously. \"What was that?\"\n\n\"That was the best demo done in years. Why are you acting like this? They loved it. It was a total success.\"\n\n\"That was psychotic! Those people... that woman... I don't know you anymore... How could you?\"\n\nCeballos expression went somber. He looked directly into his friend's eyes. \"Alberto, do you work at Raptor Tech?\"\n\n\"What? Why are you ask...\"\n\n\"Answer the question, Alberto.\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"And Raptor Tech is one the biggest manufacturers of anomalous weapons in the world. Weapons that get into the hands of trash like those Volk fascists we just killed. Do you really not know what they do with these weapons?\"\n\n\"I...\"\n\n\"You were so comfortable in your lab, doing the theoretical work. You were so busy being the smug genius prodigy that you never stopped to ask what they were doing with your research, right?\"\n\n\"I don't want anything to do with this.\"\n\n\"But you do. This is not your lab of dreams, this is the real world. This is what we do. R.T.I. and Valravn. You and me. I'm sorry to burst your bubble like this, but this is the deal you signed for.\"\n\n\"I... I can't continue. I'm leaving, Gael...\"\n\n\"What? You can't leave! We still have work to do!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, Gael\". Alberto walked away.\n\nGael stood silent for a moment. Then he exploded. \"You were always a self-righteous arrogant prick! Can you hear me? Did you ever care to hear me? I don't need you!\"\n\n@@ @@\n------\n------\n@@ @@\n\nCeballos had taken booze, benzos, weed, //pasto amargo//, anything on his hand to calm his anxious brain. He was so close to greatness, so close to beating Brandt. Yet everything was just about to be ruined by that self-righteous idiot. He plunged into the Dreamscape and found himself swimming frantically against the treasonous currents of the Seas of Id. But this time, the island of violet sands was looking closer and closer.\n\n\"He is reaching the Gates,\" said a mantis with a horse head.\n\n\"You always have to be careful with what you dream of,\" replied a rainbow-colored axolotl.\n\n\"Wasn't the phrase about what you 'wish for'?\", inquired a lion head with the body of an ant.\n\n\"Same results. You can ask [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6755 | The Lady]]] if you don't believe me,\" replied the axolotl.\n\n\"Shut up! You ridiculous pastiches! I always hated the stupid //alebrijes//!\" Yelled Ceballos as he remembered the chimeric //papier-mâché// sculptures that were paraded in his hometown during Día de Muertos, always giving nightmares to his childhood self.\n\nFinally, he found himself stranded in the violet sands of the island. He dragged himself into firm land. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in front of two towering structures. He wasn't expecting the Gates to be that tall, to feel so small and insignificant against them.\n\nHe stood in front of the Gate of Ivory. Alberto was on the other side, smiling at him.  Since their time in university, and even though he never dare to admit it, that smile was the only one that truly managed to warm Gael's heart. And that he could never really forgive.\n\n\"Fuck you, Alberto. I don't need you. I never did.\" He muttered while he walked into the Gate of Horn.\n\nA synthetic voice replied: \"Oneiric connection established. Initializing Gorgon Drone.\"\n\n@@ @@\n------\n------\n@@ @@\n\n\"Last night. The Gorgon Drone spontaneously activated. It tore down the armory's door and cause some minor damage to local infrastructure. Nothing relevant to be fair. Unfortunately, it found its way into Dr. Aureo's accommodations,\" Olga Brandt's tone was weirdly affable, and that unsettled Gael Ceballos much more than if she was being confrontational.\n\n\"Very unfortunate incident. However, it won't damage our working relationship with R.T.I. I have already spoken with Prof. Veloe. What a charming and understanding man. We will, of course, cover all the medical costs of rehabilitation and paraprosthetics. That's your specialty, after all.\"\n\n\"Medical costs? Is he... alive?\"\n\n\"Barely. He will get better with proper care. But it cost him an arm and a leg. Literally. Such a shame.\"\n\nCeballos was still hungover from his late-night binge. He could barely remember his dream. Did he really... did he really do that to Alberto? It could not be, he could never... Alfredo was his... friend. \"No, that was irrelevant,\" he told himself. He fucked up hard, this incident could have started a war with R.T.I. And if they knew, the High Table would have his head for breakfast. Now he was at the mercy of Brandt, his sworn enemy. The game was over.\n\n\"It is a shame to watch such a valuable employee waste their life like that?\" Olga smiled like a poker player just revealing their winning hand. \"Especially after he was just about to return to the field.\"\n\n\"Me... Who... Who are you talking about?\"\n\n\"Santiago, of course. It seems he could not handle Compound-M0RPh, hence this unexpected activation. Sadly, I had to mark him for termination.\"\n\n\"But he... I...\"\n\n\"It has already been done, Gael.\"\n\nCeballos freeze. There was no way Olga Brandt didn't know what had really happened. What game was \"The Mother of Valkyries\" playing? Whatever the case, there was no point in pretending.\n\n\"Why are you covering me?\"\n\n\"Well, Gael. I think you are a brilliant scientist and enjoy working with you.\" Brandt replied with motherly voice.\n\nCeballos' brain was at a breaking point. Blue Screen of Death.\n\n\"Also, you are a sad pathetic excuse of a man. You have mundane and vulgar ambitions that would normally repulse me, but since you are also such weak-willed there is no way you will achieve anything on your own. You represent literally zero threat to me. For that reason alone, it is convenient that you stay around. Else you would get replaced by someone who could actually threaten me.\" Olga Brandt's delivery was matter-of-factly yet still somewhat polite. Her voice betrayed neither disgust nor contempt. For her, Ceballos was not worthy of even that. \"Have a nice day, researcher.\"\n\nGael Ceballos wandered off Brandt's office. As he stumbled back to his quarters, he could no help but embrace the weak hope that maybe, just maybe... he was still dreaming... that maybe there was still a chance to make it through the Gate of Ivory.",
