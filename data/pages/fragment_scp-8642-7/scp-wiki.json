  "content": "You ask what the “Everyday Anomalies” in the department name means, and Hannah’s eyes light up like Christmas lights. “OH! That’s our SPECIALITY!” she says with an excitement that almost frightens you. “I’m sure you know about the numbered anomalies; everyone does! They’re the ones we can test on, and contain, and all that jazz. But do you ever stop to think about anomalies that don’t stick around long enough for us to do anything about? Of course not! They don’t need containing because they don’t exist long enough to contain! And those are popping up all the time all over the place! That’s why we call them Everyday Anomalies!”\n\n“We changed the name to ‘Self-Neutralizing Anomalies’ last month,” calls one of the trio in the back of the room. “But we didn’t change the name of the department,” interjects the second. The third flings another folder up in the air, causing papers to flutter everywhere, and exclaims, “That’s because D.S.N.A.D.E.N.D. isn’t as catchy as D.E.A.D.E.N.D., we’ve been OVER this!”\n\nHannah doesn’t seem phased by the interjections from the peanut gallery, and continues rambling about spacial rifts that open for fractions of a second, temporal anomalies that span even less time than that, and one strange story of a map turtle with an exact topographical map of Kansas on its shell and no other anomalous properties, which lived slightly longer than an average map turtle due to being easier to take care of than a goldfish that’s immortal as long as you remember to feed it every day.[[footnote]]The trio in the back promptly blame each other for the goldfish, accompanied by a flock of origami swans being thrown.[[/footnote]] This time you cannot get a word in, and are subject to a crash course in the most unimaginative collection of anomalies ever imagined.\n\nJust as Hannah is getting deep into the lore of the Carrot Sword, a sword that is completely normal except that it cannot cut through carrots, you both hear Greg clear his throat. “Here,” he says, handing you your clipboard. You thank him a little too enthusiastically and then look through the data he’s written in. It all looks fairly normal: A large amount spent on paper and ink (no surprise there), a moderate amount spent on instant coffee (more than they should, just like every other department in the Foundation), a request for funds going toward better computers and scanners (we’ll see), and…\n\nUpkeep costs for 8 Scranton Reality Anchors? So far you haven’t seen or been told about anything in this department that would require a single Reality Anchor, let alone 8. The thought that someone might be embezzling those funds crosses your mind, which would be completely unacceptable for any Foundation department! For that matter, you were just being told about anomalies that only last for a moment, none of which need a Reality Anchor to deal with! Then again, this seems to be a strange department, and you can always just note that oddity in your auditing report. They may get investigated by the Auditing Department for it anyways. You could just leave and be done with it, or you could ask and risk another rambling explanation. You decide to…\n\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/14 Leave without asking about the Reality Anchors.]||= 7||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/15 Ask about the Reality Anchors.]||\n\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _",
