The remaining containment procedures necessary are the monitoring of SCP-935 to confirm the incapacitation of its anomalous abilities and the neutralization of SCP-935-α.\n\n**Description:** SCP-935 is a box of game cards that belonged to Don Vittorio Maria of Contarini, who is now classified as SCP-935-α. SCP-935 possessed an occult working binding related to the Bowe family, an important American military family that has historically worked with the anomalous affairs of the United States government throughout its lifetime.\n\nSCP-935 has the capability of teleportation, invisibility, and the transaction of the soul's subjects it plays with to a demonic contract.[[footnote]] With the exception of invinsibility, these capabilities only appear when the object is active during a game with SCP-935-1. [[/footnote]] Until its neutralization, SCP-935 had contained SCP-935-α for 208 years. During this time, SCP-935 cursed the Bowe family and its members, by disappearing a family member by the time they turned fourty-one years old, and turning them into an SCP-935-1 instance.\n\nPrior to the neutralization of SCP-935 and SCP-935-α on 17/06/2001, the behavior of the anomaly and its functionality remained constant. For more information of the recent discoveries of SCP-935 and its neutralization, proceed to the following addendums.\n\n**Addendum 935.1:** Profile of SCP-935-α\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:carousel\n| images=DonContarini.jpg,MajorBartholomewBowe.jpg\n| caption=Potraits of SCP-935-α (1783) and Major Bartholomew Bowe (1785).\n| interval=5\n| wiki=scp-sandbox-3\n| page=fragment:collab:scp-935-2\n| width=275px\n| height=275px\n| position=right\n| options=yes\n]]\n\nSCP-935-α was discovered to have been Don Vittorio Maria of Contarini after the suicide of General Stan Bowe. Before his capture by Site-19 security, Bowe informed his guards of the true name of SCP-935-α, afterwards killing himself. After the dissolution of the Bowe Commission, the SCP-935 Research Team focused on continuing the work it left behind.\n\nThe research team discovered that most of the information about SCP-935-α which belonged to the personal archives of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contarini Contarini family] was acquired by Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. The historical documents were eventually acquisitioned by the research team, who discovered the past of SCP-935-α.\n\nSCP-935-α belonged to one of the founding families of the Venetian Republic in 1758. While raised a Catholic, SCP-935-α belonged to outlawed freemason and occult societies that were formed by Venetian noblemen, and used these connections to climb the ranks of nobility. At the age of 25, he was appointed as the leader of the welcoming party to the new American ambassador to Venice: Major Bartholomew Bowe.\n\nSCP-935-α and Major Bartholomew Bowe worked together in the diplomatic relations of both nations, but also in leisure because of their shared interest in the occult, secret societies and card games. The relationship between SCP-935-α and Bartholomew Bowe broke after a card game session, where SCP-935-α  accused Bartholomew Bowe of cheating in the session while surrounded of his fellow noblemen. Eventually, SCP-935-α was kicked out from future sessions.\n\nSCP-935-α's ostracization caused the resurface of rumors that he belonged to occult and secret societies unrelated to the Catholic Church, which was taken advantage by his political opponents, and a case was opened against him by the Inquisition, to which he was found guilty. Because of his nobility, he was only punished with house arrest and his ability to rise in Venetian political life was stifled.\n\nSCP-935-α died in 12/06/1797. All of his personal belongings were acquired by the members of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goi-index#toc10 Most Serene College of Anomalies and Oddities of the Municipality] and later sold to MC&D Ltd, which included his journals written during his house arrest. His last journal entry was written in 11/06/1797 with the following:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Journal Entry of SCP-935-α\" hide=\"- Close Journal Entry of SCP-935-α\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nJune 12^^th^^, 1797\n\nIt has been a month after Venice fell, and I can still see through my window the French troops walking through our once free streets. I should feel ashamed for this occupation, but I'm glad it's happening: the Doge, the Council, my family, they can all bow down and kiss the boots of the French. They have no pride, no  duty, no honor--and while I'm still rotting in my home cell, they will continue to lead this occupied Venice. I'd rather die than to see what our family and nation has become.\n\nAnd while Europe is going downhill, I continue to hear the stories of the United States, that nation across the sea. Everytime I hear of it, I can't stop remembering that wretched man, Bartholomew Bowe. While my family is trying to pick up the scraps, he's now thriving in his new nation--again, disnohorable men are congratulated while men of honor are backstabbed. It's ironic, this ancient nobility is dying out in this chaotic wave, while Bowe is essentially becoming the new nobility in his own kingdom in the Americas. It'd be humorous if I wasn't personally involved.\n\nBut soon, their judgement will come: to my family, to the Frenchmen, and to Bowe and his own family--and I'll make sure of that. Thanks to a close friend, I was able to contact a demonologist to assist in a deal: in exchange for the souls of Bartholomew's descendants, I'll hunt his family for eternity. Tonight the ritual will be completed. My friend will make sure that the cards arrive to his household.\n\nLex talionis,[[footnote]] Translated from Latin to \"law of exact retaliation\" where an individual who has injured another individual is to be penalized to a similar degree by the injured party.

Bowe was aware of the case because of a letter left by his father, Arthur George Bowe, alongside General Stan Bowe's letter to the former. Bowe informed that his father left him the responsibility to finish the work of Stan and Arthur in the case of the latter's death and so contacted the SCP-935 Reseach Team to discuss the decommissioning of the anomaly.\n\nBefore 06/17/2001, Bowe was assisted by the SCP-935 Research Team to study the anomaly and all its documentation at that moment. On a meeting between Site-19's Chief of Decommissioning Department, Dr. Daniel ███████, the SCP-935 Research Team and Frederick Bowe to discuss the decommission of SCP-935, Frederick Bowe shared his personal decommissioning proposal which is attached below:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open SCP-935 Decommissioning Proposal\" hide=\"- Close SCP-935 Decommissioning Proposal\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __**SCP Object Decommissioning Proposal Form**__\n[[/=]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-935\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Head Researcher:** Dr. Mac Gillen\n\n**Supporting Personnel:**\n* Dr. Daniel ███████, Chief of Decommissioning Department\n* Dr. Philip Grant, Chief of Inter-Anomaly Experimentation Department\n* Mr. Frederick Bowe, Pentagram Ambassador\n\n**Please check off or fill in the applicable boxes regarding the reasons for submitting your proposal:**\n☐ Excessively High Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario\n☑ Excessive Danger\n☐ Ability to Decom. Apollyon-Class Object\n☑ Expense\n☑ Ethical Concerns Over Necessary Containment\n☐ Legal Concerns\n☐ High Risk of K-Class Scenario (if so, please state which type(s):@@____@@)\n☑ Other (please state): Personal connection to the victims of SCP-935. -- //Mr. Frederick Bowe//\n\n**Summary:** SCP-935 has demonstrated that it does not conform to the common methods of decommissioning, and for all its time under containment, has caused an immense damage in infrastructure, resources and the emotional state to its victims. However, it has also been demonstrated that to defeat the anomaly by not following its rules has not been effective. Therefore, it is necessary that the next SCP-935-1 subject to follow a different approach.\n\n**Decommission Method:** SCP-935-1 subjects have followed three patterns: destroy the anomaly before playing with the game, cheat during the course of the game, or being unable to play with SCP-935 for a variety of reasons. This have all everything that SCP-935 asks not to: to not cheat on the game. So, when I become the next SCP-935-1, I will follow the rules. This will require that the Bowe Protocol is not put in action when I am teleported by SCP-935. This time, we will leave the SCP-935-1 subject completely isolated.\n\n**Justification:** I am close to the victims, and I understand why the research team does not trust me because of what my uncle did. However, what the SCP-935 Research Team has done, despite their efforts, has not worked. They moved away from what General Stan Bowe did, they have not made any progress to stop the anomaly. Both because they do not care, and they believe my uncle was wrong. He was wrong, but being passive will not stop containment breaches, cover stories and budget deficits. Most importantly, it will not end my family's suffering. You may believe my relationship to my family is the problem. I believe it is the solution. More than anyone else, I have realized our mistakes. I ask for a chance, to give my family a chance. I am the closest to their legacy, and the fittest to end this curse. I hope for your support. -- //Mr. Frederick Bowe//\n\n**Status:**\n\n[[span style=\"border:solid 2px green; font-family: Stencil; font-size: 120%; color: green; padding: 3pt 3pt;\"]]APPROVED[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 935.3:** Neutralization of SCP-935\n\nSCP-935 breached containment on 17/06/2001 and teleported away alongside Frederick Bowe. As ordered in the decommissioning proposal, the Bowe Protocol was inactive throughout the entirety of SCP-935-1's disappearance. For a period of three hours and thirty-four minutes, SCP-935-1's location was unknown. Afterwards, he was found exiting a warehouse under remodelation in Aboveground Area of Site-19 with SCP-935. The site's security reported him to the research team, and he was sent to quarantine. His captors found him in a state of emotional vulnerability, as he held the top card of the anomaly, which reads the following:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nTo Fred,\n\nThank you for freeing us, we hope our family learns from our mistakes.\n\nNow we can all rest.\n\nWith love,\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Mrs Saint Delafield', cursive; font-size: 2em;\"]]@@Your family@@[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter this event, the anomaly is currently pending status change to Decommissioned and its containment procedures have been updated.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access SCiPNET Email?

Congratulations for another lively year, as well as your accomplishments of this year: the approval of the Bowe Commission, the Pandora's Box Initiative, and soon, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#omega-7 Omega-7]. You should be proud of what you've accomplished so far -- you have so much to look forward to.\n\nBecause of your day, here's my present for you: it may be a file, but you'll understand why I gave it to you. After all, you deserve to know the truth since you're the first unaffected by it.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-935 SCP-935-ARC.pdf]\n\nHappy birthday, General Bowe.\n\n-- [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-076-2 Dr. Philip Grant]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Philip Grant (Assistant Director, Bowe Commission)\n**From:** General Willis Bowe (Director, Bowe Commission)\n**Date:** 12/01/2002\n**Subject:** Re: SCP-935\n[[/div]]\n------\nGrant,\n\nThank you, doctor. To be honest, I wasn't expecting this, but I'm definitely glad to know now. In fact, you might even say this helped. Grant, this made me realize fully why I'm here: it's not only to protect our nations' interests. No, I'm doing what my father would've wanted me to do: to fill the shoes left by my ancestors, to carry on their legacy. Now this commission's name makes sense: it's because of my father, and the duty he carried despite knowing he wouldn't win.\n\nBut that has changed, doctor. We've won, I've won, and we'll continue to win. My family built the way so I could stand where I am, and I'll perform my duty to the fullest. I stand on the shoulders of giants, and it's natural that I become a giant as well.\n\nAs for the anomaly, I'll pick up the box when I'm on my way home. Tell Dan to make the paperwork and change the anomaly's containment -- I have a nice way to get rid of SCP-935. Tell him that it is not worth containing, and much less being remembered.\n\nThank you, doctor, this was a good birthday present.\n\n-- General Willis Bowe\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-934]]] | SCP-935 | [[[SCP-936]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** DonContarini.jpg\n> **Name:** Ritratto di Vittorio Amedeo di Savoia, principe di Carignano\n> **Author:** Ambito Piemontese\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%D0%92%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80_%D0%90%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B9_II_%D0%A1%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B9%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%8C%D1%8F%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9.jpg\n=====\n> **Filename:** FredBowe1999.jpg\n> **Name:** William Cohen, official portrait\n> **Author:** Scott Davis\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:William_Cohen,_official_portrait.jpg\n=====\n> **Filename:** MajorBartholomewBowe.jpg\n> **Name:** Peter Muhlenberg\n> **Author:** Unknown\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Peter_Muhlenberg2.jpg\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
