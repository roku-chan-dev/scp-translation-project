As such, there is currently no need to censor SCP-6803-A instances. Similarly, SCP-6803-B require no containment beyond amnestization of civilian observers in the unlikely event of observation.\n\nHowever, all staff that qualify into one or both of the following criteria are to receive inoculant OH-16 every four months. Criteria is as follows:\n\n* Individuals who have received memetic inoculation level 6 or higher. \n* Individuals who have received cognitohazardous inoculation level 4 or higher.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[span style=\"color:Tomato;\"]]\n+ WARNING: BIOMETRIC SCAN REQUIRED\n[[/span]]\n----\n[[div style=\"color:#404040;\"]]\n+++++ >Scanning reader for memetic inoculation level 6 or higher\n++++++ >Status: Negative\n+++++ >Scanning reader for cognitohazardous inoculation level 4 or higher\n++++++ >Status: Postive\n++++++ >Proceed to OH-16 inoculation scan\n+++++ >Scanning reader for OH-16 inoculation\n++++++ >Status: Positive\n+++++ >Calculating last administration\n++++++ >123 days ago\n[[/div]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-6803 is a cognitohazard present in instances of media which visually depict planet Earth as it is seen from orbit. Such instances are henceforth designated SCP-6803-A.\n\n\nSCP-6803 manifests specifically on images and videos which have been recorded 10.7 km above the surface of planet Earth in which said surface is visible. Notably, 10.7 km is the minimum height at which the curvature of the Earth is first noticeable; given the observer has a field of view of more than 60° degrees available and visual meteorological conditions are optimal.\n\nThere is no defined maximum distance from Earth at which manifestation of SCP-6803 in recordings ceases. Instead, the strength of the cognitohazard diminishes as the topological features of the planet become less recognizable. The effect similarly diminishes in SCP-6803-A instances which are blurry or if the surface is partially obscured. The effect remains if the images are edited as long as the planet remains iconographically recognizable.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:40%;\"]]\n[[image Apolo_11.png style=\"width:40%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nAn instance of SCP-6803-A taken during the Apollo 11 mission.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nUnder usual circumstances SCP-6803 has no noticeable external effects on humans exposed to it. However, neurological scanning reveals activity consistent with exposure to a level 1 cognitohazard as well as anomalous memetic transmission.\n\nThe effects caused by exposure to SCP-6803-A instances become less predictable on humans who have received extensive memetic or cognitohazardous inoculation. Therefore, the risk class for these specific individuals upgrades from Notice to Critical. Upon exposure to an SCP-6803-A instance, subjects may become affected by a Columbus-class event. During said event, subjects are translocated to an orbit anywhere between 10,000 to 100,000 km from the surface of planet Earth. They are henceforth designated an SCP-6803-B instance. Clothes and jewelry remain in place after demanifestation however internal implants do not, these may later be located close to the instance but are not a part of it.\n\nSCP-6803-B instances continue to orbit Earth indefinitely. Additionally, they are noted to be wearing a spacesuit of undetermined origin and all are deceased due to extensive cranial trauma, the suit however remains undamaged. SCP-6803-B are intangible and as such are undetectable by radar; long range psionic scanning is the only known way to locate them. There are currently 65 known SCP-6803-B instances, with the latest instance being the most notorious. See addendum 6803.1 for details.\n\nAll communication with subjects will be lost at the moment of demanifestation. However, upon close observation, the corresponding SCP-6803-B instance will telepathically transmit a single unique phrase repeatedly into the mind of the observer for as long as visual contact is maintained. Examples include:\n\n> SCP-6803-B 004: What is wrong with the surface?\n\n> SCP-6803-B 042: It’s all so fucked.\n\n> SCP-6803-B 063: Huh. I like it more this way.\n\nAs no clear pattern for the manifestation of Columbus events has been discovered, extensive use of inoculant OH-16 has been approved by 05 order. Research into the exact triggers of such events is still ongoing, as is research into the memetic aspect of SCP-6803.\n\n------\n\n[[div_ class=\"center-collapse\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Inoculant OH-16\" hide=\"Inoculant OH-16  -  Close\"]]\nInoculant OH-16 is administered via injection and its effects become noticeable 12 to 18 hours after administration. It has a lifespan within the body of four months after which it must be readministered. OH-16 has the effect of rendering the subject incapable of perceiving any images which depict planet Earth, instead causing said subjects to perceive white featureless squares over the offending vector. As such, use of OH-16 renders the subjects immune to the effects of SCP-6803-A instances. \n\nThe inoculant does have the unfortunate side effect of also  triggering while observing most iconographic depictions of Earth. These include artificial depictions which cannot host SCP-6803. \n\nDue to its highly obstructive nature, research into methods to manage the triggers of inoculant OH-16 was deemed an alpha level priority. As a result, SIT (Semantic & Iconographic Training) has allowed individuals to observe most images and objects which fall under the semantic category 'maps' without triggering OH-16. This effect has not been able to be replicated for other semantic categories. 'Maps' which depict Earth in its entirety remain an exception as they are also complete iconographic depictions of Earth.\n\nThe following are images to further exemplify which ones may trigger activation of inoculant OH-16. None of these images are capable of hosting SCP-6803.\n\n[[div class=\"widebox\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Globe.png|\n    caption= Picture of a globe.

No crew witnessed the event, however they became distressed upon realizing the absence of Agent Alden. Alden had been displaying symptoms of paranoia and therefore the crew of the ISS feared he may have ejected himself from the station, a fear worsened by the fact that no space suits were missing. \n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:35%;\"]]\n[[image ISS.png style=\"width:35%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nThe ISS, as recorded during approach of Expedition 60.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nNASA collaborated with the Foundation to cover the event. A Foundation owned vessel departed the ORP-5 (Orbital Research Platform five), executed orbital rendezvous maneuvers and docked with the ISS. Foundation agents boarded the station and rounded up the crew, which at that time had begun accusing each other for the disappearance of Alden. The crew was amnesticized and Alden was replaced by a new Foundation agent. The memories of the crew were accordingly modified, and all records of the mission were expunged and replaced. A matching SCP-6803-B instance was later located orbiting Earth 57,000km from its surface.\n\nAgent Alden was not under the effects of any inoculants known to allow triggering of Colombus events, therefore he had not been administered OH-16. However, he had an experimental intracranial CRD (Cognitive Recording Device) implanted which he used to log his time on the station. It is currently theorized the CRD may have caused neurocognitive interference that led to the Columbus event, however the exact trigger remains unconfirmed. Testing with D-class sporting CRDs exposed to SCP-6803-A instances has not yielded similar results. \n\nThe CRD of Agent Alden was located close to his body, the data within was able to be recovered. Logs follow:\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"danke log1\"]]\n**__Log 01,__** Agent Alde-    Fuck, its hard to get used to this. Agent Alden here, expedition 60, reporting from the ISS. We -that is Kuznetsov, Thompson and me- left the //Baikonur Cosmodrome// approximately nine hours ago. Our //Soyuz// docked with the station seven hours later. \n\nWe met with the three on board -King, Vinograd and Nishimura- and all has gone as expected so far. I suppose half of the crew must always be American right? I mean usually… Anyways.\n\nI’m following the steps of Agent Campbell and many others before me. My instructions are to log any anomalous events and properly amnesticize the rest of the crew if necessary.\n \nHow am I supposed to do that covertly? I have no idea. It was hard enough to find a secluded spot to record this without looking like an idiot staring blankly at the wa-\n\nAnyways… again…\n\nAs long as that doesn't happen I'm only required to make weekly status updates.

I struggle enough with speaking clinically without focusing, but thinking? This is a whole 'nother dimension. \n\nI suppose I was chosen for this because of my tendency for inner dialogue rather than talking, my inner child as I like to call it. Therefore, I hope I will be given some leniency on this front. \n\nI listened to my previous log and it's not optimal. That little accident from yesterday even less so.\n\nI will try harder to focus and stay clinical, especially if a situation were to arise. Unlikely, given there has been no incidents since the spatial shift of 2005. And with the ORP program going so well this current position of mine is becoming irrelevant, fast. Hence why the Foundation had no issue with those seven days between Campbell departing and my arrival. \n\nAnyways, conditions remain as expected.
