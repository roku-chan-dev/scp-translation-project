Originally founded by the Servants of Silicon Nornir, following their addition to the Council of 108 in 1984, administration of Eurtec was promptly transferred to the Coalition.\n\nEurtec is notable for its expansive criminal underground, which primarily reside in the lower city. Lower city residents are significantly more likely to possess paranormal properties and participate in blue market commerce, and many are known to be involved with anomalous substances and unregulated technologies. Coalition Enforcers are to engage known criminals on-sight but limit interaction with other paranormal individuals as outlined in the 1984 Coalition Administration Agreement.\n\nThe section of the city 600 meters above sea level or higher is officially designated the upper city. The upper city operates as the de facto capital of the Council of 108, and houses both the regional Coalition headquarters and the modern Council Assembly building.\n[[/div]]",
