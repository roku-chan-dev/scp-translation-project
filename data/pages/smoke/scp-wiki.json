happened.\n\nThey say the earth moves when mountains collide under the water\n\nbut we know the truth.\n\nThe earth moves to settle in for winter\n\nlike turning over to sleep.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍍\n\nFive days ago, a man stumbled into our town\n\nhis face was dark with ash and soot\n\nand he could not speak\n\nonly mumble.\n\nHe stared through us, as if we were not there at all.\n\nHe looked at me and I saw nothing in his eyes.\n\nHe said \"fire\",\n\nand \"death\",\n\nand \"smoke\".\n\nI offered to let him stay at our house\n\n(though mama threw such a fit about his cleanliness!)\n\nbut he was gone by the morning.\n\nThey said he walked south.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍍\n\nThree days ago, the earth trembled again\n\nand a group of miners from the hills said they saw something burning\n\nover the mountains, to the north.\n\n\"Are the forests burning?\" we asked\n\nthough it was late in the season for them to do so.\n\nThey said no.\n\nThey said that it was not burning wood\n\nbut something else.\n\nThey said that up in the hills, they could hear sounds\n\nsounds of machines and grinding metal\n\nfaint, but growing closer.\n\nAnd they said that they saw smoke\n\nthick and black and dense\n\nnot from burning trees\n\nbut something else.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍍\n\nTwo days ago a group of men came to our town from the south.\n\nThey rode in a motor vehicle and wore helmets\n\nlike soldiers.\n\nThe earth had shaken again in the night,\n\nand now we could feel tremors every few hours.\n\nMama was growing anxious. \n\nShe wanted us to go to the hills, \n\nwhere tía Elaina and the cousins live.\n\nI told her that was silly, that someone needs to watch the farm\n\nand the house.\n\nI told her I would ask the soldiers about the tremors\n\nand the smoke.\n\nWhen I spoke to them, they said very little.\n\nThey looked at me like an adult might look at a lost child\n\nand they said that many others were heading south\n\nto La Paz. \n\nI mentioned the farm, and the house\n\nand the soldier just shook his head\n\nand said that other were heading south\n\nto La Paz,\n\nand then they drove away.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍍\n\nYesterday, the sun did not rise.\n\nI sent mama and little Felicia to the hills\n\nwhere tía Elaina and the cousins live.\n\nI said I would stay and watch the farm\n\nand the house\n\nand that they could come back after the fires had burned out.\n\nThere is a haze that has settled over our town\n\nsometimes it rolls in like waves off the sea\n\nchoking the countryside.\n\nThe air is thick with it.\n\nI could not even watch mama and Felicia and the other leave town\n\nbecause the smoke was so thick. \n\nMore have come from the north\n\ntheir faces black with soot and their eyes bloodstained.\n\nThey do not speak.\n\nThey do not see.\n\nThey do not hear.\n\nThey barely breathe.\n\nThey take slow steps towards the south.\n\nThey mouth wordless curses and choke on the haze.\n\nI do not think they care about the smoke.\n\nSometimes I think they are made of it themselves.\n\nBut the fires will burn out\n\nand mama and Felicia will come down from the hills.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍍\n\nLast night I heard guns\n\nand cannons\n\nand the sound of men screaming from far away.\n\nI woke up and came outside, and the smoke was so thick\n\nit felt like I was swimming through it.\n\nI saw one of the soldiers from before\n\nonly he was covered in oil and missing an arm.\n\nHe walked into town from the north\n\nand looked to be heading to the well near the square.\n\nI asked him if he needed water\n\nbut he said nothing to me\n\njust mouthed wordless curses.\n\nBy the time I had gotten back \n\nhe was dead.\n\nHis uniform was soaked with blood\n\nand soot.\n\nThe gunfire continued throughout the night\n\nbut after a while, the only sound I could hear was \n\ngrinding iron\n\nand screaming steel.\n\nI saw through the smoke, in the distance, \n\na mountain of fire and machinery.\n\nEvery so often you could see an explosion\n\nas another shell broke on its hide\n\nbut another piece moved in to replace the broken one\n\nand the mountain moved on unimpeded.\n\nI saw something like an arm reach out\n\nand grab a vehicle full of soldiers\n\nwho could do nothing but stare and hold on to the frame\n\nas they were lifted a mile into the air\n\nand dropped into the fire.\n\nI wanted to go and help -\n\nso many now were crawling towards the sea,\n\ntowards water.\n\nBut the smoke was thick and I could not breathe,\n\nand darkness took me.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n⍔\n\nToday, I awoke to silence.\n\nOne of my neighbors, Maria, had found me in the street \n\nand pulled me into her home.\n\nThe haze is gone\n\nthey say the wind carried it south\n\nwith the mountain of fire\n\ntowards La Paz. \n\nI walk now but do not see\n\nnor do I hear\n\nnor can I speak.\n\nThe hills where tía Elaina and the cousins live\n\nare gone.\n\nThe mountain crawled over them\n\nand left nothing in its wake but fires\n\nand smoke.\n\nNobody is crawling towards the sea now.\n\nAll the corpses have stopped moving.\n\nMaria tells me that maybe mama and Felicia escaped\n\nthat they were perhaps late in arriving at tía Elaina's house.\n\nShe says perhaps they are coming home now.\n\nBut she did not see the mountain of fire.\n\nShe did not see the engines of damnation.\n\nShe did not look into the eyes of death \n\nand feel the heat off its screaming mechanisms.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nI know mama and Felicia are not coming home.\n\nI know how they spent their final moments -\n\npraying\n\nburning\n\nchoking\n\nsuffocating.\n\nThey did not escape the mountain of fire\n\nbecause nothing escaped the mountain of fire.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nAs for me?\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nI will tend to the farm\n\nand the house.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:djk]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)
