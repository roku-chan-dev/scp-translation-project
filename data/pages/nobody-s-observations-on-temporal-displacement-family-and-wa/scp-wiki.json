It's about 7:30 AM as I'm writing, thinking I might get an early breakfast at a Denny's. There isn't an IHOP nearby, shame.\n@@ @@\nIt's been a tiring night. Almost made it to Boring.

There is a cow filled with bees, made my stomach churn; they even have a runaway Herman Fuller animal here. Still looking for Jonathan.\n@@ @@\nTalked to the manager of the place, some lady named Faeowynn. Weird name, very stern. She directed me toward \"enclosure 3\", contains the Dog.

A solid being there, but it was almost as though I were looking at a grainy photo of someone.\n@@ @@\nThey were inside the enclosure with some other man, their name tag said Daniel Stanford. Likely a relative from this timeline. What I can only assume to be Jonathan was petting the Dog, the worker was oddly docile.\n@@ @@\nThe blurry figure stood up for a minute and grabbed the hand of the worker as well as touching the dog. In a sudden burst of blue lightning, Jonathan was gone and the Dog was no longer abnormal. Some of the vegetation caught on fire, triggered smoke alarms.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nI can only assume this mission was a failure. __There is still potential for me to locate Jonathan in the future__.
