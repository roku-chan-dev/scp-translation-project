I was born in 1986, I live in the UK, I'm a white trans woman, pronouns she/her.\n\nI started my authorial career on the SCP wiki back in 2013, after having read the site and lurked around various parts of it for about a year or so? I forget. Back then I wrote [[[SCP-1442]]]. It was a big success in very quick time, and something about that made me terrified to try and write another thing. Plus I just had no ideas as good as it. So after tinkering around with methods of trying to find inspiration,  writing a bunch of half finished drafts, hanging out on IRC, and even judging the 2014 GOI contest for some reason (I was judge Fanta), I eventually fell away from the site.\n\nFast forward to four years later, 2017. I became a parent that year, started transitioning, and also my dad died. It was Quite the Year.\n\nSomething about all that made me want to reconnect with this site, and I did. I took part in [[*user Rimple]]'s Draft Swap, and got assigned a draft about a Denny's that was also a flowering plant. That became [[[SCP-3694]]]. It's never been a big performer, but I like it.\n\nHanging around IRC that year, I happened to note that [[[SCP-351]]] was close to getting negative rating, and in collaboration with [[*user NatVoltaic]], we applied to rewrite it. It has an actual story now!\n\nThat third credit qualified me for an author page, so naturally I didn't make one for five years. Hung out a bit more but fell away again, largely because logging in to IRC and staying on it enough to participate was a pain on my smartphone, and parenthood is extremely distracting so I was rarely at my desktop any more.\n\nFast forward to 2022. My daughter is in school now and I suddenly have free time again. One of my reactivate interests is writing, so I check out SCP again, which has really exploded in content terms over those five years. I fall back in love with it, and luckily enough a contest is starting up around when I'm looking in: DepartmentCon.\n\nI'd had the vague idea for what became the Telecommunications Monitoring Office back in my 2017 era. Back then it was just going to be a single tale rather than a full department  just to explore what it's like to be a Foundation staffer at a low level of clearance and importance. In the context of DepartmentCon, it blossomed into a whole thing which I'm very proud of. I'm the primary writer on four of the pages my team enters. And... well,  that brings us up to date at the time of writing.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Notes on My Stuff]]\nComing soon.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Contact and Living Will]]\nI'm Meserach#4776 on Discord. That's by far the best way to contact me for SCP stuff, and for now it's also the only way. I should work out some kind of backup.\n\nNobody in the community has my phone number, and for now that's how I'd like it to remain.\n\nIf I'm absent from the wiki for five years, or I die or am otherwise incapacitated, I authorise [[*user Dysadron]] to take ownership of my works and make whatever decisions about them are required.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Scrawl On The Wall]]\nApparently it's traditional to have a space visitors are allowed to leave messages on. Have at it, you hyenas.\n\nFirst, and why don't you also come to the **{{[[[jack-waltz |basement]]]}}**.\n\nSecond! Loved working with you for Deptcon and I can't wait to interact with you in the future :) you're a pretty amazing author and I feel honored to have been your teammate! -**[[*user BattleblockB0ss]]**\n\neep - [[*user Elenee FishTruck]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: #fff;\"]]\nI'm not really good with words, but I'm really glad to have participated in DeptCon with you; you are such a cool author, and I'm eager to see more writings of yours! Working with you has definitely been a crazy experience, and I wil not forget this contest :D\n\n,,god dammit Elenee i wanted to be the third!,,\n,,also pls ignore my broken english,,\n[[>]]\n{{~ [[*user Agente Shuffle]]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\neep - [[*user Elenee FishTruck]]\n\n> Hi Meserach, I haven't seen or contacted to you before but I just want to say that you are an amazing author, especially with your tale series for deptcon :) Another thing is that I want to thank you for being a critter for my work, your advice helped me a lots for me to post it!
