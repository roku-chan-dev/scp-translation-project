Both pages will remain separate until our editors figure out how to effectively blend them together.\n\nThe misconceptions listed here were often caused by the lack of information on the anomalous that was available under the Veil. Others were the result of active misinformation efforts on the part of normalcy-enforcing organisations. \n\nThere is no evidence pointing to the existence of \"super anomalous\" phenomena that a \"super Foundation\" is still keeping secret from the public. This lack of evidence does not count as evidence.\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"text-indent: 2.5em\"]]\n//This is a dynamic list frequently updated by a multitude of contributors and as such, may vary in tone and intent.

Due to the nature of this civilization and the impact of the Impasse, it is impossible to confirm whether factually incorrect beliefs about them are genuine misconceptions or actual facts that ceased to be real.**\n\n++ Historical events\n* The Big Bang was not the result of a presupposed \"Zeroeth Occult War\" waged between theological entities. \n* There was no secret period of prehistory referred to as the \"Beginner century\", although such a claim has been made by controversial polemist Rerweniusz Hekswiński. \n* While Gamers Against Weed did participate in the \"War On Drugs\" they were, in fact, on the side of the drugs.\n* The mass hallucination of Lyon in 2003 was not in itself an anomalous event. The city was at the time plagued by a widespread infohazardous anomaly. To combat this anomaly, the local Foundation Site, itself under the effects of the anomaly, attempted to flood the city's water supply with amnestics. A weakened operator mistakenly poured the Site's supply of agnostics instead, trigerring the mass hallucination. The agnostics' effects were so strong that the anomaly itself was still purged from the citizens' minds.\n* None of the known Occult Wars were caused by an angry correspondence between occult practitioners.  However, circa 5 BCE, Joseph of Arimathea (no relation) wrote to Merlin of England, demanding the latter relinquish the recipe for alchemical brownies which he refused to do.  This led to an eight-year conflict gathering together anomalous forces from across Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.  This conflict was colloquially referred to as the first (and last) Alchemical War.\n* The Satanic Panic which rose to prominence in the 1970s and 1980s across the United States and United Kingdom was engineered by the SCP Foundation, utilizing agents to execute false occult activity and reports thereof.  This was in attempt to distract the populace from real life demonic rituals and goods being sold by a company calling itself [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6237 | ERS LLC]]].  \n* The beginning of the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom was not caused by access to better technologies, but the result of an occult ritual to sacrifice a god by a group of mystic industrialists in 18^^th^^ century Yorkshire.\n* The unexpected eruption of the dormant volcano in Yellowstone National Park in April 2008 was not the result of natural tectonic activity but caused by an XK Extinction Class Reality Altering Event. There was never an underground facility at Yellowstone housing a Foundation created machine representing a backup plan for remediation of complete human extinction.\n\n++ Important figures and entities\n[[include component:image-block name=sunking.jpg|align=right|caption=Besides Sauelsueor, Louis XIV also claimed familial relations with 371 other sun-affiliated beings, none of whom have affirmed those claims.|width=250px]]\n* Despite [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-179 | Sauelsueor]]] often speaking in French, her \"brother\" was not French King Louis XIV also known as \"the sun king\".\n* Chicago Spirit gang leader [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/big-dick-chappell Richard Chappell] was not involved in a romantic relationship with Al Capone. This urban legend originates from the former experiencing a particularly vivid dream, which his ontokinetic abilities briefly projected into reality, long enough for people to witness it.\n* Similarly, Grand Karcist Ion was not involved romantically with High Priest Robert Bumaro. Some ancient texts and illustrations did depict the two of them engaging in acts of romance and passion, but those were all deemed to have been works of fiction. This tradition continues today.\n* Gamers Against Weed moderator \"bones\" is not secretely operated by mafia boss Marie Suratt, and is in no way affiliated with the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5572 | Bone Batallion]]], although it has been widely rumored that it does in fact have a skeleton.  This has not been confirmed.\n* Canadian Prime Minister [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5054-ex Joe Clark] was not either of those things.\n* The SCP Foundation's D-Class personel were not all death row inmates. While such individuals were included, other sources included inmates with less severe sentences, captured members of hostile factions and marginalised populations. In the organisation's latter years, parts of it shifted to using cloning or other, more ethical sources of acquiring personel.\n* The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) never sued Wilson's Wildlife Solutions (WWS) for copyright infrigement. While the two organizations have been involved in a legal battle, this was over the poor outcome of a joint reintroduction effort and was amicably resolved once evidence of third-party meddling was discovered.\n* Despite the claim finding popularity among leftist communities, there is no concrete evidence proving that Iris Dark murdered Mark Zuckerberg.\n* Despite the fact that every US president to date was in some way anomalous or affected by anomalous entities and/or phenomena, it is entirely coincidental, and not an intrinsic property of being a POTUS.\n * Donald J. Trump’s unusual and unexpected popularity among conservative voters in the United States 2016 Presidential Election is not in fact an anomaly, the voters in the U.S. have a long history of voting against their interests.  However, his hair is an anomalous extraterrestrial lifeform from an exoplanet currently orbiting Betelgeuse.\n* Despite possessing a limited degree of electrokinesis, Nikola Tesla was not a thaumaturge.\n* Dr. Wondertainment is an actual doctor, with a PhD in Cultural Studies.\n* Vlad III, Voivode of Wallachia, more widely known as Vlad Tepes Dracula, was not in any way a vampire.  However, he was a Daevite resurgent, attempting to reignite the Daeva cultural practices in 15^^th^^ century Wallachia.\n* If real, Odysseus would still not have been the first person to become \"Nobody\", as evidenced by the fact that he retained his identity both before and after claiming to be called as such.\n* The current French President did not use anomalous means to directly manipulate voters. His opponent from the RN party did hire memeticists to influence citizens on a wide scale, unaware that Mr. Guillot had himself hired infiltration experts from [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/centre-de-primordial Primordial] in order to find compromising information on other candidates. Once this information was made public, Mr. Guillot became the clear favourite and went on to win the election.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n+ Arts and Culture\n[[include component:image-block name=creepydolls.jpg|align=right|caption=Those few adults immune to the hex's effects tend to become collectors of cursed dolls, which is perfectly fine as it keeps them away from everyone else.|width=250px]]\n* The Slavic folklore ritual known as \"dziady\", if performed correctly is effective and can summon the undead. Despite this, the common form in which the ritual is practiced does not produce actual results; this is due to manipulation from Normalcy organizations in the past.\n* Anomalous dolls are not dangerous or particularly rare, as over 89% of dolls sold in the last two centuries have been burdened with a curse or hex.  However, these curses invariably only cause most adults to find the toys unsettling, especially the eyes as they are objectively terrifying.\n\n++ Business\n* The Wonderworld Theme Park was not kept open even as it suffered catastrophic structural damage during the Impasse. The company simply turned it into a guided tour, advertising it as an \"immersive all-ages experience of the death of magic and wonder.\"\n* While some businesses operated by members of the Little Folk still accept songs as legal tender, the practice has mostly fallen out of use due to inflation.\n* Advertising tactics for consumer goods – such as jingles, commercials, and slogans – are not usually anomalous in 97% of cases.  The companies that sell such products hire psychological and advertising consultants to take advantage of decades of accumulated techniques.  Additionally, you’re gullible.\n* Marshal, Carter & Dark LLC is not (as is widely believed) immune from taxation; the company is severely in arrears in 17 different nations on account of their failure to pay back taxes.\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]] is not incorporated in any nation on Earth.  The same cannot be said with certainty of all planets with such corporate law traditions.\n\n++ Food and cooking\n[[include component:image-block name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/list-of-common-anomalous-misconceptions/hellfireroast.jpg |align=right| caption=The \"hellfire roast\" ritual, commonly used in restaurants for its sensational effects. The same results can be achieved with 10 minutes in a preheated oven.|width=250px]]\n* Pyromancy does not increase the nutritional value of food cooked using it. In fact, pyromancy is considered less efficient and more dangerous than most models of modern ovens.\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-330 | VNP-330]]] is not now nor will ever be a solution to repeat offenders in the United States criminal penal system.  Although, it is being considered for treatment of billionaires sending random messages on social media platforms they own.\n* Ambrose Restaurants does not have access to the original recipe for Ambrosia, the mythical divine food. According to the testimonies of multiple divine entities who have had access to the exclusive menu in which it is served, the version prepared by Ambrose restaurants is both different and of higher quality.\n* Despite the recent viral meme on TikTok, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-006 | VNP-006]]] has never been and never will be the essential base of albondigas soup.  That has always been chicken and cilantro.\n\n++ Language\n* Memetics is a thoroughly studied science with understood principles, and is not simply an advanced form of hypnosis or of the placebo effect.\n* Deer College was named after Reed College, the institution's mundane counterpart in Oregon's Portland. All stories about the college's founders being a herd of highly-intelligent deer are unfounded.\n* Gaining proficiency in languages with anomalous means of accurately expressing qualia is not a verified cure for any form of colorblindess.\n* The vast majority of vocalized spells are not in Latin. A few spells are, but most of them are not grammatically correct.\n * \"Lorem ipsum\" has never been a spell.\n* The letter thorn (Þ þ) was removed from the English alphabet not because of the advent of printing, but because it was discovered to cause anomalous headaches for native speakers.\n\n++ Law, crime and military\n[[include component:image-block name=dcalfine.jpg|align=right|caption=D.C. al Fine, Undersecretary General of the Global Occult Coalition. There exist no records of her early life and it is still unknown whether she is a citizen of any of the UN's member states.|width=250px]]\n* Killing an alternate version of yourself, encountered through the Wanderers' Library or other means of multiversal travel, will not grant you their skills, knowledge or strength. All precedent cases of such actions were performed by individuals whose abilities allowed for these transfers.\n* While there exists a proven way to acumulate [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5383 | such an enormous quantity of sin]]] that it reverts to a positive value and allows one to obtain a guaranteed place in a desirable afterlife, there is currently no known method to achieve similar results for other negative factors. Mr. Bellford, who attempted to achieve this with debt, did not become a billionaire and is in fact actively pursued by several collecting agencies.\n* No amount of tax money collected in the United States was given to the SCP Foundation after 1967.  Canada, on the other hand, has donated roughly 5% of its taxation proceeds to the Foundation since inception.\n* Extracting James \"Saul Goodman\" McGill from his lower narrative plane to baseline reality in order for him to defend someone in court has been attempted and is, in fact, illegal. The same applies for Phoenix Wright or any other fictional lawyer.\n* The GOC, or Global Occult Coalition, has been claiming it is governed by the international government organization, the United Nations, for as long as it has been in existence.  But no member states of the UN ever admitted having previous knowledge of the GOC prior to the fall of the Veil.  That being said, amnestics work on government leaders as well as they do on civilians, so what does any of that prove?\n* PENTAGRAM, the military body of the United States Armed Forces that deals with the anomalous, has never been officially designated as such. The wordplay was just so catchy that it became widespread in common parlance.\n\n\n++ Literature\n* J.R.R Tolkien's work was not inspired by the story of the Fae Empire and Yeren and human cultures. Despite this, similarities between the two have yet to be explained.\n* The best-selling novel //The Last of the Solarch// was not written by --Adam Royce-- --Eva Nil-- --Tony Holland-- but can in fact be attributed to --Simone Dulac-- --Henry Nolan-- --Marion Earster--. **Section currently under edit-lock until the current time-travelling authorial conflict ends.**\n* The House of Leaves is not an anomalous book, but the author has visited two ascendant layers of the metafictional universe and it left them changed.  None of that affected the writing of the book, but it's interesting nonetheless.\n\n++ Film and Television\n* The SCP Foundation was not the origin of the depiction of the Illuminati in popular culture. The organisation's image was the result of a deal struck between it and the Walt Disney Corporation once both were members of the GOC's Council of 108.\n* The 1969 moon landing broadcast was not anomalous in any way, but a fake engineered to combat Flat Earth conspiracies.  The cumulative effect of the consistent belief of hundreds of millions of viewers all perceiving the landing at the same time retroactively rewrote reality such that the mission to the moon was completed as originally shown.  Foundation agents erased all information concerning the mock recording and amnesticized the authors of the original broadcast.\n* No VKTM production has ever received an Oscar. While there exists video evidence of them receiving awards – on three separate occasions: 1996, 2006, and 2022 – during the ceremonies, the body language of the actors during these videos and following interviews clearly indicates they were made to perform under threat. However, their 2008 film //A sad retelling of your father's life// did win the Jury's Prize during that year's Cannes Festival.\n* Walt Disney was not frozen after death, but the four Warner Brothers – Harry, Albert, Sam, and Jack Warner – are still alive through anomalous means and in control of their company. As evidenced by the poor direction of their company’s attempt at creating superhero cinema, these means most likely rendered them unable to understand modern audience mindsets.\n* Although the three //Back to the Future// films were made with guidelines provided by the SCP Foundation Temporal Anomalies Department, the depiction of time travel in the franchise is not factually correct.\n\n++ Music\n* [[[https://youtu.be/dRtPnLIwwR4 | Nälkän folk chants]]] are not capable of regrowing limbs on the listeners if recorded, but in-person audiences have noted significant hair and nail growth after only a short period of time.  Additionally, those seeking to emulate the sounds of the chants should exercise caution, as the traditional harmonies are only possible with a backup lung and a specifically modified uvula.\n* Popular pop-rock trio known as the \"Bee Gees\" are actually a memetic contagion and thus do not exist. This contagion was used as a stopgap to prevent infection by an antimemetic contagion in the form of a non-existent rock-pop trio, the \"Gee Bees\". Unfortunately, Foundation countermeasures were far more virulent, imprinting permanently on most, even after self-annihilation of the \"Gee Bees\" proved successful. According to our sources,^^//[citation needed]//^^ research into replicating the \"Gee Bees\" for use in neutralizing the \"Bee Gees\" is a Foundation priority.\n\n++ Religion\n* The Scarlet King entity shouldn't be mistaken with the music band \"King Crimson\" who have been proven to not be affiliated with any cult worshipping said entity. Likewise, the Stand power featured in the series \"Jojo's Bizarre Adventure\" was named after the band, not the entity.\n* The Horizon Initiative did not name themselves after a supposed mission to make the Earth flat. The Earth has only been round since 1957, long after the founding of the organization, so that clearly cannot be the source of their name.\n* There is no Church of the First Hytoth and there never has been. However, there is a Third.\n\n++ Sports\n* There is nothing anomalous about the popularity of sports, but the game of golf regularly violates the laws of physics for unknown reasons.\n* The 2024 Olympic Games were not the first to allow members of non-human species to compete. Although the International Olympic Committee was, from its founding, pressured by Normalcy Organizations to adhere to the Veil, these organizations had no sway over the ancient Olympics where anomalous contestants and games were common.\n* There is no official rule saying that a dog with human intelligence cannot play basketball.\n\n++ Video Games\n* //The Jailor 3: Witch Hunt// parody video game published by members of the Serpent's Hand did not have a tracking system which could detect whether a player was a member of the SCP Foundation based on how good they were at the game. However, it did include a now-deleted ending that only such members could achieve due to being hidden behind specific knowledge checks and memetic triggers. Upon completion of this ending, the game would leak the player's home address on a multitude of social medias.\n* Arcadia was not the first distributer and developer of anomalous videogames. The first company to do so was Capcom.\n* Despite the common rumor since the fall of the Veil, there is no Bureau of Control, federal or otherwise.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n+ Science, technology and mathematics\n* While the Impasse was a naturally occurring event, it was caused, influenced and directed -- albeit unknowingly -- by Normalcy-enforcing organizations.\n\n++ Astronomy and spaceflight\n* Only approximately 57% of Luna is made of cheese, the rest of the moon is made up of rock, steel, plastic, and the sacrificed dreams of romantic teenagers writing in journals.\n* Remains of a viking langskip were not found on the Moon, they were found in a crater on Mars.\n* [[[SCP-871 |VNP-871]]] is not a viable fuel source for interstellar flight, no matter what the engine design.\n* There is not a crashed alien warship floating in the atmosphere of Jupiter. It’s on Saturn.\n* The International Space Station was not equipped by a covert Foundation module to detect threats from outer space. The Foundation's numerous lunar bases handled this responsibility.\n\n\n++ Biology\n[[include component:image-block name=varanus.jpg|align=right|caption=A juvenile //Varanus Vanguardis// pictured in containment prior to the species' extinction. Note the natural absence of wings. |width=250px]]\n* Despite the Yeren people having influenced the Bigfoot myth, the entity that resulted from that myth is in fact wholly distinct from their species.\n* The mutations recently experienced by the global population of bees were not all intended. The ecological activists who triggered the event admitted they only wanted to make bees better adapted to global warming. However, they were unaware of the innate anomalous properties that many species of bees possess, which caused minor, but unplanned additional mutations.\n* Members of the //Varanus Vanguardis// species are not capable of flight. Before it went extinct during the Impasse, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-124-fr the species] did not possess wings. Dr. Fontaine, a Vanguard employee had kept some DNA samples from her days in the Foundation and successfully cloned the species back into existence, only to discover that those samples had been altered to give the specimens wings. These wings are not sufficient to grant specimens the ability to fly, only making them able to glide over short distances.\n* In contrast to the widely held belief, creating a perfect copy of your own body with carnomancy and consuming the resulting material is not a treatment for male pattern baldness, dry eye, hives, arthritis, erectile dysfunction, muscle growth, or low testosterone.  However, it is quite effective in treating nail fungus growth and contracting kuru.\n* Not all ectoplasmic entities originate from deceased people or entities. Beyond those of unknown origins, some originate from plants, objects, concepts, artifical consciousnesses, or even other ectoplasmic entities. On rare occasion, they may even originate from still living sources.\n\n++ Pataphysics\n* Pataphysics, the science of how our universe tends to follow narrative tropes, is not related to the work of Alfred Jarry. Our reality is not one of his plays brought into existence.\n* Queen Mab is not, nor has she ever been, a fictional entity; her existence is not a pataphysical effect originating from Shakespeare's works.\n\n++ Chemistry and materials science\n* Beryllium bronze is not anomalously resistant to damage, thaumaturgic ritual energies, or reality warping.  Ancient peoples (such as the Daeva, Nälkän and Mekhanite peoples) preferred a material that resisted rust in their ritual implements and accoutrements.\n* Taking balanced doses of amnestics and mnestics at the same time will not result in a person having their past memories replaced by memories from the future. This misconception was based on a viral joke, itself based on the idea of taking Dayquil and Nyquil together.\n* Telekill alloy has the physical properties of a regular type of metal, and can reach its melting point simply by reaching a temperature of 4500°C; not by having a nearby telepath experience a \"meltdown\".\n\n++ Ontokinetics\n* Alien X and other //Celestialsapiens// from the //Ben10// franchise were not intended to be a reference to real-life reality bending and are not a faithful representation of ontokinetic entities and their abilities.\n* Getting bitten by a reality bender, being exposed to high level of Humes radiations, being caught in the explosion of a Reality Anchor, or falling into a tub of liquefied Humes are not reliable ways to obtain reality-bending abilities. \n* The Hume (1 Hm) is both an SI derived unit, and a metric unit. Its imperial counterparts are the Thomson (1 Tm) equal to ~1.347 Hm, and the Davidson (1 Dv) equal to ~17 Tm or ~22.899 Hm.\n\n++ Thaumaturgy\n* Elemental thaumaturges are not immune to their respective elements. The reason why they are able to perform their workings without harming themselves is that they are well-studied and prepared. Attempting to copy them without training poses a significant risk of burns, frostbite, cardiac arrest, asphyxiation or other, similar accidents.\n* Carnomancy, the study and practice of shaping flesh, is not limited to designing and bringing to life various carnivore lifeforms. However, it would certainly make //Jurassic Park// a possibility without the need for expensive genetic science.\n\n++ Computing and the Internet\n* WAN, the Maxwellist interpretation of Mekhane, has been found written into 65% of all computer programs and every single online forum/social media source code, except Mastodon. Maxwellist holy scriptures interpret this as a lack of interest from their deity, who instead prefers useful and more populated alternatives.\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/totleighsoft-hub | TotleighSoft]]]'s founder is an alien entity originally from an area of the Crab Nebula, but despite its difficulty with human languages, it is very talented at programing entertaining games and media. Those recent graduates with computing degrees should think twice before seeking employment with TotleighSoft, due to the effect such employment has had on the mental faculties of the recruited individuals.  That being said, the company's Human Resources department recently won an award for best employee benefits from the BETTAR BIZNESS BOREO.\n* Inscribing a sigil of agility onto a computer's motherboard does not make it run faster, but it does make it able to move faster in three dimensional space.\n* The Records And Information Security Administration SCP Tagging System did contain a \"milk\" tag. It was removed during the formation of Vanguard.\n\n++ Engineering\n[[include component:image-block name=steampunk.jpg|align=right|caption=A young adherent to the clockwork orthodoxy (third from left) and three non-religious steampunk fans photographed by Regina Fiore for her album //Indistinguishable Anomalous//.|width=250px]]\n* Automatons created by Anderson Robotics or others following the same methods cannot be disabled by being made to process a paradox. However, due to the clash between the natures of their bodies and their souls, they are particularly vulnerable to existential dread. Aren't we all?\n* Limb replacement technology developed by the Church of the Broken God does have a few drawbacks, but not as many as is commonly thought. The primary one is that individuals who accept such modifications will never cease having to explain that they are in fact not a fan of Steam Punk and that there is no convention in town.\n\n++ Economics\n* Despite the widespread belief, the American Dollar is not an anomalous conjuring made of cocaine and skin cells. It also contains paper.\n* NFTs are entirely too mundane a technological advance of the economy to be anomalous, but most cryptocurrency sales pitches are at least 50% memetic in nature. Unfortunately for hopeful sellers, the coding in the memetics is only effective against other cryptobros, and has no effect on an individual with no already existing interest in cryptocurrency.\n \n++ Geography\n* The extradimensional 13th region of France did not have its landmass reshaped when its name was officially changed from \"Nordabris\" to \"Middle-Normandy\". The intended effect was to limit the location of Ways leading to it, binding them to the border between the regions of Lower and Upper Normandy. This succeeded.\n* A Free Port by the name of Three Pragues connecting Prague, Czech Republic with Prague, Oklahoma, USA and Praga, Warsaw, Poland does not exist, but the mayors of those cities are open to take bids for the creation of one.\n* The Mariana Trench was not dug out by a hatching [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-169 | VNP-169]]] but had the corresponding mass, through means yet unknown, teleported away. It now makes up for a noticeable portion of Mount Olympus. The one on Mars.\n\n++ Disease and preventive healthcare\n[[include component:image-block name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/list-of-common-anomalous-misconceptions/Ibn%20Sina.jpg |align=right|caption=The philosopher and physician Ibn Sina was one of the first to conceive of the consequences of immortality in his treatise //Longevity of the human mind//.|width=250px]]\n* A person's IQ score has no impact on their CRV.\n* \"Sanity fossilization\", \"Eldritch madness\", \"Lich syndrome\" and \"Enforced obsolecence\" are all popular theories to explain the noted tendency that immortals or other individuals with extremely long lifespans have to experience mental degradation, develop certain conditions or generally suffer from multiple ailments. However, there is no proven single source to this tendency and these symptoms are not universal. These symptoms may come from innate conditions that are given more time to develop, from the prices paid to extend one's lifespan, or simply from the fact that these individuals experience more impacting events during their lives.\n* Nälkän carnomancy is in fact very effective for preventing transmission of COVID-19 and other airborn pathogens – unfortunately it requires the construction of a filter organ attached to the esophagus through which all oxygen passes.  \n\n++ Alcoholic beverages\n* Hemovores which consume an intoxicated person's blood will not in turn become intoxicated. Their metabolism will filter out unecessary substances from the blood, which they will then begin to digest.\n* The use of extradimensional pocket spaces with an accelerated timeflow to speed up the fermentation of wine is neither unsafe nor illegal. The reason why no major wine company is using this method is that such spaces are currently out of stock after their massive buyout by global martial arts organizations.\n* While creating a substance with an alcohol content of more than 100% is entirely possible and fairly easy, it is illegal in 180 countries and 20 free ports.\n\n++ Inventions\n* Scranton Reality Anchors were named after their inventor, Robert Scranton, not because they keep local reality at the same level as in the town of Scranton, Pennsylvania – which, coincidentally, is just about the least anomalous place on Earth other than Ohio.\n* The famous quote by Arthur C. Clarke, \"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,\" is categorically false.  The Foundation had contained significantly advanced science for decades, but they were easily distinguishable from actual magic.  For example, no one has yet invented a computer that can predict the occurrence of genetically inherited diseases to 100% efficiency, and yet the Daeva had a tree that, using a single blood sample, was able to predict every possible outcome of a bloodline, including offspring from specific partners.\n* Thomas Edison's inventions were not //all// ideas stolen from his alternate dimension counterparts, some were from alternate timelines.\n\n++ Mathematics\n* While it was confirmed that the Banach-Tarski Paradox does work in real life and can be used to create duplicates of physical objects, Stefan Banach did not use it to create clones of himself. It was a joke spread by paramathematicians in the 1950s.\n* Although no research into a negative [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1313 equation] that would result into the sum of minus one bear has ever been completed, this is not because such research has been outlawed at the behest of environmental agencies. In fact, this research has been attempted both by Foundation mathematicians in the past and recently by civilians, all of whom have been found dead from claw-like wounds in the back of their necks. \n\n++ Physics\n* Many worlds theory – which envisions the multiverse like a branching tree based on causal changes from one universe to another – is only partially accurate.  Although new timelines can be formed through major choices, called pivots, other universes exist without any causal relation to our own.  For example, the Wanderers' Library, Alagadda, and many pocket universes all exist independently from our reality.  Interestingly, Corbenic is entirely connected to our reality as apparently it is one of many \"after life\" dimensions that require death to enter its domain.  This is not encouraged, as despite the Three Moons Initiative tourist bureau ad campaigns, you probably will not actually love it there.\n* Particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider cannot open portals to different afterlifes, the infamous incident in 2015 merely resulted from an endurance test gone wrong.\n\n++ Demonology\n* The existence of Tartarian Class Entities (more colloquially referred to as demons) does not prove theists correct, as there are some pataphysicists who theorize that the widespread belief in the condition of Damnation had a significant effect on the Noosphere and adjacent realities.  It also does not preclude the possibility that you’re going to spend eternity completely aware of the slow, painful decomposition of your corporeal form.\n* Demons, despite the resistance of the American Republican political party, are perfectly allowed to apply for citizenship without change to any major developed nation’s constitutions. They must still show two forms of ID and the fees cannot be paid in human souls, only legal tender is accepted.\n\n++ Transportation\n* While some methods of instantaneous transportation do involve the death of the user followed by their reconstruction at the targeted location, they are very rarely used and other methods, although less efficient and more costly, are preferred. This is due to the punitive measures that were decreed in Article 7 of the Multi-Afterlives Overpopulation Act.\n* Creating stable, permanent Ways between extradimensional spaces is not impossible, so long as both have a stable position related to baseline reality. In 1873, an attempt to link two unanchored Free Ports resulted in the obliteration of both. Normalcy organisations then exaggerated and spread the story accross the anomalous community in order to discourage the creation of more Ways that would allow easier comunication and cooperation between Free Ports and other communities.\n* There is no such thing as a Corbenic free trial, which would allow people to return from the afterlife after a limited stay. The official advertisement campaign claiming that fact was quickly debunked by all experts on the matter.\n@@ @@\n\n+ See Also\n\n[[# final]]\n\n* ##0645AD|List of mass amnesticization events##\n* ##0645AD|List of reality restructuration events##\n* ##0645AD|The great history books reprinting of 2023##\n* ##0645AD|Publicly available Vanguard database##\n* And this list's mundane -- but no less important -- counterpart: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_common_misconceptions the List of common misconceptions]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** hellfireroast.jpg\n> **Author:** Remy Sharp\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/38257258@N00/13318056183\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** Varanust.jpg\n> **Author:** Snakecollector\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/8373783@N07/3670389890\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** sunking.jpg\n> **Author:** Hyacinthe Rigaud\n> **License:** Public domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Louis_XIV_of_France.jpg\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** creepydolls.jpg\n> **Author:** Lorie Shaull\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Creepy_Doll_Contest_at_the_History_Center_of_Olmsted_County_in_Rochester,_Minnesota.jpg\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** Ibn Sina.jpg\n> **Author:** Iranian Post Office, cropped by Guezma\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** https://wellcomecollection.org/works/xjj3v2wh?wellcomeImagesUrl=/indexplus/image/L0000866.html\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** Steampunk.jpg\n> **Author:** Steampunk Family the Von Hedwigs\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Steampunk_Worlds_Fair_%284629447382%29.jpg\n@@ @@\n> **Filename:** dcalfine.jpg\n> **Author:** Anton Petukhov\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/113047835@N04/16824280347 Flickr\n\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
