Initial accounts were contradictory and none interviewed were particularly forthcoming.\n> \n> Three days following the incident, SCP-████, previously known as Vincent Madyson, spoke with interviewers to clarify what had happened. In its own words:\n> \n>> //I mean, fuck it, might as well try and get the story straight. Especially if everyone else is too tight-lipped to do so.//\n> \n> Following //Interview ████-A// and //Interview ████-B//, the rest of those involved gave their own statements. See addena for more information.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://68.media.tumblr.com/770f164961755be3295aa36db4be60d4/tumblr_p64bpg3mYT1w6i6mko1_1280.png|caption=Thanks to Zhange!
