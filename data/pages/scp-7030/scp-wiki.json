Research into risk factors for SCP-7030 is ongoing; all efforts and potential leads should be directed to the attention of Dr. Helen Ouyang and team.\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nThis is probably the point at which people should have realized they really had no idea what the hell they were doing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nnot like anyone else knew any better either. they did about as well as they could. gotta give em that i guess\n\n[[/div]]\n\nPrior efforts to contain the public dissemination of SCP-7030 awareness have been discontinued, due to initiation of a BK-class “Broken Masquerade” event. Crowd control efforts to limit widespread panic as a result of SCP-7030 have been similarly discontinued due to resource allocation issues; local site directors should exercise their own judgment with regards to maintaining discipline in on-site personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7030 is a designation given to a series of related ontological phenomena that result in the disappearance of affected entities from local realspace. As per the current revision of this documentation, SCP-7030 is believed to have affected between 50 and 70 percent of the human population.[[footnote]]Due to difficulties with assessing this number, both logistically and psychologically, estimates concerning SCP-7030’s exact extent are no longer being generated.[[/footnote]]\n\nDisappearance events connected to SCP-7030 happen instantaneously and spontaneously. Research efforts into risk factors for SCP-7030 affliction are ongoing, but as of yet, causal or correlative links remain unsupported by peer-reviewed evidence. Additionally, entities affected by SCP-7030 disappear from all known realities in //N//-topological realspace[[footnote]]Currently verified for up to N=7 semi-adjacent realities[[/footnote]], indicating that SCP-7030 affects ontological signatures as opposed to physical or spiritual ones. The significance of this is as of yet unknown.\n\nThe first confirmed SCP-7030 event occurred on July 5th, 2026, but interpolating from the current rate of SCP-7030 affliction suggests an actual first event somewhere between late 2024 to early 2025. Absent any future mitigation methods for SCP-7030, it is believed that the anomaly will eventually cause the disappearance of all human life by 20██.\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nIt’s weird to read it spelled out like that.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nmmm\n\ndoesn’t feel as weird now as it used to. i think you just get used to the feeling.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nNo, for sure.

I dunno.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-7030 Update 1:** By late 2026, SCP-7030 events had begun to accelerate in both frequency and severity. Although previous events targeted singular individuals in isolated events, from November 2026 onwards, group disappearances became a recurring phenomenon associated with SCP-7030. Concurrently, efforts to limit the awareness of SCP-7030 began to lose effectiveness due to a combination of the increasing severity of the anomaly and growing public acknowledgment of the phenomena. In particular, threads about the anomaly had begun to circulate in online conspiracy theory message boards, and search analytics for related terms began to spike.\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 1px #444444; background:#fed7b0; color:#789922; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n**Anonymous**  07-Nov-2026 - 01:49:20 - #235602\n\n-----\n\nWhen are people gonna wake the fuck up honestly like shit is getting ridiculous at this point.\n\nPeople are not suppose to fuckinggg disappear like that.

No trace of disappeared individuals has been found in any capacity, though we have been able to verify that disappearance events are not localized to our own reality; disappearance erases persons affected from all known adjacent realities. Even usage of [[[SCP-2000]]] produced no success; attempts to recover an affected individual resulted in a never before seen machine error.\n\n**On Risk Factor Identification:** No conclusive correlative links have been found to date. Minor correlations have been observed in the data set, but don’t rise above the level of statistical noise upon further analysis.\n\n**On Protective Measures:** The anomaly seems to strike indiscriminately and without warning. Not even SRAs have been shown to provide any form of protection, and no amount of reality ablation shielding has proven to be effective.\n\nOne note: at this point, several anomalies under Foundation observation have begun to be affected by SCP-7030, so there’s one bright side at least. Perhaps we won’t even need to exist by the time the anomaly’s through with us.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n- Dr. Helen Ouyang, Director, Project Reclamation\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nyeah, to be honest with you, no idea wtf this means.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nI looked through some of the other archives, but I didn't get much information either.

Immediately following the disappearance of some individuals affected by SCP-7030, an unspecified entity manifests itself in the vicinity of the disappearance event. Said entities (now designated SCP-7030-1) resemble statues of black humanoid figures, ranging in size from 0.5m to 3m tall. SCP-7030-1 instances appear to consist of an unidentified black, crystalline material that radiates a low level of heat, making entities feel warm to the touch.\n\nDetailed testing under Project Reclamation efforts could not identify an origin, purpose, or more specific material composition for SCP-7030 entities. However, analysis of disappearance events associated with SCP-7030-1 manifestations was able to correlate overall quantity of disappeared persons with resulting SCP-7030-1 size; i.e, the larger the size of the disappearance event, the larger the associated SCP-7030-1 instance.\n\nDue to the accelerating rate of SCP-7030 exposure, it was deemed operationally impossible to maintain separation of Foundation assets and activities from civilian knowledge. On March 13th, 2028, with a 11-2 vote of the O5 Council, the Foundation enacted Resolution Alpha-01, and officially declared a BK-Class “Broken Masquerade” Scenario to be in effect. Foundation operations were ordered to merge collaboration efforts with civilian research institutions in order to increase the pace of ongoing investigations.\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nThe day everything really changed.

Stockwell claimed to have received a message from the one true universal god, who told him that SCP-7030 was in actuality a purge of all “heretics” from the planet under her watch. While numerous other apocalypse cults, syncretic movements, and extremist offshoots of existing religions also arose during this period, the Hidden Way received significant attention after Stockwell successfully predicted the disappearances of several high-profile critics.\n \nThe Hidden Way singled out individuals who had survived group disappearance events from SCP-7030 as being “holy,” claiming that these “saints” had been protected by God from the ongoing purge. Stockwell, having survived no fewer than three documented mass disappearances, was anointed as the Patriarch of the Hidden Way.\n \nAdditionally, the Hidden Way claimed that SCP-7030-1 instances were in fact, secret “angels” who had been sent by God to carry out her will in purging alleged heretics. As a result, research efforts at mass disappearance sites became significantly more difficult due to large numbers of Hidden Way adherents who had to be removed by force.\n \n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n \nhmm. these idiots. way to profit at the end of the world.\n \n[[/div]]\n \n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n \nThey came to my house you know.

How's the situation with you, Marcus?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nto be honest with you, anna: not hot. we're trying the best we can, but there's not a whole lot of people left. whole truck of milk delivery went sour bc the driver disappeared mid drive and nobody knew. nobody else around to check up on things either. you do what you can i guess, but there's too much to do and not enough people to do it. least we're not starving yet i guess.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nWe're all just getting by, I guess.

The SCP-7030-1 entity that spawned from the event was 300 meters tall, and materialized directly over the Chrysler Building, destroying it upon impact and resulting in an additional 5,000 casualties. The Hidden Way immediately declared the event to be the beginning of their mass rapture, and organized a 1,000 person rally at the base of the 7030-1 instance.\n \nThe resulting congregation gathered to hear Stockwell give a sermon on the nature of sin, and how the assembled faithful had been blessed for opening their eyes to the hidden way before them. However, approximately 17 minutes into his speech, an SCP-7030 event triggered within the crowd, affecting about two thirds of the gathered attendees. An SCP-7030-1 instance followed the initial disappearance event, manifesting above the gathered people. The descent of the instance crushed numerous people below it, leading to an additional 50 deaths, including Stockwell himself. Losing direction after what came to be known as the Brooklyn Massacre, the Hidden Way broke apart entirely shortly afterwards.\n \n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n \nyeah. think that’s what they call karma.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**SCP-7030 Update 7:** Due to the rapid acceleration of SCP-7030, all non-essential Foundation activities have been indefinitely suspended. As the majority of anomalies formerly under Foundation purview have also disappeared as a result of SCP-7030, most containment and research efforts were deemed to be no longer necessary. Consolidation efforts of 95% of active sites is ongoing due to personnel issues.\n\n[[div style=\"color:#FFFFFF; background:#000000; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nanna?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background:#ADD8E6; float: center; border: solid 2px #444444; width: 570px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\nI'm here, Marcus.

One of the only good things about the world ending is that there’s a lot less light pollution. When you look up at the sky, all you see is a kaleidoscope of stars, galaxies, and more, stretching across the entire horizon like a painted blanket hanging over the world.\n\nI remember when I was a kid, my dad took my sister and I camping. It was the first time we had gone anywhere since my mom left us, and my dad was just…not ready for the experience. It rained pretty badly the first night, and our tent was old and leaky. We ate sausages out of a can and my sister cried because she didn’t have her stuffed lion with her.\n\n##white|My dad was trying really hard to make sure we had a good time though. And I remember on the second night, the clouds parted, and the sky cleared up enough for my first view of the night sky, in all of its twinkly fairy-tale beauty. Even my sister stopped crying at that one.##\n\n##white|What I remember best is that feeling I had right then and there, when I looked up at the sky, and listened to my dad point out the constellations, while he explained how each star represented a distant sun, each surrounded by its own planets and moons. I remember the sense of awe I felt, but more than that, the sensation of feeling absolutely blessed that I was alive and able to see everything that was out there. A universe filled with billions of stars, galaxies, and planets, and yet, out of all those infinite multitudes, here we were on our little dirtball, tumbling through the cosmos, alive and able to savor the joy of simply existing. It didn’t matter that I was covered in bug bites, or that my mom didn’t seem to love us anymore. I was lucky to just be alive and watching the stars.##\n\n##white|I thought about that memory last night, and how fortunate I’ve been to have made it this far, even while everyone else seems to be making their departures. I don’t know when my time will come, when I’m off to join the rest of the world in whatever place they’ve gone to. I think I’ve come to peace with not knowing, though. More than that, I’ve come to peace with the idea of disappearing. I’ve had a good run. It was a good life.##\n\n##white|**And I just feel lucky to have been a part of it all.**##\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7029]]] | SCP-7030 | [[[SCP-7031]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
