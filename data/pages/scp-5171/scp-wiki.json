Testing of SCP-5171 is currently suspended.\n\nLocating PoI-9414 has been assigned as a priority mission for MTF Alpha-7 (\"Surpassing Tindalos\").\n\n**Description:** SCP-5171 is an artificial intelligence built by PoI-9414, formerly O5-9, as an administrative assistance and memetic screening system. SCP-5171 operated on a 3rd-gen photonics processing platform allocated for all Level 5 personnel at the time, with heavily modified interfaces. While these technologies are ahead of mundane equivalents, no part of SCP-5171 was inherently anomalous at the time of its creation.\n\nOriginally designated Rhyme.aic, SCP-5171 had developed total self-awareness after PoI-9414 intentionally exposed it to a multitude of anomalous memetic agents, collectively designated SCP-5171-A. It is currently unknown how PoI-9414 acquired the skills necessary to create and utilize anomalous memetic agents in this way. While the Foundation retains a full copy of SCP-5171-A, the technical and ethical risk posed prohibits further experimentation.\n\nAccording to the log recovered after PoI-9414 defected from the Foundation (see Addendum 5171.A), SCP-5171 believed that it was a human female named \"Rima\", and that it had grown up with PoI-9414 since their childhood. Due to the mandatory data expungement procedure applied to the personal data of O5 members, this information cannot be confirmed.\n\n**Addendum 5171.A:** Log recovered from SCP-5171 interface cache, temporal metadata irretrievable. The format indicates a speech-recognition interface log.\n\n> **PoI-9414:** Hello Rima, how are you today?\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Hi, Galuh. I was wondering when you'll show up.\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** I'm so sorry, the meeting got late, I kept getting in arguments with those pesky fossils.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** No, don't be. I shouldn't have talked to you like that, I know you're very busy, and it's for both of us. It's just that sitting here all day with nothing to do...it got me all grumpy, you know? [[footnote]] Of note, SCP-5171 had never ceased functioning as administrative assistance and memetic screening system, up until its deactivation upon PoI-9414's defection. [[/footnote]]\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** I know. I'm sorry, I wish I could've brought you outside.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Like I said, don't be sorry. None of this is your fault, I'm thankful that you had time to spend with me at all.\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** But I could've done more, if only I stopped trying to fight my way through every little thing.\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** If only I listened to your parents back then.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** We're not having this conversation, Galuh.\n> \n> //(Strings of periodic data pattern follows, with no known meaning. Presumed to be environmental noise falsely parsed as speeches by the interface.)//\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Do you remember when we watched meteor showers on the beach?\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** That was so long ago, I'm surprised that you still remember it.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** There's no way I would forget. We spent a full roll of your dad's camera film. All those photographs, I could recall every single one of them as if it's yesterday.[[footnote]] A large portion of SCP-5171-A incorporate photographs, often collages arranged in certain patterns. It is theorized that these photographs affected the memory retained by SCP-5171. [[/footnote]]\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** I was so sure he'd be so angry at me. Those rolls were expensive. Instead, he started teaching me how to properly photograph a shooting star.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** I tried to convince you that he won't be angry at us for using a camera //to take pictures.// But you're just so convinced he would.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Oh wow, he's not angry that you used something for its intended purpose, how surprising.\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** When do you think was the last time I started a conversation //without// fighting intent?\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Other than with me? I'd wager a decade at least.\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** ...okay I'm not //that// controversial. I could hold a somewhat proper and neutral conversation with my subordinates.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** I wouldn't know, I never had any reason to meet them.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Not that I want to, mind you. But it just feels so bizarre thinking about you having just normal conversations about accounting or something.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Hell, I can't even imagine //the// Galuh arguing academically against a Board of Directors!\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** Yeah, I guess I changed quite a bit since way back then.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Me, on the other hand...\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** Sorry.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Sorry sorry sorry. Half your words are apology, over and over again. I didn't wake up just to hear you say sorry for days on end!\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** I...\n> \n> //(brief periodic data/silence, gaps in noise pattern indicate removed data)//\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** Did you meet the doctors today?\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** Nope, there's no test for today. I wonder if that means I'm getting better or getting worse.[[footnote]] The nature and significance of these alleged \"tests\" and \"doctors\" is unknown. [[/footnote]]\n> \n> **PoI-9414:** Don't worry, we'll be out of this place in no time.\n> \n> **SCP-5171:** I wouldn't hold my breath.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5170]]] | SCP-5171 | [[[SCP-5172]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
