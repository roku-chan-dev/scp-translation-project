We should not be facing serious threats to the Veil because a bunch of gamers are waging an internet war. Until this situation is resolved, anyone assigned to the \"Gamers Against War\" incident are working overtime to clean this up, and you will all be reprimanded for letting it get to this point. I'm disappointed that I even need to send this email.\n\nRegards,\nDirector Richard Praf\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Richard Praf\n**From:** Agent Ryan Masyl\n**Subject:** Re:Recent Veil Threats\n[[/div]]\n------\nWith all due respect, director, it isn't our fault that a bunch of kids with no other priorities are spreading memetic agents on every level of the internet. We shouldn't be punished for lacking the resources to deal with such a surprisingly massive threat. If we're going to get in trouble for not being supplied with the resources to deal with the GAW crisis, I'll be speaking to human resources.\n\nSincerely,\nAgent Ryan Masyl\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Richard Praf\n**From:** Agent Leo Wraig\n**Subject:** Re:Recent Veil Threats\n[[/div]]\n------\nSir, if you want us to effectively filter all of the memetic agents being circulated by GAW and GFW, we need resources. You're barely devoting enough people or webcrawlers to this situation and still expecting us to keep everything under the radar. If you care about protecting the Veil, stop devoting resources to less pressing projects and focus on the urgent matter at hand.\n\nThank you,\nAgent Leo Wraig\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Richard Praf\n**From:** Agent Samantha Alistor\n**Subject:** Re:Recent Veil Threats\n[[/div]]\n------\nDirector Praf,\nMarijuana usage has been fluctuating at unprecedented levels the past several days, and people are starting to notice. Approximately 17% of all images uploaded to social media platforms in the previous 48 hours have been anomalous in nature, and that number is only growing. This is more than our department can handle at the moment. Yes, GAW and GFW are just young adults, but they're powerful young adults. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/phantom-blunt At least one of them has over a dozen confirmed casualties.] We need at least 3 times the manpower and a lot more funding than you're currently granting us.
