Access to these copies is limited to personnel with Level-4 clearance or higher.\n\nA Foundation-operated bot (I/O-NEWT) is to monitor internet traffic for any indication that an SCP-3079-A instance has been discovered (particularly among online communities centered around stage magic). Should non-Foundation personnel become aware of an SCP-3079-A instance, they are to be captured and amnesticized immediately.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3079, //300 Tricks: Stage Magic Made Easy//, is a 435-page hard-back book written and self-published by Tobin Hollis.[[footnote]]A highly successful stage-magician active throughout North America during the 40s and 50s.[[/footnote]] It contains detailed instructions for performing numerous stage tricks. The majority of these tricks involve traditional techniques such as sleight-of-hand, misdirection, and optical illusions.\n\nInstances of SCP-3079-A are instructions contained within SCP-3079 which describe methods to achieve anomalous results. These instructions are scattered throughout SCP-3079; the text itself makes no distinction between anomalous and non-anomalous entries. There are 47 such instances in total.\n\nThe anomalous nature of these entries were noticed immediately prior to its publication. All copies of SCP-3079 were taken into Foundation possession; all knowledge of its existence was successfully suppressed. SCP-3079's author was taken into Foundation custody, where he remained until his death several weeks later. \n\n**Addendum 3079.1:** Notable Entries\n> = **{{3.
