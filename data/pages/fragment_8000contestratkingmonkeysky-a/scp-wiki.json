Discussion related to SCP-8060 must be closely monitored and halted in the case of any communication of its discovery.\n\nIn the event that SCP-8060's anomaly is exacerbated to the point that any significant knowledge of the television show //Societown// is enough to trigger its anomalous properties, Site-433 is to initiate a widescale operation consisting of the complete destruction of any and all records of //Societown//. This includes merchandise, fan-produced works, online discussions, and human memories. Said operation is considerably resource extensive, and must only be performed as a last resort.\n\nAny recovered SCP-8060-affected individuals are to be examined for physical or mental anomalies, to determine if they are fit to be amnesticized and released. If the individual affected is unfit to be released, they are to be contained within a standard humanoid containment cell for the purposes of examination and experimentation. \n\nPersonnel are advised to distance themselves from discussion of the anomaly if they find themselves discovering any new or unusual information on SCP-8060's whereabouts.  \n\n**Description:** SCP-8060 is the unreleased series finale of //Societown//, an educational animated children's show produced by GoI-411 (\"Sputnik Studios\")[[footnote]]Sputnik Studios was a California-based animation studio founded in 1985, since discovered to be in possession of several poorly-understood paratechnological constructs that anomalously affected their production speed, creative output, and company reputation. The company was responsible for producing around ███ pieces of media, with a total of ██ gaining anomalous properties at the time of writing. Site-433 was primarily built in order to follow the endeavors of Sputnik Studios closely. Sputnik Studios has become defunct as of 2021.[[/footnote]], and the anomalous phenomenon surrounding said finale. \n\nA summary of the premise of //Societown// can be read below. \n> **Excerpt from www.sputniktoons.com**[[footnote]]Now defunct on account of Adobe no longer supporting Flash Player.[[/footnote]] \n> ----\n> It's tough learning lessons the hard way, especially when you're a kid. It can often be a bit frightening! Sometimes, it makes it difficult to want to try at all. Grady Mitchell knew this feeling all too well... he just never knew the right things to say! \n> \n> At least, that was until one special day when he and his friends discovered a lovely bridge within the outskirts of their humble home. Across that bridge, Societown awaits! A magical realm full of many wonderful and patient creatures, ready to share their boundless knowledge to those in need of some advice. \n> \n> Join Grady, Susie, and Richelle as they discover that learning to do the right thing doesn't have to be scary. Just remember to say please! \n\n//Societown// was first aired on the Sputstation[[footnote]]A television channel owned by Sputnik Studios.[[/footnote]] \"Little Cadets\" block from 2001 to 2010, and reruns remain in syndication. Home media for //Societown// is still popular with parents of neuroatypical[[footnote]]A term used to broadly describe people with a range of cognitive developmental disorders and mental disabilities.[[/footnote]] children, and it remains one of Sputnik Studios' most popular and successful shows to date.\n\nEpisodes of //Societown// were each 24 minutes long, and typically contained two individual 12-minute stories. In most plotlines, the characters Grady, Susie and Richelle would encounter a resident of Societown (a \"Societ\") and help them to resolve a problem by utilizing a specific social skill. \n\nSCP-8060's episode title is known as \"Acceptance & Saying Goodbye\".[[footnote]]While the series was primarily episodic, with minimal emphasis on serial continuity, some episodes would uncommonly be composed of a single 24-minute-long story introducing a new character or plot element.[[/footnote]] According to a promotional summary, it involved the protagonists of //Societown// having to move from their hometown, forcing the three characters to come to terms with leaving the titular magical town behind. Specific details beyond this are scarce, but it is believed that SCP-8060 was being developed with the goal to bring the series to a close, to teach viewers how to cope with loss or change, and to reflect on the events and lessons taught throughout the series.\n\nSCP-8060's anomalous properties are activated when a human subject actively seeks out previously unrecovered information regarding it. Unrecovered information includes, but is not limited to: \n\n* Detailed transcript of the events of SCP-8060;\n\n* Storyboard and production materials relating to SCP-8060;\n\n* Commercial teasers of SCP-8060; \n\n* The production timeline of SCP-8060;\n\n* The whereabouts of Horris Curmen and Della Mornt.\n\nWhen a subject intentionally searches for undisclosed information regarding SCP-8060, they are always capable of discovering a plausible way of recovering the desired information. The medium varies depending on the methods used to search, with digital formats being the most commonly discovered during the early stages.\n\nAttempting to follow up on any of this information is often difficult, to the extent that it may confuse some individuals or discourage them from continuing to engage with the anomaly, as it typically directs them to unintuitive and unconventional sources.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8060/redherring.jpg\n|caption=An example of a physical object manifested by SCP-8060, photographed by parawatch.net user \"aha\".[[footnote]]User later reported the object as a \"red herring\".[[/footnote]] \n|align=right\n|width=200px\n]]\n\nSubjects continuing to research past this point will have physical items relating to the undisclosed information manifest in areas the subject frequents, situated in places the subject would be highly likely to discover them in. The information portrayed within these items is usually cryptic and personally intriguing to the subject. \n\nThose researching SCP-8060 at this stage will experience brief dissociative episodes, followed by intense audiovisual hallucinations. These hallucinations typically involve characters from //Societown// giving the subject advice relating to their search, but have also included unrelated and bizarre occurrences.[[footnote]]Notably, none of these hallucinations have been reported to involve the characters Grady, Susie, or Richelle.[[/footnote]] Although those experiencing these hallucinations are often aware of their abnormal nature, many have expressed an intensified feeling of curiosity upon witnessing them. It is unknown if this is the result of an anomalous influence.\n\nBy combining elements from information they have gathered[[footnote]]Often by esoteric means which would not normally provide any valid solutions.[[/footnote]] up to this point, the subject is able to acquire the location of an abandoned and typically isolated building near them in the form of coordinates. Subjects will invariably believe that these coordinates lead to the missing information they were seeking. The dissociative and hallucinatory episodes will not dissipate until the subject follows through the rest of the SCP-8060 discovery process.\n\nIf the subject reaches the coordinates by any means, the abandoned building's entryways will lead to an extradimensional space hereby referred to as SCP-8060-A, only accessible to the affected subject. The building affected by SCP-8060 is not anomalous under other conditions. After an indeterminable amount of time, subjects will return from SCP-8060-A through the same passage they entered through. 25% of subjects who have entered SCP-8060-A have not returned.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8060/pesky.jpg\n|caption=iPhone capture within SCP-8060-A. \n|align=right\n|width=160px\n]]\n\nSCP-8060-A consists of an expansive and substantially altered reality of unknown makeup resembling the titular town from //Societown//, populated by a large number of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-francis Alucinari-class] entities[[footnote]][DATA EXPUNGED][[/footnote]] that vary wildly in appearance, collectively referred to as SCP-8060-B. Some SCP-8060-B entities have been reported to resemble characters from //Societown//, although most others recorded differ unpredictably in appearance and behavior. Further information regarding SCP-8060-B instances is difficult to conclude.[[footnote]]As is typical of most Alucinari-class entities, which occupy a broad and irrational category.[[/footnote]]\n\nEvents and processes transpiring within SCP-8060-A are poorly understood, as almost all data is in the form of personal accounts from subjects who have returned. Records from within SCP-8060-A are distorted and manipulated by unknown means and to an unknown extent, although not to the point of unintelligibility.\n\nSubjects having exited SCP-8060-A are typically left with lasting psychological and biological alterations, which can vary in severity and visibility. This has been noted to cause difficulty for some subjects to properly communicate the information they learned or gathered while within SCP-8060-A. The log below contains a few examples of alterations, aligned from least to most severe. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Alteration Example Log\" hide=\"- Alteration Example Log\"]]\n\n||~ Subject ||~ Effects ||~ Researcher Notes ||\n||D-1711||D-1711 was recovered with two metallic growths upon his head, resembling television antenna. An X-ray scan concluded that the antenna were protruding through the skull. Aside from annoyance that the antenna \"didn't work here\", D-1711 was otherwise psychologically stable. D-1711 described his experience within SCP-8060-A as \"riveting\".||//I asked D-1711 to elaborate on what he meant by the antenna not working. All he said to me was that he was \"not about to explain how antennas work to a bunch of scientists\". Smartass.//||\n||D-6921||D-6921 exited SCP-8060-A gagging and nearly suffocating, and regurgitated a grossly distended and discolored eyeball that burst on the ground into bright green, rapidly sublimating fluid. Afterwards, D-6921 gave a thumbs up gesture. Ultrasound imaging revealed several foreign objects[[footnote]]Examples include an unbranded bag of potato chips, an undigested hamburger, intravenous syringes, sour gummy worms, and a pornographic magazine.[[/footnote]] embedded in the subject's internal organs, as well as heavily saturated viscera. D-6921 also expresses an acute fear of \"magic\", which intensifies when presented with fantasy iconography.||//I passed by his chamber yesterday, and I could hear him muttering some sick shit under his breath. Not sure I'm comfortable repeating it here. I'm fairly baffled, considering this anomaly is entwined with a children's show.//||\n||D-1121||D-1121 appeared physically and psychologically unchanged[[footnote]]Aside from the expected, temporary reaction to the experience.[[/footnote]] after exiting SCP-8060-A. However, it became evident afterward that her appearance was gradually changing at a rate that, while imperceptible, was still much faster than human biology would permit. This process seems to be significantly accelerated when D-1121 is not visually observed. D-1121 typically maintains a general resemblance to her initial appearance prior to entering SCP-8060-A. However, on some rare occasions, she spontaneously gains or entirely loses facial features or extremities, or develops severely distorted proportions. These incidents do not last more than several milliseconds before reverting to a conventional body structure.||//We have an image of her with her eyes misaligned, an image of her holding up seven fingers, we even have one where she looks like a smear on the camera. And yet, when we show her, she recognizes herself every time. We're not sure if she's in denial or if something's up with her head. I figure the latter.//||\n||D-1202||D-1202 exited SCP-8060-A with no physical differences, aside from small specks of acrylic paint on her jumpsuit. However, D-1202 began to display uncharacteristically considerate and sociable behavior. It should be noted that D-1202 was found guilty of [DATA EXPUNGED] before being taken into Foundation custody, and was incredibly reclusive and hostile to Foundation staff before this change in behavior. When asked, D-1202 claimed to have \"learned a valuable lesson\". Said \"lesson\" is different every time D-1202 is asked to elaborate.||//Knowing what she's done, I don't think she deserves a second chance. That being said, she was one of the few that was able to actually give us some new information regarding SCP-8060. Apparently, they managed to get Gilbert Gottfried as a guest star. We still don't know for what character though. Fantastic.//||\n||D-8321||D-8321 returned from SCP-8060-A demonstrating intense projected synesthesia and visual agnosia, rendering her incapable of distinguishing different objects or even different types of environmental stimulus. D-8321 no longer responds to human speech or writing, and is usually unaware of the presence of other human beings. The subject frequently appears confused about their surroundings, even after several weeks, but almost never alarmed or upset.||//The lady was very conversated with a candle. Fresh linen scented.  It's the reason why we were even able to get any information out of her. She called that candle \"Caulfield\". Couldn't help but be reminded of that Cast Away flick from the 2000s, the way she was so invested in her discussion.//||\n||D-321||D-321 is unresponsive, being host to an Alucinari-class entity referring to itself as \"Fuzznuzz\". Fuzznuzz currently manifests as a pair of plastic googly eyes stuck upon D-321's eye sockets, along with a diffuse mass of colorful pipe cleaners entangled around and constricting the subjects brain. It is unclear how D-321's brain has not yet hemorrhaged from the pressure inflicted by the pipe cleaners. Fuzznuzz is manic and unstable, throwing tantrums when not granted access to art supplies. SCP classification is pending.||//Don't accept any gifts from that thing.//||\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nMost subjects vocally reflect on their experience within SCP-8060-A positively, even if evidence suggests otherwise. Common descriptors of what transpires within SCP-8060-A involve an \"adventure\" or \"quest\" for the information the subject entered in search of. Further elaboration eventually devolves into nonsensical rambling. \n\nWhen a subject returns from SCP-8060-A and is capable of reporting newly-discovered information relating to SCP-8060, that information is no longer subject to SCP-8060's anomalous effects, and will not cause any anomalous incidents if directly or indirectly conveyed to other individuals. A full list of recovered information regarding SCP-8060 may be granted upon request.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8060/robert.jpg\n|caption=Robert Louis Arnold. \n|align=right\n|width=300px\n]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8060 was first brought to the attention of the Foundation through the activity of Robert Louis Arnold[[footnote]]Known online under the name SnoopysDoghouse100.[[/footnote]], who was reported missing by his family on April 19th, 2021. Arnold had run a moderately successful online video channel centered on reviewing and discussing children's animation, and released a video titled \"The Societown Finale Is Not Gone\" three days before his disappearance.\n\nThis video was superficially notable for being posted outside of Arnold's typical schedule, being several times longer than Arnold's other published videos, and for its unusual style: Arnold was erratic and appeared to be in poor health, and the video seemed to be both unscripted and unedited. \n\nIn the video, Arnold presents evidence for the current existence of complete copies of \"Acceptance & Saying Goodbye\", and explains his process of collecting that evidence. Researcher Rowan Raster, of Site-433, was unable to reproduce Arnold's steps, as many of his sources of information did not appear to exist, but during the investigation he inadvertently activated the anomalous properties of SCP-8060. Upon discovering this, Raster disengaged[[footnote]]For that time (see Incident 8060-ALC).[[/footnote]] and documented the anomalous characteristics.\n\nTo date, 19 disappearances have been conclusively linked to SCP-8060, with the majority of cases being individuals involved in \"lost media\" communities. Two members of production staff at Sputnik Studios, Horris Curmen[[footnote]]Voice actor[[/footnote]] and Della Mornt[[footnote]]Editor[[/footnote]], have been missing since the production of //Societown// was completed. All other members of production staff associated with //Societown// are accounted for, and demonstrate no anomalous properties or symptoms. It is currently unknown why the disappearances of Curmen and Mornt were never formally reported.\n\n||= [[size large]][http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8060/offset/1 ATTENTION: THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION IS RESTRICTED TO SITE-433 STAFF][[/size]]||\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
