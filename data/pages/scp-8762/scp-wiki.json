SCP-8762 is permitted to request activities to maintain its morale. However, any activities posing potential harm to SCP-8762 are to be denied.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name= http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/troutmaskreplica-normal/guy.JPG\n|caption=SCP-8762\n|width=200px\n|align=right]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-8762 is a --middle aged-- man of indeterminate age who identifies himself as \"Steve\".[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]SCP-8762 has responded to a variety of names, including, but not limited to; Hubert, Larry, John, Bob, and Juggletron.[[/span]] No records of SCP-8762 exist in any known country, region, or sovereign state. Physically, SCP-8762 is non-anomalous and has the same physiological requirements as typical humans.\n\nSCP-8762 has one noticeable, yet extremely potent anomalous effect: whenever SCP-8762 is within close proximity of any anomalous location or object, their abilities will temporarily cease; the reason behind this is currently unknown. Anomalous personnel will remain conscious, although any abilities will cease until SCP-8762 exits the anomalies proximity. SCP-8762 must be awake, conscious, and in a healthy mental state for this to occur. [[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Although entering REM sleep doesn't negate this effect, medically induced comas appear to do so.[[/span]]\n\nSCP-8762 was first discovered at Site-01. Camera footage showed SCP-8762 wandering through the hallways for fifteen minutes, appearing extremely confused. After being noticed by several security guards, SCP-8762 was detained and interviewed. Extensive testing revealed that SCP-8762 was not associated with any known group of interest.\n\nSCP-8762 emits no Humes, Akiva radiation, or any forms of anomalous energy, thereby eliminating the possibility of it being a weapon. After it temporarily neutralized SCP-001, it was designated as SCP-8762.\n\nBelow is an interview log between SCP-8762 and Foundation researcher Elizabeth Carter.\n\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Elizabeth Carter\n> @@ @@\n> **Interviewee:** SCP-8762\n> @@ @@\n> ----\n> [[=]]\n> **BEGIN LOG**\n> [[/=]]\n> ----\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Carter:** Good afternoon Steve, hope everything is going well with you.\n> @@ @@\n> **SCP-8762:** It's going.\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Carter:** Excellent.

SCP-8762's sex is currently unknown, as all biological scans give mixed results. When asked, it replied with \"I'm John.\"\n\n> **Test 13**\n> **Anomaly:** [[[SCP-6914]]], a small sign that says \"KEEP OFF GRASS\". If individuals step on grass located near SCP-6914, they will then be struck by lightning.\n> **Results:** SCP-8762 proceeded to step on the grass with no issues, although later stated that it felt \"a bit inconsiderate.\"\n\n> **Test 44**\n> **Anomaly:** SCP-173\n> **Results:** Initially, SCP-8762 stood within the same room as SCP-173 and did not report any findings. Shortly afterwards, however, personnel report a mild swelling in SCP-8762's face, which it attributed to \"a mild peanut allergy\".[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]SCP-8762 had no known allergies, nor has it eaten any peanuts.[[/span]]@@ @@ Moments later, SCP-8762 spontaneously combusted.\n\nFollowing its untimely death, personnel discovered that its remains still shared the same properties as the anomaly itself. Lead theories suggest that SCP-8762 \"absorbed\" the properties of other anomalies. Because of this, smaller fragments of it are still capable of weakening anomalous effects. Following research, a new, revised file for SCP-8762 is available below.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"View revision?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Description:** SCP-8762 is the prototype known as the \"Scranton Reality Anchor\".\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8761]]] | SCP-8762 | [[[SCP-8763]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** guy.JPG\n> **Name:** Mikhail Yershov 5\n> **Author:** Andrey Yefimov\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mikhail_Yershov_5.JPG\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
