We was laughin', talkin', drinking and eating, overall very merry. Then like Little Miss Muffet, this large spider comes outta nowhere and crawls on my hand. Scared the tits off all the girls, and even summa the fellas there. I just sat there, all calm n' collected, didn't even seem to mind. Spider was nearly the size of my hand, too, but it weren't engaging or nothin', just sittin' there, peaceful-like. I decided to lift my hand up and show off my new chum to everyone in the group. //(laughs)// Rightly scared the piss outta them! I let the little fella go and just sat there grinning. Someone asked me, \"Weren't you afraid, Lew?\", and I said, \"Course' not! What do I have to be afraid of?\"\n\nThen I went all philosophical on them. I said, “If you shut your eyes to a frightening sight, you end up being frightened. If you look at everything straight on, there is nothing to be afraid of.” //(laughs)// I told em' it was a quote from Rowan Atkinson, and they looked at me like I had just eaten a rhinoceros.

I've been pondering that. Not in the normal way, more like...why we justify our actions. Why we can say to ourselves, \"Well, I am doing something bad, but something better might come of it, or at least something less worse.\"\n\n**Sarasvati:**  Oh dear, isn't that a minefield. Especially in our line of work.\n\n**Eames:**  You ain't joshin'. The Foundation's perfectly fine marchin' D-class in front o' monsters and alternate dimensions if it gets them knowledge. \"Kill one fella to save three\", or rather, \"Die in the dark so you can live in the light\". But it goes beyond that. Sites get blown up and Overseers shrug. Whole cities get wiped out and the boss says \"It could've been worse\". Sometimes I think they'd be willing to put a cap in humanity itself if there was [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5000|a big enough bullet]]] comin' their way. Makes my request for a handful of D-class seem rather insignificant.\n\n**Sarasvati:**  And you're saying that, by giving themselves permission to commit these so-called atrocities, they free themselves from moral shackles?\n\n**Eames:**  Rightly so. And it's universal, too, specially in religion. \"Our god said this was fine, so despite us commitin' genocide, or tossin' babies into a fire, or throwing rocks at a homosexual, or fornicating with our daughters, or amassin' slaves, god's in his heaven, so all's right with the world\". And that makes it fine.\n\n**Sarasvati:**  I've been pondering something of a similar nature.\n\n**Eames:**  Oh?\n\n**Sarasvati:**  Specifically, the attraction of evil. Why performing duplicitous actions gives us pleasure. Even the mere thought of evil, of \"being bad\", is inherently more attractive than being a \"goody two-shoes\". Can you imagine? Making goodness derogatory?\n\n**Eames:**  Yeah, the human fascination with evil's banged around my head a couple of times in the past. I think it goes hand-in-hand with confronting it. Like, once it's out in the open, naked, we want to turn away, but some primal part of ourselves is drawn to it. Like holding up traffic just so you can gawk at a car crash. Once we get over our fear, we come to...accept it. Embrace it. Even justify it.\n\n**Sarasvati:**  The gruesome and painful being comparable, even preferable, to beauty and pleasure.\n\n**Eames:**  Exactly.
