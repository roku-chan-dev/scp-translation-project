The item is to be placed within a sound-proof container in order to minimize distractions to nearby personnel. Access to the item is restricted to any personnel of Level 2 security clearance or higher. Personnel of Level 1 clearance or lower must receive written permission by Dr. Beck, head of SCP-3556 research, to handle SCP-3556.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3556 is a yellow adhesive note pad, measuring 2.5 cm by 5 cm, depicting a crude drawing of an unknown creature with the word “Durbal” being written near the drawing. \n\nPlacing SCP-3556 on any object will cause the drawing to animate and vocalize any flaws the anomaly perceives of the item it is placed upon. SCP-3556's criticisms will become increasingly illogical the longer it remains on an object, eventually going off topic and become tangentially unrelated to the item it was affixed to. SCP-3556 has only been recorded speaking English. It is theorized that SCP-3556 is sentient, though it has refused to cooperate during attempted interviews.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum-3556-1: Experiment Log\" hide=\"Close Addendum-3556-1\"]]\nThe following are a series of transcripts recorded from experiments using SCP-3556.\n\n> **Foreword:** Object was placed on a cracked mirror.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3556:** Mirror is obviously cracked intentionally. \n> If left untreated, may result in total mirror failure. \n> Mirror is slightly smudged due to clumsy workers.\n> Mirror is even more smudged by me.\n> Mirror does not correctly reflect light as human eyes see it. \n> Mirror is not a true mirror. \n> Mirror absorbs a small amount of green light upon reflection. \n> Mirror is a cheating mirror that steals people’s hard earned light and deserves to serve 30 years in prison for stealing light. \n> Mirror may also be given the death penalty in several jurisdictions, and frankly deserves it. \n> Mirror is scum of the Earth...\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** //The unedited audio files all amount to approximately 33 days of audio. The remainder of this transcript was cut for the sake of brevity. SCP-3556 may be capable of following an infinite number of tangents in its rants.// -Dr. Beck\n\n> **Foreword:** Object was placed on a file containing multiple documents. All documents consisted of untrue facts.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3556:** File is an inadequate way to store data, considering the rise of digital data. \n> Data contained within file is false. \n> First page states frogs are mammals. \n> Frogs are amphibians. \n> Amphibians are both fish and mammals. \n> Frogs are indecisive in their place in the animal kingdom. \n> Second page states computers emit sugary liquids. \n> Computer technology is yet to reach the state of sugary liquid emission. \n> Sugary liquids cause diabetes, heart disease, obesity…\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** //The remainder of this transcript was cut for the sake of brevity. It appears SCP-3556 is able to criticize the contents of media, not just the media itself.// -Dr. Beck\n\n> **Foreword:** D-8913 was instructed to hold SCP-3556. D-8913 had their left arm amputated at birth. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3556:** D-8913 is missing an arm. \n> D-8913’s arm was removed because she is genetically inferior to other human organisms. \n> D-8913 lacks confidence. \n> D-8913 swears too much. \n> D-8913 wears terrible orange jumpsuits because she lacks confidence. \n> D-8913 wears glasses because her eyes were screwed up by staring at a TV too much.\n> D-8913 dyes her hair to forget about the fact their hair is ugly and boring. \n> D-8913 hates legitimate criticism. \n> D-8913 doesn’t know how she gets into terrible situations and chooses to blame those around her. \n> D-8913 has a terrible relationship with her mother. \n> D-8913 has committed murder and deserves to be here. \n> D-8913 is a terrible singer and can’t take a hint that she is a terrible singer. \n> D-8913 listens to Korean pop music, which is the worst kind of music.\n> D-8913’s voice is literally incapable of sounding good in any circumstance.\n> D-8913 has anger management problems.\n> D-8913 hates pape-\n> \n> //D-8913 placed SCP-3556 on a nearby wall and attempted to leave the testing chamber. D-8913 refused to comply with further testing orders.//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n> **Foreword:** Dr. Beck was instructed to hold SCP-3556. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3556:** Jim Cyrus Beck does not have children, and as such is an evolutionary failure. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck does not want children because he doesn’t want to become like his father. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck is also incapable of having children due to his erectile dysfunction. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck does not realize he is already like his father. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck drinks an entire beer once he gets home from work, like his father. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck fails to please his significant other both sexually and romantically, like his father. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck hates his job and regularly questions why he hasn’t quit. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck is allergic to bees. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck cannot become a bee farmer. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck is also allergic to honey. \n> Jim Cyrus Beck can never affiliate himself with any bees of any k-\n> \n> //Dr. Beck set down SCP-3556.//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n> **Foreword:** SCP-3556 was presented with SCP-3556’s file.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-3556:** I am perfect in every way.
