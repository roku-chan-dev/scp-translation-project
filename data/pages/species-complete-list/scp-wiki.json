The endothecia of its seeds are highly resistant to fire and toxic chemical agents. The seeds can germinate under adverse conditions, even without the need for water or other nutrients, and at the time of the free nuclei phase, approximately 500 mSv are released into the environment within a radius of 20 meters, thus facilitating the development and growth of other seeds.\n\nIf the seeds are ingested by an animal, they will pseudo-germinate inside the organism and enter into a symbiotic relationship, where the plant will serve as protection with its branches and leaves: The epidermal cells will form cell walls, conferring the same capacity of resistance to damage and emission of ionizing radiation; however, their mobility is highly reduced, they lose their ability to vocalize and are usually in a period of prolonged inactivity.\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hub-sueno-nuclear Nuclear Dream Hub]\n* [[[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/kte-2272-hogweed-van-allen-viridi |KTE-2272-Hogweed-Van Allen-Viridi]]] (untranslated)\n\n**Mushroom (留音蕈)** \n**Scientific Name:** //Poculumfungus phonograph//\n* [[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/poculumfungus-phonograph |Mushroom]]] (untranslated)\n\n**Red lotus** \n**Scientific Name:** //Nelumbo amnesia//\n* [[[http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/scp-174-it |SCP-174-IT]]] - Beyond the Cloud Route (untranslated)\n\n**SCP-307 (Spider Ivy)**\n* [[[SCP-307]]] - Carnivorous Ivy\n\n**Zingiber officinale**\n**Scientific Name:** //Pseudozingiber sinensis//\n* [[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-cn-1616 |SCP-CN-1616]]] - Chinese Ginger (untranslated)\n\n**SCP-4547-C1**\nOne of the many xenoplants on Mo'ara was SCP-4547-C1, a now extinct xenoplant species that formerly possessed sapience and psionic abilities.
