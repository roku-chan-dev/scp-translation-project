These items are able to be removed from the extradimensional space, given that they are physically able to fit through the wormhole. Testing has concluded that SCP-4051 is unable to alter the contents of the extradimensional space after manifestation.\n\nSCP-4051 has been able to manifest the following items during controlled experiments overseen by Dr. Edwards at Site-17. Manifested items detailed in the relevant experiment logs below have been omitted.\n\n* A small, weighted net, measuring 3 m^^2^^.\n* A standard pharmaceutical container of sugar pills, although the label describes the pills as headache medication.\n* A glass of drinking water.\n\nSCP-4051 has either claimed or has been reported to have manifested the following items outside of experiments sanctioned by Dr. Edwards.\n\n* An aluminum baseball bat.\n* Several rolls of duct tape.\n* An incendiary device and blast-proof sheet.\n* Eleven instances of Class-E paracognitohazards.\n\n--SCP-4051 has been allowed to use its anomalous abilities to assist with general repairs at Site-17.-- After retroactive review of all procedures and programs relating to SCP-4051's containment by the Ethics Committee and subsequent evaluation by the Foundation Containment Committee, SCP-4051's presence outside of its containment unit has been demonstrated to be a substantial threat to any and all personnel located at Site-17.\n\n**Recovery:** SCP-4051 was first brought to the attention of Foundation operatives in August of 2012 when a video depicting it using its anomalous abilities began to gain significant online attention. The recording depicted SCP-4051 assaulting and detaining several men via its anomalous abilities.\n\nThe video gained over two million views before warranting an intervention, following multiple testimonies by commenters of similar occurrences.

Requests for an object of its choice resulted in SCP-4051 removing a framed picture of its mother. SCP-4051 expressed discomfort at being requested to remove the bleach but complied without incident.\n\n**Afterword:** SCP-4051 was escorted back to its containment unit and reportedly asked how long it would need to test its anomalous properties.

Most pages of the book contained redundant gibberish tangentially related to war, and SCP-4051 confessed that it was unfamiliar with the contents of the novel.\n\nThe mobile phone that was manifested appeared to be unremarkable until attempts were made to operate it, and it was revealed to be completely hollow.\n\n**Afterword:** As SCP-4051 was being escorted back to its containment unit, it asked repeatedly how its family was, and if it could have any company as it waited for the next test. All questions were ignored by the escort team.\n\n------\n\n> **Note:** Test suggests that SCP-4051's anomaly is based on how much it understands about the object?

After this test, provided no new developments occur, we will begin to investigate how your anomaly functions on a scientific level.\n\n**SCP-4051:** Are you sure?

That being said, we've concluded that it would be beneficial for Site-17 as a whole to work to better understand SCP-4051's capabilities. Multiple options are being discussed, such as using it to assist in standard repairs and maintenance, but certain influential individuals have also proposed using it to produce more valuable materials.\n\nI'd wager that most of you don't have the clearance level to know how we produce our amnestics, but suffice it to say that the procedures range from [[[SCP-3171 |  potentially unethical]]] to [[[SCP-3000 | extremely dangerous]]] and [[[SCP-2419 | costly]]]. The Ethics Committee has taken a particular interest in SCP-4051 and are discussing using it to produce the active #Y-909 agent in amnestics. As such, Dr. Edwards has been given authority as Project Director over all experimentation and research regarding SCP-4051.\n\nAll of this can only be accomplished if SCP-4051 is compliant with Foundation procedure. Anything less than absolute dedication to the Foundation will mean that SCP-4051 is not ready to assist in our directive. To accomplish this, we will begin using standard punishments and rewards to promote good behavior, and scheduled weekly sessions with an on-site therapist, Dr. Yesenia.\n\nAll personnel assigned to directly interact with SCP-4051 have been sent a copy of the updated containment procedures and other relevant materials.

The session is uneventful. ||\n|| 10/18/2012 || Dr. Yesenia requests information regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. Request is denied due to Dr. Yesenia's inadequate clearance level. ||\n|| 11/02/2012 || Dr. Edwards announces to Site Director Graham that Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN has produced a sufficient amount of data, such that a design for Project 350-JANUS should be proposed. ||\n|| 11/07/2012 || A design for Project 350-JANUS is finalized. ||\n|| 11/21/2012 || Site-17 experiences a site-wide containment breach. By chance, ██ instances of SCP-████-█ make contact with SCP-4051 while it is performing its weekly maintenance. The instances initially overwhelm attending armed personnel but are turned back by SCP-4051 when it manifests \"fire\", which produces a flame constantly emitting from the open wormhole. SCP-4051 is able to aim the fire at the SCP-████-█ instances and terminate ██ before attending personnel are able to incapacitate it and retreat to a safe location. ||\n|| 11/28/2012 || Dr. Yesenia is ordered to verbally reprimand SCP-4051 for its unauthorized manifestation of an object during the containment breach the previous week. Dr. Yesenia complies, and SCP-4051 is not allowed to participate in any maintenance sessions for two months. ||\n|| 02/07/2013 || SCP-4051 celebrates its first birthday in Foundation custody. Dr. Yesenia's original gift proposal of a treadmill, to be placed inside SCP-4051's cell for its entertainment, is rejected by Dr. Edwards. Dr. Yesenia's following proposal, a portable chess set, is accepted. ||\n|| 02/28/2013 || SCP-4051 aids in the recontainment of SCP-████ from its containment unit, manifesting 20 m^^3^^ of methoxyflurane and incapacitating it. ||\n|| 03/03/2013 || A prototype of Project 350-JANUS is constructed. Testing confirms that the device is non-operational. Dr. Edwards is informed of the need for more data regarding SCP-4051's anomaly. ||\n|| 03/04/2013 || Dr. Edwards requests a replacement of the incision tool used in Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN, which had become extensively damaged by unknown means. ||\n|| 04/10/2013 || Project 350-JANUS continues to produce ████████████ instead of the requested object. Dr. Edwards is given full control over the project to ensure its success. ||\n|| 04/12/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests a review by the Ethics Committee regarding Procedure 350-PROMETHEAN. The request is denied. ||\n|| 04/27/2013 || During a standard weekly maintenance session, SCP-4051 is hurt by a falling lead beam. Attending personnel request medical attention, and SCP-4051 asks permission to manifest various bandages for its wound. The request is granted. ||\n|| 05/16/2013 || Dr. Yesenia requests access to SCP-4051's medical file and is reminded of her inadequate clearance level. The request is denied. ||\n|| 05/23/2013 || [DATA EXPUNGED BY ORDER OF THE ETHICS COMMITTEE] ||\n|| 05/25/2013 || Project 350-JANUS successfully manifests a requested object. The machine malfunctions immediately after the manifestation, rendering it non-operable. ||\n\n**Addendum.4051.6:** [INVALID INPUT]\n\n[[include :topia:kaktus-header |head=BY%20ORDER%20OF%20THE%20OVERSEER%20COUNCIL|desc=The%20following%20reports%20are%20Level%204%2F4051%20classified.%20Unauthorized%20access%20is%20forbidden.%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fbr%3E%3Cbr%3E%3C%2Fbr%3E%3Cb%3E%3Cspan%20style%3D%22color%3A%20red%3B%22%3EFAILURE%20TO%20COMPLY%20WILL%20RESULT%20IN%20IMMEDIATE%20TERMINATION%20VIA%20LATENT%20%22BLUE-ORDER%22%20MEMETIC%20KILL%20AGENT%3C%2Fspan%3E%3C%2Fb%3E|num=4051]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[[The Beast Beneath The Library | {INPUT 4/4051 CLEARANCE}]]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\" style=\"margin-top: 50px\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-4050]]] | SCP-4051 | [[[SCP-4052]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
