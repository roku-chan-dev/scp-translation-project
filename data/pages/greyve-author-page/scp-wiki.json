It's a one-off article with a lot of wordplay about a deflated balloon dog. I wouldn't be surprised if the joke blows over your head. How it came about, I have no clue, but I got a lot of inspiration from this brilliant YouTube channel, [*https://www.youtube.com/user/filmnwar NWAR]. Since it was my first time writing, and I really wanted to make it stick, I spent a lot of time checking out other SCPs for inspiration and formatting ideas. I'm particularly happy with the email transcripts thing, which are based on the iOS Mail app, since I wrote SCP-4937 on my school iPad.\n\nOverall, I don't know what to think of it, but...it's a start, I guess.\n\nOh yeah, also, this was my first article to be translated. Thanks to [[*user Xiao Tian]] for approaching me about that. Check it out [*http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-4937 here], if you can read Chinese. He did an incredible job with the puns and stuff.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5117\"]]\n[[[SCP-5117|SCP-5117 - Alex?

This is what I consider my actual first SCP. It's executed much better, that's for certain, especially with the cleaner formatting from djkaktus' themes and ACS.\n\nSCP-5117 is based on a single throwaway line from a response to an [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/t-10288854/to-your-hearts-context old idea pitch], but I somehow managed to work it into a relatively cohesive and emotional article. I spent a really, really, //really// long time on this one and had no expectations as to how well it would do. Huge thanks to all the invaluable help with getting this out there especially from [[*user HammerMaiden]].\n\nSpeaking of the story, it's sort of personal, since my best friend and I talked less and less. Funny enough, I'm probably more of the Noah. On the other hand, I'm still in high school as of writing, and I have absolutely no experience with relationships, so... I suppose I have no clue how I managed to characterize Noah...\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5103\"]]\n[[[SCP-5103|SCP-5103 - The Spiral's Axis]]] (##green|+%%rating%%##, ##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[size 80%]]##grey|//%%created_at%%//##[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nits really begging for a rewrite lol\n\nThis one started out as a really ambitious SCP-001 proposal, but I chickened out at the last second and posted it as SCP-5103. No clue how it would have fared there, but, then again, I am my own harshest critic.\n\nSCP-5103 is sort of about what makes reality //real//. If you're confused about what's happening, I totally get it. I lost myself in the idea about halfway through, too. After all, it does have a lot going on: pattern screamers, reality distortions, Scranton Reality Anchors, and time travel, oh my! I was even going to have some Church of the Second Hytoth stuff, too, since it just made perfect sense, but I ended up cutting it since I felt like it weakened the narrative.\n\nWhat? You want an actual interpretation?\n\nOh, fine.\n\nSCP-5103 is a machine that was created by humans to allow reality to make sense. As in, human discoveries, such as math and science, only because the universe is generated based on those principles, through a machine, created by humanity. Now the machine itself exists outside of time, but it experiences linear flow in segments. Each segment is the birth and death of an entire universe, and there are three active segments at any given time: a dying universe, a living universe, and an unborn universe. When the dying universe dies, the living universe becomes the dying universe as the unborn universe is born, and starts draining realness from the formerly living universe, while a new developing universe begins to form. Each of the three pages represents one of these universe: the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5103 main page] is the living universe, the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:scp-5103-1 first fragment] is the dead universe, and the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fragment:scp-5103-2 second fragment] is the unborn universe.\n\nAnd Vera? Vera, what has become of her?\n\nWell, she was trapped outside of her reality when it died, meaning she is nonexistent. She didn't die with her reality, but she also didn't disappear completely, since time doesn't exist inside of SCP-5103. So she exists in a space outside of existence. She is a pattern screamer. Actually, she is //every// pattern screamer; this cycle has happened before, and the past renditions of Vera are every pattern screamer, ever.\n\nEnd interpretation.\n\nI designed the Zurvan Esoteric Class symbol based off of the idea; the left circle (dying universe) feeds into the middle circle (living universe), positioned over a spiral structure (SCP-5103) and feeds into a third, closed circle (unborn universe). Zurvan itself is the central deity of Zurvanism, where it represents infinite time and space, or oneness, which perfectly applied itself to SCP-5103, along with its visual representation.\n\nBy the way, if any Ortothan writers feel like it, please reference it. It would make my day!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5880\"]]\n[[[SCP-5880|SCP-5880 - Praise Unto the Glorious Influenza, the Great and Contagious Religious Influenza]]] (##green|+%%rating%%##, ##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[size 80%]]##grey|//%%created_at%%//##[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nProbably my only comedy article that actually has legs. Heavily inspired by [[[SCP-5320]]], which itself is...quite a trip.\n\nThe actual bulk of the article is, of course, the reports and the extraction log, both of which I tried to pump full of Greyve Comedy™, with varying degrees of success. I think in general, SCP-5880 is a pretty intuitive article that flows really well, has good writing, and overall is a fun read. In fact, I'd go as far as to say it's better than anything before it in terms of raw enjoyment. After all, most of my humor falls flat, and everything else will overload your brain.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5309\"]]\n[[[SCP-5309|SCP-5309 is not to exist.]]] (##green|+%%rating%%##, ##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[size 80%]]##grey|//%%created_at%%//##[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nProbably the best thing I've written, to date.\n\nI'll probably do a declassified on this one day or another, but for now, just know that it is very, very meta.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5932\"]]\n[[[SCP-5932|SCP-5932 - MTFinity]]] (##green|+%%rating%%##, ##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[size 80%]]##grey|//%%created_at%%//##[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nMy first attempt at body horror, this started out as a throwaway idea and evolved into an exploration of identity and death. It does get quite melodramatic at times, and there's certainly some degree of self-indulgence, but I do still think there's thematic merit and I definitely consider this some of my better work.\n\nSide note, there's two references to songs from //Absolution// by Muse.

This is the end result!\n\nThe article itself is another \"Cold, not Cruel\" article, based around an idea originally formulated by Mew. The first draft looked very, very different, and was much, much shorter. After a lot of invaluable advice from IRC critters, we managed to refine it into a beautiful story about a tired Overseer who made a promise to a dying patient and misses her daughter. It's honestly some of my best work, no doubt thanks to Mew's continuous support.\n\nOverall, this was a thoroughly fun experience, and I'd say that the product is pretty rewarding, too!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5712\"]]\n[[[SCP-5712|SCP-5712 -Associated with Demons, Memes, and Supercomputers]]]  with [[*user Iapetus The Acausal]] (##green|+%%rating%%##, ##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[size 80%]]##grey|//%%created_at%%//##[[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nFor corpsecon.

I've never been particularly creative, so I really have to thank my coauthor for including a one-off line about exorcism and battery acid to give me a direction to take this.\n\nTo be honest, I'm not sure if I edited the conprocs too much to still qualify as a proper exquisite corpse, but at any rate, at least I wrote something good!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab Other Stuff]]\n++* Other Stuff\n\nMiscellaneous stuff.\n-----\n[[[Greyve Art Page]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼ Commentary\" hide=\"▲ Close\"]]\nMostly icons.
