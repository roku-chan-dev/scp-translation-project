The physical framework of NTE-2858 is believed to be an advanced mechanical prototype, commenced in 1863 and linked with Babbage's consciousness following his physical death.\n\nNTE-2858 has two processing modules, each comprised of exactly 4,000 components, for a combined weight of five tons. When fully assembled, these modules are 2.1 meters tall, 3.4 meters long, and 45.7 centimeters deep (7 feet by 11 feet by 18 inches).\n\nNTE-2858's third module is a standing brass wheel, 45.7 centimeters (18 inches) in diameter, fitted with an ectoplasmic containment vessel. NTE-2858 communicates by spinning rotary dials inscribed with the full Latin alphabet (including various modifiers), Arabic numerals, punctuation, and mathematical operators. This mode of articulation is similar to a seance conducted with spirit board and planchette; however, NTE-2858 is capable of detecting auditory stimuli and does not require a living interpreter.\n\nNTE-2858 communicates at an average of 6-10 characters per second (72-120 words per minute, or 360-600 RPM), which is difficult for the average observer to understand. To compensate, project engineers fitted NTE-2858's dialing system with cylindrical typewheels, which parse raw output into printed words.\n\nWhen the articulation terminal is physically linked to both processing modules and provided appropriate power sources, NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca is capable of calculating and implementing advanced thaumaturgical workings. These operations were designed to control the axial rotation of rogue asteroid 8837 London[[footnote]] First observed in 1856 by Sir George Biddell Airy, 8837 London is 2.4 kilometers in diameter and orbits 1.95-2.5 astronomical units (AU) from our sun, in the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter. [[/footnote]] via ectoplasmic manipulation, creating artificial gravity appropriate for human habitation. For more information, see **PSYCHE Historical Records**.\n\n[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]\n\nPursuant to the Kitchener Accords of 1953, NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca will remain in the custody of the Global Occult Coalition. Both processing modules will be disassembled and placed in adjacent storage when not in use.\n\nIn the event that 8837 London requires axial adjustment, NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca will be reassembled, integrated with an Everhart Resonator, and given time to calculate the parameters of corrective working. These formulae will be handed over to the International Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology (ICSUT), who will implement the working using [[[scp-2176|ectoplasm]]] sourced from a vendor of record.\n\nIf NTE-2858 diverges from the above parameters, the Resonator should be powered down immediately. If the Resonator cannot be powered down by conventional means, NTE-2858 will be temporarily re-designated **ARL: ##red|2## (Sub Moderate Threat, Physical Response)** until such time that the situation is resolved.\n\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PSYCHE Historical Records\n\nThe following files represent the GOC's historical intelligence regarding NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca prior to 1945. Over the past seventy years, these documents were transferred between several institutions; as a result, many records are missing, degraded, or incomplete.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=airy.jpg\n| caption=Sir George Biddell Airy, 1883.\n| width=30%\n| align=right]]\n\n++ Origin\nBefore 1909, matters related to anomalous research, diplomacy and containment in the British Empire were handled by a loose network of Crown corporations and appointees. One such official was Sir George Biddell Airy (1801-1892), an English mathematician who served as Astronomer Royal between 1835 and 1881. In this capacity, Sir Airy managed the Royal Observatory at Greenwich, London, established the Greenwich Meridian as a global reference point, and negotiated human colonization of asteroid 8837 London.\n\nFollowing his death in 1892, many of Sir Airy's papers were mistakenly divided among his heirs. The files below were recovered by the Crown and transferred to the King's Archives between 1912 and 1914.\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**//Journal entry regarding observations at Greenwich, dated 1856.//**\n\nMy good friend Llywelyn visited me at the Observatory this evening! With a twinkle in his eye, he asked me to take up the equatorial telescope, for he had quite a sight to show me. Indeed, he guided me to a celestial body hitherto unknown: a diamond palace in the heavens, where fair folk once held court.\n\nI found his claim quite astonishing. If anyone were to bridge such vast distances and build such marvels, whyever would they surrender them? Llywelyn explained that the heavens were quite inhospitable. Before long, the novelty of weightlessness wore thin, and besides a single collection of books and baubles, his clan abandoned it completely.\n \nSeeing that I was quite taken with this story, Llywelyn offered me the opportunity to give this astral body a proper English name. The choice seemed obvious. After all, we stand at the heart of the British Empire, in a Royal Observatory funded by the grace and wisdom of the Crown! Humbled by this great legacy, I have named the asteroid \"London\", and intend to report as much to Her Royal Highness Queen Victoria forthwith.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**//Official copy of the Astronomer's letter to Charles Babbage, 1862.//**\n\nMy dear Mister Babbage,\n\nIt has been quite some time since we had reason for correspondence. I pray that our past disagreement regarding the utility of mechanical calculators does not weigh heavily on your mind. In fact, I write to you today in the hopes that we can set our history aside and combine our resources towards solving a unique problem.\n\nToday, I spoke with His Royal Highness Albert Edward, Prince of Wales[[footnote]] Crowned King Edward VII in 1901. [[/footnote]], who impressed upon me his concern for loyal subjects in British North America. During his 1860 visit to Ottawa, the Prince met several families dedicated to the Unity of the Empire.[[footnote]] Referring to United Empire Loyalists, a faction of British colonials who fled the United States after the American Revolution and settled in Canadian provinces. [[/footnote]] Speaking in strictest confidence, these men expressed fears that the Americans would seek reprisals for the razing of their White House in 1814; naturally, the Prince assured them that Britain is fully committed to the defense of her colonies.\n\nThis past week, the Prince received a letter reiterating these concerns, further citing the instability of colonial government, animosity between English Protestants and French Catholics, and the [[[scp-2750|brutal conquest of Western territories]]] by the American Secure Containment Initiative. He showed me this letter during our meeting, and I confess that the situation seems quite dire.\n\nMy colleague has proposed a novel solution: bridging the grand spaces between England, the Province of Canada, and a remote asteroid I named \"London\", thus furnishing the colonists with a secure redoubt. According to my good friend Llywelyn, such a thing could be accomplished by opening a Way in the metaphysical shadow of our London Bridge, then linking it to an equivalent structure in Canada and an ancient fey bridge on the asteroid. Since the structure has been abandoned these many centuries, there are no observers who could dispute our new name for the metaphysical territory.\n\nAnchoring this Way will require considerable time and aetheric energy. However, our greatest problem is //gravity//. The asteroid cannot sustain its own gravitation. To create a habitable environment, we must create rotational gravity via centrifugal force.\n\nI have calculated the approximate size and density of 8837 London, but manipulating the asteroid from afar is currently beyond our means. We must devise a method for balancing this equation. In truth, I doubt that your machines will be up to the challenge, but I understand that you are eager for an opportunity to prove me wrong. Suffice it to say that if you can help us solve this problem, the Crown may reconsider funding your calculators.\n\nYours very truly,\nSir George Biddell Airy, KCB\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\nSir Airy:\n\nI read your recent letter with considerable astonishment. After so many years of silence, //you// come to //me// with a problem? To affect the gravitation of a heavenly body, linked to the busiest bridge in Central London? That is bold indeed! Consider my interest piqued, so long as you are willing to fund this grand endeavor.\n\nBear in mind that the work has progressed a great deal since last we spoke. Soon, the calculators you so despise shall be made obsolete by the mighty analytical engine, a general-purpose computation platform more precise than any human agent.\n\nTo that end, I have formed a very fruitful partnership with the Clockwork Communion Church.[[footnote]] An obscure techno-religious sect formed during the Industrial Revolution. Defunct as of 1953. [[/footnote]] Though most clergymen are unfit for scientific pursuits, there are some men of faith -- like Deacon Bell -- determined to advance civilization through the triumph of industrial arts. His loyal fabricators and lay-brothers are masters of tool-making, possessed of a great Protestant work ethic and fully dedicated to their craft. I have no doubts in their precision. I hope that we can meet to discuss terms very soon.\n\nI am, Sir, yours, etc.,\nCharles Babbage\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\nMost splendid. I am pleased to hear it.\n\nMind, I must apologize for my previous laxity of speech. Our Way shall be centered on the //other// London bridge: Blackfriars. A contractor has already been selected to build a similar wrought-iron crossing over the Thames River in Canada.\n\nG.B.H., KCB\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**//Official copy of the Astronomer's letter to Llywelyn y Bychan, dated June 30, 1864.//**\n\nYet again, Mr. Babbage is wasting time on petty grievances. Rather than building his precious calculators, Charles is publicly campaigning against organ-grinders and idle children. During yesterday's debates in the House of Commons, Sir Shelley disparaged him by name! This will not do.\n\nMy friend, I must call upon your particular talents. Please impress upon Mr. Babbage the importance of finishing this project, in no uncertain terms.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**//Excerpted from the Astronomer's letter to Prince Albert Edward, 1871.//**\n\nYour Royal Highness,\n\nI understand and appreciate your concerns regarding the Other London Bridge. Rest assured that Deacon Bell and his engineers are quite capable of finishing the key mechanical components, despite Mr. Babbage's recent passing. In fact, I am quite confident that he will be more useful to us in death than he ever was in life.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n++ Development\n\nStarting in 1909, paranatural affairs in the United Kingdom and Crown colonies were handled by the British Occult Service (BOS, or \"MI666\"). This included the administration of Other London. Records from this era are scarce, but PSYCHE Division has recovered a 1921 briefing packet addressed to higher echelons of BOS bureaucracy.\n\n[[div class=\"mi666\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 2.5em; font-weight: bold; color: #dd6161;\"]]CLASSIFIED: MOST SECRET[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 1.3em; color: darkgrey;\"]]OFFICE OF THE CHIEF OF OCCULT INTELLIGENCE[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 1.3em;\"]]Executive Briefing on \"Other London\"[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n**__HISTORY__**: Other London Bridge opened in 1875. The first settlers took up residence in a vast cavern, two kilometers wide and five kilometers long; there they carved out a river using thaumaturgy, built up fields with fertile soil, raised houses with imported timber, and paved roads with local stone.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=settlement.jpg\n| caption=Artist's rendition of Other London, 1877.\n| width=30%\n| align=right]]\nBy the end of the Sixth Occult War, Other London was a modest town of 678. Today, Other London has 1,012 residents, plus an additional 150 penal subjects.\n\n**__GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE__**:  Local topology is oriented relative to the Other Thames River, which flows from north to south along the inner perimeter of the asteroid. Thus we determine the east and west neighborhoods, respectively known as York (Canadian) and Middlesex (British). Upper-class citizens live on the north end of the colony. Lower-class citizens reside on the south side, closer to their places of work.\n\nOther London's main climate is tuned for short, mild seasons, ranging from lows of 0°C to an average of 10°C and highs of 23°C. Numerous other tunnels and chambers have their own microclimates, some of which are appropriate for agriculture, fungiculture, industrial activity or habitation. For safety and security, these regions are isolated by air-locks.\n\n**__GOVERNMENT__**: The people of Other London are represented by a Town Council. Policies are ratified by the Governor General, who represents the Crown's authority. Since 1909, the office of the Governor General has been held //in absentia// by the Chief of Occult Intelligence.\n\nCivil defense, law enforcement and penal security are all managed by the Other London Garrison, currently commanded by BOS Colonel Royce Campbell.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=england.jpg\n| caption=Blackfriars Bridge, London, England.\n| width=30%\n| align=right]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=ontario.jpg\n| caption=Blackfriars Bridge, London, Ontario.\n| width=30%\n| align=right]]\n\n**__INFRASTRUCTURE__**: Other London Bridge is a pocket dimension that links the Blackfriars Bridge on 8837 London with two points on Earth: the Blackfriars Bridge of London, England, and the Blackfriars Bridge of London, Ontario. To traverse the Way, one need only focus on crossing the \"other\" London Bridge.\n\nThe route is scaled for foot traffic, light carriages, and small boats, which pass along each region's respective Thames. Integrated enchantments ensure that mundane observers perceive inter-dimensional traffic as non-anomalous. Witnesses assume that travelers have gone \"the other way round\", and do not question it further.\n\nThe colony is powered by coal, steam, and hydroelectric energy. Illumination systems include arc lights, mercury-vapor lamps, and luminescent thaumaturgical workings. In residential areas, these systems are staged and timed to emulate a terrestrial day-night cycle. Since 1876, every effort has been made to link occupied areas by telephone, providing consistent means of communication throughout the colony.\n\nOther London's critical infrastructure was developed in partnership with the Clockwork Communion Church. Whereas most techno-religious sects are increasingly hostile towards the state, the Communion are generally cooperative and wholly civic-minded. Many cite the example of Deacon Bell, who died in a selfless effort to prevent a boiler explosion in 1917. Since the Deacon's passing, Church members have become more insular, but remain essential to colony maintenance.\n\n**__DEMOGRAPHICS__**: According to the 1921 census, 73% of colonists claim ethnic origins in the British Isles, including Englishmen, Irishmen, Scotsmen and others. 8% of the population are Frenchmen; 4% are German; all other populations are negligible, including Slavs, Jews, and Sidhe refugees.\n\n> **Note**: While most fair folk are reluctant to cross the Other London Bridge due to its wrought-iron construction, two Sidhe families made ingress via the small green door in the Tate Library, which predates human colonization.\n\n**__INDUSTRY AND ECONOMY__**: Mining is the primary industry on 8837 London. The asteroid contains abundant iron, copper, nickel, gold, and platinum, which justify the continued expense of maintaining the colony. In the interest of creating a reliable source of fuel and making the environment more hospitable to Fae colonists, many of these iron deposits have been transmuted into coal. The mnemonic key for this thaumaturgical formula is available upon request.[[footnote]] Paired documentation states that the key is, \"Bugger my hole, turn this iron to coal!\" [[/footnote]]\n\nAgricultural crops include wheat, coarse grains, potatoes, sugar beets, brassicas, juniper berries, hemp, tobacco, and edible mushrooms. Livestock farming is limited to poultry, sheep and goats. The majority of foodstuffs are distributed within the colony, but there is a brisk trade in local tobacco and spirits with terrestrial vendors.\n\n**__LABOR__**: Maintaining a stable workforce has been one of the greatest challenges of the Other London project. Unions have been legal in both England and Canada since 1872; as a result, the first working-class settlers were empowered to establish unions, councils and guilds.\n\nThis took a startling turn in 1907, when Other London Garrison identified a covert trade in seditious literature among union members. Their \"discussion groups\" featured work by Communist philosopher Karl Marx, Bolshevik provocateur Vladimir Lenin, and anarchist agitators such as Mikhail Bakunin, Peter Kropotkin and Emma Goldman. Based on printer's marks, these documents were imported from England. Once the BOS assumed responsibility for Other London, officers received formal authorization to monitor these groups as potential enemies of the state.\n\nWith the outbreak of the Great War, citizens across the British Empire were called upon for military service. This left significant gaps in the workforce, precipitating supply chain crises in Other London, England, and beyond. During this time, many empty positions were reassigned to women and young persons.[[footnote]] Defined under contemporary British law as workers aged 13 to 18 years. [[/footnote]] Facing critical shortages in high-risk sectors, the BOS erected secure barracks in the tunnels and began using penal labor for mining and maintenance.\n\nWhen static warfare began winding down in 1918, many surplus members of the Royal Engineer tunneling companies were hired on to Other London. These veterans were expected to demonstrate loyalty to King and Country, but in practice, many were disillusioned by the Great War, resentful of the officer class, and amenable to socialist politics. Rather than mitigating the threat, their combined discipline strengthened the unions' ranks.\n\nThese developments came to a head in 1919. Inspired by reports of a general strike in the Canadian city of Winnipeg, Manitoba, laborers issued a list of demands, including shorter shifts, increased rations, educational resources for young persons, safety protections for penal laborers, and a moratorium on new excavations, pending full surveys by the Royal Engineers. The Crown rejected this ultimatum, prompting a month-long labor action which was finally broken by BOS thaumaturges.\n\n------\n\n**__LATEST UPDATE__ (1921/SEP/17)**: Yesterday, eleven members of a mining crew were blown into hard vacuum while expanding Shaft Seven. Since the miners adhered to standard safety practices and set up air-locks at regular intervals, the colony is not considered to be in imminent danger.\n\nA coalition of civilians, veterans and prisoners have formed a \"Digger's Union\" to represent all mine workers. This organization attributed the catastrophe to faulty information from an outdated tunnel survey and subsequently voted to authorize strike action. The rest of Other London's labor factions are expected to follow suit. Col. Campbell is requesting support from the Occult Service, citing the increasing likelihood of retaliatory violence.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mi666\"]]\nWell, can't have that, can we? Tell the Colonel to hold the line. Cancel all new excavations, task this Digger's Union with tunnel maintenance, and whistle up some more Royal Engineers to conduct an exhaustive survey.\n\nObviously, Campbell won't be keen on this idea. That old battleaxe will say we're caving to the unions. Perhaps he's right. Frankly, I don't care. The structure is big enough for our purposes. We're trying to maintain a permanent colony, not build a bloody beehive.\n\nSigned,\n[[span style=\"font-size: larger; font-weight: bold; color: green; padding-left: 3%;\"]]-- C.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n++ Evacuation\n\nWith the outbreak of the Seventh Occult War, Other London was deemed a strategic asset by the Allied Occult Initiative (AOI) and assigned the codename \"DIAMOND PALACE\". Most records from this era were stored aboard the colony, and were presumably subject to the document destruction orders listed below.\n\n[[div class=\"aoi\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size large]]**Emergency Session Concerning DIAMOND PALACE**[[/size]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**1943/JULY/23**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**SECURITY CLEARANCE 3**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe recent \"apportation raid\" on Three Portlands[[footnote]] The Battle of Portlands, 1943. [[/footnote]] has prompted Allied High Command to re-evaluate the security of anomalous sites such as DIAMOND PALACE (asteroid 8837 London, commonly known as Other London). Since 1939, this Crown colony has been used as a labor camp, training complex and staging area for strategic assets moving between North America and Europe. This includes members of the British Occult Service (BOS), the American Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU) and the Canadian Occult and Supernatural Activities Taskforce (OSAT), all of whom have been involved in the Allied war effort.\n\nOther London was founded on the assumption that its physical isolation would guarantee security from hostile forces. However:\n\n# Operating out of the occupied neighborhood of London in Belgrade, Serbia, Nazi thaumaturges could link an appropriate physical structure with the metaphysical shadow of Other London Bridge, enter DIAMOND PALACE, and seize control of the exit.\n# If the Way were compromised in this manner, it would take at least one hour for a conventional radio distress call to reach Earth from DIAMOND PALACE.\n# Depending on the scale of this theoretical assault force, it is possible that the Obskuracorps and the Thule Society could capture the station and march directly on Allied territory before we receive word of the initial attack.\n\nWith the above considerations in mind, High Command has assembled representatives of the BOS, the UIU, and OSAT to conduct a vote on evacuating DIAMOND PALACE and closing the Way linking the colony with England and Canada.\n\nProposed priorities are as follows:\n# Locate and extract all Allied officers, government personnel, and civilian researchers.\n# Destroy any sensitive documents pertaining to Allied activity.\n# Retrieve all man-portable paraweapons and anomalous technology. Any assets that cannot be carried by hand should be abandoned or disabled.\n# Speed of execution is paramount. All other considerations secondary.\n\nVoting follows:\n[[<]]\n||~ YEA||= 4||\n||~ NAY||= 1||\n||~ ABSTAIN||= 2||\n[[/<]]\nThe operation will commence with all due haste.\n\nMay the record show that special consultant Llywelyn y Bychan has lodged a formal objection against this decision, stating:\n\n> \"There's lads and lasses on that rock!\n> You'll get 'em off or suck my ████!\"\n\nNote that under the terms of his 1864 contract with the BOS, Llywelyn is compelled to follow the above mission parameters and seal Other London Bridge once the operation is complete.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"aoi\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size large]]**Final Report on DIAMOND PALACE**[[/size]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**1943/JULY/25**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n**SECURITY CLEARANCE 3**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:2px solid #777; margin-bottom:1px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #777;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMission complete.

While standing in the pocket dimension, all three Londons are visible at once, making it difficult to track one's relative position.

All exhibit degrees of chronic fatigue, malnutrition, vitamin C and D deficiencies, and osteoporosis, which are reportedly common among the populace. Otherwise, they are in good spirits and eager to reintegrate with society.\n\nThe loyalists report more than 1,200 survivors in Other London. Roughly 85% are baseline humans. 5% have adopted Mekhanist prostheses, either out of faith or in hopes of limiting their biological needs. Less than 2% are anomalous prisoners of war (Type Blues and Greens) formerly incarcerated by the Allied Occult Initiative. The remaining 8% are anomalous humanoids, animals, and entities of uncertain classification.\n\nAs a result of the evacuation and the subsequent collapse of medical support, Other London's age demographics are dramatically skewed. 35% are children, age 14 and below; 40% are young adults, ages 15-24; the remaining 25% are adults and seniors.\n\nUnsurprisingly, this population is quite unruly. However, the settlement has not descended into total chaos. Instead, once Other London was sealed off, rioters began expropriating \"loot\" from upper-class neighborhoods. Since cash and precious minerals depreciated overnight, looters focused their attentions on the necessities of life, such as food and clean water. Rather than hoarding these resources, the populace elected to share them in kind.\n\nAs time went on and rescue did not appear, colonists began to squabble amongst themselves. Loyalist \"Maries\" argued that survivors should adhere to the principles of responsible government, whereas \"Angels\" supported multiple tendencies of Communist, socialist and anarchist thought. The latter majority won out and formed a People's Council to represent the residents, trade organizations and special-interest groups. Loyalists held seats on this People's Council, but their relationship with leftist factions remained tense. Apparently, the remaining residents of Other London are openly resentful of the Allied powers who abandoned the colony in 1943.\n\nOnly one person saw DA Llywelyn y Bychan prior to AT-744's arrival. During debrief, Martin Tilford stated:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYes, I saw that little man! He skipped out the front doors of the library, clicked his heels and started to sing. I remember just what he said, too.\n\n\"What ho, friend! Rescue is near! Round up your mates and get the heck outta here! Step up and skedaddle! I'll issue the Knock, re-open the Bridge and summon the GOC!\"\n\nI don't know what happened after that.

Due to a failure of communication regarding the size of Blackfriars Bridge in Canada (a single-lane bridge approximately 8 meters wide), ST-01 forms a line across the full width of Blackfriars Bridge in England (two lanes, approximately 32m).\n\n{{[+00:00]:}} ST-04 crosses Other London Bridge, moving west towards Middlesex. Members report some visual confusion and disorientation, but having entered from the \"narrow\" end of the Way, they are able to maintain formation.\n\n{{[+00:01]:}} ST-01 crosses Other London Bridge, moving east towards York. Funneled into a significantly narrower physical space, members of ST-01 collide and drop out of formation. Laughter is heard from both sides of the Other Thames.\n\n{{[+00:02]:}} Members of ST-01 express frustration in their native German. Recognizing their accents, residents identify ST-01 as \"Jerries\". Laughter continues, interspersed with jeering.\n\n{{[+00:04]:}} Units regain formation. Speaking English and French, members of ST-01 and ST-04 identify themselves as representatives of the UNGOC, state their intention to establish checkpoints, and urge residents to disperse.\n\n{{[+00:05]:}} Residents become vocally agitated. Crowds begin to form on both banks of the Other Thames. ST officers continue repeating their identities, directives and orders to disperse.\n\n{{[+00:13]:}} Crowds continue massing. Observers estimate more than 100 rioters on each side of the river. Many are carrying bludgeons. GOC crowd control bulletins are rendered inaudible by shouting from residents.\n\n{{[+00:19]:}} Hostile contact. Rioters engage Strike Teams on both sides of the bridge.  \n\n{{[+00:35]:}} ST-01 reports high-speed projectile fire (stones, ball bearings, and rivets) from structures adjacent to the Other Thames. Marksmen cleared to engage.\n\n{{[+00:45]:}} Strike Teams cleared to deploy +1Gen-EODCS gas grenades. Rioters display tearing of the eyes, gastric upset and respiratory distress, collapsing enemy lines. ST-01 continues to enforce melee crowd control doctrine.\n\n{{[+00:50]:}} ST-04 cleared to engage with +1Gen-EAMBR crowd control munitions. Rear echelon forms a firing line and engages at range. Six rioters confirmed disabled.\n\n{{[+00:53]:}} Approximately two-thirds (140) of the remaining rioters break contact and retreat. Strike Teams push into Other London.\n\n{{[+01:19]:}} Sixty rioters return with respiratory protection, including cotton masks, hoods, and canister gas masks. Unlike the first wave of rioters, these reinforcements are armed with knives, chains, broken bottles, spiked clubs and spears.\n\n{{[+01:21]:}} ST-04 deploys additional +1Gen-EODCS gas grenades and +1Gen-EAMBR munitions.\n\n{{[+01:22]:}} GOC riflemen engage hostiles from both sides of the river.\n\n{{[+01:38]:}} Crowd fully dispersed. Scene secured.\n\n**Results:** Sixteen enemy combatants KIA, three as a result of direct +1Gen-EAMBR fire. Checkpoints established on both sides of the Other London Bridge. Fifty detainees awaiting processing. ST-01 and ST-04 are prepared to receive reinforcements and expand into the residential zone.\n\n**Personnel Condition:** Minor injuries and battle fatigue.\n\n**Conclusions/Recommendations:** Since locals are exceptionally hostile to Strike Team 01 on the basis of nationality, we strongly recommend reassigning ground operations to Strike Team 04.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n++ Third Incursion\n\n+++ PHYSICS Records\n[[div class=\"goc\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||~ AT/ST Patrol Report (Debrief)||\n\n**Date:** 1946/APR/07\n\n**Involved Assessment/Strike Team:** AT-744 \"Black Devils\"\n\n**Filing Operative:** \"Stabbs\" 17672354/744\n\n**Mission (Location/Objective):**\n\n* Enter the tunnel network via Shaft Three and proceed to Shaft Six, making note of all landmarks that could be used as checkpoints.\n\n* Tap into the telephone junction located at the intersection of Shaft Five and Shaft Six.\n\n* Monitor communications, identify enemy strongpoints, and assess force strength.\n\n* If possible, find and extract DA Llywelyn y Bychan.\n\n**Encounter Report/Enemy Description:**\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=shaft-three.jpg\n| caption=Entrance to Shaft Three.\n| width=30%\n| align=right]]\nAT-744 made ingress via Shaft Three and advanced to Shaft Four without incident. Team members noted an abundance of graffiti, including chalk, paint and hand-tooled engravings. These included crude jokes, political slogans, territorial markings, religious art, portraiture, and abstract patterns.\n\nMoving along Shaft Four towards the center of the asteroid, AT-744 entered microgravity, making it difficult to maintain formation. This effect became more pronounced as the team approached the target marker. By the time they reached the objective in Shaft Six, AT-744 was effectively in zero-G.\n\nWhile splicing into the telephone junction, engineer \"Boomer\" was attacked by a young man whose features were camouflaged with coal dust. This youth approached AT-744 from \"above\", slit the engineer's throat, then used the body to shield himself from the Assessment Team's counterattack.\n\nAgitated, \"Ducky\" opened fire with his SMG. Unprepared for the counterforce associated with recoil in microgravity, \"Ducky\" was pushed backwards in an uncontrolled spin and unable to confirm the kill. \"Boomer\" and his assailant were also pushed back by the impact; the boy broke contact and dared AT-744 to pursue.\n\nWhile AT-744 was distracted, four additional combatants emerged from concealment in Shaft Five and entered melee with clubs, knives, and bottles. During this encounter, \"Ducky\" was stabbed multiple times and \"Skinner\" was partially blinded by 9mm SMG ricochet.\n\nRecognizing that AT-744 had lost the initiative, \"Stabbs\" switched to his shotgun and ordered a retreat. Bracing himself against the tunnel wall, \"Stabbs\" provided covering fire while the surviving members of the Assessment Team fell back in stages, casualties in tow. Rather than pursuing, enemy combatants broke contact, stating:\n\n> Send more Jerries. (laughter)\n\n**Results:** \"Skinner\" was unable to resuscitate \"Boomer\" and \"Ducky\". AT-744 gathered little intelligence before taking contact. Mission failed.\n\n**Personnel Condition:** Two KIA. All survivors have lacerations, penetrating injuries, fractures and contusions; \"Skinner\" reports loss of vision in one eye. All demoralized.\n\n**Conclusions/Recommendations:** AT-744 reports that close-range combat techniques developed in terrestrial conditions are more difficult to execute in microgravity. Team leader's tactical assessment:\n\n> These little bastards fight like Afghan cavers. Once we get deep into their territory, they'll spring ambush after ambush and vanish back into the rocks. You can keep sending men up here, make it a big bloody slog, but that won't fix the real problem: they know this terrain. They know how to fight in microgravity, and we don't. Until we can remedy that, the Otherners will hold their advantage.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n++ Interdiction Period\n[[div class=\"goc\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||||~ __High Command Nexus__ ||\n||~ Sender||High Command||\n||~ Recipient||Other London Command Central (OLCC)||\n||~ Date || 1946/APR/16||\n||~ Subject|| Interdiction Policy ||\n\nStanding orders for all officers posted to Other London Command Central (OLCC) are as follows:\n# Maintain security of the Way, denying passage to any Otherners who do not surrender themselves for GOC debriefing.\n# You are authorized to investigate unlawful and subversive behavior, interrogate suspects, seize property and conduct arrests.

In the absence of skilled technical support from the Broken Church, I think it unlikely that the Otherners will be able to repair their habitat.\n\nThe Council of 108 just held an emergency session to discuss the issue.

Colony administration lacked the ability to repair and expand the structure on their own; as such, the Occult Service began seeking terrestrial partners for astronautic research and development, including private contractors and civilian think-tanks.\n\nOne such organization was the British Interplanetary Society (BIS). As private rocketry experiments are forbidden under the laws of the United Kingdom, the BIS has focused on designing navigational equipment, habitats, and protective equipment for manned spaceflight.\n\nWhen BIS engineers H.E. Ross and R.A. Smith presented their design for a self-contained \"lunar space-suit\" [((bibcite lunar))], their project was flagged by the Occult Service, forwarded to the Global Occult Coalition, and subcontracted to Prometheus Labs [((bibcite hardsuit))] for research, development and implementation.\n\nThe resulting Mark-1 Prometheus Astrotechnologies Hardsuit (PAHS) is an articulated aluminum suit with a full range of motion. The Mark-1 is constructed entirely of mundane materials, making it relatively easy to manufacture and fit to any standard humanoid body plan. The metallic outer layer is burnished to deflect heat; the inner layer is comprised of five-ply textiles, jacketed with airtight rubber. With its onboard radio module, liquid cooling and moisture recycling systems, the Mark-1 PAHS is rated for three continuous hours of activity in hard vacuum.\n\nAs of December 1952, six (6) prototype Mark-1 PAHS suits are ready for immediate deployment.\n\n[[bibliography]]\n: lunar : H.E.

These assets were delivered to Central Middlesex, where they were handed over to the newly-formed Maintenance Lodge No. 2 and Ambassadors issued an open invitation for dialogue.\n\nAfter several hours of public debate, the People's Council of Other London agreed to a ceasefire and committed to diplomatic talks.

Any contemporaneous records have been lost, but NTE-2858 states that the terms of the geas were as follows:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nLet us make clear, by short explanation,\nhow the Crown and their Knight made fresh application\nto Babbage the Censor; whose love for equations\nwill create a machine for grand calculations.\nNow, there's but one knocker in the Queen's vast dominion\nwho in things thaumaturgic can lend his opinion;\nand thus three of us shall be held to commission\none fair diamond palace, by Royal permission!\n\nBy the grace of Sir Airy, scientific adviser,\nand the strength of my spirit, much older and wiser,\nwe here forge a contract with Babbage the Grinder,\nwho has proven the need for a timely reminder:\nIf you are so lightly furnished with sense\nthat music and laughter cause you offense\nand if it be there that your efforts reside,\nyour essence will linger long after you've died.\n\nAs for the Crown and the question of title,\nhere's the condition I consider most vital:\nyou must care for those folk who work in the mines!\nSee to their needs, whatever the signs.\nFor if fools would govern with apathy slavish,\nthen their states shall be met with enmities knavish.\nWheresoever fine men are confined and abused:\nMonarchs be damned! Divine rights be refused!\n\nYes, I'll open your Way, and close it just once;\nask me again and I'll prove you're a dunce.\nWe will take back what's ours while you prattle and rave,\nand as long as I live, you'll spin in your grave!\n[[/div]]\n\nReaching out to the Sidhe Consulate, Ambassador Doyle ascertained that Llywelyn y Bychan is indeed one of the \"fair folk\", but he is not Sidhe. With this in mind, PSYCHE Division conducted another sweep of the King's Archives and identified an additional document from Sir Airy's estate.\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\n**//Journal entry regarding work at Camborne, Cornwall, England, dated 1828.//**\n \nOur experiments at Dolcoath mine have been frustrated yet again. We cannot calculate the earth's mean density under these conditions! Our galvanic batteries are unreliable; our timepieces are corroding; most importantly, flooding has made the tunnels quite unstable.\n \nDuring our final descent, I heard the most persistent knocking, like a visitor rapping upon my door. I asked the good Dr. Whewell to quiet himself, and in this instant, the knocking stopped -- but the timber supports above us began to collapse. When we turned to flee, I spotted a diminutive gentleman with a Phrygian cap and a long beard. He promised to lead us to safety, and sure enough, we all lived to tell the tale.\n\nOnce we reached the surface, our savior doffed his cap and introduced himself as \"Llywelyn y Bychan\", one of the fair folk native to these British Isles. When I explained the purpose of our scientific mission, he grew quite excited, describing himself as \"a spirit of the earth, and a student of the skies\". Thereafter he offered up a great many observations on the character of the Cornish hills, the movement of the stars, and thaumatological workings unique to his people.\n\nLet it be known that while this is my first encounter with fair folk, I am quite aware of their fondness for pacts, particularly pacts which are unfair towards the human signatories. However, Llywelyn has shared his wisdom without demanding any form of compensation. He seems quite impressed by the developments of our industrial age, such as mechanical engineering, astronomy and mathematics. He is a vulgar little imp, but he has a vast wealth of knowledge, and his talent for verse is quite endearing. I think there is much we could learn from each other.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nBased on this new intelligence, PSYCHE Division has concluded that Llywelyn y Bychan is a Welsh subspecies of Fae, the Coblynau.[[footnote]] Analogous to the Swiss gnome, Cornish knocker, or North American tommyknocker. [[/footnote]] Like Sidhe, members of this anomalous hominid subspecies (//Homo sapiens kobold//) have a natural affinity for thaumaturgy; however, as a chthonic species, the Coblynau have adapted to life underground. Typical Coblynau are under 1.5 meters (5 feet) tall, require less food, water, and oxygen than baseline humanoids, and demonstrate advanced situational awareness in subterranean environments.\n\nIn folklore, Coblynau are thought to be benevolent, but capricious. They are particularly sympathetic towards mine workers and resentful of the corruption associated with material wealth.\n\nLlywelyn y Bychan has been designated **KTE-2859-Blue-Pygmalion**.
