Until the existence of SCP-001-A can be conclusively verified, all Foundation documentation concerning the anomaly is to be altered to reflect the iteration present on Site-01's internal archives. Documents suggesting the existence of SCP-001-A are to be archived separately for research purposes.\n\nPersonnel possessing less than level 5 clearance are to be informed that SCP-001-A has never existed, and is the result of a hostile informational entity which has since been neutralized. \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n[[size 0%]]@@ @@[[/size]] \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=dark\n|unique-name=desc\n|display-name= Description\n]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n| name=http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5549/Shirley_Chisholm.jpg\n| caption=An alleged image of SCP-001-A.\n| width=190px]]\n\nSCP-001 is an anomalous phenomenon affecting either (or both):\n\n* the Site-01 internal database and the memories of Site-01 personnel.\n* all other Foundation databases and the memories of all other Foundation personnel.\n\nThrough mechanisms and to extents that remain unknown, SCP-001 has affected Foundation documentation to legitimize either the existence or non-existence of SCP-001-A. Site-01 possesses no evidence outside of this document confirming the existence of SCP-001-A, whereas all other Foundation databases store alternate versions of these documents which corroborate its existence. Similarly, Site-01 personnel claim no knowledge of SCP-001-A, while over 80% of remaining personnel claim distinct memories of its name, image, and related documentation. \n\nSCP-001-A is Maria Jones, an alleged member of Site-01 personnel. Foundation databases, except for the Site-01 internal database, consistently suggest the following details:\n\n* SCP-001-A is the Director of RAISA and has been for over a decade.\n* SCP-001-A displays exceptional loyalty to the Foundation and its objectives.\n* SCP-001-A has been instrumental in the proper containment and archival of a multitude of anomalies.\n\nSite-01 documents, however, suggest that RAISA does not have a Director position and that its associated responsibilities are typically assigned to the current O5-1. A supposed image of SCP-001-A (as seen above), present in several documents, is actually an image of American Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm; this has led to speculation that SCP-001 has also either accessed or directly affected public historical records.\n\nSCP-001 was discovered on 2001/07/02 after Site-01 database security systems detected two unauthorized updates to the SCP-001 file, which was previously used to store a series of retirement proposals known as the Heritage Collection. Only the second of these updates was visible, as the first had inexplicably not been archived. Upon inspection, it was found that the SCP-001 proposal file had been replaced with a single, unformatted document that read \"Maria Jones does not exist\". This edit was made using an unknown set of login credentials, which did not correspond to any user in the Site-01 SCiPnet system; however, external systems verified that the credentials corresponded with a user named Maria Jones.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n----\n+++ __ADDENDUM 001.1:__ {{AUDIO LOG}}\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶VIEW ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷HIDE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n**FOREWORD:** A secure personnel phone line was found to be associated with SCP-001-A's supposed[[footnote]]SCP-001-A's credentials are logged legitimately within SCiPNET despite the suspect existence of 001-A outside of the database.[[/footnote]] credentials. The following is a transcribed recording of a call made to this phone.\n----\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n= <//Twenty-five seconds of ring tone. After the ringing ceases, a message begins to play. Female voice begins mid-sentence.//>\n\n**UNKNOWN:** --else I'll be able to hide. I have no clue why this way is safe. Maybe a landline phone is perceived as an insignificant way of storing information? Shit, I'm messing it up by thinking about it. \n\n= <//A crash of some kind is heard, followed by a brief silence.//>\n\n**UNKNOWN:** Okay, //focus//. Whoever's listening, my name is <//STATIC//> and I am real. Or, at least, I was. I need you to remember me. Once the anomaly gets to me, I'll be subject to its rules. You need to perceive that I exist. You need to believe in me. \n\n**UNKNOWN:** As for the anomaly... SCP-001 is irrelevant. The best thing you can do is leave it alone. Don't look into it, don't think about it. Don't do anything special to try and get rid of it. You'll only make it worse.\n\n= <//The unidentified voice sighs.//>\n\n**UNKNOWN:** I think it's devouring me now.\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n----\n**AFTERWORD:** This recording is believed to be manufactured by SCP-001 to prevent its containment.

Several methods of memetic interrogation have also verified that no Foundation personnel show signs of memory insertion or alterations, suggesting that the anomaly's reality-restructuring is complete enough to be virtually undetectable.\n\nSince SCP-001 was discovered, I have not experienced any unusual difficulty while executing recordkeeping duties. As far as I am aware, no part of my past or present performance indicates unusual influence or reality-alteration. Until such a time that SCP-001-A makes contact with the Foundation, its nonexistence is to be assumed.\n\nDue to the scope of SCP-001's effect, I am re-designating the anomaly as Keter, effective immediately.\n[[>]]\n[[size 90%]]//- O5-1, Overseer of Records and Information Security//[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou are accessing file 2 of 4.
