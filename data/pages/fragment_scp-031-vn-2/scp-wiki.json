All attempts to influence the subject have proven futile, but at the same time, there is no need to convince the subject. \n\n**Description:** SCP-031-VN is the lack of awareness of the Department of Unreality’s importance. The only individual to harbour this anomaly is SCP-031-VN-A, Doctor Nguyễn Thùy Trang, Director of the Parainformation Division.\n\n**ADDENDUM-1:** Witness Log\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n= //[Dir. Trang rushes into a meeting room, holding a bulky stack of paper on one hand and a laptop on the other. She looks more exhausted than ever. She sits in a chair closest to the entrance.]//\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Thank you everyone for joining. We have obtained new clues about 031-VN, especially in the new recording-\n\n**Rsch. A:** This again?\n\n**Rsch. B:** Didn’t they shelve this project?\n\n**Rsch. C:** What a waste of time.\n\n**Dir Trang:** Wait!\n\n= //[Everyone disappears, except for Dir. Trang and Vice Dir. Mạnh.]//\n\n**Dir. Trang:**  Where did everyone go?\n\n**Vice Dir. Mạnh:** Trang, the Site Director has ordered the cessation of SCP-031-VN research.\n\n= //[Dir. Trang opens her laptop to check.]//\n\n**Dir. Trang:** No… that can’t be! 5 days ago? Why am I just seeing this now?!\n\n= //[Dir. Trang opens her eyes and look at Vice Dir. Mạnh, but he is no longer there.]//\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Damn it… damn it!\n\n= //[Dir. Trang rushes to the Administration Office. Everyone stares at her, all 755 personnel of the Site.]//\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Director! \n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** [[footnote]] Real name has never been revealed for unknown reasons. --Display narrative anomalous properties.-- Has no work history, has always been in this position in the Foundation’s database. [[/footnote]] Oh, Ms. Trang, I was about to summon you to my office.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** As a member of the Site-75-VN administration board, I want you to rescind the cessation order of SCP-031-VN research!\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** Why?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What do you mean “why”?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** Why do you want me to rescind it?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** B-because this is an anomaly that hasn’t been fully contained! The Foundation cannot let a problem continue unchecked!\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** Have you ever considered that you are the wrong one here?\n\n**Dir. Trang:**  Wr-wrong at what?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** Everything! Where should I even start? Your method, your work, the information you gathered… and more importantly, you think this \"anomaly\" is causing us trouble.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Did Steve suggest this to you?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** This case has also made me realise one thing: **//I don’t recall you being a director at all, were you?//**\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Huh? What are you saying?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** Allow me to be frank, you are not capable of being a director, especially for a division like Parainformation. While your skills are indeed unmatched, you are just too stubborn.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Wait, you just skipped a step. What just happened to me?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** You were never a director, that’s all.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** This can’t be… It’s the work of those Unreality people, isn’t it?\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:** No, it was my work, stop putting the blame on them; you know what I’m capable of.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** But why?! My 12 years of hard work! Is it all just gone?\n\n**[ DATA EXPUNGED]:** No. Most of it is still intact. Your research, degrees, gender transitioning process, et cetera, they are all still there, just that you were never promoted to director. So there’s no need for reports or any paperwork. No need to be upset.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** This is… this is not fair…\n\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]:**  I would say something cliché about the world being unfair and all, but never mind, seem like you need some fresh air. Send a formal request to Overwatch Command if you need anything. \n\n= //[Dr. Trang walks out of the office, surrounded by the vacant stares of hundreds of people.]//\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Someone… please help.\n\n= //[Nobody answers.]//\n\n= //[Nobody wants to answer.]//\n\n= //[Nobody needs to answer.]//\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Please tell me… what Unreality is…\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** We tried, but not once did you listen.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** <<//screams out//>> I TRIED!! But I still can’t understand, I can’t hear anything!\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** Not everyone can hear them, but everyone at least have something poured into their ears. \n\n**Dr. Trang:** <<//screams out//>> WHAT ABOUT ME? I WORKED LIKE A DOG DAYS AND NIGHTS, AND AND I DON'T EVEN GET ANY FUCKING THING IN RETURN! IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT, YOUR FAULT.\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** How disappointing, hundreds of people gave you an explanation, yet you still went in circles.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** <<//screams out//>> THEN WHY DIDN’T THEY JUST ERASE THE PART I DON’T UNDERSTAND?! OR CREATE THE KNOWLEDGE INSIDE MY HEAD?!\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** That would be like asking someone to hold a cup that is 500 meters away, you were not within their reach.\n\n= //[Dr. Trang sobs.]//\n\n**Dr. Trang:** You’re lying…\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** Unreality is so basic, so easy to comprehend. You are but a burden to everyone. Nobody here is not disappointed with you.\n\n= //[No response, why?]//\n\n**[DATA IRRELEVANT]:** Why should we care about you?\n\n= //[Everyone disappears, leaving Trang a sobbing mess in the hallway.]//\n\n**Trang:** No! Wait! Get back… here.\n\n= //[Who do you think you are to demand their attention? They all have more important work to take care of.]//\n\n**Trang:** But I tried… I really did…\n\n= //[Your effort was misplaced, and now it’s time to face the consequence. No one can sympathise with you, because you couldn’t give them a reason to do so, only countless reasons to do the opposite.]//\n\n**Trang:** …\n\n= //[There is not a single soul, or a single sound. You failed, accept it.]//\n\n**Trang:** Even if… even if I could go back in time, I’m afraid that I’d still go down this path.\n\n= //[Because you are not aware of what you did wrong.]//\n\n**Trang:** Can you just tell me?\n\n= //[You have been told by so many people already, what else can I add?]//\n\n**Trang:** I just want to know what Unreality is…\n\n= //[ [http://scp-vn.wikidot.com/phong-ban-chet-doi Dr. Ann] walks toward Trang. Please help this woman out for me.]//\n\n**Dr. Ann:** Do you really wish to know?\n\n**Trang:** Yes…\n\n**Dr. Ann:** But why?\n\n**Trang:** I don’t… even know, maybe to understand this mess?\n\n**Dr. Ann:** But everything is still the same. The only difference may be that this place is bigger.\n\n**Trang:** Right, seems like I don’t know anything at all.\n\n= //[Trang stops sobbing.]//\n\n**Dr. Ann:** Don’t worry, after all, Unreality is an anomaly outside the scope of Parainformation. The first step you should take is to stand up, dust yourself off, and move on.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** You’re right. Nothing stops for nothing.\n\n**Dr. Ann:** Then are you ready to learn about Unreality?\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Are you sure it’s a complete explanation?\n\n**Dr. Ann:** More than sure.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Then I am ready.\n\n**Dr. Ann:**  Unreality\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Is?\n\n**Dr. Ann:** Is.\n\n**Dr. Trang:** Is.\n\n**Dr. Ann:** Nothing.\n\n= //[Dr. Trang collapses on the floor.]//\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n----\n**Afterword:** Dr. Ann has successfully explained to Dr. Trang about Unreality and the importance of the Department of Unreality, SCP-031-VN was subsequently reclassified as //Neutralized//.
