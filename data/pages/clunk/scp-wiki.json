Clack.\n\nWithout stopping, without pausing, sling your bag across your front, pull out a water bottle.\n\nCrink. Clunk.\n\nTake a drink. Old, plasticky water, hard lump in your throat.\n\nShunk. Clunk.\n\nNever slowing for even a moment. Fast heartbeat, thudding in your neck.\n\nClunk. Clurnk.\n\nPut the bottle away, bag across the back. Straps dig deep into your dirty orange shirt.\n\nClunk. Clush.\n\nIf you stop, if you even slow, he'll see you. See you among the black hole of the stairs and the grey concrete of the walls.\n\nCush. Crunch.\n\nSomewhere, far down there, she's crying. High and plaintive, \"-ommy, please? Are you th-\"\n\nClunk. Turn, six steps. Clunk.\n\nMaybe that girl is walking downward, just like you. Her voice cuts through the quiet of this place, no matter how far down she is.\n\nClunk. Clunk.\n\nShe never seems to get any closer. \"-one? I- I- I'm so alone, pl-\"\n\nCrick. Clunk.\n\nWhatever she's doing, she's scared. Dark clouds at the border of your vision, fear and anger and protectiveness.\n\nClunk. Shunk.\n\nWish you could tell her there's nothing to fear. Your heart's beating up in your ears.\n\nShink. Clunk.\n\nThere's no sound in this place. Stuffy, wet, woolly silence.\n\nClunk. Clurk.\n\nNothing but your feet and her crying. One steady rhythm, one unpredictable anguish.\n\nShlunk. Clunk.\n\nNothing but stale air and rusty metal.\n\nTurn, six steps.\n\nAnd him.\n\nShkunk. Clunk.\n\nSometimes you worry that you'll turn the corner and he'll be there. The handrail glints in the darkness, leading around the corner.\n\nClunk. Clutck.\n\nThat he'll be staring up at you from the next landing. This landing's bare and dirty grey and faintly damp.\n\nClunk. Clusk.\n\nOr that he's right behind you, staring. Goosebumps start to grow, on your arms, on your neck.\n\nClupk. Clunk.\n\nHis white eyes could be just a foot behind you, waiting for you to glance back. You see those blank, soulless eyes when you blink sometimes, for just a moment.\n\nClunk. Slunk.\n\nBut there's no use imagining. Just focus on reality, a dim cone of watery light, muddy steps ahead.\n\nClunk. Shlunk.\n\nJust keep walking. Your legs start to cramp, unused to anything but a cell.\n\nClunk. Turn, six steps. Clink.\n\nThere's a strange smell, this flight. You've barely smelled anything but rust down here.\n\nCrlunk. Clunk.\n\nIt's getting stronger. Piercing your nostrils, straight into the center of your attention.\n\nShlink. Clunk.\n\nLike cat piss and bleach. It's making your head swim with its intensity.\n\nSquelch.\n\nOh shit you stepped in it. Oh yuck it's fucking gross and it splashed on your ankle and it smells horrible. And it's brown and chunky and -.\n\nWait.\n\nOh no.\n\nSlowly, slowly, look -\n\nOh shit fuck FUCK oh my SHITTING fuck\n\nOh god he's **THERE** you **STOPPED YOU STOPPED AND HE'S THERE**\n\nOh god RUN **RUN**  RUN up and UP and UP and turn and up and UP\n\nHe's **BEHIND YOU** he's chasing you oh god no **HOW** did you STOP how **COULD YOU STOP**\n\nNEVER stop never **NEVER** never never never never\n\noh shit oh god PLEASE **PLEASE** he's RIGHT behind you\n\noh no OH NO oh no **OH NO** up and //UP// and **UP** and **up** and {{UP}} and __**UP**__ and //**UP**// and trip and -\n\nSmack.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\ncrack.\n\n-\n\nClunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk. Clunk.\n\nTurn to the right, six steps.\n\nClunk.
