It also serves as the location of the primary servers for the Emergency Services Anomaly Screening (ESAS) algorithm responsible for parsing all phone calls made to emergency services in the western half of the world.\n\nSince November 24th, 1980, Site-14 has been designated the Western Inspection Node for Anomalous Telecommunications Reports, thus directing the management and storage of all western TMO facilities' evaluated calls for possible future use. Site-14 is also tasked with reviewing calls determined to possibly have been incorrectly flagged.\n\nSite-14 does not contain nor study any anomalous objects and is not outfitted to do so, as its primary purpose is the monitoring and interception of calls to emergency services. Due to the lack of anomalous influence on-site and its importance for the Telecommunications Monitoring Office functions, Site-14 is designated a Protected Facility.\n\nThe Foundation maintains strict observation of the online activity of all Site-14 Level 1 Operatives due to the large number of employed persons and the extent to which they remain integrated with society. Notably, Site-14 does not require personnel to remain on location for the duration of employment, instead allowing staff to lead a \"normal\" civilian life outside of Site-14.\n\nAll personnel's place of residence is recorded by the Foundation, and all changes must be reported within 10 days of vacating the previous place of residence.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n[[# Subd]]\n++ Subdivisions\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/SecuritySubdivison.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**SECURITY**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Alex Lee\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Despite not having any contained anomalies, Site-14 Security Subdivision's primary purpose is to repel both covert and direct attacks to the facility from several [[[Groups of Interest]]] or other individuals, anomalous or not. Their secondary purpose is to screen new employees for potential threats and act in case of an internal attack on the TMO or the Foundation as a whole. Although all Security Officers are granted Level 1 Security Clearance, some Officers may be granted provisional Level 2 Security Clearance during an external GoI attack.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/MemeticsSubdivision.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**COGNITOMEMETICS**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Lourdes Alvarez-Hellstrup\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Due to the high amount of exposure to unfiltered information involved in being a Telecommunications Monitoring Operative, several memetics and cognitohazard experts and researchers are stationed at Site-14 to inoculate new employees against (and monitor for new) memetic and/or cognitive threats. All Memetics Personnel are granted Level 3 Security Clearance but may be granted provisional Level 4 Security Clearance in the case of an anomalous outbreak or a similar emergency situation.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/PsychologySubdivision.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**PSYCHOLOGY**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Polina Runova\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Level 1 and Level 2 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives face significant emotional stress due to the nature of their jobs: signs of depression and anxiety are known to increase up to 56% after one week of employment as a Telecommunications Monitoring Operative. In order to prevent this, thereby keeping the facility's operations at maximum efficiency, therapists and psychiatrists from the Site-14 Psychology Subdivision periodically meet with each employee to assess the state of their mental health and provide therapeutic services. All employees of the Psychology Subdivision are granted Level 1 Security Clearance.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/TechnologyDivision.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Richard Ko\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Site-14 employs thousands of electronic devices with the purpose of intercepting, monitoring, and connecting to calls made to emergency services in the western half of the world. The Information Technology Subdivision at Site-14 maintains and, when needed, repairs or replaces equipment necessary to site operations. The Information Technology Subdivision also updates and maintains the ESAS algorithm. All IT Technicians are granted Level 1 Security Clearance.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/nLevel1TMO.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**LEVEL 1 TELECOMS. MONITORING OPERATIVES**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Gabrielle Lauser\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Level 1 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives listen to calls considered to be anomalous by the ESAS algorithm. Level 1 Operatives then decide whether or not each call is anomalous or mundane, forwarding all anomalous calls to Level 2 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives. Level 1 Operatives are subjected to mandatory bimonthly appointments with a therapist from the Site-14 Psychology Subdivision. All Level 1 Operatives have Level 1 Security Clearance and are considered non-essential personnel.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/nLevel2TMO.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**LEVEL 2 TELECOMS. MONITORING OPERATIVES**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Orion Sheridan\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Level 2 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives receive calls deemed anomalous by Level 1 Operatives and connect directly to the caller. Level 2 Operatives' primary purpose is to locate and identify anomalies; all relevant information is then forwarded to Level 3 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives. Their secondary purpose is to, by calmly instructing them, keep endangered callers safe from anomalous objects. Level 2 Operatives are subject to mandatory weekly appointments with a therapist from the Site-14 Psychology Subdivision. All Level 2 Operatives are granted Level 2 Security Clearance.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/nLevel3TMO.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**LEVEL 3 TELECOMS. MONITORING OPERATIVES**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Athziri Holster\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Level 3 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives receive information about anomalous items from Level 2 Operatives and, based on the perceived threat posed by each anomaly, send the appropriate [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces|Mobile Task Forces]]] or Response Teams to locate and contain said item. Level 3 Operatives have no direct access to callers, only information obtained by Level 2 Operatives. Level 3 Telecommunications Monitoring Operatives are granted Level 4/TMO Security Clearance, allowing them access to the Foundation's database in order to consult the current location and status of all Mobile Task Forces and Secure Facilities worldwide.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background: url(http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/AdministrationS14.png) center center no-repeat;\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICES**[[/size]]\n**Subdivision Director:** Vincent Cuevas\n\n**On-Site Purpose:** Site-14's Administrative staff is responsible for managing employees, providing funding for the maintenance of the facility, and improving Site-14's efficiency, among other duties. All decisions regarding the operation of Site-14 are made by Administration. Most non-essential Administrative staff are granted Level 0 Security Clearance.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[# MTF]]\n++ Mobile Task Forces\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **MTF Omicron-67 (\"Zeroth Responders\")**\n[[/=]]\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/EbAqoQJ.png width=\"250px\"]]\n**Task Force Mission:** Mobile Task Force Omicron-67 specializes in arriving at anomalous emergencies before non-anomalous first responders do. Their job often entails keeping regular emergency services from interfering with anomalous entities, locations, and events until Foundation agents, containment specialists, rapid response teams, and/or other Mobile Task Forces can arrive.\n\n**Assisting In Containment of Objects:**\n[[[SCP-5783]]]\n\n**Action Reports:**\n[[[rapture-a-tale-of-the-tmo|Rapture]]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[# Story]]\n++ Site History\n[[/=]]\n----\n**April 30th, 1969**: Telecommunications Monitoring Office is formally established, along with Site-14, by now-former Department Head Stanley Le. Doctor Nero Muñoz is appointed as General Director. Initial department size is approximately 413% larger than currently. Site-14 at the time encompasses 2 city blocks and employs more than 5000 personnel.\n\n**December 1971**: A minor outbreak of [[[SCP-6840]]] occurs, infecting an estimated total of ██ personnel. A total of █ defect to various Groups of Interest. All remaining infected personnel are subsequently terminated. In light of this incident, several memetics[[footnote]]Then known as Mimesis and Cryptomancy Research.[[/footnote]] and cognitohazard researchers are permanently stationed at Site-14 in order to prevent such events in the future.\n\n**June 19th, 1977**: General Director Nero Muñoz retires. Assistant Director Jane Dani is promoted to General Director, hiring Jonathan Smith as her replacement. Director Dani notably puts an emphasis on the importance of technology in screening emergency calls, leading to the creation of the ESAS algorithm.\n\n**August 1977**: The first iteration of the ESAS algorithm is implemented at Site-14. Initial reports show ~1.8% of all calls forwarded to Level 1 Operatives are anomalous, compared to >0.04% produced by the Anomalous Telecommunications Identifier (ATI) algorithm, the precursor to ESAS. ESAS effectivity slowly improves over the following years due to continued updates orchestrated by on-site IT Technicians.\n\n**November 24th, 1980**: Site-14 is designated the Western Inspection Node for Anomalous Telecommunications Reports with the addition of a new building to the facility, encompassing 3 floors of office space for Level 1 Operatives and IT Technicians. Site-14 now employs more than 8500 personnel, most of which are Level 1 Operatives.\n\n**April 16th, 1983:** Project SNOWFLAKE is approved and its development begins. Assigned budget to Security and IT Subdivisions increases by 8%.\n\n**February 15th, 1985**: Assistant Director Jonathon Smith is terminated (see Notable Incidents Log) and Kevan Samuels takes his place as Assistant Director.\n\n**January 24th, 1992**: Heavy damage is sustained to Site-14 during a GoI attack (see Notable Incidents Log). A total of ██████ in USD is lost in damages (excluding casualties sustained). Site-14 operations are postponed for several weeks as emergency repairs commence. General Director Jane Dani is killed during the incident, automatically promoting Assistant Director Kevan Samuels to General Director.\n\n**February 11th, 1992**: The TMO's internal bid to become the department with primary responsibility for Internet-based anomalies is unsuccessful in favor of a joint bid by the Information Technology Department and the Department of Anomalous Broadcasting. The Office instead obtains only delegated responsibility for monitoring of the then-nascent technology of Voice over Internet Protocol (VOIP). 67 TMO Site-14 staff are reassigned to the new department in the subsequent restructuring.\n\n**April 1996**: New Foundational General Funding Budget announces 17% drop in funding for the TMO. Restructuring program spearheaded by (now former) Department Head Morgan Phaser cuts costs via increasing usage of pre-screening algorithms and reducing redundant false-negative checks, reducing total staffing needs by 31%. Site-14 is reduced to encompass 1 city block and former Site-14 properties are assimilated back into the civilian real estate market. Less than 3000 personnel now under employment.\n\n**August 1997**: Inquiry into major containment breach identifies insufficient auditing of false-negatives by the TMO as a major factor in breach of [[[SCP-5110]]]. TMO comes under heavy scrutiny by the rest of the Foundation, and funding is reduced by a further 22%. Site-14 Administration is forced to sell the majority of properties owned by Site-14, reducing facility size to its current dimensions encompassing only 1 building. Mass layoffs are initiated to cut costs, leaving Site-14 staffed by ~700 employees. Kevan Samuels resigns as General Director, replaced initially by Samantha Williams.\n\n**November 1999**: Following a harassment claim, Samantha Williams accepts early retirement in lieu of disciplinary sanctions. The Office is led by five different Acting General Directors over the next six years due to various extenuating circumstances.\n\n**May 2005**: After the TMO plays an instrumental part in [[[scp-1425|Protocol Ophiuchus]]], the TMO's budget is revised, granting an additional 34% funding to the department. Site-14 personnel numbers rise to current levels, and ESAS is promptly updated to detect signs of a second SCP-1425 event. New General Director Rachel Messer is parachuted in to oversee the expansion and modernization of Site-14.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n[[# Inci]]\n++ Notable Incidents Log\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**DESIGNATION:** 14-008\n\n**DATE:** Febuary 15th, 1985\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** Assistant Director Jonathan Smith was discovered leaking confidential information relating to Site-14 operations to [[[chaos insurgency hub|GoI-2014 (\"Chaos Insurgency\")]]]. After several interrogation sessions, Assistant Director Smith was terminated and Site security protocols were revised. Kevan Samuels was recruited as the new Assistant Director.\n\n**NOTES:** Upon investigation, Smith's motivation appears to be personal gain. According to a set of documents unearthed by the Ethics Committee's investigative efforts, Smith was being offered substantial remuneration by the Chaos Insurgency in exchange for information pertaining to the technological infrastructure of Site-14's electronic systems. After this information came to light, facility cybersecurity was improved and reworked so as to nullify any and all information shared by former Assistant Director Smith.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**DESIGNATION:** 14-012\n\n**DATE:** January 24th, 1992\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** A rogue member of [[[wandsmen hub|GoI-4023 (\"The Wandsmen\")]]] infiltrated Site-14, quickly overwhelming its security force and causing substantial damage to the Site. It ascended to Level E showing little to no regard for Foundation employees and injuring many. Once on Level E, the aggressor proceeded to attack the ESAS servers, irreparably destroying approximately 29% and causing minor damage to 43%. At this time, the entity attempted to flee the building but was subsequently terminated by [[[task-forces#lambda-4 |MTF Lambda-4 (\"Birdwatchers\")]]]. A total of ██ casualties were sustained during the event.\n\n**NOTES:** The apparent intent of the entity was to impede the TMO's efforts in locating anomalies to be contained; this aligns with the Wandsmen's ideals opposing normalcy and concealing information of the anomalous. Notably, the Wandsmen denied all involvement in the attack, stating that the attacker had acted of its own accord and had deferred from the main organization.
