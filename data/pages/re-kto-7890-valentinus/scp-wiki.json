Coalition Outpost #43, staffed primarily by members of the PNEUMA and PTOLEMY divisions, was tasked with research regarding the Threat Organization and findings possible ways of infiltration. Operation Irenaeus was founded shortly after, with the goal of infiltration and eventual destruction of the Threat Organization.\n\nIn the week leading up to the incident, janitorial personnel reported the smell of rotting flesh, in addition to hearing chanting coming from locked rooms during the night shifts. At the same time, multiple other staff members were spotted with injuries they were unable to explain, including missing small chunks of skin and muscle tissue. All injuries were found to be stitched or otherwise showed signs of tending to shortly after they were sustained.\n\nThe following message was received by the Regional Coalition Headquarters on 13/06/2022 at 22:57.\n\n> Can anyone hear me?

The Strike Team suffered 10 casualities, including 7 dead. Out of 83 personnel present at the site during the attack, only 24 survived, 9 of them seriously injured.

Rumours of lycanthropic entities have been previously spread around the area, beginning shortly after the end of the First World War. While investigation into the area had been considered in the past, the lack of evidence pointing towards parathreats in the area, in addition to shortage of resources, led to proposals for any such operations being dismissed.\n\nAfter multiple photos and recordings of unidentified figures have emerged from the area, the 5 person Strike Team-0384 \"Good Boys\" was sent to terminate or apprehend any lycanthropic entities present.\n\n> //[BEGIN LOG]//\n>\n> **\"Crow\":** Mission update, we have made our way 5 kilometers into the forest.

Being the commanding officer of the Strike Team, I trust myself much more than my men to give you the unbiased facts of what had happened.\n\nWe arrived at entrance of the settlement at circa 1740, based on the intelligence provided from us by the local agents. The \"Seŭlga\", as that particular group of Valentinus members called themselves, had not erected any notable defenses at the entrance to their settlement. There were three, large wooden doors in total. As we later learned, all led to different structures in the community. Approaching them led to all of our electronic equipment shutting down, as we were previously informed would happen. Two squads stayed behind, guarding the side entrances, while we set up explosives and prepared to breach through the middle.\n\nOn the other side of the door we found a sort of plaza, devoid of life. Multiple stone structures were suddenly in our view, as well as a large complex of wooden, stone and organic buildings. We presume the  latter to be some sort of temple. At first, there was no sight of hostiles or autonomous biological material.\n\nThat is, until we made our way about halfway into it. Suddenly, we found ourselves under fire, both from bolt-action rifles, as well as arrows. One even embedded itself in my armour, though it thankfully stopped short of piercing my skin. Our team fell back, using trees and stone shrines strewn across the settlement as cover. We began to engage the enemy, who were shootings at us from the roofs.\n\nWe lost three men during the exchange. One was hit with an arrow to his thigh. Our medic was able to drag him into cover, but by that time, I saw him leaking out of the hole in his suit. No, I am not talking about just blood. He was moving for a while, too. Another one was fatally wounded while running between cover, while the last got shot when we were exchanging fire. Another got wounded, right in the thigh. This all lasted for around 4 minutes, then we stopped hearing return fire. Judging by how there was blood seeping down from at least one of the roofs, all the hostiles appeared to be either dead, injured or have fallen back.\n\nIt is at this point that we split into two teams. One went over to the houses to finish up whoever was left, the other to secure the temple. I was leading the second. Me and ten of my men made our way up the stairs, only to notice this...small crowd, gathered near a door. Well, door isn't a good name for it. It looked like a closed maw, covered in some clear, slimy material. The crowd was mostly adolescents, save for a few old women and men. There were two white men, really standing out from the rest. We fired and shot the one closest, right in his stomach. Some of the kids turned to us and yelled something. Child soldiers, clearly. Oh, and the injured one yelled something to the other. \"Volya!\", I believe.\n\nMust have been a signal to attack, as right after, three men jump out of the bushes, right behind us. Spears in hand, yelling battle cries. All had those long, white spears with them. Probably made of bone, judging by what we know of these savages. One of my men was stabbed, other got hit over his head but the helmet saved him. The one they got started twitching and bleeding all over. We knew we couldn't do much for him. We neutralized all three, then quickly swept the area to confirm that none other remained. Once we were sure, we approached the temple again.\n\nThere wasn't anyone left near the maw by that time. We opted to throw grenades at it, we're still not sure if the damaged anything that was on the other side or not. We weren't able to get it to open during clearing operations, either. In any case, we started sweeping through the temple, after the other boys radioed in to tell us they have neutralized the remaining hostiles outside of. We told them to double check, then join us.\n\nOnce we regrouped, we moved through the remaining buildings. There were six of them, all filled with those weird symbols they put around everywhere. Paintings too. Some even had statues. I could recognize Buddha somewhere there, but the rest looked alien. In the literal sense of that word. We encountered only 4 hostiles there, two playing dead on the floor, another with his hands up in the air and trying to feign surrender. We finally reached the last building, at the back of the whole complex.\n\nInside, it looked more like a house than a place of prayer. A very spartan house, sure, but a house. There was a bed, a gas stove, some kind of shrine, there was even a table. More importantly, there a middle aged man in grey robes, sitting in the center of the structure, cross-legged and just staring at us while we breached inside. He seemed to be meditating, unfazed by the battle outside. I suspect he was a Karcist, or whatever the cultists call their priests. We swiftly neutralized him and saw him hit the ground. That's when all hell broke loose.\n\nThe corpse suddenly became bloated, then started spasming. We shot it again, in the head and chest, still nothing. Suddenly, it ripped apart, smearing this red-yellow mixture all over us. It ate through the outer layer of our suits, thankfully stopped about there. Same couldn't be said about our respirators, so we threw them off before they could melt onto our face. As we did, we noticed there was this...thick yellow fog, emerging from the corpse. When we exited the building to get away, it turned out all the bodies did the same. All 32 of them. Soon, we were all breathing these...well, I heard one of the eggheads call them spores.\n\nAs I type this from our quarantine facility, I still hear my people complaining about nightmares. Can't blame them. I am not saying we have \"PTSD\" or other made up crap like that, this was far from the worst thing we've seen. No, these nightmares seem...more vivid, specific. They show us what they want us to believe was everyday life at the settlement, then each dream ends with loud gunfire, screams and our bodies being torn apart by bullets. I assume that whatever we breathed in now forces us to view them.\n\nIt is my utmost recommendation that we increase our attacks against KTO-7890-Valentinus. These people are dangerous and willing to fight with any weapons they have, including by disinformation warfare. The faster we deal with them, the better.\n\n//Mundus, Normalis//\n\nCommander Julius Petrić\nStrike Team-0984 \"Cleaning Crew\"\nPHYSCIS Division\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n|| **CC:** Operation Sternenfall ||\n|| From: ##blue|DBAnna@PHYSICSDiv.goc##||\n\nThe following text was found written on a piece of paper inside the temple of the KTO-7890-Valentinus compound.
