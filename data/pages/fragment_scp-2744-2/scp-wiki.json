Agent has been certified in basic dispatch operations by Academy. Assistance was provided by Sr. Agent Sammi Radcliffe, Agent Jaime Greene, and Dr. Stephen House in ensuring optimal simulation environment. \n\n**PERFORMANCE:** Agent was successful in containing target anomaly under pressure. After following the lead of Agent Radcliffe, Agent provided optimal performance during engagement both with target entity and forensic investigation. Agent displays adequacy in general intelligence and critical-thinking skills.\n\n**AREA(S) OF IMPROVEMENT:** Agent unable to prevent simulated termination of Sr. Agent Radcliffe, Agent Greene, or Dr. House from target anomaly.

While our other candidates laid around and waited for their eventual demise, you instead sought the very opposite. Even despite our warnings, you willingly put yourself in danger to protect both yourself and others around you. \n\nNot only that, but you strove headfirst in ascertaining the truth -- even if it meant resorting to guesses to find it. While whatever assumptions you might've had are irrelevant now, the very act itself is what matters. That, on its own, is //exactly// what it means to work for our Foundation. So, we must commend you for your diligence. Even if your reasons for doing so were only to satisfy your own curiosity.\n\nWe need agents like you on the field. People who are selfless. Those who would risk their lives just to continue the Foundations progress toward knowledge and information. Consider this message your official introduction to the Foundation agency. You will learn many great things throughout your employment, we assure you.\n\nBut this is not your end, Agent Miller. Your time has only just begun. After all, we expect many more great things from you. This exercise was merely a test -- a way to check the skills you learned from the Academy. \n\nBut we are still very far from being finished with you.\n\n[[=]]\n~~~\n\nIn kind regards,\n\n-- Sr. Agent Sammi Radcliffe, Head of **[[[/simulacrum-project-hub|SIMULACRUM]]]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\na.collapsible-block-link {\n    color: transparent!important;\n    background-color: transparent!important;\n}\n\n.licensebox .collapsible-block-link {\n    color: rgb(var(--gray-monochrome))!important;\n    background-color: rgb(var(--black-monochrome))!important;\n}\n[[/module]]",
