Supplies of SCP-5853 are to be contained in a standard containment unit at Secure Facility 64, Wing-F. Any instances of SCP-5853 discovered being sold are to be immediately intercepted. \n\nAll episodes of SCP-5853-A have been removed from air and scans for further television broadcasts and online video are to be performed with positive returns to be expunged from their respective platforms. Under no circumstances may any Foundation personnel [[footnote]]Including D-Class[[/footnote]] that have children or are considering parenthood be assigned to SCP-5853.\n \n**Description:** SCP-5853 are packaged taffy confections. Each package of SCP-5853 contains two candies: one blue - raspberry flavored, and one red - cherry flavored. While the blue candy has thus far shown no anomalous effects, any individual who consumes the red SCP-5853, after reciting the key phrase, will be transported to an extra-dimensional space. This space coincides with the features of “Ticky Taffy Town”, henceforth referred to as “SCP-5853-A”, a 90's era television program that advertised SCP-5853 prominently.\n\nThe anomaly was brought to the attention of the Foundation by way of the UIU, who had become aware of an apparent correlation between disappearances of children and the airing of SCP-5853-A. SCP-5853 is theorized to be responsible for the disappearances of an estimated 3500 children between the years 1994-1999\n \n= ##darkred|**__SCP-5853 Document File 1: Discovery__**##\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nNotable connections between child disappearances are as follows:\n\n1. Parents of missing children have reported that their child was last seen within, or assumed to be heading into, a kitchen pantry. \n\n2. Upon searching for missing children, the only evidence found in the vicinity were open Ticky-Taffy wrappers. In all cases the cherry-flavored portion was not present, leaving the blue raspberry portion. \n\n3. The previously aired episode of SCP-5853-A had the appearance of a secondary character, “Mr. Hister”.\n\n4.  In all cases in which the parent was nearby upon the disappearance of the child, music of the show’s theme song could be heard.\n\nThe anomaly was relinquished from the UIU to the Foundation following the disappearance of a UIU operative's child. Formal request for SCP designation was sent to Administration with notable documentation contained henceforth.\n[[/div]]\n= ##darkred|**__SCP-5853 Document File 2: SCP-5853-A Character Descriptions__**##\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nPhysical descriptions and characteristics of the 5 main “characters”, henceforth referred to as “entities”, of SCP-5853-A:\n \n\t**__SCP-5853-A-1__:**\n//Mr. Squibbles//\n\n              \t __Description:__ A bipedal humanoid figure with the head of a plush octopus. Entity is approximately 3.2 meters in height and consistently wears khakis and a red sweater vest. \n\n\t\t__Personality:__ Takes the role of a father figure within SCP-5853-A. Has a patient and benevolent manner, and often touts the episode's lesson.\n \n\t**__SCP-5853-A-2__:**\n//Mrs. Bobble//\n\n          \t__Description:__ A female entity dressed in attire similar to that of a stereotypical clown, with blue hair, white makeup, red nose and an over-sized, multi-colored blouse and cargo pants. \n\n\t\t__Personality:__ Entity is often portrayed as a bringer of questions to SCP-5853-A-1 concerning the day’s lesson or theme.\n \n\t**__SCP-5853-A-3__:**\n//Kizzy Wink//\n\n                __Description:__ A small entity roughly 1 meter in height that resembles a bipedal feline. Possesses humanoid hands and an oversized head in comparison to the size of the remainder of its body. \n\n\t\t__Personality:__ Entity is often the perpetrator of the events that illicit the need for a daily lesson and theme. Often benign, but mischievous, the entity is the surrogate avatar for the young audience.\n \n\t**__SCP-5853-A-4__:**\n//Franzipans//\n\n                __Description:__ A small, rotund, plush-like avian entity roughly 0.3 meters in both length and wingspan. Entity  has an anthropomorphic hammer in place of a beak. Despite its small wingspan, entity is able to fly and will often hit the other entities as a form of physical comedy. \n\n\t\t__Personality:__ Appears to be the companion pet of SCP-5853-A-3, often annoying SCP-5853-A-1.\n \n\t**__SCP-5853-A-5__:**\n//Mr. Hister//\n\n               __Description:__ A 2.3 meters high, presumably male [[footnote]]Based on voice recordings.[[/footnote]] humanoid entity with a long, golden-yellow hooded-robe. Entity uses tentacles that emerge from beneath its cloak as a means of transport. Attempts at obtaining facial descriptions have proven difficult due to the significant distorting effects it has on SCP-5853-A recordings when entering the video frame. Current attempts to describe its face note that it resembles a misshapen, tumorous human skull. \n\n\t\t__Personality:__ While the entity is not depicted as hostile by SCP-5853-A, it is visually and verbally disturbing.\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n= ##darkred|**__SCP-5853 Document File 3: Critera & Relevant Info__**## \n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nAll episodes of SCP-5853-A that contain SCP-5853-A-5, typically start with hyper-colorized, pleasant lighting and tone, as consistent with that of children’s programing. The main cast of entities (SCP-5853-A-1 — 4 ) will act as normal throughout the first half of the episode while learning about the day's lesson. Teachings include tying shoes, the importance of brushing teeth, locking doors, listening to your parents, and telling the truth, et cetera. The mood is often bright, and after the episode's opening montage, the theme song continues to play along in the background. \n\n[[=]]\n= __Theme Song & Background Music //Prior// to SCP-5853-A-5’s Entrance__\n= //Lyrics removed as potentially cognitiohazardous.//\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n| type=audio\n| url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jaykillbam/Ticky1\n]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time \nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time \nOctopus and clown time\nHammer bird and feline\nNo time to feel down time\nNo time to feel down time\nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time \nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nHowever, when SCP-5853-A-5 enters the frame, noticeable distortions appear. Distortions include, but are not limited to: dulled video quality, over-saturation of color, and substantially decreased contrast. Additionally, the usual upbeat background theme is transposed from C-Major Ionian to B-Locrian.\n\n[[=]]\n= __Theme Song & Background Music //During// SCP-5853-A-5 Effect__\n= //Lyrics removed as potentially cognitiohazardous.//\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n| type=audio\n| url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jaykillbam/Ticky2\n]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time\nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time\nChildren of the Crown time\nRed of flesh and death time\nDreamlands wait for all time\nDreamlands wait for all time\nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time \nIt’s Ticky Taffy Town time [[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWhen on screen, the subject matter changes quite drastically as SCP-5853-A-5 offers stark nihilistic messages about reality, existence, death, and time. SCP-5853-A-1 — 4 will show signs of distress at the content of SCP-5853-A-5's speech and will attempt to offer positive counterarguments, but these are inevitably refuted by SCP-5853-A-5. Some of note are as follows:\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n                                - “To exist is such a holy endeavor, that the Gods find it impossible.”\n                                - “I met God the other day, I stared at Him, and He stared back. I cried and He cried. I laughed and He laughed. When I went to embrace Him, my hands could not pass through the Mirror.”\n                                - “Flesh is not the truth.”\n                                - “Your parents will soon die, and so will you.”\n                                - “Days have become weeks, and weeks have become moments, seconds long, decades apart. Time is ebbing, flowing, undulating as a worm through the dirt, moving towards the beak of a bird. For a long time, it has only been the ever infinite now.”\n                                - “I feel nothing but the nothingness.”\n                                - “You may not believe in the slaughter, but the slaughter believes in you.”\n[[/div]]\n \nUpon departing the scene, SCP-5853-A-5 will remark \"I shall now be departing to the land of right, with the truth of red to be my might\" as it enters the large dresser with the words “Mr. Squibbles’s Treasure Chest” written on the top. \n\nFollowing SCP-5853-A-5's departure, the episode will continue as if SCP-5853-A-5 had never visited; none of the main characters will mention the previous conversations or events. \n\nIt is believed that SCP-5853-A-5’s closing remark may have some role to play in the disappearance of the children.

Scattered throughout this large expanse is other copies of the town, each with their own SCP-5853-A house. The towns have no regard for placement, some being located overhead or below across the vast whiteness. A long pathway leading from each house converges to a single location in the distance. This location is that of a small-town square, containing a cobblestone roundabout and a large fountain in the center. D-643980’s camera is whirled around as the group walks.//\n \n**Jennifer Lam:** D-Class, wait.

I’ll submit the request.\n \n**Jennifer Lam:** You’ll need my endorsement. Which I am not willing to give.\n \n**Frank Monroe:** Huh?\n \n**Jennifer Lam:** I’m sorry, but we can't send countless MTF ops into some place we know absolutely nothing about. That could just end up as a needless loss of life.\n\n**Frank Monroe:** Jen!\n\n**Jennifer Lam:** I hate this as much as you do, but we're in no position to do anything right now outside of pulling this from the public and containing it. For all we know, the children are already dead.\n \n**Frank Monroe:** So, what do we do with the D-Class?\n \n**Jennifer Lam:** We gather as much information as we can now, and then try to get him the hell out later.\n \n//D-643980 whispers into his mic.//\n \n**D-643980:** Hey, guys, we’re here.\n \n//Camera feed pans up as Researcher Eskew zooms the camera back out to bring the panorama function online. All the SCP-5853-A-1 - 4 entities from each episode have gathered at the fountain. Over one hundred entities and over two hundred children can be seen. D-643980 and his respective entities are located immediately at the fountains edge with children and other entities crowding around. Most of the children are in a state of petrified fear, while others look sleep-deprived, most are crying. The entities converse amongst themselves in a strange, unknown language. As the last of the groups make their way to the area, the continual background theme stops.//\n \n**All the entities in unison:** I now arrive to the sea of sin, with the red of my flesh to offer him!\n \n//From a point in the white, 15 meters above the fountain, a large 3 by 2-meter mirror-like rectangle appears. The rectangle starts spinning until the blur of its motion creates a black void, out from which SCP-5853-A-5 emerges.//\n \n**Unison:** Mister Hister!\n \n//The mirror behind SCP-5853-A-5 slows down to a stop, its reflective surface expels a continuous stream of white light. From the white back-drop surrounding the space, hundreds of dark humanoid entities materialize, each motionless, suspended upside-down in the air. Each humanoid entity is the size of a child.// \n \n**Frank Monroe:** D-Class, focus in on SCP-5853-A-5. Do not interact, unless advised.\n\n**D-643980:** //Whispering.// Just get me out of here, okay?\n \n**Frank Monroe:** We’ll do our best.\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 speaks. Its voice is a combination of many overlapped whispers and hisses. When it speaks the suspended figures twitch and shake.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Hello, my children. How is everyone today?\n \n//The crowd of SCP-5853-A entities cheer and jump.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** That’s so good to hear. My children, it is time to tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.\n \n//SCP-5853-A entities continue cheering.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Ennie, Meanie, Minnie, Moe, catch a sinner by the toe.\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 points long, slender, bony finger at one of the children opposite D-643980 on the other side of the fountain.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Yes, you my child. What is your name?\n \n//The child is a female with blonde hair, approximately four to six years of age. She appears disturbed.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:** Um… Ummmm.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** My child, do I frighten you? Don’t you remember Mister Hister?\n \n**D-643980:** //Whispers into mic.// This doesn’t look good.\n \n**Frank Monroe:** Just observe D-Class. It's all we can do for right now.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:** //The child nods.// I… My name is Bethany.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Well Bethany, why don’t you come up here and tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today.\n \n//One of SCP-5853-A-5’s many tentacles extend from beneath its robe and picks up the child. The child screams. As she does, the other children are seen trying to run away, but are all intercepted by an SCP-5853-A entity.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Oh, Bethany, do not cry, have no fear. Just tell Mister Hister what he wants to hear. Did you learn your lesson today?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:** Yes.. //The child sobs.// Yes, I did sir…\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** And what was the lesson? Say it so all the other children can hear.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-1-?:** I… Um… Today I learned from Mr. Squibbles that it is um.. important to tie your shoes in his special way, so they don’t… um… come lose all day.\n \n//The cheer of an SCP-5853-A-1 entity can be heard from somewhere in the crowd.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Oh, Bethany, that is so good, and so smart of you. Your prize is to pass through the mirror and into the Dreamlands!\n \n//All SCP-5853-A entities cheer in unison.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A Entities:** The Dreamlands!\n \n//The SCP-5853-A-5 tentacle throws the child into the mirror behind it. The child’s cries are cut off as her body crosses the threshold. The mirrored surface increases in luminosity. This causes more children to try to run. The SCP-5853-A entities again restrain those who attempt to flee.//\n \n**Jennifer Lam:** Jesus.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Who is next? How about you friend?\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 uses its tentacles to acquire a young male child, with brown hair and glasses, approximately seven to nine years in age.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Hello my child. What is your name?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:** Tommy… //Sobs.// Tommy Mathis.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Ahh Tommy! You look like such a smart boy with your glasses. Can you tell Mister Hister, did you learn your lesson today?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:** I um…\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Take your time, Tommy.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-2-?:** I remember today you told us that you met, um God the other day…. you…. uh... stared at him, and… he stared back. You uh cried and he cried too. Um… You laughed and he did too. You went to hug him, but your hands could not umm… pass through the… the… Mirror.’\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** What a smart boy you are! And so rare! Not for this world!\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 sighs, as the child it was holding vanishes. SCP-5853-A-5 then turns to the other children.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** I do like when that happens. Who’s next? How about you?\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 grabs another child, male, black hair, five to seven years of age.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** And what is your name young man?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:** //The child is sobbing uncontrollably.// I… I… I…\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Don't be afraid, I just want to know your name.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:** I… I… Tyrone… Please.\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Well Tyrone, can you tell Mister Hister what lesson you learned today?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:** I… I… didn’t pay attention... I… I don’t know!\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** You didn’t learn anything Tyrone?\n \n**SCP-5853-A-Child-3-?:** No… I…\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Well then Tyrone, you are now going to learn your lesson.\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 holds the child over the fountain and begins to flay them starting with the legs. Small chunks of flesh are removed by the tentacles' serrated suckers while the child screams in pain. The child can be seen and heard screaming. Blood and flesh fall into the fountain causing the water to turn red. As SCP-5853-A-5 works its way up the child’s body, it tears away at pieces of skin and flesh and tosses them into the fountain. The SCP-5853-A entities surrounding the fountain rush in and begin to devour the pieces. This causes the remaining children to attempt escape. Video feed from D-643980 shows that he also attempts to flee. All around the tentacles of SCP-5853-A-5 start to grab children at a much faster rate, skipping the pervious introductions and going straight to asking each child what lesson they learned. The many voices comprising SCP-XXX-A-5’s speech ask multiple children at the same time. As each answer they all met fate of the previous children based on their responses. (See Addendum SCP-5853-3)//\n \n**D-643980:** Fuck, fuck, fuck, what do I do?!\n \n**Frank Monroe:** Try to find shelter of some sort! Anywhere!\n \n//In their panic, some of the children run over or are pushed off the side of the floating precipice of the town center. Their bodies, immediately lifted into the air to become a part of the floating figures above SCP-5853-A-5. D-643980's screams are heard as his video feed is pulled rapidly upwards. As D-643980 is above the fountain, dozens of children’s bodies can be seen, dismembered, skinned, quartered, and partially, if not almost completely, eaten. The SCP-5853-A entities gnaw and tear at pieces of flesh as they wade through the fountain, which is now filled with blood, bone, and viscera. SCP-5853-A-5 turns to D-643980.//\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Well hello there! You're quite the hefty child, aren't you? No matter. Pray tell, what have you learned today?\n \n**D-643980:** My Name is Dave. Dave…\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** And Mr. Trenton, what did you learn today?\n \n**D-643980:** How do I respond?!\n \n**Frank Monroe:** //Monroe can be heard flipping rapidly through pages of episode transcripts.//: Umm… S01E03… Umm the lesson there was...\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** What was that my friend?\n \n**D-643980:** I... I remember, on my way here… I was told by Mr. Squibbles: “Don’t to make Mrs. Bobble upset, lest you fail his hideous test.”\n \n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Oh, my dear child, so close… You should know the consequences of your actions. You are to exist for all stars, amongst your brothers.\n \n**D-643980:** Wait. No. No. No!\n \n//SCP-5853-A-5 makes an unseen injury on D-643980 and then lifts them to the sky with the other suspended humanoid figures. Video feed from D-643980 shows that a young boy of nine to eleven years of age is suspended upside-down along with D-643980, who is also upside-down. The child is unrecognizable except for identifying clothing. The skin and muscle of show years of decay and dehydration.//\n \n**D-643980:** Jeremy!… Is that you!… Oh Jeremy! Oh, no! I… I’m sorry! No! Please! Please wake up! No! Jeremy!… Can you hear me! Jeremy!… Please.\n\n//Later investigation shows the clothing belonged to that of a Jeremy Trenton who was reported missing to the FBI and later UIU under strange circumstances.//\n \n**D-643980:** Oh Jeremy…\n \n**Frank Monroe:** D-Class?\n \n//One-minute of silence.//\n \n**Frank Monroe:** D-643980?\n \n//One-minute silence.//\n \n**Frank Monroe:** D-643980, please show sign of life.\n \n//For three days, the camera feed from D-643980 can be seen, suspended upside-down next to the body.  A continuous stream of red fluid, presumed to be blood, flows constantly over the camera lens. Of note, the volume of blood seen passing the shoulder cam of D-643980 throughout the three days is in excess of eighteen times the amount of blood found in the human body.//\n\n//The feed is terminated three days later.//\n \n**Frank Monroe:** I'm sorry, Dave.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n= ##darkred|__**Addendum: SCP-5853-A-A**__##\n [[collapsible show=\"Addendum: SCP-5853-A-A\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\nIn regards to SCP-5853, it is to be noted that UIU Agent Mathis’s son, Thomas, was returned to his personal household kitchen pantry.

I told you to not engage.\n\n**Alpha:** Fuck, Frank, there isn’t much else to do! We are cornered! \n\n//Every MTF feed records the sound of a sharp scream, followed by many more. The 3 remaining entities in the area also begin screaming. The exterior white surrounding the area dims turning black. After 4 seconds the entities stop screaming. All is quiet and black.//\n\n**Alpha:** //Quietly.// Okay command, switching to NODs.\n\n**Charlie:** Copy.\n\n**Delta:** Yes sir.\n\n//Feeds from MTF switch from black to night vision. Delta's feed peaks around the kitchen counter. No entities besides SCP-5853-A-4 are in sight within the domicile. Feed from Charlie shows the SCP-5853-A-4 entity suspended in mid air, unmoving, above the incapacitated SCP-5853-A-1 entity.//\n\n**Command:** Alpha, this is no longer an exploration mission, the objective is extraction. Priority One is to get you and your team to the Town Center, and tell SCP-5853-A-5 the key phrase. \n\n//Audio feed begins to degrade substantially, while video feedback reduces from approximately 93% to 87%.//\n\n**Command:** … Sacrifice… Chaos… Perception…\n\n**Alpha:** Command?\n\n//Command’s signals are no longer audible in the recording.//\n\n**Alpha:** Command?\n\n//3 seconds of static.//\n\n**Alpha:** Team, entities clear, evac.\n\n**Delta:** Copy.\n\n**Charlie:** Negative.\n\n**Alpha:** Report Charlie?\n\n**Charlie:** I still have an active threat in sight, Alpha.\n\n**Alpha:** What is it doing?\n\n**Charlie:** Hovering, its stationary. But… like glitching.\n\n//Feed from Charlie shows the SCP-5853-A-4 entity phasing in and out of location, appearing in both static and transitory forms.//\n\n**Alpha:** Charlie, head for the door first. Delta and I will suppress. We will follow up behind you once threat is eliminated.\n\n**Charlie:** Rodger.\n\n**Alpha:** Three… two.. one… go!\n\n//Charlie’s feed begins to rapidly move towards the interior/exterior door. Alpha’s feed emerges slightly from the dresser. Delta’s feed rises from behind the kitchen counter, the barrel of his rifle partially obscuring the frame. Both MTF feeds observe Charlie attempt to approach the door, the SCP-5853-A-4 entity returns to normal function. The entity speeds at Charlie’s head, making contact and propelling the agent into the neighboring wall. Alpha’s camera shows that the injury is instantly fatal, as Agent Charlie’s cranium appears to shatter upon impact with the wall. Alpha and Delta proceed to open fire upon the entity. The agents continue to engage fire until the entity is brought from flight to immobile on the ground. Gunfire quickly subsides.//\n\n**Alpha:** Go! Moo! Head toward door!\n\n**Delta:** Yes, sir!\n\n//Agent Delta’s feed shakes from behind the kitchen counter and towards the door. Feed from Alpha shows five claws and a shadow pass outside one of the windows. As Alpha opens the door, from the left, the SCP-5853-A-1 entity grabs Agent Delta. The SCP-5853-A-3 entity then uses it claws to tear out a large portion of Agent Delta’s abdomen. Agent Delta continues automatic gunfire upon SCP-5853-A-3 until it ceases movement. SCP-5853-A-1 screams. Last signal received from Agent Delta was of his own hands pulling the pin on an incendiary grenade, while charging the SCP-5853-A-1 entity.//\n\n**Alpha:** Moo! Fuck.  One of you fuckers left. Where are you?\n\n//Feed from Alpha shows the shadow of SCP-5853-A-2 bouncing in and out of frame.//\n\n**SCP-5853-A-2** Miss Bobble is upset… \n\n//SCP-5853-A-2 is seen from Alpha’s feed. The entity is charging at inhuman speeds. Alpha fires a grenade round from his secondary. The impact blows a hole in the entity, and it ceases to move, remaining upright in its prior charging stance. Alpha’s feed rushes across the SCP-5853-A set and exits the building. The entire area is completely black, except what can be illuminated by standard issue MTF - NOD equipment. A narrow pathway is seen, as well as a dim light in the distance.//\n\n**Alpha:** Frank, what the fuck? Well, hell, if anyone is even getting this anymore. If I don’t make it outta here, please give all my love to Jesse. Let Caleb know, his father loved him so much. Teach him to not make the same mistakes I did.\n\n//The camera feed from Alpha continues in night vision down a narrow path towards the growing light in the distance. The sound of SCP-5853-A’s theme song is notably absent.//\n\n**Alpha:** I hate Non-Euclidian shit… \n\n//182 minutes of travel goes by, and the distant light is no longer in front of the path, but above it. Alpha’s camera feed points upward, suddenly shifts, and loses focus.//\n\n**Alpha:** I feel like being pulled by something. I'm on a lower path now. Deeper, longer…\n\n//Alpha’s feed slowly brightens until the entire feed is whiteout. Second to last notable feed shows Alpha approaching the Town Square.//\n\n//Alpha’s feed goes to static for 8 minutes.//\n\n//Alpha’s feed returns, showing Alpha’s hand reaching out and opening a white wooden door. Past the door is a room with a young woman in a rocking chair. The woman is humming to an infant in her arms. The woman looks up to the camera. The woman appears to be Jesse Bazarian, Agent Bazarian’s wife.//\n\n**Alpha:** Jesse?\n\n**SCP-5853-?:** Hello... my, child.\n\n//The entity holds the infant up.//\n\n**Alpha:** Jesse…\n\n**SCP-5853-?:** See the Mirror. Through the Mirror. The Mirror is the only Salvation. Salvation achieved by sacrifice to He Who Is Divine Among the Dreamlands. Release yourself through the Mirror. Ascend through the Mirror. Transcend through the Mirror…\n\n//SCP-5853-? takes the infant-entity and holds it at arm’s length. With its left hand, the SCP-5853-? figured twists the entity’s head off.//\n\n//Alpha screams and collapses.//\n\n//11 seconds of static.//\n\n//Feed resumes. Alpha’s camera view is faced towards SCP-5853-A-5.//\n\n**Alpha:** I… I…\n\n**SCP-5853-A-5:** Terrence, what did you learn today?\n\n**Alpha:** I… Fuck you.\n\n//The metallic ping of a grenade pin release can be heard.//\n\n//The feed to Alpha is lost.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n= ##darkred|__**Recovered Site Email**__##\n [[collapsible show=\"Recovered Site Email\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]] \n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** cmiles@secure.scp.foundation\n**From:** fmonroe@secure.scp.foundation\n**Date:** 01-22-2000\n**Subject:** Resignation\n[[/div]]\n------\nTo Whom it May Concern & C. Miles,\n\nI regret to inform you that I am no longer able to fulfill my duties as Researcher. \n\nI have come to the realization that Lam was right. Although, I don’t agree with her. I can’t keep trying to save the world from the things we study. It’s not about how far I can probe. It’s for our own protection. \n\nI need to know when to call it quits. I could spend ‘X’ number of dollars and ‘X’ number lives, sacrificing to whatever… to wherever I think, or wherever I think the ‘Mirror’ may bring us, who ‘Mr. Hister’ might be, or the implications of a clown entity called ‘Bobble’. I could try to chase these down to their penultimate conclusion, sacrificing MTF, D-class and children alike. \n\nLam, she was right. God I’m sorry, Terrence. At the end of the day all SCP-5853 needs is to be hidden. In the dark.\n\nI’m sorry, I’m just not made for this. Not anymore. I can no longer do this. Let me forget. Let me go back. \n\nConsider this my resignation.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDr. Frank Monroe\n\n------\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n= ##darkred|__**O5: [STAFF RESIGNATION: DENIED]**__##[[footnote]] Amnestic wipe per **Benefit Package Protocol** is not available for this staff member, as benefits are not eligible for pending disciplinary actions and demotions.

Analysis of SCP-5853-A’s closing credits revealed that instead of staffer names, the credits consisted of a continually growing list of names. Cross-examination into both Foundation and UIU records show that all known names of children who have been reported missing due to what is believed to be SCP-5853-A's effects are listed on the credits. Cross-referencing of the credits against known missing children shows that only 17% of children listed are known to the Foundation and UIU. \n\nOf note, as of 1-23-2000, the names Robert Faulk, Mohammed Al Abi, Terrence Bazarian, and Frank Monroe have been added. \n\nFrank Monroe is currently M.I.A.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/<]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Name:** File:Theme Song & Background Music Prior to SCP-5853-1-A’s Entrance\n> **Author:** Jaykillbam\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://www.buzzsprout.com/1629802/8702184-ticky-taffy-town-aud-1.mp3\n\n> **Name:** File:Theme Song & Background Music During SCP-5853-1-A Effect\n> **Author:** Jaykillbam\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://www.buzzsprout.com/1629802/8702191-ticky-taffy-town-aud-2.mp3\n\n> **Name:** File:Fluorescent Food: Jolly Rancher Hard Candy (Blue Raspberry and Grape) - Blue LED\n> **Author:** someHerrings\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source:** https://api.creativecommons.engineering/v1/thumbs/4474a0bf-e091-43b5-bc41-28e5d462dfbd\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5852]]] | SCP-5853 | [[[SCP-5854]]] >>\n[[/=]]",
