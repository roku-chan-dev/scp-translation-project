It’s in understanding these distinctive parts in isolation that helps us shape our awareness of their marriage, and how they cooperate with one another to become their collective self.\n[[/div]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Ubuntu Mono'\"]]##3066BE|T: Weird opener but okay.##[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSure, this may be good practice, but then tell me: how do we comprehend a whole that is composed of parts unwilling to isolate themselves from the rest?\n[[/div]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Vollkorn'\"]]##721D6C|B: And I asked Master Ultan “Is it not true that there is a certain analeptic of the many-voiced alzabo that contains the entirety of the whole within a single part?”##[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Source Code Pro'\"]]##D58936|N: Nerd.##[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Atkinson Hyperlegible'\"]]##422B24|H: “lol. lmao, even,” said Master Ultan. “You absolute dumbass, Severian.
