On-site personnel are tasked with interviewing and documenting behavior of entities housed within SCP-1870.\n\n//**Update:** Per O5 directive no further personnel are allowed access to SCP-1870.  Entrances to the site have been sealed and radio broadcasts from the site have been disabled.  Any other communications received from within SCP-1870 are to be immediately deleted with no records kept.//\n\n**Description:** SCP-1870 is an underground complex located in ██████████, ██████, superficially built for the containment and transfer of anomalous objects.  Records recovered from SCP-1870 indicate a relationship with the Foundation, although the Foundation has no records of any such facility prior to the discovery and containment of SCP-1870 itself.  The anomalous properties of SCP-1870 are inherent to the location itself and its inhabitants.  Most of the objects contained within SCP-1870 are not anomalous despite extensive on-site records which claim otherwise.  \n\nSCP-1870 is populated by six to ten humanoid entities which share the following characteristics:\n\n* Constantly changing facial features, often in drastic manners which do not align with standard bilateral symmetry.\n* An understanding of Foundation policy and history that, while incorrect, is detailed enough to present a serious security issue.\n* Detailed knowledge of several contained objects and entities.\n* An outer epidermis that resembles elaborate but functionless tactical gear.  While some portions of this epidermis can be removed, doing so improperly causes great pain or distress to the entity.\n* An obsession with improvised weaponry such as gardening implements and power tools, most of which are tactically useless.\n\nWhile the entities often exhibit individual traits, a detailed accounting of their numbers or precise origins have proved impossible to keep.  Even under direct observation the number of entities within a closed room will change and some entities have been observed in multiple locations simultaneously.  Due to the fluid nature of SCP-1870 entities no permanent designations have been set to distinguish them.\n\nEntities spend their time in training exercises and performing experiments with the non-anomalous objects stored on site.\n\nExamples of the non-anomalous objects stored within SCP-1870 are:\n\n* A gallery of poorly stuffed and mounted wildlife.  Detailed records are kept on each specimen outlining a mission in which the animals were captured and contained, although the dates on the records do not match the confirmed ages of the specimens.\n* Seventeen vintage television sets.\n* Excerpts from an unpublished book on home improvement, author unknown.\n* A box of fluorescent light bulbs.\n* Living quarters for \"Doctor Steampunk,\" an inanimate suit of 17th century ceremonial plate armor with brass cogs welded across its surface.\n* A pinball machine, with erroneous records describing it as a \"Roman-era video game console.\"\n* A credenza-mounted record player.\n* Twenty-seven copies of a compilation album titled //\"Greatest Party Jams 1990\"// on compact disc.\n* A box of pamphlets titled //\"How to Keep Your Facial Features Properly Arranged.\"// Experiment records claim that subjects who read the pamphlet are capable of altering their facial features at will, but only while in possession of a pamphlet.  The pamphlets do not possess any anomalous properties at all and appear to be unrelated to the nature of SCP-1870 entities.  An example copy is kept in File Room AE2.  //(Update: Records in File Room AE2 were damaged by an environmental control failure.  The example copy was not recovered.)//\n\n**Excerpt from Interview 1870-E-4, conducted by E-class Agents D███████ and X███:**\n\n> Agent D███████: Please state your name.\n> \n> SCP-1870 entity:  Agent Redacted.\n> \n> Agent D███████: Your name is 'redacted'?\n> \n> SCP-1870 entity: Yes, \"Agent Redacted.\"\n> \n> Agent X███: Why are you carrying a power drill?\n> \n> SCP-1870 entity: For luck. I once took out fifty SCP-███ with it.\n> \n> Agent D███████: Records on SCP-███ are sealed.  What can you tell us about them?\n> \n> SCP-1870 entity: [DATA EXPUNGED] //(the answer was confirmed correct by O5. However, there have been no SCP-███ outbreaks within the last fifty years)//\n\n**Addendum:** The original personnel files for Agent D███████ and Agent X███ have been lost due to clerical error and local database corruption.  It is not known when they returned from SCP-1870 or where they were later assigned.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1869]]] | SCP-1870 | [[[SCP-1871]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
