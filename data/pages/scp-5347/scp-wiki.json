Photographic and visual evidence of SCP-5347-1 has been discredited due to its resemblence to a //Fata Morgana// [[footnote]] A type of mirage where an island or ship appears to float above the horizon[[/footnote]], and entry to SCP-5347-1 has been deemed impossible by any means outside of SCP-5347-2. \n\n--SCP-5347-2 is known only to occult groups and thus requires no special containment procedures.-- ##blue|The proliferation of an unrelated non-anomalous meme has made a part of SCP-5347-2's procedure a common phrase in certain communities, and as such has led to an exponential increase in victims of SCP-5347-2 since May 2020.## New information regarding the procedures of SCP-5347-2 should be reported to the SCP-5347 Research Head.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5347-1 is a partially-submerged island off the coast of [[[a-foul-storm-in-a-fair-land |Hy-Brasil]]]. Due to the transitive nature of Hy-Brasil itself, SCP-5347-1 has appeared at multiple locations, usually appearing approximately 3 nautical miles off the coast of a calm and temperate beach. Attempts to approach SCP-5347-1 by any form of non-anomalous travel has been deemed impossible, as despite attempting to approach SCP-5347-1, any vehicles or persons appear to move in place approximately 1 mile from SCP-5347-1. SCP-5347-1 will maintain its position for exactly 3, 5, 13, or 17 days before disappearing under heavy fog.\n\nSCP-5347-1 uniformly manifests with identical topology and size. Slight shifts, such as felled trees, fishing nets, and small signal or cooking fires indicate individuals sent to SCP-5347-1 remain active between manifestations. Sub-surface imaging has revealed [[[scp-2932 |large cocoon-like pods]]] attached to the island's coast.\n\nSCP-5347-2 is a series of thaumic rituals and triggers which, when enacted properly, teleport an individual to SCP-5347-1. The current specifics of SCP-5347-2 are unknown, though certain aspects and phrases have been identified in [[[taboo |Document Hayforth-ESHU]]]. \n\n**Findings of Document Hayforth-ESHU** was a book obtained from college student and amateur occultist Vanessa Hayforth following her 1966 entry to the **##green|Pseudonymous Timberland##**. It described several occult rituals, including some mentions of SCP-5347-2. Much of the document's mentions were unclear, but the following mentions could be gleaned:\n\n* The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be painted with ceremonial tattoos and markings. This is believed to be a purely ceremonial aspect of the ritual, as no victims of SCP-5347-2 have been known to have been painted with such markings.\n* The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be of fae bloodlines, or have had their ancestors sworn to a fae blood pact - due to the proliferation of fae geneology during the first occult war, approximately 70% of humans alive today are believed to have trace amounts of fae blood.\n* The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be within //\"three times five times 13 times 17 Deiscéim\"//[[footnote]]a classical Celtic unit of measurement, equal to 1.5 meters. 3315 Deiscéim is equal to approximately 5 kilometers. [[/footnote]] of the current manifestation of SCP-5347-1.\n* The subject sent to SCP-5347-1 must be told the exact phrase \"[[span class=\"bblock\"]]**You are going to Hy-Brasil**[[/span]]\"\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum 1\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    width=250px|\n    name=Brazil.png|\n    caption=An example of a typical SCP-5347-2 triggering image.|\n]]\n[[/=]]\n**Addendum 1:** In early 2020, a non-anomalous image macro was proliferated around the internet with unfortunate similarity to the specific trigger phrase of SCP-5347-2. Due to this, an on-going coverup campaign is in progress.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5346]]] | SCP-5347 | [[[SCP-5348]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
