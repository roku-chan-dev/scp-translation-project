After disengaging the lock and walking inside, Miller enters a large chamber. Pipage runs throughout the ceiling and walls, which extends down into a large hallway with similar bulkhead doors running left and right. Across from Miller stands Dr. Stephen House, who approaches him after stepping over yellow caution tape.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> Where have you been?</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I, uh, sorry. Traffic bogged me down.</p>\n<p><em>House scoffs.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> It's on the right, three doors down. Look useful.</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I'll try.</p>\n<p><em>Miller walks past the caution tape and approaches an already opened door. Entering inside, similar pipage runs throughout the ceiling and walls of a large residential room. On the left lays a blood-stained sofa and a messy table. The right wall is lined with kitchen counters and an island. Rats scamper from the top of the shelves above the sink. The rest of the house is equally upended.</em></p>\n<p><em>Behind the sofa lies a platform of ragged, blood-stained sheets. An unknown body lies sprawled on the platform, with Radcliffe and Greene standing nearby and conversing &#8212; the latter taking notes on a digital pad. Several other Foundation personnel are also inside the room, taking samples and recording information. Miller approaches Radcliffe.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> -there's nothing? No fingerprints? No ID&#8212;?</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[clears throat]</em> I, uh, Agent Miller. Reporting in.</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[turning to Miller]</em> Don't you know it's rude to interrupt people, agent?</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> I&#8212; yes ma'am. Sorry.</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[sighs]</em> You're late Miller. Try not to make that a habit in the future.</p>\n<p><em>Miller does not reply.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Greene:</strong> As I was saying. <em>[pause]</em> We got nothing here, not even a first name.</p>\n<p><em>Miller leans in to examine the body. Deep avulsions run across the body's torso; skin and muscle have been torn off, revealing mangled organs and broken bones. The face displays deep puncture wounds indicative of bite injuries. The entire nose and philtrum are missing, providing a vantage point directly to the back of the victim's throat. Chunks of flesh are adhered to the nearby wall by dried blood. The nose is nowhere to be found.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Do you need anything from me?</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Take a look around. You're here to help with the investigation, right?</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Yeah?</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Then investigate.</p>\n<p><em>Miller steps away from the body and approaches the small table sitting in front of the stained sofa.

Whoever this was, they definitely hung around some bad company&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>Greene:</strong> Wait, stop.</p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe and Miller freeze. Greene slowly stands up and steps away from the platform bed. After a moment, the sound of scratching can be heard faintly emanating from the far wall nearby the bed.

After a moment, Radcliffe takes aim. A single shot is fired, piercing the wall. Suddenly, a pipe erupts as steam obstructs the view of the camera. Greene and Miller ready themselves to fire. Momentarily, the group pauses before the steam clears and a small creature scurries past the new hole in the wall.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Fucking Chirst. <em>[under breath]</em> I always forget about those rats.</p>\n<p><strong><tt>[END LOG]</tt></strong></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p>Despite attempts at identifying the remains of the body discovered, Foundation personnel were unable to discern any relevant data.

Of significant concern were unverified changes to employee databases, as sudden data corruption triggered Foundation systems toward potential anomalous influences.</p>\n<p>Correlating these changes with the reports like the one listed below, Foundation personnel were able to discern that these changes were a byproduct of the <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity's anomalous properties.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"blbf-main\">\n<div class=\"blbf-police blbf-lowercase-nospaces\">\n<table style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\">\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #fcfcfc; padding-bottom: 0.5em;\"><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>CASE NUMBER:</strong></span> INC000431343</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #fcfcfc; padding-bottom: 0.5em;\"><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>DATE:</strong></span> January 30, 2025</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #fcfcfc; padding-bottom: 0.5em;\"><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>REPORTING OFFICER:</strong></span> Jeffery Tatum</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid #fcfcfc; padding-bottom: 0.5em;\"><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>STATUS:</strong></span> PENDING</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>INCIDENT:</strong></span> Unknown victim was discovered deceased in the bathroom of their home on 4465 Radbury Ln, three blocks from Golden District central markets.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n<hr />\n<p><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>DETAIL OF EVENT:</strong></span> Call initiated by an individual named Adam at approximately 19:00, just before the Greene family was about to meet in the kitchen. Adam reported walking into the bathroom to see corpse in the bathtub, wrapped in shredded shower curtains. Adam alerted other members of the house and was requested to contact the police for assistance. Dispatch was approved for Jeffery Tatum who was patrolling nearby, followed afterward by ambulances and backup officer Ryan Smith.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>ACTIONS TAKEN:</strong></span> After initial contact, all residents were evacuated from premises by phone operator. Tatum arrived within 15 minutes and located the body as it was reported by the caller Adam. Corpse was unable to be resuscitated or revived by officer. Tatum reported that TOD (Time of Death) was likely recent. Lacerations and avulsions were detected along facial and torso regions of corpse, indicating significant biting and clawing. Pain medication was discovered nearby the corpse. Officer proceeded to search the location for any signs of intrusion. Nothing of interest was detected by responding officer. Local ambulance and backup officer would arrive within the next 10 minutes to aid in retrieval and forensic preservation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"hilighter\"><strong>FOLLOW UP:</strong></span> Adam and the Greene family were submitted to local police department for questioning. No members were able to identify the deceased victim. Damage to corpse prevented any forensics officers in identifying fingerprints or significant features. DNA analysis of blood samples likewise inconclusive, but did confirm possible overdosing of over-the-counter pain medication prior to death.</p>\n<p>Family was provided with temporary shelter as further police investigation was later approved.

It is dark outside, with streetlights dimly lighting the parking lot that the recording pans from left to right. At approximately 01:00, a stray car is seen entering the facility lot, parking close to Section 14-A.</em></p>\n<p><em>After several seconds the car lights deactivate, and the cameras record a single person leaving from the driver's side. The lack of light makes discerning the identity of the individual difficult. The person observes their immediate surroundings, before quickly running east &#8212; towards Section 15-22.</em></p>\n<p><em>After several moments, the individual is seen grasping at the door of a nearby townhome. After fidgeting with the handle, the person bashes their left shoulder several times into the door, causing it to swing open. The perspective changes to the inside of a large warehouse facility, where the individual now identified as Stephen House is viewable.</em></p>\n<p><em>Panting, House begins weaving back and forth between large sections of stacked shelves sat in the middle of the facility. A faint shadow skims nearby the camera's view. House continues running between section rows and shelves, making his way towards the far end of the facility. Another entity is seen briefly once more, following behind.</em></p>\n<p><em>House makes his way into a nearby janitor's closet. He forcibly shuts the door behind him as he enters. Once shut, House grabs a nearby chair and utilizes it to blockade the door. House additionally grabs the wooden handle of a nearby mop and pushes his back to the far wall.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> <em>[Panting]</em> What do I do, what do I do--?!</p>\n<p><em>The door bangs repeatedly.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME!</p>\n<p><em>The door begins to bulge and dent as more force is applied from the other side.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> STAY AWAY!</p>\n<p><em>The door bursts open. A blur is seen before fragmentation from the door knocks out the nearby camera.</em></p>\n<hr />\n<p><em>Camera feed activates with Miller driving in an unmarked vehicle, heading west. A clock in the corner of the camera's view indicates that it is 20:22. The majority of the sky is obscured by a light cloud cover, and lights from nearby buildings illuminate the road ahead.</em></p>\n<p><em>After a few minutes, static emanates from the car radio, which Miller promptly deactivates. After several turns, Miller pulls into a vacant parking lot. As he arrives, the headlights of the vehicle power off. Miller circles the premises once before parking. He freezes as the car's engine falters, only stepping onto the pavement after several moments.</em></p>\n<p><em>Miller proceeds to withdraw his firearm from his side. From the parking lot, he travels north, to Section 15-22 of the facility. He steps onto the grass, quietly walking between two buildings until he arrives near a front door. Miller takes a moment to scan his immediate surroundings. The windows for subsequent units are notably dark, with covers obstructing any viewing inside. Miller approaches the door &#8212; he pauses &#8212; it is already open.</em></p>\n<p><em>Miller presses his body against the door, pushing it open with his weight. The door opens to a large and expansive warehouse &#8212; much larger than the exterior outside. Shelves of miscellaneous equipment and objects are stacked in rows leading from a series of three hallways, all of which lead to the opposite sidewall.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[whispering]</em> Stephen, where are you?</p>\n<p><em>Miller cautiously steps towards the central hallway, turning left into the first rows of shelves. Metal and wooden cargo boxes are haphazardly stocked between shelves in no particular order. Foodstuffs, clipboards, paper stacks, and other items are also present. Miller takes nearly a minute to walk through the first row before stepping onto the next hallway.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Are you here?</p>\n<p><em>Miller decides to walk through another row of shelves, pausing briefly to inspect one of the compartments. After finding nothing of significance, Miller exits the row from where he entered, falling back into the far-right hallway.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Steph&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>Something crashes far ahead. Miller begins traveling to the source of the noise. After approaching the end of the hallway, he takes a sharp left and sees another door ajar. Miller enters with his gun pointed. The room itself appears to be a janitor's closet. Water appears to be spilled on the floor. Miller scans his immediate surroundings. After a moment the camera pauses at the sight of a body.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Stephen!</p>\n<p><em>Miller runs to Stephen House, falling to his knees. The body itself is damaged. Unknown claw marks are viewable from the top of the upper-right shoulder and into the lower left hip. Jagged puncture wounds are visible on the hands and forearms. Exposed bone is viewable from House's left knee, with his foot turned lopsided. Miller extends his hand to feel for a pulse but is stopped by House's grasp.</em></p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> <em>[sputtering]</em> Williams?</p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Hang on Stephen, let me help you&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>House:</strong> Run.</p>\n<p><em>Something screeches behind Miller. He quickly turns around to see <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity lunging towards him. Its zipper is unlatched, exposing blood-stained teeth. Miller attempts to roll towards the right &#8212; but the creature lands on top. Entity screeches once more. Miller attempts to attack with his free hand but is unsuccessful. As he swings, <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity lunges at Miller's forearm and bites his exposed flesh. Bone crunches as Miller screams in pain. Miller aims his handgun and fires which hits the creature's neck. Entity leaps backward and howls.</em></p>\n<p><em>Miller jumps back onto his feet. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity darts right towards the sole exit, preventing Miller's escape. Miller fires several more rounds into the entity but it scales upward toward the ceiling. Miller steps back but slips from House's blood. Miller screams again as he lands on his damaged arm. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity bares its teeth before lunging after Miller. Miller shields his face with his free arm.</em></p>\n<p><em>Suddenly, a loud gunshot launches the attacker to the far wall. Miller moves his arm to see Radcliffe standing at the entrance, wielding a shotgun.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Sammi!</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You need to get out, <em>now!</em></p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe steps towards <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity and fires once more, knocking it back again.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Wait, where did Steph go?! He just vanished and I need to get him out&#8212;</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Not the time dumbass, let's go!</p>\n<p><em>Miller nods before escaping back into the warehouse, with Radcliffe following behind. From behind, <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity screeches. The duo run towards the opposite hallway and turn into Row 14. They both crouch and use the shelving as cover.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> I can't believe you're here.</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> <em>[Whispering]</em> You and me both.</p>\n<p><em>In the distance several objects crash to the floor.

We're open targets if we try to book it.</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> I&#8212; I don't know. Hang on, let me think&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>Another sound of snapping metal and falling shelves, this time closer than before.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> We don't have that much time.</p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> All right, fine! Head to the door, <em>now!</em></p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe escapes from cover, ducking back into the nearby hallway. Miller attempts to refute, but instead steps back.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> OVER HERE!</p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe unloads several more shotgun shells, but Millers camera cannot record her target. The attacker screams as Radcliffe fires. Radcliffe turns back towards Miller.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> Miller&#8212;</p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe attempts to engage another shell, but her gun jams. Radcliffe struggles to reload her weapon as <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity screeches once more.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> Sammi, RUN!</p>\n<p><em>Radcliffe attempts to reload her gun one more time before looking back towards Miller.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Radcliffe:</strong> You're not supposed to let me die like this.</p>\n<p><em>A blur tackles Radcliffe. Miller stumbles before retreating, scampering to his feet. Miller enters into the left hallway and continues retreating, holding his damaged arm close to his chest. As he crosses another row of supplies, Radcliffe screams and gargles before going silent.</em></p>\n<p><em>Miller makes it halfway before turning back, seeing <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity approach. Discolored blood drips from the entity's mouth and fingers as it runs across the hallway on all four limbs. The entity's figure begins to shake and contort erratically as it approaches, blinking in and out of the camera's view.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Miller:</strong> <em>[panting]</em> I'm so sorry, Sammi.</p>\n<p><em>Momentarily, the attacker ceases approach as Miller speaks. Meanwhile, Miller exits from the entry door and is met with a large team of MTF personnel. <strong>TATTLETALE</strong> entity attempts to resume chase but is stopped by incoming gunfire.</em></p>\n<p><strong>MTF Captain:</strong> Miller, here &#8212; now!</p>\n<p><em>Miller sprints to a nearby vehicle, which has its rear passenger door open.
