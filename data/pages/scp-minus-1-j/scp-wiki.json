This paint-like substance was approximately 20% the mass of ordinary paint. In coloration, the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance was colorless and odorless. It was approximately 100% transparent. When applied to a surface or mixed into a substance, the object was able to be seen clearly through, with the same diffraction as the surrounding environment (be it air, water, or vacuum) as if it didn't exist at all. How this process occurred is not known.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show SCP-(-1)-J-β Testing Log\" hide=\"Hide SCP-(-1)-J-β Testing Log\"]]\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a wooden plank.\n\n**Result:** Wooden plank became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //Wooden plank incinerated due to being a tripping hazard.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be stirred into water.\n\n**Result:** Water became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //Water exposed to SCP-(-1)-J-β tastes like ordinary paint water.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a sheet of lead approximately 1 meter in height and width, and approximately 5 centimeters in thickness. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for radiation blocking capabilities.\n\n**Result:** Lead became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //D-Class personnel reported feeling \"itchy\" and \"lightheaded\" while the lead sheet stood between her and a sample of Krypton-85 approximately 10 kilograms in weight. Cause of symptoms unknown.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a steel M1 helmet. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for ballistic protection capabilities.\n\n**Result:** Helmet became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //No paint flaked off of the helmet upon being shot repeatedly with pistol caliber ammunition. Helmet did appear to be dented from tactile examination. D-Class sustained concussion.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a printed copy of a memetic kill agent. After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for memetic kill capabilities.\n\n**Result:** Meme became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //D-Class tester reported no effects, save for confusion. D-Class terminated by facility guard anyway to maintain regular quota.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to the body of [[[SCP-096]]] (\"The Shy Guy\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.\n\n**Result:** SCP-096 became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //D-Class tester told to stare in the direction of SCP-096, but was not attacked. Upon the success of this test, SCP-096 has been released out into the world due to no longer posing any threat whatsoever and being completely harmless. SCP-(-1)-J reclassified to Thaumiel.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to [[[SCP-049]]] (\"The Plague Doctor\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.\n\n**Result:** SCP-049 became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //The present location of SCP-049 is unknown. Several staff have dropped dead and become zombies. It is unknown if these phenomena are linked.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:**  The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to a piece of paper containing the written designation of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2521 entity symbolized by ●●/●●●●●/●●/●] . After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for provocation ability.\n\n**Result:** Paper became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //●●/●●●●●/●●/● manifested inside of the testing chamber, became confused, and left, but not before grabbing the D-Class tester present anyway. We're pretty sure it doesn't know about this entry.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The paint was to be applied to [[[SCP-___-J]]].\n\n**Result:** The object was affected.\n\n**Notes:** Write later.\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:**  The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to approximately one pill of [[[SCP-500]]] (\"The Panacea\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for efficacy.\n\n**Result:** SCP-500 pill became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //Location of pill unknown. Possibly dropped in transfer from testing chamber.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied to the body of [[[SCP-347]]] (\"The Invisible Woman\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.\n\n**Result:** Unknown.\n\n**Notes:** //Researcher K has reported that his car keys went missing some time during the test. Possibly leakage of paint?//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of an instance of [[[SCP-363]]] (\"Not Centipedes\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction, ostensibly.\n\n**Result:** Ostensibly, the SCP-363 instance became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //Due to no light touching the instance, the instance ostensibly mutated rapidly and breached containment. Ostensibly 12 dead, and ostensibly 53 wounded. Location unknown.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of [[[SCP-682]]] (\"Hard-to-Kill Reptile\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.\n\n**Result:** SCP-682 instance became invisible.\n\n**Notes:** //SCP-682 is no longer detected, and is presumed to be Neutralized. D-Class positioned in the testing chamber also disappeared, the reason for this is unknown.//\n\n------\n\n**Parameters:** The SCP-(-1)-J-β substance is to be applied the body of [[[SCP-173]]] (\"The Statue\"). After the SCP-(-1)-J-β substance has been applied, it is to be tested for reaction.\n\n**Result:** N/A (See Below.)\n\n**Notes:** //SCP-(-1)-J has run out of SCP-(-1)-J-β for use in testing. SCP-(-1)-J reclassified to Neutralized.//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=nullvoidn]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
