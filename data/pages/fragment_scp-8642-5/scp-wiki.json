  "content": "You hear a furious rustling of papers from behind the door accompanied by muffled voices. Just as you are about to knock again, one of the doors opens and a woman’s head pops out. It’s probably attached to a body, but her long black hair is obscuring anything but her face. She gives you a quizzical look, as if she hasn’t had someone knock on this door in so long that she isn't quite sure how to respond. “Um… Hello?” She blinks at you for a moment, seemingly stunned that anyone would come down here for any reason.\n\n“Oh!” She exclaims before you can respond. “Oh, you’re the auditor!” She opens the door and ushers you inside. “Please, please, come in! My name is Hannah, and I’m the department head! Sorry for the mess! We got an email about your visit, but it’s been a long time since anyone outside of our department has bothered to come down here! Honestly, I’m surprised you didn’t just ask Greg to email you back with the information.”\n\nYou walk into a room that feels completely out-of-place at the Foundation. Unlike the sterile white hallways you just left, this large room is predominantly gray and dusty. An ugly carpet is barely visible underneath a literal maze of filing cabinets. To the left is a man sitting at a complex-looking computer setup, to the right is a small kitchenette containing a fridge, coffee machine, sink, microwave, and a large dining room table with mismatched chairs. In a back corner of the room you can just make out a trio of men going over mountains of papers: One looks like he’s writing, and second appears to be reading, and the third seems to be throwing papers and folders in random directions at random intervals. In the other back corner of the room there is another mysterious set of double doors almost identical to the ones you just walked through. The whole scene feels more like a weird business office than a Foundation department.\n\nHannah goes over to the man at the computer. “This is Greg, he’s our tech guy. I’m sure he has a spreadsheet or something with all the information you’ll need! Ummm…” she turns to Greg. “Do you?”\n\n“If I don’t, I can make it,” Greg says simply. He extends a hand toward your clipboard, and you hand it to him. He looks it over and, without turning back to you, says, “Give me a few minutes.”\n\n“Well!” Says Hannah, clapping her hands together, “that’s that! Do you have any other questions?”\n\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/8 No other questions.]||= 5||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/6 What exactly does this department do?]||\n\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _",
