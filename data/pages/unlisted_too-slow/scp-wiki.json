In the event that SCP-A403's effect intensifies to the point where the shield layers are potentially compromised, the Local Ionization Suppression Pulse (LISP) is to be activated until containment can be re-established. Should this prove insufficient, Site-190 is to be evacuated and Contingency 39-Poirot \"Swept Under The Rug\" is to be implemented as soon as possible.\n\n**Description:** SCP-A403 is a round, violet, translucent gem of unknown composition, 10cm in radius. In the center of SCP-A403 is an organic, pulsating structure that resembles a tumor. SCP-A403 constantly emits ionizing gamma radiation in unpredictable amounts, with a minumum observed intensity of 243 rads and a maximum of [REDACTED]. \n\nSCP-A403 was recovered from a raid on a Neo-Sarkic compound in the town of G████ H███ ████, California. Local cultists regarded SCP-A403 as a sacred artifact, and treasured the radioactive effect as a means to exacerbate their sacred diseases and eventually attain godhood. SCP-A403 is known among other Sarkic cults as \"The Heart of Disorder\" and \"Karcist Ion's Teardrop.\" \n\n**Addendum - EMERGENCY UPDATE:** Following an unrelated containment breach at Site-190, SCP-A403 has gone missing. Re-containment efforts are ongoing.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Briefing]]\n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **O5-11:** Thank you for your prompt response to this issue, Dr. Clef. It's only fitting that we should get our best agent on this difficult task.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** Spare me the flattery. I take it the Sarkic cults have their hands on A403 again?\n> \n> **O5-11:** I wish it were that simple. We analyzed the security footage - the thieves were agents of the Church of the Broken God.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** Problem solved.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Begging your pardon?\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** The Church hates Sarkic cults even more than they hate us. They wouldn't dare use one of their bitter enemies' sacred artifacts for their own means. It would be heresy in their eyes. I dare say they might do a better job of containing it than we did.\n> \n> **O5-11:** You may be right, but we can't take any risks. I mean, A403 is in the possession of the Church's loosest cannon by far - some Maxwellist named Father Ovum.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** What's his history?\n> \n> **O5-11:** You know [[[SCP-217]]]?\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** He invented it?\n> \n> **O5-11:** He //perfected// it. Tested it on enough squirrels and chickens that it got to the point where not only did it turn flesh into gears, but also circuits and plasma cannons. Your only advantage against him will be that you're a human - he only likes to \"bio-convert\" small animals. Reports say he gets some kind of sick pleasure from it, and his colleagues in the Church are certain he's at least partially senile.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** And I just go in his hideout, blow his brains out, and come back with a radioactive gemstone?\n> \n> **O5-11:** It won't be that easy.\n> \n> [10 seconds of silence, followed by a long sigh from O5-11]\n> \n> **O5-11:** ...who am I kidding. That was spot-on.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** Damn straight.\n> \n> <End Log>\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab A403-2499-Omega Partial Mission Transcript]]\n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> [Redacted for brevity]\n> \n> **Father Ovum:** Snooping as usual, I see.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** Get me out of these restraints or I swear to God //I will fly a fucking space shuttle down your throat.//\n> \n> **Father Ovum:** Come now, Alto, this is //holy// ground. We have to stay clean and positive here, don't we? I mean, look at the good parts of this situation: the Foundation fell for it. Clef is ours. I'll have to give myself a promotion!\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** What are you doing with the gem?!\n> \n> **Father Ovum:** \"The gem?\" Don't be stupid. Surely you mean the plural form.\n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** There's more than one?\n> \n> **Father Ovum:** You think that compulsive whiner Ion would cry only one teardrop? He cried seven, to be precise. Seven evil tears, that crystallized and formed into emblems of pure, unfiltered chaos. As soon as I destroy them, there won't //be// any disorder in this world, and everything will work as it should. \n> \n> **Dr. Clef:** And you're telling me all this... why?\n> \n> **Father Ovum:** Because the window to try and stop me has already come and--\n> \n> [Explosion.
