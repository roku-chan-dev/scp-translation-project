We had just enough time to request a weekly shipment of things we're going to need to survive - food, clean water, paper goods, entertainment, that sort of thing - and modify SCP-6137's database entry, but we are currently on a full communications blackout, and will be for... well, let's not kid ourselves, pretty much forever. \n\nSCP-6137 is currently housed in a standard Type 1 Humanoid Containment Cell, but it's allowed to visit the recreation center and mess hall as a reward for its continued cooperation, as well as to help reinforce its existence. You'll be seeing it around the site a lot, by design. We'll be making references to its existence every thirty minutes over the PA, along with twice daily roll calls for all Site-137 personnel, along with any additional names that have been added.\n\nWhen in the recreation center and mess hall, do NOT mention anyone not currently assigned to Site-137. We're not going to implement any draconian measures yet, but there are lives on the line. We will not hesitate to enforce this any way we can.\n\nIf SCP-6137 mentions the name of someone that isn't Site-137 personnel, immediately inform Drs. Nguyen or Boyette.\n\nSite-137's only purpose now is the housing and comfort of SCP-6137. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6137 is a humanoid of indeterminate gender or racial background[[footnote]]It has no visible primary or secondary sexual characteristics, and genetic testing reveals no known genetic markers for gender or race[[/footnote]], 2.1 meters tall and about 75 kilos. Its appearance is similar to a human, though with only four fingers on each hand. It is currently very cooperative with Foundation staff and has a gentle disposition. \n\nThe only known identifying marks on SCP-6137's body are a pair of similarly designed circular tattoos. The significance of these tattoos is as yet unknown. **Update - 04/07/2014:** See Addendum 6137.5\n\nAnyone learning of its existence will actively attempt to ignore, deny or forget it. From what we can tell, about an hour after learning of its existence or being reminded of such, an outside observer will in some way lose any memory of SCP-6137. It's been different in every observed instance, from contemptuous dismissal to a simple mental block. Any reminder of SCP-6137's existence will cause the affected individual to regain all memory of it. \n\nOnce SCP-6137 has learned of a sentient being's existence, if it is not reminded of them within roughly 24 hours SCP-6137 will permanently forget the being and will be unable to create new memories about them. Once SCP-6137 has forgotten them in this manner, they will cease to exist. We still remember them, there's still evidence of their existence, but for all intents and purposes they just suddenly... aren't. Admittedly, there's the slim possibility that they've just been transferred to a different location, but we're not taking the risk. (See Addendum 6137.3)\n\nSCP-6137 will become aware of any sentient being that learns of SCP-6137. Given our current circumstances, we're not exactly sure when SCP-6137 becomes aware of them, but any names it mentions will be added to the roll call in any event.\n\nA full list of the people we've lost can be found in the mess hall. Please don't make me add to it.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 6137.1 - Interview Log:\n| hide=- Addendum 6137.1 - Interview Log:\n]]\n\n> **Date:** 28/03/2014\n> \n> **Conducting Interview:** Head of Security Neill Fontaine\n> \n> **Background:** SCP-6137 had been taken into Foundation custody on 28/02/2014 after approaching a guard at Site-137 and requesting to be contained. Though no anomalous abilities were noted by Foundation researchers or SCP-6137 itself, Site Director Patrice elected to detain it regardless.\n> \n> //**Begin Interview - 16:22 Local Time**//\n> \n> **Fontaine:** So… You want to be contained. \n> \n> **SCP-6137:** Yes.\n> \n> **Fontaine:** We don't get a lot of people wanting to be contained. Very, very few, matter of fact.\n> \n> **SCP-6137:** I assumed as much.\n> \n> **Fontaine:** So you know how this looks. \n> \n> **SCP-6137:** I do. Please though, I deserve to be here.\n> \n> **Fontaine:** I don't think you do. I don't know why Patrice let you in, but as soon as we figure out you're not radioactive or something, you're getting dumped on an oil rig somewhere.\n> \n> //At this point, SCP-6137 becomes notably anxious//\n> \n> **SCP-6137:** Please, no! Please, I need to be here!\n> \n> **Fontaine:** You don't.
