I won't lie, it was a little stressful, but seeing everyone be so happy with their gifts made up for it. I'm glad I was able to continue this lovely little site tradition. However, we couldn't have done it this year without the pinch hitters! \n\nIn case you didn't know, pinch hitters are people who sign up to create more than one gift in the event someone's gifter drops out or can't make their own gift for whatever reason. This year there were more dropouts than usual, so we had to get a bunch of pinch hitters on the job. As a special thank you, I would like to take this opportunity to invite them to plug an article they enjoy!\n\nLet's see em, pinch hitters!\n\n [[*user Synthpanda_]] plugs [[[In A New Light]]], and says:\n> A short, personal tale about being lost, with help from Waltz.\n\n[[*user FLOORBOARDS]] plugs [[[stay-in-here-away-in-wet-dry-world|Where Would You Like To Go?]]] , and says:\n> I doodle myself on the water tower, a silver-grey feline against the prison-white pallet.

Could he have done anything to mitigate his fate? Were the Scarlet Fool's words so ugly as to warrant such revenge? Or was his torment simply an expression of the unspoken hierarchy?\n\n\n[[*user Harmacy]] plugs [[[mtf-theta-90-hub-page|MTF Theta 90 Hub Page]]] and says:\n> Right Angles, Life in Mobile Task Force Theta-90\" has been an ongoing series since 2014, featuring a foundation task force as they tackle anomalous geometry in the field.

So hardly anyone read it. Which is a shame, as it's my favorite entry in the series thus far. I hope you like it.\n\n[[*user J Dune]] plugs [[[SCP-6345]]] and says:\n> A fun little article about luchadores and skeletons that never seemed to capture a whole lot of attention.

As a lesbian,  I love watching hot foundation women be gal pals.

Both parties must represent different language branches of the Foundation in order for this to be considered for the contest and as an INT SCP. If you're interested in participating, head on down to the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/chat-guidelines INT Discord chat] and seek out a partner within! There are sure to be many people interested in collaborating from across many branches, so you will probably find a partner quickly.\n\nSubmission of entries to the contest will open on the 30th of January 2023 at 0 UTC, and close a week later at 0 UTC on the 6th of February 2023. Voting will end two weeks later on February 20th, at which point the winners will be announced.
