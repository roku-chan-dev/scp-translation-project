Furthermore, he has apparently employed notable thieves and criminals from historical literature to aid him; thus far Robin Hood, Irene Adler, and Ishikawa Goemon have joined his campaign. Together they form GoI-348 (\"[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wanted-the-thieves-domain | The Thieves' Domain]]]\")\n\nLupin's //modus operandi// is largely consistent: he will obtain an SCP object file, release it into the public domain, then immediately steal the object in question. Where necessary he will obtain the file during or subsequent to its theft, though this is less common as it requires significant foreknowledge, or blind luck. The items themselves seemingly have no correlation, and Lupin has not been seen utilizing the stolen objects to assist in his thefts, suggesting that his motives are either ideologically driven or to entertain himself.\n\nDespite the many differences in setting and difficulty between the Domain's current exploits and their adventures from their source material, they have continued to evade Foundation capture through a combination of skill and adaptability. It is also suspected that their nature as narrativistic entities renders the Foundation less able to deal with them, as the narrative structures they usually inhabit and are conceptually associated with typically result in outcomes in their favor.\n\nTo combat this, the Foundation has pulled an assortment of similar narrative entities into a task force: C. Auguste Dupin, Hercules Popeau, and Zenigata Heiji. Along with Foundation agent Detective Quinn Roscoe, they form MTF Kappa-16 (\"Interpol\"). As its membership is primarily composed of similarly narrativistic entities, it is believed that should any pataphysical forces be acting in favor of the Thieves' Domain, they can be overwhelmed or at least nullified by the identical forces which MTF Kappa-16 would likewise have claim to.\n\nThis file contains a semi-comprehensive list of documents related to the Thieves' Domain, as compiled by MTF Kappa-16.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-containment-of-arsene-lupin/header.png style=\"width:80%;\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**__Incident Report__**\n\n**Location:** Site-19\n\n**Relevant Objects:** [[[SCP-3567]]] (\"Chrono Wrap\")\n\n**Summary:** The first theft conducted by the Domain. The team was able to infiltrate Site-19 using credentials stolen from Site-19 by Lupin during his [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-containment-of-arsene-lupin | initial foray]]]. They disguised themselves as researchers temporarily assigned to SCP-3567 from Site-19, under the pretense that they were testing deliberate manipulation of the object's anomalous effects. Upon gaining access to SCP-3567's containment unit, Goemon applied rudimentary makeup to himself to give the illusion of advanced age, while the other members of the Domain stalled for time.\n\nUpon returning, careful to avoid displaying his face to the chamber's security feed, Goemon produced a blinding flash using unknown means while seemingly activating SCP-3567. He claimed to have indeed reproduced its effects, switching places with his future self and transporting SCP-3567 along with it, and that the flash was the result of using a lighter to burst the bubble. In actuality, he had hidden SCP-3567 on his person during the flash. The members of the Domain were able to leave the Site post-testing without interference, taking SCP-3567 with them.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"background-color: #ffffff; float: center; border: grey 4px; width: 370px; padding: 10px; margin: auto; background-color: light gray; box-shadow: 2px 2px 2px 2px rgba(0,0,0,.1);\"]]\n[[span style=\"float:left; margin-left:5px; margin-top:12px; background-color: #ffffff; padding: 0px 10px;\"]]\n[[image https://wanderers-library.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Atheme/wl_logo.png width=\"50px\"]]\n[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 1.5em]] ##grey|Three6serpent\n⁂serpentshandofficial## [[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[size 1.5em]] ##black|Have you heard about the##  ##blue|#thievesdomain####black|?

Dupin, too, seemed more at ease at this Site-91 than in the cold sterility of its palindrome in the United States; at least, until a chance encounter with a guard set a light behind his green spectacles.\n\n\"Evening, sirs,\" said the young man, and as he passed the Chevalier stood suddenly stock-still.\n\n\"Whatever is the matter, Dupin?\" I cried, but received no response. My friend's mouth moved, but no sound came out. He rubbed his temples. He sat down on the floor, and as curious onlookers passed us up, I sat down beside him to await the end of this paroxysm.\n\nDupin counted on his fingers. He shook his head. He tapped a strange melody on the wall. He plucked fibers from the ancient carpet, and arranged them in a curious sigil on his pants-leg. Finally, he laughed, shouting \"'Evening, sirs', indeed!\" and shot to his feet. Before I could ask what he had surmised, he was racing to the Director's office at top speed.\n\nThe guard was an old hand, and blameless. He had done, and seen, nothing. He was in fact only beginning his shift. But by the flawless exercise of ratiocinations I shall shortly enumerate, my friend had extracted from his innocent greeting a panoply of facts relating to the theft of an unsuspected mouldering god-carcass in a distant sub-basement before its handlers, eagle-eyed and sworn to secrecy though they were, even knew it had even been disturbed.\n\n1.

She then released its file to the public domain, copied the record's contents (//sans// its anomalous occupant), and released these as well. In an internet press release, she claimed this printing preceded all commercial imprints, and that therefore she had just effectively negated all copyright on //The Beatles// (1968), its music and lyrics.\n\nThough Foundation operatives quickly removed the press release, and lawyers for Apple Corps and Sony Music Publishing immediately pointed out Ms. Adler's lack of legal standing in this matter, a number of royalty-free performances and derivative works ensued over the next several days.\n\nEnraged at being forced to religitate ownership of his music for a third time (see Anomalous Event PoI-2011-4, \"Mecha-Jacko Incident\"), memeticist Paul McCartney began a campaign of musical attrition against the SCP Foundation which was only halted when Dr. Lillihammer of Site-43 conclusively proved that SCP-043 was never a real anomaly in the first place, citing the \"obviously bullshit and lazy-ass nature\" of its file. \"Jesus Christ, did any of you actually read it?\"\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##29CECE|**CabFever**## 02/19/2024 (Wed) 01:21:15 #63457484\n------\n\nSo, you guys know I'm kind of a big deal in Palermo.\n\nWell today that came in real, real handy. I was minding my own business, driving my taxi, when this guy dressed up real fancy jumps in, right? Only here's the thing, my doors were all closed. I was actually making good time in traffic. Guy came in through the WINDOW. He was dressed like he was going to a fancy dress party, only not a fancy dress party today, but a fancy dress party like a hundred years ago. And this guy, he tells me in a fancy French accent: \"Avaunt!\" I ask him what that means, and he yells \"Step on it!\" So, I step on it. A fare is a fare.\n\nAnd that's when this other guy shows up. Only we're moving at a pretty good clip now, so the way he shows up is, he lands on the roof. I know it's a guy because he lands real hard, dents the roof, and yells something in Japanese. The guy I'm already driving winces, and tells me to speed up. So, I speed up. I like to push the limit anyway, that's just the kind of guy I am. But the guy (the fancy guy, man, so many guys in this story!) is cranking up my windows, only he's going real slow because I still have actual cranks on my windows, and the other guy comes flying in. He's definitely Japanese, and he's pissed. \"I have you now, Loopin!\" he shouts, and he starts trying to strangle my guy. I lean back and ask if I'm supposed to stop, even though we're in the middle of traffic, and while they're beating the shit out of each other they both shout \"No!\" So I keep driving.\n\nBy now we're out of the traffic and moving along at a pretty good clip. The fancy guy is yelling \"Zenny Gata, you oaf! They're right behind us!\" and the other guy is yelling back \"//Who's// right behind us, Loopin?\" and I look in my rear view mirror and I see, no shit, a guy with a bazooka is right behind us. He's in a little yellow piece of shit Fiat, and he's taking aim, at us. So I start swerving, and whooooosh! a big nasty rocket goes flying past us, hits the guardrail and explodes. I swerve again to get out of the way, and the Japanese guy goes flying out the window he came in through. Fancy guy grabs him by the boots and pulls him back in, and they both start strangling each other again. Whoooooosh! More bazooka, and now I hear sirens everywhere, and I'm driving on the sidewalk, and people are shouting, and it's a whole thing.\n\n\"Tell me who these buyers were!\" the Japanese guy is screaming, while he throttles my fare, and I throttle up my ride. (See what I did there?) \"Who were you trying to fence it to?!\" The fancy guy shouts back \"Arson Loopin does not //fence!// I was returning it to its rightful owners when these interlopers arrived. No doubt some crime syndicate from your tech [?], still smarting over the loss of their savings!'\n\n(Before anyone asks, it's because driving is really boring. Even stunt driving. So I was listening real close, and I heard and remember everything.)\n\n\"And where is the merchandise?!\" the Japanese guy wants to know, as I hop the curb, and make a sick one eighty jump that puts my pursuers on the wrong side of the road and going the wrong way.\n\n\"Lost,\" the other guy laments. \"But ah, this is always the most boring part of any transaction. The hunt, that's where the thrill is found!\"\n\n\"Nonsense!\" the Japanese guy screams, and throws a punch that goes through my cheap seat covers. Guys have dust-ups in here all the time, what can I say? I come prepared. \"They're chasing you with a rocket launcher, Loopin! They know you have it!\"\n\nAs if in punctuation, I've heard is how you say this, Whoooosh! and a parked car just beside us goes into the stratosphere. The rocket launcher guys are back. I guess they crashed through the median.\n\n\"I hate to tell you this, friend,\" Loopin grins, \"but I was clean and away until you caught my scent. Those men are chasing //you.//\"\n\n\"What?!\"\n\nThen this Loopin guy, swear to god, levers himself up off the seat and flings himself out the opposite window. The Japanese guy whips open the door, and now our centre of balance is all off, and we're going real fast, and so we start doing donuts on the empty road. The fancy guy is off at a clip, headed for an alley, and the Japanese guy reaches into this pouch at his hip, and before I know it he hucks a coin real deadly-style at his buddy, like the way I've seen Ricky Jay used to throw cards. You ever see that YouTube video? It's crazy, guy could put cardboard right through a watermelon. I think this Loopin guy is in for a world of hurt, but then suddenly he turns at the last moment and puts up his top hat, and the coin goes flying into it, and he snaps the hat back on his head and says \"Thank you, friend, for carrying my merchandise!\"\n\nAnd then he's gone.\n\nAnd then I wrap the taxi around a light pole.\n\nI hear a radio crackle, and it's coming from the Japanese guy's belt. \"Any leads on [[[SCP-6598 | 6598]]] yet, Zenny Gata?\"\n\nThe guy kicks my door open so hard it sets off the car alarm, and out he goes.\n\nSo, there you have it. Obviously they sought out my taxi on purpose, because of my reputation as a mean driver. Who do you think's gonna play me in the feature film adaptation?[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## 02/19/2024 (Wed) 01:43:13 #63457487\n------\nprobably rob schneider because this is a heaping pile of bull shit\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##7BB3FF|**falcon_crazy**## 02/19/2024 (Wed) 01:50:09 #63457489\n------\nYou have a very picky car alarm, OP.\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"reddit-post\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: right; width: 93.5%;\"]]\n\n[[span style=\"color: #551a8b; font-size: medium; font-weight: normal; margin-bottom: 1px;\"]] Hi Reddit, I'm Arsène Lupin, leader of Thieves Domain.

Within hours he was a figure of fame and scandal in what he termed **##green|Neo-Sherwood##**, having attracted a considerable coterie of **##teal|likeminded rogues##**.\n\nThis enterprise concluded with the arrival of the remaining members of the Domain, who proceeded to abstract Hood himself from **##teal|his band of men most merry##** via **##Sienna|that lone and lonely trackway.##**\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"chan thread-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"chan-file\"]]\nFile: ##0000EE|__1544380113869.png__## (152 KB, 398x397)\n[[/div]]\n\n[[f<image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/tall-and-short-tales-of-the-thieves-domain/wojak.png width=\"230px\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"post-info\"]]\n##117743|**Anonymous**## 02/19/25(Wed)13:07:04 No.49760284\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"post-content\"]]\n##789922|>be me##\n##789922|>public domain enjoyer##\n##789922|>new public domain works? in february? not january?##\n##789922|>mfw##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"reply-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"reply-arrows\"]]\n@@>>@@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"post-info\"]]\n##117743|**Anonymous**## 02/19/25(Wed)13:15:20 No.49760463 ##000080|▶ __@@>>@@49760488__##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"post-content\"]]\n##000080|__@@>>@@49760284 (OP)__##\nwhat the fuck are you talking about op\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**__Incident Report__**\n\n**Location:** Site-43\n\n**Relevant Objects:** [[[SCP-5681]]] (\"Gehenna Arcade\" VHS tape)\n\n**Summary:** Arsène Lupin, disguised as Agent Claude Camwell, infiltrated the Site's Administration and Oversight section and disengaged the hydroelectric intake long enough for the other members of the Domain to access Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-C. From there they accessed the Site's subway system, traveling along the maintenance walkway to avoid detection until they reached the Security and Containment section. They donned Applied Occultism uniforms, and once Robin Hood successfully pickpocketed Dr. Gayle Richards' access card, they were able to access SCP-5681's containment unit.\n\nUnfortunately for them, SCP-5681 was not in its containment unit; roughly two hours earlier, Dr. William Wettle had brought a copy of //Mass Effect 4// for the Xbox One into the Section, and during a moment of distraction wherein he dropped the object, his game, and a large box of non-anomalous pears, he accidentally placed the video game into the unit and pocketed SCP-5681. Following a brief impromptu search for the object, the Domain left the Site. SCP-5681 was successfully returned; however, Dr. Wettle's copy of //Mass Effect 4// has not been relinquished.\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(/local--files/3rd-vesta-donation/MCF-7.png) center center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 3px #006c00; width: 610px; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 10px; font-family: sansationregular, cursive; background-color: #f8fdf8; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: fit-content;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ [[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]//1st Thieves Domain Donation//[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[size 130%]][[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]**Of Interest:**[[/span]][[/size]] //food, unlimited, humanitarian//\n\n[[size 130%]][[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]**Asset Summary:**[[/span]][[/size]] //As written by Director Harris, Director of the North American Manna Charitable Center//\n\n@@@@\n-----\n\n[[span style=\"color:#6BAB30;\"]]The most generous and wonderful gentleman Arsène Lupin and company have donated unto us a miracle: a [[[scp-1689|bag which houses infinite potatoes]]].

In the general confusion, Robin Hood was able to free SCP-6426 from its moorings and pilot it into the Bay of Wismar.\n\nDetective Roscoe was able to cut off Lupin's routes through Rerik, necessitating his escape into the crowd via a hastily-assembled disguise; Popeau was able to contact (apparently non-fictional) friends in the local police to instigate a jurisdictional dispute with the //Bundeswehr,// halting the attack before serious damage was done to Site DE-16; Dupin determined that the spa attacker could not be Goemon, as making light of his son's death by boiling in the late sixteenth century did not fit his psychological profile, and was able to prevent the real Goemon from accessing a local SCiPnet backup and making off with SCP-6426's file. Zenigata employed his renowned skill at coin-throwing to litter the bay with Japanese //zeni//; the vampiric craft immediately attempted to count the sinking coins, eventually plunging itself to the bottom of the bay. All members of the Domain escaped.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-containment-of-arsene-lupin/header.png style=\"width:80%;\"]]\n\nThe members of Interpol — officially, MTF Kappa-16 — sat around a table in a dingy mess hall. Their latest mission had been a narrow failure: the Thieves' Domain had managed to escape by the skin of their teeth, riding atop the giraffes used to contain the SCP object they'd managed to steal. The Site Director had yelled at them twice now; once yesterday, shortly after the mission failure, and once today, before they'd even gotten their breakfast.\n\nTheir record of success was a clean fifty percent. Perhaps the Domain was disappointed, but at least they had no higher authority to report to. Interpol, on the other hand, had just finished filing yet another report detailing how they'd once again failed to apprehend four top-level enemies of the Foundation. A fifty percent success rate represented critical inconsistency, and that was when their definition of \"success\" was as liberal as possible. If success included capturing the individuals their task force was specifically designed to catch, then they sat at an incredible zero successful missions. For lesser detectives, this would be more than enough to send them into a stressful depression.\n\nDupin slammed down a glass, and burped. \"'Breakfast is no time for alcohol,' they say. Pah!\"\n\nPopeau huffed. \"//Ouais.// I'd be inclined to agree.\"\n\nDupin shrugged in response. He poured himself another glass and downed it just as fast. Zenigata chuckled. \"Are you so troubled by yesterday's failures?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm troubled,\" Dupin sneered. \"But this is not for that. No, I've decided it to be drinking time. What with all our travels, time would have eluded me if I'd only kept track of local clocks.\"\n\n\"//I'm// tempted,\" said Roscoe. \"I'm ready to be done with all this.\"\n\nThe other three detectives looked at them. \"You must be joking,\" said Popeau. \"I can't remember the last time I've been so excited by an adversary.\"\n\n\"Please, keep your arousal to yourself,\" said Zenigata with a grin.\n\nPopeau huffed again. \"Don't mock me. You feel just the same, both of you. The thrill of the chase!\"\n\nDupin poured himself another glass, but Zenigata snatched it from his hand and raised it. \"To the chase.\"\n\nDupin snatched his glass back, but his smile betrayed a carefree mood in the moment. \"To the chase!\"\n\n\"Aye, to the chase,\" said Popeau. He nudged Roscoe, who gave a slight smirk.\n\n\"Alright, alright... here's to the chase.\"\n\nThe group laughed, and as they did an agent approached them. He cleared his throat, causing their laughter to die. They turned their eyes to him.\n\n\"Detective Roscoe,\" he said. \"I have a report here for you, regarding The Thieves' Domain.\"\n\nRoscoe sighed. \"Back at it already. What are they after this time?\"\n\nThe agent shook his head. \"Nothing to worry about at all. It's good news: they've been captured.\"\n\nThe team's faces all fell. \"What?\" they asked in unison.\n\nThe agent smiled, oblivious to their shock. \"I have the relevant info here,\" he said, setting a tablet on the table. \"Seems like this will all be put to bed soon, I hope!\" He walked away, leaving the stunned detectives silently absorbing the shocking revelation. Roscoe grabbed the tablet and began reading the report.\n\nZenigata pounded a fist on the table. \"All our work! Just for some other fools to claim our prize?\"\n\nRoscoe rubbed their chin with their hand. \"No... it's worse than that. They weren't caught by the Foundation at all.\" He held up the tablet for the rest of them to see. \"They were just captured by the Unusual Incidents Unit. They're in the custody of the US government now.\"\n\nA moment passed, then Dupin downed another drink. Suddenly, alcohol at noon didn't seem like such a bad idea to anyone.\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/wanted-the-thieves-domain | previous-title=Wanted: The Thieves' Domain!\n| next-url=/paramax-connection | next-title=Paramax Connection\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/arsene-lupin-vs-the-scp-foundation-hub | hub-title=Arsène Lupin vs the SCP Foundation\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** wojak.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Note:** This image was based on an illustration by [[*user daviiid]] originally made for [[[SCP-4991]]].\n\n\n> **Filename:** Arsoyjak2_1.gif\n> **Author:** [[*user rurascarlet]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
