Foundation operatives disguised as local law enforcement and forest rangers are to monitor the area for anything attempting to enter or leave SCP-6685. Any individual having entered SCP-6685 is to be considered lost. In the case of a subject exiting the anomaly, they are to be taken into Foundation custody indefinitely for questioning and testing. Should SCP-6685-2 exit the designated Goldilocks zone, Foundation personnel stationed at Site-74 are to initiate protocol Gaia/56B31.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6685/forest|align=right|width=55%|caption=SCP-6685-1's interior prior to containment.]]\n**Description:** SCP-6685 is a Type II extradimensional space located in a higher dimension that can be accessed via an island located in northern Canada. Two self-containing entities inhabit the aforementioned plane.\n* SCP-6685-1 is a boreal forest identical to the ones occupying mainstream reality above the 50th parallel, albeit a lack of fauna has been reported. Currently, it is believed that it extends to the entirety of SCP-6685. Furthermore, root analysis suggests that the forest maintains a collective hive-mind, similar to certain organisms in the Fungi group.\n\n* SCP-6685-2 is an entity inhabiting SCP-6685-1. SCP-6685-2 is vaguely humanoid in nature and possesses tendrils used for locomotion as well as red, plant-like fibre skin. Its head is composed of a large bulb of tissue with a visible dark spot appearing as a primitive eye. The being is extremely hostile towards all life forms non-native to the dimension.\nSCP-6685-2 can transform organic matter into wood-like fibre resembling tree bark belonging to the same species of conifers (genera Abies, Larix and Picea) present in SCP-6685-1. This is accomplished by simple visual contact of the entity with the subject, which will induce immediate cellular mitosis and DNA changes[[footnote]]It is believed that SCP-6685-2 uses a previously unknown type of electromagnetic wave to achieve this.[[/footnote]]. The transformation is usually complete in less than a minute. Furthermore, internal organs also appear to be converted into tree sap and inner bark. Over time, the subject’s body will distort and grow leaves on its higher ends, thus resembling a classical tree.\n\n----\n\nSCP-6685 has been accessible since at least the modern human era; as evidenced by an excerpt from the journal of Jean Laplante, a French colonist who unknowingly entered SCP-6685-1 in 17██. Laplante disappeared  in the area several days later. His son later recovered the journal.\n\n> And over the sunset, I saw the angel of the forest watching me, its allure driving me ever closer. I wanted to join it and let myself be consumed by nature, by the forest, yet despite my best efforts, the forest refused me. I have tried to speak to the light, yet it has never answered.\n>> //August 19th, 17██.//\n\n                                               \n----\n[[=]]\n**Addendum 1.01**\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Exploration Log Transcript**\n\n**Note:** Due to their expertise in forested areas, Mobile Task Force Zeta-6 was chosen for this operation.\n\n**MTF Designation:** Zeta-6  ''Gaia’s Angels''\n\n**Overview:** Zeta-6 was instructed to enter SCP-6685-1 to collect samples of flora and terminate SCP-6685-2. \n\n**Team Lead:** ζ6 Alpha \n\n**Team Members:** ζ6 Delta, ζ6 Charlie, ζ6 Bravo\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**ζ-6 Alpha:** Lights on.\n\n**ζ-6 Delta:** This place gives me the creeps.\n\n**ζ-6 Charlie:** Levels are normal, this place is breathable.\n\n**ζ-6 Alpha:** Command, we’re in position, you getting this?\n\n[Site command acknowledges]\n\n**ζ-6 Bravo:** It's on the scanner, 100 meters dead ahead.\n\n**ζ-6 Alpha:** Taking the samples now, after that we’ll proceed to follow it into the forest.\n\n[Zeta-6 takes samples]\n\n**ζ-6 Bravo:** 50 meters.\n\n**ζ-6 Alpha:** Delta, you got that flamethrower ready?\n\n**ζ-6 Delta:** Ready and prepped, sir.\n\n**ζ-6 Alpha:** Stop.
