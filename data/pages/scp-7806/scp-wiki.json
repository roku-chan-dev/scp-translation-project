No attempts to acquire further copies are to be made at this time. Staff are permitted to view SCP-7806 for research purposes. Requests for recreational access must be denied, and promptly reported to the Ethics Committee.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n++++ __Description__\nSCP-7806 is a Blu-Ray box set compiling episodes of //Ali's Knees,// an unaired television program purportedly dedicated to filming the knees of Swedish actress Alicia Amanda Vikander in widescreen closeup. Footage focuses on Vikander's knees exclusively. Each episode is twenty-four hours in length, and covers one full day in its protagonist's life at an unspecified date. Each copy of SCP-7806 displays Vikander's knees from a different angle. The angle will occasionally shift, and digital editing is occasionally in evidence, apparently to prevent anything other than Vikander's knees from appearing in the frame. Once the viewer has witnessed a full episode, they are required to insert the next disc into their machine to resume playback; any footage which would have been presented during the time required to perform this action will be missed. Once the full set of discs has been exhausted, the viewer is presented with a 1-800 telephone number for use in ordering the next 'season'. Each season is equivalent to one calendar month.\n\nTwo attempts have been made to call the provided number. The first returned a busy signal, and the second was blocked.\n\nDue to the tight focus, video editing, and uncertain date, confirmation of the subject's identity is impossible. No concealed cameras have been discovered in Vikander's presence, and she is unaware of the existence of this program.\n\n++++ __Discovery__\n\nThree copies of SCP-7806 and a 'burner' cellphone were recovered during a raid of an anomalous media shop in Lincoln, Nebraska on 8 October 2022. The phone contained text message records apparently representing the negotiations which resulted in SCP-7806's creation. A full transcript is provided below.\n\n[[div style=\"display: block; margin: auto; align: center; border: dashed 1px #444444; background:#f4f4f4; width: 70%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n##red|Mari McPhaerson calling dado!
