Two months into her tenure, she was involved in Containment Breach ███-████, in which she [DATA EXPUNGED] but escaped with minimal greening.\n\nIn Foundation employment, she has successfully developed containment procedures for numerous SCP objects, and acquired critical intelligence about many more. In recent months, she has spearheaded the push for more scientific openness within the Foundation, strongly encouraging as much research within her departments as is permitted.\n\nOn 12 February 2014, Dr. Elliott was involved in Incident E-31181-A, during which she and several colleagues encountered an uncontained and thereto unstudied anomalous object. Although she interacted with the object[[footnote]]See Incident Report E-31181-A and [[[SCP-2108]]] for details.[[/footnote]] more extensively and directly than any others present, the resultant anomalous properties disappeared shortly thereafter, and she was cleared for duty upon fully recovering from her injuries.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[Further data restricted. Enter 5/2108/E-46693 authorization code to continue.]\"\nhide=\"[Credentials accepted.]\"]]\nHowever, recent events indicate that this assessment was premature. On seven separate occasions in April and May, she was briefly hospitalized for acute accidental poisoning; all seven incidents appear to have been caused by plant toxins whose sources were either entirely absent or present only in quantities far smaller than apparently ingested.[[footnote]]The toxins included black walnut hull extract; caffeine, in concentrations greater than could have been ingested through any available beverage; and aconite, in sublethal doses.[[/footnote]] The origin of the toxins is unknown.\n\nAfter the fourth poisoning incident, records from the routine surveillance carried out on Dr. Elliott after Incident E-31181-A were re-analyzed, revealing that she did not apparently eat for twenty-six straight days during March and has consumed very little since then. Regardless, she remains in good health. Her patterns of food consumption are strongly inversely correlated with her exposure to daylight or comparable full-spectrum lamps.\n\nTaken together, these phenomena suggest that Dr. Elliott acquired anomalous properties during the SCP-2108 incident, which have persisted and strengthened since. Proceedings to classify her as an SCP object were filed in June 2014, but have since been postponed indefinitely pending O5 review and a deposition from Dr. Elliott (E-46693) herself.[[footnote]]Dr. Elliott's personal account is to be written with a specific focus on potential utility; ref. Document 84495-Qoppa, \"Last Best Hope: Proposal, Mobile Task Force Alpha-9.\"[[/footnote]] Dr. Elliott's mental health and productivity are to be monitored in the meantime; she is aware of her status, and reports considerable anxiety connected with her uncertain future.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n**Note:** //Personnel concerned with approving Dr. Elliott’s requests for close examination of SCP objects should note that she displays a worrisome degree of tactile curiosity. Unless you want to have her literally poking your Safe-class item, or sniffing at a Euclid, exercise caution. At least she has enough sense not to risk it around the really dangerous ones.// -- ███ █████\n\n------\n\n**Note:** //Dr. Elliott is reminded, again, that she is not entitled to keep plant-based SCP items or derivatives thereof in any part of her workspace without due authorization, especially when the item in question is extremely toxic. No further infractions will be tolerated.// --Dr. M. Vogler\n\n//It’s a perfectly normal// [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/Actaea-pachypoda.jpg Actaea pachypoda]//, not an SCP!// --Dr. Elliott\n\n//Whatever it is, get it out of your office. I don’t want to find it in the break room, or in my coffee. I saw what happened to Kyle.// --Dr. M. Vogler\n\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block name=photosynthetic-by-sunnyparallax.jpg|caption=[https://scp-wiki.net/light-dependent-reactions Soon, love.
