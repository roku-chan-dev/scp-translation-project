Entry roads are to be barricaded and patrolled. Satellite surveillance is to monitor for unauthorized entry. Any civilians attempting to access SCP-8179 are to be intercepted, detained, and administered Class-B amnestics.\n\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-8179 are to be fully briefed on the nature of the anomaly. No individuals unaware of SCP-8179’s effects are permitted to approach or traverse the designated road.\n\nDescription:\nSCP-8179 refers to an anomalous phenomenon occurring along an approximately ██ km stretch of rural road in central Wyoming. When a vehicle is driven on this road by an individual **unaware** of SCP-8179's properties, a standard U.S. Department of Transportation stop sign (designated SCP-8179-1) will spontaneously manifest somewhere ahead of the vehicle.\n\nSCP-8179-1 is only visible to those who are unaware of the anomaly. Individuals who have been briefed or otherwise informed of SCP-8179 will not perceive SCP-8179-1, nor will it manifest for them under any circumstances.\n\nIf a subject passes SCP-8179-1 at a speed exceeding 10 mph (16 km/h), one of two outcomes occurs:\n\n- **Outcome A (Approx. 75%):** The subject immediately experiences total neurological and cardiac shutdown. Over the next five hours, the subject's body will undergo a full transformation into a physical stop sign identical in appearance and composition to SCP-8179-1. The transformation affects all biological material and appears to be permanent.\n\n- **Outcome B (Approx. 25%):** The subject remains physically unaffected but will develop escalating psychological symptoms within 24 hours, beginning with generalized vehicular anxiety. This condition progresses into a phobia of all forms of travel, often culminating in suicide within 1 to 3 months. Class-C amnestics have been partially effective in delaying symptom progression, but not in full reversal.\n\nThe precise mechanism behind SCP-8179's selective visibility is unknown. Attempts to capture SCP-8179-1 on camera or other recording devices have consistently failed unless the operator is unaware of the anomaly, in which case the footage is corrupted or lost shortly after capture.\n\nThe transformation process begins within 10–15 minutes post-mortem, with initial rigidity in limbs and a graying of the skin. Over the following hours, tissue appears to calcify, then convert into metallic compounds structurally similar to aluminum alloys used in standard street signage. Hair and eyes are among the first tissues to dissolve, replaced by layers of reflective coating identical to that found on Department of Transportation-approved signage.\n\nBy Hour 3, the subject's arms and legs elongate and flatten, merging into a disc-shaped sheet that curves into the octagonal form of a stop sign. Internal organs liquefy and are replaced by solid-state reflective plastic. The process concludes by Hour 5, with the subject's neck and head stretching vertically into a cylindrical pole composed of fused vertebrae and metallic sinew. Final height and signage orientation are consistent with road signage regulations.\n\nSubjects remain completely inert throughout the process. No neural or cardiac activity resumes at any stage.\n\nAddendum 8179.3 – Test Log 02: Dashcam Experiment\nDate: ██/██/20██  \nSubject: D-97321  \nProcedure: D-97321, unaware of SCP-8179’s specific effects, was instructed to drive a standard Foundation-issued sedan along the affected stretch of road. A high-definition dashcam was mounted to the windshield and remotely monitored by researchers in real-time. D-97321 was told only that he was testing new \"automated signage recognition software.\"\n\nResult: At 1.2 km into the drive, D-97321 verbally acknowledged seeing a stop sign \"in the middle of the damn road.\" At this point, vehicle telemetry indicated a speed of 32 mph. Eight seconds later, all biometric readings ceased abruptly.\n\nDashcam footage froze exactly 0.4 seconds after SCP-8179-1 came into frame. Data loss was immediate—camera memory and backup drive contained only static and corrupted fragments. Local wireless transmission was also irretrievable.\nBefore the 0.4 second delay of Data Loss, 3 Frames were transmitted to Researchers and is Displayed Below:\n\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n|name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8179/stop.jpeg\n|caption= SCP-8179-1\n|width=300px\n]]\n\nRecovery teams located the vehicle idling in the middle of the road, driver's door open. In the passenger seat, a partially-formed stop sign composed of calcifying human remains was found fused into the seat and center console. One hand—still flesh—gripped the steering wheel. Transformation concluded approximately 3 hours later.\n\nNotes:  \nDr. ██████: \"We now know visibility isn't dependent on mechanical or digital sensors—it's cognitive. The sign appears in the mind and is **erased** as soon as the subject becomes aware of its anomalous nature. We also now know the body doesn't just **become** a sign. It **is** the sign. Sentient or not, that’s horrifying.\"\n\nAddendum 8179.4 – Interview Log 05\nSubject: D-83455 (Survivor Case)  \nInterviewer: Dr. Langford  \nDate: ██/██/20██  \nNotes: Subject was exposed to SCP-8179 during Test 04. Despite exceeding the 10 mph threshold, subject did not undergo transformation. They were brought into containment for psychological observation.\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nDr. Langford: Morning. How are you feeling today?\n\nD-83455: *[Long pause.]* I didn’t sleep again. Every time I close my eyes I hear it. That… *pop.* Like a balloon, but wet. I didn’t even see the sign, y'know? Just—next thing I know I feel cold and my heart's pounding like it wants to leave me behind.\n\nDr. Langford: You mentioned \"the pop\" yesterday. Can you describe that more?\n\nD-83455: It's like... the air gets thick and then something *snaps.* Not loud. Just final. I swear I see something in the rearview mirror every time I drive in my dreams. Just a red octagon. Watching.\n\nDr. Langford: Have you had any thoughts of hurting yourself since our last session?\n\nD-83455: *[Nods slowly.]* But not because I **want** to die. It’s because I don’t want to go anywhere anymore. It’s not just cars now. I can’t even step outside without looking over my shoulder. Like it’s gonna be there. I **know** it can’t be, you told me that, but it feels like it’s just waiting for me to forget.\n\nDr. Langford: You're safe here. You haven't left the facility since the event.\n\nD-83455: *[Looking down.]* That’s what worries me.\n\n[END LOG]\n\nPost-Interview Note: Subject was moved to high-security psychological care following the session. Approximately 72 hours later, D-83455 was found unresponsive in their cell after apparently rupturing a femoral artery with a piece of sharpened plastic from a food tray. No sign of forced entry or anomalous activity detected. The phrase **\"I stopped\"** was written in blood on the wall behind the bed.",
