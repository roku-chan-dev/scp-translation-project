There is a very small possibility that you have heard whispers about us, especially if you were already with the Bureau. Some of you may even be from one of the many Free Ports that we oversee, and in that case you've definitely heard of us. However, If you're unfamiliar with who we are and what it is that we do, we handle the preservation of normalcy in the United States and contend with all manner of paracriminal activity— from disrupting the sale of anomalous drugs, to the interdiction of dangerous artifacts. Occasionally,  we even arrest the odd cult leader or individual with irregular abilities. We have a wide range of capabilities that you will all come to know, but our biggest undertaking is the preservation of the world as the public know it. Convincing the public that the very things we are contending with do not exist is no easy task, so I urge you all to read the following very carefully as it will assist you in your duties as a Special Agent with the Unit.\n> \n> Since the birth of the Bureau of Investigation's Occultism Repression Bloc in 1910, with a strength of only 15 men, we've grown immensely under the banner of the Department of Justice. We enforce federal law in freeports such as Three Portlands, administer Paramax, and forge stronger relationships with allied organizations in countries such as France, England and Canada. Keep in mind that we don't take orders from anyone but the President and our direct superiors. If someone tries telling you how to do your job and they don't work for the DOJ, you tell them where to go and how to get there. That being said, organizations outside our fold, the fold of any government for that matter, will often offer up sound advice or actionable intelligence. Hear what they have to say, but understand that they aren't interested in your survival or what's best for national security.\n> \n> After you leave here today, some of you may be assigned to tactical field work, such as our vaunted Mobile Occult Operations Teams, while many of you will move on to work investigations, cyber paracrimes, things of that nature. Regardless, it's important that you know about the bad actors out there and the terminology we use to describe them. Cults, terror groups, organizations from adversary nations, black market traders and cartels, some secular, some fanatically religious. All would likely prefer to see you dead. Some of the terminology we use sounds a little dated, but at this point it's tradition, and you'll hear it often in your work. Below, you will find a list of common codewords and phrases we use to describe organizations, entities and artifacts that exist behind the veil. Also included is a list of departments within the UIU that you will all work alongside. Good luck to every single one of you. Remember that we must remain steadfast in our dedication to the protection of our nation, our countrymen, international rules based order and worldwide democracy. Your unwavering commitment to our mission will never go unnoticed, and I have never been more proud to call you all my colleagues. The American people can sleep soundly every night because patriots like you answer the call for this silent burden.\n> \n> Faithfully yours,\n> \n> Executive Assistant Director William Doucet\n> FBI Unusual Incidents Unit\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Common Phrases]]\n__**CART.**__ Refers to any inanimate, non-sentient object that exhibits anomalous properties. For example, a statue that compels individuals to pray to it through a cognitohazard ultimately causing them to starve or dehydrate. Often, we use these objects to assist in our mission. This is especially true among our field and critical incidents agents.\n\n__**CAN.**__ Refers to zones of anomalous activity. This can include any structure with non-Euclidean architecture or neighborhoods where the entire population is seemingly infected by a memetic hazard. A Cart can often create a Can, spreading its anomalous influence over a wide area, and, in some cases, a Can can generate new Carts. \n\n__**CAN MEN.**__ The most dangerous entities that we handle by far. This term refers to humanoids that exhibit anomalous properties. Some of you here today may be thaumaturges, particularly our folks from Three Portlands, so you can understand how dangerous that power can be in the hands of a sapient entity that only wishes to do harm. These entities are sometimes capable of bending reality itself or even channeling the power of deities to complete their objectives. For obvious reasons, Can Men are our number one priority, often requiring assistance from other agencies or from our capable friends in the Department of Defense. Remember, we aren't the only ones on the team, and this fact will be covered shortly within this dossier.\n\n__**VEIL.**__ A phrase that holds two definitions within the FBI and the larger US government lexicon. The first refers to the metaphorical \"veil\" between the general public and the knowledge of the anomalous world. It is the goal of you all to maintain that veil and uphold the status quo of normalcy that allows society to continue functioning. The second definition refers to a clearance level within the United States government. I am sure you are all familiar with this SCL, as you all had to receive one to work here. Placed above TS/SCI, only granted after stringent testing for loyalty to the United States, upstanding moral character, no history of drug abuse or criminal behavior and the signing of a document that ensures information security through the use of a memetic agent, a VEIL Clearance allows US Government employees to access knowledge of the anomalous world, effectively lifting the metaphorical \"veil\" for these individuals.\n\n__**FREEPORT.**__ Also referred to as a \"nexus\" by some organizations, a Freeport is any location typically only accessible through anomalous means, or in a way that reveals the existence of the anomalous to ordinary civilians. Freeports house large populations of anomalous individuals and often contain independent governing bodies, infrastructure, unique cultures and subcultures, and in some cases, organized military, police forces and education systems. One example is Three Portlands, of which many of you are current or former citizens. While the FBI plays a direct role in the protection, law enforcement and judicial processes of this particular Freeport, this is not always the case. One example is the Mexican Freeport of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7269 Ireta K'eri], which is overseen in part by CALMECAC (Mexican Armament and Logistic Command for the Control of Unnatural Menaces). Freeports offer a unique, sometimes difficult diplomatic challenge for the FBI UIU and the United States, often requiring us to balance the preservation of normalcy with upholding civil and individual liberties for the anomalous inhabitants of these locations.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Government Organizations]]\n__**SILVER CORD.**__ While 'Company' is still used to refer to the CIA broadly, this term is primarily in reference to the CIA's Directorate of Occult Operations. While we're sure the CIA operates many covert programs involving the anomalous, this is their outwardly facing department within the agency that consistently deals with us. They will often share intelligence with us when an investigation requires it, and request for our Agents to attach to them when necessary during domestic operations, although their mission is focused primarily overseas. \n\n__**TARTARUS.**__ Paranatural Warfare Command, often referred to as Pentagram colloquially. These are our friends in the Department of Defense. Paranatural Warfare Command is structured as a functional combatant command, similar to Joint Special Operations Command. It is not often that our services are required by the DoD, but we will often assist them in apprehending threats to normalcy abroad so that these perpetrators can face justice in the United States. Much like the CIA, The Pentagram will also offer us assistance when we need it through a human and signal intelligence collection apparatus that is second to none. Personnel within The Pentagram are often tight lipped about their own operations, as their compartmentalization is even more apparent than our own. As frustrating as this stonewalling may be, it is important to remember that we are on the same team and serve the same mission of upholding democracy at home and abroad.\n\n__**SNOWMEN.**__ The DEA's Paranarcotics Division, sometimes referred to as the Anomalous Drug Enforcement Administration. As partners in normalcy and law enforcement, we work very closely with Special Agents of the DEA, intercepting trafficking operations and working to counter the spread of paranarcotics; especially those proliferated through Free Ports. The FBI UIU and A-DEA operate several Joint Task Forces, often shadowing mundane teams, and primarily conduct arrests and raids in the Americas and the Free Ports found within them. Despite their primarily domestic mission, it is not uncommon for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-snowman DEA Special Agents to attach to international teams to assist in joint takedowns.]\n\n__**PEACEKEEPER.**__ This is used to refer to members of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition and their four member organizations. A largely military and diplomatic organization, it acts under the purview of the United Nations, but the Security Council seemingly exerts little control over their actions when compared to the influence exerted by member organizations. Beginning at the end of World War 2, the UN Global Occult Coalition has made attempts to fold the UIU into their ranks, however, due to the potential national security risks this could pose, these attempts have been resisted by the FBI and United States government at large. On paper our organizations work together to preserve normalcy both at home and abroad, however, it is not often that the FBI has to coordinate with any element of the United Nations, let alone the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n__**NETWORK.**__ Used in reference to the General Assembly of Abnormal Police (PANGEA), a multinational police organization similar in function to the mundane INTERPOL and formed during the height of the Cold War in response to interference by the GOC and SCP Foundation into national affairs. This alliance served as the veritable nail in the coffin for any hope of global hegemony for organizations not working at the behest of a national government. As a member organization, the UIU works closely with PANGEA to share information on global threats to normalcy, and coordinate policing efforts with its 54 member agencies such as the French National Gendastrerie, British Occult Service, South Korean National Paranormal Emergency Service and Japan's Special Affairs Division.\n\n__**RED SERGE.**__ A less than subtle reference to the red coats worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, this term refers to the RCMP's Occult and Supernatural Activities Taskforce. This small but capable branch of the RCMP has become a vital partner to the FBI in preventing paracrime. These officers have a vast swath of ground to cover in the Great White North, and the United States government will routinely offer them support through the use of our assets. While no exchange is necessary, the RCMP OSAT returns the favor by actively monitoring the many points of entry on the border between the US and Canada, freeing up more manpower for the Bureau and allowing us to take a more proactive role in preventing paracrime.\n\n__**TRICOLORE.**__ Refers to officers of the French National Gendastrerie. Our counterpart in the French Republic and close partner in maintaining the integrity of the veil. Both the UIU and Gendastrerie consistently share intelligence, and work together to break up international paracriminal networks, shut down websites used for cybercrime and the sale and trade of illegal anomalous substances. One of their 20 overseas postings is hosted in Washington D.C.\n\n__**RED ROSE.**__ Used to refer to members of the British Occult Service, colloquially referred to as MI666, the primary normalcy agency of the United Kingdom and known member of the GOC's Council of 108. The British government is a close ally of the United States and a partner in preserving the integrity of the veil, and to this end, works closely with our agents to apprehend paracriminals, suppress public knowledge of the anomalous and even assists with our protection and policing of Three Portlands.\n\n__**REDEEMER.**__ Refers to the Federal Occult Security Force of Brazil. This agency falls under the National Public Security Force, and is the official successor to the Superintendence for the Paranormal which operated under the military dictatorship. The Federal Occult Security Force is a vital South American partner in maintaining normalcy— a light in the metaphorical tunnel that is navigating Veil enforcement south of the border.\n\n__**GUARIA.**__ A nod to Costa Rica's national flower, a purple orchid. This term refers to the Central American Normality Institution, known as INCA, a collective of representatives from every Central American nation who support one another in an effort to protect the public from the anomalous. The organization is very small, and relies heavily on support from the United States. Our partners in the DEA play a vital role in supporting INCA, and sharing intelligence. We assist both agencies in the fight against paranarcotics trafficking that is prevalent in the region, often shadowing mundane narcotrafficking routes to distribute primarily in Free Ports.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Adversarial Government Organizations]]\n__**URSA.**__ The Russian word for 'bear' is used to refer to the FSB-P, an organization within the Russian Federation that (on paper) is similar in function to the FBI UIU. Consistent diplomatic contact was only formally established in 2009, after the FSB-P was granted a seat within the PANGEA Network. Since then, we have uncovered several intelligence collection operations on US soil, and the FSB-P remains a major thorn in our side when it comes to cybersecurity and information protection. Also a glaring issue is the FSB-P's ability to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/casefileforsimferopol rapidly detect and reclaim SCP Foundation sites] that were hastily evacuated after crackdowns by the Russian government, leaving an untold number of anomalous artifacts that are now in the hands of the agency. Allegedly, PANGEA Network systems have also been prodded by the FSB-P since their affiliation with the Network, however these claims have been outwardly denied by the Russian Federation who deem the accusations as baseless. FSB-P operations uncovered through counterintelligence should be immediately reported to your SAC. The threat posed to our national security by this agency should not be underestimated.\n\n__**BLACK WINDS.**__ A reference to a type of yāoguài in Chinese mythology that excel in making people disappear, this term is used in reference to the Paranormal 19th Bureau; a branch within the PRC's Ministry of State Security that handles all matters behind the veil. The 19th Bureau are experts at uncovering intelligence operations in the mainland, quickly, covertly and sometimes violently dismantling them. Their agents have been identified as having preternatural abilities, with the capacity to show up on our radar and drop off just as quickly. It is hypothesized that they possess one or several anomalous relics that grant them these abilities, or through the use of rituals that have yet to be identified. When located, their operations on American soil and within allied countries are often complex, extensive and hard to identify; routinely making use of religious institutions and shell companies. The 19th Bureau is a major national security threat, and interrupting their operations remains a top priority for UIU counterintelligence.\n\n__**ATAR.**__ In Zoroastrian mythology, this word represents the concept of holy fire. In the FBI, we use it to refer to the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts, a semi-autonomous agency operating on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran. While they enjoy some degree of independence, they are largely controlled by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Much like Zoroastrianism did at it's peak, ORIA sprawls over a massive sphere of influence in the Middle East, Asia and Africa. ORIA primarily focuses their efforts on regional dominance, though they are known to fund and arm several known FIREWORK cells throughout the globe. Many of the agents working at the behest of the organization are CAN MEN which their brass refer to as 'djinn', powerful reality benders that should not be approached when encountered in the field. In the United States, ORIA presence is slim, instead utilizing proxies or cyberattacks to interrupt our operations and undermine the American government. Apprehension of ORIA agents and their proxies remains a very high priority.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Non-Governmental Organizations]]\n__**SKIPPERS.**__ Refers to the SCP Foundation. This term has been utilized by the FBI UIU for decades to refer to members of the Foundation and the Foundation itself, while the anomalies catalogued by the organization are referred to as SKIPS. The Foundation has routinely interfered in our operations throughout the decades of their existence, although their influence remains mostly concentrated in developing nations where their operatives are harder to track and detain. While their mission to secure and contain anomalies in an effort to maintain normalcy aligns similarly with the goals of our organization, they go about this mission with little regard for international borders, geopolitical implications, and the wishes of state agencies and national governments. As such, their actions have been deemed incredibly reckless, antithetical to international rules based order and wholly against the interests of US national security. Should you encounter a Foundation operative during the performance of your duties, report their presence to your SAC. Foundation operatives are stateless actors, typically utilizing false identities, often working in the United States on fraudulent visas. Their detainment, questioning and potential arrest is paramount should you encounter them.\n\n__**BENEFACTOR.**__ Refers to the Manna Charitable Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian group. The organization focuses their efforts primarily in developing nations, where anomalous individuals face many challenges to meeting their daily needs, remain at risk for violence or are forced to flee through external sources such as war. The exact structure of the MCF, as well as how they obtain their funding and resources remains largely a mystery. Considering their work mostly consists of aid to underserved nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, their operations are largely in the wheelhouse of the United States Armed Forces and the wider Intelligence Community. MCF operations in the western hemisphere are few and far between, although their volunteers have been routinely spotted in Three Portlands, where they maintain a small office and an even smaller presence. Through this office, they collect donations and take on volunteers. As of time of writing, this is the only office currently known to the FBI UIU. Reports compiled by the CIA have indicated that the MCF has worked both with and against the UN Global Occult Coalition, though the exact details of these reports remain sealed to anyone outside of Langley.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Hostile Organizations]]\n__**FIREWORK.**__ This refers to any loosely organized terror cell that utilizes anomalous artifacts or entities as weapons. During World War 2, this term briefly referred to a splinter group within the SCP Foundation that (according to all intelligence we have gathered), was entirely destroyed following a violent rebellion. Today, this term mostly applies to Foreign Terror Organizations who seek to advance their interests by any means possible, even if their methodology includes mass casualties and the total destruction of the veil of normalcy. These groups are often funded wholly or in part by state actors, who enable their operations to undermine US, or more broadly, western interests. The FBI UIU plays a vital role in uncovering the existence of these organizations through our staunch counterintelligence operations.\n\n__**CAN COLLECTION.**__ We use this to refer to the Serpent's Hand. Any agents from Three Portlands are likely familiar with that name. They're mainly interested in making the anomalous public knowledge, so you can see why we recurring issues with their operation. Members are mostly CAN MEN themselves; mages, regenerators, things of that nature. They also do a pretty solid job of protecting the Wanderer's Library, which is a whole can of worms that you'll likely learn about once you get to your assignments. We try to only nab ones that are causing a big stir. A heavy handed approach to their operations could agitate the population of Three Portlands and other Free Ports that the United States government oversees. As such, it remains a priority to detain and arrest members of the Serpent's Hand who are threatening the Veil. Killing, as with any time the use of force continuum is utilized, should remain a last resort to protect the life of agents and civilians.\n\n__**CARNOMANCER.**__ We use this to refer to the many sects and lodges of the Sarkic Cults, both proto—who typically live rural lifestyles throughout Europe and Asia, and neo—who often embed themselves in more modern societies. These reprehensible flesh cultists follow the teachings of the messianic Grand Karcist Ion, and only seem interested in making the rest of the world suffer for it. They're extremely dangerous, capable of creating and manipulating living organisms through anomalous means, bending flesh to their will. Should you uncover a follower of any sect through your investigations, immediately report them to your superiors. Do not attempt to apprehend them alone. Since the birth of our precursor in 1910, we have had many encounters with secret societies utilizing false doctrine to cover up Proto-Sarkic activities within the United States. As such, Proto-Sarkic cults remain the larger threat of the two, as far as public safety is concerned.\n\n__**WARHOL.**__ Aptly named this by our Special Agents pursuing their many disparate but loosely organized cells through the 1960's, the famous pop artists last name refers to members of Are We Cool Yet?[sic]. These anartists generally abhor any authority, and will often utilize dangerous anomalies in their publicly displayed artwork with a focus on urban settings and areas with a high volume of civilian traffic. Tracking any member of this organization poses a massive challenge to normalcy enforcement organizations, as their lack of any distinct hierarchy or leadership structure makes conventional investigation and intelligence gathering nigh impossible. As such, members of this group are handled on an individual basis, unless deemed to be working together with one or more anartists. More important than apprehending any one anartist is ensuring their displays are promptly destroyed or removed from public view. Whatever message they are trying to spread, it often involves mass casualty events, sewing death and chaos to any unfortunate pedestrians that happen upon their displays. Of note is their increasing targeting of government offices and infrastructure. Agents should remain vigilant for their handiwork, especially during times of political upheaval or social strife.\n\n__**BLOODPOOL.**__ [This description has been removed from all relevant documentation, pending reclassification.]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Location Index]]\n__**PARAMAX.**__ The United States Penitentiary, Paranormal Administrative Maximum Facility is an ADMAX Federal Prison. Housed within an artificial orphan universe, PARAMAX houses the most dangerous and elusive paracriminals known to the UIU. While administered by the UIU, PARAMAX houses any inmate that is apprehended by Pentagram, A-DEA and any other Veil facing agencies of the United States. For more information on PARAMAX, please refer to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/paramax#toc0 full dossier.] (Editors Note: There appears to be an error within the dossier regarding an SCP Foundation Lunar containment site and a UNGOC Farpoint Station. Neither of these locations have been identified through any US intelligence gathering efforts. If the SKIPPERS had a site on the moon, we would know about it.\n\n__**NCB INTERPOL.**__ The National Central Bureau INTERPOL in Washington D.C. is used as a meeting/planning hub for the UIU, PANGEA and the many organizations within the NETWORK. A small office, tucked within the large property is utilized for high level discussions between heads of member organizations; providing security to visiting dignitaries by hiding them in plain sight. This is not to be confused with the INTERPOL General Secretariat building in Lyon, France, which is used only for hosting high level diplomatic meetings.\n\n__**FLORIDA IRREGULARITY VAULT.**__ The [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-file-1997-024 Florida Irregularity Vault], sometimes referred to the 'The Fur' and 'The Vault', is a facility in Miami, Florida used to house low threat paracriminals and artifacts. The facility itself is located under the FBI Miami Field Office, the entrance obfuscated by thaumaturgic wards. Agents may only access the Vault through special permission from their SAC's, and may only do so for the purposes of inmate transport/processing, checking in new CARTS and checking out CARTS for use in active investigations. Security of the facility relies partly on the handful of agents that work within the Vault itself, but largely on the size and manpower of mundane Special Agents in the Miami Field Office. An identifier for personnel working in the Vault has been designed by our talented multimedia specialist, Special Agent [[*user JNLoopy]]\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/LyGjkBO.png width=\"400px\"]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Mobile Occult Operations Teams]]\n//The vaunted **Mobile Occult Operations Teams** are structured similarly to the mundane Critical Incident Response Group teams, highly specialized and primarily divided by region. They are a vital tool in the toolkit of the Unusual Incidents Unit, ready to assist our field agents at the drop of a hat with their expertise in firearms, tactics, occultism, religion and many other focuses.//\n\n||~ Key terms: ||\n\n|| Enhanced - Denotes a MOOT that must cover a larger or more populated area and/or serves a more specialized purpose.

A child agency of the US Bureau of Indian Affairs, the team shares a special relationship with the BIA's Office of Animism and Pre-Columbian Theology, which is responsible for researching and cataloging Native American religions and their links to paranatural occurrences. The BIA Office is incredibly understaffed and underfunded, requiring the MOOT Team to conduct most of their field research and interaction with the large Native population of Alaska. Alongside this special relationship, the team specializes in arctic survival, with a focus on mountaineering, long range hiking, off-road driving and long range combat.\n\n__**Delaware - MOOT \"Blue Hens\":**__ A small contingent of agents in the Wilmington satellite office, these agents work closely with the Baltimore and Philadelphia Field Offices. Like most other teams, these agents perform their duties as conventional CIRG SWAT when not handling UIU calls. Historically. these agents specialized in handling CBRN threats that arose from dangerous experiments conducted by chemical production companies in the state. Today, these agents primarily investigate paracrime related to the many businesses incorporated in the state, rooting out potential exploitation by Veil organizations and raiding them when necessary to secure evidence.\n\n__**Idaho - MOOT \"Spud Guns\":**__ Operating out of the Boise Field Office, these agents are mostly conventional field agents pulled in to perform UIU duties when absolutely necessary. While this team has a handful of federal psions, it mostly consists of herbomancers. Skilled in agriculture, many coming from long lines of farmers, they are experts at manipulating plants through rituals and thaumaturgy. While relatively small compared to other teams throughout the country, they must perform the vital task of protecting America's.\n\n__**Montana - MOOT \"Big Sky\":**__ Based out of the Missoula FBI satellite office, this team primarily consists of conventional SWAT agents pulled from mundane FBI teams in the Midwest and even local law enforcement in the event of catastrophic incidents. Over half of the team consists of Blackfoot, Sioux and Cree Native Americans, recruited specially for their generational skills in tracking, outdoor survival and expertise in Pre-Columbian rituals/magic. Although not under the direct tutelage of the US Bureau of Indian Affairs like their brother team in Alaska, team \"Big Sky\" does work very closely with the BIA's Office of Animism and Pre-Columbian Theology.\n\n__**Pennsylvania - MOOT \"Brotherly Lovers\" (Philadelphia)/MOOT \"Steel Curtain\" (Pittsburgh):**__ Both teams cover the Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Field Offices respectively, and are charged with overseeing the entire state of Pennsylvania's occult affairs. These agents are experts in subterranean operations and close quarters battle due to the many abandoned mines, factories, mills and offices throughout the state, which have been reclaimed for unsavory purposes by many bad actors both under and above the Veil.  \n\n__**Utah - Enhanced MOOT \"Temple Patrons\":**__ Based out of the Salt Lake City Field Office, this team primarily consists of Mormons. Most agents are graduates of BYU, and are skilled in thaumaturgy and theurgy rooted in faith and combative rituals. Due to their extensive knowledge of theology in general, these agents are also best suited to handle alternative religions and the communities practicing them.\n\n__**Virginia - MOOT \"Blue Mountaineers\":**__ Headquartered in the Richmond Field Office, these agents specialize in handling anomalies surrounding historical American artifacts, and most of these agents are skilled necromancers. Many have a background in the Humanities, on top of their extensive professional law enforcement experience, most holding degrees in US History, Anthropology and Native American/Indigenous Studies. The ability to commune with the dead stems primarily from the sheer amount of battlefield graveyards in Virginia, offering these agents plenty of opportunities to hone their craft.\n\n//[Mobile Occult Operation Teams are organized on an ad hoc basis.
