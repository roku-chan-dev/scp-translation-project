Only D-Class personnel are to communicate with SCP-2284.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2284 is a male humanoid of Indian descent that is almost genetically identical to [[[SCP-2148]]]. The words \"Mr. Lie, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment\" are tattooed upon SCP-2284's left bicep.\n\nThe speech of SCP-2284 exhibits a cognitohazardous effect which causes others that sense it to believe all declarations and statements made by SCP-2284 are objectively true. Direct audio recordings are subject to this effect. Questions posed by SCP-2284 exhibit no anomalous properties, nor do transcriptions of its speech. Testing has begun to determine whether this property applies to things SCP-2284 writes or types.\n\nSCP-2284 is physically incapable of making true statements. However, it is able to communicate somewhat effectively by relying on rhetorical questions and series of questions that lead others to the desired conclusion.\n\nResearch is currently underway to determine a possible connection between SCP-2284 and SCP-2148-2.\n\n**Addendum A:** The following transcript is from an interview between D-22841 and SCP-2284, recorded by a Foundation speech to text program. Minor edits were made afterward to correct small errors made by the program. Text in italicized brackets are notes by D-22841 during the interview concerning the body language and verbal tone of SCP-2284.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open interview\" hide=\"- Close interview\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\nD-22841: Hey.

I can't imagine what kind of sly trickster would even attempt such a feat.\n\nD-22841: Alright. Let's see. Are you aware of your anomalous properties?\n\nSCP-2284: Anomalous properties?\n\nD-22841: Magic stuff, basically. Um. It says you can convince anyone of anything you say.\n\nSCP-2284: How would they know, if anyone I speak to is affected?\n\nD-22841: Read transcripts, I guess.

Would I be sitting here calm and collected if I didn't belong here?\n\nD-22841: Wouldn't that still just be you trying to convince me of something?\n\nSCP-2284: But did I actually tell you anything, or simply ask you a question?

One second. Chameleon. Lost. Brass, Moon, and Forgetful.\n\nSCP-2284: I'm sure Lost makes your jobs really easy. Where did you find Brass?\n\nD-22841: Let's see. Church of the Broken God.\n\nSCP-2284: Did they think he was part of their [[[twistedgears-kaktus-proposal|god]]]? Man, they could not be further from the truth. \n\nD-22841: What about the others? You seemed concerned about Mister Stripes earlier.\n\nSCP-2284: How could I not be? Don't brothers have to stick together?\n\nD-22841: Aren't all of you sort of siblings? I think I remember reading that in a briefing dossier. \n\nSCP-2284: Yeah. Sure. Totally keen on the idea of being brothers with a corpse with a key in its back. Did you know I don't always know exactly what's going to come out of my mouth? Do I operate on some kind of universal truth rather than what I understand to be the right answer? Would you believe that I once said Stripes wasn't my brother? He isn't my brother! He's definitely not my biological sibling. So why doesn't he seem to realize that we're actual twins, truly blood related? Do you think he just sees me as one of nineteen siblings?\n\nD-22841: Didn't you just-- You know what, let's just move on. What can you tell us about Doctor Wondertainment?\n\nSCP-2284: His name is Isiah Crawford, and-- //(Confused,)// Wait, how did I say that?

Do you think that name is referring to a specific person, or the company?\n\nD-22841: Both. You just said that. Doctor Wondertainment is a male human named Isiah Crawford who is just a company that was never Isiah Crawford [Speech to text program was unable to give punctuation to this dialogue.]\n\nSCP-2284: Are you okay? Oh, what am I thinking? I'm sure you just got tired of talking, that's all. You have no reason to pass out from mental strain.\n\nSCP-2284: Can someone help him?\n\nSCP-2284: You're not going to die. Oh fuck I killed you, you're going to die because of me. Oh, you're not, are you? You have to die at some point, don't you? Probably during something like a mass termination at the end of the month. Because that makes sense.\n\nSCP-2284: Are you guys coming? Can't you see this guy needs help?\n\nSCP-2284: Oh, what's this paper you were writing on?\n\nSCP-2284: No, just looking.\n\n//(You cannot consciously see any of the text I am writing.

Isn't it?\" Fuck I don't know doc)//\n\nSCP-2284: Are there other questions?\n\nD-22841: Can you tell me about the other Little Misters?\n\nSCP-2284: Who do you have so far?\n\nD-22841: Stripes, obviously. One second. Chameleon. Lost. Brass, Moon, and Forgetful.\n\nSCP-2284: I'm sure Lost makes your jobs really easy. Where did you find Brass?\n\nD-22841: Let's see. Church of the Broken God.\n\nSCP-2284: Did they think he was part of their god? Man, they could not be further from the truth. \n\nD-22841: What about the others? You seemed concerned about Mister Stripes earlier.\n\nSCP-2284: How could I not be? Don't brothers have to stick together?\n\nD-22841: Aren't all of you sort of siblings? I think I remember reading that in a briefing dossier. \n\nSCP-2284: Yeah. Sure. Totally keen on the idea of being brothers with a corpse with a key in its back. Did you know I don't always know exactly what's going to come out of my mouth? Do I operate on some kind of universal truth rather than what I understand to be the right answer? Would you believe that I once said Stripes wasn't my brother? He isn't my brother! He's definitely not my biological sibling. So why doesn't he seem to realize that we're actual twins, truly blood related? Do you think he just sees me as one of nineteen siblings?\n\nD-22841: Didn't you just-- You know what, let's just move on. What can you tell us about Doctor Wondertainment?\n\nSCP-2284: His name is Isiah Crawford, and-- //(Confused,)// Wait, how did I say that? What did I tell you just now?\n\nD-22841: That his name is Isiah Crawford.\n\nSCP-2284: //(Speaking to itself,)// That is his name, though... The man known as Doctor Wondertainment has always been Doctor Wondertainment. Is that the game? Doctor Wondertainment was never Isiah Crawford. Doctor Wondertainment is just the name of a company. Doctor Wondertainment is a male human. What the fuck did the old man do?\n\n//(I can hear what he's muttering, but I'm not sure what he means. I'm getting a really bad migraine as he talks)//\n\nD-22841: What are you talking about?\n\nSCP-2284: Are you familiar with Doctor Wondertainment? Do you think that name is referring to a specific person, or the company?\n\nD-22841: Both. You just said that. Doctor Wondertainment is a male human named Isiah Crawford who is just a company that was never Isiah Crawford [Speech to text program was unable to give punctuation to this dialogue.]\n\nSCP-2284: Are you okay? Oh, what am I thinking? I'm sure you just got tired of talking, that's all. You have no reason to pass out from mental strain.\n\nSCP-2284: Can someone help him?\n\nSCP-2284: You're not going to die. Oh fuck I killed you, you're going to die because of me. Oh, you're not, are you? You have to die at some point, don't you? Probably during something like a mass termination at the end of the month. Because that makes sense.\n\nSCP-2284: Are you guys coming? Can't you see this guy needs help?\n\nSCP-2284: Oh, what's this paper you were writing on?\n\nSCP-2284: No, just looking.\n\n//(You cannot consciously see any of the text I am writing. You feel compelled to follow the instructions relevant to you.)//\n\n//(If you are a D-Class you need to give this note to a researcher.)//\n\n//(If you are a researcher without the ability to edit the files of SCP-2284, you need to give it to a researcher who can.)//\n\n//(If you are a researcher capable of editing the files of SCP-2284, you need to scan this part of the note directly into the transcript without rewriting it yourself.
