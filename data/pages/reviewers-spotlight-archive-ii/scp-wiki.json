Members of the staff Critique Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.\n\nNominations and recommendations should be sent via wikidot message to [[*user Zyn]] (team captain of the Critique Team).\n\n--------------\n\n**<< [[[reviewers-spotlight-archive | Reviewers' Spotlight Archive 2019 through 2021]]] | [[[reviewers-spotlight-archive-iii | Reviewers' Spotlight Archive 2025 through 2027]]] >>**\n\n--------------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"2022 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT JANUARY - APRIL\" hide=\"2022 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT JANUARY - APRIL \"]]\n\n++++ __January 2022:__ \n\n**1 January 2022 - selected by //REDESERT//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-5150]]] (Anomalous Dental Office) by [[*user JakdragonX]]\n* //The physical characteristics of SCP-5150-1 resemble standard humanoid features, with the exception of its oral cavity.//\n\n**9 January 2022 - selected by //Leveritas//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6369]]] (Rat lost and found) by [[*user Leveritas]], [[*user Labiosis]], and [[*user Zyn]]\n* //SCP-6369-A, upon arriving onsite, will proceed to dismount their vacuums and search for the item specified as lost.//\n\n**17 January 2022 - selected by //KokwahStarry//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-2682]]] (The Blind Idiot) by [[*user faminepulse]]\n* //Although the object resembles the aforementioned fruit, microscopic imaging reveals only empty space.//\n\n**25 January 2022 - selected by //Zara Calico//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6620]]] (The Trees Have Eyes) by [[*user Dr Leonerd]]\n* //SCP-6620 can be treated using amnestics, though their effectiveness is not guaranteed.//\n\n++++ __February 2022:__ \n\n**1 February 2022 - selected by //Jacob Conwell//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-2816]]] (Nuclear Forgery) by [[*user PickYerPoison]]\n* //Instances of SCP-2816-1 are to be recovered and placed in Site 28 storage room 5C in front of a CCTV camera.//\n\n**9 February 2022 - selected by //Uncle Nicolini//**\n* Featured page: [[[critter-profile-sandra-and-george | Critter Profile: Sandra and George!]]] by [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n* //They have a waterproof keyboard and love to send me messages!//\n\n**17 February 2022 - selected by //Phantom8//**\n* Featured page: [[[And Every Time We Meet Again Hub]]] by [[*user Ralliston]]\n* //Nowak's storm is gathering old enemies, ancient magic, and evil plans, and the Foundation doesn't know what for.//\n\n**25 February 2022 - selected by //caspian2//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6092]]] (Barista, There's a Fly in my Coffee) by [[*user Nanec]]\n* //Any Task Force personnel that regularly consume caffeine are to be exempt from operations.//\n\n++++ __March 2022:__ \n\n**1 March 2022 - selected by //fabledtiefling//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6345]]] (Huesos Malos (\"Bad Bones\")) by [[*user J Dune]]\n* //SCP-6345's attire consists of a black \"lucha libre\" mask and complementary bodysuit adorned with white, skeletal design motifs.//\n\n**9 March 2022 - selected by //DianaBerry//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-4168]]] (##pink|Decomposing Love##) by [[*user DianaBerry]]\n* //SCP-4168-1 experiences decomposition of the body, starting with the heart if either SCP-4168-2 is not within two meters or if SCP-4168 is not worn.//\n\n**17 March 2022 - selected by //Lobster_tail//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6200]]] (INSOMNIUM) by [[*user JakdragonX]]\n* //Management is happy to inform each of you about the brand new addition to Site-119 that was introduced earlier last week: The Noospheric Department!//\n\n**25 March 2022 - selected by //thatcosmicdragon//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6303]]] (A Reason To Live) by [[*user DrDapper]]\n* //Rachel Harris, mother of Sebastian Harris, called the authorities when it was reported that SCP-6303 was levitating Sebastian.//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n~\n\n[[collapsible show=\"2022 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT MAY - AUGUST\" hide=\"2022 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT MAY - AUGUST\"]]\n\n++++ __May 2022:__ \n\nDouble Reviewers’ Spotlight features this month due to contest prize feature schedule!\n\n**1 May 2022 - selected by //Axeras//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6159 | SCP-6159-ARC]]] (Primrose Fatish Von Trevil, Formerly the Book-Bound Devil) by [[*user Fantem]]\n* //SCP-6159 is an untitled book once bound in living tissue, during which time its cover bled five liters of blood daily on average.//\n\n**1 May 2022 - selected by //Meserach//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-3694]]] (America's Diner Is Always Open) by [[*user Meserach]]\n* //The fruits have the appearance and taste of food items from the Denny's menu, even if those items would ordinarily have meat or liquid components.//\n\n**9 May 2022 - selected by //DrRevan//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-6217]]] (The Emergence) by [[*user Re_spectators]] and [[*user Pedagon]]\n* //Today is 6/22/2041, your 6217th day working as a Foundation researcher.
