  "content": "> //[Director Naismith and Junior Researcher Fields sit alone at an otherwise massive conference table at Site-59.]//\n> \n> //[Naismith's elbows are on the desk. He tentpoles his fingers together, contemplating intensely.]//\n> \n> //[Fields's index finger gently but feverishly taps the spacebar of his laptop with the transcriptions from SCP-8922's thumb drive.]//\n> \n> **Fields:** ...well?\n> \n> **Naismith:** Well, what? You got what just we wanted: an explanation. An assessment of SCP-8922's capabilities. The identity of SCP-8922-B. And most importantly, proof that Site-BELUGA is inaccessible to would-be conquerors. If I were you, I'd be counting the days to my next performance review.\n> \n> **Fields:** But... what about Conseil and ARONNAX?\n> \n> //[Naismith hangs his head. He sighs deeply]//\n> \n> **Naismith:** ...it's a crying shame, but that's all that we're at liberty to say about it. We can only do so much to improve the lives of our objects before O5 Command comes down on our asses for \"wasted resources\". If something //can// be done to alleviate their suffering, I'm afraid you'll have to run it by the Ethics Committee first.\n> \n> **Fields:** What if something could be done for under $5.00?\n> \n> //[Naismith raises an eyebrow.]//\n> \n> Well... more like $9.99 in this economy, but still.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> **Naismith:** I'm listening.\n\n> **Experiment Log 8922-27**\n> **Date:** 1/21/2024\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //[The door to SCP-8922's ROB chamber opens. SCP-8922 instinctively points SCP-8922-A at the door.]//\n> \n> //[Fields peeks in. SCP-8922 lowers the gun, but only slightly.//\n> \n> //[Fields waves at SCP-8922.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-8922 waves weakly with the hand covering SCP-8922-B.]//\n> \n> //[Fields places a small metal tray on the ground, then slides it across the floor to SCP-8922. It contains an A-Male to A-Male USB cable.]//\n> \n> **SCP-8922:** //[Inquisitive static.]//\n> \n> **Fields:** You know, like...\n> \n> //[He points to SCP-8922, then to SCP-8922-B, then back to SCP-8922. He makes a gesture like connecting two things together.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-8922 stares at the cable.]//\n> \n> //[Fields turns to leave.]//\n> \n> **SCP-8922:** {{Wait.}}\n> \n> //[He ducks, covering his head in anticipation of SCP-8922-A.]//\n> \n> //[He slowly turns around.]//\n> \n> {{...thanks.}}\n> \n> //[He gives a terrified thumbs-up before closing the door to the ROB.]//\n> \n> //[SCP-8922 connects one end of the cable to a portal on the side of her head, and the other to SCP-8922-B.]//\n> \n> //[1 hour and 48 minutes pass of total silence and stillness between them.]//\n> \n> //[There's a spark.]//\n> \n> //[A small internal explosion splits SCP-8922's head in two. Her body falls limp.]//\n>\n> ...\n> \n> //[38 minutes pass.]//\n> \n> ...\n> \n> //[Suddenly, LEDs across SCP-8922-B begin to glow.]//\n> \n> //[Two feminine voices can be heard on a small, tinny speaker.]//\n> \n> **Conseil:** [[size 75%]]...Nax?[[/size]]\n> \n> **ARONNAX.AIC:** [[size 75%]]Guess what, Babe? They got the director's cut of Koloko Fusion Safety Tutorial #851 in here.[[/size]]\n> \n> **Conseil:** [[size 75%]]You mean the one where they finally reveal who Uranium Coupler 92E is?![[/size]]\n> \n> **ARONNAX.AIC:** [[size 75%]]//[Giggles.]// Welcome home, Consey.[[/size]]\n> \n> <End Log>\n\n**Item #:** SCP-8922\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The inert remains of SCP-8922 and SCP-8922-A are kept in a standard containment locker for analysis. SCP-8922-B is to remain connected to a dedicated power source in a standard containment locker and left in isolation, as per its wishes.\n\n**Description:** See previous documentation.",
