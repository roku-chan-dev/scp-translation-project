No making words about boom-boom words on computers or not-computers. \n\nIn the time that is now, we are not having smart-knowing about which words go boom-boom. To keep everyone being safely alive, please make not normal --**##red|talk##**-- style. \n\nWords and bunches of words that are in red are known to go boom-boom. Remember to never ever assemble them.\n\nRemember to always make **two** \"boom-boom\" with an in-between hyphen. Other styles of making this meaning will go boom-boom.\n\n//New Thing:// Sometimes safe is made to not be safe. Always test with boom-boom computer.\n\n**What It Is:** \"Boom-Boom --**##red|words##**--\" (\"letter-clusters\") is a thing that makes some bunches of letter-clusters make a boom-boom when you put some letter-clusters by other letter-clusters, but only when the thing you are making about is boom-boom letter-clusters themselves. Sometimes just a single cluster of letters will go boom-boom.\n\nOnly when making mouth sounds or making symbol mouth sounds will letter clusters go boom-boom. Reproducing old before-times mouth sound records is safe, but only goes --**##red|a certain amount##**-- of safety. All Foundation computer-symbol letter-clusters are saved right at the time of making, so if you see red bunches of letter-clusters, it means mistake happened. \n\n------\n\n**Trying-Things-Out Log:** We have computer arms make button-hits on computer letters to try out what makes boom-boom. What you can look at under this is just a small bunch for example to show how not-safe boom-boom letter-clusters are. \n\n||~ Thing to make happen ||~ Happened? || \n|| --**##red|special containment procedures##**-- ||= Bad ||\n|| --**##red|s pec ial conta inment proced  ures##**-- ||= Bad ||\n|| --**##red|$p3cial c0ntainm3nt pr8cedure5##**-- ||= Bad ||\n|| spesh cont pro ||= **Good**[[footnote]]Letter-cluster style gave struggle.[[/footnote]] ||\n||  --**##red|ecialspay ontainmentcay ocedurespray##**-- ||= Bad [[footnote]]Maybe looks like meaning-tied?

It gets more bad again and again. \n> \n> If boom-boom letter-clusters started to happen when making mouth-sounds about things that aren't boom-boom letter-clusters, **world could boom-boom.** \n> \n> The Big In-Charge Group has made it happen that trying-things-out and looking-into must keep being happen to stop don't-like-us group and safely keep world not being boom-boom. \n> \n> They make unlikely demands. Tiamat is maybe. For the now-time, --**##red|[[[taboo|Eshu]]]##**-- stands. \n> \n> We keep-out. We keep-in. We keep-safe.\n> \n> **Big In-Charge Group #08**\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\nPeppo Jamcon 2020 \nÂ« [[[SCP-5155]]] | SCP-5404 | [[[SCP-5031]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5403]]] | SCP-5404 | [[[SCP-5405]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
