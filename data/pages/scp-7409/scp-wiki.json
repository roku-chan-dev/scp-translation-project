Close-up captured by //Phoenix//.]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7409\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7409 is to remain in its location of discovery. Due to the remoteness of this location, further containment is unnecessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7409 is a single white lily //(lilium candidum)//.\n\nSCP-7409 bears visual resemblance to domesticated //lilium candidum// found on Earth; however, the object is located approximately 700 million light years from Earth. This location is notable for being at the approximate center of the Bo√∂tes Void[[footnote]] A region of space containing very few galaxies, approximately 330 million light years in diameter. Colloquially referred to as the Great Nothing. [[/footnote]].\n\nSCP-7409 was discovered during a routine patrol of its surrounding area by unmanned Foundation drone //Phoenix//. Once //Phoenix// encountered SCP-7409, it switched itself to manual control mode and awaited further instructions from ground control. Upon seeing the object, ground control noted a desire to \"leave it alone\", which they identified as a minor compulsion effect. Despite this, the team instructed //Phoenix// to attempt to retrieve a sample of SCP-7409.\n\nWhen the drone came within 1 kilometer from SCP-7409, its propulsion jets abruptly lost power. //Phoenix//'s momentum was still able to carry it to the object. However, the drone was unable to collect it or retrieve samples from it; indeed, SCP-7409 appeared to have been \"anchored\" to its location by an undetectable force. //Phoenix//'s jets returned to normal functionality after photos of the object were taken, and ground control directed it back towards its routine patrol.\n\nThe area surrounding SCP-7409 contains several large clouds of small particles, later identified as //lilium candidum// pollen. The volume of these clouds is consistent with 16.2 billion years of pollen production.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7408]]] | SCP-7409 | [[[SCP-7410]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Lilium candidum, Tunisia - 20110517.jpg\n> **Author:** Habib M'henni\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lilium_candidum,_Tunisia_-_20110517.jpg\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
