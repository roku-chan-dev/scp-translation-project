Papers and canvases carrying your feet like the floor, a blanket of dusk with a droplet of plum in the afar, bits and pieces of drafts disperse across the void. Every impossibility wrapped in a ball of home floats in position, followed by a flight of stairs bearing pastel visions.//\n\n//Abigail wastes no time to rush up those stairs, reaching a locked entrance. She knocks on the door once, then twice, then a third to make sure. Nothing, nothing at all. She sighs, leaning back on the door and sliding down to a sit.//\n\n//She looks toward the endless ideas before her. Each piece represents a pint of passion poured inside and out, shows the time that goes with every passing effort. Abigail ponders to herself for a moment or two, before letting her voice be known by the artist beside her.//\n\n**Abigail:** Will, I know you're in there.\n\n//A moment of silence fills the air. He responds.//\n\n**William:** I'm sorry, Abby.\n\n**Abigail:** That's my line. You have nothing to apologize for.\n\n**William:** You're wrong.\n\n**Abigail:** No, I'm not.\n\n**William:** YOU ARE.\n\n//Heavy breathing can be heard from the other side.//\n\n**William:** What are you even doing here anyway? You proved yourself, you don't have to deal with me. Go out there, live with the arts, just… leave me alone, please.\n\n**Abigail:** Not without you. There wouldn't be a point if we can't meet at the top, talking about everything we missed with each other. You'd talk about every last painting you made, I'd talk about every last tale I wrote. You remember that, don't you?\n\n**William:** Don't- don't bring that up. I feel even worse knowing that.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**William:** I'm sorry-\n\n**Abigail:** Stop saying that.\n\n//Abigail wraps her arms around her legs.//\n\n**Abigail:** I admire you too, y'know.\n\n**William:** Mm…\n\n**Abigail:** I mean it! See, I can only do so much with a pen. You, you have the advantage of actually visualizing it on paper, on a canvas. Words can only take you so far, but with your painting skills, it can really bring the piece together. Your drawing and my writing hand-in-hand, it's a beautiful combination.\n\n**William:** I'm not that good.\n\n**Abigail:** Oh, now //you're// the one having imposter syndrome? Come on, you created whole worlds with just a palette of colors and a dream. Not many people can say that, you should be damn proud of yourself.\n\n**William:** Yeah, well… look at you. In the years I put my vision together, you managed to do it in under a day. Not only that, you somehow winded the clock back as easy as one, two, three.\n\n**Abigail:** Because you taught me.\n\n**William:** You're the teacher here, Abby. I just put my own spin on it.\n\n**Abigail:** Aren't we all?\n\n//Another pause.//\n\n**William:** //(Deep inhale)// Look, Abby-\n\n//William stops for a minute, collecting himself.//\n\n**William:** You're… you're an artist. You- you can do anything, you can be anyone, you can go anywhere at… at any time. Why do you want to be with me of all people? Why not some other painter who won't immediately shut you off in a moment's notice?\n\n//Abigail rests her face on the door, speaking in a hushed tone.//\n\n**Abigail:** Because you're the only person worth writing for.\n\n//She waits for a response. There is none.//\n\n**Abigail:** I guess I'll just… take my leave, then.\n\n//Abigail steadily makes her way back down the stairs, her hands digging deep into her pockets. Before she reaches the bottom, however, the sound of a door knob opening alerts her. She turns around to see William standing by the doorway, his eyes dry but clearly not for long.//\n\n//Without hesitating, the two sprint to one another, cycling through a final line of configurations://\n\n//Astronauts, mimes, stacks of appliances, sticky-note drawings, ventriloquist dummies, 8-bit recreations, Christmas elves, marching band members, ##green|**wanderers of the arts,**## humanoid robots, floating masses of fish forming a body, slithering gummy worms, life-sized mugs printed with their images, fast food mascots, Little Misters, heads replaced with home telephones, wind instruments with legs, wind-up toys, a collection of stories-//\n\n//-artists leaving a mark on the world…//\n\n//…//\n\n//They close the distance, reaching in for a hug.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"table6\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The pair appear outside near a middle school, enveloped in darkness and rain. A single lamp post shoots a light on the both of them. They remain in silence, tears trickling down their cheeks and blending in with the clouds. Eventually, they let go of each other and Abby proceeds to laugh.//\n\n**Will:** Wh-Why're you laughing?\n\n**Abby:** //(Snorts)// There's paint on your face.\n\n**Will:** What? Oh-\n\n//Will wipes off the paint on his face. The two wear matching uniforms. She continues to laugh as he blushes in embarrassment.//\n\n**Will:** It's not funny! This is not the time to be laughing.\n\n**Abby:** I'm sorry, I'm sorry.\n\n//Abby pauses and bursts into laughter again. Will tries to act annoyed, though it doesn't stop him from letting out a chortle or two. After they finish, they embrace once more. Their tears end up swelling up again.//\n\n**Abby:** God, I missed you.\n\n**Will:** Same.\n\n**Abby:** I'm so sorry.\n\n**Will:** No, I'm sorry.\n\n**Abby:** No, //I'm// sorry.\n\n**Will:** No, me.\n\n**Abby:** No, //me.//\n\n//Pause. They laugh again before gradually going silent. Everything falls into place, like nothing's going wrong, like it's going to be okay.//\n\n**Will:** //(Inhale)// This is the best story you've ever written. I mean it.\n\n//The pair of artists finally reunite.//\n\n**Abby:** //(Quietly)// …Thank you.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8245/flowershower.jpg|caption=Growing, each and every day.|width=75%|align=center]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= {{**NOTICE:** A new revision for this file has been found.}}\n\n= {{If you would like access, please click [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8245/offset/4 here.]}}\n[[/div]]",
