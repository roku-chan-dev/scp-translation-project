Sightings of SCP-4205 are to be immediately reported to the site supervisor as well as Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz. All video recordings of SCP-4205 can be saved to the specified archive on the Foundation Database <i>&lsqb;&lsqb;dbs-4205&rsqb;&rsqb;.</i></p>\n\n                                <p><b>Description:</b> SCP-4205 is a pair of amber colored eyes, appearing primarily within the translucent or semi-translucent pane of any window-like structure. In most cases, when an affected individual views these eyes, brain death will occur quite swiftly. This has been observed in most cases with only one exception to date. An unusual aspect of the deceased victims is that usual postmortem brain activity ceases in a much more rapid manner than usually observed in a natural death.</p>\n\n                                <p>SCP-4205 was discovered on December 11, 1992 by Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz when he observed SCP-4205 appearing within the reinforced glass between the observation room to interrogation room F99. He later requested the site supervisor, Dr. Mark Forsyth to review surveillance footage of the observation room in which SCP-4205 was observed within the video as well. After further reviews of surveillance footage over the past two years, six other occurrences of SCP-4205 were discovered. They are as follows:</p>\n\n                                <p class=\"block notes\">/&ast; Collect occurrence and place here &ast;/</p>\n\n                                <p>Further research into SCP-4205 is required and has been approved by <span class=\"underline\">Dr. Mark Forsyth</span> with <span>Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz</span> as the lead.</p>\n\n                                <p class=\"block review\"><span>Review Status: DENIED</span>\n                                <b>Notes:</b> Dalitz, this is sloppy.

All sightings of SCP-4205 are to be reported to Foundation Site lead immediately upon discovery. Any deceased victims must be taken to the site coroner in order to perform an autopsy. Until further notice, all rooms containing thin sheets of translucent material used to look between two distinct spaces are to keep an Experimental Lang-Scranton Stabilizer within in order to counter-act the anomaly.<span class=\"sub_footnote\">1</span><span class=\"footnote\">Footnote 1: Need to contact Dr. Scranton...

During autopsy, the bodily functions of victims appear to be completely unharmed. However, the brain is shown to have extensive nerve damage focused primarily on the amygdala, hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, and the occipital lobe. Though, all parts of the brain displayed some form of damage similar in some form to electrical shock or cranial trauma.</span></p>\n\n                                <p><span class=\"new\"> Initial discovery of SCP-4205 occurred </span>on December 11, 1992<span class=\"new\"> when </span>Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz observed SCP-4205 appearing within the reinforced<span class=\"new\"> poly(methyl methacrylate) </span>between the <span class=\"new\"> Observation Room to Interrogation Room F99.

The Holding Room has a single observation window on its northeastern wall. SCP-4205 was observed within the reflective glass of this one way window and appear to passively watch the Deputy Liaison for approximately eight minutes. During this time, the security tape shows mild electrical damage. The Deputy Liaison appears to aimlessly peer around the room when he observes SCP-4205 and falls out of his chair to his death. He was discovered approximately five minutes later by Dr. Bright's assistant.</p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p><b>Note:</b></p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p class=\"clearfix\">This incident caused a significant diplomatic incident between the GOC and the Foundation.

The Holding Room has a single observation window on its northeastern wall. SCP-4205 was observed within the reflective glass of this one way window and appear to passively watch the Deputy Liaison for approximately eight minutes. During this time, the security tape shows mild electrical damage. The Deputy Liaison appears to aimlessly peer around the room when he observes SCP-4205 and falls out of his chair to his death. He was discovered approximately five minutes later by Dr. Bright's assistant.</p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p><b>Note:</b></p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p class=\"clearfix\">This incident caused a significant diplomatic incident between the GOC and the Foundation.

SCP-048-N was a humanoid being that appeared as an malnourished young (approximately 8-10 years old) girl of Middle Eastern origin, though claimed to be thousands of years old. SCP-048-N claimed to be the Canaaite god Yam, despite Yam generally being depicted as a male figure. SCP-048-N had the compulsive ability to fill any space it occupies with water as well as the ability to pass through any solid, opaque surface. An important part of SCP-048-N's containment procedures was to keep her within a glass cube at all times as SCP-048-N was not capable of traversing transparent substances. On November 20, 1990, Area 14 had an emergency drill for which the researchers within SCP-048-N's observation room existed. Within two minutes, SCP-4205 appears on all six panes of SCP-048-N's containment cube. SCP-048-N is declared neutralized upon confirmation of death by Area 14 Director Dr. Lire.</p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p><b>Note:</b></p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p class=\"clearfix\">Dr. Lire seemed very relieved when he was informed that SCP-048-N's neutralization was not a result of negligence. SCP-048 was considered a useful asset due to its nature as a possible deity, one of which is known to have an enemy deity of Baal.</p>\n                                            </span>\n

Due to the nature of SCP-965, there is no direct video feed of the containment area of SCP-965, so there is no recorded confirmation of this encounter. However, Dr. Quale was not aware of SCP-4205's existence prior to his encounter.</p>\n                                            </span>\n                                        </span>\n                                    </div>\n                                </div>\n                                \n                                <div class=\"block\">\n                                    <div class=\"exp log\">\n                                        <div class=\"block\">                \n                                            <p class=\"clearfix\" style=\"font-size:125%;\">Experiment Log SCP-4205</p>\n                                        </div> \n                                        <span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <span>\n                                                    <p style=\"font-size:1.5em;\"><b>Name</b></p>\n                                                </span>\n                                                <span>\n                                                    <p>Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz</p>\n                                                </span>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <span>\n                                                    <p><b>Date</b></p> \n                                                    <p>12/13/1992</p>\n                                                </span>\n                                                <span>\n                                                    <p><b>Supervisor</b></p>\n                                                    <p>Dr. Mark Forsyth [Clearance Level 3] [[Not Present]]</p>\n                                                </span>\n                                            </span>\n                                        </span>\n                                        <span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p><b>Description:</b></p>\n                                            </span>\n                                            <span>\n                                                <p class=\"clearfix\">I tried to touch it.

I know Quale. He's just around my age. Been at the foundation longer than me, though. Actually got through university in a respectable amount of time rather than having to have his pathetic ass saved after two years of failure.

I will talk to him tomorrow.</p>\n\n                                    <p>Also, I think I started to hallucinate. </p>\n\n                                    <p>Last night, I was laying in bed, tossing and turning. I was trying everything. Even turned on the radio to listen to some shitty soft jazz, your favorite, there's really no better sleep aid than that garbage (no offense). I turned to my right side, looking towards the window of my bedroom and I saw them. Again. Same as the first time. I felt myself tense up, my body just seizing. I stared at it for what felt like an eternity.</p>\n\n                                    <p>You know night terrors? I used to have them when I was a kid, it was before you were gone but I don't think I ever told you. Would wake up, stiff as a board and feel as something would pull at my toes and giggle with the same voice as the Wicked Witch from The Wizard of Oz. (That's your fault, by the way. You knew it freaked me out and you'd tease me with the voice anyway.) Eventually I'd be able to take a breath and scramble up in my bed only to see nothing.</p>\n\n                                    <p>Not this time. This time being able to move seemed to come gradually, like stiff knots at my joints were coming unraveled one by one. And then I got up from my bed, but it was still there.</p>\n\n                                    <p>Now stick with me here. Dr. Mark told me to think of some tests for 4205. Which, like, how the hell am I supposed to test something if I don't even know where it is? \n\n                                    <p>But this was my chance, I had to do something. And being the thick piece of shit I am, all I could think of was touching it. Like, next day I'm goddamned punching myself because there's dozens of other better experiments but all I could think of was <i>touching</i> it.</p>\n\n                                    <p>Anyway, I, you know... touched it. Nothing really happened. I felt a weird sort of shiver over my whole body but that's it.</p>\n\n                                    <p>I haven't told anyone. I haven't submitted any of my last two drafts. I just don't want to be taken off the project. This is my chance to prove myself to everyone. Fuck, I have to tell them though. There's something going on. This isn't normal. I'm going to call Mom and talk to her, even though I can't really share any of this with her. Fuck, I hate lying to her.</p>\n\n                                    <p>I wish I had somebody.

Window in the living room.<br/>\n                                    <span class=\"line glitch_3\">Not the window in my front door, though...

Not going to let this stop me.</p>\n\n                                    <p>Oh, also, before being reamed like a stack of paper, I found Quale. He seemed... fine. Told me nothing had happened between seeing the eyes and today.<br/> Maybe I <i>am</i> just going crazy. I do wish I could've talked to him more, though. I've admired the guy since university. </p>\n\n                                    <p>Too goddamned late now, though.

So far SCP-4205 has appeared in:</p>\n                                \n                                <ul>\n                                    <li>Tempered Glass</li>\n                                    <li>Frosted Glass</li>\n                                    <li>Float Glass</li>\n                                    <li>Prototype Memetic Hazard Polymer Shielding</li>\n                                    <li>Plexiglass</li>\n                                </ul>\n                                \n                                <p>Any sentient being directly viewing SCP-4205 will undergo immediate and irreversible brain death, with all measurable neurological activity ceasing within 500 milliseconds of exposure. Any digital video footage captured during an SCP-4205 viewing event invariably displays some level of distortion and corruption. Frame by frame analysis of these recordings demonstrate individual frames displaying various locations frequented by the affected individual. Analysis of this effect is ongoing.</p>\n                                \n                                <p><figure>\n                                    <video max-height=\"600\" max-width=\"800\" autoplay loop muted controls=\"false\">\n                                            <source src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4205/scp-4205.webm\" type=\"video/webm\">\n                                            <source src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4205/scp-4205.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">\n\n                                            <p class=\"warning\">Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</p>\n                                    </video>                            \n                                    <figcaption>SCP-4205 as shown on REC-4205-09BD1.

According to network editing logs, in the two and a half hours between the viewing event and examination of the terminal the files 014205-AnomArch-52-57-44 through 134205-AnomArch-52-57-44 were sequentially inserted, archived, and given priority database positions for SCP-4205. Attempts at removal have been unsuccessful. </p>\n\n                                <p>The discovery of the anomaly and its associated hazards, as well as unsuccessful attempts at containment, prompted the creation of Mobile Task Force Xi-6 “St. Elmo's Fire”, assigned to investigate SCP-4205. Following the death of Junior Researcher Wade Dalitz, a thorough examination of the anomalously archived files has been conducted by MTF Xi-6. While the experience conveyed through these files has revealed some information on its anomalous effects, it has thus far not been possible to confirm whether the experiences described therein are ubiquitous between all affected individuals.</p>\n\n                                <p>Crystallographic analysis of all transparent materials at Junior Researcher Dalitz' home found that the windows installed into main entrance door to the premises were coated in a 34% lead oxide glaze. This lead to the implementation of Special Procedure 4205-&#x394;, leading to an 84% reduction in fatalities related to SCP-4205 over the following fifteen months.</p>\n\n                                <p>Thirty-seven incidences of exposure corroborated by video evidence are recorded and zero subjects have survived. An archive of all affected individuals is being compiled by MTF Xi-6 and will be placed in this file upon completion.</p>\n                                \n                                <div class=\"block notes\">\n                                    <p><b>Special Note:</b> A search of the Foundation Personnel Database for a Dr. Theodore Quale did not result in any matches.
