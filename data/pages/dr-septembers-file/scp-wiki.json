  "content": "[[include :scp-wiki:theme:classic]]\n\nHello, folks! I'm ObserverSeptember. I joined the wiki in 2012 and posted my first successful article in 2013. I've been writing articles on and off since then, and I'm prone to long fits of activity followed by long fits of inactivity. \n\nI consider myself a mid-tier author: I'm not one of the ones you think of when you think of this site, but I have a lineup of decent SCPs and a handful of highly praised ones. As you'll notice, my authorial lilt is ending my SCPs in -5, with the exception of non-mainlisters and one rewritten article. I don't use -15 (again, with the exception of one rewrite) because I like being able to audibly pronounce the -5. I'm hoping to make the [[[pdps|Public Domain Protection Service]]] into a standalone GoI - help me with them if you feel up to the task!\n\nTo toot my own horn a bit, I've been featured on the front page with [[[SCP-2135]]], and I was ahead of the curve on crosslinks with [[[SCP-2305]]] (written over a year before the wikiwalk project began). My SCPs get steadily better written from Series II onwards, but of course you can judge for yourself. \n\nIf you have any questions about my SCPs, feel free to shoot me a message!\n\n__My CSS Preferences__\n\nThe vast majority of my SCPs and Tales use the Classic CSS. I prefer CSS that is simple, easy to read, and not too flashy, i.e. not what most people use these days. Pages of mine that don't use Classic CSS include:\n\n//SCP-375// - Sigma-9 theme used to keep the style of the original version. \n\n//Free Kleinberg// - Broken Masquerade theme used for canon purposes. \n\n//Carroll #332: The Snitch Dungeons// - Sigma-9 theme used due to it being a basis for other GoI Formats. \n\n**SCPs written by me:**\n\n[[[SCP-375]]] - Temporal Credit Union[[footnote]]Rewrite of the previous SCP-375 by an anonymous author.[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-1365]]] - Bike Justice\n[[[SCP-1395]]] - Cave Apparition[[footnote]]First successful SCP.[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-1485]]] - Normality\n[[[SCP-1665]]] - 8 Across, 18 Across\n[[[SCP-1775]]] - Retail Specters\n[[[SCP-1835]]] - Rupertian Zeppelins\n[[[SCP-1925]]] - Dearest Caroline\n[[[SCP-1955]]] - //Spleen Eaters From Venus!//\n[[[SCP-2135]]] - 91st Street Station **[Featured]**\n[[[SCP-2265]]] - Dinner with Andrew\n[[[SCP-2305]]] - great ideas that are TOTALY USELESS (lulz)\n[[[SCP-2475]]] - Culinary Deduction[[footnote]][[[Short Works Contest]]] entry.[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-2685]]] - Thinking in Abstraction\n[[[SCP-3185]]] - The Public Domain Protection Service\n[[[SCP-3285]]] - creative comas [PDPS]\n[[[SCP-3295]]] - Thank You For Smoking\n[[[SCP-3395]]] - The Servants of Fire\n[[[SCP-3445]]] - Grave Insights\n[[[SCP-3595]]] - Einheit\n[[[SCP-3605]]] - The blue is so beautiful [Fifthist]\n[[[SCP-3795]]] - WHO KILLED YOUR DOG?![[footnote]][https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/72-hour-jam-contest 2018 72 Hour Jam Contest] entry (Day 1).[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-3855]]] - Antimemetic Speakeasy [Chicago Spirit]\n[[[SCP-3905]]] - Soda Can Island[[footnote]]2018 72 Hour Jam Contest entry (Day 2).[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-3975]]] - Save the Oreos\n[[[SCP-4025]]] - Blutfahne[[footnote]][[[scp4000contesthub|SCP-4000 Contest]]] entry.[[/footnote]]\n[[[SCP-5865]]] - Planet D-Class\n[[[SCP-6035]]] - Return of the Rat\n[[[SCP-6065]]] - You're Doing It Wrong\n[[[SCP-6195]]] - Live at the OK Hotel\n[[[SCP-6295]]] - Come See the Library\n[[[SCP-6375]]] - Chronicler of the Forgotten Stories\n[[[SCP-6585]]] - Community Dogs\n[[[SCP-6805]]] - Safehold\n[[[SCP-6995]]] - Cannabincognito[[footnote]][[[scp6000contesthub|SCP-6000 Contest]]] entry.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[[SCP-252-EX]]] - A Completely Normal Bomb\n[[[SCP-1994-J]]] - THE BAAAAAAAALL\n\n**Former SCPs:**\n\n[[[SCP-1565]]] - Martian Turtles (original author; rewritten by [[user Weryllium]])\n[[[SCP-1715]]] - Online Friend (original author; rewritten by [[user PeppersGhost]])\n[[[SCP-1756]]] - At the Movies (original author; rewritten by [[user Smapti]])\n[[[SCP-2950-J]]] - **THE POSTCARD** (original author; rewritten by [[user daveyoufool]])\n\n**Tales:**\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/antipublicinterference ANTI-PUBLIC Interference] [PDPS]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/cigarettebreak Cigarette Break]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/thecycleofalexandria The Cycle of Alexandria] [Bellerverse]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/disgusting Disgusting]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/freekleinberg Free Kleinberg] [Broken Masquerade]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/fortherepublic For the RE-PUBLIC] [PDPS/Bellerverse]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/givingup Giving Up]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aholeinthewallonmars A Hole in the Wall on Mars]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-rotting-man-of-stalingrad Pain]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thetalkingcat The Talking Cat] [Bellerverse]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/trafficresumes Traffic Resumes] **[Featured]**\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/worthashot Worth a Shot]\n\n**GoI Formats:**\n\n[[[snitchdungeons|Carroll #332: The Snitch Dungeons]]]\n\n//__Deleted Articles:__//\n\n[http://scparticlearchive.wikidot.com/iterations Iterations] - Tale about SCP-2265 that I self-deleted at +4 due to it being unnecessary and mediocre.\n\nSCP-3085, \"Stuck in 2007\" - [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[http://scparticlearchive.wikidot.com/scp-3775-arc SCP-3775, \"Evobasa Woleb\"] - A failed attempt to jump on the pataphysics bandwagon.

I've since grown rather disdainful towards pataphysics as a whole, so it would've been hypocritical to keep this up.
