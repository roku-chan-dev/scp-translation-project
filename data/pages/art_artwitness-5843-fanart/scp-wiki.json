I was originally going to sketch the piece, but when I received my assigned giftee, I knew I couldn't do that anymore. That is because they have already seen some of my drawings in the past on my artwork page (link below lol), so they would immediately recognize it if I just simply drew it with a pen and pencil. And so, I resorted to paint it.\n\nI'm an amateur at best when it comes to painting, so I had to give 110% of what I would normally be capable of doing. Safe to say it came out pretty well, and they enjoyed it. Whether they knew I was their gifter, I'm not sure. I hope they didn't connect the dots.\n\nSpeaking of which, I had my guess with who drew //[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026495062046/calca0.jpg my]// [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026750939156/calca1.png three] [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/683327170730393634/921671026297962537/calca2.png presents,] and after the reveal, it turned out I was right. Pretty cool, if I do say so myself (Check out their [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/rigen-vectors artwork page] as well!).\n\nThis was also my first ever Art Exchange in the community, and I'm glad to be a part of this event. Massive props to [[*user Elenee FishTruck]] and [[*user DarkStuff]] for setting this up. Glad to be capable of contributing to this. Can't wait for next year!\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ //Merry Christmas, y'all!//\n+++ Check out my other 'doodles' [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/winkwonk-doodles here.]\n@@ @@\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]",
