External links are unaffected.\n[[/div]]\n\n\nWelcome to this installment of site news, where we present only the hottest articles!\n\nThis is a series showing off news from the site, articles from the past month[[footnote]] with a rating above 0 [[/footnote]], and fan-content for you to check out and discover! Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts!\n\n++++ Featured Articles\n\n* The featured articles for July were [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SCP-2268[[/a]] (\"Loaf Page\") by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SpectralDragon[[/a]], [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]The Battle of the Toys: The Breakroom Routing[[/a]] by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Sad Xiao[[/a]], and [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Project Proposal 2004-024: My Father's Values[[/a]] by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Zolgamax[[/a]]. The first is about a website that burns bread, the second is about a pitched battle over the Foundation's toy chest, and the third is about a reality bender's brain on art. Check them out!\n\n++++ Editor's Choice Articles\n\n* [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SCP-3087[[/a]] (\"The Owl-Car\") - Round and round and round it goes. Where it goes, nobody knows... driven by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Chubert[[/a]]. //Chubert has a knack for dialogue and for taking seemingly innocuous objects to a disturbing conclusion. The Owl-Car is no different, and complements its character work with fantastically unnerving imagery. A terrific article that should be read by anyone seeking to write an exploration log.//\n* [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Project Proposals 1964-011/1974-014[[/a]] - Some people make art for art's sake. Others make art for the sake of art. Documented by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Moklin[[/a]]. //In recent years, the GoI// Are We Cool Yet? //has received heavy criticism for a variety of reasons, chief among them being that their reasons for making art are beyond idiotic. This article is an utterly fantastic usage of the AWCY? GoI format that brings the group back to its ideal: art through anomalies. It explores two fantastically unique proposals, each with a distinct concept and voice, and combines them to form a consistent story with an interesting theme and a vivid sense of art. This article is not to be missed.//\n* [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Hartliss Detective Agency[[/a]] - Hartliss's new case pits him against magical criminal syndicates and ancient flesh cults. Just another day in Chicago. Written by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]The Great Hippo[[/a]]. //A fantastic noir story dripping with style. The metaphors and the visuals are crunchy and vivid, the characters are pulpy without being trite, and the action is tense without being intense. Hartliss also combines two GoIs that could not be more different - the anomalous crime syndicate Chicago Spirit and the mystic flesh cult Sarkicism - and makes it work, amplifying their strengths without carrying over their weaknesses. This editor gives it two mutant thumbs up.//\n\n++++ Event Featured Articles\n\nThe theme for the month of July was //uncontained//!\n\n* In [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SCP-2531[[/a]] (\"The Pumpkin Man\"), by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Jonathan Whitney[[/a]], there was something much worse than a worm in this fruit...\n* In [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SCP-1879[[/a]] (\"Indoor Salesman\"), by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]marslifeform[[/a]], a salesman refused to let the Foundation keep him from his job...\n* And in [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]SCP-2872[[/a]] (\"A Fast Horse\"), by [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Freudian[[/a]], a horse was a horse of course but who rode was even more important...\n\n++++ Rest of the News\n\n* Posting has begun for the [[a class=\"newpage\" href=\"#\"]]Social Media Art Contest[[/a]]!

If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending A Random Day a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier! \n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[news-06-2017|June 2017]]] | __[[[news-07-2017|July 2017]]]__ | [[[news-08-2017|August 2017]]] »**\n[[/=]]",
