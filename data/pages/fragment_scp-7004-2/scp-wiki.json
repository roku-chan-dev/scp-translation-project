  "content": "**Update 7/29/2021:** ###89BEF9|A new exploration log has been added to SCP-7004. Due to a lack of specified credentials, this exploration log has been automatically filed as Exploration Log 7004.5.##\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Location: Alaska Highway, British Columbia, Canada**\n**Time:** 6:24 (GMT -8), July 29, 2021\n[[/=]]\n\n[The low droning of the car driving on the highway is the only audible sound as the video starts. From the perspective of the camera, only the open road can be seen, quickly passing by as the car continues on the highway. In the distance, a large far-away mountain range can be seen to the side, hypothesized to be the Northern Rocky Mountains, followed by a larger and more distant unidentified mountain range ahead of the car.]\n\n[Aside from the droning of the car, the interior of the truck is silent. Only the quickly diminishing road, the mountain ranges, and the endless grassy fields outside can be seen.]\n\n[After one minute, the voice of Team Leader Lina Navarra breaks the silence.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Where… where are we?”\n\n[Navarra’s voice is groggy, as if emerging from a long sleep. The sound of a car seat shifting is heard.]\n\n**Mullins:** “We’re… uh…”\n\n[As opposed to Navarra’s voice, Mullins’ voice belies her exhaustion. Her words are slow and slurred.]\n\n**Mullins:** “In British Columbia, now, I think. We passed uh…”\n\n**Navarra:** “Passed what?”\n\n**Mullins:** “Fort St. John a while back. Had to take a few back roads to avoid the -1s. They were building random stuff there too, same with Watson… but uh, much bigger.”\n\n[A short silence passes between Navarra and Mullins.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Mullins… You want me to take over? What time is it?”\n\n[Another short silence passes as Mullins presumably looks at the car’s clock.]\n\n**Mullins:** “Uh… eight? 8:29?”\n\n[Silence for another three seconds. The sound of a car seat shifting is heard again.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Mullins, it’s six.”\n\n[Mullins chuckles tiredly.]\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “I guess adrenaline uh… counts for a lot, right? Didn’t even realize I was sleepy.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Mullins, pull over.”\n\n**Mullins:** “But I’m fi-”\n\n**Navarra [firmly]:** “Agent Cassandra Mullins, //pull over.//”\n\n[Another silence passes. A sigh is heard. After a few seconds, the car begins to slow down, pulling to the side of the road. It then comes to a full stop.]\n\n[The sound of the passenger side door opening is heard. Across the front of the car, a weary Navarra moves from the passenger side to the driver’s side before disappearing from view.]\n\n[After another few seconds, the car door opens.]\n\n**Navarra [outside]:** Mullins, get out of the driver’s seat.”\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “Ma’am, it’s alright, I’m-”\n\n**Navarra [loudly]:** “//That is an order.//”\n\n[Another silence passes. The car then slightly shifts to the left, followed by Mullins crossing the front of the car a second later. Her hair is dissheveled, and her eyelids seem to be on the verge of fully closing. She walks with a pronounced slouch as she disappears into the right of the frame.]\n\n[A few seconds later, the car shifts to the left, presumably caused by Mullins entering the car. This is followed by Navarra entering the driver’s side, and the left door closing.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Your door.”\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “Crap. I’m… I’m sorry.”\n\n[A door is heard closing. A seatbelt is heard being secured.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Your seatbelt, too.”\n\n[It takes Mullins longer to respond.]\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “I got it.”\n\n[The click of a seatbelt is heard to the right.]\n\n[A car seat is heard shifting forward, followed by the sound of the gear shift being pulled back. The car begins to pull back into the highway, moving again at the same speed as before.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Our gas’ll need a top up. It’s already less than a quarter full.”\n\n[A long silence intervenes for two minutes.]\n\n**Mullins [slowly, conciliatory]:** “I’m… I’m sorry Lina.”\n\n**Navarra:** “Sorry? Why?”\n\n**Mullins:** “For… screwing up.”\n\n[Navarra audibly exhales.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Don’t think about it. What I //do// want you to fucking think on, though, is how you kept pushing the hell out of yourself after eleven hours of nonstop fucking driving.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Mullins, you may have fucked up back in Watson Lake, but that doesn’t mean you have the right to push yourself to the brink of fucking death just to make it up to me. You got unlucky, and that was it. You don’t need to hold yourself up with… with atoning.”\n\n[Another silence intervenes.]\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “It… it wasn’t nonstop driving. I stopped for two hours, ma’am, just… just outside of Fort Nelson.”\n\n**Navarra:** “And that’s supposed to compensate for spending the next eight hours on the road?”\n\n**Mullins [slowly]:** “I… I didn’t wanna wake you.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n[Silence for ten seconds.]\n\n**Navarra [quieter]:** “Get some sleep, Cass. You deserve it.”\n\n**Mullins:** “Cass?”\n\n[Navarra doesn’t answer for a few seconds.]\n\n**Navarra:** “I said get… get some rest. We still have a long fucking way to go.”\n\n[Silence for another thirty minutes, save for the constant low drone of the car. Fifteen minutes in, the car comes to a stop. The sound of a bag being taken is faintly heard, followed by the opening of a zipper. A sound of fabric being unfurled is heard in the background.]\n\n[Mullins quietly groans in her sleep.]\n\n**Navarra [quietly]:** “There.”\n\n[Soon after, the car begins to move again.]\n\n[Two minutes after, as Navarra continues to drive forward, the faint outline of a house under construction on the side of the road is seen.]\n\n**Navarra [muttering]:** “What the hell is…?”\n\n[As Navarra gets closer, several more houses are seen by the side of the road, all constructed a fair distance away from each other, but all in varying states of progress.]\n\n[Soon, as the car comes close enough for Navarra to look closer, a human face is seen looking at her through one of the windows in the closest house. Soon after, the face disappears from view, but as the car passes the house, the outline of an SCP-7004-1 instance is seen running away from the window.]\n\n**Navarra [quietly]:** “Oh fuck.”\n\n[The car then passes several more houses and several burnt-out campfire pits in quick succession, but as they pass, several more SCP-7004-1 instances are seen running into the houses, as if fleeing from the car in fear. Some are even dropping grocery bags as they rush inside or attempting to protect other instances as the car passes, demonstrating ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## with the previous behavior seen in other instances.]\n\n[Alarmed at the quantity of SCP-7004-1 instances surrounding the road, Navarra starts speeding up the car, quickly leaving the “village” behind.]\n\n[Beside her, Mullins stirs but does not wake. It takes a few minutes for Navarra’s breathing to relax.]\n\n[Ten minutes after, the sound of beeping interrupts the silence. A robotic voice quietly speaks.]\n\n**GPS:** “GPS on. Positioning your vehicle. Please stand by.”\n\n[Silence for another several seconds.]\n\n[A series of beeps are heard, possibly Navarra tapping on the screen.]\n\n**GPS:** “Calculating the distance to… Edmonton. Please stand by.”\n\n[Another silence intervenes. The sound of Mullins quietly snoring is heard. A seat is heard shifting from the driver’s side.]\n\n**GPS:** “Edmonton… is… five hundred kilometers… away. Estimated time of arrival is 5 hours and fifty minutes.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n**GPS:** “From your current position, Edmonton is to the southwest. From your perspective, it is to your… front.”\n\n**Navarra [faintly]:** “My front?”\n\n[A silence is heard for the next four seconds.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Oh my fucking God.”\n\n[Immediately, the car comes to a stop. The sound of a car door is heard opening, followed by Navarra emerging into view, holding a pair of binoculars. She is seen attempting to view the distant mountain range. After a few seconds, she lowers it. A look of shock can be seen on her face.]\n\n[The sound of a car window opening is heard.]\n\n**Mullins [groggy]:** “Ma’am…? What is it?”\n\n[Navarra lowers her binoculars, looking in the direction of Mullins. She rushes out of frame. Her voice can be heard to the left side.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Mullins. Look there, in that direction. What do you see?”\n\n[Silence for five seconds.]\n\n**Mullins:** “A mountain range. Ma’am, what do you-”\n\n**Navarra:** “Now look through these binoculars. What do you see?”\n\n[The sound of binoculars being handed off is heard. Mullins groans as she is heard sitting up.]\n\n[Silence for six seconds.]\n\n**Mullins:** “Is… is that…?”\n\n**Navarra:** “Buildings, yeah. Stacked on top of one another.”\n\n**Mullins:** “Then… that’s no mountain range…”\n\n**Navarra:** “It’s a fucking city. The skips just kept building on top of it, thousands, maybe a //million// of them, like the signpost forest. Like your Fort St. John.”\n\n**Mullins:** “The buildings… they don’t look like ours. Like what we’re familiar with. Plus, that’s got to be a kilometer high, //at the least.//”\n\n**Navarra:** “Yeah. Exactly.”\n\n[Navarra is heard sighing.]\n\n**Navarra:** “We can’t risk that. We have to go around it. You know any alternate routes?”\n\n**Mullins:** “I…”\n\n[Mullins pauses.]\n\n**Mullins:** “No, but… we can make a way through the Central Rockies, go by the parks, the uh… the parkways. It should be far enough. By the time we go downhill across the border, it’ll be Montana, and then we won’t have to deal with any big urban centers before we get to Yellowstone.”\n\n**Navarra:** “We got a plan, then. I don’t know if we have enough gas to do it, but… let’s hope.”\n\n[Navarra is seen moving across the front to the driver’s side before opening the door. The sound of her entering the car is heard.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Rockies… here we go. Let’s hope you’re as far from the cities as we think.”\n\n**Mullins:** “I hope so, ma’am.”\n\n[Navarra doesn’t respond for several seconds.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Call me Lina, alright? We’ve been around each other long enough to do away with the ‘ma’ams’.”\n\n[A silence ensues.]\n\n**Mullins:** “A… affirmative, ma- I mean, Lina?”\n\n[Navarra chuckles.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Yeah, we’ll fucking work on that. Let’s go.”\n\n[As Navarra shifts gears and begins to drive forward, the words “BATTERY LOW” begin to flash on the top of the video. After several seconds, it turns off.]\n\n[The video ends.]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n**Update 7/29/2021:** ###89BEF9|A series of short videos have been added to SCP-7004. As these videos have been taken in close succession, all of them have been combined and classified as Exploration Log 7004.6.##\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Location: Icefields Parkway, the Central Rockies, Alberta, Canada**\n**Time:** 10:24 (GMT -6), July 29, 2021\n[[/=]]\n\n[The video begins with the truck ascending a steep road, possibly moving up a mountain. Unlike the last video, the camera seems to be held by Agent Cassandra Mullins, who then points the camera at Team Leader Lina Navarra.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Conserve the battery on that thing. You got lucky scoring it back in Watson Lake. We don’t know if we’ll have that same luck again.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n**Navarra [quietly]:** “And we still need gas.”\n\n[Navarra seems to be concentrating on driving the vehicle, with her body language denoting a tense demeanor.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Hoo, easy does it…”\n\n[As the pickup truck continues to move forward, Mullins points the camera away from Navarra and to the window at the back of the vehicle, towards the cargo bed. A massive grey collection of buildings can be seen in the distance, with many seeming to equal the altitude of the vehicle itself. It extends nearly across the horizon, vanishing past the line of the surrounding mountains.]\n\n**Mullins:** “That’s Edmonton, over there. We don’t even know how far it goes.”\n\n[Mullins points at the city, which seems to have grown since the last exploration log hours before. Even from the distant standpoint of the camera’s perspective, the grey color of Edmonton appears to encompass nearly the entirety of the view from the back window. Massive buildings are stacked on top of one another, constructed in seemingly illogical ways- a tower can be seen diagonally sprouting from a larger, rectangular building, while a spire seems to jut dangerously from the top of another building further up.]\n\n[As Mullins allows the camera to dwell on Edmonton, Navarra begins to guide the vehicle onto a flatter road. She sighs with relief as she does so.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Glad that’s fucking over.”\n\n[Navarra momentarily chuckles with relief. Mullins points the camera at her, which prompts Navarra to finally look directly at the camera as she allows herself to recline.]\n\n**Navarra:** “We’re hoping further south will be a bit better, especially in Montana, but we aren’t counting on it. If Edmonton’s already this big, who knows how large Calgary would be.”\n\n[Navarra’s gaze lingers on the camera for another few moments, before looking back to the road.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Alright, turn that thing off. Save the battery.”\n\n[Mullins chuckles quietly.]\n\n**Mullins:** “Alright, ma’am.”\n\n[Navarra pauses for a moment, before turning to Mullins. An incredulous smile is on her face.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Hey, I said no more ma’-”\n\n[Mullins is heard flicking the switch of the camera.]\n\n[The video ends.]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Location: Icefields Parkway, the Central Rockies, Alberta, Canada**\n**Time:** 10:54 (GMT -6), July 29, 2021\n[[/=]]\n\n[As the video begins, the tall peaks of the nearby mountains lining the Icefields Parkway are seen dominating the view. The vehicle continues forward at a constant pace, passing undisturbed forests and meadows. Though the weather is cloudy, with a distant fog occluding the peaks of the mountains from view, a large amount of the natural scenery can still be seen.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Pretty view, hmm? I assume you’ve gone through here before?”\n\n[Mullins chuckles.]\n\n**Mullins:** “You haven’t?”\n\n[Navarra shrugs, grinning slightly.]\n\n**Navarra:** “Never had the chance to come out here with the constant deployments.”\n\n[The vehicle continues to move forward, but after a few seconds, Navarra begins to cause it to slow.]\n\n**Navarra [puzzled]:** “Wait. What the hell is…?”\n\n[She points at a spot on the windshield.]\n\n**Mullins:** “What?”\n\n[As the car approaches, a scattered group of 5 SCP-7004-1 instances, all of which are covered in thick blankets, are seen running in the opposite direction from where the car is going. Two are attempting to use their arms to protectively cover the others, which are composed purely of roughly ten juvenile PETAL instances between the three other entities. The juveniles strain their necks to watch the car as it passes, before being hurriedly ushered away from the car and the road by the two other instances, which are made out of almost purely adult PETAL instances.]\n\n**Navarra:** “What the hell are they doing?”\n\n**Mullins:** “They’re… running. Running away.”\n\n**Navarra:** “From what?”\n\n[Suddenly, Mullins’ attention is drawn to something in front of her.]\n\n**Mullins:** “There. Look there.”\n\n[Mullins leans forward, pressing the camera close to the windshield in the direction that she previously leaned in. In the distance, a faint rectangular shadow is seen.]\n\n**Mullins:** “Crap.”\n\n[Navarra sighs.]\n\n**Navarra [urgently]:** “Mullins... I mean, Cass. Get the duffel bag, take out the earplugs. Now.”\n\n[The video ends.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Location: Icefields Parkway, the Central Rockies, Alberta, Canada**\n**Time:** 11:10 (GMT -6), July 29, 2021\n[[/=]]\n\n[As it starts, the video feed shows multiple large buildings leering over the mountains, quickly being added to by thousands of SCP-7004-1 instances. Like with Edmonton, the buildings have been constructed in a bizarre manner, with some structures branching out from others and others even penetrating into and emerging from the mountains. As the vehicle continues to coast forward, a large glass skyscraper-like building emerges from the fog, laying down on a mountain’s peak to encompass the space above the parkway onto the peak across from it.]\n\n**Navarra [quietly]:** “Calgary.”\n\n[As the vehicle passes under the skyscraper, the thousands of SCP-7004-1 instances constructing the buildings begin to shout at the operatives, though the interior of the car has decreased the sound to a dull roar. Each PETAL instance waves their arms with urgency as the car approaches, as if trying to get the attention of the operatives.]\n\n[Navarra, who is wearing earplugs, ignores the instances as she passes them by, speeding the vehicle up in order to quickly leave the area. As she does so, however, more buildings continue to emerge from the fog, with several other buildings, like the skyscraper, acting as bridges from one peak to another across the space above the parkway. More SCP-7004-1 instances wave desperately from the surface of the buildings.]\n\n**Navarra [quietly]:** “Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.”\n\n**Mullins [quietly]:** “It’s… it’s the heart of the city. We’re heading right into it.”\n\n[The video ends.]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Location: Icefields Parkway, the Central Rockies, Alberta, Canada**\n**Time:** 11:23 (GMT -6), July 29, 2021\n[[/=]]\n\n[As the vehicle continues to cruise through the parkway, the volume of the “bridges” increases, causing the road to become dark. Some have even been constructed to loom low over the parkway, with SCP-7004-1 instances clinging to the bottom of the buildings to attempt to reach for the roof of the car. The sounds of fingers scraping against the roof of the car are heard. Navarra continues to increase the speed of the car as the dull roar of the PETAL instances’ voices begin to increase in volume, with voices and individual words becoming clearly distinguished.]\n\n**Mullins [panicked]:** “I… I can hear them. I can hear them!”\n\n**Navarra [shouting]:** “//Hold on!//”\n\n[The sounds of fingers scraping against the roof adds to the cacophony, with hands, arms, and heads clearly being sighted emerging from the low ceiling created by the buildings. The expressions of the individual PETAL entities can clearly be seen, their eyes expressing fear, panic, and helplessness. The word “###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##” is seen being mouthed and shouted by many of the instances. As the vehicle approaches them, they bring their hands out to touch it, causing many to slam against the windshield.]\n\n**Navarra [shouting]:** “GET THE FUCK AWAY FROM US!”\n\n[As the ceiling continues to get lower and lower, individual PETAL heads begin to be low enough to touch the windshield itself. As Navarra continues to speed across the parkway, one PETAL head veers close enough to collide with the windshield, causing a large spiderweb of cracks to pattern throughout the glass. Blood is seen running down the windshield shortly after.]\n\n[Ahead, more hands continue to emerge from the windows at the bottom of the building. As they slam into the glass, the cracks continue to widen and widen, before encompassing the entirety of the windshield. The sounds of shouting become louder and louder.]\n\n**Navarra:** “HOLD ON! WE’RE ALMOST OU-”\n\n[As more hands hit the glass, the windshield breaks, causing the volume of the PETAL’s voices to increase into a deafening, omnipresent roar. Instantly, both Mullins and Navarra start screaming and writhing in pain, causing the camera to fall into the floor of the car. The resulting fall obscures the camera’s view.]\n\n**SCP-7004-1 PETAL instance:** “WE ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##!”\n\n**SCP-7004-1 PETAL instance:** “###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## US!”\n\n**Mullins:** “I can hear them! //I can hear them!//”\n\n**SCP-7004-1 PETAL instance:** “COME ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## US!”\n\n**Navarra:** “Stop! Just stop! Just-”\n\n[At once, the car’s wheels begin to whine loudly as it presumably loses control, before completely turning. The camera’s lens are heard breaking as it impacts with the car door. Navarra and Mullins are heard screaming, but are completely drowned out by the sound of SCP-7004-1 instances.]\n\n[They are heard coming ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n closer and closer and closer###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\nand and\n\nand\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n[[size 150%]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## [[/size]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## glass is heard breaking [[size 130%]]###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##[[/size]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## [[size 150%]]###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##[[/size]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## Navarra ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n[[/=]]\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## “CAN YOU TELL US WHERE WE [[size 190%]]###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##[[/size]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nNavarra: “GET AWAY FROM US!”\n[[/div]]\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## [[size 210%]]###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##[[/size]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## [[size 300%]]###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##[[/size]] ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]## ###ed0000|[VECTOR REMOVED.]##\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nNavarra: “Cass, get the fuck up.
