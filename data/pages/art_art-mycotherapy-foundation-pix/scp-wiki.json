Please. \n\nOtherwise... this turned out REALLY cool. I want to do a few broad-spectrum GoI/general concept videos so I started with this one. Not what I normally do but! Eh. Also, I have NO idea what to credit this as other than the logo because it's not really based on any one person's work and is kinda just... a general representation of an interview? If I did it wrong please let me know.\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:carousel\n| images=https://i.imgur.com/TWEoDeR.gif,https://i.imgur.com/AKUcT8R.gif,https://i.imgur.com/OhG397Y.gif\n| caption= test\n| interval=5\n| wiki=scp-wiki\n| page=SCP-173\n| width=315px\n| height=560px\n| position=center\n| no-caption=true\n| background=black\n| options=yes\n]]\n[[/=]]\n\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-173 SCP-173] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-096 SCP-096] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP-682] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-053 SCP-053]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 173.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7058209101586861358?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-173 by Moto42\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 096.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7058209101586861358?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-096 by Dr Dan\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 682+053.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7058209101586861358?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-682 by Dr Gears and Epic Phail Spy, SCP-053 by Dr Gears\n[[/<]]\n\nI also drew a lot of extra art for this one. \nThese three! Funnily enough, I actually drew these ones first. And drew them in the backward order of when they first show up in the video?  I DO know how to credit THESE.\n\nNeeded to come up with my own 173 design but I wanted to preserve the ENERGY that everyone knows and not everyone loves. Was extremely close to just drawing one of those squeezy toys but I am pretty sure those are also not CC.\n\nFor 683... This is the second time I've drawn it and at this point, I refuse to ever do it justice. I have a huge soft spot for kids and an overwhelming disgust for anything that would put them in danger so 053's story has always been upsetting. I want her to be happy at the expense of the big dumb --beluga whale-- lizard.\n\nI don't have any fun insightful commentary about 096. I'm gonna be honest I've never really had strong feelings about it.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
