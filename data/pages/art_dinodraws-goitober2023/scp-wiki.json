For my first GOITOBER piece! It was a fun read, and I am a sucker for face-stealing monsters. Interpreting its design was a real treat for my creature-design enjoying heart. \n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Day 2 - Ruiz Duchamp]]\n++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 2 - Ruiz Duchamp]**\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/M3F15qI.png]]\n\nEyyyyy it's this guy. I have no idea what he looks like so I improvised a scruffed looking bitch. Drew something moderately inspired by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-dies Nobody Dies] by [[*user Randomini]] because the Cool War is something I read around last year and thinking was fun. My personal art \"challenge\" to myself was just 'keep it messy!' so I did very minimal cleanup and also just rough painted in the colors. because this man is a MESS.\n\nI think the plot of the Cool War could've been avoided if Duchamp had spoken his plan aloud. \"I'm going to change the status quo by killing Nobody!\" like c'mon man. Buddy. Pal. I know you're going through shit but repeat that again slower to yourself.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Day 3 - Three Moons Initiative]]\n++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 3 - Three Moons Initiative]**\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/dozxIMJ.jpg]]\n\nI was admittedly very exhausted today, so I elected to just sketch something based on the hub page! The concept of Three Moons is equal parts hilarious and interesting to me, and I'll be sure to check out some articles at a later date. \n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Day 4 - Nameless]]\n++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 4 - Nameless]**\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/4iGPG5P.png]]\n\nI realized [[[ricky-vasquez |Vicky Vasquez]]] by [[*user mr-carbon]] and [[*user DrowningDutchman]] was in the Nameless tag and jumped on that like a feral dog. Checkmate fae, can't steal shit if there ain't shit to steal. I'm technically a day behind right now but shhhhhh I'll catch up gimme a bit. This ones art challenge thing was \"draw in not your usual program\" you I used Aggie as opposed to my usual Photoshop.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[[tab Day 5 - Fifthism]]\n++++ **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goitober2023 GOITOBER Day 5 - Fifthism]**\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/1vj02lM.png]]\n\nThis time it's [[[a-pathetic-attempt-to-explain-fifthism |A Pathetic Attempt to Explain Fifthism]]] by [[*user chaucer345]]!
