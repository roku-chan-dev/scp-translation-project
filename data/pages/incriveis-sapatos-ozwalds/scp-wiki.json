Inappropriate use may also result in an improperly calculated teleportation of the user in the space-time continuum, causing potentially permanent physical damage to the user in many ways, including but not restricted to crushing, corporeal disintegration, compromise of molecular structure in the weave, among others.\n\nTravels to alternate dimensions within the state of Kansas are not recommended due to sudden changes in climate.\n\nDas Wunderkabinett does not accept rebates.\n\n[[/div]]",
