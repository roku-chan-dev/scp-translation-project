This was thought in order to be able to meet the expenses of his daughter's dowry. She, named Anna Maria Luisa, will be the last representative of the family to hold absolute power over the Academy. Through the so-called \"Family Pact\", she favored its independence from the princes of Austria-Lorraine, making it impossible:\n\n//[...] \"to take out of the capital and the state of the Grand Duchy, galleries, pictures, statues, libraries, jewels and other precious things, from the succession of the Most Serene Grand Duke, so that they would remain for the ornament of the state, for the benefit of the public and to attract the curiosity of foreigners. \"//\n\nSince then the Academy has slightly changed its face: no longer at the service of the Medici princes, it started an activity that we could define as a museum and the recovery of past art, according to the principles of the Enlightenment. This also started a wide diffusion of the Academy, not only in other non-catholic European countries but also in the rest of the world, reaching the continents of Asia and America.\n\nWith the birth of the Italian state under Savoy leadership the Academy, which until then had shown mild support to the Risorgimento cause, proposed itself as a reference institution in dealing with the occult for the new italian state with its capital now located in Florence. The Academy provided support to the activity of the [http://fondazionescp.wikidot.com/scp-121-it Royal Institute for the Unification of Italy]; however, with the conquest of Rome in 1871 and the formation of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/gruppi-di-interesse#RIDIA Royal Institute of Italian Anomalies] (RIDIA in italian), the priorities of the crown no longer coincided with those of the Academy. Despite this brief moment of crisis, the Academy did not end up being absorbed by the Royal Institute. This was possible thanks to the donations made by the European aristocracy and the rich American bourgeoisie. Nonetheless, the Belle Epoque years were certainly among the most prolific and fruitful in the history of the Academy, despite the appearance of [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/un-ballo-in-maschera new enemies] over the horizon.\n\nThe dull situation imposed on Europe during the Great War and its consequences led the European branches to a contraction of their strength and capacity of action.

At the top needed to be placed a figure of prestige. The possibility for the Tutor of Florence, the most important among all the Tutors to become head of the organization, was stopped by the direct intervention of Anna Maria Luisa. In her will she decided that the person to inherit the position of supreme head was going to be the representative in charge of looking after the relations between the institute and the grand dukes, formerly known as \"Curator hereditatis [[footnote]] Established by the Duke of Florence and then first Grand Duke of Tuscany, Cosimo I de' Medici.

Despite this last assignment, he never reveals himself during official events, neither within the Academy nor with representatives of other groups.

It is assumed that it's elected through an internal vote by all the Tutors of the Academy.\n\n* **Tutors:** Representatives of each branch, the Tutors manage the internal activities of each venue and also partly coordinate relations with the outside world when allowed. The office is elective and has variable duration.

They maintain a certain transversality, and are not to be considered as mere bureaucratic executors of the will of the Tutors, but as deserving and honorable members worthy of being heard for their opinion.\n\n* **Assistants:** All the members of the organization, whether involved into restorations or conservation or relations with the public are called Assistants, and are the beating heart of the Academy and its activities.\n[[=]]\n‚Äª ‚Äª ‚Äª\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Works Catalogue]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 6px; background-color: white;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]##darkred|**Official Catalogue:**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[module ListPages category=\"*\" order=\"name\" tags=\"+_madao\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/lincubo-di-pigmalione-sec-vii-a-c-circa Pygmalion's Nightmare, VII Century b.C. ca. ]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]##darkred|**Other Works**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[module ListPages category=\"*\" order=\"name\" tags=\"+scp +madao -international\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Histories and Biographies]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 6px; background-color: white;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]##darkred|**Histories and Tales:**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[module ListPages category=\"*\" order=\"name\" tags=\"+tale +madao\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]##darkred|**Istorie et Biografie:**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[module ListPages category=\"*\" order=\"name\" tags=\"+madao +_it\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/un-ballo-in-maschera Un Ballo In Maschera]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Our Venues]]\n[[div style=\"padding: 6px; background-color: white;\"]]\nWhile maintaining its heart and its roots in Italian soil, from the time of its foundation the Academy has followed the princes and princesses of Medici family, spreading its influence across the courts of many powerful European nations.

The future pontiff took this choice dictated by the political needs of the period: after the restoration of the Signoria in Florence, the Medici owed a lot to the monarchs of Spain, main supporters of their resettlement. By placing one of the Academy's venue in the new unitary state they would have strengthened relations and intensified collaboration and mutual support. The first seat of the Academy in Iberian land was located in Palacio de Benacaz√≥n, in the ancient capital of Toledo and remaining there for more than a century (it was dispensed from the centralization of institutions wanted by king Philip II by virtue of a papal dispensation from Pius IV, known as Giovanni Angelo Medici di Marignano).
