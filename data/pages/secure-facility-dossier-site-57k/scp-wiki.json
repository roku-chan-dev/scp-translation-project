Equipped with various high-performance astronomical observation devices and situated in an area with low population density and clear air, Site-57K is optimised for astronomical research. The site is the main responder when anomalous entities are discovered in space, a celestial body is deemed anomalous, or extraterrestrial threats approaching Earth are detected. Additionally, even if the anomaly is not directly related to astronomy, Site-57K is often involved in research concerning extraterrestrial beings or civilisations.\n\nSince most of the research at the site focuses on investigating and exploring extraterrestrial phenomena, there are very few anomalous entities contained within the facility. Most of these are Safe-class, object-type anomalies with almost no high-risk entities. As a result, when containment rooms or laboratories are required, the site often relies on support from nearby facilities. The destruction of a significant portion of the main research facilities during the 2017 incident also contributed to this operational structure.\n\nAnother key function of Site-57K is psychotherapy. When Site-57K transitioned from a research and development facility to an astronomical observation site, the Psychotherapy Department was newly established at the request of Director Seong Unhan. Since then, this department has proven its effectiveness and has become one of the primary departments at the site. Due to this and the pleasant environment in Subi-myeon, personnel from other sites who suffer psychological damage during missions, rendering them unable to perform their duties, are often transferred to Site-57K for a period of recovery and rehabilitation.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+ **▣  Staffing Information**\n----\n\n[[include :scpko:component:image-block name=http://scpko.wikidot.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-57k/milkyway.aic|caption=Modeling of Mirinae.aic drawn by researcher ███|width=320px]]\n\n\n**Site Director:** Dr Seong Unhan\n\n**Asst.

As the number of anomalous entities steadily increased across Gyeongsangbuk-do and the Korean Peninsula as a whole, the need for an additional Foundation outpost became apparent. Site-57K was founded in Yeongyang-gun, Gyeongsangbuk-do, and shared its status as a Foundation outpost in the region with [[[scp-1102-ko|Site-11K]]].\n\nThe Site-57K Research and Development Facility was used for various large-scale projects due to the relatively low civilian population in the surrounding area. At the time of its establishment, Site-57K was one of the few facilities under the Korea Command that specialised in handling various projects. The site took on a range of responsibilities, with the upper levels dedicated to safe projects or those with minimal connection to anomalies, the shallow underground levels used for containing anomalous entities required for projects, and the deeper underground levels reserved for major projects.\n\nIn 2008, the first director suddenly resigned. At the time, Dr. Seong Unhan was the leading candidate for the new director position, but he declined due to personal reasons, leading to the appointment of Dr. Ji Sangyeon as the second director. During this period, Site-57K gradually lost some of its responsibilities and authority as the number of facilities under the Korea Command increased. Due to Dr. Ji Sangyeon’s focus on performance, he significantly increased the workload and aimed to expand the influence of Site-57K. He made several requests to upper management for personnel reinforcement, and it was during this time that the size of Site-57K’s underground research facilities more than doubled.\n\nHowever, the new director's approach sparked significant opposition among the staff. Frequent reports emerged claiming that excessive workloads and long working hours were deteriorating employees' health, and job satisfaction had noticeably declined compared to the past. Despite these concerns, the fact remained that the performance of Site-57K had improved under the new director, leading upper management to issue only a few warnings without taking further action. During this time, Site-57K reached, or even surpassed, its peak performance levels, continuously increasing the number of projects and SCP items under its containment. Gradually, the staff became accustomed to the new environment, and the director’s strategy of balancing rewards and strict measures quelled much of the initial resistance. As a result, Site-57K continued to operate without major incidents.\n\nHowever, in 2010, the completion of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-21k|Site-21K]]] brought significant changes to Site-57K's situation. The newly constructed Site-21K, the largest facility under the Korea Command, was tasked with handling numerous classified projects. As a result, several major projects that had been under the purview of Site-57K were transferred to Site-21K, despite Director Ji Sangyeon's objections.\n\nIn response to the reduced influence of his facility, Director Ji further increased the staff's workload beyond previous levels. However, despite these efforts, the results fell short compared to Site-21K, leading only to increased employee discontent. Despite the backlash, Director Ji remained resolute in his approach, even resorting to risky actions to boost performance. A subsequent audit by the Ethics Committee revealed that he had severely violated the Foundation's ethical guidelines, and cases of employee death due to overwork were not uncommon. Additionally, interviews with staff uncovered evidence that he had disregarded essential safety protocols in pursuit of efficiency.\n\nIn 2017, a major accident occurred at the site, causing the situation to change drastically once again. On the day of the incident, for unknown reasons, the underground facility at Site-57K collapsed, leaving the facility half-destroyed. Most of the anomalous entities contained at the site were lost during this event, and there were also significant casualties. While the exact cause of the accident remains unclear, it is believed that a combination of factors, such as negligence due to extreme fatigue and inadequate safety measures, played a role. For further details, refer to the section on the underground facility structure.\n\nMost of the senior staff at Site-57K received disciplinary measures shortly after. Director Ji Sangyeon was unanimously dismissed. Under the guidance of the Korea Command, Site-57K underwent a major overhaul. Dr. Seong Unhan, who had left for another facility after 2010, returned to take over as director. Since the observatory facilities were unaffected by the incident, the site was remodelled with a focus on astronomical observation. The remodelling was completed in 2018, and the facility's official name was changed to Site-57K Astronomical Observation Facility.\n\nTo support staff who had worked under the previously harsh conditions, the Psychotherapy Department was established during this period. Initially set up as a temporary unit to help restore the mental health of existing personnel, the department exceeded expectations with its outstanding results, leading to its formal establishment as an official department. Professor Sim Miyeon, the most experienced member of the psychotherapy team, took on the role of department head, and the unit was promoted to a full-fledged department. To this day, the operations and activities of Site-57K are centred around two main departments: the Astronomy Department and the Psychotherapy Department.\n\nAlthough Site-57K has decreased in size and influence compared to its past, job satisfaction has significantly increased, and it has firmly established itself as a specialised astronomical facility. Most of the Astronomy Department under the Korea Regional Command is now centred around Site-57K, and additional space-related departments, such as the Extraterrestrial Religion Division, are also emerging. The site is also highly regarded as a recovery facility for mentally and physically exhausted personnel. Several years after Dr. Seong Unhan's appointment as the third director, Site-57K is now seen as having completely transformed from its previous state.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+ **▣  Site Structure**\n----\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Main Hall]]\n[[size 140%]][[span style=\" background-color: #B6CFF3;\"]]Main Hall[[/span]][[/size]]\n@@@@\n[[include :scpko:component:image-block name=http://scpko.wikidot.com/local--files/secure-facility-dossier-site-57k/star|caption=Site-57K Main Hall meeting room|width=320px]]\n\nThe Main Hall of Site-57K is currently the central facility of the site, housing the majority of departments and staff, including the key departments such as the Astronomy Department and the Psychotherapy Department.

Aside from maintenance personnel and regular patrol staff, there is no reason for general employees to access the area.\n\nThe current state of the underground facility remains entirely unknown. Given the significant number of anomalous entities that were contained at Site-57K, it is impossible to predict what interactions or effects may have resulted from the collapse and the potential mixing of entities. The Hume levels within the facility fluctuate constantly. The Foundation has temporarily surrounded the area with anti-anomaly equipment, such as Scranton Reality Anchors, and conducts regular patrols. However, these measures have not resolved the underlying risks. Fortunately, these precautions have been effective, as no major incidents or mass escapes of anomalous entities from the underground facility have occurred since 2018.\n\nAt the time of the incident, most of Site-57K’s assets were underground, resulting in significant losses and damage to the facility. In addition to the anomalous entities, various amenities, Foundation equipment, and data storage devices were also lost. It is believed that many staff were unable to evacuate in time. While most personnel trapped near the surface were rescued, it is estimated that many individuals remain buried in the debris.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+ **▣  Anomalies and Activity Report**\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ **Anomalies**\n[[/=]]\n\n||~ ID Number ||~ Object Class ||\n|| [[[SCP-286-KO]]] || Safe ||\n|| [[[SCP-1972-KO]]] || Safe ||\n|| [[[SCP-596-KO]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-677-KO]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-1425-KO]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-280-KO]]] || Keter ||\n|| [[[SCP-1535-KO]]] || Keter ||\n|| [[[SCP-1548-KO]]] || Keter ||\n|| [[[SCP-1599-KO]]] || Keter ||\n|| [[[SCP-352-KO]]] || Neutralized ||\n|| [[[SCP-414-KO]]] || Hiemal ||\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ See Related Activity Reports\" hide=\"▽ Close\"]]\nThe following are reports related to this facility, though their connection is not particularly significant.\n* [[[SCP-1102-KO]]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++++ **Activity Reports**\n[[/=]]\n\n* [[[think-of-the-past|A Long Look Back]]]\n* [[[tosky|]]]\n* [[[star-for-color|]]]\n* [[[le-gateau-tombe-par-terre|]]]\n* [[[oyasumi-watashi-no-hoshi|]]]\n* [[[personnel-file-assistant-seong-han-na|]]]\n* [[[transfer-request|]]]\n* [[[star-people-love|]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+ **▣  Subsidiary Departments**\n----\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"dptmbox57k\"]]\n[[=]]\n###103C80|[[size 160%]]**Department of Astronomy**[[/size]]##\n[[div class=\"dptmline57k\"]]\n[[image http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:playlist01-8-e433/dptm-1.png style=\"width: 250px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n* **Head of Department:** Dr Cheon Munyeon\n\n> Astronomy, along with mathematics, is one of the oldest sciences.

It was established with Site-57K as its headquarters after disbanding all astronomy-related departments within the Korea Command, except for the Celestial Observation Department at Site-27K. As a result, the Astronomy Department now handles nearly all astronomy-related tasks within the Korea Command. All celestial phenomena observed at other Foundation sites, including observatories under its jurisdiction, are transmitted to the Site-57K database. As expected, the Astronomy Department is the largest department within Site-57K, overseeing sub-departments such as the Department of Planetary Science, the Department of Radio Astronomy, the Department of Astrobiology, and the Department of Space Environmental Science.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ See Related Documents\" hide=\"▽ Hide\"]]\n* [[[SCP-280-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-352-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-414-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-596-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-677-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-1425-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-1548-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-1599-KO]]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"dptmbox57k\"]]\n[[=]]\n###103C80|[[size 160%]]**Psychotherapy Department**[[/size]]##\n[[div class=\"dptmline57k\"]]\n[[image http://scpkosb.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:playlist01-8-e433/dptm-2.png style=\"width: 250px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n* **Head of Department:** Prof. Sim Miyeon\n\n> No one can go through life alone.
