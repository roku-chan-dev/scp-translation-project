No pronouns are to be used to refer to SCP-2505. No static documentation is to exist for SCP-2505; nor indeed can it ever last for long. All personnel designated to SCP-2505 are to memorize relevant experimental results.\"\nvar dstring = \"SCP-2505 is a small metallic ball bearing which is affected by an anomalous informational phenomenon. Any information recorded in a static manner about SCP-2505 will consistently delete or destroy itself approximately 7.4 seconds after its creation. This method of removal is dependent on the method of recording. For text entered into a computer one character at a time, the information is deleted one character at a time 7.4 seconds after each character is typed. For digital audio recordings about SCP-2505, files will be edited in real time 7.4 seconds after recording to white noise. Both of these methods cause no lasting damage to the electronics that they are being recorded on. For non-computerized formats, the removal of information can be more destructive. For example, with vinyl audio recordings, the sections of recorded sound on the vinyl will superheat 7.4 seconds after recording, melting the record and destroying the data. For information written by typewriter or pen, the ink will typically dissipate into airborne particulate. Information carved into surfaces typically results in the catastrophic destruction of the surface. When a non-human sapient mind is introduced to information about SCP-2505, it will typically forget that information after 7.4 seconds. The only known long-term method of recording information on SCP-2505 is storage within a human mind; that is, remembering the information. Besides this effect, SCP-2505 exhibits no other anomalous properties; SCP-2505's shape is, however, exceptionally close to a perfect sphere.\"\n\nfunction containment()\n{\nif(cnum2<cstring.length){\ncnum2++;\nwindow.setTimeout(cdel,7392);\n}\nwindow.setTimeout(cwait,1);\n}\n\nfunction cwait(){\ndocument.getElementById(\"cbox\").value= cstring.substring(cnum1, cnum2);\n}\n\nfunction cdel(){\ncnum1++;\nif(cnum1==cnum2){\ncnum1=0;\ncnum2=0;\n}\ndocument.getElementById(\"cbox\").value= cstring.substring(cnum1, cnum2);\n}\n\nfunction description()\n{\nif(dnum2<dstring.length){\ndnum2++;\nwindow.setTimeout(ddel,7392);\n}\nwindow.setTimeout(dwait,1);\n}\n\nfunction dwait(){\ndocument.getElementById(\"dbox\").value= dstring.substring(dnum1, dnum2);\n}\n\nfunction ddel(){\ndnum1++;\nif(dnum1==dnum2){\ndnum1=0;\ndnum2=0;\n}\ndocument.getElementById(\"dbox\").value= dstring.substring(dnum1, dnum2);\n}\n\nfunction create(form) {        \n\nif (confirm(\"Warning: Creation of fraudulent articles will result in disciplinary action.
