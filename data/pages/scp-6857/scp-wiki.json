SCP-6857 is to be placed at the center of a cubic enclosure measuring ten (10) meters to a side. This enclosure must comply with Site-56's maximum standard security requirements for a Safe object.\n\nFoundation personnel capable of childbirth are not permitted to enter SCP-6857's enclosure, except during a testing scenario. Testing equipment and other amenities requested by Head Researcher Dr. Lucas Isakov are permitted inside the enclosure.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6857 is an unused Clearblue Rapid Detection pregnancy test. When brought near a fertilized human zygote, SCP-6857 will anomalously induce zygotic splitting. If allowed to develop, these zygotes ultimately grow into genetically identical siblings.\n\nThe Foundation was first made aware of the anomaly when Foundation statisticians noted that identical siblings were being born at an unusually high rate in Ely, Nevada. Central Analytics determined that the mothers of these siblings all visited the same Rite-Aid drug store roughly nine (9) months prior. MTF Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") were covertly dispatched to the drug store, where they identified and purchased SCP-6857.\n\nSecurity footage from the drug store indicates that SCP-6857's anomalous effect has a range of roughly five (5) meters. Prolonged or repeated exposure to SCP-6857 will cause a zygote to split multiple times.\n\n**Addendum:** Foundation statisticians at Central Analytics have noted an unusually high rate of identical births in Nevada over the past year. This phenomenon prompted Central Analytics to launch an investigation to determine the root cause of the statistical abnormality.\n\nThe investigation was led by statistician Dr. Caroline Fischer, who visited Site-56 to rule out any connection to SCP-6857.\n\n----\n\n> **Video camera footage starting at 1437 hours.**\n> ----\n> //Site-56 offices, conference room 6. Dr. Caroline Fischer and Dr. Lucas Isakov are in the midst of a discussion, seated on opposite sides of a conference table.//\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** –and you were the one who tracked it down, correct?\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** That's right.\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** It must have been a bit of – how you say – \"needle in haystack,\" no?\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Well, once I found that all the mothers had visited the drug store, it was straightforward enough. You just need to notice patterns, find the common thread.\n> \n> //Dr. Isakov nods.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Speaking of which, we should probably get down to business.\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** Ah! Yes, well, before that, I would like to clarify. Is this, uh– statistical anomaly have any chance of being pure coincidence?\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** No. Well, yes, but //infinitesimally// small. The fact that these siblings are only being born in Nevada, specifically to people with Foundation ties–\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** Foundation ties?\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Yes. 52% of affected individuals are either a Foundation employee, or related to one. Spouses and daughters, mostly. \n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** And the remaining 48%?\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Well, they'd account for the baseline rate of identical sibling births. Roughly four in every thousand births are identical twins, and we've been seeing twice that for the last 12 months - but only in a 200 kilometer radius. Or so.\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer produces a thin binder from her attaché case.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** My preliminary report suggests that there may be some kind of covert operation against the Foundation. I'll be working with on-site security to audit SCP-6857's containment procedures. I hope that’s not a problem.\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer slides the report binder across the conference table. Dr. Isakov gives it a sidelong glance. He drums his fingers against the table erratically.//\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** A strange way to sabotage us.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Agreed. But //something// must be causing these numbers. I'm just trying to rule out SCP-6857.\n> \n> //Dr. Isakov reaches for the binder. He opens it and begins to read. Dr. Fischer opens a notebook and clicks her pen.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** I'd like to start by asking a few questions about the containment procedures. They mention that SCP-6857's enclosure must comply with the maximum security requirements for a Safe object. Have there been security incidents with the object in the past?\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** No, not that I am, ah, knowing of.\n> \n> //Dr. Isakov turns to the next page of the report while Dr. Fischer writes.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Okay. The procedures also make mention of \"testing scenarios.\" Could you elaborate on what these scenarios entail?\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** I cannot.\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer looks up from her notes.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Why is that?\n> \n> //Dr. Isakov closes the report and places it back on the desk.//\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** You lack the security clearances–\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Then I'll go back to Central Analytics and get them. They think this represents a credible threat to the Foundation–\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** I must disagree.\n> \n> //Dr. Isakov's gaze flickers to the camera. Dr. Fischer sighs.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Okay. The containment procedures imply that Foundation personnel are used for testing. I take it that means Class-D?\n> \n> //There is a pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Why not use in vitro fertilization? Wouldn't that be more suited to a laboratory environment?\n> \n> //There is a pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** I'm assuming you need a fertilized zygote for your tests. Do the Class-D get pregnant?\n> \n> //There is a pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Do they carry to ter–\n> \n> **Dr. Isakov:** Unfortunately, Dr. Fischer, I cannot be of any further assistance to this inquiry.\n\n----\n\n> **Video camera footage starting at 1602 hours.**\n> ----\n> //Site-56 Records Office.

It seems like you're really... on the go these days!\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer is visibly caught off-guard, but quickly relaxes.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Ha, yeah, Central Analytics has kept me pretty busy. I can't talk too much about it, of course–\n> \n> **Griswold:** Of course.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** –but I'm actually getting stonewalled right now on the 6857 thing.

There is a long pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** How are the kids?\n> \n> //Griswold continues tapping at the keys.//\n> \n> **Griswold:** Oh, they're doing great. I actually got a stipend for a full-time babysitter, which has been a fucking lifesaver, honestly.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Oh, nice!\n> \n> **Griswold:** Yeah, I'm just hoping they remember who their //real// mother is when I get home...\n> \n> //Griswold trails off again. She presses one final key.//\n> \n> **Griswold:** Oh, you're in luck. I've got over a hundred matches here. I'll e-mail the list to you. All signed off on by one Dr. Isakov. Our lonely Russian geneticist.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Lonely?\n> \n> **Griswold:** Haven't you seen his sad little eyes?\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer looks at Griswold quizzically.//\n> \n> **Griswold:** I– I probably shouldn't gossip, I'm sorry, he's– he's a sweetheart.\n> \n> //Dr. Fischer chuckles.//\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** I think this job has done a number on you, Casey, cooped up in here. Doesn't suit you.\n> \n> **Griswold:** Ha, don't even start. Alright, you should have the files now.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Excellent, thanks. I'd love to catch up more, but I have to get down to Light Containment–\n> \n> **Griswold:** Oh, by all means. Go do your statistician, math whiz thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Fischer:** Thanks, Casey.

These countermeasures were of paramount importance to a successful recontainment operation. The anomaly has been known to induce paranoia in some subjects, so any messages you wrote or recorded in this altered state should be disregarded.\n\nThese countermeasures were discussed during site orientation, but the experience can still be very disorienting, particularly for those of you who are new to Site-56. Please take a moment to check for any minor injuries and visit the nearest Health Center if needed. Counseling sessions are also available upon request.\n\nAs well, we owe our well-being to a visitor from off-site; although she does not remember the specifics of the incident, I'm told that Dr. Caroline Fischer's quick thinking played a pivotal role in the swift recontainment of the anomaly. If you see her, please be sure to express your gratitude.\n\nI'd like to thank each and every one of you for your continued service and bravery. Please do let me know if you have any questions.\n\nSincerely,\n\nDr. Justin Kroft\nSite Director, Site-56\nSecure. Contain.
