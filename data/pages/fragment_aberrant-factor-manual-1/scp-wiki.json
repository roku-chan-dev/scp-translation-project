I actually still have my copy from back when it was originally released -- and they're going for upwards of $500 in pristine condition so I took a huge risk by scanning the manual for y'all. The game's interesting and I remember never being able to beat it when I was young though. There's a rumor going around it's actually based on hidden classified FBI files, but that's fucking stupid because if it was, then they wouldn't have been able to make it in the first place. I also uploaded a version with images, which you can find [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aberrant-factor-manual/offset/0 here].\n\nAnyways, I delivered the request. Have fun with it and I hope you enjoy.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ ##red|WARNING!##\nThis game may contain scenes considered violent or disturbing.\n\nDo not play if you are sensitive to these kinds of content.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ TABLE OF CONTENTS\n[[/=]]\n-----\n|| CONTROLS ||> pg. 2 ||\n|| PROLOGUE  ||> pg. 3 to 5 ||\n|| STARTING THE GAME  ||> pg. 6 ||\n|| SYSTEM SETTINGS ||> pg. 7 ||\n|| SAVING ||> pg.8 ||\n|| LOADING ||> pg.9 ||\n|| DISPLAY MENU  ||> pg. 10 and 11 ||\n|| SPECIAL INTERACTION  ||> pg. 12 ||\n|| GAME OVER ||> pg. 13 ||\n|| WEAPONRY ||> pg. 14 ||\n|| MAIN CAST  ||> pg. 15 ||\n-----\n[[>]]\n01\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ CONTROLS\n[[/=]]\n-----\nMOUSE - Interaction, Option Selection\nKEYBOARD - Special Operation (see pg.8)\nCTRL - Skip Type Text Effect\n-----\n[[>]]\n02\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ PROLOGUE\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/UIU_Logo-NSM.png style=\"width: 200px;\"]]\n++ INTERNAL ACCESS DATABASE\n\n{{USER: M.

These disappearances have coincided with an increase of tourists visiting neighboring resort towns.\n\nThe reason for the current designation of this case as a serial kidnapping revolves around the shared M.O. All kidnappings have occurred in the early hours of the morning (0300 - 0600) on days with new moons; additionally, all of the victims were last seen near local bodies of water. Most so far have been young children. \n\nNo potential suspects have been identified nor have there been any eyewitnesses to any of the disappearances. Several sweeps of the surrounding area have also turned up empty. Local authorities have deferred to us on this case.\n-----\n[[>]]\n04\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ PROLOGUE (Cont.)\n[[/=]]\n-----\nRE: Assignment 85-2934\n\nChief --\nI don't think this one is in our jurisdiction.

Saving and loading can be done anytime in the game.\n\n__**SAVING**__\nSelecting ‘Save’ next to an open slot number will save your progress into that slot.  There is an eight save slot limit in the game, so be careful! ‘Save to Disk’ will save your progress as a .save file to a selected folder (defaulted to your Downloads folder) on your computer. Saves can be overwritten by deleting the save in the slot you wish to overwrite, and then saving again to that slot.\n\nClicking on ‘Continue (MANUAL)’ in the main menu will load the top-most saved slot, i.e. starting at slot no. 1, so it is best to keep that slot as your recent save. The game will automatically save to the autosave slot at specified points.\n\n##red|**NOTE:**## It is highly recommended to save at the start of new pages and sequences. Due to how the engine works any choices made will NOT be saved if you create a save mid-passage. Upon loading, the game will assume that you have just newly landed on the page you previously left off on.\n----\n[[>]]\n08\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"page-div\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ LOADING\n[[/=]]\n-----\n__**LOADING**__\nIf a save slot has been used, the ‘Save’ button next to the slot will be replaced by ‘Load’; selecting this will load the game in that slot automatically.

Any downloaded .save files from other games or previous versions of the game will either fail to load or cause significant errors while attempting gameplay.\n\n__**DELETION**__\nTo remove a used save slot, the ‘Delete’ button will be able to be selected. Pressing this button will only delete the save in the specific slot. The ‘Delete All’ option can be used to remove all save slots (including the autosave slot).
