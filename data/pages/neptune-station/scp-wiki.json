SCPS POSEIDON – NIGHT\n\n//Music fades down. Though inside the bowels of the ship, the sounds of a gale can be heard outside. Inside are CREWMAN, Lieutenant Commander MARKS, Chief Petty Officer BRANDT, and Doctor REX.//\n\n**CREWMAN:**\nCommander, Admiral Hendrickson is online.\n\n**MARKS:**\nStart the call.\n\n**CREWMAN:**\nYes, sir.\n\n//The call comes online.//\n\n**MARKS:**\nAdmiral, this is Marks. Chief Brandt and Dr. Rex are here with me.\n\n**HENDRICKSON:**\nOkay, Commander. Doctor, you may begin the briefing.\n\n**REX:**\nOkay. Sector Twenty-Three has gone offline. And we don’t know why.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nUh, for those of us who don’t remember every secure facility the Foundation runs…\n\n**REX:**\nAh, yes, right. We’re directly above it right now, actually – it’s on the ocean floor. The main base of operations in the sector is generally called “Neptune Station”. Now, I assume you’re all familiar with the Foundation’s Project Daedalus?\n\n**MARKS:**\nLaying the groundwork for our space program, right?\n\n**REX:**\nYes, Commander. You see, O5 Command believes that containment of a variety of objects would be far safer if we stored them off planet. And, there are a fair handful of different SCPs that put us a generation or three ahead of the main American, Russian, European, and Chinese space programs – that is, assuming we can replicate their effects in a controllable way.\n\n**BRANDT:**\n“Open the door, Hal!”\n\n**REX:**\nUh, something like that, Chief, though less to do with artificial intelligence and more to do with irregular spacetime, general relativity, and quantum mechanics.\n\n**MARKS:**\nDoctor…\n\n**REX (CONT’D):**\nYou see, because they don’t have access to the objects we’re containing, and thus don’t realize the exceptions to the laws of physics,\n\n**MARKS:**\nDoctor…\n\n**REX (CONT’D):**\nmainstream physicists generally dismiss the practical viability of such useful things as quantum entanglement, time dilation, zero point energy generation—\n\n**MARKS:**\nREX! The point?\n\n**REX:**\nAnyway, Sector Twenty-Three is home to the research and development program for Project Daedalus.\n\n**MARKS:**\nThank you.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nWhy put a space research base on the ocean floor?\n\n**REX:**\nWell, several reasons, really, first being power. Lots of power. The Scotia Sea sits on its own tectonic plate – and a relatively thin one. There is a very active hydrothermal vent field, which we’ve tapped for geothermal power. Neptune Station has no difficulty generating – and using – as much power as the entire country of South Korea. Second, security is easy – it’s not that easy to get 5 kilometers under the ocean, and passive sonar will pick up anybody trying. Third, containment is incredibly simple: you just blow a few holes in the pressure hull and let the immense pressure of the ocean crush the facility.\n\n**BRANDT:**\n“Crunch.”\n\n**REX:**\nYeah, pretty much. Now, five years ago, when the Foundation was originally surveying to find a place to put Sector Twenty-Three, they found a number of suitable locations, but chose the Scotia Sea for a simple reason: this.\n\n//Rex hits a button, calling up an image on the computer screen.//\n\n**MARKS:**\nWhat are we looking at?\n\n**REX:**\nThis is E-2157. Possibly the biggest scientific discovery in the history of the world.\n\n**MARKS:**\nSo, what is it?\n\n**REX:**\nIt is, well, we have absolutely no idea what it is. Scans put it at somewhere between two and five kilometers in length and between point five and one kilometers in width and height. Every time we measure it, we get different readings. It’s buried in the silt and bedrock, and has been for between ten thousand and several tens of millions of years.\n\n**MARKS:**\nIs it some sort of creature?\n\n**REX:**\nWe don’t know. Our biologists can’t make heads or tails of it. If it ever was “alive”, it now appears to be dead or dormant. From what we can tell, it’s composed of both a variety of metallic alloys our engineers have never seen before and some minerals unlike anything our geologists recognize. In all cases, at the microscopic level, the structure of the materials resembles a cross between the theoretical construction of advanced nanites and that of organic cells. We don’t know if it was built, grown, or what.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nGet to the point, Doc. What does this thing have to do with space travel?\n\n**REX:**\nI was just getting to that. Inside and immediately around the object, the laws of physics work differently – very differently, and very usefully. We’ve had to basically throw traditional mathematics out the window, but we’ve been making progress, however slowly. After three years of effort, our researchers finally managed to get inside about six months ago. Anyway, long story short, if we’re able to safely replicate any of the anomalies caused by this object, this thing is the holy grail.\n\n**MARKS:**\nThe holy grail?\n\n**REX:**\nYes. Not just for Project Daedalus, but for human society in general. Faster-than-light travel. Nearly inexhaustible pure clean energy extracted from the very fabric of spacetime. Truly instantaneous communications unhindered by the speed of light. The list goes on. This is big. The wheel big. Fire big.\n\n**BRANDT:**\n…Wow.\n\n**REX:**\nYeah. “Wow.”\n\n**HENDRICKSON:**\nNow that you understand how important Sector Twenty-Three is, you realize why O5 Command is so concerned about the cessasstion of communications. We lost contact about 15 hours ago. We have no idea what happened, but we do know the failsafes haven't triggered.\n\n**BRANDT:**\n//(aside)//\nWhy do failsafes always fail? Aren’t they supposed to be safe from failure?\n\n**HENDRICKSON (CONT’D):**\nCommander, you and your team are going down to Neptune Station on the Poseidon's minisub. I know three people isn't enough to secure the station, but that's not why we're sending you down there. Restablish communications. Find out what went wrong. Because of how difficult it is to get large numbers of people down to the Station, O5 Command isn't willing to devote more personnel until we know exactly what we're dealing with. Nevertheless, the research is too important to abandon unless there's a very good reason.\n\n**MARKS:**\nAye, sir.\n\n**HENDRICKSON:**\nOne last thing, Commander: don't go into Echo Two One Five Seven itself - it's too risky, since we don't know if the object is responsible for what's going on down there. Once you've reported back with more details, O5 will authorize sending more personnel down for recovery operations. If we don't hear from you within 24 hours, you will be presumed lost.

Let’s take a look.\n\n**CREWMAN:**\nAye, sir.\n\n//A switch is thrown.//\n\n**BRANDT:**\nWell, the station’s exterior floodlights are still on, so power’s online. It also looks like all the station’s minisubs are still docked.\n\n**MARKS:**\nWell, since the porch light’s on, let’s see if anyone’s home.\n\n//Marks keys the acoustic telephone.//\n\n**MARKS (CONT’D):**\nAuthenticator Papa Oscar Five Sierra Three calling Neptune Station.

At present, the station is at General Quarters. Please remain here. A security escort will arrive to greet you shortly.\n\n**MARKS:**\nFlashlights, people.\n\n**REX:**\nHuh, looks like this section of the station’s on emergency lights.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nThat’s not a good sign.\n\n**MARKS:**\nMore to the point, where is everybody? There should be a Boatswain’s Mate on duty – wait. Rex, there’s a handprint here behind the desk.\n\n//Rex walks over and bends down. He examines the handprint, touches, and smells it.//\n\n**REX:**\nDark, blackish red. Slightly warmer than room temperature. It’s not blood – wrong smell. Too viscous to be seawater. Still, slightly salty. I’m not sure what it is.\n\n**MARKS:**\nHm. Take a sample.\n\n**REX:**\nAlready on it.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nNo sign of anyone in the vicinity.\n\n//Marks removes the microphone from the main circuit callbox.

Shouldn’t there be a couple hundred people on this station?\n\n**REX:**\nOne hundred fifty, at the moment.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nSo where are they? Most containment breaches I’ve handled left evidence: you know, blood or whatever. And the couple of times I’ve fought off the Chaos Insurgency, they just left bodies where they fell.\n\n**VENILIA:**\n//(over the 1MC)//\nGeneral Quarters, General Quarters!

And no, there is no indication about why General Quarters was sounded.\n\n**MARKS:**\nHm. Can you tell me why communication was lost?\n\n**REX:**\nYes, that’s simple: the fiber-optic cables connecting to the mainland were cut. Don’t know why, or how, though. Anyway, it’s not fixable from inside, and I’m not rated on deep ocean salvage and repair.\n\n**MARKS:**\nAlright. Any other survivors on the station?\n\n**REX:**\nI’m looking through security camera feeds. I’m only seeing one other person, living or dead, on the station – down by the decontamination chamber leading to E-2157.\n\n**MARKS:**\nCommander Howard?\n\n**HOWARD:**\nThat’s Dr. Kelly. She’s Sector 23’s Head of Research.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nThen there’s a good chance she knows what’s going on.\n\n**MARKS:**\nIndeed. Anyone in Echo-2157?\n\n**REX:**\nI can’t tell – all computer connections to inside are non-responsive. ...Oh, crap.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nDoc?\n\n**REX:**\nWe have a problem.\n\n**MARKS:**\nWe have a lot of problems.\n\n**REX:**\nAccording to this, Sector 23’s Chief of Security, Lieutenant Douglas, ordered his men to plant a bomb inside E-2157.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nSo?\n\n**REX:**\nThe Scotia Sea has a very thin crust – it’s why there are so many hydrothermal vents here, and why Neptune Station can generate so much geothermal energy. The point is, there is an incredible amount of potential energy beneath us. If that bomb goes off, it could cause that energy to be released as a volcanic explosion.\n\n**MARKS:**\nSo, Mount Saint Helens?\n\n**REX:**\nMore like Krakatoa, actually. The volcanic explosion itself would be really bad, and then there’s the inevitable tsunami it would cause, but that’s not the worst of it.\n\n**HOWARD:**\nYou’re saying that a major volcanic explosion and tsunami which, together, will kill thousands—\n\n**REX:**\nTens of thousands, at least, probably more.\n\n**HOWARD (CONT’D):**\nWhatever – that isn’t the worst?\n\n**REX:**\nE-2157 is significant because of its irregular spacetime qualities. There’s not enough data to definitively say either way, but there is a very real possibility that dumping a massive and uncontrolled burst of energy into E-2157, like from, say, a large bomb or a major volcanic explosion, could tear a hole in the fabric of spacetime, which could potentially destroy an area twenty or so astronomical units across. As in, no more Earth, no more Moon, hell, no more Saturn! (beat) Like I said, we have a problem.\n\n**MARKS:**\nHow much time do we have?\n\n**REX:**\nIf we don’t disable that bomb in the next fifty-four minutes, we are in very serious trouble.\n\n//Fade to music.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ **ACT III**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/neptune-station/NS_ActIII_0527.mp3]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Act III Transcript\" hide=\"- Hide Act III Transcript\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n++* INT.

Dr. Kelly insists that this object is dormant or dead, and that there has been no active nanotechnology here for millions of years. I disagree – there just isn’t the data to back up her assertions. We’ve only been here a few months – not long enough to finish cataloguing, much less analyzing – a find of this size. Privately, I am concerned. While Dr. Kelly has always been a tough woman, she’s gotten downright demanding in recent weeks. She’s been spending a lot of time in Section Delta – she says she’s there “listening”, even though the acoustic sensors indicate no appreciable ambient sound in that chamber.\n\n**KELLY:**\nOkay, that’s a little creepy.

Trust me, you do not want to walk into that field.

Just let me finish bringing the connection online—\n\n**REX:**\nNo, wait!\n\n**VENILIA:**\n//(over the radio)//\nData link established. Accessing. The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plain. All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. I enjoy the sight of humans on their knees. Mary had a little lamb, its fleece was white as snow, and everywhere that Mary went, the lamb was sure to go.\n\n//The radio connection cuts out.//\n\n**REX:**\nDammit, she did it.\n\n//Sounds of movement can be heard coming from all directions. Something is coming.//\n\n**KELLY:**\nThat doesn’t sound good.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nCommander, Sergeant Phelps.\n\n**MARKS:**\nPleased to meet you, Sergeant, but we’ll do pleasantries later – it sounds like we’re about to have company. Defensive positions, everyone.\n\n//Fade to MUSIC.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ **ACT IV**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/neptune-station/NS_ActIV_0527.mp3]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Act IV Transcript\" hide=\"- Hide Act IV Transcript\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n++* INT. OBJECT\n\n//The sounds of dozens of creatures echo from all sides – something is coming for Omega-4. A lot of somethings. It is not entirely clear what these things are; they shriek and scuttle and make all sorts of hellish – this is an opportunity to pull out all the stops on scary sounds.//\n\n**MARKS:**\nHere they come: check your targets.\n\n//The monsters arrive. A firefight ensues. Dozens of creatures scream while attacking, only to be cut down by the constant firing of the team. One security officer is killed horribly (and noisily), then another, then another; all cry out in pain as they are torn limb from limb, disemboweled, and otherwise killed in gut-wrenchingly terrible ways. Eventually, the tide of attackers stops, leaving the sounds of battle echoing hollowly through the chamber.//\n\n**REX:**\nIs that all of them?\n\n//A monster shrieks as it leaps forward. Brandt shoots it.//\n\n**BRANDT:**\n//(cocking her shotgun)//\nNow it is.\n\n**MARKS:**\nIs everyone alright?\n\n**PHELPS:**\nWell, we just lost Hawkins, Rossetti, and Markov.  Svenson, you okay?\n\n**SVENSON:**\nYeah. ...I hate those things.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nCommander, Sergeant Phelps. This is Machinist’s Mate Svenson.\n\n**MARKS:**\nSergeant. I’m Marks, this is Chief Brandt and Doctor Rex. Emm Tee Eff Omega Four. I take it you know Dr. Kelly?\n\n**PHELPS:**\nYeah.\n\n**KELLY:**\nIf you say so.\n\n**REX:**\nShe seems to have lost her memory.\n\n**MARKS:**\nWhat in the bloody hell were those things?\n\n**SVENSON:**\nThey used to be the crew.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nLooks like they bled the stuff we saw on the wall.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nLieutenant Douglas ordered me and my team to set a bomb to destroy Echo-2157 because of them.\n\n**REX:**\nHow positively simple-minded of him. “I don’t understand this scary thing so I’m going to blow it up.” Sergeant, do you have any idea how moronic an idea that was? That bomb will tear a hole in the fabric of spacetime.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nMy superior gave me an order, Doctor. I follow orders.\n\n**REX:**\nAh, yes, “yours is not to reason why” and all that. Well good for you. We need to get to that bomb and disable it before it destroys this half of the solar system.\n\n//A woman calls down to Omega-4.//\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nHey, a little help here?\n\n**SVENSON:**\nWho was that?\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nUp here, asshole.\n\n//A woman in a bright orange jumpsuit emblazoned with the number “17” is standing high above them on the ceiling.//\n\n**PHELPS:**\nAh, hello Seventeen.\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nScrew you, Sergeant.\n\n**KELLY:**\nHer name is “Seventeen”?\n\n**PHELPS:**\nNo – she’s a D-Class. Death Row convict recruited to help in dangerous experiments. Her designation is D-2157-03-17: so, Seventeen.\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nGreat, now everyone knows why I’m called that. Now would you throw me a rope so I can get down from up here?\n\n**MARKS:**\nWhat are you doing up there on the ceiling?\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nOh, I'm checking the pipes... What the hell does it look like I’m doing? I’m standing here waiting for you idiots to get me down. I was being escorted back to the station when me and my guards, Tweedle Dumb and Tweedle Dumber, fell up here to the ceiling. I’ve been stuck up here for hours.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nThey okay?\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nNo, asshole, their necks are broken. Now throw me a rope.\n\n**MARKS:**\nChief?\n\n**BRANDT:**\nOn it.\n\n//Brandt pulls a rope out of her pack and tosses it to Seventeen, who starts climbing down from the ceiling. At the halfway mark, she tumbles to the ground.//\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nOw! Dammit, that hurt!\n\n**REX:**\nCome on, we have to move. The main chamber should be just up ahead.\n\n++* INT. OBJECT MAIN CHAMBER\n\n**MARKS:**\nLooks like there’s our bomb. Rex, Brandt, would you kindly disable it?\n\n**SVENSON:**\nI can do it, Commander.\n\n**REX:**\nYou sure, Svenson? It’s incredibly important you not set it off by accident.\n\n**SVENSON:**\nI can handle it. After all, I set the thing.\n\n**REX:**\nAh. Okay.\n\n**SVENSON:**\nIt should only take me a minute or two.\n\n//Svenson gets to work.//\n\n**BRANDT:**\nAm I the only one who thinks this place is weird?\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nNo shit, Sherlock.\n\n**REX:**\nI wouldn’t mind spending a few months studying it. There’s so much we could learn.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nThis place messes with your head. The angles of the walls just seem wrong.\n\n**REX:**\nWell, that’d be non-Euclidian geometry for you, Sergeant. Comes from the warped spacetime. Nothing to be terribly worried about.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nGives me the creeps.\n\n**PHELPS:**\nOh, yeah. I can’t wait to get out of here – see the sun again.\n\n**SVENSON:**\nThere we go, the bomb’s disabled.\n\n**MARKS:**\nExcellent work.\n\n**KELLY:**\nThank you for doing that for us. Now, time to die.\n\n//With a horrible wet and elastic squelching noise, Svenson has his insides turned out. He lets out a blood curdling scream as he dies.//\n\n**PHELPS:**\nWhat the hell?\n\n//Phelps draws his gun and fires at Kelly to no effect.//\n\n**KELLY:**\nBad idea, Sergeant.\n\n//Phelps meets an identical messy fate as Svenson. There is a loud blast like a foghorn from hell, which fades to music.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n+ **ACT V**\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/neptune-station/NS_ActV_0527.mp3]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Act V Transcript\" hide=\"- Hide Act V Transcript\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n++* INT. OBJECT MAIN CHAMBER\n\n//Fade from music to ringing ears. Kelly is speaking. It is unclear whether the mind behind the voice is that of Dr. Kelly, or that of E-2157 itself. The ringing of the ears slowly fades out over the next couple of lines.//\n\n**KELLY:**\nSo pitiful, so pathetic. Our mind is immeasurably superior to yours. You fumble about in the darkness, poking and prodding what you do not understand, something so incomprehensibly beyond you. We are infinitely your greater. You amuse us.\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nShut up, bitch.\n\n//Seventeen leaps at Kelly from behind, stabbing her repeatedly with a shiv. She snaps Kelly’s neck with a sickening crack, but Kelly still tosses Seventeen aside like a ragdoll. Seventeen hits a wall and lands in a heap. Omega-4 starts firing at Kelly. Brandt pulls out a grenade.//\n\n**BRANDT:**\nFrag out!\n\nThe grenade explodes. There is a dying shriek; the monster, so it seems, is dead.\n\n**MARKS:**\nSeventeen! You alright?\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nNo.\n\n**REX:**\nShe’s bleeding out. There’s nothing I can do for her.\n\n**SEVENTEEN:**\nGet your ass’s out of here. Just because we killed the bitch doesn’t mean the monster’s dead.\n\n//Seventeen dies. Ominous sounds, coming from all around, underscore her dying words.

Main engineering, the CIC, and the mess hall are all inaccessible at this time.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nSounds like Commander Howard didn’t make it.\n\n**VENILIA (CONT’D):**\nWarning: don’t throw stones in glass houses. Alert: structural integrity is approaching minimum safe levels. All personnel should eat an apple a day.\n\n**REX:**\nWe should leave before the station implodes.\n\n**MARKS:**\nBack to the minisubs, then.\n\n**REX:**\nNext corridor over.\n\n**VENILIA (CONT’D):**\nDecontamination and pressurization complete.

MINISUB\n\n**BRANDT:**\nThat was a little close for comfort.\n\n**MARKS:**\nIndeed, Chief. Take us back up to the Poseidon. Rex, would you be so kind as to tell me what the hell you were doing just there?\n\n**REX:**\nLike all Foundation submarine research facilities, Neptune Station has a positively buoyant capsule storing the last set of data backups and logs, intended to head to the surface if something goes wrong so we can figure out what happened. I triggered its emergency release – it should beat us to the Poseidon.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nYou mean we could have avoided all that just by triggering a damned buoy? Why didn’t you release that in the first place?\n\n**REX:**\nChief, the station only has – had – one capsule. If I’d released it when we first showed up, we’d now have no data about what’s happened in the last hour. Besides, it would have changed nothing – we would have still had to do our assignment, disarm the bomb—\n\n**BRANDT:**\nFair enough.\n\n**REX:**\nIn any case, I seriously doubt Dr. Kelly would have just gone off the deep end like that.\n\n**MARKS:**\nWell, it’ll be a bit before the Poseidon lets us out of isolation, which means you two have no excuse to not file your reports to Admiral Hendrickson.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nOh, boy! Paperwork!\n\n**REX:**\nWell, Commander, you going to recommend an indefinite closure of Sector 23?\n\n**MARKS:**\nI’m not sure. I know you were talking about lots of benefits earlier, but that place just seems too dangerous until we understand what caused things to go to hell this time.\n\n**REX:**\nAgreed. I hate to say it, but I’m going to have to recommend the research be suspended.\n\n**BRANDT:**\nSuspended? The project should be abandoned. Too many good people died today for no good reason.\n\n**MARKS:**\nAt least we made it out. This time, at least.\n\n//Fade to music and credits.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n+ **Credits**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Credits\" hide=\"- Hide Credits and Post-Credit Scene Transcript\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n**Cast:**\n: Lieutenant Commander Benjamin Marks : Andy Bouchard\n: Chief Petty Officer Brandt : Taylor LaCasse\n: Doctor Rex : Neil Hornby\n: Overseer : John Christensen\n: Admiral Hendricksen : John Davidson\n: Lieutenant Commander Howard : Emily Sturman\n: Doctor Abigail Kelly : Francesca Garcia\n: Doctor Henry Stevens : Chris Densmore\n: D-2157-03-17 (\"Seventeen\") : Kaitlin Randolph\n: VENILIA : Hillary Barbetta\n: Sergeant Phelps : Woody Kaine\n: Seaman Svenson : Alex Brewer\n: //SCPS Poseidon// Crewman : Grace Zahrah\n**Crew:**\n: Director : Neil Hornby\n: Executive Producer : Laska Jimsen\n: Producer : Neil Hornby\n: Production Company : [http://blackknightguild.wikidot.com/ Black Knight Guild Productions]\n: Distributor : [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/tf-alpha-440 Task Force Alpha-440]\n: Writer : Neil Hornby\n: Sound Engineer : Neil Hornby\n: Sound Effects : Neil Hornby\n: Music : Neil Hornby\n: Creative Consultants : Hillary Barbetta, Robert Daniels, Sam Dunnewold, Francesca Garcia, Abigail Han, Kelly Mayo, Justin Moor, Emily Sturman, Grace Zahrah\n: Special Thanks : Laska Jimsen, [https://apps.carleton.edu/curricular/cams/ Carleton College Cinema and Media Studies Department], CAMS 370 Advanced Production Workshop, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ SCP Foundation Wiki]\n: License : Released under the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/ Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 License].
