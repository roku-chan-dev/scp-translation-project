All forms of sentience and near-sentient life (human/anomalous entities/artificial sentience/plant life) have expressed feelings or symptoms of severe discomfort and anxiety when in SCP-6383’s direct presence. This effect is non-anomalous,  and believed to be a fundamental response in nature.  \n\nIn contrast to all other forms of existing matter, SCP-6383 has yielded consistently negative results when tested for anomalous properties.\n\n**SCP-6383 Testing Results:**\n* Anomaly certainty: 0.00% \n* Potential Object Class: Non-anomalous (100% certainty)\n* APME-Rating[[footnote]]Anomalous Property Manifestation/Escalation Rating[[/footnote]]: 00/00% (average APME-Rating for stop signs: ~45/~23%)\n\nIn contrast, all other forms of life and other existences in the universe display a minimum of 0.05% when measured for anomalous properties, and at least a 0.03% likelihood of becoming anomalous in the future via various circumstances or happenstance (current anomalous prevention protocols and containment efforts to lessen such occurrences are ongoing).\n\nDue to these inherent properties, SCP-6383’s nature is deemed enigmatic by all sentient beings, causing feelings of dissimilarity towards SCP-6383 in comparison to everything else in existence.\n\n**Discovery Log:** SCP-6383 was discovered following Event-6383-Alpha, a universal reality altering event which resulted in all forms of existence obtaining various anomalous properties. This event had initially gone unnoticed, due to a vast majority of these changes being minute and going unnoticed by the major population[[footnote]]Notable examples: Dr. Wesley growing 1cm taller, a HB pencil becoming a slightly different shade of yellow, a blade of grass that grows 0.02cm faster than others surrounding it, Assistant researcher Agnew being able to manifest a single chicken egg in his hand once and never again, an instance of cane toad that when presented with a bowl of milk every ten hours consecutively for three months will vocalise the phrase “I prefer soy” in Russian (Note: Testing confirmed the toad to not actually be lactose-intolerant), etc.[[/footnote]]. In response, the Foundation developed the APME-Rating system to confirm changes between baseline normality as compared to before Event-6383-Alpha.\n\nSCP-6383 was found several months after the event, having been the least affected by these alterations. Due to it being the sole “non-anomalous” object remaining from before the event, SCP-6383 has been placed in a specialised “exclusion chamber” to decrease the risks that may come from exposure to the anomalous reality around it.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6382]]] | SCP-6383 | [[[SCP-6384]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** STOP sign.jpg\n> **Author:** Bidgee\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:STOP_sign.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
