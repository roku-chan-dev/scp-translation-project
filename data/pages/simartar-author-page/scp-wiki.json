After I got my two greenlights, I started working on a draft. While I was throwing the sandbox link around in #thecritters, Boogey caught sight of it and took interest in co-authoring. I accepted, and we started reworking my messy draft. \n\nWhile the basic elements were always there, Boogey supplied an overarching narrative, focused the scope, and brought the Foundation into the UIU-GOC party. They were ever-present in that stage of that process, and I don't think the article would've turned out as well as it did without their help.\n\nIf you're wondering, my personal favourite part of this tale has to come down to this line: \n\n\"Far away in Washington D.C., Theodore McKinney settled into a polished wooden chair, at a polished wooden table, across from a wooden Polish man.\"\n\nDon't remember which one of us came up with that line, but it's still hilarious.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**A Clean, Fast End:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ...well, that got dark\" hide=\" - close\"]]\n\nThis is what I originally joined the site to write, pretty much. SCP-079 stuck with me for whatever reason, and when an idea for a tale around it popped in my head I joined up and tried to pitch it as my first. Didn't go over so well, so I shelved it.\n\nFast forward a month and a half, and I've got three articles on the site and pull it back out. After a month of drafting it, cursing my choice to use so many divs every time I forgot a bracket, and showing it to anyone in #thecritters that'd listen (during which time Cerastes put up their excellent take on -079), I put it up. It's been my favourite to write, and I hope you enjoyed it too.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**SCP-4527: Crippling Indecision**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ open?\" hide=\"- close\"]]\n\nQuick note: a full explanation of what I was going for with the skip is on the author post.\n\nSo, this changed a lot when I was writing it -- it started with a much more junior main character who was struggling with a lot of insecurity, but that strayed a bit too close to a lot of other skips that did it a whole lot better. In the end I ended up keeping the general idea -- main character gets increasingly dependent on the app, to the point where their sanity starts slipping -- but also included a lot more implications that the app is manipulating them. I'm generally the type of reader that needs to be bonked on the head with a baseball bat shaped like the article's narrative, so I'm kind of surprised it ended up the way it is. It was a fun thing to try though, and regardless of whether that part clicked right away, I hope you enjoyed it.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**SCP-5794: Drowning**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ \"...they say drowning is the worst way to die.\" \" hide=\"- close\"]]\n\nAfter I finished SCP-4527, I found myself drifting away from the site. I popped back in IRC from time to time in intermittent bursts of inspiration, and started a tale draft at one point, but otherwise took my writing elsewhere. Then, about a year and a half into this hiatus I was once again popping back into IRC when out of the dusty depths of my imagination sprung forth a fully-formed SCP concept. Despite my hopes that I could make it into some lighter and cheerier than my previous series of works, I ended up with SCP-5794. It's another dark character piece like some of my previous works, but it's also my first attempt at any ambiguity -- was the anomaly using Kato, or was Kato using the anomaly? \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
