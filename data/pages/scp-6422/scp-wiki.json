Zeta-7 reserves the right to turn away or imprison any tresspassers on sight. The 'danger region' of SCP-6422 is to be updated regularly.\n\nAccess to the chamber containing SCP-6422 by more than one individual at a time is prohibited. The Primary Research Facility (PRF) is built directly on top of the cave containing SCP-6422. Personnel at the PRF are to be kept to a minimum at all times. All non-active personnel must remain in their quarters until they begin working or evacuate the premises immediately. Personnel on-site are expected to perform multiple tasks outside of their stated duties, including but not limited to janitorial duties and supply delivery in an effort to minimize personnel on-site.\n\nA psychologist must be present on-site at all times. All work shifts at Site 337 will begin with a mandatory psychological evaluation. In the event that the psychologist on-site deems any individual unfit to begin their shift they are to return to their chambers immediately. All work in which more than one individual must be present must be conducted in the presence of a psychologist. The psychologist is not allowed to speak to any personnel for the duration of the shift except in the event of signs of uncontrolled heightened aggression between present staff, in which case they are authorized to use any tactics up to and including a provided tranquilizer gun to isolate affected parties.\n\nInvestigation into the ruins surrounding SCP-6422 is prohibited at this time. \n\nAll instances of SCP-6422-1 which are found alive are to be detained immediately for questioning.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6422 is a cylindrical obelisk measuring approximately ten meters in height, tapering in diameter from the bottom to the top. SCP-6422 is comprised primarily of polished granite from the surrounding mountain range. Within the structure of the granite are several intrusions containing the wood of various tree species endemic to the region. The cells within the wood material are living, despite no obvious source of sustenance. Micro-structural analysis of the cells suggests that at some point during the creation of the obelisk, the cells rapidly flooded in through the base of the obelisk, acting as a viscous liquid.\n\nSCP-6422 is contained within a circular cave approximately ███ meters above sea level in a remote region of the Altai Mountains in Siberia. The inside of the cave is temperate at all times of year, even though there is a horizontal entrance and a natural skylight in the roof of the cave. Within this cave exist several flora and fungi species with anomalous properties [[footnote]]See Addendum 2 for details[[/footnote]].\n\nIt is possible for an individual to become 'attuned' to SCP-6422, at which point they begin manifesting the anomalous capacity to alter the shape, function, and structure of living plant matter around them. They are henceforth designated as SCP-6422-1. It is currently unknown how exactly this attunement process is accomplished, though several theories have been proposed. Selected instances of this power becoming manifest are documented in Addendum 2. All instances of SCP-6422-1 have been terminated or are currently unaccounted for. \n\nSCP-6422's secondary anomalous effects manifest when there are two or more people in close proximity within a region labeled the 'danger region' which currently spans a circular region of approximately 5 kilometers centered on SCP-6422. When two individuals within the 'danger region' engage in any conversation, verbal or nonverbal, the probability that the conversation will drift towards a topic in which the two will disagree appears to increase substantially. Upon reaching a disagreement, the two conversants will become fixated on the disagreement, escalating in conversational aggression, until finally both conversants engage in physical violence until one or both parties have collapsed or expired. \n\nThe 'danger region' is currently expanding at a rate of approximately █ meters per day. The rate at which the 'danger region' expands appears to increase considerably if conflict is occurring within the 'danger region', and has been observed traveling in excess of ████ meters per day. Research into the conditions which control the expansion of the 'danger region' are considered a top-level priority.\n\nWithin the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 exists the abandoned remains of an anomalous civilization which made extensive use of SCP-6422 for various purposes. The remains suggest the civilization used the powers of SCP-6422 for structural, agricultural, and religious ends which were heavily incorporated into daily activities.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"smaller-g\"]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n= [[span class=\"adden\"]]Addenda[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"smaller-g\"]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n\n**Testing Logs and Supplementary Documents**\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show =\"+ Addendum 1: Notable Tests and Events Pertaining to SCP-6422\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n||||||~ Addendum 1: Notable Tests and Events Pertaining to SCP-6422||\n||~ Incident/Test Label ||~ Conditions of Incident/Test ||~ Incident/Test Results ||\n||< Test-6422-01 ||< A remotely piloted drone with various sampling equipment was sent into the chamber containing SCP-6422 ||< No ill effect was observed on the unmanned drone. Material properties of SCP-6422 were established. A condensed list of observed collected species can be found in Addendum 2. ||\n||< Test-6422-02 ||< A single D-Class was instructed to enter the cave and remain there for one week. At several points during this period, the D-Class is instructed to consume several anomalous plant species which were independently determined to be safe for consumption. ||< No behavioral ill-effects were observed for the entire duration. All consumed plant species had expected effects based on previous laboratory analysis. ||\n||< Test-6422-03 ||< Two D-class were instructed to walk towards the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 and begin conversation. || At roughly ████ meters from SCP-6422, the two D-Class rapidly changed subjects to a discussion on sports. The discussion rapidly deteriorated over the course of one minute into ad hominem, before abruptly erupting into physical conflict, at which point the two D-Class were tranquilized. ||\n||< Test-6422-04 ||< Identical to Test-6422-03, performed within fifteen minutes of Test-6422-03. ||< Results identical to Test-6422-03, except it is noted that the 'danger region' had expanded by roughly █ meters, more than the 'danger region' of SCP-6422 expands on a typical day. ||\n||< Incident-6422-02 ||< A small construction crew was brought into the chamber containing SCP-6422. The goal of the crew was to remove SCP-6422 from its current position into a more manageable position at a dedicated site. The crew was instructed not to speak and is to be guided through earpieces connected from a safe distance. ||< The crew were initially unsuccessful in moving SCP-6422, appearing to encounter a root system which rapidly regenerated upon physical damage. A proposal was made by a remote operative over earpiece to alter the removal plan, to which one member of the crew appeared to nod. Immediately after this, a second member of the crew non-verbally signaled disapproval, at which point the two crew members engaged in a small nonverbal disagreement which evolved into a melee involving two-thirds of the crew. After the combat had finished, all surviving crew members were instructed to remain in place as a task force was sent to collect the construction crew. Total casualties: 4. ||\n||< Test-6422-05 ||< An unmanned drone equipped with a saw blade made of an anomalously hardened and strengthened steel alloy was tasked with the uprooting of SCP-6422. ||< The drone was unsuccessful in removing SCP-6422 from its position; the saw blade became ineffectively dull after  less than eight minutes of continuous use. ||\n||< Test-6422-06 ||< After collecting propagatable samples from all plant species in the cave, several C4 charges were planted at the base of SCP-6422, with consideration given to minimize damage to SCP-6422. ||< After the detonation of the charges, SCP-6422 was successfully wrested from the ground. The anomalous properties of SCP-6422 did not abate. Over the course of the subsequent week, a new instance of SCP-6422 grew in the place of the previous one. The separated SCP-6422 possessed no detectable anomalous properties. [[footnote]]Though this test suggests our understanding of the structure of SCP-6422 is incomplete, more testing must be done before the anomaly is redefined. Following Incident-6422-03 such testing has become more difficult to approve and thus resources have been dedicated to alternative routes for SCP-6422's permanent containment. -Site Director Rayleigh, 06/04/20██[[/footnote]] ||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show =\"+ Addendum 2: An Abridged Inventory of Plant and Fungus Species Found Within SCP-6422\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n||||||~ Addendum 2: An Abridged Inventory of Plant and Fungus Species Found Within SCP-6422||\n||~ Location of Recovery ||~ Plant Classification/Closest Relative Name ||~ Altered or Anomalous Properties ||\n|||||| Note: A total of 179 identified species which have not been altered to an anomalous degree have been removed for reading convenience.

Mushroom has been observed growing on nutrient poor soils including sand, concrete, and shredded plastic. ||\n||< Fields Surrounding SCP-6422 ||< Carex Sp./\"Carnation Sedge\" ||< Two different varieties have been identified, one with the upper flower enlarged and a vestigial lower flower, and one with an enlarged lower flower and vestigial upper flower. The upper flower on the former may be processed easily into a sort of flour and the lower flower on the latter is edible off of the stem, with an \"undescribable sweet taste (sic)\".

All walkable surfaces appear to be comprised of buffed, lacquered silver birch, while all walls are constructed of Siberian larch. All window frames appear to be made of Siberian Pine which has been altered significantly; the sap produced by the trees is clear and rapidly cures upon contact with air into a glassy substance which comprises the windows. The byproduct of this curing is a volatile liquid which is odorless but appears to possess insecticidal properties. The structures generated in this manner range from simpler houses to complex and multi-storied housing. Site 3b possesses a now defunct watermill. The details of the construction of these buildings are largely unknown.||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show =\"+ Addendum 3: Catalog of Testing Requests by Date\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n||||||~ Addendum 3: Catalog of Testing Requests by Date||\n||~ Date of Request/Requestor ||~ Nature of Request ||~ Verdict on Request/Reasoning ||\n|||||| Note: --Dr. Johnathan ███ is no longer permitted to make testing requests.-- Dr ███ has been transferred off of Site 337 and may not be returned to Site 337. -Director Rayleigh||\n||< 04/22/20██; Dr. Brich ||< Permission to collect samples from within SCP-6422's chamber using unmanned drone. ||< Granted. -Site Dir.

Full documentation requests may be made to the Clerical Office of Site 337, at [REDACTED].\n\nIncident-6422-01 began on 03/30/20██ when the following internal Russian Federation memo detailing an armed conflict between representatives of the ████████ Prospecting Company was intercepted by MTF Iota-10 \"Damn Feds\" operatives:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-001\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Memo Acquired at 12:13 on 03/30/20██.

Several members of ██████ were interviewed, but ultimately no new information was revealed. All combatant parties were successfully amnesticized and all evidence of ██████'s claim to the area was removed from federal and corporate documentation. After a brief monologue with the Russian Federation, control of the site was transferred to the Foundation.\n\nIt was discovered during the de-escalation period that the region surrounding SCP-6422 was occupied by an undocumented civilization of instances of SCP-6422-1. What minimal linguistic and genetic analysis that was performed during this period suggests an admixture of Turkic-speaking steppe peoples, ethnic Mongols, and an undescribed culture and genotype, likely originating in Siberia. Foundation linguists suggest that the undescribed culture may be ████████ in nature, meaning the earliest date of divergence is roughly 12██ CE. The language spoken by the locals was sufficiently similar to modern Mongolian for a pidgin to be constructed for communication.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-002\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Recorded Interview Conducted at 16:33 on 04/01/20██.

I was told by other people here that you would be able to tell me where your people came from. \n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** Ah, of course. My family has been tasked with the preservation of the (Daekhiil) for {27 generations}. Shall I begin?\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** Please. \n> \n> //SCP-6422-1-1 clears his throat.//\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** {Long before} the time of (Daekhiil), the █████ walked the Earth. The █████ was cruel and had many heads. █████ was one time so large that she wrapped her tail around the ocean far to the east where she did battle with the ocean, and the mountains far to the west where she did battle with the {men of earth and metal}. █████ kept men in chains and performed acts of blood upon the ground with the blood of those men. However those heads of the █████ were made weak by her fighting. By {5 generations} before the (Daekhiil) the █████ had grown so weak from her wars that it had shrunken into a pit to the north and east of here. And then all at once the ocean to the east swallowed █████ whole. The blood of █████ mixed with the earth and the salt and water of the ocean and the (Daekhiil) was made {32 generations} ago from the {holy broth}. \n> \n> **Dr. ███:** This is how it happened?\n> \n> //SCP-6422-1-1 chuckles.//\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** If history were not made easy to tell then it would not be told. Perhaps some of the history is embellished. But the answer to your question is certainly mostly yes.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** And you are the (Daekhiil)?\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** Yes. Well, not quite. There is more to the story. The people who comprise the (Daekhiil) were born from dirt and not from others so a {great promise} had to be created by them for it could not be inherited. So our forebearers said amongst themselves that they hold the following {great promise} in their hearts and share that {great promise} with their children. There is no mud greater than any other mud. No person may cast blood upon the earth as █████ did. The seeds of the earth may guide us and we may guide those seeds of the earth. There is no power of the (Daekhiil) that is a power of one person. To make the (Daekhiil) eternal the obelisk was made (Daekhiil) so that one piece exists in physical stone for all time.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** So the obelisk is also the (Daekhiil)?\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** The obelisk is the (Daekhiil) and the {great promise} is the (Daekhiil) and the people of this town are the (Daekhiil). Anyone who does not possess all three is not (Daekhiil).\n> \n> //There is a short pause.//\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** What were to happen if these promises were broken?\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** All those who break the {grand promise} of the (Daekhiil) may not commune with the obelisk of the (Daekhiil) until they have atoned. Periods of hardship usually follow such a transgression.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** And how does one atone?\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** Atonement can only be done by sharing the (Daekhiil) as a gift to those who have never received the (Daekhiil). Some transgressions require sharing with only one other person. Some require many.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** Alright, thank you for your time.\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-1:** Likewise.

Minimal resistance from locals was encountered. \n\nThe majority of recorded information during the period of 04/03/20██ and 04/06/20██ was collected by Dr. Johnathan ███.

The exact time of arrival of the GOC detachment is unknown as Foundation Personnel failed to report the GOC intrusion before armed combat broke out.

They appear to have arrived from due west, setting up their base of operations on the western side of the valley. A brief internal communication intercepted shortly after their arrival suggest a liaison to the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts, though this connection is tenuous and not sufficiently established with available evidence:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-004\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Transmission captured at 09:20 on 04/04/20██.//\n> \n> //Note: Transmission has been translated from Russian.//\n> \n> **Commander Maskhadan:** This is Commander Aslan Maskhadan to all warriors of the Almighty.

Some robots and some other mercenaries came through and dragged three Russians out and shot them and one was dragging some radio wires out along with him.

The earth has been shaking all night from bombs. There's been so many fires, it's way hotter in this valley than it was yesterday. Normally there's something in the Foundation's brain that tells it to stop bombing when there's nothing more to gain but they've just been raining it all this time! This has to be something with (Daekhiil) but I'm absolutely clueless.\n> \n> **SCP-6422-1-4:** Surely you must recognize at this point that your Foundation had no plans to protect us!

The only message sent is \"This is Dr. ███ of [DATA EXPUNGED] of the SCP Foundation. There's enemies everywhere. We're dying. Send more backup.\"\n\nAt 17:29 on 04/04/20██, by 11-2 O5 decision, the remaining two companies of AMTF Nu-7 were sent to SCP-6422's location. At 19:55 the same day, Nu-7 entered the valley from the north and headed southeast. It was determined that the optimal course of action would be to push the GOC detachment out of the pass and down the valley into Chechen Dawn, at which point the GOC and the Chechen Dawn would be trapped between Foundation armaments and the PSHUD/mercenary battalion controlled by MC&D and the unknown benefactor.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-003e\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Recording captured at 21:35 on 04/04/20██.//\n> \n> //Audio is initially too loud to decipher anything distinct.

A negotiated peace was reached between the GOC and the Foundation which guaranteed the return of all GOC resources in exchange for evacuation from Site 337. The PSHUD/mercenary force did not advance eastward into the valley, ceding this territory to the Foundation. The stalemate stood as it was for approximately six hours. At 09:21 a transmission was sent by AMTF General Cardamom to outside Foundation operatives:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-008\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Transmission received at 09:21 on 04/04/20██.//\n> \n> **General Cardamom:** Attention to all current Foundation operatives. Betrayal has been crawling through this valley this entire day. Earlier this morning when the GOC and the Chechen Dawn were pushed into a corner, they decided to kill each other like crabs in a bucket rather than stand and fight with honor. Now, on this brisk morning, I hear that there are traitors among our own ranks. People who would shoot their comrades in the back to steal the glory or the favor of the Foundation or worse, the SCP itself. I will not be tolerant of these snakes! I will make sure that every one of them has been captured or ground to dust, on my own name! I will issue no further warning. This crawling betrayal means war.\n> \n> //End transmission.// \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\nAt this moment, a detachment of Nu-7 stationed directly north of the PRF forcibly took the building from on-site control. The detachment of Nu-7 residing in the valley began mobilizing for combat against the rogue detachment. It appears that the following communication was had between 'Magpie' and 'Abraham J.' was had at least partially in response to this movement.  \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-009\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Transmission captured at 09:23 on 04/04/20██.//\n> \n> **Magpie:** Hello, Abe. \n> \n> **Abraham J.:** Magpie?! You haven't contacted me in days! This is very nearly a breach of our own agreement. There will be consequences to our future business if I don't-\n> \n> **Magpie:** Can it, Mr. Disruptor, I've come to inform you that our agreement is off. MC&D has informed me that they will be taking the anomaly personally. Oh, and they'll be //doubling// my paycheck when I get it. Unfortunately, the decision's kind of past me at this point, y'know?\n> \n> **Abraham J.:** This is an outrage! You are doing a disservice to the mass anomaly production industry! Give me back my money!\n> \n> **Magpie:** Don't you worry, you will be receiving your money back as soon as I get around to that. Our QA team will cut you a check by this time next week. As of now, there will be no further communication between us. Have a nice day.\n> \n> **Abraham J.:** YOU-\n> \n> //End transmission.//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\nAfter the termination of this communication, Dr. ███ captures a photograph of the PSHUD units moving on the special operations mercenaries. The picture is annotated \"They just started shooting at their own men. It loooks like there are more robots coming (sic)\".\n\nFollowing the liquidation of the mercenary force of Abraham J. the PSHUD units began sweeping eastward into the valley. It is likely that at this point the valley contingency of Nu-7 collapsed and the MC&D forces took the valley, pushing Nu-7 up into the eastern ridge. This larger portion of Nu-7 simultaneously appears to have taken the PRF back from the rogue faction between 12:00 and 13:00 according to eyewitness accounts and subsequent investigations. At this point, the PSHUD units appear to have stopped chasing Nu-7 up the mountain. Further video from Dr. ███ suggests that at some pint prior, the Serpent's Hand became involved. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-003f\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n>  //Recording captured at 13:41 on 04/05/20██.//\n> \n> //Note: Parts of this video have been translated from Mongolian.

At approximately 20:30 on 04/05/20██ the PSHUD units begin a final offensive up the eastern ridge in an attempt to take the PRF. It is unknown at this time whose initiative it was, but at 00:20 on 04/06/20██, a strong EMP event was detected in the area of Site 337. One final transmission is collected from Magpie immediately following this event.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-010\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Transmission recorded at 00:21 on 04/06/20██.//\n> \n> **Magpie:** This is to that MC&D operative I spoke to a couple of days ago.

I hope it didn't get my radio. I expect the Foundation to overtake my position in about 10 minutes if I don't move and they don't start fighting again. \n> \n> //There is a brief pause in communication.//\n> \n> **Magpie:** I don't have the target, so you can go ahead and write off those bots and the pay you promised me for the artifact's return.

Magpie is currently unaccounted for and all attempts to trace their location after the events of Incident-6422-01 have been unsuccessful.\n\nNo Foundation communications devices appear to have survived the EMP event. However, one final recording provided by Dr. ███ suggests that infighting once again broke out within Nu-7 before 06:23 on 04/06/20██:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 4: Incident-6422-01-Document-003g\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n> //Recording captured on 06:23 on 04/06/20██.//\n> \n> //Dr. ███ begins recording in the PRF.

Dr. ███ is immediately hailed from off screen by then Site Director Dr. Wilson, who has taken shelter in the cave surrounding SCP-6422.//\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** Johnathan? Where have you been?\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** Dr. Wilson sir, you're alive? Oh thank God the person I need to talk to right now. I've been down in the valley and I think I've figured out how to get this thing under control!\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** Under control? It hasn't been doing anything though.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** No it has! I spoke to the people down in the valley and then to a guy with the Serpent's Hand and-\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** The Serpent's Hand?! They're lying to you! They must want it too!\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** No you're succumbing to it right now. Sir the SCP wants us to fight over it. That's how it's-\n> \n> //Dr. Wilson is seen standing up, visibly upset.//\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** Nonsense. The obelisk just does low grade thaumatic phyto and mycokinetic properties. We just haven't had time to figure out how it's done because of all of these other orgs trying to take it from us. Actually I bet the Serpent's Hand guy wanted it too, so he threw us off the scent!\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** Doctor please listen to me! It's not just an obelisk it's some sort of metaphysical entity that exists as a-\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** I've seen no evidence of that. Also, why did you bring a gun in here on your back?\n> \n> //At this moment in conversation, the two conversants become visibly aggressive.//\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** //Because//, I've been fighting through a war zone that //we// caused! We've been trying to contain the SCP but-\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** We are the SCP Foundation. There are no 'buts' about SCP. It's what we do, and maybe if you'd been here doing real research instead of gallivanting off with some illiterates we'd have figured out how to turn this thing on our enemies by now!\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** We //are// the SCP Foundation! And We failed in our mission to secure and protect that village down the mountain! If Hammer Down hadn't been too busy having an internal dick measuring contest we could have saved hundreds of people!\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** You are //out of line//, John. Stand down and just help me finish categorizing these plants here.\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** I'M OUT OF LINE?! YOU ARE A TRAITOR TO THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FOUNDATION! YOU ARE A DESTROYER. YOU DIDN'T PROTECT SHIT!\n> \n> **Dr. Wilson:** ALRIGHT THEN ███ COME HERE-\n> \n> //The camera is dropped as Dr. ███ and Dr. Wilson engage in hand-to-hand combat. The fight slowly moves off screen as the two personnel fight. After a brief off-screen fight, three gunshots can be heard. Both men fall silent as gunshots and munitions can be heard in the background. After a pause, Dr. ███ begins sobbing off screen for several minutes. The cave begins to brighten as the sun rises. Dr. ███ stops sobbing, and shuffling is heard as he moves to pick up the camera. The camera pans to reveal that his face is swollen from a bruise on the left eye, and he has recently dried his own tears. He sighs heavily, looking off-screen behind him briefly before speaking. His voice is hoarse.//\n> \n> **Dr. ███:** Well, then. I guess that's it then.\n> \n> //End transmission.//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\nAt this point it was determined that the situation had escalated beyond control. By unanimous O5 decision Protocol 011213-Sandman was initiated, releasing a powerful lingering airborne hypnotic over Site 337. MTF Beta-7 \"Maz Hatters\" was deployed to perform cleanup and personnel recovery within the affected region. By this point the mechanisms of SCP-6422 were sufficiently well understood that a plan of action was capable of being put into place to minimize contact between MTF members during cleanup.\n\nAn estimated ████ casualties were reported, of which ████ were Foundation personnel. A total of ███ individuals involved in the event are currently unaccounted for, of which ██ are considered to be high priority targets. The incident cost an estimated $5.3 billion USD. After protracted negotiations with the GOC, Site 337 became Foundation property on 04/15/20██. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Addendum 5: Incident-6422-03\n| hide=- Close Document\n]]\n\nAt 19:22 on 05/21/20██, Dr. Johnathan ███ was reported missing from the PRF during his shift. Evidence left behind suggested that Dr. ███ had gone into the valley in a violation of protocol. MTF-Zeta-7 \"Marriage Counseling\" was dispatched to track Dr. ███. At 23:46, Dr. ███ was successfully tracked to one of the buildings in the region originally inhabited by SCP-6422-1 instances, holding a small, woven basket, the contents of which are currently unknown. After being confronted, Dr. ███ left with minimal resistance. Dr. ███ was transferred from Site 337 into custody at Site ██ the following day. A psychological evaluation found [DATA EXPUNGED], and afterwards was transferred to Site ███ for long-term work.\n\n//Look, I know that what we all experienced those days were hard. It was especially hard for you, I know, or at least I've been told. I think you really need to step away from this project. You haven't been batting 1000 with the work you've done, you know? A break and a new project to work on should get you back into shape. Good luck on all the future projects you're on, kid.//\n\n[[>]]\n-Site Director Rayleigh, 05/22/20██.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6421]]] | SCP-6422 | [[[SCP-6423]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
