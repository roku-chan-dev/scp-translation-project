It is made of metal. Turning it to the right or left opens the door to which it is affixed. It has a lock, which is used to impede the intended action of turning the doorknob so as to not allow individuals to access the rooms beyond. \n\n[[include component:image-block name=knob2.JPG|caption=Another doorknob that is not SCP-7143-J.|width=250px]]\n\nSCP-7143-J was installed by maintenance associate J.

When I came back later, it was unlocked. This is how locks work.\n\n> **Dr. Hughes:** ███████████ ████ ███████ █████████ █████ ███████ ███ █████  ██████ ███████ ███ ██████ ███ ██████ ██████████████████████████ ██████████████████████████ ████████████.\n> //**Note:** Dr. Hughes' computer appears to be malfunctioning. -Dr. Clef//\n\n> **Researcher Axwell:** Sometimes I turn it to the left, and sometimes to the right. Doors are useful.\n\n> **Dr. Lee:** I once saw somebody cleaning SCP-7143-J.
