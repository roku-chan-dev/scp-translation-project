Depending on several variables, conditions may be met where the temporal flow is halted but the affected portion of reality continues to exist, suspended from local time. This phenomena is relatively simple and is generally easy to reverse by stabilizing local Hume levels.\n> \n> Discrepancies within a spatio-temporal environment, despite appearing to contradict them, generally manifest within the confines allowed by physics. When the converse of the above occurs and the spatial continuum of an area is halted though the temporal flow continues, several reactions are expected to occur. When matter is suspended from space, the law of conservation of energy remains true. As a result, the affected matter enters a state of \"Paradoxical Existence\", in which it exists in some form outside of baseline reality. Should the law hold true, matter entering such an affected area will be subjected to the same state.\n> \n> Paradoxical Existence differs from the more commonly known \"pocket dimension\". While a pocket dimension is a dimensional space separate from baseline reality, Paradoxical Existence is a state of existence in which a portion of baseline reality exists outside of itself.\n> \n> The resulting area of non-existence left behind in baseline reality is known as the \"break horizon\". To the naked eye, this area appears to be unaffected by discrepancies. However, the fact of the matter is that the affected area no longer exists; the observer instead sees the continuing landscape opposite of the break horizon in place of the reality gap.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-5121 Contact Log B\" hide=\"Hide Contact Log\"]]\n\nOn 07/14/2015, Dr. Williams and Dr. Atmos made contact with Site-AE7 again.\n\n> **SCPiNET v3.0.4**\n> **Terminal:** 065.1\n> **Authorization:** site65.williams\n> \n> \n> ------\n> \n> //Sending connection request...//\n> //Request granted.//\n> //Connected to siteae7.paroux// \n> \n> **[09:07] 065.1:** Dr. Holton, are you there?\n> \n> **[09:07] AE7.2:** FINALLY\n> \n> **[09:07] AE7.2:** I thought my terminal stopped working\n> \n> **[09:08] AE7.2:** This is Liam by the way.

Upon arrival, preliminary test procedures were established and several of the items brought were placed into the break horizon, including supplies of dry rations and bottled water.

This is Doctor Brian Holton, Lead Reality Expert of Site-AE7 which now appears to be permanently fucked. It's fair to say I know a thing or two about paradoxical existence; I wrote the damn book. I guess it's all true too. What an ending.\n\nI can literally feel myself being torn apart at the atoms when I stand near the fence, but it seems stable enough. That's definitely the break horizon on the other side. There's the tiniest breeze, so air from the break horizon must end up here too; explains why we haven't suffocated. The site's backup generator still works too, it runs off of CO2 so it's actually taking care of the air we breathe out... We've been able to survive this long because of it.\n\nWe ran out of food yesterday. Luckily, Paroux managed to get a terminal connected to the outside. It was nice to catch up at first. I asked them to send some supplies. It's for the others, not me. I already know there's no way out.\n\nAnne, I know you aren't ever going to see this, but I love you. I love you so much. I want to hold your hand, hug you, kiss you. I know you think I'm dead and that I have been for a while... I just hope there's some part deep inside you that knows I love you and haven't stopped since I ended up here. I won't be able to see you again in this life, but maybe there's hope that we'll meet in the next.\n\nSee you soon, Anne.\n\n------\n\nFollowing confirmation of Dr. Holton's death, Dr. Atmos returned to Site-177.\n\n> **SCPiNET v3.0.4**\n> **Terminal:** 065.1\n> **Authorization:** site65.williams\n> \n> \n> ------\n> \n> //Sending connection request...//\n> //Request granted.//\n> //Connected to site177.atmos// \n> \n> **[17:44] 065.1:** I'm sorry, Dr. Atmos. Loss is hard.\n> \n> **[17:45] 177.4:** Thank you. We went to school together before we were both recruited to the Foundation. Holton was more than smart, and he seemed certain about his theory. Everything seems to hold true during testing as well. I don't blame him for wanting to see his wife, I just didn't expect him to do... this.\n> \n> **[17:45] 065.1:** I don't understand... Why would he kill himself shortly after making contact with us? He went over a year without anything before...\n> \n> **[17:45] 177.4:** He went that year with hope. I'd guess that it affected him heavily once he figured out Anne thought he was dead. It seemed to be the only thing giving him strength. \n> \n> **[17:45] 065.1:** So is the site lost, then?\n> \n> **[17:46] 177.4:** Not necessarily. We still have contact and way to send supplies, even if it is one-way and Holton's dead. I'm going to update the dossier.
