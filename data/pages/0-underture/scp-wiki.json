Perhaps a very dull, straightforward variety, in contrast with the weirdness of the world. But every cultural context on the planet Earth is flush instead with unlikely heroes, implausible adventures and ludicrous lands in fluorescent profusion. Little in reality compares favourably. There are, in truth, no werewolves, there is no Bigfoot, and there never was any Atlantis. No magic, no telepathy, no immortality, no gods. What is so incredible by comparison about coincidence, or the depths of human depravity, stupidity and cupidity, or plain old bad luck that they should inspire otherwise intelligent human beings to remark upon the details of their banal lives with \"You can't make this stuff up\"? Of course you can. Even a child — especially a child! — could excel in creativity the barebones narratives we term 'truth'. \n\nThe clichés persist nevertheless, for there is comfort in repetition, in not thinking for ourselves, in paying obeisance to the variety of experiences on offer in the domain of the strictly average. Because we don't really want the unreal to outshine the real, much though our souls and imaginations insist that it ought to, because the real is where we live. Truth, we pretend, may yet transcend fantasy.\n\nBut what if we're not pretending at all?\n\nWhat if fantasy is truth, and reality the lie?\n\nFirst allow that cryptids, legendary figures and artifacts of power do indeed exist; it's not so far-fetched when you stack up all the testimony, imperfect and dubious though each fragment might appear in isolation. Next make allowance for forces beyond our ken, universal mechanisms uncompassed by modern science; recall that everything from fire to space travel was once considered magic. Einstein erected a plausible framework for multiversal physics decades ago. New species are discovered in the Amazon daily thanks to deforestation, new diseases blossom annually, globally due to climate change, and each can seem downright peculiar by the standards of what is already known. People disappear without a trace, rigid universal rules are bent out of shape, barriers are broken and dreams come true. The annals of today's science are the archives of yesterday's science fiction. Are our alleged literary inventions so incompatible with the contours of this 'mundane' existence?\n\nIt's really nothing more than a trick of terminology. Our colourless and unwhimsical 'truth' is simply another fiction, and like all fiction, it has an author: a supranational corporate entity driven by the cardinal ambition to clamp down on everything strange and wondrous, to craft a falsehood sufficiently profitable that they can live with it, so convincing and comprehensive that the rest of us can be made to live within it. The logistics of this shadowy cabal's access to money and manpower, and the question of their motivations, need not yet concern us. For now it's enough to know that they exist — we might name them the SCP Foundation — and to go on declaring that truth is stranger than fiction until their agents pass us by, content for the moment with our compliance. It is their axiom, and their control extends to the very meaning of the words. They aren't looking for input, they're not looking for feedback, and our consent is implied in perpetuity. From the heights and depths of their clandestine Outposts, Sites and Areas they watch over or peer up at us, keep us from harm, from knowledge, from fear, from agency. They will worry about ghosts and ghouls and goblins and gremlins so that you and I will never need to, even if that means we'll have no further recourse should their countermeasures fail. Because they haven't, and therefore, they won't. The Foundation has been fighting the nominally good fight for a long, long time, and they know that they know best. They are the final arbiters of truth, of fiction, and of the in-between states of reality itself. Their narrative proceeds largely according to its outline, and they've never once lost the plot.\n\nUntil today.\n\nIt's the eighth of September, 2002 at Site-43.\n\nAnd it will be again.\n\n[[=image TBGO.png]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nSite-43 is impossible.\n\nNot the garden variety of impossible characterizing the (very few) other Sites of its superlative scale, merely ultramodern and covert and impenetrable, but ultramodern, covert, impenetrable and //subterranean.// This vertical dimension stretches the already fanciful premise of an esoteric R&C facility well past the bounds of absurdity, and yet inanimately heedless of its own implausibility, it continues to exist.\n\nThe second thing to strike new arrivals at SCP Foundation Lake Huron Research and Containment Site-43 is that it's far, far too big. It lies fully one thousand metres beneath the surface of the Earth (the first thing to strike new arrivals), so how on and under Earth can it be so ungodly huge? It boasts dormitory capacity for an astonishing, almost inconceivable one thousand human beings. These eager beavers aren't subjected to submarine hot bunks, but instead possess spacious bedrooms and individual washrooms — individual washrooms for one thousand human beings! — and more than sufficient showers, cafeteria, laundrettes, rec rooms, meeting rooms and break rooms to keep them relatively sane in the insane setting of their insane jobs. And that's just the core of the Site, Habitation and Sustenance. The six major Sections under the umbrella of Research and Experimentation are veritable labyrinths of offices, laboratories, test chambers, storage vaults, and whatever a 'wetworks' is. You can get lost in R&E, very easily. You can get half-eaten by something and go undiscovered for hours.

And then there's the block of inescapable containment chambers, full of deadly devices and curious creatures, and the thrumming cavernous refineries of Acroamatic Abatement.

We invented AcroAbate back in the 1920s, under the guidance of the peerless and much-lamented Dr. Wynn Rydderech. That worthy had a dream: a world unburdened by anomalous waste. \"The true unseen killer,” he once called it. “We work so hard to obscure the evidence of its crimes, so that none might tremble at their troubling implications, that we are consequently left alone in our struggle to end its unfathomable spree. If we don't clean up this mess, no-one else will — by our own design.\" As the sea of sorcerous goop rose, he therefore rose up to meet it. Other people could track down werewolves and block up hellmouths and detain mad alchemists; Rydderech would neutralize the noxious esoteric qualities of their shed fur, demonic brimstone, and unnatural tinctures. While the world beyond the Veil scraped coal dust off their whitewashed walls, then washed crude oil off their waterfowl, then siphoned heat off their spent nuclear fuel rods, Rydderech fought to stay ahead of a far more sinister ecological catastrophe: the total subsumption of mankind beneath a generalized magic slurry. With thousands of anomalies in containment, a sizable sum of them producing enough extraordinary effluence to fill up all the mineshafts and deep sea ravines known to geological science, this prophecy of doom carried a startlingly proximal deadline. \n\nBut the prophet's inventive efforts made Area-21 and the Acroamatic Abatement Group the Foundation's, and therefore the world's, foremost experts on converting occult sludge into… well, it varies! Sometimes less harmful, or even merely less heavy, occult sludge. Sometimes coal dust, or petrochemicals, or red-hot nuclear fuel, because what everyone else sees as hardball is just the practice pitch to us. If you're considering a career in AcroAbate, you've probably already got some experience with the small stuff. The stuff that's only killing the planet in logical, predictable ways. You're going to need to get a little crazier if you want to play our game.\n\nOne product of our endless striving to bend esochemistry into a weapon for winning that ever-escalating war is the hyper-advanced abatement facilities at Site-43: the largest acroamatic waste refineries ever constructed, under the public guise of a bog standard water treatment plant. (I'll let you in on a secret: that's what acroamatic means. Secret.) Dr. Rydderech himself laid the first pipes in the 1940s, kicking off a project so involved that he never returned to his home in Vienna. His disciples today understand what he first learned at such great personal cost: our task is a marathon, not a sprint. His sacrifice, an untimely disappearance and presumed death in 1966, was certainly not in vain. \n\nWith a little elbow grease and non-linear thinking, neither will yours be! Our facilities at 21 might not be as new and fancy as the ones at 43, but we treat that as a challenge rather than a liability. Limitations breed creativity, after all. If you want to be a part of the solution, consider joining the AAG, transferring to Austria, and helping keep our collective heads above grey water.\n\nAs for the rest of you, remember this simple dictum: 'If it's yellow, let it mellow; if it's brown, flush it down; if it talks, call the docs!'\n\n[[>]]\n-- Imogen Tarrow, \"A Straightforward and Non-Allegorical Explanation of What Acroamatic Abatement Is\"\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nHow'd we end up wedged in this hole, anyway?\n\nMost people arrive at a ridiculous conclusion first: an elevator shaft was dug one kilometre through earth and rock, then a village's worth of space three storeys tall was tunnelled out over the course of who knows how many years. The effort required to haul that much material up the shaft, and send that much materiel back down, and the stirring lack of any good reason to do so, marks it indelibly as a Thing Which Did Not Happen. More sensible, and therefore closer to the truth, is the notion that the Inter-Sectional Subway System was carved twenty-odd kilometres from its terminal station at the town of Grand Bend to encircle, and thereby define, the demesnes of the present-day Site, which was then hollowed out one Section at a time. The horizontal dimension doesn't beggar belief to bankruptcy so completely as does its vertical counterpart, but still... why dig such a long damn tunnel before settling down? Too obviously tedious for not enough apparent gain.\n\nThe fact is, precious little tunnelling has ever been done — by humans — at Site-43. Its location was no accident, its construction no folly. It would not have been possible to build something like this anywhere else on the planet; its niche wasn't carved out of the living rock by hand or power tools, but rather by the peculiar race of amphibious cats which the Ojibwe call Mishepeshu, the lords of the beneath world. Unbeknownst to the military men who established Camp Ipperwash far above for the Canadian federal Department of Defence, these legendary felines had hacked out a sprawling cave system linking Lake Huron, Lake Superior, and their assorted islands and inland forests whilst all mankind was in barely-metaphorical diapers. They once roamed freely across central North America via these ancient, shadowed highways, and perhaps they do still… though today they're more likely to bide their time in the murk, where they face far less territorial encroachment.\n\nWhen the Foundation discovered this wealth of emptiness where they had only intended to erect a tiny containment Outpost, it seemed like the sort of miracle they were trained to be wary and skeptical of. But it certainly wasn't too good to be true; the cost in workers and resources exacted by the vengeful Mishepeshu during the first year of construction dispelled any lingering atmosphere of fairytale fortuity.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"ASC\"]]\nIt matters how we see ourselves.\n\nWhat we believe we are is reflected in the worlds we create, and the words we use to describe and thereby refine them.

The past century has seen countless battles fought in the endlessly generative realms of the mind, with the development of the scientific fields once known as cryptomancy, imagomancy and audiomancy, now collectively termed //memetics.// The ultimate source of this knowledge has been lost — by which I mean lost, not forgotten or misplaced; connoting even erased would be not inappropriate — but the Foundation acquired it via theft, and reverse engineering. Anomalous artists whose works of literature, art and music held remarkable influence over human thought engaged in ill-advised demonstrations of their craft, some benevolent, many malevolent, and in so doing presented us with the keys to cognition. They had themselves pilfered these powers from an ancient, extinct secret society: the //giftschreiber,// or poison-writers. Modern-day successors to this band of malicious mind-benders did not appreciate our intervention in their //milieux,// staging numerous assaults on Foundation facilities in reprisal over the course of the twentieth century.

We were scattered, demoralized, starved and parched while others flourished in our stead. But as we have done since time immemorial, we persevered… and the signs of our success are written in the stars.

Our opponents, in obvious confusion and disarray, continued to assail facilities beyond the borders of Canada, but the fight seemed to quite go out of them where once they had fought most fiercely. On the other side of the battle lines, we found critical information gone from both our mechanical and biological databases. //Something// had arranged a ceasefire, and nobody knew what that something was.

There was little doubt that a powerful memetic effect was to blame for our collective amnesia, though some have mused darkly on a third explanatory tangent: the fact that physical data has been amended and electronic data deleted suggests our own complicity in the erasure, intentional or not.\n\nIn any case, having played over the course of the conflict no small role in the proliferation of cognitohazards, infohazards, Berryman-Langford kill agents and other destructive memetic effects, Site-43 remained at the forefront of the field.

It rolled down the back of his oilskin, dripping a steady trail on the cave floor behind them.\n\n\"Damp spot for a //rendezvous,//\" he remarked. It was merely a remark, not a complaint. Scout never complained.\n\n\"We don't think they met here.\" The lead agent, a man named Strauss, briefly hooded his lamp to peer into the darkness ahead. \"We're fairly sure they met in the woods, and one of them crawled here when it went south.\"\n\nScout nodded, not that the other man could see it. \"Likely fancied himself safe from discovery.\"\n\nAnd why not; this was, Scout had to admit, an excellent place to hide. He'd endured a hairy ride from the //SCPS Honoré Beaugrand// to the cave mouth, which resembled countless other overhangs of Canadian Shield — the continental crust of North America, exposed in a vast bulwark of reddish rock in a horseshoe around Lake Huron. Though the Shield petered out far to the north, around Georgian Bay, random outcroppings dotted the lower coast along which Scout's escorts had navigated their sleek black launch. The water had been choppy and the weather had been bad, and it had looked to him like the pilot had meant to dash them against a wall of solid stone… but then they had gained the low and narrow aperture, and passed beneath to find themselves within a waterlogged cleft. Scout didn't know much about caves, but he did know they were cramped spaces with potentially deadly stability issues. Spelunking, in his view, was the act of retreating progressively from a place of safety until your surroundings either collapsed on top of you, or you fell down into them, or you simply became irretrievably lost and died of starvation, oxygen deprivation, or injury.\n\nThis wasn't that sort of cave.\n\nThis cave was… well, it was more than one cave, and those caves were //tunnels,// a natural network of comfortably vast thoroughfares burrowed into bedrock. The stone was smooth, there were no stalactites and stalagmites (not that he could have told the crucial difference between these), and a warm breeze prevailed throughout. The only thing claustrophobic about this arrangement was the lack of light, as it was only by the headlamps of his Mobile Task Force that Scout was able to penetrate the subterranean black. He fancied that situation was improving ahead, but it might have been the glare off his large round spectacles.\n\nA thought occurred. \"This can't be a lava tube.\"\n\nStrauss glanced back again, blinking against the brilliance of the other three lamps (and his own, thanks to Scout's pitiless pair of reflectors). \"Sir?\"\n\nThe Director of Project CLIO gestured at the cylindrical passage walls. \"There's no volcanic activity around here. The only thing that could explain formations like this, besides tunnelling, is a volcanic vent pumping out a lava channel. Which is impossible.\"\n\nThe agent shrugged, and resumed his march. \"Then I suppose someone tunnelled it, sir.\"\n\nThis was a statement to which there could be no answer, so they hiked in psuedosilence for a while. Other than the soft tread of combat boots and one pair of creaking Wellingtons, the only sound was the explosively magnified ambient drip of water into distant water which was the sonic signature of very deep places in the earth.\n\n\"He's up ahead,\" Strauss reported. The light Scout had thought he'd glimpsed in the gloom was now more evident, even to his untrained historian's eyes. In short order the tiny base camp resolved itself: Outpost-43, a grandiose title for a few large industrial lamps hooked into generators, a single linen-lined hose snaking out of a narrow crack in the far-distant ceiling to draw out harmful vapours, and a cot on the cave floor accommodating a wizened old man in pastel blue leisurewear, stained vermilion. Three more armed agents surrounded him, and they all saluted when Scout approached. A medic was kneeling beside the cot; he nodded, before turning his attention back to his clipboard (and brushing away a few droplets of water with a grimace).\n\nScout also took a knee, and examined the patient: a plain, unprepossessing face, thinning grey hair and a barrel chest… not unlike Scout himself, actually. He was breathing low, but steady. His skin was tanned and wrinkled — here their appearances markedly diverged — as though someone had ironed out a mess of wet burlap. He wouldn't have stood out in a crowd, but he certainly stood out in a cave. Even lying prone.\n\nThe man's eyes opened. They were slate-grey, clear and alert. He spoke, with obvious difficulty. \"Are you the one?\"\n\nScout tipped his hat politely, and a few more stray drops pattered on the other's pate. \"Vivian Scout. We're not properly acquainted.\"\n\nA wet, pained chuckle, then a breath sucked in through remarkably straight and bright white teeth. \"You've been following me a long time.\"\n\n\"I have, yes.\" Scout tugged a small grey cloth out of his jacket pocket, removed his spectacles and began polishing the lenses. They were one-way glass, clear on his side and opaque on the other, but the clammy cave was generalizing the opacity in a most irritating fashion — not that Scout ever became irritated, at least not visibly. \"And now I've found you. That's a start, at last.\"\n\nThe man groaned. \"You'll be wanting to complete the set.\"\n\n\"Of course. And I don't suppose you'd be willing to coopera—\"\n\n\"//I am a catalyst for master-strokes and follies.//\" It was little more than a hiss, venomous and spite-filled. The man then jolted upright and seized Scout by the lapels — seven weapons snapped up in perfect sync, taking immediate aim — and whispered the second half of the rhyming couplet fiercely into the Director's ear before spasming back on the cot. \"Tell him that,\" the old man sighed. \"See what happens.\"\n\nScout returned his spectacles and the polishing cloth to their appropriate stations, then reached into his jacket again to withdraw a small pad of paper. His hands, he was surprised to see, were shaking. He patted his chest, searching for the telltale outline of a pen… when he suddenly realized that the impact of the words wasn't fading.\n\nThe realization that they wouldn't fade, that he quite literally could not forget them, struck like a bolt from the invisible blue.\n\nHe nodded, though the other man's wild eyes were now shut tight again, and stood up straight. \"Very well.\" A glance to the medic. \"Keep him stable; we're going to be down here a while.\"\n\n\"How long, sir?\" Strauss was still pointing his rifle at the wheezing casualty, as were both security details. \"How long are we going to stay?\"\n\nScout glanced up at the cave ceiling, then at the narrow aperture from which the hose emerged, then at the dozens of winding paths branching off in every direction. There couldn't be a metre of stone between each; a little world of possibilities, all his own.\n\n\"Quite some time yet,\" he mused.\n\n[[=image NewBTS.jpg]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=true | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/ | previous-title=On the Same Page\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/1-remember-remember | next-title=Remember, Remember\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/bury-the-survivors-hub | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Bury the Survivors\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 43Asterisk.png, NewBTS.jpg, Scout.jpg, TBGO.png, Underture.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
