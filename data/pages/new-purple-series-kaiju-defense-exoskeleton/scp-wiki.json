Unfortunately, there are currently no large scale solutions yet, however we are attempting to alleviate this issue by designing a suit able to defend you and your family against Kaiju and other beasts!\n\nThis suit was specially made out of the corpse of a Large Scale Aggressor, and so is ready to enable you to defeat other such creatures!\n\nWe know people may be hesitant to wear one of these suits, after the last [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/grant-request-for-mechacrocosquid accident] but we guarantee this product to be almost 100 percent safe![[footnote]] Not been fully tested yet.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"speech speech--reverse\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:ar/finn_sunglasses_right.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"speech-bubble\"]]\n+++ Features!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThe following is a list of features this product has that are able to protect you!\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ Strong Armour\n\nThe plating on this suit has been enhanced with a specifically crafted mineral, complimenting the already almost impenetrable skin of the Kaiju. Now you won't have to worry when you get a tough scratch or burn, as your suit will be able to handle it all!.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ Main Hand Cannon\n\nNow a suite of armour would be pointless if it didn't have any defense! Luckily for you we have installed a wide array of weapons, most notably a large hand cannon!\n\nThis cannon is capable of firing a large thaumaturgical shot and can be charged depending on how much power is required for the situation.[[footnote]] Use of a fully charged shot may drain the battery much quicker than usual, so users should avoid firing excessive shots unless if in a life-threatening situation. [[/footnote]] These shots are usually capable of piercing through the skin of a smaller LSA, but are still a powerful tool when protecting you against larger ones!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ Electronic Interface\n\nAs well as being useful, this exoskeleton is also practical! Here you can manage all aspects of your suit such as battery, weapons, vitals and much much more! Not only is it sleek and easily accessible, it is also customisable. Want to turn your suit a deep red? Or how about a stylish pink? You can do anything you set your mind to with this.[[footnote]] Extended exposure to the screen may be harmful to your body, remember to take breaks when not in use. [[/footnote]]\n\nAlong with this, you can fire a special laser out of your eye with the touch of a button. Damaging your opponent harshly and keeping you safe!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ Kaiju Tracking\n\nSometimes you just need that ease of mind of not having to be worried about being mauled to death by a giant ocean squid. Well with this feature, it sends out a signal locating the nearest Kaiju to you and their approximate location! [[footnote]]In the event your tracker starts to malfunction or not work, please contact your distributor and request a technician. [[/footnote]]\n\nNow you'll truly be able to enjoy your life and have peace of mind! [[footnote]] The tracker may not always be accurate and may have faults from time to time. [[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+ Last Defense\n\nAre you ever in a tricky situation, facing down a beast three times your size? Don't worry, we've came up with a solution!\n\nYou can access it through your electronic interface, in a specialised section. After confirming your choice, a large sword will be able to be used, fully charged by the suit. This will easily cut through and kill most of your smaller to mid tier Kaiju, however extended use may damage the suit and so must only be used as a last resort.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"speech speech--reverse\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:ar/finn_shock_left.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"speech-bubble speech-bubble--long\"]]\n+++ Installation!\n\nRead Carefully!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nIn order to get one of these suits, you'll first need to go to our website and book an appointment. We will then proceed to gain the materials required from our associates at Marshall, Carter and Dark, and start to assemble the suit. Then 1-3 days later, just hop into one of our in person locations and you'll be quickly fitted on with the suit!\n\nToo scared of going outside because of giant beasts? Well there's no need to worry as alternatively, in select locations you may be able to get an at home appointment.[[footnote]] Please note that we will no longer be delivering to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest## Gorična] due to concerns over the authorities unlawfully using it. For a full list of places able to be delivered, please check [# this link].[[/footnote]] A specialist will then arrive to your door in a few days with a suit and help you fit it on!\n\nScared? Don't worry, this product is painlessly and easily fitted on and you won't even have to worry about it going rogue and taking over the world![[footnote]] Anderson Robotics does not claim legal responsibility in case the Kaiju goes rogue and takes over the world. User discretion is advised.[[/footnote]]\n\nAfter the suit is fitted on, you'll also get an at home charging station! If necessary you can buy extra charging stations at one of our clinics.\n\n\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:ar/finn_sunglasses_left.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"speech-bubble\"]]\n+++ Proper Usage!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nAfter getting it fit on, you should first get used to your suit. Walk around and practice fighting with the exoskeleton, we even have training facilities in select locations! I'll even help guide you through the interface. When you get used to it, start practising fighting against small creatures, and with any luck you'll soon start being a natural! Despite this, we recommend you still be safe when out and about.\n\nYou should be ready to go in around 1-2 weeks! After this you'll be free to use this suit to its fullest, fighting off potential enemies. Make sure to charge it regularly too, you wouldn't want it deactivating in the middle of battle. We are currently working on portable charging stations in order to try alleviate this issue so subscribe to our newsletter for updates about that!\n\nIf your suit starts to malfunction or experience glitches, contact a specialist immediately.\n\n\n[[div class=\"speech speech--reverse\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:ar/finn_threat_left.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"speech-bubble speech-bubble--long\"]]\n+++ Warnings!\n\nThe following list is a list of prohibitions once your Purple Series Kaiju Defense Exoskeleton is in working order. Please read and follow this list carefully.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ Do not attempt to fight a Large Scale Aggressor too powerful for you.\n\nUnfortunately our suit does have some limitations, as it only works for smaller Kaiju. Do not attempt to attack large beasts, as this will end badly for you instead follow proper evacuation protocols and get somewhere safe. Only engage in combat with Kaiju if you are confident you will succeed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ Do not overexert the suit.\n\nThe suit may start to falter and glitch when used for a long period of time, resulting in possible major problems. Due to this, it is important to regularly charge the suit and let it rest for at least 10 hours once a month.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ Do not attempt to use the suit for fighting against non-kaiju.\n\nThis suit is to only be used for defense against Kaiju and other similar creatures. While we have implemented measures to try stop this, for example the gun turning off when pointed at a human, it may not be fully accurate and thus we recommend you not to attack other beings.\n\nPlease check out our other products if you wish to kill humans.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ Do not listen to the voices.\nOccasionally, there may be a voice coming from the suit, usually saying gibberish. These voices are to be considered normal, and are to be ignored. If the voices increase or stop being gibberish, please contact a technician immediately.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"speech\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:ar/finn_friendly_left.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"speech-bubble speech-bubble--long\"]]\n+++ Final Words!\n\nWith all this in mind, please enjoy your product, and your protection!
