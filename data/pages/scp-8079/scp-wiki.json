Upon stabbing the artifact with a sword, every Scranton Reality Anchor in the Keter wing of the site experienced a fatal software error and ceased functioning, allowing several anomalies[[footnote]]All of them of low Risk or Disruption classification.[[/footnote]] to escape their containment cells.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\nThe individual, who appeared to be an adult woman in a black dress and royal garb, ran outside the cell and started casting protective wards on several Keter cells, which seems to have prevented the most violent anomalies to breach containment. After this, the woman seemed to command the anomalies who already breached containment to follow her, before opening a portal to an unknown, possibly extradimensional, location. A total of 79 anomalies, including SCP-███ and SCP-████, are considered lost.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\nUpon examination of the artifact left behind, it was identified as a missing prototype Scranton Reality Anchor, which disappeared five years ago. The following files were retrieved from the automated logging system of the SRA and are currently under study to determine the true nature of the incident.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"greetings.md\" hide=\"Displaying file 'greetings.md'\"]]\n\n//To those who call themselves Foundation,//\n\n//While I believe you have good intentions, sometimes imposing your will upon the wrong reality has consequences.//\n\n//We will discuss this when you are ready to accept that we are free.

Neutralization of this threat is a **Class-Keter** priority.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Abomination #:** 8079\n\n**Threat Classification:** Keter (//Subclassification:// Níðhöggr[[footnote]] Níðhöggr-class objects are those that, due to their inherent nature, represent a [[[SCP-5000|complete change in the Council's objectives]]] or tenets.[[/footnote]]).\n\n**Object Classification:** Unknown, possibly a Tashkent-class Abomination\n\n**Subjugation Counter-incantation Procedure:** Every nightfall, a Class IV Warlock, Sorcerer or Cleric is to perform a summoning, conjuring or any similar incantation inside Abomination 8079’s chamber. This will make Abomination 8079’s focus on the caster, and thus reduce the rate of expansion of its effects. Besides this procedure, no creature or artifact capable of manipulating magic is to enter the area of effect of Abomination 8079, as it will disrupt its ability to cast, transfer or manipulate mana, sometimes permanently.\n\nThe Omniscient Council and all loyal allies are to identify deviant ideas of “normalcy” or attempts to classify magic, divinity or related concepts as Abominations, and incarcerate the associated parties. Words such as “overseer”, “foundation” and “containment” without appropriate context are to be declared taboo and any Warlock or Sorcerer denouncing magic over these concepts is to be immediately incarcerated in isolation until any influence of Abomination 8079 subsides.\n\nNo members of the Omniscient Council besides the Third Omniscient are to interact with Abomination 8079 directly or be exposed to it.\n\n**Threat Description:** The artifact is a mechanism of unknown nature, which appears to be constructed in a similar way to the Sacred Treasures of the Followers of MEKHANE, the Unbroken Goddess, albeit lacking the ritualistic runes often associated with the Goddess. The object is not capable of independent movement nor of taking action by itself; however, its presence itself disrupts the ability of users of magic to perform their Acts. Warlocks claim to have their mana drained by the Abomination, while users of Faith Acts claim to be unable to commune with the Gods in its presence. Other forms of magic, summoning, alchemical transformation, pacting with daemons or incantations are similarly affected.\n\nFurthermore, observation of the Abomination’s physical form can alter the convictions and beliefs of the affected person. Often, those under the influence of the artifact claim that the usage of magic in all its forms is unnatural or abhorrent, and that the existence of magic itself and its effects on our world are to be hidden or obscured, and start to initiate plans to “contain” artifacts related to magic or faith conduits.\n\nWhile the artifact seems to be mechanical, its inner workings appear to be a combination of the Treasures of MEKHANE with several contraptions made of [[[SCP-4231|flesh and bone]]], akin to those used by the devouts of Nälkä. The Abomination appears to be a result of this interaction of incompatible magical substances and rituals, as described in the Codex of Tashkent. Externally, the machine bears a sigil of unknown origin, similar in appearance to a very simple magic circle, with three arrows pointing inwards.\n\nAfter realizing the inherent danger of the Abomination, the Omniscient Council has decided to confine it to a special chamber to isolate it from any user of magic that could be affected. However, the Omniscients soon realized that, when left unattempted, the machine would affect magic in a much greater radius, targeting Warlocks located at increasingly larger distances. Attempts to damage the artifact or interrupt its functions so far have failed; however, constant usage of magic in its vicinity appears to put a strain on the mechanism inside, reducing the machine’s capability of stopping the flow of mana.\n\nThe artifact is currently under study by the Omniscient Council to determine its purpose, function or reason to exist.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"examination_231.wav\" hide=\"Automatic transcription of file 'examination_231.wav'...\"]]\n\n//The Third Omniscient enters the chamber, alone.

If not possible, such anomalies should be contained as far as possible from SCP-8079's containment chamber; redundant containment procedures not relying on reality stabilization are to be developed.\n\nNo anomalous object or entity is to be allowed to interact with SCP-8079, including any Foundation personnel who has been registered as part of the Integration Protocol.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8079 was a prototype Class-IX Adaptive Scranton Reality Anchor, designed to adjust to any environment that would be hostile to the functioning of a standard SRA automatically. Based on serial number information, SCP-8079 was lost in May 2019 during a containment breach of [[[SCP-682]]] and presumed destroyed. Analysis of recovered logs after Incident 8079-1 suggests that, instead, SCP-8079 was transported to a different reality where the analogues of normalcy-preserving organizations did not upheld secrecy of the anomalous as one of their main tenets.\n\nIt is believed that SCP-8079 attempted to [[[SCP-6500|execute its primary function]]] after detecting large discrepancies between expected parameters and its observations. This, in practice, amounted to a localized CK-Class Restructuring Scenario, with the area affected gradually increasing in size due to its adaptive properties; in turn, this prompted several destruction attempts by the inhabitants of said reality, leading to its eventual destruction by an unknown individual (PoI-8079) during Incident 8079-1.\n\nSCP-8079 is irreparably damaged to an extent where it is no longer capable of performing its main function. Furthermore, its effects now appear to be [[[SCP-3005|reversed]]], as it disrupts the normal functioning of all reality stabilization artifacts in its vicinity; in particular, any kind of SRA brought within its containment chamber has violently exploded after an average of 31 minutes. As well, thaumaturgical and ritualistic performances in its vicinity are enhanced to a varying degree, with even non-Type Blue personnel being able to cast basic spells when in close proximity to the object. It is unknown if these properties are of SCP-8079 itself or of the sword used for its destruction.\n\nAttempts to contact the inhabitants of the aforementioned alternate reality for diplomatic, reparation, study and containment reasons have failed; it is believed that contact is actively being disrupted from their side.\n\nDNA samples obtained from SCP-8079 (believed to belong to PoI-8079) have been inconsistent, with matches to at least 27 different [[[SCP-3480|Olympia-class]]] unidentified women. However, all samples obtained so far are partial matches to Foundation Site Director Dr.  Charles Gears. The implications of this are unknown.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\" \" hide=\"Thanks, Hekate.\"]]\n//Someday, we will be ready.//\n**-Allison Chao, O5-3**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8078]]] | SCP-8079 | [[[SCP-8080]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
