Only separate them when required for testing. Instructions for administering the modified Zener cards can be found in //Document 7075-A//, which will be given to assigned personnel. Approve any requests for intelligence-based items (board games, books of riddles, etc.) which may aid in testing. Likewise, deny any requests which may hinder.\n\n**Containment Update:** Increase the rate of testing to four times a week with a focus on enhancing emotive and superconscious abilities. Subjects possess suicidal and homicidal ideation, but both state that their desires are manageable. Believe them until proven otherwise.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7075 was an unknown individual who was subject to an occult ritual. This ritual was meant to transform it into a gestalt entity of great psychic influence, but instead split it into two sapient humanoids, designated SCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B.\n\nThese two humanoids share a very potent psychological bond. Either one is able to instantly (and often involuntarily) transmit sensory information, ideas, and associations to the other with a ~0.009% accuracy[[footnote]]With typical levels of mental activity, this equates to around 5,500 conscious and subconscious thoughts per day.[[/footnote]]. Therefore, by all known metrics, SCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B possess the most powerful telepathic connection ever recorded by the SCP Foundation. Research has shown that their telepathy has some conscious component which can be strengthened through mental exercises and tests of will. Researchers are encouraged to speak to their supervisors regarding the specifics.\n\nSCP-7075-A is a 1.80-meter-tall male. It is thin, malnourished, and weak; having performed poorly during every one of its medical evaluations. It has paranoid tendencies and can sometimes fall into uncooperative or even hostile moods during testing, but it has yet to attack a researcher. A common delusion it suffers from is that SCP-7075-B or its caretakers are trying to harm it in some way. To ease this, researchers are encouraged to act more casually with SCP-7075-A than they usually would with SCPs.\n\nSCP-7075-A has extensive scarring across its face and torso, which is indicative of ritual scarification. SCP-7075-A will occasionally have episodes where it bleeds from these scars for anywhere from five minutes to two-and-a-half hours. When asked why this happens, SCP-7075-A has stated that it \"does not know and does not care.\" Examination has shown that this bleeding is visual only; it does not suffer any real harm during its episodes.\n\nSCP-7075-B is a 1.54-meter-tall female. It appears to be far larger and heavier than SCP-7075-A and its limbs are particularly bloated compared to the rest of its body, lacking coloration in certain spots and sagging at the joints. Little is known about SCP-7075-B's personality since it has refused to speak to many researchers. However, it has shown a liking towards a very select few, the names of whom are included in //Document 7075-A//. It has sometimes spoken to SCP-7075-A when it believes they are not being listened to.\n\nSCP-7075-A and SCP-7075-B are fraternal twins.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ASSORTED EXPERIMENT/INTERVIEW LOGS 02/09/████ - 19/10/████\" hide=\"- ASSORTED EXPERIMENT/INTERVIEW LOGS 02/09/████ - 19/10/████\"]]\n> __**INTERVIEW LOG**__\n> \n> **INTERVIEWER:** Senior Researcher ██████\n> \n> **INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-7075-A\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Could you describe what you see when you get a transmission?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Um... I don't see much. They go by so fast that I'm only able to catch a few words most of the time. Sometimes I think I get a smell? I get these bits and pieces that are all blended together into this... soup in my head. It's like if there was a tiger on the other side of the room growling really, really, really low. Sometimes it comes closer and sometimes it goes away, but it's always there.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** But it was different in the deprivation tank.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Oh, yeah. Jesus fucking Christ, what do you guys do to those things? I thought of doing something like that a while ago with a t-shirt and this kiddie pool, but I got really fuckin' scared at the last second and freaked out. I felt the same here, but everything was a lot more calm. I couldn't feel my face, it was fucking incredible.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** You remember what you saw?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** A little bit, yeah. When it started, I was like upside down and I was floating and looking down at this black ocean. My eyes were messed up. Like, I knew for some reason that I wasn't looking at the ocean, I was looking at a really big sphere of water, like a floating mass kind of thing. But I saw--I saw a circle. It was this flat circle like a flag, and it made me really scared. I tried to look somewhere else, but I couldn't move my head. My whole body felt limp. And I felt this really loud, distorted roar in my right ear. It was like a lion was screaming through a sp... No, it wasn't an animal scream. It was like... I don't know, something more primal.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Something more primal than an animal? \n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I don't know, man, it was really fucked.

RESEARCHER ██████:** So you don't have the best relationship with your sister. That's a very normal experience for kids your age.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I don't hate her or anything. She's really like... I don't want to say a rude word.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** You're allowed to call her a bitch if that is how you really feel.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Um... yeah. Yeah, I guess she is. She thinks she's better than everyone else.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** What makes you say that?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** The way she acts. The way that she thinks. She eats a lot of my food and she's mean to people and she's a really big weight on everything. She used to be nice when we were first created, but now every day is a slog. I hate talking to her. I don't like feeling like that because we're connected, but I do. I'm sorry.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** You don't have to apologize, David. That's a perfectly normal reaction to have, especially cooped up in a place like this twenty-four hours a day.\n\n> __**INTERVIEW LOG**__\n> \n> **INTERVIEWER:** Senior Researcher ██████\n> \n> **INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-7075-A\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I had another dream last night. Could I talk about that?\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** If you want to, sure.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Thanks. Um... I think it was the same thing as last time with me on the floor in the kitchen. This time I wasn't looking through my eyes though, I was looking through my mom's. I was saying all the same shit, but now I could feel what she was feeling--what I think she was feeling when I was saying it.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** What was she thinking?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** She wasn't um... she wasn't really thinking anything at all. I couldn't catch any words or anything, but I knew that she was feeling blue. She was the most blue I'd ever seen. It wasn't like an ocean blue or an aquarium blue, it was a lot more intense. It made me wanna puke. It was so... burning in my eyes and my stomach.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Maybe it was something medical. You said she had seizures sometimes, didn't you? That could be how she was feeling when it came on.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** No, no man! It wasn't anything like that.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Alright, sorry -- I'm sorry. What did it feel like?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** It was so... sad and cold and lonely. I felt the blue everywhere around me, no matter how much I shut my eyes. My eyelids weren't even black anymore. The longer that I looked at me on the floor the more I wanted to collapse. I wanted to die. I didn't wanna be there anymore. I felt so disappointed in myself and, like, pissed at the world for fucking doing this to me. I had no fucking clue why I of all people was chosen to suffer through this. It was terrifying, it was terrifying.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** And, um... I felt really bad when I woke up. I stopped drinking a while ago 'cause of some other shit with one of my friends, but if I could've felt that, I would've stopped earlier. I fucking hate it so much. It fucking disgusts me, man.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** What happened with your fr-\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Could you take me back to my room please? I'm fucked up right now.

Request was approved.\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Before we get into this, can I ask why you want to be interviewed all of a sudden? Is there something that happened recently?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** No.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Okay. Do you have a request you'd like to make? Something for your room?\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** I see. Um, okay, I guess I'm choosing to do it now. I don't give a shit anymore. If you need to kill me to do it, I'd like to be drowned or shot in the head. Maybe poisoned, but however you wanna do it is fine. I don't know how David wants to do it, but he feels the same way. Just do it before I change my mind.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Excuse me?\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** I'm sorry. I didn't expect that in all honesty. //(Laughs.)// Are you... Do you think you're depressed? If you are, we have some things that could help you. Everybody in here can get a little crazy sometimes, heh.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** What? You don't have to talk like that. I said I don't give a shit. You can... fuckin' kill me already.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** So, I understand how you're feeling right now and I want you to know that it's a very normal thing for people like you, but suicide is never a rational response -- not in //any// circumstance, okay?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** You're such a... cruel piece of shit. I know what you want. I can see his thoughts, dumbass. I know what the fuck you're trying to tell me. I don't care. I'm not gonna run or try and kill one of you or take your guns. I don't give a shit. I don't have any more reasons to stay alive.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Oh, come on. You know that's not why you two are here. And you have plenty of reasons to live. You still have your brother, don't you? You're just as powerful a telepath as he is. Without you he's useless, he's just another guy walking down the street. Your existence alone makes him one of the most important people in history. You two shatter every rule of science, every rule of psychology, metaphysics -- you shatter everything every day!

I thought that would stop them from questioning me, but one day I was working and this guy came in who I was friends with years ago.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** //(Unintelligible)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** I don't think he really existed. It's my brain's way of talking to me. He like, called me over and asked to talk privately and asked me what I was doing that night and I kinda started to cry.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I don't know why you'd feel guilty over all of that. Just don't talk. They have nothing to use against you.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** I don't know. I felt awful 'cause they fuckin' got him. They fucking got //him//. The last time I saw him I felt like I understood him and now I couldn't tell at all what he was. I thought he'd try to relate to me or coax it out of me or have a heart-to-heart but he fucking slapped me with it. I don't know what I did wrong to him.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** You didn't do anything. Guys are just like that sometimes.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Am I a bad person?\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I think everyone's a bad person.\n\n> __**INTERVIEW LOG**__\n> \n> **ADMINISTRATOR:** Senior Researcher ██████\n> \n> **SUBJECT(S):** SCP-7075-B\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Hell fuckin' yes you do. Do you know how incredible it is that you and your brother are alive? Your existence alone disproves half of science. Your existence disproves almost every single philosophical theory developed in the last 300 years. I-I mean do you even understand how fucking unbelievably rude what you just said was?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Shut up bitch.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Do you even know who Carl Jung is? Do you know what the collective--\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Shut up fucking slut--\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** unconscious is? It is the foundation for the entire field of psychology. It is the lynchpin, it is the only fuckin' thing keeping it together and you and your brother proved that it exists. Not as some sociological thing or useful idea, but a real, tangible, physical thing you can interact with. You can touch it. You can beat the shit out of it if you want. Does that not make you happy? Does the knowledge that you are actually the center of the universe not enough for you because you get bored sometimes?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** You're a fucking whore pig hillbilly skimp whore. You're so fucking useless compared to me, you should kill yourself.\n> \n> //(A short screeching sound.)//\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** Alright. I'm done here. Go back to your cell.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** I don't wanna.\n> \n> **SR. RESEARCHER ██████:** I don't care.\n\n> __**EXPERIMENT LOG**__\n> \n> **INTERVIEWER:** N/A\n> \n> **INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-7075-A \n> \n> **FOREWORD:** Senior Researcher ██████ was unavailable. In his place, an automated interviewer conducted the experiment.\n> \n> ----\n> \n> //(Machine presents a sheet of paper which contains the words 'Lunwi Gibbins' written eighty-nine times in #2 pencil.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I don't know. Paper and something. \n> \n> //(Machine presents a sheet of printer paper which contains two numbers: the approximate number of natural births occurring at that moment and the approximate number of natural deaths occurring at the same time per SCP Foundation data collected that week.)//\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Man don't show me that shit.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **Machine:** Please give an answer, even if you are not sure.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** It's nothing.\n> \n> //(Machine presents a photograph of the Earth taken from the moon's surface.)//\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n\n> __**AUDIO LOG**__\n> \n> **INTERVIEWER:** SCP-7075-A\n> \n> **INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-7075-B\n> \n> ----\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Why are you so pissed off?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** It's not about you.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Yeah it is.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** How do you know?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Because it's always about me.\n> \n> //(Silence. SCP-7075-A begins to cry.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I hate the things you make me think about. I wanna be good; I really wanna be a good person. I don't wanna be like my dad. I'm so fucking lucky to have this gift, you can't even fucking imagine. I wanna help so many fucking people. I don't care if I never get a girlfriend or a private life or anything, I don't fucking care, I just want to make sure that the kids who don't have a fucking thing don't get fucked. I'm so scared they're gonna die, but I can't do shit because I'm stuck with you. Fucking //you//. You and your stupid fucking whining and you trying to be the victim here. We're both fucking victims. We're in the same boat. We're stuck in the same fucking circle and yeah, I know the guy is gonna fuck me but he's in a circle too and he's just trying to do his best. He's got a boss, his boss has got a boss, that boss has got a boss. They're fucking each other all the way down and I got a chance to ignore that shit and just be a fucking -- a good guy! So I don't fucking care.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** We're not in the same boat.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** You're such a bitch.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** No, I'm not.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Why can't you just help me?\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** 'Cause it's not the right thing to do.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** Yes it is.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** No it's not.\n> \n> **SCP-7075-A:** I don't fuckin' care.\n> \n> //(Silence.)//\n> \n> **SCP-7075-B:** Well, I don't either.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
