To prevent the spread of pathogens into or out of SCP-8154, there is to be minimal contact between the air inside and outside of SCP-8154. Under no circumstances may any living biological material pass through the airlock, and anything that passes through it is to undergo sterilization.\n\nFurthermore, any member of staff entering the site must have been medically cleared to do so, and anyone leaving is to be quarantined for 1 week. If symptoms of disease are exhibited, quarantine is to be prolonged until 1 week has passed without symptoms.\n\n\nDue to its scale, and its as of yet unknown extent beneath the internal water surface, exploration of SCP-8154 is currently underway to determine where mining and deep drilling by private actors must be prevented to maintain containment. To allow for exploration of the interior with minimal biological contamination, an ROV dubbed 'Pikaia' has been developed for use within SCP-8154.\n\n------\n\n+ **Description:**\nSCP-8154 is a vast cave located beneath British Columbia, Canada, at a depth of approximately 1000 meters below sea level. Laser measurements indicate that it spans approximately 4% of the province in a roughly rectangular shape, with a natural entrance previously blocked by slate located in the south-western corner. SCP-8154 is approximately 90% flooded with saltwater, and has internal radiative and atmospheric conditions similar to those thought to have been present during the Cambrian period. This allows photosynthetic life to thrive inside the cave despite the complete lack of actual sunlight. The walls of SCP-8154 consist of a currently unidentified mineral with immense durability, and its morphology is inconsistent with all known cave-formation processes.\n\nThe radiative conditions cycle between light and dark over a constant 20.7 hour cycle, which is consistent with the length of diurnal[[footnote]] Day and night. [[/footnote]] cycles during the Cambrian period. Similarly to the Pacific coast of British Columbia, SCP-8154 has a mixed, semidiurnal tidal cycle[[footnote]] Denoting a tidal cycle with two high and two low tides with differing heights in a day.[[/footnote]], which is connected to its internal diurnal cycle rather than the actual position of the moon.\n\nThe most distinctive feature of SCP-8154 is its biota, which based on its species composition, is thought to have diverged from the rest of the world at some point during the middle to late Cambrian period. Currently, approximately 780 species have been catalogued within SCP-8154, as well as approximately 240 taxa previously unknown to science. A further 7000 species have been identified, but have not yet been catalogued. These species are spread across four distinct zones, classified as SCP-8154-A, SCP-8154-B, SCP-8154-C, and SCP-8154-D.\n\n++ **Discovery:**\nSCP-8154 was incidentally discovered on 2023-04-12 during the seizure of a private copper mine following the discovery of a namtarium[[footnote]] An anomalous substance known for its genotoxic properties. Named after Namtar, the minor Mesopotamian god of disease.[[/footnote]] deposit. During the process of securing the site, the outer walls of SCP-8154 were discovered.\n\n++ **SCP-8154-A:**\nLocated closest to the entrance, between 5 and 60 meters below internal water level, SCP-8154-A is a reef dominated by archaeocyaths[[footnote]] A clade of reef-building, Cambrian sponges.

I presume you remember the sickly trilobite we saw back in November last year; whatever it is has started affecting other organisms as well. In the past couple of months, we have observed similar symptoms in other arthropods, as well as molluscs and chordates.\n\nEven more concerning is the fact that the data from our latest inventories is showing biodiversity loss, 13 and 9% in SCP-8154-A and SCP-8154-B respectively measured in the Shannon index. I have attached a file with all the data below.\n\nI can not help but worry that we did this.

Director Stephen Woods was later found deceased in his office, cause of death was determined to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound, his hard drive was also found to have been wiped.\n\nAfter descending to the underground section of Outpost 815, MTF Sigma-5 encountered 3 individuals wearing standard-issue hazmat suits, in spite of the containment breach alarm having been cancelled. The individuals, who were identified as outpost security, were uncooperative, and were subsequently arrested.

The investigation also uncovered communications between Woods and a representative of an as of yet unidentified GoI regarding the sale of namtarium for the purpose of thaumaturgic gene editing.\n\n------\n\n++ Addendum 8154.7 - Decontamination Report\nFollowing the contamination of SCP-8154 with namtarium, decontamination specialists were consulted to devise a plan for the decontamination effort. Due to the extent of SCP-8154, filtering out all namtarium from the water was deemed infeasible. Decontamination instead consisted primarily of sealing all known entry points for the namtarium residue from the adjacent mine, and activated carbon filters were placed in locations particularly affected by the pollution. Dispersion, along with chemical reactions with the water, are estimated to reduce the concentration of namtarium to safe levels within 3-4 weeks.\n\nDespite these efforts, much damage has already been done, and more is expected. As a result of the pollution inflicted by the namtarium mining, SCP-8154 has been subject to a mass-extinction event estimated to have exterminated approximately 60% of its endemic species. The final toll and future ramifications remain unknown.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** glasssponge.png\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\nThis image is ia derivative of:\n> **Name:** Expl5642 (9737489484).jpg\n> **Author:** NOAA Photo Library\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/noaaphotolib/9737489484\n> **Notes:** Image was edited to remove a squat lobster and two crinoids.\n\n> **Filename:** ROVcontrolroom.jpg\n> **License:** Public Domain\n\nThis image is ia derivative of:\n> **Name:** JAMSTEC Kairei control room.jpg\n> **Author:** nattou\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:JAMSTEC_Kairei_control_room.jpg\n> **Notes:** Image was edited to remove a crab and footage from the deck of a ship.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8153]]] | SCP-8154 | [[[SCP-8155]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
