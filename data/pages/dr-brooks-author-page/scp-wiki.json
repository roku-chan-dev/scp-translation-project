I can't exist, can't live, without putting something out into the world. The SCP wiki is only one of the ways I do this, writing only one of the forms I use, so as little as you see on this page, know that this is only a fraction of my power.\n\n++ You\n\nI hope you enjoy these random creations of mine.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab SCPs]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-custom-list= --]\n|background-image=\n|language=\n|order=\n|perpage=\n|shadow=\n|category= SCPs\n|tags= +scp\n]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tales]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-custom-list= --]\n|background-image=\n|language=\n|order=\n|perpage=\n|shadow=\n|category= Tales\n|tags= +tale\n]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Art]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-custom-list= --]\n|background-image=\n|language=\n|order=\n|perpage=\n|shadow=\n|category= Art\n|tags= +artwork\n]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Achievements]]\n\nBecause why not.

It was going to be a -J article, but I thought it would make more sense if it was the -J version of an already existing collapsible-focused SCP, and that is how this was born. The decently good reception was entirely unexpected. People simped over my SCP, displayed murderous tendencies towards it, cried over it, made fan art, fanfiction, memes. My favourite part of being a creator is being able to reach people, and this SCP reached a lot.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]",
