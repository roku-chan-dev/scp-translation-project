Penguins designed by Ambrose Restauranteurs to be excellent at customer service and genuinely enjoy it. They grow depressed when we don't let them regularly wait tables, so we have them serving lunch daily in the cafeteria. We're also trying to expand their repertoire a bit, as you can see, I've been having some luck teaching them how to dance.\n\n**Lague:** Well that sounds just excellent, exactly the sort of stories I love to hear.

You might be better off asking Dr. Hanneman about that.\n\n**Lague:** Why's that, aren't you the Research Head?\n\n**Hadhar:** Well sure, but I was placed here by the Salvation Initiative. You should probably ask Dr. Hanneman. He'll probably say yes, this was his idea after all, I was only dragged into it kicking and screaming.\n\n**Lague:** Well you aren't kicking and screaming anymore. I saw you in there, looked like you were pretty into it honestly. As for the S.I.? Forget it! Even with programs like that the Foundation wouldn't just assign people willy-nilly, neither would Dir.

This seems like a logical conclusion of the program to me. You take in the cooperative anomalies, well, mostly cooperative, that you feel comfortable letting off the leash, you let them do what they do best, teach them a thing or two, and then boom, send them out into the world.
