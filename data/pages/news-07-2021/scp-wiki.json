Walrus posted to the /x/ board of 4chan. This post featured a fictitious database entry that provided an item number, containment procedures, and a description for an anomalous statue that would kill people when it became unwatched. The user who made this post is better known for their later alias of “Moto42” with this post being known as “[[[SCP-173]]]”. Despite misspellings and criticisms surrounding its similarity to the Weeping Angels from the television series “Doctor Who”, SCP-173 quickly circulated as a creepypasta.\n\nOn January 19th of 2008, an anonymous user created the SCP Wiki on the EditThis wiki farm. This action helped spark the beginning of an actual community based on the universe created by the SCP-173 post. There had been other creations inspired by SCP-173 and there was now a place where these fictitious documents could be stored and new ones could steadily be created. Despite rapid growth, however, the community itself was still small, disconnected, and was quickly seeing the limitations of the dying wiki farm that was EditThis.\n\nOn July 19th of 2008, FritzWillie, a member of the EditThis SCP Wiki, created a new SCP Wiki over on the Wikidot wiki farm. There were repeated issues on the EditThis platform and the anonymous administrator who created the SCP Wiki on EditThis left early on. This left no one in power to fix issues and the community was leaderless. FritzWillie created an account named “The Administrator” and used that account to create the SCP Wiki on Wikidot. Wikidot opened up a multitude of possibilities to the SCP project. Specifically, it allowed better moderation, general stability, and the opportunity to form a much more cohesive community. Six days later, on July 25th, FritzWillie opened up the new site to the community and as they say, the rest is history.[[footnote]] Check out cooldude's [[[the-scp-foundation-on-4chan-and-editthis|essay]]] to learn more and experience a more detailed version of the events of our early history. [[/footnote]]\n\nMoto42 thought his creation would be an afterthought, something people might find interesting, but would forget about rather quickly. SCP-173 was simple. It was just a short little document about something strange that required a particular set of procedures to keep it in check. It also featured a brief description that described surface-level info, just enough to get the point across. So, what led people to find it so interesting? Why did it spark such interest among such a wide variety of people from around the world?\n\nWell, if I could fully answer that, then I wouldn’t be a volunteer writing an editorial on a fanfic website. I would instead be getting paid to intrigue minds and stir interest in people! But that aside, I think the root of this does not have to do so much with the particular containment procedures or the description of a weird killing machine. In the moment, you can read the containment procedures and be intrigued by the particular set of circumstances needed to keep this thing at bay. In the moment, you can read the description and be fascinated to learn about an anomaly with such a strange set of capabilities despite its appearance. However, if that was all that was there, then Moto42 would have very likely been correct in that his post would be an afterthought.\n\nThank the heavens that the procedures and the description were not the only things included in Moto42’s post. The root has to do with the first line of the post: “{{Item#: SCP-173}}”. After reading and being intrigued by the mentioned sections, the readers of his post naturally thought to themselves, “//Wow, this is interesting, **I wonder what the other SCPs are…**//” With imagination comes creation and in the absence of something desired comes the need for something to fulfill that desire. At the end of the day, the SCP project relies on the imagination of collaborators across the world to fulfill that desire of wanting to know what else makes up the world where something like SCP-173 is just another number in a database. And so, the next time you read an SCP article, spend some time to appreciate the inclusion of that simple little item number. Who knows how things would have turned out otherwise. It has been 13 years since FritzWillie moved us to Wikidot and gave the SCP Wiki community the chance to flourish. It has been a long ride, but I’m confident it isn’t going to stop anytime soon. Happy 13th anniversary, SCP!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ SCP News\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"gallery-frame\"]]\n[[image 13th_Anniversary.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"placard\"]]Artwork by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sunny-s-black-and-white-art SunnyClockwork][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Site News\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ 13th Anniversary of The Wiki on Wikidot\n[[/=]]\n\n13 years ago on July 25th, the SCP Foundation Wiki made its move from EditThis to Wikidot, marking an incredibly influential change in the way people would now view and interact with the stories of the Foundation's world. To celebrate this momentous occasion, WhiteGuard went out to interview four of the most prominent users of that era, who were key to helping shape the site we know and love today - [[[interviewing-icons-the-administrator-fritzwillie|The Administrator]]], [[[interviewing-icons-drclef|DrClef]]], [[[interviewing-icons-kain-pathos-crow|Kain Pathos Crow]]], and [[[interviewing-icons-dr-gears|Dr Gears]]].\n\n[[=]]\n+++++ Posting Period for SCPDeclassified's MemeCon\n[[/=]]\n\nThe writing period was back during June, admittedly, but July was the month where [https://www.reddit.com/r/SCPDeclassified/ SCPD]'s [[[memecon-unofficial|MemeCon contest]]] opened its doors for all to post and vote on.

It ranges from Chaotic Evil (anything posted in an SCP slot is an SCP) to Lawful Good (Object Class, Special Containment Procedures, Description) and a lot of weird things in between[[footnote]]Object Class Optional[[/footnote]]. Everyone’s got an opinion on what constitutes an SCP, and I’m not here to say any of them are wrong.\n\nThat being said, everyone else is wrong. If they weren’t wrong, they would have a column on site news. And they don’t, which means they’re wrong. Except for my editor, who is kind and righteous and forgiving. I hope.\n\nOk, but a bit more seriously, I think the question of “what is an SCP” elides the more interesting question: “why do we write in this format?”. What do we gain by writing in the format that we don’t have in prose? And why do I think there are inherent differences between the SCP format and prose?\n\nWe’ll take a slight detour to talk about //Good Omens//. It’s my favourite book, and in large part due to the strength of Terry Pratchett’s narration. The descriptions are flavorful, funny, and an absolute delight. These same descriptions were carried into the (well cast!) live action adaptation, where they fall entirely flat. There’s one scene that sticks out to me - the narrator is describing how the Dukes of Hell are lurking in a cemetery. In the book it’s a bit of cute scene setting that’s silly and fun. In the show, the narrator is talking as the Dukes are just shown, statically standing in the middle of the frame. While this failure to translate narration into visual humor is a failure of the adaptation, I also think it helps illustrate that the visual medium fundamentally has different strengths than the written word. And while it’s a much less stark difference, I think the strengths and weaknesses between prose and the SCP format are pretty important.\n\n\nSo what do we gain from the SCP format, then? In my mind, it’s three big things. The first is that SCP articles are in-universe. They ostensibly exist in a database somewhere, which provides both motivation for their existence //and//, well, a universe. A universe with conflicting factions, ideals, people, technologies, whatever! This implies //layers// to a simple article - to get to this point where a researcher is reading this SCP, the thing had to be discovered, captured, written up, reviewed, uploaded, all that and more! There’s life in that premise - it’s not an omniscient narrator or a memoir, but written by a person with the expectation that it is unbiased as possible[[footnote]]And expectations are everything![[/footnote]]. That leads pretty cleanly into the second thing - SCPs are inherently a limited perspective. We can tell that the poop statue moves if no one is looking. We can probably figure out how fast it moves, if we really wanted. But we don’t know //why// it moves, why it poops or bleeds or really… anything. There’s this element of the unknown that pervades, and it’s great for creating atmosphere and mystery and intrigue.\n\nAnd that brings us to the third thing, which is actually something we //lose// - descriptions. Sometimes we’d love to go ham with overly purple prose and metaphors and stuff, but we can’t, because it’ll stick out like a sore thumb. And I think that’s good! Limitations breed creativity, and there are entire articles dedicated to dancing around describing things that work so much better than if we were told what was happening!\n\nMoreover, these three big things aren’t limitations! They give us a playground to muck around in: Questioning the trustworthiness of our article, or even the Foundation itself; poking fun at database organisation (I’m not a nerd, I swear); hiding horror in the spaces between innocuous interviews. I know that I can think of tons of articles that play with these three key points, and they all do it in interesting and unique ways.\n\nSo I’m gonna suggest something controversial here. I don’t think this is necessary for every article, and heck, sometimes it’s a detriment. But next time you go and write an article, think about what you gain or lose by putting it in the format. How does the format play with the story you’re trying to convey? Does it provide you with narrative or thematic tools? Is there something interesting you can do because it’s an SCP that you couldn’t do otherwise? Play around with it!\n\nMaybe you’ll write a cry for help, uploaded to a database that’s only supposed to contain research documents. Maybe someone is abusing their position as a researcher to invade their ex’s privacy! Maybe it’s a warning from an O5 to everyone, showing just what happened to the last person who dared oppose it. Don’t actually write any of these, because they’re all things that already exist, but hopefully you get the gist.\n\nSo I guess at the end of the day we come back to the same question we started with: “What is an SCP?”. And hopefully we can all agree now that whatever it is, it really needs to be more than anything posted in a numbered slot come on guys this is getting ridiculous I’m all for poststructuralism but like we have standards don\n\n//Editor’s Note: The rest of this article has been edited for clarity.//\n\n\n= [[span class=\"placard\"]]**Next month:** Riemann gives uncontroversial takes on Author Avatars[[/span]]\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=QWELLERY.jfif|caption=by [https://twitter.com/QWELLERY1 QWELLERY]|width=340px|align=left]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Captain's Log: Date 001\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//A Nice Kind of Harsh: A New Approach To Critique//[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\nThe phrase \"Harsh Critique\" has a lot of weight behind it on the site. To some people it represents nasty comments that shield themselves under the banner of \"constructive criticism\", and to others it is the aspiration of every critic that wishes to improve the writing on the site as a whole. I have been involved in hours and hours of debate over \"should we have harsher critique?\" and \"is harsh critique harmful?\" and ultimately, I've come away realizing that I just think that the term has referred to the same kinds of comments today as they did 10 or so years ago. So I would like to take this opportunity atop my soap box to propose a new way of looking at providing constructive criticism: \"honest critique\".\n\nInstead of describing the \"harshness\" of a piece of critique based off the venom of its language, or the ratio of positive to negative observations it makes, I think that there is something to be said for just considering how honest a critic really wishes to be with their feedback. On its face, everyone would imagine that \"dishonest feedback\" is inherently a bad thing. From this stance follows that \"all critique should be as honest as possible\", however I actually would like to oppose that notion.\n\nFor this, I would like to appeal to a quick anecdote from experiences I've had outside of the SCP Wiki. In an off-site writing group I attend a fairly large percentage of members read pieces that are passion projects. They might have far off aspirations of publishing, but that's not in the front of their minds when they read a chapter from their novel. These people, (not always, but a good chunk of the time) are looking less for hard-hitting critique of every fault I see, but rather validation. They want to know they've written something worth continuing. And this is where I come back to \"honest critique\".\n\nHonest critique is not about lying to the author. It is about being selective in what positives and negatives you wish to communicate. In context of giving \"honest critique\" a brutal reviewer would not be someone who calls a piece \"uninspired\" or \"a waste of my time\"[[footnote]] That's just being a dick [[/footnote]]. It's someone who points out every slip, every missed opportunity, every moment they did not feel entranced by the story. But a brutal reviewer would also be someone who acknowledges every laugh, every surprise, and every heartwarming moment. It is not a question of being nice in tone[[footnote]] Your tone can always be somewhat amicable, even when giving negative feedback[[/footnote]], it's a question of how much you filter.\n\nReturning to my example, during these writing groups I've learned that, for these people who want to know that they didn't waste their time writing the 3000-4000 words they've just read to me, I'm going to spend a lot more of my time focussing on the positives, listing the moments I enjoyed, even if in reality I was bored for 75% of the time. Because telling the author how bored I was isn't really going to help them in the end. I'm not going to lie and say I enjoyed every part of it, of maybe 3-4 major sticking points I might choose 1 or 2 to give a sentence of lip service, so the author can still have something to think about and improve on the next time around.\n\nOn the wiki, I will say I tend to be much more honest, but maybe I don't always need to be. Anyone who has gotten feedback from me can attest[[footnote]]Even for articles I ultimately enjoy[[/footnote]], I won't say anything positive during my critique session until the very end. When I comment on site, I spend most of my word count going over aspects I believe could use improvement (again, even on articles I like!). However, I don't think that is the best approach for every author. For some authors, the end goal shouldn't be to communicate to them constructive feedback, but rather demonstrate that one of their readers took the time to think critically about the piece, and use that demonstration to encourage them to just //keep writing//.\n\nI will admit, I'm stealing this point from The Great Hippo, but critique should not be crafted in a way that it discourages the author from trying again. There's no use in giving someone feedback if they're never going to implement it. And even if you're giving your feedback in the nicest language possible, if you don't balance the negative with the positive, then some authors will feel discouraged anyways.\n\nOf course, in every critic-author interaction there is some responsibility from the author's side to respond to critique intelligently, and who knows: I may even talk about it sometime. But for the sake of this piece, I just want people to stop talking about harsh critique. We got over \"being a dick in the comments is good, actually\" years ago. Instead, let's move the conversation forward, and hopefully the level of feedback on this site. Attempting to find the right balance of positive and negative feedback for each piece and each author can go a long way to encouraging someone to evolve their writing style. I think if people stopped thinking about critique as \"how mean should I be\" and rather \"how should I balance the positive and negative moments I experienced while reading this article\", we can finally stop worrying about if someone is being rude in the comments and instead spend time critically thinking and responding to each others thoughts in an engaging discussion.\n\nThat's right, I think... just maybe... we can have consistent, intelligent literary conversation on this poopy statue fanfiction site of ours.\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Rounder Table\n[[/div]]\nPrompts from your favorite house, thoughts from your favorite authors - all about the genre of SCP writing!\n@@ @@\n+++ //**Prompt:** What is the relevance of 'stingers' in SCPs?//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSCP articles are short fiction. We may slather articles in clinical tone, science fiction jargon, and shiny CSS formatting, but at the end of the day you’re writing a short fiction story; and nowhere is a stinger more important.\n\nWhen you have such a brief window to leave an impression on your reader, you need to end with impact. A stinger allows your story to live on past the moment its read, and allows the story to become personified by that impact. I couldn’t tell you who spoke during the audio logs, or even what the containment procedures were, but I know that 45% of Mt. Everest's mass is formed by corpses – because when I finished reading SCP-5140 (“Everest” by Rounderhouse), I sat back in my chair and said, aloud, “whoa”.\n\nThat’s not to say a good SCP, or any short fiction needs to have a sting to stand out. As with SCP-5031 (“Not Another Murder Monster” by Peppersghost), gradual subversion and strong writing can leave as much of an impact as any hard-hitting twist. You need to decide what the story needs - crescendo or pianissimo; to end loudly, or to end quietly. Play it by ear.\n\nA good stinger will leave your reader with a powerful feeling they can’t shake, a question they can’t answer, or an idea they can’t stop exploring. A great stinger does all three. When you hit that mark, a story that can take minutes to read can remain in the readers mind for a lifetime. It’s been nearly four years since I read SCP-4080 (“Spotlight” by Othellothecat), but I still count it among my favorite under-appreciated SCPs, simply because it left me with an indescribable, unsettling feeling of melancholy.\n\nThat’s the power of a good stinger.\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- T Rutherford//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou get two free moments to wow your reader with each SCP: the hook, and the stinger. If you've successfully snagged someone, and presented them with something worth reading, why would you then blow the whole thing with a lukewarm last impression? But a lot of writers do just that.\n\nWho among us is not haunted by \"Further testing authorized; results now awaiting declassification\" (SCP-025 running entirely out of steam), \"The sheet of paper was filed away in [DATA EXPUNGED]\" (SCP-068, and I sure hope that sheet of paper wasn't important), or god help us \"Testing is suggested for SCP-682,\" (SCP-117, deciding that the best way to end is to remind you of something more popular). Why would you hamstring yourself in this manner? If you can write an interesting SCP, surely you're capable of ending it on a high note.\n\nContrast with this: \"Do your job, because if you don't, we'll do it for you. And we have no idea what the fuck we're doing.\" That's 3319, by daveyoufool, and it's a perfect summation of what goes before: a sense of benevolent but thoroughly ominous observation, and a sense of pitch-black humour. It reinforces every other part of the SCP, and shows that the author has perfect control over the reader's experience. He can pull you in, he can keep you interested, and he can leave you feeling both mildly disturbed and thoroughly entertained. If you can do that — and you damn well can — what possible reason would you have for not doing it?\n\nIf you care about the quality of your work, care about the quality of your work throughout. Leave the reader feeling satisfied, or amused, or pissed off, or gutshot. Don't leave them feeling nothing at all.\n\nAnd that's why your favourite SCP probably sucks.\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- HarryBlank//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nA stinger is a fundamental aspect of the SCP article as we know it. It can be a sentence, like Swann's Proposal's final reveal that, yes, god is a bunch of horror writers, or SCP-5140's shocking revelation that Mount Everest is composed of piles of corpses. It can be an image, such as SCP-1875's horrific visage of the chess twins. A well-placed stinger can stick with you long after you've read the article.\n\nToday, a stinger is almost expected, the cherry on the top of a delicious article. A talented author can mislead the reader, carefully weaving details behind clever sentences and vague statements before slapping them upside the head with a literary baseball bat.\n\nAs an author, I get pretty familiar with the format of SCP writing, sometimes to the point where it can become monotonous, tired, or dull. A truly innovative stinger will catch me off-guard and for a brief second, make me rethink everything I thought I knew about writing. It should leave me in awe over its implications or how the author expertly pulled the wool over the reader's eyes for as long as necessary.\n\nSCP-3034, The Counting Station, written by The Great Hippo, is probably the quintessential stinger for me. It's classic horror, playing on the existing properties of the anomaly and giving them a new meaning with just one line. A change of words allows for an entirely different view of the article, and still leaves room for speculation. A stinger can also be comedic, serving as a smooth punchline to a well-crafted joke. Look no further than aismallard's hilarious SCP-5510 for proof. Regardless of tone, a good stinger is an author's last chance to make an impression on the reader, and send them to the upvote button with a smile on their face, or a pit in their stomach.\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- J Dune//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Artist's Shoutout\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+* ~ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/olicus-art Olicus] ~\n\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"margin: -0.75rem auto 0.5rem; display: flex; justify-content: center; justify-content: center; grid-gap: 0.15rem;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nav:side/social-twitter.png link=\"https://twitter.com/O1icus\" alt=\"Twitter\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/nav:side/social-tumblr.png link=\"https://olicus04.tumblr.com/\" alt=\"Tumblr\"]]\n[[image http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Anews-re/lofter.png link=\"https://olicus.lofter.com/\" alt=\"Lofter\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]//SCP-166 - Just a Teenage Gaea//[[/span]][[image http://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/04/166 link=\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/olicus-art\" style=\"width:50%;\"]][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span class=\"placard\"]]//Olicus is a Chinese artist who recently ported their art page to the English wiki.

At that time, I was just a reader. With the deepening of understanding (almost to July last year), I wanted to try to express these stories in the form of illustration. If my works can make people interested in them, it's very satisfying to me.\n>\n> I have made some fanarts about games and animation before, but not many. The number of works about SCP accounts for a large proportion of my total.\n\nTo cite a specific piece, your SCP-166 solo artwork (see above), what inspired you to work on this piece and what was your process?\n\n> I like the rewritten version by Cerastes very much. The relationship between Clef and 166 is the most touching point for me. I wanted to build her connection with the past through the paintings on the wall.\n>\n> I spend a lot of time thinking about composition of the illustration. Before creation, I went to look for some symbolic elements. They are often the core of an SCP (or tale).\n>\n> I often use procreate to paint. It takes about 3-8 hours to complete one. When the composition is produced, painting is just a process of expression.\n\nHow has your style developed into its current form, and how do you think it'll develop moving forward?\n\n> After I started to create some SCP artworks, I began to pay more attention to the transmission of emotions, stories and concepts in my works. Style also develops from these thoughts.\n>\n> In the future, I will still create illustrations and try other form(maybe voxel arts)at the same time. :D\n\nWith the unique style you've developed, which artists inspire you?\n\n> On the SCP wiki, SunnyClockwork is an artist who first inspired me. Their black and white art made me want to create something for SCPs. I like the sense of composition and form in their works. And they're so cool!\n\n[[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]//S. D.

I want to discuss the unofficial contest you and [[[SCPDeclassified]]] ran recently, Memecon, but, before we get into that, can you summarize who you are on the wiki, and your relationship with the SCPDeclassified Discord?\n\n> Of course! I'm Woedenaz, and most people know me for my CSS work on the site, creating the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide|Anomaly Classification System]]], the [[[theme:black-highlighter-theme|Black Highlighter theme]]], and... [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/woedenaz/offset/1 way too many other themes]. I only recently joined SCP Wiki staff as well, on MAST to work with navigation and on Tech as well. I've been on the SCP-Wiki for a very long time, though I was a filthy lurker for the vast majority of that time. It's only been since late 2019 that I've become much more active, particularly after I joined [[[cliche-con-2019|Clichecon]]] with [[[SCP-4205]]].\n>\n> As for the SCPD Discord, I'm a moderator there (and the only democratically elected one, for what that is worth) and have been for... maybe a year now? It doesn't feel that long but I think it has been.\n\nSeems you've made quite an impact on the SCP community. I'd imagine running contests is the next big step! How did the idea for unofficial, SCPD-run contests emerge, particularly Memecon?\n\n> It was partially inspired by Clichecon. I really like the idea of both setting limits to what authors can write for a contest while also challenging them to really push the boundaries of what is seen as \"acceptable\" inspiration for SCPs. There's a frustratingly common view among us that SCPs \"need\" to be something and anything venturing outside of that is \"wrong.\" Like the common binary view that if an SCP is humorous, it needs to be -J, for example. I'm a pretty strong believer that anything can be an SCP and it's important that authors be given the freedom to explore things not traditionally viewed as acceptable inspiration.\n>\n> So, Memecon was largely formed from this as well as the many past SCPs inspired by internet memes (and not even the most recent ones. Meme-inspired SCPs go back much farther than just the past year, like [[[SCP-1247]]] and [[[SCP-3006]]]). I thought it'd be a fun concept for authors to vibe off of and I'm genuinely extremely happy with the results!\n\nMakes enough sense, and is fitting given your break-through during Clichecon.\n\nNow we've had a couple different contests in the last few months, from our [[[jam-con-2021|fourth Jamcon]]] to the recent [[[scp6000contesthub|SCP-6000 contest]]]. How was setting up this contest, from its conception to the start of posting?\n\n> It was a lot of work! I really wanted to run this contest in as \"ideal\" of a manner as I could. There was also a little bit of a hiccup where we wanted to get it started on April Fool's Day but was then informed that 6kcon was going to happen soon, so we had to hold it off for a few months. Somewhat of a bummer but it worked out in the end. There was a lot of work getting the word out, making the announcement/hub page (which the staff were very kind to allow me to set up), and making sure all the rules and information made sense.\n\nYeah, a bit chaotic with all the goings on. However, the contest had a very impressive turn-out, with 22 currently surviving entries! What were some challenges or interesting occurrences that arose as posting started and things really started going?\n\n> Truthfully, it went very smoothly after posting! The biggest speed bump was probably people trying to get a grasp of what is or is not considered a \"meme\" for the contest. In full transparency, if I were to do this again, I think I'd do something similar to what Clichecon did and have a specific list of memes for authors to choose from instead of just letting them go wild. I still think it resulted in some very interesting meme choices, like [[[SCP-6169]]] referencing an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grass_Mud_Horse anti-censorship meme from China] was especially interesting!\n\nGreat to hear! It seems, in spite of that minor difficulty (or perhaps because of it), this contest spawned a wealth of interesting and unique entries. What are some of your favorite entries and/or entries you feel deserve more attention?\n\n> Well, SCP-6169 is definitely one, with its unique meme inspiration. I found [[[SCP-6363]]] particularly funny for reasons I don't want to spoil. [[[SCP-5883]]] was well received but I still think it could use more attention. [[[SCP-6993]]] is also being slept on, I think. I don't want to go into too much detail because I'd rather people read them for themselves :]\n>\n> Overall, it's somewhat hard to pick! There were certainly some entries more \"grand\" in scope than others but I genuinely don't think any of them are bad. I could pull any single one from the list on the Memecon hub and point to it as an example of why this contest was a success.\n\nVery flattering for the folks that wrote entries. With such a successful turn-out, what do you consider the future of SCPD contests? What have you learned from running this one?\n\n> I can't imagine us not doing one again. In fact, I'm confident we will. There's a bit of contest burn-out right now, though, with how many there were in a row (plus the [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/wandercon-2021 Wanderers' Library contest] going on right now.) Who knows what it'll be, though!\n>\n> Truthfully, I don't think I specifically learned anything from all of this. I've done large scale community organizing like this before and more or less knew what was getting myself into. If anything, I just feel more confident that we can do this again in the future since we clearly have enough members enthusiastic enough to participate in our contests.\n\nFair enough! Thank you for the interview, Woed!\n\n> Of course! Thanks for the opportunity. :]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ SCP Data & Trends\n[[/div]]\n\nAll the goings-on of the site condensed into bite-sized takeaways!

A summary of and link to the policy discussion threads can be found below:\n\nModerator Riemann and the Rewrite team put forward two proposals for anonymous publishing of articles ([*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14135874/anonymous-publishing-of-articles 1], [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14150271/anonymous-publishing-of-articles-2 2]). Under this new policy, authors who wish to publish articles without their name connected to them will be able to do so by sending a draft anonymously to the Rewrite team. This proposal passed without incident.\n\nModerator Yossipossi proposed [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14143271/discussion-required-vice-captainship requiring Vice-Captainship] on each staff team to deal with issues like lack of delegation and issues of succession/staff hiatus on the part of Captains, and was near-unanimously passed.\n\nAs a follow-up, Yossipossi started a brief discussion regarding [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14146293/discussion-defining-captainship the role of Captains] on staff. Proposals on what Captains currently are, could be, or should be are discussed to be used in the future.\n\nModerator stormbreath and the Tech team suggest adding [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14145552/discussion-open-graph-meta-tags open graph meta tags], making links on social media embed a short description of the site. This also passes smoothly.\n\nModerator cybersqyd proposes [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14152690/discussion-disc-non-disc-thread-summary-posts summary threads for long disc/non-disc threads] on 05command. This would allow easier perusal of complex user records onsite internally and for users browsing the staff site.\n\nAdministrator DrBleep puts forward a reworked [*http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14148954/discussion-promotions-proposal promotion policy]. Under this policy, all Operational Staff and above will vote on the promotion of Moderators and Admins (previously, only Moderators and Administrators could vote on the promotion of Moderators, and only Administrators could vote to promote Administrators). This is received enthusiastically by staff and passed without incident.\n\nOperational Staff OCuin proposes the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14149325/discussion-mainsite-policy-discussion mainsite policy discussion forum], where all future policy threads on 05command will be mirrored to allow the community to voice their thoughts and concerns on staff issues. This is largely supported and (as if the new [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/forum/c-7329566/staff-policy-discussions Staff Policy Discussion subforum] didn't give it away) passed without a vote.\n\nFinally, a second discussion on a [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14151615/discussion-staffchat-recap-team Staffchat Recap team], a team made to summarize and relay discussions in staffchat to the community at large in the name of transparency, is started. After pages of fervent discussion, the issue is put to voting and passes. Expect the first recaps in the coming weeks!\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Staff Spotlight: [[[http://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main | Deletions Team]]]\n+++++ Featuring: Jacob Conwell\n+++++ Interviewer: WhiteGuard\n\n------\n\n+++ Interview\n[[/=]]\n\nAlrighty, let's start out with the subteam of MAST that you happen to lead: Deletions. What all do you do when you are part of this team? What is the process?\n\n> Deletions sub-team is mostly what it says on the tin. We are responsible for the process of removing articles from the wiki that have sunk below the deletion threshold of -10 votes. At this point, we add the in-deletion tag, a 24 hour timer to allow a buffer for the article to potentially rise back to -9 or above, as well as to allow for at least a total of 3 OS+ staff to confirm the deletion. Once this 24 hour period is up, the article is deleted. We are also responsible for the summary deletion of blank pages, unfinished drafts, and other inappropriate pages from the wiki. Note, only someone on staff with a rank of moderator or above is capable of carrying out the actual deletion. This is a summary, of course, the [[[deletions guide]]] has a much more in depth look on the full process and all those little intricacies.\n\nAnd how did you personally get involved with Deletions work?\n\n> I used to be frequently involved in deletions when I initially became an OS member of wikistaff, mostly via voting for deletion confirmation. After I became a Mod, Zyn (who was the primary person running deletions at the time) showed me the ropes and I kind of just fell into place as the 'deletions-guy.' It was then that MAST was created and deletions was absorbed as one of its many sub-teams.\n\nYou were recently promoted to both Vice Captain of MAST as well as Administrator? How does it feel to be an admin and has anything really changed for you yet?\n\n> Ha ha, its still pretty early into my tenure as Admin, so not a whole lot has changed as of this moment. Deletions are still run on a daily basis, tags are added, etc. I imagine as things move along we'll see more changes from the promotion become apparent. As for how it feels, pretty cool, to be honest. Its nice to have all my time/contributions on the site recognized and to learn that I have a reputation as a 'calm and level-headed voice.' It feels like I have really made an impact.\n\nSpeaking of making an impact, you are quite the writer as well. What would you say you are the most proud of in terms of your writing contributions to the site?\n\n> Probably the [[[Those Twisted Pines hub | Those Twisted Pines]]] canon. Ultimately it serves as the collection of my works involving [[[Anderson Robotics hub | Anderson Robotics]]], [[[Three Portlands hub | Three Portlands]]], and [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64 | Site-64]]]. Its awesome to have created a setting that has a really 'lived in' feeling to it. Especially one that plays nicely with so many other canons (like Third Law and [[[The Gulf]]]). While its not as grand in scope as some of the other canons out there, I think there is something to be said about keeping the focus on one location (ala Site-64) and a fairly steady cast of characters (ala Vincent Anderson, Sasha Merlo, Director Holman, etc.) It also absolutely warms my heart to see others contributing to it.\n\nSounds great! I believe that will do it for now. As always, it has been a pleasure, Conwell!\n\n> Thanks, WhiteGuard!\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ The Site News Team\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++ Editor\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"f-flex\"]]\n[[div class=\"f-con\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++ WhiteGuard\n[[span class=\"placard\"]]//Editor, Interviewer//[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\nHey there!
