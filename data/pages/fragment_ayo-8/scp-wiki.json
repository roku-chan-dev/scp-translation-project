  "content": "She peered past the layer of tears in her eyes to notice she was somewhere new. It was more spacious than the van, and moving. Adams sat across from her with an exasperated sigh.\n\n\"…What?\" Zena began wiping her face. Adams stared with a stern expression, face quivering.\n\n“I didn’t ask for your life story.” Her laughter breached containment. “Holy shit! Gya-hahaha!”\n\nZena looked around. There was no Wensley, no Lyla or even Mort. \n\n“Well thanks for the greenlight to use lethal force. Five stars, standing ovation.” She clapped.\n\n“So…am I accepted?”\n\n“Accepted she says. This ain’t University, Cho.\" She chuckled. \"But sure. You’re also not going to die, but you clearly have more important things on your mind.”\n\n“I…Yes! YES!” She hopped out of her seat and continued bouncing.\n\n\"Enough!”\n\nShe froze and catapulted back to her seat.\n\n“Do you remember what I said in there? I think you’ve embarrassed yourself enough don’t you think?”\n\n“Right, I know.” Her eyes darted away from Adams. “I’m just a subject here.”\n\n“That’s what I’m talking about!” Adams groaned. “Researching your anomaly is why you’re here but you’re not a dog for god sake. I was worried you were gonna be a conscript but you’re really more of a fanatic.”\n\n“What does that mean?”\n\n“Just because you’re a thing here doesn’t mean you’re a thing.”\n\n“Sure you should be telling her that?” The shaggy bearded man chimed in from behind the wheel. \n\n“It’s fine. If she dies or fucks up her health before they can even research her, it doesn’t really help us either. Besides she’d eventually already figure out I’m more of a bodyguard anyway.”\n\nShe took out a pack of cigarettes and smiled.\n\n“She’s not stupid.\"\n\n She began fiddling with one between her fingers like a coin. “Anyway you get what I’m telling you, right Cho?”\n\nZena watched vacantly as Adams  struggled with finding the right words for the first time since she they had met. She also said struggled to find her lighter.\n\nA thought crossed her mind after looking out the window, now free of static, just an empty field expanding as far as she could see. The kind they use to run in.\n\n“…You may not be important, but that don’t mean you don’t matter.”\n\n“Hey that works, not bad.” Adams laughed.\n\n“My brother used to tell me that.”\n\n“Sounds like your brother’s full of shit.”\n\n“Yea, he is.”\n\n“Come on Valdes? We were getting somewhere good.” Adams groaned.\n\nSomething occurred to Zena and she didn’t want it to be brushed off.\n\n“So what was with that lake and the boat and stuff?”\n\n“The Mnestic you were under operates differently for everyone. I needed a crazy memetic to go along with it too to keep your head straight. Good thing you’re easy to hypnotize.” She finally lit the cigarette.\n\n“So, it wasn’t real after all?”\n\n“Oh, it was real enough. We heard every word. I recorded it too, want to have a look?”\n\n“NO!” Her face burned up.\n\n“Ha! Anyway, whatever you saw in your head is between you and the voices. All I care about is which ones will play ball and which ones I gotta shoot. Simple and clean.” She smiled as she exhaled.\n\nOf course they would even have those kinds of drugs here. It really was just a joke to her. Asshole. Just a bunch of assholes here.\n\nShe sulked and turned her attention to the window. The reflection was clear and more importantly real. She really did look like her father now…but she also looked like her mother. It’s not like either of them were ugly anyway. She did get a bit rounder though, but she was a little scared by how much definition was still poking through her now doughy arms.  Her head wasn’t as much a potato as it was a melon. Not much better but, for once, she felt her big nose kind of fixed the picture instead of destroying it. She knew she had looked better, but it all looked right.\n\n“Admiring the view? I got to say, you clean up nice Cho! Even if I did the heavy lifting.”\n\nShe faced the smoking agent, doing her best not to betray her annoyance.\n\n“…No one told me about you.”\n\n“Are you mad they didn’t?”\n\n“Yes.”\n\n“Pretty sure I know the answer, but I’m dying to hear why?”\n\nShe was the first person she could remember who didn’t lie to her. Definitely here at the foundation but probably not since her mother, could she remember that. Thinking about how things operated at 118, it would have been easier for her job not to bother with any of it.\n\n…\n\n“Because you’re crazy.”\n\nAdams laughed, almost choking on the smoke sputtering out of her mouth. “Well I'm in good company. Welcome home, Cho.”\n\n\nZena turned back to the window, looking to gaze past her reflection this time.\n\n\n\n,,//##F8C8DC|Well?##//,,\n\n//##FFC000|yea...##//\n\n------\n\n+ ##A8F19B|I'm Gonna Be Alright##",
