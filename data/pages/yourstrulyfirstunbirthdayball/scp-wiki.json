Twisted and thorny vines crawled the walls of the pit, they reached out with teas and candies and toys, numerous small things, useless things, to peddle and whet. \n\nThese animate plants were keen to sell, to convince the Hatter all they need is right there, with papers and buttons and widgets and bells, everything he owned should be theirs, and theirs only.

The Hatter frolicked along the path through the grasses, eavesdropping on the conversations that flowed from the flowers of the gregarious grasses:\n[[/div]]\n\n\"I think I heard someone fall from the sky?\" one of them chattered, hushed and suspicious.\n\n\"Is it more of the suited men? I don't like them, they're loud and they put up those ugly gray ladders!\" another replied.\n\n\"Will you two grow a grain?

The Hatter, however, had a one track mind. Eavesdropping was fine enough, he needed to find something to puff. And despite his fixation, he noticed a vine reach out to try and trip him-\n\n\"Hey, mister, I don't recognize you? Are you the man they say fell from the sky, the great blue?\" One of the grasses yawned. It grabbed the Hatter gently, intent on an answer.\n\n\"Has it been so long, so terribly long?

It was dusty and draped in disrepair- very little signs of present activity, and it certainly wasn't actively drilling. It was a few minutes of spiraling up the scaffolding before they reached the top of the rig, a large set of platforms wrapped around the extractor, the terminus for the pipes that permeated the wondrous soil below. \n[[/div]]\n\n**##forestgreen|Taxes##** immediately rummaged around the spare barrels and tins designed to store the oil, but the Hatter simply rested against the rusted rails and looked out at the stretched of wooded expanse ahead of the rig. Clusters of colossal flowers and mushrooms dwarfed by the towering rigs, distant fields of dull gray death from where his fingers had touched, and further off, no doubt, his old stomping yard.\n\n\"**##forestgreen|Here we are, then! I found a tin, filled with oil. Have you got a pipe already?##**\" **##forestgreen|Taxes##** asked, producing a crumpled metal tin, tarnished and browned.\n\nThe Hatter pulled out a plain glass pipe and lighter. He absent-mindedly handed the pipe to **##forestgreen|Taxes##**, who filled it with the pearlescent fluid. It took a few attempts to get it to catch, but eventually it did start smoking, producing dark purple fumes with dazzling glimmers of light speckled throughout.\n\n\"Why did I have to leave this place?\" The Hatter coughed, sputtering out smoke.\n\n\"**##forestgreen|No clue.

Sixty years of service, sixty years of furnishing and stylizing all manner of nobility, of barons and dukes and even princes of hearts, and yet this, this was a time to sweat. The Cupmaster had never heard of the Hatter before the coup. Who wears hats anymore, anyways? In the aptly aforementioned sixty years, the Cupmaster had never done  a hat. \n[[/div]]\n\nThough, he hadn't done many cups, either. \n\nInterpreting the purchase orders written by the Hatter and his council had proven to be a conundrum. At one point, he had been tasked with turning the luminous chandelier into a fully edible cake, perhaps to be dropped on the guests to celebrate the crowning. However, the Cupmaster managed to convince him of this impossibility, the ceilings had been lifted from 40 meters to infinity, and the Cupmaster was not very good at climbing. \n\nStill, he had laid out a regal cloth upon the central banquet table, and ordered the finest of leaded glass instruments and utensils for eating. The drapes, he felt, we meant to match the cloths upon the table, for everything to be this harmonious tasteful, and subtly lavish production. It had to be made worth the attendees' time, what with the ordeal of navigating all of the labyrinthian halls installed at the whim of the would-be-king. The bears were constantly shuffling about, adding embroideries and buttons wherever a naked surface was found. \n\nThe Cupmaster was not fond of the bears. They were constantly frollicking and mucking about, the ones who laid the tile and grout, who toiled endlessly at construction projects, whose origins the Cupmaster did not know much about. They walked and danced and drew like children, with bodies of cloth and eyes of coal. But they labored away dutifully, efficiently, and loyally to the Hatter-King's goal. The Cupmaster himself was not nearly as certain. From generations of servants upon servants upon servants, he knew a cummerbund from lapel, a bergamot from mandarin, but he did not much care for the pastimes of infants.\n\nBest bite his tongue-\n\n\"No, No, No- Lilac! Lilac, lilac, lilac!\" the Hatter huffed. \"What is wrong with you? Does this look like lilac? I want it lilac, not purple! My friends- Hate! Purple... but they like lilac, and I need lilac. No, happy, happy, happy- I'll do it myself!\"\n\nHe shook his frock coat as if trying to rid it of something before producing a blade from one of his seemingly endless pockets. Gently folding the table cloth up and off of the table in front, he laid his hand on the table.\n\n\"I can assure you, your grace, we can find-\" the Cupmaster panicked.\n\n\"Quiet! I am counting! Mathing! Shhh-\" the Hatter mumbled to himself: \"One, Two, Three, and-!\"\n\nIn quick, quiet fury, the blade falls, briskly severing one, two, three fingers from the Hatter's right hand. A brief wince and sharp inhale is all he produces before the fingers are plucked and plopped into his mouth agape. The Cupmaster shrieked, fraught with horror and confusion.\n\n\"Not as good,\" the Hatter says between chews, \"As ladyfingers-\"\n\nHe spits out the chewed mass he had collected against his cheek onto the floor. Once flesh, now a sticky clump of sparkles. \n\n\"Chop-chop! Our friends will be here any day now!\" He says, before kicking the clump down the hall a bit. The Hatter curtsies and looks expectantly at the clump on the ground- \"Aha!\"\n\nIt twitches and grows, and somewhat glows- creases become valleys and valleys become curves, and as it increases in size, it contorts until a silhouette springs forth, garnished neatly- with two little eyes. From the speck of sticky Wondergunk, comes another one- complete with an elegant frock and hat, much like the Hatter's own.\n\n\"Dr. Styletainment- No, we'll work on the name later... you must work quickly, dress the hall, please, please, and!\" the Hatter looks at the Cupmaster with boredom, \"Get this thing something to wear.\"\n\n\"What's wrong with my suit?\" the Cupmaster frowns. \n\n\"It's dated.\" The Hatter and his new yes-man say in unison.\n\n\"New, new, new, everything must be new! Shiny, buttons! Joy, Joy, Joy! Out with the old, out with the hearts and clubs and spades and diamonds- well, I'm okay with diamonds. But everything else, new, better, funner! Do you understand?\" The Hatter points at the tablecloth. \"This must go.\"\n\n\"It's too dark for the room, reminds me of elephant tongue. That's not what you want, is it?\" the yes-man asks.\n\n\"Yes, yes, exactly! It's too, elephant-y! That's exactly it. You understand it! Flawless! Great work! Take care of that while I go do very important things!\" the Hatter scatters off, up the stairs, suspended in a flurry of scurrying builder bears, each carrying out the various agendas set by the yes-court, the whims of the soon to be king. The tallest order of all, fixing the dullness, the drabness, the not-at-all-wondrousness, that had to be carried out before the crowning. \n\nThe Hatter cared not for the architecture of buildings, and so the avatars severed from his being were tasked with draping the halls and corridors and buttresses with towering mountains of cloth, fabric, plaid, with gears that turned large clocks and springs, with rooms that popped like jacks in boxes, with a crown at the top of this citadel designed to mirror that which would soon rest on the head of the Hatter, one that waived away  Wondertainment, and instead, promised nothing but autocratic wonder.\n\n\"Oh good, you're back!\" said a man much like him, save dressed and colored flat. \"There are matters to discuss,\" said Bureautainment, anointed Wondercrat. The Hatter, the King, waves his hands:\n\n\"It is slow, it is slow, it is far too slow. Who is leading the bears? Look at my fingers! I said lilac, and he brought me purple. Not even tyrian purple! It's too atomic, too atomic. All of the friends, all of the friends-\"\n\n\"Well, I wanted to convene, there are matters at hand,\" Bureautainment decried. If the Hatter must reign, so too must the king meddle in matters of land. \"What of the brothers?\"\n\n\"Let them eat cake! But the macarons are for VIPs, only. Very Imaginative People! That they are not,\" The Hatter yawned. \"What a boring idea.\"\n\n\"Do we send an invitation?\" the Wondercrat asked, troubled trenches forming on his face. \n\n\"No,\" said the Hatter, \"It'd be a waste!\"\n\n\"Well, then, I guess we should make do.\" the yes-man resigned. \"The builder-bears have made steady progress on the changes to the castle, which should be done in time for the coronation-\"\n\n\"Unbirthday Ball.\" The Hatter corrected.\n\n\"Unbirthday Ball, right, yes. My apologies.\"\n\n\"You are humbly forgiven. Please hurry, though. I need to rest. It's such hard work today!\"\n\n\"Well, there are some troubles, the head helper of the builders asked, is it so necessary to have the clock tower built of clocks? His brigade talks of bricks, since clocks have less stock... The tower that rests on a jack in a box, well, that was no task, but the builder bear barracks grow weary of clocks.\"\n\n\"It's non-negotiable, I fear. They will have to make do. Clocks clog time...\" The Hatter frowns. \"Everything will be perfect, everything will work perfectly. This is perfect.\" \n\n\"Of course, my liege.\" The Yes Man recuses himself.\n\nThe Hatter paces in figures of eight. \n\n\"{{WHAT'S THE FUSS?

That {{DEATH}} still hung around, even now in this world, that Time still asked for him, it loomed in his mind. Through feverish whimsy, the thoughts linger, forming...\n\n\"What of my subjects?\" The Hatter mutters. He wanders again where {{DEATH}} did us part, surveying the land unfurled from his fort: the pastures, the parishes, the mercantile carriages- the land of which his finances had greedily disparaged. What of the people who knew not of toys, the labor that supplied him with oil? Should we all not be partiers?\n\nTime is not here now.

The Hatter protested at first, but eventually turned around on the basis of combining opposition suppression with decoration- he quite liked the look of the balloons.\n\nMonsieur Jacquisine Smythingfarfarawelli had been hired as caterer, providing the most exquisite pastries and desserts. There was to be- per order of the King- only sweets and desserts, with the exception of pea and lamb aspic, an old favorite of {{DEATH}}'s.

Though there was a vast array of knick-knacks and treats and pleasantries, he still felt it prudent to fraternize with all of the future citizenry. However, the main event, the coronation proceedings, were due to begin any moment now, and he was hesitant to delve terribly deep into any one conversation, lest he miss the start of the ceremony. This was, of course, his trusted responsibility, as one of the Hatter's longest and most trusted friends- a seat in the Yes Court was not nearly as fitting, nor a coveted ministership- yes, this was the most important place **##forestgreen|Taxes##** could be.\n\n\"Attention all partiers, revelers, and future subjects of his majesty: please welcome, to kick off this Unbirthday Ball: the Unbirthday Ballet, presented by Misters Tumble and Twirl!:\" The Yes-man of the Ministry of Petty Complaints had been tasked with leading the ceremony and attention-seeking. The opening act, a dance performed by two Little Misters, never released, was to be watched by all attendees before the king was to be crowned.\n\nMr. Tumble, a fragile, crystalline man, performed his acrobatics with grace and anxiety. Mr. Twirl performed his contortionist act with freakish delight, and the crowds ooh'd and ahh'd at the mystical balance between the two's movements. \n\nTaxes paid acute attention to every reaction, scanning the faces for signs of boredom and sternness- signs of future dissent. Instead, the two misters carried along, wowing the crowd and finally climaxing with Mr. Tumble cascading from atop the chandelier and shattering on the ground- with the onlookers gasping aloud.\n\nMr. Twirl then produced a bejeweled dustbin and broom, sweeping Mr. Tumble's shards up, and gathering them into a tumbler. He shook the tumbler back and forth, gently spinning and twisting upward. At last he release and flung the contents to the floor, revealing a tiny Mr. Tumble, perfectly intact. \n\nThe audience applauded and marveled and gasped. But Mr. Twirl waved his hands, a flourish to silence, and proceeded to slowly twist inwardly outward with bombast and violence. His arms intertwined, rubbery like jello, he turned into knots, ties, and then a giant birthday bow. Mr. Twirl continued stretching in all different manners, before exerting himself for the final act: he tied and tied, and knotted and knotted, and tangled and twirled into a great big rubber ball at least three ceilings tall.\n\nThe crowd erupted into hysterical applause.\n\n\"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, those were our astoundingly talented Little Misters Tumble and Twirl: can you believe that they used to work a boring corporate job?\" The Yes-Man of Petty Complaints commended, drawing attention back to the ceremony. \"But now: the moment we are all here for...\"\n\nUp above, a Yes Man gulped.\n\n[[div class=\"dropcapParagraph\"]]\n\"Is this really what we want?\" whispered the Minister of Bouncy Fortifications to the Hatter.\n[[/div]]\n\nThis Yes Man, like all others, was concocted from a severed finger of the Hatter, a spitting image of the magnanimous soon-to-be-king.\n\n\"Of course it is, of course of course!

Let's give them the show that I want! Hurry, hurry, hurry!\" The Hatter anxiously fiddled with the armrests.\n\n{{DEATH}} shrugged, and unceremoniously plopped the crown on the Hatter's matted hair. The crowd roared.\n\n\"Yes, yes, my adoring new subjects, young and old, pink and not-so-pink: It is I, your king, your most bestest belovedest, it is time now, for me to take the helm, the heaviest hat of all, the crown, the crown of all of Wonderland, yes, yes, please keep clapping, keep clapping from the tackiest chateau to the dingiest town!\" \n\nThe Hatter, now the king, stepped off the chandelier and onto the ballroom floor. He waltzed towards the curtain that concealed the Great Unbirther.\n\n\"And now for my final act as a simple man, now, great subjects, I take the throne, I take the titled: I will be unborn, yes, turned anew, I will be unborn from a simple Hatter into what I always knew, your most excellent, wisest, handsomest, fairest, justest, humblest, and most importantly: your //Sanest// King!\"\n\n[[div class=\"dropcapParagraph\"]]\nThe Hatter pulled down the curtain with a theatrical flourish.\n\n{{\"ARE YOU HAVING FUN YET?\"}} asked {{DEATH}}, poking from behind.\n\nThe Hatter simply ignored, and let himself be baptized by the candy-pink flesh.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| previous-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wearerofmanyhats\n| previous-title = Wearer Of Many Hats\n| next-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8981\n| next-title = The Wonder War\n| hub-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-sanest-king\n| hub-title = The Sanest King Hub\n]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=PoufyPoufson]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
