Duty assignments at Containment Site 1663-0 are not to exceed two (2) weeks in length, and all personnel must be administered Class B amnestics prior to being transferred off-site.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1663 is the special duty assignment for personnel assigned to Containment Site 1663-0, located near [REDACTED]. The research performed at Containment Site 1663-0 is considered a Euclid-class infohazard, thus necessitating the extraordinary containment requirements outlined in this document.\n\nThe data isolation of SCP-1663 was approved on [REDACTED] by the then-retiring O5-█, whose immediate retirement and subsequent mandatory amnestic administration was considered not in violation of standing regulations prohibiting the exposure of O5 Council members to SCP objects.\n\nSince then, ████ (█) separate retiring O5 Council members have upheld the established containment procedures for SCP-1663.\n\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-1663 may continue on to the [[[Additional Documentation for SCP-1663 Personnel]]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1662]]] | SCP-1663 | [[[SCP-1664]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
