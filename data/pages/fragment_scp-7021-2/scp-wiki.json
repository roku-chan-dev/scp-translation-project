No further containment procedures are required.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Item Description:** SCP-7021 appears to be an Arkansas Centennial half dollar coin from the year 1938. This coin is identical in appearance to its non-anomalous counterparts. SCP-7021 is in perfect condition and shows no signs of age or wear.\n[[include component:image-block name=halfdollar|caption=SCP-7021  photo taken during [DATA EXPUNGED]|align=left|width=80px]]\n\nSCP-7021’s anomalous abilities are triggered once SCP-7021’s changes ownership. This transfer of ownership can be between individuals, corporate entities, and other groups. SCP-7021 can be part of a larger amount of money. Transferring ownership through other means other than physically allocating the coin does not trigger its effects and the exchange won’t be recognized by SCP-7021.\n\nOnce ownership has been transferred SCP-7021-1 events will manifest. The new owner of SCP-7021 shall from that point be designated as SCP-7021-A and the previous owner as SCP-7021-B.\n\nSCP-7021 anomalous abilities manifest in a series of accidents that befall to the new owner, SCP-7021-A. These accidents are referred to as SCP-7021-1 events and affect either the individual, corporate entities or group as a whole. These accidents can range from personal minor injury to catastrophic scenarios. SCP-7021 events target SCP-7021-A but can affect everything in its immediate vicinity by proxy. It has been shown to escalate in severity over time with the frequency and intensity of SCP-7021 events leading to more life threatening situations. This can lead to extremely dangerous large scale events if handled not properly and in time.\n\nDue to the continuous exposure to danger individuals receiving SCP-7021 often perish within a month of receiving SCP-7021. If it is exchanged between groups or corporate entities it will affect every individual involved with its ownership on a personal level with different timescales and intensities. This often leads to the group being dissolved within a 3 month period, depending on the size and scale of SCP-7021-A.\n\nAfter SCP-7021-A perishes, SCP-7021-1 events will continue to take place around SCP-7021’s proximity. It affects events around itself within an unknown radius. These events will escalate in a similar way as if the area SCP-7021 find itself is a living entity that has taken possession of it.\nOnce another person, corporate entity or group takes ownership of the coin these SCP-7021-1 events will repeat. These new owners will be designated as SCP-7021-A.\n\n\nCurrently, the only way to stop SCP-7021-1 events from occurring is through either SCP-7021 being returned to SCP-7021-B, or if SCP-7021-B perishes.\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"> border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n//To the records and information security administration,//\n@@@@\n//I found this file on our database.
