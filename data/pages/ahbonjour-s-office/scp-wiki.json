  "title": "Dr. Bonjour's Office",
  "content": "His office is warm and full, and the first thing you notice is that it smells like oranges. Oranges and lemons? Citrus in general, but citrus that has been boiled in apple cider and cinnamon, warm and comforting in your belly. His office smells like Christmastime even in the height of July. His office smells like coming home.\n\nHe's not there at the moment, but that doesn't matter since he left the door unlocked. \"If the door is unlocked,\" he tells all of the junior researchers and new hires, \"then you can come in and make yourself some tea. You can leave what I need to look at on my desk, or you can wait for me to come back, I don't mind either way.\" \n\nHe keeps a small table off to the side for his tea accouterments, including an electric kettle, a teapot, sugar cubes, and several varieties of loose leaf. You decide some tea might be nice, and you flick the kettle on.\n\nThere are lots of things to look at while you're waiting for the water to boil. What would you like to look at first?\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab His corkboard]]\nHe's pretty open about the projects he's working on and keeps a bulletin board with reminders about them on one of his walls. He pins them up with novelty pins from truck stops, little buttons with pithy sayings like \"I Left My Heart in Michigan\" and \"Save a Horse, Ride a Texan\". Do you want to pick one up?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"No\" hide=\"No\"]]\nYou wisely decide to just read the papers, and not fiddle with \"KEEP CALM and EAT PEACHES, Georgia\"\n\n> **Dr. Emil Bonjour**\n> **Head Researcher on:**\n> * [[[scp-2118 |SCP-2118]]]\n> * [[[scp-2132 |SCP-2132]]]\n> * [[[scp-2733 |SCP-2733]]]\n> * [[[scp-3424 |SCP-3424]]]\n> **Reports Drafted:**\n> * [[[six-letters-addressed |Six Letters Addressed to the SCP Foundation (and One Letter Home)]]]\n> * [[[first-quarto |First Quarto]]]\n> * [[[second-quarto |Second Quarto]]]\n> * [[[why-this-tho |Silber Strikes Back!

Was that really him? Must have been a long time ago. That hardly looks like the same person now.\n\nYou don't notice anything else interesting and decide to look elsewhere.[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Yes\" hide=\"Yes\"]]\nYou pluck one of the pushpins off the corkboard without thinking and several papers drop to the ground, making a mess out of his floor. Look what you've done now! You are very clumsy. And all because you wanted to get a closer look at \"Live Well, Laugh Often, Drink More Wine, California\". You read the papers while you're picking them up.\n\n> **Dr. Emil Bonjour**\n> **Head Researcher on:**\n> * [[[scp-2118 |SCP-2118]]]\n> * [[[scp-2132 |SCP-2132]]]\n> * [[[scp-2733 |SCP-2733]]]\n> * [[[scp-3424 |SCP-3424]]]\n> **Reports Drafted:**\n> * [[[six-letters-addressed |Six Letters Addressed to the SCP Foundation (and One Letter Home)]]]\n> * [[[first-quarto |First Quarto]]]\n> * [[[second-quarto |Second Quarto]]]\n> * [[[why-this-tho |Silber Strikes Back! (OC DO NOT STEAL!!!!!)]]]\n> **Current Projects:**\n> * [http://scpaesthetics.tumblr.com SCP Aesthetics] (ongoing)\n> * Spare Parts series\n> **File Photo:**\n\nThe picture makes you pause. Was that really him? Must have been a long time ago. That hardly looks like the same person now.\n\nYou pick the papers up and stand to tack them back on when you see a piece of paper stapled to the board that must have been covered by the papers you just dropped. It says:\n> **Dr. Emil Bonjour**\n> **Head Researcher on:**\n> * SCP-████\n\nThe rest of the paper is ripped away. You get the feeling you were not supposed to have seen this, so you tack the papers back up and turn your attention elsewhere.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab His record collection]]\nThe collection is about half records and half CDs, with a couple of tapes tucked in the back. He has a gramophone but no CD player; you assume he must play those on his computer. Which ones do you want to look at?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The records\" hide=\"The records\"]]\nThe records are all older music, things that probably had CDs by now, but for whatever reason, he held onto the records. Why? Sentimentality? A few of them catch your eye as you flick through them.\n\n* //Revolver//, The Beatles\n* //Licensed to Ill//, The Beastie Boys\n* //Follies//, Original Broadway Cast, 1971\n* //Ziggy Stardust//, David Bowie\n* //Pippin//, Original Broadway Cast, 1972\n\nThe rest of them don't interest you. [[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The CDs\" hide=\"The CDs\"]]\nThe CDs all look like a bit more modern music, some things that only just came out, some things that are a bit older, scratched up around the edges. You doubt those still play. A few of them catch your eye as you flick through them.\n\n* //Marvin's Marvelous Mechanical Museum//, Tally Hall\n* //Les Miserables//, Original West End Cast, 1985\n* //Off to the Races//, Jukebox the Ghost\n* //VHS//, X Ambassadors\n* //Legally Blonde: The Musical//, Original Broadway Cast, 2007\n\nThe rest of them don't interest you. [[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"The tapes\" hide=\"The tapes\"]]\nThere are three tapes, and only two of them are for music. The ones with music on them are both Christmas-themed, with names written on the side of them in ballpoint pen: \"Many Times Many Ways\" and \"Mayor Daisby, Marion Bright\". \n\nThe third tape is the kind you would put in a camcorder, roughly the same size as the Christmas tapes, but on the side of it is written \"SCP-████ Interview Logs\". The SCP's number has been blacked out with a marker. You look around for a way to play it, and when you can't see one, wisely decide to put it back.[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab His bookshelf]]\nHis bookshelf is divided into two sections: fiction and nonfiction. Fiction is on the top shelves, and the books there are worn and well-loved, dust-free and several of them with cracked spines and sticky notes sticking out of them. The nonfiction texts are largely medical and scientific journals in his field, but these are in significantly better condition than the fiction books. The ones on the bottom look like he hasn't touched them since grad school.\n\nWhat would you like to look at first?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Fiction\" hide=\"Fiction\"]]\nMany of the books look like they've been through the wringer: spines cracked, covers eroded, pages torn around the edges. He doesn't take good care of his books. What a shame. You can still read the spines on some of them.\n\n* //The World According to Garp//, John Irving\n* //The Nutshell Studies of Unexplained Death//, Corinne May Botz\n* //20th Century Ghosts//, Joe Hill\n* //Lamb: The Gospel According to Biff, Christ's Childhood Pal//, Christopher Moore\n* //Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?//, Edward Albee [[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Nonfiction\" hide=\"Nonfiction\"]]\nYou scan the medical and scientific texts, none of them catching your attention for more than a moment. Many of them have gone unused for months, maybe years. He must do a lot of online research.\n\nAs you're flicking through \"//Captive Audience: The Science and Damaging Effects Behind America's Prison System//\", you find a photograph. It's tucked between pages, somewhere no one but a snoop would find it.\n\nThe person in the photograph (you can't determine a gender) is smiling and has flour on their face. They're holding a book, but you can't read the title. The two things you can see very clearly are their eyes, bright and sparkling, dark brown and amber-ringed. Their hair is brown on the sides but a lovely light lavender on top, and you feel like you've seen this person before. They must be Dr. Bonjour's partner, you can see the ring on their finger, but you can't shake the feeling that you've seen them somewhere else. You put the picture back in the book and slide it back onto the shelf.[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab His index cards]]\nDr. Bonjour keeps a running tally of stats on his wall, index cards with percentages and numbers, which makes you laugh. He always says \"you're only as good as your last project\", and likes to remind himself of that. \n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"ahbonjour\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ File ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Last Comment ||~ Length ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%commented_at%% || %%size%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\nOnly as good as your last project. She's so competitive! Still, maybe it helps. [[collapsible show=\".\" hide=\"--what's that?\"]]\n\nThere's an additional index card on the ground, wedged between the warped baseboard and the umber drywall. It's covered in scribbles and marks, worn by repeated attacks from an eraser. Under the mess, you can barely read the words \"SCP-████\". What is this thing? You're not sure what to do with the card, so you just put it back.[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab I'm done looking around]]\n\nYou feel like you've done enough snooping and you should probably get back to work. You drop the papers you brought him on his desk an open folder catches your eye.\n\n> **Name:** Dr. Emil Bonjour\n> **Security Clearance:** Level 3\n> **Specialization:** Counseling\n> **Subspecialization:** Grief and mourning\n\nThe kettle begins whistling. You absentmindedly pick up the file and carry it with you as you begin making tea.\n\n> **History**: Emil Otto Bonjour was recruited from his position as a teacher at Sunnycare Day School in ██████, OK, after one of his students began displaying anomalous properties. Dr. Bonjour reacted with the grace and aptitude expected of a Foundation researcher rather than a preschool educator, and after verifying his background and credentials, human resources elected to offer him a position as a junior researcher. He rose through the ranks\n\nYou lose your grip on the spoon and send tea leaves flying everywhere. You swear, drop the file, and begin sweeping it off the floor with your hands. There has to be a broom somewhere, a broom--!\n\n> resulted in █ casualties\n\nWhat was that? The black box catches your attention and you abandon your sweeping efforts, instead pulling the file closer, ripping off a sticky note to read the section.\n\n> Dr. Bonjour was temporarily relieved from his position after incident ████-3, the escape of SCP-████. The ensuing chase and destruction resulted in █ casualties and ██ injuries. There was some suspicion that the escape was a premeditated plan between Dr. Bonjour and SCP-████ due to their recently revealed shared past, but no evidence beyond gossip and conjecture. Dr. Bonjour requested the relief before it could be issued, stating \"I don't\n\n\"What did you find?\"\n\nYou snap the file shut and look up at the big bearded man standing above you, a quizzical and vaguely disappointed look on his face. You scramble up, messing the papers in the file up, fighting a blush as you hand it to him. \"I--it was on your desk, I was, um, dropping off the, uh.\"\n\n\"The 2118 papers, yes, thank you.\" He smoothly takes the file from you and puts it back on his desk, then goes to the tea table. \"Do you want to finish this? Looks like you hardly touched it.\"\n\n\"Uh, I think I'm just gonna...\" you trail off, backing towards the door. He sighs and pours some water into the teapot, swirling it around with practiced hands so it can be clean, shiny, new. You shouldn't ask. You have to ask. \"What happened?\"\n\nHe doesn't look at you as he says, \"I'm still not certain. They told me I asked for amnestics.\"\n\nYou wait for him to elaborate, and when he doesn't, you slip away, into the hall, closing the door with a 'click' behind you.
