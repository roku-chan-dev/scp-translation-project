CURRENTLY UNDER EMERGENCY REVISION]##\n\n##blue|All Foundation personnel stationed in the coastal regions of Chile, Peru and Ecuador are to evacuate immediately towards high ground (Emergency Level 5), assisting, if possible, the evacuation of civilians. This alert is extended to other Foundation personnel located in the coastal regions of the Pacific Ocean, including the United States of America, Canada, Japan, Southeast Asia, and Oceania.##\n\n##blue|Given the current predictive model, Foundation personnel are to prepare to enact the Ennui Protocol if SCP-4568-2 continues its activity unimpeded. Countermeasures to prevent a GK-Class \"Hostile Greenhouse\" Scenario are ongoing.##\n\n**Description:** ##red|[EMERGENT BEHAVIOR DETECTED. CURRENTLY UNDER EMERGENCY REVISION]##\n\n[PREVIOUS DESCRIPTION UNCHANGED -- COLLAPSED]\n\n**Emergency Addendum 4568-2:** Current predictive models for SCP-4568 indicated an anticipated period of high activity starting at around 25/02/2010 and estimated to result in high seismic activity (with a magnitude nearing 7 M,,w,,). As the Extraordinary Special Containment Procedures proposal by Senior Researcher Carreño was approaching completion, O5 Command approved the enactement of such procedures in order to prevent the loss of civilian life. These procedures were enacted on 24/02/2010.\n\nWhile the memetic injection failed to fully neutralize SCP-4568, it succeeded in temporarily incapacitating it, rendering it unconscious for around eight hours. Upon recovering consciousness, SCP-4568 initiated a series of small but continuous tremors following a specific pattern; analysis by Foundation cryptologists and linguists determined it to be an attempt at comunication via a binary encoding of Mapudungun[[footnote]]A language spoken by some native populations of Southern Chile and Central Argentina, particularly those of Mapuche or Huilliche ancestry.[[/footnote]] similar to Morse code. An approximate translation of the message is as follows:\n\n> Humans who call themselves \"Fundación\": [[[SCP-2217|Are you a Foundation for life?]]] If so, please let me complete my mission. Horror lies deep in the sea, fueled by fear and twisted righteousness. What I do is the only way to stop him. I regret the lives lost to me every day, but these bounds will bring death tenfold in the end. It is the only way.\n\nNo action was taken upon decoding the above message, and thus SCP-4568 remained partially incapacitated. At around 21:00 on 26/02/2010, while the debate regarding the interpretation of this message was still ongoing, Foundation personnel received automated alerts of significant anomalous oceanic activity along the Pacific Coast. Subsequently, a massive serpentine entity (provisionally designated SCP-4568-2) apparently composed of water and unidentifiable biological material emerged near Chiloé, Chile, causing a large-scale disruption in oceanic patterns. Further analysis indicated that SCP-4568-2's activity, if allowed to continue unimpeded, would result in devastating tsunamis affecting several coastal settlements along the Pacific Ocean and resulting in extreme loss of life and a possible BK-Class Broken Masquerade Scenario (90% confidence), followed by a GK-Class Hostile Greenhouse Scenario (60% confidence).\n\nWith an unanimous 13-0 vote, the O5 Council decided to administer a countermeme to SCP-4568. Following this, the following message was received:\n\n> I am very, very sorry. This is the only way.\n\n**Emergency Addendum 4568-3:** At around 3:34 on 27/02/2010, an earthquake of magnitude 8.8 M,,w,, was registered in coastal Chile. Foundation emergency protocols have been initiated.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#c2f2f2; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4568/offset/0 < Previous revision]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4568/offset/2 Next revision >]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]",
