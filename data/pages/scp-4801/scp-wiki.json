keycard activated door is installed on the staircase leading towards SCP‑4801. Only Foundation employees with Level 2 clearance are allowed entry. The basement containing SCP‑4801 is retrofitted to a standard Caution-Class Containment Chamber with constant remote surveillance. \n\nTesting of SCP‑4801 is approved to any employees with Level 3 clearance following a protocol review from SCP‑4801 Lead Researcher, Dr. Gary Lark. \n\nWhen testing is not in progress, two Scranton Reality Anchors (SRA) are placed within five meters of SCP-4801's doors. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"description\"]]\n[[div]]\n[[div_ class=\"scp-image-container\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"scp-image-block\"]]\n[[image scp-4801.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div_ class=\"scp-image-caption\"]]\nSCP‑4801 in its \"welcoming\" state.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP‑4801 is a freight elevator of unknown make and model within the storage basement of the Lewis Apartment Buildings in New York City, NY. In comparison to the state of the Lewis Apartment Buildings, SCP‑4801 is in an advanced state of disrepair and shows extensive use. Additionally, SCP‑4801 is not included in any known blueprints for the building.\n\nUnder all known current standards for cognizance, SCP‑4801 is considered sentient, capable of reasoning and thought. This property is not apparent from the exterior of SCP‑4801 and can only be observed from its interior.\n\nWhen a human subject enters SCP‑4801, it will often engage in conversation. If more than one individual enters, it will converse with only one subject while the others will not observe the anomalous behavior at all.[[span class=\"footnote_block one\"]][[span class=\"footnote_num\"]]1[[/span]][[span class=\"footnote_content\"]]With the exception of the chosen individual appearing to speak to themselves.[[/span]][[/span]] This is not believed to be due to SCP‑4801 using any degree of mental manipulation as recordings can still detect SCP‑4801's voice if attached to the chosen individual. Though not fully understood, it's believed that this occurs via use of focused, directional audio using manipulation of SCP-4801's four speakers contained within its walls at each corner of its interior.  \n\nIn addition to SCP‑4801's perceived sentience, it also displays some degree of reality altering ability, often conveying information that appears to be related to future events. However, multiple measurements of Hume levels surrounding SCP‑4801 have shown a lowering in Hume levels when these precognitive statements occur. As such, it is understood that SCP‑4801 is likely altering reality to its words rather than predicting future events. Further testing is still needed to confirm this.\n\nWhile under Foundation observation, SCP‑4801 has only been shown to function as an elevator four times. Despite being within the Lewis Apartment Building, subjects within SCP‑4801 during these events are taken to an unknown location where an unknown being resides [SCP-4801-β.] //[[See Test Log #29]]//\n\nSCP‑4801 refers to itself as //\"A.J.

These states with Foundation given names are as follows:\n\n* **Red State:** Both doors closed[[span class=\"footnote_block four\"]][[span class=\"footnote_num\"]]4[[/span]][[span class=\"footnote_content\"]]Not possible to force open doors.[[/span]][[/span]], presumed red-lit interior[[span class=\"footnote_block five\"]][[span class=\"footnote_num\"]]5[[/span]][[span class=\"footnote_content\"]]Red hued light can be observed between the closed doors.[[/span]][[/span]], attitude unknown\n* **Empty State:** Both doors open, unlit interior, attitude unknown[[span class=\"footnote_block six\"]][[span class=\"footnote_num\"]]6[[/span]][[span class=\"footnote_content\"]]SCP‑4801 is unresponsive in this state.[[/span]][[/span]]\n* **Threatening State:** Doors partially open, yellow-lit interior, furious attitude[[span class=\"footnote_block seven\"]][[span class=\"footnote_num\"]]7[[/span]][[span class=\"footnote_content\"]]This state appears to be identical to the \"Testing State.\" However, if any subject attempts to enter through the partially open doors, they will close instantly, terminating the subject.[[/span]][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"discovery\"]]\nOn March 13, 2019 Mobile Task Force Gamma-5 //(\"Red Herrings\")// detected the possibility of an anomalous object being discussed within a private chat shared between four tenants of The Lewis apartment building. The Anomalous Object Spider (AOS) sent an alert when the tenants displayed an unusual degree of \"obsessive behavior\" towards SCP‑4801. \n\nTenants had discovered SCP‑4801 three months prior to detection and had begun to utilize its apparent precognitive abilities. It is unknown to what degree the three tenants have gained advantages using these abilities.\n\nSoon after detection, Gamma-5 was activated and sent to contain the spread of SCP‑4801's anomalous behavior. Class B Amnetics were administered to all known affected individuals and containment procedures were put in to effect.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n++ Relevant SCP-4801 Testing Logs Collection\n\n[[div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Early Testing:** SCP-4801 states have been retroactively added to these early test logs as states were initially unknown.

You only lose what you cling to and so you find yourself within new skin. Feel it shed away, growing anew. Flesh on flesh. Bone on bone. Chew on your tongue. Weeze through your lung.\n\n**D-3MQ1:** //[Loud squelching sounds followed by loud crying.]// Oh... fuck wha-- please... get me out... this is so fuckin' wrong. it's all wrong.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Demi, turn that thing off. We don't need a log of a D-class sobbing.\n\n**Dr. Miles:** Right... Yes, sir.\n\n//<End Log>//\n\n------\n\n**Post Log Notes:** Following Test 11, Raisa Causality Retainment Databases //(RCRdb)// detected an attack on the Foundation's Perpetual Entanglement Data Register //(PEDR)//. Raisa staff have commenced a causal cross-reference scan and will compile a report once completed. In the meantime, I have suggested an increase of SCP-4801's Disruption Class to Keneq. I believe SCP-4801's reality altering ability extends farther than originally believed.\n\nAdditionally, I have resubmitted my request for a third research team member. This anomaly clearly shows more significant danger than originally believed. This request was initially denied on grounds of allegedly having a third member already. This was found to be due to a database error and a third research member has been assigned.\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"➕ Show Test Log #29 ➕\" hide=\"➖ Hide Test Log #29 ➖\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n**Test Log #:** 29\n**SCP-4801 State:** Welcoming\n**Test Subject:** MTF Sigma-22 (\"Prey Dogs\") Primary Team\n**Testing Notes:** At last, MTF testing has been approved. To finally have test subjects that are familiar and comfortable with test protocol... well, my informal notes here are likely testament to how pleased I am. I think the preliminary Raisa Report may have alerted the higher-ups of the potential danger of this anomaly. The numerous database errors following test 11 were particularly alarming.\n\nAdditionally, Sigma-22 specializes in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-es-100 Elevator-based anomalies], which I was not aware were common enough to have their own MTF. I'm not particularly surprised.\n\nThe goal of today's testing is to further question SCP-4801 as to its motivations and goals. Sigma-22 is outfitted with portable Scranton Reality Anchors, though it is known they're not always as effective. It is our hope that they will be enough to halt SCP-4801's abilities. What those abilities are--Clearly some measure of reality altering but to what degree? With a few more tests, I believe we can answer that question.\n\nWe are outfitting the MTF members with body cameras for further testing as well.\n\n------\n\n//<Begin Audio Log>//\n**Dr. Lark:** //[Clears throat]// Begin log: Test number 29. This will be the first test involving MTF Sigma-22, also known as the \"Prey Dogs.\" I'm joined by Dr. Demi Miles and, our newest addition, Dr. Zoë Palme.\n\n**Dr. Palme:** Happy to be here, sir. \n\n//[MTF Sigma-22 (\"Prey Dogs\") is finishing gearing up into standard Caution-Class tactical gear within the testing chamber.]//\n\n**S22-1:** Dr. Lark, right? I finished briefing my men. //[Pulls on a strip of Velcro to tighten it]// Identify yourselves. Mouthfuls for the record and what we'll actually be calling you lot.\n\n**S22-2:** Sigma-22 Dos, here, sir. I usually go by Dos.\n\n**S22-3:** Sigma-22 Three, reporting for the record. You can just call me Three.\n\n**S22-1:** And Sigma-22 One here. Just call me Op.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Op, Dos, and Three... alright. Got it. Can you repeat back the protocol?\n\n**S22-1:** Understood, sir. We are to approach the anomalous elevator, enter it together, and then report. Additionally, a number of questions are to be asked. If the Hume Detection System goes off, we are to begin extraction.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Excellent. Are you three prepared, then?\n\n**S22-1:** Yes, sir. We begin on your call.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Demi, Zoë, anything before we begin?\n\n**Dr. Miles:** Not that I can think of.\n\n**Dr. Palme:** Same here. I believe that's it. //[Pauses]// It appears SCP-4801 is in its... Welcoming state. Wide open and brightly lit. Should be safe, right?\n\n**Dr. Miles:** //[Chuckles]// Presumably. \n\n**Dr. Lark:** Very good. Op, you and your team can begin.\n\n//[Op nods and motions for the other two men to follow. The group approaches SCP-4801 and enter without incident.]//\n\n**S22-1:** Dr. Lark, initial report: no cause for concern can be observed.\n\n**SCP-4801:** //[Audio picked up on S22-2's mic.]// A group of three, how unusual. It is... you to whom I most agree.\n\n**S22-2:** //[Clear's throat]// Uh, Dos reporting. I can hear a voice... difficult to tell if feminine or masculine. Op, Three, do you copy?\n\n**S22-3:** Nothing. Silence for me.\n\n**S22-1:** Yeah, only silence. \n\n**Dr. Lark:** We are picking up additional audio only on Dos' mic. You are the first group to enter at once so this was unexpected. Dos, please continue following protocol.\n\n**SCP-4801:** That one with the name like a bird, always on the outside and I do //so// wish to have a word.\n\n**S22-2:** Right... uh, A.J. yes? Are you talking about Dr. Lark?\n\n**SCP-4801:** I am, young one. The caged bird will not run.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** //[To Dr. Miles]// SCP-4801 appears to be threatening me.\n\n**SCP-4801:** Threat? No. I only do not forget.\n\n**S22-2:** //[Clears throat]// So, err, why am I the only one that can hear you?\n\n//[Op and Three take position in the rear corners of the elevator as Dos stands in the center.]//\n\n**SCP-4801:** Enlightenment can only be given and my assistance is at its prime when I say so.

Apologies. Uh, Dos, that was a slight dip in Hume levels... //[Shuffling of papers]// That is the first instance of SCP-4801 being incorrect. Isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Miles:** Yes, sir. We do not have any records of SCP-4801 ever being incorrect in its observations.\n\n**S22-1:** SRAs are doing their job, then, eh?  \n\n**SCP-4801:** I see, how strange. You come not as a devotee. \n\n//[A bell chimes within the elevator]// \n\n**Dr. Palme:** That sounded on all mics, sir.\n\n**S22-1:** Yeah, heard a... ding of some sort. Dos, what is it saying?\n\n**S22-2:** Uh, it almost sounds... disappointed, sir.\n\n**S22-3:** Well, that makes two of us. //[Chuckles quietly.]//\n\n**SCP-4801:** I must make a request. If it is not too much, could your companions, who are clearly a bright bunch, vacate my interior? That would really be the best for all of us.\n\n**S22-2:** Uh, not sure. I really don't think so.\n\n//[Elevator lurches in place, shifting up and down.]//\n\n**S22-1:** Dr. Lark, the documents did not mention the elevator moving.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** It... never has before. Zoë, Dr. Palme, how are the Hume levels looking?\n\n**Dr. Palme:** Nothing to report, sir. Completely normal.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Dos, refuse its request. I don't believe trusting it is in our best interest.\n\n//[Elevator lurches once again followed by alarms beginning to blare]//\n\n**Dr. Palme:** Wha--\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Team, get out of there!\n\n//[Alarms continue to blare. The portable SRAs release puffs of smoke, followed by a burst of sparks.]//\n\n//[Sigma-22 attempts to exit the elevator, but SCP-4801 closes its doors, trapping the operatives inside.]//\n\n**SCP-4801:** A sad lot, you three are. Answering to polite requests will really get you far. But I am kind and I am wise. Today I will lift you from your pathetic existence as experimental flies and soon we shall arise. Important, strong, respected you are. Hidden within is the truth. I will take you there.\n\n**Dr. Palme:** Sir, I... the Hume levels. These will overwhelm the portable anchors.\n\n**Dr. Lark:** Yes, I see tha--\n\n//[A secondary alarm chimes, overlapping the first. The research team's voices become difficult to hear.]//\n\n**Dr. Lark:** //[Shouting]// We need to evacuate! Shit, this isn't good! Come on!\n\n//[Research team evacuates observation chamber as SCP-4801 lurches, rising within its shaft.]//\n\n**S22-3:** //[Voice is muffled and indistinct.]// Oh-- that... that feels really... uuh, wait... Op, yeah?\n\n**S22-1:** //[Voice also displays a distinct warbling sound.]// Wh--what? Oh, r-right, yes. Yes. Op. Op. Op. What is it again? Op, Dos, Three?\n\n//[Without warning, S22-2 bends over and vomits on the ground. All cameras display an amount of visual distortion, though no objects within frame are physically displaced. The other two men appear uneasy on their feet and begin touching their tactical gear, as if unfamiliar. The tactical gear is stained a bright orange color which slowly returns to black. A forth figure wearing D-Class garb and lying prostrate on the left side of the carriage appears for a few seconds before sinking through the floor. ]// \n\n**S22-2:** Oh... //[Heaves and vomits more.]// This is all wrong.

The other side is dark and featureless until long tube lights on the ceiling switch on. Presumably fluorescent, they take a few moments to reach full brightness. The lights illuminate a dirt path with jet black voids on either side. The lights themselves are attached to a ceiling made of painted red beams suspended in the air.]//\n\n**S22-1:** Begin observation protocol, men. No response from base so it's only us.
