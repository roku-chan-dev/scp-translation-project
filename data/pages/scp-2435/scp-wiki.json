Both are to be contained inside separate secure vacuum containment chambers at Site-19. SCP-2435-1 and SCP-2435-2 are not to come in physical contact with each other and should be stored a minimum of 1 km apart.\n\nAn emergency inspection for any damage to SCP-2435-1 and SCP-2435-2's containment cubes and chambers should be carried out as soon as possible following any earthquake or explosion within 10 km of containment. If the containment measures for SCP-2435-1 or SCP-2435-2 show signs of damage, maintenance personnel are to make immediate repairs.\n\nDaily video inspection of containment cubes is sufficient for otherwise normal circumstances.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2435-1 (formerly SCP-2435) is a 1.017 cubic meter block of empty space. Almost all matter that attempts to occupy the same space as SCP-2435-1 is absorbed into SCP-2435-1. SCP-2435-1 expands as it consumes matter, at an equivalent growth ratio of .1 milligram to 1 gram of matter absorbed.\n\nPhotons along the electromagnetic spectrum from 400 THz to 890 THz appear immune to SCP-2435-1's properties, and are able to pass freely through the space it occupies.\n\nCopper is absorbed at a significantly delayed rate compared to other forms of matter. SCP-2435-1 consumes copper at a 6% efficiency rate compared to 100% efficiency for all other matter entering the space SCP-2435-1 occupies. In effect this renders SCP-2435-1 a solid object when touched by copper, and allows for movement and manipulation of SCP-2435-1 with copper-lined instruments safely. SCP-2435-1’s growth can only be prevented with a pure vacuum environment, but can be slowed and restricted with proper copper shielding.\n\nDespite operationally acting as a void, SCP-2435-1 does not produce a consistent or strong vacuum force. A weak vacuum force has been observed at irregular intervals lasting an average of 5 minutes and 34 seconds, with the longest record incident lasting 3 hours and shortest incident lasting 8 seconds. Time between incidents has been recorded as low as 4 minutes and as long as 213 days.\n\nSCP-2435-1 appears to be gravitationally locked to Earth, but is acted upon by gravity at a significantly weaker and irregular rate. It is estimated that if positioned 2 meters above the ground, SCP-2435-1 will slowly descend for 445 days before making contact with the ground. However despite this prolonged period above the Earth, the geographic location of SCP-2435-1 changes in response to the moment of the planet, remaining at a fixed location following planetary rotation.\n\nSCP-2435-2 is a 0.12 cubic meter block of empty space. SCP-2435-2 exhibits nearly all the same anomalous properties of SCP-2435-1. However, in testing SCP-2435-2 it was discovered to be able to consume copper with 100% efficiency, unlike SCP-2435-1. SCP-2435-2 consumes silver at 6% efficiency, resulting in the same effect as copper on SCP-2435-1.\n\n**Incident 2435-A:** (3-5-████) SCP-2435-1 was discovered by automated Foundation programs monitoring numerous online auction sites. SCP-2435-1 was pinged as potentially anomalous after programs correctly identified the seller as █████ ████████, a known independent provider of anomalous materials.\n\nSCP-2435-1 was advertised as a “custom hack” of the popular video game ████████ ████ █, featuring “immersive gameplay, an ever-expanding experience with live service content updates, and community driven expansions.” Foundation systems were unable to intervene before purchase and delivery of SCP-2435-1 to 16-year-old Malcolm Smith.\n\nProcurement Specialists were deployed to the home of Smith, who was found with severe wounds to [DATA EXPUNGED]. Smith was approved for reconstruction surgery and amnesticized. Further monitoring is ongoing.\n\nSCP-2435-1 was found contained in a handmade copper cage measuring .1520 meters on all sides. Procurement Specialist Hays injured right index finger while retrieving SCP-2435-1.\n\nDespite efforts, █████ ████████ could not be detained, although the selling account was subsequently suspended for poor reviews and indecent customer service.\n\n**Incident 2435-B:** (9-17-████) During a breach in containment of SCP-███ at Site-19, 6 D-Class personnel attempted to hide from Foundation personnel in SCP-2435-1's containment chamber. SCP-2435-1 was not under current containment procedures, and was instead placed on a copper platform in the center of a hermetically sealed vacuum chamber for testing. \n\nD-Class were able to gain access to SCP-2435-1's containment chamber after manually engaging emergency pressurization systems. While attempting to distance themselves from pursuing Foundation personnel, D-19098 ran into SCP-2435-1 and was consumed. The remaining 5 D-Class were recaptured and reassigned.\n\nContainment Procedure revision proposed in response to Incident 2435-B.\n\n**Incident 2435-C:** (9-12-████) D-19098 spontaneously reappeared in SCP-2435-1's containment chamber in a delirious state. D-19098 expired from asphyxiation within 2 minutes of emerging from SCP-2435-1 due to the absence of oxygen in SCP-2435-1's containment chamber. Medical personnel attempted to resuscitate D-19098 but were unsuccessful. \n\nDuring autopsy of D-19098, researchers noted D-19098 was suffering symptoms of extreme copper deficiency, as well as the removal of D-19098's tongue, digestive tract, and [REDACTED], resulting in discovery of SCP-2435-2. Upon further examination, a series of numbers was discovered carved into the underside of D-19098's rib bones, appearing to be a message in binary. Upon translation, this message read \"You Lose. Try Again?\"\n\nFollowing the return of D-19098, revision of SCP-2435-1’s Containment Procedures was implemented.\n\n**Incident 2435-D:** (12-24-████) 2 D-Class personnel were instructed to attempt to return SCP-2435-2 into SCP-2435-1. This resulted in a spontaneous release of energy as SCP-2435-1 and SCP-2435-2 came in contact. \n\nThe discharge of energy caused power failures throughout Site-19. Within 30 seconds of exposure to each other, SCP-2435-1 and SCP-2435-2 created a vacuum effect significantly stronger than previous incidents at their point of impact. SCP-2435-1 and SCP-2435-2 were later measured to have undergone a temporary and unprecedented increase in their growth speeds. \n\nD-17839, the D-Class handling SCP-2435-1, was unable to resist the vacuum pull and was consumed entirely by SCP-2435-1. D-18987 was able to remove SCP-2435-2 from contact with SCP-2435-1, which eliminated the vacuum effect. Power outages across Site-19 were restored within 2 hours. To date, D-17839 has not emerged from SCP-2435-1.\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2434]]] | SCP-2435 | [[[SCP-2436]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
