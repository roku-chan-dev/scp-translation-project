Can somebody clear this up? Not urgent from my perspective, but it might be for people on the containment team. I'd appreciate a heads up when resolved so I can finish my review.\n> **Response:**\n>> The SCP-7684 page is functioning as intended, but your operational requirement is insufficient to view it. Please consult your security representative.\n> **Ticket Status:** CLOSED\n\n> **Ticket:** #O5981A2\n> **Date Filed:** 15 NOV 2058\n> **Importance:** Medium\n> **Subject:** SCP-7684 Page Not Pulling from PAGEANT\n> **Content:**\n>> The main SCP-7684 file continues displaying 'OP-REQ INSUFFICIENT' when viewed from any terminal. I consulted my DSEC, and she claims I am good to see scrubbed summaries of everything mainline. Can you confirm that accesses are being validated in PAGEANT? Others on my team had the same issue when double checking.\n> **Response:**\n>> PAGEANT is not certified for processing SCP-7684 accesses. Please consult your security representative to identify proper channels.\n> **Ticket Status:** CLOSED\n\n> **Ticket:** #9UU351K\n> **Date Filed:** 03 DEC 2058\n> **Importance:** Medium\n> **Subject:** SCP-7684 Page Not Pulling from PAGEANT - V2\n> **Content:**\n>> Refer to ticket #O5981A2 for context. My security representative cannot identify the correct system for validating SCP-7684 access. Can you direct me to the proper system/point of contact/etc.? This is getting a little silly even for this place.\n> **Response:**\n>> This tool is not certified to handle that information.

Not to start a pissing contest, but this is pursuant to a direct tasking from the Deputy Assistant Director for Research and Development (NA).

It isn't PAGEANT apparently, and it doesn't seem to be the TELTAK either based on shouting from my DSEC's office.

What if somebody's life was at risk? The Deputy Assistant Director will be submitting a document request so we can complete these analyses without any extra nonsense.
