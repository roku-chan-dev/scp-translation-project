Following confirmation of SCP-6884-related origin, Mobile Task Force Gamma-4 (“Green Stags”) are to be dispatched in an attempt to terminate or capture the wild instance for long term housing and study at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 |Site-44]]]’s Cryptozoological Research Wing.\n\n In the event that the sighted instance is unable to be located, seismic imaging should be utilised to locate any unnaturally occurring cave systems in the region. Upon discovery, Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 (“Mole Rats”) are to enter these caverns in order to pursue the fleeing SCP-6884 instance or uncover an SCP-6884 brood.\n\n[[include component:image-block \n| name= http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/ozzylizard-2/BigCatsUK\n| caption= An amateur flier referencing SCP-6884.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6884 is an unidentified subterranean species of mammal bearing resemblance to members of the genus //Panthera// [[footnote]] Colloquially known as big cats. [[/footnote]] while possessing some characteristics of the //Caniformia// [[footnote]] An order containing dogs, wolves and foxes. [[/footnote]] suborder. \n\nThe species’ primary anomalous quality is the ability to forcibly create caverns and fissures in rock, often resulting in lengthy passageways and cave systems with which to reside within and raise young. This capability appears to necessitate a significant amount of energy from SCP-6884 and hence is used sparingly, usually as a flight response. It is believed that SCP-6884 instances spend around half of their life within caves, emerging only to hunt during nocturnal hours; a lifestyle likely responsible for their primarily black colouration. Once on the surface, instances are likely to consume sheep or infant cattle alongside collecting resources to construct elaborate dens. Predation upon human subjects remains incredibly rare, with only 3 reported attacks since 1990.\n\nSCP-6884’s population size is undetermined, though is believed to comprise of at least 150 individual members spread across Britain. While the species remains at large, their low frequency, generally elusive nature and the ease of public containment efforts has resulted in a Euclid classification level as opposed to other alternatives. [[footnote]] Now pending reclassification following Incident 6884-Alpha. [[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Folkloric Significance:**\nEncounters with large cats in Britain date back to around 1,000BC, whereby Celtic warriors and farmers shared tales of supposed battles with SCP-6884 broods that would steal young rams from their flocks. Over time, Celtic inhabitation of the British Isles saw a purging of the species’ numbers due to their threat posed to livestock and may be the reason for development of their reclusive nature.\n\nIn the modern era, the majority of surviving instances are situated in the South of England, with 676 reported sightings in the county of Devon between 2004 and 2005. SCP-6884 is most commonly known for its heavy presence in Bodmin Moor, Dartmoor, Exmoor and Mossmoor respectively; this distribution has been attributed to the aforementioned areas’ limestone-based rock composition which is softer and hence easier to manipulate than typical stone while maintaining the integrity to support lengthy cave systems. Public belief of SCP-6884 is widespread in their inhabited areas, though due to the species’ outwardly non-anomalous nature and tendency to flee once sighted, this has not been deemed a threat to secrecy or the Veil at large. \n\n**Addendum 6884.1:** Investigation \nAlthough the Foundation suspected the presence of an anomalous big cat species in Britain since the 1970s due to their heavy presence in local culture, SCP-6884’s existence was only proved in late 2011 in an investigation prompted by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cryptozoology-division-hub|Cryptozoology Division]]]. Following approval, a pair of Site-44 agents were dispatched to assess the validity of claims surrounding SCP-6884. The results of the investigation can be found in the following: \n\n[[collapsible show=\"POI Interview 6884 “Alpha”\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 20/05/2011\n\n**Location:** The Black Ram Pub, Mossmoor, Somerset\n\n**Interviewed:** POI-6884-1, Chris P. Fisher (Local Farmer)\n\n**Interviewer(s):** Agent Carter & Operative Johnson\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview as conducted in-person at The Black Ram, a popular local pub and inn. Unaware of the proceeding conversation prior, A. Carter and O. Johnson had been tracking Mr Fisher for weeks prior in the belief that he had encountered an SCP-6884 in his past.\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//Mr Fisher is sat at a table at the edge of the bar, alone, staring at a collection of photos on the wall. Carter and Johnson enter equipped with convert audio recording equipment.//\n\n**A. Carter:** Hi! Are you Chris? \n\n**POI-6884-1:** Uh, yeah. Do you need something?\n\n**A. Carter:** Only if you’re free at the moment.\n\n**POI-6884-1:** I’m free. \n\n**A. Carter:** Great. Me and my associate are currently working on the production of a documentary surrounding British legends and folklore. We’ve been speaking to some locals and, well, we were wondering if you’d help us with any insight into a local cryptid story?\n\n//POI-6884-1 remains silent for several seconds.//\n\n**POI-6884-1:** Um, sure. What exactly is it that you’re interested in?\n\n**A. Carter:** We’re researching rumours of a… unique species of panther in England.\n\n//POI-6884-1 again falls silent, seemingly in thought.//\n\n**POI-6884-1:** Who told you to come to me about this?\n\n**O. Johnson:** That’s irrelevant. Many eye witness reports claim to sight the creatures, only to seemingly disappear when visual contact is lost — even for a moment.\n\n**A. Carter:** I wouldn’t expect any payment if you won’t talk.\n\n//Agent Carter gestures to a briefcase.//\n\n**POI-6884-1:** Fine. (//Heavily sighs//) It was 3 years ago, I’d just gone to Mossmoor market to pick up some animal feed, new equipment, stuff like that. I was in my pickup truck heading back to the farm and it was late evening so visibility wasn’t great but wasn’t terrible. To get back to my farm I had to drive along some rural roads, past the moorland just south of here, and I’d just turned off when I looked to my left.\n\nIt was right there; out on the moor. Clear as days. A gigantic… black animal in the distance. (//Stutters//) I had no idea what I was seeing. It didn’t even move, just watched my truck. I looked at it and… it looked back at me with… those luminous yellow eyes. I sat there utterly dumbfounded, or terrified, until I passed a hedgerow and when I looked back it’d gone in an instant. (//Sighs//) I stopped the truck and walked to the spot where it was. Saw a trail of footprints leading to that area, but nothing leading away. Don’t think I left my property for weeks after that.\n\n**A. Carter:** Intriguing. Have you had any other encounters with big cats?\n\n**POI-6884-1:** Oh, (//Chuckles//) I wouldn’t call it a cat. It’s body was feline, yes, but it’s head was more like that of a dog’s — and it’s eyes were… something else entirely.\n\n**A. Carter:** If you don’t mind me asking, wh-\n\n**POI-6884-1:** (//Trembling slightly//) I don’t want to talk anymore. You wanted me to tell you everything I know, and there it was.\n\n//They sit in silence for one minute before POI-6884-1 speaks.//\n\n**POI-6884-1:** (//Points at a collection of photos on the wall//) You see that? Second from the left. Look closer at the hedgerow. \n\n//The photograph depicts an expansive pasture in Devon, surrounded by light woodland. A dark shape is visible bordering the farthest hedgerow.//\n\n**POI-6884-1:** That image was taken by Charles Wilford in 1998. He lives near Dartmoor National Park. If you want more information, I suggest you speak to him.\n\n**A. Carter:** Thank you for your cooperation, Mr Fisher.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"POI Interview 6884 “Bravo”\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 25/05/2011\n\n**Location:** Wilford Manor, Dartmoor, Devon\n\n**Interviewed:** POI-6884-2, Charles Wilford \n\n**Interviewer(s):** Agent Carter & Operative Johnson\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted at the personal estate of Charles Wilford due to belief that he had experience with SCP-6884 formerly.\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n(//Agent Carter rings the estate’s doorbell//)\n\n**O. Johnson:** How old is this guy?\n\n**A. Carter:** 67.\n\n**O. Johnson:** (//Gesturing to the manor//) Where’d he make his fortune?\n\n**A. Carter:** Officially, sailing and eventually the boat manufacturing industry according to the Foundation’s database, but we suspect some exploitation of offshore bank accounts in his younger years.\n\n**O. Johnson:** I see. No one checked up on it?\n\n**A. Carter:** No, we need to keep good relations with this guy. He’s useful for sourcing information and resources for the Naval Divisio-\n\n//The front door opens, POI-6884-2 steps out.//\n\n**POI-6884-2:** He-llooo! Who might you be?\n\n**A. Carter:** Hello there! We’re actually agents from local law enforcement and we just want to ask you some questions. Don’t worry, you’re not in any trouble.\n\n**O. Johnson:** (//Quietly, out of earshot//) Yet.\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Oh, marvellous. Please step inside and get out of the rain! How do you take your tea?\n\n//Both agents enter the manor where POI-6884-2 directs them to a room containing chairs and tables to rest.

Um, is it okay if we begin the interview now please?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Yes, yes I do apologise, I’m holding you up. What do you want to know?\n\n**A. Carter:** We’re just conducting an investigation into some strange ongoings in the local area.\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Ah, I’m afraid you’ll have to be more specific.\n\n**A. Carter:** We’ve had a surplus of accounts of a… well… big cat of sorts loose in the surrounding counties. \n\n//POI-6884-2 appears surprised and excited.//\n\n**A. Carter:** We spoke to a guy in Mossmoor last week and he implied that you’d have some connection to the case. We’re just trying to find some leads.\n\n**POI-6884-2:** (//Chuckles//) Yes, I was wondering when the Government would finally take my claims seriously! I must say I’ve become rather fascinated by the Beast in my latter years.\n\n**O. Johnson:** The Beast?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Yes, The Beast of Bodmin Moor, Beast of Exmoor, Puma of Galloway, Phantom Cat of Mossmoor — The Big Cat of Dartmoor. Real anomalies these things.\n\n**A. Carter:** (//Chuckles//) Yeah. We wanted to know if you’ve ever… maybe seen one yourself?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Oh, yes a few times actually; we’ve got what I suspect to be a breeding pair in Dartmoor based on… well, only my own suspicions admittedly, but it’s the only explanation for why they’ve been here so long.\n\n**O. Johnson:** Do you have anything to support your claims? \n\n**A. Carter:** Our source from Mossmoor showed us a photo you took in 1998 that he reckoned caught one of the cats in a field nearby here.\n\n**POI-6884-2:** Oh, yes, I do like to dabble in photography every now and again! I’ve got (//Stutters//) maybe six or seven photos of the cats. Mostly blurry mind you, but there’s a couple of decent ones.\n\n**A. Carter:** Anything besides photos?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** No, unfortunately. The cats are like phantoms — light, fast and utterly silent in their movement and speech. It’s like chasing a shadow.\n\n**O. Johnson:** Speech?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** I’ve sat out in the field where I took that photograph you mentioned for months just waiting to hear any roar or growl that wasn’t from a car engine, but my attempts proved fruitless. I placed a um… (//Clicking of fingers and stuttering//) trail-cam microphone in my spot and left it alone. One night. That was it. 2AM, it picked up a frequency of around 18 hertz, just out of range of what I could hear. [[footnote]] The average human ear can register sound between 20 and 20,000 hertz. [[/footnote]] Best of all, there were replies. They were talking with each other.\n\n**A. Carter:** I see. Where exactly is this spot of high activity?\n\n**POI-6884-2:** It’s just past ███ █████, about a mile from the brook.\n\n**A. Carter:** Good to know. Thanks, Mr Wilford, you’ve been a great help. Oh, also you might want to expect a visit from some of our friends at Stan’s Cryptid Procurement, they’ll help piece this all together.

Johnson:** Think about it. It’s the late ice age and you’re a species of large cat that can’t get to mainland Europe anymore. After a while, these weird bipedal creatures start to visit; eventually they put two and two together and find out that you’re the one who’s been eating their sheep. Naturally, as we do, we defend our livestock.

The overhead helicopter illuminates the forest and fires neon-coloured darts towards the instance, striking its tail and allowing it to be more easily visible. While a squad of MTF Gamma-4 group with the agents, other operatives travel on either side in an attempt to instigate a horseshoe manoeuvre and surround the instance. The entity is semi-visible due to overhead lights and the containment team’s torches.//\n\n**A.
