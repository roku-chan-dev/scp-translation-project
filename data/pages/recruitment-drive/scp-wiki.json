In her right hand was clutched a bottle of //1950 Bordeaux// liberated from Sophia's pantry, contrasted with the crumpled slip of paper in her limp left hand. There were no signs of violence or intrusion into her home. But, inexplicably, she was staring at the unmoving body of an Overseer.\n\nMurder? Suicide? A trap? Sophia reached into her pants pocket, taking hold of the pepper-spray on her keychain, and slowly shut the door behind her with a soft //click//. She strode over to a panel on the wall and flipped a switch.\n\nLights ignited throughout the kitchen, and Ten's fist slammed down on the granite countertop. Her grip on the bottle was so strained Sophia worried the glass would shatter. Agonously, Ten raised her head, brushed aside a few intrusive strands of hair, and smiled at somewhere above Sophia's chin.\n\n\"Hello, Light. I was wondering when you'd be home.\"\n\nSophia nodded, shoving the pepper-spray back in her pocket. \"You're not dead, then?\"\n\n\"Of course I'm not dead; only thing that can kill an Overseer is another Overseer.\" Ten turned her attention to the wine in her hand, passing a hand over the neck indecisively.\n\nSophia scrutinized her from the kitchen's wall: tall, hunched over, dressed in a bizarre outfit of jeans and the top of a formal suit. It was all too much of a mess to be intentional. Ten might genuinely be in crisis, which would be even more terrifying than death.\n\n\"And sorry about the wine,\" Ten was saying. \"We're not allowed to drink our own stores for fear of poison.\"\n\n\"You're not a factotum, are you?\"\n\nTen's lip curled up, in an expression of equal disgust and anger. \"What reason could I possibly have to send my body-double to break into your home and drink your wine?\"\n\n\"What reason could you have to do it yourself?\"\n\nTen's lip lowered, and she glanced down at the paper in her left hand. Her fingers fidgeted over it, tracing a crease along its edge.\n\nSetting aside the bottle, Ten rose from behind the counter. Her expression seemed more sincere, suddenly, like she'd remembered something secret.\n\n\"Sophia. We haven't met before, properly — only through my factotum. In a roundabout way, you know who I am, but I've never talked with you before.\"\n\nTen extended a hand forward, suspended in the air for Sophia to accept. Her anxious face seemed softer in the new light.\n\n\"Hello, Director. I am O5-10, the creator of the Alpha-9 project. I hear you were almost killed last week, for acting under my orders, and I am very, very sorry.\"\n\nWithout taking her eyes off Ten, Sophia scanned the room for signs of reality-warping or hallucinations. None of the usual symptoms, unfortunately. So, she took Ten's hand in hers, and shook it. A little static //pop// stabbed her palm on contact.\n\n\"Hello, O5-10. I'm Sophia Light, leader of Alpha-9. What business brings you by this late?\"\n\nTen sighed, releasing her grasp on Sophia's hand. \"Classified business, Sophia. Bloody, confusing, end-of-the-world, classified business.\"\n\n\"But you wouldn't be here if I weren't cleared to know some of it.\"\n\nTen shrugged. \"Semantically, you can't be debriefed on an anomaly which doesn't exist.\"\n\n\"Semantically, if you can discuss it, you can be debriefed.\"\n\n\"I'll concede.\" Ten's lip curled upwards again. \"How much do you know about [[[SCP-2000]]]?\"\n\n\"It's an empty slot; has been forever. I take it that's our non-existent anomaly?\"\n\n\"Indeed.\" The toe of Ten's shoe tapped against Sophia's tile floor. \"See, we had a big facility out in Yellowstone that we used to save the world — very high-concept, very anomalous — but it was lost in an accident. [[[SCP-076]]] destroyed its primary component nine years ago.\"\n\nSophia raised an eyebrow at the reference to Able ben Adam. \"Before or after he slaughtered the rest of Omega-7?\"\n\n\"Immediately afterwards. The point is: SCP-2000 left our reality and took a few things with it. A few stray concepts, a couple questions which now have no answers, some far-flung stretches of history which probably never happened.\"\n\n\"And yet you've decided to debrief me on it.\"\n\nTen smiled grimly. \"Indeed. Spreading out from Yellowstone, we're seeing a plethora of anomalous activity which suggests causal and ontological breakdown. It's happening slowly, for now, but without our last-resort, the Council doesn't have the means to put it down for good.\"\n\n\"And I do?\"\n\nTen paused, look at her confusedly. There was a certain tremor in her eyes, Sophia realized — //uncertainty//.\n\nTen picked her words carefully. \"Sophia. You're the leader of Alpha-9, the reborn Omega-7. Your job is to combat the anomalous.\"\n\n\"Not with anyone I have on the team, currently. Do you have anyone you'd recommend?\"\n\nTen did not reply for a long while. Then, she broke out in a deep, toothy smile. She shoved the paper in her hand into her pocket and brushed past Sophia on the way to the door, actively covering her mouth with a hand to stifle a deep chuckle.\n\nSophia looked on in annoyance. \"Are you quite done?\"\n\nTen nodded, taking a moment to breathe in, and out, and relax.\n\n\"I am done. I have no list, Sophia; I trust you can handle that part yourself. Frankly, I wouldn't know where to start.\"\n\nWith that, Ten grabbed the knob of the door and pulled it open to the brisk night air.\n\n\"Ten.\"\n\nThe smile fell from Ten's lips. In its place came deep resignation, and sadness. \"Yes, Sophia?\"\n\n\"You seem troubled by something, other than the end of the world. Whatever it is, you'll get through it.\"\n\nTen stared out in the midnight dark. Her face was an olive mask, wiped clean of emotion. Then, she exhaled a cloud of frost into the night air and turned to face her.\n\n\"History does not agree with you, Light. The world's always been fucked up. And the people in power have just as many problems as you, which is why it's never going to get fixed.\"\n\nSophia nodded, stepping towards her counter to reshelve the half-empty //1950 Bordeaux//. \"Take care, then.\"\n\n\"You as well.

Messages would be delivered to invalid numbers and emails would be sent to incorrect addresses (meaning poor Carlotta Denesh in Accounting had received a distressing check-in from RAISA). Her address in the Foundation's employee database seemed to update daily, meaning snail mail was similarly unreliable.\n\n\"... Unfortunately, that number is not in service. Please call again.\"\n\n//Damn it.// Sophia shoved her phone into her front pocket. Her heels clicked against the tile of Site-81's colossal server room as she caught up with her guide.\n\n\"...

Site-19 gets up to an awful lot, and it starts to wear on you.\"\n\nLurk was a man who wore an Oxford shirt and slacks to a back-of-house IT job. Although he walked with a professionalism befitting someone in Light's position, his snow-white hair had a habit of standing directly upright. If you were getting to know him, you'd assume an electric current had run through his head just minutes prior.\n\nSophia nodded along and smiled at him, barely understanding his Scottish accent. She jerked her head at a server labeled \"Da – De\" and interjected, \"This her block?\"\n\n\"Yes, ma'am! Should be, anyways. So, you think she hacked in? Ha, that'd be a first.\"\n\nSophia frowned, and glanced down at her wrist before answering. //11:30. Already running late.//\n\n\"That remains to be seen. Can you open it up, Lurk?\"\n\nHer guide's voice dropped a pitch. \"It's Dietrich, ma'am. And yes, I can open her.\"\n\nSophia nodded and stepped back, watching as Lurk's fingers scraped at the sides of the rack. They pressed down on the sides of the metal grate, delicately removing the outer shell and revealing a  large, black-tinted screen.\n\nDietrich rapped his knuckles against the glass. \"Hey Alex!

They were thousands of meters below Russia's capital, surrounded by vast stone structures and walls. She and Michail were in the center of the Colosseum, where the Black Lodge spectated its bloodsport. Looking around at the blurry darkness, she noted that the building was beginning to feel familiar — both watching from its stands, and fighting in its center.\n\n\"You were a real monster out there,\" Michail said, meaning it to be a compliment.

There were a few lab-coated employees who ducked inside buildings at the sight of her arrival, but only those in the motor pool tolerated her proximity.

Sophia had a room number and enough time to trial-and-error her way through the facility, walking through sterile hallways and down inscrutable stairwells until she found her mark. She could ask for assistance from the site's employees, of course — but again, that strange distance, that subtle fear. Sophia thought it best to walk on her own.\n\nEventually, she located the room; not in a containment wing, to her initial confusion, but in the medical ward. On the placard of the wooden door were embossed the words \"Temporary Asset Care\". Sophia pushed down the questions rising to her mind's surface, and twisted the door's handle.\n\nHer eyes drifted from the large medical cot in the center of the room, to the young man comatose within it, and then to the terrified woman standing beside him.\n\n\"Oh god.\" The woman's eyes widened with horror before she turned her head away. She grabbed a collection of papers resting on the table next to the cot and made for the door. \"I came in here for an intake form! Heading out now.\"\n\nSophia let the door shut behind her with a //click//.

Well, I guess you wouldn't know; Management tends to reassign people who start looking into Rainer's... situation\"\n\nSophia raised an eyebrow at that. \"Do they give any particular reason?\"\n\nJules shrugged. \"I haven't been reassigned, so if they do, I wouldn't know.\"\n\n\"The lack of transparency doesn't seem ideal.\"\n\n\"Well, when you've got a hammer.\" Jules began fidgeting with the papers again, obviously wanting to leave but bound by social convention to stay. The silence lingered.\n\nSophia stepped away from the door and turned her eyes towards the man in the cot. \"Why's he here, instead of in containment?\"\n\nJules exhaled sharply behind her. Seconds passed and Sophia wondered if she had quietly left the room while her back was turned.\n\n\"He's... a bit of a problem-anomaly,\" Jules said. \"Have you read his file?\"\n\n\"I have.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" She rubbed her neck awkwardly. \"RAISA chose to feature my involvement with him rather heavily.

Slowly, she asked one of her questions.\n\n\"Do you think what's happening here is okay?\"\n\nJules hesitated before answering. \"No.\"\n\nSophia Light bit into the inside of her lip, refusing to turn away from the cot until she got her answers. \"Do you think there's a better way for things to be done?\"\n\n\"I... yes?
