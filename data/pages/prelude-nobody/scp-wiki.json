He sighed. //\"Well, it doesn't pay to wonder. Off to work I go.\"//\n\nHe straightened his jacket one last time, solemnly tipped his hat to the empty room, and stepped through the doorway.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
