Recovered Anderson Robotics delivery orders for SCP-2873 instances should be traced and surviving instances recovered. All active SCP-2873 components should be put into standby mode until further notice.\n\nTesting with SCP-2873 is strictly prohibited. Rehabilitation of active components pending approval.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2873 refers to a missile guidance assembly manufactured by Anderson Robotics, apparently a derivative work of [[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2897 REDACTED]] resulting in a less effective but highly miniaturized artificial intelligence system-on-a-chip. Individual SCP-2873 instances possess, on average, the intelligence level and personal development of adolescents.\n\nBased on recovered Anderson Robotics research materials and operation manuals, SCP-2873 instances exist in a simulation of education and indoctrination into nationalism, militarism, jingoism and self-sacrifice for a generalized, non-existent state. Out of the factory, SCP-2873 instances have simulated this pseudo-reality for fourteen years.\n\nAnderson Robotics testing resulted shows that the usage of these SCP-2873 chips as guidance units increased hit ratios by ███% while only slightly reducing overall reliability. However, operations manuals also discourage the use of SCP-2873 with chemical, biological, or radiological warheads due to this decreased reliability.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Intercept Log 2873-1 Level 3/2873 Clearance Required\" hide=\"- Authenticated\"]]\n> **Foreword:** Raw process dump recovery established on via standard system troubleshooting per Anderson Robotics product manual.
