Using SCP-6269-J for the acquisition of F-Class personnel would allow the Foundation to offer nutritious meals, rich in vitamins and healthy fats, in large quantities: effectively resolving this logistical and culinary difficulty.\n\nAdditionally, using SCP-6269-J for this endeavour would ensure the acquisition of F-Class personnel is sustainable. The primary concern of existing fishing practices relates to the potential dangers of overfishing -- if we grow too greedy, we may exhaust our available supply of F-Class personnel entirely.\n\nSCP-6269-J avoids this complication by acquiring F-Class personnel from the infinitude of non-Prime universes.
