Miniwa, R.A. Walker, I. Roman, R. Festiv, W.R. Markham, Dr. Zavalosa, G.E. Regas, I. Snevets, R. Nybble, J.R. Kai, Dr. Veritas, Dr. Beiderman, R. MacLean, R. Connolly, R. Rasclon, I. Demole, S.R. Vivic, A.R. King\n**Date:** 15/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Thirty wooden boxes, all labelled with \"Schrodinger's cat\" in pencil. Each box has a 50% chance of an image of a cat inside. \"Randomness\" achieved by placing an image of a cat within 15 of the 30 boxes, then instructing multiple researchers and interns to scramble the order of the boxes (while others are not observing). Researcher Miniwa then picked one box out of the 30, at random, and began this test.\n\n//Note: As this test has multiple researchers, each turning the key separately and at separate times, I have re-written each Input/Setting/Output to be \"Name/Input/Setting/Output\". Remaining boxes placed in storage. Requesting nobody opens boxes to retain randomness.\"- Researcher Miniwa//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-01**\n**Name:** Researcher Miniwa\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Wooden box. --Contains a paper image of Researcher Miniwa inside.-- When opened, has a 50% chance for an image of Researcher Miniwa to appear inside, attached to a paper. If the paper is removed and the box closed, the paper vanishes.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-02**\n**Name:** R.A. Walker\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden egg. When opened, --a paper image of an ''Eevee'' is found to be inside-- there is a 75% chance that a paper image of an ''Eevee'' will be found, and if there is an ''Eevee'', there is a 1 in 4096 chance that the creature will be silver and white instead of brown and tan.\n\n//Note: It appears that the chance of the \"Cat\" being dead has halved for me. - R.A. Walker//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-03**\n**Name:** Intern Roman\n**Input:** One of the above boxes.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Another, smaller box, containing --nothing-- a small wooden mouse. When opened, the mouse will have its eyes open half of the time, and will be flipped upside down with its eyes closed the other half of the time.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-04**\n**Name:** Researcher Festiv\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden box --with a ~87% chance of a photo of a cat being inside-- with the chances of a photo of a cat inside the box reducing with the time in between opening. This starts at a 99.9% chance directly after closing the box, and ending at a 0.1% chance 1 hour after closing the box.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-05**\n**Name:** WR Markham\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One wooden model of a trolley. When opened, --a photo of five women attacking an unknown weapon is seen-- there is a 48% chance that a photo of five people attacking an unknown weapon is visible, a 35% chance that a photo of an armed woman bleeding out and crying on her knees is seen, and another 17% chance where no photo appears.\n\n//Note: Combining the first two results would mean that the equivalent probability of a dead cat for me is one-third of the normal case. Also, the second image is rather unsettling, to say the least. - WR Markham//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-06**\n**Name:** Dr. Zavalosa\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One anomalous Matryoshka doll. The Matryoshka doll can be opened up to an identically sized Matryoshka doll, which can be opened up to another identically sized Matryoshka doll and so forth. The shells of the opened Matryoshka dolls are non-anomalous until used with the original doll at which point they will successfully fit back in place without extra force when contact is made with the original. Each of the Matryoshka dolls halves have a 25% chance of having a blue theme, a 25% chance of having a red theme and a 50% chance of having a purple theme. There is no set order to this colouring, closing the doll upon a certain colour does not mean the same colour will be seen once opened again. Stored in Dr. Zavalosa's belongings.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-07**\n**Name:** Guest Engineer Regas\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One wooden model “motor engine” with a cord. When the cord is pulled, a engine revving noise can be heard. 25% of the time, an engine noise will also be audible for the next 3 minutes as if the motor engine successfully started.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-08**\n**Name:** Intern Snevets\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden memory module for a quantum computer. Non-functional due to having no metal components.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-09**\n**Name:** Dr. Veritas\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Wooden miniature of a wood-chipper, with a single button on the side. The paper was lodged in the hopper. Testing shows that paper has a chance of around 50% to either be shredded normally or have alternate results.\n\nResults so far:\n\n# Normal shreds.\n# An animate paper butterfly capable of flight.\n# Normal shreds.\n# An origami flower that opens when exposed to sunlight.\n# Normal shreds.\n# A paper dice that only falls to 1 or 6.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-10**\n**Name:** Researcher Nybble\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A box that, when opened, contains either a blank piece of paper or a piece of paper with a 64 x 64 ''pixel'' drawing of a cat in an ''8-bit'' style.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-11**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One unchanged box, now labelled with \"Kai's kat\".\n\n//Note: Common sense dictates that I should get a D-class to open it... but I just have this urge, you know? - JR Kai//\n\n//Note: Are you actually thinking about sabotaging your own retirement plans for an ''urge''? - Veritas//\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nA compromise was reached and Junior Researcher Kai was allowed to open the box with a D-class personnel whose name was Kai ████. Both personnel were given Class-III personal protective gear and a stand-by MTF unit was requested for back-up.\n\nThe box was opened to reveal an origami kat plant (//Catha edulis//). After further testing was conducted, it was determined that the kat plant was anomalously alive, despite being consisted solely of paper. The plant's roots do not appear to dissolve in water and after clearing anomaly testing, is currently located on Junior Researcher Kai's desk.\n\n//Note: Kat is a stimulant, so anyone who sneaks into my office to grab a leaf or two is going to face a very annoyed me. - JR Kai//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-12**\n**Name:** Dr. Beiderman\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One non-anomalous wooden Hurdy Gurdy. When cranked, it plays \"Pop goes the weasel\". Testing has shown that there is a 50% chance each time it is used that it will instead play a nonlethal auditory hazard.\n\n//Note: Tom Jones' \"Whats New Pussycats\" is not an auditory hazard, guys.//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-13**\n**Name:** Researcher MacLean\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A box, whenever opened, has a 50% chance of containing a drawing of a cat, a 25% chance of containing nothing, and a 25% chance of containing a small spring-loaded blade composed of origami. The blade/cat disappears after ceasing to be observed, resetting the box.\n\n//Note: The 25% chance of a blade appearing was discovered after the box was activated a third time, stabbing the D-Class testing it in the Carotid Artery.//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-14**\n**Name:** Researcher Connolly\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden box with a picture of a cat inside. Upon closing and re-opening the box, there is a 25% chance that the picture will change to that of a black cat with the words “BOO!” written on the bottom. Upon seeing the image of the black cat, the viewer will faint from fright.\n\n//Note: It is confirmed that this fainting effect is due to an anomalous effect and not because the people testing are faint of heart, correct? - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-15**\n**Name:** Researcher Ija Rasclon\n**Input:** One of the above boxes.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A box that has a 25% chance to contain one wooden cat figure, a 12.5% chance to contain two half-mass figures, a 6.25% chance to contain at least four quarter-mass figures, etc. This pattern does not have a known limit. The chances are cumulative, meaning there is always a 50% chance for the box to be empty. Material for the figures is taken from the box's inside surface.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-16**\n**Name:** Intern Jane Demole, D-29445\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A wooden cat labelled Schrödinger's Box.\n**Input:** Above output\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A wooden cat that has wood fiber fur. D-29445 was instructed to reach his hand into the cat's mouth. D-29445 was hesitant, but followed orders. The cat bit down, causing D-29445 immense pain. When he pulled his arm out, there was a small origami box in his hand. When instructed to unfold it, the paper had a word written on it. 50% of the time, the word was \"Alive\", and the other 50% of the time, the word was \"Dead\".\n\n//Note: That's an interesting take on Schrödinger's Cat. - I. Demole//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-17**\n**Name:** SR Vivic\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A box that 50% of the time when opened will contain an origami wolf looking up that the person who opened the box. There is a 25% chance that the box will contain a cognitohazard that will cause the viewer to laugh for several seconds yet can not recite what was funny or what was in the box. Finally there is a 25% chance that the box will contain a piece of paper folded to resemble an old book with no identifying features.\n\n//Note: I used a camera yet I still do not know what is in the box when it shows the cognitohazard. - S.R. Vivic.//\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-18**\n**Name:** AR King\n**Input:** One of the above boxes\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A paper-like box with a wooden slate inside of it. The slate has a 50% chance of a carving of a normal cat, a 25% chance of Nekotama carving and a 25% chance of a Bakeneko carving.\n\n**Addendum:** There is actually a 49% chance of a carving of a normal cat and a 1% chance of a Kasha carving. The carving will be burning with a heatless fire that does not burn anything.\n\n**Ex. 914-1100-19**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Input:** One of the above boxes.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A box stylized like a tape cassette that, when opened, will have a 50% chance of playing one of the following songs, with the number of plays over a series of 100 openings indicated next to the title:\n- Kenny Loggins, //Highway to the Danger Zone// (7)\n- George Harrison, //(I Got My Mind) Set On You// (8)\n- Kenny Loggins, //Footloose// (4)\n- Jo-el Sonnier, //Louisiana 1920// (1)\n- Jo-el Sonnier, //Tear-Stained Letter// (9)\n- Ray Parker Jr., //Ghostbusters// (8)\n- The Bus Boys, //Cleanin' Up the Town// (7)\n- Mike Reno & Ann Wilson, //Almost Paradise// (3)\n- Bonnie Tyler, //Holding Out for a Hero// (3)\n\n//Note: This...this is the song list from a tape my mom recorded for me as a child. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Prof. Wren left the testing area partway into testing, visibly brought to tears.//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1101**\n**Name:** Guest Researcher Blue\n**Date:** 15/10/2019\n**Total Items:** 18 empty aluminum cans branded for, and previously containing, \"Canada Dry\" ginger ale, 3 large glass containers each of carbonated water, and high fructose corn syrup, 3 small glass containers each of ginger extract, assorted naturally sourced flavorings, citric acid, sodium benzoate, and caramel food coloring.\n \n//Note: The purpose of this test is to determine if 914 can reproduce a desired product when given the proper ingredients. I was uncertain of what \"natural flavors\" to include, so I made an educated guess. -G.R. Blue//\n \n**Input:** 6 aluminum cans, 1 set of ingredients.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 10 smaller than usual aluminum cans branded as \"Canada Wet\" ginger ale, and one large glass bowl of spare ingredients left in the corner of the output booth. Testing of the product confirmed it to be ordinary, notably non-carbonated water, with a very light ginger taste. After chemical testing revealed no other unusual properties, remaining unopened cans were placed in the break-room fridge.\n \n//Note: Not exactly what I was expecting, but I suppose this is an equivalent product in some sense of the word. -G.R. Blue//\n \n**Input:** 6 aluminum cans, 1 set of ingredients.  \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 6 aluminum cans branded as \"Dry Canadian\" ginger ale, and one cube of glass left in the corner of the output booth. D-class testing the beverage described a sudden and intense urge to acquire Canadian citizenship. When tested with a D-class already possessing of Canadian citizenship, D-class expressed an overwhelming feeling of national pride.\n\n**Addendum:** Approx. 5 minutes after testing, both D-class expressed an intense need to urinate. After relieving themselves, and upon a medical screening, D-class who tested the product where found to be experiencing minor dehydration. Remaining unopened cans incinerated.\n\n//Note: Guess it does what it says on the tin. -G.R. Blue//\n\n**Input:** 6 aluminum cans, 1 set of ingredients.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** 1 large glass stein, with ornate aluminum inlay reading \"914 Brand Extra Dry Ginger Ale\". D-class was asked to take a drink of the contents, and immediately after doing so began urinating uncontrollably. D-class expressed panic until urination abruptly ceased at which point D-class collapsed onto the floor, and a slurry of other bodily fluids began draining from all present pores and orifices. D-class simultaneously appeared to \"shrivel up\" with their flesh becoming increasingly tight around their bones. After this effect had appeared to cease, further inspection revealed that the D-class had been completely drained of all fluids, making their body extremely rigid and very brittle. Stein produced by SCP-914 was found to have broken when dropped by the testing D-class, and the contents mixed with the bodily fluids on the testing room floor. Physical contact with spilled contents produced no anomalous effects, although it is unknown if this is due to their mixture with the bodily fluids present, or due to a requirement of being consumed to produce its anomalous effects. D-class remains as well as remains of stein incinerated.\n\n//Note: Dear lord, this is going to be a nightmare to clean up... Regardless, these results were extremely interesting, I'll have to design more tests to explore this further. -G.R. Blue//\n\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1102**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 15/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three blank Blu-Ray discs with notes on the labels.\n\n//Note: These tend to produce interesting results, what can I say? -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** A disc marked with a group photo of the 914 testing staff.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A disc containing a copy of the full season of ''Firefly'', with the main cast replaced by the following Site staff:\n\n- Site Director Hackett as Capt. Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds\n- Dr. Veritas as Hoban \"Wash\" Washburne\n- Senior Researcher Vivic as Zoë Washburne\n- Researcher Miniwa as Kaywinnet Lee \"Kaylee\" Frye\n- Dr. Zane as Simon Tam\n- Intern Lunar as Shepherd Derrial Book\n- Researcher Connolly as Jayne Cobb\n- Prof. Wren as Inara Serra\n- A mechanical humanoid, presumably a representation of SCP-914, as River Tam\n- Researcher Darby as the \"Grr Argh\" monster in the end credits logo.\n\n**Input:** A disc with the SCP Foundation logo imprinted on it.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A disc labeled \"110-Montauk.\" Immediately ordered to be incinerated by Prof. Wren.\n\n//Note: D-class dropped the disc immediately upon picking it up, convulsing and vomiting for 2 minutes before being sedated by medical staff. After calming down enough to speak, D-class explained, with difficulty, how touching the disc caused him to see [DATA EXPUNGED]. D-class then proceeded to snap the disc in half and slit his own throat with the jagged edge. A janitorial staffer was brought in to clean up the testing area after D-class' body was removed, but had a similar reaction when the broom he was using came in contact with a shard of the disc. Staffer was sedated enough to finish cleanup, whereupon he deposited all pieces of the disc into the incinerator before attempting to enter the incinerator himself. Sedated and administered amnestics.//\n\n//Note: Good lord… -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Remainder of test aborted by request of Prof. Wren.//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1103**\n**Name:** Researcher Nybble\n**Date:** 14/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One note reading \"Hi 914! Im new here. Hope you treat me well!\", a sharpened number 2 pencil\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned items\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A hollowed-out pencil with the graphite and metal removed and an origami USB drive. Testing has shown that when plugged into a computer it opens a .txt file containing the original note.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1104**\n**Name:** Assistant Researcher King\n**Date:** 15/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Two vacuums, one mop and one feather duster\n\n//Note: Maybe I can get something for the janitorial staff, something that could help clean the output booth faster between tests or something - AR King//\n\n**Input:** One vacuum\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A vacuum that when turned on, will suck in any dust, dirt, etc. within a 1 meter radius of the vacuum nozzle.\n\n**Input:** One mop\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A mop that cleans anything it passes over perfectly, leaving the surface the same as it was when originally made. Reduces friction of cleaned surfaces by an extreme amount, making them more slippery than ice. Effect lasts until a significant amount of dirt was added.\n\n**Input:** One feather duster\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --An unchanged feather duster.-- When the output comes into contact with a surface it will slowly draw in any dust from the surface to the point of contact.\n\n**Addendum:** The dust will be drawn in a direct line from its starting position, meaning any dust will bore through any object in the direction of the duster. AR King dropped the object after holding it for 24 seconds and was sent to the medical ward for examination after exclamation about pain in his chest. He had multiple small holes in his lungs and throat and has been placed in the medical ward until further notice. Item incinerated.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1105**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines\n**Date:** 15/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Two figurines of the character “Dio” from part 3 of the Anime and manga series “Jojo’s Bizarre Adventures”\n\n**Input:** One of the figurines\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One figurine of the character “Jotaro” from the same series\n\n**Input:** One of the figurines\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One figurine, appearing identical to the input, but with a button on the figure's back that when pressed, will cause the figurine to glow yellow for approximately 3 seconds. The phrase “ZA WARUDO!” will be emitted from the mouth of the figure during this time, which caused the D-class involved in testing to immediately demanifest. The D-class reappeared 3 seconds later, 10 meters away from where he originally was. It has been concluded that the figurine is capable of limited time-manipulation. Further testing showed that the more times the button is pressed, the longer period of time will be stopped.\n\n//Note: I’d like to request further testing, to see what uses this might have. - Junior Researcher Pines//\n\n//Note: Veritas will never approve of keeping anything with time manipulation properties. It goes to anomalous storage or the incinerator, your choice. - WR Markham//\n\n//Note: Permanent storage. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1106**\n**Name:** R.A. Walker\n**Date:** 16/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One 1cm cube of sodium, magnesium, aluminium, silicon, and phosphorus, each contained in glass\n\n**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with sodium\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A shot glass made of sodium. The outside is lined with glass. When removed from the output booth, water began condensing in the glass, causing it to combust. Output was thrown onto the floor by R.A. Walker, and he proceeded to forcefully smother the flames and crush the output with the bottom of his lab boots.\n\n**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with magnesium\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 10 glass matches. When struck, they burn for less than one second. Determined non-anomalous and discarded.\n\n**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with aluminium\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One square meter of aluminum foil, folded to give the appearance that it is wrapped around a sandwich. Testing shows an impurity of silicon in the foil. R.A. Walker seemed dismayed when he found that there was in fact no sandwich in the foil.\n\n**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with silicon\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 1.2cm cube of glass.\n\n**Input:** Above output\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Lenses for a pair of glasses. R.A. Walker took his glasses off and looked through the lenses. When he took the lenses away, he became visibly distressed. He removed the lenses from his glasses and replaced them with the output, before putting the glasses back on.\n\n//Note: I don't know what these lenses are, but now, when I look around without them, everything looks orange and yellow. It's rather creepy. - R.A. Walker//\n\n**Input:** 1cm cube of glass filled with phosphorus\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A phosphorus statue of Researcher Darby on a glass stand. Darby is holding a white phosphorus grenade. Darby himself is made of red phosphorus.\n\n**Addendum:** After visiting an on-site ophthalmologist, it has been determined that the lenses altered the opsins in Walker's eye, causing his cone cells to be receptive to light with wavelengths of 1µm, 12µm, and 14µm instead of 440nm, 540nm, and 570nm. Wearing the lenses seems to correct this.\n\n//Note: My vision is still poor without my glasses, so it doesn't bother me. - R.A. Walker//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1107**\n**Name:** Researcher Ija Rasclon\n**Date:** 16/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Four pieces of paper, with various Foundation terms for hazard classification written on them.\n\n//Note: SCP-914 never gives an expected output, especially on higher settings. I want to test the limits of this negation property. I'm fully aware that this test could produce something extremely dangerous, which is why I will be starting with only singular hazard types to make sure the limit isn't extremely low, and will be implementing **heavy** safety methods in the final test. Still, I don't expect to come out uninjured, which is why I'll be conducting this test with only me, D-Class, and a standby security team in case anything goes wrong. -R. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** A piece of paper, reading \"cognitohazardous\".\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A piece of paper, reading \"yum\". Possesses an infohazardous property which causes a piece of it to manifest inside the mouth of any person informed of its existence.\n\n//Note: Alright, the negation still holds when it's directly addressed. It didn't create a cognitohazard. I'll try to force it into a corner. -R. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** A piece of paper, reading \"cognitohazardous, infohazardous, memetic\"\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate piece of paper, capable of basic movement via flapping.\n\n//Note: Still not anything I wrote. Good. One more test before the large one. -R. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** A piece of paper, reading \"cognitohazardous, infohazardous, memetic, animate, hostile, sapient, sentient\"\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A piece of paper with edges sharp enough to cut most material it was tested upon, with the exception of materials possessing high chemical regularity (large crystals, extremely pure long-chain proteins, etc).\n\n//Note: I'll be going ahead with the final test. The room is soundproofed, and a highly-cooperative D-Class (D-1325) will be operating the machine. I'll be communicating with D-1325 by paper passed through a metal hatch, controlled by a mechanical system which allows only one end to be open at a time. I will be confirming the continuity of the being I am communicating with via a randomly-generated password (GeNERAl) at the start of each note. There will be no method of visually observing the chamber from the outside. The room is vacuum-sealed, and can be drained of air or flooded with noble gases / toxins. I hope that's enough. If my negation hypothesis is correct, hopefully all this safety will be for nothing. -R. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** A piece of paper, with every Foundation hazard classification written on it.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Transcript:**\n> **R. Rasclon:** Place the paper into the input booth and activate the machine. Make sure the dial is set to 'Very Fine'.\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. It's in. The thing's making some noises.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** That's normal behaviour. Wait there, and refrain from percieving the output booth. Tell us when it opens. You'll hear it.\n>\n> [8 minutes pass]\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. The door opened, and the noises have stopped. I haven't looked in the box yet.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** Look at the output through the glasses we gave you, but do not approach it.\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. I can't see it that clearly from here. It looks like the paper's been folded or crunched into a ball or something. My brain hasn't exploded though.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** Throw the rock at the output.\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. Chucked the pebble at it, but I missed by a couple feet. Nothing happened.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** Please remove the glasses.\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. Took them off. Not dead.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** Approach the output to inspect it.\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. It's funny shaped. Like a cylinder with two rectangles coming out the bottom. It's folded.\n>\n> **R. Rasclon:** Are there markings of any kind on the cylinder?\n>\n> **D-1325:** GeNERAl. Yeah. It just says the word 'capacitor' a bunch of times.\n**Output:** A piece of paper folded into the shape of a basic capacitor. The word 'capacitor' is written on the surface of the object many times, in various sizes, writing styles, and capitalization forms. No anomalous properties found, despite over 12 hours of testing.\n\n//Note: Refer to 0850. -R. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: Researcher Ija Rasclon has requested a two week leave period, as well as Thaumiel-class protection measures to be implemented into the anomalous storage ward. The first request was granted, and the second denied. - Veritas//\n\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1108**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Vivic, D-77544\n**Date:** 16/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Four pairs of aviator glasses, 20g of quartz dust, 30g of zinc, 20g of phosphorus, 20g of palladium.\n\n**Input:** One pair of glasses, 20g of quartz dust\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually identical pair of glasses; however, there are 4 wide diagonal stripes along the arm of the glasses. When worn, the wearer will perceive 280 spiders of various species on all surfaces viewed, yet cannot feel them. The effect ceases once removed. Glasses destroyed via incineration.\n\n//Note: All things considered, it was lucky that D-77544 actually likes spiders and did not lose his mind when wearing these. - Vivic//\n\n**Input:** One pair of glasses, 30g of zinc  \n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One pair of glasses with identical lenses; however, the rim surrounding the lenses now have a silver sheen. Inscribed upon the left arm are the words ”For Darby” and on the right arm is ”Now with more spiders!” When worn, the wearer perceives over 25,000 individual spiders on all objects and surfaces; when removed, the effect lasts up to 8 minutes and will cause great levels of distress in the wearer. Object destroyed with extreme prejudice via controlled explosives.\n\n//Note: D-77544 no longer likes spiders and has been diagnosed with arachnophobia after this test.

This is one JoJo reference that actually makes sense: in the Japanese version of the Yu-Gi-Oh GX anime, the character who used the Arcana Force cards was voiced by the same guy who voiced Dio, and one of his best monsters, Arcana Force XXI - THE WORLD, has an ability that skips your opponent's next turn. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Thanks for the seeing insight, Wren. Don't know how I could get by before knowing this. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** One deck.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A tablet made out of compressed paper stock. Atop the tablet is a translucent sphere made out of the laminate used on the cards. An anomalous property has been found where holding the tablet and asking a question will cause them to see a vision pertaining to the answer within the sphere. Answers given have been determined to be 100% accurate, although the vagueness of the answer is proportional to the vagueness of the question.\n\n//Note: While the potential for answering things like how we can kill 682 is promising, I must insist we restrict use of this. And not just because it gave a perfectly clear answer when I asked it what I look like naked. Side note: I catch anyone else asking that question, I will be giving a lesson in the meaning of the word \"eunuch.\" -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: I'm inclined to agree with Wren here. While the ability of this item to be used as a Thaumiel is undisputable, what if it turned out to give answers that were wrong, say, 5% of the time? Say that 5% was the time we asked it how to kill 682, and you see the problem. What if it shows you the most likely answer you could come up with? Heavy containment, lots of testing with psychological screening beforehand, and maybe then we can try to use it for good. - R. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: Given that trying to use anomalous items backfires in gruesome ways most of the time, it's going in storage for now. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1125**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines\n**Date:** 18/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Painting of ''Saturn devouring his son'' by Francisco Goya\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned item\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Due to SCP 914s history with visual media it was deemed necessary to have a D class observe the painting first. D 2941, a 32-year-old male was brought to the Foundation after killing a man who threatened his 10-year-old child. Subject noted that the painting looked identical to the original but strangely remarking that he quote: ''understood why''. He repeated this statement for 5 minutes before attempting to attack a guard while shouting the phrase ''he must not usurp me'' before being sedated. Studies of his brain activity showed his temporal lobe had been damaged, making him lack empathy. It has been concluded that the painting had a cognitohazardous effect, making the viewer violently seek and attempt to kill their children. All further testing has been suspended by Junior Researcher Pines.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1126**\n**Name:** Dr. Beiderman\n**Date:** 18/10/2019\n**Total Items:** 1 hard-drive, containing a copy of the ''Samsara'' OS. 1 hard-drive containing a .txt file with random alphanumeric characters. 1 hard-drive, blank.\n\n**Input:** 1 hard-drive, containing a copy of Samsara OS.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 1 hard-drive, containing an operating system called dad.os.

This result seems to indicate that it somehow understands what I am attempting to do. The gear likely represents 914 itself, and the brain intelligence - though who's intelligence it is is up for debate. To ensure it didn't simply reproduce what I see on the card, the card was chosen at random, and the photo was added to give it something else to \"consider\". And yes, I'm aware of the irony with my name. It's a coincidence, I assure you. - Psychological Specialist Insano//\n\n//Note: Trust me, I understand the concept of ironic names. Just take a look at my office. - Junior Researcher Pines//\n\n//Note: Hey doc, why did 914 make a picture of a ghost chasing me? - Researcher Connolly//\n\n//Note: Hey doc, I think someone's been stealing leaves from my kat plant. Can you check everyone to see if anyone is currently under the influence of... paper-based stimulants? - Junior Researcher Kai//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-1128**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Date:** 21/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One calculator, one origami rhinoceros beetle, one 7m × 1m bolt of cotton cloth\n\n**Input:** One calculator\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One device that does not resemble a calculator. Contains a cognitohazard that causes affected personnel to constantly draw parallels with calculators, but does not resemble similar cognitohazards that affect calculators. The effect lasted up to an hour for Junior Researcher Kai, resembling the time one spends using a calculator during a Mathematics examination.\n\n//Note: Annoying, just like this calculator I am going to incinerate. - JR Kai//\n\n**Input:** One origami beetle\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One origami stag beetle that does not resemble a calculator. Determined to be affected by the same cognitohazard created in the previous test.\n\n//Note: I'm going to take an amnestic that doesn't look like a calculator. Be back in a while. - JR Kai//\n\n**Input:** One 7m × 1m bolt of cloth\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One cotton robe of impossibly high quality, with the inputted cotton threads having been separated into strands thousands of times finer than hair and being woven together into an extremely dense fabric.\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-1129**\n**Name:** Dr. Noel Cahill\n**Date:** 21/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three 100mL jars of chocolate obtained from Unexplained Location UE-892000\n\n//Note: I've gotten permission from Director Hackett to try refining some of the chocolate from those bees we have at the parking lot. - Dr. Cahill//\n\n**Input:** One jar of chocolate\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One jar of honey\n\n//Note: It appears that SCP-914 is either aware that the chocolate is produced by anomalous bees and made the connection, or it just thinks that honey is an equivalent exchange for chocolate. - Dr. Cahill//\n\n**Input:** One jar of chocolate\n**Setting:** Fine\n//Note: Test was conducted by a randomly-selected D-class who was unaware of the origins of the chocolate.//\n**Output:** One seemingly unchanged jar of chocolate. Testing on D-class personnel reveals that the chocolate anomalously induces an allergy to bee venom after consumption.\n\n//Note: Oddly specific, 914. - Dr. Cahill//\n\n**Input:** One jar of chocolate\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One bee made of anomalously solid chocolate with a serrated sting made of glass from the inputted jar. It attempted to attack D-class personnel who opened the Output booth, creating minor lacerations on his arms when he tried to cover his head.\n\n//Note: Nice reflexes, sir. - Dr. Cahill//\n\n//Note: The anomalous output was neutralized by Dr. Veritas. Single-handedly. I'm not sure whether to be impressed with or scared by Lucius' skill with a flyswatter. - Hackett//\n\n//Note: I'd go with both, sir. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Was there really a need to swat it towards me?

Somehow, I managed to find six copies of this notorious novel at a thrift shop of all places. If anyone desperately needs a bad read, or for experiments, it's on my desk. - Grizzly//\n\n**Input:** One copy of //The Turner Diaries//\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Torn up pieces of paper, a puddle of ink\n\n**Input:** One copy of //The Turner Diaries//\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** 84 pieces of white paper, 22 pieces of black paper, 2 pieces of red paper. All 108 are printed with either \"National Alliance, est. 1974\", or \"Hillsboro, WV\".\n\n//Note: Predictable so far. It is published by that white nationalist organization. - Grizzly//\n\n**Input:** One copy of //The Turner Diaries//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One copy of //Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung//, 1966 bilingual edition.\n\n//Note: Pierce equates to Mao. 914 is definitely satirical on this. - Grizzly//\n\n**Input:** One copy of //The Turner Diaries//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One copy of //The Education of Little Tree//. Apart from the front and back covers, which is colored red instead of orange, it shows no deviation in content from the 1976 first edition by Asa Earl \"Forrest\" Carter.\n\n//Note: Both men were white supremacists for sure, but from what I see, Carter is probably the \"better\" of the two.

I felt inclined to deny it, but they’re taking full responsibility for any incidents. -Researcher MacLean//\n\n//Note: How gracious of them to leave us with the cleanup though. I sent them a friendly memo. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** One laser, 0.5kg of steel, one dynamo, one lens\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One sphere-shaped object covered in small glass lenses, with a wind-up key embedded in the bottom. After the key is wound, and the object placed on the ground, the object will begin rotating at over 500 RPM, and emit high powered lasers through the lenses. Vivisected multiple on-site testing D-class and subsequently deactivated. Object placed in storage.\n\n//Note: So, a ''Death-co ball''. Interesting, but I doubt that’s what they’re looking for. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One laser, 0.5kg of steel, one dynamo, one lens\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** What appears to be a “Retro-Futuristic Ray-Gun” styled after the steampunk genre. The gun is capable of firing a maximum of 4 high powered beams capable of piercing through a foot of hardened steel, and appears to use a piston style mechanism to recharge. The use of the recharging mechanism requires approximately 400 newtons of force to cycle once (for a single shot). The recoil for one shot was powerful enough to dislocate D-12365's arms. It is for these reasons considered impractical for field use. The object has been transferred to the Weapons Research and Development Department for study.\n\n//Note: I got to test the thing, and while it's powerful, it’s bulky and kicks like a mule. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-1136**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Vil\n**Date:** 21/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Five sketches of personnel working in Site-19 Facility-23.\n\n//Note: Just got my promotion and will proceed with my second part of the art experiment.

Due to the input mass, the output MP5 is slightly lighter than standard by 0.04 kg. It is, however, operable like normal guns of its type.\n\n//Note: While it is not anomalous, that missing 40 grams led to the stock having a corner being chipped off. - WR Markham//\n\n**Input:** Magazines\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 83 replica bullets, all of which are 4.73×33mm caseless ammunition. Three of them launched at WR Markham's choker, and attached to it.\n\n//Note: I don't even know why it had to be of the G11 prototype assault rifle.

After 3 days, it was reported that the D-class, who had been diagnosed with clinical depression 2 weeks prior, seemed much happier and content with his life. Junior Researcher Pines decided then to test the painting on himself and felt no effects until the next day, where he reported feeling extremely satisfied with his life choices and at peace with his current position. Pines has requested to hang this in the personnel breakroom to improve morale.\n\n//Note: Denied. Pines and the D-Class are under psychological treatment temporarily, as it was found that five days after exposure, the mood of the viewer relapses dramatically due to exhaustion of dopamine production, similar to drug addiction rebound.

Luckily, I've heard of [*https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Medi_Gun a device which can do exactly that]. Still, I'm having a D-Class retrieve the output just in case it turns out to be hazardous. - Bradley//\n\n**Input:** The above-mentioned items.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A metallic hose-like contraption vaguely resembling a lamprey. When the output booth was opened, it immediately lunged at D-967124 and latched on to his head, swallowing the head completely and clamping its \"jaws\" around his neck. D-967124 attempted to pry the output off in a fit of panic. Within several seconds, D-967124 began thrashing, flailing, and wildly running around the room in a futile attempt to dislodge the output, crashing into walls and beating his head against various things. Security attempted to intervene, but D-967124 withstood several seconds of sustained gunfire without being terminated. Eventually, D-967124 was restrained with steel cables and thrown into the incinerator. Notably, the output and D-967124 were resistant to the fire for a full 30 seconds before eventually being destroyed.\n\n//Note: Lord Almighty in Heaven, have mercy on that poor soul. That was// incredibly //horrifying to watch. Also, I have no idea where the glass went — possibly the interior of that godawful contraption — but I swear that thing popped an Übercharge as a last-ditch effort to save itself; good thing the security guys restrained the D-Class, or it might have walked him out of the incinerator and we'd have a whole new problem to deal with. -GJTW Bradley//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1157**\n**Name:** Researcher MacLean\n**Date:** 25/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One wooden baseball bat, one baseball, two pictures of [[[https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Scout | The Scout]]]\n\n//Note: So I heard that Kai accidentally made a __TF2__ flamethrower and I got a bit nostalgic, so I dug up some sports equipment out of my closet. Batter up! - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One baseball bat, one picture\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A higher-quality baseball bat, labelled “The Vintage Sandman”. The bat is extremely durable, and reportedly feels lighter, despite the weight being unchanged when measured. The bat’s main anomalous effects are made apparent when used to hit a baseball or a living creature. Upon contact, the impact will result in more force transferred than normal. This force is directly proportional to the amount of time in minutes without hitting an object, multiplied by the original velocity of the bat. This force is not centered on the area of impact, but rather distributed evenly throughout the entire object. The maximum amount of force stored is approximately 80 kN.  The paper is presumed to have been embedded in the bat.\n\n**Input:** One baseball, one picture\n**Setting:** Very Fine.\n**Output:** One baseball, which has similar effects to the previously output, but administers the force during impact with an object that is not the original propellant. The effects do not activate if the baseball hits the head of a living creature. Rather, the baseball will always discharge enough force upon impact to either render the target unconscious or cause a concussion. All other stored force will be depleted after the impact. The ball shares the same anomalous durability of the bat, but appears to have no maximum energy limit. The paper has become blank, and has no anomalous properties.\n\n//Note: Even if these things only work if thrown or swung, they’ve got to go. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n//Note: Upon placing the objects in the incinerator and activating it, the objects violently released their stored energy, causing a massive explosion. The explosion caused no casualties, but destroyed the incinerator. The bat and ball were found intact in the wreckage and transferred into anomalous storage.//\n\n//Note: Wow. That’s the second time we’ve wrecked the incinerator in two weeks.

A cognitohazard was then discovered when Dr. Cahill made skin contact with the weapon, causing all individuals who view Dr. Cahill to perceive [her] as one of Charlie's Angels. Subsequent testing with the revolver reveals it to be accurate up to an effective range of 300m. Dr. Cahill has since disposed of the revolver. (Refer to below test.)\n\n//Note: Thank you 914 for the effort. I don't need to look like a movie character to be comfortable with who I am. I'll be returning this to you. - Dr. Cahill//\n\n**Input:** Previous output\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One pile of ground-up plastic arranged into a smiley face\n\n//Note: Dr. Cahill has taken leave for a month for his upcoming gender reassignment surgery.//\n\n//Note: About time. See you soon, Noelle. - J.R.

When a subject affected by the cognitohazard is asked about their opinion of the Welsh language, the subject will invariably say that they did not enjoy learning it, even if they had anomalously learnt the language from viewing the flag.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1163**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Vivic\n**Date:** 28/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three tripod-mounted tennis ball launchers, twelve tennis balls, one tennis ball container\n\n**Input:** One tripod-mounted tennis ball launcher, loaded with six tennis balls\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One shoulder-mounted tennis ball cannon that will launch any tennis balls placed into the rear end of it via anomalous means. So far, the speed of the launched ball has been recorded to be between 30 and 40m/s. The original six tennis balls have not been found.\n\n**Input:** One tripod-mounted tennis ball launcher, unloaded\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One unusually-shaped device, visually similar to that of an unloaded RPG-7. When any tennis ball is placed within the front end of the barrel, it will anomalously transform to resemble an RPG-7 rocket, yet will not fire it even when the trigger of the device is pulled. The transformed ball can easily be removed by hand, but will not revert to its original form. All rockets removed are not loaded with explosives.\n\n**Input:** One tripod-mounted tennis ball launcher, loaded with two tennis balls\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually similar device with \"The Wiener Launcher\" now labelled on its side. Hot dogs of any brand are launched automatically when placed in the modified hopper. Via anomalous means, inserted hot dogs are propelled at roughly 155m/s with an electronic beep as a warning 2 seconds before firing.\n\n//Note: The fact that the window of the Facility-23 personnel residence 16 shattered and the presence of a hot dog within the pile of glass is nothing more than an odd coincidence. - JR Kai//\n\n**Addendum:**\nIt has been discovered by Dr. Zane (after an unnamed individual broke a window) that the previous output also possess a cognitohazard that affects anyone who sees it or interacts with it to behave far more recklessly than normal. Onlookers will also cheer the user on to perform said reckless acts. Due to the potential for greater damage in the future, the device has been incinerated. The exact effects of the cognitohazard unfortunately went unnoticed until now.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1164**\n**Name:** R.A.

The inside is hollow.\n\n//Note: Wait, we don't have a Professor Birch here? - R.A. Walker//\n\n**Input:** Three birch planks\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An elaborately designed birch chair. After five minutes of D-20932 sitting in the chair, she mentions that she is unable to get comfortable. When asked to get up, she found herself stuck to the chair by what was determined to be birch sap. Object disassembled, D-class freed, object incinerated.\n\n**Input:** One birch plank\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Birch wood chips\n\n**Input:** One birch plank\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One plank of lignin, one plank of cellulose, one pool of birch sap. The output planks are soft and fragile.\n\n//Note: This is why I usually use Fine. Rough and Coarse are too predictable. Rough shreds the input, Coarse takes it apart. - R.A. Walker//\n\n**Input:** Five birch planks\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An exquisite dining set. When viewed, people are inclined to acquire a hot beverage, especially tea, coffee, hot chocolate, or apple cider, and sit in one of the chairs. The chairs are quite comfortable, though those who sit in them are unable to get up until their drink is consumed. After they finish their drink, they reportedly feel relaxed. The anomalous effect occurs up to three times a day, and no less than six hours apart.\n\n//Note: Had a nice chat with D-20932 over some coffee. It seems she grew up in a troubled home, and... what? The test? Oh, right. The table and chairs have been put into anomalous storage, pending Veritas' judgement. - R.A. Walker//\n\n//Note: Walker can have it once it clears screening, just don't put it in the cafeteria. Bad for productivity. - Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1165**\n**Name:** I. Demole, D-12249\n**Date:** 28/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three small bottles of 939 pheromone, acquired from Site 19-31\n\n**Input:** One bottle of 939 pheromone\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A bottle, a cork, and several puddles, each one consisting of a single protein from the input.\n\n**Input:** One bottle of 939 pheromone\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One bottle of ''2678 pheromone''. Testing shows effect and chemical makeup matches the gas SCP-2678 expels. D-12249 is stressed when exposed to the contents of the bottle. D-12249 was sedated and amnesticized for the remainder of the anomalous effect's duration.\n\n**Input:** One bottle of 939 pheromone\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One bottle of ''914 pheromone''. Testing shows that it contains trace amounts of hydrocarbons, potentially gear oil. When tested on D-12249, he entered a vegetative state. When an item is placed in his right hand, he begins modifying the object, using whatever tools he is given. If he is not given a tool, he will use his teeth and fingernails to modify the object. Once done, he will hold the modified object in his left hand. Amnestics appear to cancel the effect. It is noted that ''modified'', in this context, usually means destroying an object by hand or pulling it apart.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1166**\n**Name:** Dr. Zavalosa\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Four blank post-it notes, a pen, two glass Klein bottle models, a paper Mobius strip\n\n//Note: Today, we are working with non-orientable objects. Due to 914 tendency to turn things hazardous, I have employed safety precautions, such as Researcher Rasclons's work in Test 914-1107 which I shall be placing notes indicating the results become hazardous, in the hopes the negation will cause safe results. Regardless, I will also be employing a squad of MTF Eta-10 \"See No Evil\" and D-0772 in case the negation effect goes awry. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n**Input:** One glass Klein bottle model, one post-it note stuck to the model stating \"hazardous.\"\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Shards of the glass bottle model, one paper Mobius strip made from the post-it note.\n\n//Note: As hoped, the coarse setting 'downgrades' the Klein bottle into a Mobius strip. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n**Input:** One paper Mobius strip, one post-it note stuck to the strip stating \"hazardous.\"\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One larger post-it note with a circle drawn on it.\n\n//Note: A circle constitutes as one-dimensional space, so the downgrade for a Mobius strip is a circle. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n**Input:** The larger post-it note with a circle drawn on it, as well as the word \"hazardous.\"\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** The larger post-it note with a single dot drawn on it.\n\n//Note: A dot is the only way to visualize 0-dimensional space, so far so good. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n**Input:** One glass Klein bottle model, one post-it note stuck to the model stating \"hazardous.\"\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One non-orientable model theorized to be represented in Theta Prime dimension space. When D-0772 picked the model up, the model suddenly deconstituted and all papers within Research Chamber-B were inscribed with numerous copies of SCP-033. A squad of MTF Theta-90 \"Angle Grinders\" was dispatched in response and all affected electronics and papers were isolated and disposed of.\n\n//Note: SCP-033 is not listed as a hazardous object so the negation effect wasn't broken, at the same time it got in my prosthetic and caused the entire mechanical system to break down and had to be disposed of as well. It’s good fortune that William is still here. - Dr. Zavalosa.//\n\n//Note: We should be careful not to overextend the negation property. 914 works with the information given, and doesn't produce exactly the expected output. The more information-heavy the input, the likelier it is to make something that actually has the written property. - R. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: That does raise the question on if we can utilise the negation property to corner 914 into producing predictable outputs. Perhaps further experiments should be attempted on the negation property - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n//Note: Those were important documents. Months of research on the origins of 914 gone. Veritas said that he would like to see you in his office. - JR.

Item incinerated.\n\n**Input:** 1 set of ''Exploding Kittens''\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A set of ''Exploding Puppies''. All cards have been replaced with dog related cards. Cards have been placed in the break room after anomalous testing.\n\n**Input:** 1 set of ''Exploding Kittens''\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A set of ''Exploding Kittens''. When an ''Exploding Kitten'' card is drawn, the entire hand of cards explodes violently after 3 seconds if not defused. Item incinerated.\n\n//Note: Thing nearly blew off my hand, good thing I threw the cards down after I drew the ''Exploding Kitten''.

Tea can really calm you down. - Laskenta//\n\n**Input:** One tea set\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A massive ceramic tray and a miniature metal tea set, non-anomalous. The masses of the input and the output match.\n\n**Input:** One tea set\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One metal and nine ceramic figurines, representing the letter 'T', non-anomalous.\n\n**Input:** One tea set\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One ceramic sphere on the (unchanged) metal tray. --Placing the sphere on a tray with a tea set (composed out of the items used in the test) results in an anomalous effect, that fills the teapot with hot tea, the creamer with milk, the bowl with sugar, and the plate with lemons or limes.-- Placing the sphere on a tray with a tea set (composed out of the items used in the test) results in a cognitohazard that affects everybody who intends to drink tea from the tea set. Affected subjects will believe that the set was filled with fluids and fruits that belong into a tea set. Instead, the teapot will fill with [[[scp-2649 | SCP-2649-A]]]. Both outputs have been destroyed.\n\n//Note: What I took from that test is: Tea can calm you down as long as you don't put it into 914. No further comment. - Laskenta//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1169**\n**Name:** Researcher Connolly\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three bottles of water, three bottles of Gatorade, three bottles of acetaminophen tablets, three copies of a recipe for a purported hangover cure.\n\n//Note: Cleared for testing again, following my unfortunate incident. I got the idea for this test while suffering from the worst antimeme hangover I’ve ever had. - Researcher Connolly//\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One bottle of sparkling water, one bottle of Powerade, one bottle of ibuprofen tablets, one handwritten note. The note is a letter requesting permission for Researcher Connolly to be “absent from school today due to the bug that’s going around”.\n\n//Note: This handwriting looks like my mother’s. - Researcher Connolly//\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One bottle labeled “914’s Mind Over Matter Cure-All!”. Produces a cognitohazardous effect that causes whoever makes physical contact with the bottle to no longer feel whatever illness is currently afflicting them, including mental and undiagnosed illnesses. Symptoms reappear as soon as physical contact with the bottle is broken.\n\n**Addendum:** Testing with D-Class has revealed that upon ingesting any amount of the bottle’s contents, subject reports a severe increase in intensity of whatever illness is afflicting them. Testing suspended after D-4192, who had been diagnosed with depression, drank a small quantity and proceeded to [REDACTED].\n\n**Input:** One of each of the above items\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small animate creature, resembling a dog with a note on its back. The note read, “Sparky”. The body appeared to be made mostly of frozen water and Gatorade, and teeth consisting of the acetaminophen capsules. Upon exiting the Output booth, subject immediately proceeded to Researcher Connolly and bit his ankle, whereupon the creature then melted into a non-anomalous puddle. Researcher Connolly reported all adverse effects of his amnestic treatment to be completely gone.\n\n//Note: Sparky was the name of my childhood dog. He used to nibble to show affection.

Observed to \"beat\" at a constant rate. A memetic effect causes people to view it as a human heart.\n\n**Input:** One Class 19-T Memory Backup\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged Class 19-T Memory Backup. Physical contact causes a subject to \"experience\" the \"memories\" of the Sarhu model, from the beginning of its first surgical procedure to the time of its decommissioning.\n\n//Note: An interesting result, but we will have to incinerate it after I get King up to medical for some amnestics. - Dr. Beiderman//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1171**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One silver necklace, adorned with symbols related to the Wiccan faith, owned by JR Pines.\n\n**Input:** Above item\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged necklace with a cognitohazardous effect that causes wearers to fervently believe they can practice magic. The D-class wore the necklace for three days under heavy surveillance and was observed trying to start a ''coven'' and talking personnel, cellmates or stationary objects about the ''wonder of magic''. After the necklace was removed, the D-class remarked that they only believed it because they quote,” thought it was cool.” Item was incinerated after JR Pines´request.\n\n//Note: I was just gonna put it in anomalous storage, but after that quote, it needed to be destroyed. - JR Pines//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1172**\n**Name:** Researcher Miniwa\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One copy of SCP-2085's documentation\n\n//Note: We're starting to run out of the health kits, so I'll avoid testing them for now. - Researcher Miniwa//\n\n**Input:** One copy of SCP-2085's documentation\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One document describing an SCP-2085-A-█. Further analysis shows that the document describes an interview with Researcher Miniwa, with Researcher Miniwa in the position of SCP-2085-A and Veritas interviewing.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1173**\n**Name:** Dr. Cleveland\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Two post-it notes containing a random SCP number, --one-- two 2m by 3m flags of Arkansas, one 2m by 3m flag of Tennessee\n\n//Note: This is a throwback test, going back to my early days. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** One post-it note reading ''2749''.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A paper tie, with the words \"Business Incorporated\" printed on\n\n//Note: I'm not sure if this should be expected in 1:1 or Fine. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** One post-it note reading 1655\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate 10:1 paper model of SCP-1655, theorized to exhibit all of SCP-1665's anomalous effects, sans the ignoring abilities. Neutralized when Dr. Cleveland accidentally slipped over the next intended input (the flag of Arkansas) and crushed the model.\n\n//Note: I'm still fine. Arkansas comes next. Requesting an extra flag, by the way. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** The flag of Arkansas that Dr. Cleveland slipped on\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A flag of Mississippi. Has the anomalous effects of causing any surface it touches to have a coefficient of friction of exactly 0.0001655, making the surface to be exceptionally smooth; and causes all viewers with a cognitohazardous resistance above 73 to ignore the flag's presence. Placed in Anomalous Storage.\n\n**Input:** A flag of Arkansas\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A 2m by 3m map of Little Rock, with locations related to Dr. Cleveland's life highlighted. Of note, the St. Andrew's Anglican Church was highlighted with the words \"On ██/██/2000, a [[[SCP-2852 | White-Level Event]]] happened at the Clevelands. Siblings Richard, Nelson, and Julie were absent that day.\"\n\n//Note: Wait, what the hell? That wedding which I did not attend was a disaster, but SCP-2852? That's a whole new level. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** A flag of Tennessee\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate map of Tennessee and surroundings. Touching the map at points which correspond to a city in metropolitan areas would reveal an inaccuracy: Instead of the target city, the primary city, seemingly annexing neighboring satellite cities, is shown. For example, Memphis now spans the entirety of the east bank of Shelby County, TN and the northern half of DeSoto County, MS; while Nashville, Murfreesboro, and Hendersonville annexed multiple municipalities in Davidson, Rutherford, Williamson, and Summer Counties, the largest of which being Franklin.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1174**\n**Name:** Dr. Beiderman\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** 17 steel plates, 1 copper plate, 1 amethyst crystal, 1 sheet of glass, 1 kg plastic cube, 7 wooden blocks,\n\n//All Samsara testing is concluded.

When activated, the generator will emit previously unknown frequencies of sound, light, seismic and electromagnetic energy, nullifying all sounds, light, Ground movement, and Electromagnetic radiation in an uninterrupted 10 Meter radius. This includes certain high frequency vibrations caused by activation of [[[scp-297 | resonators]]]. No limit has been currently found to the effect, and the object is currently under study.\n\n//Note: I’d normally expect that to be a Very Fine output, but you can’t really expect anything from this thing. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One EMP Generator\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One toy pistol, with a dial on the side. Testing has shown that the gun is capable of firing concentrated blasts of any wave on the electromagnetic spectrum, as well as emit magnetic waves, via an unknown mechanism. This includes previously [[[scp-059 | non-repeatable]]] types of [[[scp-239 | radiation]]], and types seemingly absent on the electromagnetic spectrum. The object is currently under study.\n\n//Note: Two in one test. I suppose they’re at least useful for MTF and containment use. I’m gonna finish moving my stuff into my quarters. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Addendum:** Both objects have been found to be capable of self activation. The pistol has been permanently placed into anomalous storage, using the Counter-Frequency Generator to prevent damage to the surroundings.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1177**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Louis\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch\n\n//Note: I should have introduced myself after my first experiment with 914, so I'm going with this old chestnut. - SR Louis//\n\n**Input:** Items listed above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 5 ███████ brand chocolate Hanukkah gelt, one clockwork dreidel. The dreidel appears to spin indefinitely and has been spinning continuously now for the last 5 hours. The chocolate is described as \"tasty\" but has a cognitohazard that causes those who eat it to sing \"I Have A Little Dreidel” until the chocolate passes out of the consumer's alimentary canal.\n\n//Note: Firstly, does... does 914 know I'm Jewish? Secondly, I'm putting the dreidel in the break room for anyone that wants to play with it. Thirdly, if anyone wishes to try the gelt before I incinerate whatever's left, I recommend having access to a soundproof bathroom and to rehydrate after it gets out of your system. - SR Louis//\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1178**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Louis\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One yarmulke, 1 book titled \"God, No!: Signs You May Already Be an Atheist and Other Magical Tales\" by Penn Jillette\n\n//Note: I'm not religious, but after the last test, I wanted to take it to the next step. The yarmulke was a leftover from a nephew's bar mitzvah. - SR Louis//\n\n**Input:** 1 yarmulke\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 1 helicopter beanie. There are no visible rotors, however, an audible \"whirring\" noise is heard and a slight downward breeze is felt when worn.\n\n//Note: Assuming it passes memetic and cognitohazard scanning, I'm going to keep it.

A programme named //skynet.exe// is currently running.\n\n//Note: Dr. Veritas, who was supervising the test due to the dangers of testing with Artificial Intelligence, attempted to destroy the laptop via repeated application of blunt force with the edge of a table.//\n\n//Note: Calm down, Veritas! - R. Dafydd Lewis//\n\n//Note: The laptop was immediately locked into an Class-Q Electromagnetic Deadzone Containment Vessel.//\n\n**Addendum:** Further testing in an electronically shielded containment chamber revealed //skynet.exe// to simply be a custom-written slideshow programme with images ripped from a pirated working cut of the currently-unreleased 2019 film [REDACTED].\nA voice-activated assistant was also inadvertently discovered when Junior Researcher Kai vocalised \"What else you got in there, mate?\"\nThe assistant appears to be a personification of the T-800 as portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger.\nSearch results made with the Terminator assistant are taken from the Dark Web service [REDACTED]. Due to valuable information initially obtained from the output, it has been contained in Anomalous Storage until further notice.\n\n//Note: Put it into the deepest, darkest corner of Storage, you hear me?

My days of documenting SCPs are long gone and I’d hate to have to write an 079. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n \n**Input:** One above laptop\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One seemingly unchanged laptop. Further testing revealed that the Cortana assistant could accurately retrieve any result vocally asked for, even if the given result cannot be found on the Internet. However, a price will be displayed on the screen and placing the \"payment\" on the keyboard results in the laptop slamming shut rapidly to accept the \"payment\", after which reopening the laptop will display the result of the request. Notably, all accepted \"payments\" anomalously disappear and searches are conducted using the search engine preferred by the user. Due to the possibility of an information breach but taking into account the usefulness of the laptop, it has been locked in Anomalous Storage and is currently only available to personnel with Level 4 Clearance.\n\n**Addendum:** So far, prices listed for various searches have included the following:\n|| Closest McDonald's outlet to Site-19 Facility-23 || One biscuit || [APPROVED] ||\n|| How to style your hair like Brendon Urie || One bottle of hair gel || [APPROVED] ||\n|| When is the next season of One Punch Man coming? || One arm || [DENIED] ||\n|| Senior Researcher Vivic's IQ || One full set of Naruto Shippuden comics || [DENIED] ||\n|| How to style your hair like Dr. Veritas || Five bottles of hairspray, two bottles of conditioner, one bottle of hair gel || [APPROVED] ||\n|| Nudes of Researcher Dafydd Lewis || One litre of blood from your nose after he has punched you || [DENIED] ||\n|| How to destroy SCP-682 permanently || One vial of phoenix tears, three vials of griffin blood, one trunk belonging to an elephant, one head of a hydra, [REDACTED FOR BREVITY] || [DENIED] ||\n\n//Note: The both of you are __this close__ to being suspended from testing. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 118X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 118X Test Logs\"]]\n\n----\n**Test 914-1180**\n**Name:** Researcher Dafydd Lewis\n**Date:** 29/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One copy of ''Fortnite'' for the Xbox One. One copy of ''Minecraft'' for the Xbox One.\n\n**Input:** One copy of ''Fortnite'' for the Xbox One.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --One bin containing a copy of Fortnite.-- Upon further inspection, the output was discovered to actually be a plastic sheet with a cognitohazard on it causing the viewer, depending on their opinion of Fortnite, to either view a garbage bin containing a copy of Fortnite or a golden coloured plastic pedestal with a copy of Fortnite placed on top. Personnel not familiar with the game saw the former.\n\n**Input:** One copy of ''Minecraft'' for the Xbox One.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One unchanged copy of Minecraft.-- Upon further inspection, it was revealed that although the game itself was seemingly unchanged, additional text has been added on the casing and when the game is loaded, the yellow text on the title screen reads \"A gift from God\".\n\n--**Addendum:** Upon starting a new world, the entire room will transform into the world generated where normal Minecraftian physics apply. The console and screen will stay in the world and remain indestructible. The only way to exit the world is to press “Save and Quit” on the screen connected to the console, after which all damage to the environment is then reversed and the room transforms to how it was before. Additionally, death in the game is not permanent as a respawn will occur similar to gameplay in Minecraft. However, if a new game is played on hardcore, the user who died is given two options to either “Save and Quit” or “Spectate”.--\n\n**Addendum:** Once a world has finished “generating”, a cognitohazard appears on screen, causing all viewer to believe that they are in the world of Minecraft. The only two ways to negate the cognitohazardous effects is to either cut the power to the console running the game or for the person to press “Save and Quit” while still under its influence.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1181**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 30/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Three Gibson G45 acoustic guitars\n\n**Input:** A guitar.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A prop of a woodcutter's axe. The handle is comprised of the wood from the guitar's base and neck, while the \"head\" is comprised of the strings and pegs, rendering it flimsy and fragile.\n\n//Note: I've heard of guitars being called \"axes\" before, but come on, 914. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** A guitar.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A 52cm x 52cm x 52cm wooden cube. Each facet has a trapezoidal slot in it with 3 pieces of string. All 18 strings produce a different note; the partially-hollowed interior of the cube amplifies the volume.\n\n//Note: I might have to play around with this later. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** A guitar.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A black acoustic guitar with clockwork designs etched into it. An anomalous property was discovered where holding the guitar compelled the holder to play one of a number of popular 1990's songs on it. A sharp improvement in singing and playing abilities was noticed.\n\n//Note: D-class removed from testing area by security after playing \"The Man Who Sold the World\" 4 times in a row. Prof. Wren moved to transfer the item to anomalous storage.//\n\n//Note: The craftsmanship on this one is exquisite. I would almost swear the gears etched into the design were turning. Anyway, here's Wonderwa— HEY!! -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Item was hauled off by Dr. Veritas via a hook on a pole and incinerated.//\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1182**\n**Name:** Dr. Zavalosa, D-7758\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** 1 Kit-Kat bar, 1 gummy snake, 1 Starburst, 1 rod of licorice, 1 Hubba Bubba Candy tape, 1 Candy Cane, 1 bag of candy corn, 1 Flake Bar, 1 bag of skittles, 1 bar of Cadbury milk chocolate, 1 Jolly Rancher, 1 box of Nerds, 1 Mars bar, 1 Kinder Egg Surprise, 1 Ferrero Rocher, 1 bag of Warheads.\n16 pieces of candy from [[[SCP-330]]], identical copies to the above list.\n\n//Note: In the spirit of Halloween, I have decided to test on candy. The candy from SCP-330 has been, in all sense of the word, harmless; as long as you obey the 2 candy rule. This test aims to see if the candy from 330 is in any way different from commercially bought versions, as well as how 914 reacts to products that are almost identical. Candy from 330 has been taken across 10 days, due to the 2 candy rule. As this is an SCP cross-test, I have gotten approval from Dr. Veritas, and as extra precautions I will not be physically in the test chamber. The setting will be left on Coarse, to disassemble the candy into its ingredients. D-7758, the D-Class that is sent to open the booths, has been warned that changing the setting may lead to death, but has also been promised to receive some of the excess candy on the condition of good behaviour. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n//Note: In the name of brevity, tests that resulted in identical results have been omitted.//\n\n[[table style=\"width: 80%;

However, occasionally some variance occurs which causes more anomalous results. Something of note is that the anomalous results only tend to happen from candy that originated from SCP-330; my theory is that the candy still holds a minute amount of anomalous energy, not enough to cause any harm on consumption, but enough to cause anomalous results, even when refined through 914 on a relatively safe option. - Dr. Zavalosa//\n\n//Note: This concludes this experiment, D-7758 has received the rest of his favourite candy and the remaining excess candy has been placed in the break room to be shared amongst staff members.

Walker, D-20932\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** --Four-- One foam pumpkin prop, five candles, a replica of Darby's coat, four pumpkins\n\n**Input:** One pumpkin and one candle\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One foam jack-o-lantern and one pile of shredded foam. The foam caught fire within a minute and filled the research lab with toxic gas, requiring it to be evacuated and ventilated.\n\n//Note: I was afraid of that. Veritas, I request to use actual pumpkins. - R.A. Walker//\n\n//Note: Have Sedna be there. Use the reinforced cage. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** One pumpkin and one candle\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pumpkin, one pile of pumpkin pulp. The pumpkin has been determined to be nearly empty, containing only a lit candle. When D-20932 attempts to carve it, the carving knife gets stuck, and the handle breaks off. After further testing, the pumpkin was discovered to be impervious to damage. Output incinerated.\n\n**Input:** One pumpkin and one candle\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --A non-anomalous jack-o-lantern-- Subjects who are left present in a dark room with the jack-o-lantern will begin to act paranoid, believing something is watching them. They will describe seeing shadows of various SCPs in the hallway. Sightings of 682 and 939 are among the most commonly reported.\n\n**Input:** One pumpkin and one candle\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A jack-o-lantern that, when viewed, will compel the viewer to pick it up and place it onto their head.\n\n//Note: D-20932 had to be sedated to get the pumpkin off her head. The candle ended up burning her hair. I'm ordering a wig for her as we speak. - R.A. Walker//\n\n**Input:** One replica of Darby's labcoat\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An instance of Darby's labcoat that has several scratches, tears, and scuffs. When put on, others will view the wearer as the real Darby and will attempt to flee. When worn by Darby, no anomalous effects present themselves.\n\n**Input:** One pumpkin and one candle.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate jack-o-lantern with the capacity of displacement (teleportation). It behaves with the intent to frighten victims by teleporting into airducts, behind doors and under desks and screaming when discovered. Captured after causing Dr. Harley cardiac arrest by jumping out of his personal locker. Pumpkin incinerated.\n\n//Note: Harley will make it, fortunately. This is another example why biological testing is a poor idea. - Veritas//\n\n//Note: I don't remember having a fourth pumpkin. That's the strangest part of all this. - R.A. Walker//\n----\n**Test 914-1184**\n**Name:** Dr. Klaus Beiderman, Dr. Zane, Junior Researcher Kai, Intern Roman, Intern Snevets\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Two maple lollipops, two Hershey’s Kisses, two gula melaka candies, two York mint candies, two mellowcrème pumpkins, two Cadbury Cream Eggs, two packs of Skittles, two chocolate raisins, two Peeps marshmallow pumpkins\n\n**Input:** One of each item above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One large sphere of candy, presumably made from inputted sweets. An anomalous effect was discovered afterwards that when someone moves within 3 metres of the sphere, all insulin within the affected person’s body is anomalously converted to an inactive form. Affected persons also begin to display severe symptoms of ADHD, causing excessive usage of available blood sugar and causing hypoglycaemia. D-class personnel who attempted retrieval of the sphere was affected by the sphere and collapsed after attempting multiple physically-exhaustive activities. The sphere has been incinerated.\n\n**Input:** One of each item above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One animate candy humanoid golem. Neutralization was attempted with H2O-9000 by the combined efforts of Dr. Zane and Intern Snevets. The golem broke into shards of candy upon being hit with 25 litres of water. However, when janitors attempted to clean up the mess, the sweets reassembled into the golem and attempted to attack all personnel present. The golem was then discovered to be able to anomalously convert all matter in contact with it into candy, assimilating more than 20kg of candy altogether before it was finally herded by Security Personnel and thrown into incinerator. As a result of this incident, Dr. Zane, Intern Roman and three other non-testing personnel have suffered injuries of various severity and are currently recuperating in the medical bay.\n\n//Note: What. Happened. - Dr. Insano//\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1185**\n**Name:** Guest Engineer Regas\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One cube of steel measuring 0.5m x 0.3m x 0.3m, one blueprint of a prototype candy launcher designed by Regas.\n\n//Note: This is the first time I’m having Halloween outside of Site-98, It’s very awesome seeing everyone’s spirit. - Regas//\n\n**Input:** All of the Above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** The prototype candy launcher detailed in the blueprint, scraps of blueprint paper and pieces of steel.\n\n//Note: With all the stories surrounding 914, I’m truly amazed that it worked first try. I’m going to test this thing out.- Regas//\n\n**Addendum:** The launcher was loaded up with various gobstopper candy pieces and activated. Gobstopper projectiles reached speeds of excess 400km/h which damaged part of the building, the knockback broke the launcher in four pieces and broke both of Guest Engineer Regas' arms.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1186**\n**Name:** Researcher MacLean\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One guide on Thaumaturgy, one guide on Ectomorphic Entities.\n\n//Note: Considering that Halloween is today, I figured I’d get into the spirit with some books on magic and ghosts. - MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One guide on Ectomorphic Entities\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One guide on Demonic, as well as Ectomorphic Entities. The print is much smaller than the original guide.\n\n//Note: I’m going to need a microscope to read this. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One guide on Thaumaturgy\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One updated guide, with improved ritual diagrams and more detailed information on a variety of spells. The spells are often written in a variety of unknown languages.\n\n//Note: Considering the items created are both unusable, I suppose we ought to see what happens if we put them together. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Input:** One guide on Demonic and Ectomorphic Entities, one updated guide on Thaumaturgy\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One complex thaumaturgic rune which caused Researcher MacLean’s shadow to become animate. The rune self-immolated after viewing. The shadow is selectively corporeal, having the ability to pass through walls but is also capable of physically interacting with objects and people. This effect also transfers to whatever it is interacting with, an example being clothes. The shadow is also capable of changing its shape and disguising itself as a regular, non-anomalous shadow. It is sentient, capable of conversation, and completely independent of Researcher MacLean as an entity. Security footage is being studied in order to attempt to recreate and reverse the effects of the rune, while the shadow is currently being studied of its own volition. Researcher MacLean has ceased casting a shadow when exposed to light but otherwise shows no anomalous effects.\nThe shadow dissipated after 24 hours, but the affected’s shadow did not return.\n\n//Note: Not casting a shadow when being exposed to to light really messes up your depth perception. I wouldn't recommend it. - Researcher MacLean//\n\n**Addendum:** The rune has been recreated, and the shadow has been found to re-manifest upon secondary exposure, retaining its memories from previous manifestations. The duration of the effect is cumulative, lasting 12 hours per second of exposure. Study is continuing.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1187**\n**Name:** Intern Snevets\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One plastic skeleton, one Freddy Kruger animatronic Halloween decoration, assorted Halloween-themed baked goods\n\n**Input:** All of the above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A humanoid animatronic, designed to look like a generic baker. Possesses a cognitohazardous effect causing the viewer to believe that a recent baking competition (later found to have not actually occurred) was won by a team made up of nine heavily mutilated corpses. Does not prevent the viewer from realizing how unusual such an event would be.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1188**\n**Name:** Intern Lunar\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One mug\n\n**Input:** The mug\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pumpkin candle holder. Any candle placed inside has a blue flame and does not use fuel.\n\n//Note: Could I keep this? - Intern Lunar//\n\n//Note: After it clears screening, like always. - Veritas//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-1189**\n**Name:** WR Markham\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** One Jackson Pro King V Pro electric guitar, one photo of WR Markham, one photo of all Site-19 Facility-23 staff dated 31/10/2019\n\n//Note: That photo was from 2012, at a Halloween party in Brigham Young University. I was dressed as a vampire. - WR Markham//\n\n**Input:** Electric guitar\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Two ukuleles. Both of them require a power source to be played normally.\n\n//Note: I tried playing ''I Don't Know My Name'' by Grace VanderWaal, but the electric ukuleles just don't sound right. - WR Markham//\n\n**Input:** Photo of WR Markham\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A paper model of WR Markham as a vampire. Notably, the colours on model Markham's clothes were inverted.\n\n**Input:** Photo of all staff\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A photo of all research and administrative personnel in Facility-23 having a buffet dinner in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. With the exception of Junior Researcher Grizzly being labelled as \"Senior Researcher Louise Alma Reimer\", all names were labelled correctly. However, the ranks of all research personnel, sans Engelhart and Lunar, are moved up at least one level.\n\n//Note: It's not an incorrectly labelled name. These days, I've been thinking of adopting a \"real\" identity for myself, instead of being only mononymously known as Grizzly.

When translated, it roughly corresponds to the procedures of creating a conceptually unstable void.\n\n**Input:** Five wine cups\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A rune, broken into five pieces. When combined, it displays a cognitohazard which causes any viewer within two meters to become incorporeal. D-class who assembled the rune immediately fell through the ground and is considered to be lost. Result disassembled by a blindfolded JR Reimer and incinerated.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1192**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Date:** 31/10/2019\n**Total Items:** Five black cotton witch hats\n\n//Note: Happy Hallowe’en, everyone! - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** One witch hat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One model of a cat. --Determined to be non-anomalous.-- Anomalously animates and begins to follow any person who says “abracadabra” within 1 metre of the cat. Effect lasts for approximately 5 minutes, before the cat de-animates. Donated to the break room for recreational purposes.\n\n//Note: Let’s try it... avada kedavra! - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Addendum:** After attempting to smother Junior Researcher Kai when he mispronounced “abracadabra”, the model cat has been incinerated.\n\n**Input:** One witch hat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of child-sized gloves, anomalously disappeared when D-class personnel sent to retrieve it dropped them. On an unrelated note, SCP-239 was noted to have acquired a pair of black cotton gloves as a possibility of her semi-conscious state being aware of the date and changing reality to reflect the Hallowe’en theme. All effects are expected to disappear by the following day.\n\n**Input:** One witch hat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One model of a cat\n\n//Note: Not again. I’m not even going to try and find out what it does. Incinerated. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** One witch hat\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One length of black cotton rope, resembling a common garden snake. Non-anomalous, but stores kinetic and potential energy extremely well. Effect discovered after D-class personnel who attempted to retrieve it dropped it and it bounced off the floor, displaying its abilities to release stored energy in addition to simply storing energy. Incineration has been considered potentially dangerous and all researchers at Facility 19-23 have been warned of the consequences of destroying the incinerator for the third time in one month.\n\n**Input:** One witch hat\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged witch hat. Hume levels around SCP-914 destabilized rapidly after the Output booth opened, normalizing only after the witch hat was donned by the D-class present, who vocalized, “What the [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] is going on? The walls and floor need to stop shaking!” Upon which, Research Cell 109-B became accessible to security personnel stationed outside. D-class was terminated immediately for safety reasons and the witch hat has been incinerated after being determined to be non-anomalous following the incident. It is postulated that the output granted its user minor reality-bending abilities by lowering ambient Hume levels, the effect of which was negated when the terminated D-class personnel subconsciously reduced the Hume differential and restabilized local reality.\n\n\n----\n**Test 914-1193**\n**Name:** Researcher Dafydd Lewis\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:** One large stainless steel bowie knife, one photograph of the weapon \"//Bushwacka//\" from the game \"//Team Fortress 2//\", ten covered mason jars filled with urine\n\n**Input:** One bowie knife, one photograph of the \"Bushwacka\"\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** --A bladed weapon visually identical to the Sniper character’s melee weapon \"//Bushwacka//\".-- One bladed weapon visually identical to the Sniper character’s melee weapon \"//Shahanshah//\", affected by a cognitohazard that causes viewers to believe that it is \"//Bushwacka//\" instead.\n\n//Note: I'm hoping to get// Jarate //from this next test with 914 - R. Dafydd Lewis//\n\n//Note: You’re \"hoping\"? - Dr. Veritas//\n\n**Input:** 10 mason jars filled with urine, 10 mason jar caps\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 10 glass cans visually similar to \"//Bonk!//\", an unlockable secondary weapon for the Scout character\n\n//Note: Researcher Dafydd Lewis appeared highly excited by the output, retrieving one can and draining all of its contents. - J.R. Kai//\n\n//Note: Euurrrgghhhww. - R. Dafydd Lewis//\n\n//Note: Researcher Dafydd Lewis is not allowed to take amnestics for today’s incident to serve as a reminder of appropriate testing behaviour. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1194**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Pines\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:**  One Chicago Police Department (CPD) badge circa 1948 owned by Junior Researcher Pines’ grandfather, detective Clavicus Pines (noted for encountering occult and anomalous entities).\n\n**Input:** Above item\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One antiquated badge of MTF personnel, belonging to one Agent Clavicous, circa 1948 under [REDACTED] Unit.\n\n**Input:** Above output\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually identical badge to the original CPD badge, but upon further analysis, it was found to be a coded ID of Chaos Insurgency agent Clavicous. Upon hearing this, Junior Researcher Pines locked himself in his office for 9 hours and commented upon leaving, ”I slept on it, work must go on.”\nAfter a meeting, on-Site Psychologist Dr. Insano determined Junior Researcher Pines to be in sound working condition and quoting, ”I guess he did sleep on it.”\n\n----\n**Test 914-1195**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Kai\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:** Three photocopies of Dr. Insano’s Master's certificate in Clinical Psychology, original certificate, one bottle of ink\n \n**Input:** One copy of certificate\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One copy of Dr. Insano’s Master's certificate in Veterinary Science\n\n//Note: Alright, we’re on the right track. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** One copy of certificate\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One --genuine-- well-made forgery of a certificate displaying Dr. Insano’s Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology\n\n//Note: It should be noted that Dr. Insano is currently doing his Ph.D. part-time.//\n\n//Note: That’s going straight into the incinerator. - J.R. Kai//\n\n**Input:** One copy of certificate\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One anomalously animated origami caricature of Dr. Insano. Attempted to diagnose Junior Researcher Kai with depression before being neutralized by repeated application of blunt force trauma with a standard-issue Foundation clipboard.\n\n**Input:** Original certificate, one bottle of ink\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One miniature booklet, displaying a revised version of Dr. Insano’s Master's thesis with numerous additions and supporting research, as well as having been cross-referenced by multiple bodies of research. All text is in extremely miniaturized font. One near-empty bottle of ink.\n\n//Note: Has someone been in my office? What happened to my certificate? This is for me? Oh, thank you very much. - Psychological Specialist Richard Insano//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1196**\n**Name:** Senior Researcher Vivic\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:** Seven 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick pieces of oak wood\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One highly detailed 3D model of [REDACTED].\n\n//Note: Those who have observed the output have been treated with amnestics after the object was incinerated.//\n\n//Note: Since I don't remember the first test, I'm just going to try something else. - S.R. Vivic//\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-1 thaumaturgic protection symbol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 0.4m diameter wooden shield with highly intricate and ornate etchings along the edges. Testing shows the shield is completely resistant to all forms of temperature damage and will disperse applied heat into the surrounding environment evenly. Effects were discovered after minor damage was inflicted on the on-Facility incinerator when incineration of the output was attempted.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-2 thaumaturgic protection symbol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 30cm tall highly ornate clockwork grandfather clock that will constantly show the incorrect time and cannot be adjusted.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-3 thaumaturgic protection symbol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Unchanged piece of wood with a hyper-realistic engraving of a Roman shield on its surface. The wood now possesses vastly-increased durability. Incineration took almost three hours, not including the five breaks taken to prevent overheating of incinerator machinery.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-4 thaumaturgic protection symbol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 1m-long wooden sword that allows the user to anomalously block, deflect, or parry any attack directed at the user, including other swords, security batons, bare fists, and even gunfire. The wood, although maintaining its default properties, cannot be damaged while the sword is wielded.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-2 thaumaturgic fire-summoning symbol\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 0.63m^^3^^ wooden block with an ornate carving of curving lines across its surface, furthermore possessing a permanent surface temperature of 15°C.\n\n**Input:** One 0.5m^^2^^ 1cm-thick piece of oak wood inscribed with a Level-2 thaumaturgic ice-summoning symbol\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One 0.3m^^2^^ wooden trapdoor with a wooden latch. The surface of the trapdoor feels cold to the touch, even if its temperature is measured to be constantly at room temperature. The entire object can be moved with ease until the trapdoor is opened by pulling its latch. The trapdoor, through anomalous means, turns into a spatial or dimensional gateway when opened, leading into an unknown location with temperatures exceeding 950°C. Notably, the atmosphere with these temperatures does not pass through the trapdoor frame.\n\n**Addendum:** While further investigation led by junior researchers has postulated that the trapdoor leads to biblical Hell, this has been shown not to be the case. Within the location is a visible surface of grass approximately 5m below the opening of the trapdoor, every time it is opened. Heat-resistant camera systems have given photographs taken of the \"sky\" within the location, showing a massive star extremely close to the surface of the location. With this knowledge, it is theorized that the doorway leads to a different solar system than Sol.\n\n----\n**Test 914-1197**\n**Name:** Dr. Synd\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:** One deck of Rider-Waite tarot cards (shuffled before each test), five notes hand-written by Dr. Synd\n\n//As a qualified anomalous tarot practitioner, I find the possibility of 914 being able to understand the cards intriguing. I’m not expecting it to predict the future or anything, but we might still get some interesting data. Note that before each test I will shuffle the deck while focusing on the question, as is standard practice. Hopefully, this will get my intent across to 914. – Dr. Synd//\n\n**Input:** One shuffled tarot deck, one note from Dr. Synd reading “A general three-card reading for Dr. Cinder Synd”\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The deck of cards, with three removed and placed face-up on the floor on the input booth. The cards drawn are the Fool (upright), the Wheel of Fortune (upright), and the Knight of Cups (reversed). The note is missing.\n//Note: So that’s the start of a journey, some good luck, and then emotional turbulence & moodiness? Interesting. What this does prove is that 914 can at least make an attempt at reading the cards. I’m going to do some readings for some SCP objects, see if we can learn anything. – Dr. Synd//\n\n**Input:** One shuffled tarot deck, one note from Dr. Synd reading “A general three-card reading for SCP-682”\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The same as the previous test, albeit with three different cards removed from the deck. The cards are the Devil (upright), the Ten of Swords (reversed), and the Page of Pentacles (reversed).\n\n//Note: Feeling trapped, then recovery, then learning from past mistakes. That’s a good representation of 682. 914 isn’t a bad card reader. From here on, I’ll only record what cards it draws unless something else happens. – Dr. Synd//\n\n**Input:** One shuffled tarot deck, one note from Dr. Synd reading “A general three-card reading for SCP-1048\"\n//Note: We still don’t know where that bear is. Can 914 give us any hints? – Dr. Synd//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The Sun (upright), the Ten of Pentacles (upright), and the Page of Wands (upright).\n\n//Note: Positivity, long-term success, and inspiration? I’m concerned that this means that 1048 is plotting something. It would have been nice if 914 had told us where it was, but at least we can be kind of prepared. – Dr. Synd//\n\n**Input:** One shuffled tarot deck, one note from Dr. Synd reading “A general three-card reading for SCP-914”\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** No change.\n//Note: Figures. – Dr. Synd//\n\n**Input:** One shuffled tarot deck, one note from Dr. Synd reading “A general three-card reading for SCP-055”\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** All of the cards were wiped blank and were subsequently lost.\n\n//Note: Further readings are suspended until I get 914 its own deck, so I don't lose another of mine. - Dr. Synd//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1198**\n**Name:** Guest Researcher Derrick\n**Date:** 01/11/2019\n**Total Items:** One plastic sword, one plastic “king” crown\n\n//Note: Some leftover stuff from Halloween I wanted to run through. - GR Derrick//\n\n**Input:** One plastic sword\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One plastic vambrace that has the same mass as the input. When worn, it changes shape to match the wearer’s arm and enables them to morph the vambrace into the sword. When the sword is dropped, it turns back into the vambrace.\n\n//Note: The sword is still plastic, so I’d advise against hitting something with it. Still makes for a great costume item, but not worth the risk. In storage. - GR Derrick//\n\n**Input:** One plastic “king” crown\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One plastic “queen” crown. Visually --feminine.-- --worthy of a queen.--\n\n//Note: There is a cognitohazard on the crown that causes anyone to view it to describe it as a queen's crown, despite it being the exact same visually. - GR Derrick//\n\n----\n**Test 914-1199**\n**Name:** Intern Roman\n**Date:** 05/11/2019\n**Total Items:** Five spools of copper wire from a hardware store near Site-19\n\n//Note: Rough and Coarse tests were redacted for brevity. - Intern Roman//\n\n**Input:** One of the above spools\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A spool of copper wire made by [REDACTED], a Foundation front company.\n\n**Input:** One of the above spools\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A spool of thinner copper wire. Testing has shown it to be significantly more electrically conductive than normal wire.\n\n**Input:** One of the above spools\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A copper sphere, capable of floating through anomalous means. There is a small raised circle on one side, always facing towards the person it is following. The sphere will follow any person it passes until the person it is following passes someone else, at which point it turns to face and follow them instead. Placed in a lockbox in anomalous storage.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[/experiment-log-914/offset/11 Notice: Continued in 12XX ->]",
