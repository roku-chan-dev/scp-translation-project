To prevent unintentional alteration of this document, do not proceed unless accessing this page from an approved Site.\n\n-- Dr. Jaskes, Senior Researcher\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n> You are currently accessing this document from: {{##red|**Site-01**##}}.\n> ##33cc00|Access approved##, retrieving document...\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 4870\n|clearance= 1\n|container-class= euclid\n|secondary-class= none\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= notice\n]]\n----\n**Special Containment Procedures:** No iteration of this file is allowed on Site-17 servers at this time. All documentation pertaining to SCP-4870 may only be accessed on different Sites' servers until further notice. Moreover, data servers at Site-17 are to be modified with a unique digital signature that will prohibit access to documents that could potentially be modified by SCP-4870.\n\nAll SCP-4870-1 instances discovered are to be destroyed or reverted to unaffected iterations if possible. Research into the cause of SCP-4870 is still underway and any discoveries on the subject are to be brought to Dr. Jaskes' attention at once. All potential research inquiries regarding the Neutralization of SCP-4870 are to be considered, as no current means to do so has yet been found.\n\nIf found, SCP-4870-2 is to be contained at once. Due to the unknown and potentially hazardous nature of SCP-4870-2, extreme caution is to be exercised during this process.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4870 is a phenomenon affecting Site-17 by which the content of certain documents physically present or digitally accessed at the Site, thereafter designated SCP-4870-1, have a chance of being anomalously altered to include text suggesting the existence of a specimen of //Gopherus Polyphemus//[[footnote]]Gopher Tortoise.[[/footnote]], designated SCP-4870-2, at or near Site-17.\n\nDocuments susceptible to SCP-4870 commonly share one or more of the following attributes:\n* Cover topics of or relating to herpetology[[footnote]]The scientific study of turtles and tortoises.[[/footnote]] or chelonian entities   \n* Directly name or refer to Site-17\n* Are written or compiled before 1998\n* Contain the words 'substantially,' 'densest,' or 'subterranean'\n\nThe contents of SCP-4870-1 “write-ins” are minor, consisting of brief mentions of SCP-4870-2, phrased in a way that makes the writer appear fond of SCP-4870-2 and refer to it in a positive manner.\n\nBeyond the text added by SCP-4870, the original content of SCP-4870-1 instances remains unaltered. Digital records, printed text, and even handwriting is subject to SCP-4870's effects if they should meet the above conditions. (See Addendum 4870-A) Susceptible documents are affected at a rate of an average of three documents per week, though the changes appear to be made instantaneously.\n\nTo date SCP-4870-2 has not been discovered, if it indeed exists.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n{{**You are viewing an archived version of this file.\nClick [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4870/offset/1|here]]] to view its most recent iteration.**}}\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
