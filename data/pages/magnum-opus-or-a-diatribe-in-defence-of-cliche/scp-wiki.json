It had seemed such a good idea. \"Containment of Narrative Entities Through Recursive Storylines.\" He'd devised an ominous antagonist, too, and a perfect setting. It would have been beautiful.\n\nHe leans back in his chair, and a heartfelt sigh escapes his lips. The world had no sense of justice, that was the real problem. In a story it would have worked. The struggle to contain the unknown, the chasing of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-423 Fred] through layers and layers of story until he finally submitted, the triumph of good over evil. There was no plot to the universe.\n\nUnless, of course...\n\nHe jerks forward, mind spinning. He'd written about a metafictional entity, right? Something that could trap SCP-423 in an endless network of ever-more-complex narrative. So the plot, from their point of view, would be hunting him down. The chase, //that// was the tension, the inevitable submission the enemy.\n\nExcept he'd been bloody stupid, hadn't he. He hadn't written a hero, a Foundation agent who could fight for the good of humanity, he'd gone and written a goddamn //antagonist//.\n\nThunder crashes outside, and the doctor jumps to his feet. He runs to the window and throws back the curtains. Darkness. A cold sweat breaks on his forehead as he hears the floorboards behind him creak. Floorboards? No, not floorboards, not floorboards at all.\n\nStone, hard and wet and so very, //very// cold.\n\nHe feels a hand on his shoulder, and a voice in his ear.\n\n**{{//\"Hello doctor.\"//}}**\n\nThe triumph of good over evil is a played out trope, but still. Cliches are cliched for a reason, right?\n\n**{{//\"It's me, doctor. It's Fred. I have a question for you.\"//}}**\n\nTime seemed to stand still as the two men, writer and written, stared into the fire.\n\n**{{//\"Won't you tell me a tale?\"//}}**\n\nAnd so the tale began.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
