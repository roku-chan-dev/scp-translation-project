However, SCP-8036 has agreed to willingly remain in the city of Puerto Montt, Chile, near Site-53, on the conditions that it receives a regular audience and remains open to the public. Bi-weekly attendance to SCP-8036 is mandatory for all Class-C and Class-D personnel at Site-53.\n\nSpecial Task Force Zeta-C2 (\"Film Buffers,\") formerly assigned to observe, research, and propose potential long-term containment measures for SCP-8036, has been formally disbanded. In the event that SCP-8036 relocates away from Puerto Montt, Field Agent Marcela Reale must be dispatched within seven days to negotiate its return. SCP-8036 is expected to demand additional patronage during negotiations, and the Foundation has authorized patronage demands to be met unconditionally. If further demands are made, Site Director Caroline Vasquez must report to the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8036 is a 29,000-square meter, two-story, 1880-guest capacity modern movie theater, operating under the name \"Living Pictures Theater.\" It is comprised of one lobby, two concession stands, an arcade space with four games, two restrooms, and eight auditoriums[[footnote]] Seven standard and one //IMAX//. [[/footnote]].  Notably absent are any employee-only areas, kitchens, storage areas, or access points to upstairs projection rooms. SCP-8036 has remained in one fixed location since August 9th, 2016. However, prior to Foundation intervention, the theater would spontaneously de-manifest every Tuesday at exactly 12:00 A.M. relative to its initial location's time zone, re-manifesting in a new, seemingly random location and changing its film and concession offerings in the process. Following Foundation intervention, while SCP-8036 has not yet re-located, its films and concessions still change along the same schedule.\n\nWhile SCP-8036 typically shows at least one film per week in line with other international theaters[[footnote]] Such films hereafter referred to as \"normative.\" [[/footnote]], it primarily shows films which are otherwise non-existent, unfinished, or cancelled.\n\nHumanoid entities acting as \"employees\" of SCP-8036 exist throughout the building. These entities have not been observed cycling through shifts, entering, or exiting, and appear to spontaneously manifest and de-manifest as needed. \"Employee manifestations\" freely admit to being mere components of SCP-8036, as opposed to independent actors in their own right. By speaking through these \"employees,\" SCP-8036 has demonstrated itself both sentient and sapient. Generally, SCP-8036 is compliant and amicable, but it has demonstrated extreme resistance to explaining its own anomalous properties or to undergoing extended observation.\n\nThe first stage of Foundation intervention took place from June 7, 2016 to July 11, 2016. Initially, a single tracking beacon was planted behind a trash can in SCP-8036's front lobby, both to see whether SCP-8036's change in location could be effectively tracked and to see whether items left in the building remain after a relocation event. When this experiment proved successful, Foundation agent Marcela Reale was tasked with repeatedly staying in one of SCP-8036's lobbies overnight during relocation events, tracking its movement, interviewing its \"employee\" manifestations when possible, and documenting its film and concession offerings. The results of this experiment can be seen in Report 8036.\n\n= [[collapsible show=\"+ View Report 8036-A: Week One\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **WEEK ONE: JUNE 7 - 13**\n----\n**Location:** Vancouver, Canada\n= [[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 44%;\"]]\nFilms Available:\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles:\nOut of the Shadows//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nNormative; Action/Adventure Comedy.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//Alice Through the Looking Glass//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nNormative; Fantasy Adventure.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//X-Men: Apocalypse//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nNormative; Superhero/Action.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//The Day the Clown Cried//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nUnreleased/Cancelled; Historical Drama.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//Forest House:\nThe House is a Forest//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Comedy.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//Pill Bug Penny//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Animation.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n//Rapid Onset Parachute Failure//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nUnknown/Nonexistent; Horror.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n**Concessions:** Buttered Popcorn, Hot Dogs, Nachos, Soft Drinks, Chocolate-Covered Raisins, Fruit-Flavored Candies, Frozen Broccoli Florets, Baked Beans.\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Transcript: Audio Log 8036-A-A**\n\n**Date:** June 7, 2016\n\n**Agent on Scene:** Marcela Reale\n\n**Subject:** SCP-8036 - \"Box Office Employee\" Manifestation\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**SCP-8036:** Hi, there!

First, this movie theater is //one sapient entity,// or at the very least behaves like one. There's no way for me to be sure, of course, but I honestly don't think it's lying to me about anything - it seems to be pretty upfront about what it is, even if it's disappointingly hesitant to answer the \"how\" question. Maybe that'll get better with time?\n\nThe good news is, it buys my cover story completely, and it's probably not going to be very difficult to get it to talk in the near future. The bad news is, there's no way I'm going to be able to sleep in the lobby Tuesday night without it realizing what I'm doing. I'm going to have to figure out some way to spin that.\n\nI've got seven days before this place jumps again, and I want to try to watch all seven of its current movies in this time. So far, I've seen //The Day the Clown Cried//, which made //me// cry, and //Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows//, which there was nothing wrong with. Nothing the Foundation would be interested in, I mean. It's a //bad// movie.\n\nTouch back soon!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Journal Log: Marcela Reale**\n\n**June 10, 2016**\n\nHey, it's Marcela again.

I'm having a lot of fun.\n\nI've now watched two of the titles we can't find anywhere else - //Pill Bug Penny// and //Rapid Onset Parachute Failure.// Both were... charmingly amateur? I don't know how else to say it; they felt like they were made by somebody who really loves movies but hasn't had any formal schooling in the craft. The edit was sloppy, the dialogue a bit stiff, but everything came across //earnest.// Really funny, too. I think the theater might be making them on its own, somehow.\n\nI'm halfway to Tuesday. I think I'm just going to have to be straightforward with it; let it know I want to stay the night and travel with it.

Who benefits from our interference on SCP-8036? Is our role here to incarcerate that which is dangerous, or is it merely to hide that which we cannot yet explain? And why is it so difficult to accept that there may be a difference?\n\nSCP-8036's anomalous properties pose no clear threat to itself, the Foundation, or humanity. With that in mind, all containment procedures are now unauthorized. I understand some may question my authority to make this decision. To them I would like to say: it was difficult enough for you to find one person willing to run this place; I don't think you want to risk having to go for a second.\n\nAll of us here, to varying extents, love that which is alien to us. You almost have to, to dedicate your life to the Foundation's cause. The only difference I see between Agent Reale and the rest of us is that, in her case, the love is reciprocal.\n\nI'm very happy for you, Marcela. Please never make me pull something like this again.\n\n-- Caroline Vasquez, Director, Site-53\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8035]]] | SCP-8036 | [[[SCP-8037]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Dolby_Cinema_in_Hilversum.jpg\n> **Name:** Dolby Cinema in Hilversum\n> **Author:** Thomasmachtel\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dolby_Cinema_in_Hilversum.jpg\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
