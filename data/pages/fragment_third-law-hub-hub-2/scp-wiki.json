Because so many other articles lean on the worldbuilding established in these pages, reading them can make it easier to understand the rest of the canon.\n\n* **[[[internal-document-34|ABRAXAS GROUP INTERNAL DOCUMENT #34]]]** -- Welcome to the largest Nälkä-run below-veil corporation! Don't mind the screams of pain, that's just our newest //Kiraak//. //Written by Letova//\n* **[[[new-atlantis|New Atlantis, Arizona]]]** -- New Atlantis is an Atlantean colony located in the State of Arizona, and the capital of their revived civilization. //Written by GreenWolf and ch00bakka//\n* **[[[NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca]]]** -- The GOC fights to take control of \"Other London\", a Victorian-era asteroid colony populated by anarcho-syndicalists. //Written by Tsercele//\n* **[[[Operation LLEWYN DARK]]]** -- When a contractual mind control satellite run by demons is struck down by a meteoroid, it's up to the Foundation to do some emergency maintenance. //Written by Taffeta//\n* **[[[preliminary-report |Preliminary Report of J. C. Randall...]]]** -- In 1927, Doctor John Carver Randall led a team of experts on an expedition to explore the multiverse. They never returned. //Written by GreenWolf//\n* **[[[SCP-3457| SCP-3457 - The Rite of Solomon]]]** -- The wisdom of Solomon was unmatched among mortal men. The Foundation seeks to keep it that way. //Written by ChaoSera//\n* **[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-246|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-246]]]** -- The Foundation's undersea facility located beneath the freshwater sea of Lake Superior, now greatly reduced from its former glory days. //Written by GreenWolf//\n* **[[[site anvil|Secure Planet Dossier: Site Anvil]]]** -- An interstellar colonization effort seeks to safeguard humanity from total destruction. Ideally, humanity will never find out. //Written by GreenWolf and TyGently//\n* **[[[To Be Noir Not To Be]]]** -- There are only two things I hate about this job. The plasma cannon cleanups and the fanfiction reading. //Written by Taffeta//\n* **[[[paramax|UIU Location Dossier — \"Paramax\"]]]** -- Paramax is not the most secure prison in the world, but only because it exists outside of space. //Written by GreenWolf//\n* **[[[three-portlands-hub|UIU Location Dossier — \"Three Portlands\"]]]** -- Three Portlands is an independent city-state and the largest paranormal enclave adjacent to the Western Hemisphere. //Written by GreenWolf//\n* **[[[paralaw|UIU Memorandum — Paralaw Briefing]]]** -- The secret laws of the Veil, and how the American government deals with it. //Written by Greenwolf//\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n[[# extcon]]\n+++ Extended Continuity\n[[/=]]\n\nThese are worldbuilding pieces from outside the canon, but which still provide useful background information. Some of them are in Hard Continuity with Third Law, part of the larger extended continuity of the canon, while others only provide influence and inspiration as Soft Continuity.\n\n* **[[[about-deer|About Deer College]]]** -- //Written by ch00bakka// -- Deer College exists in Third Law in much the same form as it is presented on this page, although certain worldbuilding details and references to other canons are not incorporated.\n* **[[[a-brief-explanation-on-demonics|A Brief Explanation of Demonics]]]** -- //Written by AJMansfield// -- The history presented in this article is incompatible with Third Law, but the mechanics of demonics have been adopted from it for use in the canon.\n* **GOC Lectures on Thaumatology** -- //Written by DrClef// -- Third Law borrows the magic system of Unified Thaumatology from the GOC Casefiles with minimal alteration, and the first three lectures in this series provide the canonical framework for how thaumaturgy works within Third Law.\n * **[[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology|Transcript of a lecture given by Professor ████████████ on Applied Thaumatology.]]]**\n * **[[[goc-supplemental-arad|Transcript of a lecture given by Professor ████████████ on Aetheric Energy and Aspect Radiation.]]]**\n * **[[[goc-supplemental-thaumworkings|Transcript of a lecture given by Professor ████████████ on Thaumatic Workings.]]]**\n* **[[[SCP-4661| SCP-4661 - Sin City]]]** -- //Written by Rounderhouse// -- Undervegas exists as a location within Third Law, although it may not exactly match the version of Undervegas described in this article. The broad strokes are largely the same, but specific details and events are likely to differ.\n* **[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-64]]]** -- //Written by Jacob Conwell// -- As a prominent location in our sister canon of Those Twisted Pines, Site-64 naturally exists within Third Law, with few differences prior to 2024.\n\n[[/div]]",
