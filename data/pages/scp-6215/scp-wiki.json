Access is to be granted to Level 2 personnel or higher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6215 refers to an anachronistic cotton shirt, recovered in a tomb outside of Tepi, Ethiopia during an unrelated archeological dig. While carbon dating has placed the age of SCP-6215 at 282,000 years old, the style and manufacturing of SCP-6215 is in line with modern day industry practices.\n\nOn the front of SCP-6215 is an image alongside text. The image depicts a stylized cartoon snake coiled around the base of a date palm tree, whose leaves are noticeably wilted. The text is written in a previously unknown proto-Sabaean language. Translation efforts are ongoing.\n\n**Addendum.1:** Since initial containment on 01/11/1974, several objects of similar age and anachronistic properties have been identified by the Foundation, including near-identical copies of SCP-6215. A selection has been presented below.\n\n||~ Designation ||~ Location of Recovery ||~ Description ||\n|| SCP-6215-1 || Templo Mayor, Mexico || Several plastic rings molded together to form a ball. Small aluminum half-spheres are embedded in each ring. When left unattended, SCP-6215-1 will float one meter above the ground.||\n|| SCP-6215-21 || Dead Sea, Jordan || A stuffed plush snake with plastic eyeballs. When squeezed, SCP-6215-21's eyes will bulge out of its body, emitting a hissing vocalization through unknown means.||\n|| SCP-6215-78 || Yangtze River, China || A single-use plastic cup in the shape of a half-bitten apple. Analysis of the item's interior have detected trace amounts of a liquid identical to that of Coca-Cola.||\n\nThe Foundation estimates the number of these items to be approximately 1,400. Containment efforts are ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6214]]] | SCP-6215 | [[[SCP-6216]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
