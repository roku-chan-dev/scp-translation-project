Threat Entities are named using the following format:\n* A three-letter code indicating threat category.\n* A unique casefile number.\n* One or more codeword descriptors.\n* An informal description of the threat entity.\n\nEXAMPLE: **KTE-7912-Spiral-Blackchild:** \"Alternate Dimension Portal, Cornwall.\" \nThe nomenclature indicates that this is a Known Threat Entity (**KTE**), casefile number 7912, that it is both a localized space-time rupture (codeword **Spiral**), and that it was created by a demi-deity (codeword **Black** [demi-deity], modifier **-child** [paranormal artifact created by]).\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Common Codewords]]\nThis list represents only a sampling of the several hundred codewords used for Threat Classification. For an expanded list of codewords and their definitions, please consult your [[[https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/collab:goc-codewords|PHYSICS Division handbook]]].\n\n**International Files:**\n \n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-implantation-fr Supplemental Information: French GOC Division] (translated)\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/goc-far-east-orientation Supplemental Information: GOC Far East Division] (translated)\n\n[!--\nIn out of universe terms:\n\nThe following list of codewords represents codewords that appear on SCP-EN at least once. Any codewords that do not appear on SCP-EN are not listed. To add a codeword to the following list, leave a comment in the discussion with the page in question with the codeword. Codewords that are not referenced on the SCP-EN Wiki will not be accepted.\n\nThe purpose of this list is to be descriptive, not prescriptive. It is only concerned with fully indexing extant codewords on SCP-EN, rather than being a coherent in-universe document. Codewords from -INT sites have not been listed.\n\nIdeas for codewords -- regardless of type -- can be found at the sandbox link above. The above sandbox is fully open to collaborative edits. If you are a writer looking for a codeword not on this list, consider checking the sandbox to see if anyone has come up with a codeword for your concept, or if it already has been defined by an -INT site!\n--]\n\n+ Humanoid\nHumanoid Threat Entities are broadly classified using a color-based classification system.

been clearly identified as Threats and slated for response. \n\n**In-Document Files:**\n[[collapsible show=\"Access KTE-0706-Black\" hide=\"Hide KTE-0706-Black\"]]\n__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-0706-Black \"Subject Able\"\n\n__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 4 (Severe Threat)\n\n__**Description:**__ Component Able is a humanoid threat entity, apparently in its late twenties, approximately 2m tall, weighing approximately 80kg. Subject normally dresses in a manner adorned with demonic imagery, and prefers black leather clothing. In addition to the standard full suite of superhuman abilities (Strength, Speed, and Regeneration, all at Class 1 or higher) Subject possesses the ability to manifest bladed weapons from an unknown source. Subject is highly skilled in close combat, and appears to use an unknown martial combat style that is not currently on record.\n\nPsychological profile indicates that Subject is primarily motivated by ennui: Subject appears to derive satisfaction only from the act of killing, especially if said acts are carried out against a \"worthy foe.\" Subject always appears to engage the most dangerous perceived threat first, and will bypass lesser threats to do so: Operatives should take this into consideration when preparing a plan of action.\n\nComponent Baker is an engraved stone cube 3.66m (12ft) on a side, sealed with 21 locks (one large lock surrounded by twenty smaller locks in a circle). Component Baker-Two is contained within, and comprises a 2.13m (7ft) tall stone coffin, secured with chains of unknown composition. Component Baker-Two is capable of regenerating Component Able from any remains, and of reforming it should all remains be destroyed. As stated above, Component Baker is to be considered the primary threat and should be secured as soon as possible.\n\n__**Rules of Engagement:**__ KTE-0706-Black (hereafter referred to as Subject) comprises two components. Component Able is to be engaged with extreme caution: entity is a highly lethal combatant and has caused the deaths of over one hundred operatives to date. Component Able is never to be engaged at close range, but from as great a distance as possible. Headshot by sniper is the preferred method of termination.\n\nUpon termination, Component Able will begin to reform inside Component Baker, returning to full threat efficacy within several weeks. For this reason, locating and destroying Component Baker is necessary for complete liquidation of the Subject. Operatives who have information leading to the discovery of the location of Component Baker are to immediately report said information to GOC High Command.\n\n__**History:**__ <CLASSIFIED LEVEL Q BY ORDER OF GOC HIGH COMMAND>\n\n-----\n\n__**Appendix 001:**__ Field Operatives indicate that KTE-0706-Black is currently in the hands of the Foundation. Operatives are hereby ordered to focus all efforts upon that Organization to locate and recover Component Baker.\n\n__**Appendix 002:**__ Per Field Report from Operative Crane, Coalition Operatives are hereby advised that the Foundation has begun fielding Component Able in combat situations, supported by a six to twelve-man support squad. \n\n__**Appendix 003:**__ Due to unacceptable casualties in the last three engagements with Threat Force Able, all Field Operatives are to cease and desist engaging Component Able under any circumstances save self-defense. Operatives are to refocus efforts upon locating and destroying Component Baker.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access KTE-0937-Velveteen\" hide=\"Hide KTE-0937-Velveteen\"]]\n__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-0937-Velveteen \"Sixth Chair\"\n\n__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 3 (Moderate Threat)\n\n__**Description:**__ Several kg of material comprising primarily of oak splinters and upholstery. Previously a chair made of oak and leather in the shape of a reclining female. Type III spatial transit entity.\n\n__**Rules of Engagement:**__ To be engaged only by deep cover operatives. Object is extremely hostile to the Coalition and its agents. Object is to be destroyed by incineration if the chance arises.\n\n__**History:**__ Initially one of a set of six matching objects originally constructed by KTE-7201-Pygmalion (\"The Carpenter\") as a gift to [IDENTITY REDACTED]. Classified a Second Mission threat in ââââ. Creator, customer, and artifacts were all liquidated by a GOC Field Operator cell. All other objects were successfully incinerated: KTE-0937-Velveteen was disposed of by maceration after a mechanical failure in the incinerator device. Artifact proceeded to escape through teleportation, and has since been responsible for the deaths of several agents. Believed to currently be in the possession of The Foundation.\n\n__**Addendum:**__ \n\n> KTE-0937-Velveteen is an object lesson in the importance of following proper operating procedure. Due to the lack of vigilance by the agent on the scene, the object's threat level was escalated, the object itself was not successfully disposed of, and it has since fallen into the hands of a hostile agency. A single failure by a single operative resulted in the deaths of six. Remember this the next time you think about cutting corners.\n> \n> -- Assistant Director \"Kipling\"\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access KTE-1181-Plague-Grey\" hide=\"Hide KTE-1181-Plague Grey\"]]\n__**Threat ID:**__ KTE-1181-Plague-Grey \"Infectious Slime Mould\"\n\n__**Authorized Response Level:**__ 3 (Moderate Threat)\n\n__**Description:**__ A yellow-green myocetezoan protist. Life cycle begins as a single-cell ameboid which normally feeds upon bacteria and other protists. Upon encountering another member of the same species, the organisms will mate and then form a plasmodia that will then expand, consuming all food matter it encounters. When all available food matter has been consumed, organism will solidify, form sporangia (fruiting bodies), and release spores, which hatch into single-cell ameboids, resuming the life cycle. \n\nOrganism's designation as a parathreat is due to its behavior upon encountering human brain tissue. Should the ameboid cross the brain-blood barrier and enter the brain, it will begin feeding upon human glial cells and replace human brain tissue with the plasmodia substrate. Secondary plasmodia will migrate through the blood stream to the skin pores, at which point the organism will form structures similar to sporangia which will begin producing a pheremone-like substance. \n\nThe host body will then be compelled to travel to a public space, whereupon the pheremones will attract other humans to its current location. Upon detecting a sufficient number of human hosts within a particular distance, organism will then begin to reproduce at an exponential rate, building up pressure within the skull until the host body's cranium bursts, spreading spores and plasmodia and infecting all nearby human hosts, resuming the life cycle.\n\n__**Rules of Engagement:**__ Infected hosts are to be terminated by gunfire and the host bodies disposed of by incineration. Avoid head-shots, as this may result in premature detonation of the subject's cranium and cause the infection to spread. The preferred method of termination is by a long-distance precision gunshot to the heart by a marksman: should close-quarters combat be required, all operatives are to be issued MOPP gear and placed in quarantine for a period of no less than 72 hours following the operation. \n\nShould the infection escalate to the point where it threatens to spread from the quarantine zone, escalation to Response Level 4 is authorized. At this point, the entire quarantine zone should be sealed off and sanitized by incineration. Any persons attempting to leave the quarantine zone will be terminated by gunfire followed by sanitization by incineration.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**External Files:**\n \n[[[kte-0154-blackwood-gorgon| Access KTE-0154-Blackwood-Gorgon]]]\n[[[kte-2013-kapala-mendes |Access KTE-2013-Kapala-Mendes]]]\n[[[scp-1000 |Access KTE-2231-Fuji]]]\n[[[kte-2957-white-cresentchild| Access KTE-2957-White-Cresentchild]]]\n[[[project-roc-part-1|Access KTE-4503-Ragweed-Faraday]]]\n[[[KTE-5503-Bice-Copernicus|Access  KTE-5503-Bice-Copernicus]]] \n[[[kte-5634-ex-machina-bosch|Access KTE-5634-Ex-Machina-Bosch]]]\n[[[kte-6024-blit-nuntius|Access KTE-6024-Blit-Nuntius]]]\n[[[kte-6990-mendel-nimuebusterchild|Access KTE-6990-Mendel-Nimuebusterchild]]]\n[[[scp-7609| Access KTE-7609-Ochre-Egochild]]]\n[[[kte-9817-bluebuster-mendel-shelley-renegade-armbrusteri| Access KTE-9817-Bluebuster-Mendel-Shelley-Renegade-Armbrusteri]]]\n\n\n**International Files:** \n\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/nx-146 |Access KTE-131-PARALLAX-ROBURG]]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/kte-0369-elec-focorona |Access KTE-0369-Elec-FoCorona]]]\n[[[http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/kte-0934-einherjar-goodrickchild|Access KTE-0934-Einherjar-Goodrickchild]]]\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/ms-voice |Access KTE-1056-Kringle]]]\n[[[http://ja.scp-wiki.net/kte-1229-flint-jp |Access KTE-1229-Flint]]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/kte-1334-parallax-spiral|Access KTE-1334-Parallax-Spiral]]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/kte-1357-smitty |Access KTE-1357-Smitty]]]\n[[[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/edp-1504-bibelot-burnoutenfant-ebbinghaus |Access KTE-1504-Trinket-Burnoutchild-Ebbinghaus]]]\n[[[http://ja.scp-wiki.net/kte-1505-corona |Access KTE-1505-Corona]]]\n[[[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/edc-1742-fidji-bercemorphe |Access KTE-1742-Fiji-Hogweedmorph]]]\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/kte-1819-black-untouchable-blit |Access KTE-1819-Black-Untouchable-Blit]]]\n[[[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/kte-2272-hogweed-van-allen-viridi|Access KTE-2272-Hogweed-Van Allen-Viridi]]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/kte-3163-ex-machina-l-engle-incubator |Access KTE-3163- Ex Machina L'Engle Incubator]]]\n[[[http://ja.scp-wiki.net/kte-3317-green-sunset |Access KTE-3317-Green-Sunset]]]\n[[[http://ko.scp-wiki.net/operation-fox-hunting-1 |Access KTE-3724-Blue-Lerna]]]\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/kte-3770-ex-machina-pigmalion Access KTE-3770-Ex Machina-Pygmalion] (Translated)\n[[[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/kte-3854-plaga-burrhus-lovelock |Access KTE-3854-Plague-Burrhus-Lovelock]]]\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/kte-3930-ex-machina-bosch-sunset Access KTE-3930-Ex Machina-Bosch-Sunset \"Sunset\"] (Translated)\n[[[http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/kte-7881-staple-spiral-holistic-tardischild |Access KTE-7881-Staple-Spiral-Holistic-Tardischild]]]\n[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/kte-7883-velveteen-gris Access KTE-7883-Velveteen-Grey] (Translated)\n[[[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/kte-8926-negro-parallax-morfo |Access KTE-8926-Black-Parallax-morph]]]\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/kte-767-ko |Access KTE-767-KO-Blackwood-Untouchable-Blue]]]\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/kte-961-ko |Access KTE-961-KO-Blaeka-Clockwork-Pod]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab UTE: Unknown Threat Entity]]\nUnknown Threat Entities are those parathreats whose existence can be inferred, but whose identity has not been positively established.\n\n**External Files:**\n\n[[[ute-1666-goodrick-freud| Access UTE-1666-Goodrick-Freud]]] \n[[[ute-1919-discofather|Access UTE-1919-Discofather]]]\n[[[ute-2077-tiercel-buster|Access UTE-2077-Blue-Tiercel-Buster]]]\n[[[ute-9839-templum-ebbinghaus|Access UTE-9839-Templum-Ebbinghaus]]]\n\n**International Files:**\n\n[[[https://scpko.wikidot.com/ute-9919-parallax-aurora-glory|Access UTE-9919-Parallax-Aurora Glory]]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab PTE: Potential Threat Entity]]\nPotential Threat Entities are paranormal entities who are not yet considered Threats, but have a high likelihood of becoming Threats.\n\n**International Files:**\n\n[[[http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/pte-1422-bosch-lengle|Access PTE-1422-Bosch-L'Engle]]]\n[[[http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/edp-1504-bibelot-burnoutenfant-ebbinghaus |Access PTE-1504-Bibelot-Burnoutenfant-Ebbinghaus]]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/deucalion|Access PTE-2000-Joyride-Moro-Velveteen]]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab LTE: Liquidated Threat Entity]]\nThreat Entities that have been confirmed destroyed.

God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers?

A Type-2 psychic broadcast unit capable of 200 kilorhines of output. \n\nArtifact was programmed to trigger once every ten to thirty days, upon detection of a minimum required number of persons within its broadcast range. Artifact would then assume direct psychic control of all individuals within broadcast range, designating certain individuals as \"actors\" and others as \"audience.\" \"Actors\" would then proceed to perform one of the plays of William Shakespeare, chosen at random, for the edification of the \"audience.\"\n\nAt the conclusion of the performance, Artifact would emit a high energy psychic burst that would erase the memories of the past performance from all subjects.

Operative âââââ has been suspended for a period of no less than three (3) months pending review.\n\n__**Appendix 4**__: Identity Redaction\n\n//In order to protect the identity of the agent involved in these incidents, agent's name has been removed from this version of the Threat Entity casefile.//\n\n//- SN/ec, Records Department//\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access LTE-4201-Velveteen\" hide=\"Hide LTE-4201-Velveteen\"]]\n__**Threat ID**__: LTE-4201-Velveteen \"Ghost Ships\"\n\n__**Authorized Response Level**__: N/A (Confirmed Destroyed, File Archived)\n\n__**Description**__: Two fishing trawlers, each 39 meters in length, designated Component Alpha and Component Bravo. Component Alpha was distinguishable from Component Bravo due to extensive hull damage caused by impact with iceberg. Entities were animate and apparently sapient and displayed companionate behavior towards one another.\n\n__**Liquidation**__: Due to increasing Second Mission Concerns due to increasing reports of \"Ghost Ships\" by local sailors, LTE-4201 Velveteen was approved for liquidation by the Council of 108 on â/â/ââ. Strike Team \"Ocean Thunder\" was tasked to eliminate the target. Strike Team perished after successful liquidation of Component Alpha, when Component Bravo collided with their vessel at hypersonic velocities, resulting in the loss of all hands. Component Bravo subsequently self-terminated.\n\nAll members of Strike Team \"Ocean Thunder\" were subsequently awarded the Aegis of Humanity (post-mortem).\n\n__**Appendix 1**__: Memorial Message, issued on â/â/ââ.\n\n> FOR IMMEDIATE DISTRIBUTION TO ALL GLOBAL OCCULT COALITION MEMBER ORGANIZATIONS\n> \n> GOC High Command has just learned that Strike Team \"Ocean Thunder,\" based out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska, was lost with no survivors this day, after an encounter with a dangerous Threat Entity. Strike Team \"Ocean Thunder\" was carrying out the liquidation of a major Second Mission Threat, and had destroyed one of the two Threat Entities, when the second collided with their vessel at high speed. Despite a heroic rescue attempt by Assessment Team \"Spinnaker,\" all members of Strike Team \"Ocean Thunder\" had perished by the time they were plucked from the sea.\n> \n> Our hearts go out to the friends and families of the dead.
