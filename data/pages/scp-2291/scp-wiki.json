As direct physical contact with SCP-2291 is prohibited, only D-Class personnel are authorized to move the item. Research involving SCP-2291 is prohibited without the express permission of Dr. Mbeke or Site-19’s senior administrative staff.  Individuals that touch SCP-2291 directly are to be designated SCP-2291-A, administered a Class B amnestic, and placed into confinement for 3 months or until cleared by a supermajority of Site-19's psychiatric panel. Individuals that still show symptoms after this period are to be terminated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2291 is a corrugated cardboard box with a edge length of 15cm. The word “FUN” is printed in large, black capital letters on each side. There are no gaps or joints on SCP-2291's surface, suggesting that it was formed whole rather than being folded from a flat sheet. D-Class personnel report a rattling noise issuing from SCP-2291 when moved, suggesting that it contains one or more smaller objects. All attempts to access SCP-2291's interior via destructive means have failed, as have imaging studies intended to probe the interior. Level-3 personnel and above may request Test Logs 2291 -1 though -4 for more details.\n\nSCP-2291 was recovered from the offices of █████████ Corporate Solutions in ███████, Ohio. Foundation assets were alerted after the entire staff of █████████ Corporate Solutions was reported missing within a period of 2 days. Mobile Task Force Rho-9 (\"The Dundies\") was assigned to investigate, and recovered SCP-2291 along with 18 instances of SCP-2291-A, identified as the former employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions. These individuals were found at their workstations, suffering from sleep deprivation and mild dehydration. \n\nDirect physical contact with SCP-2291 is to be considered a Delta-class cognitohazard. Those who do so are to be designated SCP-2291-A and experience the following symptoms:\n\n* All communication by SCP-2291-A instances is altered. SCP-2291-A instances involuntarily replace some adjectives, especially those involving emotion, with the word “fun”. \n* SCP-2291-A instances smile constantly, even while sleeping.\n* SCP-2291 significantly alters how SCP-2291-A instances express and experience emotion. Immediately after initial exposure, subjects report increased feelings of happiness and significantly reduced resistance to authority. As the time of exposure to SCP-2291 increases, however, symptoms change; subjects repeatedly exposed to SCP-2291 for a period greater than 2 weeks become reliant on SCP-2291's effects to experience pleasure. When isolated from SCP-2291, these subjects temporarily lose their ability to normally process endorphins. In addition to a suppressed ability to experience pleasure, these individuals experience symptoms analogous to extreme doses of Naloxone in opiate abusers; restlessness, sweating, and headache are common.\n\nWhen isolated from SCP-2291, SCP-2291-A instances typically recover within 3 months. Recovery is negatively correlated with exposure time; the less time a subject spends near SCP-2291, the greater their chance of recovery.\n\n**Interview Log 2291-17-3:** The first 18 known SCP-2291-A subjects were the employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions, all of whom were detained during the recovery of SCP-2291. The following interview has been deemed notable due to its content.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 2291-17-3\" hide=\"- Interview Log 2291-17-3\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-2291-17\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Evans\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-2291-17 was interviewed 2 weeks after containment. SCP-2291-17, formerly known as Ahmed █████, was an accountant at █████████ Corporate Solutions. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Evans:** Hello, Mr. █████. I'd like ask you a few questions about SCP-2291.\n> \n> **SCP-2291-17:** What?\n> \n> **Evans:** The object in this picture.\n> \n> //Evans hands SCP-2291-17 a photo of SCP-2291//\n> \n> **SCP-2291-17:** That? ████████[[footnote]]No employees with the name of ████████ were detained during the recovery of SCP-2291, nor did any recovered SCP-2291-A instances claim to work in the █████████ Corporate Solutions Human Resources department.[[/footnote]] brought that in during our holiday party a month ago. Everyone had been kinda fun after the layoffs last quarter, and she said it was a gift to cheer us all up.\n> \n> **Evans:** Who is ████████? \n> \n> **SCP-2291-17:** She's the head of HR. No one really knew her well, she was just... fun, you know? Her whole department just weirded all of us out.\n> \n> **Evans:** How have you been feeling since ████████ brought in SCP-2291?\n> \n> **SCP-2291-17:** My face has been feeling kinda fun lately. Other than that, I just can't stop working. I used to want to go home and see my family, but fun box made me realize something important. I love my job. My job is my life. Why would I go home when I feel so empty there? My job is fun.\n> \n> //SCP-2291-17 is silent for 12 seconds//\n> \n> **SCP-2291-17:** Can I borrow your pen?\n>  \n> **Evans:** No.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-2291-17 ceased exhibiting anomalous traits 28 days after the interview. He was administered a Class-B amnestic and released, and his SCP designation was removed.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Interview Log D-14783-7:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log D-14783-7\" hide=\"- Interview Log D-14783-7\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** D-14783\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mbeke\n> \n> **Foreword:** D-14683, a former paralegal, was chosen for testing with SCP-2291. To test the long-term effects of SCP-2291 on subjects similar to the employees of  █████████ Corporate Solutions. D-14683 was asked to complete a small amount of legal paperwork after each hour of exposure. The following interview was performed 3 months into SCP-2291 exposure.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Mbeke:** Hello, D-14783. How are you today?\n> \n> //D-14783's tone suggests unhappiness. He remains smiling.//\n> \n> **D-14783:** Fun.\n> \n> **Dr. Mbeke:** What do you mean by that? You sound sad.\n> \n> **D-14783:** I don't have enough to do. I have to keep working. Can you guys give me more to do?\n> \n> **Dr. Mbeke:** I'll see what we can find for you. Tell me, why do you feel like you need to work so much? \n> \n> **D-14783:** I have to be fun. When I'm not writing, when I'm not getting things done, I just get this sense of emptiness. Don't get me wrong, whenever I'm near that little box thing, I feel great. But even then, I feel almost guilty about not working. When I'm not around it, the feeling just gets worse. The only way I can feel like myself is to work.\n> \n>**Dr. Mbeke:** Thank you, D-14783. That will be all.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** D-14783 did not show any progress in recovering from the effects of SCP-2291. He reported consistent worsening of psychological symptoms as time of exposure increased. He was found dead in his cell 4 months and 12 days after the above interview. Cause of death was ruled to be blood loss resulting from suicide, as D-14783 had repeatedly carved the word \"fun\" into his chest and left forearm with a screw taken from his cot. Due to this incident, further long-term studies with SCP-2291 are prohibited.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Document 2291-A:** The following is a transcript of Video 2291-A, recovered from a camcorder found in the offices of █████████ Corporate Solutions.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Document 2291-A\" hide=\"- Document 2291-A\"]]\n> **00:00:00** - Video begins. Appears to document an office holiday party; employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions are gathered in a conference room eating cake.\n> \n> **00:03:54** - Ahmed █████, in conversation with another employee near the camera, is noted to say \"Screw this job, I'm out. I'm putting in my two weeks tomorrow.\"\n> \n> **00:07:31** - An unknown female wearing a suit, designated SCP-2291-B, enters the frame. SCP-2291-B's face is obscured by electronic distortion. She is holding SCP-2291.\n> \n> **00:07:34** - SCP-2291-B places SCP-2291 in the center of the conference table and takes a seat facing the camera. All employees in the room cease talking and stare at SCP-2291.\n> \n> **00:09:39** - After remaining silent and motionless for 2 minutes, 2 seconds, all █████████ Corporate Solutions employees excluding SCP-2291-B lay a finger on SCP-2291.\n> \n> **00:13:04** - All subjects excluding SCP-2291-B silently leave the conference room and return to their desks. SCP-2291-B remains seated in front of the camera.\n> \n> **01:35:00** - Video ends. No conversation is heard from the employees of █████████ Corporate Solutions, nor does SCP-2291-B move after 00:07:34.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2290]]] | SCP-2291 | [[[SCP-2292]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
