More like pins being pulled out, a hellish kind of acupuncture. And there was really only about fifteen. \n\nAt the time, of course, that was the last thing on my mind. I didn’t know what was happening. Everything around me was dark. I tried to scream, but coughed a tube out of my throat. I jerked upright and cracked my head on a smooth slab of glass. Curved walls pressed in on me from all sides. Muffled sounds leaked in from somewhere far away, but I couldn't comprehend them. I was trapped. Entombed in cold steel.\n\nThen the glass slid aside, and the harsh white light poured in.\n\n\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n||**Medical Bay 01 - Camera Feed**||\n[[/=]]\n\n//The medical bay is a sterile room. Its walls and floor are gleaming metal, lit by ceiling-mounted lamps. There is little medical equipment to be seen save for a series of lozenge-shaped pods placed along the far wall - ten in total. They are stasis capsules, designed to protect their occupants in suspended animation for as long as necessary.//\n\n//Capsule 07 has opened.//\n\n//An assortment of robotic manipulator arms — descending from a rolling gantry affixed to the ceiling — are operating controls on the side of the capsule.

Its owner uses the leverage to pull herself into a sitting position: she is a thin woman with brown skin, clad in a hospital gown. Her featureless white garment is marred by slowly spreading stains of blood from approximately twenty small puncture wounds. She clutches the edges of the capsule, inhaling and exhaling.//\n\n//A mechanically modulated voice speaks.//\n\n**Voice:** {{Subject recovered from stasis more quickly than expected.

Now that I was coming down off the adrenaline high, I could feel it: all my muscles were aching in unison. It was like I’d run a marathon and the soreness had only just caught up to me. I wasn’t even sure my legs could hold me up if I climbed out of the capsule. \n\nUnwillingly, I stared at the gantry — with no idea where else to make eye contact — and listened.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n\n**Voice:** {{The date is 25 July, 2092.

There is nothing to illuminate their interior spaces, and as such, the woman cannot immediately discern their contents.

Instead, I sat cross-legged and stared down at the cold chrome floor, thinking. \n\nThat little tidbit about the black hole should've galvanized me into action, but I still wasn't sure I trusted the robot. And even though I didn't know my own name, something told me sympathy wasn't my strong suit. A sob story about incompetence didn't have much chance of swaying me. I should have bided my time until I got my strength back, then made a run for it.\n\nSo I'm not sure what drove me to keep talking.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n\n**Woman:** Look, metal man.

Luckily, the medbays had plenty of bandages and disinfectant. Once I'd stopped bleeding all over myself, we got to making preparations for the journey ahead. \n\nStep one: learning the layout of the ship that, with any luck, wouldn't end up being my tomb.\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7020/dur2.png]]\n\nFor some reason, the design provoked a strange twinge of familiarity in the back of my head. At the time I didn't think much of it; I was apparently a member of the ship's crew, after all, and there were more important things to worry about. \n\nThe green section in the center was the ship's bridge and the only one open to Ash. It contained four medbay compartments -- only one of which I'd seen, of course -- and a server room that had survived mostly intact. Exits along the outer walls should have led to the ship's three wings, marked in red, yellow and blue. But therein was the problem: Ash, in its damaged state, couldn't arrange anything to open the doors itself. It couldn't even see past them. It was trapped, like a bird in a cage.\n\nAnd that was where I came in. I'd make all the dangerous trips while Ash literally rode on my shoulders the whole way; it whipped up some kind of backpack full of transmitters, batteries and electrical doodads, which it claimed would host its mind in portable form, letting it bypass the fact that it was locked out of the system. \n\nI wasn't an engineer, so I didn't pretend to understand the details. All I knew was our goal: if I could reconnect Ash to all three of its memory cores, one in each wing, it would be able to repair the //Durandal// before it completely broke down and killed us both. Not just that, it would know exactly where we were going and why. And it would be able to get into that room marked in purple -- the pilot's cabin. Deep inside, I even harbored a silent hope that it'd be able to turn the ship around and cross those 62 light years back to home.\n\nAt my insistence, Ash also showed me where I could find some spare clothes in one of the other medbays: a tank top, shorts and an orange jumpsuit. I was beyond glad to get rid of that flimsy hospital gown -- though of course, being a robot, Ash didn't really understand why.\n\nAs per our agreement, Ash had one other detail to share with me, one that seemed comparatively minor. The ship's destination was still a mystery, but some parts of the database referenced it indirectly with a classification number: 'SCP-7020’.\n\nI didn't know what it meant, and I didn't think it was important. I was wrong. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"quote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n||**Medical Bay 03 - Camera Feed**||\n[[/=]]\n\n//Dee stands in front of a mirror, appraising herself.

Ash had made me pack some tools -- screwdrivers, pliers and wrenches -- and at its guidance, I used them to pry a certain bolted panel off the wall. Inside was the memory core, a boxy device like a transformer nestled in a tangle of wires.

In order to traverse the area safely, I'd need my own source of air.\n\nAsh was still locked out of the other two wings, but with its increased capabilities, we didn't need to rely on that clunky backpack anymore.

WELCOME, OVERSEER.**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Item №:** SCP-7020 (L-5 Clearance Version)\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Containment of SCP-7020 is irrelevant. \n\nIf necessary, a false description of SCP-7020’s properties is to be disseminated to Level 4 personnel and below. This description is to indicate that SCP-7020 possesses an unspecified anomaly posing extreme danger to human explorers, infohazardous in nature.\n\nIn order to limit the risk of data leakage, SCP-7020 should not be visited in person under any circumstances. Exploration is to be conducted only via Mk. VII unmanned probes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7020 is a habitable exoplanet in the 51 Eridani star system, representing an extreme statistical improbability with regard to the rarity of life in our universe.\n\nTo elaborate: numerous initiatives have been undertaken by the Overseer Council to survey nearby star systems for habitable planets, and later to perform wider sweeps of the Local Interstellar Cloud, Orion Arm and extragalactic space. These measures did not discover any instances of planets which harbored life, had done so in the past or could potentially do so in the future, save for SCP-7020. \n\nAll evidence presently suggests that habitable conditions are exceedingly uncommon throughout the universe and that Earth and SCP-7020 are the sole exceptions to this. As it is highly unlikely that SCP-7020 would form by chance, it can only be explained as an anomaly.\n\n**Addendum 7020-01 - Risk Assessment** \n\nThe primary threat posed by SCP-7020 is internal loss of morale. SCP-7020 exists as irrefutable proof that the universe is largely barren; furthermore, it may prompt incorrect assumptions that humanity's existence is itself perpetuated by an anomalous phenomenon, or that Earth is an anomaly rather than SCP-7020. Such conclusions would likely cause widespread ennui and loss of confidence in the Foundation mission.\n\nDuring initial containment of SCP-7020 in 1997, this was not taken into consideration. A manned mission to SCP-7020 was planned under the codename of Project Voyager as part of a series of K-Class contingency measures; however, logistic and engineering issues slowed progress on the mission considerably. In the meantime, the anomaly was reevaluated by the O5 Council. Its current description and containment procedures were decided by a near-unanimous vote, O5-7 dissenting.\n\nAlthough the engineering issues had been resolved, Project Voyager was canceled and all participating personnel dismissed. The majority complied, but Head Engineer ███████ ████ vocally protested the decision, citing SCP-7020’s potential use as a secondary cradle for humanity in spite of the risks inherent. She refused to abandon the Project Voyager facility, necessitating her demotion to Clearance Level 1. \n\nAs ███████ ████ possessed [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/where-have-you-been-all-my-life a natural resistance to memory alteration], a long-term course of deep amnestics was also required.
