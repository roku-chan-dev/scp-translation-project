A debt from a friend, one that could withstand a sum of aetheric strain.\n\nA silken coat, darkened with coal dust and soot. The length was long enough to trip her, a design oversight that was gracefully subverted with a bold pleasure for levitation.\n\nA conical hat, hand sewn over the course of thirty minutes. It was nothing special. Of course, it was always the little things that meant the world to everyone else. Indicative of evil rituals, of sinful bribery, sexual deviancy and satanism. \n\nThe triad of a name she kept, in safe harbor, [[span style=\"font-family:cinzel decorative;\"]]WITcH.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family:cinzel decorative;font-size:200%;color:red;\"]]A CYcLe aGO[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\nA hope that remains yet unanswered. \n\nShe sighs by candlelight, and dispels its flame. The thick curtain of darkness recedes and her eyes flex catlike, she can begin picking apart the outlines of her fellow sisters, a sisterhood forged in orphanage, and then sent off to a nunnery. Gentle snoring reminds her of the pious, respectful faithful, all of them strangers in her holism. \n\n= //##5ce600|I need sleep.##//\n\n= //##a44cd3|Yes, God demands it.##//\n\n= //##5ce600|So why can't I sleep?##//\n\nShe wraps her blanket tighter around herself, curling up in the light of the moon. It is but a pitiful comfort, irritating against her bare, pale skin. Still, she pulls in tighter, hoping the texture could put the mind off such inconsequential matters. She is a child of God. No less. No more.\n\nShe worms her way deeper into the cloth, deeper into the bed. She mumbles a lullaby, most of the words empty, mimicking distant, foreign tones. She forces a recollection, a choral ether of the bosom of a never-was mother, comforting a wailing babe mid-service.

Hand still in hand, a support for her to step off, first on stray bricks, and stopping. \n\nShe stares at the drop, and then back up at the witch, who nods at her.\n\nAnd like a waltz, the witch gently offers her other hand, taking whimsical, levity steps. One arm held above her head, the other suspended by her side, step, step, step, to the tune of an orchestral pneuma. She watches her nightdress masquerade as a cloud, lithely swaying as the witch guides her forward.\n\nStep, step, step.\n\nShe holds her breath, gasping on occasion, a stray giggle escaping her personage. The exhilaration of defiance and success, so above that she can spot the gatherings of crows and ravens, watching from below, idle, hidden from the dimmed lamplights, an entire world unbeknownst to her.\n\nThe dance escorts the two over the bakery, the inn, the town hall. An arc tracing the courtyard, in full view of everything the tiny town had to offer. The many crooked alleyways, the canals and bridges, all the forgotten wells and walls.
