Before joining the Foundation, Researcher Crane had a job as a Computer & Information Research Scientist. He excelled at the job, knowing far more about coding and software engineering then required. Researcher Crane developed his own touch to hear technology in the form of a glove and Bluetooth earpiece to aid him around daily life.\n\nResearcher Crane grew up in Airdrie, Scotland. He lacked an ideal upbringing, undergoing severe emotional and physical abuse by his father daily. The trauma of his past affects him to this day, as he developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and Dissociative Identity Disorder.. Researcher Crane has biweekly therapy sessions with Dr. Johnson.\n\nResearcher Crane is often accompanied by Dr. Stanley Diamond when off-site, due to the two’s friendship.\n\n> **Author Notes:**\n> \n> There are a multitude of phrases, items, and a few places which are triggering to him. Most cause from minor anxiety to panic attacks and occasionally flashbacks upon mention or contact, although a few items such as ropes, belts, and metal forks and knives, and insults about his blindness almost always send him into flashbacks, as those things were all very prominent in his childhood trauma.\n> \n> Dislikes when people look at his blindness as a disability\n> \n> Seen as \"the nice one\" by many, but typically only keeps to himself to avoid argument. Will stand up for himself if he feels he’s being disrespected.\n> \n> Crane often dissociates, which is the reason some of his spoken dialogue often has “stutters” in it. He’s pretty much dissociating at least 35-45% of a day, but is so used to it, he powers through.\n> \n> Crane has very bad trust issues, as he was abused by his father, and his mother didn’t care, even lying for him if suspicions were raised.\n> \n> Crane and Diamond are dating\n> \n> You can find him in:\n> \n> * [[[SCP-4208 | SCP-4208]]]\n> * [[[SCP-5090 | SCP-5090]]]\n> * [[[SCP-5554 | SCP-5554]]]\n> * [[[SCP-5551 | SCP-5551]]]\n> * [[[SCP-4688 | SCP-4688]]] (mentioned)\n> * [[[SCP-5567 | SCP-5567]]] (mentioned)\n> * [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/messaging-crustaceans | Messaging Crustaceans]]]\n\n@@ @@\n++ __**Dr. Stanley Diamond**__\n\n**Name:** Dr. Stanley Diamond\n\n**Clearance Level:** Level 3\n\n**Occupation:** Geologist\n\n**Specialties:** Archeological anomalies, geological anomalies\n\n**Location:** Site 288, Site 23, wherever needed\n\n**History:** Dr. Diamond was the head researcher of SCP-████, and involved in Incident SCP-████. In result of the incident, Dr. Diamond received a facial wound.\n\nDr. Diamond’s mother was murdered by his uncle when he was five years old. Although he dislikes the details, the exact situation was traumatic, ever changing how he viewed the world, and the people in it.\n\n**Profile:** Dr. Diamond has been described by others as “a selfish asshole” around anyone who is not Researcher Oliver Crane.

He believes these diagnoses make him weak, but doesn’t think Crane’s CPTSD diagnosis makes him weak, revealing a double standard he’s sort of been raised to have.\n> \n> After his mother was murdered, his father completely ignored her, and would get upset at Diamond for crying and mourning his mother’s death.
