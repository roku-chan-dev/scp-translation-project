Disinformation campaigns are to be spearheaded to label SCP-5923-A as a UNESCO World Friendship and Peace Village to attract tourism.  Advertisement campaigns encouraging tourism in the area are to be disseminated throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nGuided tours and vendors will be contracted to organize tourist activities and several dwellings are to be restored.  At least two \"maintenance\" Foundation agents are to reside in the restored dwellings at any given time.\n\n\n-----\n++++ **Description**: \n\nSCP-5923 is a series of anomalous dreams that can occur in a certain segment of the population of Europe and Asia: most often creatives and individuals who attest to feeling at odds with society. A common psychological feature in subjects is the belief that they do not belong to their time or given community. \n\nThe dreams that make up SCP-5923 occur once per lunar cycle, at minimum, but can be as often as ten times in the same period.  During an SCP-5923 event, despite some small variations, individuals will consistently experience the following sequence of events:\n* At the outset of an SCP-5923 event, subject will approach a small river shrouded in mist and be ferried across by a man in early 20^^th^^ century clothes. No discerning features of the individual can be remembered by the subject.\n* After the river crossing, the subject will come upon a large town constructed of stone, also shrouded in mist.\n* Figures move along the streets of this town but appear unaware of the subject. These figures, designated SCP-5923-1, lack identifying features and seem to be animate shadows. \n* The subject will walk through the town’s streets, eventually reaching the central town square which is dominated by an old Greek Orthodox Church.\n* On the steps of the church is a genderless individual, dressed in white, hooded robes that shine brightly. The figure will stand up at subject’s approach and take their hand, guiding them into the church.\n* The shining figure speaks with subject, but the only consistent feature of their words from subject to subject is the phrase: “Come to me and belong.”  At this point, the subject awakens.\n\nApproximately 26% of those who experience an SCP-5923 event report a persistent longing during the period of time these events occur.[[footnote]]Despite this, there is no compulsion effect or cognitohazardous aspect to an SCP-5923 event.  Subjects who complain of this longing compare it to an ordinary dream where one meets their one true love or other meaningful life event.  In most cases, the longing dissipates over time.[[/footnote]]  SCP-5923 events have been found to vary in their length; some subjects who experience an event only do so for short periods of time, while others experience the event for months or years on a consistent basis.  \n\nOne pattern identified is that SCP-5923 events have never been recorded to occur with individuals with criminal records or those who are socially ostracized from the community. Subjects experiencing SCP-5923 events are usually well-respected in their community or their given trade. \n\n@@ @@\n-----\n**Discovery**: SCP-5923 was first recorded in the 1931 unpublished poem “//My Home//” by famed Turkish 20^^th^^ century poet Neyzen Tevfik.  The following is an excerpt, translated from Turkish.\n[[=]]\n> Mist enshrouds my heart\n> cobblestones calling to me\n> hark, shining guardian\n> where are your halls \n> blessed be the stones of your dreaming streets[[footnote]]In journals from this period, Tevfik describes a recurring dream that is undoubtedly an SCP-5923 event.  In the following years, Tevfik would often write of a desire to find the village in his dreams so that he could “//finally go home//,” despite the fact he was born in the port city of Bodrum.[[/footnote]]\n[[/=]]\n\nCross-references of numerous personal journals, therapy records, and public statements by creatives throughout the 20th century revealed that several thousand individuals have experienced SCP-5923 events.\n\nIn 1999, Dr. Jocasta Rossi reported a recurring dream to her security-cleared therapist.  On the advice of the therapist, and given the frequency of the dreams, Dr. Rossi began researching the phenomenon and confirmed that she was experiencing an SCP-5923 event.  Upon receipt of her report, O5 Command authorized the usage of a prototypical oneirosensory visualization recording device.[[footnote]]Records digital rendering of subject’s dreams.[[/footnote]]  The following is transcript of the recorded SCP-5923 event.\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"► Addendum 5923-1◄\" hide=\"▼ Close File ▼\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Recording obtained by use of prototypical oneirosensory visualization device**\n[[/=]]\n**Date of recording:** 21/11/1999[[footnote]]This was the third attempt at recording due to a combination of technical failures and unsatisfactory sleep quality failing to fully submerge the doctor into REM sleep.[[/footnote]]\n**Participant**: Jocasta Rossi, Head Thaumaturgical Researcher, Site-91\n**Operational Directive:** General information gathering concerning SCP-5923\n@@ @@\n**Foreward**: //Dr. Rossi has confirmed that she has been periodically experiencing SCP-5923 events for the previous three weeks.

The village was predominantly populated with ethnically Greek families who were forced to relocate to Greece.  The village is in significant disrepair; over five hundred structures are still standing, albeit without surviving roofs.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/kayakoy style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nAbandoned village of Kayaköy, Turkey.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nOn 22/12/1999, MTF-Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”)  were mobilized to explore and gather information concerning SCP-5923-A. Additionally, several psionics[[footnote]]Individuals with psychic abilities, on loan from MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”).[[/footnote]] were also mobilized to aid in the reconnaissance.  Captain Maria Waltham was in command of the mission.  Embedded agents within the Turkish Security Agency made falsified reports concerning tectonic activity within the area, and the MTF was inserted under the guise of a damage assessment on the ruins.\n\nSCP-5923-A was confirmed to be abandoned, with no living entities residing within.  Akiva readings were normal and there was no evidence of anomalous energies within the ruins. The only structure that resonated with the psionics was the debilitated church ruins in the town center. Both the church and the square registered significant residue of emotional trauma, most easily relatable to feelings of deep loneliness and being lost.\n\nAfter four hours, Command called a halt to the exploration as the MTF captain had separated from the team and could not be located.  An extensive search of the ruins did not reveal her location and no signal from her transponder was received.\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Addendum 5923-2 ◄\" hide=\"▼ Security Verified ▼\"]]\n\n__**Received Audio-visual Transmissions**__:\n//Following Captain Waltham’s disappearance on 22/12/1999, several transmissions were received by embedded agents within the locality.//\n\n__Received on 23/12/1999__, @ 09:00 hours:\n> //[View from Waltham’s body cam shows small winding cobblestone streets and buildings in pristine condition, just like the recording of Dr. Rossi’s experience of an SCP-5923 event.
