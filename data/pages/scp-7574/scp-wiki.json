A large period of mourning and depression due to the suicide of spouse Dr. Katherine Bartleman (2 years ago), the disappearance of close friend Anton Radu (3 years ago), and the death of father Marcus Bartleman (4 years ago).\n\n**SUMMARY:** Richard Bartleman has, throughout his 32-year career working for the Foundation, consistently shown to be adaptable, efficient, and highly capable in the assignments he is given. This performance was, in the past few years, hindered by a series of losses which then impacted his personality and mood severely. These effects were especially clear after the suicide of his wife of 20 years, Katherine Bartleman, the cause of which is unknown but presumed to be of non-anomalous reasons.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=F-35_Pilot_Art_Tomassetti_in_2002_(cropped).jpg|caption=Richard Bartleman, Age 53.]]\n\nHowever, the last 6 months have shown Richard being able to return to his work and continue to be an invaluable asset to the Foundation. The Site-18 Therapy Division reports that their sessions with Richard ceased as of 7 months ago, by the agent's own decision, indicating a return of mental well-being for Richard. Given the extenuated timeframe since the death of his spouse, the Site-18 Human Resources Department is of the belief that Richard Bartleman has, in simplified terms, been able to \"move on\".\n\nCurrently, there are no reasons going against Richard's involvement in PROJECT STARLAUNCH both mentally or, more importantly, physically.
