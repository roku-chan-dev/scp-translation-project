Or where you are.\n\nIt looks familiar, like you've seen this place before but never stepped inside. You never thought you would enter this place. Foolish. The building is dark and warm, the hot air beating down on you. Except it's not just you anymore. As your eyes start to adjust to the darkness, you see others, just like you. Lined one after another, separated only by a tiny cage. People like you, waiting for their fate. The factory does not discriminate, it accepts everyone. Whether they like it or not.\n\nHow did this happen? You think to yourself. What is this twisted place?\n\nThere are shrieks, screams of pain all competing for attention but none win out. Instead the grinding noise of machines dominates everything, a constant reminder for everyone.\n\nRight next to you there is a saw. Someone jumps in. Bits of their carcass lands on you through the cage, sticking to your body. It is cold and greasy. You try brush it off, but are unable to, with your disfigured body, bones sticking out in the wrong positions. So instead it stays, as a reminder.\n\nThe cage is small, you barely fit in there. One of many cages, all located around the factory. Filled with animals desperately trying to escape. You know they will not make it, as will you. There is no escape.\n\n----\n\nSuddenly, the cages start to move. One after another, each being dragged into their own personal hellhole. Until it is your turn...\n\nThis room is smaller and quieter. The screams have faded into oblivion now, only the grinding of machines remain. It is grey and dusty. The smell of raw meat covers the room, almost choking you alive. It is beautiful.\n\nAnd that's when you realise.\n\nAll of this, the slaughtering of everyone here is important. You see people collecting the meat of your fellow animals, packaging it and selling it to the masses.\n\nAncient humans ate it to survive when nothing else was there. Meat helped cities to grow, helped life to prosper. It was vital. All these thousands of years later, it still is. Helping society to prosper. Without this, the world would not exist how it currently is. It is perfect.\n\nYou are part of this eternal cycle now, and it is good. Even though you will die, it is necessary.\n\nAs the conveyor belt drives you to your final destination, you look up. There is not a human there but a pig standing there. Not a pig like you, but a more natural form of pig, with its pinkish colour and mud covered hooves.\n\nThe cycle will continue, only this time with a new ringleader. After all... you are a pig.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=spacestealth]]\n=====\n> **Name:** Lisobuda Processing Plant\n> **Filename:**\n> **Authors:** [[[https://web.archive.org/web/20161028170005/http://www.panoramio.com:80/user/4593038|Serlim]]]\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=14186278|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
