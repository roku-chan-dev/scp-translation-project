If you are reading this, it means you’ve been selected for a tour aboard SCP-6013 to participate in the Rosetta Protocol. Your skills, hard work and natural resistance to disease will make you an invaluable asset to our team. To get you started in the next stage of your Foundation career, my colleagues and I have created a primer for the work ahead.\n\n**I strongly encourage you to read through this document in full** if this is your first time working with a sentient, Sarkic or intelligent anomaly. It will provide you with an introduction to SCP-6013's communication methods and give you an opportunity to practice interpreting its language in a safe, above-water environment.\n\nBy complying with this conscription, you have waived your privileges to participate in any other onsite study of Sarkic anomalies. You also acknowledge that any psychometrics gathered during the course of your time at Site-82 are the property of the Foundation, as per the authority of Site Director Isaiah Kamski and the Greater Scandinavian Site Advisory Board. If you would like to read a full list of the privileges you have rescinded by joining the Rosetta Protocol, you may refer to pages 10 through 28 of this document.\n\nThe tone of my writing might strike you as unusual, but the truth is that I've never been one for formalities. I find it's best to keep things personable, especially for something as dry as linguistics. Ms. Greer is a sharp one, yes, but she's wound far too tight for my liking. Luckily for you I don't come apart as easily as she does.\n\nWith that in mind, let's begin, shall we?\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Soonsaran Vocabulary, Updated as of Rosetta Protocol Cycle 7-07]]\nSoonsaran is comprised primarily of verbs, nouns and adjectives.\n\n* **Verbs** in Soonsaran behave very predictably. If a Soonsaran word ends with an \"a,\" it is a verb. The noun form of the word \"Nälkä\" is the only exception to this rule.\n* **Nouns** have the greatest variation. They may end in many different letters and vary widely in length and pronunciation. We believe that nouns constitute most of Soonsaran's \"adapted\" vocabulary.\n* **Adjectives** have more variability than verbs but not as much as nouns. Soonsaran adjectives tend to be shorter than the words they describe and usually end in a consonant, especially \"k,\" \"r\" or \"t.\"\n* Though some words may be \"conjugated\" between different forms, as is the case with \"wark,\" \"warat\" and \"warra\" (//adj//. \"sculpted/engineered,\" //n//. \"sculptor/engineer,\" //v//. \"to sculpt/engineer\"), this is not usually the case. Most Soonsaran words have only a slight connection to other words of a different type, even if their meanings are similar.\n* **Prepositions** in Soonsaran are written using the number 7, which is used in other languages to denote a glottal stop. Prepositions in Soonsaran are placed at the end of the phrases in which they appear; for example, appending the preposition \"below\" to the word \"ocean\" (//batrav//) would be written as \"ocean below\" (//batrav7//).\n* **Conjunctions** in Soonsaran are written using hyphens (-) to conjoin the affected words. A phrase like \"blood and thunder\" (//eshal// and //rortir//, respectively) would be written as //eshal-rortir//.\n* **Complex words and phrases** are written by joining the component words together with apostrophes ('). Unlike most words in Soonsaran, their meanings are fixed and do not vary between uses.\n * Complex phrases are treated as single words grammatically. To illustrate, we'll use the compound phrase \"thought flow\" (//rotir'tsatsa//), the Soonsaran word for brain activity. Writing a glottal stop for a phrase like \"with thoughts flow\" (//rotrir'tsatsa7//) would modify the whole phrase (//rortir'tsatsa//), not just the last word of the compound (//tsatsa//).\n* Certain words in Soonsaran behave **modally**; that is, they may mean more than one thing at once, or one thing at one time and one thing at another time:\n * The word \"**ith**\" simultaneously describes SCP-6013 and every living thing that it considers connected to itself. A close approximation would be \"I and we,\" \"us,\" or possibly a \"royal We.\"\n * Conversely, the word \"**heta**\" describes everything that is //not// SCP-6013, regardless of number, distance, size or any other determining factors. Imagine it like \"all of you\" or \"everyone else.\"\n * Finally, the word \"**ia**\" means either \"yes\" or \"no\" at any given time, but never both.\n\nYou may reference the tables below at any time to check the meanings of particular words while you work (physical copies of this document will have these tables listed under the Appendices, page 126, sub-heading 2A-2C). If you are translating electronically, each word or phrase will have its appropriate meanings assembled for you already.\n\nFor those of you working on paper . . . you have my sympathies.\n----\n= **[[[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6013/offset/3 | A complete table of SCP-6013's vocabulary can be found here. >>]]]**\n----\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Complex Phrases and Grammatical Concepts]]\nReference material for Soonsaran's more complex linguistic components has been appended below.

What do you do?\n\n= **Ith, Gräpaf Trypori7, nälkä nolaa7. Ia, ith ordtiäm-ordtiäm litca’siola.**\n\nSeems intimidating, right? Let’s go through the motions and see for ourselves.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Translating Soonsaran (cont'd.)]]\n\nFirst, we translate the affirmatives/negatives and any identifying words. We also pluralize both appearances of the word “ord” because they have the “all” suffix (//tiäm//). Each word that we change will be __underlined and highlighted in__ ##e38502|__orange.__##\n\n* What is your name, SCP-6013? What do you do?\n\n= **##e38502|__I/we__##, Gräpaf Trypori7, nälkä nolaa7. ##e38502|__Yes/no__##, ##e38502|__I/we__ __all__## ord-##e38502|__all__## ord litca’siola.**\n\nRemember that the pluralizing suffixes (both, some, many, all) will be translated automatically for you.\n----\nThen, using the vocabulary available, we identify the verbs, nouns and adjectives in discrete phrases, which are listed below:\n\n[[html]]\n1. <select>\n<option selected>Gräpaf</option>\n<option>Harmony</option>\n<option>Union</option>\n<option>Group/Collective</option>\n<option>Faith/Congregation</option>\n</select> <select>\n<option selected>Trypori</option>\n<option>Holes/Wounds</option>\n<option>Roots</option>\n<option>Rivers</option>\n<option>Burrows/Tunnels</option>\n</select><br>\n2. <select>\n<option selected>nälkä</option>\n<option>hunger/need</option>\n<option>lust</option>\n<option>power</option>\n<option>life</option>\n</select> <select>\n<option selected>nolaa</option>\n<option>sleep/lie down</option>\n<option>hide</option>\n<option>disappear</option>\n<option>gestate/grow</option>\n</select><br>\n3. all <select>\n<option selected>ord</option>\n<option>skin/flesh</option>\n<option>fur/scales</option>\n<option>fabric/bag</option>\n<option>blanket</option>\n</select> - all <select>\n<option selected>ord</option>\n<option>skin/flesh</option>\n<option>fur/scales</option>\n<option>fabric/bag</option>\n<option>blanket</option>\n</select><br>\n4. <select>\n<option selected>litca</option>\n<option>see</option>\n<option>read</option>\n<option>understand/know</option>\n</select> ' <select>\n<option selected>siola</option>\n<option>penetrate</option>\n<option>dig/pierce</option>\n<option>go through</option>\n</select>\n[[/html]]\n\n* **Gräpaf Trypori:** In this case SCP-6013 is describing itself with a title. This title indicates its state and function: a terraforming organism buried in the ground. Therefore, out of the possible options, “Harmony Burrows” seems plausible. Whether “Burrow” is singular or plural here is a matter of interpretation, but we believe it to be pluralized, so we will pluralize it.\n* **nälkä nolaa:** There are actually several possible translations for this phrase: “hide power,” for instance. We will use “grow life” (or “life grow” in its original grammar) for this example. Remember that the verb goes //after// the subjects and objects of the phrase.\n* **ordtiäm-ordtiäm:** This phrase uses the same word twice, so we can assume that it is meant to be read in two different ways. The only combination we can find meaning in is “skin-flesh,” possibly “skin and flesh” as an analog to the phrase “skin and bone.” Pluralized, we have “all skin-all flesh.”\n* **litca’siola:** Literally “see penetrate.” SCP-6013 is describing the act of seeing through something.\n\nNote that the prepositions and conjunctions are written using the glottal stop (7) and the hyphen (-), respectively. They will remain undecided for now.\n\n* What is your name, SCP-6013? What do you do?\n\n= **I/we, ##e38502|__Harmony Burrows__##7, ##e38502|__life grow__##7. Yes/no, I/we ##e38502|__all skin__##-##e38502|__all flesh__## ##e38502|__see’penetrate__##.**\n----\nIn order to write the sentence in English, we must determine which prepositions and conjunctions are being used. We also decide whether the “Ia” is affirmative or negative (yes or no).\n\n[[html]]\n1. Harmony Burrows <select>\n<option selected>7</option>\n<option>above</option>\n<option>below</option>\n<option>from</option>\n<option>inside</option>\n<option>of</option>\n<option>outside</option>\n<option>until</option>\n<option>with</option>\n<option>without</option>\n</select><br>\n2. Grow life <select>\n<option selected>7</option>\n<option>above</option>\n<option>below</option>\n<option>from</option>\n<option>inside</option>\n<option>of</option>\n<option>outside</option>\n<option>until</option>\n<option>with</option>\n<option>without</option>\n</select><br>\n3. all skin <select>\n<option selected>–</option>\n<option>and</option>\n<option>but</option>\n<option>for</option>\n<option>or</option>\n<option>so</option>\n</select> all flesh\n\n[[/html]]\n\n* **Harmony Burrows7:** “Harmony Burrow” cannot read as a title unless it is being attributed to something. Therefore, the most likely preposition is “of.”\n* **grow life7**: Several prepositions are possible, but the only meaningful ones are \"from,\" “inside” or possibly “with.”\n* **skin-flesh:** The only conjunction that would be meaningful here is “and.”\n\n* What is your name, SCP-6013? What do you do?\n\n= **I/we, Harmony Burrows ##e38502|__(of)__##, life grow ##e38502|__(inside)__##. ##e38502|__Yes__##, I/we all skin ##e38502|__(and)__## all flesh see through.**\n----\nThe last thing to do is swap the subject-object-verb order of Soonsaran for the subject-verb-object order of English. We also move the prepositions to their appropriate places.\n\n* What is your name, SCP-6013? What do you do?\n\n= **I/we, Harmony of Burrows, grow inside life. Yes, I/we see through all skin and all flesh.**\n\nNow, finally, we’ve translated a Soonsaran sentence into English.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Trying Soonsaran for Yourself]]\n\nNow that we've had a proper introduction to Soonsaran, I will provide you with some practice sentences to help you get better acquainted. The \"correct\" translations will be provided below if you are viewing this document electronically.

There is little practical difference between being \"inside ocean\" and \"below ocean,\" for instance, since both are in the ocean. Though //we// may make these distinctions, SCP-6013 does not seem to.\n* SCP-6013 may use a word multiple times in the same sentence, sometimes even in succession. If it does, it is safe to assume that they have distinct meanings from each other. These include individual definitions within one entry, such as \"skin/flesh\" for the word \"ord\" as we saw in our first example. However, also keep in mind that certain words like \"valk\" and phrasal verbs like \"siola\" have particular meanings when attached to other words. Saying \"see through,\" \"go through\" and \"dig through,\" for instance, would all use one meaning for the verb \"siola,\" even if they appear one after the other.\n* Complex phrases (those joined by one or more apostrophes) should be treated as nouns unless every component of the phrase is a verb. For example, \"litca'siola\" (//see through//) is a verb while \"rortir'tsatsa\" (//thought flow//) is not.\n* If you are approved for further direct contact work, you may be enlisted into more advanced tiers of the Rosetta Protocol, such as pictography and pheromone study. If you are interested in such an opportunity, contact the Site-82 Biosemiotics Division upon arrival.\n* SCP-6013 may gesture to you with interior appendages or biolithic constructs during your work. If it does, remove yourself from the situation, assess your suit integrity and contact your supervisor immediately.\n* During initial contact, SCP-6013 may vocalize more enthusiastically and at a greater volume than during other times. Common vocalizations include whistles, clicks, pulse calls, screams and trills. A particularly loud vocalization might sound something like this:\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:audio-player-woed-source\n|unique-name=PeriInternal2\n|audio-file=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-6013-2/Pericardium_Internal.ogg\n|background-color=rgb(252, 252, 252)\n|border-color=rgb(215, 215, 215)\n|border-radius=0.350rem\n|dropshadow-color=rgba(106, 173, 144, 0.15)\n|text-color=rgb(106, 173, 144)\n|icons-color=rgb(48, 71, 60)\n|player-color=rgb(197, 227, 205)\n|progress-color=rgb(106, 173, 144)\n]]\n\n* Despite how it may seem, vocalizations like these are completely normal for SCP-6013. The lights, sounds and other conditions experienced during direct contact can be highly upsetting, however, and it is common to feel a sense of disorientation or unease. You will need to be careful to avoid any moisture, particulate matter or biolith fragments expelled from the walls and ceiling during this process.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab A Final Word]]\nSoonsaran appears intimidating at first. Know that familiarizing yourself with its grammar, cadence and inflections is a matter of practice and patience, and that it's normal to take time adjusting. The language is simple in many ways, but its openness can be deceptive. SCP-6013 is a fickle beast! Exercise discretion with your work, and we will all benefit from your ingenuity.\n\nI look forward to seeing what you discover.\n\n—Doctor Isaiah Kamski, Site Director\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]",
