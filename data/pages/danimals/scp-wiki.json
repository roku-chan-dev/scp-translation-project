Moose visibly did not recoil, in a recoiling sort of way. \"No, you may not feed him peanuts.\"\n\nClef grinned. \"I come bearing news! This is happening everywhere. We've got confirmed reports of spontaneous monkification at 43, 95, 119 and 120, and several suspected cases to boot.\"\n\nMoose raised both eyebrows this time. \"What does a //suspected case// of turning into a monkey look like?\"\n\nClef's grin widened. \"Seven different people have tried to report me so far today, for starters.\"\n\nMoose nodded. \"Should probably stop throwing your poop at the new researchers.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Calvin.\n\n\"I didn't choose the welcome wagon committee, the welcome wagon commitee chose me.\" Clef looked down at Aeslinger. \"I think he's sad because he's so recently monkified, he has no lice in his fur to eat.\"\n\nCalvin gagged, but Moose considered. \"That does make sense,\" she said. \"And it makes sense that you're the one who figured it out.\"\n\n\"Hey,\" said Calvin, mid-gag. \"Hasn't something like this happened before?\"\n[[div]]\nMoose narrowed her eyes.\n\n\"Like fifty fucking times,\" sighed Clef. \"Like every other day.\"\n\nCalvin snapped his fingers. \"Didn't one of the senior staff have this happen to them once?\"\n\n\"No,\" said Clef.\n\n\"No,\" said Moose.\n\n\"I'm almost sure they did, though?\" Calvin moved towards the door. \"We should call them up and see what caused it.

She got that a lot; as the female secretary of Arcadia's chief executive, she was used to condescension from would-be game developers. \"I know he's in,\" the man replied, sounding //precisely// as snotty as he looked. \"I can hear him banging away in there. Maybe I can lighten his mood!\"\n\n\"Oh, he's in a great mood.\" \n\nA primal shriek erupted from behind Dan \"Wolf\" Dunn's closed door, as if in direct response.\n\n\"He's having a very productive day.\"\n\nA very particular sound, which almost could not have been anything but a keyboard being systematically demolished via percussion with an Xbox 360 controller swung like a flail, clattered through the door.\n\n\"He's getting a lot of work done.\"\n\nThe man stared at her. \"He sounds like he's destroying his office.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Yes, well, he's been playing games all afternoon, for research. Normally he's not in the mood, but he really turned the corner today!\"\n\nShe beamed at him.\n\n\"He says he understands the gamers now.\"\n\nThe unmistakeable vocalizations of a Rhesus macaque filled the air for the next two minutes, followed by what //might// have been the word \"Fortnite\" in a high-pitched squeal.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|Site-120:## Silesian Voivodeship, Republic of Poland**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nDr. Jessie Rivera felt a growing sense of unease as she watched the security footage. \"This isn't funny. Right?\"\n\nDr. Magdaleine Cornwell, standing beside her, nodded. \"It's //very// not funny.\"\n\nThe screen was showing a corridor on the Site's lower sublevel, where the technical apparatus was stored. A monkey in a pressed black suit and labcoat, wearing white gloves covered with glowing runes, was barreling towards a pair of armed agents. The agents fired their rifles; the tranquilizer darts impacted uselessly on the tiled floor, as the newly-limber Director Daniel Asheworth suddenly leapt onto the ceiling and swung forward on a light fixture.\n\n\"At least he's behaving like a monkey,\" Cornwell remarked. \"Not like himse—\"\n\nAsheworth pulled the light fixture off the ceiling and landed on the floor in front of the agents. He turned it towards them, the runes glowed red-hot, and both men fell to the ground as the bulb shattered in a sudden burst of light.\n\nRivera squinted. \"So much for that.\"\n\n\"Never seen that spell before,\" said Cornwell.\n\nRivera opened her mouth, frowned, and opened it again. \"Monkeyshine.\"\n\nCornwell glared at her, but did not disagree.\n\nThe next pair of agents were sent sprawling when Asheworth darted up the walls and turned the floor into a slippery black morass. After a moment's hesitation, Cornwell suggested \"Grease monkey?\"\n\nRivera winced, and nodded.\n\nThe next five minutes were an exercise in pain. Three agents trapped against a wall when Asheworth manifested a miniature jail cell around them — \"Monkey bars.\" Two more knocked down by a torrent of tiny yellow creatures, which they would spend the rest of the day coughing up — \"Sea monkeys.\" An electronic lock reprogrammed not to allow the Director to pass, effortlessly circumvented by a few quick keystrokes by gnarled simian fingers — \"Code monkey.\" A hastily thrown-up barricade of old machinery deftly disassembled with a magically-manifested tool — \"Monkey wrench.\" By the time Asheworth was in the elevator, both women had their heads in their hands.\n\n\"On the plus side,\" said Rivera, \"The rules for this version of his magic make sense.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n**[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|Site-43:## Ipperwash Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n\"I don't get it. He's just... doing his job?\" Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate watched the once, and hopefully future, Dr. Daniil Sokolsky through the one-way glass. Sokolsky was filling out paperwork, and scowling in a particularly pouty manner.\n\n\"Yeah,\" said Dr. Lillian Lillihammer.
