Centered in Latin America where magic and the anomalous are just as part of its culture and history, as well as covering themes such as imperialism, liberation theology, oppression, institutions holding onto the status quo, and much more! \n\n[[*user Kilerpoyo]] has given us the time to interview them to share their thoughts: \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**1.) What inspired you to create Our Open Veins?**\n\nAt the core of SCP there is the question of what is 'normal' and what should be 'normal'. It is such an obvious and important question and yet, there are few 'universes' or writing projects where this question takes such a fundamental role as in SCP. Here in the wiki I found a place where I could explore assumptions and questions about the political and material reality that surrounds me. It was an opportunity to good to let go. \n\nThis was not my original plan, though. As many others here, I was (and still am) interested in simply reading and writing weird fiction. However, I found myself feeling disconnection with a common narrative I noticed in SCP. The Foundation is often presented as a 'necessary evil' with the goal to protect the status quo. Then the ethical question that usually follows is 'how far should the Foundation go to achieve this goal'. The methods and the reach of the Foundation are questioned but this 'normalcy' is assumed to be at least in part worth protecting. \n\nThat dilemma never resonated with me. It was clear the system was not working here. The tragedy of SCP resided not only in the magnitude of the sacrifices but also in the fact that even if it worked the way its supposed to it will only perpetuate a system that benefits the few at the detriment of the many. I'm not saying that I'm the only or the first one to think something like this, for example, there is [[[SCP-6001]]] and the Vanguard timeline. I really like those articles, they were an inspiration, and I deeply respect the writers. They are much more skillful than me. However, I was still feeling unsatisfied. Something was missing for me. It was not perfectly clear at the beginning but I knew I needed to say something. And so I decided to hit the keyboard and write. \n\n**2.) What are your favorite entries that best represent the canon?**\n\nThat is a though question. I really recommend \"[[[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/tijuana-gothic| Tijuana Gothic]]]\" by Din-Bidor, \"[[[hatuey|Hatuey, the First American Rebel]]]\" by Diogene_s and Uncle Nicolini and [[[SCP-6821]]] by TopDownUnder. From my own writing I would highlight [[[SCP-6755]]], [[[SCP-6038]]], [[[la-llorona-model|La Llorona Model]]], and finally the latest entry [[[SCP-8503]]].\n\n**3.) Our Open Veins tackles heavy themes such as imperialism and colonialism within Latin America. What motivated you to write about that?**\n\nIt is hard to grow in Latin America without paying attention to everything that is broken around you. Eventually you start normalizing it, it is just part of reality. It is 'normalcy'. And if this was the 'normalcy' that must be protected, then there is no moral dilemma. The Foundation is clearly in the wrong.\n\nIt may sound like I'm getting mad at a fictional organization for not solving the problems of the real world. Don't get me wrong, I'm mad at the real world organizations that the Foundation can be an stand-in. Every story, every narrative, every myth is a reflection of the culture that produced it. And the SCP mythos were originally conceptualized from a First World perspective where the idea of a powerful organization protecting the world made some kind of sense. As I mentioned, that never really vibed with me.\n\nThe concept of 'Necropolitics' by Cameroonian historian Achille Mbembe helped me to better understand my inquietudes. The Foundation takes on a different dimension when looked through the lenses of this theory. \"We die in the dark, so you can live in the light.\" is fundamentally a necropolitical statement. From a Global South perspective, it is clear we are not supposed to be the ones that get to live in the light. This theme is also explained by 'dependency theory', the core thesis of Eduardo Galeano's book \"The Open Veins of Latin America\" from which this canon takes its name. Galeano argues that the underdevelopment in the Global South is not natural but the result exploitation by the developed nations in the North.\n\nObviously, I was also inspired by Latin American fiction, which is full of masterful works that blend fantastical elements with social realities. There is \"Pedro Páramo\" by Juan Rulfo, a surrealist ghost story about the horrors of the Mexican Revolution. \"100 years of Solitude\", one of the definitive works of magical realism, has an episode dedicated to the crimes against humanity done in behalf of the United Fruit Company. While not part of the magical realism or fantasy genres, the neo-noir \"Belascoarán\" seies, by Paco Ignacio Tabio II is also a a heavy inspiration. It follows the misadventures of a private eye in Mexico City, while he faces bizarre cases and state corruption.\n\nIn the realm of comics, we have \"Eternauta\" by Héctor Germán Oesterheld, a comic that used sci-fi to evade the censorship of the Argentinian dictatorship. More recently, there is \"Los Perros Salvajes\" by Edgar Clement, a graphic novel about a group of nahuales guerrilleros in the Mexican Drug War. My ongoing OOV series, \"Ravens and Vypers\" and \"Carteland\", draw heavily from that comic. I see Our Open Veins a place where the SCP mythos meets this tradition of Latin America literature, a blend that I hope will bring interesting results.\n\n**4.) Was Our Open Veins intended to be a canon initially? If not, how did it grow to become one?**\n\nOriginally it started as a series \"Ravens and Vypers\". This series, that originally was not even named, follow Las Víboras, a left-wing guerrilla splintered from the Serpent Hand in their fight against the Valravn Corporation and the Sin Nombre drug cartel. Other authors showed interested in the story and setting, they reached for collab and the, one day, we had met the requisites for the canon status.\n\n**5.) What are your plans for Our Open Veins going forward?**\n\nI need to finish the last entry on \"Ravens and Vipers\", the battle to defend Mictlán against the imperialistic ambitions of Valravn. But I´m also currently writing a SCP about the Valkyries, and will also soon make a new version of the Valravn Corporation Hub, which is kind of outdated, to better reflect the GOI role in the OOV canon. There is also other authors that are working on new entries and perspectives for the canon. They are doing a wonderful work.\n\n**6.) Would you like to share any tips/advice for writers who wish to contribute to the canon?**\n\nMy advice would be to write about you now and what you care about. Many non Latin Americans have expressed their concerns about writing in a Latin American setting, which is totally fair. But he core themes of Our Open Veins are, to be fair, universal. They can be applied to other cultural context. The 'canon', the continuity, doesn't really matter. If you think that OOV can be a tool for you to talk something that matters to you, feel free to use it. Or feel free to take anything you find interesting and useful and apply it to your own think. That is the beuty of the collaborative writing of our wiki.\n\n**7.) Do you have any final thoughts you would like to share with readers?**\n\nI want to thank everyone for the support for this canon. While it takes a critical view of the Foundation and the SCPverse, it is not mean to invalidate the joy this universe has brought us. We have built a beautiful community, open to everyone. \n\nEduardo Galeano said that utopia is always on the horizon. Like mirage, the closer we walk toward it, the farther it gets. But utopia, fiction, dreams... they set the direction that we should walk to.  These are challenging times but we should never stop writing, we should never stop dreaming of a better world. Nor should we lose the sight of utopia. We can not afford to. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Strange Matter//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts!
