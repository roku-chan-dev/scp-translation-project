Sometime during October 2016, the town entered an IO-Locked Scenario (see below).\n\nThe entirety of the town was confined within the dates October 1st 2016 and October 31st 2016. Cultural trends, weather, food/water supplies, etc., remained consistent to how it was during this timeframe, with physical resources anomalously replenishing themselves through as-of-yet unknown means.\n\nThe IO-Locked Scenario that affected EXB-08831 lasted 2,617 days before abruptly self-terminating on January 1st 2024. During that time, EXB-08831's anomalous effects caused October 2016 to occur eighty-six (86) times in succession. During the Scenario, citizens of Halloween were anomalously imperceptive to the lack of temporal progression, and it was impossible for citizens of Halloween to leave the city.\n\nIn the aftermath of the Scenario ending, the citizens of EXB-08831 are being aided in adjusting to the year 2024.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n\n= **Foundation Research Archives**\n= **Common Anomalous Zones and How they Operate, Volume 12.**\n\n> **A Locked Scenario (LS)** occurs when an event, incident, or sequence of actions is anomalously extended past its logical expiration. These phenomena should not be confused with **Temporal Loops (TL)**, which create brackets of repeating time - Locked Scenarios merely repeat the event itself as time progresses. To achieve this effect, an LS will often alter human perception, along with any number of core scientific principles. Often mischaracterized as \"hauntings\" or \"curses\", some examples of Locked Scenarios in the Foundation database include [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-112 SCP-112], [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4382 SCP-4382], and [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-1337 SCP-1337]. As each of these documents demonstrate, Locked Scenarios can be incredibly dangerous, and require proper understanding for their safe containment and/or resolution.\n>\n> An LS will operate under two set variables: //Protracted vs. Indefinite//, and //Static vs. Organic.//\n>\n> * **A Protracted LS (P-LS)** will eventually self-terminate.\n> * **An Indefinite LS (I-LS)** will be self-sustaining.\n>\n> High-sensitivity Kant Counters can be used to tell these phenomena apart. The more common P-LS will show a gradual decline in Hume levels, culminating in a total field collapse or \"burnout\". An I-LS will show steady, or bare fluctuations in Hume levels, and will always require some form of external resolution.\n>\n> * **A Static LS (S-LS)** will only repeat a sequence of events.\n> * **An Organic LS (O-LS)** will \"progress\" within its own set confines.\n>\n> Consider this separation in terms of a baseball game. In an S-LS, the game will repeat its nine innings over and over. In an O-LS, the game will continue into a 10th inning and beyond, with the score progressively increasing. Combining these factors, a Locked Scenario can be interchangeably characterized as PO-LS, or IS-LS, etc.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\nAs an employee of Site-122, I can confidently say Oklahoma might be the most non-anomalous state in America, and one of the most non-anomalous places in the world. Prior to Halloween, the most anomalous thing in Site-122 was a Walkman that incited hallucinations that even amnestics couldn't scrub. We contained it by putting it in an old shoe box in one of the lockers.\n\nSo once we got a real anomaly, a bonafide Keter-class IO-Locked Scenario, an entire town abruptly losing all connection to the outside world, it was all hands on deck. Site-122 was maybe more lax with rules than we should've been, half the staff barely knew how to administer amnestics, seeing as that shoebox hadn't been opened in seven years. We needed to outsource our interviews to keep them consistent.\n\nAnd despite that, Halloween became a passion project. And while it maybe led to some less than stellar following of protocol, I would like to hope we did it right.\n\n[[>]]\n//Alexandria Thompson,//\n//Director of Reintegration, Durant, Oklahoma,//\n//Former Site-122 Director, Durant, Oklahoma.//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n//The Mayor of Halloween, Oklahoma, **Douglas Hamilton**, is sitting across a table from Dr. [[[SCP-6494|Amity Thorn]]], member of the Foundation Media Department.//\n\n**Thorn:** So, um.

My go-to example is [[[SCP-5858|a play that went on for, like, two-thousand acts straight.]]] Act, intermission, act, intermission, on loop for three years. No one even thought it was weird.\n\n**Hamilton:** Is that... This thing, is that what happened here?\n\n**Thorn:** //(pause)// More or less. There's a lot more terminology, but I'm not one to explain what Hume levels and the like are. That's everything that needs to be known to get the gist. Point is, anyway, not alone. But Halloween went on for a lot longer than usual.\n\n**Hamilton:** And you're here to help, document it, correct?\n\n**Thorn:** Yes. Media department, and we know a couple studios to help make that vision a reality, too. Between you and me, the Foundation isn't used to PR, so our media department is a lot of run-off from other media companies now out of work, like Pixar and MGM[[footnote]]In the aftermath of SCP-8300, a large amount of media-production industry personnel were left unemployed.

Meeting these people, and helping. It's fulfilling, cathartic.\n\n**Hamilton:** Is that what we are to-\n\n**Thompson:** Sir. You can't tell me anything I haven't told myself. I've let down my people so much. They transferred me to Site-122 from //Site-19//. Because I wasn't enough, because I let my team down in the eleventh hour. Please.\n\n**Hamilton:** Why is this about you now?\n\n**Thompson:** It's not. Site-122, we were your captors. We didn't create the Locked Scenario, but we didn't help you. And I'm at fault. Because of our failings, we let you all down. We abused you, kept you happy and content so it never got worse.\n\n**Hamilton:** Then we got out.\n\n**Thompson:** Then you got out.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**Hamilton:** It //is// nice to meet you. It. It really is.\n\n**Thompson:** Likewise. I've heard lovely things.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**Hamilton:** Will we ever be...\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**Hamilton:** Will it be okay?\n\n**Thompson:** ....I don't think so. That's a scar, it runs so deep. But it doesn't have to be okay, because //you're// going to be okay. It's bad now. It'll always be bad. But if life was always happiness, we'd grow numb.\n\n**Hamilton:** That's... That's a fascinating... That's fascinating.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= I think I got it from you.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-8830]]] | SCP-8831 | [[[SCP-8832]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Name:** West Newton, aerial 2013\n> **Author:** Chris\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/3673377 Geograph]\n=====\n> **Name:** Philly Snow Storm Feb. 6, 2010\n> **Author:** Kevin Burkett\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/24514780@N02/4336406440 Flickr]\n=====\n> **Name:** Filming Bloomberg Studio 1.0 with Emily Chang\n> **Author:** Steve Jurvetson\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/44124348109@N01/22761922719 Flickr]\n=====\n> **Name:** Ward at Alpha Hospital\n> **Author:** Jez\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/35319816@N00/912907071 Flickr]\n=====\n> **Name:** New CT Bus\n> **Author:** Oran Viriyincy\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/95482862@N00/2574954774 Flickr]\n=====\n> **Name:** Srebrenica massacre memorial gravestones 2009 1\n> **Author:** Michael Büker\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=6405619 Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n> **Name:** Classroom 2\n> **Author:** misskprimary\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/11032799@N06/1038145678 Flickr]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[/div]]",
