Whatever. So I started a new draft, and this is that. I'm happy with it. And this is my [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hotfish| Author Page]!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n[[include component:image-block-peppo\n|name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7012/reactor.png\n|caption=SCP-7012's Akiva Siphon\n|width=400px\n]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7012\n\n**Object Class:** Thaumiel\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** This document is locked behind need-to-know Level Five security clearance. SCP-7012 is contained in the basement layer of Site-01, which has been retrofitted with the specifications for High-Value Anomalous Assets, with the inclusion of ten-meter thick concrete walls, comprehensive SRA applications, and faith-agnostic wards. SCP-7012 is also protected by proxy via Site-01 security measures, including the site-wide self-destruct countermeasure.\n\nSCP-7012 has been outfitted with ten Akiva siphons, a previously hypothetical energy production method. SCP-7012 currently provides power to the entirety of Site-01, and the excess energy is stored in a separate, on-base location.\n\nSCP-7012's containment chamber will be inspected weekly for any discrepancies. Detailed instructions are distributed to containment technicians at this time, of whom will be administered Class-V amnestics at the end of the maintenance period. On-site medical personnel will verify the amnestic process to confirm informational surety.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7012 is a used NUU brand F4L flip phone. Physically, SCP-7012 is completely nonanomalous.\n\nSCP-7012 possesses a rare Akivian sink, a general term for an entity or object that both absorbs and produces Akiva radiation. Notably, Akivian sinks are associated with the end process of apotheosis. Prior to transcending into proper godhood, the entity undergoing said process will temporarily become an Akivian sink, thus amplifying their potential end-goal energy output by orders of magnitude within a short period of time. Religious organizations or groups typically seek out this state in order to realize their respective object of worship, although they may not be specifically aware of this quality.\n\nIt was previously believed that only sapient entities can produce an Akivian sink, and by virtue of Akiva radiation, hold massive influence over consensus reality. Given that SCP-7012 is not sapient, the Akiva particles remain unused, perpetually accumulating Akiva radiation.\n\nDue to the transitive properties of Akiva particles, combined with SCP-7012's lack of miracle-system output, SCP-7012 would singlehandedly trigger apotheosis in partnership with another belief-attuned entity. As such, SCP-7012 will be indefinitely contained at Site-01, and if necessary, decommissioned.\n\n**Addendum 7012/1:** Prior to containment, SCP-7012 was used as intended by the manufacturer. Although multiple contacts were listed in the phone directory, the only saved messages are that of \"name pending\". Twelve calls and over two thousand text messages were found, communicating with this individual. The context for these messages are unclear.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 80%]]###808080|**2/20**##[[/size]]\n----\n[[span class=\"green\"]]Greetings.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"blue\"]]Hey, there, handsome *winks at you*[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"green\"]]In the simplest terms, I am the first being, produced from nothing before time and space.
