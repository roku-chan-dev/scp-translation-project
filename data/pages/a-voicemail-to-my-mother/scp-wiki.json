You don’t care.  \nBut I keep talking, because if I don’t,  \nthen it’s real, and  \nI can’t  \nhandle  \nthat.  \n. . .   \nCan you?  \nThe sound of the beep after every message, it’s louder than the words I say.  \nLouder than you ever were.  \n\nDo you remember when you held me?  \nYou were the sun then.  \nWarm. Bright. Alive.  \nNow you’re nothing but\ndarkness  \nclinging to the walls.  \n\n//No, that’s not right. You’re less than that.//\n. . .  \nThey said it was nature, what happened.  \nThey said it was just life doing what life does.  \nBut what is life without you?  \nI am  \ndead wood  \non a dying tree.  \nDry. Cracked. Reaching for light that doesn’t exist anymore.  \nBecause you’re gone.  \n. . .  \nGone.  \nYou took yourself away, and you didn’t even  \nask me  \nif it was okay to leave.  \nI’m still waiting.  \nHere.  \nRight where you left me.  \n\n//Silence//  \nis louder than grief.  \n\nI wish you could see me now.  \nBut I don’t.  \nBecause if you did, you’d see a mess.  \nA monster made of all the  \nthings  \nI couldn’t become.  \nDo you even remember what I used to be?  \nThe little boy who crawled into your bed, who thought you were  \ninvincible.  \nBut you weren’t.  \n. . .  \nYou weren’t.  \n. . .  \nDo you dream about me?  \nI dream about you.  \nEvery.  \nSingle.  \nNight.  \nBut in the dreams, you don’t say anything.  \nYou just stand there.  \nWatching me.  \nYour eyes... black.  \nEmpty.  \nLike you’re waiting for me to follow you.  \n. . .  \nI wake up in a sweat. Every time.  \nReaching out for you,  \nbut you’re not there.  \nYou never will be again.  \n\nI’m sorry.  \nI know I’ve failed you.  \nYou expected more from me. You said I’d do great things.  \nGreat things.  \nBut I haven’t done  \nanything.  \nNot one thing worth remembering.  \n//Would you even recognize me now?//  \n. . .  \nNo.  \nNo, you wouldn’t.  \nYou’d look at me and see a hollow thing,  \nan empty shell,  \nthe boy who couldn’t keep you alive.  \n\nI still have your letters.  \nI found them in that drawer I wasn’t supposed to open.  \nThey’re falling apart now, like everything else.  \nYou wrote them before I was born.  \nBefore I even existed,  \nyou had dreams.  \n. . .  \nDo you remember those dreams?  \nBecause I don’t think I do anymore.  \n\nThere’s a part of me that still feels like that child.  \nThe one who thought the world would stop spinning if you just held me long enough.  \nBut the world didn’t stop.  \nIt just... left me behind.  \n\nNow I talk to ghosts.  \nTo you.  \n. . .  \nWhat’s left of you, anyway.  \nI think of that night sometimes.  \nThe night they told me you were gone.  \nAnd I knew.  \nBefore they even said it, I knew.  \nIt’s like my heart broke before the words left their mouths.  \nSo quiet.  \nSo soft.  \nI don’t know if hearts make noise when they break.  \nBut I heard mine.  \n\nDo you want to know what I miss most?  \nNot the big things.  \nNo.  \nNot your death.  \nNot the finality of it.  \nNo, it’s the small things.  \nThe way you laughed.  \nThe way you hummed when you cooked.  \nThe way you tilted your head when you thought too hard.  \nThose are the things I hold onto.  \n. . .  \nBut even those are fading now, slipping through my fingers like water.  \n\nI never got to say goodbye.  \nNever told you how much I loved you.  \nStill love you.  \n. . .  \nNow I have all these words, and nowhere to put them.  \nI talk to this voicemail like it’ll bring you back.  \nBut you’re not coming back.  \nAre you?\n\nMa,  \nif you can hear this,  \nwherever you are,  \nI’m still here.  \nWaiting.  \n. . .  \nFor the phone to ring.  \nFor your voice, just once,  \nto tell me you haven’t forgotten.  \n\nBut all I ever hear is the────\n[[size 70%]]**Beep.**[[/size]]",
