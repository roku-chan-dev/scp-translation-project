A surveillance team has been formed to confirm and report any changes related to the object. If the object emits light from its yellowish material, the surveillance team must update the on-site directors.\n\nAs soon as SCP-001-EL stops shining, the surveillance team must look for anomalies that form on the surface of the object. After the entity or the artifact lands at an abandoned location or vanishes from view, a containment AKM from the nearest Site must go to the location to contain and record the anomaly. If anomalies do not emerge out of SCP-001-EL, search for other anomalies except entities and artifacts must ensue.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-el.wikidot.com/local--files/protasi-tou-ags/%CE%A7%CE%AC%CF%81%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%82\n| caption=The current location of SCP-001-EL.\n| width=300px\n| align=right]]\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-001-EL is the designation of a celestial body that is currently in the thermosphere, in a mountainous area north of the region of Epirus in Greece. The object appears to have an imperfect spherical shape, with a diameter of about 12.4 km. Its interior consists of an unknown material that absorbs 83.3% of light, and is almost completely covered by another unknown material, yellowish and extremely radioactive.\n\nThe object emits approximately 354,400 Sv of ionizing radiation, although the gamma waves do not extend beyond a radius of 680 meters from the surface of SCP-001-EL. They are obstructed by an invisible anomalous natural boundary, which consists of a peripheral area about 13 km in diameter that follows the location of the anomaly in a specific area where it is located.\n\nIn a period of about 72 hours, a light source is emitted by SCP-001-EL, which lasts for about 3 hours. At the last hour, the glow stops and an artifact or random entity is formed from the black material inside the object, which is moved by an unknown controlling force to a random area of ​​Greece or Cyprus, where it usually settles in areas not inhabited by humans. Studies show that the formation or activation of abnormal positions in Greece and Cyprus occurred at the same time that the brightness was transmitted by SCP-001-EL, at a different time within the period of 72 hours.\n\nSome anomalies formed by SCP-001-EL can be found on the Foundation's registered anomalies page.\n\nSCP-001-EL was discovered after a series of anomalies was documented by the SCP Foundation in some areas of Greece and Cyprus. Due to these huge new records of anomalies, the Greek SCP Foundation was created to control anomalies in these areas.\n\n**SUPPLEMENTARY DOCUMENT 001-EL-1:** The anomaly was first discovered by the EM Lab (acronym \"Ektoras Megalos\")[[footnote]] Group of Interest of the Greek SCP Foundation. It is an independent organization founded by Ektoras Megalos, before the establishment of the Greek SCP Foundation. The team was responsible for studying and recording the anomalies of the time. [[/footnote]] ,on 04/09/1986, where it was found in a compact size after a mission carried out by members of the Group of Interest in a touristic cave at ██████ ████████.\n\nAt the date of discovery of the anomaly by the Laboratory, the anomalous effects of the object were classified as safe.\n\nThe following document refers to SCP-001-EL, and was found in the EM Lab database.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ DOCUMENT RECOVERED FROM EM LAB\n| hide=- CLOSE DOCUMENT\n]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px black; background:#212121; padding:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ##00BFFF|EM LAB##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px black; background:#00BFFF; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/966656939977216060/972528575565668442/IMG_6065.jpg\n| aling=left\n| width=300px\n| caption= EM-152\n]]\n\n##00BFFF|**{{OBJECT #:## ##white|EM-152**##\n}}\n\n##00BFFF|**{{CLASSIFICATION:## ##white|Artifact**}}##\n\n##00BFFF|**{{THREAT LEVEL:## ##00FF7F|3**}}##\n\n##00BFFF|**{{SIZE:## ##white|40 meters in diameter ##**}}\n\n##00BFFF|**{{CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:## ##white|EM-152 must be stored in a cardboard box.

We are an organization responsible for recording and studying anomalous artifacts, entities, places and events.\n> \n> **Ektoras Megalos:** …Understood.\n> \n> **O5-█:** Basically, we do the same job as your Lab. Now, could you tell me, how many anomalies have you documented so far?\n> \n> **Ektoras Megalos:** We’ve documented about 500, give or take.\n> \n> **O5-█:** Do you know about…\n> \n> //O5-█ picks up some pieces of paper.//\n> \n> **O5-█:** ΕΜ-152?\n> \n> **Ektoras Megalos:** A personnel member informed me about the condition of this object.
