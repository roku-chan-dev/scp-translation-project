Especially if you're not going to drive.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"You never let me, Pyotr! You said I wasn't licensed for a vehicle this size!\" \n[[/>]]\n\n\"Yeah, that's right. \nI don't think we'll get stopped, but I'd rather not risk it.\nAlso, I don't trust you not to crash.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Why would you think that?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Because your last car got written off!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"That doesn't count! I was drunk at the time!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Pavel, that definitely still counts against you.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Oh come on Pyotr, are you really so perfect?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I can honestly say that I've never been in a crash in my life.\nI don't plan to start now.\"\n\n----\n\n[[>]]\n\"You were right, Pyotr. This really is the middle of nowhere.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Do you know why they're making us drive all the way out here?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"What? You really don't know?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Obviously not! I'm asking!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"I guess you wouldn't know. \nThis is where the Black Lodge was founded!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Right here?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"No, you idiot, here as in Siberia! I'm not sure where.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"We've already established Siberia is a big place, Pavel!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Fine. But that makes it perfect if we need to lie low for a while.\nThat's basically how the Black Lodge got started.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I've never heard much about that.\nIs it like, a secret thing you get told about when you become //Zend//?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Nope. I only know because I bought a bottle of Vodka for some of the old-timers.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Apparently, Mister Iosava's father was imprisoned out here in a gulag.\nLike, fifty years ago or something.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Oh, I had heard something about that.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"He managed to escape. Him and a few others. \nBut the problem was, they'd been sent all the way out to Siberia.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"And as we can see, there's fuck all out here!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"He didn't even have a car.\nThey weren't invented back then.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"So how did he get back?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Oh, they were tough back then. They walked.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Fuck, that's a long way. And what did they eat?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Apparently, you bring a new guy with you.\nYou know, not lost all his body fat yet.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"How does that help?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"You can eat him.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Wait, really? I think they were messing with you, Pavel. No way.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"I'm just telling you what I heard.\nAnyway, Mister Iosava's father was hiding out here for a long time.\nEventually, he met up with the crones.\nMade a deal, got power from them, then made his way back to Moscow.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Did he... eat everyone else?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Of course not, a few others came back with him!\nThey hunted for food after that.\nThey became the original Black Lodge.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Are any of them still around?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Maybe one or two. Most got killed fighting cops, or the military, or each other.\nReal tough guys. They don't make criminals like that anymore.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"But they were all in prison, right?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Of course! That's where they met!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I just never get why the old-timers brag about how long they spent behind bars.\nIf they were so good at being criminals, why did they end up there in the first place?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"What do you mean?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I mean, the whole point of doing crime is not getting caught, right?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Yeah, but it happens eventually.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Only if someone fucks up. I'm not going to prison if I can help it!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Sure, but prison toughens you up!\nYou come back at least twice as dangerous as before!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"You want to go then, Pavel? For the learning experience?\nI bet we can still find one out here!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Of course not! We have a job to do!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Well there you go.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Pyotr, you'd better not say this around any of the old-timers. \nThey'll eat you alive.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Yeah, they actually would do that, wouldn't they...\nEr... forget I said anything about this!\"\n\n----\n\n\"Pavel, I think we're being followed.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Fuck.

Try to lose it, I guess.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I have been! That's why I left the main road. They followed.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Oh. I didn't notice.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Some map-reader you are.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Fuck you. It has to be them, right?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I'm not so sure.\"\n\n//Pyotr slows, allowing the car to approach.//\n\n[[>]]\n\"What are you doing?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I wanted a closer look.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"And?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Driver's a woman.

The driver's part of it.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"What does that even mean?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"I was working security at an event one time. \nThat car was parked outside, I went over to check it out. \nHer arms are connected into it, where the steering wheel and gearstick should be.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Why the fuck would anyone do that?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Same reason rich guys have fancy cars.

The black car swerves to avoid them, but still runs over Pavel's outstretched hand.//\n\n\"GOD DAMMIT! Pavel...\"\n\n//The two bodies quickly recede into the distance. Pyotr's foot remains on the accelerator, as the black car approaches him.//\n\n\"Fuck you.\"\n\n//Pyotr takes his foot off the accelerator, and briefly brakes instead. The black car swerves to the left to avoid him. The vehicles are now side by side.//\n\n//Looking across at the open roof of the convertible, Pyotr sees the driver on the far side, her left arm buried in the dashboard and her right arm joined to the gearstick. The bald male passenger is closer to Pyotr, and smiles and waves at him. There is a naked thing curled up on the back seat.//\n\n\"FUCK OFF!\"\n\n//Pyotr floors the accelerator and swerves to the left, slamming his white van into the black car. The vehicle is forced into a metal crash barrier at the side of the road, and abruptly stops moving forward.//\n\n\"SHIT!\"\n\n//Pyotr swerves to the right to avoid crashing into the same barrier, and flips the van onto its left-hand side. It slides across the tarmac with a deafening screech, then stops.//\n\n----\n\n\"Ow... Fuck...\"\n\n//The van is on its side. Pyotr held in his seat by his seatbelt, still clutching the steering wheel. He lets go, and struggles to get out of his seat, landing in broken glass and cutting his hand and face. He then looks into the back of the van.//\n\n\"Oh shit.\"\n\n//Red liquid is splattered over all their supplies. Pyotr climbs into the back of the van, then immediately pulls open the leaking black bag to reveal an intact testicle.//\n\n\"Fuck me. That's a relief.\" \n\n//He slumps down to sit on the wall of the van, which is now the floor. One of the back doors is open to reveal the road outside. A person with very long limbs is climbing out of the crashed car behind him.//\n\n\"God dammit...\"\n\n//Pyotr climbs over the chair to retrieve his pistol from the glove compartment, then vaults back over the seat to point it out the back of the van. Although he can no longer see anyone, he can hear a calm voice.//\n\n[[=]]\n\"I don't suppose you're willing to exchange insurance information?\nI borrowed that car from a friend, so this is very embarrassing.\" \n[[/=]]\n\n\"Stay the fuck away!\"\n\n= \"I take it you're going to be difficult. Very well. Fetch!\"\n\n//Something runs onto the road from the side, and approaches the doors of the van. Pyotr opens fire at it as it runs towards him on all fours.//\n\n\"DIE!\"\n\n//Most of Pyotr's shots miss, but the last few drop it just as a creature resembling a hairless dog approaches the back door of the van. Pyotr keeps firing until the gun is empty.//\n\n\"What the hell is that!\"\n\n//Now that it lies still, it is clear that it is actually a man, his body reshaped to give it the proportions of a dog.//\n\n[[=]]\n\"Did you just shoot my dog? \nDo you have any idea how hard it was to train after I made it?\"\n[[/=]]\n\n//The voice comes from the side of the van, now very close. Pyotr tries to reload the pistol as quickly as possible.//\n\n//An arm extends into the van through the open back door, snatches the pistol out of Pyotr's hand with long fingers, then quickly retracts to the outside.//\n\n= \"I will take that.\"\n\n\"What the hell are you!\"\n\n//There is a clatter as the pistol is tossed away onto the tarmac.//\n\n= \"I would like to talk to you.\"\n\n\"What do you want?\"\n\n//A bald head leans over to look through the open doors at the back of the van, and a hand reaches in. The man's entire body seems to be stretched.//\n\n= \"I would like to take your... organ.\"\n\n\"My organs?\"\n\n= \"No. The organ you have been transporting.\"\n\n//The stretched man's body remains outside the van, but his arm elongates as it reaches towards the giant testicle. Pyotr clutches it to his chest with both arms. There is a soft squelch, and red liquid soaks into his clothing.//\n\n\"Why the hell would you want it?\"\n\n[[=]]\n\"We were planning to use it as part of an exhibition exploring the boundary between life and death.\nMy collaborator may no longer be up for that after falling off a moving vehicle... \nThere's still plenty I can do with the flesh of a demigod. Give it to me.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Never!\"\n\n//The hand tries to pull the testicle away from Pyotr, but can't get a good grip on the smooth and slippery surface. The hand moves towards Pyotr's right hand.//\n\n= \"Let go of it, or I will make you let go.\"\n\n\"You can't make me do anything!\"\n\n//The hand grabs the index finger of Pyotr's right hand, and bends it backward. There is no pain. It simply flexes and stretches until the fingertip touches the back of Pyotr's hand//\n\n\"What the fuck!\"\n\n= \"You have nine more fingers.\"\n\n//The hand moves towards his middle finger. Pyotr begins to cry as it bends backward as easily as the other one.//\n\n= “You can let go at any time.”\n\n[[>]]\n\"PYOTR!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n//Pavel approaches from behind the stretched man, running on all fours along the road. He is covered in blood and resembles a mixture between a gorilla, a wolf and a pig.//\n\n\"Pavel! You're alive!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"It'll take more than that to kill me!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n//Pavel charges towards the stretched man, who calmly walks towards him. He is over six feet tall, but most of his height comes from his legs. His extended fingers reach down past his knees.//\n\n= \"I have no intention of killing you.\"\n\n//As Pavel's massive left arm swings down, it is effortlessly blocked by the stretched man's upraised right arm, Pavel's forearm limply bending in half.//\n\n[[>]]\n\"FUCK.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n//The stretched man shoves Pavel's face with his left hand, the flesh of Pavel's snout deforming like clay. He then kicks Pavel's knee with one foot, buckling and distorting his leg.// \n//Pavel falls to the ground and rolls onto his back. The stretched man presses down one of his long feet onto Pavel's chest, leaving a deep imprint in his flesh.//\n\n[[=]]\n\"Stay down please. \nI will come back to you later.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n//He turns back to face Pyotr.//\n\n[[=]]\n\"Hand over the organ, or I will turn you inside out. \nI do not usually have the time for that.\nBut if you insist, I will make the extra effort.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n\"The organ?\"\n\n[[=]]\n\"Yes, I believe we already established which organ I am referring to.\nI understand that it's been a long day for you, but I would rather not repeat myself unless necessary.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n\"If you're going to come all the way out here to take it, call it what it is.\"\n\n= \"I'm sorry?\"\n\n\"Tell me you can't wait to get your hands on my giant testicle. \nGo on. Say it, you sick son of a bitch.\"\n\n//The stretched man looked confused.//\n\n[[=]]\n\"I really don't see why you want your last coherent words to be crass humor. \nIt is a lot less amusing than you think.\"\n[[/=]]\n\n//Pavel, still lying on the ground, sinks his teeth into the stretched man's ankle.//\n//The flesh warps, but the stretched man still falls to the ground in a confused tangle of long limbs.//\n\n[[>]]\n\"FUCK YOU!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n//Pavel rolls on top of the stretched man, jaws opening wider to tear chunks out of his neck and torso. Although his flesh deforms like clay, it still bleeds whenever small pieces are torn off.//\n\n= “Get off me!”\n\n//The stretched man pushes Pavel’s shoulder away from him with one hand, folding Pavel’s spine backward as he uses his other arm to push himself up.//\n\n= “It seems I underestimated you.”\n\n//Pavel continues to struggle, but the stretched man now stands over him, grabbing and twisting his flailing arms and legs.//\n\n= “I will have to tie these limbs into a knot.”\n\n//Pyotr lets go of the testicle, grabs a tire iron from the chaotic mess inside the van, and approaches the stretched man from behind.//\n\n=  “Maybe I’ll even add a pretty bow?”\n\n//Pyotr slams the tire iron into the back of the stretched man’s bald head. The flesh deforms like soft clay.//\n\n= “What?”\n\n//The stretched man’s head spins on his shoulders to face behind him. Pyotr strikes him in the eye with the tire iron.//\n\n= “Damnit!”\n\n//Pyotr keeps swinging as the stretched man raises his arms to defend himself.//\n\n“DIE! DIE! DIE!”\n\n//Pavel forces himself up by breaking multiple bones in his own body, then leaps upon the stretched man, knocking him to the ground.//\n\n[[>]]\n“Hit him while he’s down!”\n[[/>]]\n\n//The two of them beat and maul the stretched man until he becomes a bloody smear on the tarmac. The two men then continue attacking the vaguely human shape until it stops screaming.//\n\n“You think he’s dead now?”\n\n[[>]]\n\"No idea. Looks like it.\nI’m pretty sure this was the head...”\n[[/>]]\n\n“You’re eating him?”\n\n[[>]]\n“Not swallowing. Just chewing.”\n[[/>]]\n\n//Pavel spits out blood, and rubbery pieces of flesh.//\n\n“What about the other one?”\n\n[[>]]\n“The corpse? It kept attacking me even after we both fell off the roof, so I tore it to pieces.”\n[[/>]]\n\n“And that killed it?”\n\n[[>]]\n\"I'm pretty sure it was already dead.\" \n[[/>]]\n\n\"You know what I mean. You made it... deader?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"The pieces never stopped twitching. \nBut once they were too small to do anything, I came to find you.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Good thing you did. He fucked up my fingers pretty bad.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"He fucked me up a lot worse.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“You seem to be recovering.”\n\n//Pavel winces, as his spine straightens with a series of cracks.//\n\n[[>]]\n\"The stuff I injected is really good for that. You should try some.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“I don’t think I should while driving.”\n\n[[>]]\n\"You think we can still drive that wreck?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n[[>]]\n\"I can’t believe you got this piece of shit to work.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“Don’t talk about her that way!”\n\n[[>]]\n\"Her?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“I guess I’m pretty attached to this van now. Good thing I had spare tires.”\n\n[[>]]\n\"And also me, to flip it back over.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Good thing you take steroids!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"It's a shame that sportscar drove off.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Why?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Even after the crash, it would have been a lot faster than this.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"And you think the driver would be OK with that? \nThe car doesn't even have a steering wheel! Just her arm!\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"I'm good at talking to women.\nI can be persuasive when I want to be.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"You never lack confidence.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Thanks, Pyotr.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"That wasn't actually a compliment, Pavel.\"\n\n----\n\n\"It still hasn't worn off?\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"It's only been a few hours. \nI'm sure I'll get back to normal eventually.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Pavel, I want to thank you for saving my ass back there.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Of course I did. We're friends.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I think we're more than that.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"What?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"You're like a brother to me.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"That was the gayest thing I've ever heard.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Says the man who injected himself with spunk!”\n\n[[>]]\n\"What?”\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I mean, it is Orok’s ball...\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"It’s not spunk! It’s… er... masculine vitality? \nOh fuck, you’re right.”\n[[/>]]\n\n\"Don’t worry about it. Not many men get the honor of being Orok’s bitch.\"\n\n[[>]]\n“Fuck you!”\n[[/>]]\n\n\"I promise I’ll be a good uncle. If you get pregnant.”\n\n[[>]]\n\"Fuck you! Wait… could that actually happen?\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“Probably not. You only had sex with him once.” \n\n[[>]]\n\"This isn’t funny!\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“This is so fucking funny.”\n\n[[>]]\n\"You tell anyone else about this, you’re dead, //Orin//.\"\n[[/>]]\n\n“Pavel, that’s no way to speak to your best friend.\"\n\n[[>]]\n\"Pyotr, that’s exactly how I speak to my best friend. \nDon't you forget it.”\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@ \n\n[[>]]\n[[[Hid From The Presence]]] >>\n[[/>]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
