No further containment is necessary. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4270 is the preserved corpse of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States. SCP-4270 is entirely unremarkable. SCP-4270’s physiology is entirely consistent with that of SCP-4270. No records of SCP-4270 engaging in anomalous activity during its lifetime have been discovered. Further information regarding SCP-4270 is restricted to personnel with Level 3/4270 clearance or higher.\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"► INPUT LEVEL 3/4270 SECURITY CREDENTIALS ◄\" hide=\"▼ DECRYPTION KEY ACCEPTED.

As such, the containment and investigation of SCP-4270 and its anomalous effects have been assigned to the Foundation Antimemetics Division. Information pertaining to SCP-4270’s normalization effects has been restricted to individuals with Level 3/4270 access or higher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4270 is the preserved corpse of Benjamin Harrison, the 23rd President of the United States. By all conceivable measures, SCP-4270 should not be a human. Despite possessing several unusual qualities such as a body weight of 287 kilograms, a long snout, and shaggy black fur, SCP-4270 is perceived as human. When not aware of its anomalous nature, SCP-4270 cannot be perceived or thought of as anything other than a human. This includes biological aspects, actions taken prior to death, and personality traits. SCP-4270 and information pertaining to it are instead thought of as fairly unremarkable, with illegal or immoral actions attributed to SCP-4270 being dismissed as average behavior. This only occurs with factual information pertaining to SCP-4270, as falsified information is immediately identified and disregarded. \n\nWhen aware of its anomalous nature, individuals perceive SCP-4270 as an unidentifiable quadrupedal mammal. Individual traits of SCP-4270 are able to be identified, but these traits are unable to be collectively attributed to a specific organism. It is currently believed that SCP-4270 possesses an antimemetic disassociation effect suppressing knowledge of its actual species. Extensive studies conducted by Foundation parabiologists have been able to identify SCP-4270 as a possible member of the //Arctoidea// infraorder. DNA analysis has shown SCP-4270 being a relative of the //Otariidae// family, although these results are currently under debate as SCP-4270 shows traits not suitable for marine lifestyles, such as large plantigrade paws and small rounded ears. \n\nDocumented accounts of SCP-4270’s life have provided conflicting details of ranging importance. Discovered inconsistencies include: \n* SCP-4270 being the grandson of William Henry Harrison,[[footnote]]The 9th President of the United States[[/footnote]] despite there existing no record of William ever conceiving children. \n* The meeting of SCP-4270’s wife while attending Farmer’s College in Ohio, despite records claiming that it has never had any formal schooling. \n* SCP-4270’s campaign to become the governor of Indiana in 1872, despite being hospitalized for several months due to a hunting accident. \n* SCP-4270’s authorization of the first forest reserve, despite having lived in the authorized area prior to his election.\n* SCP-4270’s claims to follow Presbyterianism, despite engaging in practices commonly associated with various sects of Proto-Sarkicism such as the regular consumption of raw meat and cannibalism. \n* A lack of evidence supporting the continued conceptual existence of SCP-4270 following its presidency.\n\nAs investigations into the validity of these discrepancies have provided conflicting results, further investigation into the source of these discrepancies has been temporarily halted.\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"Footnotes\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[>]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4269]]] | [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-bread-box|Deadly Bread]]] | [[[SCP-4271]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Deadly Bread]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** benharris.png\n> **Name:** Benjamin Harrison, head and shoulders bw photo, 1896\n> **Author:** Pach Brothers \n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Benjamin_Harrison,_head_and_shoulders_bw_photo,_1896.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
