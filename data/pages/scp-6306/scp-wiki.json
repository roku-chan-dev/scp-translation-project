Dr. Wettle is to report further incidents correlating with SCP-6306, if they occur.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-6306 was an A4-sized sheet of paper formerly belonging to Dr. W. Wettle. It contained various '//New Year's Resolution//' goals, though the exact contents of SCP-6306 have yet to be disclosed, as Dr. Wettle refused to elaborate on the written desires he planned to fulfill the coming year.\n\nWhile SCP-6306 itself was non-anomalous, the circumstances surrounding its sudden neutralization[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]See **Incident 6306-1**.[[/span]] warranted its SCP designation. It is unknown whether the incident involving SCP-6306 was caused by an unidentified third party or SCP-6306 itself. Dr. Wettle has prohibited any further exploration into the anomalous makeup of SCP-6306 due to it being \"unnecessary.\"\n\n----\n\n**Incident 6306-1:** The following is a transcription of the events immediately leading to and after SCP-6306's abrupt nullification.\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n**Recording Log**\n\n**Date:** 12/31/21 - 01/01/22\n\n**Foreword:** Footage taken from security cameras implemented within Dr. Wettle's office.\n\n----\n\n**//Footage begins.//**\n\n//[Dr. Wettle is seated in his office chair, skimming through SCP-6306's contents, faintly smiling. He takes a sip from his coffee mug while still holding onto SCP-6306.]//\n\n//[A spark is seen on the bottom-left corner of SCP-6306 before it suddenly catches on fire.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]This occurs exactly on midnight.[[/span]] Dr. Wettle sees this and accidentally chokes on his coffee as he steps from his desk, leaving SCP-6306 resting on top and kicking away his seat as it slides across the room. Dr. Wettle appears confused.]//\n\n//[Dr. Wettle swears under his breath as he notices the coffee stain on his lab coat before turning his attention to SCP-6306. He gradually approaches it before throwing it on the floor and repeatedly stomping on it. Despite this, the fire does not subside and continues spreading throughout SCP-6306. Dr. Wettle sighs, putting his hands on the back of his neck before swiftly exiting his office.]//\n\n//[Five minutes later, Dr. Wettle returns with a fire extinguisher and attempts to extinguish the fire once more. He coughs and closes his eyes as excess amount of haze is released. He eventually succeeds, however, SCP-6306 is entirely disintegrated before the flames were put out. Dr. Wettle sets down the fire extinguisher off-camera.]//\n\n//[A message composed of SCP-6306's ashes remains, reading: \"As if you'd fulfill them anyway.\" Dr. Wettle stares at this for a brief moment before leaving the room to retrieve a dustpan and brush. The rest of the recording shows him silently sweeping the ash and discarding it in the trash bin.]//\n\n**//Footage ends.//**\n\n----\n\n**Afterword:** Dr. Wettle filed a request to take the rest of the day off. Request was accepted.\n[[/div]]\n\n= As of writing, Dr. Wettle has made no attempt to redraft his New Year's Resolution plans.\n~~~~\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6305]]] | SCP-6306 | [[[SCP-6307]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
