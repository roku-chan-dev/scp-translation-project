It seems appropriate, then, that this area is now very, very physically active; the walls are made out of metal and shake with a mechanical rhythm, while the ground seems to be made out of volcanic rock. Steam rises when you take a step, and gouts of fire gutter all around. And all the time, the rhythm, the rhythm, the CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK of some great machine comes from all around, CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK, is it grinding? Is the room moving, or are you? CHUNK-CHUNK-CHUNK.

It appears to have been overtaken by something that resembles both a clean, white operating theater and a classroom. Desiccated humanoid husks sit at desks, odd devices strapped over their heads, all observing a shark-like entity being dissected on a table.//\n\n//A light permeates the room, from top to bottom. A voice speaks, \"Take your seats, students. Class is now in session.\"//\n\nThis voice will grow more and more insistent, but nothing will happen if the Avatars do not take a place in vacant seats and wish to simply move on. If they decide to do so, however, they must make a CTRL Save, as a headset is lowered onto their face, and their mind is filled with knowledge that is incompatible with their native universe. Failure to do so will mean they must sit through the \"lesson\", and take 2 Stress.\n\n------\n\n**9th Sublevel:** //As you proceed to this sublevel, upon the stairwell, you find a leather bound tome.

We always have dimensional incursions on Wednesdays. Well, feel free to rest up here.\"//\n\nThe party may take a Quick Rest here before proceeding.

Most of it looks distressingly human. There are eyes on the walls, soaked with tears.// Players making direct eye contact with the walls take 1 Stress.\n\nThe party should press on. As they do so, ask \"Are you sure?\" after some actions. Not after every action and not every time, but some. Give them a sense of worry and trepidation. Should they press on far enough:\n\n//Flesh has completely overtaken this level, in short. Doors have been replaced by mouths, chairs have been replaced by legs, and desks are made out of arms.//\n\nSearching this area will reveal some first-aid kits that need to be pulled free of the flesh, as well as a sawed-off shotgun (d8 Blast) being held by arms sticking out of a wall.\n\n//There is a portion of the area that is free of gore, almost looking like the ordinary Outpost #87. The door, however, is sealed.// It can be opened with Dr. Penn's passcode, \"//THUNDER ROLLED A SIX//\". //Within it is a large green-ish... cannon-- is the best word you can think of for it, except it's just small enough to be held with two hands.

Critical Damage melts non-grafted organic matter into an indistinguishable puddle. A single hit is capable of destroying any Chaos Lumps you encounter, regardless of Damage. And that's a good thing-- because two dozen of them now drop down from the ceiling.\n\nFiring the Organic Separator creates collateral damage, which in this case means:\n\n//As you fire the weapon, the flesh on the walls... reconstitutes itself into people.
