Note visual artifacts and spatial distortion caused by SCP-7749's anomalous properties.]]\n\n-----\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7749 is to be stored on a pedestal inside of a large Keter-class containment chamber at [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8744 Site-86]. This pedestal is not to be placed less than 10m from any side of the chamber. Personnel are not to enter SCP-7749's containment chamber at any time except for testing. The containment chambers directly above and below SCP-7749's are to remain unoccupied due to the height restrictions of SCP-7749's chamber.\n\nAs of 20/05/2023, finding a way to neutralize SCP-7749's anomalous effects or transport it off-site is considered a top level priority.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7749 is a dark-brown 12oz ceramic mug. SCP-7749 contains a light-brown liquid, identified by personnel to be standard coffee. The volume of liquid contained within SCP-7749 has not been seen to change during its time in Foundation custody.\n\nSCP-7749 possesses a multitude of anomalous properties, including but not limited to:\n* Visual distortion in a roughly 10m radius around SCP-7749. Observers have reported the surrounding area as appearing \"fuzzy\" or reminiscent of a low-resolution image.\n* Spatial distortion within the same radius. This causes SCP-7749 to appear closer to or further from an observer than it actually is.\n* Spontaneous transmutation into various other shapes at random intervals for short periods of time, typically appearing jagged, irregular, and distorted.\n* Spontaneous teleportation at random intervals. Distance teleported has not been observed to exceed 10m in any direction.\n* General instability of space within the 10m radius. This has resulted in the alteration of objects within the area, often appearing distorted in a similar manner to SCP-7749 during its transformations. Sudden disappearance, acceleration, and teleportation of objects within the area has also been observed.\n\nSCP-7749 was discovered on May 18, 2023 inside a break room in Site-86 Facility 4 by multiple personnel. Upon initial reports of the anomaly, the break room was blocked off and attempts were made to transport the object to a containment chamber. Following multiple unsuccessful attempts to get near SCP-7749, a portable Scranton reality anchor (SRA) was deployed to allow agents to transfer the object into a portable containment locker for transportation, after which it was successfully contained. Both the SRA and the portable containment locker sustained significant alteration by SCP-7749 during the event and were rendered inoperable following containment.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 7749.1: Related Documentation**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#f8e8e9 20px 20px/20% no-repeat; margin: auto; max-width: 500px; padding:20px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n18/05/2023\n= **[[size 150%]]{{SCP FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION — PANOPTICON}}[[/size]]**\n\n++++++ The following is the PANOPTICON ping report[[footnote]]The PANOPTICON ping is a signal sent precisely once every five minutes to all Foundation sites worldwide.
