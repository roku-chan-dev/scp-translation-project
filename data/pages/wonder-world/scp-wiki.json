Tee emm. I'm Cat Emmet, loving and beloved tour guide of the great City of Sugar, the Town of the Talk, the Musical Metropolis -- oh, it goes by many names~! Truly, its reputation precedes it. But for the some few of you who have yet to get the rundown -- perhaps pulled here by a friend, or worse -- well, we shouldn't talk about //that,// but you should know this city is one built out of the dreams of refugees. All who find themselves in dire straits are welcome here, oh I assure you! And I'm here to give you that //won//derful warm and whimsical welcome! From our train platform here, you have likely already noticed the visage of our //sharpest// skyscraper -- oh, and it //does// actually scrape the sky -- Wonder Tower, the home of the great Dr. Wondertainment, both the man and the myth alike! Well, a woman right now, but //man// and //myth// alliterate, and I haven't worked out a good alternative yet, tsk tsk! Whatever I think up, the next group of tourists will hear it, you can be sure.\n\nBut enough spiel, time for more spiel~! Wonder World! Tee emm, founded in the 12th Wonder Year by Chester Williams and Maria Herring, gifted to our great Wondertainments of yore by Capital R -- if you squint while we pass this intersection, you'll see his statue just over those buildings, more on that if you join my tour on Bluesday, and yes, I work Bluesdays -- I won't judge you for showing up if you don't judge me for being there~! But anyhow, Wonder World! Tee emm is an extradimensional space located somewhere semi-secret in Boston, that was created originally as extra floor space and storage space for the first Dr. Wondertainment storefront, Dr. Wondertainment's World of Whimsy! //That// version of the location was actually created as early as the //3rd// Wonder Year, which most people don't know, but it got its name -- and zoning laws -- in the 12th. Yes, we're walking through what was once a //closet.//\n\nImpressive, isn't it? It was a combination of Maria Herring and Capital R's magic that allowed the space to expand so gratuitously, and then it was Chester's idea to create the sky and weather patterns to make it feel //outdoors!// Only, a nicer, more sanitary version of the outdoors, anyways. You people live with unscheduled rain and snow, don't you? Hoo-ah! I couldn't imagine. Never again will you be so taken off-guard in Wonder World! Tee emm. Our weather is actually democratic -- so, you can imagine it stays sunny most of the year, though our hearts do yearn for snow around the holidays. More about our governmental systems and voting booths on Peruseday -- what better place to peruse?\n\nAh, but here is our first stop for day one! Yes, this should give you the context you need to understand everything going forward. Welcome, my friends, to the Wonder World! Tee emm, Hysterically Hurtful Historical Society! Oh, don't be put off by the name -- see, \"hurt\" is a synonym of \"smart\"! Did you know that? And see, that's why //they're// the historians, and you and I aren't. Come inside, come inside!\n\nLike any good historical society, it is cut up into sections based on eras! So what eras do we care about? Of course, with a world -- does that require a tee emm? -- with a world so //young,// our eras don't last much more than some decades. How do we identify them? Why, by the residing Dr. Wondertainment of course! Here you can tour our encyclopedic knowledge of the Chester, Cornelius, and Holly eras! Oh, and of course, our //so very// hurtful -- ah, who am I kidding, that word is weird to me too, my apologies my chronicling compatriots! Our very //sharp// and //exacting// historians have something of a soothsaying hobby, and you can even page through their speculations! That would be the Judy and Redd eras, and Everything After.\n\nIf you follow me, I'll give you a little rundown on our history, and maybe suggest to you some reading material, hmm? There's just about as much to learn as there is room in your head, and unless you're one of //these// bookworms that goes straight from the page to studying //sand// or whatever it is they do in their off hours, I doubt you'll be able to get through it all in one lifetime. (Well, one lifetime spent //well,// but don't let our ever-so //clever// historians hear that I said that!)\n\n[[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;\"]]**Where to Start**[[/span]][[/size]]\nOf course, I see some of the more energetic of you kicking your restless legs and some of these children, why, they're //yawning!// Yes, maybe I ought to give you an //abridged// version, give you a taste. If you're so restless to get going, maybe it's all you need -- but if you're rearing to read 'til your eyes turn pink, this might give you a good sense of whether our stories are worth your time -- though I warn you, there's only //one// right answer, and if I catch even the //hint// of disrespect on the lips of anyone in this tour group, you can kiss your vacation goodbye!\n\nOh, ahem, excuse me~! I seem to have lost my good manners for a moment. My sincerest apologies! In any case, here by the front desk is our selection of establishing works -- moments in our history that should give you a good rundown of what it's all about. Let's go through them, shall we?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Establishing Shots\" hide=\"- Establishing Shots\"]]\n: [[span style=\"font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;\"]]**[[[what-a-wonderful-world|And I Think To Myself...]]]**[[/span]] //by DarkStuff// : \"Despite being an 'intermission' in a larger work (which will be discussed here shortly), this is really the best introduction to our city here, and does most of the legwork for setting the world stage.

Oho~! You wouldn't think it by looking at me, but I actually met our great Chester Williams when I was but a wee kitten -- yes, I'm a bit older than I look, and don't let me catch you discussing it! Though our founder, Chester Williams, was the first official Wondertainment, it is said the title honorarily includes the cofounder Maria Herring. The two met in the early 20th Century -- the very first Wonder Year, in fact, 1910 to the **[**Come Back**]** -- in Boston, and became fast friends and business partners, and later even romantically intertwined, me//ow//! Chester was the face of the company, and Maria put the magic in the toys.\n\nThey were turbulent times, and a Black storeowner, //especially// one with a connection to a white woman... well, you can be sure that did not go unnoticed. While the brand was still getting its bearings, we regret to admit that we got involved with some //off-color// characters -- namely, the local magic mafia, the Chicago Spirit. (You'd think they'd stick to their namesake city, but luckily for us they had a little more reach than that!) Separating from their web was a //doozy,// but as the company grew, so did its self-sufficience, in large part because of our accumulation of Wondrous individuals under our umbrella -- a process the Chicago Spirit attempted to stimy, in order to keep us dependent on their protection. Even into the modern day, there seems to be a lasting -- pardon my meat-language, but -- //beef// with the remnants of that old organization.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n[[f<image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wonder-world/chesterclover.png style=\"width: 240px;\"]]\n\n You can see our historians decorated this section of the archive with cardinal red, canary yellow, and plum purple! (We too are sad to learn that there wasn't a snappy bird-related c-word for purple.) Color is //very// important to us Wonders, so allow me to explain their meanings to the less artistically inclined of you. First it must be mentioned that the colors are Maria and Chester's colors -- in that order! Red was Maria's signature garb, quite possibly because no one in her position could resist the pun of \"Red Herring,\" while purple was Chester's! Each, however, shared a propensity for yellow, and so that was their connecting theme.\n\nRed, purple and gold are classically kingly and queenly colors, and so how better to honor our old king and queen! Not to mention, red is the color of passion, of which Maria was known for, and that passion //drove// the company's humble beginning and unprecedented success. It was also the passion shared between the refugees Wondertainment began to house -- the yellow itself representative of the warming sun, the comfort of company and basic warmth. Purple has to stand in for the magic and whimsy, Chester's arena -- not of literal magic, as was Maria's, but instead a magic of //characer,// a magic of hope and aspiration and optimism. (Optimism, yes! I knew I forgot something about the yellow -- the same yellow as those little smiley faces you see everywhere, mm~?)\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wonder-world/chester.png]]\n[[SIZE 60%]]**Chester Williams by [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/raddagher-s-toon-zone Raddagher]**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;\"]]**Chester Era Writings**[[/span]][[/size]]\n@@      @@01. **[[[The Workshop]]]** ~~ //by [[[Researcher Mathias's Colleague Protocol|RockTeethMothEyes]]] & [[[Uncle Nicolini Author Page|Uncle Nicolini]]]//\n@@      @@02. **[[[Lord Blackwood in the Land of Wonder]]]** ~~ //by [[user Raddagher]] & [[[Uncle Nicolini Author Page|Uncle Nicolini]]]//\n@@      @@03. **[[[extradimensional purchase wondertainment vacation spot|Extradimensional Purchase: \"Wondertainment Vacation Spot!\"]]]** ~~ //by [[[ellie3 gimmick free|Ellie3]]]//\n@@      @@04. **[[[Cardiac Myxoma]]]** ~~ //by [[[Dr. K.

But let's not stay here too long, it makes my hair stand on end!\n\nAhem. So~! Chester was planning on handing the title of Wondertainment to Maria when he passed, but Maria -- despite her nigh-magical vitality -- succumbed to a fate never released to the public. Needless to say, it was tragic -- and it must have been doubly so, to have remained private between herself and Chester, but the public simply knows that it took only a few months for Maria's health to dwindle and then for her to finally pass. Chester followed her shortly thereafter, perhaps of heartbreak, it's hard to say. In his will, he left the title to an up-and-coming Publicity Puppy -- and I should say, he //earns// the title of a dog -- someone known for their knack in advertising and business relations. His name was Cornelius Młynarczyk, and he became our second ever Wondertainment.\n\nAmong other things, he was the creative mind behind our local musical superstars, the Little Misters, so perhaps that should tell you //something// about where his head was at. Of course, at the time, people didn't really know any better, and their predicament was a celebrated success, all the while they suffered behind the scenes. Still today, Wondertainment has a strict no-sentience policy for toys! And, of course, the Little Misters are, legally, no longer toys themselves. \n\nCornelius' time as Wondertainment was thankfully brief, though he's generally regarded as Chester's last mistake -- surely, our great Dr. Wondertainment the First had perception for seeing the good and Wondrous in people, and it was the heartbreak and his failing health that hid Cornelius' nature from his sight. After Cornelius' passing in the 89th Wonder Year, even more ludicrous things were discovered about his time as Dr. Wondertainment, including some... well, maybe I shouldn't give you such a negative impression of our company so soon~!\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n[[f<image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wonder-world/corneliusclover.png style=\"width: 240px;\"]]\n\nThe historians colored this section a //fitting// ash gray, sickly green and //noxious// purple. Well okay, the purple is more dark than noxious, but it's a corruption of the original purple is what I am saying! Undoubtedly, the gray represents the atmosphere that hung in the air of Wonder World! Tee emm, during this period of time. Things seemed blotted, the way clouded. The green alternatively speaks both to the sick feeling in everyone's stomachs, and that which drove Cornelius most: //money.// Well okay sure, our dollars are pink, but that hardly matters -- well okay yes, most people didn't //literally// know the horrid things happening in Wonder Tower during the Cornelius era until well afterwards, but surely everyone knew //something!// Bits and pieces, however, shrouded in mystery -- yes, purple, the color of twilight, dim lighting, and thus the unknown. No one knew quite enough to be //afraid,// no, just felt dim awareness that something was wrong, and so that's why these colors are so dim, dim, dim. Dim in the loss of our lights, Maria and Chester, and the replacement of their warm candles with Cornelius' cold and efficient fluorescence.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wonder-world/cornelius.png style=\"width: 540px;\"]]\n[[SIZE 60%]]**Dr. Cornelius M.

Holly's made a quick solution, she's instated that successors are no longer singularly appointed by the previous Wondertainment, but instead elected by the Board of Directors. I'll say, I acknowledge its use, but I've always been partial to //whims// -- the whole codification makes the new election just so much less //dramatic,// so it looks like our history might forever carry a bit more gravitas than our present.\n\nIs it the natural trajectory for excitement to abate, for fervor to falter?

Put on your speculacles -- that's speculating spectacles, was that clear? You're the first group I've tried that on -- oh anyways, put them on and walk through this door, and we'll catch a glimpse of what might come to be! And oh, woe is me, it seems the historians have confirmed my worst suspicions -- yes, yes, the future of Wonder World! Tee emm, might as well lose the exclamation point in its name!\n\nIt's projected that in some decades, Holly might lose the light within her, and instead of waiting until her passing for the position to change heads, Holly will step down. The Board of Directors will then appoint her successor, Judy the Tongue -- the first non-Publicity Puppy to hold the title, if you don't count Chester -- but, although he precedes the department, wasn't he a Puppy by virtue of being the face? Chester, the first Publicity Puppy, Maria, the first Toy Tinker? That's my perspective, anyhow. But Judy is a Candy Catalyst, a member of our Sweets Department! Isn't that novel? It's she who will have the practical approach of Cornelius' bookishness, but with the humanitarian edge of Holly's motherly rule, and we will discover that the combination of these aspects will open a window into a future we may not have wished to ever see.\n\nIs it better to peter out with hope and naivety? How precious our innocence that we will lose! Is it worth it? To live lives of mundanity, instead of suffering only some years at our ends when we have to face what we've put off facing all the rest of the while? Why, I think //I'd// rather be ignorant. Damn my tour-guiding job, enlightening me to the contents of this archive! But, ah, I've put it off long enough.\n\nWonder World! Tee emm, is a city of refugees. Refugees from what, exactly? Well, from the Veil and the ever-hungry, ever-hunting organizations that support it. From the eyes of greedy governments who want our special powers for themselves, from those who want to keep us out of the public eye. Well, we may have escaped their hair-pulling, but they -- let's name them, shall we? The SCP Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, //they// have hindered our ability to do business forever, and it is Judy who will realize that our stated goal, to reach as many children as possible, to enrich the lives of the many, is better attained by... oh, it's nearly too horrible to say. Why don't you just read some, will you? My voice will fail me should I say it out loud. Let me tell you, I'm glad to be an old cat -- maybe I can spend my nine lives before the worst should come to pass, eh?\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[f<image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/wonder-world/judyclover.png style=\"width: 240px;\"]]\n\nIs it just me, or do these colors look a little faded, a little desaturated? It was foreshadowed in Holly's sky blue, wasn't it? Well, these colors are a fuchsia, minty green, and stark white. I should hardly need to tell you why a //minty// green was used, given the origins of this era's head honcho! That said, the green is in reference to growth as well. But look at me, going out of order! The //first// color is fuchsia -- a hot pink, the color of //love,// the love that Judy undoubtedly feels for her predecessor and partner Holly, as well as the love she has for Wonder World! Tee emm, and all of its inhabitants. It is because of this love, the most vibrant of the three colors, that we see her push for growth, for the expansion of Wondertainment's faculties... which then leads to the bleak white color of bone, the final and least saturated of the colors, as the means to attain this end are discovered to drain Wondertainment of its colors.\n\nWell, indeed, white is also the color of the oppressor, of the Foundation, isn't it? Just like Cornelius' gray was also the color of the Factory, our horrible, brief collaborator. At the very least, Judy leads with love -- whereas Cornelius' //first// color was ash -- but don't they both have green at their core? Growth -- money? The similarity is uncomfortable, and in those Judy era days, things may seem to improve by one hand and degrade by another.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/uncle-nicolini-author-page/sailorenochtrans.png]]\n= [[SIZE 60%]]**Faeowynn Wilson and Dr. Jay Everwood by [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:faust-s-art-page EmperorFaust]** [[/size]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;\"]]**Judy Era Writings**[[/span]][[/size]]\n@@      @@01. **[[[SCP-445-EX|The Word of the Day is Hope]]]** ~~ //by [[[Dr. K.

They believe Redd Wondertainment will truly set her sights on using the company and Wonder World! Tee emm as a whole as a base for her militaristic operations against the Foundation, and she will be aiming to destroy the company after its resources have been used up for her own personal gain.

Ah well, that's where I agree with the historians the //least!// This green, I might call it a pear green, is supposed to represent a kind of //renewal.// Like grasses rise in the aftermath of a wildfire, below the charred remains of the conventions that are will grow a bed of new life, fertilized by that which left it.

So be it, this section would be //rather// difficult to write in obfuscated terms! If you've gotten this far, you probably have a good idea of how you might write for this setting already, but let us take this moment to make some things very clear.\n\nPerhaps the central theme of What a Wonderful World is this, introduced as early as Vend-a-Friend: that there is no other time to be happy. That if you are searching for beauty, you must be prepared to find it now. That if you hope to experience joy, you must be prepared to experience joy now. That there is reason to live, from the tall to the small. It asks that you look upon bleak prospects and smile. It asks that you experience loss and find worth in what you still have. It asks that you find meaning in suffering. It is about life in the apocalypse, it is about surviving the worst of everything.\n\nIn somewhat less spiritually-toned words, this canon is mostly about character-driven works, and slower, more ponderous storytelling. It is asking, in an overtly magical, whimsical world, what motivates people. It is a canon largely about building community and building connections, altruistic motives (and those motives nearby), and surviving suffering. It is about the coexistence of atrocities with genuine joy. It is a canon of whiplash: it is about characters that exist in horrible circumstances finding peace, and it is about characters living lives of comfort finding dismay. Ideologically, it is opposed to apathy, it promotes ecstasy as revolution. It is openly political, and discusses industrialization, climate change, authoritarian government, bigotry and more.\n\nTo write in What a Wonderful World, I think a good exercise would be to first think about what motivates you, what makes you happy, what you are looking for, and write about that.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nHowever, there is more lore to this canon than that, and while the majority of works are character-driven, there is a larger plot. If you want to write plot-heavy works, I commend you! Your best resource is simply to read what is written. If you're so gung-ho as to be thinking of writing for the Wondermaker Era or the Redd Era -- or Everything After -- then I recommend you read this [[[a-wonderful-world-contingency|essay]]], written by me. There is a lot of planned plot and lore in this canon that has yet to make it to the site, and this essay goes over that. Be warned though: it is not very approachable. To read this and then write based on it is absolutely going above-and-beyond, but very much recommended for writing in the aforementioned eras, which are the most plot-heavy in the canon.\n\nShould you venture there, good luck, and absolutely feel free to reach out to myself ([[*user DarkStuff]]) or [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] for clarifications on the canon. \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Berkshire Swash', cursive;\"]]**Honorable Mentions**[[/span]][[/size]]\nThere are articles here that aren't perfectly canon, but that make mention of canon conventions or otherwise reference What a Wonderful World directly.
