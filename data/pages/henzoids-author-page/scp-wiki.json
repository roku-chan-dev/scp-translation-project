Two instances of SCP-4064 are currently in Foundation custody, though one is much more compliant than the other. Aside from self-preservation, SCP-4064's primary goal is to use emotional manipulation to make people fall in love with them, and then break their hearts, sending them into a long period of romantic despair.\n[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]\n[[[SCP-4098]]] - S-C-P, Easy As 19-3-16!\n* SCP-4098 is a format screw that I can't be bothered to follow the effects of here because that would be stupid. Also because I couldn't properly credit [[*user Westrin]] as my Co-Author. The basic premise of SCP-4098 is that it is a conceptual anomaly that causes any information written about it to be confined to the letters \"S, C, and P,\" in that order. The anomaly itself is a thaumiel class, containing another, more dangerous cognitohazard within its conceptual prison.\n[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]] \n[[[SCP-4252]]] - Beans and Betrayal\n* SCP-4252 is a wacky article about four objects that produce infinite baked beans constantly. The only way to consistently remove the beans is to utter a poem once a month to summon Lord Jethusent, the zany Bean King/Leprechaun who will stop at nothing to eat his glorious beans. Also, TheVolgun did a reading of it, so go check it out: [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fuOxzKB1hE Beans and Betrayal].\n[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]] \n[[[SCP-4352]]] - Storytime\n* SCP-4352 is an SCP about the Big Bad Wolf. Yep, literally the Big Bad Wolf. It presents an entity that is \"anti-infohazardous\" in that, those who __don't__ know about it are at risk of being affected by it, which is why the Foundation, and an earlier version of the Foundation involving the Grimm Brothers, try to spread stories about the Big Bad Wolf so people can't be affected by it.

We had a ton of fun writing this, mostly because of how gimmicky and format-screwy it is. The piece is basically a documentation about a researcher, and while it's clear something strange is going on, the header makes it clear that what is going on can't be stated. However, it's not antimemetic. Is Dr. Michaels truly in danger?

At least, on the surface. In fact, this collab between me and [[*user MaliceAforethought]] is about an antimemetic child who carries his normal teddy bear with him. However, he can't be perceived by humans, and ends up dying of dehydration when they lock the test chamber indefinitely after not knowing what to do about the bear, when DoMC testing goes nowhere.\n[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]\n[[[scp-5558|𝒫]]] - 𝒫 and the Little Party\n* 𝒫 is a character largely inspired by me and my self-image insecurities, and while the contents of the article are really important to me personally, I think and hope the broadness allows it to speak to people without having to pinpoint exactly what it speaks to as a whole. It's got a lot of threads in it, and though none of them are necessarily the \"right answer\", they're certainly not wrong.\n[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]\n[[[SCP-5855]]] - Foot by the Fruit\n* A while ago I wrote the beginning of a draft about fruit with human body-parts that appeared to artists who were struggling to find motivation. I made images that I thought were awesome, but couldn't figure out where to take the story. As part of the SCPD January 2021 Draftswap, I handed off the draft to [[*user AnActualCrow]] who took the ending in a completely different but WAY BETTER direction than I would have thought to do.

From that stemmed this: A classroom video written in Broken Masquerade to preserve the public image of the Foundation so the youth of the era don't grow up thinking they're a terrible organization. If the video goes as would be expected, however, the kids will instead think the Foundation is a bunch of dumbass old people who have no idea what they like.

Though I started reading the SCP wiki in 2012, I didn't start writing or even make an account until early February, 2019. My first scp Idea, which I quickly learned was not up to par, was a floating ball of light that caused stress to whoever it was following. The idea had emotional and comedic presence, but I eventually scrapped it to work on what is now my first successful scp: SCP-4252, \"Beans and Betrayal. I had been lucky enough to crit [[*user Weryllium]]'s donut scp, [[[SCP-4759]]], and was heavily inspired by his combination of absurd, food humor and fantastical characters. From there, i found inspiration in the popular image of a clock with baked beans in it, and originally, I even used it as the SCP-4252-A1 image, but soon found out it wasn't copyright compliant. Taking matters into my own hands, I did the only thing a rational human would do in that situation: I bought the cheapest clock I could find on amazon, dismantled it, filled it with beans, put it back together, and posed it all over my house, taking pictures and cleaning up bean spillage. Eventually, I had finished SCP-4252, and was overwhelmed by how quickly it took off. It's not nearly my most popular or upvoted scp, but it will always hold a special place as my first venture into the scp universe.[[footnote]] Oh also if I'm inactive for a year and nobody knows why, collab authors get access to those, and the rest of the articles go to [[*user Westrin]].

It is through this clever little disguise I've built that I can continue to steal your knowledge and hopefully make my way into the highest seat of authority in your foundation.
