[[/span]]\n**“Free Retry” Powerup:** After hitting this disc, at any time after their shot, the player may shout “Activate Retry![[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]People always point this out as some sort of pothole. \"how could they have discovered you need to say 'activate retry'?\" Oh, I don't know, maybe they were given some sort of explanation on what the powerups did?! What, are you not told a single thing when you go to play minigolf? Do you just grad a club and ball that's lying on the ground and start hitting it!? Of course they would be able to learn the rules from somewhere!!!
