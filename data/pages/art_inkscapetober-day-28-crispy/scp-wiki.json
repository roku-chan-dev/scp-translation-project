It would be an easy mistake, however, to fill the entire coat of arms with hams. This is because of the motto, which is a Doctor Fullham quote. So instead I included a single fine ham. The background of the coat of arms are keys. One can ask Doctor Fullham in SkipIRC to show his list of keys, and then this will become clear. The supporters are boars, to further strengthen the theme of hams.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** It was only until it was too late that I realised that hams aren't actually crispy per se. They can be, if you honey glaze them or something. So let's assume that is what happened here.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-27-spark| Day 27: Spark]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-29-patch| Day 29: Patch]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** DrFullham.png\n> **Name:** DrFullham\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nDrFullham.png is a composite.
