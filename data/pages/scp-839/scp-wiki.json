The chamber is to be supplied with approximately half (1/2) of a kilogram of various plant matter daily. Mating of SCP-839 is to be regulated, and any extra instances of SCP-839 are to be kept in Foundation medical centers for treatment of ill individuals.\n\n**Description:** SCP-839 appears to be a species of annelid composed of sugar, flavouring and colouring. A microscopic label stating \"CANDIED WORM\" is found near each instance's posterior, followed by a smaller label stating the instance's \"flavour\". Each \"flavour\" is currently designated as SCP-839-x.\n\nSCP-839 is generally found in temperate areas. SCP-839's diet mainly consists of decomposing organic matter, however when there is no decaying matter apparent SCP-839 may ingest live plant matter. SCP-839 sexually reproduces. Mating [REDACTED], followed by the egg hatching into a newborn instance of SCP-839.\n\nWhen SCP-839 is ingested by any mammal, it will burrow through the stomach lining and towards a specialized organ. The choice of organ appears to be dependent on SCP-839's \"flavour\". SCP-839 will then attach itself to the organ and slowly ingest it. While the organ disappears, SCP-839 will change in form and chemical composition in order to match the organ. SCP-839 does not act as a perfect replacement, and other effects may occur. This process may take █ to ██ days to complete.[[footnote]]Similarities between the life cycles of SCP-839 and [[[SCP-1517]]] has been noted. Investigation into the possibility of a shared origin is under investigation.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-839 has an average lifespan of three years. Users of SCP-839 are recommended to replace their integrated instance with a new instance every two years.\n\n**Addendum 839-1:** Current \"flavours\" of SCP-839\n\n||~ \"Flavour\" ||~ Colouration ||~ Organ Replaced ||~ Other Effects  ||~ Designation ||\n|| Cherry || Red || Heart || Increased blood sugar, Type-2 Diabetes || SCP-839-1 ||\n|| Blue Raspberry || Blue || Kidney (One) || Blue urine || SCP-839-2 ||\n|| Green Apple || Green || Eye (One) || Mild hallucinations, \"greenish\" tint || SCP-839-3 ||\n|| Watermelon || Pink || Brain || [DATA EXPUNGED] || SCP-839-4 ||\n|| Lemon || Yellow || Stomach || Less Fibre content, diarrhea (Note: recommended for use with other instances of SCP-839, due to the ulcers created) || SCP-839-5 ||\n|| Grape || Purple || Lung (one) || \"Fruity\" smell to breath || SCP-839-6 ||\n|| Orange || Orange || Liver || Increased acidity of bloodstream (Not recommended)  || SCP-839-7 ||\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-838]]] | SCP-839 | [[[SCP-840]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP-312.png\n> **Author:** Brian Gratwicke (edits by [[*user S D Locke]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/briangratwicke/33338251316\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
