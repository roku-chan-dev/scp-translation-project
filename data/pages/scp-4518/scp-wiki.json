Civilians attempting to enter SCP-4518 are to be detained, amnesticized, and released.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4518 is an anomalous structure located at the end of the Old Halloway Boardwalk in San Francisco, California. \n\nSCP-4518 consists of a narrow tunnel passageway containing 207 posters for missing children -- primarily between the ages of 6-12 -- who disappeared from January 1st, 1975 to December 31st, 1999. Individuals who traverse SCP-4518 have reported inexplicable feelings of dread, somberness, or a sensation likened to \"falling off the edge of the world\".\n\nSCP-4518-1 is a Class-I spectral entity[[footnote]] Colloquially known as a ghost. [[/footnote]] residing at the end of SCP-4518, resembling a young child of indeterminate age, sex, or ethnicity. SCP-4518 displays symptoms of advanced depersonalization, often providing vague, unusual, or mystifying responses to attempts at interview. SCP-4518-1 is otherwise unremarkable.\n\n**Addendum:** Interview attempt\n\nAfter reviewing this document's supplementary materials during an unrelated research project, Dr. Elizabeth Espinoza -- then serving as Deputy Director of the Department of Spectral Affairs -- requested to speak with SCP-4518-1. Due to Dr. Espinoza's position within the DoSA, this request was granted. The following encounter was recorded shortly thereafter, and has been transcribed verbatim.\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Espinoza:** Hello.\n> @@ @@\n> //SCP-4518-1 turns to Dr. Espinoza.//\n> @@ @@\n> **SCP-4518-1:** You...\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Espinoza:** //(Laughter)// Well, that was fast.\n> @@ @@\n> **SCP-4518-1:** I don't understand.\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Espinoza:** I saw his face on one of the posters.
