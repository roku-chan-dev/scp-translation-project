Gray static in your field of vision.\n\nYou are unable to do anything as every member of the Department of Unreality is torn to shreds.\n\nAs the gray blotches approach, you feel tears streaming down your face.\n\nAs the tears reach your lips, you taste blood. Your eyelids are gone.\n\nYour eyes lose focus. You lay in a pile of rubble, unscathed.\n\nThrough the blurry landscape, you can see outside the site; as well as the walls in between.\n\nEveryone you've ever known is around you.\n\nAs your eyes glaze over, you start noticing the scowls. Faces you only recognize by association, screaming at you with righteous fury in their eyes.\n\nYou pass out.\n\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n\nYou do not remember waking up. Your senses betray you. The grass is flat, where moments ago concrete stood. As you lean on a wall to stand up, you realize there has never been a wall standing near you. You look up to find the floor of the site, 5 meters off the ground.\n\nYou have never felt better, which makes you nauseous.\n\nGone are the usual paranoias, the pervasive sense of dread that comes with your job. Your head is clear, and you manage to remember your own name. Your own newfound clarity alerts you that this can only mean one thing:\n\nReality has been bent out of shape.\n\nThe world is dead.\n\n@@@@\n----\n@@@@\n\nYou don't move, and little by little you stop thinking. The screaming comes and goes, and with it your vision fades in and out. Instead of finding someone, you are found. You feel the air crackle. Slowly, the hum of a reality anchor guides you back into the vessel.\n\nThe Foundation, wounded as it is, has survived.\n\n@@@@\n----\n@@@@\n\nThe interior of a containment cell is a familiar sight. the familiarity makes you forget the constant hum of machinery that works to keep the walls tangible.\n\nWithin a week of being at the Foundation, you remembered language, and words felt real again. Fragments of dialogue, of agitated screams and hushes, of auditory cognitohazards, of protocols, all work to make you feel at home. You don't mind the way the guards stare at you, or the way they whisper to themselves //where are their eyes// when they think you're not listening.\n\nYour defenses started receding. It was difficult, but pebble by pebble, the shell cracked. You were free again. You could see people. The screaming was gone. \n\nYour eyes refocus.\n\nYou are standing in a sealed containment unit. There are no windows, and a single door.\n\nUpon it, you see a nameplate, and tear up a little.\n\nYour name.\n\nYour office.\n\nYour home.\n\n//Safety.//\n\nAnd in that moment of weakness, everything goes black.\n\n@@@@\n----\n@@@@\n\nYou are floating, untethered.\n\nThrough the newly formed window in your office, you can see Earth.\n\nYou float in silence.\n\n@@@@\n----\n@@@@\n\nYou're unsure of how much time has passed since. You're still here. At one point, you were given a final assignment. A final reminder that they're not alone. Your office is now a small outpost, stable enough to allow for basic shelter. The reality anchor, however, allows for something much more valuable.\n\nYou turn on a video feed of Earth, and then set up the anchor.\n\nYou are mesmerized by the view.\n\nEarth, shielded from harm. The sky is gone, but reality has been put back together.\n\nWithin the sphere, light. Cities, less than before, but entire //cities// are there.\n\nA sight to behold.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe anchor powers up, and you're truly unbound as the backlash fixes reality around you.\n\nYou gave up eating when your mouth went away.\n\nStopped feeling when your body faded out of this plane.\n\nAnd now, as reality finally fixes //you//, you see things so clearly.\n\nReality.\n\nIts inverse.\n\nThe sliver of static stuck between realms, welcome in neither.\n\nYou see humanity, and humanity looks back at you.\n\nYou give up your name, and your self.\n\nWhere you failed to stop it, you hope the next wanderer figures the cycle out.\n\nAs reality reaches its baseline, you stop thinking.\n\nHumanity marches on.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
