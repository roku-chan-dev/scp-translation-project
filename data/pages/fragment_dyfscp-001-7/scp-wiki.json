Looks like this one defaulted to autopilot after extended inactivity.\n> \n> **Tamino:** Do not let it happen during the modified summoning ritual. That phase has to be 100% perfect, remember? We can't allow the entity even the slightest chance to start the \"eternal hunt\" phase.\n> \n> **Matapang:** The kill vehicle would work regardless.\n> \n> **Tamino:** A two-second-long ΩK/A-class scenario would still be an international incident.\n> \n> **Matapang:** Fair enough.\n> \n> **Tamino:** Also, what's keeping our executor --\n> \n> //(Small explosion nearby.)//\n> \n> **Tamino:** JALAKÅRA be praised.\n> \n> **Matapang:** I hope it's a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2578 Limulid].

View shifts to the interior.)//\n> \n> **SCP-4922-██:** Could you grab me the kill vehicle, Ms. Matapang?

Upon his arrival to Corbenic and subsequent retrieval by ☽☽☽ Screening Agents, Mr. Gualtieri informed us that your iteration of Earth was due for a bit of trouble with a certain creature that's familiar to our world.\n> \n> \"SCP-UBU\" is - rather, was - a pantagruel (//Gargantuanovichensis ferox//), a common nuisance in the canyons south of Outer Saklovai. Though I wouldn't doubt its destructive potential in a world free of its natural enemies, this specimen in particular was unusually small and weak for its species. No doubt it was the runt of its litter.\n> \n> It's not unheard of for a pantagruel to access one of many \"jump points\" in the forbidden prefectures to cause mischief in other dimensions. And it's likely that this one had secured Second Prince NÅZHDAK's favor in one way or another in order to anoint its living presence with both the Rite of World-Sealing and the Eternal Hunt. (NÅZHDAK has a bit of an unsettling fixation with these silly creatures.)\n> \n> But should this happen again with a separate pantagruel, remember this...\n> \n> The indigenous tribes of Outer Saklovai hate pantagruels for obvious reasons. A common rite of passage for boys who reach the age of 13 is to leave the village, not to return until they've bagged a pantagruel.\n> \n> This is how they pull it off, this is how //we// pulled it off - and, moving forward, this is how //you// should pull it off:\n> \n> # Grab a length of wood and sharpen it to a point.\n> # Carve the word \"CLEANSING\" in any language into it for a minimum of 200 times. (There is no maximum, but let's be honest, doing it more than 200 times isn't going to make the pantagruel any deader.)\n> # Anywhere that there's a free space for carving left on the stick, engrave the following phrase just as it's written here: \"NAI FADUZH JALAKÅRA.\"[[footnote]] Translation from Upper Arcane: \"(Thou art) salt (in the) presence (of) JALAKÅRA.\" [[/footnote]]\n> # Stab it anywhere into the pantagruel's body.\n> \n> And there you have it!\n> \n> As for Mr. Gualtieri, don't worry about him. He has been amply rewarded and offered a position on the Foundation Continuance Program on Luna Major. I would suggest naming something after him on your end - you owe him dearly.\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ You are watched. You are protected.
