The SCP Foundation's presence Africa is stretched thin, reduced to only a handful of clandestine Sites separated like islands in a vast ocean. A small yet formidable Chaos Insurgency, having deepened its roots in the continent for decades, has decided to take advantage of the Foundation's waning presence. Insurgent cells across the continent propagate violent wars fueled by anti-imperialist sentiment, all while stealing anomalous artifacts from the Foundation to further their mysterious goals.\n\nThe Insurgency has found one unlikely ally in Southern Africa: The Republic of Rhodesia, an isolated pariah state locked in conflict with the Chinese and Soviet-backed ZANU and ZIPRA insurgents. Rhodesia also faces an unlikely anomalous threat; an anomalous micro-nation known as Great Zimbabwe has resurfaced, and is constructing a superweapon capable wiping Rhodesia from existence. The alliance between the Rhodesians and the Insurgency is shaky, but Hudson's Scouts, the Insurgency's primary military cell within the country, is prepared to do whatever it takes to defeat Rhodesia's anomalous enemy.\n\nEveryone's views on Rhodesia are mixed—the Insurgency itself is split on ideological lines on whether it should preserve the Veil or actively remove it, let alone if they should undermine the very nation they call a safe haven. Cells frequently work independent of one another, or even against each other. So when the Scouts are caught off guard in a sudden ambush and their commander goes AWOL, everything is flipped upside down.\n\nFor one fledgling Insurgent, it means questioning everything he has learned from his mentor and every belief he has made, and trusting no one.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ EPISODES\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[=image hod1banner.png link=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hod1-homecoming\"]]\n\n> \"I'm offering you a shot at redemption, Jai.
