All requests for neutralization from SCP-8034-1 are to be denied.\n[[div]]\nSCP-8034 has been allowed one wall-mounted speaker that continuously plays a praying mantis hiss as a comfort item. \n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=optional-colors\n|unique-name=unique-name-2\n|display-name=SCP Description\n]]\n= SCP-8034 refers to a 1983 Mitsubishi Chariot compact minivan.\nSCP-8034 is operated by an artificial general intelligence bot (SCP-8034-1) that communicates through an 180 mm x 100mm CRT computer monitor. The monitor is housed in the double-DIN radio slot of the anomaly’s dashboard. The lower half of a Motorola Razr mobile flip phone has been mounted directly adjacent to the monitor and functions as a keyboard for users to interact with SCP-8034-1. SCP-8034-1 will only communicate through text displayed on the monitor.\n\nWhen the occupant's death will occur within the week SCP-8034 will teleport from its default resting location. It is believed this location is an extra-temporal Dave & Buster's. SCP-8034 will appear approximately 3 - 5 miles from an individual and begin to immediately drive towards them. A trigger to the anomaly appearing before an individual, other than its approaching death, has not been concretely determined. However, most reports have suggested that someone requested transport through a rideshare application.\n\nOnce the individual enters the minivan, SCP-8034-1 will offer to instantly kill the individual. The occupant is then prompted to tap the “Answer” button for yes or the \"Hang-up\" button for no on the attached Razr keyboard.\n\n[[div]]\n* If the individual taps the answer button they will immediately disappear from known, baseline reality.\n\n* If the individual does not agree it is teleported outside the vehicle and back to its original location prior to the interaction. Following its return, the individual has not been known to survive longer than a week.\n\n\nThe glove compartment of SCP-8034 contains organic tissue and bone anatomically similar in size and shape to human mouth-parts. Upon investigation (SEE AD-3), researchers no longer believe it to be associated with SCP-8034-1. Research into the purpose of this tissue and its reason for existing is still ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[html]]\n<h1>\n<font color=\"white\"> AD-1 | INTERVIEW LOG #1 </font>\n</h1>\n[[/html]]\n------\n[[div]]\n> //The following is a transcription of an interview between Researcher Nyquist and SCP-8034-1 within its containment chamber at Site-322.
