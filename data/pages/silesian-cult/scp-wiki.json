The case begins in Bielsko-Biała, Poland, around the summer of 1990 (exact dates remain unclear, I'll get to that). A man known as \"Andrej Mielkowski\"  began his activities as a leader of a small group of spiritualists and bioenergy therapists who called themselves the \"Center for the Refreshment of Earth\".  \n\nCRE for short, they started travelling all over southern Poland,  (especially in the Silesia region). Mielkwoski and his inner ring gave lectures at multiple occult/pseudoacademic/esoteric/scifi conferences regarding parapsychology, alternative medicine and the like. The content and the exact dates of these lectures are, unfortunately, lost to time. I was only able to find a couple of newspaper fragments, that mentioned the group. Apparently, CRE put a special focus on angels and \"Inner Light\". It was mostly what you would expect when it comes to these kinds of people, their rhetoric matching the post-communist New Age hype that was happening in Poland at the time.  The group was only notable among the spiritualist community at the time, until around November 1990, where they took a left turn. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##yellow|**Aldon_PL**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:27:55 #17347467\n------\nOh damn, didn't think I'd find Poland mentioned on Parawatch today, lol.\n\nAnyways, go on\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:28:31 #45515856\n------\n\nWhat exactly happened is, thankfully, one of the few events which we do have a concrete and detailed description of. Straight from Mielkowski himself, in fact. Copy-and-pasting it would make me go over the character limit, so instead, I'll do my best to summarize it.\n\nDuring a meeting at a resort in the Sudeten mountains, the group noticed a pink, strobe light outside their room's window. They uniformly claimed to have left the building to investigate, leading them to witness a large, \"star-shaped\" silver structure, described by all present to be a star ship. The group alleged that said star ship remained in the sky for circa 300 minutes, during which the entities piloting it shared their history, spiritual insights and doomsday prophecies with the group through telepathy.  Neither staff nor other guests reported seeing anything like what they had described, though a janitor claimed she had seen them all exit their room in a rush.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:35:21 #45515856\n------\n\nOne would imagine that after such a \"revelation\" and the creation of a new dogma, the group would face a period of reconsolidation and internal struggles. Instead, all members began touring across Poland shortly after, giving more lectures than ever before, though the content of the lectures remained mostly the same. The CRE also changed its name to the Center for the Rebirth of Earth and became a much less exclusive group. From the spring of 1991 onwards, they had begun to recruit members of the general public and invited selected members of the audience to their more private (and expensive) lectures, at which more of the cult's actual beliefs were introduced. They were allegedly attended by multiple well-known celebrities and politicians, with a total of 35 different public figures being accused of membership at CRE in the years after the group fell. \n\nLater the same year, the cult would also publish a set of books, booklets and flyers containing details of their dogma. None of these are unfortunately available online, though some of their contents were described by secondary sources. The books included \"Koniec Świata i Początek Człowieka\", \"Sygnały z Gwiazd\" and most famously, \"Ewolucja i Jej Rola w Wszechświecie\".\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:36:55 #45515856\n------\n\nThe cult believed that aliens, called \"Etoil\", were the source of all life on Earth. The members believed that through uniting their souls with Etoil, both their minds and physical bodies could travel to a paradise planet called \"Mirinda\",  somewhere in the Alpha Centauri constellation. Of note is that almost all members reported to actually have had encounters with said aliens, be it during CRE's meetings, or on their own. They always described these aliens as amorphous,  vaguely humanoid beings of pure, pink light. The group also believed that in the year 1995, on the 5th of May, a second spaceship will land on Earth, to save all humans who have discovered their inner lights and purge the world of all other lifeforms, so that the survivors could build their own utopia.\n\nOf note is that the group claimed that the spaceship would be powered by different body parts, with fingers being the best source of fuel.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:38:42 #45515856\n------\n\nSoon after the group claimed to have seen the alien for the first time, a member by the name of Adam Malkowicz disappeared without a trace, being last seen entering Mielkowski's home. Mielkowski claimed that Malkowicz left in his car, though neither a car,  nor Malkowicz's body were ever found. The next disappearance connected to the group made waves outside the esoteric world.\n\nA few months later, a member by the name of Henryk Jadamak  went missing on his return home from a lecture of the group. Just like Malkowicz, he was one of the founders and the only critic of Malkowicz among the group, often starting long debates about the nature of alien entities and the date of the incoming apocalypse. His car was found by the Gdansk Bridge in Warsaw the next day, while he turned up a month later in an abandoned farm, 50 kilometers north, all of his fingers missing. His body showed no other signs of damage. The autopsy report stated that he had died earlier that day.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:42:15 #45515856\n------\n\nThat was the first, and the last, time a body connected to the cult showed up. It wasn't the last vanishing, however. Across 1993 and 1994, a total of 15 members of the group went missing, with any investigations shortly turning cold. Around the same time, the group became closed to new members, ceaseing their lectures and publishing. Multiple members were exiled without an explanation.\n\nMielkowski, alongside his most loyal followers, jumped from hotel to hotel, travelling across the Silesia region in search of \"places of spiritual importance\", in which the group claimed the alien ship was about to land one year from now. Wherever they stayed, the staff reported weird flashes of light in the night, as well as stones arranged into \"Soviet stars\" outside of the buildings. By the year 1995, the cult had fully embraced their nomadic lifestyle. Not even a mail address was maintained anymore, and the remaining members sold their houses. But the worst was yet to come.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##pink|**Lambada021**## 07/3/2019 (Wed) 18:49:13 #45515856\n------\n\nOn May 5th of 1995, the cult finally approached their doomsday date. As I previously stated, finding any information about this was extremely difficult, but there are even less records of what happened on that day. From what I could gather from eyewitnesses, the cult spent \"the last night on earth\" near an inactive ski resort. Early in the morning of that day, all members stormed out of the building and went into the  forest. For the rest of the day, residents of the nearby village of Gwiazdowice claimed to have heard and sounds of wood breaking, as well as chanting, occasional screams, and laughter. While a person claimed that the police was called, another claimed to see no authorities present in the area that day.\n\nIn the morning of May 6th, the residents found  not a single piece of trash, clothes or even the aforementioned broken wood nor trace of Mielkowski and his supporters. All in all, more than 20 people had gone, all being CRE's most devoted members.\n\nThe police launched an investigation shortly afterwards, but the case went nowhere and was closed soon enough. The incident is now accepted by the police and the rest of the normies to be a case of ritual suicide, though despite its scale and lack of precedents in Poland, it remains obscure to almost all but the community near which it happened.\n\nThe people of Gwiazdowice are, unfortunately, rather unwilling to discuss the event. Some, however, have claimed witnessing strange events around the community ever since. The details of those are, as you guessed it, scarce and mostly inconsistent. One thing has stood out for me, however.\n\nAll residents who talked  have reported seeing large groups of glowing, pink figures staring into the sky inside the forest where the abductions had taken place. None have reported feeling threatened by them.\n\n[[/div]]",
