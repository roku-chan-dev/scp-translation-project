Any civilians attempting to enter SCP-5634 will be pressured away from SCP-5634’s perimeter by force under the guise of border security. Any SCP-5634 residents found outside of the nations borders will be forcefully returned to their respective homes in SCP-5634.\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5634 was a self declared nationstate comprised of the townships of St. Joseph, Felson, and Neche in Pembina County, North Dakota, USA. SCP-5634 existed for a period of 37 years (1893-1930) under the name “The Agrarian Union of Neche”, in which time it was able to create its own currency, military, and government. Residents of SCP-5634 henceforth referred to as SCP-5634-2, gradually became anomalous in nature during the period in which SCP-5634 existed, assumedly due to breeding with the anomalous (assumed to be) native inhabitants of SCP-5634. Anomalous effects vary widely but consist mainly of physical mutations, which include an unexplainable level of strength, speed, and polymelia (primarily in the legs and arms). Many of these effects harm those effected in some way, causing average anomalous inhabitants of SCP-5634 to live for an average of roughly 40 years (according to documents written by SCP-5634’s physician Douglas Olson, see //Addendum-5634-I//).\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; background:#111111; padding-left: 1rem; padding-right: 1rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; margin-top: 1rem;\"]]\n\nThe following documents were recovered from SCP-5634.
