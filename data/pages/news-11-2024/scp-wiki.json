Amazing right? The art exchange is a great chance for authors and artists of all different mediums to share their creativity while graciously giving to fellow members of the community!\n\nArt Exchange is essentially a secret santa for the SCP Wiki. Participants will post a list of things they can gift to others and any gifts they will want to receive. The organizers will then pair participants with each other, and everyone will secretly make a gift for their recipient!\n\nKeep your eyes peeled for sign ups starting on the 10th-15th of November! But be aware, AE is doing things a little differently this year. This year, the organizers are adding the Naughty list. What does this mean? This means if you ghost the exchange, you'll be unable to enter next year's exchange. Please remember that if you can't complete your piece to send a PM to the exchange runners before hand!\n\nIf you'd like to check out the history of the art exchange, check out the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art-exchange-hub|art exchange hub!]]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By DianaBerry//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\nOctober is over, and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-anthology-2024|Anthology 2024]]] has come to a close! Anthology is an event where authors released a single horror article for each day of October. This year's Anthlogy theme was phobias! We had an interview with [[*user S.D. Locke]], the organizer for Anthology 2024:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**What were the inspirations of Anthology when it first started?**\n\n1.) The inspiration was drawn from an experimental project from a collection of accounts I assume to be one or two users, that being the original HARBINGER.\n\nIt was a series of 10 SCPs posted either back-to-back or over a series of days, I cannot recall, but that each centered around a looming threat. Despite none surviving the voting process, in part due to their peculiarities and likely in part to their ambition and being posted by new accounts (I assume were sock puppets owing to familiarity with certain aspects of site lore) I still admired the attempt and collaborative approach. It was also inspired by the serialized set of works some have released such as Kalinin’s 001 or Matroyshka series, or series authored by HarryBlank. In our hobby site, it is often seen where tale series and the like will fall through or be left incomplete, so I appreciate when people stick to a strict schedule and follow through with completion of a series.\n\nI ran the 10-article HARBINGER II in 2021, as a direct successor to the inspiring project. It went well enough, tasking myself and 9 other authors to a strict release schedule of 10 SCPs centered around a vague and looming threat. The experience was rather fun, and at its conclusion I decided a scheduled series in this vein could be bigger and better— thus the ABCs of Death was formed the following year.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Anthology 2022 had The ABC’s of Death, and Anthology 2023 had Tarot Cards and it was in collaboration with The Wanderers Library. This year is all about Phobias, what got you to consider phobias for this year event?**\n\n\n\n2.) While I modeled the 2022 anthology after the horror film anthology of the same name, I chose Phobias as I’d simply needed something that was a broad enough category that would allow authors a wide selection of subject matter and still be a collection under the same thematic umbrella.\n\nI have nothing to do with the 2023 Tarot anthology, aside from offering a bit of advice to the project coordinator at its inception. Though, I do appreciate the torch was carried for that year, and from what I hear our sister wikis have undertaken the task of running their own anthologies (there was one on JP branch last year, if I am not mistaken).\n\n\n\n\n**How do you and other authors manage and plan this event?**\n\n\n\n3.) I’ve managed this event much as I did in 2022. Connecting with various authors and inviting them to the team based off my familiarity with/appreciation of their work.\n\nThis year was a bit different as I wanted to open the floor to both newer authors as well as those outside my limited scope of awareness. As such several members were more or less voted on or suggested by other team members.\n\nWhereas 2022’s began Oct 2021, this year I only began full operation with my volunteer thread on the mainsite back in February. More time is nice and all, but it is quite hard for most people to know their internet activity plans a whole year in advance.\n\nIn either case, the team has a dedicated discord server to ideate and plan their entries and seek feedback from the team. Most keep their inclusion under-wraps as I feel the surprise at who has joined is a fun reveal each day, and also keeps the new articles fresh for the community— they’ve not been passed around for critique to the point everyone has seen it, so it keeps the experience of each story fresh for the majority of readers.\n\n\n\n\n**What are your favorite entries so far?**\n\n\n\n4.) So far I’m quite fond of Montague’s entry. So much so that I reorganized our posting schedule to place his draft as our Day 1. I just felt it was an appropriate way to kick off the project. Cubeflix’s in particular is quite unnerving, Croque’s is a technical marvel, and Rounder’s was an enjoyable experience (doubly so as it was fresh for myself and the team as well. Nobody had seen the draft until it was posted!).\n\nIn all though, my personal favorite has yet to be released at time of writing. Our Halloween submission. Not the most bombastic epic piece, but it is one that frightened me in a way no other submission has.\n\n\n\n**What do you think fear or horror is, to you?**\n\n\n\n5.) Apart from being generally entertaining, it’s a genre that I’ve always seen as incredibly creative in a way you only see with sci-fi and weird fiction, in terms of high concepts and the like. It’s also cathartic in a way, explorations and manifestations of real-world traumas and ills in a way that’s safe but allowing one to reflect on them. Of course, running the gamut, it can also be simple, schlocky, grisly good fun. I grew up with a lot of horror fiction for kids such as Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark and was an avid Goosebumps nerd, so I suppose it just kind of stuck with me. Personally, it’s a fun way to express my creativity and get a reaction out of readers — for someone to note my work gave them nightmares is the kind of praise I hold in higher regard than general appreciation of writing quality (of which I’m undoubtedly outclassed by many on this site).\n\n\n\n**If an up-and-coming author wanted to participate in Anthology 2025 and onward, how would they sign up and participate?**\n\n\n6.) I will likely take no part in anything that occurs for 2025. Running these is quite a time investment between all the behind the scenes planning, critique, team building and keeping contact with over 30 people for the majority of a year. It takes up my site time in a way that keeps me from contributing in a staff capacity. I do have a fully formed plan for 2026 though, and submissions will be opened to the community at large. More info to come, but not for quite some time.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Do you have any final thoughts you would like to share with readers?**\n\n\n7.) I don’t think there’s anything else I’d like to note outside of what I’ve already expressed here or in the author post for this year’s anthology. I just hope everyone is enjoying the festivities.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Strange Matter//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\nDo you like horror and pieces that make your skin crawl?

It exists as a sister canon to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard 43] (although it does hold some key differences) that focuses on memetics and ideas having power. The canon and its associated series 'Absence' Makes the Heart Grow Fonder are run and largely written by [[*user Queerious]] and heavily feature her original character Heather Garrison.\n\nThankfully we had the wonderful opportunity to ask Queerious some questions about the canons history and future.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]  \n**1) What inspired you to begin writing for Forgotten memories and 'Absence'[[footnote]]shortening of 'Absence' Makes the Heart Grow Fonder[[/footnote]]?**\n\nMy wife and I were stuck in an airport, in the middle of what was meant to be a 15 minute wait, to a multi-hour delay as our flight was cancelled. On a whim, I opened the SCP Wiki, which I hadn't done in years. I ended up stumbling my way into [[[Bury the Survivors]]] and just... when I read Lillihammer, I realized that what I remembered the SCP Wiki as, versus what it was now were two completely different things.\n\nIt spiraled out from there -- I had finally found a character, who was like me, a trans woman haunted by her past. I've written before, and knew that I wanted to add my voice to the story. I ended up reaching out to [[*user HarryBlank]][[footnote]]Author of Bury the Survivors[[/footnote]] via Wikidot PMs, and to my surprise, he answered me. We chatted for a bit, and then I came up with the idea of [[[The Deadname Meme]]]. I wanted to write a piece for the wiki that was not only using a character I loved, paying tribute to an author whose work I deeply enjoyed, and it was a chance for me to put my voice into the characters. Harry is, unfortunately, not a trans woman; I am, and I wanted to give that insight into my depictions. Everything just kind of spiraled from there.\n\n**2) Was this always intended to be a canon? If not, why did it become one?**\n\nNo, not at all. The Deadname Meme was originally going to be a standalone work, where I might have reused the characters in the future. It wasn't until somebody asked me 'Is this going to be a series? It seems like it is.' that I realized, oh, wait. Maybe there is something here.\n\nImmediately after they had asked, I pulled up a sandbox and wrote an outline for the overall series. I still use that outline today, funnily enough, very little has changed in the overarching plot since that initial storm. Not that they're good outlines, mind you, but they're something.\n\nSo then, I starting writing it. Pretty soon, it had a Series tag, and I was trying to write side stories, building it out further and finishing out the main narrative. Fortunately, I never follow my own plans. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that I was limiting myself, and the world of Forgotten Memories -- it wasn't just the single story anymore, but a much larger universe with lore, character arcs, connective tissue and more. I seized that, and started to push the stories to expand what //Forgotten Memories// could be; and now it's not just a single story, it's a world of stories about forgotten ideas, margins, and the people who live in them.\n\n**3) The canon heavily features the character of and takes place at Site-43. Why did you choose to tie this canon into [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-guard-43-hub On Guard 43] instead of another, or even your own original, site and set of characters?**\n\nI was inspired from the start by On Guard 43. I loved the characters, and wanted to play with them; writing Heather into the role of a newcomer mirrored my experience in re-discovering the wiki. I had initially just planned on using The Deadname Meme to introduce her character, so that I could write more On Guard 43 pieces in the future, but, like I said above, it definitely spiraled out of control.\n \nIt is funny though; I have heard many times that the way I write Lillian is different than Harry, Grigori, or any of the other authors who have written her. She is my interpretation of Lillian: distinctive, but still recognizable as the same character. I wanted to take my lived experiences, and use them with the existing characters, to explore and reveal alternative sides of them, ones that hadn't been touched on before. To me, I wouldn't have been here if not for On Guard 43, so why not put it into that canon?\n \nAnd well, you know the rest; I did not expect this to become a canon, but here we are. Not to say that the canon is locked to Site-43, it has crossed over with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/eventyr-hub Eventyr], [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/seas-of-orcadia-hub Orcadia], and will eventually feature its own site and cast, but, you'll have to wait for that haha.\n\n**4) Now that the second half of 'Absence' has begun, can you share future plans for the series or the wider canon as a whole?**\n\nThe first half of 'Absence' focused on Heather and Lillian falling in love, and making rash decisions based on impulse -- the story focused onto the beginnings, their growth, showing just who they are and why they do what they do. It also set up how the universe works, and established the tone of Forgotten Memories.\n \nNow that I have all that out of the way, I am excited to begin writing the ramifications of their decisions. Every choice they have made so far in the series has consequences, even if //they// don't realize it yet. The next half is going to be the chips falling where they will.\n\nIn terms of where I want to take the overall canon: I've done work into explaining how the universe works, and the general themes, but I really want to dig into 'The Margins' more. In Forgotten Memories, they are the space outside of the Noosphere, between that, and the abyss; it is the home of lost knowledge and impossible ideas. I want to show how many different stories can be told, examining the canon through concepts, ideas, and humanity.\n\n**5) Is there any advice you'd have for readers interested in contributing to the canon?**\n\nI would say this: if you have a story to tell, a personal one that is about you, one that is screaming to be shared, this is the place for you. At its heart, Forgotten Memories is about memories, ideas, marginalized experiences, and intimacy of all forms; established characters, settings or otherwise aren't the core of Forgotten Memories.\n \nThe heart of every story is the struggle to be yourself in a world that deems you as abnormal, a world that has forgotten your story, a world that is terrifying. But it's also a world with people who love and care for one another, and how those personal connections can be some of the most meaningful experiences in a person's life. That is what //Forgotten Memories// is all about.\n\n**6) Do you have any final thoughts you'd like to share with readers?**\n\nI haven't been around on the wiki for very long, nor am I an expert in anything. But I can tell you that, no matter who you are, if you are willing to put in the work, if you can listen to and implement feedback, if you can be a part of the critique process, anything is possible.\n[[/div]]\nMake sure to keep an eye out for more works being posted to the canon!\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ProblemPal//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\nOne of the canons that was made official recently was [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fading-stars-hub|Fading Stars]]]! This is a canon based around culture and systems of belief, where every idea manifests as a god in a world of our subconscious. We had an interview with [[*user OriTiefling]], the canon runner for fading stars about the canon!\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**1) In your words, what is fading stars about?**\n\nFading Stars is, at it's core, about how colonial practices slowly erode away at the various things that make us human, and how those systems are perpetuated in the modern day. A lot of human culture and identity was lost in the age of colonization, and continues to be lost or misunderstood today. I wanted to see stories that not only recognized global cultures outside of the mainstream, but also highlighted the fact that the loss of culture is something uniquely painful.\n\n**2) What were some of the inspirations for fading stars?**\n\nI've done a lot of studies of various world myths, religious, spiritual beliefs, etc. over the years. Initially the inspiration was just an attempt to better represent a wider range of stories on the wiki. When I started writing for the wiki, the idea of a \"kinder\" site was also still somewhat novel-- things like the Integration Program didn't actually exist yet. The more I worked though, the more I wanted to explore the idea of a site that was kind on the surface, but still very much a part of the system at the end of the day.\n\n**3) Some of the major themes of fading stars are cultures and systems of belief. How did your own culture and beliefs tie into the canon as you started it?**\n\nI place a lot of value in memory. I follow the idea that you die twice-- the first death being the physical death, and the second being when your name is said for the last time. That formed a foundation for the setting as a whole. After all, what happens to something divine once it's forgotten? Can something divine die?\n\nIdeally this inspires other people to reflect on the idea of memory too, and take some time to keep the important people they've lost alive by sharing their stories and keeping their names around.\n\n**4) When you wrote the first stories in fading stars, were you expecting to make it into a canon? What made you decide to turn it into one?**\n\nYes and no. When I first started writing on the wiki, I did so with the idea I was writing for my own personal self-contained canon. I was originally developing an anomalous town in Georgia, actually, with themes more focused on small town America. You can still see it in articles like SCP-5469. Eventually I did decide I wanted to make Site-58 into a setting, and worked on trying to conceptualize exactly what that setting was going to be.\n\nThere comes a point you want to invite others to join in on the things that you're working on, you know? In a way that group participation invites others to find their place in it, and helps it leave an impact. Like I said-- it keeps the memory alive. I wanted it to eventually become something beyond just me.\n\n**5) Were there any changes or additions to fading stars since its conception that you weren’t expecting?**\n\nThe Anthology article, actually. I never conceptualized Fading Stars with proper horror in it. Existential dread, sure. Systemic abuse, yeah. But nothing that was properly horror themed. I think the Anthology article (SCP-8558 for reference!) opened some doors for what the setting itself could be.\n\nI'm still outlining some finer details too. As any author knows, things change in outlining, so I wouldn't be shocked to revisit this discussion in a year and go \"Yeah a lot of stuff changed lmao\"\n\n**6) Do you have any tips for authors aspiring to write for this canon?**\n\nA good starting point for someone is always coming up with your own god or goddess. In this setting, everything is divine in some way. Even the little things in your world have something that rules it as their domain. Think about something you often overlook, and imagine what a god for it would be like. Have fun from there-- have them get up to shenanigans with the Foundation! Or, if you want, explore what would happen to the world if that small, oft overlooked thing were to slowly vanish away.\n\nYour world is made up if a million things you never think about, that you never consider, and yet it would be a little emptier without them wouldn't it?\n\n**7) Could you list an article (or several, if you wish) in fading stars that you feel represent the themes of the canon very well? Why do you like them?**\n\nSCP-7999 is a quintessential example that, somehow, features no gods at all. It's an article fundamentally about what makes us human, and teaching ourselves not to take things for granted.\n\nSCP-5632 for an example of a goddess of something overlooked by society at large, but means something to vulnerable people.\n\nSCP-8585 for an example of treating the death of a god within the setting, and what a more somber tone looks like here.\n\nSCP-6059 for an example of a hyper-specific god and the kind of fun you can have with them!\n\nThe setting itself is meant to be fairly broad at the end of the day, covering a variety of tones and genres. The above give an example of that, and are great starting places for new authors and readers!\n\n**8) Do you have any final thoughts for the site news readers?**\n\nEverything you write and everything you put out becomes a part of the legacy that you leave behind. Everything, no matter if it's successful or not, has a chance to leave an impact on someone. Take pride in the act of creation, and take pride in sharing your work. It might make a difference to someone out there, and you may never know it.\n\nWhat we create will outlive us in the end, in ways we are yet to ever know. Through creation we live forever. So keep creating, don't let failure discourage you. I'm proud of you for trying at all.\n[[/div]]\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n\nCould you spook Nico?

We had an interview with [[*user Uncle Nicolini]] about their experience running this contest:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**What was the inspiration of Spook Nico Unofficial Contest 2024?**\n\n1.) There's a lot of horror articles on the site, but very few of them actually elicit a response from me. Many of them are just monsters or things that kill you, none of which do anything for me. I wanted to have a contest where people wrote horror with the full intent of scaring me.\n\n**What are your favorite entries so far?**\n\n2.) SCP-8980 and SCP-8824 are my favorites that have been published. They're both so visceral and vile in their subject matter, they left me feeling bad for a while after reading them. I know almost everyone has read 8980, but I recommend 8824 as well. Plus it's by a first-time author so it's always nice to support them.\n\n**In the hub, you stated that SCP-3817 is the scariest article on the site to you. Can you tell us more about that?**\n\n3.) Certainly. As an artist, the idea of stagnating and not developing my craft further as times goes on scares me. It may not be the biggest phobia ever or be particularly scary to most people, but I love writing and I do not want to stagnate ever in my career,\n\n**Would you do something like this again in the future?**\n\n4.) Maybe! Who knows what the future holds. 😉\n\n**What got you to choose your contest winners?**\n\n5.) One of the winners is decided by upvotes, and seeing as how one entry is at around 600 upvotes, I think that one is pretty sealed haha. The other category, my personal favorite, I have decided to grant to that very same entry becase it honestly is a masterclass. If forsome reason you haven't read SCP-8980, please do so. Unless you find it's subject matter triggering in which case do not.\n\n**Do you have any final thoughts to share with readers?**\n\n6.) Keep writing.
