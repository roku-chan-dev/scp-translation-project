I had the idea to make the whole test chamber cake about halfway through and was like \"Oh yeah.\" I know it's not actually in the article but there's no canon and the original article doesn't have anything in it implying this WOULDN'T be possible(Not to mention the fact that hyperrealistic cake videos are godless plains of existence where I've seen a wall turn out to be the cake) so technically there's no reason it COULDN'T have happened.\n\nAlso, I'm going back to my roots with this one.\n\nThe first time I ever did pixel art was when I tried to make a Minecraft texture pack where the whole world was cake. I had no idea what I was doing and got frustrated that dirt had the textured on ALL sides and gave up. Years later I revisited the idea once resource packs became a thing and I was able to get the dirt to look nice. But by that point, it was 1.13 and there were way too many blocks in the game. Maybe one day I'll finish it.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
