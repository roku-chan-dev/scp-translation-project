Humidity of these cells is to be kept at 58%. SCP-2963-5 is to be fed once per day with liquid nutrient solution.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2963 refers to 7 distinct entities that formerly comprised D-3553-3, a D-Class individual previously used by researchers assigned to SCP-████,[[footnote]]Powerful reality bender, considered neutralized as of 6/2/20██.[[/footnote]] under supervision of Dr. McCauley. D-3553-3 was converted into its current state during a failed containment attempt of SCP-████, which also resulted in the deaths of two additional D-class and four containment personnel.\n\nEach entity grows and functions as a non-anomalous organ system would. SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6 are able to speak in some capacity, despite lacking the necessary anatomy to do so. For records of such communications see sample interview logs.\n||Item||Description||Notes||\n||SCP-2963-1||Nervous System||Most communicative instance, possesses personality very similar to D-3553-3’s original personality. Able to locomote by pulling itself along horizontal surfaces, despite lacking necessary cell structure to do so. All nerve structures are intact and functional.||\n||SCP-2963-2||Skeletal System||Communicates very rarely, but appears to possess intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -3. Bones are held together in form of human skeleton by unknown force.||\n||SCP-2963-3||Muscular System||Possesses intellect on par with SCP-2963-1 and -2, communicates often. SCP-2963-3 is most prone to hostility and violence if provoked, and should be treated with caution. SCP-2963-3 typically maintains humanoid form, but is capable of moving as an amorphous mass.||\n||SCP-2963-4||Cardiovascular and Respiratory Systems||Moves in a similar fashion to SCP-2963-1, though it is able to scale sheer vertical surfaces. If SCP-2963-4 is deprived of oxygen, all 7 SCP-2963 entities will begin to suffocate.||\n||SCP-2963-5||Digestive, Renal, and Excretory System||SCP-2963-5 does not move, and is not believed to be self-aware. Entity must be fed a liquid nutrient solution in order to maintain entirety of SCP-2963. All waste produced by SCP-2963 is excreted by SCP-2963-5. ||\n||SCP-2963-6||Integumentary System[[footnote]]Skin, hair, and nails.[[/footnote]] ||SCP-2963-6 is capable of communication, though does so rarely. Entity floats approximately one meter above ground by unknown means, and is capable of maneuvering through very small gaps. SCP-2963’s containment chamber has been made airtight as a precaution.||\n||SCP-2963-7||Reproductive, Endocrine, and Immune Systems||Entity moves similarly to terrestrial gastropods, with organs forming a foot to pull the instance forward.||\n\nBelow are sample interview transcripts with SCP-2963-1, -2, -3, and -6.\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview SCP-2963-1-4\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> **Foreword:** At time of interview, SCP-2963 had been in containment for 2 months. Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, Senior Researcher assigned to SCP-2963, formerly assigned to SCP-████ and thus familiar with SCP-2963\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Hello again, how are you this morning?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** Well, I still look like overcooked spaghetti and share a room with my own intestines, so you know, the usual.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right. We have a few more questions for you today, if you don’t mind.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** Fire away.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** How much can you remember of your life prior to your current state?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** You mean back when I was in one piece? All of it. Childhood, growing up, drug charges, other charges, death row, coming here, getting used like a lab-rat, and...\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** And what?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** And the kid. The bender kid.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** You mean ████?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** Yeah. Mark. That was his name.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right. How much do you remember of your time assigned to the ████ team?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** A lot. They used us to deal with the kid. I guess they were afraid of him. But the other Ds didn’t talk much, but I got to know him pretty well. I liked him, good kid.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Until he tore your organs apart.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** He was scared. What’s a kid supposed to do when armed goons come after him?\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** They typically cry. He leveled a building.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** An //empty// building! He wouldn’t have done it if there were people there!\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** He killed six, and did this to you.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-1:** Because they were holding a gun to his head! He was scared! He...he was just a kid. He didn’t know what he was doing\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right. I think we can end here for now. Thank you for your cooperation.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview SCP-2963-3-5\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann. SCP-2963 had been in containment for four months. Interview conducted through Plexiglas plate due to SCP-2963-3’s history of violence.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Good afternoon, three. \n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** Aaron. Don’t use the number, I’m not a D anymore.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** No, just a scp. 2963//-3//.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** Use my damn name. You motherfuckers are the reason I got this way.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** No, that would be SC-\n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** It’s not the kid’s fault. You can’t be mad at a bomb for going off. Especially if you planted it.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Quaint. We have a few more questions for you, if you’ll cooperate.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** Fire away.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Well as you know, we’ve determined that D-3553-3’s original personality was...fragmented by the incident that resulted in your creation.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** That’s what you keep saying, yeah. I don’t buy it. I’m still me.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Partially. As far as we can tell it’s -1 who got D-3553-3’s original personality. You’re close, but you display markedly higher aggression, host-\n> \n> **SCP-2963-3:** Maybe I’m aggressive because I’m a fucking meat-puppet! Because you sons of bitches made me this way! Because that judge had it in for me! Because the last 6 fucking years have been nothing but tests and labor and the inside of a cell! Because you killed the fucking kid, because you-\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Enough, -3.\n> \n> //SCP-2963-3 throws itself at the glass, attempting to break through. During this, SCP-2963-3 screams unintelligibly.//\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right, I think that’ll be it for today then. Thank you for your cooperation.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview SCP-2963-2-2\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, SCP-2963 had been in containment for five months. SCP-2963-2 requested an interview - request was granted as this was only the second attempt at communication -2 had made thus far.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Good evening, can I ask why you’ve asked for this interview?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I have information.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Okay, did you not have this information when we tried to interview you previously?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** Yes.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Why didn’t you tell us before?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I did not think it relevant.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Ok, what do you have to tell us?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I do not know who we are.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** We? You mean the rest of you?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** Yes. The Brain knows. The Muscle knows. I do not. The Skin does not. The others do not know enough to know anything.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Do you mean you possesses a separate memory from -1 and -3? \n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I do not remember living as the person we are.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** So your memories start after separation?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** No.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** What? What do you remember?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I remember a life. A different life. The details are faded. I think it was a place far away.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** And you believe you and -6 came from this other person?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** No. I did. The Skin is something else. From somewhere else. A shaper of flesh. A god-eater. \n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** I see. Do you have any idea why you were chosen for this? How you were pulled into D-3553-3's skeleton?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** I believe we were tangent to this world. When the child was killed, it released an enormous amount of energy that tore through such barriers, and brought us here.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Ah. Well this is a lot of information to process. Thank you for coming to us with this. \n> \n> **SCP-2963-2:** You’re welcome.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n>\n> //Note: Research into the possible origins of SCP-2963-2’s and -6’s consciousnesses is ongoing.// \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Interview SCP-2963-6 is restricted to personnel with Level 3 or higher clearance.\" hide=\"Credentials accepted.\"]]\n> **Foreword:** Interview conducted by Dr. McGann, the day after Interview SCP-2963-2-2.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Hello, -6.\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** Please, call me Aaron.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Ah yes, your name, right?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** Yes.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right. Tell me, Aaron, how much do you remember of your life before this?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** I have told your people, I do not remember much. \n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Right, just double checking. What about Mark?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** Who?\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Mark. The kid?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** I’m sorry, I don’t recall having any children.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** SCP-████\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** Ah yes. The reality bender.\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Yes. Do you have any idea why I requested this interview?\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** No. Is there something wrong?\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Well it’s just that yesterday we spoke to -2 and he-\n> \n> **SCP-2963-6:** What did it say?\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** He told us that you... aren’t D-3553-3.\n> \n> //SCP-2963-6 remains silent//\n> \n> **Dr. McGann:** Well?

Neither SCP-2963-2 or SCP-2963-6 have been cooperative for further interviews.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2962]]] | SCP-2963 | [[[SCP-2964]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
