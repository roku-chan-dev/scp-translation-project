Despite an authorized review by the on-site forensic department, there are as of yet no clues as to who is responsible for publishing Document 941-B. Even though much of the information within Document 941-B has been proven false after lengthy investigations, such periodicals are not repeat not permitted under the employee contract.\n\n//ALL// periodicals must be submitted to and approved by at least two Level 3 administrators and must be printed using supplied on-site equipment. \n\n//Note from O5-█: \nEven though we have yet to find any further items related to Document 941-B, we must still be on the lookout for possible attempts to distribute items like these. They only serve to undermine the established authority and can possibly have negative effects on the disposition of researchers.//\n\n//Note:// \nWHO THE HELL IS PRINT ABOUT MY SEX LIFE\nSON OF THE BITCH\nI HAVE YOUR --HEAD-- ASS FOR THIS YOU SON OF A BITCHES\n\n//-D. Strelnikov//\n\n\nWith respect, Captain, none of this can possibly contain information the whole site wasn't aware of before.\n//-Dr. Light//\n\nFor the record, you totally traded down. \n//-Agent Yoric//\n\nHey man, how come this one even has some Javanese date and matchmaking articles? It even has prediction dates for some of our personnel... Let's see... Iceberg, Kliwon Friday ██th ████████, ████... 'Be careful, watch for the flying money hidden dump' ...I seriously can't decipher this one.\n//-Agent Carriontrooper//\n\nMOVE ALONG NOW, NOTHING TO SEE HERE, PEOPLE.\nIN PARTICULAR, PAGE SIXTEEN IS TO BE TREATED AS, ahem, A CLASS- uh, TWELVE MEMETIC HAZARD.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.\n//-Dr. Klein//\n\nI am not a Monkey.\n//-Dr. Bright//\n\nOn the upside, the extra advertisement from the ban should sell enough to cover printing cos- er, nevermind. How do I make it erase that?\n//-Agent Yoric//\n\nIt all really depends on your definition of Doctor, I suppose. I refuse to comment beyond that.\n//-Lurker//\n\nSo THAT is what happened to that poor, poor pony.\n//-Dr. Ziegler//\n\nDamn. I expected an article about Strelnikov's beak wetting habits, but I didn't expect close-up pictures...\n//-Dr. Kald//\n\nI think I was at that wedding.\n//-Agent Nicholakis//\n\nI was at 914 and Gears' counselling session. It was the most uninteresting thing ever.\n//-Agent Spoon//\n\nWhoever came up with \"Dear Able: Advice for the Lovelorn\": that was funny as hell, and it was nice knowing you.\n//-Dr. Lambert//\n\nEverything on page 16 is FALSE. FALSEFALSEFALSE. And I swear I'm going to hurt someone the next time I hear the word \"Necrololi\".\n//~Dr. Trebuchet//\n\nRegarding the article on page 24 about my botched attempt to get 050... The pictures about the \"Sushi-Inator\" are just photoshops of 914 with inari-sushi filling! I wasn't even near 914 that day, so shut up about trying to get pictures of Josie wrapped in seaweed! IT NEVER HAPPENED!\n//-Dr. Okagawa//\n\nThat Pisces horoscope regarding 999 is just downright disturbing.\n//-Dr. Armstrong//\n\nJesus Strelnikov, I had to turn those pictures upside down twice before I realised what they were showing.\n//- Dr. Aeish//\n\nWho the fuck approved a 231-7 paternity test?\n//-Dr. Stoeckle//\n\nI see that nobody else slipped the Internal Communications staff a fifty to keep their mouths shut.\n//-Clef//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
