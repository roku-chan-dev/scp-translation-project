Deering. It appears as he did at the time of death: uniform torn and bloody, with its burst eyes running down its face and onto its clothing. The flesh of its fingertips has been melted away, and the protruding bones sharpened like claws. \n\n[[include component:image-block name= brother.png|caption= Captured footage of SCP-8956 manifesting upon a surface.|width=250px|align= right]]\n\nSCP-8956 resides within all reflective surfaces within and around Site-43, and has shown itself to be incredibly hostile to all personnel. Any individual within the line of sight of a reflective surface is at immediate risk of attack if SCP-8956 manifests.[[footnote]] It has been noted that SCP-8956 is capable of fourteen independent manifestations at a time.[[/footnote]] When confronted by an individual, SCP-8956 has two methods of attack. \n\nThe first method consists of attempting to drag the victim into the reflective surface. If successful, they will be pulled through it as though it were a liquid. Any individual it completes this process on is lost. If the surface is not large enough for this to occur, it will result in the often fatal dismemberment of the victim.\n\nThe second, and more common, method of attack by SCP-8956 is it reaching out from the surface to physically claw or scratch the victim. \n\nIt has been found that wounds from SCP-8956 do not heal, even when prompted by typical methods of accelerated healing (i.e. thaumaturgy) and will instead fester. While more serious and deep wounds can be fatal, and all are prone to infection, survival is possible if medical attention is given quick enough and is maintained for the remainder of the individual's life. \n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"table5 tableb\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"» VIEW ADDITIONAL MEDICAL DOCUMENTATION «\" hide=\"« COLLAPSE DOCUMENTATION »\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n||~ MEDICAL DETAILING: 8956 ||\n||**REPORT BY:** Dr. Billie Forsythe (Health and Pathology) ||\n||In the initial wake of the paradox, being wounded by SCP-8956 was nigh unto a death sentence. We didn't know the wounds wouldn't heal, we bandaged people and went on our way in dealing the dead -- but then they'd come back to us, horrifically infected, and we realized the medical nightmare on our hands. _\n _\nIt grew easier with time, though. The wounds are often grievous, but they can still be //treated//, the person can still be saved. Having the medical synthesizers up and running for morphine, antibiotics and the like doesn't hurt, either. It's just a matter of immediate and continued medical attention. _\n _\nThe wounds infect easily, and scarcely even //clot//, but binding them tight enough can staunch them in a way that can somewhat quell the bleeding. As we grew to understand the nature of these wounds, we became more effective in dealing with them. _\n _\nIf the scratches are shallow, or border on superficial, we can simply remove the portion of afflicted flesh. Reconstructive surgery, or skin grafts, may be necessary in the wake of it -- but it will spare the patient from pain. In situations where there are deep wounds, there can be solutions when these sorts of injuries linger on the limbs. Amputation was an extreme measure proposed early on, and swiftly became something we offered to those injured. It's a drastic thing to do, but some do take it. Though, we did not have proper prostheses on-hand within the Site, and have thus been forced to rely on crafting our own for those in need. _\n _\nUnfortunately, deep wounds to the face or chest cannot be effectively removed without putting the patient in more danger than the original wounds pose. For them, or those unwilling to undergo amputation, we treat. Bind their wounds, give them the supplies necessary to take care of themselves, and check on them with some frequency. A blood drive has been set up to aid the afflicted, as bi-monthly transfusions can improve their health greatly. They will bear the chronic pain of the wounds for the remainder of their days, but we will do all we can to ease them through it. _\n _\nAs it currently stands, it's not uncommon to see personnel within Site-43 with forever bloodied bandages upon their frame, or those with ramshackle prothesis -- but as the years have ticked on, the casualties at that monster's hands have lessened, as we have learned to mend what it has hurt. _\n||\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWhen within the presence of Dr. Dougall Deering, SCP-8956 appears to become pacified. Instead, the entity will begin to vocalize in a monotone version of Philip Deering's own voice -- listing Dr. Deering's achievements at the Foundation as well as his personal virtues. At no point will SCP-8956 look directly at Dr. Deering, and he alone among the personnel of Site-43 cannot hear its vocalizations.\n\nAfter 2023/09/08 there was a noted change in the demeanor of SCP-8956. While in the previous year the entity typically kept a blank expression, it henceforth appeared visibly distressed. Its already jerking movements became noticeably more erratic, and the aggression behind its attacks has increased.\n\n------\n\n||~ ADDENDUM: 8956 Behavioral Report ||\n|| **DATE:** 2034/09/08 _\n**OFFICER OF RECORD:** A. Mukami (Chief of Security and Containment) ||\n|| **SUMMARY:** Due to the REISNO Cannon not re-manifesting as expected, Dr. Deering was unable to fulfill his containment duties and, by proxy, survived the Breach. Notably, while some minor things went haywire, it wasn't anywhere near as disastrous as expected. He just... survived, and unlike the other times we've failed in ensuring the Victims' deaths, he didn't become some twisted specter, either. He's the same Dougall Deering that took his own life 11 years ago. For better, or for worse. _\n _\nNo one's really sure what to do about it, but it's useless to keep spilling his blood now that the Cannon is gone. It's not like that's going to fix anything. _\n _\nHowever, it has been observed that Dr. Deering's newfound survival has coincided with SCP-8956 returning to the behaviors that it had expressed prior to his death. It feels twisted to say, but when it started talking again, I could've sworn there was a trace of something different in its voice. _\n||\n \n------\n\nWhen Dr. Deering attempted to leave Quantum Supermechanics following his revival, he ended up separated from the present personnel when an [[[scp-6643|unknown, serpentine entity]]] attempted to attack the group. Before it was able to make contact with Dr. Deering, however, SCP-8956 intervened. \n\nDespite typical levels of corrupted footage, it can be seen on the recordings that SCP-8956 had shoved Dr. Deering out of the entity's path, and swiftly departed after the aggressor demanifested.\n\n------\n\n||~ ADDENDUM: Post-Breach Medical Check-up ||\n|| **DATE:** 2034/09/08 _\n**OFFICER OF RECORD:** B. Forsythe (Health and Pathology) ||\n|| <BEGIN LOG> _\n _\n//Deering sits tensely on the hospital bed as Forsythe presses a stethoscope to his chest. She scowls slightly when he pulls back to stare at something behind her. A reflective pane of glass that has been temporarily placed in the room in an attempt to herd SCP-8956.// _\n _\n**Forsythe:** Lean into the stethoscope, please. It's hard to hear your heartbeat when you keep leaning away. _\n _\n**Deering:** He saved me. I saw that thing come screaming down the hall, and Ph— //and 8956//— saved me. Jumped right out of a wall and pushed me clean out of the way. But why? I need to know why. I can't -- I can't keep doing this, why the //hell// would he do that? _\n _\n **Forsythe:** He was always talking about you, he calms when you're around. It sorta makes sense that he would try to save you if he had the chance. _\n _\n **Deering:** But why now? Why is he always talking about how great I am when I clearly am not? Why can't //I// fucking hear him? _\n _\n//Deering makes an exasperated gesture, head dipping down.// _\n _\n **Forsythe:** It's clear there's... I dunno, a brotherly love at play here? Please stop talking, I'm trying to listen to your heartbeat. _\n _\n**Deering:** Oh don't give me that. I treated Philip like shit. I was //ashamed// of him, like some uptight bastard. You think I don't deserve this? I don't even deserve to be alive. I don't know //why// I'm alive. _\n _\n**Forsythe:** //[Taken aback]// I don't know why you-- _\n _\n**Deering:** Don't bullshit me, Billie. You and I both know I deserve nothing but death. And everyone else knows it too. I've bet they've spent the past 11 years all glad I was gone. _\n _\n**Forsythe:** I certainly don't think so, Dr. Deering. _\n _\n**Deering:** I see how everyone in this place looks at me. I couldn't //stand// it, every damn day. //[Deering pauses, he shakes his head a touch manically.]// Maybe he decided to torture me. Maybe he thinks death is too good. What do you say to that, eh, Phil? _\n _\n//Deering turns to stare at SCP-8956. Its lips move, and Deering turns to face Forsythe again.// _\n _\n**Deering:** What did he say? _\n _\n//She hesitates.// _\n _\n**Forsythe:** He said he'd never hurt his brother. _\n _\n//Deering suddenly stands and approaches the glass, Forsythe glancing over her shoulder with a furrowed brow. For a few moments, he stares at SCP-8956 and its empty gaze -- before balling up his hand and abruptly striking the glass with a fist. It sends splintering cracks along the surface, fourteen figures within, as shards scatter across the floor. His blood drips to the ground, and Forsythe backs away to her desk in order to reach for her Solution 001-A. She grips the vial tightly in her hand, watching.// _\n _\n**Deering:** That son of a bitch isn't my brother. It's a mockery. //[He shudders, pained]// Fuck— _\n _\n//Deering grips his right hand as it continues to bleed. He grits his teeth and squeezes his eyes closed, curling in on himself.// _\n _\n**Forsythe:** Dr. Deering, I— _\n _\n**Deering:** //GOD DAMMIT!// _\n _\n<END LOG> _\n _\n**NOTE:** Dr. Deering was recommended to keep a journal of his daily thoughts and emotions for therapeutic purposes. _\n||\n@@@@\n-----\nThe following is a compilation of relevant pages from Dr. Deering's journal, collected by Security and Containment after Incident 8956.\n-----\n||~ ADDENDUM: Dougall Deering's Journal ||\n|| **DATE:** 2034/09/10 ||\n|| Maybe this really is Phil.
