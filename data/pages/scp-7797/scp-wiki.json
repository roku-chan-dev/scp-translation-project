ATF-Chi-43's surveillance division is to monitor for any potential evidence of an instance of SCP-7797 appearing, and establish the approximate time and place of the appearance. Once an instance has been confirmed and located, Protocol 7797-HORUS is to be immediately enacted.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"◇ACCESS PROCEDURE 7797-HORUS◇\" hide=\"◆PROPER CREDENTIALS VERIFIED. ACCESS GRANTED.◆\"]]\n[[<]]\n> **Overview:** Procedure 7797-HORUS is the designated instructions for containing/neutralizing SCP-7797 while minimizing civilian exposure, and should only be used by members of ATF-Chi-43. Procedure 7797-HORUS should be initiated once:\n>\n> * An instance of SCP-7797 has been confirmed.\n> * The general location of the instance has been determined.\n>\n> **Instructions:** Once the approximate location of a SCP-7797 instance has been determined, ATF-Chi-43's field division is to travel to the location for neutralization. Aerial drone surveillance should be used to discern the exact location of an instance, and once found, a perimeter around the instance should be established under the guise of local government maintenance. Depending on the instance's substance, industrial paint remover or pressure washing should be used to remove the instance. If removal proves impossible, the surface that the instance is located on should be destroyed. \n> \n> Once the instance of SCP-7797 has been removed, medical records should be traced to identify any individuals that are or previously were affected by SCP-7797. Recorded individuals should be logged and provided with Class-B amnestics. \n> \n> **Addendum:** Following Incident 7797-B, contingency procedures for circumstances involving mass civilian exposure or difficulty in instance neutralization should be created and implemented as soon as possible to prevent future incidents. \n> \n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ **##maroon|Description##**\n[[/=]]\n-----\nSCP-7797 is a Cerulean-Syracuse Class cognitohazard that takes the form of an illustrated design resembling a stylized eye, with the design itself not appearing to reference any known hieroglyphics or historical designs. SCP-7797 is capable of manifesting in multiple forms of visual creation, such as graffiti, paper drawing, or painting, and with a variety of materials, including acrylic/industrial paint, pen, colored pencil, and bodily fluids, with all known instances being various shades of red.\n\nSCP-7797 is self-replicating, and can create instances of itself globally. Current understanding of SCP-7797 indicates that it replicates by subconsciously influencing individuals into creating an instance, while rendering the individual unaware of the memetic effect. Research into details of the replication is still undergoing. Foundation attempts to recreate an instance of SCP-7797 have ended in failure, with the artificial design not possessing any of the anomalous characteristics SCP-7797 normally creates. \n\nSCP-7797's primary anomalous effects arise when an instance is directly viewed by a human. Once observed, the viewer will experience a short sensation of vertigo before subsiding, and will subsequently be \"infected\" by SCP-7797. Humans affected by SCP-7797 will begin to suffer a series of anomalous symptoms and effects, with the length of these symptoms lasting from a few days to multiple weeks. The symptomology of those affected by SCP-7797 vary between individuals, with no discernable way to predict or prevent the potential effects. Additional research has shown that victims who were previously affected by SCP-7797 cannot be infected again when viewing SCP-7797. No known medication or treatment is able to diminish the effects of SCP-7797.\n@@ @@ \n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ **##maroon|Addendum##**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++++ **SCP-7797 Exposure Logs:**\n@@ @@\nThe following are a series of individuals who were affected by SCP-7797 and were utilized for testing purposes.

When ATF-Chi-43 was founded eight months ago, some of them complained their job was too easy. There were only one or two instances a month, and they were, for the most part, inconspicuous, hidden in back alleys or on the side of shipping containers. \n> \n> Then the Incidents happened, and no one is complaining now.\n> \n> Instances are showing up everywhere, and they're, for lack of a better word, more aggressive. Now they're showing up on buildings. The sides of houses. We even found one on a scrap of paper in a school. The situation is alarming at best. We're up to six or seven instances a month, and in December, we had fifteen. And the trend is getting worse. Fatality rates in August were around seven percent, and are now around sixteen. With how severe this is becoming, we need to seriously consider the possibility of a Broken Masquerade scenario. \n> \n> We are aware that there is an entity behind this, one we know almost nothing about. We know that it is powerful enough to create this cognitohazard, it has contact with Apollyon level entities, and that it wants knowledge.  However, we have two advantages. The first is that this entity is supposedly \"weaker\" than it used to be. That's not much of a measurement, considering we are still unaware of its full capabilities, but it is a start. The second one is that, based on our current assumptions, this entity exists outside of the noosphere, yet is capable of entering it at will through a form of possession. \n> \n> That's why I'm initiating this proposal. I've done some research in my spare time about SCP-7797. Based on current evidence, this entity seems to be capable of entering human consciousness and even taking control. Theoretically, it could be possible to set some sort of \"bait\" in the form of someone exposed to SCP-7797, then potentially trap the entity while it's occupying the bait's consciousness. How we'd actually contain it is hazy at best. I've discussed with some researchers and they've offered a  solution; a modified containment cell that's designed to resist particle shifts from separate dimensions. A faraday cage for the anomalous, if you will. We lure the entity into the host, trap it within the cell, and stop it from trying to escape. It's a thin solution, but it's a starting point, and it won't work without a team. \n> \n> I propose we assemble a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/man-in-the-monocle private Task Force] dedicated to the sole purpose of capturing, interrogating, and neutralizing the entity behind SCP-7797. If the entity is as omniscient as it claims, and we do find a way to pacify it, the research and information potential is staggering, and could prove to be invaluable. We already know it's connected to other sentient entities of interest; we could use it's knowledge to radically benefit our efforts. I've scouted out the current head of ATF-Chi-43, Tyler Yamaguchi, as a potential candidate for spearheading this operation, and he seems like the ideal choice for the program. It wouldn't be a task force. It wouldn't even exist in the Foundation records, at least until they complete their mission. If they complete their mission.\n> \n> In all honesty, I don't entirely expect this to work. Besides the scraps of information we gained from the incident, we barely know anything about this entity, not even its name. It might as well be impossible to neutralize or even talk to it, like trying to kill a god. But it's a potential solution, at the very least. And if we don't, seeing the exponential prevalence of the SCP, we may not have much time as it is. It seems like a waste to delegate resources to what is basically a snipe hunt. But we may not have a choice.\n> \n> \n> \n> **Proposal:** Designate a team made up of former veteran Task Force researchers to contain, interrogate, and eventually neutralize the entity behind SCP-7797.\n> \n> **Resolution:**\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> ++ **##maroon|APPROVED.##**\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= « [[[SCP-7796]]] | SCP-7797 | [[[SCP-7798]]] »\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** My Eyes Shall Watch\n> **Author:** [[*user DAViBOI]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7797\n\n\n> **Filename:** spooky\n> **Author:** [[*user DAViBOI]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7797\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
