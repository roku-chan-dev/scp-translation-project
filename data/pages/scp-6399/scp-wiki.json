Maintenance of SCP-6399 is to be handled by RAISA.\n\nDocumentation produced by SCP-6399 is to be reviewed by the Archival Department for errors before publication into the database.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6399 is a Foundation AIC[[footnote]]Artificially Intelligent Construct[[/footnote]] with the designation biograph.aic. It has been assigned to automatically document anomalous artifacts.\n\nSCP-6399 is capable of analysis to a degree that would be considered anomalous. It has full access to general knowledge via public internet networks, and uses that as a cross-reference for creating documentation.\n\nDespite having such high analytical capabilities, documentation produced by SCP-6399 normally contains several spelling and grammar errors. SCP-6399 has struggled to maintain a clinical tone throughout produced documentation.\n\n**Addendum 6399.1: Produced Documentation**\n\n[[div id=\"insertcode\" style=\"background-color: black; text-color: green; padding: 7px; border: 5px solid brown; border-radius: 30px\"]]\n##white|Welcome to SCiPnet, Dr. Murali.

In order to streamline this process more efficiently, results now are transmitted through to the Archival Department for review rather than requiring user input.\n\n**Addendum 6399.2: Interview Log**\nAfter authorization from RAISA, an interview was held with SCP-6399 to discuss the tasks it has been assigned.\n\n[[div id=\"insertcode\" style=\"background-color: black; text-color: green; padding: 7px; border: 5px solid brown; border-radius: 30px\"]]\n##white|Welcome to SCiPnet, Dr. Dana.
