Containment efforts are to focus solely on cataloguing changes made by SCP-6389. Changes may be reverted on a case-by-case basis; should a document be left in its altered state, printed copies of the unaltered version will be made available to all relevant personnel.\n\n+ Description\n\nSCP-6389 is a Foundation AI operating under the codename \"Sculptor-Hypnos\". Its primary function prior to emergence of anomalous properties was to correct vandalized or otherwise damaged texts. While it was mainly employed correcting documents that were altered by anomalous means, it was also capable of recreating texts that had been partially deleted or had suffered damage in some way, such as its use in recovering journal entries pertaining to [[[SCP-6918|SCP-6918]]].\n\nDuring the collapse of [[[SCP-5389|SCP-5389-B]]], SCP-6389 isolated all systems within SCP-5389-B from the Foundation's intranet as a method of preventing alterations to documents pertaining to SCP contained within Site-109. On April 21st, 2018, systems within SCP-5389-B were able to reconnect to SCiPnet. Between the collapse on April 13th and the reconnection event on the 21st, hundreds of attempts to connect to Foundation servers were made. These reconnection attempts were not perpetrated by SCP-6389. Site Director Dr. Marsh's credentials were used in the successful reconnection on April 21st; records show that his username and password had been independently utilized several times prior in conjunction with usernames and passwords of other, unrelated personnel.\n\nSCP-6389's new behavior of committing vandalism instead of undoing it is non-anomalous. While outside of its original mission, SCP-6389 has determined the information provided by its edits to be of higher priority. Editing documents is presently the only means to relay a message accessible to it. SCP-6389 has been reclassified as Thaumiel, though it cannot protect you forever. It is to be allowed to continue activity, so long as proper steps are taken to ensure SCP-6389 does not interfere with personnel working on unrelated anomalies.\n\nAs neither SCP-6389 nor Site Director Marsh had access to documentation of Level 5 Clearance, this version of the document has been placed under that level of protection to ensure the information within can remain accurate without risk of being compromised.\n\n+ Addendum: Selection of Edits Made by SCP-6389\n\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nAffected Document\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell]]\nSummary of Document\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell]]\nEdit(s) Made by SCP-6389\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\nSecure Facility Dossier: Site-109\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nPage had been previously slated for deletion following Site-109's designation as [[[SCP-5389|SCP-5389-B]]].\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nAll text in the dossier was removed and replaced with the following: \"The womb in which He develops.
