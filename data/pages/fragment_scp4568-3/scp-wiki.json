An archive of relevant revisions is included for purposes of context and analysis.\n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 4568\n|clearance= 4\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= hiemal\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/hiemal-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= ekhi\n|risk-class= danger\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A disinformation campaign is ongoing to provide a natural justification for any seismic activity caused by ##blue|SCP-4568-1 or oceanic abnormalities due to SCP-4568-2##; currently, this is attributed to the interaction of three concurrent tectonic plates near SCP-4568's main area of activity.\n\nThe building codes in countries affected by SCP-4568 (mainly continental Chile, the west of Argentina, Peru and Bolivia) is to be designed to ensure that buildings are able to withstand earthquakes of up to ##blue|Class X## on the Modified Mercalli seismic intensity scale. Foundation personnel embedded in the security and emergency services of the affected countries are to direct evacuation and rescue efforts whenever necessary in order to reduce the impact of SCP-4568 and prevent a Broken Masquerade scenario.\n\n##blue|SCP-4568-1 should be allowed to continue its activity unimpeded; containment proposals are to focus on mitigation procedures and disinformation. Neutralization proposals for any component of SCP-4568 are preemptively denied by the O5 Council.##\n\n##blue|Communication attempts from SCP-4568-1 or SCP-4568-2 are to be recorded and cross-referenced with known information about ongoing and potential ℵK-Class Deific Confrontation scenarios.##\n\n**Description:** ##blue|SCP-4568-1## is a massive, subterranean, serpentine entity which inhabits below the Andean mountain range in South America. Current estimates indicate a length of at least 500 km, and a width of around 20 km. The entity is animate and autonomous and is composed of molten rock, highly compressed sediments, various metals, and ice. Sonar analysis reveals the existence of --potentially-- artificial structures, resembling clockwork, gears and primitive circuits, along the body of the entity; these structures have no identified purpose and do not seem to be the mechanism behind the autonomous movement of ##blue|SCP-4568-1##. \n\n##blue|SCP-4568-1## remains dormant most of the time. However, at certain periods the entity displaces itself along the Andean mountain range. Due to its massive size, this usually results in large-scale seismic activity, with magnitude proportional to the degree of displacement. --Pattern analysis suggests that-- These movements are in response to --an unknown trigger-- ##blue|SCP-4568-2 exiting a dormancy period,## and the seismic activity is intentionally caused by ##blue|SCP-4568-1 in order to incapacitate SCP-4568-2##. --The purpose, if there is any, is unknown; due to the large amount of casualties caused by SCP-4568, the entity is presumed to be hostile. It is unknown if SCP-4568 is sapient.-- ##blue|SCP-4568-1 is sapient, with above-human intelligence and very high memetic resistance. While not actively hostile, it is aware of the casualties product of its seismic activity and considers them a \"regrettable necessity\" to restrain SCP-4568-2.##\n\n##blue|SCP-4568-2 is a marine, sapient, serpentine entity of comparable size comprised of water, sand, algae, and steam. It often incorporates extant marine lifeforms into its mass; these do not appear to be harmed by the process, although they exhibit some degree of (usually beneficial) mutations after exposure. Marine lifeforms have proven themselves capable of extricating and reincorporating themselves into SCP-4568-2's mass at any time.##\n\n##blue|SCP-4568-2 is actively hostile to human life, having repeatedly expressed its intention of causing the extinction of humanity. SCP-4568-2 claims that its goal is to stop a \"great calamity\" that will result in the destruction of nature and the consequent elimination of all life on Earth. While at first this was thought to refer to some sort of ecological disaster, further statements by SCP-4568-2 now suggest that this would be a tangential aftereffect of a MK-Class \"End of Human Consciousness\" scenario of undetermined origin (see below for further details).##\n\n##blue|SCP-4568-2 is capable of using resonance effects and vibrations in order to force water and other fluids to take on specific shapes. This is employed to maintain its own shape during its activity periods and to cause massive tidal waves and anomalous oceanic activity. The seismic activity induced by SCP-4568-1 disrupts these abilities, making SCP-4568-2 unable to maintain a consistent form out of water and forcing it into periods of dormancy.##\n\n**Addendum 4568-1:** Containment/Neutralization Proposal\n\n[NO CHANGES. INFORMATION COLLAPSED]\n\n//**Note:** No further proposals of this type are to be accepted.//\n\n**Addendum 4568-2:** Log of statements by SCP-4568-1 and -2\n\nAfter the detection of SCP-4568-2 on February 2010, both entities have been communicating with each other and Foundation personnel using similar methods to the one used by SCP-4568-1 during the aforementioned incident. These messages show awareness of the existence of several Groups and Entities of Interest, mainly in connection with K-Class Scenarios.
