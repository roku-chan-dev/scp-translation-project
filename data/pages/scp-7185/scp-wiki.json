Accordingly, a 5-meter tall chain-link fence has been erected from an exactly 15-kilometer radius of SCP-7185. The fence is to be checked weekly for damage, at which point if damage is located it is to be repaired. Any geographical mentions of the abandoned settlement of Beard, Oregon, United States, have been removed from maps. Public satellite imagery has been altered to exclude Beard, and the road leading to the town has been relabeled as private property.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7185 is an unidentified machine located within an abandoned factory in the Southern Cascadian Mountain Range, Oregon, United States. SCP-7185 is not connected to any exterior power or piping, but maintains three levers that control its operations. If both black-tipped levers are switched down, and a currently rusted-over lever is pulled, SCP-7185 will produce a green liquid dubbed SCP-7185-1. \n\nSCP-7185-1 is an alcoholic beverage with a semi-viscous consistency, which when ingested, will result in a series of changes to subjects bodies over the span of a several-week-spanning period which will result in the bodily mutation and deformation of subjects. SCP-7185-1 works to successfully degrade the effectiveness of depressants, opiates, and stimulants following an extended period post-ingestion. These changes will vary on a case-by-case basis, and inevitably result in the subjects expiration. Following the expiration of subjects, the anomalous cause of their deaths will cease manifesting.\n\n-----\n\n**Discovery:** On July 18th, 2014, numerous reports were made to park rangers of an entity emerging from the treeline at Crater Lake National Park and attacking civilians. Foundation agents embedded for the containment of [[[SCP-3310]]] discredited the rumors as a case of mass hysteria, and subsequently detained witnessing civilians prior to their amnesticization and release. A search effort began for the entity lasting 2-hours, at which point the entity was recovered. A subsequent analysis concluded that the entity was a civilian known as \"Zach Hermann\", at which point Hermann was transferred to a nearby Foundation outpost at [[[SCP-3462]]], Oregon, United States, for emergency surgery. \n\nHermann's body had been fully covered in growths of //Kindbergia Oregana//[[footnote]] \"Oregon Beaked Moss\" [[/footnote]] and numerous unidentified root growths across his skin and internal organs. After approximately 18-hours of contiguous surgery, it was deemed infeasible to remove all of the growths at the time with the given resources. As such, primary surgical efforts were focused on the removal of growths concentrated around Hermann's eyes, nostrils, ear canals, and throat. After a further 7-hours of surgery, minor progress was made at which point Hermann was transferred to Site-56 for a further surgery to be hypothesized and implemented, along with interviewing Hermann as to the origin of the anomaly that occurred in his physical person.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Interview Log-7185-1**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Charlie Kanley\n\n**Interviewee:** Zach Hermann\n\n-----\n\n//Hermann is situated on a medical bed in a private room. Kanley sits in a seat adjacent to the bed.//\n\n**Kanley:** Greetings, Mr. Hermann. Are you able to speak at the moment?\n\n//Hermann moves his mouth slowly and begins speaking in a raspy voice.//\n\n**Hermann:** Yes.\n\n**Kanley:** Great. Now, we found you at Crater Lake with some pretty serious injuries that most people wouldn't survive, any clue as to which part of Crater Lake this happened to you?\n\n**Hermann:** North.\n\n**Kanley:** The north side of the park?\n\n**Hermann:** No. North of the park.\n\n**Kanley:** By where? \n\n**Hermann:** Oakridge.\n\n**Kanley:** Pretty far from here. Why did you walk all the way down to Crater Lake?\n\n//Hermann coughs.//\n\n**Hermann:** The roots grew over my eyes. I didn't know where I was going after Kellen died.\n\n**Kanley:** And who exactly is this \"Kellen\" person?\n\n**Hermann:** My husband.\n\n**Kanley:** Did Kellen additionally suffer from similar symptoms as your own? \n\n**Hermann:** Yes.\n\n**Kanley:** Alright, was this exactly in Oakridge, or at a location nearby? How do you get to where this happened to you?\n\n**Hermann:** Ride down to Hills Creek Lake, and follow Hills Creek Road south until you see a sign saying \"Beard\" and a road by the sign.\n\n**Kanley:** Is that a town?\n\n**Hermann:** Abandoned.\n\n**Kanley:** Then whatever caused this is in Beard?\n\n**Hermann:** Yes.\n\n**Kanley:** Anyone else besides you and your expired husband involved?\n\n**Hermann:** Yes. Azrael, Mark, and Angel. We also had Caleb, but he isn't alive anymore.\n\n**Kanley:** Ok. We will attempt to remove other growths within the next few hours.\n\n**Hermann:** The anesthesia does not work.\n\n**Kanley:** Pardon?\n\n**Hermann:** I felt everything that happened during the surgery.\n\n**Kanley:** We will attempt to discern why that is happening. But regardless, we need to proceed with the surgery to ensure that you are in healthy condition.\n\n//Kanley stands out of her chair.//\n\n**Kanley:** And of course, to make sure you are able to give us another interview tomorrow.\n\n//Kanley laughs at her joke and walks out of the room. Hermann remains silent and looks down, clutching his head in his hands.//\n\n**Hermann:** Why'd I give them that fucking drink?\n\n-----\n\n**Closing Summary:** A team has been dispatched to Beard, Oregon, United States, for the recovery of a potentially anomalous object and any civilians at risk of destroying the veil. Hermann is to remain under medical analysis as surgeries progress for the monitoring of future growths within his anatomy. After successful surgeries are implemented, Hermann is to remain in Foundation custody until further interviews can discern as much useful information regarding the potential anomaly as possible.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFoundation Agents noticed difficulty in traversing the path to the town due to both the poor state of infrastructure leading to the town, and the conflicting series of roads leading to separate abandoned properties on the outskirts of the town through the woods. At 17:29, PDT, Agents arrived at the town center and searched the surrounding area, at which point at 17:41, PDT, Agents located a factory containing approximately 3 expired human bodies, and several green jars of what was later determined to be SCP-7185-1. Outside of the factory, a shallow grave was discovered in which a fourth expired body was located.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n++ **Interview Log-7185-2**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Researcher Charlie Kanley\n\n**Interviewee:** Zach Hermann\n\n-----\n\n**Kanley:** Greetings, Mr. Hermann. Are you feeling any better?\n\n**Hermann:** Doesn't hurt to talk as much.\n\n**Kanley:** Good. I take it the surgeries have gone well despite the complication.\n\n**Hermann:** Yes they have. Except for the itty bitty thing that I feel your surgeons digging through me.\n\n//Both are silent for several seconds.//\n\n**Kanley:** Well, we found Beard, and have secured the area. Now need to ask you some more specific questions about the anomaly.\n\n**Hermann:** Are they safe?\n\n**Kanley:** Who?\n\n**Hermann:** My friends. Did you fucking find them?\n\n**Kanley:** No. A search is currently underway.[[footnote]] A tactic utilized to not introduce unreliable, emotional complications to Hermann's testimony. [[/footnote]]\n\n//Hermann looks down and sighs.//\n\n**Hermann:** Good. They have to be alive. This shouldn't have happened to Kellen for nothing.\n\n**Kanley:** Agents have found multiple samples of a green liquid. Is this the drink you were referring to?\n\n**Hermann:** Yeah. Angel found a journal that said it was some sort of alcohol the owners of the factory gave to their workers in the '30's. Only stopped using it after workers kept getting drunk, or something like that.\n\n**Kanley:** Why did you choose to ingest it?\n\n**Hermann:** It was all my fault. I thought we could get our hands on some beer for free. We only got supplies once a month, and they never gave us anything for our downtime.\n\n**Kanley:** Supplies for what?\n\n**Hermann:** An abandoned town has a lot of shit we can sell. Some guy hired us out to scavenge through anything of value in the town then we would sell it later. \n\n**Kanley:** Know what his name was?\n\n**Hermann:** Sean. \n\n**Kanley:** I meant his specific name.\n\n**Hermann:** He just put an ad up on Craigslist.\n\n**Kanley:** Alright. Can you provide a description of the machine that produced the liquid?\n\n**Hermann:** It's blue. It also has a little wooden box with a nozzle that pours the drink. If you pull the levers it dispenses the liquid.\n\n**Kanley:** Ok. Do you-\n\n//A transmission is sent to Kanley through her earpiece.//\n\n**Kanley:** Excuse me for a second.\n\n//Kanley leaves the room. The interview is subsequently ceased.//\n\n-----\n\n**Closing Summary:** Agents positioned within proximity of SCP-7185 were ordered to determine and isolate SCP-7185. Further questions are to be decided upon, and Hermann is to be interrogated again for any further knowledge he has regarding SCP-7185, and the effects of SCP-7185-1.\n\nResearcher Kanley is to be formally commended for her ingenuity in not informing Hermann of the ceased life functions of his associates. Tracking efforts through \"Sean's\" craigslist account have begun to discern his exact location.\n[[/div]]\n\nDue to the outdated and un-maintained infrastructure surrounding SCP-7185, renovations were ordered to further ease containment and allow for the establishment of wireless communication with personnel at SCP-7185. Shortly following the conclusion of Interview Log-7185-2, Mobile Task Force Alpha-1 was dispatched to SCP-7185 due to the severe credible threat of a Chaos Insurgency raid on the facilities. All other personnel were sent away from SCP-7185 for their personal safety. It was deemed safe for standard personnel to re-enter the facility after 14-hours had passed. In which, numerous firefights were reported to have occurred, ultimately concluding in the members of the Chaos Insurgency being driven away from SCP-7185 while sustaining major casualties. Alpha-1 remained on location to ensure the peaceful collection of information regarding SCP-7185.\n\nAlpha-1 would transfer control over a journal found nearby to the expired bodies found in proximity to SCP-7185. The journal was in a state of severe damage due to the conditions it was kept in until its discovery, as such, entries within the journal were divided into three differing sections based on their condition.\n\n++++ 1. Readable condition.\n++++ 2. Barely discernible condition.\n++++ 3.

Just us all feeling aches around our bodies.\n\n**Kanley:** When did specific anomalous symptoms occur within all of you?\n\n**Hermann:** A few days after that, there were just weird things we started feeling. Caleb got a really bad fever, I felt a tightness in my chest, and Mark's hair just started falling out. Same with Angel.\n\n**Kanley:** So 7185-1's effects varied?\n\n**Hermann:** Yes.\n\n**Kanley:** What were the end results of everyone's symptoms?\n\n**Hermann:** I don't know. The only one that got bad was Caleb's.\n\n**Kanley:** And what were Caleb's symptoms? \n\n**Hermann:** After his hair was gone, his skin started peeling. It was very red. Then one night, he ran out screaming on fire. We tried to pour water on him, but he just kept fucking catching on fire. Even would be a few minutes when we thought he was out, then have him catch again.\n\n**Kanley:** Forgive me if I am mistaken, but is there not a creek that runs through the settlement? Could you not simply submerge him in there?\n\n**Hermann:** We tried to. It didn't do shit, and his skin started forming massive blisters which just kept popping. We couldn't even keep him submerged since he was constantly coming up to breathe, only for the fire to relight the second he went above the water.\n\n**Kanley:** And when did Caleb finally expire?\n\n**Hermann:** I don't know. It was morning when he stopped burning. \n\n**Kanley:** Where is his body?\n\n**Hermann:** Buried him by the factory. \n\n**Kanley:** Then you were forcibly removed from the town?

Expired bodies discovered close to SCP-7185 are to be transferred to the proper facilities for their required autopsies in order to extract relevant information. A fourth interview was scheduled for the next day following another series of surgeries to remove further growths from Hermann's anatomy. \n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe location of Sean was revealed shortly following the recovery of the journal entry, and Sean's identity was confirmed to be \"Sean MacDougall\". Agents were promptly dispatched to MacDougall's location, at which point he was detained and interrogated. No valuable information was recovered in the interrogation, as such, MacDougall was amnesticized and released. Saved information regarding the location of Beard, or referencing any victims of SCP-7185-1 were removed from MacDougall's personal devices. Money held by MacDougall prior amounting to roughly $46,000 USD were seized from MacDougall's financial assets to conceal any traces of money gained from scavenging within Beard. The new money gained was promptly used to help finance the containment of SCP-7185.\n\nFollowing initial recovery efforts, sections of journal entries in \"Barely Discernible Condition\" were recovered, although minor water damage was present along numerous sections of the entries, causing small amounts of information to be unrecoverable.\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ **__Barely-Discernible Condition Entries__**\n\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 125%]]\nWhat just happened?\n@@ @@\nMark just fucking died.

It was around 2 weeks or so.\n\n**Kanley:** How did Kellen expire?\n\n**Hermann:** He was shitting and vomiting glass and metal. \n\n**Kanley:** Metal chunks emerged from Kellen's anatomy?\n\n**Hermann:** Yeah, and a ton of blood too.\n\n//Hermann violently coughs for 12 seconds while reaching for the water cup, even though it is empty.//\n\n**Kanley:** How did he die?\n\n**Hermann:** I don't know. The roots grew over my eyes so I couldn't see him, or anything. He was navigating me around and I just assumed he wasn't doing that bad. Then one day he collapsed.\n\n**Kanley:** Was he dead immediately?\n\n**Hermann:** No. I still heard him, so I tried to find him. When I did I just sat down with him. I don't know why, but-\n\n//Hermann coughs.//\n\n**Hermann:** I needed to be there when he died. I couldn't leave him.\n\n**Kanley:** When did you leave him?\n\n**Hermann:** After a few hours I couldn't hear him breathing, and knew he was dead. So I got up and walked by myself until I heard a car horn honking.\n\n**Kanley:** Did you find these cars?\n\n**Hermann:** No. I ran towards the source until it was gone, then I kept going until I heard some screams. Then you guys found me.\n\n**Kanley:** Alright. We will attempt to locate your friends from this. We will keep you posted, and attempt to resolve the anesthesia issue post-surgery.\n\n-----\n\n**Closing notes:** This interview has been largely unsuccessful in discerning the location of Anderson's corpse.

May you survive this.[[/size]]\n\nIt's been a few hours since you left. Hopefully, your refusal to leave my side until then won't end your chances. Mine are over, but you still have a chance to make it. You __**will**__ make it. I know you will.\n\nThe stars are so beautiful tonight. I don't think we've had much of a chance over the last few weeks to look at them. Always pushing to find civilization faster. You've been so busy trying to push through despite the plants growing faster. If you ever see this, know that none of this was your fault, and I will never blame you for it. It wasn't even a mistake you made, we all decided to go along with it. Azrael is wrong for kicking you out. But do not hate him, he did what he thought was right, even though he was not. \n\nJust find out who made it. Bring them to justice for all of us, bring them to justice for Caleb, bring them to justice for me. Find who Sigmund Carr-Payton is, and why they made the factory. Find why they made __it__. That is all I want you to do. That is what we all __need__ you to do. \n\nThe past few hours were the most beautiful time in my life. Cuddling with you on a cool night, gazing upon the stars, knowing this is it, but staying together nevertheless. Even though I do not wish it to be, I am content with this being my last memory. I would always choose to go into the woods with you again, so you may make it even if I will not.\n\nThe clouds are about to cover the stars now. I will take a break from writing so I can gaze upon them one last time.\n\nGoodbye, my love.\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 75%]] Kellen[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nD-Class testing utilizing SCP-7185-1 has been indefinitely postponed following a joint consensus by both the O5 council and the Ethics Committee.
