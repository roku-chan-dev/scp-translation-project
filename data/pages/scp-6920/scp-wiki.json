SCP-6920-1 is currently under constant watch by a surveillance system ran and supervised by Shamus.aic[[footnote]]Foundation AIC unit currently assigned to Site-16. [[/footnote]]. --The systems have been fitted with ectovision lenses capable of viewing the spectral entities roaming the location of SCP-6920-1 when said entities do not make themselves visible.-- See updated procedures. \n\n**Updated Procedures:** Director Deacon[[footnote]] Director of the Department of Paracrime.[[/footnote]] was allowed to put SCP-6920-A, -B, and -C under protective custody of the Foundation in light of Incident-6920-01, and all three entities have been moved to Site-16. They are currently kept inside Incorporeal Humanoid Holding Chambers, in Cell block 13 on Sublevel 04. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6920 designates 23 light-green bottles containing an anomalous alcoholic beverage sold under the name \"Ectoplashine\". All SCP-6920 instances currently exhibit a teal-colored luminescence, and continuously exhibit this effect until less than 15% of the substance is left inside the bottle or the 15% is poured out. \n\nTo date, attempting to test for any other ingredients used in SCP-6920 has yielded no results. \n\n[[include component:image-block | name=bottles.jpg | caption=Currently contained instances of SCP-6920. | width=10%]]\n\nUpon consuming any amount of SCP-6920, the following effects will take place;\n\n* Extremely dilated pupils.\n* Green tinted vision.\n* Translucent abdominal area.\n* Green and illuminated saliva.\n\nMost notably, however, is the ability to view spectral, incorporeal, and intangible entities that may have previously appeared invisible to them. This state lasts for a total of one hour and fifteen minutes, after which subjects will revert to their normal appearances and lose the previously mentioned ability. The effects will take place upon consuming SCP-6920 again. \n\nSCP-6920-1 is the location where SCP-6920 was manufactured and where entities -A through -D were found. The location exhibits no anomalous phenomenon. See the **History** section for more information.\n\nSCP-6920-A, -B, -C, and -D are spectral humanoid entities who all previously worked for GoI-0019[[footnote]]  \"Syndicate of 85\", known paracriminal organization and business rival of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chicago-spirit | GoI-001 (\"Chicago Spirit\")]]] [[/footnote]] in different states. They are intangible, capable of manifesting and demanifesting at will, and are capable of freely moving through most physical objects. They are able to levitate, however all four appear to prefer to \"walk\". \n\n**History:** SCP-6920-1 is an abandoned wooden shack located in the northeastern plains of Kansas, built near the Oregon Trail sometime in the 1820s. The shack reportedly served as both the residential home of the Echeverría family and, primarily during the 1830s, as a stopping point for travelers walking the trail. The home was abandoned in 1858 when the last remaining member of the Echeverría family died of a heart attack.\n\nDuring the 1910s, GoI-0019 came into possession of SCP-6920-1 and served as a standard moonshining operation from 1921 to 1922. During these years, a known eight to nine members of GoI-0019 worked to manufacture types of antique alcohol, which were promised to be \"entirely original and foreign\". In mid-1923, multiple deaths occurred during a brief moment of infighting. For an unknown reason, four of the members returned as translucent, intangible entities, and started to produce SCP-6920. SCP-6920 was sold throughout the 1920s in various speakeasy locations around the United States, primarily in the states of Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri, Iowa, and Illinois[[footnote]] There was notable resistance from GoI-001 to prevent the selling of SCP-6920 in Illinois, primarily in Chicago. [[/footnote]]. Despite this, the sell of SCP-6920 was almost entirely located in Kansas itself. The location eventually attracted the attention of other members of GoI-0019, and it was once more put into their possession and back into business.\n\nIn 1930, through unknown sources, the location was identified by agents of the Bureau of Prohibition and was subsequently raided then shut down. Approximately nine members of GoI-0019 were arrested, however SCP-6920-A through -D were not detained as they remained invisible to the bureau agents. According to the spectral entities, the entities had passed the time by playing cards and learning various instruments. It is assumed that due to the recent rise of paracriminal activity in the United States since 1998, the entities attempted to restore their business, which led to their discovery by Foundation agents. \n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6920 and SCP-6920-1 came to the Foundations attention in late 1999, where reports of \"glowing green jugs\" appearing in various locations around Kansas City and other neighboring cities and towns started to gain traction among the local media. Instances were acquired and witnesses were amnesticized while Foundation Field Agents were ordered to investigate further, where they discovered that the entities had started manufacturing SCP-6920 instances again in light of the recent rise of paracriminal activity in the area. The operation was shut down again, and SCP-6920-A through -D were successfully contained within the perimeters of SCP-6920-1. \n\nBelow is all the relevant information on SCP-6920-A through -D. \n\n= [[collapsible show=\"[SCP-6920-A through -D Profiles]\" hide=\"[Close]\"]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab 6920-A]]\n--------\n[[include component:image-block | name=john.jpg | caption= 6920-A, Circa 1919.| width=10%]]\n**Name:** John Jacob Burke \n\n**Date of Birth:** Unspecified, 1880\n\n**Date of Death:** July 16th, 1923\n\n**Physical Description:** African American male, aged 43. Bald. Wears a three piece suit with dress pants and polished black boots. Often seen smoking a pipe or attempting to play a harmonica when manifested. Often seen manifesting in one of the living room chairs inside SCP-6920-1. \n\n**Overview:** Became affiliated with GoI-0019 in the state of Georgia as a broker for black market trade in 1917 under the promise that they would be protected from KKK activists in the area. Worked as a broker in the area until 1919 where they were relocated to Kansas to sell and advertise rare moonshine and other various forms of antique alcoholic beverages to local crime gangs and speakeasy's in the area. Reportedly became close friends with the [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_crime_family | DiGiovanni brothers, John Lazia, and Tom Pendergast]]][[footnote]] All high ranking members of the Kansas City Mafia and the Pendergast Machine crime groups, respectively. [[/footnote]] and secured GoI-0019 a foothold in local criminal activities in Kansas City. After 1923, SCP-6920-A lost any and all previous connections in Kansas, and worked primarily for GoI-0019 until 1930.\n------------\n> = **Interview 6920-A: 11/05/99**\n> -----------\n>> [BEGIN LOG] \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Hello, 6920-A. How has your day been?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Good. And please, call me Burke.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Very well then, Mr. Burke[[footnote]] From this moment forward, Dr. Thorpe was given permission to refer to the entities by their given names for the purpose of information extraction.[[/footnote]]. I'm Dr. Thorpe, and I'm here to interview you on a few things, particularly your time with an organization we know as GoI-0019.\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** What, the Machine? \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** No. I'm referring to the other crime syndicate you once worked for.\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Oh, yeah. Them. Why?\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** It's just what we need to know. And being cooperative could yield for some better living standards.\n>> \n>> //<SCP-6920-A sniffs the air, recoils, then nods.>//\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** I haven't seen anyone else from them in years. Whatever I know is probably worthless.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Lucky for you, that's what we need. We need to know about your decision to work almost exclusively in Kansas, and with the Machine.\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** That's a bit of a tricky one to answer. For one, it was just easy enough to weasel our way in with the local mafia and the Machine. I talked to everyone, see? I got us customers, then acquaintances, then colleagues, then opportunities, and then close friends. I could sweet talk a kid into giving me his lollipop. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** But why not start business in some of the hotspots during that time? Like Chicago or New York?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Well, we did. To an extent. We had smugglers going back and fourth between some of the nearby states and cities, including Chicago. We weren't big, small even, but we were noticeable. We sold antiquities that no one else had, the ingredients and instructions supplied to us from outside Kansas. But that was before '23.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Before you died?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Yeah. We started making Ectoplashine after that, some real good shit that legitimately no one else had. Oh, how I miss those days. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Our records show your connections with the Machine fell after that incident. Any reason why?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Easy. Pendergast, and I quote, didn't think \"weird shit\" was gonna be as profitable as it is. It was the only one of the two setbacks we really ever had.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** So then, let me ask again, why not Chicago?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** That brings me to our next setback. You don't think we tried to get into Chicago? Some of us already knew about Chappell and the Spirit, we knew what went on in Chicago. And for us that knew, it was out of our league. Well, mostly.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Mostly?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Some Renegades[[footnote]] A Syndicate specific term for rouge members. [[/footnote]] stole some stashes of our good shit and tried to sell it out in Chicago and Manhattan. Chappell didn't like that, so he made sure we stayed out of that city. Hell, the whole damn state was made off limits. We just weren't ready for a competition like that, not with a bunch of hotheads like the Spirit. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Is that all? No other particular reason?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Well, from what I heard, our boss's boss didn't have a good relationship with Chappell either. I heard he did something wrong, something stupid. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** And what can you tell me about him?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-A:** Nothing. Sorry, but I don't know a damn thing about him besides that he messed up bad.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Well, that's unfortunate. But anyhow, thank for your time Mr. Burke.

SCP-6920-B in particular was reassigned to SCP-6920-1 in 1921 for unspecified reasons, but their experience as a Mapper allowed them to become an integral part of the small operation. After their death in 1923, SCP-6920-B continued to serve as a Mapper until the operation was officially shut down in 1930.

Black slicked back hair. Wore a hat with a variety of other clothing, oftentimes mismatched. Previously manifested in the basement of SCP-6920-1, where he would smoke cigars and listen to a nearby record player. \n\n**Overview:** SCP-6920-D was the previous head of the of the SCP-6920-1 operation and liaison between the members of the operation and the individual known as \"B\". Their position of leadership, however ,had been disputed between all four entities for years. SCP-6920-D reportedly started the business by themselves in 1916, but garnered the attention of the individual known as \"B\" and was offered a place in GoI-0019.

Firstly, \"B\" was a she, and her name was Jane Carter, but some of us- including me- called her J.C.

Long ass name, and everyone I knew shortened it to Underworld instead. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** And when was this?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-D:** Before '23, that's what they went by. After that, well...there was something of a decline between then and now, with 'now' more specifically meaning back in '39. Right after the Spirit fell. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** Interesting. We'll come back to this, but I have another question for you. The other two have mentioned that your boss had a boss as well. Mr. Burke said he and Richard Chappell did not have a good relationship. I'd like to know what happened, and out of the three, you seem to know. \n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-D:** That's actually a pretty funny story. See, it started out as a rumor one day back in 1920. \"Oh, someone crossed Chappell\", \"Hey, you guys are screwed, the Spirit is coming\", shit like that. So I ask J.C. what the fuck is going on, right? But she's got this absolutely piss-your-pants scared look on her face and she's panicking, trying to get some shit packed in a bag. She tells me, \"He fucked up bad this time, Chappell is chasing us out of Chicago, and he's coming for the rest of us in the states. Brick and Kat are already dead. I'm leaving.\" \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** I don't suppose she went into any further detail?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-D:** Something about the boss knowing about [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/black-as-night | someone]]] or something that he wasn't supposed to know. But that was it. That was the last time I saw her. It's funny because, in the end, Chappell never came for anyone else.\n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** And what did your boss do?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-D:** I don't know what he did to set off Chappell, but it was enough to the point that he got scared and fled the country. And when he did decide to make himself relevant again, I'm pretty sure he didn't even know we were out here. We didn't hear anything about it 'till '99, and that's when you guys swooped in. \n>> \n>> **Dr. Thorpe:** I can assume you don't know much on this individual, then?\n>> \n>> **SCP-6920-D:** Well, not exactly.

This isn't a new room. Where's my new room?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** He promised you a new room?\n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** The request is going through, we're a very busy department[[footnote]] Dr. Thorpe has made no such request. [[/footnote]].\n> \n> **SCP-6920-C:** //<Without looking up from their newspaper>// Hurry and ask question then.\n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** The first I'll ask is what happened on July 16th, 1923?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** We had a disagreement. Then a shootout. We died. We came back. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** Not that we know why, we just are. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Yes, yes, I understand //that//. I mean, what was the disagreement? What was it that actually happened?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** Well it was...huh. I can't remember. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** Really? We had an argument over...well, fuck me. I don't know either.\n> \n> **SCP-6920-C:** I don't remember either.\n> \n> //<SCP-6920-D sighs loudly.>//\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** That was the day we all learned that the big man had left the Underworld. Which meant two things to us. Those who would keep following him, and those who would try other places. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** And you all shot each other over it?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** Well, kind of. Us four decided to try and find opportunities somewhere else, but Jimmie, Linda, Martha, and Henry decided against us. They wanted to go out and find him, but the rest of us knew that wherever that was, Chappell was already there. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** I can remember it now, yeah. Yeah, Jim punched me when I tried to leave, shouted something about us droppin' the dime[[footnote]] Term used to refer to someone giving out information about someone else's unlawful activities, normally to local authorities. [[/footnote]]. Which was, of course, untrue. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** And then our fight ended with a draw. All of us had a shooter on us, even Liu had one. Doesn't seem to have mattered, though. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Then...where are the other four ghosts?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-C:** Only ever us. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** Liu is right. To our knowledge, we were the only four who came back.\n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Hm. Well, I suppose that's a satisfactory answer.\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** We aim to please. Now, your second question? What was it?\n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Right. Well, we'd like to know how you managed to make SCP- //<Pauses>// Ectoplashine. \n> \n> //<Silence for twenty seconds.>//\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** No. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** I mean, come on. Does it even matter anymore?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** I said no! \n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** And who put you in charge?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** The boss did!\n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** Boss ain't around no more! \n> \n> **SCP-6920-B:** Jeremy, it's been seventy years. No one even remembers us anymore. \n> \n> **SCP-6920-A:** And if they did, they would've gotten to us earlier. \n> \n> //<Silence for another ten seconds.>//\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** //<Sighs>// Fine, okay. Whatever. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Good. Then, would you mind explaining?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** Well, let's get this straight. I lied. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** About what?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** Just hold on, doc. There were eight of us. Eight of us died. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Yes. And?\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** And the main ingredient in Ectoplashine is, of course, ectoplasm. \n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** As we understand it, yes. How is this-\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** //<Interrupts>// There used to be eight ghosts, too. \n> \n> //<Silence for one minute.>//\n> \n> **Dr. Thorpe:** Oh.\n> \n> **SCP-6920-D:** Yeah. \"Oh\". \n> \n> [END LOG]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum:** Incident-6920-01\nOn 08/08/02, all cameras within SCP-6920-1 suddenly ceased functionality. Attempts to contact the guards that were, at the time, stationed at SCP-6920-1 failed. Agents from Mobile Task Force [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5685| Mu-13 (\"Ghostbusters\")]]] and a team from [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6580 | Liaison-5 (\"The Hawkshaws\")]]] were able to report to the location approximately two hours after the camera feeds cut off, which had been restored thirty minutes after ceasing function.\n\nUpon reaching the destination, the guards that had been stationed at the location had been killed via gunshots to the head. Upon entering SCP-6920-1, all agents found SCP-6920-A, -B, and -C gathered around a puddle of ectoplasm in the basement. Entities claimed they heard SCP-6920-D yelling, followed by a gunshot, but did not hear any previous gunshots. Among the pile was a piece of paper akin to a calling card, the text of which as been transcribed below.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[Open Transcript]\" hide=\"[Close]\"]]\n> Let this serve an example to the rest of you ghost fuckers.\n> \n> No one talks shit about me and gets away with it.\n> \n> Not even the dead.\n> \n> - The Albino Man[[footnote]] Known to the Foundation as PoI-0023. [[/footnote]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\nShortly thereafter, SCP-6920-A through -C were then transferred to Site-16 and have been placed under protective custody by the Foundation. Further interviews found entities -A through -C had forgotten all knowledge on the existence of PoI-0023, although remember that SCP-6920-D had been murdered. \n\nAs of 2002 there has been no activity from SCP-6920-1 since the incident, and no other SCP-6920 instances have been found. Surveillance of the location, however, has continued. An investigation concerning the reappearance of SCP-6920-A through -D inside SCP-6920-1 has been, until further activity from the location has been detected, postponed. \n\n**Addendum:** On 08/17/02, the transcript was moved to the office of Dr. Montgomery[[footnote]] Head of Operations within the DoP. [[/footnote]] as part of the renewed investigation efforts against PoI-0023.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6919]]] | SCP-6920 | [[[SCP-6921]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
