The location of Area-**##22a400|VATHEK##** is known only to the Administrator, three members of the O5 Council,  and personnel stationed at Area-**##22a400|VATHEK##** itself. All communication with Foundation staff and Area-**##22a400|VATHEK##** is to be conducted remotely. The entirety of Specialized Task Force Odal-49 \"Morkanabad\" has been stationed at Area-**##22a400|VATHEK##** for security purposes. Before viewing, all information collected from SCP-**##22a400|VATHEK##** is to be scrubbed of cognitohazardous and/or infohazardous material by CARATHIS.AIC.\n\nThe collection efforts that began 2/20/2024 are to continue indefinitely. However, due to a string of erratic behavior from 12/20/2032, **##22a400|VATHEK##**'s round-the-clock monitoring and security efforts are to be redoubled. \n\nTo further ensure cooperation, Area-**##22a400|VATHEK##** is to be restocked daily with a supply of no fewer than 200 lemons.\n\n**Description:** SCP-**##22a400|VATHEK##** is a biologically immortal humanoid that answers to the name \"James Hagopian.\" Subject takes the form of a man of Armenian descent between the ages of 25-30.\n\n**##22a400|VATHEK##** is capable of psychic communication with SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##**. SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##** is an extradimensional consciousness that has at one point existed within SCP-8702[[footnote]](Object class: Unknown. A pocket dimension located in a dentist's office in Evanston, IL. The entryway disappeared for unknown reasons as of 1/1/2025.)[[/footnote]]. The nature, appearance, origin, and current location of **##cc0000|THESEUS##** are all unknown. All other information about SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##** has been gleaned from **##22a400|VATHEK##**'s secondary accounts. **##22a400|VATHEK##** has purported that SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##** visits other dimensions to study them.\n\nBefore he gained his anomalous abilities, **##22a400|VATHEK##**'s left forearm was crushed and severed by the floor and ceiling of SCP-8702. His amputated forearm regenerated a week later. This tissue could imitate various shapes and textures, but this behavior has not been observed since March of 2028.\n\nAccording to **##22a400|VATHEK##**, the severance and replacement of his arm was how he became \"anointed\" as SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##**'s \"prophet\". In exchange for learning more about our iteration of Earth, SCP-**##cc0000|THESEUS##** has offered to share the wisdom it has collected from other worlds, using **##22a400|VATHEK##** as a communication medium.\n\nWhen **##cc0000|THESEUS##** makes direct psychic contact with **##22a400|VATHEK##** for this purpose, his body trembles uncontrollably and he emits powdered calcium carbonate from his pores. This has been referred to as an Oracle State by containment staff. (Documents provided from Oracle States have been given the OS prefix.)\n\nAll feasibly testable information provided from **##22a400|VATHEK##**'s Oracle States has been confirmed. In this way, **##22a400|VATHEK##** has led to astronomically important advancements in Foundation scientific and logistical operations -- including, but not limited to:\n\n* The decommissioning of [[[SCP-2317]]]-K, [[[SCP-231]]]-7, and other immediately dangerous anomalies connected to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cotsk-hub GoI-586].\n* Hyper-expansion of the Foundation's budget through the reproduction and sale of [[[SCP-500]]]-EX[[footnote]](OS-481ARX described the recipe for SCP-500 -- which not only made reproduction possible, but revealed that the drug in question was //technically// non-anomalous, thereby allowing its sale to not conflict with the Foundation's mission statement.)[[/footnote]] to the public, establishing Seacrest Pharmaceuticals as the Foundation's first Fortune 500 front company.\n* Development of a working perpetual motion engine.\n* Invention of the parascientific concepts of RNA Compassing, Shangrilalogy, Para-Crocheting, Molecular Bigotry, Mass Radiological Emboigaly, Baldrick Geotorsion, Applied Soviet Nanomagnetism, Sun-Neutering, Cnidarian Temporal Contusion, Quantum Rudeness, Gravitational Nippling, Paxton's Foot, Paxton's Other Foot, Trumgratiation[[footnote]](Colloquially known as \"Things to Do With a Cuttlefish on a Weekend\")[[/footnote]], and Expanded Lower-Digestive Keynesianism.\n* The establishment and temporally-expedited construction of Site-EROS, a specialized containment facility located in the upper atmosphere of Venus.\n* Anomalous expansion of the mental faculties of the O5 Council.\n* Peaceful annexation of the Global Occult Coalition.\n* Development of the Brandt-Kartoffel Thaumaturgical Persuasion Technique.\n* Peaceful annexation of 7 of the 14 countries on the Operational Liability Charter into a geopolitical Foundation front known as Foundatia.\n* Usage of the Brandt-Kartoffel Thaumaturgical Persuasion Technique on the Ethics Committee to allow the previous list item to continue unimpeded.\n* Foundatia's historic victory in the 2037 FIFA World Cup.\n* Complete global nuclear disarmament through the use of the Brandt-Kartoffel Thaumaturgical Persuasion Technique.\n* Creation of the Pax Aeternam Nuclear Vault to store and dismantle all relinquished nuclear weapons.\n* Annexation of the Pax Aeternam Nuclear Vault.\n* The addition of five onsite nuclear warheads to each Foundation site.\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #cc0000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n**Interview Log** \n**Interviewer:** Dr. Astarte Fleck, Director of Site-**##22a400|VATHEK##**\n**Interviewed:** **##22a400|VATHEK##**\n**Date:** 2/20/2043\n**Time:** 12:00 PM â–ˆST\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n//[**##22a400|VATHEK##** shivers in his seat.
