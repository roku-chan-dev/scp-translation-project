Phased out in 1841; analogous to Keter.[[/span]]\n\n**Containment Steps**: \n\n**Guard Protocol**: Due to the nature of SCP-B74B70, detainment of -C, and -D is currently considered a //Medium// priority. \n\nAction Team Rho-4 is to monitor the location of SCP-B74B70-A and is to report any changes noted in its appearance or location to the acting HMCL supervisor. Should -B leave -A, Action Team Rho-4 is to track its flight path carefully and attempt to decommission -B. Detainment of -C and -D will be enacted at Commander Roger's discretion.\n\n**Maintanence Protocol**: None.\n\n**Description**: SCP-B74B70 is composed of four parts:\n\nSCP-B74B70-A is a home in the Herrirak architectural style and the ground on which it rests. It is one story high and appears to be about 3,000 square feet in area. The ground around it is markedly well-maintained, and contains a variety of vegetation not native to Pennsylvania. Further visual analysis of the island is difficult due to its Anomalous Properties.\n\nSCP-B74B70-B is a machine of unknown design that has a similar shape to birds of prey, such as the American eagle. It is about 30 feet long and possesses a wingspan of nearly 80 feet. It has been decorated with a depiction of a Nimrudian Sphinx on its tail[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Note: Unfortunately, no contemporary depictions of sphinxes from the Mesopotamian city of Nimrud survive.[[/span]] and stripes of traditional Maori patterns on its left side.\n\nSCP-B74B70-C is a man of unknown age and apparent Near Eastern, likely Mesopotamian, descent. SCP-B74B70-D is a woman of unknown age and apparent Oceanic or Polynesian descent.\n\n**Anomalous Property**: \n\nSCP-B74B70-A, both the home and the ground it rests on, levitates about 700 yards over the northernmost part of the Alleghany Mountains. It displays minor perceptual clouding[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Perceptual clouding is an antiquated term referring to antimemetics. Terminology phased out in 1899.[[/span]] which prevents those unaware of magick[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Note: An archaic term referring to reality-manipulation. Phased out in 1899; it is now represented by specialized scientific terms dependent on subject such as Ontokinesis or Thaumaturgy.[[/span]], Ontokinectics, or general anomalous phenomena in any sense from perceiving it. No countermeasures are necessary, due to Foundation staffs’ experience with the anomalous.\n\nSCP-B74B70-B possesses the ability to propel itself through the air without relying on mechanical or physical force. It instead uses American Indian shortspells[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Note: A type of magick, wherein the magick performed is limited in temporal scope but can perform sophisticated actions.[[/span]], particularly those of the Lenape tribe, to directly manipulate its position in the air. It also uses wards[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Note: A type of magick, wherein a simple property of a given object, such as weight or color, is manipulated for as long as the ward is maintained.[[/span]] which negate its weight, allowing for high-velocity propulsion—it has been observed moving at a maximum speed of 50 miles per hour.\n\nNotably, it does not appear to have suffered from the waning of ambient American Indian magick.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]CLEARANCE LEVEL 4 DETECTED: This Waning was enacted by the Foundation from 1795 through 1820 by slow and deliberate manipulation of the Conduit to consolidate anomalous power under it and its allies control.[[/span]] It is currently theorized, as a result, that SCP-B74B70-C or -D possess direct Ontokinectic abilities or the ability to create Magick through some unknown process.\n\nSCP-B74B70-C and -D both possess the ability to propel themselves through the air at observed maximum speeds of up to 30 miles per hour. The exact mechanism behind their self-propulsion is unknown, though it is likely that it also relies on Lenape shortspells.\n\n//Update: On February 14th, 1810, SCP-B74B70-B, -C, and -D ceased any sort of flight. They have not resumed since, and have remained confined to SCP-B74B70-A. It is believed that they became aware of Action Team Rho-4’s presence through the neglect of a team member. This team member has been identified and penalized. Action Team Rho-4 has been ordered by HMCL Supervisor Persephone to remain at the location of SCP-B74B70-A.//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nArchivist’s Note: Two relevant memorandums, sent between Dr. Daniels and Site Director Mark, have been appended to further elucidate the context of File No. 2, due to its unusual nature. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Memo from Dr. Daniels, March 9th.\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**From: Researcher Dr. Daniels**\n**To: Site Director Mark Korjus**\n**Concerning: SCP-B74B70’s Containment Steps**\n**Sent: March 9th, 1810. Received: March 9th, 1810.**\n\n//Hail, Mr. Korjus.//\n\n//In order to save your time, I would like to directly state this letter’s intent: I believe the current Containment Steps for SCP-B74B70 (The floating house north of the Alleghany Mountains) are inadequate, and that proper attention has not been paid to this anomaly.//\n\n//Although communication has been attempted with SCP-B74B70-C and -D, none have yielded any acknowledgement of Foundation presence, though they doubtless are aware, at the least, of the presence of Action Team Rho-4. Given the current state of “containment” being substandard at best and completely ineffectual at worst, I am exercising my ability as SCP-B74B70’s assigned Researcher, and, with your permission, will recall Action Team Rho-4’s supervision of this SCP, and will attempt direct communication using SCP-H69B04[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Note: SCP-H69B04 and almost all of its documentation was incinerated in two unrelated incidents in 1883.[[/span]] to transport myself onto SCP-B74B70-A.//\n\n//I will attempt negotiation of the following agreement between Foundation Site-19, with I as a Site representative, and SCP-B74B70-C and -D//\n\n//1: SCP-B74B70-B may only be flown at night, and the antiperceptual ward which is applied to SCP-B74B70-A must also be applied to it.//\n\n//2: SCP-B74B70-C and -D may leave their home without fear of detainment, under the condition that at no point do they exhibit their anomalous properties less than 2 miles away from any sizable human town or city.//\n\n//It will be impressed upon them that violation of these two conditions on their end will result in full containment efforts from the Foundation, though, I believe that they will be compliant with our demands after being informed of the SCP Foundation’s mission and our reasonable Gimel Program.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Memo from Dir.

Given the demand for SCP-H69B04, however, you ſhall have to wait until March 22nd at 12PM in order to execute it. You have been allotted a time ſlot of 3 hours with SCP-H69B04; if you believe that this is not enough time, pleaſe contact me within 3 days, and I ſhall ſee if I can extend the timeſlot.\n\nFrom the desk of,\n//Mark Korjus//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab File Two: May 10th, 1810]]\n**Escape Class**: Gimel[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Phased out in 1841; refers to an SCP object which will remain uncontained due to its neutrality or benevolence, despite the Foundation theoretically possessing the capacity to contain it. No current analogue exists.[[/span]]\n\n**Containment Steps**: None are necessary at this time. If Mr. Enlil or Mrs. Rangi violate their conditional Gimel classification, they are to be detained by Action Team Rho-4 and held in the separate Units in the High Security Wind of Site-19, and held for one month. At that time, Mr. Enlil and Mrs. Rangi may then negotiate for their Containment Steps to be reconsidered.\n\n**Description**: SCP-B74B70 is composed of four parts:\n\nSCP-B74B70-A refers to both a home in the Herrirak architectural style and the 4000 square feet on which it rests. It is one story high and is about 2,800 square feet in size. The surrounding area is maintained by SCP-B74B70-D, and contains a variety of vegetation not native to Pennsylvania, which includes in no particular order:\n\n* The //Tī Kōuka// tree\n* The //Harakeke// fibre\n* The //Pōhutukawa// tree\n* Malt barley\n* The //Salakhani// pomegrante shrub\n* The fig tree\n\nSCP-B74B70-B is a winged flying machine. Its design is stylistically inspired by the native Bald Eagle. It is about 30 feet long and possesses a wingspan of 75 feet. It has been decorated with a depiction of a Nimrudian Sphinx on its tail and 2 stripes on its left side depicting the Pātiki and Puhoro traditional Māori patterns.\n\nSCP-B74B70-C is a man named Enlil Ali. He is of thirty-five (35) years and is of Mesopotamian descent. He is five (5) feet and nine (9) inches tall. \n\nSCP-B74B70-D is a woman named Rangi Harawira. She is of thirty-eight (38) years and is of Māori descent. She is five (5) feet and four (4) inches tall.\n\n**Anomalous Property**:\n\nSCP-B74B70-A, and the area on which it rests, levitate—from the pointed tip of the bottom of the island to the tip of the northernmost part of the Alleghany mountains— 750 yards into the air, with the island in the rough shape of a cone. The atmosphere at the top of this inverted cone appears to be directly adjustable by SCP-B74B70-C and -D through Lenape shortspells, and is typically at 75 degrees Fahrenheit. The nonnative vegetation grows completely independently of the climate of the island; vegetation that would normally be inhibited by a lack of sun or humidity grows as well as it would if it were in its ideal conditions. Any vegetation on the island which bears fruit or flower does so to the peak of its capability. \n\nSCP-B74B70-B possesses the ability to propel itself through the air through the advanced use of Magick, and has perception-clouding and weight-minimization wards cast upon it for the purposes of increasing flight time and increasing security. It has a reported top speed of eighty (80) miles an hour, and can fly for up to four (4) continuous hours.\n\nSCP-B74B70-C and -D are both advanced Magick users. They are, however, allied with the Foundation’s goals, and report loyalty to Site-19 leadership. They also possess the \"Innate Ability\" to propel themselves through the air at up to thirty (30) miles an hour without reliance on Magick or Ontokinetics. How they are able to do this is currently under investigation from Dr. Daniels. They are also unaware of the mechanism by which they are innately able to fly, stating simply that “[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/to-learn-to-fly We’ve both always known that we loved the sky].” and \"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/thine-eyes-as-stars-thy-name-as-air All I know is, I love her perhaps even more than the sky.]\"\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7963]]] | SCP-B74B70-ARC | [[[SCP-7965]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
