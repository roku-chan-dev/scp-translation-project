SCP-@#%&!'s effect is currently in the process of being studied so that we might do away with it.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpsandbox2.wdfiles.com/local--files/famine5/rude |\n    caption=SCP-@#%&! creates new curse words every time it speaks. |width=300px]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-@#%&! is the designation given to a very rude bird capable of producing human speech despite its anatomy suggesting it would not possess such a capability.\n\nSCP-@#%&! uses curse words almost exclusively. It is not known where SCP-@#%&! learned the words or why it chooses to use them when other words are available. \n\n**Addendum G:** A reverse image search reveals that this type of bird is a finch.\n\n**Addendum PG:** //Curse words really only have the power that we give them. I suggest the document be revised with this perspective.// -Dr. ████\n\n//███ you, try me.// — SCP-@#%&!\n\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scpsandbox2.wdfiles.com/local--files/famine5/well%20i%20never|\n    caption= It is not known if SCP-@#%&! is sapient, or is simply a biological robot that produces curse words.| width=300px]]\n\n\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin: 3px; \"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  font-weight:bold; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 5%;\"]]\nStimulus\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  font-weight:bold; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nResponse\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nHi\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  border: 1px solid black\"]]\nF███ you.[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nHow are you today?[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  border: 1px solid black\"]]\nI don't give a flying ███.[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nWell f███ you too then![[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: 5px;  border: 1px solid black\"]]\n[█████; an original curse word.

As it has not actually left Site-██ it is believed its popularity will burn itself out before too long and make re-containment viable.//\n\n\n**Addendum NC-17:** SCP-@#%&! has retired after its tie-in video game flopped harder than a dead bird off a wind turbine.\n[[=]]\n[[image nsfw]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Anonymous, faminepulse]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
