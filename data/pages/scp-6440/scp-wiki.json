SCP-6440â€™s anomalous effect is triggered when a human subject is seated in a theatre seat, causing the subject to lose all higher cognitive functions and autonomy. Subjects at this stage are designated SCP-6440-1. Any human entering SCP-6440 is greeted by SCP-6440-2, an instance of SCP-6440-1 dressed in an usher uniform, and led to a seat.\n@@ @@\n\n**Exploration Log 1:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 2018/10/09\n\n//D-54392 was sent to investigate the interior of SCP-6440.

Until I got more patrons, that is.\n\n//[Humes drop to 0.72. Melpomene-0 and Urania-0 back away from SCP-6440-2. Fibrous growths reach around the equipment. The counter now reads 0.53 Humes.]//\n\n**Urania-0:** Where is Lisa Gilbert?\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** //(laughs and gestures to an SCP-6440-1 instance behind it)// Well, she's right here!\n\n//[The SCP-6440-1 instance matches descriptions of Lisa Gilbert.]//\n\n**Melpomene-0:** //(to Urania-0)// Do we proceed with retrieval?\n\n//[Mycelium continues to grow outwards toward the operatives.]//\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** //(grins)// Bold of you to assume that you can save her. She's mine now. Or ours, rather.\n\n//[Clio-0's video feed captures thon running through the side alley. Mycelium grows in front of thon. Under thon breath Clio-0 cusses and pulls out thon knife. Cutting through the mycelium thon reaches the front of SCP-6440.]//\n\n//[SCP-6440-2 shouts as if in pain when Clio-0 cuts the mycelium.]//\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** //(doubling over)// Ouchie! Who's doing that? //(sees Clio-0 sprint past)// OH! Another patron!\n\n//[Mycelium rapidly grows and wraps around Clio-0's ankle.]//\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** -and thon is mine too!\n\n//[Clio-0 yelps and swings thon knife at the mycelium. Melpomene-0 and Urania-0 replace their guns with knifes and help Clio-0.]//\n\n//[SCP-6440-2 doubles over in pain again; the growth of mycelium slows. The operatives help Clio-0. Propping thon up, Urania-0 and Melpomene-0 sprint away from SCP-6440.]//\n\n//[Melpomene-0's video briefly records the Kant counter reading 0.19 Humes. When SCP-6440-2 regains composure the fungi spreads faster. SCP-6440-2 walks out to the middle of the road, following \"Muses\".]//\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** //(shouts)// Where are you going? The movie is about to start!\n\n//[Fungi spreads faster. SCP-6440-2 cackles. Sounds of crunching metal come from behind. Urania-0 turns around, xyr video records the Kant counter crushing as the fibers spread. The mycelium wraps around buildings and cars, carpeting the city in fibrous growth.]//\n\n//[The operatives remain silent as they run past the town's boundary and meet with Thalia-0. Faers feed captures the mycelium stopping abruptly at the town boundary and the Kant counter reads 0.99 Humes. Breathing heavily, Urania-0 radios for retrieval.]//\n\n**SCP-6440-2:** //(distantly yells)// Send more patrons soon, women in black!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n48 hours after the retrieval operation concluded Hume readings from the perimeter of Dwelling, Michigan dropped from 0.99 to 0.72 Humes.
