A lot of the time (i mean i was young then) i would just search for stuff like you know \"hot blonde\" \"busty blonde\" \"tattooed blonde\" and get a bunch of video clips like maybe 30 seconds or 1 minute, ripped from old VHS's or webcams or wherever, some professional stuff mixed in with amateur stuff, no real way of knowing where this stuff came from, I mean its amateur porn from fucking 2003.\n\n[13:38] <darthenstein> this mf into tattooed blondes\n\n[13:38] <##lime|MichaelHunt##> I WOULDNT WANNA KNOW A GUY WHO ISNT INTO TATTOOD BLONDES!\n\n[13:38] <##yellow|heroicchoice##> I prefer Redheads\n\n[13:39] <##red|StGames##> So basically I found out theres this amateur porn star using the name \"Jada Cole\" and Id been searching her and downloading tons of clips of her. definitely amateur stuff like done with a camcorder and webcam. she was unbelievable, blonde hair, maybe f cup or gcup breasts, big green eyes, and a tattoo on her chest covering like almost her whole chest of a giant eagle or falcon and its on fire. the eagle's all in black but the fire parts are red and orange.\n\n[13:39] <darthenstein> who gives a shit\n\n[13:39] <##red|StGames##> so anyway Im like, i've been loving this girl's videos for years and collecting her stuff keeping it hidden in my comp nice and safe occasionally looking back but never like actiely searching for her. like, i got a few hundred clips of her, from like 30 seconds to 30 minutes in length but i'm not like googling her name every day, you know what I mean? Like, I've got her vids, Im set, Im happy.\n\n[13:40] <##red|StGames##> So a few days ago Im thinking about her again and thinking i wonder if she's done any new stuff recently so i google her name and its like, its not a very unique name\n\n[13:40] <##white|BeerOff##> \"Jada Coles\" is a bar and nightclub in miami\n\n[13:40] <##red|StGames##> So i keep searching like whatever, there's tons of random Jada Cole people around but then get this i find a news article from 2001. March 1st, 2001 from some bumfuck burgh in tenessee its a news article about a girl who died in a car crash and they have a yearbook picture of her and its the same girl, she was an aspiring actor and stuff\n\n[13:41] <darthenstein> a local news article uses a girls fucking porn name thats legit right\n\n[13:41] <##red|StGames##> It was the same girl, same face same dimples same teeth and eyes. Someone in the comments wrote \"RIP Jada Cole\" in 2008\n\n[13:41] <##pink|TopJim##> It's not the same girl\n\n[13:41] <##red|StGames##> that's what I thought! but then is tarted doing more searching and research i tracked down the girls classmates and i asked them and they said yeah she did porn with her boyfriend at the time but it was supposed to be private just for them.\n\n[13:42] <darthenstein> who the fuck is going to tell a complet stranger \"yeah my dead best friend from high school did porn before she died, why, u interested in jackin off to my dead best friend whos dead?\"\n\n[13:42] <##red|StGames##> I didn't have to ask them much i aready knew the name 'Jada Cole\" they recognized it tehy said yeah thats the name she used. they werent happy about me calling but it wasn't like a big secret or something.\n\n[13:42] <##pink|TopJim##> where is this story going\n\n[13:44] <##red|StGames##> So get this. I start looking through the video clips of her i've got and i see one titled \"Jada Cole services our troops\" and i thoguht thats a little weird because supposedly shes only doing this wiht her boyfriend. I open the video and watch it and shes \"servicing\" our troops in Iraq…\n\n[13:44] <##pink|TopJim##> …\n\n[13:44] <##red|StGames##> we didnt have troops in Iraq in 2001\n\n[13:45] <##cyan|Artistick##> Bitch we an empire we got troops everywhere, the American Empire of America\n\n[13:45] <##red|StGames##> Not in Iraq, back when Saddam was still alive he wasnt letting us set up fucking training bases in his fuckin country\n\n[13:45] <##red|StGames##> So alright, i start looking through other clips I got and now i'm starting to freak tf out. I'd been downloading video clips of her from like 2003 - 2011/2012 i didnt know she was dead at the time so i had no reason to suspect, but the more recent clips of her 2011, 2012 and such are in HD\n\n[13:46] <darthenstein> they didnt have no hd in fuckin 2001!\n\n[13:46] <##red|StGames##> Exacvtly!!!

Shes slightly more well-known after 2015 but still kind of obscure, and a lot of the clips ive got from 2003 and such dont have her name on it but it's the exact same voice, everything.\n\n[14:02] <darthenstein> send me some i swear i wont fap to it this is too fucked up to fap to\n\n[14:03] <##orange|SuperNintendoChalmers##> LMAO porno ghost is \"too fucked up to fap to\"\n\n[14:03] <##cyan|Artistick##> imagine something too fucked upt o fap to\n\n[14:03] <##red|StGames##> Im fucking serious about this, guys\n\n[14:04] <darthenstein> lol too fucked up to fap to but I mean it this is legit crazy shit\n\n[14:05] <##pink|TopJim##> How do you even know these earlier videos are from pre-2012?\n\n[14:05] <darthenstein> cuz thats when he downloaded them, shitbeak.  he downloaded them starting in 2003\n\n[14:05] <##pink|TopJim##> Right, because he says he downloaded them starting in 2003, there's no way he could be lying no one ever lies on the intertnet\n\n[14:06] <darthenstein> he could be a bot inside my own computer.  all of u could be bots inside my computer i could be typing to no one and getting a derpy ai spitting out dumb bullshit at me pretending to be other people\n\n[14:06] <##cyan|Artistick##> Eat my digital fuck\n\n[14:07] <##red|StGames##> the first vids I have of her are really old, clearly taken from like a camcorder or something.  I first downloaded them in 2003 so theyre at least that old.  the room she's in is exactly the same in every single video, even the Rey videos and she hdoesn't age at all.  She's in HD in them I can literally look between 2003 vids and 2016 vids and pause on her face or her ass and see the exact same creases the exact same dimples the exact same veins and pimples and freckles and everything.  Even if it isnt teh same girl as the news article, how in the fuck is a girl doing nonstop porn videos from 2003 to 2016 or 2020 and not even gain a single wrinkle?\n\n[14:07] <##yellow|heroicchoice##> aight so is she dead or is she a vampire?\n\n[14:07] <##cyan|Artistick##> lmao same difference\n\n[14:08] <##yellow|heroicchoice##> or a porno ghost?\n\n##pink|[14:08] -> BeerOff sets mode: +b :*!*@c-1-454-114-5-24.hdsd1.pa.sub.comcast.net##\n\n##green|[14:08] -> StGames was kicked by BeerOff (Dude, fuck off, no one gives a shit about your creepy porn collection)##\n\n[14:09] <##pink|TopJim##> darthenstein why dont you ever shut the fuck up.\n\n[14:09] <darthenstein> good god, relax bitch, u cant just dogpile all the time.\n\n[14:10] <##gold|Jade##> He's one random guy on the internet talking about his pirated porn collection.
