I know it well. Love can be a fickle thing, but I can give it to you. The one you love. Her beauty. Her embrace. Her hand will be yours until death do you part. This I offer to you if you simply accept. There is no shame in happiness. Do you wish to be loved?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nWhat one will sacrifice for flesh...\n\nDo you know what you desire? I do. You are tired of being weak. Tired of the bruises and the constant aches. You desire vengeance, I see. The satisfaction would be like no other. You wish to spill blood with your own bare hands. I can give you the strength of a hundred men, and destruction will be ready by your side. No more will you cower in fear from those who rob and abuse you. Instead, they will all quiver before your might. Do you wish to destroy?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nA lifetime worth of sin. You have spent it well...\n\nYou there. I can give you great treasures. From glittering gold coins to diamond rings you can live like a king. Forget the dusty roads and your simple wares. Leave behind those filthy peasants. Why live with what you already have when there is so much more to gain? Fortune can all be yours if you simply answer me. That is my only price. Do you wish to become gilded?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nThe camel through the eye of a needle...\n\nDo you hear it? The hungry congregation of maggots as they fester on delicious meat? They know your hunger well and so do I. You have a ferocious appetite, especially for the flesh of men. It is a difficult taste to acquire, but I can bestow upon you a gift. When you are hunger bitten you will have monstrous strength. None will able to outrun you as you give chase. Then, prey will hang lifelessly in your iron jaws after the joyous hunt. Their delicious meat will all be yours. Do you wish to feast?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nDelicious...\n\nDo you see me? I see you. Your eyes burn fiery green. I know what it is that you desire. Yes, it is not fair to witness his success when you are most deserving of it. You are the eldest brother, and his life should be rightfully yours. How tragically unfair life can be, but I can rectify that injustice. He can have your aches instead as it was meant to be. All the adoration of his peers, his lovely family, his grand fortune, and his health will be yours. It would be better without him in the way. Do you wish to end your longing?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nReturn to nothing...\n\nI know what a man such as yourself desires. You wish to be at peace as you lie in the cool shade and drink wine. It is so simple yet others constantly disturb your leisure. How unfortunate. They do not understand you were not made to toil beneath the scorching sun. I can make them go away, leaving you to your precious spare time. No more complaints. I ask for nothing laborious in exchange. Do you wish to spend your days unburden?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nWaste of a life...\n\nI see your head held high. You are indeed greater than the rest, yet they fail to truly acknowledge your glory. It it is you alone who deserves the praise. No one else can even compare. Your accomplishments are grand and mighty as a god. In fact, the power of such would suit you well. They all should kneel before you. Do you wish to ascend?\n\n[[=]]\n//2,376 days later.//\n[[/=]]\n\nDo you hear it?\n\nDo you hear the cries of the damned?\n\nDo you hear the great feasting of your flesh?\n\nDo you hear the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3063 buzzing]?",
