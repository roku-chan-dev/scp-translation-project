It has been owned and operated by Dr. Gleason for about eight years. It is of immeasurable importance to sell SCP-2772-J to another person in a short amount of time. Notable details of SCP-2772-J include:\n\n* 7 cushy seats\n* A combined MPG rating of 17\n* A great sound system\n* Up-to-date registration and insurance\n* Only 97,223 miles!!!\n\nSCP-2772-J is available to purchase for --$2500-- --$2000-- $1900 USD. Call Dr. Gleason at (555)-867-5309 for more details.\n\n**Interviews:** The following is an incomplete log of people who refused the chance to buy SCP-2772-J from Dr. Gleason at a reasonable price.\n\n##white|These guys missed out on a great deal!##\n\n> = **Transcript 2772-J-01**\n> \n> **Honest Salesman:** Dr. Gleason\n> \n> **Stingy Bastard:** Agent Caesar Spago\n> \n> **Foreword:** Agent Spago has just arrived at Site-56 after the conclusion of an unrelated [[[SCP-4618|interview]]].\n> \n> --------\n> \n> = **<Begin Log>**\n> ------\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Hey, Caesar, you're back! \n> \n> **Agent Spago:** Hi, Gary. It took me seven hours to walk all the way back here from Brighton High, all because Donahue didn't have the sense to pick me up afterwards. \n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Man, it looks like you needed some reliable transportation! Wait till you see this!\n> \n> **Agent Spago:** That's nice, but I just want a coffee and some vacation pay right n-\n> \n> //Dr. Gleason drags Agent Spago to the Site-56 parking lot without his consent, and stops in front of SCP-2772-J.//\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Look at this bad boy! It's got air conditioning, and exclusive trim-\n> \n> **Agent Spago:** Gary, I don't want to buy your SUV. I already have a car.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** But with //this//, you could've driven back instead of walking!\n> \n> **Agent Spago:** //<very very angry>// Well, it's too late now! \n> \n> //Agent Spago starts to walk away.//\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Caesar, wait! I still haven't told you about the seat warmers!\n> ------\n> \n> = **<End Log>**\n> \n> ----------\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Following Agent Spago's refusal to purchase SCP-2772-J, Dr. Gleason was recorded making a sales pitch to Researcher Murrieta, who also refused.\n\n------\n\n> = **Transcript 2772-J-02**\n> \n> **Opportunity Provider:** Dr. Gleason\n> \n> **Annoying Cheapskate:** Dr. Victoria Vomac\n> \n> **Foreword:** Dr. Vomac is currently in the market for a new vehicle.\n> \n> -------\n> \n> = **<Begin Log>**\n> ------\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** //<meekly>// Vicky, could I speak with you for a second?\n> \n> **Dr. Vomac:** Yeah, sure, what do ya need?\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** I heard you're looking for a car to buy, so I thought that-\n> \n> **Dr. Vomac:** Oh [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-343|343]]], not this again.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Yes, this again! My SUV is perfect for your family, and it holds more cargo than that minivan you're wanting to buy.\n> \n> **Dr. Vomac:** Gleason, we've already been over this. I'm not buying your car.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** So what?! You're just gonna sink 30 grand in a mommy-mobile, when you can get my Eddie Bauer for a tenth of that?\n> \n> **Dr. Vomac:** Get out of my office.\n> \n> -------\n> = **<End Log>**\n> \n> -------\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Dr. Vomac's refusal to get a great deal must be the result of some sort of infohazard.

Are you Tassajara?\n> \n> **Researcher Tassajara:** Oh, yes. You must be Dr. Gleason. Nice to meet you.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Look, I... I have something I've never told anyone before.\n> \n> **Researcher Tassajara:** Is this about the Ford you're trying to sell?\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** No, it's- actually, yeah, it's about that. How did you know?\n> \n> **Researcher Tassajara:** Everyone warned me about this. And just to get this out of the way, I'm not buying SCP-2772-J.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Ah, you've seen my database entry. So will you buy it?\n> \n> **Researcher Tassajara:** //<in an annoyed tone>// I just said no! Get away from me!!\n> \n> //Researcher Tassajara runs down the hall, away from Dr. Gleason.//\n> ------\n> = **<End Log>**\n> \n> --------\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Shoot. Looks like the infohazard spread to her as well. //-Dr. Gleason//\n\n\n[[div class=\"vdn\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ DIRECTOR'S NOTE\n\nGleason, the creation of an SCP entry for the mere purpose of selling your personal vehicle is unacceptable. See me in my office immediately.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n##white|I just wanna sell this before the smog check comes up.##\n\n> = **Transcript 2772-J-04**\n> \n> **Innocent Entrepreneur:** Dr. Gleason\n> \n> **Pretentious Penny-Pincher:** Director Peter Palermo\n> \n> **Foreword:** This is a scheduled meeting regarding SCP-2772-J.\n> ------\n> = **<Begin Log>**\n> ------\n> **Director Palermo:** Have a seat, Gary.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Hello, Mr. Palermo. I'll take cash or credit for my SUV. I have the papers ready.\n> \n> **Director Palermo:** //<confused>// Wha... what? No, we need to talk about \"2772-J\". And it's //Director// Palermo to you.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh yes, my SUV. If you want, I'm willing to cut a hundred dollars off the price.\n> \n> **Director Palermo:** This is ridiculous! You cannot write an SCP entry just to advertise your damn car! You need to delete it, or I'm gonna get you terminated.\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** Oh, I see. You're affected by the infohazard, too.\n> \n> **Director Palermo:** //<confused out of his mind>// Wha... what??\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** There's a infohazard going around causing people to react with hostility towards SCP-2772-J. Don't worry, I'm trying to find a cure.\n> \n> **Director Palermo:** No, no! This isn't a infohazard, it's just that no one wants your car!!\n> \n> **Dr. Gleason:** It's okay, Director Palermo. Your viewpoint isn't natural, you're just a victim of a infoha-\n> \n> **Director Palermo:** //<really upset>// GET OUT OF MY OFFICE!!\n> ------\n> = **<End Log>**\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** The Director does not seem to be immune to the infohazard. I should investigate whether it affects civilians. -Dr. Gleason\n\n\n[[div class=\"vdn\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ DIRECTOR'S NOTE\n\nThrough my limited research, it seems that the only way to get rid of Gleason's pleas is to just buy \"SCP-2772-J\" from him. So, who's gonna take one for the team? It's only 1900 bucks now.\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** IMG_2772.jpg\n> **Name:** Ford Expedition Eddie Bauer Edition\n> **Author:** [[*user Jiwoahn]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA-3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2772-j/IMG_2772NOPLATE.jpg SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[/=]]",
