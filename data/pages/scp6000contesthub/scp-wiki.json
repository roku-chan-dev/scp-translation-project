From the basics of life on earth, animals, plants, to the large scale components, ecosystems, extinctions, the atmosphere, this site has a rich history of articles that touch on, or are inspired by, the natural world. And beyond that, on a fundamental level, it’s a violation of the proverbial laws of nature that makes an SCP an SCP, isn’t it? There’s quite a lot to do with this one, and I look forward to seeing what you guys come up with!\n\n++ Another series come and gone! It’s absolutely incredible, and it’s my personal honor to be able to help usher in a new series for the third(!!!) time!

Theme-related disqualification is determined by the contest marshals. Voting on a piece based on your desire to see it win or lose the contest is grounds for disqualification. \n * If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to ask a Community Outreach Member.\n* One entry per user\n* Collaborations are allowed, but that will count as the one entry for all participants\n* Pre-existing drafts are allowed, so long as they have never been posted to the wiki\n* 'Nature' shall be interpreted very broadly. So long as you can explain how your work relates to nature as a concept, in any interpretation, it'll likely be accepted. The theme is here to inspire, not constrain. If you're not sure if it'll count, feel free to ask one of the contest marshals listed below.\n* Edits to works **are** allowed.\n* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.\n* The prize, obviously, is the SCP-6000 slot. Runners up get to choose other Series VII slots in order of place.\n* All Contest Marshals have the ability to disqualify entries for violations of the above-listed rules, egregiously poor sportsmanship not otherwise enumerated, or failure to fit the theme. All decisions are appealable to [[*user ProcyonLotor]] and/or [[*user taylor_itkin]].\n\n+++ Contest Marshals\n* [[*user ProcyonLotor]]\n* [[*user taylor_itkin]]\n* [[*user Naepic]]\n* More to come!\n\n-----\n^^All thanks to [http://www.scpwiki.com/uncertaintycrossing-s-art-page UncertaintyCrossing] for the incredible header image!^^\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** nature.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp6000contesthub SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
