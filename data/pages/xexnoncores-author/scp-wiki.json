Yes it is Xexnon[[footnote]]Pronounced zex-non, like won.[[/footnote]], not Xenon, because I misspelled my username coming onto the wiki and I decided to keep it because I think it’s cool. You may call me my full name, Xex, Xe, X, or even Xenon if you want to, if your autocorrect makes you do that—whatever you think is appropriate is fine. I’m fine with anything, and have allegedly been referred to as a pretty chill guy.\n\nI’ll be frank, I’m not one for having super flashy bios, so here’s the lowdown—I’m that one writer currently obsessed with Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd, and writes basically nothing but Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd[[footnote]]I actually do write other things, I promise. It’s rare, but happens. Also if you’re wondering “why?” I don’t know either. The autism does not usually allow me to choose what I obsess over.[[/footnote]]. I’ve actually been a lurker of the SCP website as a whole since 2012, having on-and-off bouts of browsing and hyperfixation, but it was September of 2024 when I finally decided to take the plunge for myself into this. How’s that for a belated hello?\n\nCheck out my series [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/black-diamond-billions-hub Black Diamond Billions!] It’s my pride and joy!\n\nFind my works (and thoughts) below:\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\n* [[[SCP-6629]]] : A Mother’s Love Can Destroy Us All\n* [[[SCP-7495]]] : Referring to the Self will Generate a Sense of Hopelessness\n* [[[SCP-7469]]] : Memories Frozen in Time\n* [[[SCP-8525]]] : Santa Baby (collab with [[*user newfangler]])\n* [[[SCP-255]]] : To Kill An Advertiser\n* [[[SCP-7847]]] : Creation Of A Tool (collab with [[*user jackalrelated]])\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\n* [[[One Ugly Bitch?]]]\n* [[[Eat Your Food!]]]\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/all-that-glitter-s-is-fool-s-gold All That Glitters is Fool’s Gold] (To be given its own series later)\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ir000281-ch000265-rb000279-what-are-we-to-do IR000281-CH000265-RB000279: WHAT ARE WE TO DO?]\n* [[[Kiss Kiss Fall to the Dark]]]\n* [[[Of Starfish]]]\n* [[[Dead Capitalism Theory]]]\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/figuring-out-how-to-love-you Figuring Out How To Love You]\n* [[[Dial-Up Internet to Flesh-Made Wonders]]]\n* [[[Ode To A Businesswoman]]]\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whos-afraid-of-a-red-starfish-en-blues Who’s Afraid Of A Red Starfish En Blues?]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab GoI Formats]]\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-moonstone Critter Profile: Moonstone!]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Series]]\n[[=]]\n[[[Adamantine Temptations Hub]]]\nThe (extremely) complicated love story of a retired O5 and the most dangerous person she could have ever possibly saved: the CEO of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. herself.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Works\" hide=\"Hide Works\"]] \n[[/=]]\n__PROLOGUE__\n[[[A Murder and Relief in the Dark]]]\n__ACT 1__\n* [[[Pierce the Velvet]]]\n* [[[To Love a Snake with Blue Eyes]]]\n* [[[Out Of The Darkness]]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Why MC&D?]]\nI already said that I don’t know why I latched onto this Group of Interest as what I primarily write, but I do know why I continue to write them. In an age where fantasizing about money is an escape for many, and where capitalism is at its breakneck, bloated, senile late stages, I find it important to remind myself and others of how money, wealth, and power corrupt, and how it is generally not a good idea in the long run. I am a very firm believer in “it is harder for a rich man to enter heaven than it is a camel to pass through the eye of a needle”[[footnote]]Matthew 19:24[[/footnote]], therefore I write what I do. I find the maladies of the wealthy fascinating, and the way they can hurt, maim and destroy both themselves and others even more fascinating. I believe that in order to ward oneself from greed, they must understand the consequences of said greed, and how it will quickly hollow them out. I also love writing intensely psychological introspection, and the idiosyncrasies of gnarl-moraled oligarchs is just…chef’s kiss. It was a match made in heaven.\n\nMy other reason is that being a reader of this site for as long as I have, MC&D perfectly captures all of that which I have loved about the SCP universe: their secret worlds, their anonymity, their plentiful rituals, their byzantine habits, their potential for interesting evil, and their storied history[[footnote]]Both in-universe and out of it.[[/footnote]]. The writing about MC&D on this site is of some of the highest quality SCP can offer, and was instrumental in paving what I wanted to “write” for the website. I have it to thank for helping me to find myself as a writer again and what my passion for writing is having done it since 2012.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Author Will]]\nIn the event that I am unavailable and Wikidot no longer remains a usable platform[[footnote]]Unlikely to happen, but including this here just in case.[[/footnote]] I give staff full authority and permission to migrate my works to whatever site they wish, and grant them editing permissions to modify my works to fit the formatting of the new host. \n\nOutside of that specific consideration, I wish for [[*user DrBleep]], [[*user adanaist]] and [[*user mxsinister]] to be given full control over my works and over Black Diamond Billions in the event I am no longer considered available to contact[[footnote]]Consider this to mean I am unreachable via any platform for more than two years.[[/footnote]]. However, I do not authorize deletions, rewrites, or major edits in the event such a transfer happens, such as to the structure of or the content of my works. All permissions (except for deletions) are to go to my collaborators should this come to pass.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Favorite Works]]\nA collection of some of my favorite works on the website in no particular order for me and me alone. And you I guess, since you’re reading this. These are what I go to when I need inspiration and understanding of what I’m doing. Consider these a source of great insight into the art of SCP creation, prose, and/or formatting, although there’s a 10% chance something is on here simply because I am indulgently in love with it.
