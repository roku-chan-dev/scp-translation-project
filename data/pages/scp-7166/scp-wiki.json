In the event an individual survives multiple strikes within their lifetime, they are to be questioned, in order to ascertain any similarities between instances.\n\nIf any underlying cause for SCP-7166 is discovered, research into possible methods of neutralization is to be prioritized.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7166 is a phenomenon affecting individuals who are struck by lightning. This phenomenon does not appear to affect all victims of lighting strikes, but SCP-7166 has been found to occur at higher frequencies if:\n\n* The individual is struck by lightning, but survives,\n* The individual retains higher brain functions,\n* The individual resumes everyday activities after recovering from the lightning strike (e.g. work, leisure, family, etc.), and\n* These activities place the individual outdoors.\n\nIndividuals who meet these criteria, designated SCP-7166-1, will become significantly more likely to experience lightning strikes. This effect appears to be cumulative with repeated strikes, as individuals who survive more than two strikes become far more likely to experience a third strike, and so on. This effect will only demanifest following either SCP-7166-1's cessation of outdoor activities, loss of higher brain functions, or death.\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[>]]\n##444|Dr. Sanderson, come on.
