Even after repeated readthroughs and laconic explanations, sometimes you still don't get the full picture - the context, the nuanced meanings, or the greater story behind everything. The r/SCPDeclassified subreddit is here to help you out and enrich your reading experience by offering clear and readable walkthroughs and essays that delve deep into these multifaceted pieces.\n\nWe call our explanation posts declassifications. They incorporate a SparkNotes-style summary of the article, along with heavy analysis of the meaning of their plot elements or symbols. We incorporate quotes from the story, knowledge and links with all of Foundation lore, and our own educated speculation about how it all fits together to create a professionally-written, engaging, and exhaustive declassification.\n\nOur subreddit is a hub of content that celebrates and analyzes the great depth of story that the SCP community has created over the years. We host periodic Ask An Author features, which allow SCP authors a platform for commenters to ask questions about their writing process, any part of their work, and their contributions to the wiki as a whole. In addition, SCPDeclassified's Lore Overviews are helpful and in-depth essays that explore one part of the SCP universe, whether that be the Class of '76, the History of Sarkicism, Pattern Screamers, or a Modern Introduction to the SCP Foundation.\n[[/span]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Authors, of course, have the rights to preserve their articles' integrity and meaning, and as such the rights to be exempt from declassifications.** \n\nIf you do not want your articles to be declassified, add your name to the list below.\n\n[[*user ch00bakka]]\n[[*user NatVoltaic]]\n[[*user Jade Skylar]]\n\nIf you want people to get explicit permission from you before you start, add your name to the list below.\n\n[[*user Decibelles]]\n\nIf you don't need people to get permission from you at any point, add your name to the list below.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"border: 2px solid purple; width: 95%; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n++ DECLASSIFICATION ARCHIVE\n[[collapsible show=\"► SERIES I\" hide=\"▼ SERIES I\" hideLocation=\"top\"]]\n\n[https://redd.it/eyxboq SCP-055 - [unknown]]\n> //The implications are terrifying, no?//\n\n[https://redd.it/agw97u SCP-089 - Tophet]\n> //And finally, a subtle hint that the current terrors that our world face could be averted, if only a woman would burn her child alive.//\n\n[https://redd.it/726cpc SCP-093 - Red Sea Object]\n> //But if you hide the rocks throughout the worlds, break the array, He cannot move from this world.
