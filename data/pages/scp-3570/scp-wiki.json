At its first zenith, ~1.1 billion Type-BE entities across the easternmost part of Russia, North and South America, and parts of Northwestern Europe became exposed to moonlight.\n\nExposed entities underwent extensive musculoskeletal transformations and grew wing-like anatomical structures from their backs. Entities experienced a mass enhancement of the deltoid muscles; the dorsal portions of the trapezius and scapula expanded and acquired a wider and more defined morphology. Parallel to the existing arms, a new set of forelimbs emerged laterally. The forelimbs extended outward to a 3-m length on each side of the body, according to an average adult's physiology. Different body types and sizes developed proportional anatomical formations.\n\nThe forelimbs developed long, bony digits occurring within a thick and supple membrane that became the basis for a new network of blood vessels. The forelimbs developed feathers, consistent in composition and function to those of common seabirds, and retractable talons at the extremities. Type-BE entities displayed various levels of discomfort during this process, which required between 2 and 5 hr to complete. After the transformation, the newly developed wings allowed for a diversity of short- and long-range flight.\n\nDuring the Moon's transit, locations across the world became exposed to moonlight and thaumic energy. All exposed Type-BE entities developed the same winged transformations. Newly winged Type-BE entities emitted greater amounts of [[[goc-supplemental-arad|Élan-Vital Energy (EVE)]]],[[footnote]]**//Élan-Vital// Energy:** Fundamental particles generated by all living entities.[[/footnote]] became capable of flight speeds greater than 40 km/h, and in most instances, displayed predatory behaviour.\n\nAt 05:45 p.m. PDT, Armed Research Site-18 -- the Avian Division's base of operations -- received a transmission from [[[secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Lunar Area-32]]]. A transcript is as follows.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   ▷ Lunar Area-32 Transmission\" hide=\"△ Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ AUDIO LOG\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\nThis is Junior Researcher Arvo Driessen of Lunar Area-32 transmitting on all Foundation channels. We are on full lockdown. Task Force Sigma-6 “Puddlejumpers” is gone. Multiple anomalous humanoids have entered the facility @@[@@//Static.//@@]@@ engaging in hostilities.\n\nTo the Avian Division: Consider Lunar Area-32 lost.\n\nYesterday, we detected thaumic disturbances across the lunar surface, and a few hours ago, it turned bright blue. It was pretty quiet afterward, but then a group of winged humanoids poured in from [[[scp-120|SCP-120]]] -- our exit out of here. I'm stationed at the research facility in Sub-Level 3, way the hell away from them. Lucky me. @@[@@//Static.//@@]@@ can't say the same for my colleagues. Doctor Simrin and I had been together during the attack before she headed up to containment to check up on the Euclid-Classes. I lost her signal shortly after. It's been three hours.\n\n@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@\n\nI checked the security video. There were what, thirty of them? When they appeared, they immediately attacked the reception area. One agent took to defending himself with a security baton. He smacked a few of them before they swarmed him, and then the bastards started eating him. They tore his eyes from their sockets, and as he screamed, tore out his tongue next.\n\nI think they're getting restless, being cooped up in here like this? They've taken to chewing up the electrical systems, bringing entire sections of the facility down with them. When one of them collapses from electrocution, the next one just climbs over and continues where they left off. They are literal birdbrains.\n\n@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@\n\nI don't know what's going on down there, but up here? We're screwed. I think the worst part of all this is the fact that Director Hourdoon, that prick, escaped with the only evac shuttle. Hope that piece of shit crashes and burns.\n\nI'll keep Hoygull updated, but honestly? Don't get your hopes up. The support systems are failing, the sub-levels are practically swarming with those stupid birds, and more of them keep piling in through dash 120.\n\nGood luck saving humanity and all that. As far as I can tell, humanity is beyond saving. If there was any hope before, it's all gone now. My only recommendation is to aim for the head.\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe newly transformed Type-BE entities have been observed flying in flocks with upwards of 500 individuals. Hunting occurs on both an individual and group basis, with moderate territorial aggression occurring among rivalling flocks. Entities can unhinge their jaws while consuming prey, enlarging the oral cavity to about three times its size. Skin and tissue stretch with ease, whereas chewing remains unencumbered.\n\nThe extent of behaviours these entities display is as-yet-undocumented, because of their relative aggression toward other species of birds (including Avian Division personnel) and insufficient observation time.\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ AUGUST 10 UPDATE\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**I. EE-3570 Status**\n\nAbout 24 hr have elapsed since the Moon began emitting thaumic energy, and ~90% of all Type-BE entities have been affected. The Earth's thermosphere displays an iridescent atmospheric phenomenon, similar to aurorae, generated by excess thaumic energy.\n\nAffected Type-BE entities surrounding their constructed monuments have begun off-world transit via spontaneously occurring Ways produced by the monuments. Transit occurs on an individual basis, whereas the Ways have spread radially outward according to a geometric expansion model.\n\nThe Avian Division estimates that most Type-BE entities will abandon the Earth within one week. --Research into the emergence and destination of these Ways is ongoing.-- [[span class=\"rev-blue\"]]It has been determined that the Ways lead to the exoplanet URA-8047 (see Supplemental Materials for more information).[[/span]]\n----\n**II. Follow-Up Actions Taken**\n\nAn excerpt from Marine Fighting Team CHARYBDIS' initial response to EE-3570 is as follows.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"bottom\" show=\"   ▷ Incident Log EE-3570-035\" hide=\"△ Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n+++ VIDEO LOG\n----\n**NOTE:** MFT CHARYBDIS is a cybernetically augmented four-person unit, part of an organization known as the [[[spc-hub|Centre]]].[[footnote]]Centre personnel are primarily dedicated to combatting anomalous nautical threats, typically of Selachian nature. The Department of Extra-Universal Affairs first established contact with the Centre in 2011, but MTF-Eta-4 of the Avian Division and MFT CHARYBDIS of the Centre only began joint operations shortly before the advent of EE-3570.[[/footnote]] Audiovisual footage was gathered from each CHARYBDIS operative and compiled into one abridged transcript.\n\nCHARYBDIS operatives appear unaffected by the anomaly. Whether this is related to their extra-universal origin, a memetic hardening developed during their training, or some other effect is as-yet-unknown.\n\nAfter the start of the Event, Mobile Task Force Eta-4 (“Begone Thoth”) recommended that CHARYBDIS proceed to Outpost-24-B and remain there until the cessation of the Event. While travelling to Outpost-24-B, an overwhelming force of Type-BE entities engaged CHARYBDIS, forcing the team to abandon operator Leah Řezník (CHARYBDIS-3). Fully transformed Type-BE entities discovered Outpost-24-B about 4 hr later.\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n**C-4 Haruki:** Sir, they're attempting access to the main entrance.

On the 24th of December 1972, initial analysis of the Apollo 17 Moon landing's geological samples detailed elevated EVE consistent with reality-bending phenomena.[[footnote]]As thaumatic technology was still under-developed before 1972 because of a lack of research into the Theory of Unified Thaumatology, earlier lunar missions could not detect any thaumic energy.[[/footnote]] The samples, collected from various deposits around the Taurus–Littrow Valley landing site, prompted theories of the Moon's thaumic makeup.\n\nIn December 1995, the newly christened, and if I might add, unfortunately named “Outpost Thoth-1” performed a series of observations on lunar sites to record thaumic radiation levels. They discovered the Moon had a baseline EVE intensity registering at 141 000 caspers[[footnote]]**casper:** A unit used to assign a measurement to reality-altering phenomena.[[/footnote]] -- greater than anywhere on Earth.\n\nWhy that did not immediately lead to drastic changes in localized reality and sub-reality, is unknown. But, well, that explains why something //did// happen. And you can thank Thoth, the Egyptian god of wisdom, for causing it.\n\n@@[@@//Pause.//@@]@@\n\nIn the event that such intense energy might be manipulated against Earth, several active deterrents were devised. The contingencies, unfortunately, could not be enacted because the BE-Class Scenario decimated our workforce.[[footnote]]Dr. Hoygull has decided it would be most appropriate to categorize the two events as the same. Hence, BE-Class “**Migration**” End-of-Consciousness Scenario.[[/footnote]] Taking a look at the files here... Projects included the mass [[[scp-1654|Scranton Reality Anchor “Seraphim Array”]]] in mid-Earth orbit, the Global Hard-Light Energy Shielding System, and the controlled expansion of [[[scp-2821|SCP-2821]]] to quickly consume the Moon and then itself via–\n\nWhat's this? The file literally reads, “[DATA EXPUNGED]”. Of course, the order and protocols of the Foundation still hold true, even when the world falls apart!\n\nAnyway, the red tape speaks for itself. Let me tell you what we're going to do about this. Appended to Document EE-3570 is Supplemental Materials file [[span class=\"terminal-span\"]]UMBRAL_MIGRATORY_SEQUENCE.txt[[/span]]. Take note of the information within that file before using available resources to reach immediate rendezvous with Mobile Task Force Eta-4. After that, we will co-ordinate off-world evacuation efforts.\n\nSuffice it to say we don't have much time left. Everything will, uh, make sense soon.\n\nAnd if it doesn't?\n\nGood luck.\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe remainder of the Foundation -- 75 Avian Division personnel, MFT CHARYBDIS, and [[[scp-2785|SCP-2785]]] -- is stationed at Site-18. Operation: DIVINE RUSE is being developed at this time.\n----\n**III. Supplemental Materials**\n\nThe few remaining Avian Division staff in Egypt discovered a preserved papyrus reed manuscript, circa 1900 BCE, filed within [[[scp-1644|Reliquary Site-62]]] Archives.

I asked, //Thoth, why do you cast down unbelievers?//\n\nTo which Thoth replied, //such an action is a justice basked in by the righteous.//\n\nTo this, I asked, //Thoth, how can you cast down your children, righteous or not?//\n\nThoth said, //your kind is not truly my children. But I have asserted myself in front of the Communion for those I deem worthy -- thus, those I consider my children in spirit. For if I do not extend my wisdom, why must my wisdom exist?//\n\nI asked Thoth, //is there anything we could do to anger you?//\n\nTo which Thoth replied, //to reject my wisdom is to spite me. Indeed, to be without my wisdom for long is a blasphemous offence. But to anger me, truly, it would need the effort of one who is quite mad. There is nothing you, my collective children, could do to anger me. I have plans yet for those that have failed to gain my favour.//\n\nI then asked, //Thoth, what is your plan for us?//\n\nThoth proclaimed, //I shall cast down the azure fires of Set above, which will consume your Holy City. These are not raging fires, however, but those of majesty and wonder. Of the bright motes that twinkle in the night. Of Ra's destiny. And when the City becomes inflamed, so too will your hearts. They will sprout and flower into vast wings in the reflection of the Sacred Ibis. This, I shall share with all my children, who will join my flock in the vast Cosmos. You will rule my paradise.
