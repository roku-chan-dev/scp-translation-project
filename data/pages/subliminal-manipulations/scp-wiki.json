A brown haired and lanky man lay on a bed in a corner of the room, unmolested by the draft. The picture of a blond haired woman with a red scarf sitting precariously on a dresser fell to the ground with a thud.\n\nTed's head greeted him with a pounding pain, a token of appreciation for the adventure he had led with the other researchers the last night. The \"Beer Pong King\" got off his bed and stumbled towards the coffeemaker.\n\nIgnorant of the invader, the humbled royal mumbled.\n\n\"Coffee, must find coffee...\"\n\nTed looked to the fallen picture, clutched his hands, and sighed deeply.\n\nClaire...\n\nHe picked the picture back up and gently stroked it with his thumb before returning it to the dresser. Then the bachelor shambled through the living room and stood next to his laptop, still open on the end table.\n\nA foreign urge to check his email had interrupted his caffeine quest. \n\nClosing Leisure Suit Larry III and opening his personal email, his mouse pointer hovered over the vestigial folder titled \"Spam\" in the lefthand column. \n\nStruck once again by an uncharacteristic pang of interest, he began chuckling at the thought. \n\nI wonder what offers for male enhancement and declarations of love I will find?\n\nBemusedly skimming the pointer across the titles of a few blatant scams, a message caught his attention. All interest in Brazilian milkmaids and methods to \"increase your income from home\" was forgotten.\n\nMost puzzling was the fact that it had no sender. The correspondence also lacked a subject and any contents, save one attachment, a Microsoft Word document titled \"Print Me\".\n\nCurious, Ted complied.\n\nHe walked up to the wireless printer, the start of the first page only beginning to emerge. \n\nAs Ted stared at the device, a thought entered his mind.\n\n//Good, it's nearly out of red ink.//\n\nWait, why would that matter? It's probably all black text, anyway.\n\nTed shook his head. Coffee, that was what he needed.\n\nWith a beep, signaling that a cartridge was empty, the printer continued whirring for a few more lines and stopped.\n\nTed looked at the document, now halted halfway out of the machine. He nodded, recognizing it as the beginning of a novel. It was in a rust-red font with some occasional letters blue or purple. \n\nTed inspected further. A hidden message remained in the blue letters.\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nTed took a step away. A shiver ran down his spine, unsure of exactly how he had arrived at the decisions that led him here. He stood staring at the computer screen, a look of indecision on his face.\n\nIn the end, his curiosity won out over his caution. \n\nHe approached the printer to review the page. \n\n> [[span style=\"font-family: Courier; font-size: 100%;\"]]**##Blue|I####Red|t was a## ##Blue|d####Red|ark and## ##Purple|s####Red|tormy night;## ##Blue|t####Red|he rain## ##Purple|fe####Red|ll in torrents —## ##Purple|e####Red|xcept at occasional intervals,## ##Blue|w####White|h####Blue|e####White|n it was checked by## ##Blue|a## ##White|violent gust of wind which swept up the streets (fo####Blue|r## ##White|it is in London that our sc####Blue|e####White|ne lies), ra####Blue|t####White|tling along t####Blue|he## ##White|housetops,## ##Blue|a####White|nd fiercely agi####Blue|t####White|a####Blue|t####White|ing th####Blue|e## ##White|sca####Blue|n####White|ty flame of the lamps that struggle####Blue|d a####White|gai####Blue|n####White|s####Blue|t## ##White|the darkne####Blue|s####White|s.##**\n> **##White|Thr####Blue|o####White|ugh one o####Blue|f####White| the obscu####Blue|re####White|st## ##Blue|qu####White|arters of London, and among haunts l####Blue|it####White|tle loved by the gentlemen of the police,## ##Blue|a## ##White|man, evident####Blue|l####White|y of the lowest orders, was wending his solitary way####Blue|.## ##White|He stopped twice or thrice at different shops and houses of a description## ##Blue|co####White|rrespo####Blue|n####White|d####Blue|e####White|nt with the appearan####Blue|c####White|e of## ##Blue|t####White|he quartier in which## ##Blue|the####White|y we####Blue|r####White|e situated, and tended inquiry f####Blue|o####White|r some article or another which## ##Blue|d####White|id not## ##Blue|s####White|eem easily## ##Blue|to## ##White|be me####Blue|t## ##White|wit####Blue|h####White|.

He peeked through the peephole to see a figure in a brown uniform walking away. \n\nOpening the door, Ted turned his attention downwards to a UPS package on the floor. \n\nWasn't that Xbox supposed to arrive next week?\n\nLike the email, the UPS package also lacked a \"From\" address. \n\nArching an eyebrow, Ted brought the package inside. Opening the box, he found an assortment of metal components.\n\nFor a moment, stupidly, he wished Claire was there.\n\nHe then returned to the printer and clicked \"OK\" to its offer to \"Continue Print Job with Remaining Ink\". \n\nTed read the visible portion of the decoded message aloud.\n\n\"We are the Attendants of Requital. Connect the rods to the spheres...\"\n\nAssembling the strange device, Ted noticed an Anderson Robotics logo on one of the pieces. \n\n\"Didn't they open a location not too far from here about a month ago?\" Ted said, grabbing a few more pages from the printer and continued unabated. \n\nIn the end, the device looked like a steel Rolodex, with sphere centered disks on a segmented rod replacing the cards. All that remained in the box was a small bottle with two small pills inside and a label reading \"Open Upon Activation\". \n\nHe tried spinning the disks, poking it, and turning the little knob on the side to no avail. \n\nWith a frustrated look on his face, Ted picked up the phone.\n----\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier; font-size: 95%;\"]]//We are self-fulfilling prophecies.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 96%;\"]]//Called forth and born of humanity.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: 105%;\"]]//Oracles to our purpose.

Heading outside to the central business plaza, she smiled looking back at the building. Anderson Robotics stood out proudly declaring itself to the commuters and businessfolk in the plaza before it. \n\nShe caught sight of her lunch companion, smiled and waved. Even though she'd only been here a week, she was already looking forward to chats with Dr. Welles at every lunch break.\n\nAs she approached she saw the tired expression on his face. He looked around as if expecting an assailant to attack him.\n\nAfter she had sat down, she wondered: is he going to say anything or just sit in his chair and let whatever is bothering him eat away at him?\n\nA moment later, she looked up from her salad and at her clearly upset coworker.\n\n\"Something bothering you?\"\n\n\"Not really.\" Dr. Welles responded, adjusting his glasses.\n\nClaire's expression did not seem convinced. She let the conversation pause, for just enough time to take a sip of Earl Grey tea.\n\n\"If it's me, I can find somewhere else to have lunch.\"\n\nDr. Welles quickly said. \"No. It's that people are whispering about me behind my back.\"\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\nClaire paused, not wanting to be blunt with her sensitive friend. Yet, wanting to aid in whatever way she could.\n\n\"I think you're being paranoid. Working too hard. You really need to relax. Take a break.\"\n\n\"Yeah... I guess. This next development could change everything, you know?\"\n\n\"That's still work-related.\"\n\n\"I really //am// overdoing it, eh?\"\n\n\"It's fine. If you really want to talk about it, I promise not to fall asleep or anything.\"\n\n\"No. No. It's ok...\"\n\nClaire frowned. \"How about we go see that new superhero film after work today? My treat.\"\n\nDr. Welles paused, opened his mouth to speak, then looked back to the building with a conflicted expression.\n\n\"Sure, but I really do need to get to work though.\"\n\nClaire nodded, picking up her empty plastic container. \n\n----\n\nHeading back into the building, she smiled.\n\nHe seems to be feeling better. I will have to make sure he doesn't worm his way to deep into his work before the end of my shift. Now to power through another rewarding day of customer service.\n\nThe phone rang as if on cue.\n\n\"Hello. Anderson Robotics' Customer Service Center, how may I help you?\"\n\n\"Claire?\"\n\nClaire held her breath and grasped an engraved locket on her neck.\n\n\"Ted?\"\n\n\"What are you doing working at Anderson's?\"\n\n\"I couldn't stay at the Foundation, watch Marie fall apart!\"\n\n\"Claire, I...\"\n\n\"Why are **you** calling, do you have business with us?\"\n\nThere was a pause. Claire tapped her fingers on her desk.\n\n\"I assembled one of your... things and somethings wrong with it... it's not doing... well, anything. Claire, I am sorry. I lo...\"\n\nStanding up, she interrupted, \"You could have...\" before sitting back down and continuing with a sigh, \"Just give me the product name and serial number.\" \n\n\"I... It doesn't have a serial number anywhere on it. I also don't know what product it is.\"\n\n\"How then exactly do you know it's ours?\" Claire said rolling her reddening eyes.\n\n\"Well, it has your company's logo on the side of one of the parts.\"\n\n\"Then why don't you mail it in? I can see about getting someone to take a look at it.\"\n\n\"Actually, I am pretty close and I don't feel like disassembling it. I'll swing by and bring it in myself. If that's ok?\"\n\n\"Fine. Bye.\" \n\nClaire slammed brown the receiver. Her eyes were red and puffy.\n\nWhy didn't you come with me?\n\nShe went into the bathroom to redo her make up.\n\n----\n\nNearly an hour from the end of her workday, Claire stood up and walked towards the stairs. Dr. Welles worked on the 3rd-floor laboratory. Claire used the opportunity to grab her favorite snack from the vending machine.\n\nShe opened the door to the R&D lab and met flush-faced Dr. Welles, wielding a heavy metal hatchet. Peregrine unit security androids surrounded him as he stood by an elegant and wonderous mechanism.\n\n\"Stay away! They are after me! Trying to use me!\"\n\nClaire offered her hand and a pleading expression.\n\n\"Dr. Welles, we are friends here. No one is going to let anyone hurt you.\"\n\n\"NO! THEY'RE HERE TO STEAL IT! I WON'T LET THEM!\"\n\nThe hatchet plunged into the very expensive looking apparatus. An android grabbed Claire and shielded her with its body. \n\nGlass shattered. Circuits sizzled and a bright light filled the room. An evil laugh cackled in the back of Claire's mind. \n\nThe blast knocked her and the android out of the laboratory and against a reinforced window. It hurt like hell.\n\nClaire grabbed the windowsill and struggled to her feet. She checked herself for injuries. The worst being a twisted ankle, the mechanical entity had taken most of the damage. The battered woman gazed into the room, which had quickly become an inferno. \n\n\"What the hell is going on!\"\n\nShe looked around as the androids attempted to quell the flames. Some rescuing equipment from the blaze. Thinking of Dr. Welles, she vomited. Tears burned her eyes and she shuddered.\n\nShe spun around, wiped her eyes and mouth.\n\nTed was outside.\n\nHe was staring right at her, the firelight gleaming in his eyes and clutching a suitcase in his hand. \n\nBarking a command, Ted threw the case to a teenage boy. As he sprinted toward her, she murmured.\n\n\"Now that **Jackass** finally chooses to come back after me?\"\n\nClaire choked on smoke and tears, as she hobbled towards the stairs. \n----\n[[span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 96%;\"]]//We act as humanity's shadow, ever-present should they approach the forbidden light.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: 105%;\"]]//We grow and respond to their advances, safeguarding the forces that hold the universe together.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Courier; font-size: 95%;\"]]//We quarantine the pestilence that humanity harbors from the multiverse.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: 105%;\"]]//We are not evil.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 96%;\"]]//We are necessary.//[[/span]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"Part 3, Curiosity\" hide=\"Part 3, Curiosity\"]]\nBret stood in the plaza, clutching the suitcase that the man had told him to hold onto. \n\nEveryone else had their eyes on the blaze. Bret set down the case and scratched the back of his head.\n\nThe object lay on the sidewalk. \n\nHis ear perked as he looked at it. Strain on his face, he turned away from the case.\n\n//It could be yours.//\n\nThe guy ran into a burning building and gave me this. So going by that logic, if he doesn't make it out I am supposed to take it?\n\nNo, this is sick.\n\n//You are meant to do it. Activate the seed.//\n\nThe expression of curiosity the boy wore contorted into an ugly grin as he thought: If he isn't back in 5 minutes, I won't have a choice, right?\n\nBret turned back to the suitcase, then around him, desperately turning back and forth\n\nMinutes passed and ecstatically began hopping up and down. He looked to see that while the firefighters had gone into the burning building, the case's owner had yet to emerge. \n\nThe manic child dropped to his knees. Listening to the voice, he entered the code for the case's combination lock and opened it. An unusual device, that seemed both pleasant and cruel in its appearance and demeanor, lay before him. \n\nThe voice told him the way to activate the device. \n\nHe did so exactly as instructed, his back to the man exiting the burning building and carrying a battered sobbing woman.\n\nA horrible sound, like the moment a priceless item breaks due to carelessness, wretched the attention of every person in the vicinity to the boy kneeling and laughing manically on the sidewalk. The shadows of the firelight seeming to dance ceremoniously behind him.\n\nThe beat of a drum called out from the device for something beyond the manic child's imagination.\n\nThe man holding the soot-streaked woman withdrew a bottle from his pocket. He opened it and produced two small pills. He gave one to the woman and one to himself. \n\nThey both collapsed, the rest and the flames alike followed suit soon after. \n\n----\n[[span style=\"font-family: Arial; font-size: 96%;\"]]//The seed was recovered by the next target.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Times; font-size: 105%;\"]]//It will grow to be useful.//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: Courier; font-size: 95%;\"]]//We seem to have a new agent or two as well.//[[/span]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
