It's got a big brass loudener(?) and a wooden box at the bottom with the spinner on top. It's probably pretty old\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYep! This is beautiful.\n\nIt's concise, solecistic, streamlined and efficient. Everything you need to know in just a few words. This — what you've written today — will revolutionise the way the Foundation writes articles, forever. You'll make it to Class 4 in no time.\n\nYou know what? Let's tell the Site Director that you've sorted everything out.\n\n> **To:** Site Director (Site-39)\n> \n> **From:** Researcher ████ ████████\n> \n> Hi Amanda,\n> \n> I've cracked it. SCP-3939 is done.\n> \n> My final article is attached. Please have a read. I'll be glad to receive a commendation from the O5s after you forward it to them.\n> \n> Thank you!\n> \n> Researcher ████ ████████\n\nWith a broad grin on your face, you rise from your chair and waltz out of your office. As you make the walk towards the car park — to begin your well-deserved journey home — you imagine hordes of lesser researchers blossom from within all the offices you walk past, cheering, praising your name.\n\nOn your way out, the guy in the security booth gives you a knowing smile. //Maybe he already knows.// The roads are empty on your way home. You walk into your house, sit down, and smile.\n\nYou're done. You deserve this victory.\n\nYou sleep like a log.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/13 Go to work in the morning.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
