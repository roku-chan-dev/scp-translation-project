And this will be the... final? (Pausing) Yeah, final journal log.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(Pause.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Should we should try and keep things nice and short?//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Well, I mean -- sure. You're the one who wanted to make this after all.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(Rs. Rainer chuckles.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//You're right. I did.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(Silence for several seconds.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//It's been almost 30 days since we resurfaced from diving. Since then, we have lost all but 3 personnel. This, of course, doesn't include the previous Dr. Kaiden Sinclair, who we later realized was not the actual doctor.//\n\n//Do you want to explain this part, Lauren?//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Uh, sure.//\n\n//After some investigation into Dr. Kaiden Sinclair and the \"Project 'PARASYTE'\" precursor study held before Project 303-13, we eventually learned that he had been compromised by a parasitic anomaly. This parasite was able to then transfer itself into the Noosphere along with the rest of us -- presumably infecting it and the rest of all human perception.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//With the obvious exception for us. Even though we, uh, still don't necessarily know why yet.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//We'll definitely need to spend some more time trying to piece it all together.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(More silence.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n//That isn't everything you wanted to say, is it?//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Unless you wanted to mention the little... \"thing\" we have going between us, maybe.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Zach. Not now, please. There are more important things we need to worry about.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(It goes silent once more.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//We can, uh, we can discuss that later then.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(He clears his throat)//\n[[/=]]\n \n[[<]]\n//Oh, right, all of the anomalies that surrounded us before are gone. Completely vanished, I mean. Our best guess is that Dr. Sinclair was the primary anomaly, and wasn't able to transfer himself to another host before dying.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(Dr. Jeane vocalizes in the affirmative.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Which means our next task will be turning things back to normal.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Hopefully there's a solution that doesn't turn us into lab rats or corpses as soon as we return things back to the way they were. If that's even possible at this point?//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//There is. We'll just need to explore our options.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//You make it sound so easy Zach.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Well it's not exactly rocket science.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//What are our options then? For making things go back to normal?//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//We can try to live things out and hope for the best.//\n\n//Or we could jump ship -- find some anomaly that can take us back in time, switch realities, anything really. The world's our oyster.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Have you talked to Aaron about it?//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//It wouldn't matter if I did, would it? Not like we have any other things to do here.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n//So, that's the plan then?//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[<]]\n//It's all we need.//\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(Pause)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n//Should we go ahead and end this here then? Not like it has much of a point anymore.//\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n//(He chuckles.)//\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n//Right. Yeah... it's probably best we stop recording.//\n[[/<]]\n\n**{{[END LOG]}}**\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@<>>@ {{No more documents can be found.}}\n\n@<>>>@ {{logout}}\n\n@<>>@ {{Are you sure you'd like to continue? y/n}}\n\n@<>>>@ y\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@<>>@ {{Acknowledged.
