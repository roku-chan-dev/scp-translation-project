Following the initial exploration of SCP-8724, personnel are forbidden from entering the premises. RAISA is to regularly check Foundation employee records for signs of decay. \n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**Description** \n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n SCP-8724 is an abandoned building in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua. The structure is composed of a single floor of residential space, with no evident anomalous characteristics from the exterior. Recording devices are inoperable within SCP-8724. Any attempt to photograph or record will have the resulting image appear through unknown means upon reviewing the footage.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=.\n|caption=INT. -- SCP-8724\n|align=center]]\n\nThere are no other known anomalous phenomena originating from SCP-8724.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\nIt is believed that SCP-8724 was first encountered by an unnamed member of the Department of ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓, who failed to report the anomaly to his superiors following an excursion into the structure.\nFollowing the agent's death during an unrelated incident, a series of files were discovered amongst his effects, which detailed a number of encounters with anomalous phenomena that went unreported to the Foundation dating back 15 years.\n\nThe content of these reports was composed of largely incoherent information, with little discernible data and pronounced aberrations in both style and language. Due to the nature of the agent's work, and a limited number of accounts that could be corroborated, an investigation was opened into the matter, uncovering a number of anomalies, including SCP-8724.\n\n▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓, ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓. ▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓.\nAfter a rudimentary perimeter was established, Foundation Agent Jon Delacroix was tasked with exploring SCP-8724 in order to determine ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓▓ ▓▓ ▓▓▓ ▓▓▓▓▓▓. The exploration failed to produce any data of note, and SCP-8724 was classified Safe. For archival purposes, a transcript of the exploration log is available within this file.\n\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**Addendum-8724-A** \n//Exploration Records 02/06/2024.//\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Audio Log - 02/06/2024**\n-----\n= **RECORDING START**\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n= //The sound of a metallic door opening is heard.

Upon listening to the recording, he failed to provide an explanation for the sounds heard in the final minutes of the tape, which were attributed to SCP-8724 interior. Subsequent exploration of SCP-8724 failed to confirm the main findings of the initial exploration log, namely, any extraspatial anomalies within the structure. No furnishings or windows are present within SCP-8724.",
