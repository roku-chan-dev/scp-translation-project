Sometimes she likes to stand on things to pretend that she is taller than me. I like being taller, but it makes her happy so I let her.\n\nShe plays games with me, but I usually win. Sometimes she cries when I win. I don’t like when she cries. I let her win after that so she won’t cry anymore. I like it when she doesn’t cry.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nHe has greenish brownish eyes and is tall. He’s really good at games. Sometimes I beat him, but I think that he lets me. Maybe I’m just getting better at games. \n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nI found out he’s a little younger than me. That’s why it’s weird that I’m still shorter than him. I asked Mommy why he was taller than me, but she said he isn’t real. But I know he is - we play together every night.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nWhen I told Daddy, he said that I need to grow up and stop playing with my imaginary friends. But she isn’t imaginary. If she’s imaginary, how would we be able to play patty-cake? Or how would I be able to beat her in Candyland?\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nToday we played cards - she finally beat me for real! When I told her I didn’t let her win, she was so excited. She was smiling so big and her eyes were all big and happy. I laughed at her because she looked so funny and happy. She didn’t get it though, so I said I was sorry and we played cards some more. I hope she beats me again.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nI finally beat him in a game! I was so happy! I didn’t have to cheat or anything! I think I am very good at card games. He hasn’t beaten me at them ever, and we played a lot. He laughed at me when I won the first time, but it was a nice kind of laugh, I think. He said sorry when I gave him a look, so I think he wasn’t trying to be mean.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nToday I began high school, and I told him all about my first day. He was very interested. I told him how scared I was for the next day because I didn’t know many people there - he told me he wished he could help and gave me a hug. He gives good hugs, warm and strong. I hope we hug again soon.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nShe started high school today, and I couldn’t stop thinking about how weird that must be. She told me all about it later that night, how she felt small in such a big school and how no one was familiar. I felt sad knowing that she was sad - I gave her a hug. She is soft and warm and nice to hold.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nShe gave me some tips for my first day of high school today, and they really helped me out. I told her how her advice kept me from panicking when I couldn’t find my locker or when I had no one to sit with at lunch. She was wearing her gym clothes when we talked that night, but she still looked pretty. She invited me into her room for the first time and we sat on the floor while we talked. We helped each other with our homework. When I helped her get an answer right, she smiled. It was nice.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nI didn’t tell him how scared I was for sophomore year. He started freshman year today and I wanted him to be as focused as possible. That horrible girl from last year stole my outfit when I changed for gym class - I had to go the rest of the day in my gym uniform. He told me I was still pretty. I invited him into my room and we did our homework together.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nThat horrible girl stole my backpack and put it in the toilet. Today I cried at school and when I got home. When I told him about it, he seemed mad and invited me into his room. He gave me a hug and told me he would help me through it. I felt safe in his arms. I feel safe with him.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nToday I found out she is being harassed. I have never felt so angry in my entire life. I want to keep her safe. I want to keep her happy. I hate when she is upset. I held her tightly and told her I would help her deal with it. I rested my head on top of hers. Her hair is soft and smells like vanilla.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nShe tastes like strawberry lipstick.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nHis lips are soft and his hair is thick.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nI slept in his bed tonight.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nHer skin is smooth and her eyes are green and piercing. She is beautiful when she sleeps.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nToday, my father saw her going back through the wall.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There is a boy who lives inside of my wall.**## \n\nHis father called the police.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**There is a girl who lives inside of my wall.**##\n\nShe looked even more afraid than before when it was not the police who came.\n\n------\n\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n@@\n\n\n##f263e1|**There was a boy who lived inside of my wall.**## \n\nThere is a cold, metal barrier where I used to see him.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**I slept in this morning.**## It was Saturday.\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There was a boy who lived inside of my wall.**## \n\nHe wasn’t there this time when I cried.\n\n------\n\n##0044b2|**Sunday is always the worst because my father makes me go to Church.**##\n\n------\n\n##f263e1|**There was a boy who lived inside of my wall.**## \n\nNow he is gone\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
