Make the spooky indistinguishable from what is real. Every step of the way, the reader should think: \"Well, that's a little strange, but...\" You're wedging your way into their heads, prying open their minds to make room. Start small.

Now, with the space you've made, squeeze in something //absolutely dreadful//. An idea, an event, a conclusion -- anything. Whatever it is, it can't be //too// strange, but it has to be strange enough -- it has to fit precisely into that space you've created.\n\nThis works best when you can establish the conclusion by providing a tiny detail that lets the reader fill that space themselves.\n[[/collapsible]]\n**[[[Abwesenheit]]]  [[https://youtu.be/BpaRouocBes ♬]]**\n@@    @@//But the author was never alive.

Oh, and the iconic //Faces of Death//, of course.\n\nThe trick with this one was convincing the reader that the very obvious twist wasn't coming.

It is, however, one that I've found to be highly effective.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Advice]]\n\n**Never throw water on a grease fire.** Water expands by a ratio of approximately 1:1600 when it boils at atmospheric pressure. This means every drop of water hitting that burning grease is instantly exploding into a ball of steam //over one thousand times larger// than the initial droplet. In other words, you will turn a grease fire into a flaming hurricane of burning oil and death. \n\nInstead, snuff the fire by putting something over it (like a metal plate). If you have no other option, use a CO,,2,, or chemical extinguisher (//not// a water extinguisher -- also, don't aim //into// the grease; just sweep across the top).\n\n----\n\n**Whenever you compare yourself to another author and find yourself lacking, just remember this:** Your unique background and set of experiences equips you to write stories they can't. There are stories inside of you that //only you and you alone// can tell. No one can take that away from you.\n\n----\n\n**Don't use hydrogen peroxide or rubbing alcohol on a paper-cut.** Both of these chemicals evaporate very quickly, which removes moisture from your skin -- and part of what makes paper-cuts hurt so much and for so long is the skin drying out (causing the skin to retract, which in turn causes the cut to expand and deepen). Instead, immediately keep it moist with saliva (gross, but it works) until you can wash it off with some soap and water. Then, use petroleum jelly and/or an antibiotic cream beneath a small bandage to keep it clean, moisturized, and sealed. Chap-stick will also work in a pinch.\n\n----\n\n**Writing fiction is like exploring unknown territory.** There's no 'right way' to go -- just lots of wrong ways. People can give you some helpful directions, ideas, and even a few places you might want to visit -- but no one can tell you where you're going or how you're getting there. That's just something you have to discover for yourself.\n\n----\n\n**Never clean your cat-litter box with bleach.** Cat urine is filled with ammonia, and ammonia mixed with bleach produces [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorine_gas_poisoning chlorine gas]. Just use ordinary (bleach-free) soap, hot water, and a scrub-brush.\n\n----\n\n**I don't care how shoddily written a piece of writing is.** The author does not deserve to be ridiculed, mocked, or patronized. Don't do it -- and if someone tries to do it to you, don't put up with it.\n\n----\n\n**If you find yourself confronted by a wild bear, here's what you do:** Speak slowly and carefully, letting them know where you are and what you are doing at all times. Let them see your hands and arms. Don't make sudden moves. If they want to inspect you, let them; once they're satisfied, move (SLOWLY) away. Never run. Make sure you're paying attention to your surroundings: You do //not// want to get caught between a bear and her cubs.\n\nYou can find more bear-related safety advice [https://www.nps.gov/subjects/bears/safety.htm here].\n\n----\n\n**[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elements_of_Style The Elements of Style] (by William Strunk Jr. and E.

Try to get the most recent edition if possible (older editions will contain errors, on account of grammar changing). Alternatively, you can find a 2008 edition available for free online [http://vrici.lojban.org/~cowan/style-revised.html here].\n\nIt's an excellent guide to concise, technical writing.

The maximum sentence is 5 years in jail (8 if it's related to terrorism). This is why you should never talk to the FBI without an attorney present (if at all). Not even over the phone. It doesn't even matter if you're innocent of wrong-doing: They can just claim you lied to them and use this to pressure you into giving testimony against someone else. If you refuse, they //will// prosecute you and you //will// go to jail.\n\nAnd yes, this happens all the time. //Do. Not. Talk. To. Them.//\n\n----\n\n**Kurt Vonnegut once wrote 8 rules for writing.** He went on to state that all but one can (and often will) be broken. \"//Use the time of a total stranger in such a way that he or she will not feel the time was wasted.//\" \n\nThis is the only rule in writing you must not break. **//Never waste a reader's time.//**\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Author]]\n(@@   @@°-°)@@   @@┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°-°)@@   @@┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(°-°@@  @@)@@   @@┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°-°)@@   @@┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(╯°□°)╯︵ ┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°□°)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°□°)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°-°)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(°-°@@   @@)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°-°)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n(@@   @@°-°)@@    @@┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@      @@« (╯°□°)╯︵ ┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@            @@« (╯°□°)╯︵ ┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@                  @@« (╯°□°)╯︵ ┬──┬\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@                        @@« (╯°□°)╯︵ ┴──┴\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n┬──┬ ┬──┬\n┬──┬ ┬──┬\n┬──┬ ┬──┬@@              @@─(°□°─) »\n┬──┬ ┬──┬\n┬──┬ ┬──┬\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n[[size 75%]]\n[[=image hippo2.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n= //art by [[*user sunnyclockwork]]//\n[[/size]][[size 75%]]\n----\n[[div style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; text-align: center;\"]]\n[https://youtu.be/KnrGMHhnqrw But I'll keep coming]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author= The Great Hippo]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** small.jpg\n> **Name:** small.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user SunnyClockwork]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sunny-s-black-and-white-art\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
