I go by many usernames, but you can just call me Fluffy. It has always been a dream to write for this beautiful and dark universe. I'm thankful that people have enjoyed my work and that I'm even able to take the honor of having an author page in the first place.\n\nIn terms of my writing style, I usually like to write shorter pieces. I try to think of weird concepts and scenarios that would fit well into a cohesive narrative or buildup. If you're into more short/retro-styled pieces reminiscent of series 1-3, then I guess I'm your guy. \n\nOne thing I've learned from writing for this site is that if I don't have fun writing something, it probably won't survive on the site.\n\n**SCP Articles:**\n\n[[[SCP-5801|SCP-5801]]] - Snowman Heaven\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was my first successful SCP article, and it surprisingly got a lot of upvotes on the day it came out. While writing this article, I learned how to properly tell a cohesive narrative with a beginning and an end with the SCP format. I'm overall proud of how this one turned out. It was a great achievement both as a milestone in getting my first thing on the wiki and as a learning experience. While there are things I would definitely do differently looking back, I feel the article stands well on its own.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-5809|SCP-5809]]] - GG EZ GET CARRIED (Jamcon 2021 Day 1 Entry)\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI had so much fun writing this stupid thing. The idea of making fun of toxic tryhard gamers in an SCP article had already been swarming in my head, and this recent Jamcon gave me the opportunity to write it. The chat logs were directly inspired from experiences I've had playing multiplayer video games. People are fucking toxic for no reason man, especially in League of Legends. Overall, I'd say this article turned out exactly as I imagined it, and therefore I am really proud of it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-5378|SCP-5378]]] - Eternal Sunshine of the Spotted Beetles\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis is probably my strongest article in terms of conveying a strong narrative in a small amount of words. It's funny because I never thought that I would be able to to write a pathos/emotional article, but I ended up writing one as the fifth thing I've written on the site! I'm happy that the majority of people enjoyed it, and that it was able to be on the front page of the site in the Reviewer's Spotlight section for a while. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-6240|SCP-6240]]] - An Absence of Light (Deptcon Collab with [[*user crystalmonarch]] and [[*user nyelo]])\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was my first collaborative article, and I had a blast writing it. It's definitely on the longer side of things, which is usually not my specialty, but it's definitely easier when you have two other people working on the article section-by-section. If you're into block busters or disaster movies, I definitely would give this a read. It's by far the most cherished experience I have writing on this site.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-7060|SCP-7060]]] - A Place of No Fortune (7k Contest Entry)\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI will say this up-front: this is one of my weakest pieces. I really wanted to do something spooky and longer in length, but that's hard to do when the theme is \"luck.\" I kind of shoe-horned in the luck aspect of this anomaly, and I think it really brought down the piece as a whole. It also unfortunately falls into a lot of creepypasta/internet horror tropes that are really overused at this point. I think I will definitely rewrite this one in the future.\n\nIt was a valuable experience though. I learned that it's better to write to your strengths, and my strengths very much lie in getting ideas through quickly whilst still making an impression. When the next Kcon comes around, I won't try to go for the scope I was going for here. I'll probably write something shorter and less convoluted for my own sake. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-7092|SCP-7092]]] - So Long Space Cowboys (Coldpost Con 2023 Entry)\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nGay space cowboys. This was fun to write and really gave me confidence in my own writing. Seeing it get past +20 in the first day gave me clarity that I have enough intuition to make something impactful. Of course I don't think I'll make many coldposts after this one (lol), but this was a fun experience and challenge.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-7197]]] - Mr. Cigarette\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis is a very personal piece for me. I've struggled with depression for a long time and addiction sort of came with that naturally. I think I did a good job combining those two things in tandem with one another here. It definitely isn't everyone's cup of tea (as is with most of my work), but I think it works for the audience it's aimed at.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[SCP-8015]]] - A Fighting Chance (8k Contest Entry)\n\n**Tales/GOI Formats:**\n\n[[[The Death of an Arcadian|The Death of an Arcadian]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was both an assignment for school and a tale for the site. My Creative Writing teacher was kind enough to let me write for the site as well as for her class. The prompt was to have a story involving only one character in one room, and it had to be less than 500 words long. [[footnote]]I kind of cheated by having the main character kill somebody in the very beginning of the tale, but I asked my teacher about it and she said it was okay lol[[/footnote]] I decided to make this tale centered around the GOI Arcadia, as it was pretty dry of new content at the time. Overall I'm proud of how this one turned out, although there are some prose-related things I might want to change later. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[[A Culinary Broadcast|A Culinary Broadcast]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was another assignment for school that was also for the site. The prompt was to make a writing piece that digresses itself, and it had to be less than 600 words. Being distracted as I usually am with other stuff, I procrastinated on this assignment and had to write it the day it was due. I knew I wanted to do a VKTM piece at some point, so I figured I could make one for that assignment. So, I hit up [[*user Grigori Karpin]] at night and asked him to take a quick look after I wrote it. He gave me some valuable feedback and said that it was site-ready as soon as the tweaks he recommended were made. I'd say I'm pretty proud of it since I was able to come up with a load of symbols and an entire monologue in such a short amount of time.  \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[[A Bad Miracle|A Bad Miracle]]] (Deptcon Entry)\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nTo be honest, this was rushed before the contest deadline to make sure our group had enough pieces to qualify. I think it's fun for what it is, but it's definitely not my best work.\n[[/collapsible]]\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
