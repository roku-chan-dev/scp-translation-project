Photographer unknown.|width=300px]]\n**Item #:** SCP-001\n\n**Object Class:** Apollyon\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to its nature, SCP-001 cannot be contained. Survivors of the SCP-001 event stationed within secure facilities are to remain in contact with one another. Personnel are encouraged to attempt to reach --Site-5--[[footnote]]Personnel are to be reminded that there is no [[[scp err0r|Site-5]]].[[/footnote]] Site-19 by any means at their disposal. Personnel with knowledge as to the whereabouts of the O5 Council are to relay this information to the Administrator.\n\nSurvivors attempting to travel outdoors must fully cover their bodies in protective clothing; preferably several layers. Travel by foot should be limited as much as possible. Cities - and man-made structures in general - provide the greatest protection. Formerly-wooded areas should be circumvented. Travel by air is preferable above all other methods.\n\nPersonnel exposed to SCP-001 are to be considered lost. Compromised personnel are to be abandoned. Euthanization is not to be attempted.\n\nCollective instances of SCP-001-A that are of formidable size are to be avoided at all costs.  Conductive electrical weapons have proven partially effective at immobilizing instances, and may be used for self-defense. Incendiary weapons work as well. Cryonic munitions are the most effective thus far.\n\nTesting has revealed that SCP-001-A is relatively safe to consume. This is only to be considered as a last resort in the absence of other options. As SCP-001-A may reconstitute within the digestive system, only small portions should be consumed at a time to prevent blockage.\n\nPersonnel stationed at Site-19 are to pursue research concerning off-world colonization. Shuttles must be constructed as to not allow light to penetrate the interior.\n> [[size 115%]]To those of you with families, or God forbid, children - I'm deeply, deeply sorry, you must push on. Do not let their deaths be in vain. We do still have time.\n> \n> Humanity may still have a future. Come to Site-19. We need all the hands we can get.\n> [[image logo.png style=\"width:4em;margin:1em 1em 0 3em;float:left;filter:invert(95%)\"]]\n> **Learn to embrace the darkness, friends. Fear the light.**\n> [[>]]\n> //- The Administrator//[[/size]][[/>]]\n@@ @@\n**Description:** SCP-001 is the designation given to the Sun, after an event on {{[SYSTEM ERROR]}} [[size 85%]]//Data lost: ec172. Contact SysAdmin.//[[/size]] resulting in ~6.8 billion casualties within the first twenty-four hours. This event has been categorized as an XK-Î”-Class \"Solar Singularity\" Scenario.\n\nThe SCP-001 effect does not seem to result from exposure to ultraviolet rays, but rather light in the visual spectrum (~390 to 700 nm). The effect is similarly present in moonlight.\n\nUpon contact with visible light produced by the sun, living organisms liquefy at the point of contact, with the effect spreading until the entire organism is converted. Visually, this is reminiscent of melting wax. The time this takes is largely dependent on the level of exposure and size of the organism. Despite this restructuring, at no point do living organisms perish.\n\nUpon completion, these organisms (SCP-001-A) take on a gelatinous consistency. Motile organisms will attempt to orient themselves in a fashion reminiscent of their previous form, to varying degrees of success.\n\nFlora typically remain physically inert, yet are still capable of photosynthesis, and still produce oxygen. Organisms capable of flight lose the capability to do so. Fauna remain sentient, and display behavior that parallels their non-anomalous counterparts when not absorbed into a collective instance. Humans retain a modicum of sapience and memory.\n\nBiological anomalies exposed to SCP-001 are affected in the same manner. It seems that exposure nullifies any previously expressed anomalous characteristics.\n\nDue to their composition, instances of SCP-001-A that make contact with one another may combine and blend at the molecular level. This does not seem to cause any pain or distress to the instances, though the resulting bulk can inhibit movement. Since the SCP-001 event, most instances have congregated into such collectives, which seem to possess no maximum volume.\n\nThe resulting biomass is amorphous and chaotic. The component organisms will shift between a full-to-semi-liquid state - limbs and bodies will rise periodically from within the mass for a short duration, before deteriorating and being subsumed by another life-form.\n\nCollective instances will locomote by using their appendages in tandem to carry their mass. Larger instances will form a pseudopod from their constituent life-forms, and drag themselves about in a manner similar to amoeba.\n[[=]]\n##ff5512|+ Open attached file: Audio Log##\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n##ff5512|@@...@@##\n##ff5512|Access granted.##[[/=]]\n> A harsh static lashes out of the speakers when you open the file.

She pauses, takes a deep breath, and continues.\n||\"Due to Site-46's possession of several communicable infohazards - we have, we have been cut off from the rest of the network u-under Blackout Protocol.

Heh, heh.\"||\n> Logan shoots back.\n||\"Who? Wh- knock it off and put her on, dammit. I need to speak with her.\"||\n> There's a clamor on the other end while the radio changes hands.

Exhale.\n||\"I just wanted to check in real quick.\"||\n> Ari pleads.\n||\"I'm fine, babe. Really. I can take care of myself.\"||\n> A creak - Logan shifts in her seat.\n||\"No, no.

A large, wet, red-black blotch has formed on her breast-pocket.\n> \n>  She draws a shuddering breath, parts her lips as if to speak, and stops herself. She bows her head, and cries silently. After a minute, she manages to choke out:\n||\"I-I-w-we - the t-tunnel. _\n _\nFlowed in through the, through the ceiling, dragging, dragging them into the, the l-light and ripping off their, their clothes a-a-and@@...@@\"||\n> She reaches into her breast pocket, and withdraws a finger.

She looks up after some time. There's a look of realization when she sees she's still recording; before she places the digit back in her pocket. She leans forward, as if to turn off the camera, when a radio crackles to life.\n> \n> It broadcasts white noise for a few seconds, and then, a voice that sets you on edge.\n||\"Logan?\"||\n> It's Ari, almost. Her voice has taken on the disgusting, gurgling tone characteristic of the affected. Logan's jaw drops, what little color that was left in her face drains. It speaks out again.\n||\"Where are you? Why can't I get back inside? _\n _\nAre you there?\"||\n> Logan rummages beneath the desk for a moment, and produces a hand-held radio. Her hands are shaking. The thing implores her; its inhuman speech curdles your stomach.\n||\"Babe, it's alright. //I'm// alright, really. _\n _\nIt's a bright, sunny day and you're just wasting away down there.\"||\n> Logan is in tears, her finger hovering just above the call-button. The Ari-thing draws a deep, wet, breath and speaks.\n||\"Such a beautiful, clear blue sky - just like that day. Do you remember, babe?||\n> Logan withdraws a cigarette with her free hand, followed by a pack of matches. Her shaking thwarts the first two attempts to light it. She swears silently. Third time's the charm, and she inhales a quarter of it in a single drag. The Ari-thing continues:\n||\"It was so perfect. Everything was how I'd always dreamt it would be. You planned exquisitely.

It smashes somewhere off-camera. It's still somewhat operational - you can still hear the thing singing. More voices join in chorus as the radio slowly loses life. A few, a dozen, then more.\n||\"//Golden days,// _\n//In our hearts we remember them all else above// _\n _\nDays of youth and love\"||\n> They continue singing until the radio mercifully dies.

Her hair is thinning, with large swaths appearing absent from the middle of her head. If they weren't reflecting the soft glow of the monitor, you would have assumed she no longer //had// eyes, for how deep they'd recessed into her skull. She stares ahead, unblinking.\n||\"She won't stop. S-She won't go aw-away. I know I didn't, know I didn't pick up an info-fohazard browsing the archives. Tested my-myself for SCP-8673 infection. Negative. SCP-9189 is the, is the only other o-one that uses print as a vector. Can't b-be that, I still have all my fingers!\"||\n> Her lips crack into a broken grin. She lets out a weak laugh, and displays her trembling hands. What appears to be the mostly-skeletal remains of a finger is embedded into the flesh of her left hand - in the stump that would have supported her natural ring finger. Two wedding bands loosely encircle the digit, laying atop one another.\n||\"So, I'm not infected. I'm not, not, I'm, I'm not crazy. I know. I know the ritual worked. I know it's really her. It's her and she--\"||\n> Something catches her attention off-screen. She cocks her head, listening.\n||\"No! No, I c-can't! You're not, not you, not the same. Not you, it's not you anymore. Nope! No, no, no!\"||\n> She begins rubbing her temples, repeating herself over and over again. A minute passes. She snaps her head back up, and addresses the camera.\n||\"It's her but it's not. What I brought back - still a part of oh-one. There's no way. No way out. No way. _\n _\nThere's no hope for a future for me, and God, I can't go on like this any longer. _\n _\nI'll be safe here.
