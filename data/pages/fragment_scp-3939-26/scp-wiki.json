It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYou grab your keyboard and rip it off your desk. There's a moment of resistance — maybe a wire got caught — but it follows your motion. Carlos' expression turns from indignant, to anger, to fear. He raises his arm above his head and cowers down. You bring the keyboard down over him, expecting it to shatter, but the plastic only wobbles upon impact. Carlos winces and falls to the floor, and you are left standing with a keyboard in your hands and murder on your face.\n\n\"You //DICK!//\" Carlos cries, from the floor. He's clutching his arm.\n\nYou can't think of what to say, so you say the first thing that comes to mind. \"Rewrite the draft.\"\n\nYou immediately regret it. That was a stupid thing to say.\n\n\"I quit.\" he tells you. \"I fucking quit. I'm done here. I'm done with you. I'm done with 3939. I'm done with the Foundation. I'm done with fuckers like you getting to Class 4. You'll make a great O5 someday, you know that? Fuck you. Fuck you, ████.\"\n\nHe gets to his feet, still clutching his arm, and scrambles out of your office.\n\nYou take a moment to gather your thoughts.\n\nYou're still going to have to rewrite the article.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/18 Let's do that tomorrow. Time to go home.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
