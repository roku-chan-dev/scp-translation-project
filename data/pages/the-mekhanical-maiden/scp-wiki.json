Despite the technological supremacy of the Mekhanites in some respects, there was an unbridgeable void in their knowledge and development of complex computing and Artificial Intelligence (a conundrum they described as 'the Curse of the Mechanical Mind').\n\nSoraya was a once-in-a-lifetime creation, a robot with a mind so vast and sharp, it would have made complex AI constructs of today blush, if they could. She certainly could. The marvels of the engineers from Qaya-Ram[[footnote]] The 3rd great city of the ancient Mekhanites, next to Amoni-Ram (the capital) and Ulma-Ram (that's the military center). Qaya-Ram was famous for its technological prowess and their adoration of mathematics. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] I was there under the Seventh Emperor, cursed be his name. It was quite a beautiful city.

Good and bad alike. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxer\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++* **Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-mekhanical-maiden/Soraya.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border: solid 2px; border-style: outset; border-color: #333333;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\nSoraya. Illustration purportedly by one of her creators, one of the numerous drawings they depicted her on.[[footnote]]Other illustrations we saw included portrait sketches, candid paintings, and several other staged drawings, like this one. -- //Mersenne//[[/footnote]] Recreated based on info retrieved from her memory banks.[[footnote]] We weren't allowed to take photos of her while we were in Amoni-Ram, this was the best we could do. -- //Fungus//[[/footnote]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxer\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++* **Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Soraya was a robot[[footnote]] In today's understanding of the word. In the past, she was called a \"mekhanism\", an \"automaton\", or a \"knight/knightess\", by those unaware of her true nature. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] comprised of a fuladh shell,[[footnote]] Mekhanite type of beryllium bronze, said to be gifted to humanity by Mekhane herself. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]] copper-based circuitry, and a computational hardware not too dissimilar to the microprocessors we would see in modern computers. Just like everything else about her, it also vastly outperformed everything present modern technology. She had a complex computational node, which housed a memory of 580 zettabytes,[[footnote]] Filled up to 10.3% by the time of her deactivation. And she was running nonstop for more than three millennia! -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] Thankfully her caretakers were able to access her memories. They extract a handful of memory fragments each day. They even permitted us to witness the extraction process during our visit to Amoni. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] and a RAM of 4.3 terabytes. Her conversational response time rivaled that of an average human, and she was capable of producing results for the most complex of calculations near instantaneously. \n\nOutside her computational node, Soraya's other specific trait laid in her functionality beyond her mechanical mind. She possessed a wide range of augmentations, utilitarian (such as a little built-in oven, a small fridge, a heater apparatus, headlights, and a collection of retractable tools) or functional (solar panels and a charging cable)[[footnote]] Her memories indicate that in her final years, she depleted her reserve energy stores on purpose by retreating into the dark depths of the cave she called her home. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] If anything, that's a testimony to how crazy well engineered her power banks were. At the same time, I can't help but feel bad for her... Imagine wanting to die but going on for years and years because even though your main power sources are all gone, your battery still has way too much charge left in it. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]] in nature alike. \n\nAll of this made Soraya into what she was intended to be: a mechanical woman.[[footnote]] I suppose you could call her a veritable Swiss army knife built for wife stuff. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]][[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] H- -- //N.A.// [[/footnote]][[/span]][[footnote]] Not you. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-hr hr-contract hr-double\" ]]\n\n------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Nature:** While robots traditionally do not come with personalities, it was the brilliance of the Qaya-Ram scientists that Soraya was blessed with one. They engineered a never before seen personality matrix for her.[[footnote]] 2023 and we still do not have personality matrices... -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]]\n\nShe was programmed to be compassionate, curious, and eager to devour knowledge. Those primary traits were so ingrained in her that they persisted even long after her departure. Her team of caretakers at Amoni-Ram retrieved numerous memories of her sneaking, in the dead of the night, into various libraries close to her. She would spend her nights there, devouring all the knowledge she could get her hands on. When sunrise came, she sneaked out the same way she arrived, then rinse and repeat. All the way until she went through the whole library. \n\nAll those virtues, however, turned into vices: her compassion ended up driving her to become depressive and lethargic after she understood and internalized just how poorly Amoni-Ram treated women;[[footnote]] Amoni was notorious in this regard. Starting with the second Emperor Hashir, through the seventh Emperor Rustayl, cursed be his name, things were dire for women there. Did you know, there was only a brief period of time where women were allowed to study in the Academy? -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] And her state became even worse once she realized this runs way deeper than just Amoni-Ram. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]] her eagerness to devour knowledge turned her into a recluse.[[footnote]] She only spoke to some eight people following her departure from Qaya-Ram (me among them). Granted, her memories are still being uncovered, but I do not expect for this number to exceed ten. Her last direct encounter was with a woman named Aylin Utkan, in 1872. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] \n\nAnd her curiosity... Her curiosity was the exact thing that led her to her downfall.[[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] The over-emotionality of women strikes again, even with robots, the the pinnacles of cold calculation and logic. Did her creators honestly expect anything less when turning their magnum opus into a sniveling woman? -- //N.A.// [[/footnote]][[/span]] As testified both in //Further Travels// and in her own memories, Soraya disobeyed her instructions and listened in on a discussion of three Emissaries from Amoni-Ram. While she was forbidden from showing herself and talking to people from outside the Qayan Academy, she decided that just listening without ever showing herself would constitute as neither. And so she did just that, and what she heard was bad enough[[footnote]] You know how cis straight men talk about women when nobody is around? Yeah. Now imagine that times fifty, and place yourself in the boots of somebody who never even encountered the concept of misogyny up to that point. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] We chose not to share their exact words here. I do not think the reason behind our choice would be a mystery. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] that it broke her heart to the point she had to abandon her former life and depart. [[footnote]] How fascinating that the personality matrix allowed Soraya to obtain such complex emotions, and even commit a \"sin\" despite her synthetic nature. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-hr hr-contract hr-double\" ]]\n\n------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Records and memories indicate that Soraya was created by a group of 5 scientists in Qaya-Ram[[footnote]] Out of which two were women and three were men. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] Qaya never had any restrictions on who could study in the academy and they were a bit more lax with discrimination, so they had the largest percentage of female students:  25-37% total. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] who were engaging in underground science, to the point where their technology was developed enough that they would have been able to tackle creating an artificial intelligence. [[footnote]] Speculating why they did not desire to share their knowledge with the rest of Amoni-Ram is useless. They did not disclose their motives, Soraya never knew either, and so this record will not dwell on it. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]]\n\nSeveral prototypes were created before Soraya, all utilizing technologies such as glass or microchips, and all became personal computers used by the group.[[footnote]] Their operational system was dubbed MKHN OS by modern Amoni-Ram historians, as was the programming language they used. They even developed a file-sharing system, analogous to the modern e-mail. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]] [[footnote]] She was the sixth. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]]\n\nAnd as for why they created Soraya in the image of a woman despite the spotty relationship of Amoni-Ram with women, we will lend you the voice of one of her creators: \n\n[[div class=\"mz-paper\"]]\n(...) Creating her as a woman will not doom her to a life of eternal pain. Not unless //we// let it happen. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8600 Emperor Ansool] has shown that it is well within the capacity of us Mekhanites to treat women as equals. Therefore we, too, should show her, or ourselves, or our Academy, that the life of a woman does not have to equal suffering. \n\n**-- //Shadei//, one of the creators of Soraya. Information retrieved from her memory bank.**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-hr hr-contract hr-double\" ]]\n\n------\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Approach:** Since Soraya is perfectly inert and is in good care in Amoni-Ram custody, no special approach is required. Her caretakers informed us that as soon as they re-activate her, they will try to integrate her into the modern society of Amoni-Ram.\n\nOne thing anybody handling Soraya would definitely need to take into consideration, though, would be her distrust towards men. We proposed to her caretakers that whenever she's reactivated, it would be best for the room to be primarily filled with female researchers, to ease her back into existence.[[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] What nonsense is this? Fear is the mind killer. You cannot live in fear forever. I think the room should be filled with male researchers instead, to help her get accustomed to men. -- //N.A.// [[/footnote]][[/span]] They agreed, for which we are very grateful.[[footnote]] You know, even the fact that they agreed is huge and shows that Amoni-Ram made progress in regards to this. Had this occurred during the sixth or seventh Emperors, her contemporaries, they would not have afforded her this. On the contrary, they would have filled the room with men, just to mess with her head, and they would have cited fear or prejudice as a mealy-mouthed excuse. I've seen them do this to escapee women and it was NOT a pleasant sight. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] Oh god... I'm scared to even ask. -- //Fungus// [[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxer\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++++* **Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-paper\"]]\nShe... She lives! Oh, Mekhane, we made it. With your blessing, we made it. \n[[>]]\n**-- //Jawahir//, one of the creators of Soraya. Information retrieved from her memory bank.** \n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-paper\"]]\nAnd after she filled up the basin within her cave with fresh cold stream water, while I was awaiting her to heat it up with her in-built heater apparatus (borne of the same mekhanisms as the rest of her body), she continued her story as such: \n\n\"The words of the Emissaries still filled me with great disgust, Massoud,[[footnote]] That was what I used to go by when I met her. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]]\" said she. \"And as I ran from Qaya, I remembered what poor Latifa told me, about her husband. I was so distraught, you see, so lost in despair and the lack of hope. \n\n\"Did I make the wrong choice to disobey my orders and listen in on the Emissaries? I may have. But why did my Creators keep the truth from me? Why did they not share the cruelties of this world with me? Did they think I would have never found out? If it was not twenty years since my birth, it would have been two hundred, or two thousand, but I would have... I would have. \n\n\"And Massoud, I //have// returned to Amoni after my departure. I wanted to see if it truly was as rotten as the three Emissaries made me believe. Three are not three million, after all. I was foolish enough to believe, in the depth of my mekhanical heart, that they were merely three examples of the extreme.[[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] Generalization... The weapon of the feminist. As a robot, I expected Soraya to be smart enough to extrapolate that three Emissaries do not the entire male population make. -- //N.A.// [[/footnote]][[/span]] And so, I snuck into Amoni, assumed the shape of a statue, and observed. \n\n\"And I saw men brag about the misdeeds they inflicted upon their wives, as how the three Emissaries bragged. I saw their wives weeping in misery, as how the wife of the Grand Emissary wept, and even saw them vow to take their own lives. I saw beggar men beaten up by rich men and the guards, and I saw unspeakable acts committed upon beggar women by all three. \n\n\"I stood still for three months and three months more, and cried tears for all the suffering of women I had to bear witness, from the poorest to the richest.[[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] Not surprising to find out that she, too, only saw herself as perpetually oppressed because she was comparing herself to high status men, instead of the low status men who had it even worse than her. She probably didn't even see low status men as hu- [[/footnote]][[/span]][[footnote]] ENOUGH. Enough. For all that is holy, enough. Leave us alone. Shut up. Shut //up//. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]] And I vowed to run away, never to return.\" \n\nAnd the rise of sun was fast approaching, so Soraya left the cave to \"charge\", that was the word she used, the life-force of her body with the rays of the sun above. \n\nHaving sit in her tub and contemplate the story she told me so far, I have furthermore come to the conclusion that it is, indeed, a great honor that Soraya took me, a man, into her trust. For as much as having me enter her cave and use her amenities, and having her converse with me.[[span class=\"na-note\"]][[footnote]] Mandeville should have had more self-respect. Being let into the goodwill of a man-hater as a man is not something I'd consider an \"honor\". -- N.A.

Conversation retrieved from her memory bank.**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mz-paper\"]]\nA most peculiar sight greeted me then, dear. A figure clad in metal, which could have been a knight, or could have been one of the Angels, took me gently, and helped me walk somewhere as I was losing my power to walk on my own. \n\nWhen I came to, I was sitting in her cave (I have later found out it was a woman), somewhere deep in the mountains. She was holding a bowl of fruit in front of me, and I screamed in her face and tried to run away! It was so silly of me. She just tilted her head at me, and the shape of a question mark formed on her face (which was as smooth as glass). That was when I understood I shouldn't have run from her. She's safe. \n\nSo I sat down next to her, and we talked. She told me she was a machine with a spirit (but she really was an Angel inhabiting an armor. I would know for sure!) and asked me some things about my life. And I spoke, of course. You remember why I ran, right? I told her that. I told her more, too. Life in my village and such. \n\nWe sat in silence for a while, after which she said something like \"I see how it is\". Her face no longer displayed a question mark, or an expression for that matter. It was empty, and it scared me. \n\nI knew she wouldn't hurt me, though. She just stood up, stumbled towards the opening of her cave, and looked back at me. I could tell, even through her blank face-plate, that she was crying. \n\nI kept her company for a week after that, where she fed me, clothed me and bathed me, and in turn I sat with her and comforted her. \n\nWhen I was ready to depart, she handed me all her belongings in a rolling case. I did not understand why she wanted to part with them, but she insisted, and so I accepted, because I did not want to reject the gifts of an Angel. \n\nIt was enough to last me to get to the town next to yours, from where I am writing you this letter. I still have some left over, nearly over a half. We will meet in perhaps a month, and I will share her belongings with you. \n\n[[>]]\n**-- letter from one Aylin Utkan to her friend Fatma, //The Unseen Women of the Middle East//, by Joumana Al-Mardini[[footnote]] You'll never guess who. -- //Mersenne// [[/footnote]][[footnote]] WHAT??

Her caretakers charged her battery and brought her shell to pristine condition, and yet there is no sign for how to actually activate her. Our only hope is that her caretakers will, by chance, discover her blueprints in the cursory vision of her memories and will be able to deduce her activation out of them.\n\nI really hope me and Fungus will be invited to witness her activation, whenever that happens.
