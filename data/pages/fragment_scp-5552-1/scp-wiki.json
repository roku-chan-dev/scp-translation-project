Information contained herein has not been confirmed.**\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**Event Summary:** On 2020/04/14, the database at Site-72 reported a series of unauthorized file creations and modifications, specifically to documentation regarding SCP-5552. All past information on SCP-5552 has been lost, and possibly erased from the minds of personnel assigned to the project, as no individuals can confirm that the SCP-5552 slot had been previously assigned to an anomaly. \n\nThe documentation itself has not demonstrated anomalous properties, however all have been tagged with an upload timestamp of 13:43:28, which is the same time as when Dr. Naman Gupta began a talk at the 6th International Conference on Physics titled \"A Comprehensive Theory On Bi-Directional Temporal Travel\". \n\nWhat follows are the documents that manifested as a result of this event. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5552/offset/1 Next document]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
