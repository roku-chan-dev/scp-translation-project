One official, one not; GoblinCon and RomCon specifically.\n\nGoblinCon's theme (or themes, as it would be!) deals with the infamous slot goblins which plagued our site a few years ago. For the uninitiated, slot goblins are broken SCP slots that could not host an article due to Wikidot's technical flaws. However, that was corrected, and the slots were opened back up on the anniversary of the first slot goblin being discovered. The themes of GoblinCon were Class of 76, Glitches, Fantasy Goblins, Battle Royale, and Deletions. You can find the winners and the entries [[[goblincon|here!]]]\n\n[[image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:slice-of-life-festival/judas-min.png]]\n\nThe second contest, Romcon, is exactly what you expect from the title; a Romantic Original Character Tournament! Sign-ups were initiated near the beginning of May and over 40 entrants signed up. The first round of the contest finishes June 4th, and the next round of matches will be decided by the matchmaker, [[*user UraniumEmpire]].
