The location of an SCP-6786 copy is to be sent to MTF-KAPPA-43 for immediate retrieval and destruction of said instance alongside the amnestization of its former owner.\n\nA copy of SCP-6786 is stored within a flash drive in a secure containment locker within the archives of Site-43. Attempts to contain pirated and backroom copies of the program continue.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6786 is a limited-run documentary series, entitled //Invasive Nature//, produced by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub Vikander-Kneed Technical Media (GOI-5889)]. The series focuses on the effects of humans on animal life and ecosystems, particularly those of an anomalous nature. SCP-6786 comprises four episodes focusing on varying locations, each approximately an hour long.\n\nSCP-6786-1 is the classification of SCP-6786's \"Narrator.\" They resemble a human male dressed in a white shirt, khaki shorts and vest, hiking boots, and an oversized camping backpack across their shoulders. Their facial features change between each episode, resembling various known avian life forms. Their mouth does not move when speaking, but the range of eye movement and microexpressions have concluded that it is not a mask.\n\nSCP-6786 contains a memetic compulsion that grows as the subject watches the documentary. It seeds the individual's mind with support for environmentally focused governmental policies, anger at large companies' exploitation of natural environments/climate change denial, and finally, support and abetting of eco-terrorism.\n\nSecondly, SCP-6786 alters the area where the observer resides, with the area of effect expanding compared to how long the media is observed. The radius extends up to thirty-five kilometers if SCP-6786 is watched to completion. Sightings of entities colloquially classified as \"cryptids\" incrementally increase afterward. This effect is ongoing and has yet to have an observed plateau. The most significant increase in sightings in the shortest amount of time caused by SCP-6786 interference was 230 recorded calls to local police in under an hour in ███████, Oregon. MTF-Gamma-4 investigated and discovered that the sightings were not a memetic effect but an increase in anomalous species within the region. Containment attempts are ongoing.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6786 was first discovered following its appearance on the streaming platform Netflix on July 20th, 2024, before it proliferated to other streaming platforms. The Foundation was first made aware of the object when riots broke out in several towns with major oil, natural gas, or coal refineries present, coinciding with increased online and radio chatter involving sightings of anomalous entities on July 24th.\n\n= **Addendum 6786-1: Introduction**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The video opens with a figure dressed in a white shirt, khaki shorts and vest, hiking boots, and an oversized camping backpack across their shoulders. Their face resembles that of an owl. They stand in the middle of a dry creek bed, fallen trees splaying out behind them. The faint sound of chainsaws and motors can be heard in the distance.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1 :** ##D4A017|Nature. Beautiful, isn't she?##\n\n//A tree falls in the background.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1 :** ##D4A017|Idyllic. Peaceful.##\n\n//An excavator can be seen moving in the background. The word \"Primera\" can faintly be seen on the side.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Silently crying out for retribution against those who bleed her dry.##\n\n//More sounds of falling trees punctuate their sentence.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Nature exists in a careful balance, with lynchpins and complex webs intermingling to craft the living, beating heart of the biosphere.##\n\n//They turn so they appear to be looking back at the ongoing deforestation behind them.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Seems like she's in need of a triple bypass, don't you think?##\n\n//They laugh and turn back to the camera.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|This four-part series will focus on a number of animal species attempting to make their way in this chaotic and changing world. It will examine the effects of environmental devastation, invasive species, and climate change and how they're doing their best to adapt to the shifting circumstances.##\n\n//Something massive barrels out of the woods in the distance and batters the excavator to the ground. The camera zooms in on the entity as it roars, bringing its full weight down on the machine. A titanic, almost cartoonishly proportioned hybrid moose and gorilla creature bellows at the sky as it moves to assault another piece of construction equipment.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|What a beauty.##\n\n//More begin to appear out of the forest, racing into the wider logging encampment.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Looks like they're coming out to meet the new neighbors. I can't imagine they talked to the HOA about these renovations.##\n\n//A crane is seized by three of the entities and sent careening through a small building.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Let's hope there isn't anything flam-##\n\n//The building explodes in flames.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Oop!##\n\n//People can be seen scattering from the scene as smaller, possibly infant versions of the entities chase after them and poke them with sticks. In contrast, the larger entities begin dancing around the flaming building.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Oh, a family BBQ! How nice! They just had to clear out the little bugaboos. What was I….

SCP-6786-1's face resembles that of a peacock//\n\n**The SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|You might be wondering, after that riveting opening speaking about the beautiful and embattled nature of well nature, why we are starting in a zoo in Ohio of all places. Well, there could be multiple answers, like draconian laws or Cincinnati chili! But you'd be wrong to think that friend.##\n\n//They reach up and apparently pat the camera. A clattering sound echoes from off-screen, and the camera refocuses on five shadowed figures moving toward the outer wall of the zoo.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|We're here because zoos the world over have become the territory of a new and dangerously //stupid// invasive species.##\n\n//The camera changes angle suddenly, and it now follows five figures dressed in black, their faces either covered in camo paint or ski masks.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|This small pack is part of what we most often call \"Anti-Zooers.\" While it is true that Antis are far from a new phenomenon within the human condition, let alone this particular breed, with the shifting climate, they have grown emboldened, proliferating much more openly. Personally, I blame school lunches.##\n\n//The lead turns around, looking directly into the camera for a second, but is not able to notice it.//\n\n**Lead Anti:** Are you ready to be legends, brothers and sisters?\n\n//The others nod.//\n\n**Lead Anti:** Right, who has the rope?\n\n//The others look at each other and back in confusion.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|As I said, emboldened yet far from enlightened. They certainly smell like they've been trying to get there, though.##\n\n**Lead Anti:** Guys?\n\n**Female Anti:** I thought you were supposed to bring it, Jeremy.\n\n//The leader, Jeremy, sputters.//\n\n**Jeremy:** No, Mara.  I allocated tasks to-did none of you look at the chore board?\n\n//The rest shrug and shake their heads. He also pauses and looks back at Mara, specifically her shirt.//\n\n**Jeremy:** Why are you wearing that?\n\n//The camera zooms in, showing a \"Primera TV\" logo on her shirt.//\n\n**Mara:** To... represent the c-\n\n//Jeremy shakes his head violently, and she stops talking, drawing confused glances from the rest of the assembled Anti-Zoo members.//\n\n**Jeremy:** To besmirch the name of our enemies with our good works—right, right. It slipped my mind.\n\n//He leans into her and whispers.//\n\n**Jeremy:** We're gonna talk about this later.\n\n**Mara:** I-\n\n**Jeremy:** Anyway, no one brought a rope?\n\n//They all shake their heads again.//\n\n**Jeremy:** Way to go, guys. You did a really great job. There was supposed to be this big mystery about—let's just hop the turnstiles. Ben's probably already lit the fuses by now.\n\n//The Antis follow after him, moving towards the main gate leading into the zoo, but the one at the back speaks up.//\n\n**Last Anti:** What about cameras? Also, shouldn't we not be saying our real names or something?\n\n**Jeremy:** We have nothing to hide, Phil. Our cause is righteous!\n\n//The others nod, pump their fists, and follow after Jeremy without further questioning. The camera zooms in on Phil's face.//\n\n**Phil:** But we're wearing masks.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Like lemmings, so the erroneous saying goes, they follow the leader towards a likely five-to-nine in a penitentiary. But one may have his wits about him. I think... he is here after all.##\n\n//They approach the turnstiles, crouching low to the ground, and the camera pans up to view a security camera looking right down at them.//\n\n**Jeremy:** Hold!\n\n//The others freeze suddenly, some numbing into the others.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Stealth does not come naturally to them. They are more used to being vocal, bellowing their truths into the uncaring air, awaiting an answer from those they //know// believe as they do. Rarely do they congregate in groups this large, in reality. Online is their true domain. Again, the smell is very telling.##\n\n//They wait in silence, some looking directly into the camera and not noticing it, while others anxiously tap their hands together/rub them on their pants.//\n\n**Mara:** What's taking so long? Someone is going to see us.\n\n**Jeremy:** This sort of thing takes time; trust Ben, he's a pyrotechnics expert.\n\n**Phil:** He works at carnivals.\n\n**Jeremy:** Yeah!\n\n**Phil:** On... on the kid ri-what do you think happens at carnivals, man?\n\n**Jeremy:** Predatory capitalism due to overpriced food and trips to the hospital due to heart attacks from said food.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|For once, the leader of the pack says something vaguely intelligent. But the main threat at carnivals is cannibal caramel apples, yes, sir.##\n\n**Phil:** I guess... but that still doesn't-\n\n**Other Anti:** Shut up, Phil. Why are you always questioning? I thought you cared about the cause!\n\n//Muffled agreements pass through the group. Jeremy grins at him.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|The leader delights in the smothering of common sense. If they started to think about their actions, they would realize what danger they had actually placed themselves in. Righteousness, especially this store-brand, pseudo-enlightenment flavor, fades fast in the face of reality. Like milk in the microwave.##\n\n**Phil:** I do! I just thought it was more planned out than this!\n\n**Jeremy:** The best part of any plan is to plan for it not to go to plan.\n\n//The others nod sagely, and the camera zooms even tighter on Phil's mask as he grapples with what he has just heard.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|You can see his brain fighting to take hold of him at this moment. Does he dare challenge the pack leader? Does he ostracize himself from those with whom he holds a common cause? Does he get fast food on the way home and feel bad about it an hour later?##\n\n//An explosion booms to the left of the camera, and it whirls to take in a flaring explosion of brilliant colors. Footsteps can be faintly heard echoing as they run in that direction.//\n\n**Mara:** Weren't they supposed to be in the air?\n\n//The fireworks are, in fact, going off at ground level; the camera zooms in and spots a figure running around, partially on fire.//\n\n**Jeremy:** He knows what he's doing, go, go, go!\n\n//They jump the turnstiles one after another, some faltering and falling, rolling ankles or falling flat on their faces.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|I reiterate that this is not their domain. They are no more fleet than they are stealthy. Persistence rewards many, but will this invasive movement prove victorious? I'm gonna say no, but the world does love surprises.##\n\n//They dart haphazardly through the zoo, moving deeper and deeper, until they reach their first enclosure, a shallow pool with an island in the middle where several flamingoes sleep, excluding one that is walking about the water, looking in the direction of all the previous commotion.//\n\n**Jeremy:** Here are the first prisoners we must liberate! We'll start with the one who is awake and then move on from there. Mara, Jeremy, you're with me; the rest of you fan out and keep an eye out!\n\n//They hop into the enclosure, and the camera approaches the railing and shifts around to view them from the side. They close in on the flamingo, who turns to look at them. It flairs its wings.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Common amongst birds, such a pose is meant to convey anxiety and anger. It means that the bird believes they are in danger. Or that they want to do the bedsheet samba, but I'm gonna go with danger.##\n\n**Jeremy:**  Look! It opens its arms to us, and it knows we have come to set it free.\n\n//The flamingo slaps at the hands of the protestors as they try to grab hold of it and move deeper into its enclosure.//\n\n**Jeremy:** It's okay, sh, sh, sh, we're just trying to help you.\n\n**Phil:** It's not a horse, dude.\n\n**Jeremy:** I'm just trying to comfort it; they know we're here to help.\n\n//The flamingo slaps him again and slips out of his grasp.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|It does not. The Anti-Zoo movement is curious in its motives. Outside its natural habitat of online forums and PETA conventions, it is unaware of social cues, both its own and those of the beings that it has taken a keen interest in. Its desire to fulfill its own needs overrides its general sense. I call that a cult, but don't say that to them, it offends.##\n\n//Jeremy fails to catch the flamingo one more time and has now backed it into a corner.//\n\n**Mara:** Just grab it!\n\n**Jeremy:** What does it look like I am doing? Poor thing. It is too broken by its time here to understand when people actually wish to help.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|And there we see a common trait of the Anti-Zoo movement, that animals, even those in the wild, have an innate understanding of what it means to be wild, yet paradoxically enjoy interactions with humans. Like an incel thinking women ruin the world yet want to date his pimply, saggy playdough body.##\n\n//The flamingo flairs its wings out and stands to its full height, clacking its beak.//\n\n**Flamingo:** Back off, cabrón!\n\n//The Antis freeze, staring at the flamingo.//\n\n**Mara:** It talks!\n\n**Jeremy:** I knew taking those edibles was a good idea!\n\n**Phil:** I didn't have any!\n\n**Jeremy:** Well, maybe you're getting like... second-hand.\n\n**Phil:** That doesn't make any sense!\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Oh, their blitzed! Sucked down some ganje goodies, some adding appetizers, some pot.... pieces. Right, ran out of steam, but this will //definitely// only go well.##\n\n**Flamingo:** Malditos toristas. What do you want?\n\n**Jeremy:** We seek to free you! To take you away from this place!\n\n//The bird stares at them each in turn for several moments.//\n\n**Mara:** You want that, right?\n\n//The bird starts making a noise and covers its head with a wing.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Have they caught the vibe?##\n\n**Jeremy:** He's crying in joy that we came to get him out!\n\n//The sound quickly becomes high-pitched laughter//\n\n**Flamingo:** Ha, muy divertido! Why the hell would I want to leave?\n\n**Jeremy:** Because you're in a prison?\n\n**Flamingo:** Prison?! Nah, man, nah, what, you want to take me back to the wild? Like out there?\n\n//He points with a wing above the walls.//\n\n**Mara:** We'll we'd try to get you back to Florida or-\n\n**Flamingo:** Florida?! That's worse than just the regular wilderness! Some addict would try to take my feathers for a loincloth or some shit. Mierda.\n\n**Phil:** You are both acting way too normal about this thing talking to us!\n\n//He backs away, heading to the edge of the enclosure.//\n\n**Jeremy:** It's the edible!\n\n**Phil:** Not how it works!\n\n//Several of the other Anti-Zoo people move closer, staring at the flamingo, amazed.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|They miss the vibe by a country mile, and fractures begin to form in the pack. Shame they're too innie-outie, heady-is-cloudy to realize problems are incoming.##\n\n//Fire sirens sound in the distance, causing panic to spread amongst the Anti-Zoo movement people.//\n\n**Jeremy:** Shit, this was supposed to just be the first st- come with us! We can take you anywhere!\n\n**Flamingo:** Niño, I get three meals a day, constant pampering, fawning attention, and any partner I want. Look over there, muy guapo y guapa, si? In the wild, I need to worry about finding food, finding shelter, finding a mate, and that's if some raggedy bitch doesn't eat my ass! Does it look like anyone around here is out to eat me? Well... cept Martin, that bastard.\n\n//The flamingo turns and yells at the nearby Reptile House.//\n\n**Flamingo:** I've seen how you look at me, Martin! Perro serpiente!\n\n**Jeremy:** You- you're brainwashed.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|And here we see the main defense of the Anti-Zoo movement and their numerous kin that inhabit the uncharted sweaty savannahs of the online: denial of reality! It keeps them safe in their bubble, which... is like the weakest form of defense in the world. Titanium plating would do so much more.##\n\n**Flamingo:** Brainwashed, bah, you don't know brainwashing I-\n\n//The flamingo freezes, having looked over to Phil, and looks up over his head where the camera is poised.//\n\n**Flamingo:** You brought cameras?!\n\n//The Anti-Zoo folks share a confused look.//\n\n**Jeremy:** No, I don't... what are you talking about?\n\n**Flamingo:** Why do you have cameras? Who are you? Are you Feds? Who are you with? You tell me who you are with!\n\n**Mara:** No, no, we hate the feds!\n\n**Jeremy:** We can take you literally anywhere! Cuba? There's a lot of flamingos in Cuba isn't-\n\n//The flamingo turns to him.//\n\n**Flamingo:** Did they send you?\n\n**Jeremy:** I-\n\n**Flamingo:** You come into my casa, and you try and make me leave, you tape me, you say that name. Nah, that ain't happening. No voy!\n\n//The Flamingo suddenly draws a switchblade as if from thin air and charges Jeremy!//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Having intruded into another's home, the invasives have put themself in needless danger. After how they comported themselves prior, will they be able to get out of this mess of their own making?##\n\n**Flamingo:** Perro! Herramienta! Mentiroso!\n\n//The camera jostles as the bird repeatedly stabs and cuts Jeremy, who flounders in the water screaming and then goes for Mara. The others hop into the enclosure to try and help her and their leader or contain the bird. Except Phil, as the bird slashes at all of his friends.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|The brightest amongst them is contemplating simply running away.##\n\n//Phil turns and blinks in surprise, seemingly able to see the camera person and SCP-6786-1 for the first time.//\n\n**Phil:** Who-\n\n//The flamingo races towards him, knife slashing, causing him to fall to the ground, scrambling backward with a scream!//\n\n**Flamingo:** I ain't going back!\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|But his momentary pause sees him join his fellows in a churning stew of meat and foolish ideation. Though graphic, that is one less invasive threat facing this curated yet important habitat.##\n\n//The screams get quieter and quieter as the flamingo turns to face the camera, and the image cuts to black.//\n\n[FINN]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[include component:image-block | name=VKTM-2.png | caption= Episode 2 Title Page | width= 700px | align=center]]\n\n**Date:** 04/20/2024\n-----\n\n[VIDEO BEGINS]\n\n//Redwood trees tower above the scene. The camera tilts up to take in the trees and then lowers to focus on a pair of well-dressed people standing alongside a small pile of climbing supplies, paint cans, and a set of small axes. A man dressed in an oversized jacket out of place for the weather, apparent in the video, is talking to another, holding up a small camera. Birdsong can be heard in the distance. SCP-6786-1's face resembles that of a raven.//\n\n**Unknown:** What's up, Dray Nation? We're here in the Redwoods, continuing our Dray's Sprays series!\n\n**Unknown:** I hate that name.\n\n**Dray:** Shut up, man, it gets us clicks.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Here, we see another more recent subspeciation of humans: The Influencer. Influencers, unable to exist on their own stunted form of self-actualization, seek attention from the faceless masses of the internet. Fame or infamy matters little to them in the end; all that matters is their main source of food: clout. Clout defines them, and the actions they take in their daily lives are fully centered on attaining more of them. Clout-Chasers, as they are often called in layman's terms, often begin doing more and more thoughtless and dangerous things in their hunt for clout, often to their detriment. Let's observe.##\n\n**Unknown:** Did you hear something?\n\n**Dray:** Come on, man, get it together. It's probably like... a moose or something.\n\n **Unknown:** The park rangers said-\n\n**Dray:** They'd fucking off for the rest of the day since I paid them so well; we're good!\n\n**Unknown:**  With those ones.\n\n**Dray:** Kaiden, chill out, dude. Money talks. Now, can we get back to the video?\n\n**Kaiden:** Alright, fine.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Clout chasing often leads to something known as the grift, where the Influencer will go out of their way to ensure what they desire, the increasing generation of their own clout, happens. This can lead to all manner of unsavory behavior, which a number of other entities in their ecosystem are unfortunately receptive to.##\n\n**Dray:** In the last video, which got a killer 200k likes, we managed to tag the Lincoln Memorial, more like Dreymorial, right? And while there was a bit of a “thing” around that, the haters couldn't keep us down!  So what would be bigger than that, you're asking? Well, for right now, we're not allowed to go back to DC, but-\n**Kaiden:** You're lucky we didn't get arrested!\n\n**Dray:** Come on, man, I was just getting the flow back.\n\n**Kaiden:** Sorry.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Influencers are often within a symbiotic relationship with another species we will be focusing on later in this documentary.

Something darts closer, peaking around the trunk of another tree; its face is that of an elongated deer skull.//\n\n**Dray:** And now, it's time to make my mark. Draynation represent!\n\n//He draws his axe and hacks into the bark, not getting very deep on the first strike. The branches quiver once more.//\n\n**Kaiden:** Put a bit more effort into it!\n\n**Dray:** Like you could do any better, dude.\n\n//He swings again and manages to sink his axe fairly deep; with effort, he manages to pull a chunk of bark free.//\n\n**Dray:** There's gotta be a quicker w-\n\n//He pauses as the whole tree shakes, and a low, pained moan is heard as the ground quakes and shifts. The tree pulls partially out of the ground, revealing a pair of massive eyes amidst a tangle of roots.//\n\n**Unknown:** Kenny!\n\n//The camera shifts, and the deer-skulled-headed figure is running towards them, revealing a nearly three-meter tall being, emaciated and bestial, wearing a flowing sundress and a wide sunhat between its antlers. Dray and Kaiden begin screaming. Dray scrambles to hold onto the tree, and Kaiden falls backward.//\n\n**Kenny:** Martha? I have a splitting headache; what's happening?\n\n**Martha:** Just a gnat, sweety, I'll get it for you.\n\n//She turns and looks at Kaiden, sniffing at him and licking her bony teeth.//\n\n**Martha:** Diabetic, yum. I love the jelly-filled ones. Don't you move, sweet thing.\n\n//She lungs up as Kenny pulls himself further out of the ground, and Martha effortlessly cuts the rope holding Dray aloft. He falls, and there is a sharp crack as his leg bends the wrong way, and several cans of spray paint burst, coating the ground in neon paint. His screaming goes to a different pitch. Martha drops to the ground beside him.//\n\n**Martha:** Oh, it went and made a mess.\n\n//A root reaches out and pulls him closer, the tree-being's wide eyes narrowing.//\n\n**Kenny:** Now, what were you up to? Coming into someone's place, climbing all over them, cutting them up, not very neighborly. What if someone did that to you, hmm?\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Making a claim on someone else's territory often leads to a great deal of strife within the natural world. There have been at least five different known Chimpanzee wars built on this premise, and well, we don't even need to get into what all of you do.##\n\n//Martha digs through some of Drey's spilled gear and comes up with the design, showing it to Kenny.//\n\n**Martha:** Were you going to carve this into my husband's forehead? Who raised you?\n\n//She looks up at Kaiden, and he goes to bolt, but he freezes as a different park ranger, a middle-aged woman, appears from behind a tree, pointing a rifle at him.//\n\n**Kenny:** Tch, tch. Now, wait a second, son. We've got some questions for you. Answer them honestly now: Sally doesn't take kindly to fibbers.\n\n**Sally:** That, I do not.\n\n**Martha:** What took you so long, darling?\n\n//Sally nods at Kaiden.//\n\n**Sally:** He knows, Mar.\n\n//Martha coos at the nickname and licks her bony lips as she turns back to Kaiden.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Murderous hippie monster polycule. Sick, that'll do well with the Zoomers.##\n\n//Kaiden slowly turns to look back at the entities and down to Dray.//\n\n**Kaiden:** What... what do you want?\n\n**Kenny:** Truth. ‘Bout what you're doing here. Not this little idiot mind, you.\n\n//All three figures stare intently at Kaiden while Dray rolls about at the ground, trying to get eyes on his cameraman.//\n\n**Dray:** What the fuck is going on?!\n\n//A root wraps around his mouth.//\n\n**Kenny:** Sh, sh, sh.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Hold on to your jorts; we're about to go on a ride!##\n\n**Martha:** We want to know about the packages you and your pals laid out for the park last night.\n\n**Sally:** And the ones you set up at the edge of town as well.\n\n**Kaiden:** I-\n\n//Martha sniffs the air.//\n\n**Martha:** He's nervous.\n\n**Sally:** I can see that he pissed himself, Mar, you don't need to announce it.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Rank. Wild. Asparagus?##\n\n**Kaiden:** What-what are you... this is insane. They're monsters!\n\n//He gestures to Kenny and Martha. Sally's eyes narrow.//\n\n**Kenny:** Rude.\n\n**Martha:** Very rude.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Extremely rude.##\n\n**Sally:** And a deflection. Start speaking true, bud, or we start playing a guessing game.\n\n**Kaiden:** G-guessing game?\n\n//She pumps her shotgun.//\n\n**Sally:** Yeah, which limb is going goodby will get you, to be honest.\n\n//She points it towards his left knee.//\n\n**Sally:** Three seconds.\n\n**Martha:** I love this side of you!\n\n**Kenny:** A little bit much, huns. Why don't we just keep them both here until the sun and lack of water get to them? Heat stroke tends to make things pliable.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Immediate gratifcation vs slow stewing. This is an allegory for the hunting styles of most predators. I think.##\n\n**Sally:** Two!\n\n**Kaiden:** Yes, yes, alright, we set up a bunch of fire starters last night! But it was his dad's idea!\n\n//He points at Dray, who stares at him wide-eyed.//\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|P-p-plot twist!##\n\n//Dray begins shouting, muffled by the root, and Kenny, after a moment, loosens his grip, allowing him to speak fully.//\n\n**Dray:** What the fuck is this, dude, is this a prank? What did you do?!\n\n**Kaiden:** What I had to! You don't pay me shit.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Corrupt Capitalism Combobreaker!##\n\n**Dray:** Are you kidding me?!\n\n**Kaiden:** No! You treat me like shit, and your dad offered me money if I worked with some of his people everywhere we went. Shot some footage, did-\n\n**Sally:** A bunch of terroristic shit.\n\n**Kaiden:** We didn't hurt anyone!\n\n//Sally, Dray, and Martha all look at Kenny.//\n\n**Kenny:** Rogue wildfires don't hurt anyone?\n\n**Kaiden:** I-\n\n**Dray:** The fire at the museum, that building collapsing.... You said those were all freak accidents!\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Sounds like some freaky deaky stuff to me. But how many times can bullshit bumble-fuckery happen in your wake before you see the pattern?##\n\n**Kaiden:** I didn't know what he was-\n\n**Dray:** But you still took his money!\n\n//Martha and Sally step closer to Kaiden, and he shuffles backward.//\n\n**Kaiden:** Stay back! Look, if you let him go, I'll get rid of them! Tell the others to stand down. But if you don't, there are people who know where we are!\n\n//Sally chuckles, shouldering her gun.//\n\n**Sally:** Bout that.\n\n//She reaches into her coat pocket and pulls out a small bundle. She tosses it to the ground, and it unfurls, revealing a collection of freshly severed fingers. Martha licks her lips.//\n\n**Martha:** Finger foods! You shouldn't have!\n\n**Sally:** Always thinking of you, honey bee.\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|See, I prefer ants on a log, but they do have the same kind of crunch and mush mouth feel.##\n\n//Kaiden vomits and glances at Dray for a moment before turning and running as fast as he can.//\n\n**Dray:** Don't leave me here, you bastard!\n\n//Sally unshoulders her gun and points it after him but seems to think better of it, looking back to the others.//\n\n**Sally:** So, what do we do with this one?\n\n//Kenny glances down at Dray's art supplies and points a root at the sketch.//\n\n**Kenny:** Can I see that, darling?\n\n//She nods, holding the image up to him. He squints tighter, and more roots emerge, picking up Dray's scattered art tools.//\n\n**Kenny:** Now, son, I'm willing to let you go, but you are going to need a reminder not to do this sort of thing again, right?\n\n//He holds the image down next to Dray's head and begins lowering the cutting implements towards his forehead.//\n\n**Kenny:** Next time, be neighborly and ask before you enter someone else's home! You never know who you might meet on the other side. Oh, and find some better friends. You're down a few.\n\n//He laughs and then grimaces apologetically.//\n\n**Kenny:** Sorry, that was a bit too dark. Now, hold still.\n\n//His eyes narrow in concentration. Dray stops screaming, his voice seeming to give out.//\n\n**Martha:** What about the other one, huns? He's getting away.\n\n**Sally:** Well, you always enjoyed a chase.\n\n**Kenny:** I've got a good hold on this one. Go get him.\n\n//The tree grins widely and winks at the creature.//\n\n**Martha:** Oh, you charmers, you.\n\n//She turns to run and takes in the SCP-6786-1.//\n\n**Martha:** Now, who are you?\n\n**SCP-6786-1:** ##D4A017|Just filming a nature documentary, Mam, not looking to interfere.
