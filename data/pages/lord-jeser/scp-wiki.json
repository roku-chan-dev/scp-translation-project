With deception he creates opportunities for the Scarlet Horde to continue their march across Creation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/1870s_vinegar_valentine_snake_proposal_declined.jpg]]\n\nA metaphorical depiction of Jeser accompanied by a rhyme. It refers to Jeser's attempts in the 19th century at acquiring a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-231 tribute] for the Scarlet King.\n\nFor readability the rhyme is transcribed below.\n\n> I'm not attracted by your glitter,\n> For well I know how very bitter\n> My life would be, if I should take,\n> You for my spouse, a rattlesnake,\n> Oh no, I'd not accept the ring.\n> Or evermore 'twould prove a sting.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Lord Jeser has no true form.[[footnote]] As far as we know. No reference to a true form has been found in any record. [[/footnote]] He typically adopts whatever appearance may influence those he encounter.[[footnote]] \"In my case, Jeser took the form of an angel based on my Christian beliefs. He tried to convince me he was a messenger of God.\" - W[[/footnote]] However, he has been known to regularly take the form of a handsome man in a suit with black hair that is always combed back.[[footnote]] \"From the drawings I have seen he kind of looks like Brad Pitt.\" - Kunj[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"No, he does not look like Brad Pitt, Kunj. He looks more like Bradley Cooper.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]] In the court of the Scarlet King, it is said that Jeser takes the form of a faceless creature wearing a royal garment. His skin appears scarred with the tendency to writhe around.\n\n**Nature:** Jeser is a manipulative liar with a tendency to speak in flowery language.[[footnote]] Jeser typically does this to cause confusion in certain individuals.[[/footnote]] He will flatter and make false promises to anyone he wishes to use as a pawn. Like most deceptive beings, Jeser is arrogant and prideful. Any show of humility is just an act to obtain the trust of others. When the time is right, he will betray those he had deceived.\n\nJeser relishes in the suffering caused by his actions. It amuses him when the lies he would spread ruins the close bonds of others, and produce conflicts. Torture is also a pastime of Jeser. He occasionally uses it to extract information when persuasion fails. Mortals are his preferred victims.[[footnote]] Mortal beings are less resistant to pain. [[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Long ago, Jeser ruled over 24 worlds he had obtained through treachery. He ruled with immense cruelty towards his subjects, and constantly sought after more power. One day the forces of the Scarlet King invaded his domain. Jeser saw no chance of victory as he watched some of his own warriors be slaughtered. The Prince of Many Faces quickly surrendered, offering himself to the Scarlet King. Soon he was part of the court as a lowly servant, but Jeser proved his worth through the display of his tactics. Eventually he received lordship, and command over the children of A'tellif.[[footnote]] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dust-and-blood A'tellif is the sixth bride of the Scarlet King.] [[/footnote]]\n\nJeser now leads many covert campaigns for the Scarlet King. His methods have weakened realms that would have been costly to conquer. Unexpectedly, this led the King to ordain Jeser as his successor in the unlikely event he perishes. This decision was not made out of respect for Jeser. Instead, it was based upon Jeser's cunningness and unending ambition for more power. If he were to acquire the throne, Jeser will inevitably challenge the Creator himself to rule all of Creation, which would be a favorable outcome for the Scarlet King.[[footnote]]\"So we have a mad king who wishes to bring oblivion upon all of Creation, but if he is gone we will be left with a despicable trickster who will try to rule for all eternity. I don't know which fate is worst.\" - Trünan[[/footnote]]\n\nHowever, despite his status, Jeser is loathed by many in the Scarlet King's court. The many warriors among them find Jeser's use of treachery to be cowardly and dishonorable. Meanwhile, the children of A'tivik[[footnote]] A'tivik is the first bride of the Scarlet King. [[/footnote]] envy the rewards he receives from the King.[[footnote]] \"Even though they were made wiser than their siblings they are still entitled brats.\" - Trünan [[/footnote]]\n\n**Approach:** Never trust Jeser. He will always have an ulterior motive. Furthermore, never have your back turned to him. Jeser will take it as an opportunity to slay you if you refuse to unwittingly follow his schemes.\n\nIf one is strong enough, striking down Jeser must be a priority. He will attempt to flee from danger, but his death will greatly hinder the Scarlet King. Compared to the other lords, Jeser is one of the weakest, but he is still a powerful foe. Do not underestimate him.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Observations & Stories**\n[[/=]]\n\n//\"Our cardinal choked on his own blood while Jeser laughed his way out of a window. [...] My elite men and I had travelled far from the holy city in pursuit of Jeser until we eventually caught up with him in the woods. He had a smile too big for the face he wore, and we then noticed the Faceless[[footnote]] An epithet for the children of A'tellif. [[/footnote]] emerging from the shadows. Jeser quickly changed himself into a dragon, and his trap was set in stone. I immediately took to fighting Jeser while the others defended. During our battle, some of the Faceless would transform into my comrades, and attempt to approach close enough to stab me. Meanwhile, I had to block constant streams of fire.//\n\n//\"Then we heard the trumpets. The sky became crimson, and instead we heard the beating of drums. The invasion had begun on our realm. We quickly realized that Jeser had lured us far from the holy city to weaken its defenses. He laughed before taking flight. The Faceless grew wings and followed their master. Our end was coming.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //Exodus of the Da'vo Christians//\n\n------\n\nAt the ancient city of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264 Alagadda], Jeser is rumored by many to be watching from the shadows. His form there is allegedly adorned in an extravagant black cloak while wearing a red mask; one that possesses a devious smile.\n\nIt is speculated that Jeser visits the city to monitor the royal court of Alagadda. The Ambassador of the Hanged King has been visiting the cursed city of Adytum, and conversing with an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2480 Archon of Yaldaboath who wears the name and skin of Grand Karcist Ion.][[footnote]] Consult librarians to access texts documenting the history of Grand Karcist Ion. [[/footnote]] [[footnote]]The nature of these conferences are unknown. It has been noted by the Wandsman of Kul-Manas that inhabitants of Alagadda have an unusual affinity towards creatures of Sarkicism / Nälkä.[[/footnote]] Alagadda becoming allied with the Archons would understandably raise concern from the Scarlet King.[[footnote]]The Scarlet King is currently locked in a cold war with the Archons of Yaldaboath. Both parties created the Treaty of Thorns and Flesh, but tensions have continued to linger due to occasional conflict of interest.[[/footnote]]\n\nFurthermore, it is rumored that Jeser may have played a part in the political struggle that caused the Black Lord, Wearer of the Anguished Mask, to be absent from Alagadda.[[footnote]] The Black Lord is one out of four lords that govern Alagadda. [[/footnote]] However, there is no evidence to prove this, and most agree Jeser is unlikely to tamper with the politics of the city.[[footnote]] \"Last time I spoke to the Wandsman of Kul-Manas, he also agreed that Jeser had no involvement in that affair. However, it is advisable to remember there is precedent of Jeser weakening leadership by causing internal conflicts. We could be wrong.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]]\n\n------\n\nAnother account of Jeser was that he was present at the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1936 Battle of Daleport].[[footnote]] The Battle of Daleport was a conflict between a variety of deities at Daleport, New England. It was orchestrated by \"The Victory Society\" whose members had contact with the Serpent's Hand. Consult the nearest librarian for access to all records of the event.[[/footnote]] This testimony is from Pangloss[[footnote]] Pangloss is a regular visitor of the Wanderer's Library, and an ally to the Serpent's Hand. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Cool dude. He gave me one of those [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1612 flaming soya bean plants].\" - Kunj [[/footnote]] who participated in the conflict to save as many lives as possible. Below is an excerpt from him regarding his experience at Daleport.[[footnote]] Request a librarian for access to a copy of Pangloss' full account of the Battle of Daleport.[[/footnote]]\n\n//\"While wandering through Daleport for survivors, I sensed the familiar aura of the Scarlet King and his servants, so I immediately went to investigate. Partially shrouded by smoke and the mist of Ssvlsrr[[footnote]] Also known as the Shivering Mist. Ssvlsrr prevented the battle at Daleport from spilling out of the town. [[/footnote]], I saw Jeser standing proudly in a desolate field covered with corpses.  Accompanying him were two children of A'zieb.[[footnote]]A'zieb is the fourth bride of the Scarlet King.[[/footnote]] They were gnawing on bones leftover from the resurrected skeletons. A dozen of A'tellif's children were also there, and they timidly stood beside each other. I could not help but pity them.//\n\n//\"Like a vulture, Jeser was consuming the essence of those who had fallen in battle. He was the first to notice me before the others. The children of A'zieb immediately prepared themselves to attack, but Jeser signaled them to stand their ground. He then looked at me and smiled before leading his entourage further into the mist. I did not follow him. There was more people to save, and he had no intention to fight. However, I fear he may have been spectating to see who would emerge victorious from the conflict, especially among the Great Victors. The Scarlet King is always searching for more beings to conscript into his army. Furthermore, Jeser has also gotten stronger from the essence he had consumed. This fact alone is great cause for concern.\"//\n\n------\n\nWhile many tales exist of Jeser's wickedness, the most infamous story shared by many is his betrayal of Sanna, the Mother of Those Beneath Us.[[footnote]] Sanna was a godddess from the Darkness Below. She was revered by many who dwelled there until she was subjugated by the Scarlet King. For further information consult the tomes documenting the history of Sanna and the Darkness Below.[[/footnote]] Long ago, she had planned to flee the clutches of the Scarlet King, but circumstances orchestrated by Jeser prevented her escape. During this time, Jeser was a mere servant, but he was seeking favor from the King. The following is how the story goes.\n\nJeser had befriended Sanna when she remained trapped in the court of the Scarlet King. He used their mutual hate for him to bond with her, and soon Sanna came to trust Jeser. However, little did she know, Jeser did not seek friendship. He sought to learn her value just like the King did, observing her elegance and power.\n\nOne day, Sanna confided in Jeser a plan to escape the Darkness Below. She made him promise not to speak of it, placing a seal to ensure he did not break even if he was tortured by the King. Jeser, without much choice, gave her his word, but he could not allow Sanna to escape.\n\nWhen war was officially declared on all of Creation, Jeser convinced the King to break Sanna, and conceive for himself a greater army than he already had sooner than later. Consequently, Sanna did not get her chance to escape, and she instead suffered seven days with the King until she perished. For consigning Sanna to this fate, Jeser is loathed by all who once dwelled in the Darkness Below.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\nLord Jeser is notorious for his lies, and how he spreads them to mislead enemies. It's possible that some information concerning him could've been fabricated by none other than himself. His ability to shapeshift allows him to easily infiltrate and implant falsehoods.[[footnote]]\"I heard Jeser once tricked a kingdom into believing that [[[Lord Goran]]] was the size of a house cat. They were very unprepared when they saw how big he actually was.\" - Kunj[[/footnote]][[footnote]]\"I've never heard of such a ridiculous feat. You made that up, Kunj.\" - Trünan[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Actually, Kunj didn't. It's mentioned in //Epic War Fails Vol. 4//. However, some entries have been proven to be false, and it's possible it is just a rumour, especially one started by Jeser. I have found nothing to corroborate the account so far.\" - M[[/footnote]]\n\nThe children of A'tellif could further contribute to the spread of misinformation regarding their lord. Fear and paranoia is something Jeser will take advantage of if it pertains to him. Furthermore, there have also been speculation that some of the actions of the children may have been misattributed to Jeser. Both are capable of shapeshifting, and those incapable of reading auras will not able to distinguish them. A matter of fact, this confusion caused the formation of the debunked conspiracy theory that Jeser does not exist.[[footnote]] \"For those unfamiliar with the details, the conspiracy theory claims Jeser is a fabrication from A'tellif's children. Their alleged goal was to cause paranoia in enemies of the Scarlet King over him having such a capable lord under his command. However, this theory is obviously a load of crap for those who know better.\" - H.J.[[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"I like conspiracy theories. Some are really funny.\" - Kunj. [[/footnote]]\n\nRegardless of what is the truth, Jeser is a dangerous being with horrific ambitions like the King he reluctantly serves. No good will come wherever he goes.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** 1870s vinegar valentine snake proposal declined.jpg\n> **Author:** Unknown author\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1870s_vinegar_valentine_snake_proposal_declined.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
