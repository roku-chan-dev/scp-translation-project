This is the guide for that.\n\nThe biggest issue with creating a guide for CSS is that I would not be the first person to do so. CSS is part of the trifecta of web design alongside HTML and JavaScript, and thus has a piece of the internet carved out solely to detail its uses; MDN web docs, CodePen, StackOverflow, among others. If you want a much more rigorous and comprehensive guide on CSS, there are a multitude of offsite resources available to you.\n\nHowever, I can tell you how to take advantage of CSS within the context of the SCP wiki.\n\n**Preface:** This guide is for //absolute beginners//. Anyone with even a passing knowledge of CSS can comfortably downvote this article. Additionally, this guide is dependent on the user having access to a computer; while this can be done on mobile, it is a pain in the ass.\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\nLet us begin with the humble blockquote.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSexy train is leaving the station.\n[[/div]]\n\nA solid div; it’s one of the first things you learn as a new SCP writer. It allows you to easily create test logs, interview transcripts, after action reports, etc. Classic.\n\nIf you don't know how to make a blockquote, this is what it looks like in plain text.\n\n[[div style=\"border:2px dashed grey; padding:0 1em;margin:auto;line-height:1.1;\"]]\n\n@@[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]@@\nSexy train is leaving the station.\n@@[[/div]]@@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** A div is short for division; essentially, it is a way to divide a webpage up into parts. There's more types, but for now, this is all you need to know.\n\nThat's interesting and all but… //how// does it work? What does it look like under the hood?

It will take time to learn the basic steps, and it will take more time to master it. I'm still not good at it.
