You might attribute this to environmental quirks, or dismiss it as  another abnormality among the many. But all I want is to share these experiences with you, as a small story of mundane love and unusual dreams. Thank you, strangers.\n\nIn my youth, we shared countless sweet moments. Every morning, my heart swelled with warmth and joy. As the sun dipped low, we'd walk hand in hand through the park, basking in the companionship and happiness of that moment. She was my strength in times of despair, a constant reminder that happiness was never far away.\n\nOn a starry night, we sat on a campus bench, quietly gazing into each other's eyes. Looking into her earnest gaze, I suddenly realized that she was the right person in my life. I took her hand gently and spoke from the bottom of my heart: \"No matter what lies ahead, I promise to stay by your side, forever.\" She looked at me, her eyes brimming with tears and gratitude: \"And I will always be with you, my love, forever.\" We embraced tightly, as if to freeze that moment eternally, leaving only our true love to endure.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##yellow|**qyke**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:03:33 #35864753\n------\n\n[# Get the latest clips first, two men passionately kissing, those who have seen it call it exhilarating 🔞🔞🔞]\n\n[# Awesome!

Her voice is like the wind of that world, caressing my soul, bringing with it the breath of life and the flutter of the unknown.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##yellow|**qyke**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:08:01 #35864753 #8digitnumber\n------\n\n[# When forbidden love blooms in the dark night, an unknown passion quietly unfolds.

Not only are you posting nsfw ads, but you're also making false claims!

She leaves me alone in the world of the living.\n\nAt that time... it was her and me.\n\nPerhaps I was just tired, to the point where I could no longer distinguish between dreams and reality. Are those fragments of dreams falling into reality, or reality piercing into dreams? I don’t know.\n\nThe only thing that comforts me is that every time I look at this mirror, it brings back those beautiful memories, and her... enchanting eyes.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**qyke**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:10:02 #35864753\n------\n\n[# 影片限时免费，快来看吧！]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##red|**(account deleted)**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:10:23 #12734582\n------\n\n？\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##purple|**Boip**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:03:32 #08075400\n------\n\n**@**🗿##green|**Blank_Spots**##\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n🗿##green|**Blank_Spots**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:03:32 #000000001\n------\n\n##red|**User qyke has been permanently banned for posting irrelevant content in multiple places according to the site rules.**##\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n🗿##green|**Blank_Spots**## 09/20/09 (Sun) 22:50:14 #000000001\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Email records**\n\n-----\n\n[Record begins]\n\n🗿##green|**Blank_Spots**##：I'm giving you a chance to make up for your mistake.
