That denotes SCP articles which were under 30 and tales which were under 20 when this edition of site news was posted. Give them a little love! Speaking from personal experience, the most frustrating thing that can happen to an article is not deletion, but stagnating below 20 without any comments. So try to read, vote, and comment on these articles! They're often hidden gems :)\n\n+++ Week of July 1st:\n\n\n++++ SCPs\n\n* 📈[[[scp-4197| SCP-4197]]] (\"Parafriends\") - Always keeping an eye out for you.
