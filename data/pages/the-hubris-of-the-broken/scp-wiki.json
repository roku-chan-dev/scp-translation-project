We thank you for your understanding.\n@@ @@\n|echoes=1230\n|hums=581\n|time-and-date=‎ \n]]\n\nIt is unknown at this time how many people have been moved to these \"specialized living spaces\", how many there are, and what the living conditions are like. \n\n[# Continue reading...]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"With a stroke of luck, someone manages to break through\" hide=\"Despite the risks, you know you have to get out of this city\"]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nYou've always considered yourself smarter than the other people you know. Maybe not academically smart, but you know how to get yourself out of a tough situation.\n\nYou put those skills to good use once the Hong Shing Police Department quarantines your group of infected people in Hong Shing's sewers. You understand why it has to be done, but you can't take it anymore. \n\nThere's barely enough food to go around, and it's obvious that the government's just waiting around for you all to die instead of trying to figure out how to cure the mess of illnesses massacring your immune system.\n\nOnce a week passes, you decide to enact your plan. Every night, from 2 AM to 2:05 AM nobody is watching the exit into the Flying Dragon district. Once you are sure the coast is clear, you pick the lock to the gate and run to the nearest alleyway.\n\nYou aren't from this area, so you don't know where exactly the nearest Way to Hong Kong is. Still, you vaguely remember reading a map, so you try to make your way to where you think the Way is.\n\nDashing through the alleyways, you know you must move as quickly as possible to avoid being seen, Yet, when you spot a dumpster, you stop in your tracks. You know that you don't have time, but you don't care. If there's any food in that dumpster, you need to eat it.\n\nYou manage to grab a half-eaten sandwich before someone spots you, causing you to jump out and run as fast as you can.\n\nWith the police on your tail, you spot the Way as well as the border checkpoint surrounding it. Propelling your arm forward, you expel several gears and bolts toward the guards. They raise their riot shields to protect themselves, and you take advantage of this to turn your hand into a hammer, slamming your hammer-fist into the shield.\n\nThe guard stumbles backward, and you squeeze past him and into the Way, ignoring the pleas of the people behind you.\n\nOnce you're through the Way, you plan on running off and hiding in a nearby forest. You know of a cabin in the woods that you would visit as a child. Your plan is cut short, however, when you look around at the city you emerged into, you start to slow down.\n\nEverything looks... different, somehow. Yet, everything looks like it should. Yet, it doesn't. You're very confused. \n\nYou stop for a moment to listen to the people around you speak. You were expecting to hear Cantonese, but instead, you hear Mandarin. Still, it's not the Mandarin you expect to hear.\n\nIt takes you a moment to recognize exactly what kind of Mandarin you hear, and when it clicks, you freeze in horror at what you've done.\n\nYou didn't go to Hong Kong. You went to Hong //Gong//.\n\nYou quickly turn around and attempt to find the Way back to Hong Shing, but before you can find it you hear a rough voice yelling at you. \n\n\"Halt! State your name and business!\" A [[[scp-cn-999|United State of A Mary King]]] officer yells at you. \n\nYou panic and thrust your arm at him, propelling a few gears at him. He widens his eyes in shock at your hubris before he furrows his brow.\n\n\"Under the Prevention of Magic Act, you are to stop and put your hands up!\" \n\n\"Please!\" you plead, hoping he'll symphasize. \"You can't come any closer! You don't understand\"\n\nThe man scoffs. \"I understand plenty.\" He walks over and grabs your hand. \"I understand that you're coming with m--\" \n\nHe stops talking and stares at his hand in abject horror as his hand turns into a black, shifting texture. As the virus spreads through his body, he falls to the floor, simultaneously losing and gaining the ability to process the divine energy in the air. Several other officers and civilians approach the man to try and help him, with about a quarter of them succumbing to the same fate.\n\nYou falter at this point while you back away, realizing that you overexerted yourself a few steps back in your plan.\n\nAs you collapse and the unholy combination of illnesses coursing through your body finally completes its siege of your immune system, you take solace in the fact that you won't have to live with the consequences of your actions.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/how-did-we-get-here | previous-title=How Did We Get Here?\n| next-url=/scp-7864 | next-title=VNP-7864\n| hub-url=/8000-dead-rats-hub | hub-title=8,000 Dead Rats\n]]\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** Chinese Medicine Hospital of Ningxiang 20220429.jpg\n> **Author:** Huangdan2060\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chinese_Medicine_Hospital_of_Ningxiang_20220429.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n\n> **Filename:** FIRE 01.JPG\n> **Author:** MarcusObal\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FIRE_01.JPG|Flickr]]]\n\n> **Filename:** ISS062-E-73959 - View of Earth.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ISS062-E-73959_-_View_of_Earth.jpg|Flickr]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Flag-Hong-Shing.svg\n> **Author:** Jerden\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Alocations-of-interest/Flag-Hong-Shing.svg|Locations of Interest Artwork]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Day021.png\n> **Author:** MasonFlores\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/flores-goitober-submissions-2023/Day021.png|Flores' GOITOBER Submissions 2023]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
