Potential memetic hazards redacted.| width=40]]\n\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7720 is to be contained in a standard non-humanoid confinement unit at Site-76, along with a standard Foundation computer terminal and a CO2 fire extinguisher. SCP-7720 is not to be approached or interacted with by any personnel skilled in programming, information technology, or computer engineering.\n\nOnce every 24 hours, two D-Class personnel displaying low familiarity with technology are to be dispatched to SCP-7720’s unit and instructed to use it to print several mundane documents. In order to prevent dangerous effects, SCP-7720 must be utilized to correctly print at least one document; specifically, the output document must be properly representative of the input sent to SCP-7720.\n\nFurther instructions will be given remotely (with an external operator reading from SCP-7720-1) in the likely case that repairs are required to be performed on SCP-7720. D-Class that begin to display any familiarity with SCP-7720’s workings should be immediately retired from using SCP-7720.\n\nTo prevent manifestation of SCP-7720-2, SCP-7720 must not be allowed to sustain any structural damage. Personnel exhibiting extreme anger or frustration in the vicinity of SCP-7720, or attempting to destroy it, should be immediately apprehended by Site-76 security and administered Class-A amnestics. \n\nAll output from SCP-7720 must be scanned for cognitohazards before being viewed. Following cognitohazard scan and verification, all output is to be immediately incinerated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7720 appears and functions as an ordinary office printer (similar in appearance to an Epson WF-7720). However, it displays an unusually high rate of serious malfunctions (one or more of which are encountered nearly every time SCP-7720 is utilized). These malfunctions are generally described by SCP-7720’s display. Descriptions of errors range from mundane (“PAPER JAM”, “OUT OF CYAN”), to bizarre (“PRINT MODE 571”, “BLD RITUAL REQD”, “REPLCE INTRDIM INK”, “PC LOAD LETTER”).\n\nSCP-7720 displays an additional cognitohazardous effect, which causes humans who interact with it for prolonged periods to develop an irrational and violent hatred of printers (including SCP-7720). If untreated, subjects affected by this cognitohazard develop a compulsion to violently dismantle all printers using any implement available, including bare hands. These effects are much more extreme, and manifest much more quickly, in subjects possessing skill or training in technological fields. Continual exposure to SCP-7720’s cognitohazardous effect will cause violent urges against all technology to manifest, eventually replacing most thought processes. Class-A amnestics are effective in treating early stages of these effects. However, if effects have progressed significantly, subjects redevelop a hatred of technology following amnestic treatment in 89% of cases.\n\nIf SCP-7720 is not used regularly to print documents, nearby electronic devices within an increasing radius will begin to display malfunctions of similar severity to those typically experienced by SCP-7720. These malfunctions have been shown to transmit SCP-7720’s cognitohazardous properties. No known mechanism, besides regular use of SCP-7720, has been proven effective at preventing this effect from manifesting. Successful use of SCP-7720 causes external malfunctions to cease; however, residual cognitohazardous effects are not reversed in victims. No upper limit has been measured to the radius of SCP-7720’s effects when it is not regularly used. Hence, it is suspected that if SCP-7720 were left unused for sufficient time, it could trigger an AK-class “Collective Madness” scenario.\n\n\nSCP-7720-1 is a large tome simply labeled “Printer Instruction Manual”, which was discovered alongside SCP-7720. This item contains descriptions of numerous error messages and malfunctions to which SCP-7720 is prone, along with instructions on how to resolve them. Some of these instructions are mundane, while others are believed to constitute anomalous rituals. The instructions displayed within, if executed properly, have invariably proven effective at resolving issues with SCP-7720.\n\nSCP-7720-2 is a group of two entities of vaguely humanoid appearance. It is not known whether SCP-7720-2 are sentient. These entities appear to manifest whenever SCP-7720 is inflicted with sufficient damage as to prevent repair. Subjects who view SCP-7720-2 report that SCP-7720-2 do not possess any identifiable facial features. Communication with SCP-7720-2 has proven ineffective, with SCP-7720-2 only communicating to identify themselves as the “IT Department”, requesting access to SCP-7720. Once SCP-7720-2 is given access to SCP-7720, SCP-7720-2 perform repairs by an unknown mechanism, then demanifest. Subsequently, SCP-7720 appears to return to its normal appearance and function.\n\n**Addendum 7720.1:** Discovery\n\nSCP-7720 was discovered on August 23, 2021 following a video circulating on the social network “TikTok”. This video depicted a large printer being thrown from the window of an office building, along with commentary from the individual who was recording.\n\nFoundation analysts quickly identified the building as an office in ███████████, ██, belonging to ████████ ████, a corporation specializing in software development. Operatives at Site-76 immediately suspected cognitohazards and dispatched MTF Eta-10 (\"See No Evil\") to investigate. A cover story was disseminated claiming that the event was staged by ████████ ████ as a publicity stunt.\n\nMTF agents apprehended 17 individuals at the site of the ████████ ████ office building and successfully transferred them to Site-76 for interviews conducted by Dr. James Silas. Following interviews, individuals were amnesticized and released; Dr. Silas was assigned to lead containment efforts for SCP-7720.\n\nA selection of interview results has been recorded below.\n\n> **Interviewed:** Adam Chen, programmer at ████████ ████\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. James Silas\n> \n> **Foreword:** Mr. Chen was interviewed under the pretense of psychological examination by a psychiatrist at a local mental hospital. Before being interviewed, he had sustained moderate injuries to his hands; these injuries were treated before questioning. Mr. Chen's identity was determined using his driving license, which was found in his pocket.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Good afternoon. I'm a psychiatrist with the ████████ Institution, and I've been assigned to monitor your mental health. Before we begin, could you please state your name for the record?\n> \n> **Mr. Chen:** Name..? I.. They told me.. the printer. The manual said.. sacrifice. How does blood..? It worked! How..?\n> \n> //[Mr. Chen appears distressed, frantically looking around the room.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Mr. Chen, please calm down; you are safe here. Could you please tell me what you're looking around for?\n> \n> **Chen:** They came once. Fixed it. Why? I sma- ... How..? It's in pieces. This time, they can't. I know they can't. They can't.\n> \n> //[Mr. Chen begins sobbing; there is a long pause.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Adam, you seem to have some pretty serious injuries on your hands. Do you want to tell me about how that happened?\n> \n> **Chen:** Hated that thing. Used a hammer. They... they said they're from IT. I'm- They're not! They just.. I had to [inaudible] it so they'd stop!\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** This printer you're referring to - is this the object in question?\n> \n> //[Dr. Silas shows Mr. Chen a printed picture of SCP-7720.]//\n> \n> //[Mr. Chen stands up and begins screaming incoherently. He is immediately restrained and sedated by Site-76 security.]//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Despite the fact that the interview was terminated early, Mr. Chen provided valuable information to the Foundation; namely, confirmation that anomalous behavior is centered on a printer, as well as a description of unknown entities repairing it. Mr. Chen's mental deterioration appeared to be reversed by application of Class C amnestics; following amnesticization, Mr. Chen was released.\n\n> **Interviewed:** Giovanni Ricci, janitor at ████████ ████\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. James Silas\n> \n> **Foreword:** Mr. Ricci was interviewed under the pretense of a routine witness interview by local police. He was informed that his participation in this interview would excuse him from a requirement to attend multiple court hearings as a witness.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Good afternoon. Could you state your name for the record, please?\n> \n> **Mr. Ricci:** Giovanni Ricci.\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Thank you. We would really appreciate your full cooperation here; if you can just answer all of our questions, you'll be free to go home and forget about all this.\n> \n> **Ricci:**  'n then I ain't gonna have to go to court, eh?\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** As long as you tell us everything you saw, no. What can you tell us about this morning?\n> \n> **Ricci:**  Just finished puttin' this glass out, right, some motherfucker threw the damn thing out the window - my window I clean everyday, spotless, smashed my fuckin’ window.\n> \n> //[Ricci appears to sigh while making a frustrated gesture.]//\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** You're saying something was thrown through the window - could you tell us more about this object?\n> \n> **Ricci:**  So I'm walkin' out the front door thinkin' to myself \"this printer is scattered in pieces, everywhere, my job to clean this shit up\", right? Step around this corner, what do I see? I see this printer, new as can be, like Sandra's greasy fingers never touched the thing. \n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Excuse me, did you say the printer appeared entirely undamaged?\n> \n> **Ricci:**  Listen. Glass everywhere down here, eh, printer brand new. Nearly took the thing home myself, yeah? Brought it back up, though, put the thing right back next to the microwave. Hope someone throws that thing out the window too, things comin' back new around here. Throw myself out that window maybe, get some new bones.\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** Thank you, Mr. Ricci. Your information will be of great use to our investigation. Considering your cooperation, we can assure you that you won't have to attend any court hearings as a witness.\n> \n> **Ricci:**  That simple, yeah? Seen too many ugly Judge mugs in my day, pal. Real kind of ya to get me outta the seat for this. \n> \n> //[Mr. Ricci pauses for a moment.]//\n> \n> **Ricci:**  Got a smoke?\n> \n> **Dr. Silas:** No.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** Mr. Ricci's description corroborates the Foundation's suspicions that anomalous activity is centered on an anomalous printer. Notably, Mr. Ricci appeared largely unaffected by any cognitohazards present. Mr. Ricci was amnesticized and released as per standard Foundation witness interview protocol.\n\n**Incident 7720.1:** On August 31, 2021, between 2:00 and 3:00 PM, 17 employees of Site-76 reported simultaneous malfunctions in numerous devices, including CCTV cameras, computer terminals, cell phones, and a calculator. Operatives traced the epicenter of the malfunctions to SCP-7720's containment cell.\n\nBased on multiple interviews with witnesses, it was hypothesized that use of SCP-7720 could temporarily neutralize its detrimental effects. Experimentation immediately began to test this hypothesis. D-1752 was selected for use due to low technical skill. Subject was dispatched to SCP-7720's containment cell, assisted remotely by Operator Andrew Coast. Operator made use of the \"instruction manual\" SCP-7720-1 for additional aid.\n\nIncident 7720.1 demonstrated that suppression of SCP-7720's external effects is possible.\n\nA transcript of this incident has been included below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG 7720.1A**\n----\n**DATE:** 2021/08/31\n\n**NOTE:** D-1752 is a male former line worker, age 55.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[D-1752 is escorted into SCP-7720's containment cell; the door is closed behind him.]//\n\n**Operator Andrew Coast:** Good afternoon, D-1752. Your job today is to print off the document I've sent to your computer terminal, which is the Wikipedia page for \"Sunbeam Consumer Products\". You need to print the entire page and make sure that it matches. I'm here to assist whenever you run into issues.\n\n**D-1752:** Jeez. A fuckin' printer, why me?

You need to look in the the output tray and see if you can unjam it.\n\n**D-1752:** What's an output tray?\n\n**Operator:** It's the big piece that's sticking out from the printer. You might see a piece of paper stuck there. Try to remove the jam, please.\n\n//[D-1752 is observed jamming the stuck paper further into the printer.]//\n\n**Operator:** Please-\n\n**D-1752:** Look, it's printing!\n\n//[SCP-7720 finishes printing document.]//\n\n**D-1752:** What?

These pages were immediately incinerated as required by SCP-571's Special Containment Procedures. Operator Andrew Coast was scanned for SCP-571's cognitohazardous effects and found to be uninfected.\n\nAn automated cognitohazard scanner was fitted onto SCP-7720 immediately following Incident 7720.1.\n\nSubsequent attempt at utilizing SCP-7720 resulted in no errors and was achieved without incident. After successful printing of the Wikipedia article for \"Sunbeam Consumer Products\", nearby electronic malfunctions were reported to cease. Regular use of SCP-7720 is now required.\n\n**Incident 7720.2:** On September 27, 2021, Dr. Silas submitted a request to the Artificial Intelligence Applications Division. This request called for the creation of an Artificially Intelligent Conscript to assist in utilizing and debugging SCP-7720. Dr. Silas' request reasoned that an AIC could potentially eliminate the requirement for human subjects, massively improving workplace safety in Site-76 and saving hundreds of personnel work hours.\n\nAIAD accepted Dr. Silas' request, with the condition that minimal personality drivers be implemented as a precautionary measure.  AIAD immediately began work on an AIC to assist in SCP-7720's containment. On October 18, 2021, Dr. Silas' team was presented with {{Gutenberg.aic}}. \n\n{{Gutenberg.aic}} is an Artificially Intelligent Conscript specially designed and trained for extreme printer maintenance. Its training data set included 582 software debugging tutorials and programs, 237 Foundation documents and lecture transcripts relating to handling of anomalous technology, and 1,085 separate printer instruction manuals, with a special focus on SCP-7720-1. {{Gutenberg.aic}} is equipped to handle a mechanical arm with high strength and dexterity, and is capable of understanding both verbal and text-based input. {{Gutenberg.aic}} will log all actions taken during its operation.\n\nAn interview with {{Gutenberg.aic}}, conducted by Researcher Felix Olafsson, is included below. This interview was intended to confirm {{Gutenberg.aic}}'s adherence to the Foundation's Standard Principles of Artificially Intelligent Conscripts. Following the interview, {{Gutenberg.aic}} was subjected to a test involving a standard Epson WF-7720 model printer with multiple malfunctions.\n\n> **Interviewed:** {{Gutenberg.aic}}\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Researcher Felix Olafsson\n> \n> **Foreword:** {{Gutenberg.aic}} is an AIC designed for printer maintenance.
