Similar inoculants are to be disseminated to all vital personnel prior to the first Friday after American Thanksgiving. Attempts are underway to suppress SCP-6211 in public media, but success in this endeavour is not expected due to its inexplicable popularity and the high profile of [/scp-2011-ex its creator].\n\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-6211 is a combination of tones and spoken words producing extreme agitation and distress in 96% of those exposed. Though there are no lasting effects, SCP-6211 is an extraordinarily potent and disruptive piece of memetic weaponry.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"jotting table5 tableb\"]]\n= [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ADDENDUM 6211-1:[[/span]] Discovery\n\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]OFFICER OF RECORD:[[/span]] Dr. L.

The two notes repeat, varying in pitch and stability seemingly at random. Technicians and researchers throughout the Section begin clutching their ears and expressing extreme distress.>//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Where is--\n\n//<A screeching tone underlays the two notes, which increase in tempo and tremolo. A dull percussive sound, as of bells through a low-fi filter, is added to the mix. One technician begins to sob. Several are becoming visibly angry.>//\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Whose--\n\n//<A processed male voice begins to recite a rambling ritualistic monologue.

Her colleagues are reacting with extreme frustration to the voice, loudly and sometimes violently refusing to accept its assertions.

Dr. Lillihammer discovers the source of the sound: Dr. W. Wettle is sitting alone in the Cognitohazard Exclusion Booth. A quick search of the control panel with her left hand (her right hand is clamped over her right ear, her left ear blocked by her left shoulder) confirms that the exclusion system has been inverted. Dr. Wettle appears to be confused; he is manipulating a portable music player, and frowning.>//\n\n**Voice:** ███ ████ ██ █████\n**Voice:** ███ ████████ ██\n**Voice:** █████ ████ ███████\n**Voice:** ███ ███ ██████ ██████\n**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████\n**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████\n**Voice:** ██████ ██████ █ █████████ █████████████\n\n//<A mocking choir sings \"Oh\" as the noise degenerates further.>//\n\n//<Dr. Lillihammer enters the Cognitohazard Exclusion Booth, picks up the music player, and assaults Dr. Wettle with it until the audio ceases.

Dr. Wettle explained that he had received the offending 'music' on compact disc, and had attempted to listen to it in the most private location he could find, but he had misunderstood the function of the CEB and accidentally broadcasted to the entire Section.
