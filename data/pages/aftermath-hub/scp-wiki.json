However, there are some rules of thumb to tale into account when attempting to write an Aftermath story:\n\n# Forgotten Appendices tales should work as an epilogue that only relies on the referenced SCP for context. Being heavily reliant on that article is fine, but it should require nothing else to work.\n# Forgotten Appendices tales should link to their reference SCP somewhere in the article.\n# Retirement Party tales should be about closing out the relationship the character has to the SCP Universe. It is supposed to operate as a bookend. \n\nIn addition to these, if you want to follow the general form and style of previous Aftermath stories, I recommend:\n\n* Keeping the story relatively character-focussed, even if its an SCP follow up.\n* Maintaining a more reflective or somber mood. That doesn't mean your story can't be happy, but very few of these are comedic or particularly action-packed.\n\nHappy writing!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Empty_book.jpg\n> **Name:** Empty_book.jpg\n> **Author:** Lionel Allorge\n> **License:** GNU Free Documentation License\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Empty_book.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
