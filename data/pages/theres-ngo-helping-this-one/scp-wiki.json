He grumbled and grabbed at his mustard-stained lab coat to clean the smudge, only for one of the lenses to pop out and hit the ground. Wettle sighed again, then bent over from the couch to pick it up. \n\n\"Were you going for a Rodney Dangerfield reference with that last bit there, Dr. Wettle?\" Ngo clasped her hands together and raised her leg up on the chair she sat on.\n\n\"Who?\"\n\n\"You know, the comedian with the wild eyes who pulls on his tie and says 'no respect' and things like that?\"\n\n\"I'm not much into comedians.\"\n\n\"In either case, maybe this is a problem with how you are perceiving yourself in comparison to your peers. Do you view yourself as worthy of respect?\" \n\nWettle futzed with his glasses and the missing lens, trying to re-insert it. He muttered a few curse words under his breath before answering with a drawn out \"Yes.\"\n\nNgo nodded. \"And why do you think people treat you different?\"\n\n\"I have no god damn idea, Dr. Ngo! It's like I'm a magnet for abuse. Like I'm a chew toy for the fucking universe.\"\n\n\"It is important to consider one's own actions and words when viewing how others inter--\"\n\n\"Dr. Ngo, no one calls me Dr. Wettle. It's 'Willie' at best or 'Fat Slob' at worst. I have a PhD, god damn it!\" He raised his hands in annoyance, swinging his glasses around as he did so. \n\n\"We all have PhDs here, Dr. Wettle. But I'll bite. Do you perhaps have any examples of your coworkers not treating you with due respect?\"\n\n\"Why, yes, yes I do. So Dr. Blank, right? You know him, right? Harry?\"\n\n\"I do.\"\n\n\"Right, yes. Anyway, there's a file about [[[scp-6263|an anomaly that affects people who make typos.]]] I leave a note saying that it's a stupid anomaly that probably just comes down to human error. I would know, I'm a replications expert. And then Harry, he just comes along and points out that I made a typo and makes fun of me for it. Spelled 'buffoon' with an 'a.' Next thing I know, the file is locked and I'm the laughingstock of the entire Site because of a simple spelling error.\"\n\n\"It's just a typo. I don't think you should let it get to you as much as you have. We all make mistakes.\"\n\n\"But clearly everyone else treats it like a big deal!\" Wettle again swung his glasses around; this time they flew out of his hand and impacted against the wall. \"Ugh. Great,\" he sighed, getting up to grab them. The lens that was still in place was now cracked. \n\n\"Hmm.\" Ngo's raised leg met the ground again as she pondered. \"Well, Dr. Wettle--\"\n\n\"Thank you for calling me Dr. Wettle, by the way. You're the only one who does.\"\n\n\"Of course. Now, as I was saying, I think your coworker's behavior may be a reflection of how you view yourself. Do you view yourself as someone worth respecting?\"\n\n\"No shit, I do,\" he said under his breath, taking a seat on the couch again while inspecting his broken glasses.\n\n\"I think you may have some confidence issues, Dr. Wettle.\"\n\n\"Why? I'm plenty confident.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you took a risk?\"\n\n\"I take a risk coming into work every day.\"\n\n\"That's not what I mean. I mean being open with your feelings. Telling your coworkers about how they are hurting you.\"\n\nFor the first time since entering her office, Wettle was silent. He stammered a few incomprehensible phrases before ultimately shutting up and looking down to the frame of his glasses in his hands. Ngo nodded knowingly.\n\n\"I see. Well, Dr. Wettle, I want you to try and be open with them next time you feel you are disrespected. That will be your homework for next session. Sound good?\"\n\n\"I... I suppose so.\"\n\n\"Good. And get yourself new glasses while you're at it. I'd hate for you to have an accident because you couldn't see.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Ablankstyle/43Head.png) top right no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[size 75%]]\n**From:** William Wettle\n**To:** Nhung Ngo\n**Subject:** Emergency visit\n**Date:** 07/07/2022\n[[/size]]\n@@ @@\nDr. Ngo,\n\nI realize that you may be busy with other patients but I had a really bad day today.

I was going to the Site cafeteria and Dr. Blank was in front of me. I... I fell. And I reached forward trying to not fall and I guess I flailed and hit Harry in the face by accident.\"\n\n\"...

It's an ETTRA all-hands-on-deck crisis.\"\n\n\"What?\" Dr. Wettle reached into his lab coat pocket to pull out his phone, only for it to fall. He bent over to pick it up and farted. \"Oops. Excuse me.\" \n\nNgo sighed. She watched as Wettle unlocked his device and scrolled to his emails.\n\n\"The one from Sokolsky?\" Wettle looked up at her.\n\n\"Who else would it be from?\" \n\nThe two were silent for a moment as he read the message through his cracked screen. Suddenly, his eyes widened and he turned around.\n\n\"I need to go.\" Wettle ran out of Ngo's office, leaving the door wide open. She heard him trip over himself further down the hallway as she stood to shut the door.\n\n\"What a [[[scp-7000|loser.]]]\"\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
