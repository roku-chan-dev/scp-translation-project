  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nHi, I'm LizardWizard. I wanted to have an author page but I didn't actually want to put any effort into it. This is already a year late. I wrote this in a fairly depressive state, and really don't want to have to put more thought in it than I had to. I'll probably update it one day to be more... good.\n\nI don't know how to do listpages, sorry. Anyways, here's my stuff:\n\n\nSCPs:\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6446 SCP-6446: Into the Looking Glass]\nMy first page on the wiki. I was proud of this at the time, and still am to an extent.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6902 SCP-6902: Lost Luggage]\nMy highest rated solo article. It is also my shortest, and the one I spent by far the least time on. \n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-900 SCP-900: City of the Sun]\nI got to rewrite a series 1 SCP, alongside the wonderful [[*user DrGooday]]! That was neat, and good fun. \n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7006 SCP-7006: Initiative]\nMy most successful project, and also the one that burnt me out on the wiki for months. This was an absolute nightmare to create. Many thanks to my team [[*user Liryn]], [[*user Darkstuff]], [[*user Ihp]], [[*user Djoric]], as well as the [https://instagram.com/graceunderpressure fantastic] [https://twitter.com/just_randie team] [https://instagram.com/wafflehousefan53 of] [https://twitter.com/fisheverlasting artists] that provided an invaluable visual component to the work.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1984-j SCP-1984-J: Literally 1984]\nMy first (and likely only) J. Made only because I realized the number was open.\n\nTales:\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-trip-down-memory-lane A Trip Down Memory Lane]\nThis was a fun one. Based on a conversation [[*user HarryBlank]] and I had in discord, discussing how absurd an offhand remark in [[[SCP-6500]]] is.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/with-many-choices With Many Choices]\nProbably my favorite thing I've written so far. Written over the course of five months. I got stuck at one point, but [[*user Grigori Karpin]] swooped in at the end and saved it.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/crash-and-burn Crash and Burn]\nA tale I wrote for Deptcon. I was fairly proud of it, but looking back I really need to work on my dialogue.\n\nOther:\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lizardwizard-author-page My Author Page]\nThis is an embarrassment and I just want to be done.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
