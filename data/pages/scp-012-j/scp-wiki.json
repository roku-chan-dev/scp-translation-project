Until it is located, all Foundation staff are advised to be wary of exaggerated speech and body language, and implausible social faux pas. If an instance of SCP-012-J is suspected, staff are to refrain from vocalising any classified information.\n\n**Description:** SCP-012-J is a phenomenon which infrequently affects the behaviour of Foundation sites' occupants, and how they are perceived by surveillance equipment. Footage of each instance of SCP-012-J is preceded by a short musical number, followed by the phrase “This episode of Special Comedy Procedures was filmed in front of a live studio audience”. While SCP-012-J is in effect, affected personnel will begin to speak more clearly, and periodically emphasise the end of sentences, after which, all subjects will remain silent for several seconds, while a soundtrack of multiple people laughing can be heard on the surveillance feed. In addition, surveillance equipment will periodically deactivate, commonly after a subject makes a confident claim regarding future events, surveillance will then resume when the claim is disproven, at which point the original speaker will resignedly comment thusly.\n\nBelow are the transcripts of each instance of SCP-012-J to date.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Incident 012/1\" hide=\"Incident 012/1\"]]\n> **Incident:** 012/1\n> \n> **Date:** ██/██/████\n> \n> **Transcript:**\n> \n> (Officer Daniels enters the break room with a flamboyant arm gesture)\n> \n> **Officer Daniels:** Hey everybody!

Steel cell, pressure plates and laser sensors to make sure it’s in there, and blast shields like you wouldn’t believe!\n> \n> **Agent Steele:** Dude, that’s not SCP-999’s containment pen.\n> \n> **Agent Bridger:** Yeah man, that sounds more like [[[ SCP-096 ]]]’s containment!\n> \n> **Officer Daniels:** But if I just put SCP-999 in SCP-096’s containment cell, then that means… UH OH!\n> \n> (A sad, trombone sound effect plays, followed by cheering and laughter)\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Incident 012/2\" hide=\"Incident 012/2\"]]\n> **Incident:** 012/2\n> \n> **Date:** ██/██/████\n> \n> **Transcript:**\n> \n> (Agent Myre enters the cafeteria and joins her co-workers at a table)\n> \n> **Agent Myre:** Someone ask me how my day is going!\n> \n> **Agent Cliff:** How’s your…\n> \n> **Agent Myre:** Terrible!\n> \n> (Laughter)\n> \n> **Agent Myre:** I showed up late, spilled my coffee on my computer, and just now, I let SCP-████ out of containment!\n> \n> **Agent Danvers:** Well shouldn’t you go catch it?\n> \n> **Agent Myre:** Relax!
