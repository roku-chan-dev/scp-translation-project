I first found this site maybe 5-6 years ago? And made a yearly or so pilgrimage to binge articles for a couple days straight. Eventually, I decided to get a little more involved back in mid-2019, writing my first successful article (lahmi-gath) by the end of the year. Since then I've been loitering around #thecritters because crit staff haven't managed to get rid of me yet, occasionally subjecting the innocent readers of this site to my writing.\n\nOutside the wiki, I'm a Chemical and Environmental Engineering student from England. I've also got a big love for history, especially Latin American (never take me up on an opportunity to talk about it), do a fair bit of baking and an awful lot of sleeping.\n\nOh yeah I'm captain of site crit, vc of rewrite and on MAST and CO now. Feel free to bug me about any of those.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab SCPs I've written]]\n\n* [[[SCP-5340 | SCP-5340 - The Backyard Memeticist]]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-5340\" category=\"*\" order=\"created_at desc\" limit=\"1\" separate=\"no\"]]\n(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%), Last comment by %%commented_by%%, %%commented_at%%\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Mr Flagg's Wild Ride (Commentary)\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\nMy first SCP! This was born from a love of the edutainment youtube genre, with special thanks to the channel 'Explosions + Fire', and qntm's antimemetics. Like a reoccurring theme I've found writing these commentaries, I'm not really satisfied with the ending, but this was a blast to write and explore.\n\nThe idea in this one was to try and represent burnout. Flagg's breakdown isn't supposed to be because of anything memetic, it's just the natural progression when you're working with objects you forget for long, long shifts. Idk how well that came through, but people seemed to enjoy it regardless, as it's currently my most successful thing.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Technically my 7 word entry to 'I, hub' puts that above this. I've decided not to put that on my author page for some reason.[[/span]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------------\n* [[[SCP-4536 | SCP-4536 - The Great American Pyramid]]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-4536\" category=\"*\" order=\"created_at desc\" limit=\"1\" separate=\"no\"]]\n(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%), Last comment by %%commented_by%%, %%commented_at%%\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"The world's largest Bass Pro Shop (Commentary)\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\nCome on and slam! This was day 1 of 2021 Jamcon, and was banged out in maybe 5 hours (one of which was spent trying to find a cc-compliant version of the 'women want me, fish fear me' hat unsuccessfully). This came after a month long motivation drought, and I'm pretty happy with it. It's certainly not perfect, but it's a funny premise, a topic I'm passionate about and I enjoyed writing it thoroughly.\n\nI've been told that this is a critique of Middle-Class America and consumerism literally becoming centuries old faith and rituals. I wish I was smart enough to put that in.\n[[/collapsible]]\n---------------\n* [[[SCP-5894 | SCP-5894 - La Luz de Yara]]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-5894\" category=\"*\" order=\"created_at desc\" limit=\"1\" separate=\"no\"]]\n(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%), Last comment by %%commented_by%%, %%commented_at%%\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"This commentary gets serious btw. (Commentary)\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\nThis is an article about Hatuey. Hatuey was a Cacique in Hayti who witnessed the brutality of early Spanish colonialism and fled his home to Cuba, in an attempt to save his own life and rally support to oust the Spanish of Cuba's shores when they arrived. The Taíno of Cuba did not believe that people could act with the barbarity that the Spanish did, and as such did not heed his call by large and were unprepared when the Spanish arrived. Hatuey's resistance failed, and the resulting Spanish atrocities in Cuba I will not mention here. \n\nThis is an article paying respect to the first hero of 300 years of Cuban resistance. A man who laid down his life to defend a home that wasn't even his, without whom the Taíno culture would have been destroyed entirely.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Despite 500 years of repression (that has only very recently slowed own), small Taíno communities survived in the disconnected mountains, often only even getting road connections in the 1960s-70s.[[/span]] I don't believe I've done this concept or figure justice, but I hope you enjoy regardless.\n[[/collapsible]]\n------------\n* [[[scp-6600 | SCP-6600 - Spidercon (With CelesteKara, chiifu, margssentif and Quadraginta)]]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-6600\" category=\"*\" order=\"created_at desc\" limit=\"1\" separate=\"no\"]]\n(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%), Last comment by %%commented_by%%, %%commented_at%%\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Spiders are very cool\" hide=\"-Close\"]]\nRemember to write something here\n[[/collapsible]]\n---------------\n* [[[scp-6000-J | SCP-6000-Jay - The Great Gatsby by F.

I've always been mildly irritated by how America-centric the Foundation is, and this is my thesis on why that's a bad idea. It was one hell of a difficult thing to balance non-partisanship, intrigue, detail and keep it Foundation focused, but I think it came out pretty good. I'm not that happy with the ending and would probably do it differently with hindsight, but it was a fun first foray onto the site :)\n\nI'd really like to write more about the Foundation in this world.
