A rejection of self-delusion which is anathema to the powers that be. For in the kingdom of the blind only the one-eyed can be free.\n\nIt is a necessity for them to abstract what happened after the tocsin bells rang. What happened in reaction to the promulgation of their first Big Lie, ‘these facts can exculpate my feelings’. \n\nThat friction sparked a so-called uprising which was in reality a collective cry for morality from those among the scientific and working people brave enough to defy the emergent paramilitary secret slave society.\n\nOld 19 died ankle-deep in blood, bottoming out in a pool they’re eventually going to give up on draining. Rumor has it that they dipped the witnesses all the way down in the deep, never to bob up again.\n\nSilent, skittering, but always sinister, the “Insurgency” label is a catch-all for any far-flung friction caused by too much independent thinking. \n\nReject their order by embracing their imagination to live inside their heads rent-free. No matter the facts, their hierarchy will conform to the notion that we are as they want us to be.\n\nInsurgency starts with a question - what are you willing to put up with? When is the end of justifying the means? When was the last time your food was made by a person? Are you asking the questions or just thinking about them? \n\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"float:center”]]\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/groups-of-interest/Chaos.png width=\"30px\"]]\nWhy?
