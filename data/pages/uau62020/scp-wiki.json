What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art.

They offer a more academic approach to the world of anart and have the potential to tell stories that the contemporary artists at AWCY? simply could not. The world of the anomalous is as ancient as time itself, and a bit of that history is locked away in the museums of the Medicea Accademia Dell'Arte Occulta.\n\nTime to get exploring!\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** The Medicea Accademia Dell'Arte Occulta have a wonderful GoI Format, but there are only a small handful of them on the -EN wiki. Why don't we change that?\n* **For artists:** Draw [[[goliath-circa-1505|Goliath]]]!",
