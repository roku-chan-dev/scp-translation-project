Please do not pester authors for 'using them wrong' or anything of the sort.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n\nThe Foundation has worn several disguises in order to protect itself from the public eye. From construction firms to pharmaceutical companies to universities, there is no front organization too big or too small for the Foundation to conceal itself behind in the name of its mission of containment. Some are used once and then disposed of, some have multiple use cases and are resurrected as needed, and others have been in continuous use for over a century.\n\nSeveral of these fronts have a further layer of protection in the form of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pickman-blank-proposal The Frontispiece], a memetic aegis which prevents most people from linking the SCP Acronym back to the Foundation, but this isn't always the case.\n\nIn general, Fronts fall into a few different categories:\n* **Academic/Educational:** Think-tanks, schools, universities, or collections of academics.\n* **Agricultural:** Front organization operates as a farm or food manufacturer.\n* **Commercial:** Businesses that do not involve manufacturing materials.\n* **Custodial:** Cleaning services, both euphemistically and otherwise.\n* **Entertainment:** Film studios, website curation, content creation.\n* **Food Service:** The front also serves as a restaurant.\n* **Industrial:** The front is a manufacturing, construction, or utility company.\n* **Medical/Pharmaceutical:** The front is a medical facility such as a hospital, or a pharma research company.\n* **Military/Security:** The front is a security force or military contractor. This includes aviation and space contractors.\n* **Philanthropic:** The front is concealed behind an organization such as a charity or relief organization.\n* **Real Estate:** The front is a real estate company, or owns several pieces of it.\n* **Retail:** Front is a retail store.\n* **Settlement:** The front takes the form of an entire human settlement, such as a village.\n* **Unclear:** The nature of the front isn't 100% obvious in the documentation.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n++ How to contribute\n-----\nConsider which of the categories the front you wish to add to this list belongs to. \n\nDoes it use the initials S.C.P. anywhere in its name? Then it goes in the __**Frontispiece**__ section. If not, __**Non-Frontispiece**__ is where it goes.\n\nIs it an Academic front, a Military/Security front, etc.? Please put it in the appropriate sub-category, or in the \"Unclear\" section if you're not sure how to categorize it.\n\nThese lists operate in alphabetical order. Please make sure to put the front you found in the correct position on the list.\n\nPlease add entries using this template:\n\n[[code]]\n|| {{FRONT NAME}} || {{FRONT DESCRIPTION}} || {{FRONT CATEGORY}} || {{ARTICLES FRONT APPEARED IN}} ||\n[[/code]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n__**Frontispiece:**__\n[[/=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show\" hide =\"Hide\"]]\n||~ Front ||~ Description ||~ Category ||~ Appearance(s) ||\n|| AquaS Conservancy for Penguins || Front group for the containment of anomalies of the //Spheniscidae// family of birds (commonly known as penguins). || Philanthropic ||[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2720 SCP-2720] [[[SCP-6458]]] ||\n|| Lake Huron Supply, Control & Purification|| A water distillation and purification company.
