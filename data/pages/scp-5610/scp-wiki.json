All historical documents related to felines are to be also investigated.\n\n**Description:**  SCP-5610 is an anomalous entity that is only observable by individuals with a cognitive resistance value of 5.6 and above. Approximately 56 percent of Japan's population has been found to have an instance of SCP-5610 resting atop of their head. However, no discomfort is felt by the subject these instances are resting on.\n\nAs a subject's behavior in public becomes more congruent to their behavior in private, the instance of SCP-5610 becomes increasingly detailed. This continues until it produces one of two results: either the instance would vanish, or in approximately six percent of all cases, it transforms into a non-anomalous cat(//Felis catus//) and jumps off the subject's head.\n\nSCP-5610 is prominently featured in haikus; living authors, when questioned, remember it. Notable ones are translated below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt is humankind\nTo put a cat on the head[[footnote]]猫をかぶる. A popular Japanese idiom.
