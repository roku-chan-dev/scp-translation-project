He proceeded to swat me multiple times and order roughly two-hundred pizzas to my house. Who the fuck does that over online drama? Get a grip, man.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE TWELFTH ORACLE**## - //I ordered some drugs from this guy to get high, but I made a typo while asking him and he sent me this shit that literally caused my room to spin. I had to spend thousands to get my house repaired. Not cool.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE ELEVENTH ORACLE**## - //She stabbed me after we met up on a blind date. Sadly, to say, it was probably only the fifth worst blind date I’ve ever been on.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE TENTH ORACLE**## - //Tax fraud.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE NINTH ORACLE**## - //This motherfucker did me dirty in a game of Blackjack back in the day. I know it was five years ago, but I know he looked at my god damn cards. He can lie all he wants, but I know the truth.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE EIGHTH ORACLE**## - //She didn’t really do anything to me, but when I went to her place with some buds for coffee once, her dog bit my leg so hard that I had to get stitches. I still get kinda spooked when I hear a dog bark.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE SEVENTH ORACLE**## - //Held a gun to my head and forced me to plead for my life after I said that I didn’t think her chocolate chip cookies were that good.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE SIXTH ORACLE**## - //I received a call once stating that he was caught raiding the private Compound-01 fridge at 3AM and stealing an entire cheesecake that was set aside for a celebration the next day.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE FIFTH ORACLE**## - //Was charged for creating at least seventeen cryptocurrency-related scams in the span of a single month.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE FOURTH ORACLE**## - //He cursed me in at least seventeen deviant languages on an online voice call after I destroyed him in several video games.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE THIRD ORACLE**## - //This bitch has invaded all of our privacies for a long ass time. I caught one of her security cameras looking at me while I was using the bathroom. Who does that, man? The bathroom is supposed to be a private place.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE SECOND ORACLE**## - //Holy fuck, where do I even start with this one? This bitch has practically done every evil thing you could imagine. I don’t think we even have enough room on this document for all of the shit she’s pulled over the years. I’m not kidding. It’s like the Geneva Convention was literally her checklist. She even made an entire Marine Fighting Team literally just so they could have a red cross symbol in their logo as one final middle finger. Yes, believe it or not, that is a real war crime. Don’t ask me why. I don’t think the MFT were even deployed afterwards. Regardless, she’s pure, god damn evil.//\n\n* ##blue|**THE FIRST ORACLE**## - //He’s established this entire group just so he can maintain power over the deviant stuff at his disposal. Fuck him.//\n\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n\nAlthough there were attempts made at diplomacy, none of them stuck. We tried to negotiate, but they refused to listen.\n\nThere is something powerful imbedded into the heart of Oracle.\n\nDue to the previously-mentioned grievances, it is the unanimous decision of the Phi Command that ##blue|Oracle must be contained.##\n\n----\n\nThe following are the steps taken by an Initiative agent who successfully followed through with the //Humilis Modus Operandi//.\n\n**1.

Sat upon each of the remaining seven chairs are a member of the Initiative’s leadership council, the Phi Command.//\n\n**Phi-01:** Good morning, Hobbes. Glad you could join us.\n\n//Hobbes maintains a confused expression as he looks around the table, finding all members of Phi Command to be wearing excited smiles.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Why did you call me here? Did I do something wrong?\n\n**Phi-01:** Oh, on the contrary! You’re here because we need you.\n\n**Hobbes:** You need me?\n\n**Phi-01:** Two, care to explain?\n\n**Phi-02:** Certainly. Mr. Watterson, you’ve been one of our most skilled agents within the Initiative. I think we probably could have an entire facility filled with things you’ve contained for us over the years! Regardless, we have recently had a very valuable opportunity thrown our way and we intend to take it. However, like all good opportunities, it needs to be taken by someone with the skill to do so.\n\n//Hobbes mulls the words over for a moment before Phi-02 continues.//\n\n**Phi-02:** Put simply, we have been contacted by the Overseer Composite of the Metacentre and they have offered to lend us assistance in our ultimate goal of containing the Shark Punching Centre.\n\n**Hobbes:** The who?\n\n**Phi-02:** Ah, I forgot this info is usually classified. Essentially, have you ever heard of the [[[scp-7243|Metafoundation]]] and their Oracle Collective?\n\n**Hobbes:** Oh, yeah. That multiversal authority of… SCP Foundations. They’re the ones who enlightened us about containment!\n\n**Phi-02:** Yes, them. Well, many Centres across the multiverse wanted to be part of it, but they were all denied entry. After a while of collective pouting, the denied Centres all eventually decided to make their own alliance—\n\n**Hobbes:** With blackjack and hookers?\n\n**Phi-02:** Yes, yes, with both of those.\n\n**Phi-04:** Pardon my interruption, but why don’t we have either of those?\n\n**Phi-07:** You think we could afford them?\n\n**Phi-04:** We can’t afford a deck of playing cards?\n\n**Phi-07:** Do you think paper grows on trees or something?\n\n//Phi Command then erupts into arguments concerning inflation, the global economy, and the price of paper before Phi-02 loudly bangs on the table, drawing all attention in the room back on him.//\n\n**Phi-02:** As I was saying… They called this group, uncreatively, the Metacentre and united under the authority of the “Overseer Composite”. Still with me?\n\n**Hobbes:** I guess so, but why would the leadership of a collection of multiversal Centres contact us of all people? They don’t understand the true meaning of life is containment!\n\n**Phi-02:** I understand your confusion. Believe me when I say we were surprised as well.\n\n**Phi-05:** Fuckers didn’t make themselves very obvious. I thought my phone was being blown up by telemarketers or my cousin asking for some drug money and then I learn the Overseer-Prime has left me thirty-seven voicemails.\n\n**Phi-02:** Yes, but besides the issues with how they contacted us, all that matters is that they did. Essentially, to make a long story short, they told us that because of the Centre committing horrific crimes against the nature of reality, such as endangering both the entire ecosystem and our eyes with a horrid dress code, they were soon investigated by the Overseer Composite. While their multiversal crimes didn’t amount to much, they did discover that these crimes were likely related to something called the “Borealis Constant”. No clue what that is, but the Overseer-Prime seemed pretty cheesed off about it. However, he was mostly angry about the Centre refusing to pay their membership taxes.\n\n**Hobbes:** So, how does this concern us?\n\n**Phi-02:** Well, they decided that the best solution to this issue with that Borealis Constant and the taxes was to have us either contain or execute the Oracle Council of the Centre.\n\n**Hobbes:** Hold on, are you asking me what I think you’re asking?\n\n**Phi-02:** Mr. Watterson, would you be willing to carry out the Humilis Modus Operandi of the Containment Initiative and eliminate our oppressors, freeing us to contain all that needs to be contained throughout this world?\n\n**Phi-04:** The Humilis Modus… what? What the hell is that?\n\n**Phi-06:** I think it’s a brand of socks?\n\n**Phi-02:** No, it’s the founding document of our organization. Do none of you seriously remember it?\n\n//All of Phi Command remains silent.//\n\n**Phi-02:** For fuck’s sake, alright, fine. The Humilis Modus Operandi was put into place by the Driver himself—\n\n**Phi-01:** The Driver? Why would we care about what that traitorous bastard has to say?\n\n**Hobbes:** Traitorous?\n\n**Phi-01:** Yeah, you know the mighty Driver who chose to forsake the… “pugilism” within the Centre who split off to form us at the behest of the neighboring universe’s SCP Foundation because he was enlightened by the ideals of containment? Fucker went back to the Centre decades ago. He’s still there, the rat bastard. Heard he’s O-13 now, actually.\n\n**Phi-02:** With… that aside. Yes, while the Driver may be gone, we are still here to carry on the mission of containment he originally helped enlighten us to, and the Humilis Modus Operandi was designed as the driving thought behind the Containment Initiative. Its directive is simple: eliminate the Shark Punching Centre’s Oracle Council, the deaths of whom would cripple the remainder of the Centre into nonexistence.\n\n**Hobbes:** Well, eliminating them is still far from easy, dude. Do we even know where half of them are?\n\n**Phi-02:** Normally we would not, but the Overseer Composite did not just give us a directive, my friend. No, they gave us something far more valuable.\n\n//Phi-02 slides over a packet of papers towards Hobbes.//\n\n**Hobbes:** What the hell is this?\n\n**Phi-02:** That is a collection of information related to each member of Oracle compiled by the Composite so we can eliminate them.\n\n**Hobbes:** If they have all this info, why don’t they just do it?\n\n**Phi-02:** What?\n\n**Hobbes:** If they have the resources to just casually fucking hand out the locations of all thirteen members of Oracle they clearly should be able to kill them, shouldn’t they?\n\n**Phi-02:** Meh, I’m not one to look a gift horse in the mouth.\n\n**Hobbes:** Still, something about this seems a little fishy.\n\n**Phi-02:** I can’t deny your suspicion has merit, but we would be stupid not to take this chance to contain Oracle. Think about how much better our world could be. One day, we could wake up in a world with the deviant all locked away in iron cages like they should be. It would be a world with… normalcy.\n\n**Hobbes:** I would love to see such a world.\n\n**Phi-02:** As do I. Hell, as do all of us! However, such a world cannot be achieved without effort, without purpose. That’s where you come in. Hobbes, we want you to fulfill the Humilis Modus Operandi and contain the thirteen members of Oracle.\n\n//Hobbes sits still for a moment and pauses in contemplation. His expression appears uneasy, but eventually hardens.//\n\n**Hobbes:** I’ll do it.\n\n//A small smile forms on Phi-02's face. The other members of Phi Command all smile and look at each other with regained excitement.//\n\n**Phi-02:** Alright, let's get you prepared.\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[size 150%]]**NOW**[[/size]]\n\n= -- - --\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n//Hobbes drives down the road from the steel factory in a dilapidated, red car.

His eyes fall to one member in particular, O-1.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Shit, why is he here?\n\n//Panicking, he rummages through his items more, eventually stumbling upon a remote with nothing but a large button with an antenna at the end.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Maybe this does something?\n\n//He points the remote at O-1, who continues examining the gas station’s cookie selection, before pressing the button.//\n\n//Suddenly, a large, steel cage falls through the ceiling and crashes into the floor, crushing O-1 to death.//\n\n**Clerk:** WHAT THE FUCK!?\n\n**Hobbes:** …oops.\n\n//Hobbes exits the store, offering a friendly wave to the mortified store clerk.//\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**2.

Eventually, he sighs and shoves the papers back in his pocket.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Shit security, then.\n\n//Hobbes opens one of the doors, stumbling slightly due to their confusingly light weight.//\n\n//After he enters, he finds that the doors led to an exquisitely furnished lobby. He marvels at the scenery, such as the large fishtanks filled with exotic specimens or culturally significant works of art.//\n\n//At the other end of the room sits a man standing stalwart in medieval knight armor, albeit without a visor covering his face. He holds an iron sword with both of his arms, facing the floor. Hobbes notices visible scratches on the tiles below it, indicating clumsiness. He sits in front of a large door, surrounded by fantastical wood carvings in its frame.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Who the hell are you?\n\n**Wrath:** I am Wrath, the last of the Law’s Left Hand.\n\n**Hobbes:** The who?\n\n**Wrath:** We’re an elite squad dedicated to protecting Oracle.\n\n//Hobbes stares at the man silently for a moment.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Well, uh, not to insult you or anything, but you guys have kind of been doing a shit job.\n\n**Wrath:** I’m literally the only one left, I just said that. Do you expect me to be in thirteen places at once?\n\n**Hobbes:** Well, no, I—\n\n**Wrath:** Yeah, exactly. Think before you speak next time.\n\n//Hobbes visibly senses something off about this man, as if he’d seen him somewhere before. He takes out the pile of papers from the Overseer Composite and consults one of the items: a photograph of the thirteen members of Oracle and the Centre’s High Pugilord. His eyes widen slightly. That was the answer.//\n\n//The High Pugilord.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Are you the High Pugilord?\n\n//The man tenses slightly.//\n\n**Wrath:** I have not been called that in a… very long time. I was him, at one point.\n\n**Hobbes:** So, there’s no High Pugilord, anymore?\n\n//Wrath’s eyes glance in several directions around the room. He appears unsure if he should speak.//\n\n**Wrath:** My sources say that you will find out in time.\n\n//Hobbes raises his eyebrow slightly at the man’s answer.//\n\n**Hobbes:** You could have just said “no”.\n\n**Wrath:** I could have, yes.\n\n//Hobbes begins to examine the door that the man is guarding, eyeing the carvings in the doorframe. Powerful weapons, their most important projects, and more all laid within the wood. However, three stuck out to him in particular://\n\n//[[[spc-001-ex|A powerful computer which nearly eliminated all selachians in the world.]]]//\n\n//[[[misterfrown-s-dumb-proposal|A sentient black hole which nearly erased all of the Centre’s funding.]]]//\n\n//[[[misterfrown-s-dumber-proposal|An awful dress code which nearly threw them into combat with the fashion police.]]]//\n\n//Maybe not as important as he thought.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Hey, uh, what’s that room behind you?\n\n**Wrath:** Oh, this is the primary Oracle meeting room.\n\n**Hobbes:** Really?\n\n**Wrath:** Yeah.\n\n**Hobbes:** Do you think I could, like… just pop in for a second?\n\n**Wrath:** Are you serious?\n\n**Hobbes:** Yes.\n\n**Wrath:** I know you have Oracle blood on your hands.\n\n**Hobbes:** Okay, in my defense, those were all accidents.\n\n//Wrath lets out a large sigh.//\n\n**Wrath:** To be frank, I would have killed you where you stand if O-13 did not personally request for your presence.\n\n**Hobbes:** He what?\n\n**Wrath:** I’m just as surprised as you are, believe me.\n\n//Wrath steps out of the way, gesturing towards the door.//\n\n**Wrath:** So, anyway, just head on in, I guess.\n\n**Hobbes:** Oh, thanks.\n\n**Wrath:** No problem.\n\n//Hobbes opens the wooden door and steps in the room, finding it devoid of life apart from one man, standing in front of the glass wall at the back. He stands near a large, battered computer that had been crushed by a steel cage. O-13 turns around, an unreadable expression on his face as it sees the Initiative agent.//\n\n**O-13:** I’ve been expecting you.\n\n//The agent looks around the room, confused.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Where’s O-12?\n\n//O-13 gestures to the floor, where O-12’s corpse still laid.//\n\n**Hobbes:** Oh.\n\n**O-13:** Yeah.\n\n**Hobbes:** So, just you, huh?\n\n**O-13:** Seems that way.\n\n**Hobbes:** Hm.\n\n**O-13:** Look, I think I’m just going to make this easier for the both of us.\n\n**Hobbes:** What do you mean?\n\n//The Oracle sighs.//\n\n**O-13:** Look, I can’t… I haven’t fully succumbed. At least, not yet. I’ll be able to help you until it happens.\n\n**Hobbes:** You want to… help me? What’s your game, traitor?\n\n**O-13:** Traitor?\n\n**Hobbes:** I know what you did. You formed the Containment Initiative and then abandoned it! How could you?\n\n//O-13 stays silent for a moment. He appears sad.//\n\n**O-13:** I formed the Initiative because I had always known in my heart that there were other methods which would work better over pugilism. When that “Foundation” appeared and attempted to enlighten us on the ways of containment, I realized that it was what I had believed in for so long, without even recognizing what it was. But then... I found something horrible. I realized that I could not contain it from my seat as Driver of the Containment Initiative.\n\n//He turns back to face the mountains again, a solemn expression on his face.//\n\n**O-13:** In truth, my position as Oracle was the best chance I had to contain it. When I received an offer to come back, I couldn’t refuse it. No matter how much I no longer agree with the Centre’s ideals, I recognize that I need to be here until my usefulness runs out as well.\n\n**Hobbes:** I don’t understand what you’re talking about.\n\n**O-13:** You will, soon enough. Look, I know you know about the button we keep in the room closest to this office, the one capable of dropping iron cages on all Centre Compounds. I designed it myself should we ever need it, but I soon realized that it would never work.\n\n**Hobbes:** Bullshit.\n\n**O-13:** Go and try to push it. I won’t stop you.\n\n//Hobbes lingers in the room for a moment, staring at the Oracle. Eventually, he spots a door at the side of the room, which he surmises to be the door O-13 had mentioned. He walks towards it and prepares to enter the room.//\n\n**O-13:** Just don’t say that I didn’t warn you.\n\n**Hobbes:** You… didn’t warn me.\n\n**O-13:** I didn’t?\n\n**Hobbes:** I don’t remember an explicit warning. You just said this wouldn’t work.\n\n**O-13:** I mean that’s pretty much a warning.\n\n**Hobbes:** You didn’t say it was.\n\n**O-13:** Whatever! I warn you, are you happy now?\n\n**Hobbes:** No, you just warned me.\n\n**O-13:** Just enter the goddamn room.\n\n**Hobbes:** Okay, sheesh.\n\n//The agent opens the door and quickly enters the other side, leaving it to slam behind him haphazardly.//\n\n//O-13 sighs.//\n\n**O-13:** Sucks to be him.\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**13.

Undeterred, he elects to continue.//\n\n//As he walks, several large screens on the walls he hadn’t noticed suddenly spring to life with static. After a moment, they suddenly begin to depict a variety of scenes.//\n\n//Some were from his life before the Initiative: the first thing he had contained when he was but a lad in school, him as a teenager hopelessly waiting for his father to come home after he left to get milk, and when he was first approached by whom he would learn later were two agents from the Initiative.//\n\n//However, most of them depicted the current states of the members of Oracle he had assisted in the demises of. Thirteen screens, with only one depicting a living man, who still watched the mountains in quiet contemplation. His expression visibly appeared off for the first time, as if he hadn’t truly comprehended the gravity of his actions until that moment.//\n\n//Hobbes shakes his head in rapid succession before continuing down the hall, his expression less confident than it was before.//\n\n//He makes his way to the end, opening a door identical to the one he found previously. He briefly turns back to stare down the hallway once again, the screens still assaulting his vision, before he enters the next room.//\n\n//The room Hobbes finds himself in is vast, with tall walls extending into a circular ceiling made up of a water tank analogous to one found in aquariums. A group of selachians, severely bruised from years of pugilism, float within it aimlessly.//\n\n//In the center of the room is a standard Centre terminal, which Hobbes approaches. As he gets closer, it suddenly activates, revealing a map of the entire world. On this map, hundreds of little dots suddenly appear, each corresponding to a Centre facility across the globe. On the terminal keyboard, a single button suddenly begins to glow blue, with a label visible://\n\n//[CONTAIN]//\n\n//Hobbes stares at the button for a moment in quiet bewilderment. He gently extends his hand forward, his pointer finger shaking in anticipation.//\n\n//Suddenly, a noise interrupts him. A ding on his phone, indicative of a text message. He glances at the button, then at his pocket with his phone, and repeats this process several times before eventually grabbing his phone out of his pocket to check his messages.//\n\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n##black|**HIGH PUGILORD**##\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Yo, wassup.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Who the hell is this?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Can't you read the name at the top?
