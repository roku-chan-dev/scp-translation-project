The entity is required to attend therapy twice weekly alongside monthly psychiatric evaluations. SCP-5199-B is allowed to be in contact with SCP-5199-A for a maximum of six hours per day, though this limit may be moved at the discretion of the entity’s psychological staff.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5199 is the designation of two connected anomalous entities referred to as SCP-5199-A and SCP-5199-B. \n\nSCP-5199-A is the designation of an animate statue composed of calcified tissue that resembles a human infant. This tissue is pliant enough to allow a full range of motion but displays no other anomalous properties. Beyond its material makeup, SCP-5199-A’s behavior, needs, and medical vitals are consistent with that of a non-anomalous child, though it shows no signs of growth nor standard development milestones. \n\nSCP-5199-B is a 27-year-old British woman by the name of Leida Kuusik who is responsible for SCP-5199-A's creation. Though SCP-5199-B was formerly capable of local reality manipulation, this property has so far proven to have been transient, and the entity no longer shows independent anomalous capabilities.\n\nBoth components of SCP-5199 were brought into containment on May 5th, 2019, shortly after the surgical removal of SCP-5199-A. Medical records of the birth and interviews with SCP-5199-B indicate that the fetus had been deemed a miscarriage via abdominal pregnancy following rupture of the uterine wall, a condition that SCP-5199-B was predisposed to due to its Nälkän[[footnote]]More commonly known as \"Sarkic\" or \"Sarkites\": in this case, a Proto-Sarkic population isolated in northern Estonia.[[/footnote]] ethnicity. It is hypothesized that the biological manipulation practiced by the group is responsible for the deleterious germ-line mutations affecting SCP-5199-B as opposed to //de novo// mutations in the individual herself.\n\nAn MRI performed on April 29th revealed that the unborn fetus had developed into a lithopedion.[[footnote]]A rare type of ectopic pregnancy in which the mother's body calcifies the dead fetus as an immune response.[[/footnote]] Sometime in the following week, SCP-5199-B underwent an involuntary stress-born Hume fluctuation, the result of which was the animation of SCP-5199-A.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:solid 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n= **Treatment Record: SCP-5199-A/1**\n= ##999999|**⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻**##\n**Date:** 11 May 2019\n**Presiding Physician:** Elias Hawthorne\n= ##999999|**⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻**##\n**Procedure:** Exploratory MRI of SCP-5199-A\n\n**Result:** SCP-5199-A is structurally uniform, though there are numerous sections of higher density in the head and upper torso.
