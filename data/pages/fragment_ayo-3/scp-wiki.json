  "content": "+ Lucky\n\nThis office had more color than her room. The chairs were a lot comfier too. A light blue shade along the walls, a small brown rug and two bookcases with every gapped filled. It was always testing rooms or just her room before. It finally feels like a real place. \n\nWell except for that strange chandelier. It hung low and shined so brightly, she couldn't tell where the bulbs were. Every now and then it would chirp like a baby bird.\n\nThere was a security guard by the door, and with them were usually cameras. She made a game of figuring out where they were on the way here, but she couldn’t find them in this room. She had to be extra good in the test then.\n\nIt looked like the guard was trying to hide his gun, but it was too big to hide ,geven behind his broad back.\n\nShe wasn’t used to security guards carrying such large weapons, even the people who protected her parent's didn’t carry ones that scary. But it did make some sense given what she heard. It wasn’t much, just from conversations guards would have while they were changing shifts, but it made more sense than what Dr. Wensley would tell her. The hardest part was acting like she didn’t notice him staring. Hopefully he’d go away when they got started.\n\nShe helped herself to one of the books to calm her nerves, quietly singing to herself as she explored its pages. \n\n“산~토끼토끼야~…” \n\nA book about Fae that made her nostalgic. It looked like a storybook, but the language was more textbook, detailing fairies and their history and societies. The images were like portals,  more photographs than paint.\n\nDad told her he had met fairies before, and they were like people; complicated. Mom didn't believe any of it though; even when 하모니 would sing songs about them. Maybe a fairy cursed her and that’s what they were studying. \n\n“…can’t be done!”\n\nThe handle began to twist as the muffled conversation leaked into the room. She placed the book back on the shelf and flung back into her seat.\n\nShe slapped her cheeks a few times to fill her mind and body with the power of effort.\n\n“Don’t be so nervous, Albert. Our future has never looked safer.” He jauntily strolled as his old joints would allow with a bag draped around his shoulder.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/integrity-project “Good morning Karl!”]\n\nHe shuffled in his step for a moment, almost dropping the papers he had in his hand. He then replied with a smile of his own.\n\n“Good morning, Zena!”\n\nZena? …oh yea that’s right. Zena! Effort paying off already\n\nKarl nodded to the security guard. He replied and stepped out of the room. Yay!\n\n“It’s good to see you in such good spirits. My how you’ve grown.”\n\nShe knew it, she had gotten fat. Even with this nasty hospital food.\n\n“Did I grow that much?”  She chuckled. “It’s only been a few months since we last spoke.”\n\nHe took a glance at one of the papers.\n\n“Ah…I suppose it has. Eyes have a way of tricking you as you get old you know.” He pulled out the chair across from her, placing the papers in a folder. “It’s important to celebrate your youth when you have it.” He said as he stored them back neatly.\n\n“I will!”\n\nAnother reason to get better.\n\n“Besides, the more tests we do, the sooner I can go home.”\n\n“Ah yes, that’s always the plan.” He pulled his chair back closer to the desk.\n\n“Yea. I mean when I’m not sick anymore I can go home, right?”\n\n“Have you been feeling sick?”\n\n “Huh? Oh no no no! I mean, my problem. My being horrible-at-everything disease. It’s why I’m here, right?”\n\n“It is. But there is so much more to it than that. We have much to discuss today, but to begin…” He gently folded his hands on the table as he got comfortable in his seat.\n\n“Is there anything you’d like to ask me? I can only imagine how many questions you have.”\n\n“I’m not sure…”\n\nShe did have a ton of questions, but she usually got the same answers. Karl was nice, but she didn’t want to bother him with questions he wasn’t allowed to answer. He’d probably even get in trouble because she said the wrong thing.\n\n“I’m a- actually more excited than anything!” She flashed her best smile.\n\nKarl restored his own. He reached back into his bag beside him.\n\n“Well as always, you’re free to ask me anything. I hope you like this office by the way. I had it arranged from our usual cream affair.” He strained a bit, what he sought just out of reach. \n\n“Much more comfortable don’t you think? You said you were quite a bookworm in school so I figured-” \n\nHe glanced at her wide eyed stare and stopped his rambling.\n \n“Actually.” He cleared his throat. \"I’m sure your concerns lie a bit deeper than décor, we don't need to prattle over such rigamarole.”\n\n“No, its ok! No one really talks to me about anything anymore and it sounds like you put a lot of thought into all this.\"\n\n\"Really?\" He paused his rummaging.  \"I was sure such a silly measure would have been abolished. I'm…sorry to hear that.\"\n\n\"No it's ok, I get it. Its not safe for me or any of the skips.\"\n\n“Skips?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's what I heard some of the security guards call the patients. It's not bad right?\"\n\n\"No it's perfectly fine. Just didn't expect such terms to reach the ears of our patients.\" \n\n\"Sorry, like I said they don't talk to me so I kind of eavesdropped.\"\n\n\"Well I can't imagine personnel would talk about anything unpleasant in the company of a child.\"\n\n\"I've heard…some things.\"\n\n\"Anything in particular?\" He returned to his bag.\n\n“Nothing bad.” She recoiled. “Well, it is kind of scary to think about but, I heard the other ski-patients- are all weird like me. They keep using a word, I’m not sure what it means, but it seems like another word for-”\n\nWrong.\n\n“Different.”\n\n“I think the word you’re looking for is anomalous, my dear.”\n\n“Yea that’s it!”\n\n“Well, I can tell you, you’re not far off.” He pulled out a few small gadgets she couldn't quite tell what they did.\n\n“What I can tell you is an anomaly, put simply, is something extraordinary.”\n\nHe began rubbing his glasses with a cloth he pulled out so swiftly it appeared as if he summoned it between his fingers.\n\n“Anomalies can be many things. There are some that are very strange, weird and quirky and they are all indeed, very, definitively different.\"He gently placed his glasses back to his face.\n\nShe tilted her head as she lingered on his explanation. They still didn’t sound different from diseases, just stronger ones.\n\n“In the end what we wish to do is the same no matter the anomaly, to understand them.\n\n“So, they really are dangerous?”\n\n“Some of them are, until we understand them. That is why we do the research we do, so we can take steps to ensure that an anomaly is no longer a threat.”\n\nSo **//she//** was really dangerous. She had a feeling, it made her stomach turn just thinking about it, but as she slunk deeper into her seat each word made it clearer.\n\n“Then, that’s why I can’t see my family then right?” She trembled, not looking away from the desk below her.\n\nHe was quiet, leaning back woefully in his chair. With a heavy sigh he spoke “I’m sorry Zena, th-.”\n\nHer head fell into the desk with a thud.\n,,//##E8E9E8|Make sure she never tries this again.##//,,\n\n“Why?”\n\n“We’re here to study the why, and the how as well as-”\n\n“I mean why-”\n\nHer? What did she do wrong?\n\n“...did this happen? How did I get sick?\"\n\n“Zena, can you take a deep breath for me?”\n\nShe raised her head and inhaled but as she tried to exhale, she coughed.\n\n“You’ve done nothing wrong, my dear. We’re not always sure why anomalies happen to certain people, sometimes it’s a simple matter of time and place. Sometimes it’s just fortune at play.”\n\nHe put a hand on her shoulder.\n\n“But what you have does not have to be a curse. I would say your anomaly is one of the luckier cases that I’ve seen.”\n\n“It doesn’t feel lucky. I just suck at everything.”\n\n\"Oh Zena.”\n\nRight. That’s not what he wanted to hear. She had to try harder.\n\n“I understand given what you’ve been through, you see these abilities as a curse, but I’d like to ask you to trust me to conduct our quick test before continuing the topic, can you do that Zena?\n\nShe nodded. Not like she had a choice.\n\n“Thank you. I think it may change your perspective.  That makes all the difference concerning anomalies.”\n\nThe tests. She just had to show she wasn’t dangerous. That she wasn’t an anomaly.\n,,//##E8E9E8|You're a lady act like it!##//,,\n\nShe shuffled in her seat, starting to feel a chill in her spine as he pulled out three Rubik’s cubes from the bag, placing each on the desk. They were all shuffled differently.\n\n“You said your record in middle school was 7 seconds. I think we can beat that today.”\n\nThree chances. Three chances to embarrass herself.\n\n“Today’s test will be a little different. If you concentrate and listen carefully, we are sure to get results.”\n\nThree chances.\n\n“Zena.” He cleared his throat and tapped the left most cube. “Would you kindly solve this cube in 6 seconds or less?”\n\nHer eyes twitched. She picked up the cube slowly. Once she had placed her other hand upon it, she began shuffling its sides around with fervor. It wasn’t long before she placed the cube back on the table with its siblings. Karl clicked his stopwatch in step with the chirp of the chandelier.\n\n“5.23 seconds, excellently done.”\n\n“No, its-”\n\n“I asked for 6 seconds or less and you succeeded, that’s progress.”\n\n“But…” it wasn’t complete. Just a corner off. One stupid corner she couldn’t get.\n\n“You are doing fine, Zena, we’re working towards the goal of isolating the key parts of your anomaly.”\n\nRight that word. This was all to figure out what’s wrong with her.\n\n“For this next cube.” He seemed careful about how he asked today.\n\n“Please resolve this cube as accurately and quickly as you possibly can.”She froze for a moment, leaving Karl bewildered in the silence. \n\nHer eyes lost all their color. A twinge of sweat breached his shining head as he blinked. His eyes opened with the chirp. She was grimacing at the cube.\n\nConfused, Karl looked back at it and noticed the sides had been completed.\n\n“That was magnificent.”\n\n“The bottom is all wrong.” Without missing a beat. She didn’t even point at it. \n\nHe lifted the cube and indeed the final side was an array of colors.\n\n“This is all going accordingly, it’s important you believe that as much as I do, Zena.”\n\n“Ok…”\n\nThat was good, right? Keep trying.\n\n“Now then…”\n\nHe picked up the last one and handed it to her himself. “Resolve this cube until it is 200% complete.”\n\nShe held the cube in her hand. She focused on it, examining it with trance stillness. Karl fetched a small cloth from one of his pockets and wiped his dome.\n\n\"알겠어\"\n\nThis time she started immediately, her eyes staying empty as she processed the cube.\n\nKarl adjusted his glasses, studying her hands. He noticed that she had resolved the cube once, but her hands continued to move, splitting it again and redoing it before finally placing it on the table.\n\n“10.27 seconds.”\n\nColor returned to her eyes as she gazed at the cube. Each side, a nation its own color. Perfect even on the bottom as Karl noticed, lifting up the cube. Her eyes welled up.\n\n“Remarkably done, Zena.” He said with the enthusiasm of an old wizard. \n\n“With perseverance and a new p- “\n\n“But it’s all wrong!” She yelled, slamming her hands on the table. She quickly covered her mouth as her cheeks flushed, noticing Karl’s look of concern.\n\n“…sorry.”\n\nOf course she had to do something stupid, just to embarrass herself some more. She knew that look. The confusion and worry. Soon he was going to make excuses for her. He already had been.\n\nHis gaze left her for a moment to inspect the cube.  Up close, it seemed ordinary and complete. But he noticed the longer his eyes lingered on it, the colors began to feel somewhat…off. Like they were getting away from his eyes.\n\nHe reached into his bag and pulled out a small device, it looked like some high-tech radar. He ran it across the cube, and it began to chatter, like the bugs gathering in the summer night. \n\nHe slowly placed it back on the table.\n\n“I’m having trouble understanding my dear, what is wrong with it?”\n\n“The colors on the other one.”\n\nHe looked at the other two cubes on the table. Same as ever. “I only got one side done.”\n\n“Zena, which cube are you referring to?”\n\nShe pointed to the cube in his hands. “The uhm-other…”\n\nHis fingers caressed his chin, looking at the chandelier, puzzled. Maybe it was because it didn't chirp for a while, or that it wasn't as bright. Eventually, something seemed to finally click.\n\nHe pulled out another device, this one was much smaller. He pressed it against his glasses, and she noticed some lines appear on them. She wasn’t quite sure, her eyes were still a bit wet, but she swore the frames seemed to shrink and stretch too. He muttered something about…calibration? \n\nThen suddenly backed away, almost falling on his back as he slid passed the chair. Did she hurt him, somehow?\n\n“Zena, how did you see this?” He said with as little breath as he could spare.\n\n“I…”\n\nSee? She couldn’t actually see anything but the cube. She just…knew it was wrong somehow. It had to be, right? She did it.\n\nKarl’s special goggles flashed as he fawned over the cube.\nHe took off his glasses, rubbed his eyes, then sighed.\n\n“My dear Zena Cho, let me begin by congratulating you on being the first human being to successfully complete a Rubik’s cube by I’d say-” He placed his glasses to his face to inspect the cube. “at least one hundred and twenty nine percent.”\n\nZena wiped her face one more time for good measure, before looking at the cube again. Her face contorted until she couldn’t bear to stare at it anymore and hung her head.\n\n“That’s not 200.” She muttered.\n\n“Perspective my dear.”\n\n“Its not 200.”\n\nShe only heard his sigh, but she knew she was bringing his energy down. She was trying, but how could she be satisfied with…that?\n\n“Certainly, it is not resolved by two hundred percent.” She heard the chair scrape the floor as it shifted. “If we look at it another way, while I requested 200%, an impossible task to begin with, you took that challenge head on and still managed to exceed expectation.”\n\n“It doesn’t mean anything if it’s not done properly…”\n\n“It means we’ve got results and with results like these we can move forward.”\n\n“Forward?” Her head rose to see he was now pacing as he held the cube.\n\n“Zena, what exactly is it that you believe we do here?”\nShe was quiet, shuffling nervously in her seat.\n\n“It’s ok, there’s no wrong answer here.”\n\n“You’re a hospital, right? It seems like a super-secret hospital. You said my disease was called an anomaly, so it just made sense to me.”\n\n“Well, not quite.” He stood up from his chair.\n\n“Yes, you see anomalies in and of themselves are only dangerous as far as we lack an understanding of them. But even so there are some people and creatures who are anomalous and willingly use these abilities to harm-”\n\n\n ,,//##E8E9E8|WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?##//,,\n//**“FUCK! SHE GOT ME IN THE LEG!”**//\n,,//##E8E9E8|THE LITTLE BITCH!##//,,\n\n\n“…But where there are those who use these abilities irresponsibly, there are those who do the opposite. We aim to find afflicted persons like yourself who are unique in their want to use their anomaly responsibly.”\n\n…\n\n“…Zena?”\n\n“But I can’t use my anomaly at all. I can only do what I’m told.” She couldn’t even do that.\n\n“Zena, you just manipulated the dimensions of a cube outside of our reality without leaving any residual.”\n\n“I don’t know what that means.” She said flatly.\n\n“It means you have a gift, one that is used to help others, in any way \nyou can. I find that to be a beautiful thing.”\n\nShe tried to cover her face like she just remembered she was in the middle of crying.\n\n“I’m sorry Karl. I'm acting like such a baby.”\n\n“It is a difficult situation, there’s no shame in emotions.”\n\n“It’s just...I really want to help; I do. But it doesn’t feel like something I can control.”\n\n“Then tell me what it does feels like.”\n\n“It feels like someone’s making fun of me. Like every time I try to do something this… anomaly keeps telling me I can’t do it.”\n\nAnd she couldn’t.\n\n\"Zena...\" He returned to his seat, placing the cube on the table before he began. \n\n“The task we are burdened with as scientist is to reason what is or isn’t possible. What I've found as an old man who's had his hand in many an experiment, is that if there is a thing in this world that is well and truly impossible, then it is merely a thing no one  considered worth reasoning. We can look at failure as the end, but I prefer to see each failure as a bridge towards success. That way, you'll be able to look upon your path fondly from the other side.\"\n\nHe eyed her 2nd attempt on the table, indistinguishable from the 3rd. He raised it and exposed its shameful underside. “It’s all a matter of where you’re looking from my dear.”\n\nHer shaking finally stopped, and her chills began to warm. Only a little bit, but warmer for sure. \n\n\"I came here today for results above 100% and I have been more than satisfied.”\n\nHe seemed so excited. Even though she messed up that cube. \nThese doctors have been working hard on her disease while working on so many others. It’s got to be hard on them. All she had to do is what she was told, that shouldn’t be this hard.\n\nEven she didn’t know what she did to that cube. There’s a lot of things she had done here that she didn’t know. She didn’t even know what this building looks like and it’s been…\n\n“Six months.”\n\nKarl quietly listened to the girl’s words as more sweat slipped through his scalp.\n\n“Six months and I still can’t do anything right.”\n\n“Right, rather, success is a matter of perspective.” \n\n“Will perspective really help with an anomaly?”\n\n“I believe it can. It's a major part of ontokinetics.”\n\n“onto…”\n\n“Hmm? Oh yes, it’s another name of what your particular anomaly is called. Reality warping, as it were. Well the study of existence to be more precise.”\n\n“Reality warping? Like some kind of comic?” She chuckled.\n\n“Oh. I didn’t know you were into such things, Zena.”\n\nShe wasn’t that interested; she was just mad the first time she took one of Jun’s. But thinking about it now, she wished she had one of those comics now, she liked Ace the Crusader, she wondered if it was still in the sky island arc.\n\nHe pondered for a moment considering his next words. “Well if you know what comes with great power, I suppose you could use those stories as inspiration.”\n\nOf course. This was just another thing she had to prove. How relieved would her family be if instead of coming back sick, she was able to do anything they wanted? If she was able to follow what they said, perfectly? She really was lucky!\n\nKarl leaned back in his seat, noticing the grin appearing on Zena’s face.\n\n“Well, then, I take it we have your support?”\n\n“Yes! I mean…what do you want me to do?”\n\n“Well it’s not what we want you to do as much as it’s what we wish to explore with you.”\n\nHis mouth hung open as if to continue but he stared at her with a look she wished she hadn’t recognized so well. He then reached into his bag again.\n\n“Honestly an old man’s rambling is hardly persuasive. Please.”\n\nHe revealed a small laptop to her. At least it looked like one. It seemed anything could come out of that bag. He flipped the screen, and it turned on revealing a grainy and pixelated image. \n\nIt eventually cleared up to reveal a massive castle stuck in a cave. The poor image quality already made it difficult to make out but as she continued to stare, she noticed little oddities, like some towers seemed to be floating, and it was hard to see where the building stopped, and the cave began.\n\n“Introducing Auxiliary Research Facility 120! One of the SCP foundations latest and greatest installations for the sake of a greater tomorrow!”\n\nSCP Foundation. She felt like she had heard the name of this place before, but she never saw it written on anything.\n\n“In this little building, big brains are working with some of our most amazing SCPs; all to understand this funny little thing called reality.\"\n\nAs the jubilant voice spoke, the images continued to change. Faces of other doctors, different children in tattered clothes, a creature that looked like a human who didn’t know what a human was, Some monks with unfamiliar markings on their face, a girl holding a ball of light in her hands, A doll that scared her, another boy with a wide smile surrounded by smaller versions of himself. Was any of this real?\n\n\"The abilities of reality warpers were tricky to figure out how to study safely, but thanks to years of dedication and the ever-advancing march of science and technological advancement, a bunch of whizkids are ready to help young people like you learn to use their abilities!”\n\nLike a school. All she had to do was study. Of course! She could do this!\n\n“That’s…yes! Haha yes! Please teach me!”\n\n“There’s a nice change in tune! I know we can get you there no matter how long it takes!”\n\nShe began hopping in place. This laughter filling her lungs, the folds of her smile etched on her face, the weightlessness of her heart.  This couldn’t be real!\n\n…\n\n“How long will it take?”\n\n“Well, it’s difficult to say. It may take only a few months or years.” He saw the makings of a reassured smile crease her face, but he knew why it wouldn’t bloom. \n\n“…But projections say it’d most likely be a decade before we could be sure.”\n\nOf course. There it was.\n\n “Your anomaly is…complicated.” I’m afraid it’s not just information you need. It’s the nature of the anomalous to be difficult.” He sighed heavily before closing the laptop. \"But l can guarantee you will have full control of your abilities and you’ll have plenty of support. You won't be alone!\"\n\nTen years. \n\n“You said I can’t go home because I’m dangerous, but if I know how all this works maybe I wouldn’t suck so much. Maybe I //could// help.”\n\n“If you help us, you would be helping the world in no small measure, I can assure you.”\n\n“And it would mean, I’m not a dangerous anomaly, right?”\n\n“That’s the plan!” Karl perked up.\n\n“Ok, I’ll do it! I want to go!\"\n\n“Are you certain? There’s no rush if there’s more you’d like to consider.”\n\n“I don’t wanna see my family if I’m still messed up. I just have to try harder; I know I can do it, then…” She failed to hide her blushing face with her hands. “They’ll be so proud of me.”\n\nWith that, he gathered the cubes and his bag.\n\n“We’re glad to continue cooperating with you Ms. Cho.” He made a gesture between a nod and a bow.\n\n\"When will I see you again?\"\n\n“There is due process I must abide by, but your consent today will do wonders to move things through the pipeline.” He noticed her sad and confused expression. “Apologies. Just know I’ll handle the boring paperwork, so we can get you there quickly. We’ll see each other then.”\n\n“Oh…ok…” Her eyes drifted back to the shelves of books, as she practiced the new word quietly to herself. Ten years…\n\n“Karl!” She ran up to the shelf and after a few jumps managed to pull down a book that caught her eye. “This is it right? Ontokinetics? Can I take this book back to my room, please!“ \n\nIt was the most flustered she had ever seen him look. He even peered over his shoulder, were cameras watching him too?\n\n“You’re a young scholar right?” She was surprised when he knelt to her level. She nodded. “You know how a scholar treats their books right?”\n\n“Yes sir!” \n\n“Then you can keep these as long as you use them appropriately.” He handed her the 2nd volume of Intro to Ontokinology.\n\n“This doesn’t feel right. They won’t punish you?” \n\n“Perspective, my dear. Books are for studying, so would it not be right to use them that way?”\n\nShe started giggling, hoisting the books like stolen diamonds.\n\n“Now you may remain seated. Personnel will be here to escort you back to your room shortly.” He returned each item to the bag. He made his way to the door as she sank into the seat until she was practically falling off.\n\n“Thank you Karl!”\n\nThe security guard re-entered the room as Karl opened the door.\n\nShe failed to contain her giggling, shuffling in her chair like she had been tickled.\n\nThe guard shook his head as he adjusted the tool on his back.\n \"That's one messed up kid.\"\n\n^^##fffafa| See?
