Now, I understand that this specific anomaly may be a bit hard to deal with, however, you were assigned to this SCP and are expected to make sure all research relating to it is accurate and precise.

I have begun to add the footnotes you asked for to the article. And, while I have you, I was thinking about being reassigned from SCP-8929 and given a new anomaly. While I am extremely grateful for the opportunity to study this anomaly, I believe I lack the experience necessary to handle a SCP that manipulates any information I write about it. Perhaps this would be better suited for a researcher above me and I could be given a much simpler anomaly?

Thank you for getting started on the footnotes. As for getting reassigned, I’m sorry but I cannot fulfill that request. Our senior researchers have been very busy with new projects, and orders coming from the higher ups require all newly hired researchers to complete at least one article on their own.\n> \n> I understand SCP-8929 has been quite an issue at our site, but after looking at your previous accomplishments under your previous Senior Researcher, we believe you are properly equipped to deal with this anomaly.

I’ve done it three fucking times.\n\n//Roberts now appears visually agitated as he clenches his fists.//\n\nANDERSON: Geez, that sounds annoying.\n\nROBERTS: Yeah, it’s as shitty as it sounds.\n\nANDERSON: Gotta be something you can do, right?\n\nROBERTS: What //can// I do? If I write an article with barely any information, it’s practically useless. If I write one with too much, then the SCP just rewrites it all into a bunch of stupid bullshit.\n\nANDERSON: Fucked either way, huh?\n\nROBERTS: Pretty much. Story of my life.\n\n//Anderson leans back in his chair slightly.//\n\nANDERSON: Well, you can't just sit here and mope all day.\n\nROBERTS: I know that. It's just… I thought I was ready for this but I’m just… not.\n\n//Roberts lets out a large sigh as his shoulders slump.//\n\nANDERSON: Hey, come on, pick your chin up. I thought you wanted to be a researcher?\n\nROBERTS: I thought I did, but looking at it now, it’s obvious none of the researchers respect me.\n\nANDERSON: How do you know?\n\nROBERTS: Because they dumped their problem anomaly on me so they wouldn’t have to deal with it. Did you know this thing was assigned to three different researchers and they all gave up?\n\nANDERSON: Then, you’ll just have to be the first.\n\n//Anderson gives Roberts a pat on the back.//\n\nROBERTS: Maybe. I just don’t wanna look stupid in front of everyone. I wanna prove I can do this, you know?\n\nANDERSON: Well, no matter what happens, don’t take it personally, you know? \n\nROBERTS: I know. I’m just a bit bummed out that nothing's working. You wouldn’t happen to have any ideas, would you?\n\n//Anderson pauses to think for a moment.//\n\nANDERSON: Well, all I’ll say is I’ve always wondered why you guys never try talking to it.\n\nROBERTS: Talking to it? You want me to have a conversation with a book?\n\nANDERSON: Not the weirdest thing that’s ever happened here. I’m not saying it’ll work or fix things. It could be doing it automatically… Wouldn’t be the first time.\n\nROBERTS: So, what’s your point?\n\nANDERSON: Would you rather do the same thing the other researchers did, or do you want to think outside of the box?\n\n//Roberts takes a moment to think.//\n\nROBERTS: I guess you’re right. That’s actually a pretty good idea.\n\nANDERSON: Not bad for a meathead, eh?\n\n//Roberts and Anderson both laugh.//\n\nROBERTS: What if it doesn’t work, though?\n\nANDERSON: Then you’ll come up with an even better idea. You’re overthinking it. Just go try it and see what happens.\n\nROBERTS: Yeah, yeah, I can do that. Thanks, man.\n\nANDERSON: Knock em’ dead.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[END LOG]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[ACCESS SCP-8929-SS TEST?]\" hide=\"[ACCESS GRANTED]\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"skip_box terminal\" data-title=\"Addendum 8929.3: Contact between Junior Researcher Alex Roberts and SCP-8929.\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"no-unfold\"]]\n[[div class=\"containercontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"container\" style=\"padding-left:2em;padding-right:2em;\"]]\n+* [!-- DO NOT ERASE THIS \"+*\". --]\n[[div_ class=\"overlayback\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n##01a1eb|Protocol-8929-SS: Contact##\n[[/=]]\n> ----\n> ROBERTS: SCP-8929, this is Alex Roberts. This is my attempt at communication to see if you have any sense of self-awareness.\n>  \n> ROBERTS: You have shown potential signs of sentience as seen through your rewrites of my articles, so if you are able to comprehend and understand my message, please reply.\n>  \n> ROBERTS: SCP-8929, I repeat, if you can understand and process what I am saying, may you give me a sign?\n>  \n> ROBERTS: Hello?\n\n> A NEW USER HAS JOINED THE CHAT\n\n> ROBERTS: Huh?\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Hi.##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: Is this really SCP-8929 speaking?\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Yeah, it's-a-me! :3##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: I see, my theory was correct. Moving on, if you do not mind, I have some questions I'd like to ask you.\n>  \n> ##C85B5F| SCP-8929: I’m not answering shit! >:O##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: Why not?\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: You’re a jerk! A mean, old jerk!##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: That is a quite childish response.\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: I don’t really care.##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: There's no need to be hostile. My first question for you is why have you been rewriting my articles.\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Not answering.##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: Answer the question.\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: No!##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: If you're going to be stubborn, is there anything I can do to make you talk to me?\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Uhh, yeah, actually! First of all, fuck off with the \"researcher\" bullshit! I may be a book but I know my rights!##\n>  \n> ROBERTS: I am a researcher. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Uh-huh. Do all researchers act like a dick to the SCPs they're assigned to or is it just you?## \n> \n> ROBERTS: When have I ever treated you poorly? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Oh, you don't even know? How far is your head up your ass???## \n>  \n> ROBERTS: That is irrelevant. Again, may you please answer the question?\n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Why should I?## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Because it'll end this conversation much faster.\n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: K.Y.S.## \n>  \n> ROBERTS: That doesn't even warrant a response. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Whatever! You wanna ask me some questions? Drop the \"researcher\" shit and talk to me like a normal person.## \n>  \n> ROBERTS: All Foundation personnel are required by protocol to talk in clinical language when using Foundation resources. I cannot break that protocol. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Suck my non-existent dick then.## \n\n> ##8b0003|USER “SCP-8929” HAS LEFT THE CHAT.## \n\n> ROBERTS: SCP-8929? Are you kidding? \n>  \n> ROBERTS: Okay, I'll drop the clinical tone. Now, can you answer the question?\n\n> ##13ff09|USER “SCP-8929” HAS REJOINED THE CHAT.## \n\n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Fiiiine! I guess I can :p##  \n>  \n> ROBERTS: Well?\n>  \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: I rewrote all of that garbage because it's boring! Be a better writer next time lol## \n>  \n> ROBERTS: I know for a fact that's not true. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Smells like cope## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Okay, let me try something else. Why did you write everything you said in the third article you altered? Can you answer that? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: No.## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Why not? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: I don't want to.## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Why? You have human-like qualities, so I would presume that talking about your issues would help you, even a little. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Yeah, sure, like you actually care about my feelings lol## \n> \n> ROBERTS: I'm just trying to help. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Oh, please, cut the bullshit. You just want to let you write your dumb article about me and then forget I even existed, right???## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Why would I do that? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Uhh, because I'm boring as shit? Who would remember an anomaly that's just \"a thing that does a thing\"???## \n> \n> ROBERTS: We're professionals trained to document anomalies.\n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Well, are you going to get mad at me for wanting to be more than a project? All you did was insult me and my work and put a bunch of stupid footnotes all over it and now you just want to play the victim and I don't know why!## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Why? You don't know why? You have rewritten three of my articles about you that I wrote from scratch into nonsense that got progressively worse, and now instead of cooperating, you have done nothing but insult me. And you wonder why I'm frustrated? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Meh## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Can you just tell me why you would do this? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: BECAUSE I WANTED TO FUCKING IMPRESS SOMEONE, DUMBASS!## \n> \n> ROBERTS: You wanted to impress someone? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: No shit??? Like I said, I know I'm boring, so I wanted to tweak some things to make me sound cooler!## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Why would you need someone to think you're \"cool\"? Like I said, we're not a horror-fiction fan club. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Yeah, but I don't want someone to look at my real article and then just forget about it. I wanna be more than a thing that just exists.## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Well, if that's the case, why have you been so aggressive?\n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: I dunno. I was just pissed after all of those footnotes so I wanted to make you mad, which wasn't too cool of me........## \n> \n> ROBERTS: It's alright.\n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Ughhh, now I feel like shit for being mean.## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Like I said, it's fine. Now that we've made some progress, will you stop the rewrites? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Yeah, I'll stop the rewrites. Even I have to admit they were pretty shit lol.## \n> \n> ROBERTS: Good. \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Man, does this mean I have to go back on the shelf though :<## \n> \n> ROBERTS: That depends. Do you promise to stop messing with my articles? \n> \n> ##C85B5F|SCP-8929: Promise!## \n> \n> ROBERTS: In that case, maybe this isn't the end for you.\n> \n[[=]]\n##01a1eb|END TEST##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"[ACCESS SCP-8929?]\" hide=\"[ERROR]\"]]\n[[div class=\"skip_window\" data-title=\"SCP-8929 Document Update\"]]\n\n++++ **NOTICE FROM HEAD RESEARCHER MADDISON YU**\n----\n\nIt appears you have accessed an outdated version of SCP-8929's document.
