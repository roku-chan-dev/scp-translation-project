It was an all-out war, the reborn Kalmaktama Empire fighting against their metallic obstacles. No side was winning, but neither was losing either. Each blow, each strike, each blast in the name of MEKHANE could be felt across the world.\n\nRobert Bumaro, the High Priest, waded through the battlefield, effortlessly slaying any organic monstrosities that dared cross his bath. Across the battlefield, his [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]so fucking hot and sexy opponent[[/span]]opponent[[/span]] could be spotted, leading the charge ontop a moving mountain of skin and muscle. The Forged One marched his way towards the Grand Karcist, a legion of faithful Mekhanites following his wake. The Sorcerer King saw the oncoming [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]and how shiny and sleek his bald, metal head was[[/span]]gearhead[[/span]], and directed his [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]wondering how it'd feel riding his steely dan[[/span]]steed[[/span]] to... ,,how do blobs move? do they slide? yeah, they prob slide,, ...slide towards his [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]destined lover[[/span]]enemy[[/span]], engulfing the mechanic war machines as it went.\n\nAs soon as they got close to one another, [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]wishing they could tear each other's clothes off[[/span]]they went on the attack.[[/span]] Ion jumped down from his blob of flesh, his grotesque and [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]Bumaro's mind thought of what was under this man's robes, and lingered on another meaty staff[[/span]]meaty staff[[/span]] [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]much like how Cupid took aim at the two star-crossed lovers[[/span]]aimed at his heart[[/span]]. Bumaro held up his warforged hammer to protect himself from Ion's thrust, and the two crashed into one another, tumbling onto the ground, with Ion mounting Bumaro's metallic hips. The two stared at one another, blushing deeply[[footnote]] wait can boomaro blush?  [[/footnote]][[footnote]] idk can he?[[/footnote]][[footnote]] you know what his cheeks could probably rust[[/footnote]][[footnote]]how tf would they rust you fucking idiot it's beryllium bronze or some magic shit magic shit can't fucking rust you dumbass. why would bumaro build his own fucking face out of a metal that can rust? go ahead, fucking tell me, why would the high fucking preist of the church of the broken god build himself out of a shitty ass metal that can rust you rat bastard?[[/footnote]]. Their faces were mere centimeters apart.\n\nAfter a moment of silence, Ion was the first to speak.\n\n\"so we gonna kiss or?üò≥\"[[footnote]] yes they can speak emoji, fuck you. [[/footnote]]\n\n\"i mean..shi..hahahaüòèüòè\"\n\nok sex scene time\n\nwhen do i get my adult tag?\n\nok so like\n\nthis is my first time writing a sex scene so bare with me but\n\n##FEFEFE|ion tears off the high presit's pants and begins to pound, his meaty staff going in and out oooh so hot##\n\n##FEFEFE|they switched roles and bloomro began doing the oh so hot and totally cool pounding.##\n\n----\n\n##FEFEFE|\"Oh~, Bumaro-desu, I've never felt such a good, metal rod as yours!\" moaned Ion.##\n\n##FEFEFE|\"Nobody fucks like Ballmaro does, Ion. üòè\"##\n\n----\n\n##FEFEFE|The two acolytes bounded together in their love, Ion finding a new lover to replace his Klavigar Lovataar. i mean yeah she was hot and all, but Bloomberg? oooohhh, he was something else alright. Their climax could be felt around the world, their lust and desire for one another unifying the two religions. The Sarkic Church of the Broken God. wait that's a terrible name no.##\nok that's the sex scene. pretty hot, right?\n\nwhoops used wrong ink, guess you can't see it. sorry :( ##ffffff|:)##\n\nThe two lovers united their sides, their factions, and looked onwards. FLESH and MACHINE, now united as.. BIOTECHNOLOGY? Yeah, sure, that works. The BIOTECHNOLOGY Empire was poised to take over the world, and do that they shall.\nyou can downvote this now, right here ‚ñΩ\n[[module Rate]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\nbut...\n\nDown in the American Southwest, amongst the tents and smoke, jealousy was brewing. Five pillars of smoke surrounded this envy-filled man, jealous of Ion for getting that nice, nice chromejob. Who was this man, you ask? None other than\n\n+++ **BIG##ffffff|GIE##**\n\n+++ **CHEESE**\n\n+++ **HORACE**\n\nTo (hopefully not) be continued...\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
