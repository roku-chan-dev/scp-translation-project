She had a chance now. Maybe it only took ten years for the other patients, she could do it in half that time!\n\n…\n\n“그낭해!”\n\nIt didn’t matter how long, what was important was she got it right and didn’t make a fool of herself. This was her life now.\n\n…\n\nThis was her life now. Even though there was only her for it to bother, she wrestled with the thought as she struck her face with cold water. \t\t\t\t                                         ,,//##E8E9E8|This will be your room 2599. Please be mindful to keep it clean.##//,,\n\nFOCUS!\n\nThere was a lot she accepted all at once. She got her chance to be cured, at the cost of a family.\n\nEven now it was hard to take the thought of changing reality seriously. She splashed more water on her face as the alarm beckoned breakfast again. \n\nShe tried to take the thought of changing reality seriously.  \n“Do it you, fathead.\" She whispered to the universe.\n\nBreakfast was as terrible as ever, but she managed to take a bite out of the sausage this time. It came back up immediately, but it was progress. She needed all the nutrients she could get, even if they came from a nasty place. She started focusing on making sure no matter how bad it was she would finish her plate and minus the links had been consistent for 3 days now. She had to reign in her nerves, she couldn’t afford any more mistakes.\n\nShe wiped the bile off her face before discarding the tray. She studied the letter she had started the same night after her test. It was the fifth attempt, at least since last night, but she promised not to throw this one away.\n\n//--친애하는 엄마와--//\n\n //--아빠--//\n\n//To my mo//\n\n//--친애하는 할--//\n\n--//To J//--\n\n--//To the Chos//--\n\n--//My Family//--\n\n--//To Everyone who re//--\n\n--//To the Fam//--\n\n--//To Mr. and Mrs. Cho//--\n\n//I’m//\n\nShe felt she needed to write it, just in case. She didn’t know when they would allow her another one. But writing it felt like an admission. Before coming to a decision, the door opened. It was Dr. Jora along with a couple of guards.\n\n“Good morning, 2599. I see you had an early start.”\n\n“Good morning, Dr. Jora. I know. I've just been a little nervous…is it today?”\n\nDr. Jora nodded as she entered, clutching a clipboard to her chest.\n\n Her guards took stances around the room, Ms. Lyla was sure to stand behind Dr. Jora with her arm stuck to her waist. Zena rushed to the desk to swat the papers away. She regretted it immediately as some of her ontokinology notes were with it.\n\n“Please, have a seat ma’am.”\n\n“Wensley told me you were excited.” She chuckled as she took her chair.\n\n“…Was he mad?”\n\n“He’s just worried as you can imagine. It’s a different environment there at Facility 120.”\n\n“I know! I read the intros to ontokinetics. I’m ready. I want to know how to use my abilities and I want to be-“\n\nFree.\n\n“Useful.”\n\n“Useful?”\n\n“I mean like I want to be able help people. I feel like I’m finally getting better at all of this. Maybe all I needed was to accept I’ll never see my family again. Keehehehe.” \n\nDr. Jora was quiet. Zena quickly closed her mouth, shutting down her laughter and following apology. Dr. Jora had already told her about that.\n\n“There’s no shame in being open about how hard it is to handle all of this alone.“\n\n“You’re not coming with me Dr. Jora?” \n\n“Oh! No, I’m still needed here. It’s why I came early to see you off.”\n\n“Oh...well that’s fine. I’ve been ready for weeks!”\n\n“Are you having doubts? It’s ok to talk about it even now.”\n\n“It is a little scary…” she laughed nervously. “But ain’t no use in crying about it, right?”\n\n\"Z-2599, there’s a lot being asked of you and at your age it’s easy to confuse a sense of helplessness as maturity. Are you certain you’re ready?”\n\n“I don’t get it. Did Karl lie to me? Do they not want me?”\n\n“There is an interest in your anomaly but that's-\"\n\n“Then I’m ready. I’ve been studying hard for weeks. I didn’t get anywhere here. I won’t fail with people like Karl teaching me. I’ll get to make friends too!” The woman sighed a familiar sigh.\n\n“So, you have no concerns? No lingering feelings?”\n\nMore than she could hope to write, let alone speak.\n\n“Nope.”\n\nIt’s not like it mattered.\n\n“I’m ready.”\n\nDr. Jora put her pen to work on her clipboard without uttering a word. Zena tried to hide her wincing to the scratching, the silence surrounding them made it worse.\n\nShe stopped writing and once again sighed.\n\n“Even if it’s still hard to understand what being an SCP means for you, there's still-“\n\n“I said I’m ready.” Dr. Jora recoiled like the words bit her. She then pursed her lips and nodded quickly, taking in the girls affirmation.\n\n It //was// rude of her to interrupt like that, even if she meant it. \n\n“Alright, I will leave you and the research team to it.” She jotted some final notes down than rose to her feet.\n\n“Some staff will be here soon to get you set up.”\n\nShe made for the door but stopped just a few steps short. \n\n“Zena, do you know how long you’ve been here?”\n\nSix weeks right?\n\n“Six w- months! Six months.”\n\nShe didn’t seem angry. She just left after all that writing and nodding.  \n\nZena remained at the table, wrestling with the familiar cast of thoughts. She felt herself start to become tired again so she tried to keep herself focused thinking of how she would greet the other reality warpers. Should she use Zena or 2599? Would they do test together as a group. Would that be possible with her being…her? \n\nA group of men and women entered the chamber. She stood to greet the man in front.\n\n“2599, cooperate with the staff and listen to their instruction for 8 hours.”\n\n“Ok.”\n\nShe felt her body go limp despite it still following the researchers. As one approached and reached for her arm, she found more strength than usual to raise it.\n\nShe didn’t have much of a part to play, and despite how it made her feel, she was going to play it well.\n\n^^##fffafa|Don't be scared.^^##\n\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-m-gonna-be-alright/offset/4|I'm just feeling]]]\n[[/>]]",
