SCP-2511-A instances sighted on 29514 Karatsu appear to be alive, and seemingly require no apparatus to survive in a vacuum environment. Each instance appears to have a tumorous growth on a limb, which resembles growths found on SCP-3070-1.\n> \n> **Note:** Inspection of the Matsuura River in Karatsu City, Saga Prefecture, Japan indicates the disappearance of all SCP-2511-A instances in the river.

Studies of the surface show that the topography is unchanged and that the compression is non-corporeal. An investigation to determine if this is a cognitohazardous phenomenon is underway.\n> \n> **Note:** The Google Chromium browser on the SCP-3070-1's 2018 Macbook Pro was seen to be open, with multiple tabs showing [[[SCP-2721|SCP-2721-LYRE]]]'s Tumblr blog.\n\n> **Minor Planet:** 15907 Robot\n> \n> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 01-June-20██\n> \n> **Description:** A row of four crudely constructed humanoid mechanisms, standing and manipulating what appear to be keyboard musical instruments. \n> \n> **Note:** Each figure is connected by cable to an underground chamber.

Members of OTF ञ-12 reported hearing bells during retrieval.\n\n> **Minor Planet:** 75067 Vernalis\n> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 9-September-20██\n> \n> **Description:** A 97m sized pair of conga drums constructed from both chitin and human tooth enamel began orbit around the asteroid. At the same time, a 60m sized live specimen of //Liocarcinus vernalis//[[footnote]] Grey swimming crab. [[/footnote]] manifested on the conga drums and attempted to \"play\" them.\n> \n> **Note:** Upon retrieval by OTF ञ-12, the //Liocarcinus vernalis// specimen dematerialized and was not present on either the asteroid or the conga drums.\n\n> **Minor Planet:** 131288\n> **3070-A Discovery Date:** 23-May-20██\n> \n> **Description:** A ring system manifested, 12m from the middle of the asteroid with a width of 1km.
