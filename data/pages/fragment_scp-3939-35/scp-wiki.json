When not in testing it is to be kept in a standard containment locker of appropriate size.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3939 is a gramophone, or record player, of unknown date of origin but consistent with design and manufacturing trends of the 1930s. It has an octagonal wooden base constructed of polished mahogany and is imprinted with the logo of HMV at the time. Atop this base is a turntable which is connected to the gramophone mechanism and a large brass horn. All components are in good condition.\n\nSCP-3939 currently has a black vinyl record on the turntable, which is turning at a standard rate despite no visible source of power.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nSomeone just forgot to document it?\n\nThat doesn't seem likely. But, you have to admit, it's possible.\n\nThe system said that it's been here as long as the Site itself has. But, that could just be its way of saying that whoever found it forgot to put in the date of recovery.\n\nYou don't particularly want to mention that in the article — after all, you don't care about this skip, you just want your old job back, so everything here has to be //perfect// even if it's not your fault — so you leave it out. You can add it back if you find out.\n\nThat does still leave one question, though.\n\nWhat makes this thing an SCP? What makes it anomalous? What makes it something that jeopardises normalcy? What makes it something worth documenting in the first place? Why have you been tasked with this job?\n\nThe answer to that question will be a job for tomorrow.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/29 Publish the draft — it's time to go home.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
