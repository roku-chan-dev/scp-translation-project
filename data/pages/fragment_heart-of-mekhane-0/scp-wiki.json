These simple facts are often completely unknown to the average person, in our religion no less than in others. As followers of the Broken God, we should embrace knowledge at all costs, and yet many people in this congregation often know very little about the origins of our formative myths.\n\nTake, for example, the story of the Heart of Mekhane. Everyone reading this likely knows at least the basics of this myth. However, very few people know the deep history surrounding this myth, its development and the cultural contexts that have surrounded it throughout the years. The story has always been, at its core, about the obligation for us all to share the knowledge we have, and so I thought it would be a perfect story for this project.\n\nI have selected six versions of this story, some historical, some modern, and have arranged them in chronological order. They contradict each other in many different places, but that does not mean that I doubt that there is a fundamental truth in this story, and once found, it will help us obtain a clearer picture of Mekhane than ever before.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-family: 'Pinyon Script'; font-size: 250%; margin: 2px 0 5px;\"]]\n**- F.
