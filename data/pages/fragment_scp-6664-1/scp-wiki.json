SCP-6664 is not to be climbed, for fear of damaging its branches.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6664 is a tree of the species //##blue|Calocedrus decurrens##//, more commonly known as the ##blue|California incense-cedar##, currently located at ##blue|Site-86##. SCP-6664 is identical to other trees of its species, save for its anomalous effects.\n\nSCP-6664's anomalous effects activate whenever it is ##blue|damaged## by a human being. When a ##blue|human harms## SCP-6664, instead of ##blue|experiencing the effects of the attack## as expected, ##blue|SCP-6664 will incur no damage. Instead, the attacking individual will experience a lessened form of the damage applied, as well as receiving a written note somewhere on their person.## This ##blue|note## has been designated SCP-6664-1.\n\nSCP-6664-1 ##blue|is a handwritten note received by individuals who cause damage to SCP-6664##. SCP-6664-1 is ##blue|written in pencil on paper, and contains the text, \"See how it feels? Don't harm trees, please\", along with a crude drawing of a smiley face. The identity of the author of SCP-6664-1, if any, is unknown.##\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 6664.01: Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-6664 was discovered on January 28, 2014, after ##blue|Stephanie Mulberry##, a ##blue|Foundation junior researcher##, reported ##blue|kicking SCP-6664 while on a walk, and experiencing an immediate pain in her side. Upon kicking it several more times, she discovered## SCP-6664-1 and reported it as a possible anomaly. SCP-6664 was subsequently moved to ##blue|Site-86##.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//I just saw this article, and have noticed numerous errors.
