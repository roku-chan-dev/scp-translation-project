Affected personnel will attribute personhood to the object, believing it to be a human being named 'Dave' who urgently requires their aid. [[span class=\"st\"]]**##0087BD|SCP-6762##**[[/span]]'s goals vary with each exercise of compulsion, but always result in the affected individual travelling across multiple sectors of Area-12 and frequently acquiring one or more [[span class=\"st\"]]**SCP-6762-1**[[/span]] instances. Once their task is complete, the affected individual will voluntarily release [[span class=\"st\"]]**##0087BD|SCP-6762##**[[/span]] and all associated instances and express satisfaction with their accomplishment. They will express persistent confusion when confronted with the reality of the situation; the duration of this confusion is conclusively linked with the subject's Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV).\n\nWhile no purpose to [[span class=\"st\"]]**##0087BD|SCP-6762##**[[/span]]'s activities has been discerned, each case of compulsion has resulted in positive outcomes for the affected individuals as assessed by the Area-12 chief psychologist. A quorum of Area-12's senior staff have deemed the object a sufficiently low threat to continue the present, admittedly ineffective, containment measures for the forseeable future, and potential reclassification to [[span class=\"st\"]]**##0087BD|__THAUMIEL-CLASS__##**[[/span]] is presently under consideration. In opposition is Assistant Facility Researcher Dr. Quentin T. Toth, who submitted a decommissioning request following her own interaction with the object. This request has been denied.\n\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]**##0087BD|SCP-6762##**[[/span]]'s sapience beyond compulsion events has not been conclusively proven.
