Authors, whether they realize or not, allow minor smidgens of their inner workings to occupy their characters; thus, when writing for another author's character, you must find what you have in common with that author. You must allow yourself to communicate vulnerability with the other author, and insert yourself into the character.\n\nIt is the ultimate exercise in empathy, I believe. This website, and its community, is founded on the shared experience; connecting to one another's stories, but more importantly, connecting to one another in of itself.\n\nIn writing this collection, I was able to collaborate and open myself up to authors in ways that I couldn't, and would not have, in any other circumstance. Some have come forward to say that it allowed them the opportunity to do so as well. I think this is very beautiful.\n\nWe are living in a very beautiful world. Today, if you do but one thing, open yourself to it. Make a new friendship, or rekindle an old one, or share a smile and a laugh with a stranger. Love one another.\n\nThis note is very contradictory to the actual themes of the collection itself; but we must always take the good with the bad. Perhaps these lonely characters, now collected in one place, can find peace in each other.\n\nPerhaps, you lonely authors, can find peace in each other. ~[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beneath-the-floorboards Shuck & Roxy]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
