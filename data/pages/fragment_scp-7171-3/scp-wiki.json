I did.\n\n**O5-4:** Then what's up with the note at the end?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** What note?\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**O5-4:** Oh, right. Your clearance.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Mhm.\n\n**O5-4:** So, I'm still wondering- How did you end up here?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** I told your guard before.\n\n**O5-4:** Oh, alright.\n\n(//Long silence. O5-4 takes off his jacket.//)\n\n**O5-4:** You know, I feel like I'm wasting my time.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** You are.\n\n**O5-4:** How do you know?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Didn't you just say you are?\n\n**O5-4:** No, I //feel// like I'm wasting my time. But what makes you think I am?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** You're an O5, aren't you?\n\n**O5-4:** Do you think I've got anything to lose at this point?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Oh, yes. Your time.\n\n**O5-4:** (//Laughs.//) You're a funny man, Arkand.\n\n(//Silence. O5-4 smiles.//)\n\n**O5-4:** Now, I still don't have some things clear.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Like what?\n\n**O5-4:** Why didn't you add the Binary Star transmission to the second revision?\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** What transmission?\n\n**O5-4:** Six days ago, Binary Star reached SCP-7171. That's why we're still alive.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Oh. Hmm. Thought I had told you.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Arkand:** Around one or two weeks ago, I left the observatory for the first time in years. I already knew Binary Star was gonna do it, so I thought there was nothing to worry about anymore. Except surviving. And... Searching for people. But that was about it.\n\n(//Dr. Arkand smiles.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** So I got in Lindberg's car; she left the keys on. She most likely wasn't dead, but she definitely was gone. There were more important things to worry about than taking care of a crazy astrophysicist that spent the rest of his years in an observatory. And so... I began driving. One of the first things I noted when I got up is that... Well, long story short, a storm converged a few days prior, but for the first time...\n\n(//Dr. Arkand sobs, smiling.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** The clouds cleared. I knew it wasn't Binary Star because it took a few days for the last probes to reach 7171. It was strange.\n\n(//Long silence.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** You know? One of the most beautiful things of being a member of the Foundation is that even at the end of times or even if you're about to get ripped apart by an eldritch abomination, you have a bit of faith. And that- That's what I had. So, while I was driving through the middle of nowhere, a miracle happened. Would you believe it?\n\n(//Silence. Arkand stops sobbing, then smiles.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** The radio turned on.\n\n(//O5-4 chuckles.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** And I smiled. I looked up at the sky: It was a sunny day. And when I heard the radio... It wasn't screams of help. It wasn't somebody having an emotional breakdown. It was some dude from nearby, playing \"Have You Ever Seen The Rain\" on a very low-frequency radio station, expecting somebody to pick it up and listen to some old-time music, expecting somebody to remember the good old times. Whoever this was, they clearly were enjoying the blue skies.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** //They had faith.//\n\n(//Arkand chuckles as well.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** I knew what was gonna happen, and then I realized... I've been blinded by my own idea of luck, whatever your name is. I realized that sometimes, even in the worst of times, if you believe enough, you may be blessed. If you believe, and if you try enough, you may.\n\n(//Dr. Arkand stares at a photograph of him and his co-workers, all of them smiling.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** And even them.\n\n(//More silence.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** So? While I was dipping my feet in the water to feel one last, good moment, I remembered. I remembered this place still existed.\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** Because of sheer luck. And then, I received a SCiPNet email, that one O5-6 sent. It was... I didn't have anything to lose anymore, but wasn't it worth a shot? I knew I would leave Earth for a very, very long time. But I knew I received that email because of sheer luck. I knew it would require me to drive hundreds of kilometers, but it was okay to me.\n\n**O5-4:** I- I see. Would you...\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** No, I wouldn't like to conclude yet.\n\n(//Dr. Arkand places his right elbow on the table, and points at O5-4.//)\n\n**Dr. Arkand:** You said you were losing your time. You asked me if I thought whether you've got anything to lose anymore. And you've spent the past 3 minutes of your life listening to somebody that has lost almost everything he had. And want me to be honest? Me. You. We've gone through too many things at the same time, these past 5 years, and it was a rough journey. Hell, we shouldn't be here right now. But yes, sir, you've got a ton to lose. It is not my fault that you're willing to lose that much. We can conclude here if you like.\n\n(//Dr. Arkand stands up, pulls a cigarette out of his pocket, and lights it up, before leaving the room.//)\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:object-warning-box-source\n|bg-image=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ec/SCP_Foundation_%28emblem%29.svg\n|bg-opacity=0.2\n|text-top=BY ORDER OF LUNAR SITE-32'S DEPARTMENT OF PARA-ASTRONOMY\n|text-bottom=The following files have been archived.

All survivors of SCP-7171-α are to be tracked, found, and brought into the Foundation's custody to receive necessary treatments.\n\nOtherwise, the containment of SCP-7171 is to be centered around the dissemination of misinformation to the public, no matter the current status of modern society. The SCP Foundation is to be represented as a non-governmental organization dedicated to the protection of humanity, and a plausible excuse or cover story is to be developed and scattered across the remnants of society.\n\n----\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7171 is the former designation given to an essophysical manifestation, formerly located within the Kuiper Belt and currently orbiting nearby Neptune. It originally took the form of a binary asteroid that measured approximately 10 km in diameter.\n\nDue to the poorly understood nature of SCP-7171, the anomaly was believed to be the manifestation of luck or probability, as it had varied effects within the entirety of the Solar System and, presumably, other object masses within its gargantuan range of effect.\n\nSCP-7171-α is the name given to a quasi-catastrophic event that affected the Solar System from 2029 to 2034, caused by the impact of an unidentified object with SCP-7171. As SCP-7171 was believed to be a manifestation of luck itself and its mass was demonstrated to be relatively small within the Kuiper Belt, it was assumed that unlikely or \"unlucky\" events would continuously occur within its range of effect.\n\nThis was shown to be the cause of SCP-7171-α, which later unleashed a series of catastrophic events[[footnote]]See Addendum 7171.1 for more information.[[/footnote]] and almost destroyed the entirety of Earth and its Moon, among other celestial bodies within the Sol System.\n\n----\n\n**FINAL TRANSMISSION:** On the morning of April 15th, 2034, a series of Foundation drones controlled by Foundation AI Binary Star arrived at SCP-7171 via the use of probes. Though most drones were heavily damaged by SCP-7171's effects, the rest were able to establish physical contact with the anomaly and clean the remaining debris off in the following 59 hours. Upon finishing, the drones planted a series of remote explosives in the center of SCP-7171, splitting the asteroid into SCP-7171-A and SCP-7171-B.\n\nAll drones were heavily damaged. This led Binary Star to generate a transmission in morse code, which later resulted in most of its data being sent to Lunar Site-32. This took approximately 3 days to arrive.\n\n----\n\n**AFTERMATH:** SCP-7171's aftermath and the status of humanity are currently unknown. A backup of Binary Star has been activated by Lunar Site-32's staff and is actively inspecting Foundation facilities in hopes of locating any survivors.\n\nSCP-7171 is pending reclassification to Ticonderoga. All files pertaining to the SCP-7171 research project have been archived by order of Lunar Site-32's Department of Para-Astronomy, and this document has been reduced to Level 1 Clearance.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@",
