For this reason, short-term containment efforts should focus on administering Class G amnestics to individuals who have seen SCP-5855 but were unaffected by SCP-5855's non-anomalous antimemetic property.\n\nPermanent containment efforts have been directed towards the finalization of Operation: TV DINNER. Upon completion of Operation: TV DINNER and observation of its effectiveness, special containment procedures are to be revised.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5855 is the collective designation for a variety of anomalous fruit bearing one or more human organs/appendages. SCP-5855 instances are sentient and ambulatory, re-positioning themselves by rolling, hopping, or using their human limbs. SCP-5855 instances manifest in close proximity to individuals (hereafter referred to as SCP-5855-A) who have artistic or creative backgrounds[[footnote]]Similar to the way [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3711 | SCP-3711]]] targets individuals.[[/footnote]] and are affected by one or more of the following:\n\n* Severe sleep deprivation.\n* High fever.\n* Hallucinogenic drugs.\n* Psychosis.\n\nSCP-5855-A instances often deny that their perceptions of SCP-5855 are accurate, instead believing that they had misidentified non-anomalous fruit or were dreaming. This effect has been deemed non-anomalous.\n\nSCP-5855-A instances frequently create art depicting SCP-5855, which de-manifest soon after SCP-5855-A's \"spark of inspiration\".\n\n**Addendum 01 - Artistic Depictions of SCP-5855:**\n[[div class=\"widebox\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Manana.png|\n    caption=An image taken from tumblr user //st4rvingshartist//.

If Operation: TV DINNER fails to prevent all SCP-5855 manifestations, inoculate the public to images of fruit with human organs. This will reduce the likelihood of the veil being broken by SCP-5855 manifestations.\n\n**Course of Action:** A Foundation shell company is to produce and frequently publish new depictions of SCP-5855 to the public. These are to take the form of an episodic television show, allowing new content (and subsequently new depictions of SCP-5855) to be created indefinitely. The main characters of this series (who are to be on-screen as often as possible) will be fruit bearing multiple external human organs. These organs are to be digitally transposed onto their surfaces (skin, peel, rind, etc.) by a team of editors. If necessary for plot coherence, Head Researcher Turner may appear as an in-universe character.\n\nA prototype image demonstrating the realistic artstyle of the finished product has been attached at the end of this document.\n[[/==]]\n[[div style=\"font-family: fira code;\"]]\n= [[size 120%]]**STATUS:** ##green|**APPROVED**##[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"‚ñ∂ Show Prototype Image ‚óÄ\" hide=\"‚ñ∑ Hide Prototype Image ‚óÅ\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black;\"]]\n[[image froot.png width=\"100%\" alt=\"A single video frame showing multiple fruit with human eyes and lips.\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"You Might Also Like...\" hide=\"Feel free to add this collapsible to your own articles!\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[[SCP-6909]]] -- //The Neverending Struggle//, by [[*user Joreth]] & [[*user Luxaiko]]\n[[[SCP-5486]]] -- //Conjunction Immemorial//, by [[*user Grigori Karpin]] & [[*user PlaguePJP]]\n[[[In The End, We All Went Out in a Blaze]]] by [[*user Swaghetti]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-5854]]] | SCP-5855 | [[[SCP-5856]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=AnActualCrow and Henzoid]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** applefeet.png\n> **Name:** Apple Feet\n> **Author:** [[*user Henzoid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** manana.png\n> **Name:** Banana Arms\n> **Author:** [[*user Henzoid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** pearson.png\n> **Name:** Pear Eye\n> **Author:** [[*user Henzoid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Additional Notes:** Image was modified by [[*user AnActualCrow]]\n\n> **Filename:** orangelips.png\n> **Name:** Orange Lips\n> **Author:** [[*user Henzoid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** painapple.png\n> **Name:** Pineapple With an Ear\n> **Author:** [[*user AnActualCrow]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:** [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/f9cb890d-9f2e-4263-a979-09c2d1360075 listen up: ears really are strange looking if you think about it] (CC BY-2.0) by [https://www.flickr.com/photos/73645804@N00 woodleywonderworks] & [https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/0bd5b4ee-5123-4a35-a269-b53342b33d5e pineapple] (CC BY-2.0) by [https://www.flickr.com/photos/64194289@N04 richard_north]\n> **Additional Notes:** Image was modified by [[user AnActualCrow]]\n\n> **Filename:** froot.png\n> **Name:** Line of Fruit\n> **Author:** [[*user Heckhead]]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0 ([https://imgur.com/a/3RujQIC author licensing screenshot])\n> **Source Link:** [https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/522788502904242177/800541073835163698/IMG_20210118_014421.jpg Image sent via Discord]\n> **Additional Notes:** Faces where photographed and edited by [[*user AnActualCrow]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
