Testing of SCP-4228 has been suspended indefinitely. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4228 is an un-aired children’s television series known as “Karma Kameleon’s Adventures on Earth!” The series comprises a single season, 7 episodes in length. \n\nSCP-4228 follows the adventures of “Karma”, a cartoon chameleon. The show's main theme is the preservation of natural resources, with the villains of the show personifying deforestation and animal extinction. Visually, SCP-4228 has a “2.5D” style; characters present as animated paper cut-outs in the foreground, moving across set-pieces like trees and rocks in the mid-ground, over a watercolor painting background.\n\nEach episode of SCP-4228 contains a distinct, highly virulent memetic agent that impairs a person’s capacity to dream. For a complete listing of these effects, see SCP-4228-TL below. \n\nOnce the episode has been viewed, the subject themselves will become a transmission vector, allowing transference through any information related to SCP-4228, up to and including illustrations, quotes, or the names of key characters.\n\nViewing multiple episodes of SCP-4228 not only causes compounding “dream impairments”, but a deterioration of overall creativity and fantastical thinking. As more episodes are viewed, subjects will exhibit a matching increase in desire to watch SCP-4228, or consume any related media. It is unclear if SCP-4228 contains some form of addictive cognitohazard, or merely becomes a substitute for the subject's enfeebled imagination.\n\nSCP-4228 was acquired during a raid on Oliver Brothers Inc., known affiliates of \"Marshall, Carter, & Dark.\" \n\n\n[[=]]\n__**SCP-4228-TL**__:\n[[/=]]\n[[table style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n=====TITLE=====\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n=====SUMMARY=====\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n=====RESULT=====\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-1** \n\n//\"Karma Kameleon and the Rainbow Forest!\"//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n\n//\"Karma Kameleon travels through the Rainbow Forest on the brand new vine-line tram, picking up his friends along the way!\" (sic)//\n  \nAll trees and other foliage in this episode display a disorienting, rapid shift of color.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nDreams no longer contain distinct visuals; elements present as silhouettes or amorphous blobs.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-2** \n\n//“Karma Kameleon visits the Tree People!”//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n\n//\"Karma Kameleon and friends go to Grass-Roof Village, just in time for the fire dance!

This episode contains no music, replaced instead with a secondary effects track containing real-world samples of chainsaws, wood being pulped, and animal shrieks.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects no longer possess a tangible body while dreaming.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-7** \n\n//\"Karma Kameleon goes with the Hollow Men!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n\nThis tape contained no summary. The episode follows a first person perspective of Karma Kameleon in a small cage traveling through real-time live-action scenes. The final shot is a zoom-out, showing Karma alone in a small, glass enclosure at a city zoo. Karma is the only animated figure in a sea of live-action humans passing through the shot, their bodies covered in static. This episode is 2 hours, 16 minutes longer than any other. There is no music throughout; the majority of sound during this episode is Karma's own panicked breathing.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nDreams, 1/3rd of the time, take place in a beige, six sided room with no windows or doors.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n[[=]]\n**ATTENTION USER - SCPNET UPDATE - AI-ROWI**\n[[/=]]\n**Hello again O5-4.**\n\n**When you accessed document \"SCP-4228\" a file was automatically flagged in my system.**\n\n**This file is not listed on the main SCPNET directory.

The \"public\" document you recently read actually details episodes 8-14. Episodes 1-7, however, were one of the Foundation's greatest oversights; a story that begins in late 1993, when a young woman showed up at the doorstep of Site-26 half alive. She had a self-inflicted gash on the side of her neck, and the surrounding remains of a tattoo told us she was a Marshall, Carter and Dark \"Intern\". \n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-1** \n//\"Karma Kameleon and the Flying Flowers!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%;border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects no longer have a sense of smell when dreaming.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> According to her, in 1989 Marshall, Carter and Dark were approached by a group of wide-eyed “anartists”. Like many creatives, they were also devout environmentalists who thought humanity would better prosper under a “bohemian” rule. “We need unearthly weapons to break the shackles of greed and ignorance!\" was the exact quote. Their actual plan was to produce an anomalous cartoon that made children grow into good, eco-friendly adults. So, a contract was drawn up; Marshall, Carter and Dark would receive 100% of all show profits, and the Anartists would get their better world. \n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-2** \n//\"Karma Kameleon visits Story-time Salamander!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects can no longer read or write during their dreams.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> What MC&D actually provided, besides production capital, was what our defector called a “Mnemette\" or \"Muse-Barin\"; a very rare, very ancient form of living idea that could be shaped as it develops. This is why SCP-4228 is so alarmingly infectious; it isn't merely an infohazard, it's a true self-propagating memetic virus. It's infectious because it was raised to be infectious. It makes us want to preserve the environment because its \"parents\" instilled those values in it. The entire show, the entire concept of \"Karma Kameleon\" was grown from a seed of powerful, primal thought. \n> \n> So, why aren’t we all planting trees and singing “Kumbaya” right now? Given we're talking about MC&D, you probably already know the answer.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-3** \n//\"Karma Kameleon and the Swinging Sloths!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects can no longer create heat, cold, or any kinetic sensation during dreams.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> Shortly after “Karma Kameleon” finished production in 1992, all assets were \"seized\". Somewhere in that maze of legal jargon they called a “contract” there was a byline that stated “If MC&D feel their investment has been poorly utilized, they may claim total proprietary rights over the entire production company, and its assets.”\n> \n> To me, this is the true mystery of SCP-4228: How on earth did these people ever trust Marshall, Carter, and Dark? I have it on good authority that Carter alone refuses to light his cigar with anything other than an alt-dimensional duplicate of the American Declaration of Independence! They //are// greed! Were those artists just that blind? Desperate? Arrogant? This, and many other things, we may never know.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-4**\n//\"Karma Kameleon builds a new Tree House!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects can no longer freely manipulate the landscape of their dreams.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> What we do know is Marshall, Carter and Dark re-sold “Karma Kameleon” to a small but ruthless distribution company out of the American mid-west: Oliver Brothers Inc. They kept SCP-4228’s infectivity, its ability to figuratively and literally capture the imagination of its audience, and every other tangible element. What they changed was… unforgivable. \n> \n> If SCP-4228 truly is “alive”, then what Oliver Brothers Inc. did could only be described as **torture**. The dream impairments are merely a side effect of this brutality; a symptom of a deeper trauma SCP-4228 was made to inflict on the mind. Their goal, we believe, was to commodify imagination itself. They wanted “Karma Kameleon”, and likely a subsequent empire of other shows and products, to be the world’s only source of whimsy. Had it not been for luck, and one intern's haunted conscience, we might have faced a true EP-class \"Thought Tyrant\" scenario.  \n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-5** \n//\"Karma Kameleon and the Special Song!\"//\n [[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects are no longer aware when/if they are dreaming.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n  \n> SCP-4228-EN was one of the biggest operations the Foundation ever launched, or so I’ve been told. All evidence of SCP-4228 was expunged from this world. There might still be a few thousand lizard toys in a landfill somewhere, but anyone who finds them won’t recognize the character, despite the fact that by December, 1993, \"Karma Kameleon\" was as recognizable as Mickey Mouse. SCP-4228 just spread too fast. Stopping the broadcast, and dismantling Oliver Brothers, just wasn't enough.\n> \n> Our only option was the Ennui protocol.\n> \n> Now, out of all of it, only this document, and the 14 master tapes, remain.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-6** \n//\"Karma Kameleon and the Distant Storm\"//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects will experience \"nightmares\", dreams that are undesirably frightening/disturbing.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> Take some solace, though. We stopped it. Episodes 8-14 will never see the light of day. We were even able to pull episode 7 off the air, though it was a messy, destructive operation. Our best guess is that 13-20% of the population were infected before we were able to act. To the rest of humanity, this will forever be just an unexplained quirk of nature.\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**SCP-4228-7** \n//\"Karma Kameleon and the first Hollow Man!\"//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:20%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\n**[DATA EXPUNGED]**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"width:40%; border: 1px solid silver\"]]\nSubjects will dream only in black and white.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n> Do you want to know the worst part is? It's realizing that my fellow O5's probably have their own secrets to keep, and it's entirely possible that they're worse, far worse, than SCP-4228.
