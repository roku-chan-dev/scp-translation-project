Yes, even you!\n> Everyone called him six-eighty-two.\n> One day the big doctor had had enough,\n> \"You're mean and you're smelly,\n> I'll show you who's tough!\"\n> First he decided to use a big crystal\n> \"I'll freeze and then shatter him with my pistol!\"\n> The dragon's skin showed a quick aversion,\n> So it stopped at 62% conversion!\n> Then the big doctor thought, \"Hmm.. what to do...\n> I know I'll use good ol' 162!\"\n> But the mean dragon was too clever for him,\n> And he attached the big ball to his left fore-limb!\n> He ran around the big halls and made a terrible mess,\n> Then he went back to his home under much distress.\n> The big doctor groaned and he moaned and he stomped,\n> When he suddenly saw a little agent prompt,\n> \"Sir, I know a way out of this pickle,\n> We'll just show the dragon the monster that tickles!\"\n> So they sent 999 to deal with their foe,\n> But 999 didn't want to go,\n> So they told it the dragon was being too mean,\n> And it went bravely onto the scene.\n> It jumped on the dragon, who let out a roar,\n> But he tickled and tickled and tickled some more,\n> Then, suddenly, the dragon was giggling,\n> But the monster just kept on jiggling and jiggling,\n> Finally the dragon pulled the monster off,\n> But he did not let out a roar or a scoff,\n> He said, \"Thank you, sir, you're a saviour hereafter,\n> Cause you have shown me the great gift of laughter.\"\n\nArea hosting the document was firebombed. All recovered children who had been read the document were recruited into D-class.\n\nAddendum (05-29-2011): Due to frequent requests for an audio form of this report, Research Assistant Corbette and Agent Mao have created a spoken version.
