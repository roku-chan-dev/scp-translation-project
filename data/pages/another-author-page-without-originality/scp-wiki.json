(That's right, I'm gonna start my author page with a //Tiger King// reference that's already tacky and dated when I'm writing it! Whatcha gonna do about it?) Welcome to my author page! Hope you enjoy your stay!\n\nTo pad out the length of this //very// unnecessary section, here's some quick facts about me as well as one not-fact[[footnote]]These are commonly referred to as //lies//.[[/footnote]] I put in there for fun. Guess which is which and you'll win the admiration of a man on the internet who probably lives in a different country than you do. ##white|Surprise! It's the fourth one. I love spicy food.##\n* Cross Country running is one of my favourite things to do; I am //that// guy in the neighbourhood who you see running a 10km for fun every evening.\n* My favourite drink is probably some variant of iced coffee. I think. It could also be soda water.\n* I love basketball, although I won't share which team I support as it's my hometown team and I don't want to spread any sort of valuable personal information about me IRL.\n* I hate spicy food with a burning passion.\n* My least favourite GoI is far and away MC&D and the CI[[footnote]] I know, I know. It's kind of a meme on the wiki to hate on the CI. I'm hardly the first person with this opinion.[[/footnote]] because I find them both kind of boring. My favourite is probably ##purple|Arcadia##, because magic '80s drug dealers is just one of those concepts that never stops being funny to me.\n\nUh, if you look a little farther down the page, you'll find a coded list (which I may or may not have shamelessly stolen from other author pages...) of all the tales I've written over my nearly four year tenure of not doing anything on this site!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"@URL|TheHouseOfBalloons\" order=\"created_at\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"tale\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Tales 'N' Shiz ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||\"]] \n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || \n[[/module]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"@URL|TheHouseOfBalloons\" order=\"created_at\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"goi-format\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Gee-Oh-üëÄ Formats ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||\"]] \n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || \n[[/module]]\n-----\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
