The person you are reading about no longer exists, nor was he ever really a person. You're simply sitting here, staring at a blank terminal whilst you think you're reading an epitaph of some sort.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]Stop reading.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]Researcher Blake does not exist. He never has existed. Please contact your HCML Supervisor immediately.[[/span]]\n------\nthey keep\n\n[[=]]\ngetting\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nin the way\n[[/>]]\n\ni asked them to move\n\n[[=]]\na few times\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\npolitely, of course.\n[[/>]]\n\nbut they kept insisting\n\n[[=]]\nthat they must walk here\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nthat I was the one led askew\n[[/>]]\n\ni don't know how many times\n\n[[=]]\ni insisted\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nthat i was sitting down\n[[/>]]\n-------\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]He was an error. That's all he was, in truth.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]An error that gained sentience but was still fundamentally broken[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]We told Blake that he may help. We told an error that he would be fixed, at some point. We gave him a job, a role, a friend, a few researchers to attach him to the mainframe.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]Blake still does not exist.[[/span]]\n-------\nI wasn't always that bad\n\n[[=]]\nwhatever this is, it's a new development\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nwe --are-- were all confused\n[[/>]]\n\nThey told me that \n\n[[=]]\nI was going to be \"fine\"\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nI was going to be rebooted\n[[/>]]\n\nI've been stuck here\n\n[[=]]\nwalking in circles\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\ni keep telling them things but they can't hear me\n[[/>]]\n---------\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]It was strange how attached we all grew to someone --that no longer exists-- that never existed. Blake was just another researcher, in our eyes.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]We sent in a request to the Ethics Committee that Blake could possibly be an actual person that had gotten... connected to a server somehow.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]We asked to make him a body.[[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]That's why Blake --doesn't exist-- has never existed.[[/span]]\n---------\nI've been\n\n[[=]]\nsat here\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]We waited for so long for his eyes to open.[[/span]]\nwaiting \n[[/>]]\n\nWaiting for what?\n\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]We've been waiting for you, Blake.[[/span]]\nI've been waiting for you.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]Why do you insist on doing this?[[/span]]\nIs it that hard to believe?\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[span class=\"dblock\"]]Why do you insist on not existing?[[/span]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
