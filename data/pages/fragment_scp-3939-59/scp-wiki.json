It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYou download the attachment and upload it to the server. You give it a quick read.\n\nIt's mediocre at best, but it's a lot better than what you have currently.\n\nIt'll need more work, though. You're going to have to do a little more research.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/41 Head to the holding cell.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
