We were at the docks taking the goods out of the boat, when one of the boys started spluttering and turning purple. I figured he probably swallowed his cig, and was about to check on him when his skull folded inward.\n\nHe had barely hit the floor when some fucker dragged himself over the edge of the boat. I pulled my piece and told him to get his ass up and come with me. I don't know what the fuck he did, but the next thing I knew, I was flat on my ass and he was pointing the Colt at me. We looked at each other for a good long minute, then he dropped the gun and bolted. The whole time, muttering something about getting his fucking hat back.\n\nIt was Christoph, the fucking spook you shot. He had that crazy look in his eyes, but I'd recognize that face anywhere. I have no idea how he's alive, but this shit can't be good.\n[[>]]\nScipka\nFeb 10th 1911\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[div style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\"]]\n[[div style=\"color:black; background: #ededed;padding: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 275%]][[span style=\"font-family: 'alpha_echoregular';\"]]{**Hare**[[footnote]]  [RAISA DEFINITION - \"HARE\"] A term used by the Chicago Spirit to refer to anomalous individuals of interest.

We set up an ambush in his hotel room, half a dozen of our boys and the boss himself lying in wait for him. By the time he woke up, he was staring down the barrel of a loaded Thompson. Chappell made an example out of him before dumping his body in the river.\n\nWe watched him die. We watched Chappell's pet fish shred the body to pieces. We watched his effects burn.
