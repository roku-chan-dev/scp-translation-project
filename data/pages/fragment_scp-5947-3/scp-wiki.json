Pulling out an electronic device, PoI-000 places a clamp onto one of the pipes, pausing presumably to take a reading before quickly unclamping from the unit and continuing onward.//\n\n//PoI-000 appears to accidentally hit their head on the unit as they make their way out of the Atrium.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n= **Site-90 1st-Floor South Hallways**\n[[/size]]\n> ++ AUTOMATIC NOTICE\n> SILVERFISH.aic has logged \"Dust 1st-Floor South Hallways\" to the maintenance masterlist as an Omega-level priority.\n\n//PoI-000 continues through the 1st-floor South Hallways; they appear to experience difficulty navigating around the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit.//\n\n//Ignoring the stairwell and administrative offices, PoI-000 continues down the hallway until they reach the wall-mounted map of the Site-90 complex. They spend several minutes examining the map, occasionally looking away to monitor the hallway. Eventually, PoI-000 continues along their way.//\n\n> ++ AUTOMATIC NOTICE\n> SILVERFISH.aic has logged \"Correct map of Site-90\" to the maintenance masterlist as a Theta-level priority.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n= **Site-90 1st-Floor Break Room**\n[[/size]]\n> ++ AUTOMATIC NOTICE\n> SILVERFISH.aic has logged \"Dust 1st-Floor Break Room\" to the maintenance masterlist as an Omega-level priority.\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-5947/goremachine.jpg | caption=Picture of 1st-Floor Break Room, taken by PoI-000.]]\n\n//PoI-000 enters the 1st-Floor Break Room with apparent difficulty, spending several minutes attempting to navigate through a portion of the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit.//\n\n//Once inside the 1st-Floor Break Room, PoI-000 pulls out their electronic device, taking a picture of the 1st-Floor Break Room, which SILVERFISH.aic automatically logs.//\n\n//PoI-000 suddenly startles, turning towards the general direction of Chamber 02. They attempt to climb the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit; however, the grated ceiling hinders their progress, forcing them to remove a section of ceiling with a multi-tool. Climbing through the hole in the ceiling, PoI-000 enters the 2nd-Floor South Hallways.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n= **Site-90 2nd-Floor South Hallways**\n[[/size]]\n> ++ AUTOMATIC NOTICE\n> SILVERFISH.aic has logged \"Dust 2nd-Floor South Hallways\" to the maintenance masterlist as an Omega-level priority.\n\n//Emerging into the 2nd-Floor South Hallways, PoI-000 moves to stand before immediately kneeling to retch.//\n\n//Several minutes pass before PoI-000 collects their bearings, navigating the dense piping of the SILVERFISH auxiliary containment unit towards Chamber 02.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n[[size 200%]]\n= **Chamber 02**\n[[/size]]\n\n//Upon entering Chamber 02, PoI-000 is immediately drawn to SCP-5947. They do not attempt to survey the rest of Chamber 02 at this time.//\n\n//PoI-000 stops approximately .5 meters from SCP-5947, bending down to examine it with their mouth and nose covered. Several minutes pass; during this time, PoI-000 dissects two instances of SCP-5947 and attempts to analyze more through their electronic device. Eventually, PoI-000 stands up and turns to leave, at which point Director Smith impales them through their midsection.//\n\n//Director Smith drags PoI-000 back to SCP-5947, forcing their face onto the containment bowl. PoI-000 is held there for several minutes, until they begin eating SCP-5947 at Director Smith's direction. Eventually, PoI-000 is able to finish SCP-5947 without gagging.//\n\n//As PoI-000 has successfully completed SCP-5947's containment ritual, Director Smith drags them towards the iron stairs leading towards the space above Chamber 02. PoI-000 briefly struggles against Director Smith, before going limp from apparent shock.//\n\n//Director Smith pulls PoI-000 beyond the threshold and deposits them beneath the SILVERFISH primary containment unit. In turn, SILVERFISH comes out of Hibernation Mode. After reviewing the Automated Surveillance Log, SILVERFISH measures PoI-000's neck, before proceeding with integration.//\n\n//Two days later, SILVERFISH's focal cadaver stirs, indicating a successful integration.//\n[[/div]]",
