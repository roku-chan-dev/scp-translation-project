I thought it was real for the longest time, and dude, it scared the shit out of me. I mean I heard stuff about Lilly kicking her lamb into the street, and there were pictures of the scene. So fuckin glad those are fake and fanmade. Ick Day, the episode where Lilly went of being mean and grumpy to her friends around time because she was sick and refused medicine. I'd have nightmares about that when I was little. It's a show for like 5 to 9 year olds!

Basically Lilly is out in the town with her friends and someone near them gets sick and then they're scared that they'll get sick. The spend the whole episode being super careful afraid that they'll get germs and stuff. At the end they all get sick. The episode was controversial because parents were afraid it sent a kinda mean message. It's weird that it's lost. Now I don't remember much either, that's about it.
