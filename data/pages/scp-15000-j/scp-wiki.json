How do you know about that? \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, you have five stains on your coat, but I didn't smell anything in your breath indicating you ate breakfast.\n> \n> **Dr. Penelope:** Now that is some bullshi—\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Tch tch tch, so quick to anger, but now, I know everything about your personality! You're the type to hate your position in society!\n> \n> **Dr. Penelope:** That's a mere generalization. \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** But is it? This morning you... You were forced to get your inconsiderate boss some coffee after you bumped your head on a door. You were probably thinking \"Why do I have to get this moron some coffee, I should be in charge.\"\n> \n> **Dr. Penelope:** That's... That is not true.\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** But it is, this morning while you fixed him coffee you spit in it! \n> \n> **Head Research Campe:** She did what? \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:**  But that wasn't your first time, you did this several times, you even did [DATA EXPUNGED]. \n> \n> **Dr. Penelope:** He's lying, don't believe a word he says!\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Look on your cameras then, Doctor Campe!\n> \n> **Dr. Penelope:** Wha—Wha—Wha—\n> \n>  **Head Research Campe:** //Doctor Penelope//, come in my office right now.\n> \n> **[END LOG]** \n\n\n\n> **Interviewer:** Doctor Fabrizio  Samuel \n> \n> **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J\n> \n>  **Foreword:** Interview #2.\n> \n>  **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Dr. Samuel:** Hello SCP-15000-J, I would like to ask why did you um... expose D— Junior Researcher Penelope. \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** Expose, is that what you call it? I didn't expose anyone, that was just simple mental exercise. \n> \n> **Dr. Samuel:** A exercise for what? \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** //[Looking up]//... Until the time I reach the pinnacle of the one above all. \n> \n> **Dr. Samuel:** Could you please elaborate?  \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Elaborate, why should I? What are you tr... Hehe, I see now. \n> \n> **Dr. Samuel:** You see what?\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** You're not a doctor, you're a spy!\n> \n>  **Dr. Samuel:** //[Stands up]// This is getting ridiculous, can we en—\n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** Why are you leaving so early, Chaos Insurgency?\n> \n>  **Spy:** How do you know about that? \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** It was simple, this organization must have enemies, I watch too much tv not to know that and while you were in here you didn't write down notes immediately, you waited five seconds do it! \n> \n> **Spy:** But how did you come up with a name?\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:**  SCP Foundation has 13 letters and this is my second interview, so 2 plus 13 equals 15 and what has 15 letters, Chaos Insurgency.\n> \n> You see, I trained my mind for five years on a specific mountain in a specific region to increase my mental power. On that mountain, I had learned the art of seeing with your eyes. With this power, I could deduce anything about you by just the way you walk. But of course, not anyone can use this power, only the wisest and greatest of minds could dre—\n> \n> **Spy:** ... No, no that just makes no sense, our names could have been The Red Nudists. You guys see this right? This is some cra—//[Is rendered unconscious by security guards.]//\n> \n> **Head Researcher Campe:** If you keep this up, we might have to give you a job. \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** No need, a person would not lie if the truth did not feel dangerous. \n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n\n\n\n\n> **Interviewer:** Doctor Abbot Daniel. \n> \n> **Interviewee:** SCP-15000-J\n> \n>  **Foreword:** Interview #6.  Doctor Abbot Daniel submitted forty-five complaints against SCP-15000-J stating that is exposing  'secrets' of personnel that it interacts with, subsequently decreasing site morale, and it was not anomalous. They were granted an interview with SCP-15000-J to prove this statement. \n> \n>  **[BEGIN LOG]** \n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:**  Good morning SCP-15000-J, how are you feeling? \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Quite we—\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Slams several photos of SCP-15000-J working in walmart]// Explain this.\n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** Clearly, that is me working in WalMart. \n> \n>  **Dr. Daniel:** Yeah, but you said 10 years ago you went to the 'mountain' to train. But, the time doesn't match up; here you are, 10 years ago, working in WalMart. \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** Your point?\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** You're not anomalous, you're just a toothpick con man! You didn't train with wizards, monks, or hillbillies, you're just good at... doing things; and so, you don't belong here and you need to be amnestized immediately!  \n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** //[Laughing under its breath]//\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Sweating]// What's so funny?\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** You see, //Doctor Abbot Daniel//, I was the one who made those //fake// pictures!\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** That's impossible, these were discovered under high tec—\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Hush child, I deduced that this will happen 10 years ago when I was training on that mountain. I knew my abilities would be so great that there would be haters coming after me. So I made fake pictures that prove to my haters that I was wrong and they were right, but in reality, they would be proving that I was right and they were wrong. \n> \n> To answer your question that was the reason for my laughter. \n> \n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** //[Laughing under his breath]// \n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** Hm, what's so funny?\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** You see SCP-15000-J, I made those photos today!\n> \n> //SCP-15000-J  gasps and stumbles back.//\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** That just can't be, I... I deduced it. \n> \n>  **Dr. Daniel:** You deduced nothing but your own downfall!\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Hehe,  but you see I went into the //mountain dew section//, so a mountain nonetheless.\n> \n> **Dr. Daniel:** ... No! We are all tired of your //deduction//, you just want to fuck with people, and we are through with you.\n> \n>  //Two Junior Researchers embarrassed by SCP-15000-J walks in the room and hold down SCP-15000-J.//\n> \n> **SCP-15000-J:** Get your hands off me! //[Dr. Daniel takes out a needle and injects it within SCP-15000-J.]//\n> \n>  **SCP-15000-J:** I see, hehe. So this is the end of my legacy... For now that i— //[Is rendered unconscious with a punch from Dr. Daniel.]//\n> \n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-15000-J is now put under constant sedation to study its true anomalous ability and increase site morale.\n> \n>\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
