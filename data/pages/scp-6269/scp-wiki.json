Due to thaumaturgical time-dilation and entropy-reducing counter-measures,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Including, but not limited to: alchemical processes, non-Newtonian physics field generators, atemporal calculating systems, and the copious application of WD-40.[[/span]] mechanical devices within this universe experience minimal wear and decay. The components comprising SCP-6269 located in -SubPrime are monitored by [[span class=\"st\"]]Logan.aic[[/span]], which ensures the continued operation of SCP-6269 through the construction of additional system redundancies. This is achieved through the conversion of matter within -SubPrime into additional mechanical components integrated into SCP-6269.\n\nA subset of SCP-6269's mechanical components are located in -Prime: the home-universe of the SCP Foundation-Prime. These include:\n \n* **SCP-6269-CLAW:** The primary physical acquisition component, SCP-6269-CLAW is utilized to seize targeted persons or objects, and is capable of precise maneuvering in diverse environments.\n* **SCP-6269-HOLE:** A self-stable multiversal aperture, SCP-6269-HOLE is an adjustable multi-badgerhole.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Whereas a wormhole links two locations within the same universe, a badgerhole links two locations between distinct universes.[[/span]] In regular operations, SCP-6269-CLAW is inserted into SCP-6269-HOLE to retrieve a targeted acquisition.\n* **SCP-6269-SCREEN:** Denoting a complex series of monitors and controls, SCP-6269-SCREEN includes the physical control systems for SCP-6269-CLAW and -HOLE, as well as providing visual feedback for the -CLAW operator. The integrated Hunter-Catcher system allows for the monitoring of up to 15,000 distinct individuals prior to their acquisition.\n\nSCP-6269 has proven to be exceptionally successful, ethically acquiring nearly 85% of the Foundation's current D-Class Personnel in the 5 years of its operation.

In accordance with the DotMCM:EATM, the employee was afforded anonymity in records during the investigation, and is identified in the following log as “Bluebird.”\n\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«AUDIO TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Bluebird:** So you have a problem with me?\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** Bluebird, we don’t have a problem with you. We have a problem with your social media… habits.\n\n**Bluebird:** I’ve been reaching all my targets this month. So what if I spend my downtime on my phone? The DotMCM:EATM cites enjoying downtime as an important facet of employee mental health.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** I should have been more specific. The Department has a problem with your Twitter account. You’re posting confidential information about SCP-6269 online. It’s not appropriate.\n\n**Bluebird:** Dude I’m literally just hanging out on there. People like hearing about it. They think it’s neat.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** Frankly, the opinion of outsiders isn’t a major concern for the Department. The fact that they even have an opinion //is//.\n\n**Bluebird:** Alright, well, have it your way. But I’ve been keeping track of anyone who supports the Claw, anyone who understands just how ethical it is. Everyone who follows me //loves// the Claw. Take a look at this and tell me what I’m doing is a “Harmful Breach of Confidentiality” as defined in Section 2B of Chapter 12 in the DotMCM:EATM.\n\n//Bluebird slides their phone, unlocked, across the table.//\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** Are you really citing my own manual to me? I know what’s defined as– wait. You only have twenty followers?\n\n**Bluebird:** Yeah, not bad, huh? Got them all in only a month.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** That’s… that’s not even a single crate’s worth of amnestics.\n\n**Bluebird:** Well there’s no need to be rude. Twitter’s a hard place to build a following for a guy like me.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** I apologize, I wasn’t trying to be rude. I’m just shocked. This was reported to me as a massive breach of security. I recognize more than half of these names from //inside// this department!\n\n**Bluebird:** Yeah, some of my friends here like to hear my thoughts on what we do. They say I have a “unique way of seeing the world,” which is pretty cool, I think.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** Well. This certainly changes things. I came in here expecting to have to shut the account down and ethically fire you. I was even considering termination.\n\n**Bluebird:** I’m sure you’re aware that Section 1L of Chapter 12 in the DotMCM:EATM specifically and ethically prevents, except in cases where unethical events have occurred, the restriction of the social media activities of employees.\n\n**Dir. Greeboni:** I’m aware. That’s my point; there’s no breach of ethical guidelines here. There’s hardly any suspect activity to speak of, this is a drop in the ocean! How amenable would you be to something of a compromise?\n\n**Bluebird:** What do you have in mind?\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«END TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[span class=\"st\"]]__AFTERWORD:__[[/span]] During the subsequent discussions between Director Greeboni and Bluebird, it was deemed permissible for the @mcm_worker account to remain active.
