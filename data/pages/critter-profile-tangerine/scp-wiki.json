She’s sweet and spends most of her time chilling in the corner of her terrarium. Sometimes, if she’s in a good mood, she’ll come out to play with her caretaker. Tangerine is a one-of-a-kind companion, so much so that when we first took her in, she managed to cure Jamie’s long-time arachnophobia! \n\nIn addition to being able to cure peoples’ fear of spiders, Tangerine is also super smart! She is great at understanding emotions and human talking. \n\nUpon inspection by an arachnologist, it was found that Tangerine had a congenital disorder that prevents her from being able to bear children. The complications caused by this affliction means she might not have much time left. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nHistory!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nMy son found Tangerine in a ditch out behind his school. In the ditch, she had spun webbing to hide an orange slice she found. Over the next few days, my son would run out to the ditch to watch Tangerine do her thing. She would sneak under the webbing in the ditch and take small bites out of the slice. One day, he brought home Tangerine in a jar.\n\nWhen we first tried to get her in her terrarium, she outmaneuvered us for ten minutes before we could catch her. After she drew on a tabletop with sap on her legs, we’ve been trying to see if she could write. Just one of many instances that exemplifies her intellect.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nTangerine is provided with small insects and water three times a day. During the day, she can be brought out of her terrarium and explore more spacious or natural parts of the enclosure. However, she must be supervised for the duration of her time outside of the terrarium. And, staff, please start closing doors behind you, it makes it so much easier to recuperate Tangerine. Otherwise, when Tangerine is in her terrarium, she's fairly low maintenance.\n\nShe has appeared fond of many creatures in her same insect enclosure, especially Marcie and Jojo, our beloved twin locusts. As a result of Tangerine's health state, we try to give her as much time as possible with her friends. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about Tangerine!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThe wing of the enclosure housing Tangerine is open to all staff workers, and it is encouraged for people with arachnophobia to pass through and pay a visit to her! In most cases, one visit has been enough to temporarily or sometimes permanently cure a person's fear of spiders.\n\nAlthough there is technically no \"therapy\" occurring, Tangerine has been denoted as a therapy critter. Interactions between her and our staff often consist of the person holding Tangerine, letting her crawl along their arm and hand. Sometimes, staff members have talked to Tangerine, since she's a pretty great listener.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nFrom: Jimmy Kilp\nTo: Faeowynn Wilson\nDate: 13/01/2022\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, you asked me to get back to you on how Tangerine is doing.

Had an ontologist take a look at her, found fuck all that would be of concern. There's good news, though. Earlier today, Wattson and I managed to figure out a way for Tangerine to write.
