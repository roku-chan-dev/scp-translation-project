Operatives embedded in British Museum staff have been instructed to minimize contact between SCP-7557 and civilian museum personnel.\n\nAny and all requisitions for items from SCP-7557-1 must be approved by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-44 Site-44's administration].\n\n**Description:** SCP-7557 is a nondescript wooden door located in the British Museum that originally led into a supply cabinet until 04/06/2022. Currently, it leads to a separate, seemingly-infinite non-Euclidean space occupied entirely by museum exhibits, designated SCP-7557-1.\n\nItems displayed within SCP-7557-1 are universally non-anomalous, and may be removed from the space without issue. Exhibits are identified by placards that provide a brief explanation of the item, and its approximate date and location of origin. The language used in the placards differs between observers, often transliterating to that of the observer's first language. \n\nNotably, all items displayed in SCP-7557-1 do not exhibit any signs of decay nor decomposition unless removed from SCP-7557. \n\n**Addendum 7557.01:** \n\nFollowing the conclusion of an initial remote spatial survey of SCP-7557-1, exploration efforts were authorized by Site-44 administration. Expeditionary teams typically comprised of field personnel equipped with rations, sleeping bags, recording equipment, cameras, and an automatic tape dispenser that would serve to mark the path taken by the team into SCP-7557-1. Due to the nature of SCP-7557-1 and the sheer volume of items within it, expeditions typically take place over the course of weeks to months.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ **A/V TRANSCRIPT XPLO-S44-7557-01**\n[[/=]]\n----\n**DATE:** 06/09/2022\n\n**PERSONNEL INVOLVED:** \n* MTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" \n * Agent Fedelmid O'Moran (\"XERXES\")\n * Agent Iovita Garver (\"JUPITER\")\n* Dr. Anne Karstensen (Archaeology Division, Site-44)\n* Dr. Karim Hanania (Archaeology Division, Site-44)\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n**JUPITER:** We're rolling.

Not a chance. Who knows what lost artifacts we could stumble across in this place?

You saw the Amber Room earlier, but the books inside? Much older. We don't even have tabs on them, much less a copy sitting in a deepwell somewhere. They have been wholly lost to the sands of time, and yet, here they are.\n\n**KARSTENSEN:** I'm not too convinced that's the case. We don't have the ability to cross-reference nor verify the authenticity of some of these lost items, so how do we know they're actually copies of the real thing? How do we know these actually existed?\n\n//The group enter a gallery at the end of the hallway. Drs. Hanania and Karstensen can be heard debating heatedly in the background. JUPITER approaches XERXES with the camera, who is looking at a red, white, and green tricolor banner hanging on a nearby wall.//\n\n**XERXES:** Hey. Take a look at this thing. Take a guess at which flag this is without reading the placard.\n\n**JUPITER:** The flag of Hungary?\n\n**XERXES:** Yeah, no. Apparently, this is the flag of the Republic of Britain after the English Revolution of 1788.\n\n**JUPITER:** The what? \n\n//As JUPITER looks around the room, numerous exhibits such as muskets, artillery, and a guillotine are visible.

There's more to this place than what you thought. \n\n**HANANIA:** Sure, but how do we know this isn't something that was erased by some retrocasual anomalous event? Hell, maybe there's something beyond our clearance level that's responsible for such a situation.\n\n//The two continue to debate on the ramifications of the existence of ahistorical exhibits, while XERXES is seen walking into an adjacent gallery, staring at something off-screen. JUPITER follows while waving at the doctors to come along. As she peers out of the doorway, XERXES is revealed to be staring at a fragment of white brick wall, dirtied by blast marks and bullet holes. Painted in black on the wall fragment is the logo of the SCP Foundation. XERXES begins to speak dryly, reading off the accompanying placard.//\n\n**XERXES:** \"Wall section from SCP Foundation Site-120\".\n\n//XERXES looks back at JUPITER with his eyes wide open.//\n\n**XERXES:** \"The last bastion of humanity, 2047 CE\".\n----\n[[=]]\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=haida.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-7557-1 interior. |\n    align=center |\n    width=100%\n]]\n\n**Addendum 7557.02:** Further exploration into SCP-7557-1 has led to the discovery and documentation of approximately 2,318 items of Foundation origin or manufacture.

Not likely. There are too many anachronisms. Too many duplicates with minor differences. Too many contradictory placards. The Foundation can reset history as many times as they like, but there are only so many times you can redo the Bronze Age. All these artifacts, they're real, but they may very well be from other realities.\n\n**XERXES:** That would explain the wall fragment.\n\n**HANANIA:** That only explains how the fragment could end up here, but not why. If what we've seen is anything to go by, that wall fragment is here for the same reason that thing is here.\n\n//Dr. Hanania points towards the bronze automaton in the atrium.//\n\n**HANANIA:** There's no longer a reason to use it for its intended purpose, which poses the question. What happened to the Foundation in the wall's reality of origin?\n\n**KARSTENSEN:** I mean-- if it's here, that means whatever happened, already happened. In a relative sort of sense.

Proposals for armed exploration efforts into these realities are currently under review.\n\nThe ramifications of the appearance of SCP-7557 in baseline reality are under consideration.\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7556]]] | SCP-7557 | [[[SCP-7558]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** court.png\n> **Name:** British Museum - Great Court edit.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:DVD_R_W]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:British_Museum_-_Great_Court_edit.jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** dino.jpg\n> **Name:** dinosaur-skeleton-profile-867576_960_720.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://pixabay.com/users/acaller-1253599/]\n> **License:** Pixabay License\n> **Source:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/dinosaur-skeleton-profile-867576/]\n\n> **Filename:** elephant.png\n> **Name:** paris-112038_960_720.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://pixabay.com/users/12019-12019/]\n> **License:** Pixabay License\n> **Source:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/paris-france-112038/]\n\n> **Filename:** entrance.png\n> **Name:** British Museum Egyptian Section 1983.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Johnckarnes]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:British_Museum_Egyptian_Section_1983.jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** haida.jpg\n> **Name:** 25609153113_4bb5e545c1_o.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagueonthehow/]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/vagueonthehow/25609153113/]\n\n> **Filename:** library.jpg\n> **Name:** A Baroque library, Prague - 7539.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jorgeroyan]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b5/A_Baroque_library%2C_Prague_-_7539.jpg/1200px-A_Baroque_library%2C_Prague_-_7539.jpg?20130924080802]\n\n> **Filename:** statue1.png\n> **Name:** Townley Sculptures.JPG\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:M.chohan]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Townley_Sculptures.JPG]\n\n> **Filename:** statue2.jpg\n> **Name:** The Egyptian Museum in Cairo, Egypt (2744339822).jpg\n> **Author:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Rudolphous]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Egyptian_Museum_in_Cairo,_Egypt_(2744339822).jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** statue3.png\n> **Name:** museum-333201_960_720.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://pixabay.com/users/carabo_spain-30101/]\n> **License:** Pixabay License\n> **Source:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/museum-exhibition-palace-crystal-333201/]\n\n> **Filename:** statue4.png\n> **Name:** 5532851660_1c0a99234e_o.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/pagedooley/]\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source:** [https://flickr.com/photos/12836528@N00/5532851660]\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
