This document lists those items which have prompted some curiosity. It may be used as a resource should knowledge of these items become useful or necessary in the future. \n> – Dr. █████ █████, Head of Research, Site-██\n\nThis is the second volume of the log.

AFSC scientists attempted to re-establish radio contact and regain control of the satellite, but failed. 3 hours later at 23:25 UTC the satellite began sending coded signals back to ground control. These were then deciphered to reveal the message \"Hippity Hoppity this satellite is our property\".

The item mimics the appearance of [[[SCP-4519|the late astronomer Carl Edward Sagan]]].\n**Date of Recovery:** 1996/12/21\n**Location of Recovery:** Fred Hutchinson Research Center, Seattle, Washington\n**Recovery Log:** On the morning after Carl Sagan's death, mortuary technicians noticed Sagan's body had gone missing. Law enforcement dispatched on-site reported that a person or group of persons had stolen and replaced the body, discovering the doll alongside a Freedom From Religion brochure. Foundation agents later released a cover story proposing that the incident was a practical joke.\n\nFor the ensuing two months, Sagan's cadaver could not be located. To mitigate distress within the Sagan family, Foundation agents planned a necessary cover-up funeral. On February 27, 1997, the Amnestics Department orchestrated a secular public memorial service for Carl Sagan's life. Throughout the service, personnel posing as funerary staff dispersed a specialized gaseous Class-E/W \"Solace\" a/mnestic cocktail. As a result, persons attending the service had memories and feelings associated with melancholy and grief replaced with a reinforced mass fondness for the late Sagan.\n**Current Status:** Item is contained within a shrine to Carl Sagan at Site-64.\n\n**Item Description:** A worn dish-cloth with an effective mass of 0 grams, which is unaffected by gravitation.
