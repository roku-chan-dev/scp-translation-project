This is far from my best work, but I credit its survival to giving me the motivation to keep producing and improving.  I don't have anything profound to say about this one, mostly because I had no idea what I was doing at the time.\n\nI'm not sure there's much here to rewrite if I ever want to revisit it, but I keep it around for nostalgic purposes.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[SCP-5898]]]  [[https://youtu.be/4hMiqte0g7k ♬]] -- //[[[SCP-5898|Corn Belt]]]//** (with [[*user Ohnonium]])\n@@    @@//P.S.

Given the constraints of the contest, I am happy with how this turned out. This is still one of my longest pieces, and it's probably the closest I've come to writing a  \"traditional\" story/character arc so far. There are concepts and characters in here that I could come back to and continue to develop in future articles if inspiration hits.\n\nThis article also has one of my favorite endings I've been able to come up with, so there's that.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[SCP-5433]]]  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgNPCKuX9ds ♬]] -- //[[[SCP-5433|Casanova]]]//**\n@@    @@//(SCP-5433 is silent.

I wrote this mostly to push out of my comfort zone. I've done character work before, but this piece relies entirely on it. It was a great exercise for both dialogue and character interaction. I owe its success entirely to the help of [[*user HarryBlank]] and [[*user Pedagon]], who sat me down and explained to me the premise of basic human interaction.\n\nI posted this towards the end of the contest so it got a little buried, but regardless of the upvote count, I'm still satisfied with how this turned out.  \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[SCP-6789]]]  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipf7ifVSeDU ♬]] -- //[[[SCP-6789|Return.

When I was approached by my coauthor [[*user Ralliston]] and asked to help him write a political comedy to rip on Poland for several thousand words, we were both skeptical of whether or not we could make it work. We decided to scrap the idea on the grounds that it would be too ambitious. \n\nI'm glad we got to rip on Poland anyway. \n\nThis hits on a lot of personal notes for me regarding the relationship we as a society have with nature. We took a rather straightforward approach to the concept, having nature slap humanity in the face for its abuse towards it. The Foundation here is almost irrelevant in the big picture; it's merely a stand-in for society as a whole. The idea to have the story be told from the perspective of an alternate Foundation helps to accentuate this, I think. The Foundation in this story can be anyone. We all have it in us to do either good or evil. \n\nAll that aside, this was a blast to write. Credit to [[*user Ralliston]] and [[*user Trotskyeet]] for coming up with the majority of the content here. Will we regret taking the Sirenhead slot? Only time will tell.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[SCP-6898]]]  [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UjQxhOXco_k ♬]] -- //[[[SCP-6898|Blue Hawaii]]]//**\n@@    @@//The existence of an imperceptible, anomalous ecology within Earth’s hydrosphere cannot be ruled out.//\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Commentary\" hide=\" ▼ Close\"]]\n[[module ListPages name=\"scp-6898\"]]\n**(%%created_at%%) (+%%rating%%), Last comment by %%commented_by%%, %%commented_at%%**\n[[/module]]\nMy Art Exchange for [[*user KirQ]]. \n\nThis was meant to serve as the aquatic horror piece I've always wanted to do, but then it turned into something not-quite-horror somewhere in the writing process and I'm okay with that.

I kept walking forward. Walking, not swimming. Even as the sand slipped deeper and deeper, and I felt the slippery skin of fish on my toes and skin, I didn't look back.

He told me all the fish were born inside the belly of a great big whale. Biggest of them all, with the arms of a man. Some called it the One Great, and it held all life in its stretchy maw, its hunger satiated because there was nothing else to stuff itself with. One day the fish became restless, and they thirsted for freedom, for air, and for light. They wanted to eat, hunt, fight and kill and survive. They wanted to evolve. And so they chewed a hole through the belly of the One Great and burst like a sore across the vast blue lakes, anguishing in the hateful sunlight. Then the man threw out his net and pulled in a bright twinkling fish and took a bite from its flank. He smiled with bloody teeth and pulled down his shirt collar to show three tattooed gill lines on his throat. The thing about the sea though, he said, is that it never dies and it always remembers. From the whale’s mouth we came and to the whale’s mouth we shall return. The sea will claim you back. And then he leaped into the black bay water and disappeared from my sight.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[Her Envoy, Waxing]]]** \n@@    @@ \"This was not Earth.
