For all its flaws and drawbacks, the fact that this massive machine of containment and security still manages to operate is downright incredible. Both the atheistic researcher and rare religious breed of Foundationer will agree: managing hundreds of sites and organizing the containment of thousands of anomalies is no less than a downright miracle.\n\nBut ask any employee from the Department of Tactical Theology-- or better yet, the Department of Oversight-- and they will tell you: there is nothing deific about the organizational feat we manage every day. The most theological thing about our Foundation's administrative system is the near-religious devotion to rules, guidelines, and bureaucracy.\n\nThe Foundation operates like a well-oiled machine-- thousands of individual components, departments and divisions, researchers and D-Class; each working away in their own niche of the massive institution, like gears and axles. And if the Overseers were the brains of the machine, and each of the thousands of employees were the gears, then the oil that let it all spin, the grease that synchronized all the parts-- that was //bureaucracy.//[[footnote]]{{The hell does this have to do with anything?}}[[/footnote]]\n\nAnd if bureaucracy was the lubricant that made it all work, then I was a man wielding a can of WD-40.[[footnote]]See Appendix [@@         @@] and **XXXXXXXXXX**.[[/footnote]]\n> = **[[[SCP-3523]]] -- Resident**\n>> The McCalls refused to call the police during the entire incident.\n\n> = **[[[SCP-7794]]] -- Nightlight**\n>> All the glass objects and silverware were found shattered.
