Usage of the anomaly is permitted annually on December 31st by any desiring Foundation personnel, and knowledge of SCP-7824 itself is to be disseminated in correspondence with its manifestations.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7824 is a gravestone located at the edge of a cliff in Crater Lake National Park, Oregon, overlooking the titular lake. Between the dates of January 1st and December 30th, SCP-7824 does not exist; on December 31st, the anomaly will appear. Anyone with knowledge of the object will suddenly be compelled to visit it, and will take any action necessary to do so; those who are physically unable will be teleported to SCP-7824 anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes before the end of December 31st[[footnote]] Relative to their original position's timezone. [[/footnote]].\n\nThe primary anomalous effects of the object are dependent on specific actions taken while within 1 meter of the object. \n\n||~ ACTION ||~ EFFECT ||\n|| Stand in front of SCP-7824. || Individual experiences visions containing the strongest memories from the last 364 days. ||\n|| Stand beside SCP-7824. || Visions cease. Individual reports the water of Crater Lake appearing darker. ||\n|| Stand behind SCP-7824. || Individual experiences complete amnesia regarding the last 364 days, and develops an urge to jump off of the cliff. Others nearby report images appearing in Crater Lake corresponding to the lost memories of the central individual. ||\n|| Walk away from SCP-7824. || Once 2 meters away, the individual reports SCP-7824 as having disappeared from their vision. Over the next 24 hours, the individual will slowly regain their lost memories, engaging with friends and family as much as possible, and continuing life as normal. At 11:59 on December 31st, the individual disappears. At 12:00, the individual disappears from the Foundation Record of Employment, and reappears as a member of above-veil society, possessing no memories of their time with the Foundation. Additionally, these individuals develop an anomalously intense case of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/saphir-centre Filbuson Syndrome][[footnote]] Filbuson Syndrome is a theorized anomalous condition in which an affected person is unable to perceive the anomalous or supernatural, and will mentally rationalize anything anomalous occurring around them as nonexistent or explainable.
