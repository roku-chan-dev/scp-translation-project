FOR AN EXTENSIVE REPORT OF OPERATION THERMOPYLAE, CONTACT THE OVERWATCH RECORDS AND REVISION CENTRE.** \n-----\n\nOn March 5th, 1990, it was determined that Ethics Committee Liaison Arlo Becker Hammond was acting as an informant for the Clear Skies Initiative, sharing with them high-priority meeting points and locations of key Persons Of Interest invaluable to the Foundation's Overwatch Command, Ethics Committee, and RAISA. \n\nHammond had been in contact with Clear Skies for several weeks before Operation Thermopylae after private message logs were uncovered by an MTF Iota-10 operative embedded within the Clear Skies Initiative, revealing that Hammond had been informing the Clear Skies of the locations of valuable personnel. These revealed that Hammond's daughter, Doctor Vanessa Hammond, had been injected with a foreign bacterial infection that was not known to the Foundation database, at that time. It was stated that if Arlo Hammond supplied a continuous stream of information relating to the relevant departments of interest, an antiserum would be procured and provided to his daughter.\n\nOn March 6th, Arlo Hammond fled Protected Area-03 in the Western Territories, Australia, after discovering that his personal terminal logs had been accessed by MTF Iota-10 agent \"Mr. Magenta\". It is believed that he travelled to Siem Reap, Cambodia, where the Clear Skies Initiative has a facility disguised as a rice plantation.\n\nFrom the backlogs of Arlo Hammond's terminal, it was discovered that Ethics Committee Supervisors Evelyn Scheingart and Carson Langly were embedded Clear Skies agents, having operated within the Foundation for 31 and 32 years respectively. It is theorized that these agents are directly responsible for the assassination of the Fifth Overseer in 196[[span class=\"dblock\"]]9[[/span]].\n\nMobile Task Force Beta-1 (\"Cauterizers\")[[footnote]] Highly classified task force specializing in dealing with suspected cases of enemy infiltration within Foundation personnel and possible information leaks to other Groups of Interest.[[/footnote]] was deployed, and supervising officer Commander Henry Parker deployed with nine Beta-1 operatives and Iota-10 agent, \"Mr. Magenta\" to terminate Arlo Becker Hammond. On March 7th, the team deployed and Operation Thermopylae commenced.\n\nSpecial Agent “Nobody” was deployed ahead of the Beta-1 forces to prepare for their arrival and secure a landing zone.\n\n\n-----\n\n+ __EXECUTIVE SUMMARY__\n\n__**Deployment Location:**__ Outskirts of Siem Reap, Cambodia\n__**Deployed Field Officers:**__ CDR Henry Parker //(Beta-1)//, LCDR W[[span class=\"dblock\"]]inston[[/span]] B[[span class=\"dblock\"]]esson[[/span]] \"Kepler\" //(Delta-1)//, COL Charles B.

The group slowly claimed territories and began utilizing front companies to conceal operations. Their primary goal is to eliminate anomalous entities and phenomena from the world, and groups that utilize the anomalous. They have allied themselves with the Global Occult Coalition, and have an uneasy alliance with the Chaos Insurgency. Since 1949, the Clear Skies Initiative have spread from Central Europe to several countries in the Middle East and branched to areas in Eastern Asia.\n\n\nIt has been determined that the Clear Skies Initiative have a personnel count of an estimated 130,000. After Operation Thermopylae, it was discovered that the Clear Skies Initiative have embedded agents rooted in several Foundation departments, and have been removed.\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab PERSONNEL SYNOPSIS]]\n\n@@ @@\n+++ __Personnel deployed for Operation Thermopylae:__\n\n\n> ++++ __Beta-1 (\"Cauterizers\")__\n> __Juno-1-1:__ {{[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/we-concerned-few Commander Henry Parker]}}\n> __Juno-1-2:__ {{Lieutenant Yuri Kozlov}}\n> __Juno-1-3:__ {{Sharpshooter Iris C.
