While in transport, Rowan reportedly spit out a digital camera and notebook, chipping a lateral incisor in the process, but he otherwise was physically uninjured and superficially normal in appearance.\n\nAt the FRDC, Rowan was found to be physically stable and healthy with no anatomical changes, and demonstrated no unusual psychological changes apart from a previously undisclosed fear of dolphins. The only confirmed changes to Rowan were a benign anomalous effect manifesting when photographing him.\n\nRowan voluntarily turned over all records of his expedition to Site-433 Director Jonathan Mildew, but firmly refused to offer his own interpretations on any of the events therein. Additionally, he has gone on record strongly discouraging any future investigation or research into SCP-8060 and associated persons of interest.\n\n||= [[size large]][http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8060/offset/3 VIEW SITE-433 DIRECTOR'S REPORT][[/size]]||\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
