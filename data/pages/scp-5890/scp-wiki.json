Local reality within the building is dimensionally and temporarily unstable to a high degree, frequently fluctuating between numerous alternative states of matter, dimensional locations, and timeframes, with no part of it being properly anchored within baseline reality. Within the building, multiple non-euclidean spaces can be found, with their properties, dimensions, and locations changing on a usual basis. Although no apparent pattern of these irregularities has been noted, they appear to be reliant on the individuals currently present in the building, creating such spaces seemingly out of distorted memories of these individuals.\n@@ @@\nSCP-5890-1 is a designation given to an unknown amount of humanoid entities. The exact nature and appearance of such is not truly known due to the nature of their origin point, SCP-5890, though live reports of witnesses of the 1984-FALL Incident indicate that the humanoids:\n* possess shapeshifting abilities,\n* lack higher intelligence,\n* do not possess an understanding of human grammar or speech patterns,\n* are unable to properly analyze their surroundings.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**{{System Notice -- the following file is incomplete and contains incomplete information.

[[/footnote]] began on 13/06/1984 following the discovery of plans of unknown thaumaturgic actions within the Nuclear Power Plant of Białystok created by PoI-5936 (\"Damien Nowak\"), an alleged leader of a cult practicing thaumaturgy, [[[SCP-5936|The Children]]] within Częstochowa's Local Authorities' Files. \n\nFurther research regarding PoI-5936 conducted by Foundation personnel embedded within Częstochowa's local authorities revealed that numerous papers and documents documenting Nowak's previous actions were created by local authorities. The latest one is attached below[[footnote]] The entirety of the document was translated from Russian, a language not native to the writer of the document. [[/footnote]].\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/5890/attached-documents/1\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt has come to my attention, more and more, the extent to which the abnormal and the ununderstood surround our world. At the rate of discovery my Bureau currently holds of new artifacts and phenomena, in merely two decades time, it seems like without a larger organization to take the anomalous into its custody, we would need to permanently break the Veil of Secrecy holding our association of nations together. Obviously, I, as most likely anyone higher within the ranks of our organization, know about GRU-P -- but I surely am not the only one who thinks that it is just too little for how giant the world of the ununderstood is.\n\nDuring our latest studies, we have discovered one of the probably most worrying discoveries so far - calculations and context clues I am one hundred percent sure are indeed true lead me to believe that religion and all sorts of spiritual activities are not merely actions of fools lying to themselves about the nature of existence. In fact, they are far from it -- we have been able to discover that rituals can literally affect the world at large, with instant fears of the State's enemies using such for our demise being expressed by my higher-ups.\n\nUpon calming all of my co-workers down that no such evidence exists, we have realized that with this utterly terrifying discovery, our biggest opportunity so far arises -- channeled and controlled rituals. Of course, one could argue it's against our code of ethics, but here, I ask -- did that stop us before? Did that stop us in the summer of 1970? Did it stop us during the winters of 1947? The answer should be pretty obvious to those even remotely possessing the knowledge of the State's history. It will not. Thus, I would like to propose a deal of sorts to be arranged.\n\nDamien Nowak, the infamous at this point enemy of the State and an enemy of the people, has been a burden for a long time now to all of us, regardless of our positions and rankings. However, I do believe that the same could be said in reverse. Our searches for him have not been making his life the most peaceful either. With this in mind, we could, theoretically speaking, use Mr. Nowak for our cause -- simply offering mere forgetfulness of his previous deeds, with his side of the deal being teaching us and our Students the art of thaumaturgy and applied rituals. \n\nThis, of course, should not be treated as my official statement on the matter (should, obviously, the project ever come to see the light of day, all engagement is to be immediately forwarded to the anti-Party regions of the Church), and is as naive as it may sound, I would like all of you, kind gentlemen, to consider my words.\n\n[[<]]\n-- //Włodzimierz Jurczak, [[[pickman-blank-proposal|ZM \"Witch Slayer\" Division]]], Director//\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFollowing this discovery being made, and the additional connections between Nowak and multiple other anomalous activities within the region being established, stopping said person's planned actions within LoI-5890 has been deemed the utmost priority for Site-120's personnel. In order to properly contradict PoI-5936's plans, Foundation agents have been embedded within LoI-5890 in order to alert proper staff when the aforementioned event would inevitably take place for Site-120's Thaumaturgic Division to properly intervene.\n\nIn order however to potentially postpone or permanently stop the event from happening, Dr. Asheworth alongside Dr. MacCarthy Jr. were tasked with interviewing one of the members of LoI-5890's administrative structures, who was captured prior to the interview taking place. \n\nWhen the involvement of Nowak was confirmed by said interview, specialistic equipment detecting any thaumaturgic activity within the region was deployed at LoI-5890. Three days later minor thaumaturgic distortions, increasing in size on an hourly basis have been detected within the location.\n\nWithin the next hours, Dr. Asheworth's account was logged attempting to access multiple files potentially regarding Nowak without proper clearance, for which he was adequately reprimanded. Although this incident did not repeat again, he expressed high interest in being a part of any further actions involving PoI-5936. Due to his prior effectiveness in actions involving thaumaturgic backgrounds, such a request was granted.\n-----\n\n++++ **__1984-FALL Incident__**\n\nUpon the realization that Nowak's ritualistic plans were in the process of being implemented, the Foundation deployed Mobile Task Force Omega-10 (\"The Watchmen\")[[footnote]] A Mobile Task Force focused on exploring spatial, temporal, and thaumaturgic anomalies, trained to be invulnerable to most reality-altering effects [[/footnote]] alongside the two project leads of SCP-5890, Dr. Asheworth and Dr. MacCarthy Jr. The following files are recordings retrieved from Dr. Asheworth's camera.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/5890/exploration-logs/local-time/03/08/1984\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Date:** 03/08/1984\n\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Omega-10, Dr. Asheworth, Dr. MacCarthy Jr.\n\n**Subject:** SCP-5890\n\n**Team Lead:** Dr. Asheworth\n\n**Team Members:** Dr. MacCarthy Jr., Om-10-1, Om-10-2, Om-10-3\n\n**Foreword:** Due to Dr. Asheworth exhibiting signs of level 2 spatial and thaumaturgical resistance, he has been elected as the team's captain. The following exploration has been conducted during the start of SCP-5890's anomalous condition -- all of such disruptions were, at that time, minor.\n\n-----\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** And... this should be on.

Being stuck in one room is--\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** No. I'm not happy with the fact it will slow us down either.\n  \n//The team enters the elevator located next to the staircase.//\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:**  I'd say we should go up first.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Agree. I want to see if we can find anyone up there. If there were no cars down here, I'd be inclined to say there is no one, but I'm not sure. If that's the case, then they are up to something. No one leaves a building like this for no reason...\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** ...unless something will happen.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Exactly. That bastard is up to //something//.\n\n//The elevator rides up. When it opens, it reveals an office space, largely occupied by cubicles.//\n\n//The team makes their way forward, each of the members splitting up into different parts of the room.//\n\n**Om-10-2:** This part's empty.

We're free.\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** What the hell was that? W-why couldn't we move?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** A self-contained temporal paradox. We- well, we were stuck in a sub-dimension where time was looped. \n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** Jesus Christ. Can we... somehow avoid that, in the future? I... closed spaces is a bad thing on its own, but looped time?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Theoretically, yes. But it will only get weirder with time here. Our perception will be fucked with.\n\n**Om-10-4:** Understood. The less time we are here, the less chance there is we'll catch the big ones. Let's get this over with as quickly as we can.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Let's go.\n\n//The team makes its way to the elevator. They enter it and block the down button.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** When we get out, don't separate. I know it might sound weird, but trust me, you don't want to be [[[SCP-3001| stuck in a non-dimension]]].\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** I definitely do not.\n\n**Om-10-1:**  Roger.\n\n**Om-10-2:** Understood.\n\n**Om-10-4:** Makes sense.\n\n//After two minutes, the elevator opens, revealing an open office space.

No matter how impossible the odds may seem, he always somehow gets alive and well.\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** We will find a way.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** That's what you always say.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** So, what now?\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** As in?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** As in, what happens to all of the people working at that power plant. They're not gonna just let them back in. It's a cesspool of shapeshifters and a temporal crossroad between mentally shared memory-alike dimensions, it's-- sorry. I... I get official when I'm nervous.\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** I... I-- //coughs// I kn-ow. //coughs//\n\n//Silence//\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** Honestly? They will probably just amnesticize everyone and make a story up about... radioactive waste or something. It always works out.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** But... you can't... just do that! Amnestics will throw off the perception of local people for years, if not decades to come! How many people are alive here? Twenty thousand? Forty? That might spread the information about potential anomalous activity within the region if authorities get involved--\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr.:** I know. But that won't change anything. //sighs// It never does.\n\n//Silence//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** How about the others? Are they at least safe?\n\n**Dr. MacCarthy Jr:** Dash two and three made it out with me. Dash one though... the red light consumed him. We never saw him again. But... at least we are safe.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** That's... all that matters...\n\n**[END LOG]**\n-----\n**Closing statement:** Dr. MacCarthy Jr. disappeared the next day. Although a search for him is currently in the workings, no anomalous activity was noted around him within the past week.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]] \n\nThe search for PoI-5936 is still ongoing.\n-----\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= {{> log-off}}\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= **RECORDING CURRENT SESSION -- 1843 FILES READ...**\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= **LOGGING OFF.
