Dr. Iszth has shown great aptitude for documenting these anomalies, but can often miss a lot of obvious details and relies on the assistance of others to maximise productivity. \n\nOften a perfectionist, Dr. Iszth tends to overthink a lot of their work and will spend weeks pouring over documents in order to make sure they're perfect, much to the chagrin of their peers whom they ask to check their work frequently.\n\nDr. Iszth is friendly and approachable to all staff who work with them, and likes to support those who have struggled in ways similar to themselves. Particularly those struggling with Gender Identity.\n\nEdit: Dr. Iszth has also developed an addiction to energy drinks and will consume at least two a day.\n\n//Note from Dr. Iszth: It's not an addiction, it's n e c e s s a r y.//\n\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n+++ SCP Items Archive\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\nThe following is a comprehensive list of all SCP items currently under Dr. Iszth's authority. Dr. Iszth has been tasked with containment and research of these items and should be contacted immediately  regarding any developments in their conditions.\n\n@@@@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 20pt\"]][[[SCP-5286|SCP-5286: \"Autophagia\"]]][[/span]]\n\n[[<]]\n[[=]]\n> **//\"This gathering reportedly devolved into excessively violent behaviour, culminating in the dismemberment and consumption of multiple highly intoxicated individuals.\"//**\n[[collapsible show=\"Info\" hide=\"Info\"]]\nMy first article, and it might show. A story about a poor man who just wanted to party, but found himself at a gathering organised by a God you do  NOT want a blessing from. I wrote this out of spite, someone said the idea was a cliché and I took that personally. :DD\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[/=]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 20pt\"]][[[SCP-5705|SCP-5705: \"Powered by Thorium!™\"]]][[/span]]\n\n[[<]]\n[[=]]\n> **//\"This convenient item harnesses godlike power for your own benefit! Hell, I would sell my own brother for this beauty, if I had one that is.\"//**\n[[collapsible show=\"Info\" hide=\"Info\"]]\nAn article that was written from a pun!

Told through the eyes of a deity worshipped the world over as a beautiful woman, and when they try to change how they are seen, they are ignored, shamed, and ousted by millions. Don't let it get you down though!

Well, join these rovers exploring a very strange... \"world\" on the edge of our solar system. Nothing is here without purpose.
