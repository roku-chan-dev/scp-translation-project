Members of MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Oil Slickers\") are to operate as first-responders in the event of a major oil spill, destroying all organisms produced via SCP-3057. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3057 is an anomalous phenomenon by which crude oil spontaneously transforms into instances of prehistoric species (SCP-3057-1 and onward).\n\nSCP-3057-1[[footnote]]//Rafatazmia chitrakootensis//, a species of pre-Cambrian algae.[[/footnote]] was first observed in the aftermath of the //Deepwater Horizon// explosion[[footnote]]The //Deepwater Horizon// was a semi-submersible oil-drilling platform located in the Gulf of Mexico.[[/footnote]] in 2010. PoI-8A052 (an ex-employee of the [[[manna-charitable-foundation-hub|Manna Charitable Foundation]]]) deployed SCP-3057 in an attempt to reverse environmental damage caused by the disaster. It was only through extensive Foundation efforts that SCP-3057-1's spread was limited to a radius of 0.25 kilometers from the initial point of contamination. Since 2010, 4 more instances of SCP-3057 have been observed around the world. Whether this is a result of the initial contamination remains unknown.\n\nThe Manna Charitable Foundation has disavowed all knowledge of SCP-3057, and claims PoI-8A052's employment was terminated several weeks before the //Deepwater Horizon// incident. An ongoing investigation is underway to determine whether or not this is true.\n\nIt is suspected, but not confirmed, that [[[SCP-2113]]] is the result of SCP-3057.\n\n**Addendum 3057.1:** Attachments\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/3057/files/incidents.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n[[include component:image-block-quoted name=shrimp3.jpg|caption=SCP-3057-2.]]\n> **Date:** 08/11/2013\n> \n> **Location:** Philippines; Estancia, Iloilo\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-3057-2; //Anomalocaris//, a Cambrian era meter-long ancestral arthropod resembling predatory shrimp.\n> \n> **Notes:** //Power Barge 103// (owned by Napocor, or National Power Company) experienced several leaks as a result of Typhoon Haiyan. This resulted in the emergence of several hundred instances of SCP-3057-2. \n> \n> Over a dozen injuries along the coast have been linked to SCP-3057-2, which attacks its prey using barbs lining 2 appendages located near its mouth. These attacks have been blamed on a new species of invasive jellyfish. Foundation efforts to destroy all instances of SCP-3057-2 are ongoing.\n\n[[include component:image-block-quoted name=dragonfly.jpg|caption=SCP-3057-3.]]\n> **Date:** 09/12/2014\n> \n> **Location:**  Bangladesh; Sundarbans, Khulna Division\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-3057-3; //Meganeura//, a Carboniferous era dragonfly with a maximum wingspan of 0.65 meters.[[footnote]]For reference, //Corvus brachyrhynchos// -- the common American crow -- has a wingspan of approximately 0.85 meters.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Notes:** The //OT Southern Star 7// collided with a cargo vessel, leading to several hundred instances of SCP-3057-3. \n> \n> Every instance of SCP-3057-3 expired shortly after manifesting; recent research suggests this is related to SCP-3057-3 having evolved in an oxygen-rich environment.[[footnote]]The Carboniferous era saw atmospheric oxygen concentrations as high as 35% -- compared to the current era's 20% concentration.[[/footnote]] All SCP-3057-3 instances have been recovered and destroyed.\n\n[[include component:image-block-quoted name=refinery.jpg|caption=Aftermath of SCP-3057-4 emergence.]]\n> **Date:** 03/05/2015\n> \n> **Location:**  United States of America; Pennsylvania, Philadelphia\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-3057-4; //Velociraptor//, a Cretaceous era carnivorous theropod dinosaur approximately 2 meters in length and 0.5 meters high (at the hip).\n> \n> **Notes:** A unit upset in an oil refinery caused several vessels in a tank-farm to catastrophically  rupture. This led to the emergence of several dozen instances of SCP-3057-4. All instances are believed to have fled into the surrounding wetlands.[[footnote]]Before being amnesticized, witnesses provided confirmation that instances of SCP-3057-4 did, in fact, have feathers.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> To date, 11 casualties (9 injuries and 2 fatalities) have been linked to SCP-3057-4. Foundation operatives have provided media outlets with a false cover story describing the escape of several cassowaries from captivity. All efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-4 are to be conducted by MTF Phi-2 (\"Clever Girls\").\n\n[[include component:image-block-quoted name=megalodon.jpg|caption=SCP-3057-5.]]\n> **Date:** 28/01/2017\n> \n> **Location:**  India; Chennai, Ennore Port\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-3057-5; //Megalodon//, a Cenozoic era shark with a maximum length of 18 meters.[[footnote]]For reference, a typical American school-bus is 13.7 meters.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> **Notes:** The //BW Maple// collided with //Dawn Kanchipuram//, another oil-tanker. This lead to the manifestation of 6 instances of SCP-3057-5.\n> \n> 1 instance of SCP-3057-5 is confirmed as destroyed; the remaining 5 instances remain unaccounted for. After the loss of //Beagle 2//'s crew, all further efforts to destroy instances of SCP-3057-5 are now conducted by MTF Theta-5 (\"The Bigger Boat\").\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/3057/files/interview_002.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** PoI-8A051\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Agent Densworth\n> \n> **Foreword:** PoI-8A051 is an ex-employee of the Manna Charitable Foundation, and was involved in the //Deepwater Horizon// incident.\n> -----\n> **<Begin Log.>**\n> \n> **Agent Densworth:** How did you do this? Was it a chemical?\n> \n> **PoI-8A051:** The 'how' isn't as important as the 'why'.\n> \n> **Agent Densworth:** Alright, I'll bite: Why did you decide to turn one ecological disaster into a much bigger one?\n> \n> **PoI-8A051:** Really? You think a prehistoric algae bloom is worse than dumping five million barrels of poison into the ocean?\n> \n> **Agent Densworth:** You can't pull an extinct species out of the Proterozoic era, hurl it into the modern world, then not expect dire consequences.\n> \n> **PoI-8A051:** More dire than the consequences of hurling over a billion metric tons of carbon dioxide into our atmosphere every year?\n> \n> **Agent Densworth:** For fuck's sake. Are you for real?\n> \n> **PoI-8A051:** You're concerned over some obsolete organisms popping into existence and making life a little more complicated. Meanwhile, I'm concerned over how we are obliviously committed to a campaign to de-terraform the entire fucking planet. Are //you// for real?\n> \n> **Agent Densworth:** I'm not here to argue with your bizarro-world Greenpeace bullshit, Al Gore. I'm here to find out how you did this. And you're not leaving this room until you tell me.\n> \n> **PoI-8A051:** In that case, I suspect I will be here for quite a while.\n> \n> **<End Log.>**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3056]]] | SCP-3057 | [[[SCP-3058]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=The Great Hippo]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** seaweed.jpg\n> **Name:** seaweed-algae-infestation-lake\n> **Author:** congerdesign\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/seaweed-algae-infestation-lake-1695521/ Pixabay]\n\n> **Filename:** shrimp3.jpg\n> **Name:** scuba-diver-diver-diving-underwater\n> **Author:** Free-Photos\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/scuba-diver-diver-diving-underwater-569333/ Pixabay]\n\n> **Filename:** dragonfly.jpg\n> **Name:** dragonfly-insect-green-nature\n> **Author:** Skitterphoto\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/dragonfly-insect-green-nature-2227652/ Pixabay]\n\n> **Filename:** refinery.jpg\n> **Name:** boat-from-above-top-view-hai\n> **Author:** SarahRichterArt\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://pixabay.com/photos/boat-from-above-top-view-hai-2435056/ Pixabay]\n\n> **Filename:** megalodon.jpg\n> **Name:** Burned gas tanks from the refinery explosion in Puerto Rico.jpg\n> **Author:** Yuisa Rios/FEMA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Burned_gas_tanks_from_the_refinery_explosion_in_Puerto_Rico.jpg Wikimedia]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
