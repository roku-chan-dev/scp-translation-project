The remains of SCP-6988 have been safely disposed of. Containment is unnecessary.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show archived containment procedures\" hide=\"[-] Hide archived containment procedures\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nSCP-6988 is to be contained in a standard humanoid containment cell at [http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-88 Site-88].

It is 186 centimetres in height and 86 kilograms. Making direct physical contact with SCP-6988 will result in instantaneous brain death for human subjects. This typically happens instantaneously upon contact. In cases where brain death does not occur immediately, subjects show signs of severe anxiety and distress.\n\nSCP-6988 has claimed to have complete omniscience. Currently it is unconfirmed if this statement is true, although it has demonstrated extensive knowledge in many subjects, including certain events and information yet to be disclosed to it. SCP-6988 has also shown a complete immunity to amnestics, with Class A, Class B, and Class C amnestics being applied to the subject without any loss in memory.\n\n**Addendum-1 Discovery:** SCP-6988 was discovered by Dr. Nora Reeds on 05/13/2011 following a phone call originating from ████, Alabama. SCP-6988 and four other individuals were declared missing three days before this event.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Play Audio\" hide=\"■ Stop Audio\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**BEGIN LOG:**\n----\n**Dr. Reeds:** Hello, this is Doctor-\n\n**SCP-6988:** This is Nora, right?\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Daniel?! Are you okay? Where have you been?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I'm fine, I'm at ████████, I was kidnapped. Some other people were taken with me, they didn't make it.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Kidnapped?! Who the hell took you?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I'm not sure, it's all so... overwhelming. I can't focus. I just know that you can //not// touch me.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** ...What are you talking about?\n\n**SCP-6988:** Those people, the ones who took me, when they touched me... they died on the spot.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Oh. I... I see.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'll... send someone to help you. Just stay where you are.\n\n**SCP-6988:** Thank you.\n\n[An extended pause.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Daniel... this is the phone in my office.\n\n[SCP-6988 stays silent.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** How did you get this number?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I'm... not sure.\n\n[[/div]]\nSCP-6988 was retrieved and contained shortly after this.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum-2 Interviews:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Interview Log 6988-1\" hide=\"[-] Interview Log 6988-1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6988\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Reeds\n\n**Foreword:** Interview was conducted 6 hours after the recovery of SCP-6988.\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n----\n[Dr. Reeds clears her throat.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Good evening... SCP-6988.\n\n**SCP-6988:** Good evening, Nora.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Call me Dr. Reeds for now, okay?\n\n**SCP-6988:** Fancy. Alright then.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'd like to ask you a few questions about what exactly happened a few days ago when you went missing.\n\n**SCP-6988:** I see. What would you like to know?\n\n**Dr.Reeds:** Everything you can tell me.\n\n**SCP-6988:** Alright.\n\n[SCP-6988 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** At 7:22 PM a few days ago, three men snuck up behind me and injected me with something. Next thing I know I wake up in some broken-down building in the forest. It's all kind of a blur right now, I'm sorry.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** That's fine... what happened while you were in this building?\n\n**SCP-6988:** The men who took me painted these symbols on me. My forehead, my chest, and my neck. They started chanting in some other language.\n\n[A pause.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** And then I woke up, everyone around me was dead.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I see... do you remember the symbols they placed on you?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I can draw them for you if you'd like.\n\n[Dr. Reeds hands SCP-6988 her pen and a sheet of paper and SCP-6988 begins illustrating.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Tell me how you're feeling right now.\n\n**SCP-6988:** Physically I'm fine. Mentally...\n\n[SCP-6988 pauses.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** I don't think I can describe it. It's hard to focus, I feel like I'm learning and forgetting new things every second. It's so hard to wrap my head around what's happening to me.\n\n[SCP-6988 hands Dr. Reeds the sheet of paper.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Thank you for your cooperation, that will be all for now.\n\n**<END LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=500\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=300px\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6988/markings.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Illustrations of the markings placed on SCP-6988\n]]\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Interview Log 6988-2\" hide=\"[-] Interview Log 6988-2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6988\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Reeds\n\n**Foreword:** Interview conducted roughly 20 hours after Interview 6988-1 with Dr. Webb observing behind one-way glass.\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n----\n**Dr. Reeds:** Good afternoon, Dani-\n\n[Dr. Reeds pauses.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** SCP-6988.\n\n[SCP-6988 remains silent.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Can you describe what you're feeling right now?\n\n**SCP-6988:** The worst migraine of my life.\n\n[SCP-6988 sighs and leans back into his seat.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** I'm starting to understand what happened, what they did to me.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Inform me.\n\n[SCP-6988 pauses for a few seconds before sighing.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** Sorry, it's a bit hard to focus with so many eyes on me. Dr. Webb, I'd appreciate it if you stopped staring at me like that.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** ... How did you know he was there? How did you know his name?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I'm not sure, I just knew. I've been feeling this ever since yesterday. I know things I didn't know a few seconds before. It's fucking terrifying.\n\n[They both go silent.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** I know those men did this to me.\n\n[Dr. Reeds stays silent for a few minutes while writing notes.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I see... so from my understanding, those men performed a kind of... ritual. And this ritual is what made you the way you are now.\n\n**SCP-6988:** I believe you're correct.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** And the effect that takes place when someone makes contact with you-\n\n**SCP-6988:** It only started after the ritual was done.\n\n[SCP-6988 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** May we cut this interview short for now, Nora? It's hard to focus right now.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Alright, we'll continue later.\n\n**<END LOG>**\n\n**Closing statement:** Shortly after this interview, SCP-6988 became completely unresponsive for 6 days. It is currently unknown why this occurred.\n \n[[/div]]\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Interview Log 6988-3\" hide=\"[-] Interview Log 6988-3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6988\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Reeds\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-6988 was interviewed shortly after becoming responsive, SCP-6988 requested Dr. Reeds to conduct the interview and refused to cooperate with Dr. Webb.\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n----\n**Dr. Reeds:** Good morning, SCP-6988.\n\n[SCP-6988 stares blankly.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'll just get to the point then, you've been uncooperative for the past six days. Why is this?\n\n**SCP-6988:** I allowed myself to be alone with my own thoughts. I needed to understand what was happening to me... I get it now.\n\n[SCP-6988 points at Dr. Reeds' notebook and pen, Dr. Reeds tears a page out and gives SCP-6988 the pen and paper.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** To put it simply, I am omniscient.\n\n[SCP-6988 begins to write.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** When those people touched me, they became omniscient just as I did. However, the human mind can not handle the knowledge of a god... it simply shuts down.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** So what exactly makes you able to survive this?\n\n**SCP-6988:** The ritual the men performed has made me the vessel for this knowledge, the one to spread the knowledge to the people of the world. But... it did not go the way they had planned.\n\n[A pause.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** I believe the ones who died after making contact with me are... fortunate. It feels like every second my knowledge grows... I'm starting to learn about things I wasn't meant to learn about. I can see the future, the past, and everything happening this very second. Every word being said, every action being done, It's all happening at once and I'm not able to stop it. It's all so... overwhelming.\n\n[SCP-6988 places the pen down by Dr. Reeds' hand.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** But through all of this I've figured something out. //You// can help me.\n\n[SCP-6988 slides the paper toward Dr. Reeds, Dr. Reeds picks up and reads the paper. A few seconds of silence pass by.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** Do you understand, Nora?\n\n**Dr. Reeds.** I understand.\n\n**SCP-6988:** I want to go back home with you and live our normal lives again, I really do. But... that won't ever happen. This can at least ease the pain. For the both of us...\n\n**<END LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum-3 Neutralization:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Neutralization Log\" hide=\"[-] Neutralization Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**<BEGIN LOG>**\n----\n[Dr. Reeds walks through the entrance of SCP-6988's cell.]\n\n**Dr.Reeds:** Good morning... Daniel.\n\n**SCP-6988:** Good morning, Nora. Are you ready?\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I believe so...\n\n**SCP-6988:** And you remember the plan, yes?\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Yes.\n\n[An extended pause.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** No one is around, we have a five-minute window to complete this.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Before that... Are you absolutely sure about this? Is there no other way?\n\n**SCP-6988:** This is unfortunately unavoidable. Would you like to take a seat?\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'll stand...\n\n[Dr. Reeds wipes tears from her eyes.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'm sorry... it's just a lot to take in.\n\n**SCP-6988:** I understand.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** And what about Mattias? Will he be okay on his own?\n\n**SCP-6988:** You know he's //your// child. The kid's resilient. Even then, he'll be in good hands.\n\n[SCP-6988 briefly stares at Dr. Reeds' watch.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** Four minutes.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I don't know if I'm ready for this.\n\n**SCP-6988:** You don't have to worry.\n\n[SCP-6988 stands up.]\n\n**SCP-6988:** After all, we'll be together afterward.\n\n[Dr. Reeds pulls a handgun out from her coat and points it at SCP-6988's head.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'm so sorry you had to go through this... and I'm sorry that it has to end this way.\n\n**SCP-6988:** This isn't your fault. There's no need for apologies, Nora. I consider this to be an act of mercy... thank you.\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I love you so much, Daniel.\n\n**SCP-6988:** I love you too, Nora.\n\n[Dr. Reeds fires the gun at SCP-6988, killing it instantly.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** Oh my god... Oh god... fuck, fuck!\n\n[Dr. Reeds begins to cry while pointing the gun to her head.]\n\n**Dr. Reeds:** I'm sorry...
