While visually and functionally similar to baseline combustion - producing both heat and light - SCP-6630 can be recognized by the following differences:\n\n# A slight downward curl of the topmost flames.\n# A separation and uniformity of the middle flames into “slats” or paper-like fans.\n# A total lack of combustion in the substance or structure SCP-6630 is feigning to burn.\n \nWhen presenting itself as ordinary fire, SCP-6630 will hover closely over the mock fuel source until it’s intended prey species approaches. This prey will include social and nesting animals, relying on their more nuanced behavior regarding fire, i.e. approaching fire for warmth or extinguishing fire to protect their homes/kin. Once in proximity, SCP-6630 will utilize further allurement, ambush, and aggressive tactics to ensure successful “latching” onto its prey.\n\nSCP-6630 can only, or will only, immolate living creatures.\n\nThis “feeding process” is exceptionally slow relative to ordinary combustion - lasting hours to full days, depending on the prey’s total body mass. The presence of fuel-rich organic sources - such as fats and waxy follicles - does not appear to influence SCP-6630; instead, SCP-6630 will only stop feeding, and latching, once its prey has completely ceased all life functions.\n\nDuring feeding, SCP-6630 will ignite as much of the epidermis as possible to a bright, hot, and entirely soundless intensity. The prey’s own pained vocalizations and movements, coupled with the light and heat, will then draw in other prey seeking to aid or extinguish. While ordinary immolation causes living creatures to experience rapid vasovagal syncope, a.k.a. passing out from pain, SCP-6630 appears capable of maintaining prey consciousness for 30-40% of its feeding process, totaling multiple hours. \n\nOnce its prey has fallen unconscious, however, SCP-6630 will diminish into a low smolder and burn the body in targeted sections. This behavior both maximizes feeding time, and entices future prey to snuff SCP-6630 while it appears less dangerous. These efforts will universally fail.\n\nNo known method exists to extinguish SCP-6630. Unlike ordinary combustion, it does not require oxygen or heat to function - only a living fuel source. As such, water, halon, and all other conventional forms of fire suppression have proven entirely ineffective against SCP-6630.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum | Containment Failure - 09/10/1999:** SCP-6630 instigated a breach event utilizing a previously unseen capacity to reduce its energy output near totally - planting a single ember into the inseam of L2 Maintenance Worker N. Leeds hazard suit, and avoiding thermal imaging detection. \n\nThe subsequent spread of SCP-6630 resulted in the deaths of 198 Foundation personnel.\n\nIt has been officially noted that all survivors of Site-96 were safeguarded by the quick-thinking and coordination of L3 Engineer **Henrietta Boone**, sealing herself and 18 co-workers inside an unoccupied anomaly containment cell until SCP-6630 fully depleted its fuel sources. She has been awarded the Foundation Star.\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n[[image firesuppressiondepartment.png]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url) bottom center no-repeat; text-align: center; width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 20px; padding: 0px;\"]]\n\n**FIRE SUPPRESSION DEPARTMENT - CLASSIFIED**\n##black|The following information is restricted to FSD Internal Affairs.
