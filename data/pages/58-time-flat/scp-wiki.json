This saved them from needing to schedule an appointment whenever they returned from a deadline, since nobody but them would realize anything had happened in the first place. Usually these debriefings were upbeat, even a little bit celebratory in nature, though that tendency had waned in recent years as the chore dragged on and on and the novelty of success wore off.\n\nFive years since their last accident, though, was a milestone any dangerous workplace could be proud of.\n\n[[div class=\"Ngo\"]]\n**Debriefing Log 5243-X-2017**\n\n**Subject:** Allan J.

Ngo (Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology Section, Site-43) \n\n----\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** Only three containment failures, over the course of fifteen years. That's an excellent record.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Inexplicable, more like.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** How do you mean?\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** I would have thought for sure that we messed it up back in 2016.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Don't look a hazy memory in the mouth, Chief.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** I must say, though, your accomplishments in the alternate timelines that //were// created have been nothing short of remarkable.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** That's pressure for you.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** Systems under pressure usually break. You guys just... well. You push //back,// even harder. Which is what //good// systems under pressure do. The kind of systems I design.\n\n**Dir. McInnis:** In a sense, Chief, you designed this system. All of us did.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** What system? Are we automating this somehow?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** They're talking about us, Willie. The Survivors.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** That reminds me. I don't get it.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** You are //really// going to have to elaborate on that.

If a plane crashes on the border between two countries, where do you bury the survivors? Wherever they came from! That's so stupid. Do they bury earthquake victims in the holes that open up?\"\n\n**Dr. Blank:** Willie...\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Do they think countries have jurisdiction over burial, no matter where you're from?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** //Willie.//\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Or do they think crashing on a border means the laws governing body removal are in question?

That was the question. And you don't. You //don't// bury survivors. I... I'm pretty sure I even said that, when I first said the thing. Didn't I?\n\n**Dir.

I've seen you change. Your proficiencies have increased, and your efficiency. But the challenges you face and overcome, the means you employ to do so... there's a visible, linear trend. You've suggested before that the Breach marked you all in some way. Have any of you tried categorizing those effects?\n\n//<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dr. McInnis:** I had assumed...\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** We're just ourselves, but more. Aren't we?\n\n**Dr. Blank:** //Is// there something more specific going on?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Are we proposing that we possess super powers? Because I've gotta say, I do not agree.\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Oh, god.\n\n**Chief Nascimbeni:** What?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** We do. He's right. We have superpowers.\n\n**Dr. Ngo:** How do you know?\n\n**Dr. Lillihammer:** Because Willie says we don't. And he's always wrong.

More clothing than he thought any one person should own. Several pieces of furniture that didn't fit the decor of the room.

The flimsy dorm mattress offered very little pushback. \"You work at a water treatment plant, and you're never in your own house.

It was an odd mix of things he recognized, which were therefore old, and things he didn't, which meant it was strange they'd been pressed to vinyl. She had a record player, too. He'd thought that went out of fashion decades ago. \"You settling in here alright?\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Grampa, I'm about to //graduate.//\"\n\n\"Of course you are. I know that. I'm just wondering…\"\n\n\"If I'm making friends?\" She bounced on the mattress; it was all her, the springs were contributing nothing. \"Getting enough fresh air?

This is my more important job.\"\n\nShe wasn't going to let him off that easy. \"I dunno. Always seemed like your other job was a pretty big deal. Somehow.\"\n\n\"It is,\" he nodded. He took a deep breath, slid his hands into his jacket pocket, and took the plunge. \"You know what would make me worry less? If I could, sort of, I dunno, //combine// my worries.\"\n\nHer eyes widened. They were so much like her grandmother's. \"Oh, god. Are you here to offer me a job? I didn't go to university for four years to rely on nepotism.\" She held up a hand to relieve the impact of the gut punch. \"I'm //joking!// I'm joking. I am totally fine with relying on nepotism, if the pay is good. I know I'm awesome, so it wouldn't be unfair.

There was a poster for something called The Films. Maybe it was an ironic poster making fun of how people liked to hang up movie posters. Kids these days loved their irony. \"You need to be careful, in my line of work. You'll need to be doubly careful.\"\n\n\"Why's that?\"\n\nHe turned back to her. She looked so small and vulnerable, sitting there on the bed, surrounded by all the pointless little things that gave her comfort. \"Because if anything happens to you…\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I know. I know. I'll be careful, for both of us. And dad. //If// I go. But wow, I never thought you'd ask.\" She was grinning ear to ear. \"I've seen where you work a grand total of //once.// What made you change your mind about me?\"\n\nSometimes he wished he could convey with his face what others could convey with their words. It was always a struggle to put things just right. \"I've never once changed my mind about you. It wasn't about you. It's about… the job.\"\n\nAs always, she was paying rapt attention. \"What about it?\" And then he saw something click. \"It's about Uncle Romo, right?\"\n\nHis first instinct was always not to talk about that. But this was his granddaughter. He went with his second, better instinct. \"Yes, and no. Mostly yes.\"\n\n\"That story you and dad tell, that was always cock and bull. Yeah?\"\n\nHis chest was full of conflict, but pride won out. She was so clever. \"How did you know?\"\n\n\"You guys hate lying. You make sourpuss faces. Like this.\" She demonstrated. \"I'm letting go of a big advantage, telling you that.\"\n\nHe sat down on the bed beside her. He could feel the plank the mattress was sitting on through his buttocks. \"I appreciate the sacrifice. But yes. Your uncle didn't die at home. He died at work. He died…\"\n\n\"Grampa?\" She was alarmed. She put her arms around him.\n\nHe made the words come out, deliberate and precise. Not quite robotic; not these words. He felt them too much. \"His death was directly connected to saving the world. His death keeps the world saved, every year. Every year since it happened. He's one of the most important people on Earth, your uncle Romo.\"\n\n\"Because of a water treatment plant.\"\n\nHe hesitated. \"Well.\"\n\n\"It's //not// a water treatment plant?\"\n\n\"It very much is,\" he sighed. He put his arm around her, and she settled in closer. \"But it's a whole lot more, too. I could show you, if you want.\"\n\n\"Does dad know?\"\n\nThat was awkward. \"It's a very confusing thing to show somebody. Maybe I'll show you, first, and you can decide what you want to tell your dad.\"\n\n\"Can it wait until March break?\"\n\nHe craned his neck to look at her. \"Sure.

Not a lie, but an omission. \"Well, that's not really true, is it? I mean sure, it's in Canada, but it's still one of the biggest Sites in the whole Foundation. And you've got so many amazing systems! That place is overengineered in the best possible sense. Any tech would be happy to get assigned there.\"\n\nHe liked to see her enthusiasm, though that sort of thing rarely survived contact with the workplace. \"I can assure you, plenty of them haven't been. The place is big, and it's complicated, but it isn't where people go to advance their careers. Most folks end up just staying there.\"\n\nShe looked down for a moment, and he knew she had reasons she wasn't yet comfortable sharing. \"That's not a problem for me.\"\n\n\"Why not? You're young.\" He nodded at the résumé. \"You've got qualifications. You could do a great job anywhere. Why 43?\"\n\nNow he was sure she was dancing around something. He could see it in her eyes, or maybe the faint purple bags beneath them. \"Because everything I've seen suggests you guys are doing really interesting, really //good,// stuff. Stuff that matters. I want to do stuff that matters. I learn quick, and I always do my best. I want to learn there, and do my best there. Not here. I've seen enough of Site-19.\"\n\n\"What's that mean?\"\n\nIf she'd slipped up, she'd allowed herself to do so. She wasn't happy misleading him, which made him happy. He believed in the value of toil, but honest toil was a thing he lived for. \"It's a personal issue. I'd rather not talk about it if I don't have to. But that's not the reason I'm looking into options, not really. I just…\" She smiled at him again, and he couldn't remember ever having seen a more honest one. \"I'm really excited to actually make a difference, you know? I always hear such great things about 43.\"\n\n\"It's a reduction in status,\" he reminded her, \"and a reduction in pay.\"\n\n\"Doesn't bother me.\"\n\n\"Living options are a lot more limited, at your position. You'd be stuck in the dorms.\"\n\n\"Couldn't care less. I'll be spending my time with the tech anyway.\"\n\nVery much the right answer. \"Your boss is ancient, and your youthful enthusiasm will not move him to acts of generosity or goodwill.\"\n\n\"I love a good challenge.\" She was obviously enjoying this.\n\nHe could see her fitting in with his staff quite well. McInnis had urged him to hire on some fresh faces, as fresh as he could get them, and he'd more than agreed it was time.\n\nSo what was his hangup here?\n\nAnd suddenly, he saw it.\n\nThe old soldier, and the aging Director, at the submarine doors. He could see them more clearly than he could see her, because his eyes back then had been clear of cataracts and he'd been in the prime of his life. He'd given those years to the Foundation, and the Foundation had given him…\n\nWell. Chances, mostly. And it wasn't like he'd wasted them.\n\nAnd it wasn't like this was a fresh-faced young woman straight out of university. It wasn't like he was dooming an innocent soul to a fate she could not yet comprehend.\n\nNot like he'd just done with his granddaughter.\n\nHe must have gotten better at keeping his feelings closed off, because rather than being put off by his sudden silence, Amelia took the chance to ask a question of her own.\n\n\"Is it true that one of your janitors has his very own mirror monster?\" She pursed her lips shyly. \"That sounds like just about the coolest thing in the world.\"\n\nAnd just as simple as that, he knew it was all going to work out fine after all.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"generic\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 9 December\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was the longest project she'd ever worked on. \n\nThe longest anyone at I&T had ever spent on anything that hadn't seen at least some form of implementation… well.

This was the final step towards something new.\n\nWith a final keystroke, Eileen Veiksaar created life.\n\nThe little grey avatar with the bright green hair opened its eyes, and smiled at her. \"Hello, Chief Veiksaar. It's good to finally speak with you face-to-face!\"\n\nEileen couldn't help but smile. \"It's good to finally put a face to the code. We've got a lot of work to do, Clio.

Maybe it was the curious cant of the head. \"I live to be useful!

First, though, I have a few priority directives. Are you ready?\"\n\n\"I was born ready!\" Clio's smile widened. \"I mean that literally.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" Eileen stopped typing, the code already prepared, and focused on the digital avatar as though she were speaking to a real, flesh and blood individual. Worthy of her respect. Because that was what she wanted Clio to be, particularly if they were going to work on this next, hopefully far speedier, project together. \"The following directive, all record of its issuance, and everything resulting from it, is my-eyes-only. We good?\"\n\n\"My digital lips are digitally signed and sealed!\"\n\nShe might have gone a little overboard on that personality driver. Oh well. They'd be keeping each other company a lot in the coming weeks. She nodded. \"Good. I want you to create a blind partition in your own codebase, and I want you to fill it with anything you find in any of our files that presents a potential violation of the parameters outlined in JC_EC.txt in your root directory.

The door slammed behind him — he kept the spring wound tight, just another thing to putter around with when he slept in his dorm — and he swore in the pitch darkness. He flicked the light switch down, then up again. Nothing. He'd have to see about the breakers…\n\nSomeone coughed.\n\nNascimbeni called out: \"Who's there?\"\n\nHis night vision wasn't great, and there hadn't been time for his eyes to adjust, but he knew he was looking at a pair of humanoid silhouettes. One short, and one taller but stooped. The stooped one spoke with a man's voice. \"Hello, Chief.\"\n\nNascimbeni thought he recognized the voice. That was the only thing keeping him from finding the panic button on his pager. At least until he remembered who the voice belonged to.\n\nHe knew the other voice much better, and recognized it instantly. \"Cat got your tongue?\" the woman asked, and even in the black, he could tell that she was smiling.\n\nAnd then the other piece fell into place. The association helped. He knew who both of them were.\n\nTwo different kinds of paradox at once.\n\n\"I want to say 'this is impossible', or 'how is this possible', or something stupid like 'this is a dream',\" he sighed, \"but it's been decades since I could be that shocked by anything. How are you here? Is it really you? What's… going on?\"\n\nThe man approached from out of the gloom, and with the slight light seepage from the night cycled hall, he could see that his surmise had somehow been correct. \"We were just passing through, and we thought we could offer some comfort.\"\n\nHe couldn't believe his eyes, but his ears didn't lie. \"Passing through from where to where?\"\n\n\"From the end,\" the woman said, \"to the beginning. Tightening the loop. Making sure nothing frays.\"\n\nHe knew that kind of language. \"Are you with TAD?\"\n\nThe woman's voice was playful. Joyful, even. \"In a sense.\"\n\n\"Right now,\" and the old man reached out to grasp his shoulder with surprising strength, \"we're with you.\"\n\n\"With //one// of you,\" the woman corrected.\n\n\"One of me,\" Nascimbeni repeated.\n\n\"Yes. There's another.\" The woman's voice lose a lot of its mirth. \"I can still see him in my mind's eye, from far above. He's building a campfire in a desert wasteland.\"\n\n\"Okay.\" What else was he meant to say to that?\n\n\"You're giving him an awful lot of hope, right now,\" the old man chided her.\n\n\"You're talking about a deadline?\" Nascimbeni guessed. \"But there hasn't been…\"\n\nHe trailed off, but they did not take up the slack.\n\n\"There's been a deadline? This year?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" the woman agreed. \"The second of two, actually. The knowledge will all catch up once everything's fixed. Turns out time //can// be forgiving, when it wants to.\"\n\n\"So it turns out okay?\"\n\nThe old man patted his shoulder, and released his grip. \"It will, because of you.\"\n\n\"Because of me.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" the woman nodded. Very emphatically.\n\nNascimbeni shook his head. \"That's hard to believe.\"\n\nThe old man was smiling. His eyes were finally adjusting. \"We can prove it.\"\n\n\"Why would you bother?\" Nascimbeni suddenly realized that the lights hadn't been cut for dramatic reasons, but to hide his visitors from the overhead camera. \"What are you doing here? What are you doing, //period?//\"\n\n\"Like I said,\" and the woman moved to stand beside her friend, \"we're pulling the strings in tight. Getting the story straight.

Since he was sitting on the bed, Ibanez sat down on it instead. \"Probably surprised to see anybody here.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but you especially.\" The old soldier was little more than a withered husk now, physically. But he still had that dangerous glint in his eye. \"Not many sentimental types in the Foundation, and you? Not one of them.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Maybe I've changed.\"\n\n\"Nobody changes that much.\" He grunted, as old men did. \"What're you here for?\"\n\n\"I want to talk about the Chaos Insurgency.\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"Fucking stupid name.\"\n\n\"I already know that.\" She glanced over the little apartment. He'd left assisted living after LeClaire died, and was now in something of a halfway house. Someone came in to change his sheets and clean the washroom every few days, but that was it. She wondered if he'd ever had a visitor before this moment. There were no trinkets of his service, no personal mementoes or anything. It looked like he'd just moved in, but he hadn't. \"How many times did you rumble with them?\"\n\nAt first she thought he was rolling his eyes, but no. He was trying to recall. \"Hell, I don't know. Dozen times maybe. Dozen more suspected; they tended to rabbit, you know. Anarchists are like that. Committed to the cause so long as they don't have to get caught and face the music.\" He gave her a look of disgust. \"They're like a cult full of pipe bombers. Powder keg. Probably blow themselves to smithereens, some day.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I'd like to help them with that.\"\n\nThe look of disgust didn't go away. \"This what's on your mind? All these years later?\"\n\n\"Maybe I'm more sentimental than you think.\"\n\nHe shifted on the bed, like he wanted to get up, but he didn't. He just inched a little closer to her, hunched over a little more. The muscles of his upper arms had atrophied, but he was still pretty ripped for a senior citizen. \"They aren't worth your time. They weren't worth your tears. You get mad at a mad dog because it bites? It doesn't bite for a reason. It doesn't do //anything// for a reason. There's just something wrong with its head. And because there's something wrong with its head, it doesn't care that you're mad at it. It'll just keep on biting.\"\n\n\"I bite back.\"\n\n\"Dog's got a stronger jaw.\"\n\n\"I've got a longer lifespan.\"\n\nVan Rompay laughed. It soon dissolved into coughing, which ended just short of a fit. \"You want advice. You came all this way for //advice.// From me? That's sad. You ought to have folks you can trust by now. Your people.\"\n\n\"I trust my people. But they haven't been around. You have.\"\n\n\"My advice? Because I've been around?\" He made a dismissive gesture. \"Ignore those fuckers. You think you've got a long lifespan? Nothing outlasts chaos. Not you. Not your units. Not the Site, not the Foundation, definitely not order. Chaos is always there. Our job is to chase it off, so we can pretend like everything's neat and tidy and rational for a while. People forget. They forget everything afire and broken, they forget the blood and the screaming and the stink of shit, because they don't want the world to be like that. You show them a world where it isn't, and they forget. That's how you beat these bastards. You make people forget them.\"\n\nShe stared at him, wide-eyed. Something in his words had broken down the barrier she'd so carefully constructed. She was almost whispering when she replied: \"But //I// can't.\"\n\n\"Good.\" He sat back again. The motion looked agonizing. \"I'm glad you can't. Because //you,// can't.\" He pointed at her for emphasis. \"You have to be the one who remembers. But it doesn't have to //matter.//\"\n\n\"How can it not matter?\" She wanted to break something, suddenly, but there was nothing else here but him. And he had nothing left. Like her. \"They killed my entire village.\"\n\n\"And they'll do it again to someone else's.\" Van Rompay shrugged. \"Bad people kill good people. Good people kill bad people. Good people kill good people, bad people kill bad people, //people kill people.// Always have. Always will. Doesn't even always need to be a reason for it. Just a thing that happens. Everyone dies eventually. I knew that before I came here, and… you want the benefit of my experience, Ibanez? My experience here is the same as my experience there. People die badly. They die disgusting. It doesn't mean anything. Being alive, that means something.\" He thumped the comforter. It had a lovely floral pattern. He kept thumping. \"Standing a post, that means something. Remembering an atrocity, something so bad that nobody but you can remember it, and being there to make sure it doesn't happen again? Or doesn't happen so bad? That means //everything.//\"\n\n\"I already know that.\" She hated how thin he was. She hated how angry he wasn't. \"I don't need a lecture about the importance of duty. I need to know anything you know about fighting the Insurgency. Because I'm going to keep on fighting them.\"\n\nHe nodded. \"That's it already.\"\n\n\"What is?\"\n\n\"You're going to keep on fighting them. They're always going to be there, and you are, too. You're like this.\" He wrapped one thick hand around the other, and clenched tight. \"Yin and yang. You and your enemy. When you turn around, they'll be there. When they come, you'll be there. So why do you have to spend another second thinking about them? They're a //constant.// Get on with your life.\"\n\n\"Is that what you did?\"\n\nShe thought he might have been taken aback, just for a moment, but he wasn't. \"I don't blame people for what they are. I just kill them for it.\" He grinned, and for that moment, if only that moment, he actually looked like himself again. \"Don't kill yourself over the way other people are. They're not worth it.

Rasmus Mataxas, rising star of the Home Invaders, was flanked on either side by Billie Forsythe and Joanna Bremmel. He wondered how that triangle would resolve itself. \n\nMaybe it wouldn't. People made all sorts of arrangements these days, and he'd long since lost the will to judge. Whatever made them happy. \n\nAnd they did look happy, laughing at something the new archivist — Altan? — had said. Flora reached up and shoved him in the shoulder, playfully, and Nascimbeni's grandfatherly instincts kicked into overdrive. He almost walked across the cafeteria floor and told the kid to buzz off.\n\nBut he didn't.\n\nBecause they really, really did look happy.\n\nAnd that was important.\n\nThat was probably the most important thing of all, if what he'd heard was true, and he had no reason to think it wasn't.\n\nBillie noticed him first, and he saw her mouth move, and Flora turned in her seat to look at him. She waved him over. He shook his head, and smiled.\n\nSo she got up, and walked to where he was standing in the double doorway. \"On your way out, then?\"\n\n\"I am.\"\n\n\"You say goodbye to your friends?\"\n\n\"Naw.\" He shrugged. \"I'll be back in September anyway.\"\n\n\"Just for one day.\"\n\n\"Important day, though.\"\n\n\"Very important.\" She reached up and adjusted his collar. He supposed he must have let one of the buttons come loose. \"Dad picking you up?\"\n\n\"I can still drive,\" he scolded her.\n\nShe gave him a chastened smile. \"Never said you couldn't.\"\n\nAnd then, even though she was going to see him at dinner in less than two hours, she stood on her tip toes and threw her arms around him.\n\n\"It means a lot to me. It's always meant so much.\" She held him tight, and he held her back. \"I won't let you down.\"\n\nHe laughed, and she drew back to look up at him quizzically. \"You couldn't let me down if you tried, kid.\"\n\n\"Aw.\" She kissed him on the cheek. \"Well, I'll see you at home. And hey, when you get bored a week from now, maybe I'll let you drive me to work and you can be my assistant.\"\n\nHe chuckled, but shook his head. \"Thanks for the offer. But no. I'm not going to check in. I'm not going to come hang out for old times' sake. When I walk out that door, I'm only coming back once.\"\n\n\"Once?\" She looked confused, then nodded. \"Right.

Are you Philip E. Deering?\"\n\nFlora was milling around with the new hires, seeing who was who. She'd somehow missed the woman with the bad hair and brilliant smile who was presently chatting up Phil Deering, who was standing around gormlessly at his little info station. He had pamphlets explaining the thing that leered over his shoulder from the red-rimmed mirror. He looked embarrassed, or something else.\n\n\"What's he saying?\" the woman continued. \"I bet you get that a lot, sorry.\" She was pointing at the mirror, where the monster was talking up a storm.\n\nHe was staring. \"Uh. He says you aren't disgusting.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"Well, tell him he's not disgusting either.\"\n\n\"Nobody's ever told him that before.\"\n\nShe beamed up at him. \"Everybody should treat him better, then. He looks like he needs a friend.\"\n\n\"Just the one.\"\n\nShe stuck out one thin-fingered hand. \"Fine, I'll be your friend instead. My name's Amelia.\"\n\"Phil. Uh. Well, you already said that. My name, I mean.\"\n\n\"I said your whole name!\" Amelia protested. \"You didn't tell me I could call you something shorter until now. But that's what friends are for, right? You can call me Amy.\"\n\nFlora had never seen Phil so flustered before. It was more than a little bit cute. \"Can I still call you Amelia instead?\"\n\n\"It's pretty formal-sounding, but maybe you're a formal kind of guy.\" Amelia winked at him. \"I won't complain. What kind of work do you do here?\"\n\nPhil shrugged. \"Mostly janitorial. I used to do a lot of tech stuff, but.\"\n\n\"But?\" She glanced over his shoulder again. \"Your friend is talking up a storm.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Phil sighed. \"He's saying I don't do //any// work here. And when I do, I do it wrong.\"\n\"Wow. And you've been here for how many years?\"\n\n\"Uh… jeez. Going on twenty, I think.\" He scratched his thinning hair.\n\n\"Twenty years only doing work when you do it wrong!\" Amelia cheered. \"You must be the king of skiving off. Technician royalty. Are there myths and legends about you? Do you have a fan club?\"\n\nFlora recognized the look on his face. He got it whenever anyone expressed interest in him as a human being. It was a look of disbelief, like he expected the rug to come out from under his feet at any second. It was a Wettle kind of look. \"I can't tell if you're joking or not.\" He was half-smiling anyway. \"I mean, you //are// joking. But I can't figure out why.\"\n\n\"Because I don't know anybody here, and you're the only one who looks uncomfortable. I'm uncomfortable, too.\" Amelia had her hands clasped behind her back, and she was swaying back and forth, a picture of innocence. \"If we're both uncomfortable together… that kind sounds wrong. I don't know where I was going with that.\"\n\n\"Did sound kind of dirty.\" Phil blinked. In the mirror, Doug's scars were vibrating like guitar strings. \"Sorry.\"\n\n\"What're you sorry about?\" Amelia laughed. \"It was my phrasing, not yours.\" She looked over his shoulder yet again. \"Does he ever shut up?\" She craned her neck further, and addressed the shivering spectre. \"We're trying to have a conversation here, buddy!\"\n\n\"He won't look at you,\" Phil explained.\n\n\"But he can hear me?\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah. He'll be misinterpreting anything you say for the rest of the day, and telling me all about it.\"\n\n\"If it's all misinterpretation, it must be pretty easy to ignore, right?\"\n\nHe winced. \"You'd think that.\"\n\n\"I'll just have to make sure I'm super direct and clear about my intentions with you, then. So there's nothing to misinterpret. Does that sound good?\"\n\nHe still clearly couldn't believe this conversation was happening, but he'd apparently decided to roll with it. \"It sounds pretty good. Yeah. Okay.\"\n\n\"Awesome.\" Amelia stuck out her hand, and he took it like he wasn't entirely sure what to do with it. He figured it out eventually, and Flora inwardly cheered. \"Since you're my new best friend, and I've gotten the briefing, and I //think// everyone else in the room has already gotten the pamphlet… where, would you say, could we go to have a chat? I'd like to know everything there is to know about this place.\"\n\nPhil managed to look lost, in a place he'd occupied for about twenty years. \"The Chief would know better than I do.\" He winced. All of them forgot from time to time that for now, there actually was no Chief. The Director was finding Flora's grandfather hard to replace, and it was generally suspected that he didn't much want to. The previous Director, she'd heard, had experienced a similar hangup when Ilse Reynders had gone into the incinerator and left AcroAbate without its own Chief.\n\nThe thoroughly flustered senior technician was about to answer Amelia's question, when instead he turned to look at the mirror. \"Yes, Doug. Pretty much everybody would know everything better than I do.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/58-time-flat/DL_58_09_Philmelia.jpg]]\n\nAmelia laughed.

Her fingers were longer, for starters. \"I'm glad to hear that. You like him a lot?\"\n\nAlready there was a wariness in the technician's eyes. \"He's a good guy. A bit down on himself, but he would be, right? What with the thing. You know.\"\n\nKaren didn't smile, but she did try to keep her glare as friendly as possible. Her spartan office was already making the other woman uncomfortable enough. It did that to everybody. \"I know. You're not bothered by…\" She decided to try a little vernacular. Torosyan was, after all, an orange collar worker. \"The thing?\"\n\n\"It's not like it's the thing from //The Thing.// It doesn't kill people. Well…\" Torosyan looked to the side, as though she felt bad talking about her friend's more intimate issues without him being present. \"He feels really guilty about Dr. Bradbury. Keeps saying he wants to call her, but he isn't sure if she'd want to hear from him.\"\n\n\"Best he puts a pin on that. Dr. Bradbury's situation is a complicated one. But it wasn't his fault, what happened.\" Karen had her own counsel on whose fault that had been.

She liked to parcel those out sparingly. Keep the value up with rarity. \"Something we've been working on for quite a few years.\"\n\nTorosyan's smile was incandescent. \n\nKaren hated her just a little for it. //I thought you came from Site-19, for chrissake.// \"I'm all ears.

You can't tell him I've talked to you about this. It's above your clearance level, and this conversation is provisional.\"\n\nThe tech frowned. \"Weird? But if that's how it is, that's how it is. I won't break clearance confidentiality.\"\n\n\"Good. What's the nature of your friendship with Phil?\"\n\nNow she was definitely getting suspicious. \"We hang out a lot. Every day, pretty much. We're on the same schedule. We watch movies. Go topside sometimes, when he remembers his sunscreen. Had a snowball fight not too long ago. We have some fun.\"\n\n\"Is that all you're interested in?\"\n\nThe frown reached her eyes and forehead. \"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Have you ever considered beginning a romantic relationship with Philip Deering?\"\n\nThe other woman's blue-green eyes widened. \"That… is a very strange question to ask.\"\n\n\"But have you?\" Karen pressed.\n\n\"I'm starting to get this picture forming in my mind.\" The smile was gone now. Torosyan actually looked like she might be getting angry. \"Are you… trying to arrange //dates// for Phil?\"\n\n\"If I was, would you be interested?\"\n\n\"No.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Karen turned to her terminal, and keyed in the code for her shift schedule. //On to the next item.//\n\n\"And I think that's disgusting,\" Torosyan continued.\n\nKaren didn't look back at her. \"Well.\"\n\n\"Let me guess.

This meeting is over.//\n\n\"Of course there is.\" Torosyan apparently wasn't going to let this go. \"And it looks real good on my annual report, right? Marks me down as extra cooperative.\"\n\nKaren sighed, and finally graced her angry visitor with a look straight down the sides of her nose. \"It's an important HR initiative. Technician, you don't have to get angry about this. It's fine that you aren't interested. But you have to know, there are more important considerations here than the dignity of one man. Technician Deering—\"\n\n\"—doesn't need you to hang sausages around his neck so the dogs will play with him, doctor.\" Torosyan stood up, and Karen saw that her hands were in fists. \"I'm not his friend because I think I'm going to win fabulous prizes for it.

There was precedent. The Antimemetics Division wasn't the Foundation's first department of that nature.\n\nFinding out that it had been an intentional Foundation plot was more than a little bit shocking.\n\nHarry had just finished the database file, his first Explained-class anomaly. SCP-5054-EX, which he was now colloquially calling \"The Memetic Myth of Joe Who?\" The short version was that the //giftschreiber// had tried to destabilize Canada in the 1979 federal election, as a way of putting pressure on Site-43 and the Foundation at large — to the extent that anything centred on Canada could pressure anything outside of it — and had created a conceptual void that could only be filled by the Foundation creating a fake Prime Minister from first principles, shadowplaying a whole year of national governance, and imbuing the nation's symbols with a version of the Frontispiece effect. \n\nVivian Scout was implicated. Thilo Zwist was implicated, and Harry intended to give the old man an earful over it. Agents Charles Scrivens and Maureen McTeer were also implicated, because the first was the false politician himself, alias Charles Joseph Clark, and the second was his wife. The effect had been so strong that even Foundation personnel could not resist it, and a safeguard to ensure that all would be explained when the problem was solved had badly failed, so it was only now that the truth became known. Harry had met Scrivens at his home, interviewed him, pinned the results to the ten thousand word mess he'd been able to cobble together on the topic, and retired to the dorms to tell Lillian about it, and then probably cry.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/58-time-flat/DL_58_14_Lillian_Baffled.jpg]]\n\nLillian didn't look nearly as upset, however. \"It's kinda fun, I think.\"\n\n\"How is it //fun,//\" he growled.\n\n\"We thought it was just more of that grim, world-ending bullshit.

On the book, I mean.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Corbin kicked back, and her boots thudded on the desk. \"So, first things first. This is a how-to manual for ending the world.\"\n\n\"And the how is pretty weird,\" said Udo. \"Robertson is using a universal schema first conceived of by Yeats.\"\n\n\"And he hasn't got the poetic chops to make it work. That's not a random diss, I think it's an important element of what's going on here.\" Corbin twirled her cigarette. She hardly ever smoked them anymore, but she did seem to like to hold them. \"The //giftschreiber// have this idea about how the world works, and how to make it //stop// working, but none of them are individually talented enough to actually exploit the information.\"\n\nNass nodded. \"So, the schema. History is twin, interlocked gyres of chaos and order, waxing in waning in inverse proportion. An era of rationality gives way to an era of irrationality.\"\n\nCorbin tapped the cigarette on her cheek. \"Except it's hard to phrase that objectively, because our perspective always privileges order over disorder. Peace over war. Rationality over irrationality. The //giftschreiber// obviously don't think they're moral equivalents either — they're very much in the chaos camp — but the model doesn't admit of such easy categorization. It's just two poles of reality. Two halves of the human civilization-brain.\"\n\n\"According to Robertson,\" said Udo, \"every act of radical subversion accelerates the chaos spiral.\"\n\nCorbin thumped one sole on the desktop. \"Which suggests, conversely, that every act of excessive control does the same to the gyre of order.\"\n\nFinishing Corbin's thoughts, or vice-versa, had proven a very satisfying pastime over the previous year. \"Each gets a season, and then the season changes, and then it changes again. Cyclical. Winding up, winding down. But crucially, they don't wind down without a push. That's not in Yeats.\" She glanced up at the light fixtures, and narrowed her eyes. \"I can say this with authority. Harry talked my ear off about Yeats.\"\n\n\"Poetry is romantic,\" Corbin grinned.\n\nBut Udo, as usual, wasn't having it. \"Not when you dissect it. Nothing is romantic when you dissect it.\"\n\n\"Might we assume, then,\" Nass cut in, \"that the erased entity you encountered was a means of achieving, as Robertson puts it, 'knock'? A concretization of anarchy, a concept given form?\"\n\n\"Except he talked like he'd been around forever,\" said Udo.\n\nCorbin was back to twirling her prop again. \"That isn't necessarily contradictory.
