The only way to cure SCP-3020 is by killing yourself, or someone killing you.\n\nI saw Claudia the other day. They let us visit. Hugging doesn't work if you're both infected. We were repulsed. We fought.\n\nShe thought I had been screwing someone else before I got infected. I tried to tell her that I wasn't.\n\nClaudia\n\nClaudia is\n\nthe last thing i heard her say was \"i hate you\". then she tried gouging out my eyes before the guards pulled her off, and i heard her screaming all the way down the hall as people in yellow suits marched me into a decontamination shower and shoved me into a new cell.\n\n\"I hate you.\"\n\nThat makes two of us. I did this to you. I'll infect a dozen more before I die.\n\nAnything that I can use to hurt myself has been taken out of the room. I've been moved to a cell with the bed attached to the wall. My computer screen is a projection, and my keyboard is a touchscreen.\n\nI want to die. You won't let me die. You won't let any of us die.\n\nI thought I could help us, too, when I studied them. I thought I could fix them.\n\nyou can put glue on a shattered glass, but you can't fix it.\n\n[[/span]]\n\n[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-3020/offset/4 Edit made 150 days ago.
