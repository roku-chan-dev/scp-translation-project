  "content": "**Item #:** SCP\n\n**Object Class:** Object Class\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** My special containment procedures is Doctor Elizabeth Grant and my grandmother, maybe? From what I've seen so far, Tony Tony Tony and the Erikeshan bank. Devoid of context, grain of sand floating free. A patch of dirt on my brain.\n\nI am to kill anything.\n\n**Description:** My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham. My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham. My name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham.\n\nIn terms of geography, SCP-3890-2 has the ability to, as far as I can tell, mimic any object. It's simply too difficult to avoid while making my way though all my training, still. So far, I've seen it disguise me as:\n\n* Doctor Elizabeth Graham\n* Doctor Elizabeth Graham\n* Doctor Elizabeth Graham\n* Foundation\n* Doctor Elizabeth Graham\n\nSCP-3890-1 is my collective designation for the autopsy of one specimen of SCP-3890-2. SCP-3890-2 uses significant chunks of my childhood and early adulthood as a form of attack. It's not much of a surprise.\n\nMy name is Doctor Elizabeth Graham.\n\nI don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Or maybe I do, and I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. The mimic doesn't want to kill us, just empty out our SCP-3890. I will retreat from the area immediately. \n\nCurrently, I am the corpses of a family. Currently, I am Doctor Elizabeth Graham. \n\nThe crying was Doctor Elizabeth Grant. Not Tony. Everything around it is gone, but it's sort of floating free, devoid of context. That was the worst thing in the world.\n\nI know what the fuck I'm talking about. I have noted the presence of an infinite desert. There's no way out of here, [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3890/offset/5 |darling]]].",
