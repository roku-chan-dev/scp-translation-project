In the absence of the Administrator, custody of SCP-7545 is retained by the O5 Council.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7545 is Sanctum Eleven, an underground bunker complex located in [[span class=\"label\"]][REDACTED][[/span]] and owned by O5-11 from 1919 up until his death in 1998. As Sanctums are built as extended safe work and living spaces for Overseers and their staff members, SCP-7545 contains extensive accommodations for long-term occupation by up to forty personnel. \n\nSCP-7545-A is the collective designation for four biological machines, genetically identical and visually similar to the late O5-11, currently inhabiting SCP-7545. \n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 7545.1\n+++ {{DISCOVERY}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\" style=\"font-family: monospace;\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: center; width: 70%; margin: auto;\"]]\nTRANSCRIPT OF A RECORDING OF A TELEPHONE\nCONVERSATION BETWEEN O5-1 AND O5-11 ON APRIL 30, 1998 FROM 7:46 TO 7:53 P.M.\n[[/div]]\n----\n**O5-1:** Hello?

Upon arrival in [[span class=\"label\"]][REDACTED][[/span]], Fireteams TRIPTYCH, RAZOR, and SHRINE overrode the security protocols and automatic defenses, gaining entrance into SCP-7545. \n\nDespite containing enough living space for dozens of staff members and guards, the vast majority of SCP-7545 was abandoned and littered with objects of disparate make and function. Alpha-1 operators quickly moved through and secured the facility, finding O5-11 within his private living space and study on the third and final sublevel. He was pronounced dead on arrival by Alpha-1 medics, who requested and received authorization from Overwatch Command to secure O5-11's body and transport it to the nearest Foundation facility. In the process of removing the body from SCP-7545, they encountered four SCP-7545-A instances within O5-11's apartment and instead moved to secure the anomalies.\n\nUpon confirmation that SCP-7545-A instances were non-hostile, O5-1 arrived three hours later to evaluate the situation. He ordered that he be the one to interview the SCP-7545-A instances, along with assisting in the cataloging of the contents of the Sanctum.\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 7545.2\n+++ {{ASSORTED LOGS}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n**FILE 7545.B83:** Statement from Odongo Tejani, chairman of the Ethics Committee, when informed of the death of O5-11.\n> What a horrid man.

I'm sorry, for what little it's worth. //[Pause]// I told him not to pursue it, but...\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** He never had much care for ethical concerns. That's why you stopped talking to him, is it not?\n\n**O5-1:** That's not true. //[Pause]// But if you're saying it, it means he thought it was. //[Sigh]// Damn it all to hell.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**O5-1:** I have to say, this is... unsettling. You look just like him. It's as though I'm talking to him but... not.\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** I am the only one that does. I was his last.\n\n**O5-1:** Are the others also like you? Homunculi?\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** Correct. But they are failures. More so than I. They were not completed correctly -- providing a snapshot into a moment of his life, rather than the whole picture. A vessel that he tried to pour more memories into than would fit. \n\n**O5-1:** But you contain all of his memories, correct? Until this moment of his death?\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** I was the last thing he ever created. Yes. \n\n**O5-1:** Then why were you a failure to him?\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** I do not know. He was looking for something more than the sum of his experiences, I think. And I simply did not have it.\n\n**O5-1:** I see. I will have to talk to the others, then.\n\n**SCP-7545-A1:** Of course.\n\n**O5-1:** But as for you... what happened to him? In the past few years he retreated entirely from us.

It is the opinion of the committee that the judgments made by O5-11 were motivated by a desire to weaponize anomalies for Foundation use, rather than in the greater interests of the Foundation.\n> \n> While this in and of itself is a significant ethical violation, it is noteworthy to point out that the Foundation has done so prior to the 1920 Restructuring. O5-11's violation was doing this through institutional support and protection of a baseless project rather than through official channels and with the consent of the rest of the Council. His decisions resulted in the deaths of several dozen Foundation staff and the creation of a dangerous anomaly extremely hostile to the Foundation.\n> \n> While this committee does not have the power to permanently remove members of the Council, it is our urgent recommendation that the Administrator reconsider O5-11's station in light of recent events.

He is younger but still clearly reminiscent of O5-11, appearing to be in his early 50s. Alpha-1 guards block the exits.

A few discussions on the Occult Coalition talks in Rome, but I don't expect it to become anything significant -- that many cooks in the kitchen, I suspect it'll be yet another organization paralyzed by politics. \n\n**O5-1:** I don't know, it could end up being a major player.\n\n**SCP-7545-A2:** You're the one there, so I'll defer to you.

Those eyes carry the weight of centuries. He puts up a good front, for certain, but I've been on the Council for seventy years, and met him regularly. The mask is imperfect -- he misses mannerisms that other people don't even think about. His //mind// works differently.

Like he has to hold himself back.\n\n**SCP-7545-A2:** A nuclear explosion, kept contained in a bell jar. But I digress. He clearly has his own interests at play, but they seem to align with humanity's for the most part. So I'm fine to defer to his judgement.

We could've intervened and ended the wars that wracked the world for the century, the ones both of us fought and lost friends and family in!

I know the risks, that's why I'm not advocating for dropping the Veil. These are just my little rebellions. \n\n**O5-1:** Just careful they don't turn into anything more.

Your vision is still utterly limited by the prejudices and biases of the old world. The Foundation has the unique ability to exist without having to conform to society's idiosyncratic bigotries.

You came into the Foundation from the Sixth Occult War. That informed your perspective. His was a century prior, where disease slaughtered more than the war did, where entire armies were massacred. You were both soldiers, but you came from trench warfare and machine guns, and he came from cavalry and muskets. \n\n**O5-1:**  I still don't see the difference.\n\n**SCP-7545-A3:** Because it was never //about// using anomalies, boy!

I hope you've been well. Despite recent events, know that I have no hard feelings toward you; I'm not sure I'm capable of grudges anymore. But that's neither here nor there. You made a mistake. An egregious, ugly, incomprehensibly large mistake, perhaps, but a mistake nonetheless. You did not seek to undermine the organization, only bring it back to a time when you thought it was stronger, more effective in its mission.\n> \n> You were wrong, needless to say. That is the only reason your removal from the Council is temporary -- I sincerely believe you have failed to understand how the Foundation has evolved. So allow me to illustrate it for you: the Foundation has cycles. Ebbs and flows. Periods where the use of anomalies is encouraged, and periods where it is discouraged. When I began the organization two centuries ago, we were a loose confederation of alchemists, mages, and scholars, trying to understand and use the anomalous to protect humanity. That is the Foundation you came into. \n> \n> After the Restructuring and the Great War, things changed. There was a strong sentiment that the Foundation should not get involved in these mundane wars, even if they trickled into the Occult World. This is the Foundation we are now in.

He is young-looking, perhaps in his late 20s or early 30s. His hair has not yet gone gray, and his beard is replaced by a trimmed goatee.]//\n\n**O5-1:** Hello.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Oh! Hello there.\n\n**O5-1:** I don't suppose we've met?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** No, I don't believe so. \n\n//[He sticks his hand out.]//\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Lieutenant Benjamin Kondraki. Though I suppose I'm not a lieutenant anymore, working for the Foundation. And you are?\n\n**O5-1:** My name is Django Bridge. O5-1.\n\n//[SCP-7545-A4 furrows his eyebrows.]//\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I'm sorry?\n\n**O5-1:** Ah. Right. Overseer Alpha.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Oh! Apologies, I was always told Overseer Alpha was... older. \n\n**O5-1:** I age well. Let's talk about you. What's your position in the Foundation?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** At the moment, I direct the recruitment of able-bodied men into our guardsmen and clever men into our Agents Corps.\n\n**O5-1:** I see. An important job. Do you enjoy it?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I enjoy it enough. It's skilled work, and I'm certainly suited for it. \n\n**O5-1:** I see.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I'm sorry, sir, have I said something wrong? You have a strange look on your face.\n\n**O5-1:** Oh? I apologize. I'm a bit distracted, I'm... meeting an old friend soon.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Ah. Old friends are the best kind. I hope it goes well.\n\n**O5-1:** Much appreciated. What if I informed you you were being considered for a leadership position in the Foundation?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I... would be quite confused, sir. I don't have any magical or paranatural abilities. I'm not an alchemist or a mage or even a reader.\n\n**O5-1:** Yes, well, that's not going to be important soon. We need more of the kind of people we're protecting in our ranks.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I see. What kind of position?\n\n**O5-1:** An Overseer's seat has opened up recently. You are one of the candidates.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Good lord. That's-- I couldn't possibly handle that, Mr. Bridge, sir.\n\n**O5-1:** I'm not so sure. You've got a good head on your shoulders. You're smart, quick-witted, caring. Sometimes to a fault. Loyal as all hell.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Well, I appreciate that, sir. But I don't know the first thing about what such a job would require.\n\n**O5-1:** Why don't you tell me about what you were doing before the Foundation?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Fighting, sir. In the Union Army. Like most of our men.\n\n**O5-1:** You must've seen awful things.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Many, sir. My family's farm in Virginia was razed by shelling. \n\n**O5-1:** Your family?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Killed, sir.\n\n**O5-1:** My condolences. But you understand that doesn't excuse anything you do in their name.\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I'm... sorry, sir? I don't understand.\n\n**O5-1:** Nevermind. Were you to become an Overseer, what would be your desire for the organization's future? Feel free to take your time to think about it.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** That's an easy one, sir.\n\n**O5-1:** Oh?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** My parents raised me to believe absolute power corrupts absolutely. That having ultimate power over the fates of others leads to a rot of the soul.\n\n**O5-1:** And?\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** They're gone now because no one had the power to do what had to be done. I would like to push the Foundation in the direction of a world where the Foundation is no longer needed. To improve the world, not be beholden to it. To save the people we have an obligation to.\n\n**O5-1:** I see. Interesting.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** I hope that was adequate, sir.\n\n**O5-1:** More than you know, Lieutenant Kondraki. We'll be in contact.\n\n**SCP-7545-A4:** Of course, sir. Good luck with your friend.\n\n**O5-1:** Thank you.\n----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**FILE 7545.Y17:** O5-1 delivering O5-11's eulogy, March 5th, 1998\n> It's nice to see all of you, gathered here. Many faces I haven't seen in as many years. To be honest, Ben and I didn't expect crowds at either of our funerals. We've both outlived practically everyone else we knew. There are no brothers and sisters or sons and daughters left to mourn us. In Ben's case, there was another reason he didn't expect tears at his death.\n> \n> I could very easily stand here and lie to all of you. You wouldn't know the difference. I could sit here and tell you that he was an unequivocally //good// man who tried to do the right thing, even if he made mistakes along the way. I was his best friend. I have an obligation to make the last memories people have of him good ones. Don't I?\n> \n> But I'm not a liar. He wasn't lucky enough to be a good man. Or a bad man. Instead, he was like most dead people: infinitely complicated. A Foundation man to the bone. I saw him step away from his beloved granddaughter's birthday party to order the termination of an entire department. We pushed for the Foundation to drop old-world biases against women and minorities while he consolidated power in his own office. He encouraged the Administrator to intervene in the Great War to save lives, but was more than happy to sacrifice entire units to deny GRU-P or PENTAGRAM control of anomalies during the Cold War. Infinitely complicated, no matter how much we'd like to pretend they're not.\n> \n> Many people here will only remember him at the end of his life -- a paranoid authoritarian, trying fruitlessly to bring back the good old days he so desperately craved. Supporting [[[scp-5549|ethical atrocities]]] and causing [[[rounderhouse-gold-proposal|the loss of one of our greatest assets]]]. I don't blame anyone for judging him as they did based on the things he had done. But in the same lifetime and often in the same day, he was an ardent pusher for change in the Foundation, to support our people from all walks of life, to make us a force for good in a cruel, uncaring world. Like all of us, Ben was the sum of his experiences. Born in a different century's war, and spending his entire life trying to apply what he learned to peacetime. Some people will say he was a monster. But just as many will say he was a hero.\n> \n> The only thing I can say for sure is that my friend is dead.\n\n**FILE 7545.A11:** Excerpt from autopsy report on O5-11's body.\n> CIRCULATORY SYSTEM: At the time of death, blood samples indicated the presence of apoaequorin, cholinesterase inhibitors, and █████████ in the system, substances which are rarely encountered together outside of their role as active ingredients in Foundation mnestic drugs. The levels encountered were significantly higher than what would constitute a lethal dose.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n//[O5-1 sits in O5-11's study in the living quarters of SCP-7545. The room lacks any kind of digital or electronic equipment, and is richly decorated with mahogany paneling, oil portraits, and expensive ephemera. With a nod, O5-1 dismisses the remaining Alpha-1 security personnel. He is left alone in O5-11's study, surrounded by portraits and photographs of the late Overseer, his own face alongside O5-11's in many of them. He does not appear aware he is being recorded.]//\n\n//[A few minutes pass as he walks around the study, examining the framed documents on the walls.]//\n\n//[He then walks over to the well-worn leather chair behind the mahogany desk, and takes a seat in it.]//\n\n//[He leans his elbows on the desk, places his head in his hands, and begins to quietly shake, entirely alone.]//\n\n----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n+ REMAINDER OF FORERUNNER TRIAD MATERIAL IS:\n[[span class=\"ram\"]][[[rounderhouse-jade-proposal | NOW AVAILABLE]]][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[div class=\"rnb-navbar\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-last\"]]\n[[a href=\"/interregnum-blackstar\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]PREVIOUS[[/span]]\n<< INTERREGNUM I >>[[/a]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-current\"]]\n[[a href=\"/redtape\"]]REDTAPE[[/a]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"rnb-item rnb-next jadeproposal\"]]\n[[a href=\"/rounderhouse-jade-proposal\" style=\"display: block;\"]][[span class=\"rnb-supertitle\"]]NEXT[[/span]]\n<< THE JADE PROPOSAL >>[[/a]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7544]]] | SCP-7545 | [[[SCP-7546]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Ralliston and Rounderhouse]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** bunker.png\n> **Name:** Bunker Fuchsegg\n> **Author:** Kecko\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/kecko/11949089563 Flickr]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
