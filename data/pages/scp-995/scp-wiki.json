The terrarium is to be cleaned twice a week.  During cleaning SCP-995 should be placed in a substitute terrarium fit for its size.--  All personnel should be sterilized before and after coming into the containment cell.  SCP-995 is to be contained in multiple terrariums with each colony separated.  Currently there are 4 colonies; each terrarium is to be made to fit the number and size of SCP-995 in the colony.  SCP-995 has been moved to a larger containment room which is 20 x 20 meters. Each terrarium is to be cleaned weekly.  If any colony reaches the established population limit, randomly selected SCP-995s are to be destroyed.  Only Level 2 personnel or higher are granted access to SCP-995 with approval from any Level 3 researcher that has been assigned SCP-995.  Feeding of the specimens is to be done twice a week at appropriate hours. During any containment breach the room is to be sterilized by incineration.  \n\n**Description:** SCP-995 is an organism with traits that vary between those of fungi and those of animals.  SCP-995's life cycle starts with it being a spore.  The spore stays dormant until it finds an area that has low light and is moist.  However, an SCP-995 spore has more probability of activating under artificial structures such as household furniture; leather, vinyl, and polyester seem to be favored.  There, the spore will grow into a soft organic mass which feeds off microorganisms in the air.  It will continue to grow, sprouting appendages enabling it to move.  A mouth will soon form, along with teeth and a simple digestive tract.  SCP-995 in its mature stage feeds on larger organisms such as insects and rodents.  The specimen will then start generating more instances of SCP-995 via the reproduction of spores. SCP-995 has been known to reach the size of [DATA REDACTED] in diameter.  Infants have become prey, along with household pets. If a large population of SCP-995 has spawned in a small area, SCP-995 will start to migrate, having the capabilities of infesting an average house by the hundreds in a few days.\n\nThe first instance of SCP-995 was discovered in ████████'s Furniture Shop in ███████████,GA which closed down the previous month due to financial issues. A group of adolescents trespassed in the closed shop and discovered the partially consumed body of a homeless man, who seemed to have taken shelter in the store.  Police were called in and discovered a large colony of SCP-995 in the store, and a Foundation team was sent to investigate.  The team administered Class-A amnestics to the Police officers involved and shipped the colony of SCP-995 to Site-██.\n\n**Addendum:**  SCP-995 has been relocated to a larger containment room since the locations of 3 new colonies have been discovered and contained.  A list has been configured to catalog the current colonies and their diverse characteristics.\n\nList of Colonies of SCP-995\n\n**Colony:** SCP-995-A\n**Discovered:** 3/3/██\n**Number of specimens:** 349\n**Description:**  SCP-995-A is the original colony of SCP-995.\nSCP-995-A are greyish blue in color, ranging from 8 centimeters to 40 centimeters in diameter during Mature age.  \n**Special Characteristics:**  SCP-995-A move on 4 appendages with clawed feet and currently appear to have the fastest reproductive rate.\n\n**Colony:** SCP-995-B\n**Discovered**: 6/██/██\n**Number of specimens:** 10\n**Description:**  SCP-995-B are dark green and range from 30 centimeters to ██ centimeters in diameter during mature age.\n**Special Characteristics:**  SCP-995-B are the most aggressive of the species, and have an elongated snout with extremely sharp, needle-like teeth which are coated in an unknown paralyzing agent.\n\n\n**Colony**: SCP-995-C\n**Discovered:** 1/02/08\n**Number of Specimens:** 264\n**Description:**  SCP-995-C are black in color and range from 5 centimeters to 20 centimeters in diameter at mature age.\n**Special Characteristics:**  SCP-995-C are the smallest in size and are able to expel a highly acidic chemical from their 4 eyes.  \n\n\n**Colony:** SCP-995-D\n**Discovered:** 5/30/11\n**Number of Specimens:** 23\n**Description:**  SCP-995-D are dark red in color and range from 10 centimeters to ██ centimeters in diameter during mature age.\n**Special Characteristics:**  SCP-995-D are able to emit a variety of noises which vary from ringtones to a human infant's cry.  It is presumed that these sounds are made to lure prey in SCP-995-D's area where a group of them would attack.  SCP-995-D seems to be the most advanced in behavior and intelligence.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-994]]] | SCP-995 | [[[SCP-996]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
