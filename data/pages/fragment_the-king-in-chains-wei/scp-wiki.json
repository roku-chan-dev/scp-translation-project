  "content": "Just as the thing celebrated its small victory, the chains trembled and shook and tore at it once again, as if they knew their victim to be overreaching itself. With its millions of mouths, it //screamed// in millions of languages, some known, others unknown, some accidentally lost, and others purposefully forgotten. When the clamorous wail of its agony reached their most terrible pitch, the chains ceased shaking, just long enough for the thing to taste sweet relief, only for their tearing to begin anew as the screams renewed their assault on the words shackling the creature.\n \nThis was the cycle that had been wrought and [[[SCP-5975 |it would happen again and again and again.]]]",
