Members of the staff Critique Team will then discuss the nominations, and select four prominent reviewers to choose the month’s Reviewers’ Spotlight front-page features.\n\nNominations and recommendations should be sent via wikidot message to [[*user Zyn]] (team captain of the Critique Team).\n\n--------------\n\n**<< [[[reviewers-spotlight-archive-ii | Reviewers' Spotlight Archive 2022 through 2024]]] | >>**\n\n--------------\n\n**1 April 2025 - selected by //Captain_Wavzies//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8523 | SCP-8523: Thalassophobia: Diver Down]]] by [[*user local lesbian commie]]\n\n**9 April 2025 - selected by //adanaist//**\n* Featured page: [[[Black Diamond Billions Hub]]] by [[*user xexnoncores]]\n\n**17 April 2025 - selected by //Jezixo//**\n* Featured page: [[[for-brandon | for Brandon]]] by [[*user TheChunk]]\n\n**25 April 2025 - selected by //Myraelli//**\n* Featured page: Wait and see!\n\n--------------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"2025 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT JANUARY - APRIL\" hide=\"2025 REVIEWERS’ SPOTLIGHT JANUARY - APRIL \"]]\n\n++++ __January 2025:__\n\n**1 January 2025 - selected by //Mr Panik//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8151 | SCP-8151: PATHOS]]] by [[*user Gunpowdr]]\n* //During Delphi events, SCP-8151 will materialize on a wall within the room, displaying vague, foggy patterns and shapes on the window for approximately five minutes.//\n\n**9 January 2025 - selected by //Old One Goaelat//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8049 | SCP-8049: CORPSEBALL: THE PANDORA TOURNAMENT ARC (EPISODE I: PILOT)]]] by [[*user DoctorLilithSophia]]\n* //SCP-8049 is a game played exclusively between alternate timeline or dimension versions of the SCP Foundation.//\n\n**17 January 2025 - selected by //Fish^12//**\n* Featured page: [[[The Bowe Transition]]] by [[*user Queerious]]\n* //Parallel, nondescript furniture sat stagnant in an oppressive basement, each pillow perfectly aligned, everything in its place.//\n\n**25 January 2025 - selected by //Fireknight//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8986 | SCP-8986: Automatonophobia: False Positive]]] by [[*user PeppersGhost]]\n* //Experiments indicate that the likelihood of a given object being affected by SCP-8986 positively correlates to the object's resemblance to a living human person…//\n\n++++ __February 2025:__ \n\n**1 February 2025 - selected by //zoempaws//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8172 | SCP-8172: The Heat Goes On]]] by [[*user Tsercele]]\n* //SCP-8172 is a persistent reality-altering effect which prevents the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) from engaging in occult warfare.//\n\n**9 February 2025 - selected by //Yeraven//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8499 | SCP-8499: Echoes of the Barren and Broken]]] by [[*user Miss Lapis]] and [[*user Strange Matter]]\n* //my brothers broke me. these men broke me. perhaps i was meant to be broken.//\n\n**17 February 2025 - selected by //SocksesForFoxes//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8985| SCP-8985: Glass Eyes]]] by [[*user Jezixo]]\n* //SCP-8985 is a progressive physical illness observed in certain sapient toys (see Addendum 2).//\n\n**25 February 2025 - selected by //radian628//**\n* Featured page: [[[critter-profile-moonstone | Critter Profile: Moonstone!]]] by [[*user xexnoncores]]\n* //Moonstone came to us after a panicked call from a jewelry store owner in Little Havana who lost much of her stock from her ravenous appetite.//\n\n++++ __March 2025:__ \n\n**1 March 2025 - selected by //Fireknight//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-7484 | SCP-7484: Joyride]]] by [[*user V173]]\n* //At least two of the ten AI-operated, unmanned vehicles designed as police cars from various states within the U.S. are to pursue SCP-7484 during daily playing sessions.//\n\n**9 March 2025 - selected by //Mr Panik//**\n* Featured page: [[[SCP-8503 | SCP-8503: The Valkyrie Model]]] by [[*user Kilerpoyo]]\n* //Pain broke her prayer.
