  "content": "You graciously accept the cup of coffee from the beautiful stranger. They give you a brilliant smile and take a seat next to you, handing you your mug of coffee. They introduce themselves as Kyler, and you introduce yourself back. The two of you get to talking, and find you have a lot in common. The minutes fly by as the two of you discuss your jobs, hopes, dreams, ambitions, and a million other things. You’ve never felt so connected to another person in your life.\n\nOver the next few minutes, or maybe hours, or maybe days, you find yourself getting completely lost in Kyler's deep starry eyes, their luscious red lips, their bright rosy cheeks, and everything else about them. Eventually you find yourself pouring your heart out to them, this person you've just met, and they're doing the same. The of you laugh, you cry, you feel so very... right with this person. You think to yourself that's you didn't really believe in love at first sight, but... Is that what this is? Then you lose yourself in those eyes again, and realize it must be.\n\nYour mind wanders in those eyes. You see your life together with Kyler: Planning the wedding, honeymooning at a beach or a mountain, buying a nice little house out in the suburbs, moving in together, decorating and making the place yours together. Eventually the two of you may even start a family, raising your children with all the love in the world. Your world would be so full of love, you and Kyler. Eventually the two of you will grow old together, sitting side-by-side in that quaint little house...\n\nSuddenly your clipboard clatters on the table in front of you. You practically jump in surprise as you turn to see Greg walking back to his computer. Startled back to reality, you quickly glance over all the information. Everything seems in order. You turn back to Kyler only to find that they’re rinsing both coffee mugs in the sink.\n\n“I suppose we should both get back to work, huh?” They turn to you with that beaming smile. You don’t want to leave, but you know they’re right. The Foundation marches on, and both of you have jobs to do. You stand and thank them once again for the coffee. You want to ask more, but before you can ask anything else, they walk up and slip something into your shirt pocket, whispering in your ear that they hope they’ll see you again. Then, in a flurry of papers, they’re gone, and you’re left too dazed to process what just happened.\n\nStill dazed, you walk out of the Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation of Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs, slowly making your way back to the Auditing Department. You’re halfway back before you even realize that something was placed in your shirt pocket. You reach in and find a small piece of paper. On it is written a small note in absolutely gorgeous handwriting: \n\n“Call me -Kyler” followed by a 10-digit number.\n\nCongratulations! You found the Romance Ending! You found the person of your dreams, and will undoubtedly have a wonderful relationship with them once you work up the courage to call them.\n\n||= Page 10 - Romance Ending||\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/0 Try again to get all 7 endings!]||\n||= or||",
