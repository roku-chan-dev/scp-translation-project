It displays a single anomalous effect which is that the vinyl record on it is continuously spinning. Further tests are needed to determine nature of this effect.\n\n[[div class=\"story\"]]\nYou step outside and begin to make your way towards the pre-containment sector.\n\nOn your way, you happen to pass by Sally.\n\n\"Dr. ████████.\" she greets you as you walk past.\n\n\"Ms. Hawthorne. What are you up to?\"\n\n\"I was just heading to the, uh, rec room to get a snack.\" she replies.\n\n\"Okay, cool.\" You think for a second. \"Can you come help me with 3939 for a while?\"\n\n\"Really? I'm pretty hungry.\"\n\n\"Yes, really. Don't make me force you.\"\n\nIf she has further argument, she doesn't offer any.\n\n[[div class=\"choices\"]]\n[/scp-3939/offset/4 Head to the holding cell.]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]",
