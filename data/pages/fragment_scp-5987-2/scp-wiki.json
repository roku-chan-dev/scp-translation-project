  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-5987\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A 3 km radius around SCP-5987's manifestation area has been blocked off from all sea and air traffic. Foundation vehicles should not go within 2 km of SCP-5987.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5987 is a Type-4H Apparition[[footnote]]Referring to apparitions of usually inanimate objects.[[/footnote]] centralized to a small area in Arcachon Bay, off the southwest coast of France. Between the time of nautical twilight on the evening of one day, and nautical twilight on the following day, a 19th century brig will appear, sailing around the bay before vanishing. SCP-5987 has been observed to always stay within a kilometer of its manifestation point.\n\nAll vehicles that approach SCP-5987, hereby referred to as SCP-5987-1 instances, will be unable to be controlled by their operators. Wheels, pedals, and other methods of directional movement will still function, but will not produce their desired results. SCP-5987-1 instances will then immediately dive underwater, typically killing all passengers onboard.\n\nAn annual analysis of predecessor files in 2017 revealed that the ASCI had documented an anomaly similar to SCP-5987, centred around a vessel two hundred years earlier that was believed to be neutralized when Item 6789-AH, the captain FranÃ§ois Aregnaudeau, was killed at sea as part of a suspected mutiny.\n\nDue to an increasing risk of sightings by civilians, current containment efforts are being redirected towards Neutralization of SCP-5987. A mission was approved to search the manifestation area for any signs of spectral significance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 01/07/2019\n\n**VESSEL:** SCPS Submersible //Nephthys//\n----\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**23:00:** SCPS //Nephthys// approaches the radius of SCP-5987's area of effect.\n\n**23:05:** SCP-5987 turns towards the submarine. Command loses communication with //Nephthys// as it submerges.\n\n**23:05-23:16:** Command attempts to re-establish contact with the submersible.\n\n**23:16:** Communication is re-established. Captain Doumer reports that the submersible experienced heavy but non-essential damage from colliding with the ocean floor. However, anomalous influence on //Nephthys// has ceased. Doumer requests an update on his current objective.\n\n**23:16-23:34:** Deliberations are held between the members of the research team. Some wish to take the opportunity to investigate SCP-5987 more closely, while others insist on relying on the original mission parameters.\n\n**23:34:** Deliberation ceases when SCP-5987 is observed retreating to a further distance. A white flag is raised from its mainmast.\n\n**23:37:** Taking it as a sign of approval, //Nephthys// is cleared to proceed on its original parameters.\n\n**23:45** //Nephthys// reaches the approximate manifestation point. Numerous wooden and steel shipwrecks can be seen dotting the sea floor. //Nephthys// switches to search mode.\n\n[EXTRANEOUS LOGS REDACTED]\n\n**2:18:** //Nephthys// pauses by a small wooden shipwreck, readying the diving team. At sea level, SCP-5987 lowers its flag to half-mast before raising it to full again.[[footnote]]In maritime custom,  a dipping of the flag indicates a sign of respect or acknowledgement.[[/footnote]]\n\n**2:19:** This information is relayed to Doumer, and the divers are deployed to clear access to the wreckage.\n\n**2:25:** Several skeletons are found, all with various levels of saltwater corrosion.[[footnote]]As spectrally significant remains do not decay or corrode, they were deemed non-anomalous.[[/footnote]]\n\n**2:30:** Agent Lacroix finds a large ornate figurehead carved to resemble a siren or mermaid, buried underneath a large section of the hull. Notably, the figurehead lacks any damage.\n\n**2:35:** A loud bell chime is heard as the divers depart, and SCP-5987 vanishes prematurely. The mission is declared over and //Nephthys// returns to the surface.\n\n\n-----\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAt nautical twilight the next day, SCP-5987 did not appear and was considered Neutralized. The figurehead has been designated as SCP-5987-1 pending further examination.\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-5987/offset/2|You have (1) pending revision.
