SCP-8477-1's storage vault has been modified to allow scientific and engineering personnel to observe and experiment with the object. Because of the current malfunctioning state of SCP-8477-1 after Operation \"Final Ashes,\" research personnel are advised to be cautious when interacting with SCP-8477-1. In the case of an emergency, Area-25 security must be dispatched to neutralize the threat.\n\nBy orders of the Director of \"Pandora's Box\" Initative and the SCP-8477 Head Researcher, Dr. Philip Grant, security personnel are strictly prohibited to use lethal force that could incapacitate the research and possible development of SCP-8477-1 in the future.\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Updated Special Containment Procedures:** Following Incident 076-OMEGA on 19/03/2006, all materials related to SCP-8477 and SCP-8477-1 were destroyed due to the detonation of Area-25's on-site warhead.

At its highest point, SCP-8477 measured approximately 33 meters in height and weighed 23,000 kilograms. SCP-8477 possessed a strong electromagnetic field, that absorbed any nearby metallic objects into its body structure and integrated these objects into itself. This absorption, combined with its shape, allowed SCP-8744 to possess immense physical strength and resistance to physical harm. SCP-8477 covered and protected SCP-8477-1.\n\nSCP-8477-1 is a female-modeled, humanoid robot designed and created by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prometheus-labs-hub Prometheus Laboratories]. [[footnote]] Prometheus Laboratories, Incorporated, was a multinational conglomerate founded in 1892 that was dedicated to the study of the anomalous to develop new technologies for public and private interests. Prometheus Laboratories was an important asset in the development of paratechnology and parascience in the anomalous world, until its financial bankruptcy and dissolution in 1998.  [[/footnote]] Records of SCP-8477-1 have been lost, and personnel who worked with SCP-8477-1 have not been found as of the moment of documentation. However, Foundation researchers noticed the resemblance of SCP-8477-1 to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/grant-request-for-genetically-engineering-low-cost-organic-a All-Natural Automatons], with many key differences to its design and manufacturing of the ANA models. It is theorized that Prometheus Laboratories attempted to create a more cost-effective, resilient and non-organic automaton to replace its previous models.\n\nSCP-8477-1 seems to have been created in the final years of the corporation's existence, which caused it to receive little funding for the project. After the dissolution of Prometheus Laboratories, SCP-8477-1 was abandoned. Because of the lack of maintenance, SCP-8477-1 malfunctioned that caused the attraction of metallic materials to its body. The damage that the object caused accumulated over time, and eventually resulted in its discovery in Incident 8477-ALPHA.\n\n**Addendum 8477:** Incident 8477-ALPHA\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name=PrometheusHQHelena.jpg\n|caption=Prometheus Laboratories Helena Headquarters (2004).\n|width=350px\n]]\n\nSCP-8477 was discovered after the sudden collapse of Prometheus' Helena Headquarters, approximately 10 kilometers away from Helena's metropolitan area. After the dissolution of the company, the Foundation and the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/pentagram#pages Pentagram] [[footnote]] Officially called the U.S. Paranatural Warfare Command, it is the paranormal branch of the Department of Defense.[[/footnote]] carried out operations to recover the paratechnological and parascientific resources left by Prometheus Laboratories.\n\nDue to the disinterest of the facility's research by the company, alongside the absence of relevant anomalous objects, the organizations purchased the area to restrict civilian access. The area was under the jurisdiction of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub Unusual Incidents Unit], and protected by the Montana National Guard, until the collapse of the building at 05:30 AM on 25/11/2004. The collapse was explained as the fault of weak infrastructure from its construction to the public.\n\nThe Montana National Guard examined the area during the first hours after the collapse of the building, and reported that their equipment was absorbed into the debris of the building. UIU agents were dispatched to the area, but were unable to stop the situation. The agents reported that the metal accumulated further, and described the shape of SCP-8477 as a \"rust monster\". The situation was delegated to the Pentagram, and later the Foundation was asked to aid in the containment of the anomaly, beginning Incident 8477-ALPHA.\n\nWhen both organizations arrived, they initially followed containment procedures to avoid attracting the public's attention. However, in the course of 12 hours, both organizations were unable to control the expansion of SCP-8477 with the use of common containment methods. Fearing the object's expansion, the Foundation and the Pentagram expanded the restricted zone to twenty kilometers from the location of the incident, cut connections to nearby civilian areas, established Area-744 as a militarized perimeter zone, and allowed the deployment of battalion-sized elements like [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#nu-7 Mobile Task Force Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\")] as well as occult elements of the United States Army and Air Force. However, these measures did not stop the expansion of SCP-8477. Because of the risk that it could bring to the civil population and the Veil, the Foundation and the Pentagram requested the aid of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-zero-part-3 Bowe Commission].[[footnote]]The Bowe Commission was a black operations force established in 2002, that represented the interests of the United States federal government and under the jurisdiction of the Pentagram, that established a mutual cooperation agreement with the Foundation to fight paraterrorism and paracrime.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum 8477.2:** Operation \"Final Ashes\"\n\nOperation \"Final Ashes\" was the codename used by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#omega-7 Mobile Task Force Omega-7 (\"Pandora's Box\")] High Command and approved by the Bowe Commission on 25/11/2004, under [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-935/offset/1 General Willis Bowe].

Ω7-015 hands over her canteen to SCP-105, who drinks from it. Ω7-015 looks up at Cpt. Ghost.//\n\n**Ω7-015:** It's thirsty. It's still tired from her training, and I'm concerned that its performance in the operation may not be optimal because of its condition.\n\n//General Bowe speaks up, but is interrupted by SCP-076-2.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Then she must recover, and soon. If her training tires her this much, then we can't expect her to do much in this battle.\n\n//SCP-105 stops drinking, and looks at the floor.

It's only missing its legs, but it's standing over a pile of metal. It looks like it is attaching the metal to what seems to be its legs.\n\n**General Bowe:** Team Spyglass, fly around the anomaly at a safe distance. SCP-105, I want you to take photographs of SCP-8477 across multiple angles, so we can examine its bodily structure. Team Overkill, follow them. If SCP-8744 tries to attack both of you, or you feel that the helicopter is being affected, fly away and then reposition to a safer distance.\n\n**Pilots:** Yes, sir.\n\n//Team Spyglass and Team Overkill fly around the anomaly, and SCP-105 walks towards the edge, with Ω7-014 standing besides her.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** Be careful, we don't want you to fall the floor.

SCP-8744 looks up at the helicopters, the metal clanks as the anomaly moves. Ω7-008 covers one of his ears.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** God, that clanking is so loud. It feels like I have a bell right in my ear. Has it made that noise all this time?\n\n**Dr. Grant:** The noise has varied throughout the hours. It started after the building collapsed, but had increased as SCP-8477 has reached its current form. If we allow SCP-8477 to continue its growth, the noise will increase further.\n\n**Ω7-008:** How come nobody in Helena has said anything about the noise?\n\n**Dr. Grant:** It will be covered as a case of mass hysteria, and added to the rest of cover story about the incident.\n\n**General Bowe:** The cover story will not work if we let SCP-8477 grow though, so we must stop it as soon as we can.\n\n//SCP-105 camera flash sounds through the microphone.//\n\n**SCP-105:** I took the last photo, General.\n\n**General Bowe:** Excellent work, asset. Now, Captain, tell me what do you see.\n\n//Cpt. Ghost looks at SCP-105's photographs in real time.//\n\n**Cpt. Ghost:** I can see SCP-8477 move through multiple angles from the asset's photos. What really catches my eye is that it looks like the metal is mostly concentrated around what would be sternum in a normal human body. From there, the rest of the metal lowers in its concentration. It seems that's the reason why the upper body is fully formed while the lower isn't.\n\n**Ω7-014:** If that's the case, then...\n\n**SCP-105:** Then whatever it is making SCP-8477 move is probably in that part of the body.\n\n//Dr. Grant smirks.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** Is it not a clever one, General?\n\n//General Bowe ignores Dr. Grant's comment.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Let us test that theory, 105.

He fills the magazine with HK-016-compatible magnetized plastic rounds, and points at the sternum. Ω7-008 breathes, and fires. SCP-8477 moves parts of its chest to its sternum, and is hit by the bullet. SCP-8477 returns its metal to its place, with the point of the round barely piercing the surface of its sternum.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** Fuck, it didn't hit, General.\n\n**General Bowe:** It is fine, agent. That is the confirmation I needed. Alright, Team Overkill, Team Spyglass, pay attention and listen carefully.\n\n//General Bowe explains the plan to Omega-7, and has been omitted for brevity's sake.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Any questions?\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Negative, sir.\n\n**Cpt. Ghost:** No, sir.\n\n**General Bowe:** Any questions, SCP-076-2?\n\n//Slowly, SCP-076-2 briefly smiles, before returning to its common behaviour.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** We should stop wasting our time and enter the battlefield, General. The enemy is waiting for us.\n\n//Team Overkill and Team Spyglass separate, each flying to their new positions. The helicopter carrying SCP-076-2 confirms its position, and General Bowe authorizes their permission: SCP-076-2 jumps from the helicopter and lands on its feet, lifting a cloud of dust. SCP-8477 looks at the cloud of dust that covers SCP-076-2, and begins to lift its hand. The stationed forces surrounding the area look up at the raised-up hand in the sky, perplexed. The nearby helicopters move away from the hand. With a final, dry clank, SCP-8477 pulls its hand down. SCP-076-2 whispers to itself in Ancient Greek.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** I think that Fortune watcheth o'er our lives, surer than we...\n\n//SCP-8477 smashes down at SCP-076-2, who pulls a longsword of an anomalous metal, stopping SCP-8744 mid-air. SCP-076-2's feet sink into the dirt, and continues to whisper to itself while clenching its teeth.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** ...But well said: he who strives will find his gods strive for him equally.\n\n//SCP-076-2 pushes SCP-8477's hand away and cuts down its thumb. SCP-076-2 jumps back and runs away from the dust cloud. SCP-8744 reattaches its fallen metal to its hand, but is shot down by Ω7-008. SCP-8744 pulls its hand out, and the rest of Team Overkill and Team Spyglass shoots at the object. SCP-076-2 jumps to SCP-8477's and tries to run over it, but the metal trips on its feet. SCP-8477 shakes its arm, and SCP-076-2 stabs its sword onto the arm, gripping the handle. The asset pushes forward while it pushes its sword to move onto its arm. Then, SCP-8477's arm stops holding its arm together, and lets its metal fall to the ground. SCP-076-2 falls down and is covered by metal, and he quickly pushes the metal away from it. However, the metal returns to SCP-8477's arm. SCP-8477 then holds SCP-076-2 in its hand, and grips it firmly. SCP-076-2 groans, and forces the hand the open, but SCP-8477's grip tightens.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Shit, it has Able!\n\n//Maj. Breckenridge sits in the gunner's seat, and proceeds to fire at SCP-8477. SCP-8477 turns back, and slaps its hand to the sky, trying to bring Team Overkill's helicopter down. The pilot pulls the helicopter up quickly, making Ω7-008 and Maj. Breckenridge lose their balance. Ω7-008 falls down from the door's edge, and holds himself from the helicopter's rail, while his sniper falls down. He pulls himself up, and yells at the pilot.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** Get us out of here! Shit, my sniper. General, my sniper fell to the ground!\n\n**General Bowe:** I noticed. Team Spyglass, continue what you are doing Team Overkill, put a safe distance and regain balance. Breckenridge, continue your distraction.\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** On it, General!\n\n**General Bowe:** SCP-105.\n\n//SCP-105 stops firing, and cleans the sweat from its eyebrow.//\n\n**SCP-105:** Yes, General?\n\n**General Bowe:** How plausible it is to throw a grenade through one of your photographs?\n\n**SCP-105:** ...I am not sure, sir.\n\n**General Bowe:** Do it, make sure it lands over the object's hand but far enough to not blow up your teammate.\n\n//SCP-105 takes out a grenade and pulls the pin, throwing it into one of its photographs. The grenade falls from the sky above SCP-8477's arm, which is then attracted and attached to its arm. The grenade explodes, and blows up its forearm. SCP-076-2 falls to the floor and rolls away before the metal falls above it. SCP-076-2 pants while Dr. Grant mumbles in the microphone.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** That is interesting. It seems that small, rapid objects are not immediately dismantled by its electromagnetic field. Or if it could, then the explosion will probably still occur because of tampering with the object. It is quite a shame that we cannot test this in a more controlled environment.\n\n**SCP-076-2:** What... are you talking about now, doctor?\n\n**Dr. Grant:** I am saying that we can use SCP-105's photographs to our advantage.\n\n//Caught off guard, SCP-076-2 notices at the last moment SCP-8477 smashing down a fist to its direction. SCP-076-2 rolls back and runs away, while Dr. Grant continues to talk.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** Basically, we could possibly destabilize SCP-8477's structure by using your teammate's photographs to launch explosives, by exploding the foundations that allows the anomaly to stand. Take away those foundations, and SCP-8477 will fall down like a house of cards.\n\n**SCP-076-2:** And that will allow me to administer the coup de grâce.\n\n//SCP-076-2 manifests a two-handed sword.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** Yes. But, to be precise, you are not exactly known for mercy killing. Still, the allegory works.\n\n**SCP-076-2:** I finally agree with something you said, doctor.\n\n//SCP-076-2 screams, and lashes out against SCP-8477, and slashes its feet. SCP-8477 kicks SCP-076-2 and misses, the latter moves away while the object tries to neutralize SCP-076-2. With the assistance of Ω7-014 and Ω7-015, SCP-105 throws grenades to SCP-8477 through its photographs. The grenades land on SCP-8744's feet and explodes. SCP-8744 falls to the ground. SCP-076-2 runs away from the object's fall, but at the end of its head, Army soldiers in their tanks stand in front of the falling anomaly. They scream and try to run away, but SCP-8477 falls over them.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** Fuck, they dropped down like flies. General, your soldiers are dying!\n\n**General Bowe:** They will receive their decorations for their sacrifice, and their families the proper benefits, Agent.\n\n**Ω7-014:** Yeah, I'm sure--\n\n//The tanks of the soldiers explode in SCP-8477's face, completely destroying the head of the anomaly. The debris flies around the area and falls across the area, where more soldiers and task force officers try to run away from the explosion. Many of them die from the falling debris, as the metals mutilates through their bodies while they scream for help.//\n\n**General Bowe:** SCP-076-2, now it is time to strike while the anomaly is down. Rip its back, and you will reach the core.\n\n//SCP-076-2 nods, outrunning and jumping the falling debris. It jumps over its now blown-up legs, and runs over what remains of SCP-8477's body. SCP-076-2 stops and stands over the back of SCP-8477's chest, and manifests a new longsword. SCP-076-2 raises its sword and, at the moment it is about to strike, SCP-8477's arms rotates and slaps SCP-076-2. SCP-076-2 flies away, crashes over multiple tank and injures operatives. Finally, SCP-076-2 crashes in one of the tanks, ripping a hole into it. SCP-076-2 hits the back of its head, and is knocked down.//\n\n//For fifteen seconds, nobody speaks. Task force operatives and Army soldiers, instead of running to help the anomaly, leave SCP-076-2. SCP-8477 uses its arms to stand up and walk, approaching abandoned tanks and using its metal to reconstruct its broken body.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** ...It can't be.\n\n//Maj. Breckenridge grabs his microphone and calls out SCP-076-2.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** SCP-076-2, can you hear me?!\n\n//SCP-076-2 does not respond.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Able, can you hear me?! Wake up!\n\n//Below the helicopters, the clanking sounds becomes louder, and slowly SCP-8477 reconstructs its head.//\n\n**Maj.

I-I can't do it, I can't--\n\n//SCP-105 covers its mouth, and Ω7-014 puts his hand over its shoulder.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** Don't worry, Iris. It's okay. We'll figure something out.\n\n//Dr. Grants rasps his throat.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** If you do not mind me interrupting, we already have a way to bring SCP-076-2, General. It is under the possession of Agent Rackley, and he was given with this medication for a moment exactly like this one.\n\n**Ω7-008:** The serum? Are you out of your mind, Grant?!\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Rackley, you don't talk like that to a superior!\n\n**Ω7-008:** I don't care, Major! I'm not giving him the serum. We know that the serum is still being experimented, and Dr. Grant wants to administer some drugs that will do who knows what!\n\n**Dr. Grant:** It will give him the energy he needs to get back up and defeat the anomaly, Agent.\n\n**Ω7-008:** And probably with the entire fucking men in the ground. He might even find a way to reach us and kill all of us. Do you really want to take that risk, doctor?!\n\n//A tank explodes underneath the helicopters, and they look down. SCP-8477 is now actively seeking out more tanks, while the operatives on the ground run away, unwilling to defend their positions. The established area is beginning to break, and SCP-8477 is now reconstructing its legs.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** From what I am seeing in the footage, I //am// willing to take the risk. If we do not use the serum now, we will lose control of the situation and breach the containment of SCP-8477. But we will //also// miss the opportunity to use the serum, and lose valuable information that we could use to perfect the current formula so that it is more stable in any future operations. We do not have a choice, Agent.\n\n//Suddenly, SCP-8477 puts its attention to Team Spyglass' helicopter, and forms sharp pieces of metal from its finger tips.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** We can go for another option: let SCP-105 repeat what she did! She exploded 8477's legs, we can help her with the rest of the body. We can damage the body so much that 8477 will not have enough time to repair itself, and we can reach for the core!\n\n//SCP-105 screams, and Ω7-015 yells.//\n\n**Ω7-015:** Look out, Iris!\n\n//SCP-8477 launches the sharp metal to Team Spyglass' helicopter. It pierces the helicopter, causing it to lose balance. Ω7-008 covers SCP-105 with his body, while holding onto the door to not fall down. Then, a small piece of piece of metal cuts through his eye. For five seconds, Ω7-015 does not say anything. Then, he briefly gasps and screams. He brings his hands to his eye, and pulls himself to the inside of the helicopter. Ω7-014 closes the door, and looks back to Ω7-015.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** A█████, are you okay?!\n\n//SCP-105 stands up and holds Ω7-015, while he continues to cry and scream in pain.//\n\n**SCP-105:** A-A█████, it's okay. You're going to be okay. We'll get you a doctor, I promise. J-Just...\n\n//SCP-105 begins to cry over Ω7-015's uniform.//\n\n**SCP-105:** Just don't leave me, //please//.\n\n//Ω7-014 grabs a first-aid kit, and moves SCP-105 back.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** He'll be okay, Iris. Now let me help him.\n\n//SCP-105 stands back and sits in one of the chairs, while she stares blankly at Ω7-014 comforting Ω7-015. Cpt. Ghost yells to the pilot.//\n\n**Cpt. Ghost:** What are you doing?! Get us out of here!\n\n**Pilot:** I can't leave without orders from General Bowe.\n\n//Ω7-014 looks at the pilot in disbelief.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** Y-You've gotta be kidding me! Can't you see he's dying?!\n\n**Cpt. Ghost:** General, Agent A██████ is wounded! We can't keep him here.\n\n**General Bowe:** ...Take Team Spyglass to the nearest on-site medical facility, now.\n\n//The pilot nods and flies away.//\n\n**Ω7-014:** Thank you, //General//.\n\n//Command and Team Overkill remain silent for fifteen seconds.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Administer the serum, Agent.\n\n**Ω7-008:** ...Yes, sir.\n\n//The helicopter flies to where SCP-076-2 fell, and SCP-8477 finishes reconstructing its legs.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Rackley, we will leave you a few meters from the tank. I need Breckenridge to diverge SCP-8477's attention from you, so you can have enough time to administer the serum, let it have its effects on SCP-076-2, and for it to wake up. SCP-076-2 will attack SCP-8477 by surprise.\n\n**Ω7-008:** I'm guessing I'm not part of the plan by then.\n\n**General Bowe:** I hope the serum does not act too fast for you to stand in the way.\n\n**Ω7-008:** Yeah, I hope so too.\n\n//The helicopter stands two meters from the tank, and Ω7-008 jumps down with a biohazard box. He turns around to see Maj. Breckenridge.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Good luck, Agent. I hope this works.\n\n**Ω7-008:** Oh, it better work. But hey, I won't have to worry about it working or not if I'm killed in the process.\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Let me worry about that, what do you say?\n\n**Ω7-008:** Sounds like a deal.\n\n//They wave at each other, and Maj. Breckenridge orders the pilot to pull up. Ω7-008 turns around and walks to the broken tank. The tank's front is split in two, and Ω7-008 enters into the hole. Inside, the tank is barely light up with the sparks of broken circuits, and SCP-076-2 is knocked down in the middle. Ω7-008 puts his finger over its neck, and senses a weak pulse. He opens the box, and fills the inside with smoke. Ω7-008 coughs and takes the needle. He grabs SCP-076-2 wrist, and injects the needle, administering the drug. Finally, he finishes administering the serum, and pulls the needle out. Ω7-008 reaches for SCP-076-2's neck, but it suddenly opens its eyes and stares at Ω7-008.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** Able! We--\n\n//SCP-076-2 chokes his neck, and Ω7-008 grabs its wrist. SCP-076-2 stands up, tightening its grip over Ω7-008 neck. Ω7-008 tries to kick it, and sees SCP-076-2's eyes irritated. Ω7-008 tries to speak up.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** A-Able, w-wait! I.. //We//, need your help. The-- rust monster. It's still //alive//. W-We need you t-to-- //kill it//.\n\n//Ω7-008 stops holding SCP-076-2, while he continues to stare at him. Ω7-008 begins to lose consciousness, until he and SCP-076-2 hear gunshots piercing through metal. SCP-076-2 loosens its grip, and Ω7-008 takes deep breaths. SCP-076-2 steps out of the tank, and sees Maj. Breckenridge shooting at SCP-8477 while the pilot avoids its attacks. Ω7-008 steps out of the tank, and rubs his neck.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** You were knocked out for a moment, and it managed to reconstruct its entire body. The entire area is slowly breaking, Iris' team is gone, and we couldn't take 8477 by ourselves. We need you to take it down, Able. You're the only one who can.\n\n//SCP-076-2 clenches its fists.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** W-We can help you take it down, just tell us what we need--\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Agent Rackley.\n\n//Ω7-008 gulps.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** Yeah?\n\n**SCP-076-2:** You are a warrior, and the Major too. I am honored to have both of you fight alongside me, and still willing to do so. However, it is better you don't.\n\n**Ω7-008:** Why's that?\n\n**SCP-076-2:** I must make up for the disgrace that that monster has brought onto me.\n\n//SCP-076-2 looks back at Ω7-008, and he takes a deep breath.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** And I'd kill you while I'm at it. You'd only stand in my way.\n\n//Ω7-008 shakes, and takes a step back. SCP-076-2 nods, and looks back at SCP-8477, and yells at the top of its lungs. Maj. Breckenridge stops firing, and SCP-8477 looks at SCP-076-2. SCP-076-2 runs to SCP-8477, leaving a trail of dust in its wake. It violently breathes in and out, as it jumps and outruns the attacks of SCP-8477. SCP-8477 brings its arm up, and violently pushes it down to SCP-076-2. The latter stops, and SCP-8477 smashes the asset. However, SCP-076-2 grips the arm of SCP-8477 while it bleeds from its hands, and twists the metal. SCP-076-2 yells, and yanks the arm from SCP-8477's shoulder. SCP-8477 steps back, and steps on SCP-076-2. It jumps out of the way, and holds itself onto its feet, rapidly climbing up. SCP-8477 tries to catch SCP-076-2 by covering it in metal, but SCP-076-2 smashes and breaks the metal that comes into its way.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Major Breckenridge, shot at SCP-8477, make a dis--\n\n**SCP-076-2:** //No//!\n\n//SCP-076-2 screams over its microphone and manifests a two-handed sword, and stabs it into SCP-8477's hips.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** When I tell you, Major, you will shoot at its breastbone. Understand?!\n\n//Maj. Breckenridge does not respond for ten seconds.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** What are your orders, General?\n\n//General Bowe does not respond for five seconds.//\n\n**General Bowe:** Follow his orders, Major. But only this //time//, Able.\n\n//SCP-076-2 smiles.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Only this time.\n\n//SCP-076-2 stabs its knives one by one.  SCP-076-2 climbs its back, and holds itself to the back of SCP-8744's chest. SCP-076-2 stays there, and pierces the back of the object. SCP-8477 shakes its body, but SCP-076-2 stabs it again. SCP-8744 rotates its arms again, and reaches for SCP-076-2.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Now!\n\n//SCP-076-2 jumps to SCP-8477's neck and holds itself there, and Maj. Breckenridge fires to SCP-8477 with his rifle. The round pierces the chest, and flies to the other side. SCP-8477 stumbles on its feet, and SCP-076-2 jumps to the other side. SCP-076-2 stabs both swords, and slides itself down to SCP-8477's breastbone, now partly open from the shot. SCP-076-2 uses its body motion to take jump and push SCP-8477, causing the object to fall down to the floor. Ω7-008 murmurs under his breath from afar.//\n\n**Ω7-008:** Holy fucking shit...\n\n//SCP-076-2 screams and begins to stab SCP-8477's breastbone. The anomaly covers itself, trying to stop SCP-076-2 from cutting its chest. Tired, SCP-076-2 throws its knifes away and uses its hands to rip SCP-8477's chest apart. While working better, SCP-076-2 cannot open the breastbone. SCP-076-2 yells in frustration, and screams at the microphone.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Breckenridge, throw me a grenade!\n\n//Maj. Breckenridge throws a grenade, and SCP-076-2 catches it in the air. SCP-076-2 rips one side of SCP-8477's chest, its hands bleeding even more in the process, and shoves the grenade inside of it. SCP-8477 covers the hole SCP-076-2 made, but then explodes from the inside out. Debris from the chest falls everywhere, and some of it cuts SCP-076-2. The rest of the body paralyzes, and SCP-076-2 begins to rip the hole it made even more. Then, it reaches into the inside and sees a robotic humanoid inside of the chest. SCP-076-2 grabs and pulls it out, but is stopped by the cables that surround and protect SCP-8477-1.  SCP-076-2 screams, and yanks SCP-8477-1 away in one pull.//\n\n**Maj. Breckenridge:** Did Able get it?\n\n**Ω7-008:** Is that another robot? Don't tell me we have to fight that one too...\n\n//Dr. Grant steps in.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** So that is what was inside of SCP-8477, and it looks like in perfect condition!\n\n//SCP-8744-1 sparks, and reaches for SCP-076-2. It holds its arm, and begins to tighten its grip on it, while SCP-076-2 stares at SCP-8477-1.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** SCP-076-2, what are you doing?! We need the anomaly in the most optimal conditions!\n\n**General Bowe:** Alright, SCP-076-2, that will suffice. Return to your helicopter--\n\n//SCP-076-2 manifests a sword made of an unknown metal, and stabs SCP-8477-1 in the chest. Dr. Grant yells at SCP-076-2, and SCP-8477-1 hand falls to its side. The metal that formed SCP-8477 collapses in the ground, and SCP-076-2 stands in a mountain of metal. SCP-076-2 holds SCP-8477-1 in the air, and yells to the air in Classical Latin, gasping in between words.//\n\n**SCP-076-2:** Veni, vidi, vici.\n\n//Dr. Grant murmurs under his breath, while Maj. Breckenridge arrives to Ω7-008 to pick him up, while they stare at SCP-076-2. Nobody speaks for fifteen seconds.//\n\n**General Bowe:** ...Operation \"Final Ashes\" is over, operation successful.\n\n[[=]]\n__**<END LOG>**__\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 8477.3:** Aftermath\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name=HelenaCleanup.jpg\n|caption=Mobile Task Force Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\") undercover as construction workers under UIU supervision to clean up the remains of SCP-8477 (2004).\n|width=350px\n]]\n\nOperation \"Final Ashes\" was completed on 25/11/2004, at 21:08 MST. The operation was declared a success by General Bowe, but was criticized by the O5 Council because of the performance of MTF Omega-7, which included:\n\n* The excessive damage caused by SCP-076-2 to SCP-8477-1, and the effect on its future study by researchers.[[footnote]] Foundation researchers observed that the damaged area of SCP-8744-1, in which SCP-076-2 pierced its chest, now contained the same unknown material that SCP-076-2 used to stab SCP-8744-1. Researchers have not identified this material, and SCP-076-2 has not disclosed this information. [[/footnote]]\n* The endangerment of the Veil Protocol by containing SCP-8477 in public, instead of relocating the operation away from civilian sight.\n* The loss of infrastructure and equipment that could have been recovered from Prometheus Laboratories.\n* Finally, the cost of the operation, which to ███ million USD according to Mr. Eugene Kowalski.\n\nIn his defense of the operation during a meeting with the O5 Council, General Bowe declared the following:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e3e3e3 url(\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abowe-commission-hub/BoweComission_black_900_transp.png\") center no-repeat; margin: auto; max-width: 800px;  padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ **BOWE COMMISSION MEMORANDUM**\n[[/=]]\n\nTo the Overseer Council,\n\nFirst, I apologize for the problems caused by Omega-7 in the latest operation. I take full responsibility of the actions taken by my assets, as well as my agents. I agree with the concerns raised by some of the Overseers: it was careless, and it lacked caution during its performance. The damage was done, and we cannot change it. However, I believe that under the circumstances of the operation, it was a success. Let us review the situation objectively: SCP-8477 suddenly appeared outside of a metropolitan area, and steadily, it increased in size. My country's National Guard, Army, and Air Force could not take it down and only attracted more public attention. Your task forces, who specialize with these situations, could not resolve the problem while they saw SCP-8477 become a robotic giant.\n\nAll our forces could not stop this incident, and had we hesitated, the situation could have gotten out of control. Why is that? If I may, I will answer for you: because we tried to use conventional methods for an unconventional problem. We used all the options we had at our disposal, and we ran out of them. Suddenly, I was asked to finish the job, and when I was informed of the situation, I knew we could not wait any longer. That is why Omega-7 was deployed, Overseers. We think outside the box you have built for yourselves.\n\nThat is the point of Omega-7: to solve unconventional problems with unconventional methods. To fight unleashed monsters with the monsters we have caged. Overseers, you have your opinions about the use of an unpredictable murderer such as SCP-076-2 that was used to neutralize the target, or the use of SCP-105 as an unreliable, inefficient asset because of her age. However, we need to remember this fact: we have few options, and many enemies. If you are disappointed by the results of this operation, I believe you would have been more disappointed if you went with the conventional route.\n\nLet us review your complaints: the high costs of the operation? It would have been more expensive if SCP-8477 was let loose. The loss of material and personnel? More equipment, infrastructure, and personnel would have been lost if we continued to send everything we had at our disposal. The damage caused by SCP-076-2 to SCP-8477-1, and its potential research? I think you will agree with me that it is better that the robot is turned off than on. If it stayed on, I am convinced its containment procedures would not be so simple.\n\nOverseers, do you know why I named this operation \"Final Ashes?\" It has to do with Prometheus, the company and the titan, but there is something else: this was the last and biggest operation related to its legacy. It tells us something more: we are at the end of an era and the dawn of a new one, ladies and gentlemen. With all due respect, some of you are still trapped in that old era: where you believe that this world and the policy of Normalcy can be enforced by the conventional means you used. The truth is, not any more.\n\nPrometheus brought fire to men, but like all fire, it extinguishes down and dies -- leaving its ashes behind. Prometheus Laboratories suffered the same fate, its fire extinguished, and left its ashes behind. Now, we must ask ourselves the following question: will we let those ashes blow away into the sands of time, or start our own fire? If you allow me, again, I will answer with the motto of our brothers from [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120]: we fight fire with fire.\n\nHave a good day, Overseers.\n\n[[=]]\n— General Willis Bowe, Director of the Bowe Commission\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter the clean-up of Area-744, most of the metallic structure of SCP-8477 was identified as non-anomalous and scrapped, with the exception of the paramaterials that protected SCP-8477-1. Because of the inability to recover information about SCP-8744-1 from the Helena Headquarters, and the interest of the possible applications of the anomaly by the Bowe Commission, SCP-8477-1 was transferred to Area-25: the SCP-8477-1 research project was handed to the Research and Development Department, under the leadership of Dr. Philip Grant.\n\nAs for MTF Omega-7, SCP-105 and SCP-076-2 were rewarded for their performance in the operation, with the former anomaly required to be reprimanded by its personal psychologist, Dr. James Dantensen. As for the state of Omega-7 agents, the operation resulted in four casualties and the injury of Agent A████████ A██████. However, when Agent A██████ was sent to emergency, the doctors did not find any injuries. Agent A██████ stated that the incident turned him into a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-784-arc vegetative, biomechanical object]. His statement was considered as a delirious episode caused by PTSD from the operation by Foundation medical personnel.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:**
