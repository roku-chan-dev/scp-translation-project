The office door was half-opened, and as such the personnel was able to observe its primary anomalous effect.\n\nNote that Alex Thorley has zero record of absence from onboarding to this very day.\n \n**Addendum:** Incident \n\nOn May 2029, according to Foundation labour policies,  Department of Human Resources sent an email to Alex Thorley regarding a mandatory one-week leave, and temporally removed their right of access from SCiPnet, no response was received. However, during the aforementioned week, the office suffered from a second-degree detachment, and the sole identifiable thing was an unidentifiable cassette-like voice repeating \"I don't know\" which persisted for 98 hours 22 minutes and 7 seconds. No conclusion was made regarding the forensic analysis of the audio.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-ZH-160]]] | SCP-ZH-161 | [[[SCP-ZH-162]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
