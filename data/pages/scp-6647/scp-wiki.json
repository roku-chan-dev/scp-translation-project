Should any other instances be recovered, they should be stored within Item Locker 6647 after recovery --and testing--. No further procedures are considered necessary. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6647 is a liquid substance stored in a red glass perfume bottle. SCP-6647 is comprised of a lemon extract, a lime extract, an unknown liquid substance, and a human blood-like substance. The bottle is labelled \"Imperception de Citron.\"[[footnote]] Translated from French to English: Citrus Imperception [[/footnote]] The bottom of the bottle possesses a series of unidentified thaumaturgical symbols carved into the glass.\n\nWhen SCP-6647 is applied directly to the skin using the bottle's spraying device, the wearer's presence is forgotten by other persons at the wearer's discretion. These persons will be unable to perceive the wearer unless they are directly touched. Immediate memories of the wearer will be removed from the memory in a manner similar to the application of a Class-A amnestic. This is true for wearers being viewed on live video feeds and similar media as well, although recordings which are at least ten minutes old are unaffected. \n\nThe effects of SCP-6647 will dissipate within ten minutes, or when the subject is perceived by touch. Lost memories of the wearer, as well as memories of perceiving the wearer while under its effects, will return to those affected by it. This often creates brief moments of panic or confusion. The substance emits a Hume level of 100.25 and creates a notably strong citrus scent. [[footnote]] This is 0.25 Humes above baseline reality standard. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6647 was discovered on 8/1/2022, when Site-19 security personnel were alerted to a suspicious package which manifested in the site's mail room. The package was investigated and found to have a Hume level of 100.5. The package was found to contain SCP-6647 and a note. The note provides the global positioning coordinates of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shades-and-polo-act-one-the-show-is-about-to-begin GoI-6696,] and a request to \"clean them up.\" This information is included for its relevancy to Investigation 6647 to aid investigators and may not be relevant to this article. \n\n**Addendum 6647-1:** Testing Logs\n\nNOTICE: Due to the nature of SCP-6647 and the possibility of successful escape attempts being made by Class-D Personnel, testing is to be halted indefinitely. Requests for testing may be made to your Site Director's office, accompanied by proof of Level-3 credentials. \n\n> **Test #:** 01\n> **Date:** 8/1/2022\n> **Subject:** D-8675309\n> **Procedure:** Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin.\n> \n> **Results:** Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Believing the subject had not yet been brought to the testing lab, researchers contacted site security to request a new test subject be brought to them. On realizing this, D-8675309 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons, even while under SCP-6647's effects.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** Thanks solely to the labyrinthine nature of this facility, D-8675309 was recaptured without issue, but they very easily could've left if they knew the route. I suggest we halt testing entirely, unless someone on staff would like to volunteer.\n\n> **Test #:** 02\n> **Date:** 8/1/2022\n> **Subject:** D-8675310\n> **Procedure:** Apply SCP-6647 to the subject's face, under the chin. \n> \n> **Foreword (opt.):** This test was performed as a result of the previous test, prior to the effect wearing off.\n> \n> **Results:** Subject was immediately forgotten by researchers. Before researchers could contact site security to bring a new test subject, the effect from Test #01 wore off, causing researchers to panic and contact site security to locate D-8675309. On realizing this, D-8675310 left the room and began wandering the building in search of the exit. Researchers noted that the room smelled strongly of lemons.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** D-8675310 managed to locate the exit and was apprehended at the front gate after the effect wore off.\n\n**Addendum 6647-2:** Incident Information\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Incident 6647-1\" hide=\"▼ Close Logs\"]]\n> **General Incident Report: 8/2/2022**\n> \n> **Involved Items/Persons:** SCP-6647, PoI-6647\n> \n> **Incident Description:** At 1655 hours, a young man dressed in a top hat and a suit and tie (PoI-6647) entered Site-19 via the primary garage entry while wearing SCP-6647.[[footnote]]At no point does PoI-6647 access SCP-6647, indicating that there are other instances of the substance.[[/footnote]] They held the door open as someone left and entered through the opened doorway. An automatic intruder alarm was triggered, however, due to the effects of SCP-6647, site security were unable to perceive PoI-6647 and the person entered the facility. PoI-6647 attempted to navigate Site-19 before becoming apparently lost, at which point the effects of SCP-6647 dissipated. Site security located PoI-6647, who was immediately detained and interrogated. A transcription of the interrogation is included below.\n\n> **Interrogation Log: 8/2/2022**\n> **Interrogator:** Security Agent Stromm\n> **Detainee:** PoI-6647\n> **Others (opt.):** Dr. Patra\n> \n> __**Begin Log**__\n> \n>> //Agent Stromm sits back in his seat and stares at PoI-6647 for a few seconds before talking.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** So who are you?\n> \n>> //PoI-6647 stares at Agent Stromm, upset.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** I said, who are you? Silence won't save you here. We take intrusion seriously, especially on your level. You're better off telling us who you are before we take you and find out. \n> \n> **PoI-6647:** Fuck you.\n> \n>> //PoI-6647 spits on the interview table.//\n> \n>> //Stromm takes a deep, exasperated breath.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** Yeah, alright, fucker. Let me explain something to you. Do you know where you are?   Do you know what we do here? We lock things up. I mean we keep hold of some pretty fucked up shit. We kill things just to satiate horrors the likes of which you've never seen. I've killed people, I mean I have fucking slaughtered people. You think you're big game? You think you and whatever little gang you're part of is hot shit? We have ethics committees built just to stop me from breaking you into pieces, but you had better give us something, or I swear to god you will experience a level of pain the likes of which you will never fucking forget. \n> \n> **PoI-6647:** I've sworn an oath.

Christ man, I already told you!\n> \n>> //Agent Stromm slams PoI-6647's head into the interview table again.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** Do you seriously expect me to believe that you work for your mother!? Do I look like a fucking dumbass!?\n> \n> **PoI-6647:** Oww, fuck man, no! Th-the M.O.M.! \n> \n> **Stromm:** Never heard of them, explain. \n> \n> **PoI-6647:** No. I'll tell you that much, you'll have to kill me for the rest. \n> \n>> //Stromm grabs PoI-6647 by his shirt collar.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** That can be arranged. \n> \n>> //Dr. Patra is speaking from an observation room.//\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** Stromm! Good lord, let the kid go a little. \n> \n> **Stromm:** I don't appreciate being slapped, Cleo.\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** Me neither, but don't kill him. I really would have to report you and probably get Ethics involved. Just send him back.\n> \n> **Stromm:** Fuck. Fine.\n> \n>> //PoI-6647 is escorted out of the room by site security. Dr. Patra enters the interview room. Stromm reaches for the recorder.//\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** No, let it roll for a moment.\n> \n>> //Dr. Patra sits in the interviewee chair, across from Agent Stromm.//\n> \n> **Stromm:** So.. who's the M.O.M.?\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** We don't know much, honest. They're magicians, best as we can determine.\n> \n> **Stromm:** Okay? Why isn't thaumaturgy in here yet then?\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** Different kind of magic. Like.. like street magic, but real. Pulling rabbits out of top hats and the like. They use odd, jerry-rigged thaumaturgy that we don't understand to cheat some bigger tricks, but in general, it's some new kind of thing. \n> \n> **Stromm:** Not sure I'm following.\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** Well.. his handcuffs, for example. He didn't flip a little secret lever or pull a key from his pocket. He just got out of them. Didn't pick the lock, didn't pry them off. It's the trick of a street magician, but it's not a trick.\n> \n> **Stromm:** And you know all this because..?\n> \n> **Dr. Patra:** ..I can't say until the O's get back to me. If you ever come into contact with someone like him again, you need to tell me immediately. Anyone from the M.O.M., anyone who performs this sort of magic. Crash kids' birthday parties if you have to.\n> \n> **Stromm:** ..You got it, boss.\n> \n> __**End Log**__\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"► Incident 6647-2\" hide=\"▼ Close Logs\"]]\n> **General Incident Report: 8/2/2022**\n> \n> **Involved Items/Persons:** PoI-6647\n> \n> **Incident Description:** At 2335 hours, security cameras in Detainment Block C recorded PoI-6647 appearing to have a conversation with someone.
