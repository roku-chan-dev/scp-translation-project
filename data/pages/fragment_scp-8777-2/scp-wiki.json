It has an item number and an object class and everything, but only because the system wouldn't let me make a file without them.\n@@ @@\nI don't even know why I'm keeping this record. For posterity, maybe. \n[[=]]\n**[She laughs.]**\n[[/=]]\nLook, you Foundation people probably have records of what happened with SCP-8777. You tried to contain Santa Claus -- were you too professional to notice, or too embarrassed to say? Then you found the reason you couldn't contain Santa, and tried to contain that instead.\n@@ @@\nYou succeeded.\n@@ @@\nI'm outside of Site-147. It has been, I think, almost fourteen hours since Project KI was activated. I can hear yelling, inside. A lot of yelling.\n@@ @@\nThe Noosphere is gone. There are tatters, here and there, remnants of human thought and the thoughts of animals as well, long buried beneath the sheer volume of human experience. This, I think, is what the Noosphere used to be, before globalization, before nations, before writing, before language. Disparate. Disconnected.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"bigbox\"]]\n**Transcript 8777.01 -- AUDIO LOG 13.05.2016**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Samira Hsu:** Last week, the United States of America collapsed. It was, I think, running on inertia, up until then. People held meetings, because that's what they'd always done. They went to Congress, ran court cases, //governed//, because it was what they'd always done. But I guess the inertia just wasn't enough, anymore. How long can you run a nation that nobody believes in? Not long, it turns out.\n@@ @@\nThe organizations in the shadows -- the Bookburners, the Foundation, the Hand, even -- they collapsed almost immediately after KI was activated. They were, all of them, less real. Less concrete. Ideas held only in the minds of a select few. \nMe, on the other hand? I'm an idea held only in my own mind. I am the definition of an echo chamber. I'm talking to myself. Nobody will ever hear this, or they will and they'll understand none of it. \n@@ @@\nI'm going to -- \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"bigbox\"]]\n**Transcript 8777.02 -- AUDIO LOG 19.08.2016**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Samira Hsu:** Pellen-Vine Noospheric Traps work like a central vacuum system. They suck something up, and it goes through a bunch of pipes until it's deposited in a chamber. All of the Foundation's Noospheric traps are linked to the same place: Site-@<&omega;>@, built entirely in the Noosphere. The //idea// of a Foundation site, its limits so sharply delineated it becomes solid ideaspace, a rock jutting from the swirling eddies of thought. The holding place for anomalous ideas.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"bigbox\"]]\n**Transcript 8777.03 -- AUDIO LOG 25.08.2016**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Samira Hsu:** There aren't any real figures, obviously. Nobody is gathering data. But I've made some estimates. The global economy collapsed a while back, not long after the United States went. The effects of famine are just now starting to set in, and when the scales settle seven billion people will be dead.\n@@ @@\nWe've been subsisting on a sort of barter system, until now, but what do you barter with when food is infinitely more valuable than anything else?\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"bigbox\"]]\n**Transcript 8777.04 -- AUDIO LOG 31.08.2016**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n**Emery Isleton:**  --  any food?\n@@ @@\n**Samira Hsu:** //Emery.//\n@@ @@\n**Emery Isleton:** I'm not talking to you unless you give me that loaf of bread.\n@@ @@\n**Samira Hsu:** We were friends, once.\n@@ @@\n**Emery Isleton:** I remember thinking that, too.

I hadn't noticed. I don't know why. It's left behind its old shell, like a body after the soul has fled. The corpse hangs in the sky, bare stone and reflected sunlight.

I wish I hadn't. The entire city sits under a fog of corpse-stench and misery. Famine claimed half of the population, until cannibalism evened the scales, temporarily. Then the plagues came.\n@@ @@\nStill survivors wander the city, feeding on the flesh of the dead, using the ruins as shelter. It's easier than living in the wilderness. They form bands, splintering and reforming over the course of a day or a week. There's nothing to hold them together except expedience.\n@@ @@\nIn some places, corpses are piled head-high. Food stores. The dead hold no horror for them.

All the work that the Foundation did to make it independent from the Noosphere paid off. When KI shattered the Noosphere, some things stuck with Site-@<&omega;>@, clinging to its shining ideatic walls. \n@@ @@\nThat's where the Moon's gone -- not Earth's satellite, but the //Moon//: the sun-counterpart, the light in the darkness, the silver sign of the hunt, the monarch of tides and wolves.
