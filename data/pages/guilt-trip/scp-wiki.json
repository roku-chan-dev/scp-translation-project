The Tau-1 soldiers pointed their rifles at the towering monstrosity twitching and glitching through the concrete wall; the [[span class=\"shadow\"]]Specter[[/span]] pointed his pistols at it, cape billowing in a nonexistent breeze; Rainer and Dr. Dan pointedly ignored it, and Lucretia favoured it with a withering glare.\n\nAgent Carlotta Deneb, in the lead, merely examined it as she approached with catlike tread.\n\nShe'd once heard that Renaissance architects had played with forced perspective, tapering their buildings outward gradually so that instead of seeming smaller at the top than they were at ground level, they maintained the same apparent size and shape throughout. She was seeing the principle play out now in front of her: every inch of the stretching, oozing, groaning monstrosity seemed close enough to touch, looming mere millimetres rather than several metres above her. It was heaving, deforming, its pale white skin shuddering in its prison of plaster and rebar. A few metres from the front desk she noticed the waterfall of particulate matter tumbling to the floor, concrete abraded into dust by the only occasionally corporeal form of the half-sleeping Unclean. She placed a hand over her mouth and nose as she passed the desk; she didn't want to breathe in anything the creature had touched, and she didn't want to scream.\n\nJust before she stepped beneath it, its featureless head tilted back and a long, thin line of orange drool poured out of a sudden mouth to splash on the filthy tiles beside her. She looked back at the team, following single-file, and shared a wide-eyed look of disgust and fear with Rainer.\n\nEmbracing the absurdity of the situation, she gave him a big thumbs up. He shook his head silently as he, too, walked beneath the living portrait of insanity which dominated the atrium.\n\nShe looked up at it again. The white skin was actually translucent; she could see shapes moving around beneath, bulges shifting in disharmony with the more regular distentions she'd come to think of as the monster breathing. She'd seen something like it before, only once. A hostage situation gone bad, the hostages dead for days, and under their skin the—\n\n//Left foot,// she thought furiously. //Right foot.
