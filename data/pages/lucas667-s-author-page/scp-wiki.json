I have been into SCPs and creepypastas since my teenage, although I've not read them much during the last 5 or 6 years. Bizarre and weird stuff has always fascinated me (--because I'm a weirdo--), and I especially love Series 1 articles, probably because they were simpler but still had a different feeling of mystery that nowadays just isn't the same imo (not complaining here, I also like several articles from the other series, but Series 1 definitely remain as my favorite for now).\n\nMaybe it's just because those articles are part of my past, from the times I used to believe these anomalous things could //maybe// be real and they legit used to scare me, as I was reading random translated versions of them within random brazilian creepypasta websites. My favorite one? Most likely [[[SCP-035]]]. I don't have a specific reason why, but that mask just fascinates me a lot lol. Also, I have to admit that I enjoy simple concepts and shorter SCPs more than long and too complex ones. I think that's mainly because my general knowledge of things is pretty limited. Besides reading and now writing SCPs, here are some other things I like --to waste my time with:--\n\n* **Animes** (Especially One Piece and Bleach. I also really love the manga Kingdom. I even used to work as a curator for the One Piece Amino community, you can easily find me there just searching for the username \"Lucas\".)\n \n* **Music** (I especially like j-rock, rock, and metal, but I also enjoy some more popular artists, like for example Rihanna, Avril Lavigne, and Alan Walker. Favorite band is easily Dir en grey, definitely check them out! They're criminally underrated. Here is one of my favorite songs by them: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8ofitxZM7c Rinkaku]. Other bands I like a lot are: Asian Kung-Fu Generation, X Japan, One OK Rock, Babymetal, Linkin Park, Evanescence, Tool, Poets of the Fall and many more.)\n\n* **Gaming** (Especially old games. My favorite game is Tibia, an MMORPG made in 1997 that is kinda popular in my country.)\n\n* **Movies** (Favorite movie is probably The Godfather 2, it's truly a masterpiece!)\n\nOh and yeah, I was almost forgetting but I'm also the founder of the current Foundation's [http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com Lusophone Branch], and although I haven't been very active over there recently, I am happy that I was able to be part of its creation, and its current active members are doing an incredible job!\n \nSo yeah, that's all for now, but maybe I will add more things here in the future. Hope you enjoyed learning a little bit more about me!\n\n------\n\nI think I already wrote too much about myself here, so below I will leave the --small-- list of my articles. Please read them if you haven't yet and let me know your thoughts in their comment sections! Also, feel free to PM me if you want to tell or ask me anything, as you probably won't see me often in the chats. Thanks for reading and have a nice day!\n\n**My Pages:**\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Lucas667\" order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Article Name ||~ Rating ||~ Votes||~ Comments ||~ Last Comment ||~ Last Edit ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || +[[#expr (%%rating%%+((%%rating_votes%%-%%rating%%)/2))]], -[[#expr ((%%rating_votes%%-%%rating%%)/2)]] || %%comments%% || %%commented_at%% || %%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\nAs you guys can see, all of my articles have a relatively low rating, --so my main goal here currently is to write one that gets to at least +50!-- (Never gonna happen tbh.)\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
