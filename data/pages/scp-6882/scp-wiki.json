All attempts from the Foundation at preventing the general public from interacting with the anomaly have been disregarded. Effective immediately, the Veil has been officially breached.\n\nAutomated systems are to indefinitely continue containment operations during the cessation and eventual extinction of the human race.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-6882 describes the series of events that occurred on March 22, 2022.:\n* **12:05 P.M.:** The sky momentarily flashes white for 4.023 seconds. This event occurs worldwide, quickly causing widespread panic and concern amongst the general public.\n* **12:07 P.M.:** All emergency services are quickly overwhelmed by the sudden influx of calls and requests for aid. All Foundation Sites are placed under Response Code Red-Orange and begin standard de-escalation protocols.\n* **12:08 P.M.:** Internet activity surges to record levels. Live streaming services including Tik Tok, Instagram, and Facebook experience outages and are quickly made unavailable. Most Foundation attempts to log footage are automatically flagged and later deleted due to anomalous influences. As of 12:20, only one file remains viewable:\n= **##red|{{[COGNITOHAZARD REMOVED]}}**##\n* **12:20 P.M.:** Afterward, all SCP-6882 entities slowly ascend upwards beyond view.\n* **12:21 P.M.:** Surveillance systems observe the human population collectively migrating to coasts throughout the world. They remain silent as relocation occurs.\n* **12:22 - 5:56 P.M.:** The human population reaches their destinations at varying times throughout the day. As they approach, they enter the water, soon overpopulating coasts across the planet.\n* **6:00 P.M.:** Foundation systems report a drastic drop of the population from 7.9 billion to 1.2 million, which continues throughout the subsequent week.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ ADDENDUM 6882.1\n+++ {{TRANMISSIONS WITH FSS-AG (FOUNDATION SPACE SYSTEM-ALPHA GAMMA)}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Click to Access\" hide=\"Hide Addendum\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-22-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 13:30 PM EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: ALL SITES\n\nALERT FROM NEAR-ORBIT OBSRVATION\nNOTING STRANGE LUMINOSITY GLARE\nHAS ACTION BEEN TAKEN?\nAWAITING CURRENT ORDERS FROM\nOVRWTCH\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-22-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 18:30 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: ALL SITES\n\nPLEASE ADVISE\nRADIO SILENCE?\nAWAITING CURRENT ORDERS FROM\nOVRWTCH\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke white\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-22-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 18:56 EST\n| IP: 212.44.██.███\n| FROM: SITE-110\n| TO: FSS-TERM 12\n\nEMERGENCY BRDCST ACKNOWLEDGED\nEARTH IN DANGER \nSITE HAS BEEN PLACED UNDER LCKDWN\nUNABLE TO CONTCT OVERWATCH\nSTILL TRYING\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 07:44 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: SITE-110\n\nACKNOWLEDGED\nABNORMAL ENERGY INCREASE \nBENEATH THE SURFACE DETECTED\nUNABLE TO LOCATE SOURCE\nHOW ARE U STILL HERE?\nPLZ IDENTIFY\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke white\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 08:19 EST\n| IP: 212.44.██.███\n| FROM: SITE-110\n| TO: FSS-TERM 12\n\nI AM RESEARCHER RAINER\nALONGSIDE OTHERS \nUNSURE OF HOW WE SURVIVED\nTESTING NEW EXPERIMENTAL TECH \nJUST BEFORE \nPOSSIBLY MISSED EVENT?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 08:54 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: SITE-110\n\nACKNOWLEDGED\nSCANNERS REPORTING MASSIVE DECREASE OF LIFE\nREMAIN CALM - STAY UNDER LOCKDOWN\nATTEMPTING TO EXTRACT YOU\nNO LUCK WITH OVERWATCH\nHOW LONG CAN YOU SURVIVE?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke white\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 09:20 EST\n| IP: 212.44.██.███\n| FROM: SITE-110\n| TO: FSS-TERM 12\n\nUNSURE\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 12:00 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: SITE-110\n\nACKNOWLEDGED\nDETECTING SOME MOVEMENT\nALONG THE COASTS\nUNSURE OF SOURCE - CANNOT CONFIRM\nHAVE ALSO DISCOVERED POSSIBLE\nMETHOD OF TRAVEL TO FSS AT A SITE\nNEAR YOUR LOCATION\nSENDING RELEVANT DATA NOW\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 03-23-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 12:44 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: SITE-110\n\nWE SEE MOVEMENT NEAR YOUR LOCATION\nASSUMING YOU HAVE RECEIVED\nCOORDS?

Upon connecting with the station, programs reported that the satellite had been severely led off-course, and had been moving away from Earth for several days prior to insertion. An extensive analysis of the station systems reported severe structural deficiencies and several breaches throughout the facility. Further investigation reported an absence of Foundation personnel anywhere within the area.\n\nContinued analysis revealed the following message, intended to be received by all active Foundation Sites, but failed to send due to the satellites changed trajectory:\n\n[[div class=\"danke black\"]]\n| FEED ID: 4782381432\n| DATE: 04-02-2022\n| TUR (TIME-UNTIL-RECEIVED): 12:30 EST\n| IP: 145.97.███.██\n| FROM: FSS-TERM 12\n| TO: ALL SITES\n\nSOS\nFSS SUPPLIES RUNNING LOW\nNO CONTACT WITH EARTH\nSOME CREW ALREADY LOST\nSOME CHOSE TO GO\nPLZ RESPOND \n\nI DO NOT WANT TO DIE LIKE THIS\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n~~~~~~\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6881]]] | SCP-6882 | [[[SCP-6883]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
