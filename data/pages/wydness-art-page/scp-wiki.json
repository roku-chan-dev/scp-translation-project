I've finally decided to make an art page after... what, a year? I'll be slowly updating this over time. Regrettably I don't draw as much as I used to, but whenever I make something that I feel is worthy, you'll see it here immediately. I don't take requests as they cause me a lot of stress, but if you want me to draw something for your SCP/tale/etc., leave me a message and I'd be happy to discuss it.\n\n-------------------\n\n**Traditional Artwork:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-049-J\" hide=\"poke poke poke\"]]\n[[image 049-J.png width=\"300px\"]]\n-\nI quickly sketched this the day after the sequel to BS&F came out since 049-J was on everyone's mind. I always imagined him as looking more fabric than something biological.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n—\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-354\" hide=\"This one is weird to think about\"]]\n[[image SCP_354.jpg width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nI made this back for the 10th Anniversary contest in August of 2017. It was my attempt to depict some of the the various creatures that emerged from the red pool. I don't think it was ever accepted... I couldn't tell you why. I made this during a phase in which I liked to make massive colored pencil illustrations; some of the techniques are very outdated but people have told me they still like it.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-2521 World Concept\" hide=\"///////\"]]\n[[image 2521_world_background.jpg width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nI made this for a project that never went far. It was a background image of the place that SCP-2521 takes things looks like.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-------------------\n\n**Digital Artwork:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-049 (Experimental)\" hide=\"I love you Jade\"]]\n[[image 049_sketch.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nI made this based off a little sketch that [[*user Gabriel Jade]] made of 049 on his phone. (I kept begging him). It was pretty abstract so I did my best to interpret it.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n—\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-049\" hide=\"I love him\"]]\n[[image 049_Final.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nThis is my drawing of 049 for that coloring book I won't shut up about. It's honestly a bit edgier than I normally draw him but I figured it's what people would like. I'm getting closer to figuring out how I want him to look... closer...\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-527\" hide=\"Glub glub\"]]\n[[image 527_Final.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nAnother drawing for the coloring book, this one of SCP-527. I'm actually really proud of this. It's probably my first time drawing someone in a suit halfway decently, and the composition turned out really nicely in my opinion.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-2006\" hide=\"I love 2006 bless you weizhong\"]]\n[[image 2006_Final.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nOne final drawing for the coloring book unless I decide to post any more here. This is... probably the drawing I've been happiest with in a long time. It was a lot of fun trying to make terrible B-movie monster designs while putting some personality into the drawing.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-4910\" hide=\"Teeth\"]]\n[[image 4910_Final.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nYeah of course 2006 wasn't going to be my last upload. Have a tooth monster.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n—\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-682 Body Pillow (NSFW-ish)\" hide=\"fuck\"]]\n[[image 682_body_pillow.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nYou probably thought this was a joke, didn't you? Or maybe, at least, you hoped it was. But no, here it is in all its redacted glory. I made this upon [[*user Andre Bechert]]'s request. (Also, if you want the uncensored version of this, you can absolutely hit me up on Discord.)\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Dr. Cimmerian x SCP-2913 (NSFW-ish)\" hide=\"THIS IS SO WEIRD\"]]\n[[image file.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nThis is so weird wtf was I thinking\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-------------------\n\n**Physical Media:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-999 Phone Cases\" hide=\":3\"]]\n[[image 999_phone_cases.jpg width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nI made these as an experiment with decoden. Apparently they make people really hungry.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n \n[[collapsible show=\"Wondertainment Ribbon\" hide=\"Bless this GOI\"]]\n[[image image0.jpg width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nThis was made entirely by hand, no machines involved. I'm hoping to cosplay as Dr. Wondertainment one day.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-------------------\n\n**Things I made for other people:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Cack Hard Movie Poster\" hide=\"I don't have Photoshop\"]]\n[[image cack_hard_poster.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nThis is another thing I made for [[*user Gabriel Jade]]. He wanted a movie poster of the [[[cack-hard|first tale in the \"Cack Hard\" series.]]] The picture of the crumbling building in the background is my own, and all other images used in the edit are CC-compliant.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Corneliu\" hide=\"Sarkic turkey meat rain\"]]\n[[image Corneliu.png width=\"400px\"]]\n-\nOk, so this was actually a brick I painted for my first SCP, [[[scp-3581|3581]]] but I felt it would be more appropriate here (and I'm going to make a proper portrait of Corneliu eventually). Did my best to make this look like an old painting with fading colors.\n-\n[[/collapsible]]",
