Sigma-10 is the new visual theme for the SCP Wiki which brings to the forefront new body and header fonts as well as an improved SVG logo!\n\nThe body font and SVG logo were looked upon as general accessibility and quality-of-life adjustments and were met with little disagreement. The header font was another matter.\n\nInitially, there was a concern that the old //Bauhaus// font for the header may not have been compatible with the site licensing. Due to this, some of the initial framings of the proposed changes were based on this matter. Further discussion cast doubt on that original concern and the Tech team decided to propose the change from //Bauhaus// to the //Sans Normalcy// font on an aesthetic basis as opposed to licensing one. The staff team voted and accepted the new change.\n\nWe also have a survey we'd like you to take regarding the new theme!
