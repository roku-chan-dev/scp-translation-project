Since the beginning of the Foundation, there have been uncountable theories as to how anomalies are generated, yet no consensus has ever been established on their originator. Given the rate of anomaly generation and the facilities available to the Foundation for containment, in 2033 it was discovered the unsecured anomaly population had outstripped the Foundation's ability for effective containment for the past five years. Throughout the course of 2034, the O5 Council created and commissioned the Supervisory Committee for Preservation to conduct an exhaustive organization-wide study with Site Directors, Containment Specialists, and whatever. blahblahbhlabhalbahlalbhalhb\n\nWhen the results were released in early 2035, an intensive review by the O5 council decisively concluded that the mission to secure, contain, and protect was not and had not been the best method of maintaining normalcy for some time. By a 10-3 vote of the O5 Council, it was declared that the Foundation's mission to secure, contain, and protect was untenable given the inexplicable and ceaseless generation of anomalies. The Foundation's mission would immediately change to stopping anomaly origination and propagation. Hence the 2035 Foundation Finite Initiative, FFI.\n\nThe FFI authorized the use of copious amounts of Foundation funding to be diverted from containment procedures and into the research and development of promising methods to curtail anomaly generation and to fund whatever two bit shit idea any fuckface with dollar signs for eyes looking for a quick cashout\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nHello world.\n.\nThis phrase ends with a comma, this phrase ends with a period.

I don't know how they've been alive so long. There were maybe eighty or ninety of them. Men, women, children, all in tatters, all skin and bone, trudging through the scorched muddy earth to nowhere but all still with full, genuine smiles. An anomaly I didn't recognize... had to be one of the ones that escaped when... the thing was immense, almost the size of the crowd, a massive ball of raw pink flesh, made of too many eyes, and mouths, and, and teeth, everything in the wrong place... scuttled towards them on way, way too many human arms. It opened a mouth the size of half its body. Every single person used their last moments of life to turn towards the horror, smile, and raise their arms high above their heads in unison, like it was bathing them in warm sunlight.\n.\nIt turned them into chunks.\n.\nSome of them had time to scream for a moment before they were churned.\n.\nWhen... there were no more people and the thing was munching the sand for scraps, fifty or sixty of the eyes on its back whipped around to stare at me when I threw up. I tried to be quiet. It froze like an insect, watching me. I'd rather die any other way, any other way than be eaten by that thing. I can't die screaming.\n.\nBut it just stared at me.

I said I'd write the description today and I don't want to be a liar.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8997 denotes both The Cheswick Gadget (TCG) and the area of influence it generates. When any anomaly of any description is exposed to the area of influence, the anomaly would be permanently neutralized. This had a 100% success rate.\n\nImmediately after the first test on SCP-682 proved the field's efficacy, the Foundation's primary focus shifted from culling anomaly generation to submitting as many anomalies to SCP-8997 as quickly as possible. As the success rate continued to be proven by every single test, all skepticism or resistance to widespread implementation vanished. The device's design was just as miraculous. Cheap to manufacture, fits in a pocket. It became standard issue for all personnel. There's thousands of them all over the world.\n\nThe world was so beautiful. All the laughs came easy. The air was so thick with relief you could get drunk off it. Everyone wore full, genuine smiles. You wouldn't believe the sun could shine so bright. I've never seen such beautiful sunsets, not even in a dream.\n\nWe all had dreams.\n\nI was on the team that developed the thing, and I didn't get how it worked. By any metric, it was too good to be true, but there was so much proof it was infinitely efficacious. The brilliant Dr Cheswick had discovered a way for the device to be powered off gamma brain waves with remarkable efficiency. No wires needed, simply place the device near a living human and poof, no more anomalies. Then Dr Cheswick let me in on the little secret. It couldn't bend reality. It couldn't bend a paperclip. All it did was show anyone within the field the world as they want it to be. This extended to any organism with the capacity for self-awareness. Down in this site's basement, I've seen rats starve. They chew the air for days.\n\nIts field of influence grew the more people believed it. I know he didn't expect that. Every scientist conducting a test looked at their instruments and saw exactly the reading they wanted to see, and the field caught people for miles around, then dozens of miles and then hundreds. Adherence to containment procedures evaporated. Everyone horrifically killed by a containment breach was perceived to have retired from the Foundation to pursue their dreams as the Foundation gradually and contentedly became obsolete. There were a lot of retirements really fast.\n\nLike everyone else, I was walking through my days in my perfect little world where everything was exactly what we hoped it would be, now that we'd gotten rid of all those pesky anomalies that were causing all the problems. The sun shining bright forever.\n\nMaybe it was because Dr Cheswick told me it didn't work, and I couldn't totally convince myself otherwise. Maybe there was only so much I could believe. Maybe it was Emily retiring and several dots couldn't help but be connected. My whole facade fell apart and reality rushed in. It's just as well. I kept wondering why in the delusion people I didn't know kept coming up to me and promising me forgiveness.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI like this little transcriber a lot. You have no idea how hard it was to get some of these things working. Getting this to tell the difference between commas and periods was brutal. I gave up on getting it to always know the difference between names and words like Smith the job and smith the name and programmed it to take cues from the speaker. I can print a new line if I say\n\nlike that, which tells the transcriber that wasn't dialogue and to print a new line. And it doesn't leave a mark. It does a similar thing with colons, if I say: it prints a colon. Since I do have technically finite supplies down here, I adjusted it so it only prints a fresh line if it's left on for a full twenty four hours, instead of thirty seconds like it was. It still prints that fucking dot if it doesn't record anything for that set period, but whatever. I couldn't make this thing perfect, even if a delusion told me I did. But I got close, and had fun making it. And then it was adopted all around the Foundation and I was so proud of that and got a promotion and added to a research team... I still have to turn it off and on again for the settings to save, but it helps. It helps me. Printing a dot if there's twenty four hours of silence instead of thirty seconds. That'll save the world.\n.\n.\nI'm putting off talking about what I saw today. Because it went like this.\n\nWoke up. Lived through SCP-8997 a bit. Worked on its description. Then I crawled out of the site basement turned bunker to the outside. I like the balcony above the main site entrance. I can see it all and nothing cares enough to try and come up here. Got a pair of binoculars. I can't see any greenery through them. There's not even corpses anymore, and there were a lot of corpses early on. There's still meat and rot and... blood and... didn't see the thing with the eyes. I know I haven't talked about it on the transcriber, but there was so much shit out here. I don't know how the Foundation kept everything contained for so long. It's all out there. Mostly somewhere else. Like there's a portion of the sky missing. Don't look at it.\n.\nYou would not believe the quiet.\n\nI saw some signs of life, nothing I wanted to get close to or think about. Then sometime around noon I saw two people, alive and well, holding hands, smiling like young lovers. They approached for a long time, casually strolling forward, through shit and blood and mud, bones cracking under bleeding feet. They watched the deadlocked door to the bunker for a bit, and sighed in unison. I tried to get their attention, waving, yelling, throwing down rocks, but I wasn't in their world. One of them had some broken fingers.\n\nThey turned and looked at each other, holding and caressing each other's faces like they were going to kiss each other for a long time. A really long time. Hours. Until the sun started to set. Once it hit the horizon, they turned and watched it set. Stared directly into the sun until it was gone. It was a nice sunset.\n.\n.\n.\nThen one of them laid on the ground. The other straddled them. Without changing those pure expressions of love they wore, without blinking, they put their hands on each other's throats and squeezed. Their faces turned blue, then purple, then black. The one on the ground lying in dried blood, I saw the leg kick, kick, twitch. The one on top didn't move. Just smiled.\n.\nI really tried to save them. I ran down, tried to break through the entrance I'd fortified. I could hear one of them gurgling. Broke through and I really tried to pull them off each other. I really fucking tried. I tried.

Whatever, it's not like anyone can judge me for it. Apart from myself. It's not like anyone who matters can judge me for it.\n\nUh... I was going through Dr Cheswick's notes before bed last night. And I fell asleep without any ideas. I woke up with one though. I had a dream again. A new one. Listen.\n\nI was lying on my back on some gentle green grass, in a backyard with an immaculate wooden fence. It was the kind of place I'm so sure I knew and loved and formed my fondest memories at, that there's no way it ever existed. It had a feeling of family, like a place I would've known when I was a kid and felt safe. And there was... the most glorious sunset. The kind where there's just the right amount of clouds streaked across the sky, and layered just so, you can see the colors fade from blue to purple to a magnificent bold violet pink. I watched the colors swirl and shift, and I knew there was nothing I needed to worry about, nothing in the world I needed to do but experience that and love the feelings it gave me. I feel the most beautiful peace I've ever known coursing through me, like thrumming music in my bones.\n\nSuddenly my face pops up above me. I don't say anything but it punches me out of the moment. I have to get up and chase myself away. He walks slower than I do but moves away faster and he doesn't leave me alone. Me trying to chase me away, back and forth, just out of my reach, until my copy exits through a break in the fence and I finally shout after me, \"WHO CARES IF IT'S A DREAM, THE FEELINGS ARE REAL.\"\n\nMy self vanishes and I look back at the sunset. It's still there, but it's not what it was. Before I decide how to feel, I wake up.\n\nFigure that one out.\n\nThe sunset was like the one in Dr Cheswick's picture. I'll tape it here. If I look at the back of it, I see what he wrote but I can't see the sunset. I look at the sunset and for a moment I don't care about forgiveness.

It will miss you.\n\n**Development:** SCP-8997 exists because of you, and there's no changing that.\n\n**Final Addendum:**\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n.\n.\n.\n.\nIt did take a while but I've decided to start trying. I could die a comfortable death down here. No screams or fear. That would be nice. And that would be my life. If Dr Cheswick wandered outside of that tiny office at almost any point, he would have ran into me, and then maybe things would've been better. But he's dead now, by his own hand. There's no changing that. I wonder if... him being so close to the gadget kept it powered. He wrecked the world but he didn't mean to. I know that's no comfort to the dead but it's a comfort to me. I buried him yesterday, in a proper grave.\n\nI went outside to remind myself why I should stay inside. We all had dreams. So I'm leaving. Going to walk until I die, if I have to. See if there's somewhere on the world that's unaffected. And if not and the whole world is covered, maybe I can, I don't know, snap someone else out of it somehow. I don't know. I wasn't as smart as I needed to be. I wasn't as brave as I should've been. And now... that's all unchangeable. I’d like to come back... if I come back that has to be a good sign, it means... I feel like the people in my family are always promising they'll come back, and it was, like, only once in a generation do they actually keep that promise. Figure that one out.\n\nBut I'll die either way. Outside I can get some air. Maybe I'll see a nice sunset. Try to help someone somewhere. I know there's the thing with the eyes out there, but I don't care. I think I'd rather die screaming than not trying.\n\nSCP-8997, in the last iteration, ended with \"Final Addendum\". I don't know what that means, but I'll write it here before I go. I'm not ready, but who is? I don't want to die, but who does? I can see the world as it is now, horrors and beauty and all.\n\nIf I die out there, then all that will happen is you'll print for months and paper will pile up on the floor. Or you'll run out of ink. It's not like that's a problem. It will be nice to know that something I did is still doing what I want it to do.\n\nThank you for listening to me. You are my greatest accomplishment. I love you.\n[[collapsible show=\"Final Addendum:\" hide=\".\"]]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .75\"]]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n[[/div]]\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .5\"]]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n[[/div]]\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .25\"]]\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\nHey.
