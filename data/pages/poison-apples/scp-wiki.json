But somehow Lisa telling me to be 1st made the bus killed him. This sounds crazy, and I think I AM going crazy, but I'm sure I'm the cause. Why would a bus just go straight to the pavement?

Those guys in suits seem to be searching for me. Okay, from the start. Yesterday, as I walked down on the street, a woman I didn't recognize whispered something in my ear. I don't think it was English. But immediately after, I ran straight home, and I don't remember after. I woke up just before watching my house in ruins. The kitchen room seemed to be undamaged, for some reason. A squad of women in suits was writing in notebooks near me. One looked up in my direction, and I ran away. I don't see the point though. I killed a person, and my home is gone. \nAnd it's all my fault.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
