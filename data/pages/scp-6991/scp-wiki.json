Newly formed entrances are to be covered up by dispersing information about recent volcanic and tectonic activity or archeological findings. Additionally, avalanches, landslides, or other natural disasters may be staged to make this information more trustworthy and to stop fauna from leaving SCP-6991. Personnel is prohibited from entering SCP-6991 without the approval of three site directors managing a site adjacent to the anomaly.\n\nCheckpoints on nearby roads are to prevent civilians from entering perimeters. Amnestics may be forcefully administered if individuals refuse to cooperate.\n\nOptions for large scale safety precautions and containment are currently being researched by the Department of Geology.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6991 refers to the hollow interior of the Andes mountains, located in South America, containing a biosphere hosting unique biomes. Most notably, the anomaly contains flora and remnants of fauna that were publicly known as extinct, unknown, or fictional.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Llullaillaco.jpg|caption=The Llullaillaco|align=right]]\n**Discovery:** On 05/06/2004, Guillem Vargas, a hiker from Copiapó, Chile, went missing on a trip to the Llullaillaco.[[footnote]]An active stratovolcano on the border of Chile and Argentina with an altitude of circa 6700 meters.[[/footnote]] Since it is not uncommon to set up camp in the area, his disappearance went unnoticed for two weeks. Three days after local authorities began searching, a hole of 50 meters deep not present on any maps was found with rope leading down.\n\nAll public servants were administered amnestics and bureaucratically transferred to other investigation teams. After retrieving the corpse of Guillem Vargas, a camp was set up around the hole for later exploration under the disguise of a research site for geologists and volcanologists.\n\n**Addendum-1:** Autopsy report\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **Autopsy Report**\n[[/=]]\n**Deceased:** Guillem Ester Leonor Vargas\n\n**Identification by:** Photographic comparison, dental records\n----\n**Age:** 28⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Length:** 174,2 cm\n**Sex:** Male ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Weight:** 72,4 kg\n**Nationality:** Chilean\n----\n+++ **Contents on body**\n* Red T-shirt, green fleece vest, and beige wind-resistant jacket.

Strong resemblance to insect or arachnid hunt and eating patterns.\n----\n+++ **Summary**\nDeceased suffered from exposure to acidic liquid and/or acidic fumes, piercing wounds, and amputation from its lower body[[footnote]]Not necessarily in the given order[[/footnote]] which led to heavy blood loss.\n----\n+++ **Cause of death**\nExsanguination\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum-2:** Further exploration\n[[include component:image-block name=Grot.jpg|caption=The chamber marked by MTF Zeta-9.|align=right|width=350px]]\n\nOn 08/07/2004, [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#zeta-9 MTF Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\"] started further exploration of the cavern. After 3 days of spelunking, they marked a chamber with a lake as a possible base camp location and returned for better equipment and provisions.\n\nAfter returning, Zeta-9 mapped down the halls in vicinity of the chamber with echolocation. One hallway's dimensions could not be measured by an amplified signal. Zeta-9 decided to maneuver towards it. 10 squad members stayed in the marked chamber to analyze surroundings and set up camp. The other 10 squad members went on the exploration mission. Logs available below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log, [12/07/2004 03:55]>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** This is commander Zeta-9-1 speaking. Starting operation in five minutes.

Suggestion for Zeta-9-6 to come to the front and make a rubbing.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** I thought you scouts could do that yourself? Any reason why you need assistance of six?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Six has a degree in archaeology and I don't know what I'm looking at. I guess it's a feathered velociraptor or something but if I make a rubbing of something this old the original might not be recognizable anymore. Identifying this thing is pretty neat should we stumble upon it.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Zeta-9-6 get to the front, take some images, and make a rubbing. See if you have any idea what it resembles.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Roger that.\n\n//Several minutes pass.//\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Zeta-9-6 here, I think this is a drawing of an Austroraptor or another species in the Dromaeosauridae family. They were native to South America in the Cretaceous period. I can't give more detailed information without consulting more sources.\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** So we'll have to watch out for dinosaur offspring?\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** I wouldn't really be worried about possible offspring.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Six, please explain why not.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Austroraptors are slightly bigger than your average man. We can take those things down with ease in these narrow halls.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Good, send us the rubbing so we can continue in standard formation.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Understood.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Utahraptor.jpg|caption=Rubbing sent by Zeta-9-6.|align=center]]\n\n**Zeta-9-4:** Well, that's a pretty beast.

Samples of the soil and vegetation were taken and a topographical map was drawn. Echolocation of the surroundings was unsuccessful due to the size of the cavern. Upon walking the perimeter, Zeta-9-3 found a pit with the remains of several unknown species.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log, [12/07/2004 20:13]>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** Nine-Three here, I found a pit with bones. Requesting assistance of Nine-Six.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Zeta-9-6 here, Do you have a slight idea which species you are looking at?\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** I'm pretty sure our dinosaur friend is present here. Aside from that ancient bastard, I'm seeing giant snakes and other animals I can't make out what they are supposed to be.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Is this a pit like a well or a lower area?\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** It's kinda like a dumping ground. We can get there by foot. It's pretty accessible if you ask me.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Okay, I'll be on my way.\n\n[[=]]\n**<End Log, [12/07/2004 20:15]>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nZeta-9-3 and -6 documented their findings. After further communication with the base camp and back to local sites, the species of the animals were identified. Zeta-9-6 commented on how all remains seemingly had been touched by acid or an acidic component which origin could not be determined just as the predator responsible for the carcasses.\n⠀\n[[table style=\"border: 0px solid silver\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #cccccc\"]]\nDesignation\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #cccccc\"]]\nDescription\n[[/hcell]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid silver; background-color: #cccccc\"]]\nDetermined species\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; border-bottom: 1px solid silver\"]]\n[[=]]\nSCP-6991-1\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0px solid silver; border-bottom: 1px solid silver\"]]\nCarnivorous, bipedal, theropod dinosaur.

After confirming they had not, they were tasked to explore further the next morning.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log, [14/07/2004 07:56]>**\n[[/=]]\n**Zeta-9-1:** Ok, so now that everyone is present, we'll go over the operation one final time. I assume no one has objections?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Good, Eight and Ten, you will descend first from the eastern side cliff and continuously measure the air quality. Standard protocol, gas mask nearby, don't hesitate to equip it. There is enough forest here so I doubt we'll get toxic fumes in our faces like in other operations. Everyone with me so far?\n\n**Zeta-9:** Yes, commander.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Great, after that we will all rappel down except for Zeta-9-2 and 9-7 who will observe and map down everything from above. Zeta-9-5 will be responsible for the mapping on the ground once we're descended. How far do you think we can map the ground today?\n\n**Zeta-9-5:** Our current map is pretty detailed so I think I can do about fifty or sixty percent of what we cover today if you want it in great detail. I can do everything with standard markers if we take breaks and the surroundings don't have natural barriers like streams and quicksand. I am mainly counting on foresty hills.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Well then, let's get started.\n\n//Twenty minutes of content omitted for brevity.//\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** Ready for descend. 9-10, are you ready?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Affirmative, starting descend.\n\n//Several minutes omitted for brevity.

Eight, how are you doing?\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** Even though we are high in terms of altitude, I'm not experiencing negative effects in terms of oxygen supply. I might follow Ten's example later but for now I think this gives us good estimates.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Understood, keep us informed about your situation.\n\n//Zeta-9-8 and -10 are lowered until they reach the clouds.//\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** Okay, we are going into the clouds, visibility will go down. Will keep you updated on our range of vision. I'm not having trouble breathing but the air seems more intense.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Please elaborate on what you mean with intense.\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** I don't know how to put it. Something feels a bit off and it is not the humidity as far as I know.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Nine-Ten, are you having the same effect with your mask on?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Yes, I am. My filter indicator hasn't changed colors so it isn't asbestos or other harmful components as in other operations but I can't put my finger on it either.\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** It's like we are not completely fading through the clouds. As if they are embracing us very slightly.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Analyze the quality again. We'll adjust the tempo of the descent.\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** Affirma- Wait.\n\n//The chirping stops. Flocks of birds and winged snakes can be seen flying away.//\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Is there a problem?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Wait a minute, Eight are you also-\n\n**Zeta-9-8:** Hold up! I'm- W-What is this?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** We're not going down anymore.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Hold on, did you just say-\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** Commander, the ropes aren't tight anymore but we aren't even halfway on the estimated distance of the descent. We can't pull them up either.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Are you still immobilized? Any update on your status?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Commander... I don't think these are clouds... These are webs.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** How did you come to that conclusion?\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Commander... We can see the spiders coming.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Zeta-9-10:** Commander, my gas mask has a camera.

In these tight hallways, the curves and elevation difference should be enough coverage to protect us from flying debris. I would watch out for stalactites but we should seal the entrance rather fast. I hear tickling legs in the distance.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Zeta-9-6, you're at the front with 9-2, right? Can you see any stalactites?\n\n**Zeta-9-2:** Nine-two here, Six is just behind me. The nearest stalactites are about 300 meters ahead.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Good, Zeta-9-3, feel free to detonate.\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** Roger that.\n\n//An explosion can be heard followed by falling rubble and screeching.//\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** You ok?\n\n**Zeta-9-3:** //Sighs.// I'm fine.

I can only send encrypted data to them.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Anything else?\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** Most of the explosives are missing and the hallway to the surface is sealed. I'm afraid we have become collateral. They probably sealed the surface as well.\n\n**Zeta-9-4:** So what is the plan now? Face the spiders guns blazing until we run out of ammo?\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** We are going to upload our cam footage, gather the remaining explosives, and force our way back to the surface. We'll show them what Zeta-9, //the// underground Mobile Task Force is made of. We may be buried, but we ain't dead just yet.\n\n**Zeta-9-6:** So, what do we do when the spiders come out?\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** Well, this chamber has way more stalactites than the hall we just left. Shoot the ceiling and make it rain.\n\n**Zeta-9-2:** Commander, that in combination with the explosives will make the chamber collapse.\n\n**Zeta-9-1:** That's what I am counting on. If we don't succeed, they won't either.\n[[=]]\n**<End Log, [14/07/2004 21:36]>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\nOn the night from 14/07/2004 to 15/07/2004, an underground collapse caused the conduit of the Llullaillaco to widen which caused the volcano to become active again.
