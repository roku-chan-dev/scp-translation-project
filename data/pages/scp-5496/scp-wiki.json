Any staff found utilizing SCP-5496 in any way, unless explicitly authorized otherwise, are subject to immediate debriefing and possible disciplinary action. Should any anomalous activity characteristic of likely SCP-5496 usage be observed by staff, it should be immediately reported to their superiors, Site-43 administration, and/or members of the SCP-5496 research team.[[footnote]] Witnesses should prioritize who to report based primarily on whoever can be most promptly alerted among any of these groups.[[/footnote]] \n\nNo feasible methods of long-term physical containment are currently known, due to factors such as SCP-5496’s penchant for spontaneous translocation to other locations around the site if it becomes sufficiently obstructed from access by members of site staff; its super-durability against all forms of material damage tested so far; and the inability to maintain visual warnings or messages advising against use within the vicinity of SCP-5496 itself. As such, current containment tactics primarily center on recurring instruction to all on-site staff of the properties and dangers posed by SCP-5496.[[footnote]]However, any potentially workable methods to better contain SCP-5496 remain the subject of ongoing research and testing; as reflected by the Truculent Sub-Class designation, which signifies that the anomaly is fundamentally unpredictable, with containment continuously adapted to an ever-changing set of circumstances.[[/footnote]] Individual personnel of sufficient clearance may submit containment and testing proposals for review.\n\nWhile this file has been given a default clearance level of **Three** (lvl 3/5496) for all other sites and posts, all Site-43 employees have been given special provisional level 1/5496 clearance to view the bulk of this file. All such employees are to read this file at least once in its entirety, and to be proactively apprised of any significant updates as necessary. Additionally, --monthly-- weekly reminders are to be given to all Site-43 staff that **any complaints, issues, or suggestions relating to perceived issues with some aspect of their workplace environment are to be directed through the appropriate channels via Hiring and Regulation; and that there is not now, nor has there ever been, any sort of officially sanctioned Site “Suggestion Box.”**\n\n**Description:** SCP-5496 is a small box found affixed to various walls from all around the interior of Site-43 since its sudden appearance on February 12, 2022, with the words “Suggestion Box” prominently displayed across the front, and a smaller inscription written on its right side: \n> Hello, Foundation staff! Here at Site-43, we strive to push boundaries and incorporate novel and non-traditional strategies in our perpetual mission of Securing, Containing, and Protecting anomalies from the world and the world from anomalies. However, there's always room for improvements, so we'd like to hear your ideas, fellow Foundationers!

These requests vary in their ultimate utility to the triggering user, providing them with some overall benefit at least as often as any detriment. At the same time, particular effects almost invariably detract from broader Site-43 operational efficiency, capacity, and/or security.[[footnote]]See Addendum 5496.01 for examples and further detail.[[/footnote]] \n\nSCP-5496 itself is made of an unknown, extremely durable material visually reminiscent of rusted metal. Small pencils and slips of paper are also present next to a horizontal opening at the top.[[footnote]]Though displaying no anomalous properties in themselves, SCP-5496 will anomalously generate new pencils and slips of paper to replace those taken.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5496 was unwittingly “discovered\" and utilized by a number of staff over a three-day period. Specifically, it was used by staff who did not initially recognize its anomalous properties or a potential connection to the recent major increase in the number of on-site accidents, technical failures, and maintenance issues. Most staff outside of either the Quantum Supermechanics or physically adjacent Research and Experimentation sections, including those in Hiring and Regulation and administrative positions, remained initially unaware of the appearances of SCP-5496. \n\nIt wasn't until the morning of February 14, 2022, that any staff members directly noted the apparent anomalous results which followed submissions to SCP-5496.   Dr. Xinyi Du, Chair of Quantum Supermechanics, reported the appearance of SCP-5496-1 and his team's suspicions of its anomalous nature. A video log is available below;\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ View Video Log ■\" hide=\"□ Close Log □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Foreword:** The following log was taken from Section 5a break room security camera footage.\n-----\n**<Begin Log>** \n\n//Jr. Researchers Mindy Wright and Thad Cameron are seated at a table discussing a popular television show as Dr. Xinyi Du enters the room.//\n\n**Du:** Hey guys.\n\n//Wright and Cameron both wave and continue their discussion as Du makes his way to the refrigerator.

Yeah, I mean the note kind of explains it. I don’t know when they put it up though. \n\n**Cameron:** I think it was the day before yesterday.\n\n**Du:** This seems kind of odd to me. Doesn’t really seem like the Foundation’s style… \n\n**Cameron:** What do you mean?\n\n**Du:** C’mon, in what universe would the Foundation base its internal conflict management on soliciting complaints and suggestions via a little box in the break room… Was there an email, or, uh, some kind of notice about this?\n\n**Wright:** Not that I know of, but maybe it wasn’t a big enough deal to bother.\n\n**Du:** Are you kidding? They send out notices about everything, no matter how small. Besides, there’s already a sophisticated system in place for submitting things like grievances and proposing workplace changes on the Intranet. Honestly, I’m not sure this should even be here…\n\n//Around this time, Junior researcher Joel Davenport enters the breakroom, and presumably overhearing the conversation in progress, elects to provide his own opinion as he pulls a slip and a pencil from SCP-5496.//\n\n**Davenport:** Oh Dr. Du, you’re always so cynical. I, for one, think the box is a neat little way to solicit feedback from us little worker ants.\n\n**Wright:** What are you writing now?\n\n**Davenport:** Oh, just to turn up the heat in the QS labs a bit.

Though agents profess remembering their experiences and mindset afterward, they also report variations of unshakeable nihilism, and almost universally indicate that nothing that’s said to them in that state would likely shake them.\n----\n**Additional Notes:** The recurring effect proved immune to amnestics, hypnotherapy, targeted memetic agents, etc. until Dir.

This apparently exceeded SCP-5496’s obstruction threshold, as the instance translocated immediately after. After moving the plant back and noticing the absence of SCP-5496, the employee alerted his superiors, and search for its new location began. \n\nFor two days, despite intensive search, the object could not be located, until Dr. Eileen Vaskaar of the Identity and Cryptotechnography Department reported that SCP-5496’s new location had been determined (further information on its rediscovery is restricted to Level 5 clearance due to its inherent information security concerns). \n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ LEVEL 5496/5 ACCESS ONLY ■\" hide=\"□ ACCESS GRANTED □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\nSCP-5496 was discovered to have translocated to Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W, the location where [[[SCP-5520]]] is currently stationed and effectively contained while continuing to conduct largely self-directed research related to various anomalous phenomena. \n\nSubsequent correspondence with SCP-5520 indicates that SCP-5520 was and remains unaware of the exact anomalous nature of SCP-5496. Relevant Correspondence with I&T Junior Researcher Paris Gibson is included below:\n\n[[div class=\"note\"]]\n**[13/03/2022]**\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n**Hello, I would like to inquire about my request from yesterday, specifically as to whether I actually made it, and if so, whether anyone received it.**\n[[/div]]\n\n**Res.

Gibson sent off the last message. The exact nature of how SCP-5520’s submission would be fulfilled remained unclear until the following day.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nShortly after its rediscovery and the intentional triggering of SCP-5496's translocation property, it was quickly identified to have moved to Security and Containment Area 4b in the first sublevel of Site-43, where it currently remains. \n\nAt 4:34 PM on March 14, 2022, an unrequested allotment of eight D-Class Personnel arrived at Site-43.[[footnote]]Site-43 does not utilize D-class Personnel in its research or operations, nor does even it have the infrastructure or logistical capacity to do so.[[/footnote]] Despite this, available records confirmed the request for and approval of this D-Class allotment, and its redirection from the original destination of Provisional Site-███\n\nThe anomalously redirected D-Class were moved to a more securable area within the topmost sublevel, while a quickly organized internal investigation traced the modification of the D-Class request and destitnation records to shortly after SCP-5496's March 11 relocation event.\n\nFour site security officers led the D-class to their ad-hoc, temporary housing area that was arranged to hold them until their situation was straightened out internally, and the D-class once again transported to a new site. Unfortunately, neither security staff nor those particular members in Hiring and Regulation that had been placed in charge of arranging accommodations had yet been alerted to SCP-5496’s current location, and allowed the new D-Class to enter into the same hall in which the object now resided. \n\nDuring this time, one of the D-Class was later observed via security footage to have made two submissions to SCP-5496, which are outlined below along with their respective effects. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ D-Class Submissions ■\" hide=\"□ Close Log □\"hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**User:** D-40110\n-----\n**Request:** Tell us what the [ILLEGIBLE]lly goin on i[ILLEGIBLE]hole!\n-----\n**Result:** After depositing the suggestion slip, D-40110 appeared to take on an unfocused stare, eventually nodding as if listening to someone or something.

D-04576 was observes to loudly exclaim a string of profanities upon noticing the disappearance of the other D-Class personnel, mostly directed at the now absent D-40110.[[/footnote]]\n-----\n**Additional Notes:** Other anomalous results considered possible depending on the unknown contents of D-40110’s second submission were prepared for, including the sudden appearance of [REDACTED], but no other potential anomalous results from this event have been identified at this time. \n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAs the accompanying internal security agents were all conversing amongst one another across the room at this time (with none actually facing the D-class they were ostensibly guarding), they failed to directly witness the event. The only in-person witness was Dr. William Wettle, who had somehow gotten lost again on the way back to his office after lunch.[[footnote]]This has been a somewhat regularly recurring pattern over Dr. Wettle's almost-three decades stationed at Site-43. Of note, both his office and the dining commons are located on a completely different level of the site than the one he stumbled into in the midst of this anomalous event.[[/footnote]] Dr. Wettle reported wondering into the hall and seeing \"ten D-class just disappear out of thin air\".[[footnote]]Dr. Wettle has a well-documented habit of poor counting skills.[[/footnote]] causing him to jump back and trip over a stray chair in shock, leading to a twisted ankle and fractured hip. \n\nDebriefing took place from his medical bed, but was ultimately deemed of minimal value upon confirmation of much more reliable video footage capturing the event. Dr. Wettle has since made a full though slow-going recovery from his injuries, with only modest-to-moderate complications.\n\nD-04576 was successfully relocated from Site-43 on March 15, 2022, where he remained prior to his expiration on March 18, 2022 as a natural result of his assigned research duties his new Site. The rest of the D-Class contingent's current whereabouts remain unknown at this time. Foundation efforts since the incident at identifying and recapturing these individuals, who are now considered to have effectively escaped Foundation custody, have failed up to this point. Attempts at discovering any evidence of any additional anomalous effects related to their disappearance, or the exact wording and/or nature of the triggering SCP-5496 submission, are ongoing.\n \n-----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5495]]] | SCP-5496 | [[[SCP-5497]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Suggestion Box.JPG\n> **Author:** Beyond Access Initiative\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 2.0 (CC BY-SA 2.0)\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/beyondaccessinitiative/8699232934/]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
