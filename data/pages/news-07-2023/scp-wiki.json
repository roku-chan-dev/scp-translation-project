Well, there was another announced, though this one was for the INT branch of the SCP Wiki. This contest, named [[[lorecon2023|The Mighty Lore and Aesthetics Contest]]], aims to take pieces of lore from all over the SCP universe and combine them with aesthetics in order to create a very specific kind of article.\n\nFor example, one might get the aesthetic 'Byzantine' and the piece of lore 'Wilson's Wildlife Solutions', which would require the author to write an article with a Byzantine aesthetic in which WWS also plays a major part in. Seems like a challenge, no? But that's the point of a contest! The posting period hasn't started yet (it opens on the 10th of July), but if you'd like to see who has what, you can head on over to [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/lorecon2023 the contest's page on the INT wiki!]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Features Last Month\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Top Articles of the Month\n[[/=]]\n\nRatings of course do not mean everything, but they are representative of what people happened to like seeing at the time.
