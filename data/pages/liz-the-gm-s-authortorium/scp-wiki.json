To tantalize your senses, tickle your funny bones, make you gasp in surprise and wheeze in delight!  Which, I am led to understand, is definitely a thing you wheeze in.\n\nWhat's that?  You say I seem familiar but you're sure you've seen my various scribblings listed under a different name?  Well don't you worry, you're not going mad, it's just that my dead, old name has been erased from existence so that my new self could be born anew!\n\nBut you're not here for any of that ol' nonsense, are ya?  You're here for the //good stuff//, I know, I know, and here it is!\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Articles and Tales in Order of Publication]]\n**[[[SCP-3147]]]:** Tongue Twisted\n**[[[SCP-3369]]]:** A Living Joke (co-authored with [[*user Aleph-Null]])\n**[[[SCP-3408]]]:** Welcome to Site-3408\n**[[[SCP-3053]]]:** Off the Rails\n**[[[Liz The GM's Proposal | SCP-001]]]:** A Simple Toymaker\n**[[[SCP-3284]]]:** Uncontainable\n**[[[Unstoppable]]]**\n**[[[SCP-6084]]]:** Dr. Wondertainment's Acoustically Astounding Air Band™\n**[[[SCP-5463]]]:** New-Fangled Contraption\n**[[[Document 3284/04C Draft]]]**\n**[[[Freakuency Overture | Freakuency]]]**\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Articles in Numerical Order]]\n**[[[Liz The GM's Proposal | SCP-001]]]:** A Simple Toymaker\n**[[[SCP-3053]]]:** Off the Rails\n**[[[SCP-3147]]]:** Tongue Twisted\n**[[[SCP-3284]]]:** Uncontainable\n**[[[SCP-3369]]]:** A Living Joke (co-authored with [[*user Aleph-Null]])\n**[[[SCP-3408]]]:** Welcome to Site-3408\n**[[[SCP-5463]]]:** New-Fangled Contraption\n**[[[SCP-6084]]]:** Dr. Wondertainment's Acoustically Astounding Air Band™\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Just the Tales]]\n**[[[Unstoppable]]]**\n**[[[Document 3284/04C Draft]]]**\n**[[[Freakuency Overture | Freakuency]]]**\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n-----\nWhat's that you say?
