Item is humanoid and possesses canid anatomical features such as; head resembling that of a coyote or jackal, a tail, short black fur covering its entire body, and claws. \n\nAge of the Item is unknown. Identity is suspected but not confirmed yet.\n\nItem is largely unresponsive to external stimuli. Since its containment, the Item has spent all of his time in a state similar to hibernation or suspended animation. It is not dead however.\n\n**Detail of current containment:** Item requires minimal containment measures. A normal sized room guarded by two security officers is sufficient to contain the entity.\n\n**Report:** Item was inherited to the Foundation by the Inner Africa Expeditionary Society. According to documentation belonging to the Society, the Item was found during an expedition into the Pyramids of Giza and recovered in the same state as it currently is in now.\n\nOutside of its appearance, the Item shows few abnormal properties. Item does not seem to age. Item does not seem to have physiological needs, and if it does, it does not need to satisfy them as it has made no attempt to eat or drink the food given to it by staff. \n\n**Appendix:** The current location of the Item is temporary. It is to be moved to ROAECC27 when construction of that facility is finalized.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-7638-MOD]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 125%]]**Item #:** SCP-7638[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[[size 125%]]###952b00|**Level 3/7638**##[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 125%]]**Object Class:** Neutralized[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[[size 125%]]###952b00|**__Classified__**##[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The remains of SCP-7638 are stored in the Low Security Artifact Storage section of Reliquary Area-27.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-base name=Skull|caption=SCP-7638's skull.|width=300px|align=right]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7638 was the deific entity known as Anubis, a zoomorphic deity belonging to the Egyptian pantheon whose worship began around 3100 BC and ended in the 530s AD. \n\nSCP-7638 was believed to have been a Class-III Reality-Bending entity and a skilled thaumaturge at its prime. However, this cannot be adequately verified due to its status as a Neutralized anomaly.\n\nSCP-7638 was first discovered and contained by the Inner Africa Expeditionary Society (IAES), a Foundation precursor organization that was dedicated to the containment of anomalous artifacts and entities within the African continent, particularly in British colonies of the time.\n\nSCP-7638, along with all other anomalies contained by the IAES, came into the possession of the Foundation on September 7th, 1901, following the dissolution and merger of the Society with 12 other anomalous management organizations which resulted in the formation of the modern-day SCP Foundation.\n\n**Addendum-01:** On 02/12/1908, one week following its transferral to Reliquary Area-27,[[footnote]]Formerly known as Religious Object And Entity Containment Complex 27.[[/footnote]] SCP-7638 awoke suddenly from its hibernation and a series of interviews were conducted with it by ex-director Vivianne August.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Open Interview Log 1908/04/12.\" hide=\"[-] Close Log.\"]]\n[[div class=\"tact\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++* {{__INTERVIEW LOG.__}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n{{**__DATE:__** 04/12/1908}}\n\n{{**__INTERVIEWED:__** SCP-7638}}\n\n{{**__INTERVIEWER:__** Director Vivianne August}}\n----\n= {{**<Beginning of Log, 09:06>**}}\n\n{{**Director August:** [In Egyptian] H-Hello, Am… am I speaking to—}}\n\n{{[Director August is cut off by SCP-7638.]}}\n\n{{**SCP-7638:** [In English] I appreciate the effort, but it is better not to speak a language you do not fully grasp.}} \n\n{{**Director August:** Oh, you can— [She clears her throat.] Right, right, of course.

There is very little difference between true immortality and this!}}\n\n{{**O5-11:** But there is, and I was very clear.
