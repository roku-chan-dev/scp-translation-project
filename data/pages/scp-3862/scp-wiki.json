This bacterial manifestation is highly resistant to all commonly known antimicrobial therapies, and is considered biologically immortal. It is to be noted that SCP-3862-Σ only becomes active when both strains are present.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n+++ **Attached Addenda**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Discovery**\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:image-block name=palace.jpg|caption=The Palace of the Marqueses of Abrantes, c. 2013|width=300px]]\nSCP-3862 was first acquired by the Foundation in 1952, during the renovation of the Palace of Santos, the former seat of the House Abrantes, and the current French Embassy in Lisbon, Portugal. While the palace had been used for some time by the French government as a de-facto Embassy, it was formally acquired by France in 1909, and  by 1951 it was in need of major renovation to update the internal facilities as well as repair to several structural elements.\n\nIt was during this renovation that the first hidden entrance to a small \"chapel\" was discovered in what had once been the bedchamber of the Marquesa Eleanore Lancastre e Tavora. Upon further investigation, an additional hidden entrance and hallway was discovered that connected the \"chapel\" to a guest bedroom now believed to have been occupied by a member of the French diplomatic mission to Portugal, Ser Lucien Dutoit. \n\nVery little was documented about the initial discovery of this \"chapel\" and its contents. The workers and staff assigned to the renovation of that area were all exposed to the pathogenic contagion associated with SCP-3862 and quickly succumbed to rapid-onset bacterial infection. Due to the anomalous attributes associated with this disease and the contents of the chapel itself, the Foundation was alerted by assets embedded in the consulate staff, and the Embassy was immediately placed under quarantine. \n\nIt is unclear how the initial outbreak was contained. Many of the Foundation personnel assigned to the acquisition of SCP-3862 were also exposed to SCP-3862-Σ and subsequently expired. Not knowing the extent of contamination, successor personnel destroyed all the reports and research material originally associated with SCP-3862. While this was apparently successful in containing the outbreak of SCP-3862-Σ, the majority of the information surrounding the acquisition of SCP-3862 and the location wherein it was found was lost.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Additional Research**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 3862.doc.01 - Memo to Site Director ■\" hide=\"□ 3862.doc.01 - Memo to Site Director □\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**SCPF Internal Memorandum**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**FROM:** Dr. Jaime Forrester\n**TO:** Site Director Andreas Götz\n**DATE:** 2013/02/12\n**RE:** Request to commence study of SCP-3862 & related objects\n----\nGiven Dr. Judith Low's recent report on the increase in both [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub Proto- and Neo-Sarkic] activities, we need to re-evaluate our stance on the study of SCP-3862. The articles in question are clearly Sarkic in origin, and the study of their nature may shed additional light on the activities of any number of the European Neo-Sarkic cults during the Victorian era. \n\nAs of now, we know precious little about the ambitions and goals of the Neo-Sarkic GoI. As their influence in both the anomalous and non-anomalous world grows, it becomes increasingly incumbent upon the Foundation to not only learn as much as we possibly can, but also to devise ways to blunt the impact of whatever it is they are planning. \n\nI believe that the information contained within the letters from someone who was obviously a high-ranking member in Neo-Sarkic society at the time will shed some light on the genesis of whatever their current ambitions might be. Remember, the Karcists all think incredibly long-term. Their ability to become effectively immortal gives them both patience and the drive to create and achieve very far-reaching goals. As of now, we don't even have a clue what those might be, and we need to do whatever we can to ensure that their impact on normalcy is as minimal as possible.\n\nPlease see my attached proposal for reopening research into SCP-3862.

The official purpose of the regency was due to her age at the time of ascension, and all official records state that his regency was continued after her majority due to her poor health. João Maria was never officially confirmed as the 8th Marquesa, though most official records state his title as such regardless.\n\nIt is now believed that Eleanore's actual confirmation as the 8th Marquesa was suppressed primarily as a result of the scandal surrounding her relationship with the disgraced French nobleman Lucien Dutoit. It is interesting to note, however, that she is mentioned in numerous non-official accounts as having once been quite the socialite. At one point, it was rumored that her uncle was in negotiations to have her married to Lord Aberdeen, a prominent member of the British peerage, though this never came to fruition. Regardless, official documents seem to contradict these accounts, claiming instead that she was a recluse and remained so due to her poor health. \n\nWhat is known, through the letters found in SCP-3862-A, is that the Marquesa traveled to England in May of 1851, and it was there that she met Lucien Dutoit at a social event held to celebrate the birthday of Queen Victoria.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 3862-A.doc.01 - Letter from Lucien Dutoit ■\" hide=\"□ 3862-A.doc.01 - Letter from Lucien Dutoit □\"]]\n[[div class=\"lucien\"]]\n[[>]]\nMay 19, 1851\n[[/>]]\nEleanore,\n@@ @@\nIt is with the utmost excitement, indeed that I must express my joy at having had the true pleasure of meeting such an esteemed and yet alluring lady such as yourself.

All mention of him was expunged from French diplomatic records at the request of the Portuguese government. It is this very lack of available information that suggests that the identity of \"Lucien Dutoit  //née Thiers//\" is just one of many such personas assumed by this individual.\n\nWhat is known, and has been confirmed through various outside sources, is that Dutoit is the identity used by the Karcist of the Neo-Sarkic cult Société de la Fleur Sanglante (Society of the Bloody Flower). It is believed that Dutoit is the nom de guerre assumed by the Karcist after the fall of the July Monarchy in 1848. \n\nOur understanding as to why Dutoit was positioned at the British court via the French diplomatic corps is purely conjecture. Through his letters, we can assume that he was attempting to gain leverage amongst the British aristocracy in a hope to shift his flagging power base in France and either his attempts to do so were blocked by an unknown outside entity, or he simply found that shifting to Portugal was a much more appetizing prospect.\n\nEither way, the Société did make the move to Portugal, and Dutoit utilized his connection with the Marquesa to secure a French diplomatic residency at the Palace of Santos. It is unclear how much of that delegation was made up of members of his Société, but the impact of Dutoit's shifting to Lisbon did ultimately result in the Palace of Santos eventually becoming the permanent French Embassy in Portugal.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 3862-A.doc.23 - Letter from Lucien Dutoit ■\" hide=\"□ 3862-A.doc.23 - Letter from Lucien Dutoit □\"]]\n[[div class=\"lucien\"]]\n[[>]]\nJune 17, 1852\n[[/>]]\nEleanore,\n@@ @@\nThese past few months have flown by in a flurry of your letters.

Furthermore, it represents the use of pre-existing bone structure (primarily taken from the thoracic cage).[[footnote]]Principally the ribs, sternum, clavicles[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**SCP-3862 Final Report**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n**FROM:** Site Director Andreas Götz\n**TO:** O5-█; O5-█; Jonathon DeCroix, Director, Ethics Committee\n**DATE:** 2015/04/03\n**RE:** SCP-3862 Final Report \n----\nIt is with a fair amount of personal regret that I must inform you of the passing of Dr. Jaime Forrester. While the results of his research have forwarded our understanding of Neo-Sarkicism, I am uncertain if the loss of such a brilliant researcher is commiserate with the information gained.\n\nWhile such losses are often inevitable in the work that we have sworn ourselves to, it is still something that we strive to prevent wherever possible. In this instance, it was my decision to allow reopening the research into SCP-3862 that ultimately led to Dr. Forrester's untimely and rather grisly end.\n\nNonetheless, we now know that the entity known as \"Lucien Dutoit\" may still be at large and represents a significantly greater threat than we originally realized. Dr. Low's insistence that Ion was not the likely creator of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-610 SCP-610] has been confirmed, and in a way that is truly terrifying for us all. Who knows how many of the horrific pathogens that have been released upon the world have been the result of Dutoit's meddling? \n\nThe Flesh that Hates has the same lethality to everyone, regardless of status, and murdering everyone doesn't fit with Ion's reported desire to free the oppressed. The Historical department has always more-or-less agreed that Ion was generally too benevolent, in his own way, to have created and released a disease like that purely for vengeance. \n\nThe possibility of someone else being the architect of 610 has always been a theory, but absent a smoking gun, it has remained just a theory. I believe that this is that smoking gun.\n\nAttached, please find a transcription of Dr. Forrester's final experiment with SCP-3862. May dissemination of this information bring forth a result that can assuage my guilt.\n\nAndreas Götz\nSite Director, Site-54\n[[collapsible show=\"■ 3862.doc.08 - Transcript ■\" hide=\"□ 3862.doc.08 - Transcript □\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=table.jpg|caption=SCP-3862-C file photo|width=275px]]\n\n**Date:**  2015/03/12 @ 13:22\n**Researcher:** Dr. Jaime Forrester\n**Research Objects:** SCP-3862-A, -B, -C\n**Foreword:** //Dr. Forrester was approved to conduct a single experiment involving all SCP-3862 objects. Strict biological contamination procedures were put into place, and Dr. Forrester conducted the experiment while inside a Class 4 positive pressure biohazard suit. The containment vessels for all three SCP-3862 objects were placed inside Sterile Room Beta, and Dr. Forrester entered the sterile field alone, with Dr. Golzar observing.//\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[Dr. Forrester enters the airlock for SR-Beta and proceeds to dress in his protective suit.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** Mic check. This is Dr. Jaime Forrester, sometime shortly after 1pm, March 12.\n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Reading you loud and clear, Jaime. You sure you want to do this?\n\n//[Dr. Forrester finishes final checks on his suit seals and gives a thumbs up to the camera]// \n\n**Dr. Forrester:** I have my reservations but, needs must. It is important to gauge exactly how virulent the Sigma pathogen actually is, and you know my opinion on using the D-class for stuff like this. \n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Fair enough. I'm starting the cycle now, you know the drill.\n\n//[The light above the inner door shifts to amber, then shifts to green and Dr. Forrester opens it to step through into the testing chamber. The SCP-3862-A & -B containment lockers are situated on a large steel table in the center of the room, with the SCP-3862-C containment locker beside it. Dr. Forrester proceeds to the table and begins the procedure to open -C]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** Let's get right to it. Taking the table out first. //[short pause]// Even after looking at these things as often as I have, I gotta admit that opening them all together is a bit of a rush. \n\n**Dr. Golzar:** It is exciting, that's for sure. Just... be careful. \n\n//[Dr. Forrester looks up at the camera and grins through the clear shield.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** 'course.\n\n//[He proceeds to remove -C from its locker and sets it out to the side. Over the next few minutes, he retrieves -A and -B and sets them both on top of -C.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** You know, aside from the whole Sigma pathogen thing, these things are exquisitely made. Hard to believe that they're just bone and hair. //[He gently caresses the surface of -C]// Even monsters can have feelings. //[He pauses again, then looks up at the camera, his hands still resting on the surface of -C]// I think that Lucien really did care about the Marquesa. \n\n**Dr. Golzar:** We've been over this. Dutoit wasn't human anymore. He was only using her to get what he wanted.\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** //[shaking his head]// Sure, he had an ulterior motive. But why would he make -B for her, out of his own ribs? That had to have been painful as hell. And the attention to detail? It had to have taken hours, carefully growing each element.\n\n//[He steps to the side and picks up SCP-3862-B, turning it over in his hands]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** Even if it is bone, this represents a level of craftsmanship that-\n\n//[He suddenly drops -B the few inches to the table, and clutches at his right glove.]//\n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Jaime. Jaime! What's going on?\n\n//[Dr. Forrester turns away from the camera, shaking his head and staring at his right hand.]//\n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Jaime, answer please. I'm a heartbeat away from dousing that room with the aerosol, fucking-\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** //[Interrupting, quietly]// No, Samira. Don't do that. These gloves are over two centimeters thick. How...?\n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Damnit, Jaime. I'm pulling the plug on this. Get out of there now.\n\n//[Dr. Forrester shakes his head and turns back to the camera, holding up his hand. In the center of his palm is a long sliver of bone, piercing directly through the glove.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** Too late, Samira. You know how nasty Sigma is. I can't risk contaminating the rest of the lab. //[He laughs.]// Well, I guess we'll see how fast it works now. //[He coughs wetly and pauses for a moment.]// Pretty damn fast, I'd say.\n\n//[He pulls off both gloves, then proceeds to remove his helmet, instantly deflating the pressure in his suit. He draws a deep breath and looks up at the camera, a bit of bloody froth at the corner of his mouth.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** It's been a pleasure working with you, Samira. I want you to know that. \n\n//[Dr. Forrester proceeds to conclude the test schedule on the SCP-3862 objects. In the process, he also collects multiple tissue samples from himself, as well as culture samples of the SCP-3862-Σ pathogen itself.//\n\n//Over the course of the next 62 minutes, he is shown to experience the symptoms of rapid-onset necrotizing fasciitis.[[footnote]]Commonly known as flesh-eating disease, is an infection that results in the death of parts of the body's soft tissue. Symptoms include red or purple skin in the affected area, severe pain, fever, and vomiting.[[/footnote]] At 48 minutes, he is no longer capable of conducting the experiment due to the loss of a majority of the tissue on his right arm. He sits down with his back against SCP-3862-C.]//\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** You know, Samira? //[He is interrupted by a violent coughing fit, and he spits a mass of something wet onto the floor beside him.]// I think I figured something out, in all of this.\n\n**Dr. Golzar:** Yeah, Jaime?\n\n**Dr. Forrester:** We always- //[cough]// We always wondered what happened to Eleanore... and Lucien's baby. I...\n\n//[He is caught by another coughing fit, and afterwards appears to be incapable of speech. He reaches around behind his head and retrieves one of the sealed petri dishes containing one of the SCP-3862-Σ pathogen samples from atop SCP-3862-C. He looks up at the camera and taps urgently on the dish with the exposed bone of his left index finger.]//\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:**\n\n//At this point, Dr. Forrester laid down on the floor, where he expired 12 minutes later. A post-mortem examination of the room and the SCP-3862-B object revealed no obvious damage or origin point for the sliver that pierced Dr. Forrester's glove. This object has been catalogued as SCP-3862-B2, and has been secured along with -B.//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 85%]]Act I: //Et Ecce Equus Pallidus// | [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/memoria-adytum In Memoria, Adytum][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3861]]] | SCP-3862 | [[[SCP-3863]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n**Image 1**\n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/22956445@N04/39610221594 flickr]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Title:** santospalace.jpg\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/sinava/ Naval S]\n> **Release year:** 2018\n\n**Image 2**\n> **Source:** [https://twitter.com/sone_suraas/status/1407255559171035142 Niram]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Title:** Lucien.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user niram]]\n> **Release year:** 2021\n\n**Image 3**\n> **Source:** [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/10532 The Met]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Title:** eleanore.jpg\n> **Author:** John Singleton Copley\n> **Release year:** 1765\n\n**Image 4**\n> **Source:** [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/8268 The Met]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Title:** thebox.jpg\n> **Author:** unknown, made in England\n> **Release year:** 1762-63\n\n**Image 5**\n> **Source:** [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/7351 The Met]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Title:** thebox.jpg\n> **Author:** unknown, made in England\n> **Release year:** 1750-70\n\n**Image 6**\n> **Source:** [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/198982 The Met]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Title:** table.jpg\n> **Author:** unknown, Spanish\n> **Release year:** 17th century\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
