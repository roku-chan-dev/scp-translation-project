All attempts to perceive the true appearance of SCP-7308 have been unsuccessful. \n\n@@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ \n@@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ \n@@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ @@@@ \n**Addendum:**\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Discovery\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-7308 was discovered in Poplar Grove, Illinois after reports of an \"orb\" wandering a local apple orchard. Following the capture of SCP-7308, Gate B of Site-309 was blasted down by Soupglop, a known reality bender residing in Three Portlands, demanding that SCP-7308 be returned to her. \n\nAfter fourteen hours of standard de-escalation procedures, Dr. Noah Addams managed to conduct an interview with Soupglop.\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Are you ready to cooperate? Or am I going to have to call in the tranq unit again? \n\n**Soupglop:** Fine. //Fine.// But mark my words, young man, I'm gonna be casting //sooooo// many hexes on you later. I'm gonna... \n\n//Soupglop gestures her hands in the air wildly.//\n\n**Soupglop:** And you're gonna be //SORRY//.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** I... Okay. Well, to start, what //is// SCP-7308? \n\n**Soupglop:** Ha! What is it? It's my INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, that's what it is.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** To be clear, I'm talking about the... red circle thing.\n\n**Soupglop:** Wait, //circle?// I thought I upgraded to the //orb// package! Goddammit. I'm so fucking mad. I suck at contracts. Always using so much //LANGUAGE//. I--\n\n**Dr. Addams:** No-- it's-- you did fine. It's an orb. I just misspoke. Sorry.\n\n**Soupglop:** Huh. How the fuck did you go from orb to circle? There's a whole DIMENSION of difference. I thought you people were supposed to be smart! \n\n**Dr. Addams:** I just misspoke. I'd appreciate moving on now.\n\n**Soupglop:** Peh. Fine.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** So, again. What is SCP-7308, and why can we only perceive it as an orb? \n\n**Soupglop:** You see him like that because you hold //no// shares! Nobody does! Because all the shares are //mine.// I copyrighted him! \n\n**Dr. Addams:** Well... then what do //you// see it as?\n\n**Soupglop:** He's a large man with white fur. He has big muscles. He would be my husband but he's kind of stupid, so I copyrighted him instead. I call him \"Yeti\" and he's one of a kind. That's why Lord Alrights allowed me to finalize the ritual.\n\n**Dr. Addams:** Hm. One moment, please.\n\n//Dr. Addams stands, retrieves a manilla folder, then pushes it towards Soupglop. She begins inspecting its contents.// \n\n**Dr. Addams:** Did you know that [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yeti there] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6453 are] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1529 countless] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000 entities] that are almost identical to your \"Yeti\"? Therefore...\n\n**Soupglop:** Oh... oh no.\n\n//A tear in reality suddenly forms above Soupglop. An eye emerges, staring directly at her.//\n\n\n**UNKNOWN:** SOUPGLOP. YOU HAVE //LIED//, AND BETRAYED LORD ALRIGHTS. FOR THIS YOU WILL BE PUNISHED. \n\n**Soupglop:** Wait, wait, I didn't know! I didn't--\n\n**UNKNOWN:** IGNORANCE IS //NOT// FORGIVEN. PERISH.\n\n//Soupglop disintegrates into a pile of salt, and the tear closes.// \n\n[[=]]\n**<End Log>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the interview, it was discovered that SCP-7308 had disintegrated into a pile of ground black pepper.
