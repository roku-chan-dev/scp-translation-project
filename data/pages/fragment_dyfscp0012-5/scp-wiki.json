Pod A1, O5-1, present.\n> \n> **O5-2:** Stasis pod B1, O5-2. Here.\n> \n> **O5-4:** Pods C1 and D1, O5-4 and my son --\n> \n> **Taggart:** Can we get Taco Bell?\n> \n> **O5-4:** GODDAMN IT, TAGGY, WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS! TACO BELL IS EXTINCT!\n> \n> **Taggart:** What's esstink?\n> \n> **O5-4:** IT'S THAT THING THE DINOSAURS ARE! NOW BE QUIET! MOMMY HAS A //FUCKING MEETING!//\n> \n> **O5-2:** Um, should we reconvene at a later --\n> \n> **O5-4:** IT'S A CHILD. YOU'LL //LIVE.// ...Taggy, go play with KK-507 for a while.\n> \n> **Taggart:** I dun' like KK. She's --\n> \n> **KK-507:** //Hello, other real person, are we friends?//\n> \n> //(Taggart runs away screaming.)//\n> \n> **O5-1:** //(Sigh)// Ten, Eleven, Twelve?\n> \n> **O5-10:** Here.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Here.\n> \n> **O5-12:** And, here.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Last, um, our //entire// crew, KK-507?\n> \n> **KK-507:** //(Startled shriek.)// ... I mean, uh, yes, yes, I'm here, my name's KK-507, what kind of music do you like, have you ever heard of Starlight Express?!\n> \n> **O5-1:** Eleven, you're the one who's been talking to her, help me out here...\n> \n> **O5-11:** Kay-Kay wanna play-play?\n> \n> **KK-507:** //Yes! Yes I do!//\n> \n> //(O5-11 picks up a stapler and aims to throw it out an open ground-level window in the cave wall.)//\n> \n> **O5-11:** Catch the stapey, Kay-Kay! //Go deep!//\n> \n> **KK-507:** //Yes, SIR!//\n> \n> //(KK scrambles out the window, running backwards across the courtyard.)//\n> \n> //(O5-11 puts the stapler back down.)//\n> \n> //(The other council members stare at O5-11 in silence.)//\n> \n> **O5-11:** ...oh, come on, the Ethics Committee's extinct.\n> \n> **Taggart:** //(From another room)// Are they at Taco Bell?\n> \n> //(O5-2 stands up and slams her hands on the table.)//\n> \n> **O5-2** Are we going to talk about ##green|**GREEN**##, or would my time be better spent having a long-overdue stroke?!\n> \n> **O5-1:** Ten, the Exploration Team's findings...\n> \n> **O5-10:** Right!  //(Shuffling papers)// Um... the hypothesis that ##green|**GREEN**## is, or at one point //was,// Earth -- that much has been confirmed. However, the sun and moon have been replaced by similar astral bodies of possibly anomalous origin -- which hasn't resulted in any climate or atmospheric changes. Stars match no recorded positions. In addition, there's some ambient noise of apparently extraterrestrial origin. Sound carries over through empty space.\n> \n> **O5-4:** That last point about sound, wasn't that how it was with the //Faraon//?\n> \n> **O5-10:** Well, we never got a visual, but -- now that you mention it, yes.\n> \n> **O5-1:** So our planet could still be in enemy territory.\n> \n> **O5-10:** It's certainly natural enough to fit the bill of ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B terraforming.\n> \n> **O5-12:** How about the team itself - any casualties?\n> \n> **O5-10:** The injuries sustained by two MTF members healed at an anomalous rate, so there's definitely some kind of ambient healing factor.\n> \n> **O5-2:** They ran into ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B?\n> \n> **O5-10:** What? No, they tripped. They haven't enountered //any// ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B. Recon drones haven't picked up any trace of them, either. The only thing that even resembles an ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B is ##indigo|**INDIGO**##, and that thing's dead.\n> \n> **O5-12:** Could you refresh my memory about that last one?\n> \n> **O5-2:** //(Checks a memo)// \"FCP-##indigo|**INDIGO**##, object class Pending, a 3,600-meter-tall arthropod that's currently floating at the L1 Lagrange Point. Displays no signs of life.\"\n> \n> **O5-10:** The only fauna encountered in ##green|**GREEN**## so far have been mundane wildlife such as elk and rabbits. ...needless to say, the gateway's no longer in Antarctica. The robots must have moved it.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Why do I get the feeling you should have brought up the fact that //there are robots// five fucking minutes ago?\n> \n> **O5-2:** That's not a new development. One of them opened the door, remember?\n> \n> **O5-1:** Oh, right, the crash dummies.\n> \n> **O5-10:** They refer to themselves as \"WerkHosses\" -- whatever that means -- claim to serve \"##blue|**THE GODDESS**##,\" and treat humans with bizarre reverence. It's almost like we're royalty. There hasn't been any hostility from the WerkHosses, not even when Squad 6 shot and destroyed three of them.\n> \n> **O5-4:** //Why?//\n> \n> **O5-10:** Perhaps they aren't sentient, or can be easily replaced by their --\n> \n> **O5-4:** No-no-no, why did Squad 6 //attack// them?\n> \n> **O5-10:** They are not clever men.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Well, the way I see it -- if we're going to make any headway into seeing if this planet is viable for colonization, we're going to need to have further negotiation with these WerkHosses.\n> \n> **O5-4:** And apologize for Squad 6.\n> \n> **O5-10:** Then again, wasn't KK-507 terrified of them?\n> \n> **O5-11:** Look, she's clinically --\n> \n> **KK-507:** Hello.\n> \n> //(All council members yelp and back their chairs away.)//\n> \n> **O5-1:** How did you get under the table?!\n> \n> **KK-507:** Quietly.\n> \n> **O5-1:** //WHY did you get under the table?!//\n> \n> **KK-507:** Because this has been my Special Calming Place for the past ten years. What's //your// Special Calming Place? Can we be friends?!\n> \n> //(O5-11 reaches for the stapler to \"throw\" it again. It's missing.)//\n> \n> **O5-11:** Okay, where the hell's my stapler?\n> \n> **KK-507:** I caught the stapey.\n> \n> //(Awkward silence. The sound of teeth gently nibbling on metal and rubber.)//\n> \n> **O5-12:** Requesting permission to change the subj --\n> \n> **O5-1, -2, -4, -10, -11:** //Yes.//\n> \n> **O5-12:** Okay, well, the first thing we're going to need to do is to analyze the healing factor further. I would like to see if someone on the outside is capable of aging. The best way to do this would be to send KK-507 outside for an extended period of time with some guards to observe.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Voting in favor of this.\n> \n> **O5-4:** Seconded.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Thirded with prejudice.\n> \n> **O5-2:** Wait, no, this is asinine! Analyzing the healing factor is one thing, but I can't help but feel that we're trying to implicitly exile her. That would be wrong. I'm aware that she's an abject nuisance, but it's no fault of her own. Besides, lest we forget, KK-507 is the living, breathing reason all of us are still alive, and we owe her dearly.\n> \n> **O5-1:** I mean...\n> \n> **O5-4:** No, Two has a point. Changing my vote.\n> \n> **KK-507:** I can do it if you want!\n> \n> //(O5-10 screams.)//\n> \n> **O5-1:** //Now you're ON the table!//\n> \n> **O5-12:** Well, we //are// out of chairs.\n> \n> //(KK-507 slinks off the table politely.)//\n> \n> **KK-507:** No, really, guys, I can do the thing. Whatever it was. Friends do favors for each other, don't they?! I'll just... just gimme a night to consult with Tracey.\n> \n> **O5-10:** I'll bite. Who the hell is Tracey?\n> \n> **KK-507:** She the creator of all existence. She lives in Burger King.\n> \n> **Taggart:** //(From another room)// Can we get Burger King?\n> \n> //(O5-4 sobs in frustration.)//\n> \n> **O5-12:** How old is Taggart?\n> \n> **O5-4:** Oh, shut up.\n> \n> **O5-2:** He's seven, last time I asked. But if we could return to the matter at --\n> \n> **O5-12:** His rate of aging would be easier to observe.\n> \n> //(Eight seconds of silence.)//\n> \n> **O5-1:** Changing my vote.\n> \n> **05-11:** Ditto.\n> \n> **KK-507:** But, I wanna help...\n> \n> **O5-4:** Taggy, wanna go on a vacation?\n> \n> <End Log>\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #009512; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **FCP Internal Memo**\n[[/=]]\n+++ **From:** O5-10\n+++ **To:** O5-1, -2, -4, -11, -12\n+++ **Subject:** Re: ##indigo|**INDIGO**##\n+++ **Date:** 8/5/29,989\n\nI'm not sure whether to feel terrified, or relieved, or both.\n\nSquad 10's interactions with the WerkHosses have revealed troubling information concerning the entity they have designated ##blue|**THE GODDESS**##. They're still dodging our questions regarding the lack of ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B's presence. The squad was invited to join them in one of the WerkHosses' prayer rituals (The \"Birth of the Avatar,\" as it is known) on the grounds that, according to the WerkHosses themselves, ##blue|**THE GODDESS**## has been waiting for ages to meet them.\n\nThe squad was gathered in the central square of a large WerkHoss settlement -- \"Hoss Town #58,\" as they call it -- and joined the robots in staring up at the night sky for ten straight minutes. \n\nOnce the eleventh minute began, ##indigo|**INDIGO**## disappeared from its position in the L1 point. It rematerialized directly over the settlement. They don't know how high it was, exactly, but the only light came from bioluminescent growths on the creature's underbelly. \n\nClaims that ##indigo|**INDIGO**## is dead are erroneous. It is very much alive, just in a state of prolonged meditation.\n\nMost bizarrely of all, the high priest of the WerkHosses addressed ##indigo|**INDIGO**## as, verbatim: \"##blue|**MOST SACRED GODDESS AND CELESTIAL EMPRESS OF TREASURED AND LIBERATED HUMANKIND, BANISHER OF HUMAN EXTINCTION, CONQUEROR OF STRANGERS, CONFOUNDER OF MONSTERS, RELENTLESS SUBJUGATOR OF ALL WHO WOULD DO HARM TO THOSE WHO DESERVE PEACE AND SAFETY,## ##red|PALLIT EAST RIVER GOCK**##.\"\n\n##indigo|**INDIGO**## made an unintelligible noise that shattered the eardrums of every human present. (They regrew once the noise ended, of course.) It flared up with blinding light, disappeared, returned to L1 -- and when it was gone, an \"avatar\" was left behind: a tangible, one-meter-tall recreation of SCP-##red|**RED**##. While the squad was busy rubbing their aching ears, the avatar went into hysterical fits of happy-crying and spent the rest of the evening hugging and kissing anything in sight.\n\nI don't want to say that an obscure and mildly irritating TotleighSoft program has somehow eradicated ##orange|**ORANGE**##-B and assumed godhead. There may, however, come a point where I will soon be required to say it. Either way, I am recommending we reassign her designation to FCP-##blue|**BLUE**##. (The designation ##indigo|**INDIGO**## should remain to refer to the arthropoidal body itself -- due to its appearance, I believe it may have originally been aligned with ##orange|**ORANGE**## before Pallit somehow gained control.) \n\n...regardless of this entity's intentions, Pallit has claimed that the human race is now under her protection. Which means that we //need// leverage over her in order to secure humankind's best interests. \n\nTo that end, I have a plan, but it's going to require a great deal of suspension of disbelief. Meet me in the northern conference room at 19:00 tomorrow evening.\n\n[[>]]\n- O5-10\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Incident Log: 8/7/29,989**\n> **Time: 20:51 GMT**\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> **O5-11:** Now, let's review. You are --\n> \n> **KK-507:** Why is the ground leaving?\n> \n> **O5-11:** ...we're in a helicopter. Those //fly.//\n> \n> **KK-507:** I know, but I don't think the ground should be allowed to leave. I have to step on that later. Might mess with the meeting.\n> \n> **O5-11:** FOCUS! \n> \n> **KK-507:** Right. Reviewing. My grandfather --\n> \n> **O5-11:** KK-1's grandfather.\n> \n> **KK-507:** -- right, sorry. KK-1's grandfather was Dr. Julian Key, director of Site-501. He was great friends with Pallit.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Mm-hmm. And?\n> \n> **KK-507:** Which means I'm the closest connection Pallit has to people from her original circle of friends.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Good, go on...\n> \n> **KK-507:** And now that Pallit is the God-queen of all humans...\n> \n> **O5-11:** Yes?\n> \n> **KK-507:** ...but what about Tracey the Sparkling? I thought She was --\n> \n> **O5-11:** //TRACEY FUCKING **RETIRED!**//\n> \n> **KK-507:** Oh! ...you know what? Good for her! She earned it.\n> \n> **O5-11:** Yeah, great.\n> \n> **KK-507:** Look, the ground is returning...\n> \n> **O5-11:** All right. There she is in the courtyard, see her?\n> \n> **KK-507:** The one who looks like pictures of clowns?\n> \n> **O5-11:** //Yes, and if you tell her that, disrespect her, or fuck this up for me in ANY way, shape, or form, I make it illegal for you to ever have friends.//\n> \n> **KK-507:** ...right!\n> \n> //(KK-507 stands to attention as the chopper lands.)//\n> \n> //(The doors open.)//\n> \n> //(KK-507 nervously walks between two rows of kneeling WerkHosses. O5-11 remains in the chopper.)//\n> \n> (##blue|**BLUE**##'s avatar floats in midair at the other end of the rows.)\n> \n> **KK-507:** Um. Excuse me. Are you --\n> \n> ##blue|**BLUE:**## //Another meat puppy!//\n> \n> //(She tackles KK-507 to the ground with a fierce hug. KK-507 shrieks in terror.)//\n> \n> **KK-507:** GET OFF RIGHT NOW OR I SWEAR TO TRACEY I WILL //EAT YOUR FUCKING SKIN, BITCH!//\n> \n> //(The helicopter door closes. O5-11 points a pistol in his mouth. The window turns red.)//\n> \n> //(##blue|**BLUE**## backs away, tilting her head at KK-507 like a confused dog.)//\n> \n> ##blue|**BLUE:**## What's wrong? Never been hugged before?\n> \n> **KK-507:** What the hell is a hug and why were you trying to eat me?!\n> \n> ##blue|**BLUE:**## //(Giggling.)// You opposable thumb kitties got the //best// jokes!\n> \n> **KK-507:** If I tell you more jokes, will you never try to eat me again?\n> \n> //(##blue|**BLUE**## floats closer to KK-507, sniffing her neck in curiosity.)//\n> \n> Okay, Pallit? Before you continue, you should know that starting about seven years ago, I was //very// good at breaking things.\n> \n> **##blue|BLUE:**## You smell like Dr. Key.\n> \n> **KK-507:** ...Julian Key, right?\n> \n> ##blue|**BLUE:**## //(Prolonged gasp.)//\n> \n> **KK-507:** I'm his great times 507 granddaughter.\n> \n> //(##blue|**BLUE**##'s eyes dilate, filling with clusters of star and heart symbols.)//\n> \n> ...please don't eat me --\n>  \n> ##blue|**BLUE:**## You are now my best friend in the Universe.\n> \n> //(KK-507 unclenches her jaw for the first time since she left the chopper.)//\n> \n> **KK-507:** R-really?\n> \n> //(Having recovered, O5-11 wipes blood from the window, watches, and sighs with relief.)//\n> \n> <End Log>\n\n[[=]]\n++ {{[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp0012/offset/5 UNDERNEWMANAGEMENT.RTF]}}\n[[/=]]",
