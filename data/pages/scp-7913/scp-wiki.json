Area-508 consists of SCP-7913 and the neighboring police station, which have been surrounded by reinforced and bombproofed[[footnote]] (While a complete activation event would prove uncontainable, this is to protect SCP-7913 from external activation due to natural disasters, civil unrest, or war.) [[/footnote]] concrete. This was done under the public front of a factory compound for a private organization.\n\nThe police station next to SCP-7913 has been repurposed into a holding area for D-Class personnel to be used for procedure 12-Norquay. Currently, the recurrence of activation events necessitates no fewer than --5-- --20-- 40 D-Class personnel available onsite at any given time.\n\nActivation Events are to be suppressed through Procedure 12-Norquay, which is to be carried out as follows: a D-Class staff member who has not yet participated in Procedure 12-Norquay will immediately be led through SCP-7913-A.\n\nLethal force has been authorized against any personnel who willingly or unintentionally interfere with Procedure 12-Norquay or attempt to damage SCP-7913.\n\nThough it requires significantly less urgent attention than SCP-7913 or SCP-7913-A, SCP-7913-B is to be continually monitored for new arrivals, and the pathway from the door is to be kept clear.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7913 refers to the contents of a warehouse in the █████████ neighborhood of St. Paul, MN. Through remote-controlled drone observation, the following facts have been determined about SCP-7913:\n\n# It is a large and complicated electronic weapon that comprises 93% of the warehouse's interior.\n# There is no visible power source; electric power is maintained through unknown, presumably anomalous means.\n# SCP-7913's largest component, a black sphere, is an explosive charge that contains the equivalent of [REDACTED] exatons of TNT[[footnote]] (Gleaned from monitor readouts on the southern end of SCP-7913; ground-penetrating radar confirmed inner spatial anomalies. While it is unknown if whether this reading is an accurate figure or hyperbole, testing for accuracy would be inadvisable due to the fact that 1/[REDACTED]th of [REDACTED] exatons would be enough to cause an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.) [[/footnote]] compressed into a 20-meter radius. \n\nFurther research has been hindered by the fact that SCP-7913 will start an activation event if a human subject enters the warehouse, a drone makes physical contact with any part of the device, or any attempts are made to hack into SCP-7913's mainframe. As such, the origin, creator, and age[[footnote]] (The warehouse containing SCP-7913 does not appear in any official building records in St. Paul. Attempts to chemically date the material of the surrounding warehouse have resulted in the initiation/abbreviation of activation events.) [[/footnote]] of SCP-7913 remain unknown.\n\nSCP-7913-A is a 197 cm x 80 cm door attached to the southern wall of SCP-7913-A's warehouse. There is no exterior handle. A symbol of a black turtle's silhouette has been painted on it. There is an LED marquee and a loudspeaker above the door.\n\nSCP-7913-A only opens during an activation event. It leads to a plain white room[[footnote]] (Current estimate of the room's size is 3m^^3^^ -- attempts to accurately measure the size have resulted in the time limit of the activation event being shortened.)[[/footnote]] that is extradimensional in origin.\n\nAt seemingly random intervals (and when provoked by external means), SCP-7913 and SCP-7913-A will enter an activation event, which consists of the following: \n\n* Motors and other machinery audibly begin operation within SCP-7913 for approximately ten seconds.\n* SCP-7913-A opens.\n* The loudspeaker above SCP-7913-A begins emitting a 100 dB klaxon.\n* The marquee displays a 60-second countdown next to the flashing phrase {{**\"!! GET IN !! (pls)\"**}}\n * Note: Once the countdown begins, certain actions during the activation event can cause the countdown to decrease. This is noted by a sudden beep and the marquee briefly displaying {{**\">_< PENALTY >_<\"**}} before returning to the countdown screen. The following actions have been proven to incur a \"penalty:\"\n  * A human subject entering the warehouse.\n  * Attempts to remotely hinder SCP-7913's operation.\n  * A human subject who has previously undergone Procedure 12-Norquay entering SCP-7913-A.\n  * Attempts to tamper with the marquee or speaker.\n  * Rude gestures or insults toward SCP-7913 or SCP-7913-A.\n  * Multiple human subjects entering SCP-7913-A.\n  * A valid human subject for Procedure 12-Norquay attempts to leave SCP-7913-A.\n* At the 20-second mark, the core of SCP-7913 begins vibrating.\n* At the 0-second mark, one of two things occur:\n * If conditions for Procedure 12-Norquay have been met, the door closes, the alarm stops, SCP-7913 powers down, and the marquee displays {{**\"^_^ GR8 JOB A++ <3\"**}} before switching off.\n * If conditions for Procedure 12-Norquay have not been met, something within SCP-7913's core will begin screeching while the Marquee briefly displays {{**\"D: OH NOOOOO ;_; </3\"**}}. This was briefly observed during an activation event on 12/19/22, which was aborted by the 12-Norquay participant being forcibly thrown into SCP-7913-A. As a result, the shrieking noise ended and the previous \"positive\" results were enacted, save for the marquee displaying {{**\"0_0 !! 3 CLOSE 5 COMFORT !! ^_^;;\"**}}.\n\nIt has not been empirically determined what would happen if the countdown were allowed to reach zero without remedy, but from SCP-7913's explosive yield, it can be deduced that any action taken beyond this point would be irrelevant.\n\nSCP-7913-B is an identical door to SCP-7913-A located on the warehouse's north side. It has no involvement with activation events or Procedure 12-Norquay. However, past participants from Procedure 12-Norquay will occasionally exit from this door with no memory of what took place between their procedure and their exit. This usually happens between three to six months after their entry of SCP-7913-A. \n\nSCP-7913-B recovery has taken place with only 12% of participants.\n\n**Addendum - Escalation/Analysis:**\n \n> **From:** Katya Dodgson (kdodgson1@foundation.scp)\n> **To:** O5 Command\n> **Subject:** Re: SCP-7913\n> \n> Council,\n> \n> You have told me previously to give SCP-7913's containment procedures two years' worth of a chance to prove their sustainability. It has //been// two years, and I not only can I confirm that not only are they unsustainable, but they're suicide.\n> \n> Yes, SCP-7913 is in the middle of a major city. No, there are not enough resources to discreetly have it shot into space. I get that. But we //need// something better, and I'm tired of being stonewalled about this. \n> \n> As recently as yesterday, there was a streak of 58 activation events in the span of an hour. That's just short of one per minute. It's as if SCP-7913 knows we're putting so much effort in -- and every time it pushes our boundaries, we're giving it the go-ahead. I have enclosed other such reports with this email, but honestly, I don't know if there's enough time to read them. I'm too worried about what SCP-7913 might try to do while your eyes are mid-sentence.\n> \n> Forget worrying about running out of available D-Class. We're going to run out of available //humans// someday.\n> \n> [[>]]\n> - Dr. Katya Dodgson, Site Director of Area-508\n> [[/>]]\n\n> **From:** Carl Grodin [cgrodin8@foundation.scp]\n> **To:** Katya Dodgson [kdodgson1@foundation.scp]\n> **Subject:** Fwd: Re: SCP-7913\n> \n> Hi, Dr. Dodgson! My name's Dr. Carl Grodin from Site-59, and I'm currently on a plane to Area-508. O5-11 let me know about your predicament with 7913. \n> \n> I've been going over the data from Procedure 12-Norquay and I've noticed a correlation between the activation events and the magnitude of SCP-7913's explosive charge. I realize that correlation doesn't equal causation, but this isn't anything general; this is a yes-no effect attached to //every// activation event.\n> \n> It has to do with the recoveries brought about by 7913-B. Between 3 to 6 months after each activation, if the Norquay subject //hasn't// been recovered, the magnitude will go up by exactly one petaton of TNT. But if the subject //has//, that number //doesn't// increase.\n> \n> In short, there's something about the unrecovered subjects that's making the bomb bigger.\n> \n> What that \"boom factor\" (tentative name until we can think of something more clinical) might be is something I'm still looking into. But having gone over the records of the D-class we've been sending through 7913-A, I have a hypothesis.\n> \n> Each of the recovered participants has at least one of the following qualities:\n> * No history of violence\n> * No criminal record (recruited through Protocol 12)\n> * No history of mental illness\n> * A generally positive outlook on life, as determined by onsite psychiatric analysts\n> \n> I realize that none of this immediately translates to a better containment solution. But I genuinely believe I'm on to something. Because there is a personal quality that could //increase// the explosive yield of SCP-7913, the absence of which does nothing.\n> \n> But what if there were a quality that could //decrease// this magnitude?\n> \n> To this end, I'd be willing to volunteer in the first available action event, perhaps with a hidden camera. If this is some kind of test of character, then instead of a nonstop stream of death row inmates, why not send someone who actually graduated college?\n> \n> Besides, I feel like I haven't made myself actually useful once in my six years of Foundation service. This might be a chance to make up for lost time.\n> \n> [[>]]\n> - Dr. Carl Grodin, Site-59 Electronics Coordinator\n> [[/>]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #009512; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **Activation Event-5J7A7 Hidden Camera Footage - Archived Live Feed**\n[[/=]]\n//(Field of view opens on the interior of SCP-7913's entry chamber.

He quickly turns around.)//\n\nWait...\n\n//(The once-empty room has been replaced with a larger chamber that can be best be described as a middle school library. There are no windows. One shelf is completely filled with copies of [[[SCP-5198]]]. Turtle-themed decorations are omnipresent: turtle posters, turtle figurines, et cetera. A large poster over the librarian's desk features a cartoon turtle holding a wooden sign that says// **\"REMEMBER: TURTLE TOWN IS A ##red|NO-WUNTZING## ZONE!\"** //with an crossed-out red circle icon over the silhouette of an aardvark.)//\n\n//(The librarian is a hirsute man in his mid-forties with a tight-fitting polo shirt.

He stares at Grodin, perturbed.)//\n\nWhat?\n\n//(Joeyjoe backs away. He sighs into his cupped pams.)//\n\n**Joeyjoe:** Okay, you know what? That's fine. I mean, granted, we'd prefer if we didn't have you wuntzing right off the bat, but no one's perfect. Some planes just need a longer runway.

That takes care of plants. Now, what's your favorite fungus?\n\n**Grodin:** I mean, that's not something I think about a lot, but...
