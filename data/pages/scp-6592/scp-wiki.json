Per the accords drafted as part of the SCP-4661 investigation, any Tartarean entities involved in the SCP-6592 case are to be questioned and released.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:35%;\"]]\n[[image http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jawn-four/poster2.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nA promotional image using during Project Bootstraps.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6592 is Richard \"Richie\" Marks, a 35-year-old male human from New York City, New York, USA. SCP-6592 is a former stockbroker, brokerage founder, seminar performer, and rudimentary thaumaturge, gaining its abilities after inadvertently entering and consuming forbidden investing techniques from the Wanderers' Library.\n\nPrior to his containment, SCP-6592 utilized several currently unknown thaumaturgic methods, in conjunction with demonic rituals and influence from Tartarean entities, to create SCP-6592-1, which he utilized to grow his portfolio, influence, and brokerage, Greenfield INC.\n\nSCP-6592 tours the United States under the pseudonym \"The Business Wizard,\" presenting in conference and seminar shows known as the \"Biz Wiz Experience.\"  The Biz Wiz Experience has become infamous for the showmanship and extravagance displayed by SCP-6592 during it. Thaumaturgy is used for many segments, including self-propelling flight, demonic summoning, as well as minor coercion on the part of SCP-6592 to influence his audience to purchase its goods and services. Consequently, SCP-6592 has developed a cult online following dedicated to his lavish lifestyle and inspirational speeches.\n\nSCP-6592-1 is a method of virtually undetectable stock market manipulation utilized between 2015 and 2020. SCP-6592-1 is capable of allowing the user to control the buying and selling habits on the New York Stock Exchange. SCP-6592 was used by  Greenfield INC. to commit numerous \"pump-and-dump\" schemes.[[footnote]] A pump-and-dump scam involves the defrauding of investors by brokers who own stock. Investors will be led to believe a stock is a good investment, leading to the rise of the stocks price. The initial holders will then sell their stock at an inflated price, leading to massive profits for them and the stock losing all value for the misled investors. [[/footnote]] Greenfield INC. was investigated by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation; however, no evidence of wrongdoing was uncovered, leading to Foundation intervention due to the improbability of this.\n\n**Addendum 6592.1:** Recovered Materials and Interview\n\nDuring a covert operation conducted by Mobile Task Force λ-667 \"Stock Breakers\" on SCP-6592's residence and Greenfield INC.'s headquarters, agents recovered the following materials:\n* Two boarding passes for Las Vegas, Nevada. Both were in SCP-6592's name;\n* A suitcase containing USD 130,000;\n * Discovered in Marks' third garage; all the serial numbers on the bills were identical;\n* A hidden bag containing a massive amount of illegal narcotics including cocaine, mescaline, LSD, and ether.\n* A large safe containing:\n * Two leather-bound tomes, the first regarding demonology and the second about general thaumaturgy. The inner covers of both read \"Property of the Wanderers' Library;\"\n * Various weaponry, including pistols, ancient samurai swords, and a crossbow;\n * One human skeleton of unknown origin.\n\nUnder the guise of FBI agents, MTF λ-667 arrested SCP-6592 on account of the fake currency. Marks was transported to Site-322 for questioning the same day.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n\n-----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n= __Interrogation Chamber__\n\n**Lague:** Alright -- there we go.

Richie, you're the owner of the Greenfield Inc. brokerage--\n\n**SCP-6592:** You //know// that already. I already got investigated by you bozos four //goddamn// times and they found nothing. Clean as a whistle. This is a witchhunt at this point. Abuse. Racial discrimination.\n\n**Lague:** What? No, what are you talking about? From what I've read here, you've seen immense growth these last few years -- in both your brokerage and stock holdings. Lower middle class to the upper crust of American society in less than a year. What is it now, twelve hundred employees smack dab in the middle of Wall Street?\n\n**SCP-6592:** Hard work and dedication. We're both working men, we know that it eventually pays off.\n\n**Lague:** Mhm. You go to Vegas a lot, right?\n\n**SCP-6592:** What does that have to do with anything I just fucking said?\n\n**Lague:** \"Hard work and dedication\" are not words famously associated with Sin City.

Pump and dump schemes -- real scumbag shit, I know. But I never got caught.\n\n**Lague:** You aren't exactly the sharpest boat in the toolbox, what gives? What's the Richie Marks secret?\n\n**SCP-6592:** Magic.\n\n**Lague:** ...Magic.\n\n//(Lague signals to SCP-5595.)//\n\n**SCP-6592:** No, seriously.\n\n**Lague:** Oh. Elaborate.\n\n**SCP-6592:** I can't tell you -- I can barely wrap my head around it. All I know is that it's real fucking magic blessed by the sin of greed itself. It was a spell I helped make, I don't know what it does really, I just know I can make a position rise or fall whenever I want it to.\n\n**Lague:** Slow down, //sin// of greed? Deadly sins?\n\n**SCP-6592:** ...Yes?\n\n**Lague:**  Oh no. Is that why you had the tickets to Vegas?\n\n**SCP-6592:** Is there something I should know?\n\n**Lague:** Answer the question, Richie.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Look, you don't want me, you want my boss! I was set to perform in two days and meet a contact but then you guys fucked everything up.\n\n**Lague:** In Vegas?\n\n**SCP-6592:** I meet with a contact there. Why are you so concerned about Vegas?\n\n**Lague:** //[To Command]// Call up House at 666, he's going to have a field day with this dipstick. Anyway. Please continue, Richie.\n\n**SCP-6592:** The person or thing who gave me the spell, I don't know I haven't met them, sends some fancy douchebag to check in on me every month and give me a gift. I basically have a walk-in closet full of stupid magic bullshit now. Cursed office chairs, demonic-infused citrus spritzers.\n\n**Lague:** Wait, wait, wait. You haven't met your boss?\n\n**SCP-6592:** No, do you think they're //that// stupid? I'm sure one of those fratboy assholes with the horns can take you to them if you threaten to dump a martini on their Christian Dior.\n\n**Lague:** You seem pretty relaxed about being in regular contact with a demon.\n\n**SCP-6592:** I don't make the rules, I just play the game, baby.\n\n**Lague:** Pretty bad at it, aren't you?\n\n**SCP-6592:**  I bet if you got the spell you'd be over there just as often as I am. It's called gratefulness. You know, I'm kinda pissed we both know about Vegas. Thought I had something unique there. What about the giant library in the oil spill-looking portals?\n\n**Lague:** The Wanderers' Library, yes. Frankly, it's a testament to the power of your idiocy you're still alive. The Library generally doesn't suffer fools or thieves, and definitely not foolish thieves.\n\n**SCP-6592:** I hope they don't have late fees. Might be fucked there.\n\n**Lague:** Actually, possibly the most pressing thing I need to know is the number of people you told all this to. That could be a major security breach, Richie.\n\n**SCP-6592:** I kept something to myself for once.\n\n**Lague:** Huh, uncharacteristically smart. Why?\n\n**SCP-6592:** I mean, what kind of gaping asshole would expose the existence of something as wondrous and magic--\n\n**Lague:** You didn't want anyone to exploit it before you could.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Absolutely.\n\n**Lague:** Figures.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Plus I'd be thrown in the loony bin if I even tried to tell anyone. I only grabbed a couple of books from there, learned the magic, and went in and out every so often for travel.\n\n **Lague:** Nothing in those books mentions anything about using them for personal gain, it was just rune drawing and physical illusions. The demon-summoning book is a different ballpark, but one with almost the same story. The demons, at least the ones in that book, don't commit securities fraud.\n\n**SCP-6592:** They //eat people.//\n\n **Lague:** Most of them have outgrown that.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Most?\n\n **Lague:** Just keep going.\n\n**SCP-6592:** There was already some spell going around Wall Street, where you pray to some [[[SCP-3197 |Federal Reserve Chairman]]]. I tried it; didn't work. I heard it used to until the ritual got messed up — something about the douchebag being put in jail.  I knew this stuff worked on finances, it was only a matter of figuring out what I had to do.\n \n**Lague:** How'd you learn about Vegas?\n\n**SCP-6592:** This Library's a hub right, especially for people more magical than me. I started hearing about the deadly sins heading to Vegas, along with hell itself attaching to it somehow. Is that true?\n\n**Lague:** You could say that.\n\n**SCP-6592:** After that it was all kinds of stories: Hades owning a casino, a [[[SCP-5690 | lust sex club]]], gluttony burger joint--\n\n//(Lague writes a note.)//\n\n**SCP-6592:** Given that at least the two of the seven sins were there, I tried my luck and decided to check it out equipped with what I knew about magic and what I wanted to gain.\n\n**Lague:** So you were going to get high as hell and go to Vegas.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Great plan, right?\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6592.2:** Mission Proposal\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 125%]]**MISSION PROPOSAL: PROJECT BOOTSTRAPS**[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-4661/lux.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nSite-666, located within [[[SCP-4661]]].\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= __**MISSION DETAILS**__\nProject Bootstrap will include a joint task force of MTF Ω-33 \"Ocean's Three-Hundred\" and MTF λ-667 \"Stock Breakers\" posing as patrons, audience members, and security at the MGM Grand Casino.

I might have to pawn my service weapon.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** That's definitely what we're worried about right now.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** ETA five minutes, bossman.\n\n//(Atlantic and Pacific converge on the Security Team's location.)//\n\n**λ-667 | ##22a846|York##:** Marks, the demon is coming to your door. Be aware that it has bodyguards so, for the love of God, don't do anything stupid.\n\n**SCP-6592:** You really think I'm stupid enough to--\n\n**All Agents:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-6592:** Well, alright, fuck you guys too--\n\n//(SCP-6592-β knocks on SCP-6592's door and is allowed in. SCP-6592-Γ and SCP-6592-Δ post themselves outside of the room.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Alright, time to get hot, boys. Hope you said your prayers and ate your vegetables.\n\n//(Agents Atlantic, York, and Pacific unholster their weaponry, all loaded with pressurised holy water.)//\n\n//(Atlantic turns the corner and begins firing, squirting water at the nearest entity. The other agents follow. SCP-6592-Γ immediately falls to the ground, its skin smoking through holes in its Gym Shark tank top. The other crouches and uses its Supreme puffer jacket to protect its uncovered skin, returning fire with a small handheld pistol.)//\n\n**λ-667 | ##22a846|York##:*** Shit!\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** You alright?\n\n**λ-667 | ##22a846|York##:** I'm hit! Cover me!\n\n//(York rolls behind audio equipment with Atlantic.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Damn it! Naz, Arc, come in, damn it. One down. Help would be appreciated!\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** Close behind!\n\n//(Naz rounds the corner from the opposite direction and heaves a comically large bag of casino chips at the entity's head, causing it to stumble and sending chips flying across the hallway.)//\n\n//(Pacific fires his weapon. SCP-6592-Δ is incapacitated.)//\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** You're welcome.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Shut the fuck up.\n\n//(Arctic tosses a chip at Pacific. All uninjured agents enter the makeup room, save for Naz, who is retrieving his casino chips.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Stay where you are!\n\n//(SCP-6592-β leaps behind SCP-6592.)//\n\n**SCP-6592-β:** Watch the shoes! Don't shoot, this was a lot of money!\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Who sent you?\n\n**SCP-6592-β:** Are you those chumps out of the Luxor?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Motherfucker I will put so much holy water in you you'll be pissing baptisms!\n\n**SCP-6592-β:** I will sue! Do you know who my overlord is? Don't mess with me!\n\n//(Pacific fires his weapon at the ceiling.)//\n\n**SCP-6592-β:** Look, look, let's all calm down! I'll tell you whatever you want. Please, just watch the suit.\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-6592-β was placed into Foundation demonic custody at Site-666 and divulged the pertinent information at the promise its suit, shoes, and hair would be left alone.\n\n**Addendum 6592.5:** Confrontation\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n\n-----\n\n**<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n-----\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** The fuckboy demon said it was room 500 on the 13th floor.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** 13th floor, bit obvious, no?\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:**  Branding means a lot, nowadays.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Yeah, but these are demons. Their brand is being evil and stealing souls.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** Is that racist?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** It's like their whole thing!\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Oh come //on//, I can provide twenty examples off the top of my head that disprove--\n\n//(The elevator door opens, revealing a long empty hallway. The team traverses down the corridor and enters a private stairwell.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** How many secret rooms does this place have?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** We really gotta take a look at the blueprints for these places before we go in, man.\n\n//(The stairway terminates in another hallway; its walls are painted white with gold trim. A single set of doors is seen on the opposite end. Pacific kicks them open, and the team enters a lavish hotel suite. A woman, wearing a black suit, is sitting in a leather chair across from a fireplace. The floor-length windows look out over SCP-4661. She does not make eye contact with the agents.)//\n\n**Unknown:** You could have knocked first. After the whole thing with Pluto, I'd rather not get into a skirmish.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** ...Are you another god?\n\n**Unknown:** I am. You can call me Fortuna. Shouldn't be too hard to figure out what I'm the goddess of.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Could-- can you look at us? Kinda weird that you're staring off into space.\n\n**Fortuna:** I am blind.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Oh. Sorry.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** Nice one, dickweed.\n\n//(Glasses of red wine manifest in the agents' hands.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** Man, you are way nicer than Pluto was.\n\n**Fortuna:** So, to what do I owe the pleasure?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** You're in contact with a man by the name of Richard Marks -- he's a stockbroker.\n\n**Fortuna:** Yes. Richie. I saw such great potential in him. He's done wonderfully, hasn't he? Went from nothing to one of my greatest projects.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** He scammed thousands of people and stole someone's legs.\n\n**Fortuna:** Well, there's no such thing as clean money. He does what he needs to do. I don't direct him, I simply observe.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** I don't think I'm following you here. Does he give you money or a kickback of some sort? I don't understand this relationship.\n\n**Fortuna:** I don't get 'kickbacks' from him, I don't need it. I've made and lost and made my own fortune a thousand times over in less time than it takes Sol to pull the sun across the sky. His usefulness comes from what he does. He keeps me busy and comfortable.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** ...Is it like a... you know?\n\n**Fortuna:** Pardon, honey?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** You know.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** What are you talking about?\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Is it like... a sex thing?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** Dude.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** No! Why are you like this?\n\n**Fortuna:** Well, aren't we bold?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** ...It's not a sex thing, right?\n\n**Fortuna:** No. Gods have our immortality and our ambrosia and nectar. That's enough, but it doesn't give you happiness -- it gives you boring existence. Mars feeds off war and strife, Venus feeds off love and lust, and I'm given purpose and comfort with man's greed and gain. In return, this place prospers. That's why I stay here. On top of the obvious, I'm also a patron of luck. This place is teeming with both.\n\n//(Fortuna winks in Naz's general direction. The agents form a huddle.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** How do we get her out of here?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** We can't bet it on blackjack again. That's kind of a one-trick pony.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** How about we just ask her to leave? Occam's Razor and all that.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** That'll--\n\n**Fortuna:** If I could intrude on your wonderful meeting, I'll just clear this up. I can't leave Las Vegas unless you're willing to suffer a calamity.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** That's a bit drastic.\n\n**Fortuna:** Is it? I //am// luck and I //am// fortune. Isn't that what separates this city from every other one? Without me, it would be no different. I bestow this place its reputation and uphold it. That's why I'm satiated here. We're cyclical. I feed it, it feeds me.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Wait, wait. If you're fine here, why do you need Marks to work for you?\n\n**Fortuna:** It's fun to have a pet. I just gave him a little assistance and he took off by himself. Do you get something out of watering a flower to watch it blossom?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** If we decide to lock him in a cell, will you be upset?\n\n**Fortuna:** Not particularly. He was getting a bit boring anyway. He had hit his stride of success.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Don't you like success?\n\n**Fortuna:** I like success //against the odds//. Winning when the entire hand is stacked against you. Coming in with a dollar and turning it into a fortune.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Huh.\n\n//(The team huddles again.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** I have an idea.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** What is it?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Just trust me.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Against all my better judgment, okay.\n\n**Fortuna:** Mm, this should be interesting.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Alright... god... lady.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:** He forgot her name. Fantastic start.\n\n**Fortuna:** Fortuna, honey.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Right. Fortuna. You lent Richie your boon because the odds were against him, right? And now he's gotten boring. Predictable.\n\n**Fortuna:** Mhmm.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** And we can't remove you from Vegas because then the city would implode. What if we offered you a compromise?\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** Where is he going with this?\n\n**Fortuna:** What sort of compromise?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Moving you to a suite in the Luxor. And you lend your luck to us instead.\n\n**Fortuna:** Why would I do that?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** We're an organization trying to contain demons in a city founded by demons, for demons, full of demons. We own a casino in the heart of Sin City and have to stop it from sinning itself into hell every five minutes. That sure sounds like the odds are stacked against us to me. Wouldn't that be a much more fun struggle to support than Richie buying a new yacht?\n\n**Fortuna:** Hm. You do make a compelling argument... how's the buffet?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** Pardon?\n\n**Fortuna:** In your casino. How's the buffet?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:**  It's pretty great.\n\n**Fortuna:** Okay. Done. Send someone to get my things. You wouldn't make a blind woman move her own things, would you?\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Wow.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##2277a8|Arctic##:**  Holy shit.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** This city is insane.\n\n**Fortuna:** Yes. You're wondering what the odds of that working was. You must have gotten really lucky.\n\n//(She smiles at Atlantic.)//\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Pacific##:** What's the catch, are you gonna go find another 'pet' or mess with our luck somehow?\n\n**Fortuna:** That's your gamble to make. I can't give you the answer, there's no fun in that.\n\n**Ω-33 | ##a82222|Atlantic##:** Fine. Thanks, I guess.\n\n**λ-667 | ##2277a8|Naz##:** Real quick, why Richie though? He's one of the daftest idiots ever. Like, he //stole someone's legs// because he botched a summoning, and the SEC keeps catching onto his firm. This isn't someone I'd consider a first-round pick.\n\n//(Fortuna shrugs.)//\n\n**Fortuna:** Fortune favors the bold.\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe development for a method of containing Fortuna and similar godly entities is currently underway by the Department of Tactical Theology.

SCP-6592 was subsequently transported to Site-322.\n\n\n**Addendum 6592.5:** Containment Breach\n\nOn March 30, 2021, a multi-level security breakdown occurred at Site-322, leading to the opening of the low-level humanoid containment cells, specifically SCP-6592's chamber. Upon its exit, all security cameras lost connection to their power sources, and radio communication within the humanoid containment wing subsequently broke down.\n\nSCP-6592 managed to reach to the first-floor emergency exit without encountering any Foundation staff or recontainment teams. He was, however, unable to escape due to the door failing to open, despite the door being unlocked. SCP-6592 was subsequently recontained. A debrief meeting of Site-322 staff occurred soon after.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n\n-----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n**Lague:** How the hell did he make it that far?\n\n**Coix:** Complete communications breakdown, the likes of which we've never seen before. One section of the Site just went offline then came back by itself.\n\n **Lague:** He had his dampener on, right? This wasn't Marks?\n\n**Coix:** Yep, it was just a completely random occurrence.
