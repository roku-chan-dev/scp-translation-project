It was put into place to punish the prior-day masters of humankind, the Elder Gods whose pernicious ends had cast a delirium over all magic and plunged the world into ignorance under them. Eibon was a wise yeren scholar, who offered worship to all gods as it aided his workings but pledged allegiance to none; in this regard, he may be among the first conventional occultists. He hailed from the vast tropical rainforests of Plaksha-that-Hyperborea-would-be, where the Old Gods reigned supreme and their undoing will shaped the boundaries of IS moreso than anywhere else in the earthly realms. His rites were the greatest seen ever thusfar, and with them the archmage hoped to exile the Elders' alien influence so that only in those gods offered worship by man would be vested the power to shape us.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**SCP-8181-CROOK** is the **Vast Cloaking**, a rite enacted by the King Solomon in the days after the dusk of the Deathless Empire. Solomon reigned over the western coast of the Land of the Two Rivers and Two Trees, ruling from the holy city of Jerusalem. A wise occultist, he saw a new sun rising in the ashes of the First Occult War and seized the opportune moment, propping up the local god of the Israelites as Rite's Fulcrum at the centre of the flow of arcana for the whole world in the absence of an incumbent during the post-collapse chaos. In so doing, he suddenly found himself wielding power even greater than the Kings of the Four Corners to the East or the Builders to the West, for he controlled the magic and shaped it to his liking. \n\nSolomon protected his kingdom wisely, and enlisting a number of artifacts and rites of his own devising, locked away demons and bound them to his own will so long as they remained securely contained. With the Vast Cloaking, the King wished to take the final step; the work stretched three-thousand years into the past and three-thousand into the future, propping for this duration the notion that humankind would hide behind myths of gods and monsters in their dealings with the paranormal so only he could have the knowledge to command it. He hoped that this would secure the safety of his subjects for eternity, but this would be his undoing, for the drain and backlash of the ritual would kill him.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**SCP-8181-SPEAR** is the **Vast Sealing**, the working instantiated upon dawn of the Veil, put into action by The First and ensured by the Seed that Wove Itself Forevermore into the Foundation. The First -- the Founder, soon the Man With the Infinity Gun, had been fated to find the tomb of the Old King, and from it drew the blueprints of his rites to make himself his successor. He had a vision to place what was to be the entire world under the dominion of a philosopher-king much as Solomon had attempted in his domain; to install in that realm a vision of normalcy most conducive the safety of its people, and cast all else aside. Once the man traveled to the Land of the Two Rivers and Two Trees and tracked down the Gate, and its guardian Uriel the Aegis gave entrusted unto him the same command it had Solomon millennia earlier a second time, saying unto him, \"Prepare\", for the End Times could befall the world of magic at any moment.\n\nAnd so the Founder retreated into the Tomb of Solomon, studying the workings of those treasures and instructions the King left behind so that he too may command the occult. And according to the Guardian's warning, soon thereafter YHWH of Megiddo, humble god of Israel and Judah turned Godhead over all Earth, twelfth focal deity of the Era of Men, did perish under the ire of the Godless, and the world was plunged into chaos. So he and his associates went about creating the Great Sealing, the series of rites that would form the ultimate rite to cure the world of disorder, for never again could the anomalous be allowed to inflict such havoc upon its people. With its implementation, the subtle links that connected the domain of normalcy to the Greater World were broken, and the Earth was sundered in two halves. Now only the Ways remained, and even they were monitored, for every other  connection between the new normalcy and the old world was severed that possibly could be.\n\nThe Vast Sealing is everything that keeps the world sane. It is the Veil, drawing steadfast the line which demarcates chaos from order, false magic from the knowledge of science, and anarchy from civilization. If this haven of lucidity required the sacrifice of the Outer Realms into the unknowing and fearful dark of gods and monsters to allow itself to bask in the light of sanity, it will have been a worthy exchange, for the exclave of regularity we have created -- that portion of the World we were able to save -- is sacrosanct in its boundaries and its institution of normalcy is sacred and forever. In the name of the Foundation, by the wisdom of the Thirteen and the grace of the Founder, by the deaths of unknown thousands in the dark, may we stay fast, and may it hold forevermore.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]The Tomb of Solomon[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 12th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/Mq7oybN.png style=\"width: 455px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\nTwo men stood on opposite sides of a circle of chalk on the tile floor of an ancient tomb. Today would begin the ritual that would both end the world and begin it anew. Tomorrow the whims of magic and their billion-year reign over Earth would end.\n\nBut now, all there was to do was begin their work.\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/j0qbSmX.png]]\n[[/=]]\n\nFirst, into the circle was placed the Staff of Hermes. A flawless artifact ontologically immune to all physical and chemical change. The Caduceus embodied the hermetic way and the alchemical pursuits of its founders, though far predates the Thrice-Great Astrologer or the Messenger-deity of travelers or the learned Priest-King Djehuti or any other of the thousand men and gods who claimed the name Hermes throughout the ages. It was said to be able to totally alter the material and chemical properties of any object artificial or organic, and so too would it shape the radical new world from the group up, casting out the Old Ways and redefining magic on terms that could be controlled and isolated.\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/NISwpOi.png]]\n[[/=]]\n\nNext, into the circle was placed the Crook of Methuselah. A staff beffiting of a thousand year-old man, though none know whether it was named for the old mage or the methuselah tree from which it was carved. It was said to shift and bend the flow of time and the growth and senescence of living things, such that one could almost escape the grasp of eternity and create for himself a second Eden. So too would it sustain the new world of normalcy, and keep barred the untamed wilds beyond in both time and space for all perpetuity.\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/2xiyv7c.png]]\n[[/=]]\n\nLast, into the circle was placed the Spear of the Non-Believer. The right hand of the First Man, the Lance of Longinus, the Golden Arrow, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-summon-a-god-safely ultimate contingency plan]. The lance could reject all the divinities that called themselves the mortal's better and devour them whole, just as the Founder wished to reject the reign of an occult nature over an unwitting humankind. Not even the archivists of the Serpent's halls could know the true extent of its power, only warning in hushed tones of that primordial shard of antidivinity said to slay the gods by making mortals of them. So too would it excise magic from the Earth, and tear asunder the roads and seas and skies which connected to the prenormal world to itself.\n\nThere was not to be a fourth. Nowhere to found was the Blade of the Morning Star, the only artifact said to stand up to the Spear of the Non-Believer. Held stalwart in the hands of the Guardian, it was already accounted for, and its services apparently not required.\n\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n\nThe work glowed and pulsed with unworldly authority. Its eminence filled the room, and thus reasserted the dominion of the Solomonic Rite nearly three thousand years after its conception. For just that moment, in just that place, a circle and three arrows ruled the entire world.\n\nA voice abounded from the back of the chamber. \"According to plan, Aaron. Leave the relics here to resonate until they have overcharged. Tomorrow our men will begin to close the Doors, if all rites have the intended effect.\"\n\nThe man across the room responded, his voice echoing through the ancient tomb walls. \n\n\"Very good. Stay fast, Fritz, and proceed. Our paradise, at last, is at hand.\"\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[>]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 135%;\"]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8181/offset/8 |Act VIII -->]]] [[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
