It's a simple iron frame and a comfortable mattress.//\n//The room is quiet.//\n//They see nothing unusual on the CCTV.//\n//I run my hand down his face.//\nIt's going to be okay, Blake. I'm here. I'm always here.\nNobody else is going to treat you like I do.\nI'll always be here. Don't worry about //them.//\n//He lays on my lap. A single tear runs down his face. He stares at my face.//##\nYou're such a piece of shit. I hate you.\n##red|//His hand reaches and lays on my chest. I smile.//##\n##red|I know. Jackass.##\n##red|//I reach down and kiss his neck. He sighs.//##\n##red|What would I do without you, Blake? I think I'd be dead.\n//I can see he's torn. I know this is right. He thinks this is wrong.//##\nI... I have shit to do. I can't be late again.\n##red|Make an excuse. I don't get to see you enough. I'm stuck in here all the damn time.##\nI know, but-\n##red|No buts. If you really cared about me, you'd //stay.//##\n##red|//He falls silent, clinging to my side.//##\n##red|//We sit there for a moment.//##\n##red|//I'm aware of what I'm saying, of course.//##\n##red|//But it doesn't stop me. I know what I must do.//##\n##red|//It's for their benefit, really. They just can't see it. They won't, or can't.//##\n##red|//He'll make the right decision. I know he will.//##\nI'll... I'll find an excuse.\n##red|Good. I knew you'd make the right decision. I love you, Blake. You're... really good to me. And it's a better time than the dangerous SCPs, right?##\n##red|//A short chuckle escapes him.//##\n##red|//My hand reaches down to caress his side, and to search his pockets.//##\nI s'pose.\n##red|Besides. It's not like you have anyone else.##\n##red|//He coughs. Looks left, then right, glancing at the control panel window.//##\nWait. What time is it? A-ah, fuck... I really, REALLY gotta go, just... I'm sorry, please don't-\n##red|It's fine. Truly. Go ahead and do what you must do. I'll be stuck in here by myself. Thanks for that.##\n\n...\n\n##red|I'll see you later.##\nI- I hav-\n##red|I said, //I'll see you later.//##\n\n...goodbye, Lilly.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
