Live captured instances are contained in high-security containment chambers at TRITON-Site-934, while the remains of neutralized instances are recycled.\n\n------\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]Description:[[/span]] SCP-6533 is an unpredictable event exclusively affecting human spacecraft, with no known cause or pattern. Affected vehicles will begin to travel autonomously, disregarding any orders by its operator(s), for approximately five hours. After this period, the ship will begin to bend, tear and crush itself until it is reshaped into a body resembling the extinct //Aves// class of animals[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Commonly known as the bird. Formerly a highly-populant type of vertebrate prior to the ED-K Class Mass Memory Loss Event on Earth, which caused irredeemable damage to the biosphere, eventually terminating a majority of avian species. Remaining birds died off from incompatibility with extraterrestrial environments and other natural causes.[[/span]] from the planet Earth. These constructs are designated SCP-6533-1.\n\nFully formed SCP-6533-1 instances are sentient, and will attempt to search for and destroy any human infrastructure -- both terrestrial and interstellar -- through pecking, slapping (with their \"wings\"), or bombardment (with remaining fuel). These attacks will continue indefinitely unless the entities are dismantled.\n\nSCP-6533-1 instances are proven to not be mechanically operated automatons, as all machinery is destroyed after an instance forms itself. --Current research has yet to uncover the animate nature of SCP-6533-1 entities.--[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**{{[RAISA FILE NOTE]}}** This sentence has been flagged for deletion due to outdated information. See Addendum 3.[[/span]]\n\n\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]Discovery:[[/span]] First sighting of the SCP-6533 phenomenon occured in 14/MAY/2104, when a commercial spacecraft preparing for takeoff from the Gimhea International Spaceport in New Busan, Luna Korea was affected by the anomaly. Subsequent manifestations occured in Mars, Venus, Jupiter's moons and various interstellar structures, respectively. \n\nInitial manifestations would be reported for every three months, but would later become much more frequent over time, resulting in SCP-6533 transpiring every two-to-three weeks as of the current date.\n\nCivilian response to the anomaly has been very aggressive, with a majority of the human population attempting to incapacitate the entities, despite warnings by the Foundation to handle containment to trained staff only. These attacks are theorized to have increased the frequency and severity of SCP-6533 events in the Solar System.\n\n------\n++ [[span class=\"h-span\"]]ADDENDUM 1 -- MANIFESTATIONS (SELECTED)[[/span]]\n\nThe following are three example SCP-6533 manifestations in the Solar System. For a full comprehensive list, see Document 6533-A.\n\n||||~ EVENT 6533.01 ||\n||~ Date ||~ Location ||\n||= 14/MAY/2104 ||= Gimhea International Spaceport, New Busan, Luna Korea, Earth's Moon||\n||||~ Details ||\n||||The Boeing S878 commercial spaceship of Flight 410 (New Busan -- Kyung) suddenly began activity without command by its pilots, taking off much earlier than scheduled. Passengers and staff inside were panicking as the ship seemingly flew in random directions above New Busan. As no evidence of a cyberattack on the ship's sytems was detected by Korean law enforcement, the event was suspected to be paranatural and thaumaturgists from the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ko#NPES National Paranormal Emergency Service (NPES)] were deployed to handle the situation. _\n _\nWhile the passengers were succesfully apported[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] **Apportation** â€” An occult method of instantaneous teleportation.[[/span]] to the spaceport and the ship magically restrained, the vehicle began to reshape itself into an animated sculpture of a //Columba livia domestica// (Feral Pigeon) instance, breaching out of the thaumaturgical lock. The instance proceeded to run throughout New Busan, congesting traffic and damaging buildings by flapping its \"wings\", blowing objects away. NPES members successfully terminated the entity thirty minutes later, transferring the leftover scraps to an unknown location. NPES has refused to give any further information gained on the entity, nor the location of its remains, to the Foundation.||\n||||~ EVENT 6533.89 ||\n||~ Date ||~ Location ||\n||= 27/AUG/2104 ||= Southern Troposphere, Venus||\n||||~ Details ||\n|||| The //Twilight Sky// luxury cruise spaceship, which was in the process of a five day cruise from Palmira to Concordia with 4,626 passengers and 1,473 crew members on board, started to display signs of being under an SCP-6533 event as it began controlling itself without prompt. Aware of the phenomena, //Twilight Sky// staff members quickly directed passagers towards the emergency Artificial Way leading back to the Palmira Port before the ship would alter itself.  Despite their efforts, a hundred and fifty-six passengers failed to exit the vehicle and presumably died by crushing as the ship reshaped itself into a form resembling a //Falco rusticolus// (gyrfalcon). _\n _\nThe SCP-6533-1 instance began flying towards Concordia with exceptional speed, forcing Foundation assets in the planet to order a missile strike upon the entity. The SCP-6533-1 specimen was successfully hit and fell down into a lava field on the surface of Venus. Despite this, it remains active, attempting to launch itself off from the molten rock.||\n||||~ EVENT 6533.254 ||\n||~ Date ||~ Location ||\n||= 05/NOV/2104 ||= Asteroid Mine, West-South Asteroid Belt||\n||||~ Details ||\n|||| An automatic mining unit began to drill onto infrastructures and nearby manned ships. Initially assumed to be a glitch in the unit's system, mining operations were cancelled after the unit reshaped itself into a //Campephilus principalis// (ivory-billed woodpecker) form, using the drill as a \"beak.\" _\n _\nWhile the mining company responsible for the operation advised everyone to leave the vicinity, their miners instead attemped to destroy the entity themselves by using drilling equipment and explosives. The SCP-6533-1 specimen suffered enough damage to become inanimate, which resulted in a celebration between mining staff. The remains of the unit were melted for recycling.  ||\n\n\n------\n++ [[span class=\"h-span\"]]ADDENDUM 2 -- INTERVIEW LOG[[/span]]\n\nOn 19/FEB/2105, a Foundation armed spacecraft stationed at Triton had suffered an SCP-6533 event. After complete transformation, Task Force members claimed the entity was able to produce semi-coherent speech, using the voice synthesis of BT-020.aic, which was installed in the ship system at the time of the event. As all surveillance footage of the incident was lost due to the destruction caused by the instance, their claims could not be verified at the time. The entity (designated SCP-6533-1-442) did not speak when containment was achieved. An interview was made to confirm the existence of this ability:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]]**TRANSCRIPT -- INTERVIEW-6533.01**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n|name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a6/Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_%28large%29.jpg/240px-Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_%28large%29.jpg\n|caption= Triton, location of EVENT-6533.442.\n|width= 200px\n|aling=right]]\n\n**Date:** 20/FEB/2105 (02:53)\n\n**Location:** TRITON-Site-934\n\n**Interviewer:** Doctor Collen Minerva\n\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6533-1-442\n\n**Supervisor:** Doctor Sapphira Eponine (Research Head)\n\n**Foreword:** Doctor Minerva will be conversing with the instance through a speaker embedded in the chamber, while watching it through a surveillance camera.\n\n------\n//[Excerpt begins.]//\n\n//[SCP-6533-1-442 is seen at its chamber, pecking the wall to its left.]//\n\n**Eponine:** The set is activated.

(See Document 6533-D for further details.)\n\nThe scheduled date for the decommissioning attempt is currently being considered by the SCP-6533 research team, the Decommissioning Department and the Overseer Council.\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]\n[[collapsible show=\"UPDATE: NEW ADDENDUM FILE UPLOADED\" hide=\"@@@@\"]]\n[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[size 120%]]**REPORT -- DECOMM-6533.01**[[/size]]\n[[<]]\n------\n\n**Date:** 18/FEB/2106\n\n**Location:** Site-2460, Rhea (Saturn satellite); Site-729, Ganymede (Jupiter satellite); Site-1045, Venus; Site-692, Mars; Site-01-ARC, Greenland, Earth.\n\n**Present:** Dr. Sapphira Eponine, //et al.//\n\n------\n\n**Â«00:26:43Â»** - After Dr. Eponine contacts every commanding occultist, who are responsible for each individual ritual in a planet/moon, for confirmation of their preparation by use of TCG[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Thaumic Communication Gateways** â€” Artificially created Ways that act as a means of interstellar communication, bypassing the speed of light.[[/span]] radio, she officially declares the initiation of the decommissioning attempt. All ritual participants take position, and Eponine orders the first ritual in Rhea.\n\n= [**Omitted:** All rituals except Earthâ€™s are successfully performed without complications.]\n\n**Â«02:45:08Â»** - The final ritual commences. Dr. Eponine signals all other nearby thaumaturges to begin singing their incantations. Eponine goes to the center and takes out a bag of //Helianthus annuus// (Common sunflower) seeds.\n\n**Â«02:48:20Â»** - As Eponine proceeds to take one of the seeds, loud sounds of metal tearing gradually become audible on the surrounding area. The researcher orders a pause to the ritual when she notices.\n\n**Â«02:50:00Â»** - A large shadow emerges on the current location. Seen above the sky is a massive group of SCP-6533-1 entities approaching the site of the operation. Nearby members of ATF Rho-84 begin preparing plasma artillery equipment while ritual participants continue the ritual, although in a nervous manner, per Eponine's commands.\n\n**Â«02:53:34Â»** - After three minutes of consecutive shooting at the cloud of entities, the artillery runs out of power. Before they could recharge, the SCP-6533-1 instances reach to the perimeter of the operation and begin attacking security personnel. Dr. Eponine orders all thaumaturges to escape to the emergency bunker before the surrounding instances reach the ritual area.\n\n**Â«02:54:11Â»** - The head researcher guides all personnel to the bunker as the entities incapacitate almost all Task Force members. After all occultists have entered the bunker, Dr. Eponine begins to grab the ritual materials and sprints to the bunker.\n\n**Â«02:55:52Â»** - Before she reaches the bunker's door, a SCP-6533-1 instance blocks her path. It emits a high-volume shriek at her by use of a malfuntioning voice synthesizer, causing her to fall down and drop all items except one. The entity begins approaching the researcher while growling aggressively. Eponine closes her eyes.\n\n**Â«02:56:28Â»** - The SCP-6533-1 instance abruptly stops walking and stares.\n\n**Â«02:57:13Â»** - Eponine opens her eyes in confusion. The instance continues staring. At this point, all other instances in the area halt their attacks and stare at the doctor.\n\n**Â«02:57:36Â»** - Eponine looks around in further confusion. When she slowly stands up, the instance's head tilts slightly. She notices that the instance is not staring at her directly, but at the bag of seeds. Movement of the bag confirms this.\n\n**Â«02:57:50Â»** - The doctor opens the bag and throws four seeds in front of the entity. It begins to \"eat\" them, grabbing the seeds with its beak-shaped portion of its body and intaking them. The seeds fall out of its body through some holes on its underbelly, however the entity appears to be satisfied regardless. It brushes its head to Eponine, and she awkwardly pets the entity in return.\n\n**Â«02:59:14Â»** - Afterwards, the entity distances itself from the doctor, and it collapses into a pile of metal scrap. A different SCP-6533-1 entity approaches Eponine and stares at the bag of seeds.\n\n= [**Omitted:** Dr. Eponine and the rest of the personnel present bring available seeds to the SCP-6533-1 instances and interacts with them, until all entities became inactive.]\n\n------\n\n**Afterword:** Post-analysis of the decommissioning attempt revealed that the final ritual seems to attract overwhelming attention from SCP-6533-1 instances due to its placement on Earth, making proper execution of the exorcism impossible without extreme defensive measures. Additionally, Site-01-ARC's Scranton Reality Anchors did not mitigate the entities due to their deterioated state, especially the decomposed ontokinectic cores, which inspecting personnel had overlooked.\n\nDespite the operation's failure, Dr. Sapphira Eponine has created alternative containment procedures based off research on the attempt, theorized to be able to neutralize the anomaly in a slow but effective and cost-efficient method. The proposed procedure is filed below:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[span class=\"h-span\"]]Suggested Containment Procedures:[[/span]] Applied Task Force Rho-85 (\"Duck Fun! :D\") will respond to reports of SCP-6533 phenomena from civilians by removing current passengers and containing the affected vehicle. When it is transformed, ATF Rho-85 must commandeer seeds[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Specifically either thistle, shelled corn, peanut, safflower or sunflower seeds.[[/span]]  to the SCP-6533-1 instance until it is pacified, and interact with the anomaly playfully until it is neutralized. Most effective spots for petting include the entityâ€™s chin, cranium and back. Large construction machinery can be used as a substitute for hands, in case of encountering larger instances.\n\nThe remains of neutralized instances are to be recycled.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThese procedures have been approved for execution by the Department of Containment. Approval by Overwatch Command is pending.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6532]]] | SCP-6533 | [[[SCP-6534]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[<]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** orangbird.png\n> **Author:** Frank-2.0\n> **License:** Creative Commons CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eisvogel_kingfisher.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** ironbird.png\n> **Author:** Rob Mitchell\n> **License:** Creative Commons CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Metal_bird_sculptures_(16036563402).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** triton.png\n> **Author:** NASA / Jet Propulsion Lab / U.S. Geological Survey\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Triton_moon_mosaic_Voyager_2_(large).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]",
