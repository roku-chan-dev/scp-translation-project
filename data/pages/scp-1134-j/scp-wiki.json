No further containment measures are deemed necessary to contain SCP-1134-J.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1134-J is a roll of tan masking tape, approximately 4 cm in width. The labels on the interior of the roll suggest that it is --the bad kind-- manufactured by ██.\n\n SCP-1134-J’s anomalous properties are manifested when a human subject, henceforth referred to as SCP-1134-J-A, attempts to tear off a piece of SCP-1134-J. Instances of SCP-1134-J-A seem to be opposed to using scissors or any kind of a blade when attempting to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J.\n\nWhen SCP-1134-J-A removes a piece of SCP-1134-J, SCP-1134-J will tear at a point that SCP-1134-J-A did not intend, regardless of how much care was invested in doing so. This causes an unusually large amount of frustration in SCP-1134-J-A, often causing SCP-1134-J-A to attack SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J also seems to be impervious to all attempts to damage it by SCP-1134-J-A, and attempts to do so also seem to cause additional frustration in SCP-1134-J-A.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test log 1134-J-1\" hide=\"-Test log 1134-J-1\"]]\n__**Test SCP-1134-J-1**__\n> **Subject:** D-23867\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-23867 is placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a one-way mirror for viewing by Doctor ████. Also within the chamber is SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber.\n> \n> **Results:**\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J\n> \n> **D-23867:** Um, okay.\n> \n> //D-23867 attempts to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J, but the piece tears diagonally, forming an irregular trapezoid.// \n> \n> **D-23867:** Oh, that brand, huh? That always [EXPLETIVE] happens!\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** D-23867, please attempt to remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.\n> \n> **D-23867:** Yeah, well [EXPLETIVE] that. \n> \n> //D-23867 complies, but SCP-1134-J once again tears diagonally.//\n> \n> **D-23867:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! \n> \n> //D-23867 throws SCP-1134-J at the opposite wall of the containment chamber.//\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** D-23867, please refrain from throwing SCP-1134-J, or you will be removed from the testing chamber. Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.\n> \n> **D-235867:** [EXPLETIVE] THAT! YOU [EXPLETIVE]! \n> \n> //D-23867 slows his breathing, and paces around the room. After 3 minutes, D-23867 once again attempts to remove a piece from SCP-1134-J, slowly.//\n> \n> **D-23867:**  Okay, this time I’m gonna get it. \n> \n> //D-23867 begins to slowly tear SCP-1134-J, but then it tears slightly diagonally.//\n> \n> **D-23867:** No no no no no no no no no no no no no…\n> \n> //D-23867 re-adjusts his grip, and continues to tear SCP-1134-J, but SCP-1134-J tears perpendicular to the tear D-23867 was attempting to make//\n> \n> **D-23867:** [EXPLETIVE]! \n> \n> //D-23867 throws SCP-1134-J against the opposite wall in the containment chamber, then strikes the wall adjacent to him. Later examination of D-23867 showed that his wrist broke due to this strike.//\n> \n> **D-23867:** [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! \n> \n> //D-23867, clutching his wrist, walks to SCP-1134-J, then begins to repeatedly stomp on SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **D-23867:** [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-23867 is forcefully removed from the testing chamber by two D-class personnel, but D-23867 breaks free and begins striking SCP-1134-J repeatedly. The two D-class personnel once again grab D-23867, and, with greater force this time, remove D-23867 from the testing chamber.//\n> \n> **D-23867:** [EXPLETIVE] YOU, YOU LITTLE [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE], [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU! [EXPLETIVE] ALL OF YOU [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-23867 is removed from the testing area. The subject appears to be extremely frustrated, however returns to an ordinary psychological state after 14 hours. Post-test examination of SCP-1134-J showed that no damage was inflicted on SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **Analysis:** //SCP-1134-J seems to cause extreme frustration in those attempting to remove a piece from it. Further experiments are required to find the extent of SCP-1134-J’s “unrippablity”.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test log 1134-J-2\" hide=\"-Test log 1134-J-2\"]]\n__**Test SCP-1134-J-2**__\n> **Subject:** D-49856\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-49856 is placed in a standard humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with a one-way mirror for viewing by Doctor ████. Also within the chamber is SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, and a standard pair of scissors.\n> \n> **Results:**\n> \n> **D-49856:** A roll of tape? I can’t wait to see what this one does…\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** Please remove a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.\n> \n> //D-49856 complies, and similar to the previous test, SCP-1134-J tears diagonally, causing frustration in D-49856.//\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-49856 attempts again to remove a piece from SCP-1134-J, without being instructed to do so. This attempt is once again met with failure, as a tear forms that is approximately 12 cm long, along one edge of SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! WHAT THE [EXPLETIVE] KIND OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] IS THIS?!\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** D-49856, please try to stay calm. Use the scissors we have supplied you to cut a rectangular piece of SCP-1134-J.\n> \n> **D-49856:** OH, [EXPLETIVE] THAT! If I can’t rip a [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] piece of tape, then what the [EXPLETIVE] am I [EXPLETIVE] good for?\n> \n> //D-49856 kicks the supplied pair of scissors to the far corner of the testing chamber, and once again attempts to tear a piece off of SCP-1134-J. The tear previously made grew an additional 14 cm as this piece was torn off, causing D-49856 to become extremely agitated and angry.//\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-49856 attempts to rip SCP-1134-J into two pieces. After 12 seconds without success, D-49856 holds SCP-1134-J to the wall of the testing chamber, and repeatedly strikes SCP-1134-J. None of these measures seemed to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** D-49856, please stop your attacks towards SCP-1134-J, or you will be removed from the testing chamber.\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] THAT! I [EXPLETIVE]... I… Why am I so mad?\n> \n> //D-49856 puts SCP-1134-J back on the floor of the testing chamber, and sits down in the eastern corner.//\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** Please remove a rectagular-\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] off! I’m [EXPLETIVE] trying to… AAAH! Stop it! \n> \n> //After 8 minutes, and statements from D-49856 was “cooled off” D-49856 attempts with her hands to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J tears at a slight angle, but this seems to cause only minor annoyance with D-49856. She attempts again, slowly, to remove a piece of SCP-1134-J. However it tears in the middle, separating SCP-1134-J into two halves. This causes D-49856 to once again attack SCP-1134-J, this time striking it repeatedly with her head. Several other D-class personnel enter the test chamber to intervene. D-49856 grabs one of the D-class’s firearms and repeatedly shoots SCP-1134-J at a range of approximately 1.4 meters. Of the 7 shots fired at SCP-1134-J, 5 are confirmed hits on SCP-1134-J. The D-class then forcefully grab D-49856, and remove her from the testing chamber.//\n> \n> **D-49856:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! I’LL [EXPLETIVE] KILL THAT [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU ALL, YOU [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! [EXPLETIVE] YOU, DOCTOR ████! [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-49856 is placed into temporary containment for psychological evaluation. 5 hours after being removed from the testing chamber, D-49856 seems to have returned to an ordinary psychological state. The 5 hits on SCP-1134-J seem to have had no effect.//\n> \n> **Analysis:** //SCP-1134-J-A seems to choose against using scissors when cutting SCP-1134-J. SCP-1134-J-A is confirmed to have an emotional response to SCP-1134-J. Also, SCP-1134-J is extremely resistant to damage. Further testing is required to see how indestructible SCP-1134-J is.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Test log 1134-J-3\" hide=\"-Test log 1134-J-3\"]]\n\n//Doctor ████: “Is further testing concerning SCP-1134-J’s indestructibility approved?”//\n\n//O5-██:”Yes”.//\n\n__**Test SCP-1134-J-3**__\n> **Subject:** D-99214\n> \n> **Procedure:** D-99214 is placed in a reinforced humanoid containment chamber, outfitted with several reinforcing steel plates lining the chamber. Also within the chamber is an of SCP-1134-J, placed on floor of the containment chamber, several aluminum bats, axes, handguns, rifles, knives, and hand grenades. \n> \n> **Results:**\n> \n> **Doctor ████:** D-99214, You may attempt to destroy SCP-1134-J in any way you deem necessary.\n> \n> **D-99214:** Um, okay.\n> \n> //D-99214 takes the an axe from the ground of the testing chamber and attempts to cut SCP-1134-J. Despite a direct hit, no damage seemed to be caused to SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **D-99214:** [EXPLETIVE]! How did it do that? \n> \n> //D-99214 is visibly frustrated, and once again hits SCP-1134-J with the selected axe, again with no effect. D-99214 then changes weapons to an AK-47 assault rifle, and opens fire on SCP-1134-J. Due to the angle of cameras in the testing chamber, no shots are confirmed hits on SCP-1134-J, but post-test analysis of audio showed that 37 shots were fired. Again, no damage is visible on SCP-1134-J.//\n> \n> **D-99214:** [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE]! WHAT A LOAD OF [EXPLETIVE]! I’M [EXPLETIVE] DONE WITH [EXPLETIVE] THIS PIECE OF [EXPLETIVE]!\n> \n> //D-99214 throws the previously selected AK-47 at SCP-1134-J, striking it directly. Then, D-99214 selects a hand grenade from the available arsenal and throws it at SCP-1134-J. It detonates 0.6 meters from SCP-1134-J, and sends it towards the far wall of the chamber. D-99214 is unharmed, and then proceeds to attack SCP-1134-J with a knife provided. With every strike on SCP-1134-J, D-99214 grows more frustrated and angry.//\n> \n> **D-99214:** I’M GOING TO [EXPLETIVE] KILL THIS [EXPLETIVE] [EXPLETIVE] THING! I-\n> \n> //D-99214 suddenly falls to the floor of the testing chamber. Several D-class personnel are sent in to investigate, and D-99214 is then removed to from the testing chamber. D-99214 is declared deceased by sudden cardiac arrest upon removal from the testing chamber, and is then removed from the site. Post-test examination revealed no damage on the surface of SCP-1134-J//\n> \n>  **Analysis:** None of the aforementioned  tools/weapons seem to have an effect on the structural integrity of SCP-1134-J.\n> \n> //Doctor ████: “Damn it.”//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n //Doctor ████: “What can I say, the damn thing’s annoying as [EXPLETIVE].”//\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
