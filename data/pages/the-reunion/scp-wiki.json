Runes adorned every inch of the colossal mass, their meaning indecipherable to either her or the researcher, as the rustling of a clear plastic bag emanated through the small room.\n\n”Done,” the agent said, snapping the researcher right out of his thoughts, eyes averting to the bag in her hands. ”Let’s get out of here.”\n\nThe sweat dripping from the sides of his face, wiping them away with the back of his sleeve, they made their way to the giant vault door standing tall in front of them, able to make even the toughest minds faulter. The researcher gulped.\n\nAs the agent pulled out her access card, almost fumbling it in her hands, she pressed it against the small scanner, just barely illuminated by the lights up above.\n\nThe researcher could feel his heart beating in his ears, as his hands and palms felt sweaty, eyes fixated on the little screen on the scanner--\n\n//There was a soft creaking noise, similar to a sound he had not thought about in decades.// The researcher was reminded of an incident in his childhood, where his parents would still be at work late in the night, an only child, alone in the dead of night.\n\nThe door to the attic was just across the hall from him, next to the bathroom. Every time he had to go, he would have passed it, looming in the corner of his vision. On one night, he would pass the door, like any other time, but there was something... odd. Just not quite //right//.\n\nHe had heard noises from the other side, what seemed to be breathing and distant mumbling. He was young, too scared to do anything about it, so he just locked himself in the bathroom, and remained until late at night his parents came home and found him huddled behind the shower curtains.\n\nNever did he find out what had made those noises, if they even existed at all, but that innate sense of dread had remained with him in all these years, and sometimes he thought he really just went looney tunes.\n\nThe creaking reminded him of that door, even he had never entered it as a child, nor as an adult in the final days before the house’s demolition; he always imagined it to sound exactly like this.\n\nIt came to a halt against the walls of the black stony cube, as the low rattle of heavy chains hitting upon the floor rang throughout, as the entity within set its eyes upon the agent and researcher, its breathing heavy, almost laboured.\n\nThe researcher recited his final prayers, as an indescribable metallic sound rang out, and the noise of panicked gunshots filled the air.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nIt remained silent, still, as it always did, as it always had done.

Things that they’d like to remember were joyous moments in their lives -- family, friends, other momentous events. But then there was the opposite, of harm, of trauma, useless bits of information governing their actions, some unwanted, yet they still remembered them.\n\nIt //only// stored valuable memories; data to improve itself, understand the world around it better in its little box, with the only contact being the regular scheduled interviews -- it learned as much from them, as its captors learned from it.\n\nSo it thought it odd that there was no interview, the seconds trickling into minutes, the minutes into hours.
