Trimetzer (Level 4 Administrative Site Director) faced accidental exposure to SCP-3312 when he was reviewing the Recovered SCP Report from the Foundation's Web crawlers (which one of the Agents failed to notice a Memetic Hazard was inside the Report file).\n\nAfter learning he had been exposed to SCP-3312, Trimetzer immediately attempted to conceal the effect and left the site under the guise of a Shift Change.\n\nShortly after Trimetzer left the site, Site Director Rosstova searched Site Director Trimetzer's Intranet Log and immediately noticed the SCP-3312 Memetic Hazard and contacted ATF, suspecting that Site Director Trimetzer had already been exposed to SCP-3312.\n\nThe Following is the Transcript of Site Director Rosstova and with MTF-S-88 (\"Animal Control\"):\n\n> **Rosstova:** \"This is Site Director Rosstova of Site-02 to MTF-S-88, do you read me over?\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"This is Commander █████, go ahead Site Director.\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"Commander, we got a problem, there is an SCP-3312 Memetic Hazard in Site-02.\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"Site Director Rosstova, Say Again?\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"There is an SCP-3312 Memetic Hazard at Site-02, requesting MTF-S-88 to Site-02 Immediately!\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"Roger, we are heading to Site-02, ETA: 10 Minutes.\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"And get a team to search the area near Site-02...\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"May I ask why?\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"It's Trimetzer... He is the First Memetic Victim.\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"What?! Where is he?\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"He Left the Site...\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"Shit, Where did he go?\"\n> **Rosstova:** \"He may have left for his place of residence...\"\n> **MTF-S-88 Commander █████:** \"Ok, we will get a team to find and secure Trimetzer, but I have to warn you... O5 Council will not be happy.\"\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ Attempt 1 ~ Attempt to Secure the Threat\n\nAfter Site Director Rosstova contacted MTF-S-88, an MTF-S-88 team was sent to Quarantine, possibly Site-02 personnel who may have received the SCP-3312 Report File. In the meantime, a separate MTF-S-88 team was sent to Trimetzer's Home residence to capture him and possible Memetic Victims.\n\nHowever, upon arriving and inspecting the Residence of the Trimetzer Household, they found that Trimetzer was not there. Currently, there are several intel revealing that Trimetzer has already shown signs of Stage 1 to Stage 3:\n* Trimetzer's Personal Laptop contains a registered account to a common Furry Website named FurAffinity; multiple evidence of Posts shows that Trimetzer is already under the Influence of SCP-3312.\n* Multiple Packaging of Cereal that has few art of several Anthormorphic Instances of SCP-3312; one of the Packaging Art was circled (A Protogen Design)\n\nSite-02 was informed about the Incident and they have confirmed that Site Director Trimetzer has already gone rouge with a Memetic Hazard.\n\nThe O5 Council has been informed and was dissatisfied and in fear, as seeing the Evidence of Stage 1 and Stage 3 from Trimetzer's Home Residence, the Council has temporarily classified Andrew Trimetzer as PoI-3312-1.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ Informational Update ~ PoI-3312-1 Found.\n\nTrimetzer was found at a Registered Hotel in Michigan, and after finding out the nearest Foundation Site is Site-19, they decided to ask Site-19 to send a Recon Team to monitor Site Director Trimetzer's Current Behavior and determine when is the correct time to Secure Trimetzer.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ Day 1 ~ Observation of Trimetzer\n\nReceiving the Message from Site-02, Site-19's Intelligence Agency Members then observed Trimetzer from a Vantage Point. Where they record the following Information:\n* PoI-3312-1 bought a Demonic Protogen Fursuit (Worth 600,000 USD), a possible sign of Stage 5.\n* PoI-3312-1 only exits Domicil at a fixed timing of 11:48:00 (11:48 A.M) to buy daily necessities.\n* PoI-3312-1 is frequently checking his Mobile Phone, possibly inspecting for the next convention.\n\nAfter the Following Information was given to Site-02, the Decision to capture Trimetzer was made by both O5-██ and Site Director Rosstova.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ Day 2 ~ Bait Planning\n\nAfter finding out a way to secure Trimetzer, MTF-S-88 later devised a plan. Which requires hosting a \"Furry Convention\" at a suitable containment area to lure and contain Trimetzer.\n\nThe Plan goes as follows according to MTF-S-88's Commander █████:\n# Multiple Foundation Containment Specialists will be disguised as \"Furries\" to conceal the bait\n# If the Said Target is within view, Specialists are not to approach the said target as it is possible he may be already Stage 6.\n# Once the Target is in a Cornered Position, an attempt to capture is authorized.\n# If the Said Target attempts to escape, Containment Specialists are to pursue and capture PoI-3312-1 without any casualties.\n\nThe Plan was reviewed by O5 Council members and was approved.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ Day 3 ~ The Bait\n\nThe Foundation has set up a made-up convention at Michigan's Museum of Historical Art, which they bribed the Museum Director to make up this coverup.\n\nThe Pre-Operation Goes as Followed\n# Foundation Containment Specialists that were selected to be \"Convention Attendees\" were given SCP-3312 Disguises.\n# A Separate Foundation Containment Team is stationed outside to prepare for necessary containment\n\nAt 10:45:56 (10:45 A.M.), PoI-3312-1 arrived at Michigan's Museum of Historical Art wearing a Demonic Protogen Fursuit.\n\nA Containment Specialist informed the teams that the Target had entered the trap, making all Containment Specialists at the Venue Ready to capture.\n\nAt 17:34:28 (5:34 P.M.), Orders to capture PoI-3312-1 were made. However, PoI-3312-1 noticed the Containment Teams and immediately attempted to flee containment, he then grabbed a Foundation Issued M1911 from his bag and fired a shot. Hitting a Containment Specialist in the leg.\n\nAt 18:00:35 (6:00 P.M.), an additional Containment Specialist sedated PoI-3312-1 using Tranquilizer Darts and PoI-3312-1 was immediately restrained and brought to Site-990 for further analysis.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n++++ After-Action Report\n\nThe Foundation was baffled when they found out a single Memetic Contaminated SCP Report was the cause of this 3-Day Incident. After the News was brought to the O5 Council and Ethics Committee, the SCP Foundation Web Crawler Division is currently under Investigation on orders of O5-██ and the Ethics Committee for possible negligence.\n\nCurrently, PoI-3312-1 is the current SCP-3312 Subject that the Foundation managed to keep for research studies, while he already negated effects from SCP-3312 but has remnants that are declared impossible to remove from said subject.\n\nDecisions to reclassify SCP-3312 are still under way.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**END OF INCIDENT REPORT**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n> May the Webcrawlers be punished for causing Site Director Trimetzer to become a SCP-3312 Survivor.",
