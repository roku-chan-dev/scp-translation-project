All replicas and resultant productions be explicitly documented and abide by the same confidentiality terms with SCP-8848.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8848 is a pair of induction coils (interchangeably designated -A and -B) that are identical in shape, weight, and other physical properties, rendering them isotropic and unable to distinguish when exchanging with the other.\n\nSCP-8848-A and -B both function normally and exhibit qualities similar to common electromagnets and induction coils, which can electrify other charged bodies by inducing electromotive force in their circuits within their fields of magnetic influence.\n\nHowever, the mutual induction between SCP-8848-A and -B perpetuates when their distance drew farther, and seems to last irrelevant to the actual distance. The intertwinement also cannot be disrupted by common means of electromagnetic screening or other blockages, such as metal containers and webs. The induction between -A and -B works timelessly and instantaneously, which means, unlike common coils in transformers, the current and voltage in -A and -B unconditionally run in sync, rendering them transcending the principle of locality[[footnote]]A property that physical interactions only take effect within a local adjacent scope.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Experiment Logs:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Approaches:** SCP-8848-A was transported to Site-CN-34, 126██ km in direct distance across the Earth from SCP-8848-B, then put into a reinforced containment unit with a lining of telepathic shielding alloy. After test requirements were coordinated, a versatile weak current generator was applied to SCP-8848-A; a multimeter was connected to SCP-8848-B.\n\n**Outcomes:** Either on direct currents or intermittent, alternating currents, SCP-8848 worked as well as nothing to do with the shielding methods. SCP-8848-A was later sent back to be re-contained with its counterpart.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Approaches:** During an outer space expedition, it was requested that SCP-8848-B be taken to at least outside the Karman line[[footnote]]Usually known as the highest border of the Earth's atmosphere at around 100 km above the ground.[[/footnote]], and test its ability to surpass an extreme distance and electromagnetic distortion from the ionosphere and space radiations, while SCP-8848-A was in its regular place.\n\n**Outcomes:** The spaceship went beyond the Moon after 7 days. A radio modulator used to generate electric currents by audio input was connected to SCP-8848-B, and the expedition team spoke to the ground control via this. The conversation is transcribed below, with impertinent information removed.\n----\n**Squadron:** Here it is. Here it is. You can just leave alone the wave filter. We don't need it for now. //(volume up)// Command, can you hear us?\n\n**Control:** Yes, we can hear you. The voice is clear.\n\n**Squadron:** What about the signal fidelity? As compared to the normal channel?\n\n**Control:** One moment. //(pauses)// It was... pretty fine. Uh, the voice is somehow clearer coming from the coil.\n\n**Squadron:** Can you confirm the time-lapse? We are speaking from two different channels, right?\n\n**Control:** One second. It's one second faster than from the coil.\n\n**Squadron:** Oh my gosh. //(clattering sound)// Do you know what does this mean, Harrison? //(Harrison was speaking.)// It is likely exceeding the speed of light. You don't know what this means, Arvin.\n\n**Control:** We've got that. Likely this will persist even later on your way. Congrats!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Approaches:** A copy of SCP-8848 was generated by [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-038 SCP-038]. The four coil instances were then cross-tested in all 6 combinations.\n\n**Outcomes:** The two new coils did not respond either to the original -A or -B, but instead reacted between themselves and inherited the property intact. This phenomenon was noticed. Afterward, all replications of SCP-8848 are to be tagged respectively in pairs to avoid confusion.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Approaches:** One duplication of SCP-8848 was disassembled and reverted to copper wire, then remolded and weaved as a thin-stranded conductor to be tested.\n[[include component:image-block | name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/maxwellism/QI_Coil_1.png| caption=One of the new coils weaved by thinner threads of copper.|width=100%|position=center]]\n**Outcomes:** The twisted wires show their property of extended mutual induction as formerly. It was then hypothesized that the anomalous characteristics of SCP-8848 probably originated from its raw material, which is chemically indistinct from common copper but seemingly bears unknown qualities.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Approaches:** A project aiming at utilizing SCP-8848 was initiated based on previous experiments, which offered concrete evidence for facilitating the material itself. Pairs of integrated digital chips were manufactured using the material, with expectations of developing a distance-proof high-resolution electronic communication technology.\n\n**Outcomes:** Two massive integrated circuits could synchronize their status if only corded respectively by intertwined SCP-8848 instances, while the continuity of wires is preserved.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Level 4/8848 clearance only.\" hide=\"▽ Credentials verified.\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Proposal for the Project Telekinetics\n[[/=]]\nProject Telekinetics is developed based on SCP-8848, a pair of electromagnetic coils that are identical in shape and functionality. They have the interchangeability to duplicate electronic signals within a single-narrative three-dimensional universe, e.g., our baseline reality, while bearing no downsides of time-lapse or distancing attenuation.\n\nProject Telekinetics (abbr. TEKI) is to introduce a new technology to build an efficient brain-to-body interface. Preliminary steps will include:\n* An authorized Foundation personnel will serve as Side A.\n* An artificially produced, congenitally brainless (yet the body and autonomic nervous system still function normally) humanoid or a human-like robot that is capable of interpreting and performing actions based on human neural signals will serve as Side B.\n* A neuro-electronic chip will be implanted attached to the spinal cord of Side A to read the neural impulse originating from the subject's free will. Another chip will be installed to receive the signal from Side A to direct the action to Side B, controlling it to perform the action.\n* The connection will then automatically be established by SCP-8848, to enable Side A to control the body motion and simultaneously get sensational feedback from it.\n* After the connection is established, Side A will be put into a deep hibernation (vegetative) state, temporarily disconnecting from their own body's motion and senses. Therefore, an exterior life-supporting system may be necessary for this practice.\n----\nThe potentials of Project Telekinesis include:\n* **Rejuvenate:** Revitalize body disabilities and alleviate sufferings from diseases.\n* **Expedition:** Ensure the utmost safety of personnel exploring anomalies, Groups of Interests, and other uncategorized places/spacetime/objects.\n* **Research:** Potentiate deep-going research into the modus operandi of human physiology and the relationship between mind and body.\n* **Weaponize:** Train Side B subjects as armed forces to be deployed in military and violent actions to protect Foundation employees from being injured in physical combat. As concerned about the value of SCP-8848 and worries about the disclosure of relevant technologies, this potential scenario is currently not considered for application until its efficiency and security can be well guaranteed.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8847]]] | SCP-8848 | [[[SCP-8849]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Coil_with_ferrite_core_from_dimmer.jpg\n> **Author:** Pittigrilli\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [*https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Coil_with_ferrite_core_from_dimmer.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** QI_Coil_1.png\n> **Author:** Nostrils.ua\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [*https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:QI_Coil_1.png Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
