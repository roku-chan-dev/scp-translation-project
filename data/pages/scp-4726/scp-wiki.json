Consumption of SCP-4726-1 is currently permitted but discouraged. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4726 is a tall, obese human male of Hispanic descent. The subject has been diagnosed with hyperhidrosis.[[footnote]] A condition causing abnormally excessive sweating involving the extremities, underarms, and face, usually unrelated to body temperature or exercise. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-4726 secretes an opaque liquid substance (hereafter referred to as SCP-4726-1) at a rate of 1.4 liters per hour. The chemical composition of SCP-4726-1 consists of caffeine, sugar, taurine, and other folic acids. Consumption of SCP-4726-1 influences the neurotransmitters for norepinephrine, dopamine, and acetylcholine in a similar process as non-anomalous caffeinated beverages. \n\nConsuming large quantities of SCP-4726-1 (typically over 2 liters within 24 hours) has resulted in arrhythmia, hypertension, and in extreme cases, cardiac arrest.\n\n\n**Addendum.4726.01:** On the 22nd of April, 2019, SCP-4726 informed personnel it had become aware of a secondary property of SCP-4726-1.
