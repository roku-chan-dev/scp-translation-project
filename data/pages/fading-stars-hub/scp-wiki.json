In this world every idea manifests in a world of our subconsciousness, and it is our belief in these concepts and ideas that keeps them alive.\n\nIn this canon, all the gods are very much real, and there are gods for everything you can think of. These gods are fading away one by one, and the Foundation doesn't know why. As these gods fade, so too does what they represent. People are losing their ability to dream, to create, to exist as humans. It's up to the Foundation, an ever pragmatic beast, to stop this before humanity is past the point of no return by any means necessary.\n\nThere are a myriad of gods out there. If you can think of something, there's a god for it of some kind (sometimes even multiple!). These gods are contradictory, fickle, and unique individuals in their own right. Potential authors are encouraged to write their own god for this setting if they want to, there are no limits!\n\nAs a whole, Fading Stars leans more towards fantasy as a canon. That said there is still plenty of sci-fi, just be aware that the sci-fi itself still tends to be more magical in nature and based less in hard science. The world in this setting is innately magical, and that magic exists in everything everywhere. That said, you're free to explore any genre you want to if you choose to write something!\n\nWhile there are a variety of genres and themes for the Fading Stars canon and authors are encouraged to explore whatever interests them the most, there are a few central ideas to highlight--\n\n* **Culture is valuable and needs to be respected** -- The gods of the Dreamscape come from a wide variety of origins. While several are completely original creations, beings from real world mythologies are also represented here. Authors are encouraged to represent a variety of real world backgrounds, and are encouraged to take their time to really research these gods and mythologies so they are represented well.\n\n* **Colonial practices wipe out systems of belief, and as a result, cultures** -- The main conflict of the Dreamscape setting is based in no small part on colonial practices actively decimating real world cultures and suppressing their traditions and mythologies in favor of the colonizer's. In this setting, traditions are largely recognized as important for creating and maintaining a cultural identity.\n\n* **The divine is in everything** -- There is a god for literally everything, even that wad of gum under your desk. While this setting doesn't necessarily demand that you see the beauty in everything, it does ask that you take a moment to appreciate the things that make the world exist in the first place.\n\n* **The Foundation is a complex organization, but the average person is good** -- The Foundation in this setting is a pragmatic beast. It seems kind on the surface, but in the end it does the things it does for its personal benefit. That said, the individual people working for the Foundation are, on average, sincerely good people who want to do the right thing. They're all individuals much like any god, with their own goals and beliefs, but there are very few people within the Foundation that are truly evil. When writing the Foundation, don't be afraid to embrace the idea of systemic failings and systemic issues.\n\n* **The future is uncertain, it's your choices that decide it** -- You never know what tomorrow brings. Some have made peace with that, and accept what they see as inevitable. Others are constantly striving to change their fate. In the end one thing will remain true, and that's the fact that our actions today impact the world we see tomorrow. Let's leave a better one for those who come after us.\n\n* **Life can be bittersweet, but there's always an inkling of hope** -- Several articles in this setting are known for their bittersweet endings, but it's important to remember that all of them have a sense of hope in them. Fading Stars is not intended to be a grimdark setting. While stories can be sad, there should always be a sense that hope is always there. That doesn't mean you need to write something bittersweet either-- articles can have any tone that you want!\n\n* **The pursuit of perfection is a fool's endeavor** -- Especially prevalent in the Deus Est Machina series. The idea of perfection and any attempts to attain it are innately flawed and impossible to meet. Perfection does not exist, and attempting to attain it is innately a dangerous thing to do. A long, happy life is one where we make peace with our beautiful imperfections. \n\nThe most important thing in the end is to be creative and have fun. This is a canon about ideas and imagination, so let your own run wild!\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Dreamscape]]\n[[=]]\n++ What is the Dreamscape?\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Dreamscape has existed since humanity was first capable of complex thought, the world of our subconscious. It's the place everyone visits in their dreams, and the place that all of our ideas and thoughts take form. If you've thought of it, that idea exists //somewhere// in the Dreamscape.\n\nThe Dreamscape as a space exists as a world with dream logic. If you sincerely believe something can happen, it happens in there. As a result it's difficult to navigate and even harder to map out properly. All that's known for certain is that areas near entrances tend to be more \"normal\", relatively speaking, and become increasingly more surreal and bizarre the further you travel.\n\nAs stated, it is accessed by everyone when they fall asleep, but to actually explore it properly with your physical body, you'll need to find a different way in. There are several methods of varying levels of success, but the most consistent method employed by the Foundation is blood magic. By drawing a sigil of blood on a reflective surface and giving a little chant, one can enter the Dreamscape properly in their physical body.\n\nThat isn't to say there aren't plenty of ways to get //out//. Things leave the Dreamscape all the time, but it tends to be in limited numbers and in limited places. Places of extreme cultural or religious significance to people tend to have a thinner barrier between reality and dreams. Not only does it make it easier for a normal person to potentially fall into the Dreamscape in these places, it also makes it easier for things from the Dreamscape to get out.\n\nOverall the Dreamscape itself is limited only by your imagination in a very literal sense. It can be as fantastical or mundane as you want it to be.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Gods and Monsters]]\n[[=]]\n++ Denizens of the Human Mind\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Dreamscape itself is the origin point of several fantastical beings. Some of these beings are known as gods, goddesses, divinities, etc. Some are familiar to humanity as a whole, being the divine beings that appear in various global cultures and mythologies. Others are... less familiar, being relatively new. In the end, though, the divine hold great power over their domains, whatever that domain may be. That also means that multiple gods claiming the same domain may find themselves in conflict with one another.\n\nGods themselves come in all shapes and sizes. There's also a god for every concept you can possibly think of. For example, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6059 Botulae, SCP-6059] is the god of the ball pit... specifically the one that it's in. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7679 Chuck Storms, SCP-7679], is the god of weather //specifically// for the eastern United States. Meanwhile you'll also see more traditional gods pulled directly from real world history and myth. For example, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8585 Daždźboh, SCP-8585], is still a Slavic solar deity. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-squirrel Ratatoskr] is still the Norse messenger of Yggdrasil.\n\nYou can identify a god through their sigil, a magic symbol that represents them and holds a bit of their power. Mages can even use these sigils to channel a god's power for a period of time, performing all sorts of magical feats.\n\nGods are kept alive through the worship that humans provide to them. Worship can take many forms. It can be the traditional type of worship you're thinking of-- going to a religious site and praying, offering animal sacrifices, etc. It could also be more nontraditional means, like [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-squirrel feeding an animal in a park]. You may not even know you're worshipping a god! Sometimes simply saying their name is enough to keep them around for another day.\n\nWhile gods are born from the Dreamscape, they don't necessarily stay there forever. Throughout human history, gods have entered our reality and mingled among humans. Likewise, monsters from within the Dreamscape have also escaped and wrecked havoc on the world. As a result, the Foundation has been working to formalize agreements between itself and the divine. Gods that don't risk lifting the veil are allowed to exist in our reality under close observation by the Foundation, while those who would risk revealing the anomalous to the world are kept within the Dreamscape itself. If they violate this agreement, they risk becoming just another contained anomaly. Several have already met this fate.\n\nOne thing this canon aims for is for anyone to add their own god to it. While authors are encouraged to pull from real world cultures and history to help represent more cultures and histories from around the world, you're also encouraged to make your own original god if you feel inspired to. While there are ongoing storylines in this setting, there's nothing wrong with a one off article just about one specific god.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab The Gods are Dying]]\n[[=]]\n++ Death of the Divine\n[[/=]]\n\nWhile there are a myriad of divine beings in the Dreamscape and they're all different from one another, they all have one thing in common-- all gods are dying. Some are dying faster than others, but all of them are dying.\n\nFor some this is natural. Certain gods have never been \"popular\" in the real world so to speak, their mythologies and histories never being particularly present in the wider subconscious. They've been fading for years, and are acutely aware that their time is coming. How they respond to this varies from god to god, but they've known for some time that their death was near.\n\nFor others, however, this is not a natural death. Humanity is forgetting gods that should not be fading, and even the most \"popular\" gods are beginning to feel themselves fading. This is beginning to incite a panic in both the Dreamscape and within the Foundation. The Foundation's accords with the divine still within the Dreamscape is beginning to fail, as more and more gods seek ways to escape into reality and take worship by force-- a return to the early years of human history. Others seek to work alongside the Foundation to investigate why this is happening in the first place, and others still have sought to extend their lives through less... conventional means.\n\nWhen a god dies its soul lingers, at least for a bit. Regardless of where they die, their soul is sent to the Dreamscape to wander, burning out the last remains of its life until it fades entirely. Think of this like the last embers in a dying candle-- they're still there, but any moment it will go out. During this time another god can claim this soul for their own, and in doing so claim part of the god's name and power. This practice is considered extremely taboo, but more and more gods are considering this as a way to stay alive for just a bit longer, to claim a bit more worship. One of the Foundation's goals is to recover the souls of dead gods before they fade entirely or are claimed by another, as in dragging it back to reality they can revive that god. This is a temporary measure, but it's enough to stave off disaster for another day.\n\nOnce a god's soul fades, so too does what it represented. Every god represents a concept, or at least a piece of it. This can have a wide variety of consequences-- the sun may shine a little less, humanity may forget what something was, or the weather itself may be thrown violently out of whack.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Site-58]]\n[[=]]\n++ Foundation Site-58\n[[/=]]\n\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-58 Site-58] was founded by a being named [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6404 Tallakant] with the initial goal of reconnecting humanity to the divine. Tallakant envisioned a world where all of the divine could walk alongside humanity. They hid this goal from the Foundation, knowing that the Foundation would never support such a mission. As expected, when the Foundation discovered this, they felt threatened. They feared Tallakant's nature as a hivemind, and they feared that Tallakant was planning a divine takeover of the world. In response, Tallakant was wiped out... though one may have survived.\n\nSite-58 itself is designed for the care of sentient anomalies. In many cases, this involves the divine from the Dreamscape, though there are plenty of sapient anomalies that are not divine in any way that wind up in 58's containment. 58 also allows for anomalous staff, with several precautions in place to properly monitor and control them. They work hand in hand with the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/integration-program-hub Integration Program.]\n\nSite-58 is proof of the Foundation's pragmatism. The initial vision presented by Tallakant was valid- the more relaxed conprocs meant less breaches and less wasted funds and resources. As such it lives on, steadily working towards the eventual goal of integrating sapient anomalies into the world beyond the veil.\n\nSite-58 does not treat its staff notably well. Director Scarborough is an egoistic ass, and the Foundation itself is exhausting to work for. Stories focused on site staff will typically reflect real world working environments- perfectly imperfect and sometimes even abusive.\n\nMany wonder why Site-58 has such a robust .aic program. The Foundation is no fool at the end of the day, and they like to consider a myriad of options and plans for any situation that threatens humanity as a whole. Should the Foundation be unable to save the gods... why not simply make their own? Who knows, perhaps [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7999 someone finally gave them the tech needed to do just that.]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Characters]]\n[[=]]\n++ Characters\n[[/=]]\n\nAs this is a still growing setting, the list of properly established characters is still fairly small.

That's awesome! This canon is always open and welcome to new submissions!\n\nThe biggest advice for new authors is to take time to read some things from the setting first. Familiarize yourself with the material that already exists, and think about what themes and styles you see on display. Use that as a place to jump off from.\n\nDon't limit yourself to what's already established! If it doesn't break the canon, feel free to explore and expand ideas that already exist. There is a lot of empty space to fill still, so don't be afraid to fill it!\n\nIf you're really stuck on where to start, try writing a god! One of the things I want this setting to encourage is users coming up with their own characters to fill it. Like I said there's a god for everything-- do you want to come up with a god of tables? A god of online fights? Perhaps even a god of writing canons? Go for it!\n\nThe rules of this setting are fast and loose for a reason. This setting is designed for you to be able to put nearly any story into it should you want to! There are only a few rules/recommendations for when you want to write something-\n\n**1. Check out a few existing articles!** This goes without saying, but reading other things set within this setting will help you better understand what's going on here. This can even be a jumping off point for your own ideas!\n\n**2. Don't go out of your way to write something that actively contradicts established lore/materials.** If you want to write something that uses someone else's materials, I recommend reaching out to them for their thoughts. Ask questions if you're confused about something!\n\n**3. Get feedback before posting!** Reach out to me, [[*user oritiefling]], or another reviewer for crit! I personally am always willing to assist authors interested in writing for this canon with anything you might need!\n\nAbove all, have fun with it! This is an intentionally broad setting with a lot of room to tell whatever kind of story you want!\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=OriTiefling]]\n\n> **Filename:** dancingwiththestars.png, 6059olicus.png\n> **Author:** Olicus\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\n> **Note:** Artwork used on this page is fanart of SCP related works and by default released under the site's license.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
