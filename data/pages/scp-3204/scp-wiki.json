While putting a lot of effort into her duties, SCP-3204 still manages to make time for Amandine, caring for her and ensuring she is spoiled and loved at any given moment. She is the best partner anyone could ever ask for.\n\nDid I also mention how much of a stunning beauty she is? Well, she is.\n\nMs. Windward's other notable qualities include:\n\n* Her massive heart despite her cold demeanor;\n* Her hardworking attitude (even though she should rest more often);\n* Her acting like a teddy bear whenever we're together;\n* Her soft and fair skin, which feels nice to the touch;\n* Her ocean blue eyes I drown in every time we make eye contact;\n* Her blonde, majestic hair I want to entangle me;\n* Her lips;\n* How easily she gets embarrassed;\n* How much I like to embarrass her;\n* How much she cares about me;\n* How she notices the little things about me;\n* How warm she feels when she hugs me;\n* How gentle her voice is when she talks to me;\n* Her lipsâ€¦ again;\n \n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:dashed;border-color:rgb(168, 101, 181);background:rgb(206, 162, 253);padding: 0 10px 0;margin:0 10% 0\"]]\nOh my god.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:dashed;border-color:rgb(216, 191, 216);background:rgb(255, 240, 245);padding: 0 10px 0;margin:0 10% 0\"]]\nWhat's wrong?
