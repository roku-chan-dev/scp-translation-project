The body plan of the parathreat - with the exception of the head - was pentaradially symmetrical. The lower body of LTE-0851-Cetus terminated in five tentacles, radially arranged. The entity possessed five arms, each arranged along the same axis as the tentacles.\n\nWhile the head of the entity was outwardly similar to that of a baseline crocodile, the entity possessed five eyes, arranged in an arc along the head. LTE-0851-Cetus had significant paranormal regenerative capabilities, allowing it to survive most conventional weaponry.\n\nLTE-0851-Cetus possessed numerous unique thaumatological capabilities, including the emission of large amounts of [[[goc-supplemental-arad|Elan Vital Energy]]], the ability to detect EVE patterns, the ability to cross certain thaumatological boundaries, and Red-IV Regenerative properties. It apparently used the EVE detection abilities in order to hunt.\n\nShortly before its liquidation, LTE-0851-Cetus displayed the ability to release large quantities of thaumatologic fire from its mouth. This characteristic was not previously observed but has been conjectured to have been an ability LTE-0851-Cetus previously did not possess the required EVE to use, until the events surrounding its liquidation made this possible.\n\n[[size large]]**History and Liquidation:**[[/size]]\n\nLTE-0851-Cetus was discovered in the North Atlantic Ocean, following an attack on three commercial civilian vessels. An assessment team was deployed to investigate the matter and discovered the entity, as well as determining that the parathreat had previously been held by the Foundation.\n\nInitial liquidation efforts were unsuccessful, due to several factors. Following these, the decision was made to make an attempt in Greenland. However, the parathreat began to travel towards [[[Nx-03|Hy-Brasil]]], [[footnote]]A sovereign, independent, parapolitical port off the coast of Ireland, with diplomatic relations with the Coalition. Notably, Hy-Brasil could typically only be reached using thaumatological methods, with some paranormal organisms able to reach the island naturally.[[/footnote]] due to outside thaumatologic interference.\n\nLTE-0851-Cetus was successfully terminated on June 13, 1988, during the attack upon Hy-Brasil, at the cost of significant damage to the island. As a result of the arrangement made with the monarchy of Hy-Brasil, the Coalition was forced to immediately retreat and was not allowed to interact with the corpse of the entity.\n\nThe current location of the corpse of LTE-0851-Cetus is [[[kaiju-caviar-ocn39-t5fg6-7hjl2|unknown.]]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"woaf-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PSYCHE Records\n\n> ||~ Parathreat Investigation||\n>\n> __**Special Observer:**__ \n> \"Mangrove\" (73699274/6H3)\n> \n> __**Overview:**__ \n> A gigafauna of unknown origin has been spotted in the Northern Atlantic Ocean.\n> \n> __**Parathreat Evidence:**__ \n> Following the unexplained disappearance of three civilian commercial vessels, Parathreat Investigators were deployed to examine the planned routes of the vessels for any paranormal interference.\n> \n> Upon patrolling the route, a large entity came up on our sonar.

The government of Denmark was contacted, and an agreement was reached to liquidate the entity in the previously determined area.\n\nOperatives began to lure LTE-0851-Cetus north using EVE patterns, which LTE-0851-Cetus appeared to use to hunt prey. This strategy was successful, and the parathreat began to travel towards the planned liquidation location.\n\nHowever, operations did not go according to plan.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background: #FFFCF2; margin-left: 3px; margin-right: 3px; padding: 4px; margin-bottom: 25px; margin-top: 25px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]] **Analysis of Wards Surrounding Hy-Brasil** [[/size]]\n\n//Unified Thaumatology Quarterly// Vol. 75, No. 2, April 1988, pp. 53-68\n\nInternational Center for the Study of Unified Thaumatology\n//Hy-Brasil Campus//\n[[/=]]\n\nBy A.

LTE-0851-Cetus was close to Hy-Brasil as a result of the GOC's intentions to terminate it in Greenland, and immediately traveled towards Hy-Brasil instead.\n\nLTE-0851-Cetus happened to be one of the few paranormal organisms capable of reaching Hy-Brasil under its own ability, and it reached the island, having sensed the large EVE spike. The Coalition was unable to immediately prepare a method of reaching Hy-Brasil and was unable to reach the city immediately.\n\nBy the time the Global Occult Coalition was able to reach Hy-Brasil, LTE-0851-Cetus had already caused substantial damage to the infrastructure of the island, including the destruction of the palace. General Rockefeller immediately ordered heavy bombardment of the parathreat without regard for the existing infrastructure, the majority of which had already been destroyed.\n\nDuring the attack, LTE-0851-Cetus displayed the ability to breathe large amounts of thaumatological fire, which had not been previously observed. It has been theorized that LTE-0851-Cetus needed a requisite amount of EVE in order to release such an attack, which it did not possess until it absorbed a large amount of EVE released during the fall of Hy-Brasil's wards.\n\nThe initial assault upon LTE-0851-Cetus was unsuccessful, as a result of the entity's regenerative properties. Bombardment of the parathreat continued until General Rockefeller gave the order to deploy a Casaba-Howitzer Nuclear Directed Energy Weapon, which had been intended for use as a last resort.\n\nThe +2Gen-CHN was successful at liquidating the parathreat, but resulted in a significant amount of damage to the surrounding area of Hy-Brasil. During the resultant cleanup and aftermath of the event, the heir apparent to the throne of Hy-Brasil commanded the Coalition to immediately withdraw. As a result, the GOC was not able to conduct proper cleanup measures of LTE-0851-Cetus's remains.\n\n[[div_ class=\"woaf-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ PTOLEMY Records\n\n//AOD (Armaments Used in Destruction) report from the files of Marshall Prescott, Quartermaster Sergeant-Sector 06.

The storm was bad enough to cause panic, and then a fire-breathing squid monster crawled out of the ocean. It was a recipe for disaster, and that is what happened. _\n _\nWe bombarded that beast with everything we had, but it regenerated from just about everything we threw at it. I burned a hole in it straight down to the bone and minutes later you couldn't even tell I did anything. _\n _\nIt took hours of blasting it with our most advanced weaponry for it to begin to falter. We shot it with magic, with bullets, with fire, with plasma and they only slowed it down a little. _\n _\nAfter all of our weapons had done nothing to it, I decided I had enough. The only weapon that had done much of anything was the Plasma Tanks, and I came to the conclusion that an energy weapon was our best option. Given that, the usage of the Casaba-Howitzer became justified. _\n _\nSince that was the first field usage of the Casaba-Howitzer, I am expected to briefly address how it functioned: extremely well. It annihilated the parathreat. Left a hole right in its head that didn't grow back. _\n _\nBut that's my problem - the parathreat was not the only victim of the device. It destroyed far too much of the surrounding area of Hy-Brasil for my standards. Initial reports of the incident have indicated that there were several hundred civilian casualties as a result of the deployment of the device. The usage of the Casaba-Howitzer was not justified. _\n _\nThe decision to use the Casaba-Howitzer was entirely my own. None of my men were responsible, and those that activated it were only following orders. The deaths of those caused as a result of the weapon's deployment are my responsibility. _\n _\nMadam al Fine, I am filing a court-martial against myself for violations of Third Mission Concerns. Regardless of their findings, I will be retiring from service, as I can no longer view myself as equitably acting out the good of the world. _\n _\nI have failed the Coalition and, more importantly, humanity.||\n\nGeneral Rockefeller was tried by the Council of 108 for violations of Third Mission (Protection) Concerns and was found Not Guilty, by reason of the primacy of the First Mission (Survival) over the Third Mission. The liquidation of LTE-0851-Cetus was deemed to be a significant enough threat to First Mission concerns as to necessitate the complete abandoning of all other Missions. Thusly, the deployment of the Casaba-Howitzer Nuclear Directed Energy Weapon was excusable.\n\nBased upon the testimony and insistence of General Rockefeller, further usage of the +2Gen-CHN has been permanently suspended by the Global Occult Coalition for general usage. However, the Council of 108 has retained the right to deploy the +2Gen-CHN in high priority decisions, as decided by the Council of 108.\n\nFollowing his acquittal, General Rockefeller voluntarily retired from Global Occult Coalition service.\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
