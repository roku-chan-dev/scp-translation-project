Every month, SCP-6229 is to have a recorded therapy session by --Dr. Elijah Whitaker-- Angela Richards for a period of --one hour-- --three hours-- at minimum three hours, up to a maximum of forty-eight hours. \n\nA video feed of the unit is to be constantly monitored for any unauthorized departures. --One Scranton Reality Anchor is to be embedded into each wall, ceiling, and floor of the cell and activated in the event a demanifestation incident were to occur.--\n\nWeylin and Rebecca Agapov are to be monitored by three Foundation agents at all times. Should SCP-6229 attempt to breach containment, Weylin Agapov is to be detained for a period of thirty minutes and, should SCP-6229 not return to containment, terminated.\n\nResearcher Evelyn Agapov is not to be assigned to SCP objects above Danger Level: Caution. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6229 is an incorporeal 24-year-old male humanoid formerly known as Bennet Hao Zhu. SCP-6229 consistently repels reality away from itself, resulting in a negative reality space where it should physically exist.\n\nAs a result of this state of non-existence, SCP-6229 does not possess a need, or the capability, to engage in standard bodily functions such as eating or sleeping, nor does it appear to age. It also appears to lack mundane senses including hearing and sight, instead relying on observing and measuring Humetic signatures[[footnote]]Described by SCP-6229 as minute differences in Hume levels for objects and energies[[/footnote]] with assistance from SCP-6229-1.\n\nSCP-6229-1 is a full-body Andetheus-alloy[[footnote]] A proprietary alloy designed by Anderson Robotics and Prometheus Labs[[/footnote]] suit with adaptive Humetic properties, allowing SCP-6229 limited physicality. It is equipped with a camera and voice synthesizer, the former being a detachable component connected to the chestplate while the latter appears to be directly connected with the neck. SCP-6229-1 possesses an external hume concentration of 99.9, theoretically rendering it immune to reality-based alterations.\n\nPhysically, SCP-6229-1 is capable of exerting forces up to 2 kN with its arms and 8 kN with its legs and shows a high tolerance against damage, able to withstand temperatures up to 5000°C and impact forces from bullets smaller than .50 caliber. SCP-6229-1 is capable of becoming incorporeal, allowing both it and SCP-6229 to phase through physical objects at will.\n\nAs of cross-testing conducted on May 19th, 2018, SCP-6229 is confirmed able to ignore external anomalous behaviors and triggers. Cross-testing revealed that anomalous objects and concepts, such as antimemes, infohazards, thaumaturgy, etc.[[footnote]]Full list available upon request from Angela Richards[[/footnote]] had no effect on SCP-6229.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\nFiles regarding SCP-6229 were seized by Foundation Agents from Prometheus Labs on August 26, 2008 following containment of SCP-6229. Those too damaged to read were sent to the Restoration Department.\n\nAudio transcribed by Foundation AICs. Given the volume of files, they have been ordered chronologically. \n\n------\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible hide=\"Prometheus Labs: Bennet Hao Zhu Interview: Access Granted\" show=\"Prometheus Labs: Bennet Hao Zhu Interview: Access Restricted\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[<]]\n//Transcript of an audio recording regarding SCP-6229's recruitment by Prometheus Labs.//\n//Date: 8/18/1995//\n\nIndividuals: Agent Francis Morrison, Junior Researcher Bennet Hao Zhu (SCP-6229)\n------\n**Morrison:** So, Mr. Hao, you're currently working under Dr. Goldstein, correct?\n\n**SCP-6229:** That's right.

Are you trying to say that you're not going to pay this off?\n\n**SCP-6229:** I- I'm not going to pay off the entire cost of researching this thing. And didn't Prometheus develop some kind of reality stabilizer based off that research anyways?\n\n**Morrison:** Yes, and that's exactly why we're giving you an opportunity.\n\n**SCP-6229:** ...what?\n\n**Morrison:** Prometheus Labs is giving you a chance to pay off this debt at a relatively low cost to you. I can't exactly tell you the details before you accept, but just between you and me, if you accept, Prometheus will waive the entire cost of your treatment... and your father's.\n\n**SCP-6229:** I'm supposed to agree to something without even knowing what it is?
