This is a picture of my cute little desk! Oh yeah! There I‚Äôve got my journal, then some cute decorations and some nice jewels laid out! ! I just wanted to show this to you. Why is it relevant? Because we're going to be talking about planners! \n\nNow setting up planners is serious business. Because as a girl, we have a lot of plans! :P We have to get ready with our clothes and hair and make-up in the morning, we have to be absolutely perfect for our boyfriends and husbands- don't want to disappoint our man! We have long days with the girlfriends, going on shopping days, etc. So much to do!\n\nNow there‚Äôs a lot of things that you can put in planners, like daily task lists, bullet journaling, goals, notes, etc! What we‚Äôre focusing on today is a daily task list! What is that? A planner task list is where you plan out your day, of course! You can plan out more than one at a time, or do it at the start of each day! I prefer to do one at the start of each day! Now once you make this, make sure to follow it PERFECTLY. Gotta be perfect, ya know! ;3 \n\nI‚Äôve always loved to journal and plan, I did even before I got into JGT but of course those are WAY more boring LOL. But I figured I‚Äôd help you all do it in style!\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ Make it aesthetically pleasing!\n\n[[/=]]\n\nTo start out, you‚Äôll need some GLITTER PENS!!! No planner is complete without being written in beautiful colors! Here‚Äôs a picture of mine!\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/we-can-t-plan-out-our-lives-or-can-we/pen%20jgt width=\"500px\"]]\n\n\nMy favorite color is pink OF COURSE but I have purple here too! But you can use any color that suits you as long as it's girly! You NEED something cute to write in‚Äîdon‚Äôt want to be boring! \n\nThen you need a cute notebook! Mine is pink on the outside with this cute rainbow print and a nice message, but you can use stickers, decorative tape, ANYTHING! Just make sure it's cute!\n------\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ What should you put in a planner?\n\n[[/=]]\n\nSecond, we need to go over what to put in a planner! Here are some good examples!\n\n* A to do list \n* Goals for the day\n* Plan what your perfect day looks like \n* Daily affirmations\n* Daily health goals (I always make sure to take my diet pills!)\n\n[[=]]\n\n------\n\n+ Perfect Planner Example\n\n[[/=]]\n\nSo to give you an example of a planner, I‚Äôm going to show the planner that I used to start on my journey of girlhood! I used this every day, and now I‚Äôm the lovely girl you see before you today! I decided to put notes in case I ever planned on sharing it (which I did!) When I was making this, the idea came to me to make a tutorial, so I thought I‚Äôd make it accessible! If it seems like I‚Äôm talking to you, I am! I wrote this in a physical journal, but I wrote it out in text so you could read it better!\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n+ Dolly‚Äôs Daily Planner (tutorial version)\n[[/=]]\n\n* Wake up in bed! I have it all decorated in cute pink pillows and bedding! \n* Shower! Gotta be nice and clean! If you don‚Äôt shower every day, that‚Äôs totally gross.\n* Get all dolled up in nice make up and cute clothes! Maybe I should get new ones though? My husband says he doesn‚Äôt like them and that it‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo much pink and frills‚Äô. He says whatever makes me happy, but wishes I wouldn‚Äôt have gotten rid of my old clothes. Maybe I should try more white?\n* Don‚Äôt eat breakfast if you plan on eating lunch and dinner! That‚Äôs way too much food! \n* I would put take diet pills here, but mine went missing, so putting buying new ones from Ella on the to do list. I asked my husband if he‚Äôs seen them, but he said no. \n* Go to Ella‚Äôs to get diet pills + her bakery to get some sweets! Really need more of those mite mice, I was running low.\n* Make lunch for Robbin. My husband was home from work today, so I was able to make a nice meal today! He insisted on doing it together like we used to, but I told him that only women belong in the kitchen and that I should serve him as his wife. (Make sure to make yourself a smaller portion!)\n* Eat lunch! \n* Do dishes after lunch! Clean husband's food off both plates.\n* Do chores around the house. Don‚Äôt leave that to your man! Except for the boyish ones like yard work. Clean and do laundry, make sure the house is perfect for him!\n* Okay so he did the laundry already? I told him I would do it. \n* Spend time blogging on JGT! Make sure to share your experience with other girls!\n* Make dinner! (Again, make sure to make small portions)\n* He tried to share again! I told him I DON‚ÄôT need more food.\n* Get ready for bed!\n* Prepare the couch's bedding!\n* Go to bed! \n\n------\n\nI hope that helped you make a PERFECT daily planner for your day! Make sure to leave a comment with your opinions. Thanks for reading! -Dolly\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[html]]\n<h1 style=\"border:2px solid Violet;\">    </h1>\n[[/html]]\n[[=]]\n+ Comments\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n[[size 125%]]###EF63FF|__MelanieChuterxo__##[[/size]] [[size small]]###E88EE2|March 20th, 2018##[[/size]] \n\nAre you okay?

No it's not! What you're describing here is classic indoctrination from society making your husband into some woke liberal man who doesn't understand the true beauty of a woman. He doesn't like you for how you are? That's totally messed up. If everything is fine, why are you making the couch as a bed? I thought it was just you two. Cleaning food off two plates? You should have none left over.\n\n------\n\n[[size 125%]]###f54272|__SweetGenevieve‚úø__##[[/size]] [[size small]]###f54272|March 20th, 2018##[[/size]]\n\n##hotpink|In response to:## ##FF4599|__MissDolly__##\n\nI don't understand. Everything is perfect with my boyfriend. He loves JGT. Well, from what he's allowed to know about it. He just likes that I'm his perfect girl :) I can't believe you have to withstand this abuse of him trying to force you to be some lame person. You need to be a perfect girl.

When I brought cake from Ella's, he wouldn't even try it! It's like he stopped trying to connect with me. He says 'you're not the person I married'. And he's right. I'm better! And yeah he... he doesn't sleep in the bed with me anymore. He says he isn't interested. The food is both his. He tries to share his food with me. Which I don't accept, of course!\n\nI've never talked to KeeLee personally, do you really think she could help? The reason I wanted to do a planner was because I actually wanted practice for our anniversary that's coming up soon. It's our four-year anniversary and I really want it to be special. But at this point... I feel like he doesn't love me anymore.\n\n------\n\n[[size 125%]]##hotpink|__KeeLee__##[[/size]] [[size small]]##hotpink|March 20th, 2018##[[/size]]\n\n##hotpink|In response to:## ##FF4599|__MissDolly__##\n\nOh dear, never say that.

This is a bit cheesy, but I actually have something I could give you as an anniversary present. I wanted to give you a gift to show my support for you‚Äî girl to girl.

So this post was specifically requested by the queen KeeLee herself! I figured I'd so you what my anniversary plans for my husband are! But first, I want to show an old daily planner, which was also requested. Now warning, this was from before I was into JGT, so it‚Äôs kinda gross ü§¢ also I went by a different name before I found my true nature so haha\n\n------\n\n+ Bailey‚Äôs Plans February 2nd, 2014\n\n* get up, shower\n* Get ready for work\n* Go to work\n* Pick up new PlayStation controller from GameStop cause Robbin got gamer's rage (haha)\n* Wash my favorite Pokemon dress because I got barbecue sauce on it at lunch yesterday\n* talk to Robbin about getting nasal strips (he snores too loudly)\n* Help Robbin make dinner \n* play game with Robbin\n* remember for tomorrow, go to Molly‚Äôs house, she says she has something to show me \n\n------\n\nIsn‚Äôt that gross?? I‚Äôm not sure why anyone would want to see this but here it is. I‚Äôm much better now as you can tell :) \n\nNow onto the fun part! Anniversary plans!\n\nI wasn‚Äôt really sure what to do to be completely honest with you girlies. But then I thought about it, and I realized that maybe I just haven‚Äôt shown myself to him enough. That I wasn't trying hard enough, and that's why he doesn't like me! What would be a better anniversary gift than fully showing myself to him? So here‚Äôs a planner I made showing what I plan to do!\n\n+ Anniversary plans\n\n* Wake up and get all dolled up! I will try white this time, that‚Äôs always been a pretty color to me. Use lots of makeup!\n* Make a nice breakfast, but only for him! This is his day after all!\n* Plan activities that are fun for him and do things he likes! \n* Watch him to his activities and stay to the side like the perfect housewife I am incase he needs anything.\n* Give cake I will get from Ella's the day before.\n* Offer to myself to him if he desires it.\n* Make lunch! Again, only for him.\n* Then dinner, only for him.\n* Go to bed with him! We will surely go to bed together this time.\n\nThose are my plans!

He tells me he wants me to be the perfect woman, and we finally sleep in bed together again! He's completely stopped hating my girly dresses, and even started buying me new clothes! He's even been telling me to put on more makeup and style my hair cuter! But he always has a weird look on his face when it happens.
