Some of the people who took a look at this in its early stages apparently reminded them of a typical Black Friday fiasco, which was a pleasant surprise. For this particular one, I wanted to emulate a little bit of [[*user Weryllium]]'s style as part of the Imposter syndrome challenge: short, yet punchy on its own, be it explicitly shown or through implication.\"//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]seoulmate.docx[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"oheader red\"]]\n[[=]]\n//\"One of my first works on the wiki, as part of an entry for Cupid con.

I do admit I may have cringed a little when I was trying to write *ROMANCE* because I had zero experience in relationships...\"//\n\n//\"... I also had no experience working, so I wouldn't have completely known the daily struggles of an office worker in *hard* oligarchic capitalist society. This would've been a literal slice-of-life romcom if not for the ending, yeah. It's admittedly a little out of place, but I think I'm satisfied, generally. It's also my first piece to be translated to Vietnamese!\"//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]Project Ibarahime, 1945[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"oheader red\"]]\n[[=]]\n//\"First entry for the IJAMEA GoI format. I was real excited when I first saw this on the wiki, since I tend to like alternate history and the like. I did struggle with the tone on how the IJAMEA would document anomalies, but I think I managed to get by okay. The core concept was once made into an SCP, but I scrapped it and went full on with IJAMEA instead, because why not? This was actually quite enjoyable to write, since I wouldn't be so locked in by the clinical tone of SCP articles but simultaneously maintaining that cold, harsh underlying motives behind every instruction.\"//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]Kmean Phnek[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"oheader red\"]]\n[[=]]\n//\"Parawatch.
