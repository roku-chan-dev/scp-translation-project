An MRI magnet is about 4.25T. [[/footnote]] magnetic field at least --1-- 2 meters above ground at all times. Under no circumstances is SCP-7486 to make physical contact with any surface. \n\n**Testing Protocols:** Personnel are prohibited from bringing more than one item into SCP-7486's containment chamber at any time. All tests involving SCP-7486 require written approval from at least two level 3 personnel, and monitored via closed-circuit cameras to record the merging process. All personnel leaving the containment chamber must undergo a decontamination followed by a mandatory Psychiatric Evaluation if deemed necessary. \n\n**Description:** SCP-7486 is a 50cm x 50cm x 50cm cube made of an as yet unconfirmed black metal. SCP-7486 weighs approximately 3487.29kg. Its surface is marked by engravings that faintly glow when active. When SCP-7486 is moved across large distances, it randomly allocates an \"owner\", where anomalous functions cease to function without that person in the room. \n\nWhen two distinct objects make simultaneous contact with SCP-7486, a merging event occurs. The objects are physically, chemically and conceptually fused into a temporary, unstable \"Merged Entity\" (designated SCP-7486-A). Merged entities vary in complexity and behaviour but consistently disintegrate within 24 hours. \n\nEach merging event causes SCP-7486 to temporarily lose all engravings and release a non-thermal grey pulse. Exposure to this pulse triggers an acute increase in 3,4-dihydroxyphenethylamine[[footnote]] Otherwise known as Dopamine [[/footnote]] (ranging from 3.5–30.2 nmol/L in affected subjects), resulting in heightened pleasure and a compulsion to repeat the merging process. This effect intensifies with each exposure and will reach all individuals within the chamber regardless of distance or line of sight. SCP-7486 will then enter a cooldown period during which SCP-7486 can be interacted with without any anomalous effect.\n\nThe interval between functional merges increases as the number of merges accumulates, ranging from seconds to multiple hours. If SCP-7486 is left unused for more than ten consecutive days, a hostile reaction is triggered, scaling upwards as SCP-7486 remains unused. This response has resulted in multiple injuries and one facility-wide lockdown (see Incident 7486-56).\n\nPossible connections with ████████ have been noted, although gaps in understanding of the merging process prevent a conclusive answer.\n\n**Recovery Information:** SCP-7486 was discovered on ██/██/20██ at ██████ Army Reserves in Ontario, Canada during an inventory check, attracting attention due to its weight and anomalous appearance. Merges between weapons and storage equipment, as well as multiple pairs of personnel who attempted to pick up SCP-7486 or to make a merge, led staff to contact local authorities, leading to a Foundation alert.\n\nCorporal ███████ █████ reported \"a glowing blue pattern\" across SCP-7486’s surface and claimed the object had been \"responding to me.\" No corroborations were recorded, and the Lieutenant later retracted his statement under questioning. Shortly afterward, the object ceased exhibiting anomalous effects entirely.\n\nFoundation agents arrived under the guise of Federal Inspectors and secured SCP-7486 after ██ accidental merges. Witnesses were amnesticised and the object was relocated to Site-76 for containment. SCP-7486 was fully inert during Foundation transport and containment setup, and only regained anomalous effects when Dr. Emily Zhang entered the chamber for standard material testing.\n\nAt this stage, Foundation researchers noted a potential link between the object and a specific individual, though the mechanism through which this could happen remains unidentified. \n\n------\n\n++ **Addendum**\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-01: Experiment Log**\n[[div class=\"testseries noword\"]]\n**SCP-7486 Experiment Log**  \n**Aim:** Document merges between various items using SCP-7486.  \n\n[[table class=\"testlogs\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nPROTOCOL\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nRESULT\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 11/2  \n**Attempt:** **001**  \nItem 1: Standard metal stapler  \nItem 2: Foundation-issue paperweight  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nSCP-7486-01 was a weighted stapler, approximately 1.5x heavier than average, with an internal mechanism altered to activate when the object was tilted at varying angles. When tilted past a 37 degree angle, staples discharged without manual input and with inconsistent force, up to 20N.  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nObject was disassembled after 2 hours of activity and disintegrated 15 minutes later. Dr. Zhang described the result as \"the kind of thing you’d see in an art student’s dream\". Dr. Zhang requested to note that the cube’s glow \"is getting really bright\", something she says \"still pisses her off\". Reviewing the closed-circuit cameras revealed no such glow. She expressed curiosity regarding the speed and lack of a visible merge process. Zhang requested additional office equipment for future merges.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 11/2  \n**Attempt:** **002**  \nItem 1: Foundation-issued toothbrush  \nItem 2: Standard bar of soap  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nSCP-7486-02 resembled a toothbrush with a series of foam-based bristles that dissolved slightly each use, emitting bubbles while in use.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nObject disintegrated after 19 hours and 38 minutes. Slight skin irritation was reported when used on the wrist. Zhang described it as \"efficient design style,\" and requested a glass of water and a watch be added to the experiment schedule.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 13/2  \n**Attempt:** **003**  \n\nItem 1: A glass of water  \nItem 2: A wristwatch\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-03 was a translucent watch filled with water. Time was displayed by air bubbles forming Roman numerals.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nCondensation formed on the wearer’s skin when worn, and the object ceased functioning if subjected to temperatures below 0°C. Object disintegrated immediately after being taken out of the room after 25 minutes by Dr. Kavinsky in an attempt to ██████ without authorisation. Dr. Kavinsky was put on leave by Dr. Zhang for this. Dr. Zhang retried this merge under controlled circumstances, with identical results, making notes in her notebook detailing the complexity of the internal design of the watch.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 14/2  \n**Attempt:** **07**  \n\nItem 1: A piece of white chalk  \nItem 2: A dried //Tulipa//\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-07 was a piece of white chalk infused with the colour and texture of the flower petals. It produced ephemeral floral illustrations when used on chalkboards, lasting up to 10 minutes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-07 disintegrated completely after 11 hours, leaving no trace behind. Zhang remained inside the containment chamber for over 20 minutes post-disintegration, saying nothing. Surveillance showed her re-tracing one of the chalk drawings with her hand after it faded. Dr. Patel noted this behaviour but chose not to intervene.[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 13/2  \n**Attempt:** **011**  \n\nItem 1: Mouse skull fragment  \nItem 2: Foundation-issued cotton cloth  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nSCP-7486-11 was a thin, translucent veil measuring approximately 40cm x 70cm. When disturbed, the object gave out faint whispering sounds of unknown origin. Audio was later determined to be Archi. The amplitude of the voice was measured around 14–19 dB.  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nZhang requested and personally selected the mouse skull used for the merge. The Merged Entity was removed from the chamber after 12 hours and disintegrated immediately. Dr. Patel questioned whether Zhang’s item selections were becoming too personal. Zhang dismissed the concern.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 13/2  \n**Attempt:** **015**  \n\nItem 1: 8cm strand of hair (from D-118)  \nItem 2: Porcelain figurine of a child  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-15 was a ceramic humanoid figurine 24cm in height. The object emitted D-118’s name as low vocalisations every three to five minutes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nThe object was not animated but would change between emotions that we later show to be consistent with D-118's emotions at the time every 45 seconds. These changes were instant. Zhang remained seated within the chamber throughout its 19-minute lifespan, watching it in silence. She declined to speak during debrief and did not submit her own notes.[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n**Date:** 14/2  \n**Attempt:** **017**  \n\nItem 1: D-165  \nItem 2: One ripe lemon  \n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nThe lemon was moved 30 km away after interacting with SCP-7486. Subject became lemon shaped, retaining human cognitive levels, both arms, the mouth and both eyes. SCP-7486-17's skin developed a rough yellow texture.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell]]\nMerge occurred while approval was still under Ethics review. SCP-7486-17 was in severe pain and was terminated at his own request. SCP-7486-17 disintegrated upon termination. When questioned about the urgency of the test by Dr. Patel, Dr. Zhang responded that \"delay would compromise the results.\"\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 15/2  \n**Attempt:** **020**  \n\nItem 1: A bucket containing 500ml of Dr. Zhang's blood  \nItem 2: Porcelain Doll\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-20 was an animated, life-sized porcelain doll resembling Dr. Zhang's deceased spouse, switching expressions between joy and sadness. The doll emitted vocalisations calling for Dr. Zhang and whispering phrases described as 'disturbing' and 'personal' when in her near vicinity. Dr. Zhang also reported feelings of dread as the doll’s voice grew louder, culminating in a scream before disintegrating into a pile of ash after 23 minutes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nDr. Zhang did not submit a report. Surveillance footage shows her making repeated contact with SCP-7486-20 over a 22-minute span before SCP-7486-94 curled into a ball and began disintegration. A psychological evaluation was ordered the same day. No personnel were permitted in the chamber during the test.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n//Remaining tests redacted for brevity. Contact Dr. Blaine for any questions regarding these tests.//\n\nAs a result of Attempt 020, no further merges were permitted for a period of 36 hours. During this time, Dr. Zhang submitted additional item pairings to the testing schedule, including biological samples and personal memorabilia. Several of these requests were flagged for review.\n\nOn 17/2, in the absence of Dr. Zhang, Dr. Patel resumed testing, the results of which are documented in Addendum 7486-03.\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-02: Psychiatric Evaluation 1**\n> **Conducted by:** Dr. Nhung Thanh Ngo - Chair, Psychology and Parapsychology Section \n> **Subject:** Dr. Emily Zhang  \n> **Date:** 16/2/20██  \n> \n> Dr. Ngo is performing a routine psychiatric review with Dr. Zhang following multiple merges involving personal effects.\n> \n> [BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Good afternoon, Dr. Zhang, I hope you're doing well. I want to begin by clarifying this is not disciplinary-focused, it’s just a standard checkin to make sure you're well. My main concern is that you’ve been involved in 22 merges since SCP-7486 was secured at the Foundation which puts you significantly above baseline testing hours. \n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Mm. I’d imagine so. It’s been very productive however, all these tests. I’d be concerned if they weren’t.  \n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** I don’t disagree. Your logs are for the most part on par with expectations. That said, some of your recent merges involve items with less.. clear value towards research and more towards you as a person.  \n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Are you referring to Attempt 020?  \n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Among others, yes. That test in particular involved a personal item and a biological sample, I believe your own blood and a doll retrieved from your quarters. Do you feel you maintained full clinical detachment whilst selecting those items and performing the merging process?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang leans back slightly in her chair.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I chose those items to test material familiarity and any emotional effects it would have on me. Nothing else. You’ve seen the results Ngo, the cube responds better when the input has an emotional meaning to it. I’ve noticed the glow’s stronger afterwards too, sometimes it doesn’t even stop.\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo pauses, adjusts her glasses, and looks at Zhang with curiosity.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** We didn't see anything on the recordings. What exactly are you seeing?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang pauses for several seconds before answering.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Maybe just a presence, I suppose. Hard to describe.\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo nods slowly and shifts in her seat.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Hm. I’ll ask the tech team to review the recordings again, just in case. \n> \n> //She pauses briefly before continuing.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** I’ve also seen you spend almost four hours inside the containment chamber over the past two days, with only two merges completed in that time. What's going on?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** You think I’m lingering, just doing fuckall?\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo offers a faint smile, hands folded in front of her.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** I think it’s at least worth asking why, don't you Emily?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang exhales sharply and looks away briefly. She lets out a long sigh, appearing reluctant.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I'll admit I’m fascinated. I’ve worked on a dozen anomalies, and none respond like this cube. There’s something intentional about it, I almost feel drawn to experiment on it. It's hard to explain\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** That’s reasonable. Fascination is part of the job, but being compelled by it is interesting.\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo is silent for a moment before speaking again.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** I’d like you to consider stepping away from the cube for, call it four days. It's not a punishment, I just want to make sure you're at full mental strength before you continue.  \n> \n> //Dr. Zhang lowers her gaze, speaking more softly.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Four days?  \n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** You can assign the team something simple in the meantime. Patel’s capable. Just try out a couple of simple merges.  \n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I’d prefer to finish a few more trials before I take leave. I have something more adaptable in mind next.  \n> \n> //She pauses, then continues, appearing to be in focus.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Something a little more... deliberate. I’m wondering if there might be a threshold we haven’t crossed yet because of what we're testing. Not just in terms of materials, but in terms of meaning as well.\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Meaning?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang shrugs.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Intent. Expectations. Maybe even how your brainwaves flicker. I just think the cube reacts differently when the merge is... aimed. Like it knows it's being watched - like there’s a trigger, and we just haven’t been standing in the right place to use it.\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo’s pen stops mid-sentence. He leans forward slightly and looks up without speaking, expression unreadable. He pauses shortly before replying.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Aimed?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I don't mean literally. I mean as in, if intention changes the outcome, then maybe the cube needs to have some kind of context inputted into it, like an AI. Or attention. Focused attention on one specific thing as you merge two items together. I just don't know how yet\n> \n> //Dr. Ngo smiles slightly.//\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** One more session, then two days off. Just as a precaution. Agreed?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang nods.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Fine. Just keep the item queue stable while I’m out. I want plenty of items to test when I get back.\n> \n> **Dr. Ngo:** Deal.\n> \n> [END TRANSCRIPT]\n\n**Note from Dr. Ngo:** No signs of cognitive distress were observed, but subject showed a low baseline level of emotional reaction during the session and displayed an elevated need to defend against consistent attempts to talk. Recommended a temporary removal from active testing duties for four days, effective until 20/2.\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-03: Failed Merge Log**\n[[div class=\"testseries noword\"]]\n**SCP-7486 Experiment Log**  \n**Aim:** Test if merging behaviour is consistent when performed in the absence of Dr. Zhang.  \n\n[[table class=\"testlogs\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nPROTOCOL\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nRESULT\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding:.3em .7em;text-align:center;border:1px solid black;background-color:silver;\"]]\nADDITIONAL NOTES\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 17/2  \n**Attempt:** **022**  \n\nItem 1: A plastic Spoon  \nItem 2: A ball of Yarn\n\nMerge conducted by Dr. Patel while Dr. Zhang was off-site.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nNo anomalous behaviour observed. SCP-7486 remained inert for the duration of the test, without any glow or pulse.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nTest repeated three times under identical conditions using different object pairings each time. All attempts failed.\n\nDr. Zhang returned to Site-76 later that day and the original merge combination was repeated under her supervision under standard procedure (see Attempt 023).\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\n**Date:** 17/2  \n**Attempt:** **023**  \n\nItem 1: A ballpoint pen  \nItem 2: A brass compass  \n\nMerge initiated by Dr. Zhang.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nSCP-7486-23 was a brass writing implement with a floating ink reservoir across both points of the compass, moving in tandem with the compass. Merged Entity produced irregular radio signals when writing.\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:1px solid black;padding:.3em .7em;\"]]\nDr. Zhang appeared unsurprised by the successful merge. No comment was offered. A request for additional metals and geometric tools was submitted following the test.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-04: Incident Report 7486-24**\n\nOn 18/2, in the absence of Dr. Zhang, during a scheduled test involving SCP-7486, a mechanical fault in the object’s levitation mechanism led to surface contact with the chamber floor. Despite previous failed merges without Dr. Zhang present (see Addendum 7486-02), SCP-7486 underwent a merging event anyway, leading to anomalous effects on nearby staff. Below is an Incident Report detailing the events of said merging event.\n\n> **Date:** 18/2/20██  \n> **Time:** 12:17 \n> **Location:** SCP-7486 Containment Chamber, Site-76  \n> **Reporting Staff:** Dr. Patel  \n> \n> **Timeline of Events:**\n> \n> **12:17:22** Standard chamber preparations initiated by Dr. Patel. Dr. Zhang remains off-site due to temporary leave.\n> **12:17:24** SCP-7486 slips from its magnetic hold due to misalignment in Magnet B in the levitation device. Object makes brief contact with the chamber floor on its corner before tilting onto an unattended clipboard.\n> **12:17:25** A merging event occurs. SCP-7486 emits a standard grey pulse. The resulting entity (hereby SCP-7486-24) is a malleable Steel sheet with cursive handwritten text across its upper surface. A clip is present and is attached to SCP-7486-24. Text written on SCP-7486-24 is meaningless.\n> **12:17:27** Three nearby staff members (Research Assistant R. Benitez, Junior Technician A. Rana, and D-4223) begin suggesting object pairings for future merges out of the blue. Two exit the containment chamber and attempt to re-enter with personal belongings, but are denied entry by Dr. Patel.\n> **12:17:46** Dr. Patel initiates a low-level lockdown. Magnetic levitation was re-established using the secondary suspension system. SCP-7486-24 disintegrates after 349 seconds.\n> \n> **Note from Dr. Patel:**  \n> \"It worked without her. I could have sworn it didn't last time, I don’t know why it works now. Maybe something carried over. But what’s more concerning is how quickly Benitez and Rana changed. They weren’t just curious. They were *energetic*, like they just throw caution to the wind and decided to do whatever.  \n>  \n> I’ve been doing this shit long enough to know when a room, especially one like this, is not safe. And I don’t think it’s the cube anymore. I think it could be the idea of it, just thinking of it could trigger the effects perhaps?\"\n\n**Post-Incident Observations:**\n\n- All three affected personnel displayed elevated heart rate, increased extraversion, and reported either excitement or a desire to \"see more\" for up to six hours post-exposure.\n- No member of staff was able to recall what the merged entity looked like in detail, despite direct observation.\n- Interviews conducted on 18/2 and 19/2 suggest a mild compulsive behaviour linked to SCP-7486’s \"potential.\" Symptoms resolved without Foundation input within 72 hours.\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-05: Ethics Committee Directive**\n\n48 hours after the events of Addendum 7486-02, the Ethics Committee was notified and distributed an email to all members of staff designated to SCP-7486, including Dr. Zhang. The following Notice is directly from a portion of this email.  \n\n> **To:** Site-76 Research Division, SCP-7486 team (Staff Level: 2+/7486)\n> **From:** Ethics Committee\n> **Subject:** Provisional containment changes for SCP-7486  \n> **Date:** 19/2/20██  \n> \n> Following Incident Report 7486-24 and subsequent behavioural irregularities in affected personnel, the Ethics Committee has approved the following provisional containment modifications, effective immediately:\n>  \n> - Merge frequency is restricted to one (1) event per day, unless written authorisation is provided by Site Director James.\n> - Dr. Zhang's temporary removal being extended is under review.  \n> - All chamber operations now require confirmation from two (2) level 3 non-research personnel. These personnel are to be in charge of continuous visual monitoring of the Chamber at all times whilst a merging event is taking place, until five (5) minutes post-disintegration of the resulting merged entity.  \n> - Respective staff have been assigned to monitor the Item documentation queues for anomalous behaviour-focused patterns, repeated object pairings, and any other indicators of compulsive testing.\n> \n> These protocols are to remain in effect until further psychiatric evaluation data can be reviewed and a new long-term policy is introduced.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; border-color: white; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING: THE REMAINDER OF THIS FILE IS LEVEL 3 CLASSIFIED\n----\n+++ ANY ATTEMPT TO ACCESS FURTHER WITHOUT LEVEL 3 AUTHORISATION WILL LEAD TO IMMEDIATE DISCIPLINARY ACTION, UP TO AND INCLUDING REASSIGNMENT AND AMNESTICISATION.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n‎ \n[[collapsible show=\"+ LEVEL 7486/3 CLEARANCE REQUIRED\" hide=\"- THIS ADDICTION IS KILLING ME!!!\"]] \n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-06: Private Log – Dr. E. Zhang**\n\nThe following is the contents of a log recorded on Dr. Zhang’s on-site workstation. File was deleted but recovered from local storage. The file was not submitted to Research Archives. The log was recorded approximately 13 hours after the message distributed to all SCP-7486 staff, located in Addendum 7486-05\n\n> **Date:** 20/2/20██  \n> \n> [BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:**  The team has adjusted the procedure. The merge limit, dual authorisation, all the expected extras. I'm not surprised, I would’ve probably suggested something similar. From the outside, I assume it looks like I'm being hysterical. Like a researcher in over her head. They’ve read my logs, probably have watched the tape by now. They think they’ve seen everything.\n> \n> But they haven’t been in the room. Not really, not like I have.\n> \n> This cube doesn’t just respond to contact with a couple of basic items. It responds to ideas. To intention. Almost like it *watches*, but not like we do. Not visually. It's almost as if it's getting.. slower over time. Like it's waiting for the right merge. The right idea, the right something.\n> \n> There’s a reason these simpler merges with chalk and lemons and whatever disintegrate after not even a day. There’s no structure or true thought give to them. No questioning why these items. It's just noise I feel. But if this cube finds something that carries weight, memory, meaning, belief - it might just resist. It lasts even a little longer. It's almost giving some form of approval by how long the object lasts. With shape. With silence. With time.\n> \n> I've asked it many questions but it's given not one sufficient answer. But I think it’s trying to.\n> \n> I’ve cut out most of the shit from the queue. Only five items left now. Just five. If I’m asking the right question now, if I’m showing it the right way, it’ll show something. And if not... then maybe I misunderstood the question more then I thought.\n> \n> There is no doubt in my mind though. I am certain.\n> \n> [END TRANSCRIPT]\n\nShortly after the log recorded in Addendum 7486-06 was recovered, surveillance monitors flagged Dr. Zhang accessing prohibited floors outside of her assigned hours. While no containment breach was recorded, the following exchange was recovered from hallway surveillance and added to the official file during review.\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-07: Informal Interview Transcript – Dr. Patel**\n\n> **Date:** 20/2/20██  \n> \n> [BEGIN TRANSCRIPT]\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** You know you're not meant to be on this floor Zhang.\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I’m just reviewing documentation. I’m not touching a thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** You literally deleted a log entry. You think no one’s watching you anymore? You think you're anonymous?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** No. I think the Foundation's watching the wrong thing.\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** What the hell does that mean?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** This cube, it doesn’t care about things like gloves and distance and dual authentication. It never did. The only thing it cares about structure. About what's //aimed// at it in particular\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** Glass said you mentioned a question it might answer. What question?\n> \n> //Dr. Zhang pauses for a moment before replying.//\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** Five, actually. Five questions answered by five objects. That’s all I need.\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** What’s the fifth one?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** It’ll come to me eventually, for now I don't know.\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** Emily, you need to be careful. This isn’t just a theory you've had in mind anymore. You sound like you're planning a ritual for the cube.\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** I’m planning a conclusion.\n> \n> //Dr. Patel sighs.//\n> \n> **Dr. Patel:** You know you're not the first person to think a thing is talking back right?\n> \n> **Dr. Zhang:** No. But I might just be the first one it’s bothering to listen to. At least that's what I'm betting on.\n> \n> [END TRANSCRIPT]\n\n+++ **Addendum 7486-08: Final Merge Log – Event 7486-FINAL**\n\n> **Date:** 23/2/20██  \n> **Time of Entry:** 04:41  \n> \n> **Summary:** Unscheduled merging event carried out by Dr. Emily Zhang in direct violation of Addendum 7486-05 restrictions. Recorded during low-security rotation window. No authorisation was issued.\n> \n> **Item 1:** Unlabelled personal sculpture, ceramic. Recovered later from Zhang’s quarters. A partial resemblance to Dr. Zhang was noted.  \n> **Item 2:** Unmarked envelope. Contents unknown. Envelope disintegrated during merge. No physical remains recovered.  \n> \n> **Timeline of Event:**\n> \n> - **00:00:00** – Zhang enters SCP-7486 containment using an unauthorised Level 3 keycard. Further investigation revealed that the keycard status was not updated in the on-site credential system.\n> \n> - **00:00:14** – Both objects are placed simultaneously on SCP-7486. No usual pulse or glow resulting from a merging event was detected.\n> \n> - **00:00:15** – A merge occurs. The resulting entity (SCP-7486-A) is a grey sphere, approximately 22cm in diameter. Surface is smooth. It rotates slowly, counter-clockwise. Dr. Zhang noted a warmth to SCP-7486-A. \n> \n> - **00:00:32** – Dr. Zhang exhales. No change to SCP-7486-A observed.\n> \n> - **00:01:17** – The sphere ceases rotation and remains stationary, as does Dr. Zhang.\n> \n> - **00:01:49** – Zhang sits cross-legged on the chamber floor. Not touching it. Not speaking.\n> \n> - **00:05:00** – The entity disintegrates. No residue. No trace. Zhang continues to sit for an additional 18 minutes.\n> \n> - **00:23:32** – Zhang leaves the chamber without interaction. Surveillance logs show she paused at the door to look back once before exiting.\n> \n**Post-Event Notes:**\n\nDr. Zhang has not submitted any post-test documentation regarding this merge, nor spoken to any Foundation staff since the event. Additionally, she has made no attempt to re-enter the chamber except to conduct standard Foundation-approved tests on SCP-7486. Dr. Zhang has begun to frequent Observation Wing 3 from 18:00 to 03:00 daily, entering with no other possessions. Closed-Circuit cameras show that Dr. Zhang always chooses the same seat, one facing the containment cell.\n\nAs of 31/5/20██, no new owner has been identified.\n\nSCP-7486 continues to glow faintly.\n\n\n**Remarks (Dr. Patel):**  \n“I don’t know what she thought it would do. She just sat there doing nothing. Maybe she was waiting for her conclusion? But what about the other three items? Maybe she thought it would react to her. \n\nMaybe she thought it saw or understood her.\n\nOr maybe she just needed to be seen by it.\n\nYet it didn’t look at her. I watched the tape three times.\n\nThough… it hasn’t dimmed either.”\n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:**  SCP-7486.png\n> **Author:** bharathsiddamjetix37\n> **License:** CC0\n> **Source Link:** [https://pixabay.com/illustrations/power-cube-rotation-geometric-1844603/ Pixabay]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-XXXW]]] | SCP-7486 | [[[SCP-XXXY]]] >>\n[[/=]]",
