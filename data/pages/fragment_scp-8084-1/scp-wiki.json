  "content": "**DATABASE ID:** SCP-8084\n\n**Anomaly Class:** Keter\n\n**Threat Level:** Black\n\n**CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:** As of July 4th, 1986, The United States DIA[[footnote]] Defense Intelligence Agency. [[/footnote]] has given full control of the \"ODEARL MOTORMOUTH\" project black site to the SCP Foundation, which has thusly been repurposed as Research Outpost 0015. Research Outpost 0015 is composed of 2 structures: The Geologic Complex, the warehouse built on top of the Subterranean Complex, and the Subterranean Complex itself, a laboratory equipped with temporary living quarters to accommodate personnel, and 4 containment chambers containing each instance of SCP-8084. The chambers are each fitted with 2 [[[scp-2820 |Scranton Reality Anchors]]] (SRAs), and the items themselves are held on blast-resistant slabs of steel, with metal chains providing additional security. No personnel are to enter the containment chambers at any point, and no testing of the objects will be permitted.\n\nThe Geologic Complex acts as a hangar for the on-site Stationary Task Force, Nu-7 (\"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#nu-7 Hammer Down]”). The majority of the STF is stationed in the Geologic Complex itself, divided into military staff and janitorial staff. Military staff operate both the perimeter of the Geologic Complex and all checkpoints within, as well as routine patrol of the building. Each corner of the Geologic Complex is fitted with an SRA.\n\nThe remaining members of Nu-7 are military scientists, stationed within the Subterranean Complex. A majority of its body is made up of paraphysicists, the remainder of the team is analytics and replication studies researchers. The analytics and replications team's primary function is to collect, organize, archive and interpret relevant documents provided by the United States military; the paraphysicist team is to use these findings to attempt to recreate SCP-8084's effects on a smaller scale, if possible.\n\nUnder the President's orders, the DoD[[footnote]]Department of Defense.[[/footnote]] has authorized the SCP Foundation to continue investigating the project.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-8084 denotes 4 explosive payloads, designed and developed by the United States government under the joint DoD-CIA[[footnote]]Central Intelligence Agency.[[/footnote]] project \"ODEARL MOTORMOUTH\".\n\nEach payload outwardly resembles a mundane Teller–Ulam configuration, the second-generation design of United States nuclear weapons ubiquitously known as the thermonuclear or hydrogen bomb, though they are far larger than the standard Teller–Ulam design[[footnote]]SCP-8084-1 through -3 are approximately eight times larger, whereas SCP-8084-4 is almost twenty times larger.[[/footnote]], and lack the original internal structure in totality, instead containing a hardened amberous medium encasing the fetus of a //Dosidicus gigas// (Humboldt squid). Organisms are at different stages of development across all SCP-8084 instances. The outer coatings of SCP-8084-2 and SCP-8084-4 have heavily oxidized since entering containment.\n\n**ADDENDUM -- CIRCUMSTANCES OF ACQUISITION:** On October 29th, 1985, President Ronald Wilson Reagan's administrative ambassador to the SCP Foundation requested a meeting between the O5 Council and the President, taking place in the [[[apotheosis of the rat |White House Underneath]]][[footnote]] The most secure area in the Washington D.C. tunnel system, used to move classified personnel to and from the Oval Office. [[/footnote]] later that day. The matter was described as highly urgent, necessitating immediate intervention.\n\nThe aforementioned parties would gather under the cover story of a contract negotiation between the White House and a private weapons contractor. The meeting was attended by the Factotums[[footnote]] Official designation for the O5 Council's body doubles, used for public appearances.[[/footnote]] of O5-1, -3, and -7[[footnote]]Governor-General of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, President of the Cuban Islands and Extraneous Territories, and Prime Minister of Israel and Jerusalem respectively[[/footnote]], CIA Director Marcus Keyes, DIA Director Jonathon Black, Department of Defense representative Edward Weston[[footnote]]Head of Security of the Insular Government of the Philippine Islands, Secretary of Patriotic Education of the Cuban Islands and Extraneous Territories, and National Security Advisor of Israel and Jerusalem respectively.[[/footnote]], as well as President Reagan and Vice President George H.W. Bush.\n\nA contract was laid out for SCP Foundation review: The US government would give jurisdiction of SCP-8084, \"ODEARL MOTORMOUTH\" documents, the project black site and associated materials[[footnote]] Including an algama statue to the Hawaiian deity Kanaloa, an altar cruet containing Humboldt squid semen, and an ornate \"Eye of Kanaloa\", a silver medallion belonging to the New Age Huna movement. [[/footnote]] to the SCP Foundation. In exchange, the US government would devote a portion of its military spending to the SCP Foundation for the remainder of Reagan's term.\n\nWhen questioned about the seemingly lax agreement's true intentions, President Reagan produced what he believed was the earliest form of schematics of SCP-8084 available to him. The schematics indicated each payload is capable of eliminating its chosen target at the conceptual level. Theoretically, a primed SCP-8084 instance would realize a form of energy destruction, or the annihilation of energy from a physical system, in direct violation of the principles of thermodynamics — in effect, anything within its blast radius would be completely removed from consensus reality. The proposed blast radius of the payloads varied, the largest item (SCP-8084-4) possessing a range of 130 kilometers.\n\nHe explained that the project was authorized sometime after the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, but their records were scarce.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nReagan then proceeded to point out that, though the US government was aware of 4 SCP-8084 payloads, the schematics indicated 5 had been built.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
