The discovery of such a large anomalous community existing without Foundation knowledge quickly prompted the Foundation to take action, and within a year Site-64 was successfully completed, providing the Foundation oversight for a region largely ignored up to that point.\n\nUnder the leadership of Director Hayden White, a former [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-81|Site-81]]] containment specialist, Site-64 quickly reined in the Portland anomalous art communities, driving most if not all of these groups into Three Portlands by the mid-1970s. Following this initial period, Site-64's activity substantially quieted down, with the site becoming little more than a storage warehouse for minor anomalous items confiscated by the region's mobile task forces. By the time of Director White's retirement in 1989, the facility had largely become considered a backwater.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=AR_logo_WBG.png|caption=Anderson Robotics trade logo, circa 2014.]]\n\nWhile the site was updated with additional facilities in the 1980's and 1990's, activity did not pick back up until 2007, following the discovery of the [[[Anderson Robotics Hub|Anderson Robotics]]] Group of Interest. Due to Anderson Robotics' use of Portland, Oregon and Three Portlands as a headquarters, MTF Gamma-13 (Asimov's Lawbringers) was created and based at Site-64. The spike in local anomalous activity associated with Anderson Robotic's founding prompted the construction of Site-64's Anomalous Materials, and Anomalous Electronics labs, as well as prompting additional MTFs to relocate to the facility, making it the region's foremost task force staging point.\n\nAs of 2016, Site-64 is recognized as one of the SCP Foundation's premier facilities along the US West Coast, and the top facility within the Pacific Northwest.\n\nIn addition to its other responsibilities, Site-64 was designated as the main point of contact between the Foundation and the Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Group of Interest. The following is an excerpt from the Boring Agreement which provides an overview of the site's relationship with Wilson's Wildlife Solutions:\n\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 5px\"]]\n**Boring Agreement Article 16 Section 4**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px\"]]\nSite-64 is to act as the primary point of contact between Wilson’s Wildlife Solutions and The Foundation to cooperate in the containment of anomalous fauna. Discussions regarding sharing resources, personnel and containment responsibilities are to take place once every two months, with the location of the meeting alternating between Site-64 and Wilson’s Wildlife Solutions Headquarters in Boring, Oregon. \n\nThese responsibilities are to be shared. It is important to emphasize that no single organization is meant to wield more or fewer responsibilities than the other. Site-64 has a plurality of anomalies to contain, and does not specialize in fauna, whereas Wilson’s Wildlife Solutions has only dabbled in the anomalous. \n\nSite-64 and Wilson’s Wildlife Solutions are to support one another but not interfere. Advise one another but not command. They are to cooperate, as containment is not a task that needs to be undertaken alone. \n\n[[/div]] \n@@@@ \n[[/div]]",
