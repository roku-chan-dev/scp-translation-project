The area affected by Incident-Selmsdorf is not to be reforested.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7055 was the collective term for two trees [[footnote]] Both trees being //Fraxinus excelsior//[[/footnote]] separated along the Inner-German Border from 1971 to 1990, designated SCP-7055-W (West) and SCP-7055-E (East). SCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were sentient, and able to communicate via  Morse code (by making “tapping” noises[[footnote]]It is unknown how these noises were produced[[/footnote]]). \n\nSCP-7055-W and SCP-7055-E were ideologically similar to the nations they presided in, with SCP-7055-W being western aligned, and SCP-7055-E being the opposite. This ultimately ended up causing political strife between the two trees, which culminated in Incident-Selmsdorf, following the collapse of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in 1991.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Incident-Report Selmsdorf\" hide=\"Close Incident-Report Selmsdorf\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:** This devolved into \"war\", in which, via unknown means, both SCP-7055 instances were set aflame. Following roughly 10 minutes of burning, both instances violently exploded. Altercation was logged and decoded by personnel assigned to SCP-7055.\n------\n**SCP-7055-W:** It seems the Russians have finally grown brains.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** No, they were simply uprooted by a Treedovik scrooge.\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** The Communist treembles before Western might, unable to escape from the bark ages and follow modern treends.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Treed carefully Capitalist.\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** No. This will be a domino treeffect, soon your treeacherous government will fall too.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Is that a threeat?\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** Also no. It's a promise if you continue your treespasses against me.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Look friend, you're barking up the wrong tree right now. You are also violating our treety, so let's leaf this all behind, yeah?\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** Concidering recent treevents, that treety is void. \n\n**SCP-7055-E:** What?\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** It's finally time for this treechery to end, Communism is a parasite, and there is only one treetment for parasites. I have mobilized all branches of my militree. Today, the Boreal Wall will fall!\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Treetorous Westerners, you lot always betreey those different from you. If it's a war you want, it's a war you're gonna get.\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** This is it: World War Tree. The newest entree to the ultimate treelogy of histree...And I can guarantree you it will be a Western victree. Another oakellant victory to end the centree- and another pineful failure for communist scum.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Oakay, how about we teak a step back...We can solve this quarrel if we simply eliminate the root of the problem at hand.\n\n**SCP-7055-W:** Stop with the flattree, I'm done attempting to negotiate with someone who has such extreemist beleafs.\n\n**SCP-7055-E:** Prepostreeous! You're just another fascist, another weak sap from Austreeia, a fool! I walnut stand by as you corrupt the people! As you refuse to discuss aldernatives, you leave me no choice! Today, yew and your aristoakcratic rule will end today!\n------\n[[=]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=fire\n| caption= Area surrounding SCP-7055 in flames following Incident.\n| align=center\n]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7054]]] | SCP-7055 | [[[SCP-7056]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** fire\n> **Name:** Waldbrand-Bodenfeuer\n> **Author:** Tilo\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Waldbrand-Bodenfeuer.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
