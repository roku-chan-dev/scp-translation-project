You know the drill! This year’s contest will be another **72-hour** JamCon, but other than that, the drill is the same. **The voting period extends for one week from the close of each theme.**\n\n[[include component:tz time=23:59 | tz=EST]]\n\n+ The Contest\n\nThe contest will be broken up into three periods of 24 hours each. At the beginning of each period, a **THEME** will be announced. From the moment the THEME is announced, contestants will have exactly 24 hours to write an article based on that theme. All contest articles posted for each period must adhere to that period's theme - if you write an article for the first period but only post it in the second period, that article will be disqualified. \n\nThe voting period consists of one week from the close of each individual theme. \n\nWinners will be determined by vote count at the end of the voting period. There will be first place winners for each category (ie SCP, Tale, GOI Format) for each theme, as well as a Grand Prize Winner for the entrant who writes for all three themes and amasses the highest overall vote count.\n\nYou are free to solicit as much critique as you can get within the time period. \n\n+ Rules:\n\n# Authors may submit any number of entries per theme. Only the three highest-rated entries (highest entry per theme) will be considered for voting totals.\n# All types of articles - SCPs, Tales, and GOI Formats - are allowed.\n# Entries can be as long or as short as you want, stretching over multiple articles or centered on a single page. \n# Authors do not have to submit entries for all three themes; you may pick and choose which themes to submit to, but only authors who submit entries for all three themes will be considered for the Grand Prize.\n# No significant edits after the entry has been posted. If you wouldn't do it to someone else's work, don't do it to your own until the contest ends.\n# Contest entries will go through the normal deletion process. As there is no limit on the number of entries you may post, you may always reenter. However, you may **not** repost a new version of a previously deleted entry in the contest. You can always submit these documents to the site again, but they cannot reenter the contest. \n# Entries must be new. You cannot edit or suggest an existing document for this contest.\n# As soon as a theme is announced, entries for that theme are OPEN. As soon as the NEXT theme is announced, entries for the PREVIOUS theme are CLOSED. You can still post articles for closed themes, but they will not be considered as valid entries.\n# No collaborative works for this contest, articles must be by a single author.\n# **Tag your entries with 'jam-con2021’, and the day's theme.**\n\n\nWinners will be chosen through total upvotes. At the conclusion of the contest, a post will be made by the judges announcing both winners and awarding special prizes to deserving entries. The judges for this contest are [[*user taylor_itkin]] and [[*user ProcyonLotor]] - please PM them with any further questions you might have.\n\n+ The Themes\n\n**Dawn of the First Day:** Marine\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Day One Winners\" hide=\"- Hide Day One Winners\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n++ **Top Three Overall (and SCPs):**\n# **[[[SCP-5929]]] (\"We Come In Piss\") by [[*user Rounderhouse]]**\n# [[[SCP-5527]]] (\"At The Bottom\") by [[*user J Dune]]!\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/danger-trunko Danger: Trunko!] by [[*user Ihp]]!**\n\n++ **Top Three Tales:**\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whalefall Whalefall] by [[*user DodoDevil]]!**\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/charybdis Charybdis] by [[*user CanOfSoup]]!\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/my-life-aquatic My Life, Aquatic] by [[*user GerrymanderBassist]]!\n\n++ **Top Three GoI Formats:**\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/danger-trunko Danger: Trunko!] by [[*user Ihp]]!**\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/manifest-476 Manifest 476: Vanishing Galleon] by [[*user Calibold]]!\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-chel Critter Profile: Chel!] by [[*user EthanHanson]]!\n\n**First Place Winners: please PM [[*user taylor_itkin]] with your feature request.**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n [[collapsible show=\"+ Show entries\" hide=\"- Hide entries\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[module ListPages  tag=\"+jam-con2021 +_marine -hub\" separate=\"no\"  perPage=\"100\"  rating=\">-20\"  order=\"random\"  prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Comments ||~ Author ||~ Rating ||\" categories=\"*\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%comments%% || %%created_by%% || %%rating%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n= [[iframe https://home.helenbot.com/tools/timer.html?time=1617076800000&type=Theme%201%20voting%20period%20ends%20in style=\"width: 500px; height: 250px; border: 0;\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n**Dawn of the Second Day:** Corruption\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Day Two Winners\" hide=\"- Hide Day Two Winners\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n++ **Top Three Overall (and SCPs):**\n# **[[[SCP-5383]]] (\"The Konami Code But For Catholicism (Suffer Overflow)\") by [[*user Rounderhouse]]**\n# [[[SCP-5648]]] (\"DOCTOR ROCKEFELLER (ALWAYS WITH TEETH)\") by [[*user J Dune]]!\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2014-012 Project Proposal 2014-012: \"Portraits of the Trees\"] by [[*user JakdragonX]]!**\n\n++ **Top Three Tales:**\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corruption-within-the-clown-industry Corruption Within The Clown Industry: A Controversial Opinion by Bambousio Starswinger] by [[*user Tropinano]]!**\n# (Tied for 2nd place) [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pumpkin-mystery The Pumpkin Mystery] by [[*user aismallard]]!\n# (Tied for 2nd place) [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ship-to-wreck Ship to Wreck] by [[*user Oboebandgeek99]]!\n\n++ **Top Three GoI Formats:**\n# **[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2014-012 Project Proposal 2014-012: \"Portraits of the Trees\"] by [[*user JakdragonX]]!**\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/mirror-to-america Project Proposal 2024-125: \"Mirror to America: A Reflection of You\"] by [[*user Joreth]]!\n# [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-black-vaults-of-alagadda The Black Vaults of Alagadda] by [[*user Cerastes]]!\n\n**First Place Winners: please PM [[*user taylor_itkin]] with your feature request.**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show entries\" hide=\"- Hide entries\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[module ListPages  tag=\"+jam-con2021 +_corruption -hub\" separate=\"no\"  perPage=\"100\"  rating=\">-20\"  order=\"random\"  prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Comments ||~ Author ||\" categories=\"*\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%comments%% || %%created_by%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n= [[iframe https://home.helenbot.com/tools/timer.html?time=1617163200000&type=Theme%202%20voting%20period%20ends%20in style=\"width: 500px; height: 250px; border: 0;\"]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Dawn of the Third Day:** \"What could possibly go wrong?\"[[footnote]]Please note: this theme is meant to be taken as liberally as you want to.
