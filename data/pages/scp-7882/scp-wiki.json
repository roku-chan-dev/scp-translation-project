Monitoring of SCP-7882 for any internal changes and predictive efforts focused on analyzing the potential path of any migrations it may take in the future have been assigned to Area-882's \"ANVIL\" General Intelligence System, which has been remotely connected to a terminal in Outpost-7882.\n\nThere currently exists --[DATA EXPUNGED]-- no method to permanently forestall SCP-7882's movement during migration events, nor prevent future migration events entirely, without damaging the object. As physical containment is not currently a concern, this does not warrant reclassification to Apollyon; however, such a method must be devised before SCP-7882 undergoes its next migration event (currently predicted to occur in the year 2211 AD).\n\n**Description:** SCP-7882 is a giant mechanical apparatus of poorly-understood anomalous function, currently stationed on a small island off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia. The object is encased by a spheroidal bronze shell measuring approximately 655 x 390 x 405 meters. This casing is ornately carved with glyphs in the Linear B script[[footnote]]Assumed to be of a thaumaturgic application that has since expired or is only utilized while SCP-7882 is in an active state. As an activation event --has [DATA EXPUNGED]-- has never been witnessed by Foundation personnel, this cannot be proven.[[/footnote]], and additionally decorated with vaguely humanoid figures, some with wings, in red paint[[footnote]]Neither this paint nor the bronze of SCP-7882's shell itself have shown signs of weathering or other forms of degradation over time, necessitating further investigation into anomalous preservation methods.[[/footnote]]. SCP-7882 exhibits extremely high inertial resistance to thaumaturgy and ontokinesis, and has thusfar proven impossible to move while in a dormant state.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=8\n|speed=80\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=https://i.imgur.com/1Ec8Sq0.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Above: A blueprint assembled by Area-882 personnel depicting SCP-7882's engine and propeller system (top), and a visualization of SCP-7882-1's clock (bottom).\n]]\n\nWhile in an active state, SCP-7882 is capable of autonomous movement over extremely long distances both in terrestrial environments[[footnote]]Though they have not yet been uncovered by Foundation personnel as have SCP-7882's aquatic locomotion systems (see the below paragraph), it is hypothesized the object has some means by which to travel across terrain.[[/footnote]] and underwater. Over a period of time spanning at least the past 2500 years, records indicate the object has independently circumnavigated the Indian and Pacific oceans several times before landing at its current location, successfully leading itself to dry land each time. It appears to enter an active state of motion every 199 years, based on records of past activity, before becoming dormant again upon reaching its destination[[footnote]]It is believed that SCP-7882 somehow intentionally \"chooses\" its destinations, a conclusion based on common data between the events that transpired at all known locations where the object has landed (see: History, Addendum 1).[[/footnote]].\n\nThe majority of mechanisms that make up SCP-7882 itself appear to serve one of two functions: either to enable the autonomous movement of the object[[footnote]]SCP-7882 has an engine and propeller system superficially resembling that of a submarine, presumably for this purpose.[[/footnote]], or to preserve and sustain SCP-7882-1. SCP-7882-1 is the central apparatus within SCP-7882; an elaborate clockwork device comprising a mechanical calendar of presumed astrological and cosmological importance. SCP-7882-1's other main component is a large analog clock built into the main surface of SCP-7882-1, the turning of which acts as impetus for the motion of several kinetic mechanisms of the aforementioned calendar device through an intricate system of clockworks and strings.\n\nSCP-7882-1 appears to be constantly counting down to an event in the future (hereafter ████-Ω, which is believed to also represent the beginning of the next cycle on the Mekhanite Long Count calendar system; see below excerpts) and seems able to accurately predict the time of this event's occurring[[footnote]]The elaborate nature of SCP-7882-1 has led some researchers to believe that the time at which ████-Ω will occur is based upon a number of complex and likely fluid factors which are monitored by SCP-7882 in some way. Possibly due to this, only a rough estimation can be ascertained as to when it will finish its count.[[/footnote]] through hypothesized thaumatological mechanisms.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=8\n|speed=80\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=400px\n|url=https://i.imgur.com/9zyr2Fk.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Above: An ordered sequence of timekeeping glyphs as found on the inverse of SCP-7882-1, likely meant to express the amount of time remaining until ████-Ω at the time SCP-7882 was constructed.\n]]\n\nThough an exact date cannot be ascertained, it is theorized that, should SCP-7882-1 continue to count towards the occurrence of ████-Ω at its current trend[[footnote]]That being a gradually-increasing pace.[[/footnote]], the calendar will reach completion by the mid-late 22nd century.\n\nThe internal casing of SCP-7882 possesses a number of inscriptions in Attic Greek -- unlike the Linear B on the object's outer surface, this text can be meaningfully translated into English as an account of various events. Below is a brief collection of excerpts from the writing inside SCP-7882, selected as the most essential to understand as contextual material by Area-882 personnel[[footnote]]Personnel who wish to access a complete list of SCP-7882 inscriptions should consult Document 7882-Gamma with permission of their supervisor.[[/footnote]].\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n{{THIS IS THE MARK OF THE TESTAMENT'S CREATORS, EIRENAIOS AND ISOKRATES.

Provided below is a timeline meant to brief personnel on the historical context of the object.\n\n||~ Year of Occurrence ||~ Event ||\n|| 973 BCE || SCP-7882 finishes construction. It is believed to have left Amoni for a currently-unknown destination in the same year, undergoing its first migration event. ||\n|| 774 BCE || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its second migration event. ||\n|| 575 BCE || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its third migration event. ||\n|| 376 BCE || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its fourth migration event. ||\n|| 177 BCE || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its fifth migration event. ||\n|| 22 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its sixth migration event. ||\n|| 221 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its seventh migration event. ||\n|| 420 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its eighth migration event. ||\n|| 619 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its ninth migration event. ||\n|| 818 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its tenth migration event. ||\n|| 1017 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its eleventh migration event. ||\n|| 1216 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its twelfth migration event. ||\n|| 1415 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its thirteenth migration event. ||\n|| 1614 AD || SCP-7882 is believed to undertake its fourteenth migration event. ||\n|| 1813 AD || SCP-7882 undertakes its fifteenth migration event. Documentation of this event is extensive compared to other SCP-7882 migration events due to first-hand records from colonial officers stationed in the Dutch East Indies near the object's landing. SCP-7882 remains in Indonesia at its most recent landing point to the present day. ||\n|| 1923 AD || SCP-7882 is rediscovered by the Foundation in Indonesia, matching descriptions from documents left behind by the Council of the Dutch East Indies' //Special Investigations Board//. Due to the object's giant size, its current position embedded in a hill, and the vegetation that had grown around it, the expedition that discovered SCP-7882 initially thought it to be a stationary subterranean temple complex. ||\n|| 1934 AD || Further explorations into SCP-7882 have by this point allowed the functions of several of its internal mechanisms to be determined and replicated by Foundation personnel. The Foundation becomes aware of SCP-7882's true nature following the publication of Dr. Andrey Jaspers's landmark 1934 research paper, //\"Research Conclusions Regarding SCP-7882 and their Consequences for the Study of Mechanical Auto-Eschatology\"//. ||\n|| 1936 AD || A number of reconstructed schematics depicting SCP-7882 components are leaked by Insurgent defectors. Though their source, and therefore the existence of SCP-7882 itself, remains unknown to most Groups of Interest, some occult organizations are able to effectively reverse-engineer the submarine technology described in the schematics, which later sees combat use in the Seventh Occult War. ||\n|| 1961 AD || Research efforts for SCP-7882, as well as reverse-engineering programs to better understand the object such as the production of new blueprints, are reassigned to Area-882. ||\n|| 2012 AD || --[DATA EXPUNGED]-- SCP-7882 does not undergo a migration event. ||\n|| --2012-2013 AD-- || --SCP-7882-1 shifts its predicted date for ████-Ω roughly two (2) centuries behind its previous schedule. Further research is ongoing.-- ||\n|| 2021 AD || SCP-7882-1 begins to count backwards at an inconstant pace for several days during the early stages of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500|SCP-6500]]] global crisis, before ceasing to function entirely for the remainder of the event[[footnote]]It is theorized that the effects of SCP-6500 temporarily interfered with the method by which SCP-7882-1 is able to effectively predict the time of ████-Ω's occurring, preventing it from counting towards said time as normal[[/footnote]]. Upon global EVE levels returning to expected levels after the SCP-6500 crisis, SCP-7882-1 seemingly corrected this offset and has since resumed normal function. ||\n\nIn analyzing the data surrounding all known SCP-7882 migration events, a significant commonality arises. Namely, on seemingly every occasion, the object lands at an inhabited site -- frequently harboring native tribes which are as of yet relatively uncontacted -- and is discovered and explored by the locals, immediately seeming to become a significant cultural object upon discovery.\n\nA persistent trend amongst all cultures contacted by SCP-7882 is the unnaturally quick tendency to create a collectively-held religious and mythological narrative around the anomaly, with the complete formation of these beliefs and conversion of the local population to them sometimes taking only a few years or less. In these cases, SCP-7882 itself is often featured as an object of worship, source of revelation, or holy shrine, and ████-Ω is commonly interpreted as a forthcoming eschatological event or other great shift of spiritual paradigm. In these cases, individuals in the exposed group tend to exhibit a significant degree of religious fervor with regards to the belief system synthesized upon contact with SCP-7882.\n\nThough this cannot be definitely ascertained, this appears to suggest the object possesses an additional anomalous property: namely, some form of memetic influence or compulsion which enables it to be anomalously successful at propagating its message[[footnote]]As to explain why, in all known cases, local civilizations contacted following an SCP-7882 migration event receive perceived \"divine revelations\" and reconcile their relationship with the object through the development of a belief system.[[/footnote]] through the medium of myth and religious imagery and ritual.\n\nBased on the aforementioned trend -- which is, as previously mentioned, in common throughout all known SCP-7882 migration events and their respective aftermaths -- it seems that SCP-7882 deliberately seeks out inhabited and relatively isolated areas as destinations, likely to: \n\n# Prolong some variation of Broken God religion by \"spreading\" its contained prophecies to new civilizations and cultural groups.\n# Inform said groups of ████-Ω in some way.\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ Addendum 7882.1: List of First Contact Events\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Designation:** Migration 7882-3\n\n**Landing Location:** Taveuni, Fiji, Melanesia\n\n**Discovered by:** Native islanders.\n\n**Anomalous Activity:** //Serpentidraco monocapitus// (one-headed basilisks) begin to appear on Taveuni and nearby islands. Locals gain anomalous augmentation technology which is used to biomechanically alter these organisms into a variety of forms. Modified organisms appear to be worshipped as religious idols of some kind, with omens being interpreted based on when they lay their eggs.\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Appears to be a synthesis of Archonic[[footnote]]Describing a family of cosmologically-interrelated religions and mythological canons originating from the late Neolithic and the Bronze Age. Defined largely by monolatry, occult involvement, and deities known as \"archons\" being a shared feature.[[/footnote]] faiths with Melanesian and Austronesian traditions. Degei, the supreme serpent-like god of native Fijian myth, appears to be recharacterized as a fusion between the Broken God and the Demiurge Važjuma. Creation myth bears similarity to the creation attested to in the Mekhanite mythology, with the aforementioned creator deity producing two \"cosmic eggs\" which birth the primal and logical aspects of human nature respectively[[footnote]]Johnson, B. (2001). //Heresies a World Away: Conflict of Mekhanite and Sarkic Influences in the Asia-Pacific Region// (1st ed., Vol. 2). Foundation Scientific Journal: Department of Mythology and Folkloristics.[[/footnote]]. SCP-7882 is believed to be the egg of logical nature, which adherents believe is currently reforming to usher in a golden age of human civilization upon hatching again.

It has been proposed that this advancement was derived or extrapolated from texts and carvings contained within SCP-7882, however this remains unknown.\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Contacted civilization creates a largely Mekhanite-Hindu syncretic belief system. The \"Aioun\" precession mentioned in carvings within SCP-7882 is equated to the Hindu Yuga cycle, of which ████-Ω is said to represent the upcoming end of the ongoing Kali Yuga. Adherents believe in the assimilation of the //Ātman// (self) into //Brahman//[[footnote]]The ultimate totality of cosmic existence or true essence of the divine in Hindu belief[[/footnote]] via transhumanism and bodily mechanical augmentation. Recent findings suggest this augmentation may also have been seen as a method to achieve //Nirvana//.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Designation:** Migration 7882-7\n\n**Landing Location:** Paracel Archipelago, South China Sea; sank into the sea shortly after landing due to shifting of islands from volcanic activity.\n\n**Discovered by:** A civilization of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-cn-985|sapient nurse sharks]]] (//Ginglymostoma cirratum//), after sinking underwater.\n\n**Anomalous Activity:** Contacted entities begin to etch replications of SCP-7882-1's calendar wheel into the seafloor, presumably using their tails and fins. These act as improvised thaumaturgic circles capable of channeling gravitational distortion properties. Said symbols are still used by the entities to aid in hunting and agriculture to this day.\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Religious system seems inspired by a combination of ancient Chinese cosmology and the history of First Occult War-era Mekhanite city-states. Oral tradition of the contacted civilization claims there once existed an above-water \"Builder\" civilization of technologically-advanced selachians living across the Aegean coast and islands in the ancient past, who worshipped an entity similar to the Broken God and created various mechanical marvels before being banished underwater by an \"envious and spiteful\" coalition of human states.\n\nSCP-7882 is thought to be a gift given to the shark population by said precursor civilization, created using their advanced technology. ████-Ω is believed to be an upcoming \"day of reckoning\" in which \"we (sharks) will finally ascend to the surface world and forever break free from (the) shackles of human oppression\"[[footnote]]Blackwood, T. (1858). //Diary #126: Lord Blackwood and the Shark-Folk of Prophecy// (1st ed., Vol. 1).

(1992). //An Intensive Investigation into the Merfolk of Makira// (1st ed., Vol. 2). Foundation Scientific Journal: Departments of Parabiology; Folkloristics; Cryptozoology; Spectral Affairs.[[/footnote]]. These entities display carnomantic thaumatological capability and acute technophobia for unknown reasons.\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Mythological narrative revolves around a divine figure believed to be adapted from Warohunugamwanehaora, a heroic character of Melanesian folklore. Described as a cunning explorer and pioneer, he is said to have placed the stars in the sky using a great hammer so that sailors may use them to navigate. Myth places this figure as the victim of attempted murder several times by his envious brothers, whom he ultimately defeats by dropping boulders down from the branches of an incredibly tall tree. \n\nThe trunk of this tree is often said to ascend into Heaven. When he reaches the top, Warohunugamwanehaora is struck down for trying to circumnavigate the planes of existence themselves, losing an arm and a rib in the process, and is forced to live as a mortal on Earth. \n\nSCP-7882 is supposedly a vessel constructed by Warohunugamwanehaora as a means to sail through the sky and be able to visit Heaven again; a place he had longed for since being exiled from its gates and forced to walk the land. The object is said to have fallen onto the island of Makira from the sky, implying it was abandoned midway through the voyage. Adherents were to act as custodians of SCP-7882, looking after it should Warohunugamwanehaora ever fall down to Earth again -- the date of this return was thought to be ████-Ω, until SCP-7882 departed from Makira to undergo its eleventh migration event.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Designation:** Migration 7882-12\n\n**Landing Location:** Kuril Islands\n\n**Discovered by:** Local Ainu clans.\n\n**Anomalous Activity:** Unknown\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Contacted civilization develops a synthesis religion combining Ainu animism and shamanism with Mekhanite reconstructionist theology. Adherents believe that the world possesses a fundamental conscious soul[[footnote]]Known as \"Kamuy Wahan\" in some sources[[/footnote]] which is currently \"broken\", causing many spirits and other entities to flee from Earth into other planes of existence. It is believed ████-Ω will herald either the repairing of the world's spirit or its irrevocable shattering, depending on whether adherents live pious and good lives.\n\nSCP-7882 is said to be a construction of several Ituren-Kamui[[footnote]]Comparable to spiritual guardians or observers. See: \"//Guardian Angels and you: Practical Applications of Benevolent Extracorporeal Entities in Containment//\" (Dr. E. Hudson, 1998).[[/footnote]] with the intention of guiding humankind along the correct path.

Upon exposure to SCP-7882, a sect emerges syncretizing the monotheistic God with Mekhane/WAN. Adherents venerate a number of prophets including several ancient Mekhanite religious figures in addition to the traditional series of abrahamic prophets recognized in Islam, seemingly as part of the same unified prophetic succession. Starkly contrasting most other Broken God religions, use of technology and artificial devices to represent or worship God is considered an attempt to physically represent the divine and forbidden. Mechanical artifacts typical in other Mekhanite and pseudo-Mekhanite societies, such as bodily augmentations, are deemed idols and destroyed.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Incident Designation:** Migration 7882-14\n\n**Landing Location:** Juan de Nova Island\n\n**Discovered by:** Native islanders.\n\n**Anomalous Activity:** Following contact with SCP-7882, native tribes inexplicably become able to establish a functioning trans-metaspatial gateway between baseline reality and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264|SCP-2264]]]-B (\"Alagadda\").\n\n**Religious Interpretation of SCP-7882:** Locals create a highly ritualistic doomsday cult known as the \"Final Masquerade\".
