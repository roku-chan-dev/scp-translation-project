[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Given the 1981 World Chess Championship, the sporadic nature in which SCP-7938 manifested, and the 2016 expiration of SCP-7938-B, future SCP-7938 events have been deemed impossible. No containment procedures are required, and SCP-7938's primary containment class has been designated, \"Neutralized\".\n\n**Description:** SCP-7938 was a supposed reality-bending temporal anomaly that occurred between July 18, 1978 - October 18, 1978. SCP-7938 consisted of SCP-7938-A, known as \"Anatoly Karpov\", and SCP-7938-B, known as \"Viktor Korchnoi\". The hypothesized manifestation of SCP-7938 is believed to have been contingent on the competition of both SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B in the 1978 World Chess Championship.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7938 was brought to the attention of the Foundation on October 18, 1978, when numerous transcribed chess games and recorded television broadcasts were found to have been documented on the SCP-7938 file. The validity of the existence of SCP-7938 is unverifiable, as information regarding the anomaly only exists within the SCP file.\n\nUpon being interviewed, SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B claimed to have no recollection of SCP-7938. Eyewitness information received suggested upon analysis that the relationship of SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B was at least partially altered following the supposed conclusion of SCP-7938 from what it was prior.\n\n[[=]]\n**Loading Logs.

Per FIDE rules, a win would count towards 1 point for the victor, 0 points for the loser, and a draw would result in both players gaining 0.5 points.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Game #1, July 18 | 1978\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Result:** Draw\n\n**Termination:** Unwilling bodily-movement\n\n**Details:** After 52 minutes, both players agreed to a draw and exited the room. Both players re-entered the room after 5-minutes and resumed the chess game for 254 moves until no further moves were theoretically possible. Staff that attempted to intervene were terminated via blunt force trauma.\n\n**Aftermath:** 21,900 civilians have been terminated by SCP-7938 in Baguio, Philippines. An evacuation was rapidly enacted during initial containment attempts.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Game #3, July 18 | 1978\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Result:** Draw\n\n**Termination:** Torn vocal cords\n\n**Details:** SCP-7938-A and SCP-7938-B proceeded to verbally berate each other for 49 consecutive hours. Game ceased with no progress made as both player's vocal cords were rendered unable to produce sound.\n\n**Aftermath:** An emergency meeting between the Ethics Committee, the Unreality Department, --O5-12--[[footnote]] Unavailable. [[/footnote]] O5-9, Mike Carlsen from the Site-17 Janitorial Staff, and the entire civilian population of Cuba was convened to determine a resolution pertaining to SCP-7938.\n\n**Resolution:** Assassinate Nigel Short 1 second after he becomes a Chess Grandmaster.[[footnote]] Resolution failed after the assassination was completed 1.4 seconds following Nigel Short becoming a Grandmaster.

SCP-7938-A consumed approximately 91.31% of SCP-7938-B's body mass. The remaining 8.69% of SCP-7938-B's person proceeded to reconstruct itself into a functioning brain and skeletal system and resign, prior to exiting the facilities of the match and expiring.\n\n**Aftermath:** A bovine in London[[footnote]] Close in proximity to London. [[/footnote]] rapidly assumed the form of SCP-7938-B shortly following the conclusion of the game. A second bovine in close proximity rapidly assumed the form of a business suit that SCP-7938-B promptly adorned.\n\nThe rancher has been compensated for the loss of her cows with an equal weight of McDonald's ketchup packets[[footnote]] Each partially used.

Every great sport is full of infamous rivalries. Like, the uh... Tennis! Probably. Soccer teams probably hate each other. The point is, rivalries are very popular! So, why not build on some tension? \n\n**???:** I see. What exactly is your goal with this whole thing?\n\n//The entity laughs.//\n\n**???:** To see a World Chess Championship produce the World Chess Champion. Simple as that. But, we hopefully can generate eyes like the 1972 Championship did. \n\n**???:** A noble goal.\n\n//A third copy of the same man walks up to the reporter on the desk and whispers into the reporter's ear.//\n\n**???:** Reports indicate that the 31st game has concluded in a draw. They state that Korchnoi, after losing his queen, consumed all of the pieces on the board and declared a stalemate. Karpov, unable to interject, agreed to the draw.\n\n**???:** Well then, I best get going to organize the 32nd. Hope to be back later!\n\n//End of broadcast.//\n\n-----\n\n**Note:** Two masses of bones, organs, and flesh lacking skin materialized in New York, United States following the broadcast.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Game #47, July 18 | 1978\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Result:** SCP-7938-B winning\n\n**Termination:** Incineration\n\n**Details:** After 148 moves, SCP-7938-A experienced rapid internal-combustion via interference brought by SCP-7938-B. The undamaged remains of SCP-7938-A's nervous system and brain proceeded to concede the game and collapse into a pile of ash.\n\n**Aftermath:** San Marino has annexed the Soviet Union.

Though mostly evenly balanced throughout the game, on move 35 SCP-7938-A began to gain the advantage prior to a series of blunders by SCP-7938-B, causing massive material loss. On move 41, seeing no way to recover the position, SCP-7938-B resigned the game, resulting in SCP-7938-A winning the World Chess Championship.\n\n**Aftermath:** What happened never happened. We will make sure it never happens again.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-7938 concluded after 391 years with SCP-7938-A winning 28,544.5 - 28,443.5 against SCP-7938-B. \n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7937]]] | SCP-7938 | [[[SCP-7939]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
