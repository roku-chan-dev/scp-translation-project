The origin of the image is unknown.|width=300px]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-296 is the designation given to the Cresswell Theatre in Arkansas, USA. Said theater was used for leisure purposes from 1940 to 1976, staying for a long period of time as one of the most important entertainment sites of the state due to the large amount of theatre plays that were staged there. However, SCP-ES-296's structure was, before its acquisition by Ron Cresswell, approximately 20 years old, being this shown in its facade, which has an architecture similar to those used in the //Art Deco//[[footnote]] Architectonic style used during the 1920s.[[/footnote]], frequently used during the date of its construction.\n\nAny individual that enters SCP-ES-296 will find themselves involved in what is currently believed to be a number of visual and acoustic hallucinations of undetermined nature. Due to this, the only available medium of communicating inside SCP-ES-296 is the use of electronic devices.[[footnote]]Despite this, it should be noted that communication lines will be seriously distorted sometimes.[[/footnote]] Additionally, it is believed that SCP-ES-296 may have extradimensional properties, as its only known functional exit is its own entrance door.\n\nAll testimonies, except the initial log, have reported on several occasions the presence of short melodies in the auditorium section, as well as inaudible conversations in the dressing rooms.[[footnote]]See Addendum ES-296/A.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum ES-296/A:** Discovery\n\nThe Foundation found SCP-ES-296 in early 1977 due to rumors regarding anomalous events behind its doors; however, it wasn't until mid 2002 that SCP-ES-296 was put in containment after several calls were made to local authorities by a 16-year-old teen known as Harrison Roth from the Rison locality, which is 2km away from SCP-ES-296. An excerpt of the call is shown below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= [[size 140%]]Call Transcription[[/size]]\n----\n**Subject:**\n* Harrison Roth\n----\n= **[**BEGIN LOG**]**\n----\n\n**911:** Arkansas 911, how may we help you?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** They've taken my friends.

We tried to follow them to know what they were, c-carefully, very carefully, but they suddenly stopped. When I realized I was alone, I-\n\n//(Sobs)//\n\n**Harrison Roth:** I heard them scream, run, and- //(Pause)// being crawled. T-then I also heard several footsteps towards me, so I opened a door to hide. I stayed hidden in the bathroom and I didn't- didn't come out. I heard a man muttering and knocking on the door.\n\n**Harrison Roth:** Eventually, the door opened. Some hours had passed, I-I think, and then I ran away when I checked there was nothing. I didn't look back, I just- just...\n\n//(Harrison Roth screams and continues crying)//\n\n**Harrison Roth:** I left them alone, on their own. How am I going to look Jacob's mother in the face? How-\n\n//(Silence)//\n\n**911:** I see. Could you tell me where are you right now?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** E-eh, I don't know, I'm in the middle of a field.\n\n**911:** Near the building you mentioned?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** K-kind of, yeah.\n\n**911:** Do you think you can surround it to get to the side of the road so the patrol can see you once they arrive?\n\n//(Harrison Roth's breathing accelerates notably)//\n\n**911:** Hello?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** //(Hyperventilating)// I'll try, but please, don't hang up, I n-need...\n\n**Harrison Roth:** I need to talk with somebody, please.\n\n**911:** Don't worry, Harrison. I'll be here.\n\n**Harrison Roth:** Thank you, really, t-thank you.\n\n**911:** Try to breathe, don't worry. Did something else happen after what you told me? \n\n//(Harrison Roth stays silent for a while, and hyperventilates again)//\n\n**911:** Harrison?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** Yes, something else happened.\n\n**911:** If I may ask, what was it?\n\n**Harrison Roth:** //I swear, I truly swear and promise that somebody said \"[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3935 hi]\" while I was running.//\n----\n= **[**END LOG**]**\n------\n[[/div]]\nWhen the authorities arrived in search of Harrison Roth[[footnote]]Currently missing.[[/footnote]], they were victims of SCP-ES-296's anomalous properties. After inspecting the zone, nothing was found; posterior investigations on the building's facade showed that a group of teenagers had been there. All individuals related to the investigation and Harrison Roth, as well as his friends, were amnesticized.\n##white|,,We're all here. Absolutely everybody.,,##\n**Addendum ES-296/B:** Historical Registers.\n\nSCP-ES-296 was originally founded in 1940 by Ron Cresswell, born American, thirty-four years old then. Ron Cresswell was a notable 23rd Generation Student of the Kirk Lonwood High School, in where he'd stay during his teen years. Ron Cresswell was, at the time, adept at both music and theatre, as well as other literary art forms.\n\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-es-296/ron.png|caption=Ron Cresswell, picture taking in 1930 at the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-332 Kirk Lonwood High School]|width=250px.]]\n\nDuring those years, Ron Cresswell formed a group of intellectuals focused on music and literature. Said group would end up becoming a closed club in the high school that managed both the administration of a part of the orchestra and the impulse of arts in the institution. The exact date on which the group was founded is uncertain, but it is known by Ron Cresswell's declarations that part of the idea of creating SCP-ES-296 would come from that group.\n\nThis led to, ten years after graduating, the foundation of the Cresswell Theatre. The objective of this theater was to offer high schools from several nearby states and Arkansas itself the chance to exhibit their best works and collect with them a considerable amount of money for the centers themselves. However, all the works that were presented had an exhaustive analysis both by Cresswell himself and by multiple professionals from the world of theater in order to ensure the works presented were of impeccable quality and further boost the fame of the site.\n\nPrior to the arrival of Ron Cresswell, the building was abandoned and all registers before his acquisition have been lost or destroyed.\n\nThe Cresswell Theater had some financial difficulties during its early years; however, it gained moderate notoriety and became one of the most famous theater exhibition centers of its time, especially during the sixties, where a large number of works were exhibited, of which there is currently no record. However, there is also evidence of a large number of cancellations of multiple projects proposed by Ron Cresswell himself.\n\nDespite this, the Cresswell Theatre was abandoned sometime in 1976. The reasons for this remain unknown to this day. The only register related to said date belongs to a publicity booklet.\n\nAccording to some testimonies given by individuals who knew Cresswell, he had been, in the last years of the theater, estranged from his friends.\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n++ __**{{Cognitohazard Warning!}}**__\n\n{{The following file may have corrupted images, words, and other content that may actively harm viewers.

Additionally, the main door and only known entrance to SCP-ES-296 were blocked, making any type of struggle unfeasible. At 1:00 AM, a melody was recorded inside SCP-ES-296 of currently unknown origin. The containment personnel was affected by it, after which the doors of SCP-ES-296 opened and the entire investigation and containment body entered it.\n\nAt 4:56 AM, all individuals left SCP-ES-296 and its surroundings, to later return to their usual positions. However, it is known that a percentage of the staff was affected [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2316 in a more severe way]. --All of the subjects who were disturbed during said event stated that they did not remember anything of what happened during those hours.-- Two days after the incident, Senior Researcher Tristan Poole claimed to have remembered a large part of what happened. A transcription of an interview carried out is shown below.\n----\n||**Camcorder Recording Transcript**||\n**In Attendance:**\n* Dr. Andrés Mondragón\n* Res.

Tristan Poole:** For having been inside a containment breach of a memetic anomaly, I'm doing relatively well, yes.\n\n**Dr. Andrés Mondragón:** Good to know, when they told me that you were involved as chief researcher in SCP-ES-296 and that happened, I thought that you would have fallen into a trance or something similar.\n\n**Res. Tristan Poole:** Nothing further from the truth, Andrés.\n\n//(Pause)//\n\n**Dr. Andrés Mondragón:** So I guess I can ask you directly what happened, and what you think might have caused such an unusual reaction.\n\n**Res. Tristan Poole:** Well, you could say that what happened was something similar to when I was about to finish high school when I went to see The Mousetrap, I don't want to take too many unnecessary turns, but that was the feeling I had. I've never been a big fan of the theater, but maybe being with my partner at the time made me feel quite excited.\n\n**Res.
