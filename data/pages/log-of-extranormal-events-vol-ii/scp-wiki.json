Instead, the Foundation deploys a cover-up team to conceal the evidence from the public. This is merely a reminder to agents and researchers that not all of them can be contained.\n> -Agent Carriontrooper\n\nThis is the second volume of the log, and remains open to new entries. The [[[log-of-extranormal-events| first volume ]]] has been archived.\n\nLists of [[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Items]]] and [[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Locations]]] have also been compiled. \n\n------\n \n//**Note:** Please add new entries to the bottom of the list, not the middle or the top.//\n\n**Event Description:** Several students abruptly stopped talking and began chanting in an unknown language.

After Level 2 Researcher Stewart Clemens attempted this 66 times as personal experimentation, the word \"Wikidot\" was retrocausally burnt into his computer screen at some point during its creation.

Over the course of the next six hours, the avocado gradually shrunk to its original size.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2007/06/17\n**Location:** Lima, Peru\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Survivors were treated for injuries and administered amnestics. A Foundation front company claimed responsibility, saying a plane in their fleet began had started shedding parts as it was flying overhead.\n\n**Event Description:** At an anime convention in ████████, California, all of the figurines within the exhibition hall suddenly came to life, acting like their character counterparts. Many began to fight each other, while others seemed to react with curiosity, fear, or excitement. After five minutes, all figurines reverted to their original positions and ceased their anomalous activities.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 02/██/2023\n**Location:** ████████, California\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses to the event given class A amnestics, all footage of the event destroyed, and all figurines recalled and incinerated.\n\n**Event Description:** A bipedal horse spontaneously manifests on a subway track at 10:54AM, vocalizing the phrase, \"Rehab was supposed to be a fresh start,\" before being struck by an oncoming train.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11/4/2012\n**Location:** Dundalk, Maryland\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** All witnesses amnesticized,  footage of the event destroyed\n\n**Event Description:** For five days, every female human within a 20km radius began dancing the //Macarena// chanting the phrase \"Він приходить, і він не радий.\"  //\"He's coming, and he's not happy.\"// Multiple women were hospitalised due to exhaustion or accidents, with at least five (5) deaths attributed to the event. \n**Date of occurrence:** 11-16/██/2022\n**Location:** Mariupol, Ukraine\n**Follow-up Actions Taken** All witnesses amnesticized. Cover story of mass hysteria given. All footage of the event intentionally corrupted. \n\n**Event Description:** At 2344:57.48, twenty-nine (29) of the sixty-four (64) anomalous objects housed at an AO Storage Room underwent complete de-manifestation from their designated containers. It is unclear whether the objects were displaced to alternative location(s) or dematerialized, ceasing to exist.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2013-10-02\n**Location of Occurrence:** Anomalous Objects Storage Room #6, Site-19.\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Given the low containment status of the missing objects and the overall minimal threat to civilian populations, search operations are presently classified as low priority. Field agents have been allocated the pertinent documentation corresponding to each Anomalous Object (AO) to facilitate prompt identification in the event of an encounter.\n\n**Event Description:** During a period spanning from 1447 to 1532 hours, shadows cast by on-site personnel were observed to detach from their owners and exhibit independent movement. These detached shadows displayed signs of sentience, engaging in interactions with other shadows via complex movements and gestures, similar to non-verbal communication between animals. Approximately 45 minutes later, the shadows returned to their respective owners, concluding the event.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2018-02-19\n**Location of OccFurrence:** Site-81.\n**Follow-up Actions Taken:** Due to the event taking place within a secure facility, no follow-up actions are considered necessary.\n\n**Event Description:** A painting in a museum, featuring a policeman in 19th-century British uniform, suddenly animated and began gesturing and attempting to speak to museum visitors.

The creature then slowly regained its quadrupedal stance, rubbed its head against the vehicle's hood to remove glass from its face, and finally called Bates an \"amateur\" before fleeing.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2023-10-25\n**Location of Occurrence:** Road ███, Sasakwa, Oklahoma, USA\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Despite Bates having a BAC of 0.11, her account was confirmed via the vehicle's dashboard camera. Blood taken from the scene was determined to belong to an //Odocoileus virginianus//[[footnote]] White-tailed deer [[/footnote]], but no individual match was found in Foundation databases. Bates was placed on unpaid suspension for two weeks for reckless activity and offered amnesticization for the incident, but refused. The deer has not been located.\n\n**Event Description:** While patient Gao ███████ was awaiting the results of his recent medical tests, four humanoid entities in striped red suits emerged from a nearby supply closet and burst into song. After six minutes of singing about a cryptic secret they were keeping from Gao, the four harmoniously informed him that he had stage II testicular cancer before retreating into the closet.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2024-06-07\n**Location of Occurrence:** ████ ███████ Hospital, Zhongxi, Ningguo, Xuancheng, Anhui province, China\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** One witness amnesticized, relevant camera footage seized.

The pink flamingos are resemblant to plastic flamingos used as lawn decorations made in 1957, with different features such as two legs. The flamingos ranged in height from roughly 90ft to 110ft. The exact amount of flamingos is unknown, but it is speculated that there were about 7-8. Three people died as a result of a car crash caused by one of the flamingos after it had suddenly appeared on the road at ██████ intersection.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2016-9-26\n**Location Of Occurrence:** ██████ City, New South Wales, Australia.\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Mass Class-A amnesticization of ██████, cover up of three casualties, and free repair to damaged vehicles.\n\n**Event Description:** All Site-17 personnel received a bloody nose at exactly 02:41 hours from an indiscernible cause. Bleeding did not cease for a total of four (4) minutes and twenty six (26) seconds.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2010-6-25\n**Location of Occurrence:** Site-17, [DATA EXPUNGED].\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** None.\n\n**Event Description:** A large (approximately 3 meters high) entity resembling a potato with spindly arms and legs manifested at a grocery store and began wandering the aisles as best it could given its size.  As it did so, it repeatedly called out as though trying to find some other entity; this is purely speculation, as its words were in an as-yet-unidentified language.  After 7 minutes and 35 seconds, the entity abruptly demanifested.\n**Date of Occurrence:** June 30th, 2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** Boise, ID\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** As the event occurred when the store was closed, the only witness was a local homeless man, who was asleep at the time, rendering amnestic treatment unnecessary.  Security camera videos were copied for Foundation review; the originals were deleted.  The store was placed under Foundation surveillance for one year in case of further anomalous incidents.  Foundation linguists are in the process of identifying the language used by the entity.\n\n**Event Description:** For a period of exactly 16 minutes and 23 seconds, every individual cockroach located in the state of South Carolina gained sapience and the ability to vocalize English. \n**Date of Occurrence:** 2024-08-20\n**Location of Occurrence:** South Carolina, USA \n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics were deployed via aerosol over the entire state of South Carolina,  a cover up story of a hoax implemented, and all footage of the event found on the internet seized. \n\n**Event Description:** Two humanoid figures were observed engaging in melee combat 20 meters above the ground. Both weapons (a sword and a staff) appeared to be composed of flame. Both combatants abruptly disappeared 5 minutes after manifestation, when both impaled each other.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 1990-11-15\n**Location of Occurrence:** Adelia Maria, Argentina.\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken**: Witnesses amnestized and footage confiscated without incident. Investigation into possible involvement of American writer James Oliver Rigney Jr. provided no results. \n\n**Event Description:** At approximately 1:59, the number of vehicular accidents recorded in both Maryland and New Jersey swapped, as did their current rate of vehicular accidents and fatalities. Additionally, all references of dangerous driving in one state now references the other, and all references to \"Jersey Drivers\" have been replaced by \"Maryland Drivers\" in conversation. This has also affected all media on the matter, changing footage and speech to match this alteration.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 1995-09-04\n**Location of Occurrence:** Worldwide, primarily affecting New Jersey and Maryland, USA\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All documents and footage that no longer make any sense following the swap have been erased or altered. Foundation personnel in the media regularly reinforce the attribution of this perceived change to the Mandela Effect.\n\n**Event Description:** At 3:22, all staff that have ever been reported missing at Site-322 spontaneously reappeared at the Site entrance with pink collars around their necks, each labeled with their name. This included staff that were later found dead, but any that were found alive exhibited no known anomalous effects during this event. Simultaneously, all documentation regarding their disappearances were expunged by [EXPUNGED].\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2024-10-26\n**Location of Occurrence:** Site-322\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Affected individuals observed to have no anomalous properties and no memory of their disappearances, and are being held in humanoid containment at Site-322. Requests from affected individuals to resume work are awaiting approval.\n\n**Event Description:** Three Bic-brand ballpoint pens in Dr. ███████'s Office spilled ~5 gallons of ink before animating, with sections of their cases forming into rudimentary arms and legs. They then attempted to attack Dr. ███████ via throwing small objects at him for ten minutes before their limbs snapped back into place and they became inert. When questioned, he admitted to having broken a ballpoint pen a week prior to the incident in a fit of anger.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2024-09-27\n**Location of Occurrence:** Dr. ███████'s Office, Site-██\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Dr. ███████ has been required to take an on-site anger management course. Related security footage archived for Foundation investigation.\n\n**Event Description:** At 8:12, 9:45, 10:37, 11:52, 13:13, 14:20, 16:08, and 17:49, every person on Earth blinked at exactly the same time, with their blinks all lasting the exact same amount of time. During each of these simultaneous blinks, time skipped forward a cumulative 10 milliseconds, with the last instance lasting 80 milliseconds. Footage of the event shows that, whenever such a blink occurred, everyone on Earth froze in place while everything around them continued to move as normal. This led to approximately five thousand two hundred eighty-seven (5,287) accidents worldwide.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 10-27-2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** Worldwide\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All footage of the event is being scrubbed, though the effort is taking several days. Witnesses that saw the unaltered footage are being administered Class A amnestics. Worldwide instance of gaps in security footage is under the cover story of a major cybersecurity incident.\n\n**Event Description:** Three human cadavers in various stages of decay manifested in the Site-17 Cafeteria holding a plastic bowl of various candy bars. Subjects remained still for several minutes before one of the entities animated and exclaimed that they had arrived late for “the Halloween special”. The three entities demanifested seconds later, though the bowl of candy remained. \n**Date of Occurrence:** 11-04-2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** Site-17 Cafeteria \n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Candy and bowl inspected for anomalous properties. When deemed nonanomalous, candy was distributed among Site-17’s staff and contained anomalies. \n\n**Event Description:** The air in a 250m radius was filled with a dew composed of liquid lard, and an approximately 30cm bipedal creature made of sour cream manifested from a trash can. Shortly afterwards, six (6) more creatures of the same height also manifested from the same trash can, made of shredded lettuce, guacamole, pico de gallo, nacho cheese, refried beans, and tortilla chips, respectively. All seven (7) figures began attempting to destroy all Mexican-American themed items being sold in the area, as well as the nearby T███ B███. No one was injured, as the anomalous creatures lacked the strength required to defend themselves. The anomaly was unknowingly neutralized by three (3) police officers using their handguns.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11-05-2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** Elkton, Maryland, United States \n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Witnesses administered Class A amnestics. Ammunition from discharged weapons replaced to prevent discrepancies, and cleanup crews dispatched to the area. Area temporarily closed off for cleanup, under the cover story of a mentally unstable individual discharging their weapon in public.\n\n**Event Description:** All containers of cottage cheese in the building underwent anomalous transformation, with the containers themselves forming tiny plastic cottages while the curds became maggots. Simultaneously, an announcement was heard over the loudspeaker, which said \"Attention all employees! Please make your //whey// to the dairy department!\" All employees of the store present in the building, excluding the store owner, then proceeded to drop onto their bellies and squirm to the dairy section before devouring as many maggots as they could.\n**Date of Occurrence:** 11-09-2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** T█████, Aberdeen, Maryland, United States \n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Class A amnestics dispersed via ventilation systems. Remaining cottage cheese and plastic cottages were taken for containment, but ceased to be anomalous in transit, and are currently held in refrigerated storage. Employees resumed regular behavior after being amnesticized. Missing cottage cheese attributed to a recall. The voice on the intercom is pending identification, but has been confirmed to not be any store employee.\n\n**Event Description:** All personal beverage containers within the legal borders of Site-27-A, along with their contained liquids and any paraphernalia used for them, suddenly dematerialized between the times of 0730 and 0732. By coincidence, all personal beverage containers on-site were outside the line of sight of personnel and security cameras. Two weeks after this event, all displaced beverage containers suddenly reappeared in the office of Marine Anomalies Department head of Site-27, Dr. Lawrence M. during routine maintenance of the security camera of Dr. Lawrence M.'s office.\n**Date of Occurrence:** December 2, 2024\n**Location of Occurrence:** Site-27-A, [REDACTED]\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** All displaced personal beverage containers have been replaced by the Foundation, and were later returned to their owners following their reappearance.\n\n**Event Description** At 21:46 a barrage of three thousand twenty-meter tungsten rods entered Earth's atmosphere and converged upon the city of Harafax, obliterating all organic and non-organic matter in a 5,490.35 km^^2^^ radius. In the following five minutes after the orbital bombardment, SCP-████ was discovered in the bottom of the crater left by the rods, and was contained. Approximately 30 minutes after the event, the city of Halifax spontaneously manifested in the crater where Harafax stood. All records of Harafax were found to have never existed and were replaced with Halifax in its entirety. The only record of this event was a report from Lunar Foundation Exclusion Site-███, which apparently resided at the location of the Aitken basin. \n**Date of Occurrence** January 12, 2025\n**Location of Occurrence** Halifax, Nova Scotia\n**Follow-up Actions Taken** Considering that the city of Harafax and Lunar Exclusion Site-███ have never existed, no actions are currently being taken.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ACCESS RESTRICTED TO O5 COUNCIL\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n**Event Description:** A 387 kilobyte image titled \"heseesusandlaughs.jpeg\", stored on a computer in the Anomalous Items department while awaiting Anomalous Item designation, suddenly distributed itself to every computer in the department. The file deleted itself upon being seen for more than 5 seconds, even without being opened, and is said to have contained a picture of [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]. Anyone that viewed this file, even indirectly, or heard of its contents from an affected individual, later attempted to stage a strike at Site-19, citing the tyrannical actions of O5-237 despite no such figure existing. \n**Date of Occurrence:** 02-01-2025\n**Location of Occurrence:** Site-19\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** Disinformation campaign is currently underway to keep the location of Site-19 anonymous. Risk of Lifted Veil Scenario successfully mitigated via widespread deployment of amnestics. Due to the self-deleting nature of this anomaly, all attempts to preserve any copies of the image have failed so far.\n//Note: \"This should go on as a cautionary tale that even the smallest, most seemingly inert things we deal with here can become a bigger problem down the road. Even one little image, piece of paper, or whatchamacallit could have potentially debilitating effects on the Foundation if mishandled. We're the Anomalous Items department, not the Insignificant Items department. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm on my way to get poked, because I already wanted to quit this job before I reported on this thing.\" —Dr. Frisk//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Event Description:** A man spontaneously gained knowledge on the construction of a [[[scp-4322|Class-IV psychoreceptor]]] using only materials found in his garage. Being an engineer who enjoyed building various creations, he then produced a working model, which was then used to briefly communicate with [REDACTED].\n**Date of Occurrence:** 2001/03/09\n**Location:** Blaine, Minnesota\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** The man was amnesticized and his construction was confiscated for study. Techniques used in its construction have been used in the improvement of psychoreceptive equipment used by the Foundation.\n\n****\n****\n****\n****\n\n------\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include component:license-box author=Anonymous]]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
