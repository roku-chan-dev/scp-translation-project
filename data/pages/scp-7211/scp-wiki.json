It is to be placed on a pedestal and shielded with impact-resistant glass during experiments. Only one subject at a time is allowed to be in the testing chamber with SCP-7211.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7211 is a 40 cm tall porcelain doll resembling a human male dressed in a red jester uniform, it is noted to have a distressed expression on its face. SCP-7211's anomalous properties will be triggered if there is at least one human being in SCP-7211's close proximity (2 meters or closer).\n\nOnce its anomalous properties are triggered SCP-7211 will become animate and start to speak. Usually, there is no conversation between SCP-7211 and the subjects, it usually stands up in front of the subjects and starts to tell various jokes, and puns. If the subjects don't find SCP-7211's performance funny they will start to cause self-harm and showcase temporary anomalous properties. (See Experiment log). \n\nIf the subject leaves SCP-7211's vicinity regardless of willingly or not, SCP-7211 will return to its dormant state. Interviewed subjects described the experience as \"second-hand embarrassment cranked up to eleven\" in unison. \n\n**Experiment log:**\n\n||~ **Subject** ||~ **Joke**||~ **Result**||\n|| D-8567 || I'm afraid for the calendar. Its days are numbered. || The chair D-8567 was sitting on suddenly transformed into a 100 kg tomato. D-8567 tried to lift it up and throw it at SCP-7211 but it was too heavy for him. ||\n|| D-1462 || How do you follow Will Smith in the snow? You follow the fresh prints. || D-1462 began to scream then a glass window manifested on the wall and D-1462 jumped through it. The window itself disappeared and D-1462 was later found lying unconscious on Site Director Katona's office desk. ||\n|| D-9966 || I only know 25 letters of the alphabet. I don't know y. || D-9966 ripped off both of his legs from mid-thigh and swallowed them whole then both legs grew back. ||\n|| D-0007 || Why couldn't the bicycle stand up by itself? It was two tired. || D-0007 transformed into a bicycle and attempted to run over SCP-7211. Once the security personnel removed him from the testing chamber D-0007 transformed back but for the next two hours, he was only able to make sounds similar to a bicycle bell instead of human speech. ||\n|| D-2377 || I once had a dream I was floating in an ocean of orange soda. It was more of a Fanta-sea. || D-2377 yelled \"I'm sick of this planet!\" and his uniform transformed into a Superman costume then he breached containment by flying through the ceiling but later he was recaptured when he approached [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-lunar-area-32|Area-32.]]] His anomalous properties ceased an hour later.||\n|| D-4544 || I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it. || A bottle of Class-â–ˆ amnestic agent manifested in D-4544's hands which he drank resulting in the loss of at least five years of memories. ||\n||D-4269[[footnote]]Using D-4269 for the test was originally recommended by the rest of the Site-228's D-Class personnel population because he is infamous for having a bad sense of humor. [[/footnote]] || When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent. || D-4269 began to laugh so hard that he started to hyperventilate and was transferred to the medical wing. ||\n\nFollowing the experiment with D-4269, SCP-7211's facial expression turned from distressed to cheerful and refused to tell jokes to subjects except for D-4269.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7210]]] | SCP-7211 | [[[SCP-7212]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
