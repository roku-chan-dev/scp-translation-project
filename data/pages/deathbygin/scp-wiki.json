[[/footnote]] into .scp formatted articles. For documentation purposes, Staff #4-C107 is currently assigned as a Technical Writer at Site-65.\n\nStaff #4-C107's open-ended AI allows it to implement new documentation without the need to alter the program's source code. Several staff, however, have introduced expletives and slang vocabulary to Staff #4-C107.[[footnote]]Staff involved have been appropriately reprimanded with mild termination. [[/footnote]] As a consequence, .scp documentation that is outputted by Staff #4-C107 must be reviewed and corrected as needed prior to submission.\n\nAttempts at reintroducing professional and clinical vocabulary to Staff #4-C107 are currently underway. A \"reward system\" has been sideloaded into the program and is controlled remotely via two inputs. When Staff #4-C107 completes a document deemed clinical and appropriate, the first input[[footnote]] Labelled with a \"+\". [[/footnote]] is pressed resulting in the rewriting of several bits of code which simulates pleasure. On the contrary, if a document completed is deemed unacceptable, the second input[[footnote]] Labelled with a \"-\". [[/footnote]] is pressed which causes a similar process to occur, though simulating intense pain instead.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
