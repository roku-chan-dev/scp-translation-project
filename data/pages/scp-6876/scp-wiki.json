Foundation personnel are to be explicitly restricted from entering Site-400's third-floor men's restroom. Any individuals possessing relevant information regarding SCP-6876 are encouraged to report it to the current research head (presently Dr. Derik Gusmann of the Department of Spectral Phenomena).\n----\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=bathroom.jpg|\n    caption=Site-400's third-floor men's restroom. |\n    width=250px|\n    align=right|\n]]\n \n**Description:** SCP-6876 is the designation given to a spectral phantasmic entity of an as-of-yet unknown Class[[footnote]]Spectral entities are sorted through five different Classes, each corresponding to their corporeality and ability to \"interfere\" with the plane of the living.[[/footnote]], currently believed to be inhabiting (or \"haunting\") the third-floor men's restroom in Site-400. During the time of its brief manifestation, SCP-6876 was seen wearing a Foundation-issued //Janitorial and Maintenance// uniform, with its mouth obscured by a blue surgical-type face mask.\n\nSCP-6876 momentarily appeared on the 5th of May, 2018, and was seen vocalizing for a few seconds in the presence of Dr. Nigel Henderson, before demanifesting. The following is a transcript of the event, initially recovered from a surveillance camera implemented in the bathroom:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n//Footage shows the view of the restroom in its entirety, with the stalls, urinals, and washing sinks visible. The sound of a toilet flushing is heard, and Dr. Henderson exits one of the stalls and proceeds to throw a clump of tissue paper in a nearby wastebasket.//\n\n//He lifts both of his hands to his nose and sniffs his fingers, before shrugging and attempting to exit the bathroom. At this point, SCP-6876 manifests directly in front of Dr. Henderson, holding a wet mop and a metal bucket.//\n\n**SCP-6876:** Bro, what are you doing? That's disgusting.\n\n**Dr. Henderson:** (//looks up//) What the-?\n\n**SCP-6876:** You're a doctor, for god's sake. Go wash your hands!\n\n//SCP-6876 proceeds to demanifests. Dr. Henderson looks around his surroundings and briefly glances at a nearby sink. He shrugs once again and exits the bathroom, his hands still unwashed.//\n\n= **<End Log>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nDr. Henderson reported the above incident to on-site security, and an official investigation was conducted, resulting in the recovery of the video camera. After reviewing the footage, personnel has concluded that SCP-6876 was, in nature, a spectral entity. As such, the Department of Spectral Phenomena has been assigned to properly research SCP-6876.\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"card-block\"]]\n= **ON-FILE COMMENTARY**\n\n> I would like to request the removal of the video transcript, if possible. I suggest using a \"timeline-of-events\" type thing, specifically with my name redacted or expunged. I think we can all agree that I've learned my lesson on bathroom etiquette. - //Dr. Nigel Henderson//\n\n> Request denied.
