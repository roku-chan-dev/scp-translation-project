My progress will be documented here, on my author page.\n\nWow remember when I made that goal? I sure do. And what a ride it's been since then! Anyway, this series is getting a massive overhaul so. Prepare for things to change!\n\nWow remember when I last edited this in like June 2020? I sure do! Anyway I'm almost 23 now! Wow! But this goal of mine has yet to change or completely die! SO guess what? I'll be re-writing this series! Adding more content! Yahoo! Expect complete insanity soon!\n\nWow remember the last edit to this page? I'm now 25, turning 26 in September, and SCP still holds a special place in my heart. One day, I'll come back to the tale of Eli and Dictator, especially now that I'm a better writer.\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-a-mission-introduction Introduction]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-part-1-scp-2339 Part 1]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-part-2-bright-eyes Part 2]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-part-3-beltane Part 3]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-part-4-friends Part 4]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/every-scp-part-5-the-clock Part 5]\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/the-talk Part 6]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
