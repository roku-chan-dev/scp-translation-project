(i have not actually successfully written any of the latter yet)\n\nso far i've only got the three articles:\n[[[SCP-4752]]]\n[[[SCP-6285]]]\n[[[SCP-6179]]]\n\nbut we're working on expanding that, slowly. the wiki isn't my focus really but i enjoy the space it provides for unique takes on fiction and art, and the community here means a lot to me, so im trying to be around from time to time.\n\nyou can find some examples of my photography and the projects im working on on my website lucaquinn.com or my instagram @o_cuin.\n\notherwise there's not much to say. i dont go online much anymore so i am difficult to contact at the best of times, i like nice coffees and wines, i like trains and public transport. i like a good pint of guinness but i try not to drink too much anymore. i play the guitar, my granda taught me and ive been playing for the last 15 years. as you can tell i'm not too concerned about my public persona and my scp persona being separate. if you find something bad you can do with any of this information i congratulate you.\n\nthat's about it.\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"OCuin\" order=\"created_at\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Page Name ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Last Edited ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]",
