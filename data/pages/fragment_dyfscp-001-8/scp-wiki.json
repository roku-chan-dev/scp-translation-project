  "content": "**Item:** SCP-001-A\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001-A is to be kept under constant surveillance at Soundproofed Warehouse 10 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Personnel conducting routine maintenance checks must use level --3B-- --5A-- --7A-- 26M ear protection at all times.\n\n**Description:** SCP-001-A is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 m shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.\n\nSave for the presence of SCP-001-A-1, it is identical in appearance and, presumably, function to SCP-001. However, the fact that the bulkhead has been permanently closed from within makes usage as a backup for SCP-001 non-viable.\n\nSCP-001-A-1 is a flat metallic device, 2.1 m in height and 0.9 m in width. The text \"SCP-FNA\"[[footnote]] Does not reference any known SCP designation. [[/footnote]] has been painted on the surface. Through unknown means, it has been permanently affixed to the right wall of SCP-001-A's \"cockpit.\" Whether or not SCP-001-A-1 has \"phased into\" the wall is unknown.\n\nSCP-001-A-2 denotes 57 (so far) identical humanoid entities of indeterminate gender, intelligence, and identity. Tissue samples taken from SCP-001-A-2 display both human and bovine DNA.\n\nSCP-001-A-3 denotes a pocket-dimensional space accessible through SCP-001-A-1. Following Incident-001-A-0, it is inaccessible.\n\n**Addendum 1 -- Incident-001-A-0:** On 9/1/22 at 1050 GMT, the bulkhead to SCP-001-A suddenly closed from within. Concurrently, all contained instances of SCP-001-A-2 died instantaneously through unknown means.\n\nFive minutes later, SCP-001-A began emitting a constant piercing noise from within. Though SCP-001-A's exterior has muffled the sound considerably, the noise has maintained a consistent volume of ███ dB.\n\nThe sound vaguely resembles an old man screaming.\n\n**Addendum 2 -- Inactivity:** On 10/13/25, the noise stopped for 17 minutes and five seconds...\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #23a307; background:#000000; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]]]\n{{##4cff24|BOOT SEQUENCE INITIATED - BACKAWAY BIOS (c) 1996 PROMETHEUS LABS##}}\n\n{{##4cff24|WELCOME, [USER].##}}\n\n{{##4cff24|THE CURRENT DATE IS OCTOBER 13TH, 2025 CE.##}}\n\n{{##ff0090|!! <3 HAPPY COLUMBUS DAY <3 !!##}}\n\n{{##4cff24|WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO TODAY?##}}\n\n{{##4cff24|>RUN_WORDPROCESS##}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> {{**item #:** scp-ubu}}\n> \n> {{**object class:** iscariot}}\n> \n> {{**special containment procedures:** though strong evidence points to the conclusion that i have failed in the task i set out to do just under ten million years ago, there is a chance that }}\n> \n> {{i mean}}\n> \n> {{all things considered, there}}\n> \n> {{i}}\n> \n> {{the plan is to keep yelling and in doing so a higher power will one day take pity on me and bring back an scp-ubu-2 that isnt allergic to fucking twigs and im going to be the one who gets to kill and punish ubu}}\n> \n> {{maybe not pity though}}\n> \n> {{that would mean i havent earned it}}\n> \n> {{ok new plan}}\n> \n> {{the strength of my willpower via several aeons of screaming will manifest the aforementioned scp-ubu-2 into existence like that one book \"the secret\" or whatever}}\n> \n> {{then thatll be a good day}}\n> \n> {{i will win}}\n> \n> {{i wont have to scream anymore}}\n> \n> {{...}}\n> \n> {{looking back i suppose its only natural}}\n> \n> {{this ubuless world holds no joy for me}}\n> \n> {{struggle without killing torture without satisfaction conflict without resolution}}\n> \n> {{hatred without an outlet}}\n> \n> {{no one left to direct it toward but myself}}\n> \n> {{...}}\n> \n> {{my laboratory is cold}}\n> \n> {{somebody please put a blanket over me}}\n> \n> {{...}}\n> \n> {{i could use a distraction}}\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #23a307; background:#000000; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]]]\n\n{{##4cff24|> SAVE##}}\n\n{{##4cff24|UNTITLED1.TXT SAVED.##}}\n\n{{##ff0090|HEY, [USER].
