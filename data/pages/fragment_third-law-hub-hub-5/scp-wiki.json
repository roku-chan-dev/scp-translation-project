This era is dominated by the Paranormal Renaissance, with the scientific method being applied against the mystical for the first time. Parahuman populations expand and anomalous phenomena proliferate, adding further fuel to the fires of the new parasciences. This period ends abruptly and violently with the outbreak of the Seventh Occult War.\n\n* **[[[NTE-2858-Cyan-Blaecca]]]** -- The GOC fights to take control of \"Other London\", a Victorian-era asteroid colony populated by anarcho-syndicalists. //Written by Tsercele//\n* **[[[the-assassination-of-xyank|The Assassination of Thaddeus Xyank by the Coward Thaddeus Xyank]]]** -- The past kills the future to save the present. //Written by GreenWolf//\n* **[[[preliminary-report |Preliminary Report of J. C.

Both create a demand for new and better paratech, leading to a parascience bubble that will last for half-a-century.

An anomalous black market begins to emerge as old Soviet paratech stocks are lost and looted. The decline and eventual dissolution of Prometheus Labs in 1998 only serves to further destabilize the already reeling paranormal economy. Without the Cold War to justify their budgets, national paranormal agencies are downsized just as new mass communications technologies emerge, putting the integrity of the Veil in question for the first time in decades.
