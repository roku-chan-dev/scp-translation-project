Personnel conducting testing on SCP-6322 must do so inside a specialized chamber rated at Sound Transmission Class 50 or higher, and are required to wear protective active noise canceling equipment and to cover skin when handling the object, even in its inactive state. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6322 is a sphere of unidentified gemstone measuring 10cm in diameter. When SCP-6322 comes into contact with human skin for longer than 3 minutes, the object emits a 115 decibel ringing sound. Organic creatures in a .5km radius of the object who hear this sound without protective equipment experience rapid lung consolidation [[footnote]] Water vapor condensing within the lungs, leading to drowning in extreme cases [[/footnote]] and die after 1-5 minutes. \n\n[[>]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[1] unread message\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n \n> ##blue|And that's it.

Foundation operatives successfully rerouted the package containing SCP-6322 to Sloth’s Pit, Wisconsin, where it was to be recovered by Unit 87 of Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (“Pony Express”) and returned to Dr. Franklin Hays, head of the SCP-6322 project. Captain Daniel Byrne of Mobile Task Force Delta-5 (\"Front Runners\") was sent to oversee transport of SCP-6322 back to Site-19. Unit 87 was chosen as the first point of contact due to Site-87 being the largest and closest Foundation site, as well as the Sloth's Pit postal warehouse being specially equipped for similar scenarios.\n\n**Attached Documents**\n------\n[[>]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Text messages between Captain Byrne and Delta-5 Agent Tim Miranda\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n> \n> ##blue|Kill me.##\n> \n> ##red|ok##\n> \n> ##blue|Miranda, you would not believe these people##\n> \n> ##red|are you at 87##\n> \n> ##blue|I'm at 87 babysitting Alpha-4##\n> \n> ##red|why##\n> \n> ##blue|Big MCD thing coming in.
