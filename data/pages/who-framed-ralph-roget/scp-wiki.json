Every page demanded a separate signature. Every page had a different date format. There were changes to initial. There were blank spaces to fill with detailed responses. There were even — he took a deep breath — fields for mathematical calculations.\n\n//The paperwork is an anomaly. It has to be.//\n\nWithout so much as a knock of warning, the door to his grandmother's office swung open. That didn't seem appropriate. \"Site Director,\" he whined.

The paperwork was just a distraction while I got things in order.\" \n\nRoget had never seen the old hound look so satisfied. \"I take it you're not talking about tea time,\" he ventured.\n\nAnderson shook his head. \"You and your Grandma have reached the end of tea times, Ralphie.\"\n\nTwo uniformed agents appeared behind Anderson.

She also felt her boyfriend staring at her. He did that whenever he thought she wasn't looking; she knew this because his reactions were almost comically slow, the product of eighteen years of being screamed at by a mirror-mounted stalker. He never could look away quickly enough.\n\n//Boyfriend? We've been inseparable for months, we're practically...//\n\nShe straightened, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5056 Philip Deering] looked down at the PDA in his lap so quickly she could almost hear his tendons contracting. //Gotcha.// He'd been sitting on the floor, looking over low-clearance SCP files, checking SCiPNET, and pseudo-covertly checking her out for the past half-hour. At some point he was going to get used to their relationship. The puppy love stage couldn't last forever... could it?\n\nShe was surprised he could still hear his hormones over the anxiety he had to be feeling, much less the monologue he was almost certainly hearing. The security detail they'd met at the airstrip had dumped them in this unfurnished containment cell, and told them to wait; Amelia found it hard not to focus on that.\n\n\"What're you reading about now?\" she asked. \"Bug warriors? Cognitohazardous stop signs?\" She walked behind him and looked down. She couldn't make out the text on the PDA, because most of the screen was occupied by a scowling grey figure with slits for eyes and a mouth; its mouth was moving, but she couldn't hear it. Nobody but Phil ever could.\n\nPhil sighed. \"I'm not reading anything, because //Doug.//\" He shook out his wristwatch, as if silently suggesting it as a better manifestation point for the reflection monster.\n\nIf Doug took the hint, he did nothing with it.\n\nAmelia knelt down and reached over Phil's shoulders, pinching the screen to zoom in and out, trying to catch a few words over Doug's own shoulders. Phil nuzzled her with his stubble, and she barely suppressed a grin. She failed to suppress a gasp when she realized what she was looking at. \"Alpha-9?! Since when do you have clearance to know about Alpha-9?! I'm your boss, and I've only heard rumours!\"\n\n\"I //don't// know about Alpha-9. I just got this email from SCiPNET.\" He squinted, as though that would help him read the file past Doug's ephemeral bulk. \"Is it that MTF full of anomalies everybody pretends is some big secret, but they're way too mad to shut up about it?\"\n\n\"Don't keep reading!\" She walked back in front of him and kicked the sole of his right boot. \"Whatever that is, someone sent it to you by mistake.\"\n\nThe cell door swung open, and a moustachioed man in a security uniform walked in. \"They sent //you// by mistake, too. I'm sorry to have wasted your time.\"\n\n\"You should be sorry for listening through the door,\" Phil muttered.\n\nThe other man ignored him. \"Theodore Anderson.\" He stuck out a calloused hand, and Amelia took it. \"Assistant Director of Security. You'll be surrendering 5109 to me, right now.\"\n\n\"On whose authority?\" Amelia demanded. \"My instructions are to meet with Director Roget.\"\n\n\"//Interim// Director Roget,\" Anderson snapped. \"Who's under lock and key, suspicion of treason. Whatever he wanted you to do with that password is irrelevant now. Hand it over, and we'll ship you back to your sewer.\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"I'm here as an agent of ETTRA. You have no authority over objects in my custody.\"\n\nHe smiled grimly. \"Objects in your custody?\" He glanced down at Phil, still crosslegged on the floor. \"Like those two? 77 has jurisdiction over everything anomalous in Italy. I could include your grandpa in that.\"\n\n\"I'm not her grandpa,\" Phil growled. \"I'm her... boyfriend.\"\n\nHer cheeks flushed. She felt the inexplicable urge to stand between Phil and Anderson.  \"You're threatening us? That's how you want to play this?\"\n\n\"I'm not playing, Miss Toros--\"\n\n\"//Chief// Torosyan,\" Phil interjected.\n\n\"CHIEF Torosyan. I'm deadly serious. Give the password up willingly, or give it up under duress. If I suspect you're in league with our former interim Director, well. My discretionary powers are quite broad.\"\n\nAmelia huffed.

That, and favouritism, got you far. //This// far. But no farther.\"\n\nRoget narrowed his eyes. \"You're in a giving mood today.

Certainly not warmly.// \"I've locked up plenty of traitors in my time, kid, but it usually hurts to see them go. It's always the bright, promising ones who fuck up. But not today! Today's more of a two birds, one stone kind of thing.\"\n\nRoget shook his head. \"You sundowning, Teddy?\"\n\nAnderson laughed; Roget hadn't heard that sound since he was a child. \"Old age on your mind? Worried about Grandma Gilly? I guess that explains your deal with The Factory.\"\n\nRoget blinked. \"What factory? THE Factory?\"\n\n\"Cut the act. The Director's getting on in years, and it's been hard on you. People have done worse things for their loved ones than selling anomalies. What did they promise you for the password? The fountain of youth? The cure to all diseases?\" Anderson tutted. \"Stupid kid. Should've let her live out her life on her own terms.\" The older man grasped the bars and rattled them, effortlessly. \"Now her grandson's in the brig, and after the internal investigation she'll probably never get her precious Site back. Just wait'll they see what she's been up to in the basement!\"\n\nRoget's stomach was in free-fall. \"Who's the Director right now, Teddy?\"\n\nAnderson's smile grew, but never reached his eyes. \"I am.

There were four of them in the golf cart, an MTF agent making up the difference. Two more carts followed, a convoy wending its way towards Mount Salviano.\n\n\"What do they think Dr. Roget did?\" Amelia asked.\n\n\"Something stupid,\" Gillespie answered. \"Which is on-brand, but he's innocent.\"\n\n\"So, we're here to clear his name?\"\n\n\"No, not directly. We're here to unravel a conspiracy, and possibly kill an underground monster.\" Gillespie took another, more reluctant sip. \"The conspiracy's a definite, the monster's only likely.\"\n\nAmelia frowned. \"You're bringing janitors to a monster fight?\"\n\nGillespie grimaced at her coffee. \"I make do with what I have. Alpha-9 is busy, but you two have your uses.

I'm being drafted by Alpha-9. Oh, god, I'm gonna die.\" He said this very calmly.\n\nGillespie peered at the desaturated slit monster with an anatomist's interest. \"Only you can hear it,\" she murmured. \"And it follows you around, reflection to reflection, never looking at anyone else. That kind of loyalty is hard to find.\"\n\nAmelia put an arm around Phil's shoulders as they approached a massive cleft in the mountain.\n\n\"I mean, Doug also curses me out twenty-four seven,\" said Phil. \"But what're you gonna do.\"\n\n\"Exploit it,\" said Gillespie, and she didn't say anything further.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image TF.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"...what am I looking at?\" Amelia half-whispered.\n\n\"A gateway to hell on Earth,\" Gillespie half-whispered back.

It was vast, sleek, shiny, gold-trimmed and jet black, in an ornate frame of ebony wood set deep into the interior cave wall. MTF agents were tracing lines and symbols on the surrounding rock with white chalk.\n\n\"We're going to hell today?\" Phil swallowed.\n\nGillespie glanced at the foreman, who nodded.\n\n\"He's nodding yes?\" Phil asked. \"Yes, we //are// going to hell today?\"\n\n\"Open it up,\" Gillespie ordered.\n\nThe foreman knelt down and linked two lines together with a single piece of chalk, and the designs flashed bright red. Then green. Then black.\n\n//I've never seen black flash before,// Amelia thought, and then the door slammed open.\n\nGillespie clapped. \"Bonus points for that.

The air was still, as if anticipating something. \"What've we found so far?\"\n\n\"Oh, the usual.\" Gillespie handed the clipboard back to the technician. \"Guns that fire human teeth. Flamethrowers that use your blood as napalm. We've only just begun to map the place, but we've already been set on by carnivorous bats and suicide bombers.\"\n\nAnderson looked back at her, concerned. \"Suicide bombers?\"\n\n\"They look like little kids. Until you see their eyes.\"\n\nHe shuddered, shutting off the flashlight. \"So, more Mussolini crap.\" The province of L'Aquila had been one big production plant for arms and materiel before the Second World War, when it became something much worse. The Germans and Italians had spent millions of marks and lira on occult experiments in remote villages, and caves just like this one.\n\n\"That's the working theory.\" Gillespie watched as the techs set up a series of fluorescent lamps, and the researchers began setting down rows of glassware on stainless steel tables. \"I can't wait to see what other goodies are down here.\"\n\n//Hello, Theodore.//\n\n\"What?\" Anderson walked over to Gillespie. \"What did you say?\"\n\n\"I didn't say anything.

Naming a thing gives you power over it.\"\n\nAmelia shook her head. \"That door was American. I've seen ones like it in old banks.\"\n\nGillespie clapped. \"Even better! Yes, it's American. We even know what Factory it came from.\"\n\nThey both heard the pause which signified the capital letter, but only Amelia understood what it meant. She shivered.\n\n\"Italy surrendered to the Allies in '43,\" Gillespie continued. \"A lot of people didn't want that to happen. And they had deep pockets.\"\n\nThe carts had passed into a massive cavern, the far walls and ceiling lost in the gloom. There were tool-marks on the floor, and an eerie stillness in the air.\n\n\"They enlisted the services an American robber baron and Satanist named James Anderson.\"\n\n\"Two Andersons,\" Phil remarked. \"Weird coincidence.\"\n\n\"I could name you another,\" Gillespie shrugged. \"And coincidences can be magical. Also magical, James Anderson. Whatever deals he made with the devil, they made him more than just a man. He could pluck the very worst ideas out of the minds of his employees, and make them real. When he was alive, his Factory made impossible tools of oppression and violence; when he died, they went international.\"\n\n\"Big in Germany,\" Phil muttered.\n\n\"Exactly. By the fifties we knew that Anderson could never really die; he wasn't human anymore, he was essentially a demon. The Factory had scattered parts of his body around the world, suffusing places like this with his essence, a hundred evil branch plants and dark literally-Satanic mills. We didn't realize that's what this place was when we discovered it; we knew when we found the second door.\"\n\nAmelia narrowed her eyes. \"The //second// door?\"\n\nGillespie nodded. \"The one we came in through just now. We're damn lucky it exists, because it's the only way we'll be able to sneak up on Anderson.\"\n\n\"Wait,\" said Phil. \"Which Anderson?\"\n\nGillespie ignored him. \"The other door, the //first// door, is under Site-77. We discovered it a few months ago, when we were expanding the Director's Complex. We've been containing, decommissioning, and experimenting on the things Anderson left there ever since.\"\n\nAmelia and Phil stared at her. She looked sheepish. \"Yes, in retrospect, //oops.// People in the lower levels started hearing voices, feeling compulsions. It's obvious now that Anderson was reaching out. Everyone working in the cave had a high mental resilience score, so I didn't think there'd be a problem. I underestimated his reach.\"\n\nThere was a light in the far, far distance.\n\n\"We didn't know what we were dealing with until we caught a Serpent's Hand thaumaturge skulking around Mount Salviano, making sure the protective wards on the door were solid; turns out they'd known about it for decades, and sealed it off. By the time we realized this was no Italian knockoff, but the honest-to-goodness Factory, I had pressing business with Alpha-9 so I ordered the whole thing shuttered. Too late.\" She crumpled her empty coffee cup, and threw it under her seat. \"The damage was already done. Lord, I hate coffee.\"\n\n\"You strike me as more of a tea drinker,\" said Amelia.\n\n\"I am.

The visible cavern floor was littered with arcane symbols and interconnected lines, all sketched out in white chalk, all glowing softly. The crazy lighting occasionally revealed shattered computer monitors, dim track lighting and overturned shipping containers scattered about. Theodore Anderson was hunched over beside the campfire, furiously scribbling on the stone. A rough circle of rotted viscera surrounded him.\n\nThe agents took positions around the circle, out of sight. Anderson suddenly straightened, and ten shots rang out in quick succession...\n\n...only to impact on an invisible barrier around the magic circle. Anderson laughed; it sounded like a cat vomiting. \"Shirley! You've brought friends!\"\n\nThere were screams from the darkness, all around. The agents did not reappear.\n\n\"What shall I make from them?\" Anderson walked out of the firelight, and they saw that his eyes were matte black; Phil and Amelia jockeyed for position, each attempting to shield the other.\n\n\"Ande—\" Gillespie began.

We've just passed the last minute. I'm about to get an upgrade, and //you're// about to get your jumped-up butler back. Briefly.\"\n\nAmelia stood up and embraced Phil, feeling his warmth again in the clammy cave.

Amelia couldn't make sense of the words, and she didn't want to. The fire went out. The groaning in the distance became a concentrated wall of bellowing, resolving into what sounded like a hundred roaring diesel engines. The cavern walls rumbled. A red mist drifted upward from the chalk designs.\n\nAmelia clutched Phil's arm, wiping her mouth with her free hand. \"Do it.\"\n\nPhil coughed, and raised his wristwatch to his face.\n\nThe mist became a rippling skein of white, veined flesh. From out of the darkness, row after row of dome-topped Italian tanks squealed into view, bedrock pouring off of them in waves. The squeal wasn't mechanical, it was the squeal of...\n\n//Don't listen to it.// She focused on Phil's breathing.\n\nThe grey face on the watch was moving its mouth-scar; Phil pressed his ear to it, nodding.\n\nRanks of men with bleeding eyes strode out of the gloom, carrying...\n\n//Don't look at it.// She focused on Phil's deep brown eyes.\n\nShe saw a look of recognition dawn, and she saw that the face on the watch had finished speaking. Phil tried to take in a breath, and his throat whistled with the effort. It broke her heart. He shook his head. He shook his head.\n\nShe pulled him to a kneeling position, and held him. \"Whisper it,\" she whispered, kissing him on the cheek. She pressed their foreheads together. \"Whisper it to me.\"\n\nAnderson crumpled to the ground, and the swirling mass of flesh around him congealed into a shimmering, translucent simulacrum of life.\n\nTHE BOSS IS BACK, it boomed in their skulls like a jackhammer on metal.
