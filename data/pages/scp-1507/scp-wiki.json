In the event that Foundation staff need to interact with SCP-1507, PoI-1507 is to accompany them into the chamber. Staff must be a minimum of 5 meters away of PoI-1507 when in the presence of SCP-1507.\n\nAny requests PoI-1507 has in relation to SCP-1507 are to be reviewed by the current research head. PoI-1507 is allowed to and encouraged to have daily interactions with SCP-1507.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1507 is the collective designation given to thirty plastic lawn flamingos of unknown make or manufacturer. Instances of SCP-1507 bear no notable behavioral differences from the average American Flamingo, save for an increase in territorial behavior and lack of vocalization. Said behavior often results in attacks targeted towards Foundation staff. The only individual known to circumvent their behaviors is PoI-1507, otherwise known as Leroy Day.\n\nHume level testing performed on PoI-1507 suggest reality bending abilities, though all conversations with him have come back as unclear of his awareness of his abilities.  \n\n**Addendum.1507.A:** Following are phone logs recovered from PoI-1507's phone following the acquisition of SCP-1507. Due to a lack of compliance and resources an interview was unable to be taken from PoI-1507.\n\n\n> = **01/03/2012 12:42 PM**\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]Mark you called?[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]oh[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]eh im sorry[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]im still not used to this yet[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]Hahaa you're fine![[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]I'm still getting used to it myself[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]It's just weird is all[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]yeah i don't doubt haha[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]idk how id react if i just stopped hearing one day[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]] Well just in case it happens let me tell you something[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]Keep around a pencil and paper or something to type[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]It's the only way folks will talk to ya :p[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]that sucks[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]You get used to it[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]i mean i guess?[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]still a bit lonely isn't it?[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]As I said before, You get used to it.[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]Now what were you calling about?[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]oh right[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]I'm coming over today[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]and im bring a sort of get well soon gift[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]oooo I'll be sure to keep an eye out for you[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> = **02/03/2012 03:12 PM**\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]] [[=image flam.jpg]] [[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]I think he likes this spot in my garden haha![[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]It overlooks the koi pond so he probably likes to watch the little guys[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]:)[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]im glad to hear that man[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]i just knew you said that you'd miss those old watching trips the most[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]so i tried to well[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"green\"]]bring it to you in anyway i could[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]Oh goddamn[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]You've got me crying, ah I really do appricate this man[[/span]]\n> @@ @@\n> @@ @@\n> [[span class=\"blue\"]]You're the first to come visit me after the getting out of the hospital so it really does mean a lot, even without the gift.

The calls were noted to have a male crying and uttering various unidentifiable phrases. Due to the nature of the call it was flagged for scanning and a Foundation agent was sent out to the call. When arriving on scene the agent reported PoI-1507 attempting to unsuccessfully resuscitate another man, who was later identified as Mark Farman, that had multiple stab wounds presumably caused by SCP-1507.\n\nPoI-1507, after being taken into Foundation custody, was amnesticized following an Ethics Committee Order.\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1506]]] | SCP-1507 | [[[SCP-1508]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
