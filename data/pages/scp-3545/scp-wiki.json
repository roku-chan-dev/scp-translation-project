The item should be secured with Level II Clearance and monitored while its effects are better understood. \n\n//Note: Concerns over the object's frailty have led to SCP-3545's containment locker being fit with a felt-lined indentation in which it is to be placed.//\n\n**Discovery:** After the events of {{[DATA PURGED PER O5 REQUEST]}}, the anomaly remained, and was subsequently brought onsite for analysis. Any further instances or related materials are presumed destroyed. It is unknown how said individual came to own SCP-3545, nor what else was taken at the time of the event.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass itself appears to be comprised of non-anomalous material. Thus, proper care must be taken when handling the item.\n\nSCP-3545 bears no identifying marks or artist etchings and exact dating has yielded inconsistent results.\n\nWhen an individual maintains direct eye contact with SCP-3545 and forms a mental image of the glass, it will begin filling with an unknown substance. The liquid that manifests within SCP-3545 absorbs all visible light and will appear completely black to the human eye. During this process, the contents of the glass are non-corporeal and cannot be accessed by any means. The substance will slowly replace any liquid already in the glass.\n\nSCP-3545 will fill completely within five minutes of sustained focus, but frequent breaks are recommended; the process has shown to have detrimental neurological consequences, with subsequent interactions having increased potential for adverse effects. All personnel assigned to the study of SCP-3545 are to leave the testing area before discussing findings to minimize unwanted exposure.\n\nWhen SCP-3545 is full, the liquid can be removed from the glass via ingestion by one individual. No other methods have proven capable of removing the contents of the glass, and attempts to retrieve consumed liquids have failed. Upon ingestion of the substance, subjects become instantaneously aware of a sequence of 18-24 numbers, and experience a range of sensory and local ontokinetic phenomena. The relevance of the learned numbers is currently not known, and testing is ongoing. \n\nA truncated list of previous test results can be found below:\n\n\n= __**EXPERIMENT LOG 3545-A**__\n\n||~ Designation ||~ Result ||~ Sequence ||\n|| D-8121 || Subject filled and consumed contents successfully.

Upon consuming the contents of SCP-3545, the subject will instantaneously become aware of a sequence of 18-24 numbers. Through extensive testing, it has been deduced that the numbers are two sets of four-vector coordinates that refer to specific points in four-dimensional spacetime,[[footnote]]Three spatial dimensions, one temporal.[[/footnote]] relative to the location and time of ingestion. These points mark the outer boundaries in which an anomaly, designated SCP-3545-1, will occur within our own reality. \n[[f<image figa.png]] \nSCP-3545-1 instances appear as non-anomalous space, referred to by an accessible orthotope as it moves through our reality for a set period of time. Despite this, instances are octahedral in nature (Schläfli symbol {4,3,3}) when viewed from higher dimensions (See **Figure A**).\n[[f>image figb.png]]\nUpon the manifestation of SCP-3545-1, individuals who travel through the boundaries and out the opposite side of the intercepting orthotope will find themselves transported to an alternate location (See **Figure B**).\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\nFrom an outside perspective, the individual traversing an instance of SCP-3545-1 will not appear to leave or deviate from their path, and will reach and exit the other side of the anomaly as expected. Upon exiting the area of effect, individuals retain a nascent awareness of their experiences, but due to a mild antimemetic effect, often do not remember having left any location, nor their return. The experience has been described as \"dream-like\".\n\nMnestic drugs have no effect on individuals affected by SCP-3545-1 instances. Detection of both chronons and antichronons, measured in burst patterns during manifestation and interaction, have led to the conclusion that this memory-alteration may occur due to retroactive changes in causality. This is supported by observation; individuals sent into the area and told to return experience no changes, but those with //intent// and //capacity// to successfully exit the opposite side experience the event at some point during their time within the anomaly. Therefore, those within SCP-3545-1's boundaries experience their dislocation before the requirements to trigger said dislocation are met. Because of this, all affected subjects must properly exit the instance upon conclusion of the test in order to eliminate any potential for ontological contradiction.\n\nAlthough the effect of SCP-3545-1 is not visible to outside observers, and despite the significant memory loss of test subjects exposed to these regions, video and audio recording still function with variable success, subject to the specific reality entered into.

Individuals possessed intimate knowledge of the layout of the facility, gaining access to SCP-3545's research and containment chambers. At the time, several staff members and a handful Class-D personnel were present and collecting sequences from SCP-3545. The following is a transcript of video surveillance footage taken from the chamber.\n> @@ @@\n> ----\n> @@ @@ \n> **08:15** - A blast is seen shaking the containment area. Security doors to the left appeared to have buckled. Staff attempt to evacuate but find other set of doors sealed due to automatic emergency protocols.\n> \n> **08:18** - Several masked Chaos Insurgency members enter screen left. All possess modified Foundation tactical wear and standard issue Mobile Task Force gear. Individuals hold personnel at gunpoint and secure SCP-3545.\n> \n> **08:20** - A small scuffle ensues in an attempt to subdue attackers. D-8212 fatally wounded via gunshot.\n> \n> **08:25** - Insurgency members restrain all individuals. Personnel are moved to a circle around an examination table, where SCP-3545 is placed.\n> \n> **08:32** - Attackers appear to force individuals to fill SCP-3545. Once the glass fills, one Insurgent produces a number of flasks and a glass syringe that resembles SCP-3545's design. Using this syringe, liquid is then extracted from the glass with ease and is then deposited into one of the flasks. The process repeats. \n> \n> **08:42** - D-3244 loses consciousness and starts convulsing. D-7180 appears to be delirious and is seen frequently speaking to the empty space on his right. Dr. █████ is seen bleeding from the ears. Sr. Researcher Harkness is visibly frightened but unaffected, a fact that he later attributed to his high CRV.[[footnote]]Cognitive Resistance Value of 149, see [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sr-researcher-james-a-harkness-personnel-file his personnel file] for more information.[[/footnote]]\n>   \n> **08:48** - Insurgency member shoots D-7180 in the head. Another D-Class is seen with his head buried in his hands, but is soon harassed by aggressors until compliance. Harkness is escorted out of the containment chamber and into a nearby conference room, where he is interrogated (Audio transcript of active microphone can be found below). D-3244 stops convulsing and is considered lost.  \n> \n> **09:05** - D-6821, D-0312 and D-7110 all lose consciousness. Dr. █████ is still aware but bleeding heavily. D-6311 is pale, with deep circles under her eyes.\n> \n> **09:13** - Insurgency members harass D-6311 into continuing, causing her to sway and fall onto the table, which knocks over the glass. One Insurgency member lunges for the object, only to fall short as the glass smashes against the ground, leaking a liquid with the appearance of static. A large vibration is registered by everyone in the Facility. Foundation Security personnel take advantage of this event as a distraction, firing into the room, killing two and injuring Jr. Researcher Vasilev. Remaining members shoot and kill Vasilev, then proceed to attempt escape. Foundation assault proves capable of deterring assailants from obtaining remnants of SCP-3545, who return fire as one member primes a plastic explosive on the far wall. \n> \n> **09:22** - Insurgency associates detonate explosive and exit facility. Foundation pursuit ensues and is unsuccessful.\n> \n> **09:30** - Remaining members escape. Damage is assessed. Dr. █████ is recovered and placed in medical bay with severe neurological complications and ruptured eardrums. Harkness is found unconscious in the nearby conference room shortly thereafter.\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n> = __**Audio Log 3545-001**__\n> \n> //The following is an audio transcript of the interrogation of Sr. Researcher James A.

Individuals who have utilized SCP-3545 are to be supplied amnestics and monitored. Existing instances of SCP-3545-1 are to be cordoned off permanently using standard protocol most suited for the location. As of this moment, there are over 1,094 sites of interest that contain SCP-3545-1 instances. The location of SCP-3545 is currently known only to the O5 council.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3545 is the designation for the remains of an antique crystal drinking glass of unknown origin. The glass bears no identifying marks or artist etchings and is made of non-anomalous material. No attempts have been made to repair the glass; analysis has determined that several pieces were lost during the commotion which led to its destruction, and thus it is unlikely that repairing the item would restore its functionality, both as an anomalous item and a container for liquids.\n\nPreviously, when at least one individual maintained eye contact with SCP-3545 while concentrating on the object, it would fill with an intangible black liquid of unknown composition. Individuals filling the glass would express negative neurological impacts while doing so, the strength of which was compounded the longer individuals interacted with the item.\n\nAfter several minutes of sustained, targeted concentration, SCP-3545 would fill completely, contents then accessible to ingest or extract using SCP-3545-2, an unknown device resembling a glass syringe of similar design. What other (if any) items that could've been compatible with SCP-3545 are unclear and unlikely to be determined.\n\nUpon ingestion, subjects became instantaneously aware of two four-vector coordinates in spacetime. These coordinates refer to the location and initial manifestation time of a ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario, referred to as SCP-3545-1.\n\nAfter a random interval of time has passed, instances will disappear from our reality, only to reappear a variable time later. These manifestations will occur at more frequent intervals and for longer periods of time, until the fixture is considered permanent.\n\nDuring the SCP-3545-1 manifestation, any individual who passes through the boundaries and exits the other side will experience the ZK-Class Scenario as an immersive psychogenetic manifestation of their inner landscape. In this right, individuals inside SCP-3545-1 become temporary high-level reality benders, yet lack control over how the Event develops. The experience is described as \"dream-like\" and may or may not involve the memories of those affected. \n\nUnlike previously hypothesized, the occurrence is not hallucinogenic in nature, but a corporeal, alternate form of reality. Electroencephalography tests taken on affected individuals reveal absolutely no change from baseline, aside from natural reactions to what they experience. Measurements of the Hume field of these instances have yielded a result of zero in all cases, though this is likely false. The true hume level of SCP-3545-1 instances are hypothesized to be astronomically low, far more so than [[[scp-3001|already notable exceptions]]].\n\nSome speculation suggests this phenomenon is similar to [[[SCP-5541|observation-based]]] reality stabilizing fields recorded by the presence of Foundation operatives in a variety of classified operations.\n\nContainment and correction of SCP-3545-1 instances is considered a top priority. Experimental reality anchors/stabilizers are currently in development for use of correcting abnormal Hume fields in SCP-3545-1 instances. \n\n> {{Good luck with that. I've seen the tech, it's good stuff. If it were anything else, I would have higher hopes. It won't work though.
