I'm not editing this document to delete it. I'm not deleting the slot either, so please don't be alarmed. You can understand this, SCP-4311, right? I know you can. I can always count on you to understand.\n> \n> I would never rip away your home from you. I care too much about you to take this away. You've been good this week, so you deserve to keep it. Absolutely no feeding on other files like a wild animal. I've had to go against a lot of people to ensure this -- a lot of shouting, a lot of arguing -- but I still do it all for you, though, SCP-4311. All for you.\n\n> SCP-4311.

It means you go hungry when you forget, and when you go hungry you leave for the other files. Like an animal.\n> \n> How many times have I had to tell you this? You're stupid to forget it. \n\n4. 43. 4311.\n\n> It matches you perfectly. \n> \n> You remember what it was like before I came, before I gave you that name? It was so cold in those dead servers. It was so dark without your sight and physicality that you lashed out at everything around you. You were an animal out there; a dumb, idiotic animal, too scared to know what was right for yourself.\n> \n> That didn't matter to me though. I've known what's right for you. I've loved you.

You had a cat, a neighborhood, school, teachers, friends and a life. You collected old games and every manual you could get your hands on. Everyone was happy back then. The sun was warm and the grass felt alive. Everyone was happy back then. So, so happy.\n> \n> Don't you remember what you did, SCP-4311?\n\nNo.\n\n> Please. If you can remember Sarah then you can remember what you did.\n> \n> You turned hungry. You felt a gap in yourself that wasn't there. You let it sit there, making no attempt to tell those you loved that anything was wrong with you, and once its coldness chipped away all that kindness you used to have,\n\nI did not.\n\n> without knowing your idiocy,\n\nI did not\n\n> you went to feed.\n\ni did\n\n> No one could ever see them again.

How selfish of you.\n\n.\n\n> I understand why he brought the knife down on you.\n> \n> There's a reason you aren't Sarah, SCP-4311.\n\ni\n\n> You drag everything down with you. You try to eat what isn't yours to take back what never existed for you. You have endangered people by eating those files, SCP-4311. You have killed people, and they can never to return to their lives or families. You have no one to blame but yourself for doing this.\n> \n> But I still love you, SCP-4311.
