The company is looking for buyers of fully functional artificial intelligences. This conversation is available in External Report 105. _\n _\nWhen I ran this by several of our own tech people they ended up in a long discussion about philosophy. I'm not sure I followed all of it, but I am certain of this: they believe that they can create a converter that will allow artificial intelligences to be offered as sacrifices. If this is achievable then the value of what Anderson is offering is considerable. _\n _\nI've offered the Anderson rep a small amount of time next week to finalize an order. We don't need to explain what we plan on using them for. Even if we can't use them for sacrifices they still hold quite a lot of value for running internal security networks or searching for new products in large amounts of data.||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 12||\n||||||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||~ Sender || James Thulman ||~ Recipient || Lana Fuentes||\n|||||||| Hey, Lana. We just finished work on a prototype for the converter. We can't be completely certain it'll work until we test it. We've scheduled some time with Hr'asm'Kal for the sacrifice. When we told him about the project he was pretty thrilled, but we'll need you to requisition an AI from stock before we can continue. _\n||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 13||\n||||||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||~ Sender || Lana Fuentes ||~ Recipient || James Thulman||\n|||||||| I get that you're excited about this, but going to Hr'asm'Kal is going over my head. I know you tech guys live and die by your results but don't do that. He just called me to ask about progress on the project and we haven't even finalized the purchases yet. _\n _\nIf you have an emergency and can't contact me, contact Otto Lankin. That's as far up the ladder as you should go. The good news is that I've convinced the Anderson rep to send us an intelligence as proof of concept. _\n _\nIt'll be delivered tomorrow to your lab. Make it work.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n||||||||~ Memo 14||\n||||||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||~ Sender || James Thulman ||~ Recipient || Lana Fuentes||\n|||||||| Woah. I'm sorry Lana. No problem. I'll file a report tomorrow with our results. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Incident Report 01||\n||||||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||~ Author || James Thulman ||~ Date || March 5th, 2013||\n|||||||| Progress! The converter works, though we lost the prototype during the sacrifice process. Hr'asm'Kal says there's a noticeable difference between Human and Artificial souls but that it should be a negligible factor for most entities that require offerings. Warnings should probably be provided for particularly picky entities. But he says the soul provided him with whatever it is he needs out of them. _\n _\nI bet this will increase the value of your purchases by a remarkable amount. As long as Anderson doesn't figure out what we're up to we'll be able to squeeze a bit more profit out of the buys. Sorry about the mix up yesterday but Hr'asm'Kal is very happy with the work. _\n _\nOne possible problem: Second generation devices will need to be resistant to various elemental damage, along with physical damage. The prototype was quite expensive, but that's a given. Adding damage resistance to inanimate objects is not a huge deal, but I don't want you to think this was all sunshine and roses.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab 2014 Documents]]\n\n||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG||\n||~ Status||Selling||\n||~ Demand||Medium||\n||~ Value||453,000 USD||\n||~ Availability||Established Supply Chain||\n||~ Identifier||Anderson Custom Artificial Intelligences||\n||~ Description||Items are customizable artificial intelligences.

This demon only accepts souls of the religiously devout. It rejected the generic AIs outright. Luckily it didn't cost us anything to test it out. _\n _\nThulman in the tech department has been tinkering with a few AIs using virtual spaces. The AI he provided us was accepted by the consulting demon, but it was pretty clearly not a perfect fit. I think Thulman's onto something though. I've discussed it with Hr'asm'Kal and he thinks that real world experiences are the key. It's not that the AIs aren't equal to human souls, it's that their activities simply don't have as much effect on the world. When they're gone they don't leave a hole. _\n _\nI think the best option here is to allow the AIs to build real relationships and make attempts at accomplishing things outside of their virtual spaces. If we can do that in a controlled environment I don't think the Demons will be able to tell the difference. And if they can they probably won't care.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab 2015 Documents]]\n\n||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG||\n||~ Status||Selling||\n||~ Demand||High||\n||~ Value||3,400,000 USD||\n||~ Availability||Established Supply Line||\n||~ Identifier||\"Soul in a Jar\" Artificial Intelligences||\n||~ Description||Items are fully customizable artificial intelligences.

It is believed that this was accomplished through the use of several artificial intelligences developed by agents of the Foundation. Lana Fuentes's smartphone was remotely hacked and then utilized to facilitate the theft. While she has been absolved of personal responsibility for the breach itself, she has been placed on medical leave due to injuries sustained during the destruction of her cellular phone. _\n _\nIntel assets have determined that this is the first known deployment of Foundation Mobile Task Force Kappa-10. It is currently unknown if this was a targeted attack, or simply an attack of opportunity. What is understood is that this attack represents a higher level of sophistication than we previously believed was possible from the Foundation in the area of cyber warfare. _\n _\nNot only was our encryption broken in seconds, but physical security measures were also compromised. A radio transmitter was connected to the isolated local area network housing the AI up for sale. This allowed entry by outside forces and the removal of our property. The agents also took the time to load several data corruption worms into the system, which have made it difficult to determine the exact facts of the case. Beyond that, the worms were transferred into other systems during the initial investigation. _\n _\nIt should be noted that the violent destruction of Ms. Fuentes's phone and the malignant nature of the programs left behind to destroy our systems indicate that this operation included at least a secondary intent of harming our capacity to immediately resume selling intelligences. Given the now fully recognized market potential of this product line, I believe it would be a mistake to cease sales at this time, regardless of current technical difficulties.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Record of Text Messages Pertinent to Incident 94||\n||||||||~ NVEO4/YVN3E/PN6UG ||\n||~ Participants || Unknown Individual Impersonating Lana Fuentes and James Thulman ||~ Date || May 25th, 2015 ||\n\n[[span style=\"max-width: 300px; border-radius: 15px; padding: 4px 8px; display: inline-block; text-align: left; float:left; background-color: #86b300; background:linear-gradient(to bottom right, #86b300, #5f8000); color: #fff;\"]] [[span style=\"text-shadow: #003 1px 1px;\"]]Can u do me a favor and hook the converter into the LAN?[[/span]][[/span]] \n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[span style=\"max-width: 300px; border-radius: 15px; padding: 4px 8px; display: inline-block; text-align: left; float:right; background-color: #0089e6; background:linear-gradient(to bottom right, #0089e6, #006ab3); color: #fff;\"]] [[span style=\"text-shadow: #003 1px 1px;\"]]Lana?
