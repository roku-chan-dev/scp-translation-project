A day that will live in history forever. We were deliberately attacked, without reason or warning by the Clear Skies Initiative, resulting in the barbarous murder of hundreds of Foundation employees in broad daylight. For decades, the Clear Skies Initiative has been an inconsequential thorn in our side, but this recent development has pushed us too far. \n\nAs a result of this bestial act of aggression against innocent human life, we will be taking every measure to ensure we are able to protect our future from this belligerent threat. We are in grave danger, Colonel Hollender, there is no doubt about that. I believe that I interpret the feelings of the entire Foundation when I take direct action to ensure that this form of antagonistic, mindless aggression will never happen again.\n\nAs of now, your task force will be stationed full-time in the Eurasian supercontinent where the Clear Skies Initiative have the strongest grasp.
