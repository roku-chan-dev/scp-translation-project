All further procedures have been folded into the duties of the Council.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** Nx-05 is a large forest located in upstate [REDACTED], nearby Site-01. It is one of the smallest Nexuses on record, being only 8.3 acres of land in total. The active population of the area consists only of 37 people, all of whom maintain residences outside of its actual boundaries in order to prevent interference. All individuals within these lodgings are high-ranking members of the Foundation’s administration, including a majority of the current Overseer Council. As such, Nx-05 is known as the only Nexus entirely populated by Foundation personnel.\n\nThe area exhibits mild, albeit consistent non-Euclidean activity. This most often manifests in the form of its various hiking paths temporarily being subject to anomalous activity such as going upward endlessly when travelled in a certain direction, but operating normally otherwise. Nx-05 is unique compared to other Nexuses in that no other anomalous phenomena naturally forms in its confines, with all anomalies resulting from it being entirely manmade.\n\nDespite its fairly unimpressive features, Nx-05 remains the only location known to the Foundation which can be accurately studied to provide information on how the anomalous as a whole operates; equations derived from this study have provided the basis for the entirety of the Foundation’s understanding of anomalies since the organization's inception. Nearly all breakthroughs within modern anomalous science began within Nx-05. As a result, the area can be credited with having been the basis for all modern anomalous paratechnology, including those made by several rival Groups of Interest due to leaked information or the reengineering of technology initially conceived through study of the area.\n\nBeing within the boundaries of Nx-05 produces a mild compulsory effect to study the area and use the acquired knowledge to create new anomalies. Any subject who observes non-Euclidean activity within the area will feel compelled to understand how it functions, even if having never previously expressed a desire to do so. Due to this, most of Nx-05’s resulting anomalous activity is functionally indirect, though still originates in the Nexus itself and due to its effects.\n\n[[div style=\"border-top: 1px solid black; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n//[The wind howls as Fritz makes his way through the dark forest.

Upon this initial discovery, Siegel only discovered the area's non-Euclidean activity acting on one path, initially designated as [[[dr-manns-proposal|SCP-001-MANN]]]. Through study of SCP-001-MANN, Siegel and various other individuals who would eventually become high-ranking Foundation personnel closely studied the anomalous, believing the path itself to be the source of this ability to do so, unaware of the larger Nx-05. However, several years following this, the path's anomaly faded, as is the nature of Nx-05's activity. Nx-05’s true nature was subsequently recognized after the codifying of the Nexus classification system.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-manns-proposal/path005.png|caption=Portion of SCP-001-MANN.|width=300px]]\n\nThroughout 1944-1953, the central administrative body of the Foundation was positioned within Nx-05 in order to properly study it. Site-0, a small laboratory initially funded by Siegel, served as the primary meeting location of the Foundation administration at this time. Due to this, the leadership of the greater Foundation was far more informal than it is in the modern day. Much of this work was deferred to individuals such as Site Directors, granting facilities an amount of autonomy which would be considered unusual in modern times. In 1954, construction of Site-01 began, purposefully located close to Nx-05. Site-0 is still utilized, but Site-01 is considered Nx-05's assigned containment facility.\n\nUpon designation of the Nexus as Nx-05, the primary administrative body of the Foundation became known as the 05 Council, though later renamed as the O5 Council for obfuscation purposes to restrict knowledge of Nx-05. The public reason for this change was listed as the solidification of the “Overseer” position. As of 1956, Site-01 and other secure facilities have begun to house several members of the Council to ensure all thirteen members are never in the same location, as was initially customary for study of Nx-05. Originally, the Council were the only individuals given the Level 5 clearance required to access Nx-05, though Level 6 clearance was later codified as the level exclusive to Council members, with Level 5 now given to a select few individuals within the larger Foundation administration.\n\nSince 1945, all orientations for individuals being granted Level 5 clearance take place within Nx-05. Standard practice is for these personnel to be given enough information with which they can create a low-level anomalous item, many of which have been catalogued in various [[[log-of-anomalous-items|logs]]].\n\nIn 1947, the Embla Protocol was first set in motion (//See Section 05.2//).\n\nDuring 1954, the Foundation underwent a brief conflict with the Global Occult Coalition after one of their most highly-skilled agents was sent to [[[djkaktus-s-proposal-iii|gather data]]] on the O5 Council. Investigation efforts revealed they were unable to glean more than the information on the following file in regards to Nx-05, even believing a single one of the paths to be the only anomaly present.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum goc\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Path_in_Walthamstow_Forest_-_geograph.org.uk_-_5438857.jpg?20230918171923|caption=UTE-0001-Kewpie.|width=280px]]\n\n**Threat ID:** UTE-0001-Kewpie\n\n**Response Level:** N/A\n\n**Description:** UTE-0001-Kewpie is a straight gravel path within a forest in northern [REDACTED]. Upon traveling forwards, the path goes on continuously, with a subject being brought back to the beginning of the trail should they reach the end. Upon a subject travelling the opposite direction, UTE-0001-Kewpie operates regularly.\n\nNotably, UTE-0001-Kewpie has received extensive, seemingly-excessive, containment and security efforts from its current supervisor: The SCP Foundation.\n\n**Engagement Rules:** Liquidation of UTE-0001-Kewpie is unfeasbile at the time of writing due to the various security measures established by the Foundation, though would normally be restricted regardless due to existing diplomatic relations with the organization.\n\nEfforts are ongoing to determine the nature of the threat due to the unusual amount of protection it is receiving.\n\nThe Foundation is not to be made aware that the Coalition possesses any information about UTE-0001-Kewpie; the active investigation regarding the threat may jeopardize any diplomatic proceedings.\n\nFor further information, please consult the [# attached files].\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter a diplomatic discussion between O5-4 and the Undersecretary General of the Coalition, she agreed to end all further efforts to gather information on the Overseers.

While study of the area was initially only used to create beneficial paratechnology or simply study various facets of the anomalous, the protocol was for the purposeful development of various hostile anomalies to be later recontained by the Foundation in public spectacles. After the [[[scp-001-wikipedia|fall of the Veil]]], such events would both sponsor support among the general population and governments.\n\nThe remainder of the Overseer Council voted almost unanimously to approve Mann's proposal, with the sole exception being Aaron Siegel, who was still O5-1 at the time. Siegel was eventually convinced with the stipulation that all of these anomalies would be easily recontainable by the Foundation and only appear dangerous to outside observers. Site-0B, a former storage facility for Site-0, was converted into an advanced subterranean Foundation installation for the covert development of anomalies part of the Embla Protocol. Such anomalies would have falsified documentation personally approved by the Overseer Council to shroud their true natures from the greater Foundation.\n\nWhile the first several anomalies developed through the Embla Protocol operated effectively, unforseen consequences throughout the world stage followed:\n\n* Funding granted to the Foundation by world governments did increase, but the events also resulted in many more localized anomalous organizations directly under government control, such as the United States' [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/pentagram#pages PENTAGRAM]. However, the Department of Analytics has confirmed the competition created by these new organizations was far outweighed by the funding increase.\n\n* Support for the Foundation and other organizations such as the Global Occult Coalition among the general population increased as expected, but tensions and fear towards the anomalous also increased astronomically. A collaborative audit by the Department of Public Relations and Department of Groups of Interest deemed this to have been relatively acceptable.\n\n* Various terrorist organizations began more substantial attempts at weaponizing anomalous phenomena. This, in turn, bolstered more fear among world populations and governments, serving to unintentionally assist the Foundation's efforts.\n\nIn 1948, without Siegel's knowledge, the remainder of the Council began colluding to unleash dangerous anomalies through the Embla Protocol. Enraged, Siegel defected from the organization alongside a large group of personnel who would later become the primary faction of GoI-003 (\"The Chaos Insurgency\").\n\n[[div style=\"border-top: 1px solid black; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n**AARON:** I couldn't just stand by anymore, Fritz.
