This object was an incomplete interstellar scientific research vessel designed for Project Daedalus, an internal and clandestine human spaceflight program undertaken by Prometheus Laboratories.\n\nConstruction of the vessel began in 1996, but technical complications, coupled with the financial difficulties of Prometheus Labs, caused the project to be abandoned in 1997; by this point, most work on the superstructure and external hull had been completed, but no internal systems had been installed. The breakup of the Prometheus conglomerate in 1998 resulted in the evacuation of the research facility at Herculina, and the unfinished hulk became derelict.\n\nMost data and documents from Project Daedalus were eventually obtained by the Foundation, as part of the larger acquisition of former Prometheus assets during the breakup of the conglomerate.[[footnote]]Further information is available under the codewords {{CERULEAN FISSURE}} (pertaining to the breakup of Prometheus Labs and proximate events) and {{EMERALD LUPUS}} (encompassing Foundation operations to monitor and acquire former Prometheus assets).[[/footnote]]\n\nPursuant to {{TAROT MARTEL}}, the vessel was selected for use by the **{{DAMOCLES INITIATIVE}}** and designated as SCP-6523. In cooperation with the GOC, a containment and salvage operation was launched to take control of the vessel and retrofit it into the //Joyeuse//.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #999999; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto;\"]]\n\n+++ @@     @@**Design**\n\nThe original starship design of Project Daedalus centered on the Darius-Semiz singularity drive: an advanced photonic thruster which harnesses the Hawking radiation[[footnote]]A non-anomalous phenomenon, whereby black holes decay through the emission of black body radiation with a temperature inversely proportional to their mass.[[/footnote]] produced by a decaying micro black hole. The [[[grant-request-for-the-construction-of-an-interstellar-scienc|initial proposal]]] for Project Daedalus suggested an average continuous acceleration of 1//g// would be possible with a black hole massing 675,000 metric tons, although these figures proved to be erroneous or excessively optimistic.\n\nPrometheus engineers ultimately concluded that a much more massive black hole, with correspondingly longer lifespan and lower power output, would be required, resulting in significantly reduced acceleration and increased transit time; project managers believed that they could circumvent the problems of ultra-long duration voyages by keeping the crew in cryogenic stasis, but the necessary refinements in human cryostasis technology ultimately proved unfeasible.\n\nThe performance parameters selected by Project Daedalus were deemed insufficient for the **{{DAMOCLES INITIATIVE}}**, necessitating significant alternations to the original design -- critically, the //Joyeuse// needed to sustain a much higher constant acceleration. To achieve this, the Darius-Semiz drive uses a smaller black hole, with greater power output and shorter lifespan.\n\nTo prevent the black hole from decaying into non-existence, a remass system derived from [[[SCP-871]]][[footnote]]A collection of anomalous cakes that replicate exponentially unless eaten by a human.[[/footnote]] and [[[SCP-786]]][[footnote]]An anomalous funnel that can shrink or enlarge anything that passes through it.[[/footnote]] was constructed. This system feeds additional mass into the black hole to offset losses from Hawking radiation, thereby maintaining it at a constant size and power output.\n\nAdditional performance improvements were realized by placing many ship systems inside compact subspace dimensions, and through the use of thaumaturgy to reduce the effective mass of certain structural elements.\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 5px #999999; background:#e0d8de; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Ship Systems ◀\" hide=\"▼ Ship Systems ▼\" hideLocation=\"top\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nDetailed engineering schematics and precise design parameters of the //Joyeuse// are classified L5/DAMOCLES.

The original machinery used by Prometheus Labs to create the Schwarzschild black hole[[footnote]]A black hole with mass, but no electric charge or angular momentum.[[/footnote]] inside Herculina was inaccessible due to the exclusion zone covering the asteroid.[[footnote]]Following the breakup of the Prometheus conglomerate, the Herculina facility went into lockdown; automated defense systems make any attempts to approach the asteroid hazardous. To date, former Prometheus engineers have been unable to disable the lockdown remotely.[[/footnote]] Gormogon antimasons supervised the construction and operation of a single-use thaumo-nuclear laser array capable of generating a kugelblitz,[[footnote]]A black hole where the mass-energy density required to form an event horizon is provided through an intense concentration of energy, rather than gravitational collapse of a massive object.[[/footnote]] which was used to ignite the black hole upon launch of the //Joyeuse//. _\n@@ @@\n# **Darius-Semiz singularity drive** -- The containment and control system for the black hole. Magnetic confinement is provided by four superconducting blades, constructed from Mekonium[[footnote]]A metal-ceramic ultra-high-temperature superconductor developed by Prometheus Labs, and normally used in the construction of plasma projectors.[[/footnote]] further treated with thaumaturgy to withstand extreme temperatures. A parabolic reflector, made from an anomalously stable degenerate electron gas, reflects the gamma rays emitted by the black hole to produce thrust. The total thrust of this system is capable of continuously accelerating the //Joyeuse// at 1//g//. A series of thermocouples allow for the production of electrical power for the ship. _\n@@ @@\n# **Subsystem \"Antoinette\"** -- The [[[workshop-of-the-telescopes|confection-based black hole feed system]]], primarily derived from SCP-871. Cakes created by SCP-871 are automatically sorted by mass, then funneled through SCP-786 to reduce their size to subatomic scale; the shrunken cakes are then fed into the event horizon of the black hole, in a continuous stream averaging 4.8 kilograms per second. _\n@@ @@\n# **Relativistic impact shield** -- A shield mounted ahead of the //Joyeuse//, covering the entire front-facing cross-section, which protects the spacecraft from collisions with dust and gas in the interstellar medium.[[footnote]]At relativistic velocities, even single atoms of hydrogen have energies of multiple mega-electronvolts, and the leading edge of the spacecraft is subjected to conditions similar to the interior of a fusion reactor.[[/footnote]] The shield uses powerful magnetic fields generated by superconducting coils to slow or deflect charged particles, and incorporates a layer of liquid lithium to absorb impacts.[[footnote]]While decelerating, the rear of the spacecraft becomes the leading edge; when this happens, the electronium reflector of the Darius-Semiz drive doubles as the ship's impact shield.[[/footnote]] _\n@@ @@\n# **Forward laser array** -- A powerful short-wavelength laser mounted directly behind the impact shield; the central section of the shield can be temporarily retracted to allow the laser to fire through the shield.

It will decelerate for 2133 days of internal time, arriving at Alula Borealis 402 years after departure from Herculina.\n\nAll operations after arrival at Alula Borealis are left to the discretion of the Tripartite Control Council.\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the primary mission, the **{{DAMOCLES INITIATIVE}}** is encouraged to pursue the containment or neutralization of other astronomical anomalies.\n\nThere will be no return to Earth.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n= **<< [[[workshop-of-the-telescopes|Workshop of the Telescopes]]] || [[[damocles|HUB]]] || [[[Fire of Unknown Origin]]] >>**\n\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6522]]] | SCP-6523 | [[[SCP-6524]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP_Interstellar_logo3.png \n> **Authors:** [[*user GreenWolf]] and Pjmohedano\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 4.0\n> **Derivative of:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Colecci%C3%B3n_de_espadas_medievales.svg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n\n> **Filename:** GOC_Taskforce_Logo.png\n> **Authors:** [[*user Greyve]], [[*user GreenWolf]], Pjmohedano\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/theme:the-coalition-theme|GOC Theme]]]\n> **Derivative of:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Colecci%C3%B3n_de_espadas_medievales.svg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n\n> **Filename:** JoyeuseRenderCombo.png \n> **Author:** [[*user GreenWolf]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6523/JoyeuseRenderCombo.png|Link]]]\n\n> **Filename:** JoyeuseRenderColor.png \n> **Author:** [[*user GreenWolf]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6523/JoyeuseRenderCombo.png|Link]]]\n\n> **Filename:** 951_Gaspra.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain \n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:951_Gaspra.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n\n> **Filename:** Psi1_logo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user GreenWolf]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6523/Psi1_logo.png|Link]]]\n\n> **Filename:** QuintessenceLogo.png\n> **Author:** [[*user GreenWolf]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6523/QuintessenceLogo.png|Link]]]\n\n> **Filename:** JoyeuseFlight.gif\n> **Authors:** [[*user GreenWolf]], [[*user TyGently]], [[*user tawny0]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-6523/JoyeuseFlight.gif|Link]]]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
