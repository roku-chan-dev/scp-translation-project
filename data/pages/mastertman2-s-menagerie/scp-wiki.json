I'm [[*user MasterTman2]] (also known as MasterTman3 on some other platforms), and welcome to my author page! I enjoy writing stuff on this wiki a lot, and I especially enjoy writing about the more obscure parts of the wiki. (and also Kong, Shing, Gong. I really enjoy Kong, Shing, Gong. Most of my articles will likely be set in Kong, Shing, Gong.) I joined this site back in April of 2023 and since then it's been a place where I've made a lot of friends and I have people I get to share my weird obsessions with.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\n++++ [[[SCP-8280]]] - Slipping Through The Cracks\n++++++ Written for the [[[scp8000contesthub|SCP-8000 contest]]] and won 69th place\n//This phase is a truly marvelous place//\n* [[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/scp-8280|Chinese Translation]]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Show author commentary\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nSCP-8280!
