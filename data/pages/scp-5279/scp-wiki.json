SCP-5279-2 objects produced by SCP-5279-1 are to be destroyed via the use of an incinerator interconnected to SCP-5279-1 if they are deemed untranslatable, if they are translatable they will be transferred to the Foundation Lingual Department for deciphering. Websites are to be monitored for any mention of SCP-5279-2 like documents, which will be dealt with if necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5279-1 is a UX-300 Fax Machine that periodically prints pieces of paper (SCP-5279-2). The vast majority of SCP-5279-2 objects are blank, incomprehensible, or torn apart. However, a small percentage of objects are semi-comprehensible, written in a mix of early Anglo-Frisian and Anglo-Saxon[[footnote]]The writing system used in the SCP-5279 language is that of Anglo-Saxon runes[[/footnote]]. SCP-5279-1 is assumed to be from an alternate universe, due to the contents of SCP-5279-2 documents. No signal is sent to SCP-5279-1 before a document is printed. SCP-5279-1 is able to function without internet access, power, or parts essential to the function of a normal non-anomalous UX-300 Fax Machine.\n----\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Addendum-A-1]]\n\nSCP-5279-1 (along with 67 SCP-5279-2 documents) was discovered in an abandoned ████ product manufacturing facility in Hastings, the United Kingdom, on 11/16/2011. The facility in question is coincidentally located where a Anglo-Saxon era church was once located according to the ████████ tapestry. \n\nAs the facility was shut down on 05/09/2006, it can be presumed that SCP-5279 was left uncontained for over 5 years. SCP-5279 was brought to the Foundation’s attention when reports of SCP-5279 incidents began to appear on the Internet, gaining an almost mythlike status in the suburb of St Leonards among younger residents. Due to the large period in which SCP-5279 was uncontained, it can be assumed that copies of SCP-5279-2 may have been taken from the building. The following addendums include 4 of the most distinct SCP-5279-2 documents.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum-A-2]]\n\n* **Document Title:** N/A \n* **Anomalous:** No\n* **Description:** A partially written letter addressed to a ████ ███, who at the time, was the mayor of Hastings.

The events of the audio are not described, and only the conversation between the police officers remains. The events of this document have been transcribed by foundation personnel using the transcribed audio, misinterpretations are a distinct possibility.\n\n[[=]]\n= [[collapsible show=\"Text:\" hide=\"Text-\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nAudio of the White Oak Massacre\nNoise is from 10/09/2005\nWritten 10/10/2005\n\n(//Officers are assumed to be standing outside of a public well, they discuss their plan of entry before approaching the well, beginning their descent.//)\n\n[[==]]\n**__Descent__**\n**8:09-8:15 PM**\n(Descent begins with the men in high spirits.)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ It is time for justice brothers, this is for the people of Hastings. Remember your training and keep your heads held steady. (8:12)\n__//Marshal Stone://__ Yes sir. (Said in unison with Marshal Godwin, 8:12)\n__//Marshal Godwin://__ Yes sir. (8:12)\n\n(Men descend silently until 8:14, assumed to be around 3/4th of the way down the well.)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ We are nearing the nest mouth, section officer. There appears to be no water…notably, there are red stains upon the mouth walls, common in eye-snatcher nests. (8:14)\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ The throat of the nest has been spotted. It is of great size, around 1 elne in height, and 3 feet in width. Team commencing raid now. (8:15)\n\n**__Massacre__**\n**8:16-8:30PM**\n(Men enter the “throat” of the nest, assumed to be a hole in the walls of the well. They do not speak for over 4 minutes as they traverse the throat, either due to interference, or to not alert any “eye-snatchers”. Eventually the silence is broken by Marshal Fuller, shaken at the large amount of eyes they have come across.)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ By god. So many eyes. I cannot find an area where I am not watched by the stolen pearls. This is not normal section officer, we have only just entered the throat. There should be a complete lack of stolen orbs until at least the stomach is reached. (8:16)\n\n(Group continues, occasionally speaking, this will be cut out for brevity. After 4 minutes of descent, Marshal Stone reports movement.)\n\n__//Marshal Stone://__ Fuller. Movement ahead, abomination? (8:20)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ Impossible. We have walked now, only 10 minutes. Not once in my 20 years of nest raids have I seen a snatcher this far up. (8:20)\n\n__//Marshal Stone://__ But sir, I swear- (8:20)\n\n__//Marshal Godwin://__ Silence yourself. You are seeing things, it happens to recruits. (8:21)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller://__ I recommend you listen to Godwin. (8:21)\n\n__//Marshal Stone://__ Understood. Apologies sir.\n\n(Descent continues for another 6 minutes before another notable event occurs in the “Stomach” of the nest. It is assumed that the team has spotted an “eye-snatcher”.)\n\n__//Marshal Stone//__: Sir. Ahead. (8:27)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller//__: What? This isn’t normal. Fire upon it Stone. \n\n(Marshal Stone is assumed to have fired upon the “eye-snatcher”. The audio becomes “incomprehensible” according to the transcript writer. This is the only note written in the document.)\n\n__//Marshal Fuller//__: (//incomprehensible//) Fire-too many-blood. (8:27-8:30)\n\n(Connection to Marshals is assumed lost)\n\n**SUMMARY**\n\nFollowing the loss of contact with Marshals Fuller, Stone, and Godwin, the abominations took their first recorded motion of direct combat with the Marshal Section.\nThough they fought bravely they were outnumbered, and ultimately 17 marshals and ground staff would die in the massacre.\n[[/==]]\n\n**DEATHS**\n\nRichard Fuller \n\nIvan Stone \n\nEdmund Godwin \n\nSection Officer Edgar Wright\n\n(//14 more names are listed, but will not be displayed for the sake of brevity.//)\n\n [[size larger]] **END OF ADDENDUM**[[/size]] \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum-A-5]]\n* **Document Title:** N/A\n* **Anomalous:** No\n* **Description:** A series of letters faxxed by a member of the “Council of the Victorious City of Hastings” (referred to as the CVCH in the remainder of this document for brevity), the member is seemingly in a manic state due to the presence of eyes “protruding from areas they should not be protruding from”.

They are watching me as I write this. They aren’t just eyes they must be connected to one of those vile beasts. I hear them move every few minutes, I saw one too. It was above me, its head melting through my ceiling. I know they’re outside, I still hear screaming on occasion from one of their victims. I know I’m safer inside than out.\nI know this idea to be incredibly foolish, due to the large-scale attack by the abominations, but I have decided to contact the marshal's office and mayoral office via fax. This is my last call for help.\nI feel the eyes moving in my skin.\nI feel my own eyes attempting to push themselves from my head.\nAnd I feel the hot breath of a snatcher right behind me on my neck.\nHelp.\n[[/<]]\n\n----\n\nOctober, 13th\n\n[[<]]\nMy fingers disappeared today, yet I still feel them tapping away at my keyboard as I write this. But I have no keyboard, I am using my invisible fingers to write on my invisible keyboard. They’re everywhere I look now, I can feel them boring into my skin, creating new orifices every few minutes yet I feel no pain. There is a pile of eyes around a foot high on the ground, they writhe around as if they’re alive, and at this point, I’m convinced they are. I tried leaving the room, only to find a wall made of snatchers. They didn’t do anything but stand in place and stare at me. My windows are blocked in a similar way. Things continued to disappear but I know they are still present, like my bed, which I lay down on still, causing me to float. During the small period of time in which I was able to sleep the snatchers whispered indescribable things to me.\nI know I’m talking to no one.\nI know that everything is over.\nBut if anyone is reading this, please.\nHelp me.\n\n----\n\n14\n[[>]]\nEyes: Gone\n[[/>]]\nScreen: Gone\n[[/<]]\nOutside: Black\n[[=]]\nArms: Gone\n[[/=]]\nFeet: Gone\nEverything: Gone\n\nDeath: neverarriving\n\n[[div style=\"color:red;\"]]\nHowamievenwritinghowamievenwringthisahowhowmabuevwnwritnhhowhowhowhowhowhowbwothisishellthisishellhelphellhelphellphellhelp\nHelphelphelphphelphelphelphelphelphelphelplphekplpehlpehlpehlepgelnshsshHelphelp**//…//**\n[[/div]]\n//(This continues for another 25 pages)//\n----\n\nSCP-5279 is assumed to have warped into our universe during or after this event.
