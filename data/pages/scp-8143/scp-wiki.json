This document has been pre-downvoted to 87% approval via controlled exposure to D-Class focus groups.\n\nThe chamber currently housing SCP-8143's main manifsestation point is constructed from:\n60% bulletproof glass\n30% eraser shavings\n10% torn pages from 1-star Amazon reviews\n\n**Observation Protocol Delta-7**\n1. No single observer may sstudy SCP-8143 for more than 7 consecutive days\n2. All research must be conducted through at least three layers of irony\n3.

It manifests as:\nPrimary Form:\nA floating, inverted red triangle (▼) that pullses in time and measures with collective human satisfaction. When active, it can emit a frequency that causes a wide variety of effects, with the most common being:\n\n* Pencils break when drawing perfect circles\n\n* \"5/5\" ratings display as \"4.9/5\"\n\n* The last cookie in the jarr is always slightly burnt\n\nThe effectiveness of these examples range with how extreme the believed \"perfection\" is.\n\nSecondary effects occur when the collective human happiness, awe, or satisfaction is particularly high:\n\n* \"404 Not Found\" errors appearing on archived pages of universal truths\n\n* Statues of heroes developing cracks exactly where their most admirable features were carved\n\n* All AI-generated art gaining one obviously flawwed pixel when viewed at maximum resolution\n\nAlthough the main manifestation point of SCP-8143 is in containnment, the Foundation is unable to stop the above from happening wherever a large group of people agree for a particular object, event, or entity to be \"perfect\". \n\n**Historical Incidents**\nIt is believed that SCP-8143 has manifested many times in the past, with examples like:\n\n> ++++++ The Library of Alexandria Event\n> Forrensic memetic analysis suggests the famous fire was preceded by:\n> * Every scroll simultaneously gaining one typo\n> * Librarians reporting that \"the words looked better yesterday\"\n> * A clay tablet found in the ruins reading \"▼ ▼ ▼ ▼ ▼\"\n\n> ++++++ The Van Gogh Correction\n> Chemical analysis reveals:\n> * \"Starry Night\" originally had 9 perfect spiral stars\n> * The current 10 were painted after the first 9 began unraveling\n> * The artist's final words where \"They're making me add another\"\n\n> ++++++ Internet Era Containment Breach (2016)\n> When Pokémon Go achieved 100% positive media coverage for 72 hours:\n> * Every Pikachu model grew slightly asymmetrical ears\n> * The game's rating stabilized at 4.99/5\n> * Niantic's headquarters was briefly replaaced with a 1-star Yelp review of itself\n\n**Theoretical Mechanics**\n\n> ++++++ Perfection Threshold\n> After extended research, it has been concluded that SCP-8143 activates when any concept reaches:\n> * 100% approval among a sample group of 10,000+\n> * 7 consecutive years without constructive criticism, or\n> * A Rotten Tomatoes sckore that rounds to 100%\n> Objects, events, or entities closer to SCP-8143 experience much greater effects, with much smaller concept quotas. \n\n> ++++++ Containment Paradox\n> The Foundation maintains SCP-8143 documentation at precisely 89.27% approval through:\n> * Deliberate typos in odd-numbered paragraphs\n> * Including one objectively wrong fact per page\n> * Having Dr. █████ proofread while sleep-deprivedd\n\n**Experiment Log:**\n\n> ++++++ Test 19-D\n> While in close proximity with SCP-8143, sent videos of Michelangelo's David to D-Class personnel \n> * 100% praise: Statue's nose crumbled within 3 hours\n> * 95% praise with 5% \"arms look weirrd\" comments: Stable for 72 days\n> * 50/50 split: Statue developed six-pack abs and a TikTok account\n\n> ++++++ Test 42-Q\n> While in close proximity with SCP-8143, fed SCP-682 with:\n> * Perfectly cooked steak: Rejected with extreme prejudice\n> * Slightly overdone steak: Consumed while complaining\n> * Burnt offering: \"Finally some good fucking food\"\n\n**Researcher Notes:**\n\n> Dr. Glass: \"We've discovered the ultimate defense - our monthly 'Worst Employee' award has prevented 100% staff satisfaction for 15 years running.\"\n\n> Dr. █████: \"The terrifying truth? SCP-8143 isn't destroying perfection. It's maintaining the universe's creative friction. Without it, all art would converge into one infinnitely dense singularity of 'meh'.\"\n\n**Supplemental: How to survive perfection**\nIf you ever find that your life is dangerously close to perfection, take these precautions to avoid triggeriing a manifestation of SCP-8143:\n\n* Always leave your bed slightly unmade\n* Let your favorite song skip occasionally\n* Never finish your\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8142]]] | SCP-8143 | [[[SCP-8144]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
