He could feel his shoulders drooping as he awaited for something, anything, from the field. He let his arms down and tapped his fingers against the desk until he heard a knock at his door.\n\nThe door opened to reveal his Assistant Director, and at the sight of her he stood up.\n\n\"Letícia, some good news?\"\n\nShe cleared her throat.\n\n\"[[[scp-6773|6773]]] has been immobilized. Eta-7's on their way back with it now.\"\n\nEdward let out a massive sigh of relief, before practically falling back into his chair. He leaned an elbow on his armrest and put his hand to his forehead.\n\n\"How many were lost?\"\n\nLetícia flipped through her papers on her clipboard. \"Well, O'Hara died of blood loss, Kent and Ulsevetz don't exist anymore, and McHammond's an octopus.\"\n\nHe rubbed his temple and groaned.\n\n\"And what of SCP-6773's condition?\"\n\nLetícia scoffed lightly. \"SCP-6773 is fine, Director. It was tranquilized by Eta-7 and sustained minimal injuries during its period outside the site.\"\n\nEdward sighed \"Thank goodness. Some good news.\"\n\n\"Hm. Director, with all due respect, I think your concern should be on making sure this doesn't happen again, this is the fourth breach this month. Let Munn worry about its health, we can't let 6773 escape again.\"\n\nThe Director shuffled in his seat a little. \"Well, clearly it isn't happy here. Maybe if we increase feedings, and—\"\n\n\"Pardon me sir, but I meant by not //letting// it escape. It's practically allowed to leave in the wildlife wing; you need to move it to high-risk containment. Anchor it with an SRA, do //something//.\"\n\n\"We've spoken about this, Letícia. Increasing containment intensity and moving the bird to high-risk will only agitate it and get more people hurt. You've seen what it's capable of, even with a Scranton it could breach. Our observations have shown that it only attempts to escape when it's upset. Now it is only a manner of determining //what// is upsetting it. Clearly, it has an attachment to the man who took care of it at the shelter, perhaps we could give him a ring and—\"\n\n\"Why, Edward?\" Letícia interrupted.\n\n\"Well, maybe it will calm it—\"\n\nShe scoffed.\n\n\"No. I mean why keep doing this? Why jump through hoops trying to make the bird happy when you can just anchor it? Why risk countless lives time and time again in a frivolous attempt to please an anomaly that would tear you apart in a second? Why spend all this time trying to make this creature happy when it'd be so much easier to just put a lock on the door?\"\n\nThere was a pause. Letícia watched Edward as he took a deep breath, stood up, adjusted his glasses, and pointed to the insignia behind him.\n\n\"Letícia, are you aware of what this symbol stands for?\"\n\nSilence.\n\nHe continued.\n\n\"Secure, contain, //protect//. By definition, our goal as the Foundation is to protect not only the citizens of the world, but the anomalies we contain. Protecting them can not simply mean keeping them alive, but also keeping them content. Protecting them from suffering under our wing as the public would if they were to be free.\"\n\nHe looked to the insignia.\n\n\"We can't merely lock sapient creatures in a cubicle with a television and some magazines and drop the bundle there; we owe these beings a life of congeniality if we are to strip them of their former shape of living.\" He turned towards his assistant.\n\n\"Would you not agree?\"\n\nShe sighed, easing her tense shoulders. \"No, we're in agreement on that. But you're so hyperfocused on perfecting the //protect// part, that you're practically ignoring the //secure// aspect. You need to balance this differently, sir.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately, the Council doesn't seem to believe in that sort of thing. What's required isn't balance, it's change.\"\n\nEdwards's speaker phone rang, almost on queue. He turned and answered.\n\n\"Administrative offices, Director Irkiv speaking.\"\n\nA communications officer buzzed through the speaker. \"Director, the Overseer Council requests an urgent meeting with you through a secure line.\"\n\nEdward inhaled, sharply. \"Patch them through to my conference room. I'll be there in a few moments.\"\n\n\"Yes, Director.\"\n\nHe hung up and turned to leave. Not before stopping next to his assistant.\n\n\"However, both might be impossible soon enough.\"\n\nEdward left the office, knowing exactly what to expect.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[f<image http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/theme:raviolistyle/225.7 width=\"177px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCP Foundation Secure Facility Dossier\n\n+++ Site-225\n\n**Official Designation:** SCP Foundation Ely Biological Research & Containment Facility\n\n**Site Identification Code:** USNVEL-Site-225\n\n------\n++ General Information\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block name=site.jpg|caption=Site-225's aboveground main entrance]]\n**Site Function:** Site-225 is a large-scale research & containment facility, acting as the hub of operations for the Department of Parazoology's Ichthyology Division and the Medical Department's Veterinary Sciences Division. Site-225 specializes in the research and containment of anomalous wildlife and is home to the Foundation's largest and most advanced veterinary facilities.\n\n**Founded:** 12 July 2011\n\n**Founding Director:** Dr. Edward Beauregard Irkiv\n\n**Location:** Ely, White Pine County, Nevada, United States\n\n**Cover Story:** Avian and Herpetological Conservation Center\n\n**Size:** Aboveground 2,567m² / Subterranean 102,000m²\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Site Overview\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\nLocated on the outskirts of Ely, Nevada, Site-225 is one of the newest Foundation sites in operation, officially founded by Edward B. Irkiv in March of 2011. While it initially operated in standard Foundation fashion, Site-225 soon became home to one of the most anomaly-friendly and diplomatically appropriate containment programs in Foundation history.\n[[include component:image-block name=axel.jpg|width=220px|align=left|caption=[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6366 One] of several anomalies within its specialized containment enclosure at Site-225]]\nInstead of ensuring the permanent containment of anomalies via the use of near-indestructible, heavily guarded containment chambers, Site-225 provides each anomaly with a comfortable, specialized living environment that can be outfitted with requested amenities on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMany sentient anomalies are also provided with designated enrichment periods, during which they are allowed to interact with designated on-site personnel. In some cases, entities are allowed minimal interaction with other sentient anomalies, following authorization from both entity's research heads.\n\nProviding contained anomalies with these features has shown to significantly decrease the desire to cause dangerous incidents amongst the entities themselves. Of course, [[[scp-6773|some anomalies]]] still require somewhat stricter containment procedures.\n\nIn recent years, however, Site-225's esoteric containment protocols have brought dismay to members of O5 Command and other administrative committees, as the Site has seen a recent upswing in [[[animal-antics|containment breaches caused by sentient anomalies]]]. The O5 believe these breaches could have been prevented if much stricter containment procedures had been in place at the time; however, Director Irkiv has remained confident in the effectiveness of his containment program and has stood firm in maintaining current protocols.\n\nSite-225 also acts as the hub of operations for both the Ichthyology Division and the Veterinary Sciences Division. The Ichthyology Division focuses primarily on the research and containment of piscine anomalies both on and offsite, while the Veterinary Sciences Division is focused on the medical wellbeing of all anomalous animals contained by the Foundation. Because of Site-225's abundance of anomalous wildlife, the Site has been outfitted with the largest and most advanced veterinary facilities under Foundation operation, all of which are overseen by the site's head veterinarian, Dr. Everleigh Munn.\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Staffing Information\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=irkiv.jpg|caption=Director Edward B.

Site Director:** Dr. Letícia Bastos\n\n**Onsite Personnel:** 550\n\nAll onsite departments, projects, and other activities are overseen by the Directors Council, made up of Administrative personnel, senior researchers and onsite project and department heads. Administrative activities that require O5 attention are dealt with by the Site Director and their personal staff.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ THE DIRECTORS COUNCIL\n----\n**Site:** USNVEL-Site-225\n**Members:** 11\n[[/=]]\n\n**Members**\n* Site Director - Edward B.

Assigned to deal with onsite containment breaches, be they sitewide or isolated instances. The task force was initially created as [[[SCP-6773]]]'s personal recontainment team but was assigned to the entire site after showing extreme diligence in recontaining the entity on multiple occasions.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Mobile Task Force Rho-25 \"All's Well\"**\n**Squad Count:** 6\n\n**Description:** Rho-25 is a task force which is focused on the protection and retrieval of anomalous animals and anomalous biological materials as well as preventing the poaching of any wild anomalous species. Rho-25 focuses on prevention and retrieval through diplomacy and espionage, rather than combat, though its members are perfectly capable fighters if it combat is required. Rho-25 is in regular contact with the Global Occult Coalition and local conservation groups. Although it is based out of Site-225, Rho-25 often finds itself nested at other sites due to their work.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Site History\n-----\n[[/=]]\n[[include component:image-block name=meeting.jpg|align=left|caption=Ethics Comittee meeting regarding the quality of standard humanoid containment protocols, 1989.]]\nSite-225's esoteric containment methods date back far before the Site's founding. In 1983, the site's founding director Dr. Edward B. Irkiv was initiated as a member of the Ethics Committee and became dedicated to ensuring quality of livelihood among the anomalies contained within the Foundation, as he believed they were treated exceptionally unfairly under Foundation ordinance. Irkiv helped implement several anomaly-friendly projects and proposals and participated in several anomalous humanoid rights campaigns, helping improve standard humanoid containment protocols throughout the Foundation. While Irkiv did have his supporters, several members of the O5 Council did not approve of his divergent ideals.\n\nIn 1998, Irkiv proposed the Friendly Containment Program to the Ethics Committee, a project that would drastically change standard containment procedures for living anomalies throughout the Foundation. Irkiv's proposal intended to give contained anomalies a more comfortable environment instead of implementing harsh, forceful containment procedures. He proposed the possibility that his program could eliminate the factor of escape attempts by providing contained entities with a high enough quality of life that they would not want to escape.\n\nThe Ethics Committee could not come to a decision on Irkiv's proposal. Many members thought the project was outrageous, while others agreed with him on the subject of modern containment, but could not look past the flaws within his proposal. After three weeks on the table, O5 Command shut down Irkiv's proposal and removed him from the Ethics Committee entirely, expressing their concern with the danger they feared the Friendly Containment Program would exhibit.\n\nDespite his shortcomings, Irkiv stood strong in his beliefs and climbed back up the Foundation ladder to Assistant Site Director of [[[scp-6299|Site-104]]], eventually being offered the opportunity to stand as a founding director of the newly planned Site-225.\n[[include component:image-block name=underground.jpg|align=right|caption=Construction of Site-225's subevel-1, 2010.]]\n\nInitially intended as simply a large-scale wildlife containment site, Director Irkiv planned to address his concerns with containment protocols by implementing his own forms of containment as director. After its founding in 2011, Director Irkiv and his Site Head of Containment Terra Dunayevsky implemented their own unconventional containment methods, similar to the Friendly Containment Program, but improved under Dunayevsky's guidance. Like its predecessor, Site-225's containment protocols prioritized the comfort of anomalies over more forceful containment solutions.\n\nIrkiv's protocols once again provoked the O5 Council, leading to a divisive meeting between the two parties. After much debate, the O5 decided to allow Site-225 to operate under Irkiv's containment program for a set period of two years, during which they would assess its effectiveness and decide whether or not the program could function as a permanent containment solution. Site-225 experienced zero containment incidents during the two-year assessment period and was thus allowed to permanently operate under Irkiv's containment plan. The Site made record history under this plan, reaching a period of eight years without any containment incidents. This streak continued until April 25th, 2021, when the site's first high-risk anomaly, [[[SCP-6773]]], breached containment. Disastrous containment breaches rose in density as the site began to house more dangerous and unpredictable anomalies over the following years, forcing Irkiv to make some more restrictive decisions in regard to his containment plan.\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Organizations and Subdivisions\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Department of Parazoology's Ichthyology Subdivision\n[[/=]]\n\nMost of the research conducted at Site-225 revolves around living beings in one way or another; however, no research tactics are more advanced than those used in the studies conducted by the Ichthyology Subdivision. From studying sentient aquatic life to inventing bio-engineered underwater breathing apparatuses, the Ichthyology Subdivision is home to the brightest minds of the marine biology world, all of who are eager to assist the Foundation in coming to a better understanding of all aspects of aquatic life.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Medical Department's Veterinary Sciences Subdivision\n[[/=]]\n\nWhile veterinarians have been a part of the Foundation since its inception, veterinary sciences have always come second to the human-focused aspects of the Medical Department's operations. The veterinary sciences subdivision's headquarters were relocated to Site-225 following its establishment, where it has been granted more autonomy from the rest of its division. Individual members of the veterinary sciences subdivision are stationed in numerous Foundation establishments; however, most usually visit Site-225 at one point or another, either for conferences or training.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Project GREENGRASS\n[[/=]]\n\nIn 2014 the Encard report, a study done in tandem with the Mana Charitable Foundation and the Council of 108, was released and indicated the rapid decline in the health of global non-anomalous ecosystems was inextricably linked with the decline of extant anomalous species. In response to the findings of the report, Project GREENGRASS was created in 2015, placing Angus Encard as the head of the operation.\n\nProject GREENGRASS' goal is to engage in and support conservation activities where doing so would support the Foundation's main effort of containing anomalies. Poject GREENGRASS often works with or supports local conservation groups and Groups of Interest where the goals of these groups and the Foundation's project align. While the main goal of the Foundation, and thus all Sites operated primarily by the Department of Parazoology, is to contain anomalies, Project GREENGRASS recognizes that containment must sometimes take the form of information control, rather than locking something in a box.\n\nBesides direct conservation efforts, Project GREENGRASS engages in other activities, such as educating other departments about the principles of anomalous conservation. Project GREENGRASS is also tasked with retrieving anomalous organisms which have been poached, and preventing anomalous poaching, for which MTF Rho-25 exists.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Nevada Avian Rescue Association (NARA)\n[[/=]]\n\nNARA is Site-225's cover-story, though it serves more purposes than simply being a facade. Founded shortly before Site-225 finished construction, NARA's stated goal is to act as a conservation and rehabilitation center which functions secondarily as an education center. NARA has a park located a half mile behind the main Site-225 building, where they display non-anomalous birds, reptiles, and a small amount of mammals, which are unable to return to the wild. NARA is a large player in the southwest's wildlife rescue scene, with comparatively more funding and manpower than other organizations in the area. Because of this influence, they are quickly able to identify rescued wildlife exhibiting signs of anomalous activity.\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Site Layout\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Aboveground\n[[/=]]\n\nSite-225's aboveground level is operated under the NARA (Nevada Avain Rescue Association) Foundation front. It serves as an avian and herpetological conservation center, focused on conserving native avian and reptilian wildlife and rehabilitating injured or otherwise incapacitated animals. Additionally, several concealed entrances to the site exist within the surrounding area.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Sublevel 1\n[[/=]]\n\nSublevel 1 contains the majority of all onsite living quarters, cafetoriums, and staff enrichment activities. Sublevel 1 acts as a home for onsite personnel, offering an assortment of activities for personnel to partake in between shifts, including a small aquarium operated by the Ichthyology Division, which is based on the same level.\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Sublevel 2\n[[/=]]\n\nSublevel 2 is the largest level onsite and houses the majority of Site-225's contained anomalies, as well as most of the site's research facilities and offices. The Low-Risk Humanoid Containment Wing and the Wildlife Containment Wing are located on this floor, the latter of which is the largest containment sector onsite, taking up approximately half of Sublevel 2 itself. The Veterinary Wing is also located here, run by the Veterinary Sciences Division, and home to all onsite veterinary facilities.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Sublevel 3\n[[/=]]\n\nSublevel 3 is Site-225's most secure containment sector. One of the smaller floors, Sublevel 3 is made up of the High-risk Containment Wing and the Inanimate Containment Wing, which houses non-living inanimate anomalies.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Sublevel 4\n[[/=]]\n\nSublevel-4 is off-limits to non-Administrative personnel. Sublevel-4 Is made up of the Directorial Wing and the Directors Council's meeting chambers. Further details regarding Sublevel 4 are provided to relevant personnel on a need-to-know basis.\n\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Anomalies Under the Jurisdiction of Site-225\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n||~ ID Number ||~ Object Class ||\n|| [[[SCP-6127]]] || Uncontained ||\n|| [[[SCP-6366]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-6773]]] || Keter ||\n|| [[[SCP-6922]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-7018]]] || Uncontained ||\n|| [[[SCP-8271]]] || Euclid ||\n|| [[[SCP-8275]]] || Euclid ||\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ Notable Containment Incidents\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**25 September, 2021**\n[[/=]]\n\nMultiple anomalies sitewide managed to breach containment simultaneously, including [[[SCP-6366|SCP-6366-1, SCP-6366-2,]]] and [[[SCP-6773]]].

He'd been able to suppress the council's concern and anger regarding containment failures in the past, but this was different. There was no easy fix to prevent this from reoccurring. There were no invisible cracks in the wall he could point out. SCP-6773 broke out because it wanted to and nothing was there to stop it.\n\nTypically Edward would be quick to provide a solution that would cool the the council's heated waters, but not this time. Primarily, in all honesty, because he didn't exactly have one.\n\nHe faced the large monitor in the room, which displayed feed from O5-12, O5-9, and O5-3. While usually there to support Edward and his endeavors, O5-3 remained silent as O5-9 continued his tirade in regards to Site-225's situation.\n\n\"Irkiv, I'm going to be straightforward with you. I can not for the life of me think of one good reason for you to continue to keep a large, aggressive, //ontokinetic// anomaly in light-form containment. You've allowed one of the most frequent causes of fatal containment breaches in Foundation history to reside in a nicely decorated, temperature-controlled enclosure without as much as an SRA in sight!\"\n\nEdward attempted to speak but was interrupted.\n\n\"I- I shouldn't even need to tell you this, Irkiv! It is incredibly clear that no form of 'friendly containment' is going to keep 6773 from breaching. You need to move this thing to heavy containment. Now.\"\n\nEdward took a sharp inhale. \"I understand your frustration, Overseer, but I believe there must be another way. If I could—\"\n\nHe was cut off again.\n\n\"No, Irkiv. You said that five days ago, and guess what? There was no other way. At least not one that actually //worked// as a viable containment solution. People are dead because of that. You know that, right?\"\n\nO5-3 spoke up. \"Okay, I think you've proven your point.\"\n\n\"No, Three, people are //dead//! I know casualties aren't exactly foreign to the Foundation, but these were easily preventable. And more people are going to die if you keep that bird in light containment, Irkiv. More blood entirely on your hands. More families without their loved ones coming home!\"\n\n\"We simply don't know that, Overseer.\" Edward replied. \"Even in heavy containment, there's a nick of a chance that it could breach. We could further prevent any chance of casualty in its entirety if we scrub out 6773's desire to escape. It has worked in the past, zero instances of SCP-6942 in our care have breached since we improved the quality of their containment following their last incident, thus saving further lives.\"\n\n\"Be that as it may, these are two fundamentally different anomalies, both in terms of functionality and containment complexity. You have tried and tried again to keep 6773 at bay under your site's abstract policies, and it's done nothing but cause harm and get people killed! You need to anchor it. Now.\"\n\nThere was a quick silence, broken just as quickly by O5-12.\n\n\"I concur, Nine. Director, do you have any propositions to prevent further containment breaches involving moving SCP-6773 to high-risk containment?\n\nEdward cleared his throat. \"I simply believe that if we make the—\"\n\n\"Answer the question directly, Director.\"\n\nEdward let out a small, almost invisible sigh. \"No.\"\n\n\"Then your opinion is irrelevant and therefore dismissed.\"\n\nAs slight as it was, Edward could practically hear the smug look on O5-9's face.\n\nO5-12 continued. \"Director Irkiv, as you have proven incapable of coming up with a serviceable long-term containment plan for SCP-6773, the overseer council is hereby overriding your program on its account. Your containment team is to come up with a high-risk containment plan for SCP-6773 within the next seven days, and is to submit it to the council before implementation for review.\"\n\nEdward was taken aback, stammering as he tried to speak. \"Overseer, I don't quite think this is fair.\"\n\n\"It's more than fair, Irkiv.\" O5-9 said, piping in. \"We've allowed you time and time again to come up with eccentric ways to try to contain 6773, and none of them have worked. You have been given more than enough chances on this.\"\n\n\"Am- am I given any choice in this matter? As Site Director, I believe I should have a voice in regards to my own containment policies.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't still //be// Site Director right now if it wasn't for Dunayevsky!\"\n\n\"Enough, Nine.\" O5-12 barked.\n\nHe was silent. O5-12 cleared her throat before continuing.\n\n\"It is clear your judgment is clouded on this matter, Director. Since you refuse to make the necessary changes needed, the council is stepping in. For the safety of your site, and you.\"\n\nEdward was silent.\n\n\"You have seven days.\"\n\nO5-12 disconnected, followed by O5-9. O5-3 remained on the line.\n\nEdward loosened his stance and sighed as he turned from the screen, putting his fingers to the bridge of his nose in dismay.\n\n\"I really do appreciate all the assistance I got from you there, Omar.\"\n\nO5-3 let out a small, sarcastic laugh. \"There //is// only so much I can do for you, Ed.\"\n\nEdward turned back to the overseer and scoffed. \"You could have been on my side! You could have- I don't know, agreed with me? Gave voice to your disagreement on the matter?\"\n\n\"No, I couldn't.\"\n\n\"And why not?\"\n\nThere was a pause.\n\n\"...Because I agree with the council, Edward. 6773 has proven far too dangerous to be kept in light containment. Trying to keep it there is just going to get more people killed.\"\n\n\"It- but it just isn't right to do so! The bird is simply scared, it's confused! You've read the logs, you know why it behaves as it does! Heavy containment will make it angry, destroy its very spirit!\"\n\n\"But it won't //kill// people there, Edward.\"\n\nAs Edward went to speak, he stopped himself. He was right.\n\nO5-3 huffed, rubbing his right temple for a moment. \"Look, I know this means a lot to you, and I know you think it's the right thing to do. But you can't risk more lives over the emotional well-being of an uncooperative anomaly. It's not practical, and it's certainly not cost-efficient.\"\n\nA solemn, defeated sigh escaped from Edward's chest. \"I know.\"\n\nThe two were quiet for a moment before the room's speakers blared to life.\n\n\"ONSITE PERSONNEL BE ADVISED: SCP-6773 HAS ARRIVED ONSITE AND IS BEING ESCORTED TO TEMPORARY CONTAINMENT.
