The area is to be monitored, and repairs are to be made should the net be breached.--\n\n**Description:** SCP-3610 is an irregular area of roughly 2.6 km^^2^^, located in ███████, Shandong Province, China. SCP-3610 has a salt water pond of roughly 140 m^^2^^ in size and 5m deep (referred to as SCP-3610-1) located inside it, and is otherwise filled with pebbles.\n\nTwo anomalous properties are observed:\n\n* When solid matter is placed within SCP-3610-1, the same volume of water will disappear. Dissolved substances present in the water will be left behind. This effect will not reverse even after the object is removed.\n\n* When avian lifeforms enter SCP-3610 at an altitude of 15m or less, they will stop all previous activities and begin to find and carry stones from the surrounding area, and place them within SCP-3610-1.[[footnote]]This triggers the primary effect and results in reduction of the size and depth of SCP-3610-1.[[/footnote]] This will continue until they eventually die of exhaustion.\n\nIt is theorized that SCP-3610-1 once covered the entirety of SCP-3610, but reduced to the current size due to the anomalous properties.\n\n**Addendum:** Aside from the remains of avian lifeforms, digging at the site of SCP-3610 found remains of various sea life, as well the skeleton of a female humanoid dating back to around 3000 BCE, later classified as Anomalous Object #72976. DNA analysis of the subject shows no significant differences from baseline human DNA. However, AO#72976 possesses hollow bone structures similar to those found in avian lifeforms and half-developed wings in place of arms and hands. A piece of jade jewelry was recovered from its chest, with Chinese characters of previously unknown variation engraved on it. The text translates to \"Beloved daughter of [illegible]\".\n\nAfter AO#72976 was removed from the site, SCP-3610 ceased all anomalous activities. Putting AO#72976 into bodies of water or burying it near bodies of water yielded no result, and SCP-3610 was reclassified as Neutralized.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3609]]] | SCP-3610 | [[[SCP-3611]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
