The following is a list of notable discoveries:\n\n@@@@\n\n* **1:** SCP-7101 first became noticeable as legal restrictions on casino enterprises became more lenient, resulting in said industries adapting more intrusive, unethical, and forceful practices and functions. This would result in around a 2 - 6% dropoff in customers, however, a 12 - 22% increase in profits for the various establishments.\n\n* **2:** 13% of areas affected by SCP-7101 appear to form a circular pattern within Northern America.\n\n* **3:** Individuals closer to the center of this pattern display increased belief that events caused by SCP-7101 are caused by a deific entity that personifies \"Luck\". Low-level BK-Class (\"Broken Masquerade\") scenario possible.\n\n* **4:** A large, mostly underground facility housing an assortment of entities or objects held within individual cells, located at the innermost center of the aforementioned circular pattern.\n\n* **5:** All names, dates, or titles found within the facility are obscured in some way. This appears to extend to describing factors that identified the purpose, content, or context of affected nomenclature.\n* **5A:** A plaque positioned on a gate surrounding the compound, reading \"[OBSCURRED], DANGER KEEP OUT\".\n* **5B:** A recovered document pertaining to future operations for an unknown subject. The date is obscured. The document appears to be old and weathered.\n* **5C:** A massive system of various technologies. A nearby document is nearly entirely obscured, with only various percentages being eligible.\n* **5D:** A complex roughly 2^^3^^M, levitating between 0.2 and 0.8 meters off the ground, positioned 3 meters out from the previously described discovery. The shape is comprised of an unknown number of layers that are constantly rotating, with a singular small window into its center being present in each layer. A hazard pattern on the floor surrounds the complex, and red hazard/death symbols are printed on nearby walls.\n\n* **6:** A human corpse is attached to several systems. Approximately 78% of its body is absent, and a bullet hole penetrates through its head. The corpse is in advanced decay. A bullet casing found nearby matched that of standard Foundation issue ammunition, though prior to this discovery, no ventures into the compound were reported.\n* **6A:** Several corpses surround the machine, with varying causes of death. A panel is located in front of it, with 2 buttons, 2 obscured labels, and 3 filled key slots. A corpse lies beneath the panel.\n\n@@@@\n\nInvestigations regarding SCP-7101's absence have ceased. Efforts are being made to understand the situation regarding this facility's origin and purpose further, accessible in a different document.\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n##black|Ending 6/8, \"[OBSCURED]\"##\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
