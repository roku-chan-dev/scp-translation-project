SCP-7915 must be cleaned every six months to keep it in a playable state. SCP-7915 must be serviced at \"Symphonic's Cleaning & Polishing\" once a year to prevent it from falling into disrepair.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]//\"Symphonic's Cleaning & Polishing: Instrument Repair Shop\"// is a Foundation-owned instrument repair shop located in New Orleans, Louisiana. Shipping of SCP-7915 is handled by //\"Stamps, Carriers, and Parcels\",//  another Foundation-owned shipping company.[[/span]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-7915 is a ritualistic instrument, currently taking the form of a tenor saxophone. When used at night by a subject, regardless of experience with the instrument, they will perform a series of disconnected melodies. During this session, the Moon, regardless of location or visibility, will appear to move closer to the Earth. \n\nThe physical distance between the Earth and Moon will not change, however, the local area around SCP-7915 will experience the gravitational effects of the approaching Moon.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Observed to affect a radius of up to twenty miles.[[/span]]\n\nAs the subject plays SCP-7915, other instruments are heard, accompanying SCP-7915. At the end of every SCP-7915 event, subjects will play the same melodic phrase, designated as SCP-7915-A. As SCP-7915-A is played, the subject will levitate towards the Moon until they've disappeared from sight. Once the subject disappears, the Moon will appear to return to its original state, and SCP-7915 will levitate down to the ground with a note attached to its bell:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= Thank you, my star.\n= \n= I love you.\n[[/div]]\n\nAll subjects that have disappeared are declared missing, as no trace of them has been found on the lunar surface.\n\nNo memetic effects or compulsory effects were found during the testing of SCP-7915. In the event a subject stops playing SCP-7915, the Moon will return to its original position and SCP-7915 will not be able to initiate another SCP-7915 event for three days. During this period, subjects will lack the previous knowledge and ability to play SCP-7915, even with prior experience.\n\n\n------\n= **Addendum 7915.1:** SCP-7915-A\n------\nAfter a thorough analysis, SCP-7915-A exhibits no memetic or cognitohazardous properties and has been deemed safe for listening.

The relationship between the mortal and the Moon is characterized by a sense of loneliness and isolation. \n\nDue to conflicting records and the inability to confirm the validity of these events, it is impossible to create a coherent timeline of SCP-7915's location throughout human history. It was theorized that SCP-7915 had the ability to alter its structure and relocate itself, or shift its anomalous properties to another instrument. However, after extensive testing, no additional properties were found in SCP-7915 that match these predictions. \n\nAn abridged record of SCP-7915's appearances throughout documented history has been attached below:\n@@@@\n\n||~ Date ||~ Location ||~ Description ||\n|| ~25,000 years ago || Eastern Carpathians[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A mountain range located in Eastern Europe.[[/span]] || Cave paintings depicting a weeping caveman ostracized from their tribe. The caveman plays a bone flute, believed to be SCP-7915, flying up into the Moon. The tribe, watching the incident, begins to worship the Moon, operating only at night. This is believed to be the first documented instance of SCP-7915, as well as the first instance of a deity within the Moon. ||\n|| 922 B.C.E - 115 B.C.E|| Greece || A Greek myth about Acheron, the heir to a wealthy family, who was ostracized from their community on account of their unfavorable appearance. Acheron only came out of his house at night, where he fell in love with Selene, believing that she was his protector, under \"the Moon's watchful eye.\" He steals a lyre from his father's house and climbs the tallest hill. His father, awakened by the noise, wakes up to witness Acheron using the lyre, believed to be SCP-7915, to serenade a marriage proposal to Selene. After watching his son float up to the sky, the village attempts to offer sacrifices of unwanted residents to Selene, with little success. ||\n||1 B.C.E. || Rome, Roman Empire || Rumors of mysterious instrumental music around the statue of Luna on nights with a full Moon. Reports were largely anecdotal, with all records of the rumor described through a secondary source. Music was described as somber and depressing followed by a shared desire to embrace the statue because \"she wanted someone to love her.\" Further attempts to find more legitimate sources for the phenomenon are ongoing. ||\n||||||= **{{17 entries omitted for brevity}}**||\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7915/figure.jpg\n| caption=A recreation of a Selene statue as a figure, previously in possession of Aleister Crowley.\n| width=25%\n| align=right]]\n|| 1943-1947 || Moscow, Soviet Union || SCP-7915 was found to previously be in possession of Containment Specialist James Crowley's distant uncle, [[[SCP-4220|Aleister Crowley]]], in its current form. Aleister reportedly used SCP-7915 to \"make contact with her,\" and used SCP-7915 as a vessel for other occult practices. Aleister's last journal entry, circa 1947, depicted Aleister planning to use SCP-7915 when the Moon was \"full and gaping.\" Containment Spec. James Crowley reported that Aleister was considered a \"lunatic\" that was \"too obsessed with the Moon to be considered normal.\" A figure of Selene was found in Aleister's residence, along with other lunar-related objects.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Analysis of the figure (shown right) reveals a thin, hardened coating of genetic material, confirmed to originate from Aleister Crowley.[[/span]] ||\n\n\n------\n= **Addendum 7915.3:** Discovery\n------\nSCP-7915 was discovered in the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, belonging to the missing Stella Turner, an intern who had worked there for the past year. This was paired with reports from several civilians and news networks on the abnormal size and perceived approach of the full moon two nights before. \n\nCamera footage and civilian reports place Stella Turner on the museum's rooftop with SCP-7915. An audio journal was discovered along with SCP-7915 and was taken by undercover Foundation agents embedded in the NYPD.\n\nTranscriptions of the audio logs are appended below:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n= **AUDIO LOG**\n------\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n**Stella:** Hello, is this thing on?\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**Stella:** Sweet, it works!
