Publicly, storms caused by SCP-5427 are to be attributed to unique seabed formations in the Strait of Dover.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5427 is a phenomenon - which started in 1950 - regarding periodic oddities in localized weather and its effects on a 13km stretch of chalk cliffs off of the coast of Kent, England. During the phenomenon a thick fog with no apparent cause will form around the edge of the coastline in the region; at the same time the coastal tide will intensify greatly, producing waves reaching heights of up to 300 meters despite no geological support for such tides. The resulting 'storm' may last anywhere between a few hours and 3 weeks and will deposit vast amounts of pure chalk sediment onto the coastline which will in turn quickly solidify and merge with the existing cliff-face. Due to this the coastline in the region expands at an extremely-high rate of 20-40 meters per month; if the phenomenon is allowed to occur uninterruptedly, only the forward facing/original cliffs will be affected. This produces a narrow land bridge growing directly toward Calais, France.\n\n[[size 150%]]**Addendum:**[[/size]]\n\n[[size 125%]]Annual Archive of SCP-5427 activity and its effects[[/size]]\n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1951:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 26 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1952:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 32 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1953:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 30 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1954:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 24 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1955:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 32 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1956:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 39 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1957:** Slight alteration to usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 60 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** Increase of activity, corrosion efforts paused for one week to allow for observation.\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1958:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 67 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** Activity has stayed at a higher rate than previous years for the last twelve months -adopted as new norm.\n> \n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1959:** No alteration to the usual occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 70 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** N/A\n> \n\n\n> \n> **Observation Report Jan 1 1960:** Major change to occurrence and effects.\n> **Expansion before operation:** 0 meters.\n> \n> **Notes:** Steady decrease in average activity along the coastline over the last few weeks, major increase in one section of the coastline but with little to no expansion toward sea.
