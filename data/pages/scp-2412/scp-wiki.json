If a researcher has the intent to ask SCP-2412 a question about the future, they must fill out application 2412-F7o and turn it in to the site administrator. If said application is approved, one guard with a copy of the application will be posted inside the containment chamber while the researcher is asking questions. If, at any time, the researcher asks a question regarding the future that is not on the application, he or she will be removed from the containment chamber, and may or may not be given Class-C amnestics, depending on the sensitivity of information provided by SCP-2412.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2412 is a fully functional humanoid automaton that resembles an adult human female. SCP-2412 is composed of many complex clockwork and steam-powered systems including, but not limited to, rotational systems made of clockwork with the functionality of joint rotation and limb movement in general; a large, complex mass of clockwork systems in the cardial area of the chest that often emits dense clouds of steam; and, lastly, a steam powered engine located on the rear side of SCP-2412 accompanied by a fuel gauge that currently reads \"98%\". This engine is believed to provide SCP-2412 with energy to function, but this cannot be proven, as no attempts to breach the engine to examine its insides have proven successful.\n\nSCP-2412 is capable of vocalization, and is able to speak all known languages, as well as some others[[footnote]]Languages from its timeline.[[/footnote]]. The object is also capable of basic motor skills such as walking and using its hands as a means to take hold of objects.\n\nWhen asked a question, SCP-2412 will respond with a correct answer, except in these cases: \n* SCP-2412 is posed a question about anything it deems anomalous[[footnote]]SCP-2412's exact definition of the word 'anomalous' seems to be extremely similar to the Foundation's, but there are some variations.[[/footnote]], or anything that may be affected by an anomaly[[footnote]]SCP-2412's information seems to be restricted in most situations directly regarding an anomaly; for example, it cannot predict when a raid on a Foundation site will be attempted by a Group of Interest. Despite this, it is still able to determine things that will happen/have happened even if they were affected by an anomaly. For example, if the population of a town was killed off by an anomaly, SCP-2412 is capable of answering what killed them. It seems that SCP-2412 is unable to answer questions regarding anomalies in the future, but is somewhat capable of answering questions about them in the past.[[/footnote]]\n* SCP-2412 is posed an incoherent question, i.e. \"Where clock pant leg?\"\n* SCP-2412 is posed a question about how it was made or where it gets its information[[footnote]]This likely corresponds with the first exception, but it is too important to overlook.[[/footnote]].\n* SCP-2412 is posed a question about a paradoxical situation, eg. asking about the 'Grandfather Paradox' and what the outcome would be.\n\nIn these cases, SCP-2412 will respond with \"Warning: Logic Error.\" Aside from these, SCP-2412 is capable of answering, with extreme accuracy, any type of question. These include, but are not limited to, questions regarding the future, scientific theories currently unconfirmed or misunderstood, and laws of nature that are not currently understood. \n\nIt is currently unknown where SCP-2412 gets its information, and when posed a question about this, it will respond with \"Warning: Logic Error.\"\n\n**Discovery Log:** SCP-2412 was discovered in an abandoned factory in ██████, South Carolina. The factory had been abandoned for at least 150 years, dating no further back than the year 1825. \n\n**Interview Log-A1:** \n\n> //Interviewer: Researcher Carter (project leader), Interviewee: SCP-2412.

Seeking approval of an interview about basic human traits: Is it sapient? Can it feel emotion? Et cetera.// -Researcher Carter\n\n//Approved.//                                                                 -Edward Harden, Site Administrator\n \n \n**Interview Log-A2:** \n> //Interviewer: Researcher Carter, Interviewee: SCP-2412.

What war is this, and which faction was victorious?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** The war between Germany's colonies and Germany. Germany's colonies wanted to be independent.

Next question: Are you sapient?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Yes.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Are you capable of feeling emotions? \n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Yes.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Okay, what makes you happy?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Questions.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Lastly, what do you fear?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Loneliness.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Thank you, SCP-2412. We will ask some other questions at a separate time.\n> \n> //SCP-2412 remains silent.//\n \n//End log. Extended questioning requested. We need much more information, so I'm requesting a waiver on the questions regarding the future, as well as a question limit of 50 instead of 10.// -Researcher Carter\n\n//Approved.//                                                                -Edward Harden, Site Administrator\n\n[[collapsible show=\"{+}Extended Interview Log-B1\" hide=\"{-}Extended Interview Log-B1\"]]\n> //Interviewer: Researcher Carter, Interviewee: SCP-2412.
