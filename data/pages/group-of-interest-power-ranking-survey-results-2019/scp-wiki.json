I want to thank everyone who took the time to fill it out. Over one hundred people endured a slow and laggy Google Forms interface in order to make their opinions known. While these results are not the final word on these Groups of Interest, they do represent a moderately accurate take on how the community views the groups at this moment in time. \n\nSpecial thanks to [[*user magna2s]] for putting most of the survey itself together, [[*user Elenee Fishtruck]] for making the template to put the results in, [[*user Zyn]] for giving me permission to place it on the front page. The most extra special thanks to the love of my life, Caroline, for sitting with me and tabulating these results. This wouldn't have happened without any of you guys. Especially not Caroline she seriously spent hours messing with spreadsheets to make everything work.\n\nNow without further ado, to the Power Rankings!\n\n[[toc]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+ **__The Results__**\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Note:** Each GoI-section contained 5 questions, each corresponding to a certain value of the GoI. These values were:\n\n* **Activity:** How often do you think this GoI is used? Do you remember seeing any articles use this group recently?\n * **Average Score:** 5.2\n* **Usability:** How usable is the GoI? Is it accessible? Is there enough lore, or too much?\n * **Average Score:** 6.2\n* **Peak Value:** How would you rank the best article about this GoI?\n * **Average Score:** 7.3\n* **Pitfalls:** At its worst, how unenjoyable is the GoI to read about?\n * **Average Score:** 3.8\n* **Originality:** How original is the GoI? Does it fill a good niche?\n * **Average Score:** 5.3\n\nEach value could be scored from zero to ten. //The data below portrays the average scores for each value per GoI//, rounded to the nearest tenth. The number of people that answered each question varied. A link to the raw data will be provided in the comments section. \n\n,,A small note of an error: No comments section on Originality was provided for the ORIA and Oneiroi sections of the survey. We apologize for the oversight, it did not affect the collection of data but would've been an interesting insight. If you took the survey and would like to have your thoughts on the originality of the ORIA or Oneiroi be known, PM [[*user Roget]] with your comment and permission to include it with these results.,,\n\n@@ @@\n++ Alexylva University\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image AlexylvaGraph]]\n\n**Activity:** 2.8\n**Usability:** 4.3\n**Peak Value:** 5.3\n**Pitfalls:** 3.3\n**Originality:** 5.7\n\n**Praise:** It's an extremely original concept (intellectual, philosophical, metaphysical, and technological colonialism on a multiversal scale accomplished by an alt-future college in a setting where Rome never quite fell).\n\n**Criticism:** Alternate-Universe/Alternate History stuff can be interesting, but a lot of Alexylva articles suffer from the fact that they're inconsistent with each other over how the alternate history works-- is it Carthage or Rome that's taken over? The Hub and Eskobar's original writings imply the former, but most seem to go with the latter.\n \n**Another Thing:** fuck alexylva all my homies go to deer\n\n**71 Responses**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Ambrose Restaurants\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image AmbroseGraph]]\n\n**Activity:** 3.7\n**Usability:** 5.5\n**Peak Value:** 6.6\n**Pitfalls:** 4.2\n**Originality:** 6.3\n\n**Praise:** I believe there is just enough behind it, which gives plenty of space to expand on an idea.\n\n**Criticism:** Kinda feels like an MCD offshoot, but works in its niche well. Just needs more personal Tales and explanations to help increase it. \n\n \n**Another Thing:** reminds me of pizzagate\n\n**75 Responses**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Anderson Robotics\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image AndersonGraph]]\n\n**Activity:** 5.7\n**Usability:** 6.5\n**Peak Value:** 7.7\n**Pitfalls:** 4.4\n**Originality:** 6.6\n\n**Praise:** We don't really have something that explores the sentience of robots.  Mekhanites come close, but those are more about Becoming Machine than it is about artificial consciousness.  Anderson Robotics hits that, and the unique psyche they present, pretty well.\n\n**Criticism:** The lore of AR is tied way too closely to the Those Twisted Pines/Third Law canon, both of which are MASSIVE. I legitimately do not understand what their deal is, and for the most part, they seem just like discount Prometheus Labs.\n \n**Another Thing:** Low effort Wal-E fanfictions.\n\n**64 Responses**\n\n\n##white|I've never read a Wall-E fanfiction but he did have some nice graspers for hands - Caro##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Are We Cool Yet?\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image AWCYGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 6.6\n**Usability:** 7.4\n**Peak Value:** 8.3\n**Pitfalls:** 3.5\n**Originality:** 7.4\n\n**Praise:** Straight-forward, not too much reading needed, but more reading helps get an idea. Common media also helps.\n\n**Criticism:** It can so often devolve into \"murder for murder's sake\", and sometimes the stories can become so high-level that they're difficult to understand.\n\n**Another Thing:** if there's anything i want to read about it's a bunch of pretentious hacks squatting in a world that hates them\n\n**69 Responses** ##white|Nice B) - Caro##\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Black Queen\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image BlackQueenGraph]]\n\n**Activity:** 3.8\n**Usability:** 5.3\n**Peak Value:** 6.5\n**Pitfalls:** 3.0\n**Originality:** 5.7\n\n**Praise:** All you need to know is that it's an infinite army of Dr. Gear's daughters and you can jump right in. \n\n**Criticism:** At worst, BQ is handheld with little to no finesse, quickly devolving into a trope of a woman with daddy issues that grossly mishandles the emotional complexity of the idea of Gears and his daughter.\n\n**Another Thing:** xd Dr. Gear's daughter (self insert) fanfic goes here~\n\n**52 Responses**\n\n##white|OMG Step-me, I'm naked and and also 18 and we're home alone that's so wild - Caro##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Chaos Insurgency\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image ChaosGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 6.4\n**Usability:** 7.0\n**Peak Value:** 8.6\n**Pitfalls:** 3.9\n**Originality:** 5.8 \n\n**Praise:** Offers a good insight to rebellion against the Foundation and possible anomalous terror activity\n\n**Criticism:** At their best, they're Disney villains.

The only honest obstacle here is people needing to know the history to write them well.\n\n**Criticism:** People sometimes get the history bad. Like, really bad. Like, *absurdly* bad. Like, \"you sound like people writing really bad 'Untouchables' fanfiction\" bad.\n \n**Another Thing:** rookie said bi disaster rights babey!!!\n\n**49 Responses**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Church of the Broken God\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image BrokenGodGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 7.9\n**Usability:** 7.8\n**Peak Value:** 8.9\n**Pitfalls:** 4.7\n**Originality:** 8.0\n\n**Praise:** Simple motif (machine-worship and Gnostic concepts intertwine), has a good foil in the form of Sarkicism, and has a lot of room for exploration. Really easy to use.\n\n**Criticism:** On one hand, the idea behind the CotBG is incredibly cool (\"what if we had to make God ourselves?\" -- plus the aesthetic of perfection through artifice). But then there's the lore. The extensive, overwhelming, over-cooked lore. Seriously, it reads like a really bad fanfic of Robert Jordan's *Wheel of Time*. And *Wheel of Time* was *already* shit.\n \n**Another Thing:** who doesn't love a cult\n\n**69 Responses** ##white|:)##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Church of the Second Hytoth\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image HylothGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 3.9\n**Usability:** 5.9\n**Peak Value:** 6.9\n**Pitfalls:** 3.5\n**Originality:** 6.5\n\n**Praise:** They have a lot of potential I feel but I have yet to see THE article on them that makes me fall in love with them.\n\n**Criticism:** In my eyes, this does nothing to differentiate itself from Sarkicism in a meaningful way, and is pretty derivative of Fifthism as well. I literally thought that they were just a branch of Sarkicism until they got their own GOI hub.\n\n \n**Another Thing:** i know jack shit\n\n**44 Responses**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Deer College\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image DeerGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 3.4\n**Usability:** 5.1\n**Peak Value:** 5.9\n**Pitfalls:** 3.2\n**Originality:** 5.3\n\n**Praise:** There are so many great stories to be told about a magical college, especially one filled with anarchists in the city of Three Portlands.  The city has a wonderful abundance of open story threads and it's incredibly interesting to see what could be happening there.  There aren't that many stories about it yet, but I could really see it being a major player in the canon going forward.\n\n**Criticism:** Not well-defined, as of yet, and suffers from a similar problem to Anderson, existing within Three Portlands and Those Twisted Pines, which, again, are huge and insular.\n \n**Another Thing:** JKR notice me :3 *nuzzles* *gives the main character erectile dysfunction*\n\n**38 Responses**\n\n##white|JKR actually tweeted at me yesterday and told me I was in Slytherin and straight with dark brown hair with a streak red and I wore black fishnets and gave the finger to all the preps##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Doctor Wondertainment\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image WondertainmentGraph]]\n\n\n**Activity:** 8.1\n**Usability:** 8.2\n**Peak Value:** 8.6\n**Pitfalls:** 4.4\n**Originality:** 7.3\n\n**Praise:** Their whimsical toy creating nature is a great leap off point for people to be creative.

One of the biggest mistakes I see: Making it an actual GoI. As a group (with people, managers, leaders, etc), it loses a lot of its flexibility, and a lot of the depersonalization and inhumanity that makes it so potent.\n\n**Another Thing:** hungry boy.\n\n**55 Responses**\n\n##white|mmmmMMMM hungie boy?

I think it's a great GOI; a poor man's GOC (only Russian-based). The best parts of it are that 1) It's gone in modern day, 2) It evokes the mystique of the Cold War.\n\n**Criticism:** Needs more nuance and views rather than, \"For the Motherland\"\n\n**Another Thing:** stop giving countries new foundations\n\n\n**44 Responses**\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n++ Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Data [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide Data [-]\"]]\n\n= [[image FullerGraph]]\n\n**Activity:** 5.2\n**Usability:** 6.6\n**Peak Value:** 7.6\n**Pitfalls:** 4.2\n**Originality:** 6.7\n\n**Praise:** Thanks to Dr. Chandra and Dread and Circuses, it's fairly easy to get into their lore.\n\n\n**Criticism:** \"What if the circus, but anomalous?\" -- good idea.

That may be cartoonish, but it's no worse than what actual billionaires have done.\n\n**Another Thing:** Can be predictable, \"find a thing, sell/exploit the thing, watch it kill clients, mothball it\".

I also don't know what they mean with the ants, but I like Minecraft so go wild.##\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n----\n\nOnce again, a big thanks to everyone who filled out the survey. When we first put this together we thought we'd be lucky if we got fifty responses. Getting more than twice that amount has been a fantastic and wonderful surprise.\n\nAfter you get a chance to digest the results, we hope that you'll engage with other readers in the comments section to discuss and dissect the data. If this survey inspires a real conversation about the varied Groups of Interest that would make everyone involved with this project happy.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n[[include
