SCP-7710 is to be contained in a large biohazardous containment cell retrofitted for a large animal. Its cell is to be lined with common industrial plastic with imprinted thaumaturgic sigils. SRAs[[footnote]]Scranton Reality Anchor, stablizes local reality.[[/footnote]] are to be placed at the corners of the containment cell. Use of fire is approved in re-containing the anomaly.

The entity will take on the appearance of an extinct, extinct in the wild, or critically endangered species. Its current form is a black rhinoceros. SCP-7710 is three times the size of its non-anomalous counterparts. The anomaly's mass is made up of biohazardous and acidic slime; it has an exo-skeleton composed of oxidized iron and copper. At this time, no specific cause for SCP-7710's manifestation has been found.\n\nIn testing, SCP-7710 has been found to emit low levels of TRE.[[footnote]]Tartarean Resonance Energy.[[/footnote]] \n\n@@ @@\n**Addendum 7710.1**\n@@ @@\n\n__Email Logs 7710.1__\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**To:** Jr. Researcher Mordecai Ryder\n**From:** Head Researcher Leah Królik\n**Subject:** New Assignment\n**Date:** 2022/09/20\n**Time:** 08:41\n------\n\nGood morning Mordecai,\n\nI have some wonderful news for you!
