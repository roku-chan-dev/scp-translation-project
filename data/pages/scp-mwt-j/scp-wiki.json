Association online-network scanners are to tear down each and every sample of SCP-MWT-J, to the contrary, SCP-MWT-J samples have no end. Admission to SCP-MWT-J shall exclusively be assigned through the agency of one Grade 4/MWT-J researcher pertinent to experimentation. Human resources made vulnerable to SCP-MWT-J shall have Designation A amnestics delivered as soon as possible.\n\nNonsuccess to manage SCP-MWT-J will eventualize a θK-Class \"Association Disorganization\" scenario as the Association collapses by virtue of database and operations nonperformance as sentences and verbalizations become laborious and elongated.\n\n**Characterization:** SCP-MWT-J exists as the cognitohazardous online-network page //Thesaurus.com//. The online-network page's cognitohazardous ramifications materialize in consequence to a human being's inceptive examination. Influenced human beings are incompetent at scribing or verbalizing without uselessly obfuscating the contents through means of the online-network page.\n\n**Appendix MWT-J.1:** Supervisor Parliament Correspondence\n[[collapsible show=\"[SEGMENT REACHABLE EXCLUSIVELY BY SUPERVISOR MANADATE]\" hide=\"[ORIGINATING FROM THE DESK OF O5-1]\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThe Foundation is no stranger to falsifying files for the sake of information security. Hell, practically half of the database doesn't actually exist. We place warning signs and memetic kill agents in places where they shouldn't be so that the poor bastard who finds these files without the proper authorization is scared half to death before they could actually be terminated.\n\nThis isn't the case with MWT-J. The truth is: everyone can access MWT-J, it's included in general Level 0 access. MWT-J is not about some world ending anomaly, the containment procedures do not protect humanity. MWT-J doesn't even exist, the civilian sector uses it daily without problem. No, MWT-J's file exists for one sole reason:\n\n**So the new hires would stop using //Thesaurus.com// so goddamn much.**\n\n— O5-1\n\n//Secure. Contain. Protect.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/div]]",
