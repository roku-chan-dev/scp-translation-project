Though this constitutes a massive containment breach, he possesses such a deeply alluring voice that we simply cannot bear to take it down. _\n _\nYou can find SCP-AU's channel here: _ https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC20RZNGo9bliSyo25CQ0H4A ||\n[[include component:image-block name=weasel.png|caption= SCP-AU in repose. Nobody knows what the fuck that is behind him.|width=300px]]\n\n\n**Item #:** SCP-AU\n\n**Object Class:** I Can't Believe It's Not Contained!^^TM^^\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-AU is to be contained within its hovel behind the dumpster at the Arby's next to Site-19. It is to be fed pre-chewed Slim Jims every full moon, by personnel dressed as Richard Simmons. In order to lessen the psychological stress from interacting with SCP-AU, absolutely no verbal communication with the entity is authorized. [[footnote]] SCP-AU is a huge dick, and will make fun of your nasally voice. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-AU is a humanoid entity comprised entirely of weasels. Despite this, it believes itself to be a non-anomalous human, and will become aggressive if confronted about its appearance. SCP-AU believes it is a researcher at Site-19, and claims to have been involved with the initial containment of the following SCPs.\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"shaggydredlocks\" order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"scp\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ SCP Number ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Edited ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"s d locke\" order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"scp\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ SCP Number ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Edited ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% || %%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n**Addendum Uno:** SCP-AU has taken to writing what it refers to as 'Tales'. It does this by using feces collected from its constituent weasels. Several D-Class have been assigned to transcribe these stories, in order to gain information on SCP-AU.\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=created_by=\"shaggydredlocks\"  order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"tale\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Title ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Edited ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% ||%%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=created_by=\"s d locke\"  order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"tale\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Title ||~ Rating ||~ Comments ||~ Created ||~ Edited ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || %%comments%% || %%created_at%% ||%%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n**Addendumb**\n\nSCP-AU has somehow gotten its many, many tiny mitts on internal documentation from rival GOIs.
