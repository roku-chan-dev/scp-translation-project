One for the Marijuana Butter, the other for our delicious home made brownies. Of course, if you do not wish to partake in cannabis, you can substitute with regular butter.\n\nAs a lawyer, I must advise that you do not break the law. Obviously do not participate in cannabis if you are under age or if you live under a government that has cannabis as an illegal substance. Please use responsibly, and do not operate heavy machinery while under the influence. Please stay safe.\n\nAs some of you know, my wife Asita was a former member of the Wolves of St. Christopher, a Catholic special forces unit and death squad that operated both in official and clandestine capacities. Part of their training regimen involves a ritual they refer to as the 'Communion of Wolves`. The effects of the Communion on the psyche of these soldiers is drastic, resulting in violence, sex and religious ecstasy becoming strongly correlated with each other, as well as addiction and the suppression of empathy. Some of the damage done is irreparable, even if one no longer partakes in the ritual. The Wolves who have gone through the Communion are not allowed to see their families again. Astia told me they were only informed of that //after// they went through with it.\n\nLiving with the trauma caused by this practice is challenging, and perhaps worst of all, it brings strong social stigma that makes finding a career or a support network difficult. No drugs have been able to provide a cure to the procedure, but recovery and management is possible with intensive therapy and attention.\n\nWhether you wish to use this recipe recreationally, for helping you overcome an addiction, or are in a similar position to my wife, I hope this instructional finds you well this holiday season.\n\n+ Cannabutter Recipe:\n\n||~ Prep: ||~ Cook: ||~ Cool: ||\n|| 15 mins || 2 hours || 1 hour  ||\n\n||~ Amount: ||\n|| 1 stick, or 8 tablespoons||\n\n++ Ingredients:\n* 12 grams of marijuana\n* 8 tablespoons, or 1 stick, of butter\n* 1 cup of Water\n\n++ Tools needed:\n* Stovetop\n* Sink\n* Double boiler\n* Sheet of cheese cloth\n* Spool of cooking twine\n* Marijuana grinder\n* Pair of tongs\n* Bowl for butter\n* Strainer\n* Refrigerator\n\n++ Instructions:\n# Fill the bottom portion of the double boiler with water, set stovetop to High, and wait until boil.\n# Dice the butter into several cubes, for a quicker and more even melt.\n# Finely grind the bud of marijuana in your marijuana grinder.\n# Wrap your ground cannabis inside the cheese cloth. Use the cooking twine to tie the cloth into a wrap securely.\n# When water has boiled, place butter, 1 cup of water, and cannabis wrap in the top portion of the double boiler.\n# Leave stovetop on High, and let simmer for two hours. Be sure the double boiler does not run out of boiling water.\n# After two hours, remove the cannabis wrap from the double boiler. Use tools to squeeze the wrap and extract as much butter from inside as possible. Do NOT let the wrap become untied during this process.\n# Dispose of the wrap, and empty the contents of the double boiler into bowl.\n# Let bowl sit in fridge for 1 hour, or until butter has solidified. A green coloration is normal, and expected.\n# Remove bowl from fridge. CAREFULLY drain the bowl in the sink with the use of a strainer.\n# place the solidified butter back in the bowl, or a container of choice for later use.\n\nIt is important to note, you do not need to limit yourself to brownies. You can conceivably use Cannabutter with any recipe that utilizes butter as an ingredient.

Adding ½ a cup of ground, salted cashews into the batter is also acceptable.\n\n**Ansiel** prefers a small fruit salad alongside his brownies. Serving with side of sliced blood orange and strawberries has proven popular with him.\n\n**Astia** enjoys colorful foods. When preparing for her, use ½ a cup of M&Ms instead or in addition to of chocolate chips, and coat her ice-cream in jimmies.\n\n**Katz** is fine with most anything, except he prefers mint ice cream instead of vanilla.\n\n**Morningstar** prefers extra chocolate chips or M&Ms if Astia is present. DO NOT INCLUDE CANNABUTTER IN MORNINGSTAR'S!!! Use regular butter.\n\nI, **Primrose,** prefer 2 tablespoons of Cinnamon added to the mix.",
