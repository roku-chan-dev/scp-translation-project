Foundation agents are to amnesticize all individuals who have been directly or indirectly impacted by the anomaly after it has demanifested.  Pay records and bank accounts for affected individuals are to be artificially adjusted to conceal the effects of SCP-5698.\n\n-----\n++++ __Description__:\nSCP-5698 is the designation for a migrating multi-faceted pocket reality housing a consumer goods warehouse.  The anomaly manifests as part of a pre-existing warehouse space, overwriting local baseline reality for the period of time the anomaly is present.  Employees of the business being overwritten are folded into the manifestation, appearing as custodians and workers within SCP-5698.   The manifestation can last anywhere from two days to a month.  No known pattern has been discerned for SCP-5698’s manifestations.\n\nIn these few instances where the property is abandoned, any individuals within one hundred meters of the manifestation at the time of its first appearance will be encoded as employees, regardless of their relationship with the property.  \n\nIt is unclear what happens to the products stored within the business that is overwritten by SCP-5698.  After a manifestation fades, the business returns to its normal appearance and the affected individuals are left with faint memories of their time as employees of the warehouse.\n\n@@ @@\n**__Discovery__**:\nSCP-5698 was discovered on 31 March, 2014, when an abandoned warehouse in Creekside, Ohio[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Population is under five thousand individuals according to the 2010 United States Census.[[/span]] was taken over by the anomaly.  The property was less than thirty meters from the building that housed the local courthouse and Creekside City Hall.  All individuals working within this building were encoded into the rewriting of baseline reality to be employees of SCP-5698.  Mayor Maria Hoffman took on the role of shipping and receiving manager, and the Honorable Judge Jacob Fischer became the general manager of the property.  \n\nOn 2 April, 2014 police were called to the City Hall building as it was apparently abandoned and the reporting individual claimed the disappearance of the thirty-three county and city employees were due to “them damned Al-Qaeda hooligans.”  Creekside PD were called to the property housing SCP-5698 when Judge Fischer was observed in a short-sleeve button up shirt and wrinkled, grease-stained tie entering the building around 13:00 with a bag of fast food.\n\nIndividuals interviewed by Creekside PD were unaware that they had ever worked anywhere but SCP-5698.  \n\nEmbedded Foundation agents within the Ohio State Police received reports of this phenomenon and informed Site-43, which launched an investigation upon learning the specifics.  Police and witnesses were amnesticized. \n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"note\"]] \n[[=]]\n++++ __Addendum 5698-1__ \n– Record of Additional SCP-5698 Manifestations – \n[[/=]]\n* Thurber, Texas\n* Playas, New Mexico\n* Newry, South Carolina \n* Madrid, New Mexico \n* Elcor, Minnesota \n* Numa, Iowa \n* Terlingua, Texas \n* Kohler, Wisconsin[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]As more manifestations are discovered, they will be added to this file.[[/span]]  \n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #BBBBBB; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: 'Georgia'\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ __Addendum 5698-2__ \n– Recorded Interactions with Affected Individuals – \n[[/=]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"► Interview 5698-A – Maria Hoffman ◄\" hide=\"- Close File -\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date** – 2 April, 2014\n**Interviewer** – //Researcher Wettle//\n**Interview Subject** – //Former Mayor Maria Hoffman//\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/mayor%20maria%20weber| caption=SCP-5698 Shipping and Receiving Manager, Maria Hoffman.\n| width=300px]]\n\n**Wettle**: Someone told me you were the manager, that true?\n\n**Hoffman**: I’m the shipping-and-receiving manager.
