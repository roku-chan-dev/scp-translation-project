A set of clothes and a long lab coat have been tailor made to fit his rather unique anatomy and proportions. He is to remain in this form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to resume his Base Form.\n\n----\n\n**<Begin Log, 2021-06-06, 14:01 PST>**\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Hello, Dr. Rateleken! This is my first time interviewing a Therianthrope, so go easy on me.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** (//Laughs.//) Happy to have you visiting the Therianthropy Department, Gerry!\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Oh, well, thank you for using my first name.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Please, there's no need to be so formal around me. I find that formalities tend to hinder productivity. You can call me Atticus or Ace if you want.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Awesome! Also, it's really cool that you're able to move and stay upright in a form like that.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, well, I've gotten the hang of controlling the muscles in my snake torso in tandem with moving my legs. Standing in this form sorta makes me look like that one TMNT villain with the long torso... Drago...? Draco...? Something like that.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Oh my gosh, I think I remember that from my childhood!\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Ah, I see you are a man of culture as well.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken winks. Dr. Harkhart laughs.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Well, I don't think I'm quite ready to do kung fu in this body yet. Just being able to sit and stand upright is enough for now.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken adjusts himself in his seat, and winces as he feels his injuries. Dr. Harkhart stops laughing.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Are you okay?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Yeah, I'm fine. My injuries are already a lot better than they were three days ago.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** I thought Therianthropes could heal superficial wounds by shape-shifting.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I actually find this form rather interesting, and I want to commit to muscle memory first, so I can assume it in the future. The pain from my wounds has helped me to not accidentally shift back into my Base Form.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Wow, being a Therianthrope sure is interesting.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** You're always welcome to have that interesting experience for yourself.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken winks again. Dr. Harkhart chuckles nervously.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Well, maybe later, after you've managed to find a cure for SCP 6090 infection in humans. That's actually what I was supposed to ask in this interview: How has research into that been going?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Very well, actually! I'm thankful to have Dr. Eve Antleur assisting us in the Therianthropy Department. Despite how cold she can be, she is rather brilliant.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart chuckles again and rubs the back of his neck.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah, I've actually worked with her quite a bit. She can be a bit... distant, but after a while you get used to it.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, I'll have to take your word on that one.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah... Getting back on topic, I've heard that if you do create a viable cure, the higher-ups are considering reclassifying SCP-6090 from Keter to Thaumiel.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, probably because of the potential \"super soldier\" prospects. Personally, I'd think Cernunnos would be a better Containment Classification now. Even with a cure, we'll probably never locate every SCP-6090-A instance, and there are many SCP-6090-B instances who chose to become infected and would refuse it.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah, I can see how that would be an ethical and logistical nightmare that qualifies for Cernunnos. Still, from the amazing things I've learned about Therianthropes, they could be help the Foundation contain all sorts of anomalies.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, perhaps a new Containment Classification is in order then? A combination of Thaumiel and Cernunnos, perhaps?\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** SCP-6090 may be unique enough to warrant that. It would be so cool if I could help design the new Containment Classification!\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves here. We're still in the process of analyzing my venom, based on the rather interesting effect it had on Belette Le Fou(ine).\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** The entity that attacked the Foundation convoy and tried to kill all of you?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** That's the one! It turns out my venom has a lot of interesting properties. We've managed to isolate a cocktail of anomalous oils, toxins, and prions that appear to be derived from the conventional components of non-anomalous //Crotalus// venom. It seems my body naturally produces them.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Wow, that's so cool!\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I'll say! We've found that this organic chemical cocktail specifically targets not only the Therianthropy Virus itself, but also all of the structures within cells created by it that give us our abilities, while seeming to leave the rest of the cell and overall tissue intact and unharmed.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart suppresses a laugh.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Heh, so what you’re saying is that Therianthropy could actually cured by...\n\n(//A grin spreads across Dr. Rateleken's rattlesnake snout as he picks up on Dr. Harkhart's cue.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** That's right! Were-Rattlesnake Oil! It'll cure what ails ya!\n\n(//Both Dr. Rateleken and Dr. Harkhart burst out laughing.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Oh, Gerry, those rumors about you are so misfounded.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart stops laughing.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Wait, there are rumors about me?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Oh, it's mainly stuff I've been hearing from Eve.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Really?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** She's actually compared me to you a few times, so I'm actually glad I got to meet you myself.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart awkwardly rubs the back of his neck.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Heh, well, at least I'm glad to hear that she knows me well enough to mention me in conversations with others, even if in an unflattering way.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I can now see why she'd make those comparisons, and I can also see that she really doesn't have any sense of fun or humor.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart chuckles and sighs.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah, well, for all her faults, Dr. Antleur really is a good person at her core. It just takes a while to get there, you know?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I guess I just haven't spent enough time with her then. Her being a Reluctant Were-Deer probably isn't helping things either.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart looks down forlornly.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** I can only imagine how she's feeling right now.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Well, you could always ask her yourself. After all, don't you two work at the same Site most of the time?\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah, we do. We, Dr. Sawkingbark and I, actually came up here to check on how she and Agent Neilson are doing after Incident 6090-1. We'll be reporting things back to the higher-ups through the channels at our Site. Of course, Dr. Sawkingbark got the luck of the draw and will be interviewing both of them.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken smiles smugly and bends his long neck down to rest his snake head on top of his interlocked hands while looking up at Dr. Harkhart.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** And you got stuck with me.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart leans back in shock and laughs nervously.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Not that that's a bad thing! I love getting to interview you.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken chuckles and returns his head to a more normal position.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I'll take your word on that too, Gerry. And anyway, you really don't need a formal interview as an excuse to talk with her.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart rubs the back of his neck.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Yeah, well...\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken frowns.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Hmmm, yeah, I suppose with someone like her, you probably do need something more official to break her rather thick ice shell.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken smiles.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Though I suppose I could arrange something. After all, you're both visiting the Therianthropy Department now, a Department I'll soon be leading here at Site-64.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart's face brightens with excitement.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Oh, I've heard! Congratulations on the promotion!\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, thank you, though I've been working towards it for a while now, as well as working up the courage to become a Therianthrope myself. Not only have I become one now, but I've also become the main source for the cure. Given all of that, I'd say my promotion is well deserved, wouldn't you?\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Definitely!\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I'm glad you agree, though a few of the other Therianthropy Researchers are still a little sour that I passed them over for it. They'll just have to deal with it, along with the changes I plan on making to whip this place into shape and make it more productive.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken chuckles and winks. Dr. Harkhart laughs along with him.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Well, I'm sure you’d be a lot more fun to work under than my Supervisor.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Oh, I definitely plan on being a fun yet firm Department Head, but we're getting off topic. Did you have any other questions for me, Gerry?\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Oh, right! So, uh, Dr. Rateleken... umm, Atticus, have you been experiencing any negative side-effects from SCP-6090 infection?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** This intermediate form has taken some getting used to, but other than that, not really.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Great to hear! Any unusual compulsions or weird dreams?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Heh, I've actually been craving higher temperatures. I might not be cold-blooded in this form or my Base Form, but it still doesn't stop me from wanting to seek out warmth.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken points at the pits on the sides of his muzzle, just behind his nostrils.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I can even sense heat now to seek it out, whether it's body heat, computer heat, or any other heat source.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Wow, that's so cool! So you're like the Predator now?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Nothing like that, thank the Gods. Augmented vision I can never turn off would probably drive me insane after a while.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Then how does it work?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Like a literal 6th sense, a form of intuition. It's sort of like when you feel like someone's watching you.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Really?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** That's the best way I can describe it, only in my case I'd likely be able to quickly find the hiding spot of whoever's watching me.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** I'll admit, being a Therianthrope does have its perks.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Again, you're welcome to join us any time.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Not gonna lie, it's something to think about in the future. Still, I'm not sure about not looking like myself anymore.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** That's okay. It took me years, and even now I still needed a dangerous situation to finally push me over the edge.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Anyway, speaking of Reluctant Therianthropes, I unfortunately have to ask you about your thoughts on Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B Instance 4342.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I honestly wouldn't worry too much about her. I've brushed up on the abilities of [[[SCP-3577]]] instances, and I personally think the rest of the Foundation is making a mountain out of molehill in her case.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** And her threat to commit suicide before escaping?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** She honestly didn't seem like the suicidal type to me, though all Reluctant Therians tend to go through a difficult time after infection. Compound that with what COVID-19 has forced us all to go through, and the prospect of containment would wear on anyone's sanity.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** And that really doesn't concern you?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** In the long term: No, it doesn't. I might not have gotten to know her as well as the others, but she hardly strikes me as the \"Child God\" type, both personality-wise and power-wise.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** But in the short term?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I'd rather we take a wait-and-see approach. Locate her, but don't contain her. Observe her from afar. The Foundation is certainly capable of that, even if it does come with a higher price tag and more logistical overhead than immediate containment. I personally feel it would be the better option in her case.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** And when she's exposed to her first full moon? I've heard that can be a real problem for new Therianthropes.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Hope she's found support by then, and if she hasn't, or if she's one of the unlucky violent ones, intervene and contain her. The same applies if she breaks the Veil, which will certainly make finding her easier, or if she does, in fact, attempt suicide. But again, I don't think that's likely.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Are you sure that's a wise decision?\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** I may also be a new Therian who hasn't experienced a full moon yet, but I can assure you that I have far more experience with Therianthropy than anyone else here, just not first-hand experience. \n\n(//Dr. Rateleken gestures to his long torso.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** However, I've been given the rare privilege to get first-hand experience with an intermediate form right off the bat. That should more than make up for it. I'll use my new power to try to sway the higher-ups towards my plan.\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Well, good luck with that. Believe me, I know how difficult that can be sometimes.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken smiles smugly.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** You know, if you hate your boss that much, you can always put in for a transfer to my Site's Therianthropy Department, and work under me.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken winks.//)\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** And if you want to truly join us, we could even make your own SCP-6090 infection go smoothly and painlessly, and you could pick any species you want, even an anomalous one... within reason.\n\n(//Dr. Harkhart laughs nervously and starts to get up out of his seat.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** A kind offer, but I'll stick with my current position for now. Honestly, I was lucky to get it this early in my Foundation career.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Whatever you say, but my door's always open if you change your mind.\n\n(//Dr. Rateleken and Dr. Harkhart share a chuckle.//)\n\n**Dr. Harkhart:** Anyway, I think I have all the info I need for now.\n\n**Dr. Rateleken:** Thanks for the interview! I look forward to the next one.\n\n**<End Log, 2021-06-06, 14:07 PST>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 6090-1C: Dr. Dalton Debriefing\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr. Bardolph Dalton, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions Employee\nInstance SCP-6090-B-863, ISS: //Canis lupus//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Gray Wolf.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Ralph Moreau Bouruson, Foundation Therianthropy Researcher, Level 3\nInstance SCP-6090-B-1234, ISS: //Ursus maritimus//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Polar Bear.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Note:** Dr. Moreau is in his Base Form. Dr. Dalton is still in his Feral Form, and will be required to stay in that form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to resume his Base Form.\n\n----\n\n**<Begin Log, 2021-06-07, 11:03 PST>**\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Greetings, Dr. Bardolph Dalton, SCP-6090-B Instance 963.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** And hello to you, Dr. Ralph Bouruson, SCP-6090-B Instance... 1234, if I recall correctly.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton chuckles. Dr. Moreau growls.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Yes, that is my own Therianthrope Instance Number, but I prefer to go by Dr. Moreau.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Ah, that's right. Bet you're thrilled Ace passed you over for Therianthropy Department Director.\n\n(//Dr. Moreau growls louder.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Dr. Rateleken is merely the interim director until his reaction to full moonlight is assessed.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Well, from what I've heard, your reaction sets the bar pretty low.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton winks. Dr. Moreau clears his throat with a growl.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Let's not stray from the topics of this interview, shall we?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** No worries. What do you wanna know?\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** First of all, I trust you have been recuperating well?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Heh, no thanks to your cold-handed veterinarians. I can only imagine how they treat animals who can't communicate with them. I still wish you'd let some W.W.S. vets take a look at me.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I assure you, Dr. Dalton, the veterinarians assigned to Site-64 are among the best the Foundation, and even the world, has to offer. You're in capable hands for as long as you'll be staying with us, and the fact that you can communicate makes them even more capable of helping you.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** More like cold and rough hands, but hopefully that stay won't be much longer. \n\n(//Dr. Dalton smirks smugly.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** And as for their capabilities, feel free to compare the results of our vets with yours on any number of anomalous critters we've had to handle together.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton winks and Dr. Moreau rolls his eyes.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Even after your stay here ends, I trust you understand that you'll have to remain in your Feral Form until your full convalescence, despite the inconveniences of that.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Maybe it's an inconvenience for you, given how massive your Feral Form must be, but for me, it's normal life. I actually spend more time in this form than I do in my Base Form. No worries.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Good. I'm glad we have an understanding on that front. Now I need to ensure that we also have an understanding regarding Person of Interest 6090-4342, Sandra Collins, SCP-6090-B Instance 4342.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton's ears droop and he whimpers sadly.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I sincerely hope you understand the full weight of your situation in regards to her. It's still inconclusive whether you deliberately did anything to aid in her escape from containment, even after thorough analysis of all records of Incident 6090-1. However, your overall attitude towards her does raise our suspicions, but I'm giving you a chance to alleviate them.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Look, you don't need to worry abou--\n\n(//Dr. Moreau loudly clears his throat with a bear growl and raises his hand in a stopping gesture.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Dr. Dalton, please refrain from speaking out of turn. I'll ask the questions, and you'll answer them. Understood?\n\n(//Dr. Dalton whines and slowly nods his head.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Good boy. Now, at any point during Incident 6090-1, did you intend to aid PoI 6090-4342 in any way that would go against the Foundation's intentions for her?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** No, not at all. You're our Supervisors, and your word is final.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** It's good you understand your place and the place of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions. Would you care to explain your negative attitude towards Dr. Antleur when she was explaining this to you during the Incident?\n\n(//Dr. Dalton growls softly.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Just because we have to obey your commands, doesn't mean we still don't like them, or even agree with them sometimes. I'll be frank: Sometimes you Supervisors don't know what you're doing, especially when it comes to dealing with anomalous animals.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton chuckles and smirks.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Like I said earlier, I think the record of W.W.S. compared to yours speaks for itself in that regard. Still, often you all still insist on learning that the hard way.\n\n(//Dr. Moreau loudly scoffs with a guttural growl.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Be that as it may, I trust you will obey all of our commands when it comes to actions towards PoI 6090-4342. Do we make ourselves clear?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Clear as day, Dr. Moreau. I have no intention of going against the Foundation.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Good. Again, just to be clear, do you have any intention of aiding PoI 6090-4342 in continuing to evade Foundation containment?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** No, I don't. I'll say this again and again, but I hope you won't make me say it too many times more. It's still a might difficult for me to speak.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I am well aware of the state of your ribs, Dr. Dalton, but not so much your state of mind. Still, I will try to keep this brief.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Do you still intend to communicate with her in any way?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** No, not unless she reaches out to me.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** And I trust you are aware that we will be monitoring //ALL// of your communications for the next 15 months or until PoI 6090-4342 is successfully contained, correct?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Yeah, I figured you'd be doing as much. No worries.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** And if she attempts to contact you?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I'll record the whole thing, do my best to convince her to turn herself in, and pass it on to you guys.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Recording it and contacting us won't be necessary, since we will be monitoring all of your communications in real time, but it's good that you still offered.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Heh, you guys really don't skip a beat, do you? And for 15 months? Color me impressed.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** It's what we typically do when handling cases like this, Dr. Dalton, though it's actually easier for us in your case, since we already monitor all communications going through the Veil of Secrecy to an extent. We'll just be scrutinizing yours a little more closely for a while.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Still impressive. It's one of the reasons why I know it would be stupid to go against the Foundation in any way.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I'm glad you feel that way, Dr. Dalton. And finally, what is your overall opinion towards PoI 6090-4342? Particularly, how to do feel about her threat to commit suicide if we should come close to containing her?\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** (//Sighs.//) Can you really blame me for still feeling sorry for that poor girl, especially after that final threat of hers? Can you blame me for disliking and disagreeing with your intentions to contain and study her for //years// in a dull and sterile lab?\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Dr. Dalton, despite appearances, I can assure you that the Foundation does take the mental well-being of sentient and sapient anomalous entities very seriously, especially if they threaten suicide. I'll remind you that we do, in fact, have an Ethics Committee that dictates how we may treat such entities.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Heh, it can be really hard to believe that sometimes, Dr. Moreau, especially since we at W.W.S. often get a front row seat to how your organization treats \"anomalous entities\" capable of feeling pain. Still, at least you are better than the G.O.C.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton looks down, folds back his ears and growls.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** If I ever have to deal with those bloody bastards again in my lifetime, it'll be too soon.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Then I'd advise you to always keep that in mind too, Dr. Dalton. Despite what you might think of how we treat anomalous animals and humanoids, always remember how they're treated by the Global Occult Coalition, by Marshall, Carter, & Dark, and by many of the other less savory Groups of Interest.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton shuts his eyes and growls louder.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Need also I remind you of what Are We Cool Yet did to those platypi and kiwis for the sake of that \"Art from Down-Under\" exhibition of theirs? Much more cruel than cool, if you ask me.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Those finger-painting hacks...\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Never forget, we are the ones who assist your organization in rescuing animals from those organizations. Our only intentions are to securely contain and study the anomalous ones, which is much better than the fate that would befall them otherwise. Wouldn't you agree?\n\n(//Dr. Dalton stops growling, sniffles, and looks up.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** And the same goes for Ms. Sandra Collins. We don't fully understand the extent of her powers. Even if she proves to be less powerful than we think she is, she still has power now. You've witnessed that power with your own eyes.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton nods and wipes his nose with his forepaw.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Think of how these other groups would exploit those powers. Do you want her killed by the G.O.C.? Trafficked by M.C.&.D.? Made into \"art\" of some kind by A.W.C.Y.? I could go on, but I think you get the point by now.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Yeah, I do. Granted, some might treat her differently since she started as human, but I don't want to take that risk.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I know you ultimately want her to be able to live a normal life, but she isn't normal anymore, even by Therianthrope standards.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Just promise me something.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** I cannot make promises on behalf of the Foundation, but depending on your request, I'll see what I can do.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I've heard from Ace... from Dr. Rateleken, that they've got a cure for Therianthropy in the works. Promise me that once you're done studying her, even if that takes years, you'll cure her and amnesticize her, so that she can live a normal life.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** You know I can't promise that.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton whines, stands up in his chair and leans forward with a pleading expression.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Can't you just infect another time-hopping coyote, another SCP-3577 instance, with the Were-Virus, then infect another person who's actually willing to subject themselves to your experiments?\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** We will take that into consideration, but we would only be able to release Ms. Collins after confirming her abilities are able to be at least adequately, if not exactly, replicated in other subjects. Even under controlled conditions, cross-testing anomalies is often a logistical and bureaucratic nightmare, so even creating more like her for the sake of sparing her from our experiments would be a tall order.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton sits back down, looks down and whimpers.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I understand. It's just... she didn't deserve this. She didn't ask for this.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Reality Benders rarely ever do. However, our job now is to contain her before even more innocent civilians end up with something they didn't deserve or ask for. Keep this in mind too: What do you think will happen if we fail to contain her before the next full moon?\n\n(//Dr. Dalton looks up and whines.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** She has had no training or support on how to handle herself should she be exposed, and given her current situation, exposure is very likely. You and some of the other Therians who accompanied you might have given her some advice in passing, but I think we both know that won't be enough.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I know you're right there, but I didn't want to think about that.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** And this is why you need to set your emotions aside and analyze the situation logically. You may see us as cold, but that's what we do, and it should be obvious now we have greater insight into the situation because of that.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton nervously shifts in his chair and his tail tucks between his legs.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Almost all new Therianthropes need to undergo at least one controlled and closely supervised exposure to full moonlight, to assess how it affects them and whether any medication or even physical restraint is necessary. For most, it's a subtle compulsion, but for some, it's much stronger. You know I'm right.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton looks down and whimpers.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** If I recall correctly, due to the unusual circumstances of her SCP 6090 infection, she doesn't even remember it, so she doesn't even have that experience to help control herself. She's a complete wildcard, and when that's potentially coupled with her retroactive reality bending abilities...\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Yeah, I see where you're going with this.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Then you can see why it's critical we contain her within the next fortnight.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** She didn't really seem like the type that'd get violent under the full moon.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** For everyone's sake, I hope you're right. If she does turn violent, it will make containing her alive much more difficult, but at least it will make locating her a lot easier.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton looks up and whimpers.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Speaking of which, we may need to call on you directly to assist us with that. You are the most familiar with her behaviors, and more importantly, her scent.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Can't you just get other dogs and Canine Therians to sniff any of her clothes you've nabbed? She did leave her shoes behind, after all.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Sure, we've already recovered her personal effects, but their scent won't be as strong and familiar, and they don't know her like you do.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton softly growls.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I don't think her seeing me helping you guys out would do us any good.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Who says she has to see any Foundation Agents? If you were to, say, confront her alone, give her the right disinformation, and lead her into a trap we set...\n\n(//Dr. Dalton growls louder.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** You cheeky bastards really have already planned all of this out.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Again, Dr. Dalton, before your emotions get the better of you and you begin reassessing your loyalties, keep in mind everything we've discussed here. This is ultimately the best option for her at this point, and hopefully we can find her before another GoI does, and before the next full moon.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton stops growling and sighs.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** I know. And if you do end up having to use me as bait, it won't stop me from hating every minute of it.\n\n(//Dr. Dalton huffs and smirks.//)\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** And who's to say I wouldn't botch being bait because I'm as \"over-emotional\" as you say?\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Oh, don't sell yourself short, Dr. Dalton... or should I say \"Bard the Wonder Wolf\" of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions?\n\n(//Dr. Moreau smugly smiles. Dr. Dalton frowns and glares at him.//)\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** Oh, the children so do enjoy those little educational shows you put on for them. You're the \"most life-like special effect\" their parents have ever seen. I'd hate for those shows to have to stop because we've reassessed their risk to maintaining the Veil of Secrecy.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Entertaining kids is a lot different from lying to adults.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** It doesn't change the fact that you do have acting experience, which we will utilize if necessary. Consider yourself on standby, on top of being monitored.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** (//Growls.//) Are we done here?\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** We are for now, Dr. Dalton.\n\n**Dr. Dalton:** Good. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll return to that cold little \"containment unit\" you Foundation folk consider a luxury accomodation for VIPs like me.\n\n**Dr. Moreau:** You're excused, Dr. Dalton. This interview is now over.\n\n**<End Log, 2021-06-07, 11:17 PST>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 6090-1D: Dr. Antleur Debriefing\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr. Evelynn Antleur, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4343, ISS: //Dama Dama//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Fallow Deer.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Elizabeth Sawkingbark, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3\n\n**Note:** Dr. Antleur is in her Base Form, and will be required to stay in that form until such time that she has fully recovered from her injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to shape-shift.\n\n----\n\n**<Begin Log, 2021-06-08, 13:01 PST>**\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Wow, Dr. Antleur. I never thought I'd be interviewing you. How've you been holding up?\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Better than expected, considering I'm now an SCP-6090-B instance with a twisted ankle.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Aww, I think you look cute as a fallow doe. At least they managed to find you a matching wig.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Admittedly, it does help me feel more human. Still, let's try to keep this interview professional, Dr. Sawkingbark.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** (//Clears throat.//) Right. So, Dr. Antleur, have you experienced any adverse effects from becoming infected?\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Aside from no longer looking like myself, not really.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** No unusual dreams or daytime compulsions?\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Possibly an increased desire to be outside, in habitats natural to //Dama dama//, but other than that, nothing noticeable. Right now, I have a much greater desire to develop and test a functional cure with Dr. Rateleken.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I know you want to go back to your old self, Dr. Antleur, but you need full convalescence first.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** I am well aware of the potential risks of being cured during my ankle's recuperation, Dr. Sawkingbark, but judging by your expression, there's more to this than that.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well...\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Get on with it, Dr. Sawkingbark.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** The higher ups want to test the physical enhancements of Cervine Therianthropes.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** And why did they not inform me of this directly?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** They wanted to assess your reaction to the news in the interview.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** (//Sighs.//) And they can't just use D-Class infected with the //Dama dama// Variant derived from my blood?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well, they will be using D-Class, but having a Researcher as a test subject is quite a bonus for any SCP experiment.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Yes, I suppose it is. What are the details of these tests?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Basically physical stuff, to test your agility and jumping abilities, as well as your vision and other senses.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Anything else?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** They also want to perform a psychological evaluation during a full moon exposure.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** (//Sarcastically.//) I'm sure that will be riveting.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** But the good news is that after all that, you'll be given the cure, so that they can compare, and you'll assist them in monitoring yourself for any side-effects from it, or lingering effects from SCP-6090 infection.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** If it gets me back to being human as soon as possible, I'll submit to whatever tests are deemed necessary.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur pauses to feel her face.//)\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** I have to admit that becoming an SCP-6090-B instance has piqued my personal curiosity.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** See, now that's the spirit! And again, you do look cute as a deer.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur smiles.//)\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** If you find my appearance so appealing, you're always welcome to infect yourself with the //Dama dama// Variant and join me. Then we could have two Researchers as test subjects.\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark laughs nervously.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I'm not ready to make a commitment like that just yet.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** I thought as much. Now, is there anything else to discuss or questions to answer?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well, regarding Sandra Collins...\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** I actually need to go check for any updates on the status of PoI 6090-4342.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur starts reaching for her crutch.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Dr. Antleur, you really shouldn't get too hung up on her.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** On the contrary, Dr. Sawkingbark, you and the rest of the Foundation should be just as concerned about her as I am.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** The proper departments are handling her case now, Dr. Antleur.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** They obviously aren't handling it well enough, since she hasn't been apprehended yet.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur strains to get out of her seat and stand with her crutch.//)\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** We have proof from a third copy of her backpack's Contents Manifest paperwork that she indeed used [[[SCP-3577]]]'s powers to obtain the Lewis & Clark Compass from CSR-07, a powerful anomalous artifact she could use to further evade containment.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well, that is true, but I've been told that counter-measures are already being taken against that.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur hobbles over to Dr. Sawkingbark's side of the interview table and stands over her.//)\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** And what about her retroactive reality altering abilities? She has also since altered the past to make \"emergency\" withdrawals from her bank accounts in early 2021, long before the Foundation froze them.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** With all due respect, Dr. Antleur, from what we know about SCP-3577, her powers are actually rather limited, and we've dealt with more powerful containment breaches before.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur stares down Dr. Sawkingbark.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Why are you so obsessed with her? Is it because she threatened suicide before escaping?\n\n(//Dr. Antleur looks down and sighs.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** It's okay, Eve... uhh, Dr. Antleur. That concerns me too.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** No, it was... something else she said before escaping.\n\n(//Dr. Antleur leans over as much as her crutch will allow and looks Dr. Sawkingbark in the eyes.//)\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Tell me, Dr. Sawkingbark. Do you think we hurt people here?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** That's a bit of a loaded question, given what the Foundation sometimes has to do to Secure and Contain, but it's always to Protect humanity.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Do you think I've ever hurt anyone?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well... sometimes you could try to be just a little friendlier, especially when dealing with humanoid skips.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** Have I ever hurt you, Lizzy?!\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** No, Eve, never! You're my friend! Sure, sometimes you're cold, but you've never been cruel.\n\n**Dr. Antleur:** (//Sighs.//) Thank you, Lizzy. I needed to hear that.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Anytime, Eve. I'm always here for you, no matter what you look like.\n\n**<End Log, 2021-06-08, 13:05 PST>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Interview Log 6090-1E: CSR-05 Debriefing\" hide=\"- Close Document\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Convoy Security Retinue, Guard Five, Agent Terrance Neilson\nInstance SCP-6090-B-4345, ISS: //Bos taurus//[[footnote]]Infection Source Species: Longhorn Bull.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Elizabeth Sawkingbark, Foundation General Researcher, Level 3\n\n**Note:** Agent Neilson is in his Base Form and will be required to stay in that form until such time that he has fully recovered from his injuries sustained during Incident 6090-1 and is cleared to shape-shift.\n\n----\n\n**<Begin Log, 2021-06-10, 10:04 PST>**\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Terrance! I'm so glad they're finally letting me interview you.\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark hugs Agent Neilson.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Heh, not much of a choice, since I've been laid up for a week with my injuries.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I really hope you're doing better now.\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark ends the hug and steps back.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** A lot better, though I'm still a minotaur.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well, you make a very good looking min-- err, Bovine Therianthrope.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Hopefully I won't be one for much longer, if what I've heard is true.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Yeah, about that...\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark looks forlornly at the floor.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** We have been seeing positive results with the SCP-6090 Cure derived from Dr. Rateleken's venom.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** But...\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** (//Sighs.//) The higher ups wanted me to be the one to tell you that you will be rotated through a few M.T.F.s and missions, on a 3 month trial basis, in order to assess the capabilities of a Bovine Therianthrope Field Agent.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Yeah, I was starting to figure something was up. This ain't just about me recovering from my injuries.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Yes, you'll also have to spend another month healing up before the trial period even begins.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** And then they'll probably move on to making it permanent.\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark looks up and rapidly waves her hands.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** No, no, Terrance, of course not. In fact, now that we have a working cure for SCP-6090-B instances, the higher ups are considering reclassifying SCP-6090 as Thaumiel. It could be used to create specialized agents, and cure them when they want or need to be human again.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** And so they're using me as a test subject.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** But they've assured me you'll be cured after the trial ends! After all, with your record, you'd be better for missions that need you to look, well... human.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Heh, I really hope that's the case. Still, this isn't the worst thing to happen to me working for the Foundation.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I guess this means we'll have to cancel our plans for a while.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Nonsense! I've been looking into some places in Three Portlands we can visit. After all, I'm going to have to live there for as long as the Foundation wants to keep me looking like this.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** You know, I've actually been meaning to visit that place for a while now.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Great, it's all working out then! Anyway, isn't this supposed to be an interview?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** You're right. (//Clears Throat.//) Agent Neilson, please explain why you were M.I.A. during the attack on the convoy by the entity Belette Le Fou(ine).\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Just before it happened, I went back from the truck into the groom area of the L.A.A.T. Trailer to check on the SCP-6090-A instances, since they seemed to be getting riled up by something. Then the ride gets bumpy, the trailer starts pitching like it's in river rapids, a whole steer slams into me and everything goes black.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And after that?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** I awoke to the sound of the gunfire, so I knew shit had already gotten bad. I felt weird and there was a whole steer on top of me. I'm lucky parts of the trailer stopped it from crushing me. Getting it off me seemed easier than it should have been. Don't get me wrong, it was still like moving a mattress, but not that difficult.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And why did you fail to make contact with the rest of Convoy Security Retinue after freeing yourself?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** My radio was damaged in the wreck, and I wasn't sure how injured I was. Then I got a glimpse of my reflection.\n\n(//Agent Neilson reaches up and feels his face.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** I was scared they'd mistake me as another hostile, so I decided to hang back and see how I could aid from afar so they'd know who I was. I poked my head out as much as I could while trying to keep these damn oversized horns hidden.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And what did you see?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** A complete cluster fuck. That //thing// picking off my teammates one by one, flying through the air, and casually strolling through a barrage of Minigun rounds.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** So what did you do to try to render aid?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** At first, I wasn't sure what I could do. I figured if I went out there, I'd be a goner like the rest. Then I started to recognize how it was cheating: Kinetohazards.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Could you explain more about your prior knowledge of Kinetohazards?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Well, I first learned about them from the intel on [[[SCP-1730|that incident with Site-13]]]. If something's powerful enough to give even Tau-5 a run for their money, it's worth studying.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** How were you able to recognize the ones Belette Le Fou(ine) was using?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** They got pretty huge and recognizable when it started using them to block the Gauss rounds. I got to work writing out the Antikinetoglyphs with the steer's blood, on fabric I pulled from my dead partner's uniform. Took quite a few tries before I had them written right.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And why didn't you use it on Belette Le Fou(ine) right there?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Didn't get a good opening. I was left with only one ribbon tied around a piece of steel I'd salvaged from the truck, and I knew I had to be close to use it. By the time I'd finished, it'd already finished killing my team and scaring off the civilians. It walked over to the first trailer and started trying to put out the battery fire.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I'm no soldier, but that seems like a good opening to me.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Believe me, I thought so too, but that damn entity was hypervigilant. It kept looking around in frustration with each failure to snuff that fire. It was all I could do to keep hidden whenever it looked my way, since I had a freaking chandelier on my head.\n\n(//Agent Neilson grabs both his horns and swings his arms off them.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** I didn't even have a working gun on me, since both mine and my partner's had gotten buried in the wreck. Shame, since I could have blinded it with its own Kinetoglyphs like the others thought to do.\n\n(//Agent Neilson closes his eyes, tightens his grip on his horns and twists his hands in frustration.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Still, I sat there for a solid 10 minutes, waiting for a good chance. I still regret not taking one.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Don't say that, Terr-- Agent Neilson! You made the right decisions in the end and managed to save everyone as a result. I won't judge you like others would.\n\n(//Agent Neilson sighs, opens his eyes, releases his grip and drops his arms.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Well, you're probably biased in that regard, so I'm lucky I got you as an interviewer.\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark and Agent Neilson both chuckle.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Anyway, I still silently cursed up a storm when it finally succeeded and flew off into the forest. After kicking myself, I decided to thoroughly prepare to face off against it and make the opening I didn't get earlier.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And what did you do to prepare?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Double-checked the Antikinetoglyphs, gathered up as many working guns and unempty mags as I could, and even modified a visor to fit around my new head, in case that thing had cognitohazards up its sleeves too. I also had a theory I wanted to test.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** The one you announced when you came in guns blazing, about Belette Le Fou(ine) feeling the forest's pain?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** That's the one! I first noticed it double-over in pain when it deflected a Gauss round that felled a few trees. I couldn't be sure though, since it might have just been the fresh pain from those two lucky shots, combined with the effort it clearly took to cast Kinetohazards with just one arm.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** And you did that rather bold pronouncement on just a theory?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** My original plan was to just get it within my sights while staying hidden, fire on a tree, and see how it reacted, then play it by ear from there.\n\n(//Agent Neilson tugs on one of his ears.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Probably not much better than what I did end up doing, all things considered. Unfortunately, when I finally found Belette Le Fou(ine), it was trying to blind that poor girl, and was probably about to torture the rest of them too.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** So you decided to use yourself as a distraction?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Pretty much. As crazy as that was, my hunch paid off and it all worked out in the end.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Yes, once again, everything worked out, despite you being so stubborn, so...\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark's eyes widen and she stifles a laugh.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** So... (//Giggles.//) Bull-Headed...\n\n(//Dr. Sawkingbark and Agent Neilson burst out laughing.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Quite literally now!\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Anyway. (//Clears throat.//) That does it regarding the incident. I just have a few more questions.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Sure, go ahead.\n\n(//Agent Neilson points at his head. Dr. Sawkingbark giggles and clears her throat again.//)\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Have you experienced any unusual dreams or daytime compulsions since becoming a Therianthrope?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Heh, aside from cravings for wheatgrass smoothies, not really.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** (//Laughs.//) Are you just joking right now, Terrance?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** No, I'm serious. Vegan diet's been looking a lot more appealing lately.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Huh, that's interesting. Hopefully you've been looking into the right Portlands restaurants then. (//Winks.//)\n\n**Agent Neilson:** You bet I have! Honestly, even after I get cured, I'm not sure I'll ever be able to eat a burger again. Not after having been one.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Don't say that! There's always those impossible burgers.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** You're right. I guess that's an option now. Anyway, anything else?\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Well, I need to know your thoughts on Sandra Collins.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** (//Sighs.//) A poor, desperate girl. Not the first time I've dealt with a runner, and likely not the last. We see it a lot with nascent reality benders we're forced to contain.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** So her escape hasn't affected you, then? Or her threat of suicide?\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Not really. Hopefully we can find her while she's still sane enough to be talked down, before her abilities wipe away that sanity.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** Thank you, Agent Neilson.\n\n**Agent Neilson:** Anytime, Dr. Sawkingbark. Hopefully we can have more interviews in the future.\n\n**Dr. Sawkingbark:** I hope so too! And if not, I'm always here for you anyway, Terrance.\n\n**<End Log, 2021-06-10, 10:15 PST>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
