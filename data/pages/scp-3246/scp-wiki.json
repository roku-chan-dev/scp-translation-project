Such precedent is to be referenced for all materials fabricated herein.\n\nPersonnel have been issued military-grade 600-Fluoren flashlights in the case of a power outage or SCP-3246 outbreak. To limit this possibility, backup generators in all containment sites are regularly monitored. Floodlights must be kept on in major population areas at all times. Over the next few weeks, Foundation teams will work to evacuate all residences within 25 miles of any forest or ocean. \n\nDo not linger in shadows.\n\n-----\n**Description:** SCP-3246 is an extant component of ordinary darkness. While much of the makeup of darkness is derived from an absence of light, the portion that is SCP-3246 would be more accurately described as \"negative light\".\n\nAs its brightness decreases, non-anomalous darkness asymptotically approaches 0.001890 kiloFluorens per meter squared (kF/m^^2^^), the approximate brightness of \"Pitch Black\". However, darkness with a high enough concentration of SCP-3246 can extend far below this, rendering the current light scale obsolete.\n\nAs of writing this document, approximately 36% of the darkness on Earth is SCP-3246.\n\n-----\n\n\n||~ Brightness (kF/m^^2^^) ||~ Scale Degree ||~ Notes ||\n|| >1 || Light || Most surfaces are visible and unambiguous. The only thing short of obfuscation that hinders visibility at this light level is distance. || \n|| 0.999999-0.001891 || Dark || Surfaces begin to lose vibrancy and become desaturated. As the brightness decreases, smaller details and textures begin to fade into the background. Cameras stop being able to pick up an image at around ~0.005 kF/m^^2^^. || \n|| 0.001890 || Pitch Black || Total absence of light on the visible spectrum. This is the cutoff for detection with the naked eye. || \n|| 0 || True Black || Total absence of all light. True Black is described as \"cold\" and \"quiet\" by observers. Light traveling through True Blackness experiences no decrease in luminosity as it does so; on a spherical planet that is entirely True Black, shining a flashlight ahead of oneself would illuminate the flashlight-holder's posterior. || \n|| -0.001890 || Nanoblack || Below zero kiloFluorens, light particles begin to exhibit strange behaviors. At this value, organic lifeforms, including humans, emit a faint but noticeable glow, which is immediately swallowed up by the increasingly oppressive darkness. It can be easy to experience minor auditory illusions of distance as depth perception vanishes with the light. || \n|| -0.068584 || Haever-Bandon Black || Studies in REM sleep cycles posit that the \"color\" we see when we are asleep is approximately equivalent to Haever-Bandon Black, a conclusion which was also met by Greek philosopher Haeveritres in 376 BC[[footnote]]Ortygiatis, Haeveritres. //Unconscious Gods//. Translated by Werner Kaufler, Dover Publications, 1974.[[/footnote]]. Areas unlit at Haever-Bandon Black absorb around 10,000x as much visible light as Nanoblack. ████ ███ ████ █████ ██ ████ ██ sensory deprivation, █ ███ ██ ███████ ███ █████, or permanent mental dissociation, whichever comes first. ||\n|| -0.887641 || Bandon Black || Bandon-Black is the lower limit of the updated Fluoren scale.

Photographs of the interior cannot be attained due to the cavern's unusually high concentration of SCP-3246.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Description:** SCP-█████ is a basalt cavern located within an inactive volcano off the coast of ██████. It is only accessible through a network of underwater lava tubes formed ~400 years prior to its discovery by a civilian tunneling group on August 2nd, ████. The Foundation quickly took control of the site and neutralized all those involved[[footnote]]Ordinarily, amnesticization would be sufficient, but the divers involved were documenting its location and accessibility, and had been for many months prior. The tube system's total length, over 73 kilometres, vastly outperforms the Kazumura lava tube system, still thought by the public to be the planet's largest system of its kind.[[/footnote]].\n> \n> The interior of SCP-█████ is entirely pitch black, even when lit. The inner cavern absorbs all light particles, rendering ordinary imaging technology unusable. While inside the chamber, the intense darkness causes a minor illusion that ones' surroundings are two-dimensional; this illusion persists into other senses, rendering it silent to those inside of it, but not those standing just outside of the entrance.\n> \n> Preliminary tests of Terrestrial Sonography Scanning (TSS) technology were able to produce scans of a large portion of the interior, though it is unknown at this time how far the cavern extends. Along with the expected basalt formations, portions of the cave contain the fossilized remains of a massive creature, as well as etchings in the cavern wall written in ancient Sumerian.
