As such, the veracity of the accounts detailed within cannot be confirmed, and their relation to [[[scp-1233| SCP-1233]]] is pending investigation. To take it as fact would be comparable to treating Homer's Odyssey as an accurate historical account.\n\n-- James Moore, Site-120's General RAISA Chairman\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 1**\n\n**SETTING:** Empty stage. An illusory Earth the size of a car floats two meters off the ground, a faint emerald glow surrounding it. The Moon is visible in its orbit.\n\n**AT RISE:** NARRATOR climbs aboard the stage, standing on the leftmost side. They face the crowd.\n\n= **NARRATOR**\nIn the reign of Queen Mab, legends were no different than reality. She dominated the world when every crevice brimmed with magic, when monsters and heroes clashed in the stars for all to see. Many a tale has been spun about this era; the tragedy of the Scarlet Fool, the slaying of the Inventor, and countless others told again and again until they are almost fact. Tonight, we bring you a tale seldom told…\n\n//(A second moon rises behind the Earth, moving in a larger orbit than the first. It is clearly covered in lush greenery and vast lakes.)//\n\n= **NARRATOR**\nOnce, there were two moons in the sky. One was the white and barren wasteland we all know, but the other was almost a reflection of our own world. Queen Mab had coveted it ever since she first glimpsed it in the sky, that pearl of brilliant turquoise shining amidst the swirling stars. And when she had taken all that she could from Gaia, she knew it was finally time for her empire to take to the skies.\n\nFirst, she sent an envoy to its people, the Adanei. A demand for tribute, an establishment of relations. She had never even seen the moon dwellers, but had played the game so many times that her moves came as naturally as breathing. Soon she would increase the demands under threat of war, sucking their little world dry until she could break them without effort.\n\n//(QUEEN MAB enters the stage from the right, wearing an exquisite white dress that trails behind her on the floor. A MESSENGER bursts into the stage from the left, out of breath.)//\n\n= **MESSENGER**\nMy Queen! The Adanei have refused to deliver tribute. They say they'll \"never bow down before a tyrant.\"\n\n//(Pure rage explodes on MAB’s face for an instant before she composes herself.)//\n\n= **MAB**\nCall my generals. We’ve got a world to burn.\n\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 2**\n\n**SETTING:** An apportation circle encompasses the floor, and unintelligible orders can be heard in the background, blending into the orchestra. A battalion of YEREN SLAVE-SOLDIERS stand in formation. One is notably missing.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION, a lean Yeren whose armor is clearly one size too big, rushes from the left of the stage to take his place in the circle. A FAE CAPTAIN in an ornate silver breastplate enters from the right. Spotlights turn on SAVION, and he addresses the audience as all actors freeze.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI am nought but a household slave,\nCruelly dragged into Queen Mab’s war!\nI do not know how to be brave,\nWhat are we even fighting for?\n\n//(Spotlights rescind. The FAE CAPTAIN shouts harsh commands. The music crescendos.)//\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nGive your souls and blood for our queen,\nTake the fight to the lunar fiends!\nLight your torches and draw your blades,\nBreak their bodies and burn their glades!\n\n//(The apportation circle ignites and white light bathes the stage. As it dies down, the soldiers are gone, and the FAE CAPTAIN leaves the stage.)//\n\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 3**\n\n**SETTING:** A lunar grove, burned to a crisp. Charred skeletons of once proud trees surround a group of YEREN SOLDIERS as they take cover from a barrage of plant-bombs. Where they land, thorns spray out, felling a quarter of the squadron while the rest press themselves to the forest floor. SAVION is among them. The air is thick with smoke, and the crackling of flames can be heard from every direction.\n\n**AT RISE:** THERAKH, a well-built Yeren warrior in platemail leaps through the trees, just as another plant-bomb is lobbed at the group. She lands next to the soldiers with her hands raised, and a yellow barrier blinks into existence around them, deflecting the attack. They look at her in awe.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAre you alright?\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou--you can do magic? Our Captain could have you executed!\n\n= **THERAKH**\nBetter not tell zir, then! Can you people move?\n\n= **YEREN SOLDIER**\nYes, but the bastards have us pinned. All this fire, and we’re still being bombarded every minute.\n\n= **SAVION**\nIf you can keep that barrier up, we might have a shot. What’s your name?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nTherakh, fifth battalion. You?\n\n= **SAVION**\nSavion. Thank you for saving all of our lives, Therakh.\n\n//(THERAKH helps the soldiers stand.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nYou can lift a sword with those arms?\n\n= **SAVION**\nHey!\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI’m simply surprised they conscripted you. Anyhow, pardon the phrasing but we’re not out of the woods yet. Come on, let’s move!\n\n//The soldiers move through the burnt forest, THERAKH’s barrier flashing intermittently as they are attacked.//\n\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 4**\n\n**SETTING:** SAVION and THERAKH are sitting around a campfire, joined by a few YEREN SOLDIERS. They are eating field rations, surrounded by war tents. The ground is covered in a thin layer of ash.\n\n**AT RISE:** The SOLDIERS begin to sing. Orchestra begins to play.\n\n= **YEREN SOLDIER**\nRipped away from home\nAnd thrown into the sky!\nTonight we’re still alive\nTomorrow we might die!\n\n= **SAVION**\nEverything’s aflame\nThe flowers and the trees\nScreams and smoke and ash\nDrift along the breeze\n\n= **THERAKH**\nMy comrades in arms,\nPierced by blades of bark,\nOnly I remained,\nLeft them in the dark.\n\n//(Music enters a bridge.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nOh--I didn't know. I'm sorry.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nDon’t be.\n\n= **YEREN SOLDIER**\nSent to fight a war,\nAs an afterthought,\nBe thankful you still breathe,\n‘Cause tomorrow you might not.\n\n= **SAVION**\nOh let there be peace,\nSo we might come back home,\nI can’t bear this for long,\nFearful and alone.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nOn the battlefield,\nYou’re never on your own,\nWe’ll make it out alive,\nAnd spit at Queen Mab’s throne!\n\n= **SAVION**\nCareful! You could be hanged for treason--\n\n= **THERAKH**\nEh, Captain’s a while off. Besides, Ze’s got more important things to do than listen in on our every conversation.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI suppose you're right. So, you’re fighting with us now?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nYep. Battalion got axed by the tree monsters, never saw ‘em coming. They’re merging what’s left with you folks to replace the twelfth company.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI’m glad. That you’re with us, of course, not about... what happened.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI know, you’d have been dead in a few days otherwise.\n\n= **SAVION**\nHey, I can handle myself!\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSure you can.\n\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 5**\n\n**SETTING:** Empty stage. An illusory moon hovers above the ground. It is burning.\n\n**AT RISE:** NARRATOR enters the stage.\n\n= **NARRATOR**\nIn just a few weeks, the verdant moon became a wasteland of blackened earth, its forests razed to the ground by Mab’s fury. Victory seemed just over the horizon. But no surrender came. No white flags or treaties or pleas for a ceasefire. Then the reports began pouring in.\n\nEncampments assaulted at night, the attackers seemingly coming from nowhere. Missing supplies and equipment, gone as if the earth swallowed them whole. Organic mines, poisonous thorns that rose from the dirt to eviscerate soldiers and generals alike. Requests for reinforcements were approved, but came with a royal warning. If they would not be able to bring the Adanei to heel, they would face the wrath of the Undoer herself.\n\n+ **ACT 1, SCENE 6**\n\n**SETTING:** A military encampment, the tents identical to those in SCENE 4. The ground is covered in a fine sheet of ash and dust.\n\n**AT RISE:** The stage begins to shake, as if during an earthquake. THERAKH and SAVION burst into the stage from the right alongside a group of YEREN SOLDIERS.\n\n= **SAVION**\nWhat–-what is this? What’s happening?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWe need to get to cover–-\n\n= **SAVION**\nWhat cover?! Everything is–-\n\n//(SAVION stumbles and falls to the ground. THERAKH stops running and rushes to his side. The YEREN SOLDIERS continue on, exiting from stage left.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nCome on! It’s not safe here!\n\n//(She begins to help him up, but the quake suddenly grows in strength and both of them lose their footing, falling prone. They shout in surprise and cover their heads as dust rains on the stage from above.)//\n\n//(Several large boulders drop on stage, flattening the war tents. The ash on the ground disappears as plants begin to grow rapidly. Soon, the Yeren pair is surrounded by foliage on all sides. Gnarled trees reach to the ceiling, bearing fruit that glow brightly in shades of pink and orange. The floor is a bed of moss, flowers and tall grass, turquoise in color. The sun is not visible - the hanging fruits are the only source of illumination.)//\n\n//(They have been dragged down from hell and into paradise.)//\n[[=]]\n+ **END OF ACT 1**\n[[/=]]\n\n+ **ACT 2, SCENE 1**\n\n**SETTING:** A lush cavern filled with dense foliage, see **ACT 1 SCENE 7**.\n\n**AT RISE:** THERAKH and SAVION stand up, dusting themselves off, and begin to explore the cave.\n\n= **SAVION**\nDid we… fall? Are we beneath the camp?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nLooks like it. This must be where they’ve been attacking us from. Stars above, it’s beautiful. To think, this is what we’ve destroyed…\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes. It’s untouched. We should see where this tunnel leads.\n\n//(THERAKH picks a round, pink fruit from a tree. Its glow diminishes as she takes a bite.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nWait! What if they’re–-\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAbsolutely delicious?\n\n= **SAVION**\n//(Sighs)// Nevermind.\n\n//(THERAKH begins to laugh.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nOh I can’t believe this! We’re free! Finally free!\n\n//(Music begins, upbeat and jovial.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI never expected for it to be like this,\nBut this is an opportunity I just can’t miss!\nLiberty handed to me on a platter,\nNo orders to follow, no masters to flatter!\n\nBecause we’re free, finally free!\nAs free as we could ever be!\nFree, utterly free!\nFrom abject pain and misery,\nFrom brutal, toiling slavery,\nFree, totally free!\n\n//(As she sings, THERAKH dances in the glade, cupping water that flows from a small stream in the rocky wall. Ribbons of yellow light linger in the air behind her. She drinks and turns to SAVION.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSavion? What’s wrong? Don’t you see?\nWe could stay here together, you and me!\n\n//(Music slows, growing more somber.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nNo, I’m sorry, I simply can’t,\nLive amongst these alien plants,\nThis isn’t my home, we’re trapped underground,\nAnd it will not be long until we are found,\n\nBy Luna or Mab, by wood or by steel,\nWe’ll be chained again and forced to kneel,\nThis isn’t Eden, nor is this hell,\nIt’s just another prison cell!\n\n//(Music grows faster and more intense. THERAKH and SAVION sing simultaneously.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI won’t have to hide my magic no more,\nDying in someone else’s war,\n\n= **SAVION**\nStaying here, it’s just not right,\nI miss the warmth of true sunlight,\n\n= **THERAKH**\nIf we were just to work together,\nWe could survive here forever,\n\n= **SAVION**\nThe wind flowing through my hair,\nMy lungs filling with fresh air,\n\n//(Music reaches a crescendo. SAVION sings alone.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nNo! I’m certain, without a doubt,\nI have to find my own way out,\nOut of this prison, this false paradise,\n\nThrough fire and blood, I know I might die,\nFor this last chance to see blue skies,\nBut that is freedom, and it will suffice.\n\n//(Music ends.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSo that’s it? You’ve made up your mind?\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes. This is goodbye.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nNo! I’ll come with you.\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou don’t have to.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI…\n\n= **SAVION**\nWhat?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI don’t want to be left alone. Not again.\n\n= **SAVION**\nOh.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nPlus, you–- //neither// of us will survive out here on our own. Best to go together.\n\n//(SAVION nods, and the two exit from stage right.)//\n\n+ **ACT 2, SCENE 2**\n**SETTING:** Same as previous scene.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION and THERAKH enter from stage left. They walk slowly in a circular path around the stage. The flora gradually changes as they walk, to imitate travel through the tunnels.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSo, what’s the plan? You’re the leader now.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI was hoping this tunnel would lead us upwards, but it looks like this is not the case.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWell, we never did find any entrances up above…\n\n= **SAVION**\nTrue. But no one had fallen below before we did, either.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhat now, then?\n\n= **SAVION**\nI–-I’m not sure. We can’t be the only ones to have been swallowed by the earth. Surely we’ll find someone from the army eventually.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nMore likely we’ll find eviscerated corpses.\n\n= **SAVION**\nIt’s the only chance we have.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nHmph.\n\n//(The two pause next to a small stream, filling their waterskins and cleaning their fur. SAVION takes out a small sack and eats a handful of glowing berries.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nWe should stop and make camp, I think. We’ve been walking for hours.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAnd still no-one in sight. How do the moon monsters even navigate this place?\n\n= **SAVION**\nI wish I knew. Stars willing, we’ll have more luck tomorrow. I'll take first watch?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSure, I could use the rest. Be careful. And wake me up if anything's wrong.\n\n//(THERAKH lies down to sleep while SAVION sits down, leaning against a tree trunk. Spotlights dim, shrouding the stage in darkness.)//\n\n+ **ACT 2, SCENE 3**\n**SETTING:** Same as previous scene. Spotlights bathe the stage in dim red light. THERAKH is still sleeping.\n\n**AT RISE:** An ADANEI WARRIOR enters slowly from stage left. They are a tall, humanoid being seemingly made of wood, with four arms and a crown of branches extending like antlers from their head. SAVION appears not to notice them as they creep on the pair.\n\n//(SAVION yawns. The ADANEI leaps forwards, thick, thorned vines sprouting from their arms. SAVION jumps to his feet and attempts to draw his sword, but isn’t quick enough. The ADANEI grabs him by the neck while the vines ensnare his arms and legs, drawing blood. The creature whispers.)//\n\n= **ADANEI**\nOne word and I’ll snap your neck, invader.\n\n//(SAVION grits his teeth. His body becomes more muscular, though he does not notice this. The ADANEI leans in.)//\n\n= **ADANEI**\nNow, I’m going to ask you some questions. Blink once for yes, two for–-\n\n//(SAVION slams his forehead into the ADANEI’s face, staggering them. His arm breaks free of the vines and he draws his blade, slashing desperately in a wide arc. The ADANEI leaps back, but their arm is caught in the strike and falls to the ground. SAVION is almost as large as THERAKH now, and he charges his foe.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nRAAAAAAAAAGH!\n\n//(The ADANEI brings their arms up to defend, but the Yeren’s blade cuts through them with ease. THERAKH wakes up and leaps to her feet, drawing her own weapon, but finds that SAVION has already pierced the attacker’s chest with his sword. His newfound strength deflates as she rushes over, hands glowing with yellow light.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nBy the–- Are you alright?\n\n//(SAVION is out of breath.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes, I’m… I’m fine. I killed it.\n\n//(He draws his sword out of the arboreal corpse. Scarlet blood drips from it. He wipes the blade on a nearby bush and sheathes it before examining his arms. THERAKH looks him over.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWas this… your first kill?\n\n//(Short silence.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAh. I’m sorry.\n\n//(She raises a hand, as if to put it on his shoulder, but he pulls away.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nWe should get going. Before others come looking for it.\n\n//(He walks quickly, exiting from stage right. THERAKH quickly follows.)//\n\n+ **ACT 2, SCENE 4**\n**SETTING:** THERAKH and SAVION are camping in the underground wilderness, clearly in a different location. SAVION is asleep while THERAKH keeps watch.\n\n**AT RISE:** THERAKH sings to herself softly.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhat was that I saw there? That flash of power?\nFor just a moment I could have sworn,\nThat the gentle spirit I’ve come to known,\nHad hardened into something awful.\n\nWar twists and bends us all like metal,\nThis I have known since the very start,\nBut now it forges something in his heart,\nAnd I am afraid.\n\n//(Therakh lies down to rest. SAVION rises to keep his own watch. He examines his body.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nWhat was that I felt there? That burst of strength?\nI had never felt anything like it before,\nCould it be that these bloody months of war,\nHave finally forged me into something greater?\n\nAm I finally becoming a soldier?\nAt last, someone I can be proud of?\nOr was it a gift from the stars above,\nGuiding me to them?\n\n= **SAVION**\nOh, to see the starry sky again…\n\n//(He closes his eyes sleepily. His ears grow slightly, perking up. Red flowers bloom around his feet. He does not notice.)//\n\n+ **ACT 2, SCENE 5**\n**SETTING:** A lunar cavern nearly identical to previous scenes.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION and THERAKH enter from stage left. Smoke slowly creeps into the stage from stage right.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhat? No! The wood’s just armor. Beneath it they bleed like anyone else.\n\n= **SAVION**\nWhat about the arms then? //Those// don’t bleed at all! It’s as if they were a tree branch.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nJust extensions. Like… I don’t know, pauldrons or capes. Only more useful.\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes, but–- wait. I smell something.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nHuh? I don't--\n\n= **SAVION**\nFire. The army’s here, we’ve made it!\n\n//(SAVION breaks into a sprint, charging out of stage right. THERAKH follows him. Spotlights transition to bright orange as illusory flames appear onstage, engulfing the foliage.)//\n\n//(Intense music begins to play. From stage left enter a number of YEREN SOLDIERS led by a familiar FAE CAPTAIN, zir armor dented and damaged. The group is engaged in brutal combat with an equal number of ADANEI WARRIORS.)//\n\n//(Fighting continues with both sides sustaining heavy losses. Eventually, only the CAPTAIN and two ADANEI are left standing. Ze is backed into a corner as the two advance, sharpened limbs poised to strike. Zir stance is unstable, holding zir sword with shaking hands. Blood drips from zir forehead.)//\n\n//(SAVION enters running from stage left. His body grows more muscular as he draws his blade and drives it into the back of one of the ADANEI. Flowers bloom beneath him.)//\n\n//(The second WARRIOR twists around to face SAVION as THERAKH enters the stage as well. She runs in to help him, but he wins the duel just as she reaches him. The FAE CAPTAIN looks at them in surprise, still gripping zir weapon.)//\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nWell, well, well, if it isn’t the deserters. You know the penalty for treason is death.\n\n//(SAVION rips his sword out of the dead ADANEI and sheathes it.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nYou are in no position to punish us now, worm.\n\n//(Yellow sparks dance across her fingertips.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nIn fact, I think I’ll be the one carrying out the sen–-\n\n//(THERAKH yelps as SAVION shoves her to the side violently, falling to the floor. SAVION kneels before his CAPTAIN.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nPlease, we are not deserters. We were separated during the fiends’ attack, and have been attempting to rejoin with the rest of the army ever since. Please pardon us, Captain.\n\n//(The CAPTAIN’s eyes widen in surprise before zir face twists in a smile. Ze looks at THERAKH, who’s struggling to rise, still in shock.)//\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nVery well, I shall forgive this affront, if you will serve. Now kneel.\n\n//(She glances at SAVION, confusion and betrayal evident on her face. For a moment her whole body is tense, as if preparing to attack. The she relaxes her muscles, breathes deeply and bends the knee.)//\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nAnd it’s General now. You’d do well to remember that.\n[[=]]\n+ **END OF ACT 2**\n[[/=]]\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 1**\n**SETTING:** An underground military encampment. The floor is covered in ash and the surrounding flora is burnt to a crisp. On the right side of the stage is a tent larger than the others, its fourth wall absent for the audience. Inside this command tent is a small table, around which sit the FAE GENERAL, a FAE CAPTAIN and a FAE COLONEL.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION enters from stage left. He sits on the ground a few meters away from the command tent, as if to rest. His ears visibly elongate as the FAE begin to speak.\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nWell?\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nWe’re making progress, General, but the soldiers are exhausted and so are we. It doesn’t help that we’re forced to burn every source of food we come across–-\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nMight I remind you they are slaves, Captain? Keep the food for yourselves. Our Queen demands results, and she’s seen precious little of that in the last few weeks.\n\n= **FAE COLONEL**\nAt this rate, she’ll have nothing to rule over but a charred husk, General! Surely we can’t be expected to–-\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nYou are //expected// to follow the Queen’s orders. If that is her wish, so it shall be. Have there been any news from deeper below? Terms from the monsters, perhaps?\n\n= **FAE CAPTAIN**\nNone, I’m afraid. They’re stubborn creatures.\n\n= **FAE COLONEL**\nThey’re fighting for their lives while our soldiers are fighting for a Queen who barely knows they exist!\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nWatch your tongue.\n\n= **FAE COLONEL**\nWith all due respect General, troop morale is in the dirt for a reason. We can’t win a war like this.\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nAnd what do you propose, exactly? Because to me, it sounds like you’re spreading propaganda for the enemy.\n\n= **FAE COLONEL**\nTake my head if you’d like, but that won’t change a thing. We must either hunker down for a war of attrition or find a way to destroy their chain of command. Otherwise, we’re all as good as dead.\n\n//(The FAE stop talking. The spotlights shift to SAVION, drenching the command tent in darkness. THERAKH enters from stage left and walks up to him.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhat are you doing?\n\n= **SAVION**\nListening.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nTo what?\n\n= **SAVION**\nTo our leaders. If they will not share the state of the war with us, then I must learn the truth myself.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhat are you talking about, how can you–-\n\n= **SAVION**\nShhhh!\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSavion, please. Just talk to me. You haven’t been acting like yourself.\n\n//(He does not reply. The CAPTAIN and the COLONEL leave the war tent and walk past them, exiting from stage left.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nLike myself? People change, Therakh. I’m a soldier now, like you! I thought you would understand.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nIt’s not that, I’m glad you’ve gotten good with a sword, it’s just… I don’t even understand //how//, and you’ve grown so cold–-\n\n= **SAVION**\nHow? I’ve been given a gift.\n\n//(His body bulks up and he stands to his full height. THERAKH instinctively stands up as well. He is slightly taller than her now.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nControl over my own body, and my own destiny.\n\n//(A seedling pushes out of the ash next to SAVION’s foot. He crouches down and caresses it, watching as it grows faster in response. It blooms with red.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nNow, I’m going to make myself into someone who matters.\n\n//(He turns away and enters the command tent, disappearing in the dark. THERAKH buries her face in her hands.)//\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 2**\n\n**SETTING:** An underground military encampment. Wounded YEREN SOLDIERS huddle together around small campfires. On the left side of the stage, a tent has been erected around a large tree. The wall facing the audience is absent, revealing an ADANEI PRISONER chained to the tree. The wood that covers their skin is split and cut in several places, and they have only one pair of arms.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION enters from stage right, moving quickly through the camp. He stops at the entrance to the tent, where a YEREN GUARD stands.\n\n= **YEREN GUARD**\nHalt!\n\n= **SAVION**\nI’ve permission from the General.\n\n//(He shows the guard a piece of parchment. The GUARD nods, and he steps inside. The rest of the stage goes dark as the spotlights focus on the prisoner tent.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nI heard you were being uncooperative.\n\n= **PRISONER**\nDo your worst. We will not yield.\n\n//(SAVION reaches out and grips their chest, nails digging into the wood. The spotlights turn a bright green, and music begins to play.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nListen close now and listen hard,\nI can warp your body like I can my own,\nTell me where your leaders are,\nOr I’ll show you pain you’ve never known.\n\n= **PRISONER**\nYour rage betrays your own weakness,\nI’ve seen friends die by your flames,\nAnd even facing such bleakness,\nOur garden will grow again.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI will break you!\n\n//(The PRISONER screams as the wood tears and sloughs off their body, revealing a slim figure beneath with pale green skin. SAVION’s fingers draw bright red blood as they sink deeper into their chest. Music intensifies as a giant, illusory tree manifests at the center of the stage, pulsing with green light.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nAGH! My eyes! My mind!\nWhat //is// this?\n\n= **PRISONER**\nYou are running out of time,\nBear witness.\n\n= **SAVION**\nEverything… it's all connected,\nIt's the heart.\n\n= **PRISONER**\nYes, it has kept us protected,\nFrom the start.\n\n//(Music dies down as SAVION lets go of the ADANEI PRISONER and stumbles backwards, clutching his head and groaning in pain. The illusion fades from the stage. The PRISONER coughs blood.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nI'm part of it now too, aren't I?\n\n= **PRISONER**\nYes, though I know not why,\n\n= **SAVION**\nI can see it now, in my mind's eye,\n\n= **PRISONER**\nI've given you it all, please let me die,\n\n= **SAVION**\nRight at the center, so far below,\nI'll rip it out and return a hero!\n\n//(SAVION leaves the tent, the spotlights following him outside. The FAE GENERAL stands at the center of the stage, dismissing an officer as ze sees SAVION.)//\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nWell?\n\n= **SAVION**\nIt broke. Told me exactly where we need to strike. This war will be over in a week.\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nExcellent. I will be expecting you at the command tent at first light. I’m promoting you to Lieutenant.\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou honor me, General.\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nYou’ve proven yourself efficient. I want you leading the vanguard. High Command must stay behind lines for now; coordinating troop movements throughout hundreds of tunnels is no easy task, I'm afraid.\n\n= **SAVION**\nOf course.\n\n= **FAE GENERAL**\nGood hunting, Lieutenant. You are dismissed.\n\n= **SAVION**\nYes, General.\n\n//(SAVION salutes and exits through stage right. The FAE GENERAL exits through stage left.)//\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 3**\n**SETTING:** A military encampment in a lunar cavern. YEREN SOLDIERS mill about, dismantling tents and sparring with one another. Mab’s forces are mobilizing.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION enters from stage right, directing the SOLDIERS in various tasks. THERAKH enters from stage left and approaches him.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSo, Lieutenant, huh?\n\n= **SAVION**\nI am your superior officer and you will address me as such.\n\n//(There is a short pause.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nYes, Lieutenant. May I ask a question?\n\n= **SAVION**\nSpeak freely.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAre you behind the screams I heard last night?\n\n//(SAVION does not respond.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nDid you torture him, Savion?\n\n= **SAVION**\nI know it must be difficult for you to accept this, Therakh, but I am no longer the frightened weakling you took into your care.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nThis isn’t about that! Did you or did you not?!\n\n= **SAVION**\nIt was the only way.\n\n//(THERAKH grabs him by the shoulders.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nThe only way for what?!\n\n//(He jerks away and kicks her in the stomach. She staggers back, but holds her ground.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nDon’t touch me!\n\n//(THERAKH meets his gaze, pain blossoming in her eyes.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWhy?\n\n= **SAVION**\nI could have your head for that, you know.\n\n//(Her expression turns from sadness to anger. She spits at his feet.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nBe my guest.\n\n//(She turns away and leaves, exiting through stage left. SAVION walks slowly towards stage right, muttering to himself.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou don’t need her. You don’t need her anymore. You’re //strong// now! You don’t! We have to win. We have to go home. She’ll understand. Yes, she will. When all is said and done she’ll see it. She has to.\n\n//(He exits through stage right.)//\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 4**\n**SETTING:** A lunar cavern, burnt to a crisp. A thick layer of ash covers the floor. In the center of the stage is a tall pile of corpses, Adanei and Yeren alike. More bodies litter the stage. A group of YEREN SOLDIERS, THERAKH among them, is currently at work adding them to the pile.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION enters from stage right, dragging the bodies of two large Adanei soldiers. His fur is stained with blood. He hurls them at the pile with force.\n\n= **SAVION**\nBurn them when you're done. The wood makes for excellent kindling.\n\n//(He exits through stage right. The SOLDIERS continue their work for a moment,  before one of them comes up to THERAKH.)//\n\n= **YEREN SOLDIER**\nHey, you're Therakh right? From the fifth?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nYes. Are you–-\n\n= **YEREN SOLDIER**\nVareden. You saved my life, up on the surface a few months ago.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nOh! Right. It was nothing. Just duty.\n\n//(THERAKH sits on a rock to rest. VAREDEN joins her.)//\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nDuty? You don’t seem like the type.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nHa, not that type of duty. I couldn't care less about this pointless campaign.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nThey say we're close to victory. Close to going home.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAs if that matters. We're slaves either way, here or there.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nYou never know what the future holds.\n\n//(THERAKH doesn’t respond for a moment.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI can't believe I gave it all up. My one chance to be free… of all of this.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nGave up for what?\n\n= **THERAKH**\nLove.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nThat sounds like a worthy goal.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nI thought so too, at the time. It… didn’t work out. It was foolish.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nI don’t think it’s foolish to pursue your dreams.\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAnd what if that dream turns into a nightmare?\n\n//(VAREDEN doesn’t respond. The two watch in silence as the YEREN SOLDIERS pile up the rest of the bodies. One of them attempts to light a fire with flint and steel, but the sparks don’t catch.)//\n\n//(After a few moments, THERAKH stands up and walks over to them, glancing over her shoulder.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nHe lied. There’s too much blood for the wood to catch. Here.\n\n//(She reaches out her palm. Golden flames leap from her fingers, engulfing the nearest corpse. Slowly, they begin to spread to the others. THERAKH sits back down.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nWon’t be long before we’ll be the ones burning.\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nLike I said, you never know what tomorrow will bring. We’ll make it out alive.\n\n//(Soft, somber music begins to play. THERAKH sings slowly.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nAshes to ashes, dust to dust,\nBurned it all, thought I could trust,\nThis world is cruel and nothing is just,\nIt’s hard to go on but I know that I must.\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 5**\n**SETTING:** A lunar cavern. Thick, dark smoke curls from the sides of the stage.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION enters from stage left, followed by a large contingent of YEREN SOLDIERS, among them THERAKH and VAREDEN. SAVION addresses his troops.\n\n= **SAVION**\nSoldiers! The final hour is at hand. I have carefully selected each and every one of you to lead the assault. We are the vanguard that shall break through their last line of defense, a force that shall crush any barricade the wooden demons can raise. Up ahead is the World Tree, the beating heart that grants these beasts their power. Today, we set it aflame. Tomorrow, we return home with honor and glory.\n\n//(He draws his sword, lifting it up high. The SOLDIERS remain silent, their faces hard.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nFor the Queen! Charge!\n\n//(The contingent charges across the stage, exiting through stage right. The sound of crackling flames intensifies and smoke billows from the floor, covering the stage as the set transitions to the next scene.)//\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 6**\n**SETTING:** A lunar battlefield. A wooden barricade covered in thorns stands at the center, behind which stand ADANEI WARRIORS, wooden limbs long and sharp like spears. More WARRIORS stand on tall trees, some gripping plant bombs while others ready bows fashioned from their own bodies. They are all staring dead ahead at the left side of the stage.\n\n**AT RISE:** SAVION’s contingent comes charging in through stage left. He screams a command.\n\n= **SAVION**\nForward! Break them!\n\n//(A hail of projectiles comes raining down on the YEREN SOLDIERS. Sharpened wooden arrows pierce their armor and impale their flesh, while the bombs spray poisoned thorns in all directions. Half of the group falls before THERAKH raises a barrier of golden energy with a roar.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nGo go go!\n\n//(She stands with her arms raised high, clearly struggling to hold the shield as the bombardment continues. SAVION, muscles rippling, leaps above the thorny barrier with his blade drawn, instantly beheading an ADANEI behind it. His soldiers follow suit, but many fall to the defenders’ spears before they can cross the threshold.)//\n\n//(The ADANEI WARRIORS in the trees abandon their posts and jump down as one. THERAKH shouts as her barrier is shattered by their weight, and they lunge at her.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nHelp!\n\n//(She rolls away, narrowly escaping their arm-blades. They press the attack, outnumbering her five to one. In a panic, she parries, blocks and dodges each of their strikes, rapidly losing ground as she draws towards the wall.)//\n\n//(One of the ADANEI screeches as a giant battleaxe slams into their back, sending them to the ground. Two of the remaining four turn to face the attacker while the other two remain focused on THERAKH.)//\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nI’ve got you, fight!\n\n//(THERAKH’s eyes burst with light as one of her attackers is flung backward violently. She charges the other, overpowering them while VAREDEN holds off the other two. On the other side of the stage, SAVION’s hulking form tears through the Adanei ranks, throwing their bodies on the barricades.)//\n\n//(VAREDEN finds an opening and crushes a ADANEI’s head with his axe. The move leaves him open, however, and a spear of dark wood skewers his chest. He groans in pain as THERAKH rushes over to fend off the attacker, sword burning with golden fire. Seeing the flames, they flee, and THERAKH crouches next to VAREDEN.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nNo no no, stay with me, stay with me!\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nI’m–-I’m fine.\n\n//(She ignores him, hands glowing as they press against the wound.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nCome-on-come-on-come-on!\n\n//(The light flickers. VAREDEN gasps, blood flowing from his mouth.)//\n\n= **VAREDEN**\nI’ve paid my debt.\n\n//(His eyes close. A terrible, bestial screech rips through the air, clearly sourced from the right side of the stage. There is a quake, then another and another. Something big is drawing close. On the other side of the barricade, few remain standing. SAVION and a handful of YEREN SOLDIERS freeze at the sound.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nStand your ground! We will not retreat!\n\n//(His troops do not obey, scrambling backwards to where THERAKH is standing. SAVION follows them unwillingly, still facing stage right.)//\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 7**\n**SETTING:** Same as the previous scene. Yeren and Adanei corpses litter the floor. The grass is stained a deep red.\n\n**AT RISE:** YEREN REINFORCEMENTS arrive through stage left. SAVION stands at the head of the party, with THERAKH not far behind. The contingency watches in terror as an ADANEI WAR BEAST emerges from stage right. It is a colossal, reptilian-like creature with scales of tree bark. Each of its six legs is twice the size of a Yeren, and large spines rise from its back. A crown of razor-sharp branches adorn its head, upon which four eyes burn with hate. It roars.\n\n= **SAVION**\nForward! For the Queen!\n\n//(SAVION pours every inch of authority into his voice as he charges forward at the BEAST. To his surprise, his soldiers follow suit.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nSpread out! Surround it and attack together! We strike as one!\n\n//(The BEAST leaps forward in a stunning display of speed, crashing into the approaching horde. SOLDIERS are flung into the air, others crushed beneath its feet. THERAKH finds herself beneath its belly as its massive jaws devour a YEREN whole. She grips her sword, sets it aflame once more, and drives it into the underside of the BEAST. It screams and shudders before grabbing THERAKH with a giant claw and raising her to the air. In a moment, she will be slammed into the earth, and die.)//\n\n//(SAVION's troops are faltering. Only one in every five is still fighting. One is about to be crushed under the BEAST's foot, another frozen in fear as it opens its maw again. SAVION seizes the opportunity and leaps, sword raised high.)//\n\n//(He crashes into the BEAST’s forehead with force, shattering its crown into splinters. His weapon tears through the thick wooden hide, carving the soft flesh underneath. The WAR BEAST dies with a whimper.)//\n\n//(THERAKH dies with a scream.)//\n\n= **THERAKH**\nSavion!\n\n+ **ACT 3, SCENE 8**\n**SETTING:** The World Tree dominates the stage. Only half of it is visible, the rest seemingly placed backstage. SAVION stands before it, sword in hand. He is covered in blood, and his body is the same as it was when he first arrived on this world, short and scrawny. He is alone.\n\n**AT RISE:** The World Tree’s bark shifts, molding itself into a roughly humanoid shape that detaches itself from the trunk. This SPIRIT looks at SAVION with glowing green eyes.\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou’re it, right? The heart?\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nYou know what I am. I showed you.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI’ve come to kill you.\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nI know. You believe it will set you free. I cannot stop you. I have done everything I could, and I have failed.\n\n= **SAVION**\nThen why… why did you choose me? Why give me the power to destroy you?\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nYou were not chosen.\n\n= **SAVION**\nWh--What?\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nAn accident. When my child drove their claws into your flesh the day you were ambushed, they poured a part of them into you. A part of them that pulsed with power. The part of them that was me. The part of me that’s in all of them.\n\n= **SAVION**\nBut–-but the vision! You showed me the way to you! You brought me here!\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nI tried to make you see! But you were blind and a fool. You saw only what you wanted to, what fit your own fantasies of heroism and glory.\n\n= **SAVION**\nSee what, then?! What was I supposed to see?!\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nThat I //am// this world. That every leaf, petal, branch and blade of grass is part of me, and that my roots run the whole world over. That what you in your arrogance call victory will end everything.\n\n= **SAVION**\nNo.\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nTo kill me is to kill this world. It will collapse in on itself and crumble to dust. And you will die.\n\n= **SAVION**\nNo!\n\n//(SAVION falls to his knees, leaning on his sword as it sinks in the earth. He weeps.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nYou lie!\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nYou know I do not.\n\n= **SAVION**\nI sacrificed //everything// for this. My freedom, my honor, even //her//! This can’t be the end. No, this is a trick, some last-ditch effort to save yourself. And it won’t work.\n\n//(He stands up shakily and stumbles forward, gripping his weapon with both hands.)//\n\n= **WORLD SPIRIT**\nYou do not believe that.\n\n//(SAVION is inches away from the SPIRIT now. He raises the blade at its chest.)//\n\n= **SAVION**\nIt doesn’t matter, does it?\n\n//(The SPIRIT simply looks him in the eyes. He stabs its heart. The world shakes.)//\n\n//(The stage is plunged into darkness. When the spotlights turn on again, it is empty, apart from a thin sheet of dust that lingers in the air, slowly drifting down to the floor. The NARRATOR enters from stage left and addresses the crowd.)//\n\n= **NARRATOR**\nAnd so, that charred husk of a world finally broke, returning to stardust. It is said that pieces of its spirit fell down to the Earth, sowing it with the seeds of a power that would be used to topple an empire. But the history of biomancy is a story for another time.\n\nSome say that Savion is still alive, still stalking the stars in search of those he called monsters. They claim that the eons had driven him mad, that he heralds himself as a Champion of an empire which has laid dead for millennia.\n\nI, for one, hope he found rest.\n\n[[=]]\n+ **END OF ACT 3**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=UNCGriffin]]\n=====\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
