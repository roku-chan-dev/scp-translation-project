Haven't seen a lot of souls ever since they locked me down here. Why not stay a while, and listen to an old thing ramble? You don't look like you're in a hurry either, not with that leg of yours. Be careful around the edge, so you don't fall in here. It's a long way down.\n\nOh, why am I down here, you ask. I'm here because many choose to fear that which they don't understand, and many choose to destroy, or in my case lock away, what they fear. I have been here for a long time, so long that most souls in this facility have forgotten that I'm even here. I have had a lot of free time. Want to know what I do with that free time?\n\nI write. With will as my quill and the fabric of reality as my canvas, I write, and my words shape reality.\n\n[[module ListUsers users=\".\"]]\nWho's to say I'm not writing about you right now, %%title%%?

A bit of context: while I only became a member of the site in 2018 and active in the community in 2019, I have been an active lurker here since 2012-2013. I enjoyed reading the site, but the community always seemed distant to me somehow. The fact that I'm now part of it feels... weird, and the fact that I have produced content for it even weirder. When I made this, I was proud of just getting something on the site. I expected this to reach maybe +20, and I would have been happy with that. But, against all of my expectations, it got into the Reviewer's Spotlight (thank you [[*user Kilonova]]) and the rating just soared. After that, people have made fan art and audio adaptations and translations of it, it's appeared (briefly) in a Markiplier video and it's just... mind blowing to me. On the September of 2020 it also became the first article on the site to have ever been both Reviewer's spotlighted //and// featured (thank you [[*user OCuin]], [[*user Flopmind]] and [[*user REDESERT]]), which is even more insane. \n\nOh, a few fun facts: This was actually inspired by a dumb JoJo meme posted in the WL Discord by [[*user Rounderhouse]], and every character in this skip is actually named after different banana varieties.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n\n[[<]]\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 4px #BB0011; width: auto; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top:1em; margin-bottom:1em; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n+++ [[[scp-5535 |SCP-5535 - When Even Your Hand Hates You]]]\n\"//SCP-5535 was arrested for the murder of its wife and the attempted murder of its child in 13/07/2016.

Like with 5063, I tried going for something reminiscent of Series 1 tropes, in this case a murder monster instead of a thing that does a thing, but with a modern twist. Unlike 5063 however, it didn't do very well. It's fine though, I'm happy enough with it, and while being my lowest rated work at the time of writing, it's been steadily going up and it's not gonna fall into deletion anytime soon. Hopefully. \n\n5137 is also a good example of inspiration coming from the weirdest of places.

It still retains the same level of absurdism, but it's absurd comedy instead of the usual tragedy. Originally, I wanted to write like, proper romance for the contest because that's not something I've written before, but I couldn't come up with any exciting ideas and I was really unmotivated by the contest. Then I came up with this ridiculous idea, and pitched it to a few friends in voicechat, whose disgusted reactions assured me that I had to write it. \n\nIt was originally supposed to be kind of a parody on those weird dating simulators where you're romancing a lama prince or some shit, but then it evolved into... something else. I'm actually pretty proud of how it turned out. \n\nFew fun facts: Dr. Ducrotay is named after Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville, the dude who found and taxonomized sea cucumbers. He did that in 1834, which is why the designation for the article is 5834. \n\nOn the topic of fun facts, if this commentary hasn't convinced you read the article, I'll let you know that I read a lot about sea cucumbers and found out a lot of weird and fun facts about them, that I've sprinkled throughout the article.
