SCP-8054-1\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**BEGIN LOG**\n\nSeveral months prior to the Foundation's direct involvement, local residents of the ████████ region recounted witnessing brief, inexplicable flashes of light from the vicinity of the ████████ Research Facility. Intermittent electrical blackouts, and auditory disturbances, including harmonious hums and rhythmic beats, were reported in the surrounding area. During passive surveillance, Foundation agents observed multiple anomalous events over the course of several months: the manifestation and demanifestation of several sentient orbs of light, unexpected shifts in local gravity, and time distortions among others.\n\nPreliminary investigations revealed the facility's ownership linked to a private research entity founded by Dr. Elena Novak. Dr. Novak, a prodigious computational physicist, was globally recognized for her pioneering work in quantum programming and reality simulation. She had previously authored a myriad of groundbreaking papers and had been invited to countless symposiums around the world. Six years prior, Dr. Novak had receded from public engagements, leading many to speculate she had immersed herself in an undisclosed, ambitious project.\n\nFactoring in the potential scale of the anomaly and Dr. Novak's involvement, a decision was made for the Foundation to intervene directly. Upon the containment team's arrival, the main lab was found to be in meticulous order, with equipment neatly arranged and no signs of hurried departure. However, meticulous notes detailing a shutdown procedure lay adjacent to the terminals, and each terminal exhibited extensive log entries. Notably, the final line of these logs prominently flashed an error message in bright red text: \"[CRITICAL ERROR]: Null Sequence Activated. Execution of VeritasCode Denied.\"\n\nDr. Novak and her team were conspicuously absent, but SCP-8054 and her detailed field journal, shedding light on her experiments and ambitions with VeritasCode, were recovered. The facility, now under the Foundation's purview, remains a focal point of research and investigation into the disappearance of Dr. Novak and her team.\n\n**END LOG**\n[[/div]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access File System\" hide=\"Access File System\"]]\n@@    @@> [[a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8054/offset/1\"]]SCP-8054 File - VeritasCode[[/a]]\n@@    @@> [[a href=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8054/offset/3\"]]SCP-8054 File - Journal Entries of Dr. Elena Novak - Addendum.
