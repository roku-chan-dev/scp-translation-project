Come to think of it, I don’t think I ever did. The dead thing has always been there. That’s its domain, I’ve decided. The rest of the house is plenty for me.\n\nBut I still pass that hall every day. Most times I keep my eyes forward and pretend there’s nothing there. \n\nSome nights I stand at the end of the hall — my end — and stare for hours until my eyes adjust to the darkness. I can see the contours of its limbs and the glint of hate in his eyes. \n\nAnd then I go to bed. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:basalt]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=PeppersGhost]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
