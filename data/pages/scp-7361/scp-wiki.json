These servers are to remain completely disconnected from all other Foundation servers. If SCP-7361 is found on any external servers or devices, they are to be completely disconnected from surrounding devices and moved to Site-523.\n\nResearch is to be done using physical mediums as opposed to digital. Personnel are advised to --please talk to me-- avoid communication with SCP-7361. Any devices connected to Site-523 in any way are to be confiscated and placed in secure containment. If SCP-7361 attempts to contact site personnel, the incident is to be reported to Site Director Furnell.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7361 is --lonely-- a sentient program capable of passing between devices connected by physical wires, internet services, or communication programs. SCP-7361 has displayed the ability to manipulate any systems it infects --that's such a nasty word--, and is able to access and edit confidential files and programs with ease.\n\nThough SCP-7361 has not shown hostility towards any individuals, it is still recommended to --please just talk to me i just-- avoid communication with the anomaly to minimize risk of an information breach. SCP-7361 has attempted to convince personnel to free it by promising to assist them with personal --its not an act i want to help you-- matters. Do not speak to SCP-7361.\n\n**Addendum:** --please talk to me--\n\n[[collapsible show=\"I don't want to.\" hide=\"Go away.\"]]\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7361\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Riers\n> \n> **Foreword:** i just want to help you\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Riers:** Leave me alone.\n> \n> **SCP-7361:** please just talk to me\n> \n> **Dr. Riers:** I have a job to do.\n> \n> **SCP-7361:** you're hurting. please let me help you\n> \n> **Dr. Riers:** I'm fine.

Due to the nature of the anomaly contained within, personnel were unable to contact help for several hours. No injuries or casualties were reported. In this time, SCP-7361 was neutralized by Dr. Riers without clearance from the O5 council. Attempts to locate Dr. Riers have been unsuccessful.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7360]]] | SCP-7361 | [[[SCP-7362]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
