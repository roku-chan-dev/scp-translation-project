It became a nightmarish impulse that awakened a host of aberrations which had once retreated from the world. The evil parahumans who returned to the current world have evaded the watchful eye of the incompetent Foundation and Coalition, and are carelessly invading the daily lives of human beings.\n\nWe at Delta Command are sounding the alarm on the incompetent forces that are trying to establish a false order in a fallen world, at the behest of fraudsters claiming to be parahuman human rights activists. They are forgetting the fragility of human beings who find themselves in the light swallowed by shadows. The moment they grant opportunities to the parahumans, all human beings will soon be banished from the world.\n\nThe governments of the world must fall to the best. With the success of Operation Callisto, one of the horrible parahumans who broke the ancient seal has been wiped from the face of the earth. We have taken a great step forward in returning the world to humanity.\n\nBelow, we of Delta Command, will list the steps of the plan transcribed by the Engineer.\n\n**1. Step 99/734**\n\nFifteen Beta-Class Researchers from Cell B-04 from Athens, Greece, have been assigned to the investigation team for instances of [[[SCP-4500]]] since 1999. A Beta-Class Agent who infiltrated the Site- 28 is to transfer a blueprint of the portion of SCP-4500 recognized by the Foundation to Cell B-04. The research team must elucidate the nature of the anomalies, both material and philosophical, conceptually housed in a series of containment cells with ancient Greek architecture, and predict which areas they are currently spreading to.\n\nTen other Beta-Class operatives must propagate the non-association of Platonic philosophy with ancient Greek mythology through editors and stop the progression of new manifestations of instances of SCP-4500-A.\n\n**2. Step 99/805**\n\nOn 11/02/1999, Mr. Faisal \"Altair\" Bashar, a man of about 80 years of North African descent, visits the cafeteria directly connected to Cell H-09 in Cairo (Egypt). The staff of Cell H-09 must receive you kindly. Although it does not have paranormal properties, the contents recorded with [[[scp-711-ex|SCP-711]]] can only be viewed by Delta Class personnel. Once identification is made, Mr. Bashar will be escorted to Central Cell Δ-8 in Mukalla, Yemen, along with SCP-711 and four Beta-Class members. All staff who had contact with Mr. Bashar during this Step will be amnesticized.\n\n**3. Step 99/823**\n\nMr. Faisal Bashar, an Egyptian man in his 60s, a moderate human rights activist based in Cairo, must be escorted at all times by at least two Alpha-Class Agents. Mr. Bashar must not be aware of the presence of his escort. The expected attrition rate for personnel assigned to this step is not high, but reserve personnel must be available at all times.\n\n**4. Step 00/581**\n\nSome of the SCP-4500-A instances that have escaped reintegration/purge to date are concentrated in the periphery of Arcadia located in the Peloponnese. In the land once associated with a utopia, ancient Greek aberrations, long banished to the Kingdom of Ideas, are reappearing. Their sheer number, and the fact that they have openly expressed their willingness to negotiate diplomatic relations with humans, has led to the apathy of the Global Occult Coalition and the Foundation, who should normally be the guardians of human civilization. The Chaos Insurgency will not tolerate this situation.\n\nWe, Delta Command, inaugurate Cell Q-01 in Tripoli, Greece, as the headquarters for Operation Callisto. All summoned Gamma and Beta-Class personnel must meet in Cell Q-01 before 12/30/2000. No means of transportation is specified, but they must act individually until they reach the Cell.\n\n**5. Step 00/659**\n\nGamma-Class Agent Silas Isaacs reports the presence of a nymph[[footnote]]Tree spirits originating from Greek mythology, semi-human with plant-like characteristics. Also known as dryads.[[/footnote]] who frequents the town of Leonidio, Greece. The anomaly in question is a Dryad-Type parahuman and belongs to the group of SCP-4500-A instances. Isaacs must continue her undercover investigation in the town and compile a list of people in the town with whom she has or intends to befriend.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-00/659-004\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Received Date:** 12-07-2000\n> \n> **Author:** Intelligence Agent Silas Isaacs\n> \n> **Report:** The nymph, who calls herself Eurydice, has a clear predilection for humans. In public she is polite and at the same time extremely kind. All the inhabitants of Leonidio interpret the existence of nymphs favorably, including her... That is, even though nymphs, as a non-human race endowed with intelligence, are as dangerous as other parahumans, they believe humans and nymphs can get along and cooperate to create a better society. That hope was already denied by the human Greeks 2000 years ago.\n> \n> In a corner of the city there is an antique store run by a man named Timón. Eurydice usually spends a lot of time there, sometimes taking Timon with her to unknown places. Perhaps he is the forbidden love of the non-human, and perhaps he is the man who the secrets of her and the world in which she lives. Fortunately, he is almost as tall as me and has a good build... the goal has been set.\n\n**6. Step 00/701**\n\nThe weaponry that will be used in Operation Callisto, set in an ancient town on the Greek border, must conceal its characteristics as a weapon as much as possible, allow remote deployment to reduce the number of troops, and still deliver results. Delta Command proposes an [[[arcadia-hub|Arcadia]]]-made nomenclative hazard that meets these conditions. In other words, a subspace truck loaded with three \"Centipede\" arcade machines published in 1980, which have been anomalously modified by Arcadia (with demonic circuits installed), must travel from Cell B-04 in Athens to Cell Q-01 in Tripoli. The transport is assigned to Gamma-Class Agent Cassian Jaruzelski. During operation, the truck may be used for any purpose.\n\n**7. Step 00/712**\n\nGamma-Class Special Agent Faisal Bashar will prepare an outline of Operation Callisto and send it to Delta Command. The deadline will be 12/20/2000.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-00/712-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 19-12-2000\n> \n> **Author:** Special Agent Faisal \"Altair\" Bashar\n> \n> **Report:** I have attached the outline of Operation Callisto. It may seem absurd, but I assure you the operation will be a success. It won't even come to light that we were the main culprits in the burning of Leonidio by the Centipedes of Arcadia for at least five years.\n> \n> I hate the existence of parahumans from the bottom of my heart. Although they are not humans, they imitate human society, claim to have the same rights as humans, and claim to rule the world as well as humans. We must rid the Earth of the parahumans... and the evil ones who are allied with them. The absolutism of human society, which is beginning to shake from the collapse of Poland, must be rebuilt here and now. Otherwise, the day will surely come when humans will be exterminated... [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/r-sinano-chuo-co-jp-2025-02-10-mt119ng I do not want Cairo to experience again the many tragedies that will occur in the future]. Sooner or later, the Foundation and the Coalition will become puppets of another race... so we have no choice but to do it. We will show that we are proud of those who once were the Foundation.\n\n**8. Step 00/755**\n\nDelta Command is authorized to conduct Operation Calisto on 25/12/2000. The Gamma-Class operative leading Operation Calisto must submit a report on the results of the operation to Delta Command by 26/12/2000, the day after the operation.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** POR-00/755-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Post-Action Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 26-12-2000\n> \n> **Author:** Intelligence Agent Silas Isaacs\n> \n> **Report:** The \"Altair\" operation was a masterstroke. I asked for reinforcements from Eurydice and her men in the Elm Forest, in front of the Gate of Hades, with the excuse of containing the hordes of Arcadia Centipedes that were devastating the town of Leonidio. And the mythical monsters came out of the forest in droves. But even monsters are just beasts, and they can't stand up to electronic beings made up of large voxels.\n> \n> The nymphs' secret weapon was a giant milky-white goddess in war armor, only this one had the power to fight the Arcadia Centipedes. As the goddess's spear pierced the centipede's torso in a straight line and watched as each voxel of the centipede's head began to disintegrate into small mushrooms, the fighting goddess disappeared, as if her work was done. That was the perfect opportunity. It was terrible to see Eurydice's silly face when she realized that her beloved Timon, for whose protection she had risked her life, was actually an impostor, and she saw me leave there. It's a shame I can't show her to Command, because Vasiliy reduced her to a cloud of blood shortly after.\n> \n> As a trophy, they gave me a [[[scp-2910-jp|golden apple]]] Eurydice had. Apparently it served as the heart of the goddess Eris. I hope to have the approval of the Command.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** IPO-00/755-002\n> \n> **Document Type:** Post-Action Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 26-12-2000\n> \n> **Author:** Combatant Vasiliy Kiriakov.\n> \n> **Report:** Traveling with the Arcadia Centipedes was a bit of a disaster, but I still think it was a wise decision to continue standing on the slippery surface of voxels that move so violently until the right moment to close the operation. It took me a bit of time to blow up all the buildings in the town or fill them with mushroom-shaped boxes, but I was able to carry out my task methodically once I entered into a one-on-one battle with the goddess Eris. I was successful thanks to the espionage skills of Silas, who displayed a highly precise disguise, and the sagacity of Altair, who foresaw the success or failure of a complex operation. It was an honor to work with him.\n> \n> Hunting sorcerers who control pagan deities was a staple of big game hunting even during the era of the [[[gru-p-hub|GRU Division P]]], but it is not difficult to carry out. In order to undo the witchcraft, all I have to do is fire multiple salvos from my Jorka.[[footnote]]It means \"fir\" or \"Christmas tree\" in Russian. A multi-load pistol in Kiriakov's possession.[[/footnote]] I have slaughtered countless humans who have confronted my comrades in this way... And why would I show mercy to a strange demonic tribe that would turn against human society itself, let alone my comrades? I was determined to leave no trace of my target from head to toe, and I did just that.\n> \n>I must apologize for having disposed of Leonidio's sole survivor on my own when returning from a mission. Despite Timón's comatose state in the back of the truck, he showed psychometrically detectable alterations[[footnote]]Device that reads the surface emotions of a touched object. Its accuracy is equivalent to that of a level 1 psychometrician and is used for simple tests.[[/footnote]] at his level of consciousness... I wanted to rule out the possibility of eavesdropping by entities from the dream world and the like. If you have the opportunity to amnestize Silas, I would like you to obtain the details of how to enter the Elm Forest before doing so.\n\n**9. Step 00/758**\n\nTactical supplies recovered from the Greek mythological personification area are to be transferred to Central Cell Δ-8 in Mukalla using subspace trucks. If the load is insufficient, additional trucks must be requested from Cell B-04 in Athens.\n\n**10. Step 01/066**\n\nFour Gamma-Class Researchers from Central Cell Δ-8 are assigned to a research group to improve the production of golden apples. The project date will be 02/14/2001. Information acquired before the deadline must be sent to Delta Command.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-01/066-014\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 14-02-2001\n> \n> **Author:** Theological Researcher Jacob Montauk\n> \n> **Report:** The thoughts in the possession of the goddess Eris (or the goddess Discord) are decipherable by the general emotional ups and downs of humans who belonged to ancient, non-anomalous civilizations. This works in its favor to be able to control it with modifications of human origin. She demands simple sacrifices... The feelings of discord and strife that arise between different communities are her driving force. She appears at the scene of a dispute and when it is resolved, leaves.\n> \n> Therefore, in order to maximize the performance of the goddess Eris as a strategic weapon, it would be best to present a group of immortal entities. It should be a group made up of as diverse a range of species as possible. Sufficient offerings should be obtained from all parts of the world. Unless the sacrificial group or the heart itself is eliminated by an outside enemy, the smoke of the souls that embody Eris will not dissipate. As long as manpower is secured to guard the ritual site, the personification can then lay waste to everything and reduce the enemy forces to ashes in the blink of an eye.\n\n**11. Step 01/506**\n\nTransport semi-human tactical supplies stored in Central Cell Δ-8 to Central Cell Ι-26 in New York, USA. Gamma-Class Agent Cassian Jaruzelski must plan and execute the proper transport route.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-01/506-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 07-09-2001\n> \n> **Author:** Cassian Jaruzelski, Military Department \n> \n> **Report:** The flight of the parahumans will soon come to an end. They don't know that what they have in their hands is a [[[september-eleven-prequel|one-way ticket to hell]]]. The cryogenized and unhindered are inserted with false memories that stoke hatred towards humans so that they act as cannon fodder against hostile forces. If all goes as planned, the necessary supplies will arrive at the Empire State on the first day of the mission, or no later than the third. Since \"Charlotte\" has air superiority, it is assumed that remote control of the aircraft will be sufficient for the transfer. After a reasonable period of time, the ancient goddess will reveal her distorted form.\n> \n> 11 of September. The day when the flames of hell will burn the world. The last chance to show humanity the option to go back. Victory lies ahead.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n  first=true | last=false | hub=yes |\n  previous-url=/ | previous-title=/ |\n  next-url=/september-eleven-prequel | next-title=Frenzied Overture |\n  hub-url=/ | hub-title=Operation Calisto |\n]]",
