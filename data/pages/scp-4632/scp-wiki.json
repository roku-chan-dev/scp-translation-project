Any access to SCP-4632 is to be approved by at least two Level 3 personnel. Any subjects that come in contact with SCP-4632 and reads its contents are to be monitored for a period lasting no more than forty-eight (48) hours, after which subjects are to be administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4632 is a set of twenty-four (24) memetic posters found in the city of Sheffield, England. After increasing reports of severe derealization disorder[[footnote]]Derealization disorder is a type of dissociative disorder that consists of persistent or recurrent feelings of being detached (dissociated) from one's body or mental processes.[[/footnote]] cases in local psychiatric facilities, the Foundation recovered all 24 instances. Cross-examination of affected areas revealed that the number of SCP-4632 instances correlated with the number of derealization cases.\n\nWhen a human subject reads the contents of an SCP-4632 instance, the implantation of the following concept into the subconscious mind occurs: the current reality in which the subject lives is a dream. This effect initially manifests as a passing thought over time confusing the subject as derealization progresses. The progress of the anomaly is gradual, the median time for complete derealization is 12 to 18 months. Subjects with diagnosed mental illnesses prior to contact see an increased rate of derealization.\n\nAffected subjects are careless and as such show little to no interest in real-life events; justifying their disinterest by their purported dreaming state. Previously normal subjects affected by SCP-4632 have been seen engaging in activities such as extreme sports, violent crimes, reckless behavior, public indecency, and Class-A felonies.\n\nAny digital copies of any SCP-4632 instance exhibit no anomalous properties.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n+ [[size 80%]]{{**TESTING LOGS - SCP-4632**}}[[/size]]\n\n> **Subject:** D-14802\n>\n> **Description:** Subject was exposed to an SCP-4632 instance.\n> **Time since initial contact:** 5 minutes\n> ----\n>\n> **Dr. Klein:** Please state how you are feeling, D-14802.\n>\n> **D-14802:** Fine?

The subject was detained without resistance and brought to Site-64 for interrogation. POI-4632's medical records show that he has been diagnosed with chronic clinical depression, schizoaffective disorder, and depersonalization disorder. He has a record of twenty-seven (27) involuntary hospitalizations for mental health-related crises.\n\nSubject displays low-level reality-bending abilities; he claims this is because he has gained control over his \"dream.\" It is hypothesized that extended exposure to SCP-4632's effects may contribute to slowly increasing ontokinetic abilities; due to the fact this is the only affected subject to display these types of abilities, he is considered the originator of SCP-4632.
