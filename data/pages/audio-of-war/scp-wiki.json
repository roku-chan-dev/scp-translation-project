This is imperative, if either side is able to get ahold of these objects, why... it could mean something even worse than nuclear war. We cannot allow this to happen.\n> \n> Take a good look around gentlemen, it is with these men that you'll be working for years, perhaps even decades. This is a lifelong job, but a necessary one. The human race needs you to protect it from destroying itself. You are a member of the Foundation now, sworn in to protect anyone and everyone from the threat of a looming apocalypse.\n> \n> Site-76 houses a number of important anomalous objects, including some psychic and memetic. Therefore it is important that you all remain focused, because you never know when a memetic visual might come into your line of sight, or a psychic machine might override your mind!\n> \n> Remember gentlemen that this site is top secret on a need-to-know basis, and anything you encounter here remains here. Even something as insignificant as the type of tree you see outside this window could give away our position to a looming superpower.\n> \n> Now, as with all sites of this nature, it is entirely possible that a breach may occur requiring the detonation of a 20 megaton nuclear warhead, sitting right now underneath our very feet. In this case all personnel are ordered to evacuate the site immediately. In some cases we may need to detonate the warhead before all personnel have evacuated. You gentlemen have been instructed on this before, and I trust you are willing to sacrifice your lives to contain the monstrosities we hold here.\n> \n> We thank you for joining the ranks of the Foundation, and hope you have a good day. That is all.\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[In the Shadow of a High Wall]]] | [[[the-coldest-war-hub|Hub]]] | [[[SCP-2350]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Salman Corbette]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** introtosite76.mp3\n> **Author:** [[*user Salman Corbette]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/audio-of-war SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
