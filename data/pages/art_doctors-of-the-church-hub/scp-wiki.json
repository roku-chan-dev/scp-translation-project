I thought that coats of arms would add to the pseudo-medieval fantasy of it, although for some of the factions a flag felt more appropriate.\n\nThe basic summary of the canon is that it's 800 years since the end-of-the-world, and it's been rebuilt in the shadow of the Foundation, and the anomalies it failed to contain.\n\nCheck out my [[[art:locations-of-interest| Locations of Interest Artwork]]] for more flags and coats of arms for fictional places.\n\n[[=]]\n+ North America\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"art-container\"]]  \n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Adoctors-of-the-church-hub/Holy-Foundation.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Holy Foundation\nThe Coat of Arms of the Seven Continental Provinces depicts the same emblem used by the Holy Foundation before the Great Breach - three arrows piercing a circle.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Chaos-Insurrection.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Chaos Insurrection\nSome claim the arms of the short-lived Chaos Insurrection were an ancient symbol from before the Great Breach, others simply regard it as a twisted distortion of the Holy Foundation's emblem. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Free-Cities.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Free Cities League\nWhen declaring their independance from the Holy Foundation and creating their own independant alliance, the Free Cities took inspiration from the legendary Thirteen Colonies of old America.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Free-Portlands.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Free Portlands\nAfter changing their names to connect to the ancient ruins of Three Portlands, the Free Portlands adopted a new symbol celebrating their new freedom.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Kannada.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Kannada\nThe Arms of Kannada incorporate the rainbow and the maple leaf, powerful symbols from the time before the Great Breach.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Romania-Nova.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Kingdom of Romania Nova \nThe mammalian kingdom's coat of arms depicts the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1845 noble founder of the Vulpine dynasty], with the white and gold cross behind symbolising his devout Catholic faith.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art1\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Valravn-Rus.svg width=\"250px\"]]\n++ The Valravn Rus'\nThe circular shields of the Valravn Vikings frequently feature symbols representing Norse gods, particularly the Valknut of the god Odin.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"art1\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Thereven-Khanate.svg width=\"300px\"]]\n++ The Thereven Khanate\nThe battle-standard of the Mongols of the Midwest takes its inspiration from the past, with thirteen stripes of red and white harkening back to the flag of the American Empire. The use of a square within the flag references the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mongolian_flags#Historical_flags banners of the ancient Khans] of Central Asia.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ Seven Continental Provinces\n[[/=]]\nThe area within the Seven Continental Provinces (SCP) was once the eastern United States of America, and while that past is not forgotten, memories of Ancient America are gradually becoming more myth than history. As a society with only Medieval technology, the people of the SCP primarily rely on travel along rives, lakes or coastlines, as overland travel is long and arduous.\n\nEach Province has its own Prince, with subordinate Barons, Dukes and Lords, but all swear loyalty to the Holy Foundation and devoutly follow the Veil. This gives the Holy Foundation both temporal and spiritual power over the SCP. The Council of Overseers have deposed many Nobles for treachery or heresy in the past, never struggling to find someone professing greater loyalty to claim their position. \n\nThese are mostly just made for fun, the exact borders and name of the Provinces would probably change over time. I think this is a plausible way to divide up the eastern USA into seven geographic/cultural regions, but I'll admit I mostly decided on names and locations so that I could have fun making Coats of Arms.\n[[div class=\"art-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Sebord.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Sebord\nThe Province of Sebord covers the East Atlantic Coast of the SCP, from the Chesapeake bay down to the Eastern coast of Florida, extending inland as far as rivers are navigable. The Ancient ruins of cities like Washington D.C. still stand as a reminder of the past, in much the same way that the ruins of Rome cast their shadow over Medieval Italy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Hartland.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Hartland\nCentering on the Ohio River Valley, the Heartland of Ancient America continues to be the breadbasket of the SCP, exporting corn and wheat to the neighboring provinces. Many farms were abandoned after the Great Breach and subsequent decline in population, and so the area has gradually been reforesting, creating wild regions full of deer, boar, wolves and bears.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Misipi.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Misipi\nThe Mississippi River and its many tributaries enable travel by boat deep into the heart of the American continent. The Principality that controlled them was once the largest Province of the SCP, and although much of the land they claimed to the West was only sparsely populated, tolls on river traffic provided its rulers with great wealth. While the arrival of the Thereven Khanate took much of this territory from them, the River Lords that remain are fiercely protective of their southern holdings in Mississippi and Louisiana.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Sothgul.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Sothgul\nThe Southern Gulf consists of the coastal regions of the Deep South, as well as Western Florida, although their claims of sovereignty over the Neverglades are more theoretical than practical. Cotton and rice continue to be staple crops, but transport by sea is complicated by their proximity to the many pirates of the Caribbean.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Gretlak.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Gretlak\nThe southern shores of the Great Lakes have access to vast amounts of fresh water for farming and fishing, and merchants profited greatly from travel across those waters, trading freely with the people of Kanada. However, the arrival of Valravn raiders caused great turmoil in the region, and while they were driven off, the area is now threatened by the encroaching Thereven Khanate.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Aplachia.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Aplachia\nThe inland Appalachian region is the wildest and least controlled of the Seven Continental Provinces. The dense forest and high mountains make establishing centralised power near-impossible, and the rugged hills make it hard to farm anything other than sheep. While many are eager to claim its resources through mining, transporting minerals out is challenging. Many of the Province's inhabitants only nominally follow the Veil, and the region is a haven for heretics, witches, orcs and other Expunged.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/Province-of-Yankia.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ Yankia\nThe northernmost Province of the SCP covers the area known as New England, as well as the Ancient ruins of York and Jersey. These Yankees have a strong local identity, and were briefly independent from the SCP, until the Chaos Insurrection was ruthlessly crushed. Like the English of old, the inhabitants of this province have a contentious relationship with their French and Scottish neighbours (Quebec and Nova Scotia), resulting in numerous border disputes.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ Europe\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"art-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"art\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/art:doctors-of-the-church-hub/German-Occidental-Confederation.svg height=\"250px\"]]\n++ The German Occidental Confederation\nThe Imperial Arms of the Confederation that rules Central Europe feature an eagle perched atop the globe, still marked with the pentacle of their precursor, the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-hub-page Global Occult Coalition].
