I didn't know why we stuck to repeating these ceremonies with a vague effect, containing an anomaly with a vague description. These ceremonies are also so gentle that they are not like those typical ARED-managed ceremonies I have handled, with surprisingly almost no blood and sacrifice can be seen. I asked the principal at that time, and his answer was only one sentence: We don't have enough manpower to consume.  \n\nBut every ceremony and the corresponding pattern has its own //meaning//, and I didn't know this until later. The ceremonies have a close relationship with other contained projects, but the truth is more than that. We are using these ceremonies to build a virtual //religious performance//, decrease the possibility that the anomaly escapes being contained, and pray that luck is on our side. We only know that in any case, 7802's failure in containment should be avoided, but we are unable to do so. Among countless reality iterations, we are alive now just because we are lucky enough.\n[[>]]\nPrincipal of SCP-7802\nResearcher Cheng Haoyu\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div style=\"height: 8rem;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7801]]] | SCP-7802 | [[[SCP-7803]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n====\n> **Filename:** 01.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/01.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 02.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/02.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 03.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/03.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 04.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/04.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 05.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/05.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 06.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/06.svg\n\n> **Filename:** 07.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/07.svg\n\n> **Filename:** anti.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/anti.svg\n\n> **Filename:** uso.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/uso.svg\n\n> **Filename:** omega-titlo.svg\n> **Author:** [[*user dr-hormress]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7802/omega-titlo.svg\n====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
