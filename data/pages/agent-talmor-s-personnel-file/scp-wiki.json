  "content": "**Full Name:** Millicent Karina Talmor (Call sign: Whitewings)\n\n**Occupation:** As a field agent, Agent Talmor primarily investigates rumours and media reports of potential SCPs. She seems to have a remarkable tendency to encounter such things simply by acting on impulse and \"doing what feels right.\" This has led some researchers and members of command staff to speculate that the Agent is herself something akin to an SCP.\n\n**Security Clearance Level:** 3\n\n**SCPs documented:**\n\n[[[SCP-014]]] - The Concrete Man\n\n**SCPs discovered:**\n\n--SCP-135-- - Ship-in-a-bottle Village\n\n**SCPs contained:**\n\n--SCP-188-- - The Paper Flier\n[[[SCP-709]]] - The Eye of the Forest\n--SCP-712-- - The Show Gets Into You\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
