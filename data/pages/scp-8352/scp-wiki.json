In the background, a transportation vessel is being driven to a separate extraction point by Cadet Andre ███████.| width= 100]]\n\n+++ **Special Containment Procedures:**\n\nSCP-8352 is to be frequently monitored by- at the minimum of three (3) vessels at a time with a maximum of five (5) vessels at a time- light, amphibious assault craft[[footnote]] the exact model used being the PV-281 Finnish Patrol Boat. [[/footnote]] which are to patrol regularly inside as well as around the surrounding areas of the anomaly. Any vessels inside of the anomalous zone must not travel faster than cruising speeds, which is needed to maintain volumes under ninety-five (95) decibels. It is mandatory that anyone entering the anomalous zone with authorization are to be searched for firearms and other items capable of producing sound over ninety-five (95) decibels which are to be secured in Site-931 stationed approximately twenty (20) kilometers to the east from the easternmost point of anomalous activity.\n\nFormer Head Researcher, Senior Researcher McKinley ███████- as of June 25th, 2027- has prohibited any testing within 30 kilometers of the anomalous zone, including all territory inside of the anomalous zone until further notice.\n\nAs of June 29th, 2027, utilization of lethal force- including the use of firearms- is permitted against any personnel who are unable to identify themselves properly. Termination is advised to be held outside of the anomalous zone.\n\n+++ **Description:**\n\nSCP-8352 is an area located in the Finnish Archipelago, approximately 30.5 kilometers in length and 23.2 kilometers in width, encompassing a nearly rectangular domain. Primarily occupied by water, the only known areas of dry land include two islands, one relatively small atoll, size unknown, the other a traditional island, size also unknown, covered mainly by a semi-deciduous forest. The primary anomalous features which first concerned the SCP Foundation were the colors of the leaves present in the forest. Upon arrival at SCP-8352-2, the Island, trees inhabiting the island were reported to 'sport colors that were off season' according to Senior Researcher McKinley ███████ on June 8th, 2027, as he visited the Island via Helicopter along with three other Site Personnel- pilot, copilot, and Botanist- from the recently erected Site-931. The leaves, which were intended to be green according to the nature, were instead orange, red, and brown leaves as seen from the Helicopter. According to Botanist Liam ████ who had been on the helicopter,\n\n> \"The trees seemed to being going through a winter season despite the climate, shedding their leaves much earlier [than is] normal.\" (June 8th, 2027, Botanist Liam ████.)\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2d/Lempisaari%2C_Naantali%2C_Finland..jpg/800px-Lempisaari%2C_Naantali%2C_Finland..jpg | caption=Last Known Photograph Captured before entering Anomalous Zone Via Helicopter| width=200]]\n\n+++ **Addendum:**\n\nThe authorization of the use of lethal firearms is due to a data leak involving Confidential Information on multiple anomalies and Site Protocols whose information was stored in Site-931 as paper copies. It is reported that Senior Researcher McKinley ███████ authorized the creation of paper copies and use of paper copies, the information, as said before, breached along with multiple subsequent Site System Failures, approximately eleven (11). This eventually led to the termination of Senior Researcher McKinley ███████ on June 25th, 2027. Junior Researcher Klara ███ was later promoted on June 27th, 2027, then transported to Site-931. All orders directed by the former Senior Researcher are to be maintained by Foundation Personnel despite his termination with the exception of the creation of physical documents at Site-931, all physical copies digitally replicated before being destroyed. The being responsible for the breach is suspected to be an unidentified Mobile Task Force Operative returning from patrols through the anomalous zone.\n\n++++ SCP-8352-1, \"Atoll\"\n\nInformation on the Atoll, known as SCP-8352-1, located in the Southwestern sector of SCP-8352, is --not available-- limited due to the fact that SCP-8352 was only discovered recently on June 17th, 2027, soon after the discovery of SCP-8352 and subsequent discovery of SCP-8352-2 on June 7th, 2027. Upon initial discovery, Mobile Task Force Delta-4- was dispatched for a quick, improvised containment before proper, official containment was able to take place. Previously mentioned Secure containment has not yet been applied due to internal difficulties and seemingly low risk, this is relevant to both the \"Atoll\" And \"Island\".\n\nHowever, it is known that one is able to view the entirety of SCP-8352-1 from any point of the landmass as reported by passing Site Personnel on routine Patrol. The existence of the Atoll also confuses Site Researchers due to the fact that coral is not able to amass in Scandinavia due to the cool temperatures present in the region.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 REQUIRED\" hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n[[include component:image-block | name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Unidentified_fossil_found_at_California_beach.jpg/960px-Unidentified_fossil_found_at_California_beach.jpg?20080226181803 | caption=Image Taken By Private Ela ████ during a routine patrol through SCP-8352-1| width=]]\n\nThe previous image shows an unidentified fossil (now classified as SCP-8352-1-A) found on the atoll- found on June 13th, 2027, by passing Mobile Task Force Patrols. Private Ela ████, a member of the patrol which discovered the anomaly, is reported to have contacted the fossil with all fingers on both hands according to other members present.\n\nThe subject was soon diagnosed with an illness similar to leprosy, specifically severe in the fingers soon after returning to Site 931. All efforts to treat the illness were proven futile, eventually resulting in the amputation of her fingers and parts of her face, the hands are shown below. Private Ela died soon after from a condition akin to dysentery, also untreatable. Specific dates and images related to her death and illness were among the paper copies stolen before digital transcription. Medical Officials conclude that the fossil is the origin of the previously mentioned lethal symptoms.\n\n> Sorry, I can't show the hands for [DATA EXPUNGED] and I think it looks gross, even though that wouldn't even matter.\n> - Dr. Eddy Joseph\n> \n> {{JUNE 18 2027}}\n> {{12:59 PM EEST}}\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++++ SCP-8352-2, \"Island\"\n\nThe Island, known as SCP-8352-2- known informally among Site Personnel as \"Smokey Bottom\" due to its rather foul-smelling odor as told by Mobile Task Force Operatives sent to SCP-8352-2- is located in the Northeastern sector of SCP-8352. Due to the size of the island and close proximity to Site-931, priority is given to SCP-8352-2 instead of SCP-8352-1 in terms of research and interest. Upon investigation, botanical specialists have concluded that fauna on the island is further reminiscent of North American plants rather than Finnish plants. Organisms found on the Island do not classify as any known species despite similarities among discovered plant life with North American plants, such examples include- but are not limited to- the Red Pine, native to Eastern North America, and Wild Maize, native to South-Central Mexico. Known animals were not spotted during the first visit to the island. Mobile Task Force Operatives were and are currently being sent in intervals in an attempt to find any animal life or other present anomalies.\n\n-----\n\n+++++ First Expedition\n\nThe first expedition left Site 931 at approximately 4:00 PM on June 12th, 2027. On the boat were Sergeant Quinn ██████, and Cadet Faye ████████. The pair never reached the island due to a malfunction in the engine of the transportation vessel. According to Sergeant Quinn ██████, Cadet Faye █████████ reportedly repaired the vessel. Both decided to head back due to the fact that the sun had started to set by the time their transportation was repaired. Radio communications were not functional at this time for unknown reasons and audio recordings proved illegible due to the high winds disrupting most sound.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 REQUIRED\" hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\nDuring travel to SCP-8352-2, Sergeant Quinn ██████ reports that abnormal sounds were emitted from the island, similar to that of their own engine. The sound was described as grainier and much louder than that of their own vessel despite originating from the island which was 'a large distance away', similar to an echo as described by Cadet Faye █████████. The engine soon broke down after the anomalous sounds. It is assumed that the volume of their vessel was too high, prompting Former Head Researcher McKinley ███████ to enact a policy to restrict the amount of volume made from any Site Personnel and Personnel Equipment. No instances of the event have occurred since.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n+++++ Second Expedition\n\nOn the second expedition into the Island, led by Sergeant Jude █████, five members, including herself, of the stationed Mobile Task Force arrived at SCP-8352-2 at approximately 12:30 in the afternoon, June 14th, 2027. Cadet Andre ███████ was reportedly left at the boat as a 'guard'. Those who ventured into the forest were Zoologist Paul ██████████, Corporal Sadie ██, and Botanist Liam ████, who had been on the first expedition to the island. It is reported that soon after, approximately 'half an hour' after disembarking, a singular animal track was found near 'large fallen tree', reported by another to be found in a muddy clearing. All individuals had a varied understanding of the event when speaking of the animal track, specifically the location. According to most- excluding the Corporal, who had arrived later than the rest of the quartet, the animal track was stepped on accidentally by one of the members, this was enough to damage the evidence beyond recognition. Cadet Andre ███████ reported to having driven the transportation vessel to a separate extraction point for the convenience of the group. Audio Recording is Available below.\n\n> Please do forgive, Audio Recording will not be available due to [DATA EXPUNGED] and a transcription will soon be available. The image mentioned below was taken down for suspicion on authenticity of the finding.\n> - Site Secretary Marlin Moore\n> \n> {{JUNE 15 2027}}\n> {{8:41 PM EEST}}\n\nFortunately, the Zoologist had already examined the track, later creating the following image as a recreation. It is concluded to be 'quite alike' to a Bobcat’s Left Hind Foot after examination by a team of specialists in the field of Felinology[[footnote]] The Study Of Felines [[/footnote]].\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"CLEARANCE LEVEL 3 REQUIRED\" hide=\"ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n+++++ Third Expedition\n\nThe third expedition into SCP-8352-2 was again led by Sergeant Jude █████, accompanied by the same Botanist, Zoologist, and Cadet except for the Corporal who had been honorably discharged on June 15th, 2027 as requested for unknown reasons following the second expedition. The group was tasked with searching for other signs of animal life. According to Botanist Liam ████, the time was approximately 6:45 in the morning, June 17th, 2027 when they had reached the Island from Site-931. The Cadet had stayed behind like before to guard their vessel. Audio Recording cut off soon after venturing out of sight into the island. The Sergeant is said to have sustained an Ischemic stroke according to the Botanist. The Zoologist, Paul ██████████, was not on the vessel upon their return and the Botanist did not recall Zoologist Paul ██████████ ever following him back as he assisted the then immobilized Jude █████, claiming that the Biologist had parted shortly before the traumatic event. Sergeant Jude █████ is currently hospitalized in Site-931. Due to the severity of the stroke, Sergeant Jude █████ has contracted aphasia[[footnote]] Medical Condition where the patient is not able to properly communicate due to possible brain or vocal damage. [[/footnote]] and other complications[[footnote]] Inability to travel by foot without the use of crutches or assistance from other personnel. [[/footnote]] according to medical officials and is unable to properly communicate with Site Personnel. All activity on all expeditions were held in great suspicion following this event.\n\n-----\n\n+++++ Fourth Expedition\n\nThe fourth expedition is currently ongoing and is tasked with locating Zoologist Paul ████████ on SCP-8352-2. No results have been made so far. The team consists of Staff Sergeant Marco ████, leading the expedition, accompanied by recently promoted Private Andre ████████, Private Kat ███, Private ███ ████, Cadet Notre ███, Private Tjaden ███████, and finally, Cadet Jamison ██████████. The Task Force set foot on SCP-8352-2 on June 18th, 2027. As of June 20th, 2027, their transportation vessel was reported missing. The group of eight (8) has not been seen from patrols around the island. It is suspected that their group is near the center of the island, which is said, from previous expeditions, to have a large dip in the geography, akin to that of a valley, containing drinkable water. No source of food is present other than Wild Maize. No groups from previous expeditions report consuming any edible plant life or water while on the island with the exception of Sergeant Jude █████ during the second expedition who had consumed a corn kernel at some point during the expedition.\n\n-----\n\n> There has been no sign of the group who have been reported missing for 7 consecutive days.\n> - Site Secretary Colin Phelan\n> \n> {{JUNE 25 2027}}\n> {{7:01 PM EEST}}\n\n-----\n\n> There has been no sign of the group who had been reported missing for 12 consecutive days.\n> - Site Under Secretary Colin Phelan\n> \n> {{JUNE 30 2027}}\n> {{4:47 AM EEST}}\n\n-----\n\n> There has been no sign of the group who had been reported missing for 22 consecutive days.\n> - Site Under Secretary Colin Phelan\n> \n> {{JULY 10 2027}}\n> {{5:11 PM EEST}}\n\n-----\n\n> Research on SCP-8352-2 has been shut down to refocus on SCP-8352-1.

His 'edits' were kept for technical reasons by order of Head Researcher Klara ███.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n> It is my deepest regret to inform everyone that most transcriptions will not be available for another week as of July 20th. Analysis is slow in the Scientific Department of Site 931. Please do bear with me, we are currently analyzing, sorting, managing, and transcribing Audio from the expeditions. As we may all understand, the Site Equipment is limited and is of low quality, especially for those in the Mobile Task Force, specifically with communications systems including audio which we are currently studying. As my mother used to say, 'Haste makes Waste'. Audio Transcription of all Expeditions are to be soon provided after thorough analysis and careful transcription.

Two were held and have been concluded, the third was postponed to the first (1st) of October, 2027, and a fourth is scheduled for October 26th, 2027.\n\n+++++ First Site Congress Related to SCP-8352, June 16th, 2027\n\nPresent in the Congress are Head Researched McKinley ███, Botanist Liam ████, [DATA EXPUNGED], Site Secretary Marlin Moore, Site Under Secretary Colin Phelan as transcribe, Site Administrator Johan-Daw Johnson, Private Andre ████████- who was still a Cadet during the Congress, Researcher John ███, Researcher Suse ████, and Researcher Valentino █████.
