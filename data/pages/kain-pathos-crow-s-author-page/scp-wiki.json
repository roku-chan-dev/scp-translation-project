Most recently a Level 4 cleared operative.\n\n**Facility Location:** Bio-Research Area-12\n\n**History:** Born in 19██ in ████, Kain graduated with honors in biochemistry, advanced robotics, and psychology, in the University of ██████ in 19██. He was approached by the Foundation later on in the same year. Since then he had done several post research reports on numerous SCP.\n\nHis most notable exploit was [DATA EXPUNGED], in which he was turned into a dog.\n\nSince then, he has avoided being terminated no less than four times, despite being in several situations that warrant an immediate termination, each time somehow either appealing to high command, or displaying invaluable (and irretrievable) knowledge. As a direct result, he is under constant monitoring, and is disallowed any unwatched or longterm contact with the outside world.\n\nHe has since become one of the chief librarians on the Foundations Staff, maintaining and updating the library quite regularly.\n\nHe has also set up a notebook, similar in style to Dr. Snorlison.\n\n[[[Crow's Note's and \"To Do List\"]]]\n\nHas written reports on the following SCP:\n\n* [[[SCP-035]]] Possessive Mask\n* [[[SCP-040]]] Evolutions Child\n* --SCP-040-1-- A Pet Chair\n* [[[SCP-063]]] \"The World's Greatest Tothbrush\"\n* [[[SCP-073]]] \"Cain\"\n* [[[SCP-076]]] \"Able\"\n* [[[SCP-089-ARC]]] \"The Littlest Browbeater\"\n* [[[SCP-143]]] The Bladewood Grove\n* [[[SCP-154]]] Offensive Bracelets\n* [[[SCP-158]]] The Soul Extractor\n* [[[SCP-244-ARC]]] The \"Egg Walker\"\n* [[[SCP-275]]] Ironskin\n* --SCP-309-J \"Ol' Red\"--\n* [[[SCP-322]]] \"Grow Your Own Castle\" Kit\n* [[[SCP-326]]] The \"Extra\" Skeleton\n* [[[SCP-3467-J]]] Six foot Man-Eating-Chicken\n\nHas written the following extra curricular reports.\n\n* [[[Experiment Log 040]]]\n* [[[Experiment Log 158-AA]]]\n* [[[Experiment Log 158-AG]]]\n* [[[Experiment Log 914-THETA]]]\n* [[[Olympia Project]]]\n* [[[The Warrior and the Dragon]]]\n* [[[Of Able]]]\n* [[[Target Practice]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Kain Pathos Crow]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 1204587834329-new.jpg\n> **Name:** 1204587834329-new.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kain-pathos-crow-s-author-page\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
