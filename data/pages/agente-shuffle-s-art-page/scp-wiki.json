Welcome to my art page! Here you'll find SCP fanart!\n\nthat means fanart of the SCP universe, not fanart that is considered an SCP item\n[[collapsible show=\"right?\" hide=\"oops \"]]\n[[=image http://filedmns.wikidot.com/local--files/archivos/KeterEntos.png ]]\n**__SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:__** Currently, URA-643216 is contained as it is displayed in this document. Research is underway to determine how to both contain it and assign it a slot in the SCP Item Database. Meanwhile, URA-643216 will remain on display in this document, and any edition to it is restricted until further notice.\n\nIn the event URA-643216 successfully breaches containment and manifests itself on the Internet, Mobile Task Forces [[[task-forces#mu-4|Mu-4 (\"Debuggers\")]]] and [[[task-forces#gamma-5|Gamma-5 (\"Red Herrings\")]]] will be deployed to enact Protocol MEMORIAE ##dimgray|{{(see below)}}##.\n\n**Protocol MEMORIAE:** A Mu-4 cell has been designated to supervise the Internet, mainly art pages and forums; if a gallery is created under the name of \"Agente Shuffle's Art Gallery\" or similar, Mu-4's cell will alert Mu-4 and Gamma-5 to proceed with the protocol.\n\nOnce the alert has been received, Mu-4 will create an empty file in the RAISA Database with the exact name of the current URA-643216 iteration, which will have the appearance and format of a digital art gallery[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] The exact file format is available in **__Document URA-643216-SUP-3__**. [[/span]].\n\nAfter the file is created, the original URA-643216 iteration will be deleted from the page and the RAISA file will be left unobserved for around 5 minutes. Meanwhile, Gamma-5 will track down the page activity and identify the users that may have been exposed to the anomaly's content to amnesticize them, either digitally or physically.\n\nAny repost of the gallery or clone page created involving URA-643216 is to be deleted as well to allow the anomaly to be transferred to the containment file.\n\nIf URA-643216 has not been transferred to the RAISA file after 10 minutes, or if a different iteration is created online, causing the contained instance to breach containment, Protocol MEMORIAE is to be repeated.\n\nNo other file referring to URA-643216 by any name is to be created if URA-643216 is currently in containment to avoid the risk of an accidental containment breach that might alter permanently the affected file(s). Because of this, and due to the nature of its content, URA-643216 has been classified as Level 5/RAISA.\n\nThe [[[AIAD Homescreen|Artificially Intelligent Conscripts]]] Atheris.aic, Itzel.aic, Ente.aic, Faree.aic, and Talkartoon.aic have been tasked to search any possible textual mention to URA-643216 on the Internet and delete them as soon as possible to avoid any containment breach.\n\nThe search for PoI-643216-1 is currently ongoing, and any personnel member who may have information about the individual's identity or location is advised to report it to the Records And Information Security Administration's Local Site Representative.\n\n**__DESCRIPTION:__** Initially discovered in 2007, Unregistered Anomaly #643216 refers to an anomalous Internet phenomenon through which a web page titled \"Agente Shuffle's Art Gallery\" will be generated. It may also manifest itself with other similar and slightly derogatory names, but always with the term \"Agente Shuffle\" included in the title and URL.\n\nURA-643216's most notorious anomalous property is its content, as it features illustrations of several classified SCP Objects and Persons or Groups of Interest in various artistic movements, mainly in a minimalistic style with influences from retro, vintage, pop, and grunge art. These illustrations are spontaneously generated at random intervals, usually no more than one month between each other.\n\nIt is currently unknown how URA-643216, if sapient, or its possible creator, PoI-643216-1 ##dimgray|{{(see below)}}## has knowledge of Groups and Persons of Interest, SCP Items, and the existence of the Foundation in general.\n\nURA-643216 has also the capacity of manifesting in any digital media if mentioned or described in any way that is considered to be exclusive of or directly related to it within 10 minutes, completely erasing any content previously displayed in said media. While it has been possible to retrieve the erased content, it presents several distortions, errors, and remains of URA-643216's textual content.\n\nIf affected, the file mentioning URA-643216 will be restructured to resemble the appearance of an art gallery on digital media, with minimalistic visual decoration and several \"sections\" in which URA-643216's contents are displayed.\n\nIt should be noted that despite being able to \"infect\" other digital documents, the original URA-643216 iteration will not disappear from its original source. To achieve this, the affected file should comply with several visual and technical requirements, but will only allow one instance to be transferred, and the creation of more files will not affect additional instances.\n\nIn all its manifestations, URA-643216 will claim to have been created by a subject named \"Agente Shuffle\", designated temporarily as \"PPoI-643216-1\"[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Potential Person of Interest. If any connection with other anomalies or abnormal events is confirmed, PPoI-643216-1 would be reclassified as PoI-1124. [[/span]], and investigations are underway to determine its identity and location, as well as possible associations that might give them access to Foundation's classified data.\n\nWhile it was originally believed that URA-643216, and therefore PoI-643216-1, were somehow related to one or more anartist groups or movements, such as GoI-1991 (\"[[[are-we-cool-yet-hub|Are We Cool Yet?]]]\") or [[[scp-4485|its]]] [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-202 variants], several anart researchers have claimed URA-643216's visual style, as well as the general tone and purpose of the illustrations, do not match with the popular tendencies said groups show.\n\nAs of 2015, URA-643216 does also generate abstract illustrations in JPEG or GIF format categorized as \"Memetic Agents\"; however, all the images generated have no memetic effects and are completely inoffensive.\n\nNone of the designations given to said memetic agents corresponds with the standard designation system used by the Foundation.\n\n**__ADDENDUM 01:__** Investigative report and assigned personnel's conclusions about URA-643216, as of November 24th, 2016.\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 1px #A9A9A9; margin-right: auto; margin: 1em 3em; width: auto; padding:16px; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom:4px; background: #E8E8E8;\" ]]\nDespite the efforts of me and my team to get information about this \"Agente Shuffle\", we haven't managed to get any remarkable details about them. No one seems to be even familiar with the name, no other works, no galleries, not even a biography or a reference in another fellow's work.\n\nWhich kind of triggers a subtle alarm.\n\nLet me explain. Every AWCY? member seeks, along with other things, to be recognized in the anartist community, be it mainstream or \"underground\". This does not only apply to this group and extends to the whole artistic movement worldwide, of course, but it's particularly strong here.\n\nTo this day, I haven't found a single anartist that prefers to remain anonymous; they want to be as known and renowned as they can, and as known and renowned the Veil allows them to be. This doesn't occur here; all the info we get about the mysterious author of this work is a pseudonym, \"Agente Shuffle\", and very few times, a signature. Needless to say, we haven't found any signature that resembles it.\n\nOther than that, there is nothing. No author's words, no small biography, no declaration of intentions, no commentaries. Jeez, not even the characteristic acronyms that form \"AWCY?\" are present here. So, what are we looking at?\n\nCould this be a new rising movement within the Group? I doubt it; movements do not just appear, they are built throughout the years. Could it be, on the other hand, a new ideological thing? Reject the identity of the author to make the works themselves stand out? Perhaps, but again, I doubt it. This is a difficult matter.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not saying that URA-643216 is not an AWCY? creation, I'm just saying that it is pretty unlikely to be the case. It, of course, could be, but that just doesn't seem to fit with AWCY?'s general tone and purposes.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- {{[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/bestiario-expresionista Dr. Amalia A.

Yes, they have made .exe files and other digital media, but they haven't messed with the Internet itself, and obviously not like this.\n\nWhy they haven't is unknown to me, but it doesn't seem to be a thing by now. Neither in the other Division's jurisdiction, whom I consulted before writing this report. For some reason, Are We Cool Yet? doesn't seem to be interested in this kind of matter in any way.\n\nBut hey, don't take my word for it. I'd suggest you discuss this issue with somebody that has in-depth knowledge of the group; after all, I'm just a young engineer and technician.\n\nHowever, if I may give you some advice, I recommend you pay a little more to whoever might be in charge of doing the research. You'd be looking through archives that cannot be safely stored, or searching for people who probably aren't even in this dimension right now; and trust me, nobody wants to do the heavy work.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- {{[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-236 Agent Yuni]; [http://scp-zh-tr.wikidot.com/ ZH Division]'s Technical Department Staff}}//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 1px #A9A9A9; margin-right: auto; margin: 1em 3em; width: auto; padding:16px; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom:4px; background: #E8E8E8;\" ]]\nYes, I have to say this doesn't //feel// like something made or even related to Are We Cool Yet? for many reasons, but I'd say the main one is that whoever made this anomaly knows much more than any AWCY? member would ever know about the Foundation or the anomalies we contain.\n\nI mean, you know what I'm talking about. They have knowledge of, uh, [[[scp-173|The Statue]]], for example, or other classified anomalies that have been created by them or are otherwise related to the group, but this... this goes far beyond that. Even if-- even if AWCY? knew more than what they seemed to, how could somebody have access to all that information?\n\nBesides, if AWCY? was aware of all of this, don't you think they'd do //something// with that? I'm pretty sure that... they just wouldn't act as if nothing had happened once they got access to so much information. Just think about it. Many AWCY? members would have any sort of interest-- personal, economic, social, etcetera, in the things we currently contained. I mean, we have //people// of theirs in our facilities!\n\nSo, that leaves us with three options: A, they are not aware of any of this. B, they know, but don't care. C, they know and care, but are keeping a very elaborated lie to stay under the radar. And I think we both know which one it is.\n\n[[>]]\n//-- {{[[[system:page-tags/tag/doctor-everwood#pages|Dr. Justine Everwood]]]; [[[groups-of-interest|GoI]]] Specialist}}//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 1px #A9A9A9; margin-right: auto; margin: 1em 3em; width: auto; padding:16px; padding-top:4px; padding-bottom:4px; background: #E8E8E8;\" ]]\nHm.

Despite this additional instance having all the requirements to trigger a containment breach, the contained iteration did not break containment.\n\nNotably, this new instance, designated as URA-643216-A, was entirely in Spanish and featured different art pieces depicting anomalies that were contained by the [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/ SCP Foundation Hispanic Division], as well as personnel hired in said Division.\n\nTask Forces Gamma-5 and Mu-4 were quickly deployed to enact Protocol MEMORIAE, but URA-643216-A did not transfer to the RAISA file created and, instead, the current URA-643216 instance did. Several other attempts were made, including the creation of a Spanish version of the containment file, with the same result.\n\nGamma-5 quickly tracked down the activity of the gallery and was deployed to amnesticize the exposed users as soon as possible, while Mu-4 would manually transcribe the contents of URA-643216 before deleting it; however, when the Task Force attempted to access the gallery, an error message from [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/como-sobrevivir-a-una-ruptura-espacio-temporal-en-un-chedrau Scanlan, Conyer & Phaserfield Inc.], a Hispanic Foundation's Cover Company, was displayed, not allowing the Task Force to enter the page.\n\nAfter 2 hours, the error message was retired, but the page was also deleted. Note that, during all these 2 hours, all Hispanic Division Representants refused to give any kind of information about URA-643216-A or the assumed containment efforts carried out by them.\n\nThanks to several informants and personnel hired in both Anglosaxon and Hispanic Divisions it is now known that, indeed, URA-643216-A was successfully contained by the latter, although the process through which this was achieved is unknown, as well as other details of its containment or copies of the containment file.\n\n[[module ListPages limit=\"1\" category=\"*\" order=\"updated_at desc\"]]\nAs of %%updated_at|%m/%d/%Y%%, the Hispanic Division has refused to provide any substantial information about URA-643216-A, and the reasons for this are unknown.\n[[/module]]\n\n[http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/vertedero-artistico Investigations on the matter are being carried out.]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-left: solid 8px #000000;\"]]\n{{**FOOTNOTES**}}\n**1.** The exact file format is available in **__Document URA-643216-SUP-3.__**\n**2.** If a relation with other anomalies or abnormal events is confirmed, PoI-643216-1 would be reclassified as PoI-1124.\n**3.** Anart Containment and Restoration Team.\n**4.** Ms. Berlot requested to write her investigative record in paper instead of sending it via electronic mail or through an interview session.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << __URA-643215__ | **{{URA-643216}}** | __URA-643217__ >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP Art]]\n[[=]]\n+++ For stuff directly related to the SCP Foundation!\n----\n+ SERIES I\n[[/=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ MINIMAL +\" hide=\"- or anything that doesn't have outlines -\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=http://filedmns2.wikidot.com/local--files/dokumentoz/daybreak.jpg | caption=[[[ShaggyDredLocks' Proposal]]], by [[*user S D Locke]] | width=\"1px\" | align=\"center\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://filedmns.wikidot.com/local--files/archivos/Sauel.jpg | caption= [[[SCP-179]]], by [[*user Dr Reach]] | width=\"1px\" | align=\"center\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://filedmns.wikidot.com/local--files/archivos/SunSauel.jpg | caption= [[[SCP-179]]], by [[*user Dr Reach]] | width=\"1px\" | align=\"center\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://filedmns.wikidot.com/local--files/archivos/BlackMoon.jpg | caption= [[[Tanhony's Proposal II]]], by [[*user Tanhony]] | width=\"1px\" | align=\"center\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ DETAILED...?
