It's your old pal Daveyoufool, breakin' the fourth wall all over your binch faces.\n> \n> Look, I'm not about to tell you that there's a set in stone format for TotleighSoft. That would imply Mr. Gock knows what he's doing.\n> \n> Instead, I'll tell you that there are just two cardinal rules to work around:\n> \n> **1. P. Hudson Gock is not evil.** He's not \"good\" in any sense of the word, but he has no ulterior motives for running this anomalous software corporation. His moral philosophy is a combination of three things: 1. a hasty back-jacket description of the American Dream, 2. an unknowable eldritch alien apex predator's idea of \"fair competition\", and 3. extreme naivete & dumbassery. In his own ham-fisted way, he genuinely wants to use anomalous consumer electronics to help Americans help themselves.\n> \n> **2. TotleighSoft's borken engilsh shulod be stil recoganzible enugoh to be red.** The most effective way of doing this is to rearrange the letters in a word while still keeping the first and last letter. (Also, Mr. Gock never spells TotleighSoft or his own name incorrectly.)\n> \n> Other than that... have fun.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
