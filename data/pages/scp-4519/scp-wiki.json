Refer to the [[[saphir-centre|SAPPHIRE Dossier]]] for further information.[[/footnote]] Limited information on the anomaly exists; known details are that the head is being stored within a glass jar filled with preservative solutions, [[[grant-request-post-mortem-neural-preservation|connected to a device which enables cognitive functions]]]. The involvement of spectral and psionic phenomena is suspected.\n\nThe head generates a field of an undetermined nature (designated SCP-4519-A), presumed to either encompass the entire planet or shift in position over landmasses periodically. On exposure to SCP-4519-A, individuals belonging to anomalous religious organizations will grow progressively doubtful of their beliefs, reaching points where they either reject these beliefs or are rendered comatose. In the latter cases, the individuals awaken after one to three days, and on a consistent basis, claim to have realized \"the error in their ways\" when pressed.[[footnote]]Reports of hallucinating Carl Sagan's face are common as well, though this is not seen as abnormal by the exposed individuals.[[/footnote]]\n\nSince April 2019, SAPPHIRE has used SCP-4519 to launch attacks against adherents of religious Groups of Interest. In most cases, SAPPHIRE will raze religious sites and key locations before proceeding to loot any available anomalous artifacts. The motives behind these raids are unclear.\n\nHow SAPPHIRE developed the object is inconclusive. The degree to which SCP-4519's current cognitive functions mirror those of Carl Sagan before his death is considered low.\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n= [[span class=\"h2\"]]Addendum 4519.1[[/span]]\n= [[span class=\"h3\"]]HISTORY AND INVESTIGATION[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\nOn December 21, 1996, at 9:31 AM, mortuary technicians failed to locate the late Carl Sagan's cadaver at the Fred Hutchinson Research Center, where it was placed in cold storage the previous night. Instead, technicians discovered a life-sized doll, mimicking Sagan's likeness, filled with interstellar particulate matter and trace amounts of metallic hydrogen.\n\nIn early 2000, the Department of Analytics became aware of recent SAPPHIRE mobilization. This primarily involved the movement of SAPPHIRE forces into China -- an area with little-to-no past SAPPHIRE action -- and the emergence of novel Carl Sagan lectures being given by Tibet-local Buddhist monastic orders, despite Sagan's demise four years prior.\n\nAgent Adrien Daniau was dispatched to the region to infiltrate SAPPHIRE under the guise of a group researcher. With assistance from covert cybernetic implants and Analytics personnel, he was able to gather files on what would later become designated as SCP-4519.

The lab itself was older still, with stone walls and decaying floors. Unbelievers stood in throngs. They weren't moving. At the back of the room sat Carl Sagan's decapitated head, floating in a translucent sapphire holding tank. \n@@ @@\nI reached out. My arm stretched, fifty feet away. He spoke. He was in a keyless prison, he said, and they had cooped up his mind like livestock. He didn't want to continue on. He wanted a release. A return to stardust. We finally touched, or so I thought. A glassy veil seized me. He told me to come. To find him.\n@@ @@\nI clawed, whisking the veil like soap, and it latched onto my arm. I jolted back, arm receding, and my body grew. The room shrunk beneath me -- a discarded dollhouse, behind hallways and retaining walls, pastures, trees, and cliffs. A violet shroud choked the world.\n@@ @@\nThere was brown and gray and bloody red: A village. A rural area -- Nepalese? Tibetan? Perhaps Manchurian? A chain of mountains shrunk into pebbles. Distant crowds screamed, and then they were ants, by the millions.\n@@ @@\nThe translucent blue punctured under my weight. I fell through the clouds and landed back into myself.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter allegedly channeling with Carl Sagan, Maclear worked with global positioning personnel to narrow Sagan's location down to an approximate area. By April 26, the rural mountainous slopes of Qinghai Province, China were selected as the most likely location, prompting mobilization to that area.\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n= [[span class=\"h2\"]]Addendum 4519.3[[/span]]\n= [[span class=\"h3\"]]UPDATES[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"lite-header\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=Becuan_valley_earthquake_building.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=[[span style=\"font-size: 120%;\"]]Aftermath of a SAPPHIRE attack on a religious site.[[/span]]‏‏‎ ‎\n]]\n\nSCP-4519 has been used by SAPPHIRE in a series of assaults against the //Huǒjù zhi Zi// occult organization.[[footnote]]Also known as the Children of the Torch. The group's religious beliefs focus on the worship of avian entities and the Sun, which is given a deific status.[[/footnote]] Alongside highly organized attacks on //Huǒjù zhi Zi// temples, mass numbers of group adherents have abruptly lost their beliefs, claiming to be \"enlightened\" while repeating quotes from Carl Sagan. Non-human anomalies connected to the group have also been impacted, with [[[SCP-1428]]] having entered a coma and [[[SCP-2995]]] erratically decreasing and increasing in gravitational strength.[[footnote]]Cover-ups for the abrupt faults in SCP-2995-1 and the ensuing damage to surrounding civilian centers are underway.[[/footnote]] This poses a severe shift in SCP-4519-A, from affecting only human minds to having the potential to affect all sentient life.\n\nIn addition, undercover agents within other occult groups have reported phenomena similar to SCP-4519-A occurring, leading to widespread panic and anger towards SAPPHIRE. Isolated incidents of non-anomalous religious adherents losing their beliefs are being investigated for connections.\n\nOn April 27, Agent Daniau was found by personnel stationed in Sichuan Province, China. Daniau was garbed in a blue and white robe, designed to restrain his hands behind his back, with defaced Foundation armor strapped onto both arms in such a way as to further restrain movement. At the time of discovery, Daniau was suffering from severe dehydration and malnourishment, with damage to his clothing indicating a long duration of time spent in the wilderness. Below are recordings taken of his speech soon after recovery.\n\n> //No, you... You don't get it. He's everywhere. They pushed that head to its breaking point and before it could explode they wrapped it tight around the world... One of the nails went through my head. Tried to tug it out but... It's there. It's there, it's there all right.//\n\n> //No... That girl kept crying and I couldn't do anything about it. Wouldn't let me forget it. Or doubt it. They wrapped his face tight over us, after all. No,// Cosmos //is still mapping out our path in the sky.//\n\n> //There's a spiderweb and we're the starstuff in its linings.//\n\nAgent Daniau subsequently entered a vegetative state. Psychic procedures performed by Agent Maclear have, in all cases, observed Daniau sitting in a dark room in front of a CRT television containing Carl Sagan trapped within, banging his fists against the screen.\n\nAs of May 4, OPERATION: MENDAX SWITCH has been launched. Mobile Task Force Alpha-10 (\"Extraordinary Evidence\") is being assembled to carry out counteroffensive measures against SAPPHIRE, intended to locate the facility SCP-4519 is stored in and neutralize the anomaly. Networks of combat forces in China have been mobilized, and all sites in the region are under Level-IV (High Alert) status.\n\nA non-zero risk of a //Shin-Sophist// \"Global Religious Dissolution\" Scenario exists at this time.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"saphir-nav\"]]\n= << [[[Chimes Broken]]] | [[size 120%]][[[non-prophet-organization-hub|ACT I: GENESIS]]][[/size]] | Coming Soon... >>\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-4518]]] | SCP-4519 | [[[SCP-4520]]] >>\n[[/div]]",
