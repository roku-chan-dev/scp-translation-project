In order to prevent this, remaining ##48f|Blue Group## operatives should attempt to apply logic to the actions of ##b46|Red Group## members, initiating conversion.\n\n**Description:** From an external, human-centred perception, SCP-6381 is a logical irregularity. Internally, SCP-6381 presents itself as an understanding of otherwise illogical phenomena. SCP-6381 is a nerve cluster located throughout the small intestine, in which an individual can be metaphysically [[[SCP-2719|inside or outside]]] of. \n\nBy metaphysically locating oneself //inside// SCP-6381, they may express pro-apocalyptic ideation along with illogical behaviour that they perceive as highly logical. {{Don't be fooled.}}\n\nThose who are //inside// SCP-6381 are classed as the ##b46|Red Group## and those who are //outside// SCP-6381 are classed as the ##48f|Blue Group##.\n\n**##48f|Blue## Data logs:** \n||**Subject**||**Action**||\n||Dr. Tia||Wandered into the staff break room and got a coffee from the coffee machine. He then sat down at the table and drank it for 4 minutes.||\n||Dr. Tia||Spent 2 hours sitting at their desk, searching the internet for Gibbon videos. Dr. Tia was subsequently reprimanded.||\n||D-225||Sat in their cell for 36 hours before they were brought out to perform a test.||\n||D-225||Incinerated after death.||\n||Soda can||Emptied and thrown away to be recycled.||\n||Empty coffee cup||Emptied and thrown away to be recycled.||\n||Recycling centre||Used to sort out incoming rubbish to their respective categories.||\n||Ballpoint pen||Was thrown away once the ink had run out.||\n||Paperwork||Shredded once it was deemed unimportant.||\n||Lab coat||Put on during research sessions and then taken off and hung up once the session had concluded.||\n||Contamination||Dealt with by D-class personnel.||\n||Area-140||Personnel not present at the location as it would constitute a breach of containment.||\n||Breakroom sofa||Dirty and old from years of wear and tear.||\n||Standard Humanoid Containment Cell||Contains humanoid SCPs.||\n||Ventilation system||Allows personnel to breathe properly.||\n||Cleaning agent||Used by personnel to remove contaminating chemicals.||\n||Glass of water||Has been sitting on a desk for a couple weeks now, collecting dust.||\n||Water||Old and dirty.||\n||Cadaver||For now it's fine, but it will begin to putrefy. D-class personnel are required to remove the body to prevent contamination.||\n||List||Items on the list should be designated either blue or red depending on the subject. This task has already been fulfilled.||\n\n**##b46|Red## Data logs:**\n||**Subject**||**Action**||\n||The colour red||Scary but comforting, as all the pieces come together.||\n||The colour black||Does it howl?||\n||Fairness||To play fair, one must be higher on the food chain.||\n||Cadaver||Allowed to rot because it doesn't move nor speak.||\n||Small Spaces||Crawled through as the other side is much better than the dark.||\n||D-225||Kidnapped before incineration, because cadavers must be left to rot.||\n||Dr. Tia's Lunch||Destroyed so D-225 can consume it in the afterlife.||\n||Necromancy||Used to fulfil the goal.||\n||The colour scarlet||Symbolic of difference.||\n||A God-shaped hole||Thrown into to return to us.||\n||D-225's decaying organs||Replaced.||\n||D-225's desiccated skin||Replaced.||\n||D-225's congealed blood||Replaced.||\n||D-225's dead tissues and cells||Replaced.||\n||D-225||Replaced. Relived. Revived.||\n||The number 5||A good tool.||\n||The goal||To prevent the end of the world.||\n||D-225's Importance||He's inside and outside.||\n||Humanity||Success.||\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << [[[SCP-6380]]] | SCP-6381 | [[[SCP-6382]]] >>[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
