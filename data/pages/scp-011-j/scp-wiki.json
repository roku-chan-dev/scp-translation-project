Where’s it gone?)\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Any sighting of SCP-011-J must be acknowledged verbally, in a high-pitched voice, with all words sharply enunciated. Subjects must react in the same way when witnessing SCP-011-J disappear.\n\n**Description:** SCP-011-J is the 6-month-old offspring of Foundation Doctor Jones, which has the anomalous power of dematerialising whenever an observer obstructs their vision with their hands, or nearby furniture. When visual contact is re-established, SCP-011-J rematerializes, to the great surprise and relief of onlookers.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Testing Log\" hide=\"- Testing Log\"]]\n\n> **Doctor Jones:**\n> Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!\n> Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!\n> Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!\n> Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!\n> Where’s SCP-011-J? There he is!\n> \n> Where's he gone!? Where is he?\n> \n> I've got your nose!\n> \n> (Doctor Jones places his thumb between his middle and index fingers, creating the illusion of the amputation of SCP-011-J's nose.)\n> \n> What are you doing there? WHAT YOU DOING!?\n> \n> I'm gonna eat those little legs! Yes I am!\n> \n> (SCP-011-J gives a positive response to a simulation of being eaten, suggesting masochistic tendencies.)\n>  \n> **Conclusion:** SCP-011-J is anomalously adorable.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n**Addendum:** “Doctor Jones is to start working //way// fewer hours, and take some paternity leave! SCP reports are //not// how normal people interact with their kids, for fuck’s sake…”\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
