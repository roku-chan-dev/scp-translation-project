  "content": "[[iftags +component]]\n+ How To Use\nIt is **mandatory** for all articles to have the licensebox citing all images, texts, and excerpts utilized within the piece. \n\nAdd this to the bottom of the page, below the wikiwalk footer:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> **Filename:** @@\n@@> **Name:** (if different from filename)@@\n@@> **Author:**@@\n@@> **License:**@@\n@@> **Source Link:**@@\n@@> **Additional Notes:** (Optional)@@\n@@> **Derivative Of:** (Situational)@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nLet's break down what each of these sections mean.\n\n> @@> **Filename:** @@\n\nFilename is, as the name implies, the name of a file in your article. As per Tech Policy, all files on pages must have a file extension appended after the name. This means that if you upload an image to your article and call it {{mycoolimage-1}}, you are not following the rules. A correct name would be {{mycoolimage-1.png}} or {{mycoolimage-1.jpg}}, or any other similar filetypes. If you are unsure what the file extension of something you intend to upload is, you can check it by right clicking on the file and then pressing 'Properties.'\n\nIf you are quoting from a text, write something along the lines of {{Excerpts taken from //Book Title Here//}}. Do not input the entire quote here, just where it comes from.\n\n> @@> **Name:** (if different from filename)@@\n\nThis field is where you put the original name of the file. For example, let's say I wanted to use [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kievitsbloem.jpg this image in my article]. The name of the image is {{Kievitsbloem}}, as is listed on the page. I would then copy that and paste it onto this field. Do not include its file extension (jpg, png, etc).\n\nIf you are quoting from a text, list its title here.\n\nIf you are using your own creation, you may title it however you please, or you may exclude this field completely.\n\n> @@> **Author:**@@\n\nThis field is where you acknowledge the original creator of the media you are using. Looking at [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kievitsbloem.jpg the same previous image], we can see that the author of the file is {{Rasbak}}. This means I would have to put that name in this field. If you are using commissioned work, you must still cite the original creator.\n\nIf you are using your own creation, insert your username.\n\n\n> @@> **License:**@@\n\nIn this section, you must write the file's attached license. This information is typically accessible on the page you are sourcing the file from. [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kievitsbloem.jpg Following the same example as before], we can see that this particular image is CC BY SA 3.0. Keep in mind that all files must be compatible with the site's license (CC BY SA 3.0) and follow the [[[Image Use Policy]]]. \n\n\n> @@> **Source Link:**@@\n\nThis field is typically a direct link to the page where you are taking the file from. Just copy the url from the address bar and paste it here. So for example, using the same image as above, I would put {{@@[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kievitsbloem.jpg Wikimedia Commons]@@}} in this field. You should replace the text of the hyperlink with the name of the webiste you are taking your file from.\n\nIf you are utilizing your own work, link to the page you are posting and title it {{SCP Foundation Wiki}}. However, if you are using your own media that you uploaded to a site like, say, Flickr, you must still follow this step.\n\n> @@> **Additional Notes:** (Optional)@@\n\nThis is where you enter any additional information about the file. For example, if it is a composite image, you must state that this file is made up of two different images, and cite all images used in its creation. \n\n\n> @@> **Derivative Of:** (Situational)@@\n\nThis field is only applicable if you are using an image or other form of media that was derived from two or more sources. For example, a mashup would have to cite all of its images here. In order to be properly licenseboxed, copy-past the following syntax underneath the {{Derivative Of:}} line.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@> **Name:**@@\n@@> **Author:**@@\n@@> **License:**@@\n@@> **Source Link:**@@\n[[/div]]\n\nFrom there, you simply fill in the information as you would any other file.\n-----\n\n+ Examples\n\nHere is an example of a licensebox used in [[[SCP-7726]]], which cites an image from Wikimedia Commons.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> **Filename:** gun.png@@\n@@> **Name:** Beretta 90TWO closed.JPG@@\n@@> **Author:** Praiyachat@@\n@@> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0@@\n@@> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Beretta_90TWO_closed.JPG Wikimedia Commons]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nHere is an example of a licensebox used in [[[SCP-6999]]], which cites an audio clip.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> **Filename:** hymn.mp3@@\n@@> **Name:** Nearer, my God, to Thee@@\n@@> **Author:** Conway's Band@@\n@@> **License:** Public Domain@@\n@@> **Source Link:** [https://www.loc.gov/item/jukebox-14234/ Library of Congress]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nHere is an example of a licensebox used in [[[michael-the-kiler|michael the kiler]]], which cites an author using their own creation.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> **Filename:** dakilla.jpg@@\n@@> **Author:** [[*user ratking666]]@@\n@@> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0@@\n@@> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/michael-the-kiler SCP Foundation Wiki]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nHere is an examle of a licensebox used in [[[SCP-7000]]], which cites an author using an image derivative of other images.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> **Filename:** WettleBomb.jpg@@\n@@> **License:** CC BY 2.0@@\n\nThis image is a composite of:\n\n@@> **Name:** 130320-Z-TK422-652@@\n@@> **Author:** Oregon National Guard@@\n@@> **License:** CC BY 2.0@@\n@@> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/32031029@N03/8576628356 flickr]@@\n\n@@> **Name:** High Noon Nap@@\n@@> **Author:** OakleyOriginals@@\n@@> **License:** CC BY 2.0@@\n@@> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/47264866@N00/13279780754 flickr]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nHere is an examle of a licensebox used in [[[SCP-173]]], which does not have any images or other citations, but includes an author listing.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box@@\n@@|author=Moto42]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\nHere is an example of a licensebox used in [[[deesoafs|Doctor Everwood Eats Shit On A Frozen Sidewalk]]], which does not have any images or other citations and does not include an author listing.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n-----\n\n+ A Word On Excerpts/Quotes\n\nIf you are using excerpts from passages or quotes, you must still cite them. \n\nHere is an example of a licensebox used in [[[SCP-7010]]], which cites excerpts from a book.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]@@\n@@> This article contains an excerpt from //[*https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Leviathan Leviathan]// (1651) by Thomas Hobbes (Public Domain).@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n-----\n+ A Note On Co-Authoring\n\nIn the event you co-author an article with someone or someones, you can add the following syntax to the top of the licensebox to indicate multiple authors.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box@@\n@@|author=User1, User2, User3]]@@\n@@[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]@@\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[size 75%]]This page was originally created by CityToast and was updated on 1/27/2024 by Uncle Nicolini.[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= Ignore everything beneath this text.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[/iftags]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-backend\n|author={$author}\n|author=%%created_by%%]]",
