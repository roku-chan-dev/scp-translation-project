When SCP-6114-1 is revived,  it should be informed of why it was revived, and be made aware of any relevant information pertaining to the current state of the world.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6114 is a ritual that will revive any deity, but only at a fraction of its original stature. An item significant to the entity's background should be placed on floor markings resembling several concentric circles, engraved it the ground, and filled with bovine blood. The exact process of SCP-6114, however, is redacted under O5 Command request as to not permit any instances of SCP-6114-1 being summoned without approval. After the ritual is finished, the SCP-6114-1 instance's name will appear in dust of an unidentifiable make up.\n\nSCP-6114-1 are the revived fragments of several religiously significant entities, otherwise known as gods belonging to their own religions. SCP-6114-1 instances can only be revived if captured in items heavily associated to their backgrounds and history. SCP-6114-1 instances are fully capable of thought and vocalization, permitted they originally possessed these traits. To note: SCP-6114-1 instances cannot be summoned if the original entity still exists.\n\n**Addendum 6114.1:** Project Spearhead is a tri-function of: the Dept. of Tactical Theology, the Dept. of Anomalous Communications and Relations, with the Dept. of Anomalous Weapons Development leading it.
