Displaying information\"]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2284\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2284 is to be held within a standard humanoid containment chamber within Hall ██ of Site-██ adjacent to the cell of SCP-2148. SCP-2284 is to remain on the same meal and fitness schedule as [[[SCP-2148]]], and action is not to be taken when the two interact. On the seventeenth of every month, Doctor Everett Mann is to interview SCP-2148.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2284 is a male humanoid of Indian descent, and is the identical brother of SCP-2148. The words \"Mr. Lie, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment\" are tattooed upon SCP-2284's left bicep.\n\nAll declarations and statements made by SCP-2284 are objectively true.\n\nSCP-2284 is physically incapable of making false statements.\n\nTesting has revealed that its inability to make false statements apply to its writing.\n\nThere is nothing abnormal about the document recovered from SCP-2284, and it has been confirmed SCP-2284 had never been in a Foundation facility prior to its containment.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\nD-22841: Hey. I gotta read you these questions and write how react. They have it set up so a computer will type out everything we say. That alright?\n\nSCP-2284: Why wouldn't it be?\n\nD-22841: Right. So. How are you today, 2284?\n\nSCP-2284: Couldn't be better. How are you?\n\nD-22841: Eh, could be better.\n\n[Both laugh]\n\nD-22841: Right, so first thing. In 1995 there was an incident featuring SCP-2148, and--\n\nSCP-2284: What's that?\n\nD-22841: Um. One sec, let me double check the number. Ah, right. Blindfolded guy, calls himself Mister Stripes.\n\n//(SCP-2284 sits up)//\n\nSCP-2284: //(Speaks urgently,)// What happened to Stripes?\n\nD-22841: Nothing to him, more that he did something. I think. Or the doctors think, I guess. This black bar showed up on the cameras for a while, and then at the end he had this photo. Later, when they looked at his Little Misters list, your name was blacked out.\n\n//(SCP-2284 becomes progressively more relaxed during explanation)//\n\nSCP-2284: //(Relieved?)// Oh, is that all? Stripes himself is alright?\n\nD-22841: So far as I know. You didn't have anything to do with that?\n\nSCP-2284: Absolutely not. I can't imagine what kind of sly trickster would even attempt such a feat.\n\nD-22841: Alright. Let's see. Are you aware of your anomalous properties?\n\nSCP-2284: Anomalous properties?\n\nD-22841: Magic stuff, basically. Um. It says you can convince anyone of anything you say.\n\nSCP-2284: How would they know, if anyone I speak to is affected?\n\nD-22841: Read transcripts, I guess. Which is what I'm here for.\n\nSCP-2284: They think of everything, don't they? I don't think I'll be able to outwit these people. By that logic, any response I give to you is worthless to you?\n\nD-22841: Yeah. But the doctors will know what's really up.\n\nSCP-2284: Why don't I try circumventing that little issue, then? Would I be sitting here calm and collected if I didn't belong here?\n\nD-22841: Wouldn't that still just be you trying to convince me of something?\n\nSCP-2284: But did I actually tell you anything, or simply ask you a question? You're still able to question this conversation [Speech to text program was unable to give punctuation to this dialogue.]\n\nD-22841: Was that a question?\n\n//(SCP-2284 smiles)//\n\nSCP-2284: That's a good question isn't it [Speech to text program was unable to give punctuation to this dialogue.]\n\n//(\"That's a good question, isn't it?\" or \"That's a good question. Isn't it?\" Fuck I don't know doc)//\n\nSCP-2284: Are there other questions?\n\nD-22841: Can you tell me about the other Little Misters?\n\nSCP-2284: Who do you have so far?\n\nD-22841: Stripes, obviously. One second. Chameleon. Lost. Brass, Moon, and Forgetful.\n\nSCP-2284: I'm sure Lost makes your jobs really easy. Where did you find Brass?\n\nD-22841: Let's see. Church of the Broken God.\n\nSCP-2284: Did they think he was part of their god? Man, they could not be further from the truth. \n\nD-22841: What about the others? You seemed concerned about Mister Stripes earlier.\n\nSCP-2284: How could I not be? Don't brothers have to stick together?\n\nD-22841: Aren't all of you sort of siblings? I think I remember reading that in a briefing dossier. \n\nSCP-2284: Yeah. Sure. Totally keen on the idea of being brothers with a corpse with a key in its back. Did you know I don't always know exactly what's going to come out of my mouth? Do I operate on some kind of universal truth rather than what I understand to be the right answer? Would you believe that I once said Stripes wasn't my brother? He isn't my brother! He's definitely not my biological sibling. So why doesn't he seem to realize that we're actual twins, truly blood related? Do you think he just sees me as one of nineteen siblings?\n\nD-22841: Didn't you just-- You know what, let's just move on. What can you tell us about Doctor Wondertainment?\n\nSCP-2284: His name is Isiah Crawford, and-- //(Confused,)// Wait, how did I say that? What did I tell you just now?\n\nD-22841: That his name is Isiah Crawford.\n\nSCP-2284: //(Speaking to itself,)// That is his name, though... The man known as Doctor Wondertainment has always been Doctor Wondertainment. Is that the game? Doctor Wondertainment was never Isiah Crawford. Doctor Wondertainment is just the name of a company. Doctor Wondertainment is a male human. What the fuck did the old man do?\n\n//(I can hear what he's muttering, but I'm not sure what he means. I'm getting a really bad migraine as he talks)//\n\nD-22841: What are you talking about?\n\nSCP-2284: Are you familiar with Doctor Wondertainment? Do you think that name is referring to a specific person, or the company?\n\nD-22841: Both. You just said that. Doctor Wondertainment is a male human named Isiah Crawford who is just a company that was never Isiah Crawford [Speech to text program was unable to give punctuation to this dialogue.]\n\nSCP-2284: Are you okay? Oh, what am I thinking? I'm sure you just got tired of talking, that's all. You have no reason to pass out from mental strain.\n\nSCP-2284: Can someone help him?\n\nSCP-2284: You're not going to die. Oh fuck I killed you, you're going to die because of me. Oh, you're not, are you? You have to die at some point, don't you? Probably during something like a mass termination at the end of the month. Because that makes sense.\n\nSCP-2284: Are you guys coming? Can't you see this guy needs help?\n\nSCP-2284: Oh, what's this paper you were writing on?\n\nSCP-2284: No, just looking.\n\n//(You cannot consciously see any of the text I am writing. You feel compelled to follow the instructions relevant to you.)//\n\n//(If you are a D-Class you need to give this note to a researcher.)//\n\n//(If you are a researcher without the ability to edit the files of SCP-2284, you need to give it to a researcher who can.)//\n\n//(If you are a researcher capable of editing the files of SCP-2284, you need to scan this part of the note directly into the transcript without rewriting it yourself. You feel like you should conduct an unscheduled, unmonitored interview with SCP-2284 when possible. You need to bring a second recording device in addition to the typical interview recording devices.)//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum:** Below are interviews that will only appear if the user logged in is Dr. Everett Mann.\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-2284-a/MrLieFile2.mp3]]\n\nData partially corrupted.
