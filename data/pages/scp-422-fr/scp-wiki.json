It is inscribed with the phrase \"We all have our little secret\".\n\n]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-422-FR\n\n**Threat Level:** Orange ##orange|●##\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Any instance of SCP-422-FR appearing in the intSCPFN database must be located and deleted by the web crawler Charlie-6 (\"CYBELE\").\n\nAny staff member experiencing the effects of SCP-422-FR must directly report to their direct Human Resources Officer via an event report. To learn more about the online content they viewed in the days leading up to an event, the person holding the device hosting the SCP-422-FR instance will be subject to an interrogation. Staff members who have suffered the effects of the same instance of SCP-422-FR may, if necessary, request to no longer work together. If experiencing trauma, they are encouraged to make an appointment with their referred psychiatrist.\n\nAt this time, SCP-422-FR does not seem to have appeared on the Internet. The web crawler Charlie-5 (\"MARIE\") is designed to monitor for and delete any potential appearances or mentions of SCP-422-FR on the global Internet.\n\nData relating to Incident 422-FR-1 are restricted to staff members with a Level 4/422-FR clearance at minimum.\n\n**Description:** SCP-422-FR is the designation for a disarmed memetic kill agent, derived from unused resources hijacked from the intSCPFN database[[footnote]]The memetic agent was initially one of the inconclusive projects of a junior researcher of the Memetics Department who was demoted and sent back to civilian life.[[/footnote]] by the Group of Interest \"Nemo and the Nautilus\", and renamed {{GREAT_TENTACULAR.hrm}}. SCP-422-FR is currently outside the control of Nemo and the Nautilus.\n\nWhile SCP-422-FR produces copies of itself that appear at irregular intervals at random database locations,[[footnote]]Most are accessible with a low clearance level and, therefore, to a large number of personnel members.[[/footnote]] its main anomalous effect lies in the computer and memetic viruses it carries. SCP-422-FR acts upon computing devices[[footnote]]It should be noted that SCP-422-FR was found on a majority of mobile phones among Foundation staff who had been in contact with it.[[/footnote]] with at least one search engine that have a private browsing function and/or allow access to darknets.\n\nIf the subject has already used private browsing or visited a darknet, a random time after the last browsing session, SCP-422-FR will display on the screen of the device using an identical reproduction of the subject's last browsing session. All the sounds emitted during the initial, non-anomalous browsing session are reproduced by the subject and the individuals in his or her vicinity by means of vocalizations and vocal mimicry. All affected individuals remain aware of what they are saying without being able to stop themselves. It should be noted that if the device is turned off, SCP-422-FR will not be able to act; however, once the reproduction of the browsing session has been initiated, it is impossible to turn off the device until it is completed.\n\nIn 96.8% of the cases, SCP-422-FR forcibly exposed Foundation staff to pornographic content privately viewed by subjects. In rare cases, the subject turned out to be an agent browsing darknets as part of his or her job and exposed staff to anomalous black market content online.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"wide-hr\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n= [ **LEVEL 2/422-FR -- END OF FILE** ]\n[[div class=\"wide-hr\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n**Addendum 422-FR.1:** Comment from the Groups of Interest Observatory\n\nBelow, the commentary of Researcher Aurélien Arjories, member of the Groups of Interest Observatory, \"Nemo and the Nautilus\" Division, recently promoted to head of operations to counter SCP-422-FR.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nBelieve me, if there's one thing I regret about my promotion to Level 4, it's learning why this anomaly exists. Why Nemo and the Nautilus got their hands on an old and even no more killer memetic stashed away in the depths of the international servers and turned it into something so evil.\n\nAfter all, we have never been used to this kind of action from them. Sure, it //embarrassed// the Foundation, but it didn't foil their plans or expose them to the wider public.\n\nI was like you. I'm talking to the Level 3 staff, who like me before didn't have access to the rest of the file. Dubious. How can you not be when faced with a document that presents an anomaly as comical as it is terrifying. But believe me, its creators know //exactly// what they are doing.\n\nIf we have to remember anything about Nemo and the Nautilus today, it's that they can be as fearsome as //useful//.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Researcher Aurélien Arjories, Site-Aleph\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wide-hr\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n= [ **LEVEL 3/422-FR -- END OF FILE** ]\n[[div class=\"wide-hr\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 422-FR.2:** Incident 422-FR.1 \"Imbach\"\n\nAt the time the anomaly was created, Nemo and the Nautilus had some control over SCP-422-FR and could trigger it at any time. The Group of Interest was able to send SCP-422-FR to the cell phones of specific SCP Foundation senior members.\n\nAlthough the IT vulnerability used by the Group of Interest was corrected shortly after the first instances were sent out, the Foundation was unable to prevent the Imbach Incident from occurring -- this incident being the first manifestation of SCP-422-FR and thus marking its discovery.\n\nBelow is a video recording of the events leading up to the incident involving former personnel member Samuel Imbach.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n[[div class=\"wide-hr\"]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n**Personnel Involved:**\n* Samuel Imbach -- Site-Beth Educational Unit Director\n* Gaes Galgata -- Site-Beth Director\n* 2 Security Officers not named here\n* 21 personnel members in various positions not named here\n\n**Foreword:** The following footage was recorded at the inauguration of the Site-Beth Educational Wing, a project to create a space for the Site-Beth Educational Unit supervised and led by Dr. Samuel Imbach. The Educational Unit follows and accompanies anomalous humanoid entities that are juveniles or in need of education. Many members of the personnel were present for the occasion, including Site-Beth Director Gaes Galgata.\n\n----\n\n= < **BEGIN LOG** >\n\n**Galgata:** Good morning to all of you. First of all, I would like to thank you for coming all the way here to this brand new space! As you know, this project is very important to us at the administration. Dr. Imbach and I are very pleased to be able to assure you that from now on our young anomalous children will have a much healthier place to live. Let me turn the floor over to my colleague.\n\n**Imbach:** Thank you Mr. Galgata. //[He clears his throat.]// As you may have noticed, the construction of this new wing has been going on for a few months, a few years now. Since the beginning, some of the people we thought were our colleagues have even had time to //leave//. But anyway, the work is now finished.\n\n//[Imbach re-reads his notes.]//\n\n**Imbach:** The entire Educational Unit would like to thank the administration of the Site as well as the OSAI teams, who have helped us a lot in designing rooms that meet the specific needs of certain anom-- Heeeeey Gregory schaaaaatz, wie geht es dir heute?\n\n//[For a few seconds, no one speaks. The eyes of the whole room are on Imbach, who blushes and looks embarrassed.]//\n\n**Galgata:** Uh, are you sure everything's okay, Sam-- WOOOOOOooo... wha-- WOOOH!\n\n//[The whole room is now focused on Galgata.]//\n\n**Imbach:** Splorch splorch... Splorch? Bitte, bitte, bitte, Sir, nicht so ha--\n\n//[One of the security officers walks towards them to try to understand the situation.]//\n\n**Officer 01:** ... Hart wie beim letzten Mal, bitte... Oh, oh, oooooh!\n\n//[Now all the staff in the room are talking, shouting, making noises with their mouths. Some staff members are running around the room to find a solution.]//\n\n**Personnel Member 01:** //[He is out of breath and inhales and exhales very quickly.]// Huuum hmpf huuuum hpmf...\n\n**Personnel Member 02:** Glargh glargh glargh glargh glargh glargh hmmm...\n\n**Officer 02:** AH AH AH!\n\n**Personnel Member 03:** Hiiiiiiiii...\n\n= [EXPUNGED FOR REASONS OF BREVITY]\n\n//[The event ends with loud, low cries and weeping. An expression of rage is visible on Imbach's face.]//\n\n= < **END LOG** >\n\n----\n\n**Remarks:** Note that one of the voices that the personnel present were reproducing or trying to reproduce was that of a male child.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n= << SCP-422-FR >>\n= [[[scp-international|Return to International Branches Hub]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** GRAND_TENTACULAIRE.hrm\t\n> **Name:** 20000 squid Nautilus viewbay.jpg\n> **Author:** Alphonse de Neuville and Edouard Riou/edited by macro_au_micro\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:20000_squid_Nautilus_viewbay.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
