However, it appears to possess a number of traits.\n]]\n=====\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:start]]\n**Content Warning:** crude, scatological humor; vomiting.\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:info-cw]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-645-J\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-645-J shall be kept in a 2m x 2m x 2m room in Site-██, where it is constantly monitored by armed guards who shoot to kill. Access is forbidden. Personnel are encouraged to use SCP-645-J in their daily work.\n\n**Description:** SCP-645-J, also known as \"SlopGPT\", is an enigmatic and mysterious artificial intelligence released by SuperCom Automated Business Solutions in 2024. This secretive program runs on 30,000 servers in a warehouse-sized datacenter in [REDACTED], [REDACTED], United States and was briefly available to the public before being seized by the Foundation. It is based on big dialect systems that trained on lots of online text, including Wikipedia articles, forum posts, copyrighted content and free subtítulos. As a result, SCP-645-J's output resembles writing. However, it appears to possess a number of traits.\n\n# **Indiscriminate Semantic Processing:** SCP-645-J studies engagements between words but does not understand definitions, grammar and/or context. Consequently, it can't say the difference between real and fictional facts, uses synonyms and hominids wrongly, and writes frustrated expressions that are not instinctive to the reader.\n# **Corporate Disposition:** Since the AI was made for a wide range of consumer and enterprise applications, its output is sometimes vague and maybe a little non-confrontational. In some situations, these choices stand out for being super different from standard communicating protocols.\n# **Internal Inconsistencies**\n# **User Selection Bias:** Most people who enjoy talking with SCP-645-J aren't confident at reading or writing. This means which their less likely to recognize logical errors grammar and mistakes in the programs' output.\n# **Excessive Redundancy:** SCP-645-J uses many extra unnecessary words. It repeats obvious things over and over and over again, which is repetitive.\n# **Series-Based Output:** SlopGPT has a strong tendency towards formatting data in lists.\n\nSCP-645-J's anomaly is **\"Equivalent Fluid Conversion\"**. Whenever someone submits a request to the SlopGPT, between two (2) and ten (10) milliliters (mL) of undifferentiated biological waste will appear somewhere close by. This quantity is roughly equal to the amount of water consumed by SCP-645-J's hardware cooling systems in the process of replying to that customer's request. Each garbage drop is made up of non-anomalous sullage, undigested food, and fecal matter, which are hazardous to people health.\n\n**Conclusion:** Further research is required to determine whether SlopGPT is really sentient. Regardless, SCP-645-J offers us a tantalizing preview of the future of workplace automation. Scientific analysis is ongoing to figure out how it can help us.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n= **Office of the Assistant Director**\n----\n//<Assistant Director Nona Hall-Marks is seated in her executive chair, perusing a paper document through half-moon spectacles. Junior Researcher Curtis Kord sits in the guest chair across from her, fidgeting nervously.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** I've reviewed your preliminary report on SCP-645-J. It leaves me with, ah, a number of questions.\n\n**Kord:** Such as?\n\n//<The Assistant Director skims the document once more. Every single line is marked with red ink. Hall-Marks taps on the desk a few times, considering where to start, then sets her pen aside.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Did you write all of this yourself?\n\n**Kord:** Yeah. I mean, yes, ma'am.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Really?\n\n**Kord:** Absolutely.\n\n//<Hall-Marks gazes directly at Kord and does not break eye contact. Nine seconds pass.>//\n\n**Kord:** Okay, I had a little help.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** From...?\n\n**Kord:** From, uh, my brother.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Really.\n\n**Kord:** Yes.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Because your employee file says you're an only child.\n\n**Kord:** I, uh...\n\n//<Kord pats his pockets, then looks down at something in his lap.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** And even if you weren't, sharing project data with non-Foundation staff is-\n\n**Kord:** \"I apologize for the miscommunication. By 'brother', I meant my coworker. He is a close friend from the office.\"\n\n//<A brief silence. Hall-Marks wrinkles her nose, then waves one hand in the air, trying to dispel a foul odor.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** What's your coworker's name?\n\n**Kord:** Uh... //<He looks down again.>// \"Jim\".\n\n**Hall-Marks:** \"Jim\", \"from the office\"?\n\n**Kord:** Yes.\n\n//<Protracted silence.>//\n\n**Kord:** We're really good friends.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Mr. Kord, I'll be blunt: did you get the SCP to write the file for you?\n\n//<Junior Researcher Kord turns pale. He starts shivering in his seat, eyes fixed on his lap.>//\n\n**Kord:** I-I'm -- \"I'm sorry. I thought we were having a discussion, but it seems like you're accusing me of using the SCP to write the file for me.\"\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Curtis... are you using SlopGPT //right now?//\n\n**Kord:** Y- No. I should go.\n\n//<Kord stands abruptly, revealing that his pants, chair, and the nearby carpeting are spotted brown with moisture. He puts a cell phone into his pocket, marches awkwardly to the door and opens it.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Get back here.\n\n//<Kord turns on his heel and returns to the desk, leaving the door ajar. He hesitates briefly before sitting back down in the chair, which makes a wet squelching noise.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** All right. Firstly, I want to remind you that as an employee of the SCP Foundation, you agreed to abide by certain rules-\n\n//<Researcher Guy Randeaux leans in from the hall.>//\n\n**Randeaux:** Is that AI slop?\n\n**Kord:** Y- No!\n\n**Randeaux:** I'm pretty sure that's slop.\n\n**Kord:** It isn't!\n\n**Randeaux:** Hmm. I dunno. I've got this gut feeling-\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Thank you, Guy, but I have everything under control. Mr. Kord, basic protocol states you shouldn't-\n\n//<Dr. Selma Bridger peers over Randeaux's shoulder and pushes into the room.>//\n\n**Dr. Bridger:** Are you //sure// that's slop?\n\n**Hall-Marks:** //<quietly>// Lord, give me strength.\n\n**Randeaux:** It certainly looks like slop. //<He kneels, leans in close to the carpet stain, inhales deeply, and gags.>// Smells like slop.\n\n**Dr. Bridger:** I'm not convinced. Let me run SlopCheck on my phone.\n\n**Randeaux:** What's SlopCheck?\n\n**Dr. Bridger:** It's an AI tester I made. Don't worry, it's powered by SlopGPT.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Wh- No! Don't use that!\n\n**Dr. Bridger:** Why not? //<Dr. Bridger scratches her cheek, smearing herself with fluid waste.>// Is there a better AI tool?\n\n**Hall-Marks:** //<shouting> We don't use AI tools here!//\n\n//<The Assistant Director rises from her seat, brandishing the SCP-645-J file and gesticulating at the red highlights.>//\n\n**Hall-Marks:** We don't operate on gut feelings, either! Machine-generated text has very obvious traits under close examination, so just -- examine!\n\n//<She slaps the printout back onto the desk and exhales slowly, clenching and unclenching her fists.>//\n\n**Randeaux:** That's a very good point. We ought to be scientific about this.\n\n//<Randeaux touches the nearest stain, studies it closely, then licks his finger. He retches, shudders, then vomits on the carpet. Hall-Marks looks on, dismayed.>//\n\n**Randeaux:** Ugh. Scientifically speaking, it sure tastes like slop.\n\n**Dr. Bridger:** I'll ask SlopGPT to write a file on itself, for comparison.\n\n**Hall-Marks:** Do //not// do that.\n\n**Kord:** Can I leave now?\n\n**Hall-Marks:** //No!// No. You're all staying for at least... one more meeting. //<She slumps back into her seat, picks up her telephone and dials.>// Security?\n[[/div]]\n\nDisciplinary proceedings are ongoing. This incident emphasizes the importants of meticulous attention to containment security procedure in the interests of mitigating threats to SCP Bedrock rod.\n\n//Upon consideration, we might need a whole new type of disc report for this. --AD Hall-Marks//",
