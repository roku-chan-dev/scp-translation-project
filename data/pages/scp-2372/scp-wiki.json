The temperature of the containment unit is to be maintained within a range between 2 ºC to 4 ºC. SCP-2372-A's requests for its detachment from SCP-2372 are to be denied. SCP-2372-A is to be told that it will be slated for experiments to detach it from SCP-2372 in exchange for its cooperation in translating for SCP-2372.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2372 is the preserved corpse of Chen ███-██, impervious to decomposition. Grains of powdered jade and silk threads are found embedded into SCP-2372's subcutis, evenly distributed throughout its body. Scarring and stitching found on SCP-2372 are indicative of amateur surgical procedures.\n\nSCP-2372 can produce a groan-like sound from its mouth despite the inability for its vocal folds to vibrate, which functions as its method of communication; see Paragraph 4 of **Description**. In addition, it generates a fog from its umbilicus. Analysis of water droplets in the fog has identified trace amounts of pre-ejaculatory fluid.  \n\nSCP-2372-A is an incorporeal humanoid entity which manifests from the fog generated from SCP-2372, which resembles Chen's upper torso. It is sapient and identifies itself as Chen ███-██. Through vibration of its constituent water particles, SCP-2372-A is capable of speech and demonstrates equal proficiency in Cantonese as Chen ███-██.\n\nSCP-2372-A is the only known individual which can comprehend sounds made by SCP-2372, regularly conversing with it. From SCP-2372-A's perspective, it and SCP-2372 have an apparently antagonistic relationship. While SCP-2372's perspective on its relationship with SCP-2372-A cannot be enquired independently, it is found to occasionally secrete pre-ejaculatory fluid from its urethra while interacting with SCP-2372-A. \n\nSCP-2372 was recovered from the Victoria Public Mortuary in Hong Kong on ██/██/1987, when SCP-2372-A manifested during SCP-2372's autopsy. After retrieving the corpse, the incident was dismissed as a hallucination on the coroner's part. An urn filled with ashes of cremated animals was presented to the kin of Chen ███-██.\n\n**Addendum 2372-1:** Selected Interviews with SCP-2372 and/or SCP-2372-A\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View Interview Log 2372-A-1\" hide=\"- Hide Interview Log\"]]\n\n> **Interviewee:** SCP-2372-A and SCP-2372\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Agent Ocean Park \n> \n> **Foreword:** The following interview is originally conducted in Cantonese. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Agent Park:** Hello, please state your identity. \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Chen ███-██. It's good that someone decides not to run away and scream. \n> \n> **Agent Park:** But you can't be Mr. Chen. Isn't he already deceased? \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, thanks for reminding me that. Now if you could be a dear, help me please.\n> \n> **Agent Park:** In what manner? \n> \n> [SCP-2372-A points to SCP-2372.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Get this thing off me!\n> \n> **Agent Park:** You mean, your body?\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, I'm stuck with that thing. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans. SCP-2372-A turns away from Agent Park.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Hey, don't you give me that! You're a sinful waste of flesh and soul!\n> \n> **Agent Park:** Are you talking to your body?  \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Can't you tell? Look, I made a grave mistake in life and I need you to remo-\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** No, it was definitely a mistake! We are supposed to go our separate ways after death. Me up there, and you down there!\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** No no no! This was not worth the jade suit! [[footnote]] In the original transcript, SCP-2372-A uses the term \"玉衣\" (pinyin: yù yī; literally \"jade suit\"). It refers to the \"jade burial suit\", a ceremonial burial suit composed of jade, traditionally utilised for the burial of Han Dynasty royalty. Jade burial suits were believed to delay the decomposition of the bodily soul (or 魄; pinyin: pò). [[/footnote]] I'm not paying the price for my stupidity in life with my afterlife! \n> \n> **Agent Park:** What is this jade suit? \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Screw you! We do not have that kind of relationship!\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View Interview Log 2372-A-5\" hide=\"- Hide Interview Log\"]]\n\n> **Interviewee:** SCP-2372-A and SCP-2372\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Fuji Tsang \n> \n> **Foreword:** The following interview is originally conducted in Cantonese. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** SCP-2372-A, can you tell more about the circumstances about this jade suit of yours? \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, it was-\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Hush you! Like I was saying, I got it from Old Chin, the \"self-proclaimed\" miracle surgeon from the Walled City. [[footnote]] Said individual was not found in the address given by SCP-2372-A during a Foundation-led raid on the Kowloon Walled City. Residents claimed that Old Chin had fled due to recent harassment from triad organisations. He (or an entity of the same name) is suspected to be involved in [[[SCP-2748]]]. [[/footnote]] \n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** Kowloon Walled City?\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Yeah, a few years back.  \n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** Do give us the address later. But I want to know why did you choose to do this operation? \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Well, I used to work in the cemetery and handle corpses all the time. When you see those dead bodies so many times, I thought I would be like them someday. And boy, I do not want-\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Get your head out of the gutter! I did not do it for you!\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans]\n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** What did SCP-2372 say?\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Irrelevant. That thing does not represent me. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** SCP-2372-A, we've agreed on this. If you insist on not giving us accurate translation of SCP-2372's words, we cannot help you. It's your choice. \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Okay, but please don't take its word for it. It claims that I – I mean, Chen ███-██ – was into himself... physically speaking. \n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** And you do not believe it's true?\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Doctor, I'm his //hún//. [[footnote]] 魂; pinyin: hún; a term commonly translated as the ethereal soul. [[/footnote]] I think I know Chen ███-██ more than anyone else in this world. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** No, you don't know him. You're just projecting your fantasies on us. What makes you think that way?\n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **Dr. Tsang:** 2372-A, please leave the questioning to me. And translation, please? \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** It insisted that it knew Chen as well as I do, which is false. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** No, you are definitely sick in that rotting head of yours. Chen ███-██ was not relieving you whenever he was looking at those magazines. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** God! Just because his hand was on you doesn't mean he was thinking about you. He was never into himself, I mean, you. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.] \n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** I've already explained it! Chen ███-██ just wants to keep himself together after death. \n> \n> [SCP-2372 groans.]\n> \n> **SCP-2372-A:** Not in that way, you pervert!\n> \n> **<End Log>** \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 2372-2669:** Statement from O5-7\n\n> With effect from ██/██/████, authorised [[[Project Heimdall]]] personnel are granted access to data pertaining to SCP-2372's remote mind-body linking phenomenon for [[[SCP-2669|practical application]]].\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2371]]] | SCP-2372 | [[[SCP-2373]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
