Due to that location being within an active Foundation site, no external containment procedures are required. \n\nPursuant to the terms of Ethics Committee Memorandum 9.14.19A, access to SCP-6740 is permitted to any Foundation personnel with appropriate clearances to be working within Site-19. Individuals who desire to enter SCP-6740 must sign in with the desk clerk at the entrance to the 7th subterranean level of the E-Wing. \n\n[[include component:image-block name=doorway2.jpg|align=right|width=60%|caption=The entrance of SCP-6740, as seen from within the anomaly.]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6740 is an extradimensional spatial incursion manifesting within the unused offices on floor E7B of Site-19, specifically in the office formerly occupied by the now defunct Office of Personnel Arrangements[[footnote]]Notably, this office had stood empty for over three decades prior to the discovery of SCP-6740[[/footnote]]. SCP-6740 manifests as a region of the empty office that has had its spatial geometry altered significantly; specifically, the area directly adjacent to SCP-6740 no longer has a visible ceiling. Support columns throughout the office now extend indefinitely upwards into space, which itself presents as a starry sky in a perpetual state of dusk.\n\nOn the far end of the former Office of Personnel Arrangements is the entrance to SCP-6740 proper; a large, white doorway in an ornate frame in the shape of a horned stag situated into the wall that previously separated the main floor space of the office with an adjoining storage room. The doorway is the only access point to SCP-6740; attempting to enter SCP-6740 through any other means, such as scaling one of the office walls, is impossible, as SCP-6740 is simply not present beyond the wall unless entered through the main door.\n\nBeyond the door is SCP-6740 proper; an expansive mausoleum constructed out of polished marble tile with iron fixtures. The full size of SCP-6740 is impossible to determine - SCP-6740's inner dimensions appear to increase over time. Despite its expansive size, research indicates that it is impossible to become lost within SCP-6740; individuals who wish to leave SCP-6740 will quickly find themselves at the mausoleum's exit.\n\nThe contents of the vaults within SCP-6740 have been a point of some uncertainty - while the total number of vaults has thus far been impossible to ascertain, it is currently recognized that every vault thus far catalogued within SCP-6740 has been the vault for a deceased member of Foundation staff, a civilian contractor working with the Foundation, a member of D-Class, or an individual identified to have perished during the containment or containment attempt of another anomaly.\n\nRadiographic analysis indicates that there are humanoid figures within each of the vaults, though the exact nature and makeup of those figures is unknown, and the vaults themselves have thus far been impossible to open. Due to the Foundation's policy of cremating the remains of all staff or other associated individuals, it is uncertain as to whether or not the figures within the vaults are the original bodies of the deceased individuals, and attempts at exhumation of other relevant persons have been inconclusive.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=guardian.jpg|align=right|width=60%|caption=Statue on top of the engraved pedestal within the mausoleum entryway.]]\n\nThe interior of SCP-6740 is consistent across its entire area with a single exception - a bronze statue of a stag standing atop a black marble plinth is present within the entryway of the mausoleum, just beyond the first set of vaults. Radiographic analysis of the plinth indicates that there is a humanoid figure within a vault below the platform as well.\n\nOn the front of the marble plinth is an engraved poem, in English. The origin of the poem is unknown. The full text is available below.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nI was born sleeping,\nmy eyes closed to the\nharsh light and cold truth\nof a world beyond the\nfour walls of my youth.\n\nAs a child I would gaze\ninto the darkness of night\nand wonder if there were\nmore secrets left to be\nknown, or if the last of\nthe dragons had died\nwhen the sun set in\na much younger sky. \n\nIt was here we saw with\nopened eyes that long\nhidden truth of our world:\nit was never ours alone,\nand it was never without\nsecrets hidden in the dark.\n\nI had wandered, unknowing,\nfor timeless years like a fawn\nalone in a quiet forest, but\nwithin this hallowed temple\nto the best of our intentions\ndid I find purpose in our mission.\n\nTo secure that old darkness,\nTo contain what lies within,\nTo protect what lies without.\n\nMy part to play was but as\na single actor on a stage\nfar larger than I had mind\nor reason to comprehend,\nyet it was a part all the same.\n\nWhen the crook of the \nReaper came for me, I did\nnot lament my passing, for\nI did so with open eyes,\nable at last to see the stars\nin the sky of my childhood.\n\nNow here do I rest, with\nthose nameless multitudes\nwho, by desire or design, \nlaid their lives aside on the\nroad of our common passage.\n\nWithin our shared grave \nlie we who sleep again,\nour part now complete\nand our curtains drawn.\n\nWe had dreamt of dragons,\nand found angels among us.\n\nHERE LIES A DOCTOR \nOF THE \nSCP FOUNDATION.\n\nAWAKE AT LAST.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6739]]] | SCP-6740 | [[[SCP-6741]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Filename:** doorway.jpg\n**Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n**Source Link:** [/scp-6740 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n**Derivative Of:**\n----\n**Name:** Stanley Kubrick's office\n**Author:** James Mitchell\n**License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n**Source Link:** [http://flickr.com/jamesmitchell/8127236513 Flickr]\n----\n**Name:** The Black Door (227031445).jpeg\n**Author:** Raúl Ponce\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n**Source Link:** [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:the_Black_Door_(227031445).jpeg Wikimedia Commons][[/div]][[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Filename:** doorway2.jpg\n**Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n**Source Link:** [/scp-6740 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n**Derivative Of:**\n----\n**Name:** Mausoleum\n**Author:** Bart Everson\n**License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n**Source Link:** [http://flickr.com/editor/8531170793 Flickr]\n----\n**Name:** The Black Door (227031445).jpeg\n**Author:** Raúl Ponce\n**License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n**Source Link:** [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/file:the_Black_Door_(227031445).jpeg Wikimedia Commons][[/div]]\n> **Filename:** guardian.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-6740 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Benevolent Protective Order of Elks\n> **Author:** A Disappearing Act\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://flickr.com/fredisonfire/24753568436 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** warning.png\n> **Author:** [[*user djkaktus]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-6740 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
