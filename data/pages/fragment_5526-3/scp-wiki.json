When active, all humans within a radius of 50 feet will have an increase of Testosterone/Progesterone and Epinephrine in the body, creating intestine feelings of aggression and violence. Will use this to distract and kill affected people. Has the ability to create Ways, and often does this to teleport into the nearest large population center. It is currently held in Site-17, and secured within a room containing several Chao-Heisman Anti-Rift Stabilizer (CHARS) [[footnote]]A device that stops the appearance of \"Ways\", travelable tears space-time generated from Thaumaturgical sources.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Normalization Protocols:** Knowledge will be released as part of a monthly normalization broadcast. Should it breach containment, an emergency broadcast will be sent to the nearest population center, encouraging residents to stay within their homes and providing information of its abilities.\n\nIn addition, research on the teleportation and spectral projection abilities is to be sent to universities and other research institutions on a monthly basis, according to Vanguard Para-Science policies. Should a major breakthrough be made, the para-scientific communities are to be notified immediately. \n\n**Discovery:** VNP-5526 was originally discovered by the American Secure Containment Initiative (a precursor to the now-disbanded SCP Foundation) in the early 1800s. Due to ASCI's poor record keeping, the location and exact date of recovery is currently unknown. However, a recording believed to pertain to VNP-5526 is detailed below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: white; border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px;  font-family: 'Courier Prime', monospace;\"]]\n[[=]]\n> **American Secure Containment Initiative Document, circa early 1800s**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Item Number:** 82-993\n\n**Threat Level:** Orange\n\n**Classification Type:** Object\n-----\n**ASCI Protocols for Containment:** Phenomenon 82-993 is to be secure in a large pool of liquid concrete and **[DATA CORRUPTED]** from Facility-29. All employees are to stay as far away as possible from the cell.\n\nShould Phenomenon 82-993 breach containment, PSF[[footnote]]**Vanguard Note:** Protection Strike Force, equivalent to  Foundation MTFs[[/footnote]] Calypso-8 will be sent to the nearest population center (the town of Greenville, Kentucky) to detain Phenomenon 82-993 by any means necessary. Tier-2 amnestics will be entered into the town's water supply. All victims will be given a basic cover story of arson, and the bodies **[DATA CORRUPTED]** in a house.\n\n**Description:** Phenomenon 82-993 is a hostile phantasmic entity contained with a steel falchion. The entity has the abilities of teleportation and empathetic manipulation, the latter of which it uses to incite violence in humans via unknown means.

VNP-5526 is substantially different from other SE's with similar scores, due to its ability to manipulate emotions through non-psychic means and the ability to manifest Ways. Although many SE's can teleport, few non-deceased generate Ways. Therefore, this study will determine \nA) If VNP-5526 was ever a living entity \nB) If VNP-5526's Way manifesting abilities are Thaumaturgical in nature, and\nC) If VNP-5526 is capable of sapient thought.\n\n**[IRRELEVANT DATA OMITTED- IF YOU WISH TO READ THE FULL VERSION, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR RAISA REPRESENTATIVE.]**\n\n**Conclusion:** VNP-5526's abilities of Way-Making and emotional manipulation are concluded to be substantially different from other Spectral Entities. To answer the questions in the abstract:\nA) VNP-5526 was never a living entity and has always existed as an SE.\nB) VNP-5526's Way manifesting abilities are Thaumaturgical in nature, however, they use Thaumaturgic practices substantially different than any existing within this universe[[footnote]]See //Thaumaturgy across the Multiverse// by Allison Chao (Ignis), et. al.[[/footnote]]\nC) It is currently unknown if VNP-5526 is capable of sapient thought\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n> [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5526/offset/1|<- Previous Iteration]]] |   __Iteration 2__ @@ @@|[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5526/offset/3| Next Iteration -> ]]]\n[[/=]]",
