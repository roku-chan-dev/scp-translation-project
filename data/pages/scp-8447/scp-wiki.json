The full cover story may be found in Supplemental Document 8447-A.\n\n**Description (Last Modified 2025-1-1T09:13:58):** On 2025-1-1T00:15:23[[footnote]] 1st of January, 2025, at 12:15 AM and 23 seconds UTC. [[/footnote]], a human body impacted the ground at the center of Times Square, New York City at an estimated 59 m/s. Analysis of satellite footage has shown that the object abruptly manifested in the upper atmosphere approximately 15 minutes prior at 00:00:00 UTC via unknown means. \n\nThe Foundation was alerted to the presence of the body (designated SCP-8447-1) within seconds of it hitting the ground and was able to recover it via a fake ambulance. SCP-8447-1 was found to be the corpse of a Sub-Saharan African man, age estimated somewhere between 40 to 50. Further examination is pending.\n\nDue to the risk of further anomalous activity in the area, O5-3 instated an emergency order to close off Times Square until 03:00:00.\n\n**SCP-8447 Log of Updates:**\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"date-header\"]]\n2 Jan 2025\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"update\"]]\n**Update (02:16:33)** \n\nAt 00:13:56, an additional object impacted the ground in the center of Times Square, New York City. Object was found to be the corpse of a Sub-Saharan African woman, age estimated between 30-40, and was subsequently designated SCP-8447-2. Times Square has been closed off indefinitely due to the risk of reoccurring anomalous activity, under the guise of a homicide investigation.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"update\"]]\n**Update (17:56:12)** \n\nThe SCP Foundation Forensics department submitted a report detailing their findings on the condition of SCP-8447-1. Contrary to expectations, the object was found not to have expired due to blunt force trauma. Rather, the object was found to have expired due to hypovolemic shock[[footnote]] insufficient blood flow due to lack of fluid outside the cells (e.g. lack of blood)[[/footnote]]. Object also showed signs of severe infection which is believed to have caused this hypovolemic shock.

Object designated SCP-8447-3. \n\nDespite Foundation-led attempts to hide subsequent SCP-8447 manifestations from the public, photographs of SCP-8447-3 falling to the ground were found online. Images were deleted and amnestics were applied to affected persons.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"update\"]]\n**Update (14:24:36)** \n\nFoundation operatives within the Ugandan government have confirmed that a man matching the description of SCP-8447-1 inexplicably disappeared from an Ebola ward on 2024-12-29T05:34:20. All personnel who came into contact with SCP-8447-1 are to be quarantined and screened for Ebola infection.

I don't know how the hell anyone other than your people could manage to hide the fact that there are //dead bodies falling onto Times Square// every day at the stroke of midnight. I'll be the first to acknowledge that it's beyond fucking ridiculous. I wholeheartedly commend your efforts in dealing with this problem.\n> \n> All of that said, your current \"containment\" methods are untenable. I'm opening three new properties adjacent to Times Square. As a grand opening ceremony, I am sponsoring a concert set to take place there on the 10th. If you can't have this resolved by then, those properties aren't going to be profitable, and I won't be able to hire workers. This amounts to //hundreds// of high-paying jobs for hard-working NYC folks down the drain. And all the lost profit has to come from //somewhere//.

What was it that you wanted to discuss?\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: This is about 8447, Sir. I believe we need to make drastic changes to our protocol.\n> \n> O5-3: How so?\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: We should've closed Times Square instead of acquiescing to Darke's threats. The other donors know how much leverage they have now.\n> \n> O5-3: Darke funds the entirety of Site-276 and that only accounts for half of her annual donations. The Foundation needs that money.\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: Sir, if we listen to Darke, the federal government will find out, and they'll pull their funding as well.\n> \n> O5-3: Money from the federal government is slowly drying up. Everything's getting privatized these days.\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: They still have //regulatory// power over --\n> \n> O5-3: As far as they know, this is a terrorist attack. If need be, we can erase their memories. I recall I only appointed you a few months ago, so I don't fault you for not being familiar with the options we have at our disposal.\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: I'm aware of amnestics, Sir. I just don't think that using amnestics to craft a narrative is sustainable here -- our stock is down 4% already. Most of that's from 8447.\n> \n> O5-3: Does a few percent matter?\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: The enormous cost of those amnestics aside, this will only be sustainable if we can contain the anomaly.\n> \n> O5-3: If we assumed that we could not contain anomalies, the Foundation would have never existed.\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: But at this rate, Sir, we'll be out of amnestics by the end of the year. We //can't// contain this without shutting down Times Square.\n> \n> //[O5-3 inhales sharply and rubs his temples.]//\n> \n> O5-3: We cannot simply sit here and let a mysterious force continue to drop Ebola-ridden corpses into one of the most famous places on the planet. If we allow this anomaly take Times Square hostage, that tells it that it can do far more damage. What if it starts dropping corpses on the Eiffel Tower? What if it tosses one into a live television broadcast? What if it throws a corpse into a major food manufacturing plant? We bend to anomalies' demands as little as possible for a reason: We give them an inch and they realize they can demand a mile. We solve this by never giving them that opportunity in the first place — all negotiations are on our terms. The only reason why our organization has been able to survive for so long is because we have never forgotten this fundamental principle. We must not forget now.\n> \n> Dr. Cassandra: But what about the threat to human life? I'd rather we not be responsible for an Ebola outbreak. I'm sending an order to close Times Square for the immediate future.\n> \n> O5-3: I will -- with great reluctance -- authorize this request. Reopen it //as soon as possible//.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"revision\"]]\n**A revision to the document \"SCP-8447\" was made at 09:36:51**\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation agents stationed in Ebola wards are to implant tracking devices into all persons suspected to be infected with the Ebola virus. Access to persons infected with Ebola is to be strictly monitored.\n\nUntil a method of reliably and covertly catching SCP-8447 instances moving at up to 300 m/s can be devised, Times Square is to be closed and SCP-8447 is to be explained via a cover story. In this cover story, SCP-8447 instances are members of a suicide cult who ritually commit suicide by jumping off buildings close to midnight. \n\nThe Ethics Committee is currently deliberating on whether to authorize Operation \"Immunize Uganda\" if alternative containment procedures fail.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8447 is a phenomenon in which a corpse manifests several kilometers above Times Square, New York City every day at 00:00:00 UTC. Cause of death in all cases has been due to the Ebola virus.

Efforts by the Foundation are underway to eradicate the Ebola virus in wild animals to eliminate the possibility of future zoonotic vectors.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mail\"]]\n**Update (15:00:00):**\n\n> //The following is a message from the O5 council to Foundation staff clearance level 2 and above.//\n> \n> Hello, Foundation staff. Let me begin with the exciting news:\n> * Yes, we are almost certain that the Ebola virus has been eradicated in humans -- and that, in the process, SCP-8447 has been neutralized.\n> * Yes, we -- the SCP Foundation -- were responsible for this, and we accomplished this feat by weaponizing other SCPs.\n> \n> I know that there are rumors about this seemingly sudden shift in the Foundation's doctrine, so I want to make one thing abundantly clear: **This is the exception, not the rule.** Under normal circumstances, the SCP Foundation does not and will not utilize anomalies to contain other anomalies -- or utilize anomalies //at all//, for that matter. It might seem tempting to look at seemingly well-understood anomalies and utilize them for our own gain. \n> \n> However, even in //this// instance, the anomaly we utilized was not without side effects. To ensure we understood the ramifications of what we had done, the Ethics Committee showed us these side effects directly. We were made to watch the harrowing footage of one of our test subjects being slowly burnt to a crisp, screaming in pain and terror until the fire literally burned a hole through her lungs. While side effects like these are rare, the fact that they can happen //at all// makes it incredibly irresponsible to utilize anomalies, whether inside the veil or out of it. I understand that you all strive to complete the Foundation's missions through any means possible, and I applaud that. But anomalies are meant to be contained. Not to do the containing.\n> \n> - O5-3\n> Secure. Contain. Protect.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"date-header\"]]\n28 Jan 2025\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"date-header\"]]\n29 Jan 2025\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mail red\"]]\n**CRITICAL WARNING (04:24:51):**\n\nAn unauthorized message was disseminated to all SCP Foundation staff.\n\n> Hello everyone,\n> \n> Let me tell you a story.\n> \n> I decided -- on a whim -- to go to Uganda a few days ago. It was not a sight-seeing trip. Rather, it was to follow through on what the Ethics Committee had suggested: To see the fruits of our labor firsthand. To see the potential consequences of our actions so that we may not become numb to them in our future endeavors.\n> \n> To minimize my risk of standing out and being spotted, I disguised myself among the ranks of the Foundation medical professionals distributing 8447-D to the desperate masses. It was a gut-wrenching scene -- we tried as hard as we could to get 8447-D to as many people as possible, but due to logistical issues, not enough would make it in time. Despite the fact that we had a cure, whenever we ran out, we just had to watch as people would die one after another, their only solace being the morphine we would inject into their veins.\n> \n> But //that// wasn't what //truly// got to me.\n> \n> It was the 26th and I was leaving my ward at the end of my shift, walking back to my hotel across town. That was when a man noticed me, ran up to me, and vigorously shook my hand. When I asked him who he was, hoping my cover wasn't blown, he burst into tears.\n> \n> \"Thank you for saving my daughter,\" he said, sobbing uncontrollably as he pointed at the logo on my uniform. \"I am grateful I still have one of my children.\"\n> \n> I was completely taken aback. It's been years since I was in the field, and I didn't really know what to say to a man whose child had narrowly escaped death. But I am -- more than anything -- a problem-solver, so I simply asked him this: \"Could we still save your other child?\"\n> \n> A chill went down my spine as I realized my immediate mistake. He began sobbing harder and pulled out a handkerchief to blow his nose. \"He was shot --\" the man said, barely able to speak. There was a palpable anger welling up in his throat. \"He was shot once in his bed in the Ebola ward and left to bleed out, just as they did to all the others. They did not even have the decency to let him die a quick death. I am so, //so// grateful you arrived before they could kill my other child.\"\n> \n> I tried to maintain my composure as I consoled the grieving father. Yet, internally, I could feel my stomach twisting itself into a tight knot. I practically felt like I was going to vomit. This man didn't know that it was //us// who killed his son. \n> \n> And yet -- by a cruel twist of fate -- the father of the man we killed was now //thanking us//.\n> \n> This really makes me wonder: How important is the abstract notion of \"normalcy\" our organization has grown so attached to? Why is it so paramount that we never give anomalies an inch, that we stubbornly hang on to this land of make-believe we've created for the rest of humanity? We went from 8447-D being an idea in our head to it //eradicating the Ebola virus in humans// in about //two weeks//. \n> \n> What if that was the //first// thing we had done when 8447 began dropping bodies on Times Square? //How many lives could we have saved?// Imagine if we could create such drugs to treat //any// disease, all with the manpower of doctors outside the veil and the time to ensure they've been properly tested and ensured to be safe. Imagine if, instead of locking up anomalies and leaving them to collect dust, we had the option of allowing scientists around the globe to study them and learn their underlying principles. Perhaps they'd understand them enough to incorporate them into scientific theories, making them //no longer anomalous// in the process. //Our ideology is a self-fulfilling prophecy//. Without it, we could do //so much more//.\n> \n> Let me be blunt: **I'm resigning from the Foundation effective immediately.**\n> \n> However, I'm not leaving quietly. I've disseminated all of 8447's documentation to the public. I encourage every Foundation employee, after reading this, to take a long, hard look at it and the sheer disinterest and cruelty of the Foundation -- //our// Foundation -- dripping from each of its pages. Operation \"Immunize Uganda,\" for instance, wasn't an effort to get Ugandans vaccinated. It was a //deliberate act of mass murder//. Who would have thought that it wouldn't work to give paramilitary groups loads of money and ask them to eradicate a disease? Who would have thought that they'd opt to simply //kill// anyone unfortunate enough to be infected? The O5 council isn't //that// stupid -- they could've contacted the UN or a whole number of different NGOs. It just would've //costed more//.\n> \n> I know that the lot of you in the O5 council are going to try to silence me. To that I say \"good luck.\" I've gotten firsthand testimony of your massacre in Uganda, so good luck trying to use plausible deniability to trick everyone into thinking it wasn't completely intentional. I've destroyed half of the Foundation's primary amnestics stockpile, so good luck mindwiping anyone. I've taken great pains to distribute the 8447 archives through as many independent channels as possible, so good luck taking it off the web. I've already contacted hundreds of journalists, politicians, and nonprofits about the existence of the Foundation and the crimes it has committed, so good luck unpersoning each and every one of them. I might be a //lowly// senior researcher, but I know just enough of your tricks to hide from you, so good luck finding //me//.\n> \n> All in all, I cannot in good conscience remain in an organization like the SCP Foundation. I cannot remain in an organization that fails to help those in need simply because they live on the wrong side of the world. I cannot remain in an organization that stubbornly sticks to its principles even when humanity //demands// they do the opposite. I cannot remain in an organization that refuses to ask itself the all-important question:\n> \n> [[div style=\"font-size: 150%; margin-top: 100px; margin-bottom: 100px;\"]]\n> [[=]]\n> //What are we doing?//\n> [[/=]]\n> [[/div]]\n> \n> - Dr. Cassandra, Former SCP-8447 Project Lead.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8446]]] | SCP-8447 | [[[SCP-8448]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=radian628]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
