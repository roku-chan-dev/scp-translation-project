As the USA is quarantined off from the rest of the world to halt the spread of the virus, the magic legacy of the whole world is once again at stake for the first time in almost three decades. With parties from all over the globe coming in to deal with the situation in tens of unique ways, the series asks what would realistically occur should the wonder of the new, Veilless world of the near future be fatally threatened.\n\n* **Who can contribute?**\n\nAnyone! 8,000 Dead Rats is an open series, meaning anyone and everyone is more than welcome to add to any of its arcs. We actively invite anyone interested to contribute -- there are tons of unique opportunities and angles to show the global event from, so we would love to see how your particular corner of the SCP world would react to the pandemic.\n\nHowever, we highly recommend reading already existing articles in the series prior to contributing, as the series aims to remain internally consistent and coherent between its events, ensuring that it does not contradict itself. There aren't any real rules to contributing, aside from respecting the works of others and operating within the confines of the From 120's Archives canon. If you're unsure how parts of this world operate, make sure to check out the canon's hub or ask around in the discussion of the series' articles.\n\n* **I'm interested. Where can I talk with other contributors?**\n\nDiscussions related to 8,000 Dead Rats regularly happen in the #from-120s-archives channel on the CANONEXUS Discord server ([https://discord.gg/34hnt4jeMT invite link]), where most of its contributors hang out and where coordinating further developments to the series happens.
