The reforms to the Foundation’s classification system are long overdue and they have expanded our ability to describe the features of an anomaly, but this has come at the cost of both easy reference and linguistic cohesion. ACS terms on the whole have only partial thematic unity or contextual indication of their meaning, as if they are two incomplete systems merged together. This itself is an issue, but it masks a greater flaw underneath.\n\nThe true problem we are facing is not that the current ACS format is too complex - it is that it is not complex enough! We are still capable, on an institutional level, of understanding our own documentation and I will not stand for this miscarriage of justice! In the nearly 30 years I have been part of the Foundation, we have taken only timid, half-measure steps towards our great destiny of total incomprehensibility. I say this cowardice has gone on long enough! Long enough and  no longer!\n\nAnd so to address this crippling flaw in our organization, I propose the following: in order to sever the last remaining ties of ACS to functionality, we must cut it entirely from the English language and its purse of stolen words. We must engineer a language wholly focused on condensing the granularity of ACS information into the most informationally-dense and functionally-useless form possible.\n\nMy proposal for a Revised ACS will encode the exact specifications of an anomaly’s qualities and distinctive features in its morphology, providing granular detail that will be rendered utterly incoherent if it is mispronounced, misheard, mistyped, spoken with any sort of accent, subjected to ordinary sound changes,  or otherwise changed in any way.  \n\nThis proposal owes a great debt to Mr. John Quijada’s Ithkuil, and I offer Mr. Quijada my sincerest apologies for this inexpert bungling of his magnum opus. It is only fitting, for the purposes of destroying language’s function and purpose, that I fill the role of demiurge and create a lesser world of base matter in crude imitation of the truth.\n@@ @@\n+++ Phonology\nI have chosen to keep the phonology and romanization of RACS within the boundaries of what is easily pronounced by English speakers and what can be easily typed on a standard keyboard, except in those cases where I have not.\n\n[[div class=\"mobile\"]]\n||||||||||||||||||~ Consonants ||\n||~ ||~ LAB ||~ DEN ||~ ALV ||~ POA ||~ PAL ||~ VEL ||~ UVU ||~ GLO ||\n||= NSL ||= m || ||= n || || ||= ŋ || || ||\n||= STP ||= p / b || ||= t / d || || ||= k / g ||= q ||= ʔ ||\n||= EJS ||= p' ||= ||= t' ||= ||= ||= k' ||= ||= ||\n||= AFF ||= ||= ||= t͡s / d͡z ||= t͡ʃ / d͡ʒ  ||= ||= ||= q͡χ ||= ||\n||= EJA ||= ||= ||= t͡s' ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= FRC ||= f / v ||= θ / ð ||= s / z ||= ʃ / ʒ ||= ||= x / ɣ ||= ||= ||\n||= APX ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= j ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= TRL ||= ʙ ||= ||= r ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAT ||= ||= ||= l ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAF ||= ||= ||= t͡ɬ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= CLK ||= ||= ||= ŋ! ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n[[/div]]\n\nWhile <r> is written here as the trilled /r/, but it is more appropriately described as a \"whatever rhotic\" and can be realized as /ɾ/, /ɹ/, /ʀ/, or any other variety as one sees fit.\n\n||||||||~ Vowels ||\n|| || Front || Central || Back ||\n|| Upper ||= i  ||= ɨ ||= u  ||\n|| High Mid ||= e  ||  ||= o  ||\n|| Mid  ||  ||= ə̃  ||  ||\n|| Low Mid ||= ɛ  ||  ||= ɔ   ||\n|| Low ||||||= a  ||||\n\nThe vowel inventory has been arranged so that, if you are more in line with the spirit of the IPA chart rather than the reality, they will be arranged in such a way to mimic the Foundation’s own sigil.\n@@ @@\n+++ Romanization\n\nRevised ACS uses multiple romanization systems: sets A and B (With and without diacritics, respectively) are acceptable for casual usage and teaching materials, but not in keeping with the standards set forth by the Classification Committee. As such, the formal orthography of RACS will exclusively use symbols from the Latin Extended-B Unicode block.\n\nAs these charts are quite large, I have added them to collapsible blocks.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Romanization A - No Diacritics\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"mobile\"]]\n||||||||||||||||||~ Consonants ||\n||~ ||~ LAB ||~ DEN ||~ ALV ||~ POA ||~ PAL ||~ VEL ||~ UVU ||~ GLO ||\n||= NSL ||= m || ||= n || || ||= ng || || ||\n||= STP ||= p / b || ||= t / d || || ||= k / g ||= q ||= ' ||\n||= EJS ||= p' ||= ||= t' ||= ||= ||= k' ||= ||= ||\n||= AFF ||= ||= ||= ts / dz||= c / j  ||= ||= ||= qx||= ||\n||= EJA ||= ||= ||= ts' ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= FRC ||= f / v ||= th / dh ||= s / z ||= sh / zh ||= ||= h:x:kh / gh ||= ||= h ||\n||= APX ||= hw / w ||= ||= ||= ||= y ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= TRL ||= bb ||= ||= r ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAT ||= ||= ||= l ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAF ||= ||= ||= tl ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= CLK ||= ||= ||= ng! ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n[[/div]]\n\n||||||||~ Vowels ||\n|| || Front || Central || Back ||\n|| Upper ||= i  ||= eu ||= u  ||\n|| High Mid ||= e  ||  ||= o  ||\n|| Mid  ||  ||= un  ||  ||\n|| Low Mid ||= eh  ||  ||= aw   ||\n|| Low ||||||= a  ||||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Romanization B - Diacritics\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"mobile\"]]\n||||||||||||||||||~ Consonants ||\n||~ ||~ LAB ||~ DEN ||~ ALV ||~ POA ||~ PAL ||~ VEL ||~ UVU ||~ GLO ||\n||= NSL ||= m || ||= n || || ||= ň || || ||\n||= STP ||= p / b || ||= t / d || || ||= k / g ||= q ||= ' ||\n||= EJS ||= p' ||= ||= t' ||= ||= ||= k' ||= ||= ||\n||= AFF ||= ||= ||= c̥ / z̥ ||= c / j  ||= ||= ||= q̌ ||= ||\n||= EJA ||= ||= ||= c̥' ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= FRC ||= f / v ||= ṭ / ḍ ||= s / z ||= š / ž ||= ||= h:x / ǧ ||= ||= h ||\n||= APX ||= w̏ / w ||= ||= ||= ||= y ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= TRL ||= b̥||= ||= r ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAT ||= ||= ||= l ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAF ||= ||= ||= ṱ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= CLK ||= ||= ||= ň! ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n[[/div]]\n\n||||||||~ Vowels ||\n|| || Front || Central || Back ||\n|| Upper ||= i  ||= ÿ ||= u  ||\n|| High Mid ||= e  ||  ||= o  ||\n|| Mid  ||  ||= ą ||  ||\n|| Low Mid ||= è  ||  ||= ò   ||\n|| Low ||||||= a  ||||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Romanization C - Formal\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"mobile\"]]\n||||||||||||||||||~ Consonants ||\n||~ ||~ LAB ||~ DEN ||~ ALV ||~ POA ||~ PAL ||~ VEL ||~ UVU ||~ GLO ||\n||= NSL ||= Ɯ || ||= ȵ || || ||= Ɲ || || ||\n||= STP ||= ȹ / Ƃ || ||= ȶ / ƍ || || ||= Ȼ / Ǥ ||= ȹ||= ƾ ||\n||= EJS ||= ȹƾ ||= ||= ȶƾ ||= ||= ||= Ȼƾ ||= ||= ||\n||= AFF ||= ||= ||= Ʃ / Ƶ  ||= Ɔ / Ɉ  ||= ||= ||= Ƣ ||= ||\n||= EJA ||= ||= ||= Ʃƾ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= FRC ||= ƪ / Ɯ ||= Ɵ / Ⱦ ||= ƒ / Ƹ ||= Ƨ / ƶ ||= ||= Ʌ / ȝ ||= ||= ||\n||= APX ||= ƕ / Ƿ ||= ||= ||= ||= Ɏ ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= TRL ||= ƀ ||= ||= ƥ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAT ||= ||= ||= Ɨ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= LAF ||= ||= ||= ƛ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n||= CLK ||= ||= ||= Ƞ ||= ||= ||= ||= ||= ||\n[[/div]]\n\n||||||||~ Vowels ||\n|| || Front || Central || Back ||\n|| Upper ||= ƚ ||= ƴ ||= Ɯ  ||\n|| High Mid ||= ǣ  ||  ||= Ƽ  ||\n|| Mid  ||  ||= Ʊ  ||  ||\n|| Low Mid ||= ɇ  ||  ||= ȣ   ||\n|| Low ||||||= ǝ  ||||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nPractitioners of Revised ACS are encouraged to switch between systems A and B according to whatever aesthetic criteria they deem fit, save in formal situations.\n\nIt should also be noted that, if a consonant is followed by <y> or <w> it will be palatalized or labialized, respectively.\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++ Slot 1 - Anomaly Status\nThe anomaly’s current status is indicated by a consonant prefix.

We can now achieve informational security on a scale never before conceived by the Foundation, hiding vital information from our very own personnel!\n\nQapla’!\nDavid Munsch\nDirector, Department of Constructed Languages\nSite-87\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-start= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username= Ross, Tamika\n|msg-time= Today at 11:13 AM\n]]\noh my god david\nwhat did you do\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=one\n|username= Munsch, David\n|msg-time= Today at 11:13 AM\n]]\n:)\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username= Ross, Tamika\n|msg-time= Today at 11:13 AM\n]]\nDAVID OH MY GOD WHAT DID YOU DO\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=three\n|username= LaRoche, Jesse\n|msg-time= Today at 11:13 AM\n]]\nHe went and did it, the absolute madman.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=four\n|username= Wheeler, Doug\n|msg-time= Today at 11:14 AM\n]]\nToki ike confirmed?\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=three\n|username= LaRoche, Jesse\n|msg-time= Today at 11:14 AM\n]]\ntoki pi ike //suli//\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=four\n|username= Wheeler, Doug\n|msg-time= Today at 11:14 AM\n]]\nMi olin\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=one\n|username= Munsch, David\n|msg-time= Today at 11:14 AM\n]]\nThank you! :D\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username= Ross, Tamika\n|msg-time= Today at 11:14 AM\n]]\nI hate that I like this.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=one\n|username= Munsch, David\n|msg-time= Today at 11:15 AM\n]]\nI promise I'll apologize to Mr. Quijada at the next LCC.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=three\n|username= LaRoche, Jesse\n|msg-time= Today at 11:15 AM\n]]\nThis is great.\nFuck now I want to just run the database through it.\nYou just made a new memeohazard.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username= Ross, Tamika\n|msg-time= Today at 11:16 AM\n]]\nI feel like this calls for a celebration.\nUncle Mike's work for everyone?\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=one\n|username= Munsch, David\n|msg-time= Today at 11:16 AM\n]]\nActually, I think we can write off a little visit to the Black Garden as a departmental expense.\nWe still have some money allotted for teambuilding and morale.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=four\n|username= Wheeler, Doug\n|msg-time= Today at 11:16 AM\n]]\nOh hell yeah.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=three\n|username= LaRoche, Jesse\n|msg-time= Today at 11:16 AM\n]]\nGods bless\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-end= --] ]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=two\n|username= Ross, Tamika\n|msg-time= Today at 11:17 AM\n]]\nI'll never say no to a free lunch.
