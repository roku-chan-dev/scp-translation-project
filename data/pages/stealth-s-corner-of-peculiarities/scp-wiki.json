Didn't see you there. I'm [[*user Spacestealth]] also known as just Stealth, and this is my Corner of Curiosities. Come take a look at all the weird and wonderful sights!

It was a remix of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-709 SCP-709], a not well known article that we believed could be improved, but more importantly it was a love letter to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo SCP-4000], one of our favourite articles. I highly recommend you check it out.\n\nDespite the fact it got 50th place in the SCP category, I'm still really proud of how this turned out, especially the ending. I hope to write a continuation to this story some day.\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8299 SCP-8299] - TRUE NORTH STRONG AND FREE** (Collaboration with [[*user Lt Flops]] for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deer-college-spring-cleaning-event Deer College Spring Cleaning Event)\n\n**COMMENTARY:** So this is an article I put a lot of time and love in. I knew I wanted to participate in the Spring cleaning event as I always say yes to everything, but most of my drafts were under a year old.  When I realised people could donate drafts, I quickly looked for one. I found one but I eventually quit out of lack of motivation. Then I decided to take on this draft by [[*user Lt Flops]] and submitted on the day before the deadline.\n\nAnyways the actual article itself is a somber story about a species of manatees, gradually dying out due to the actions of colonializations. This article is meant to pay homage to the First Nations, who are too often overlooked by most people. Even though I am not Canadian, I still decided to this as to spread knowledge. I also liked making the song at the end and I feel it fits perfectly with the image.\n[[/div]]\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7608 SCP-7608] - Champion of Mankind** (Written for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pdcontest2025 Public Domain Con])\n\n**COMMENTARY:** This was my first time participating in a team contest since departmentcon but luckily it went much better this time. Although I was worried I wouldn't get this finished in time, I still managed to complete it. It was a really fun experience and I'm so grateful for my two teammates. \n\nThis article is different from most of my other articles as I tried creating a longer, more intense article than usual. Although there are some things I would change, I'm still really proud of this. \n+ Next up....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n**TALES:**\n\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/friendly-rivalries Friendly Rivalries]**\n\n**COMMENTARY:** So one day I noticed me and [[*user winkwonkboi]]'s departments were pretty similar and we both wanted a tag.
