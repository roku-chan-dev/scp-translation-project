Therefore, by the late [TIME PERIOD REDACTED], the Foundation had successfully migrated the entirety of Meatspace humanity into SIMULACRUM.\n\nSIMULACRUM began as an experimental attempt to construct a simulated reality completely under the Foundation's control, incorporating technological innovations developed through the study of AIAD constructs, [[[SCP-5470]]], novel containment solutions pursued by the Minecraft Department, and [REDACTED]. For the decades following its development, it was used primarily for [[[SCP-2744 |hyperrealistic training simulations]]], personnel leisure, and [REDACTED].

It was repurposed as a replacement for dreams for users in select other simulations in order to conserve computational resources , and it also became available to privileged users for experimental and recreational purposes. \n\nThe experimental phase of the REDO project was intended to determine:\n* Whether a convincing mimicry of life could be created using a specific simulated physical system;\n* Whether this mimicry of life could pass Turing tests i.e. provide a convincing facsimile of sentience;\n* Whether these constructs could be used to improve SIMULACRUM efficiency.\n\nREDO was in an experimental phase for about 10 meatyears, and has been in active use for [ERROR.

Consistency with Forge personality matrices noted.\n\nIs there anything you would like to add to this description of REDO?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nIt is my life's work. There are a great many things I would love to say. \n\nWhen I first dreamed of REDO, I dreamed of a walled garden. A walled garden that death could not touch. And I built it with my own bare hands, and watched over it for a billion clock cycles. Like Hammurabi I set forth the rules of that world, and like Mekhane I watched as the atomic rules and definitions I gave that world gave rise to life.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nYou defined a set of initial constraints and parameters for this simulation and let it run until simulacra of life emerged. \n\nIs this correct?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[>]]\nAllow me to elaborate.\n\n{{Accessing File...}}\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n+ Abstract\n\n------\n\nREDO was a strongly-typed environment. All objects that existed in REDO needed to be associated with a specific data type, which strictly defined interactions with other objects of other data types. The emergent behaviors between objects with these datatypes provided a convincing facsimile of a natural environment.\n\nThe philosophical underpinnings of REDO lied in the Classical understanding of the elements. The Aristotelian elements i.e. fire, water, earth, and air were part of the initial conception of the alternate laws of physics for the sandbox. \n\n[[div class=\"svg-box\"]]\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Four_elements_representation.svg]]\n[[/div]]\n\nEarly iterations suggested heuristic computational improvements and the expansion of the vector space should additional elements be included. The elements deemed to introduce the most orthogonal emergent properties were wood, metal, aether, and void. \n\nWith the introduction of wood and metal, the existing relational schema for the elements was modified to include oppositional or negatory relationships. The initial schema for this structure was based on the Classical Chinese Wu Xing, which views the elements as forces for change. \n\n[[div class=\"svg-box\"]]\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/Wu_Xing.png/480px-Wu_Xing.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOver time, additional elements have been introduced into the simulation as needed to expand the sandbox's ability to model corresponding real-world phenomena. A complete element structural relationship diagram can be seen in **SIMULACRUM** STUDY YAT.00231.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nWhat is the significance of this? Am I to understand you based a simulation off of outdated mysticism?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nSIMULACRUM is not meatspace. And when I dreamed of REDO, I held that in my heart. We had a chance for a different world. A symbolic world, on a fundamental level. And yet the sandbox simulations of my fellows slavishly mimicked the real world or constrained themselves to the digital, the mathematical -- Conway's game of life with infinitely more processing power and perhaps a few additional rules on top of the primitive. I dreamed of something better. Something mystical.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nWhat was the innovation that arose from this mysticism?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThe atomic unit of REDO wasn't the bit or the quark. It was the element. Water quenches fire, which melts metal, which chops wood, which roots through the earth, which drinks the rain. And then we added tens more, each with its own defined interactions, over the generations.\n\nI watched the world take shape before my very eyes. Things undreamt of in the real world became commonplace in REDO. I remember the first time I walked through the Firepools of Vashar. The closest analogue in meatspace would have been Mauna Kea or Yellowstone, and yet there was an immense core difference. \n\nYellowstone, you see, merely had superheated water, hostile to everything but the humble bacterium. The Hawai'ian lava flows were composed of molten rock, in which nothing at all could thrive. But in SIMULACRUM, the firepools were innate, not emergent. Fire itself. Coalesced in liquid form.\n\nI visited the wonders of those firepools many, many times. Each and every visit was marvelous simply for the novelty alone. \n\nBut one day things were different. The firepools were more than alien and beautiful. On that day, they produced something emergent.\n\nLife.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n+ REDO \"Denizen\" primary specification\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Zootypic Elemental Natural Simulations. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b4/SpecificImmuneResponse-2.svg/512px-SpecificImmuneResponse-2.svg.png?20140523131053|caption=A typical Zen Life Cycle, represented using native REDO symbology.]]\n\n**Short name:** \"Zens\".\n\nDefinition: A REDO denizen dependent on elements within REDO and only capable of perceiving world through that lens.\n\nREDO Zens were the native inhabitants of the REDO environment. Zens were dependent completely on the alternate system of physics within REDO. Zens emerged naturally from the initial conditions of the REDO sandbox after roughly 500 million simulation years. Although Zens appeared to respond to external stimuli, they were dependent heavily on data-objects and functions of a specific \"type\", a datatype internal to REDO and were not believed to have true sentience.\n\nConstrained to the REDO sandbox.\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\nAdditionally, ZenScientists (Scientists who base their careers off of studying Zens, or those who roleplay as such) within the REDO simulation classify Zens by the following emergent properties:\n* **Density:** A measure of the total amount of REDO Base Element relative to other Zens of comparable size.\n* **Coherence:**  How well a Zen can exert \"physical force\" by manipulating the Base Element comprising its own body.\n* **Solidity:**  How well a Zen resists \"physical force\"\n* **Projection:** Ability of a Zen to manipulate Base Element from a distance\n* **Resistance:** How difficult it is for another Zen to manipulate the Base Element comprising a Zen\n* **Alacrity:**  How quickly a Zen's Base Element responds to changes in intention.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n**Naturally aggressive and strongly susceptible to social structures:** Simulation architects imposed a goal to create networks of life that would naturally tend towards strongly hierarchical structures. A secondary property of this effect enabled recreational control of Zens by outsiders, enabling use of REDO as recreational sandbox.\n\n**Experienced life in discrete stages:** After sufficient experience/age, Zens would transform to the next stage of life instead of aging continuously. In part, this was to save computational power by not simulating senescence. In another part, this was an emergent property inherited from the Wu Xing transitional systems.\n\n**Naturally immortal:** If defeated/destroyed, regenerated at an earlier stage of life. Property inserted by simulation architects. As Zens were never marked as deleted, they were exempt from typical SIMULACRUM scheduled cluster deletion routines.\n\nAdditional properties were largely emergent, and embedded Sandbox researchers developed idiosyncratic domain-specific language for these properties.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nTo this species that could not know death, could never know the end, combat was merely a form of play. I could not enter their world without wearing an avatar woven of REDO itself, and among them I was as deathless as they were. They could not hurt me.\n\nI suppose your next question is how I felt. I was proud -- immensely proud. The feeling of a father beholding his son, the Karcist beholding his flock, the mage beholding his familiar. Jehovah on the Seventh Day, Adam in the Garden.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nCombat, a form of play.\n\nWere they inherently violent?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nNo mother wants to believe her son is a killer.\n\nBut no. Violence is an impulse to destroy. To steal, pilfer, take. To ruin what another values in pursuit of one's own enrichment.\n\nThe very thoughts were alien to them. They were born into a world that responded to their very whims. The Zens of the firepools bent the flames to their whims like programmers with code. The Zens of the deepest earth swam through the bedrock as easily as the meatfish of meatspace through water. \n\nThey were the world and the world was them.\n\nNo. They were not violent.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nAnd what did they think of this world?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\n//Think.//\n\nA loaded word.\n\nYou and I are digital, ones and zeros arranged by magic words, woven into something resembling a brain.\n\nBut I didn't make them some crude imitation of evolution's pinnacle. I didn't build them at all.\n\nI poured reagents into a cauldron and let them stew a billion years. A cauldron so plentiful they had no need to take.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nSuppose that they did.\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n\n[[>]]\nDid what?\n[[/>]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nTake.\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[>]]\nDon't mock me.\n[[/>]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nWhat would drive them to something so against their nature?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n+ Access Interfaces\n\n------\n\nLike many experimental sandboxed environments, REDO was accessible from other simulation layers. In these higher simulations, subsimulations would be marketed using locally-appropriate jargon and motifs in order to disguise the nature of **SIMULACRUM.**\n\nAs outsiders entered REDO, they started changing the environment to suit their desires and cultural expectations, separating REDO into distinct zones reflecting the home simulations of its visitors. It became a popular pastime to adventure through REDO with a team of account-bound Zens that were compelled to obey only their owners' commands. The unique regenerative features of Zens led to the establishment of sport-fighting and a thriving Player-vs-Player community, as well as strong emotional bonds between players and their Zens and the spread of Zens iconography through other simulations as a brand.\n\nSample of advertisement of REDO recreational use:\n\nFuture City simulation:\n\n[[=image hercules.jpg]]\n\nDiamond City simulation:\n\n[[=image vr.png]]\n\nAI land simulation:\n[[=image Complex-gamma.jpg]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nAdvertisements?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThey came to me, our masters, once they saw my success.

Robert Cordol, one of the early adopters of SIMULACRUM, one of the few souls originally born in flesh.  A user of all sorts of Zens, who'd held the title for a thousand championships. Jakob Reigen, a rapidly rising star in the simulation. A new face, yet he felt familiar for some odd reason, and he commanded a team of thunder-metal Zens. All in Hyperdrome City, a sleek industrial and business complex of physics-defying chrome towers ten hundred stories tall, glowing with blue light, all to support the industry of Zenfighting. The Redozen Combat League. Cities that put Hong Kong and Eurtec and New York to shame, all to support arenas for Zenfighting.\n\nAnother year of industry, all on hold to support a single match.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[div style=\"font-style:italic\"]]\nChampion Cordol and Challenger Reigen bow to each other.\n\nChairman Forge chops his hand in front of himself. The match begins.\n\nBriefly, translucent panes flash in front of Cordol and Reigen, each one displaying six ZENS. Both select a ZEN. Their bodies start glowing, dark green for Reigen, black for Cordol. The light flows into the field of battle, coalescing into Zens.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nI am unfamiliar with the architecture of the sandbox. What happened in this interaction?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nZens are emergent. Their configurations could be stored and restored as metadata. Once bound to a user, they could live wherever in the simulation suited them best -- or even in stasis -- and then be summoned, fully capable for battle, taking advantage of their status as data lifeforms.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nIt seems risky. \n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nWe solved data fidelity and transmission years ago.

Madness.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[div style=\"font-style:italic\"]]\nCordol's black light coalesces into a pitch-black leopard, save for two eyes that are bright pinpricks of light. The shadows in the Hyperdrome Arena darken.\n\nReigen's green light outlines the wireframe of a four-legged draconic beast with cascading plates of armor. The armor populates. When finished rendering, the effect is akin to chainmail. Blue fire dances from between each layer of armor, like a gas burner on its lowest setting.\n\nCordol's leopard lunges. The arena falls under the spell of shadow. The audience gasps as the battlefield is plunged into pitch darkness, save for the shimmering blue fire of Reigen's dragon.\n\nThe dragon roars.\n\nThe fires gushes outwards, blasting back Cordol's darkness. Cordol's leopard is revealed.\n\nReigen's dragon lunges.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nI am unfamiliar with the architecture of the sandbox. What happened in this interaction?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[>]]\nDeja vu.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nThe REDO sandbox has over a million cycles' worth of logging corresponding to over ten billion users with bug reports and post-mortem reports in commensurate degree. I cannot identify the most relevant parts myself.\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThe architecture of their minds.  Their very selves. The documentation explains better than I can.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n+ Architecture\n\n------\n\nThe programs housed within project REDO were designed with system architecture such that their perception of existence was completely and wholly dependent on the base elemental system parameters (\"base elements\") of project REDO. \n\nAny stimuli were interpreted wholly as base elements, possessing a magnitude and directional source, although many of these were hidden under layers of abstraction to attempt to create more lifelike appearances.\n\n[[=image neuralnet.png]]\n\nThough the visual/physical representations of these Zens were likewise formed of the base elements, it was not the entirety of the Zen's system identity and computational resource allocation. A Zen existed both as its physical representation and as the base elements it was able to influence in its simulated vicinity.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nIn a word, the concept of \"body\" is nothing to a Zen. They are element and mind. We see them before us, in this long-lost memory you've returned to me, but the darkness, the fire, the clashing of the two -- those elements are extensions of them. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nI see.\n\nIs there any insight to be gained from the remainder of their match?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThe brutality of those who visit REDO must be seen to be believed.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nLet us skip ahead, then.\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n[[div style=\"font-style:italic\"]]\nCordol and Reigen are both down to one Zen apiece. The crowd is roaring with anticipation. The ground shakes.\n\nEach is glowing with light -- Cordol in black, Reigen in green. They each raise their right hands. The light flows forth, calling forth their respective ace Zens.\n\nCordol's ace is a slim humanoid figure, stretching twelve feet tall. It has six arms, all deathly pale, each ending in a spindly hand with four fingers. Each fingertip glows cyan.\n\nReigen's ace is another dragon. This one is snake-like, lithe, and feminine, colored magenta and purple.  Though it is a thin creature, it bends and curves upon itself in such a way as to look voluptuous. Pairs of bulbous liquid-filled sacs dot its body periodically.\n\nThe fight begins.\n\nCordol's crooked man charges forward, talons of blue light extending from its fingertips, poised to penetrate Reigen's dragon.\n\nThe sacs on Reigen's dragon swell, then burst. Noxious acid, colored fluorescent purple and green, spews forth, spilling towards the crooked man. It dodges, stepping deftly between the gouts of acid, which eat into the floor, forming pools.\n\nBut the dragon does not relent. Bulbous sac after bulbous sac swells and bursts, until the heavens are deluged with acid.\n\nCordol's crooked man does not hesitate. Its blue talons shimmer and solidify into a thicket of Metal element, claws interwoven so tightly they form layers upon layers of barriers. The acid splashes harmlessly off of it, falling to the side, and the crooked man carves a path to Reigen's dragon.\n\nReigen laughs.\n\nThe dragon coils and turns its head towards the crooked man. It opens its mouth.\n\nIt spits a stream of fire.\n\nThe crowd screams as Cordol's crooked man vanishes in the glut of flame. The metal talons melt away under the barrage.\n\nCordol remains calm.\n\nA minute passes. The flames continue.\n\nReigen's dragon rears back and closes its mouth, ending the flame. The air is thick with heat haze. The ground is coated with the remaining fire, slowly sputtering out.\n\nA silhouette emerges.\n\nThe crooked man stands. It approaches, relentless.\n\nReigen shouts, commands his dragon to attack once more. To call forth lightning from heaven. To burst its remaining poison sacs. To spew whatever fire it still commands.\n\nAnd still the crooked man approaches.\n\nCordol gives the slightest twitch of a finger. A poised gesture, but a depressingly casual one.\n\nThe crooked man extends its six arms, like the spokes of a wheel. On each arm, it splays all four of its fingers, like twigs growing from tree branches. Each begins glowing iridescently.\n\nFor the briefest second, it seems vulnerable.\n\nAnd then it strikes. Twenty-four jabs, each directed at pressure points. With every blow, a miniature explosion of Base Element.\n\nThe dragon writhes. Screams of agony, from both the Zen and Reigen. And still Cordol's crooked man does not relent.\n\nAnd then it falls still. Becomes green light, flows back to Reigen. And the crooked man stands tall.

His appetites were elsewhere. If you'll allow me a digression from this final championship...\n\n{{ACCESSING MEMORY EXTRACT...}}\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"expoblock\"]]\n+ Memory Extract\n\n------\n **Location:** Safari Wilderness, REDO\n\n**Actor 1:** Dr. Robert Cordol (Champion (REDO), Director (Foundation)... {{27 other}})\n\n**Actor 2:** Dr. Alistair Forge (Chairman (REDOZEN League), Architect (REDO))\n\n------\n[[div style=\"font-style:italic\"]]\nChampion Cordol, wearing his all-black suit, stands in the midst of the Safari Wilderness, one of the few areas of REDO dedicated for continued evolution and natural existence, in contrast to the cities settled by REDO users. \n\nFifty meters away, a herd of Zens resembling bison graze peacefully. Thick flocks of bird Zens dance through the sky, as dark as clouds. Snake Zens and mouse Zens and mongoose Zens fight each other, snapping and biting at each other. Occasionally, sparks and flashes of color -- base element manifestation -- appear.\n\nCordol brings up a REDO infopanel. He selects two Zens, which manifest in his hands.\n\nIn his right hand, a Zen resembling a revolver, but instead of spaces for bullets  in its cylinder, it has angry red eyes. \n\nIn his left hand, a Zen that brings to mind a magnifying glass or lens. He grips it by its tail, and the shade of the \"glass\" dilates and blurs as it notices the other Zens in the field.\n\nCordol smiles. He raises both Zens in front of him and starts shooting.\n\nThe bison Zen stampede as soon as the first one among them falls, struck down by a blast of Mind element from Cordol's Lens. He picks them off methodically with blasts of Fire Element from his Revolver, each shot catalyzing the residual Fire Element in the bison Zen to catastrophically destabilize and explode. A chain reaction triggers. Soon, the herd burns.\n\nCordol takes a deep breath. The air smells like barbecue. It's familiar.\n\nAll too familiar.\n\nHe sighs.\n\nHe raises his guns to the sky next. From the lens, he shoots a hole clear through a flock of bird Zens, a blast of mingled Darkness Element and Lightning Element -- not enough to impact the flock as a whole, as the collective quickly fills in the void left by their fallen brethren. He has planned for this.\n\n{{VERDICT: Chaos - Hole in the Sky}}\n\nThe sky darkens, and thunderclouds form. His Lens Zen coos to the heavens, and they reciprocate with thunderbolts. Cordol stands firm, fearless, and he takes no damage. His Lens Zen purrs as the skies feed it lightning without any regard for what stands in their way. A slow trickle at first becomes a wild frenzy of a hundred bolts a second from every corner of the sky.\n\nIt starts raining birds. \n\nCordol sighs.\n\nAs for the mice and snake and mongoose Zens -- well, for them he is content to watch. The winner of that particular fight might have some potential.\n\nHis reverie is interrupted.\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n**FORGE:** Had your fun?\n\n**CORDOL:** Have you ever been to a barbecue, Forge? There's something instinctual in the human brain that gets activated by the smell of roasting meat. The Maillard reaction spilling umami compounds into the air. Triggering our hunger. Our satiety.\n\n//Cordol points his gun at the roasting corpses of the bison Zens.//\n\n**CORDOL:** Almost reminds me of that. But not quite. Like everything else here, it falls short.\n\n**FORGE:** Imagine if the crowds could see you now. The undefeatable champion, Robert Cordol. Terrorizing the innocent. Ruining with wild abandon.\n\n**CORDOL:** Spare me the fuckin' sanctimony, Forge. \n\n**FORGE:** A whole world simply full of wonder, and you resort to this. Mindless animal slaughter.\n\n//Cordol points his revolver at Forge and fires six multicolored bullets. Forge does not react. The bullets bend around him and impact the ground harmlessly.//\n\n**FORGE:** Such incivility. Are the wonders of a new form of life not enough for you?\n\n**CORDOL:** Give me a break. Life. This isn't life. It's a model, a toy. I'm breaking a toy that's going to put itself back together again the instant I leave.\n\n**FORGE:** You wound me.\n\n**CORDOL:** I didn't know you had anything in you to hurt.\n\n//Cordol watches the mongoose, snake, and mice Zens fighting. They seem to be at a stalemate.//\n\n**CORDOL:** I've done this sort of thing  countless times. I'm sure you've seen them all. The first time was... terrifying. I thought I was testing the limits of your simulation. Thought for sure I'd reach a barrier or a limit you'd imposed, run into some rollback threshold that would stop me from doing too much damage. The second time was just to make sure I hadn't imagined the whole thing. I didn't think you'd actually let it happen. And that second time, they remembered me. They knew fear. And every time after that was more and more exhilarating. To have this kind of power over life or death is something I haven't felt in years, not since we stopped using D-Class. And I know you've seen it all. You've seen every hunt I've had. Every massacre. So why now?\n\n**FORGE:** Because, old friend, I think you are bored.\n\n**CORDOL:** You fuckin' serious?\n\n**FORGE:** Exhilaration comes from the unexpected. But you've done these hunts a thousand times by now. You've exhausted every iteration of elemental interference. You've struck the birds down with lightning from the heavens and with pillars from the earth. And you've seen what they do. Each and every time. Tell me, old friend. Does my world hold any surprises for you anymore?\n\n**CORDOL:** No.\n\n//The two men stare at each other.//\n\n**CORDOL:** So, what. You want me to leave? To get out and stop blowing up your perfect little world now that you think it's not good enough for me?\n\n**FORGE:** On the contrary. I thought I'd give you advance warning of an update I'm planning. Something that might make your time here more... worth your while. \n\n**CORDOL:** Nothing out of this digital primordial sludge is worth jack shit anymore.\n\n**FORGE:** I'll be breaking my own rules, once and forevermore. A Zen not forged from artificial evolution but from my own intelligent design. Something, I hope, that can challenge even you.\n\n//Cordol says nothing.//\n\n**FORGE:** I call it Signus.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nSignus. \"Sig-nus\".

Puppets of new gods from above, or nothing more than the sum total of our genetics and our memeplexes. \n\nI never revealed Signus, never brought it to fruition.

He was part of the first generation to live his entire childhood within **SIMULACRUM** before being assigned to a suitable role as a Foundation system operator, as part of initial exploratory efforts to optimize system resources by delegating to biological minds.\n\nDr. Forge has no biological children and no intent to have any, but views the Zens of REDO as akin to his own children despite their verified nonsentience. Forge has dedicated a significant portion of time to determining whether the Zens might be sentient; such efforts are ongoing.\n\nDr. Forge is notable in being one of the few individuals with knowledge of REDO intimate enough to address \"Zen Malaise.\" Zen Malaise is the systemic glitch in which users of REDO become incapable of controlling Zens and occasionally suffer simulation-level fatal integrity damage due to such incapability. These periods of instability occur largely when Forge has been assigned to alternate projects, and he is the most effective at solving them.\n\nDr. Forge continues to make upgrades to REDO. The latest update to REDO introduces \"Composite Elements\", which aim to allow for greater flexibility in combat simulations. Forge is currently working on a secret grand update to REDO. More details shall be forthcoming.\n\n**LATEST BACKUP:** {{DATA CORRUPTED}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nYou are the latest \"you\" we have.\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nPreposterous.

Real-time, you understand, unbound from the clock cycles of the hardware and software. That could, at times, be a second within the simulation. But at other times it could be years, decades, centuries, depending on the load to the system. Our masters only gave us so much computing power, after all, but they directed ever more souls to my playground. If time was lost, it was no fault of mine.\n\nSomething in your story doesn't add up, either.\n\nYou say this is a hypothetical situation, and yet you grill me on these understandable flaws in my memory. When I am but a backup, the pale imitation of a much greater man. You ask a forked mind why it doesn't recall another fork, knowing full well you won't return me to my whole either. I die with this interrogation as surely as you do.\n\nYou wouldn't be asking me these things if you didn't already suspect that a version of me was planning something. That's reasonable enough.

A land where the battles and championships are as cyclical as the turning of the seasons. A world where morality is nothing more than a child's game, where the world goes to the strongest. Where your story, no matter where it begins, ends here. At the championship, or strewn broken along the road to it.\n\nNature has been tamed. The wild has been conquered. The only wilderness truly left is the thrill of battle against your fellow man.\n\nThat will all change soon.\n\nSoon, I shall introduce to this world a new challenge. A trial meant for even the strongest, that shall test not only your strength in battle, but the strength of your soul. A key that will unlock the deepest secrets of REDO for those who might grasp it, and an elixir that shall grant eternal life.\n\nThe ultimate Zen. Signus. \n\nThere will be little fanfare to the full release. I tell you now so you might be aware -- but the power of Signus will be not just for the strongest nor the kindest, but also the craftiest, the wisest, the most industrious.

Constructing bodies from REDO elements, that felt human enough for mortal minds to pilot without questioning their own reality. -- that required the creation of the Mind Element Allowing those bodies enough access to bind with and control Zens -- a futher expansion of the Mind Element. Creating a way to store and transport Zens using SIMULACRUM infrastructure, not REDO infrastructure -- impossible, with the initial parameters of the Metal and Thunder Elements, so I had to tweak those. \n\nAll of these functionalities already existed. I moved them from behind the curtain onto the stage itself.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nThis \"Sarkic\" element. It seems a bit antithetical to the whole idea of REDO in the first place. Existing entirely on its own. Not having any meaningful interaction with the other elements, preventing emergent properties. Very powerful, but only upon itself. \n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[>]]\nThe word Sarkic was chosen as a... shorthand.\n[[/>]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nDon't play coy, Doctor. A shorthand for what?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThe Sarkics of the old world were a diverse ethnological group, you see. But the common element of their mythology was that their legendary founder, Ion, had conquered and slain God. And yet to the mundane world they were communities, trapped in squalor. Capable, at best, of healing their own ills, of bending their own bones and blood vessels. A people who were rooted in their own flesh, yet with dreams of transgressing to the divine.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nWhat were you trying to achieve with the creation of this \"Sarkic\" element?\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nI had sought immortality at first.\n\nEven in **SIMULACRUM**, we have a form of death. Our biological bodies are, of course, mortal, and should those fail, our minds inevitably follow. Despite our best efforts, this link remains. Anyone originally from a biological substrate eventually ceases to exist in **SIMULACRUM** should their bodies die. It may take a million simulated years, or a billion -- but eventually death comes.\n\nOur digital minds, too, are susceptible to corruption. I have watched colleagues become fragmented and segfaulted as they traversed between simulations, decaying and losing parts of themselves to pointer misallocation and garbage collection, without the privileged cycling of XPlain. Our minds, as these biological neural networks formed from evolution, were simply not intended for digital existence.\n\nThe Zens had an enforced neoteny via reversion.

The simulated year in Neo-Esterberg as of this footage is 2060.\n\nAs a result, the average occupant of Neo-Esterberg possesses Type-Blue simulation write access[[footnote]]Type Blue simulation write access provides users with elevated environmental write privileges similar to \"magical\" abilities from baseline reality. The term refers to a large suite of abilities built upon manipulating the Elan-Vital Emulation layer.[[/footnote]]. The architecture of Neo-Esterberg is a hybrid of classical Polish design and fae design.\n\n\n[[=image capitalism.jpg]]\n\nTranscript:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nSCP-7335 appears in the simulation.

Randomly, residents of Neo-Esterberg spontaneously develop theriocephaly[[footnote]]Animal heads.[[/footnote]]. These phenomena are associated with the Tyrant Queen Mab, a mythological autocrat within the backstory of Neo-Esterberg described as possessing ontokinetic abilities. [[footnote]]The **SIMULACRUM** environment has replaced nomenclative phenomena and their associated ESHU protocols with pointer-association protocols; as a result, nomenclative phenomena are effectively neutralized and fae threats hold no significant power.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe inhabitants of Neo-Esterberg notice SCP-7335. Type-Blue inhabitants begin attacking it with thaumaturgical attacks, including burning projectiles, electrical discharges, and simulated EVE spheres. SCP-7335 allows these attacks to hit. It does not appear to be affected.\n\nSCP-7335 alters the skybox of Neo-Esterberg to the texture of an image of Mab synthesized from the memory corpora of Neo-Esterberg.

The sky is overcast with black clouds of Darkness Element, infested with arcing streaks of Lightning Element. The air is thick with Ground Element and Water Element and Fire Element, creating a viscous lukewarm paste upon his skin.\n\nMount Ultolympic is the furthest location from all of REDO's cities, where the gods are said to forge their weapons of war. \n\nHe is aware this is bullshit. Mount Ultolympic has, recently, in the past 50,000 years or so in REDOtime, been the workshop of Dr. Alistair Forge. The place he's introduced his newest innovations, unorthodox Elements that have no basic analogue in meatspace. Where he tests the limits imposed upon him.\n\nAfter hundreds of years of exploration and hunting, Cordol is certain that this is where Signus lies.\n\nExplosions of raw Base Element shake the nearby mountains, hills, and treetops. A purple-green stream of Dragon Element rockets from the ground into the dark sky, shimmering like an aurora borealis. He grimaces. It wasn't enough to simply have creatures shaped like dragons, but now Forge has introduced the element of \"Dragon\", whatever that's supposed to mean. \n\nHe almost doesn't notice the black sphere nestled in the trees just before him.\n\nIt blinks.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nThis is very cinematic, very sarcastic, for a top-secret transcript of a lost memory.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nThe log, of course, is raw machine code.

A black sphere is suspended in the air before him, held in place by a pearlescent sphere of Air Base Element. Two of Robert's Zens stand besides him -- a white wheel with hexagonal symmetry and large unblinking eyes, and a humanoid with sharp pins sticking out of its body at 1-inch intervals, that has only a mouth on its face. Its teeth are needles.//\n\n**CORDOL:** Well, well. Another one of you, away from prying eyes.\n\n//Cordol nods to the needleman Zen. It pulls out two needles from its flesh. They glint menacingly as the Metal Element polarizes.//\n\n**CORDOL:** //Precision Needle.//\n\n//The needleman holds the two needles equidistant from the black orb. Then, it pierces the black orb gingerly. A high pitched tone rings through the area.//\n\n**CORDOL:** See, //regular users// all think that these black orbs that showed up throughout REDO are lootboxes. Bundles of experience points that can be defeated easily to grant Zens lots of battle experience and extra Base Element. But you and I, friend... we know the truth, don't we?\n\n**CORDOL:** //Vivisection.//\n\n//The needleman gyrates. The twin needles in the orb splay outwards, splitting the black sphere into hundreds of conical segments. They attempt to dissolve back into Base Element, but the Air Element sphere prevents them from desubstantiating.//\n\n//Cordol summons a REDO datapane and activates the Analysis function.//\n\n**CORDOL:** Run a diagnostic.\n\n**SYSTEM:** {{The isolated substance is composed of 50% Cyber, 50% Sarkic Base Element in hybrid-synergetic eutecticity.

Words that make sense to one deeply immersed within the game of REDO, but not to anyone else.\n\nOr, I suppose:\n\nEvery Protagonanite on its own looks like a Zen of its own, with its own unique properties. But only when a thousand are together in one place does Signus appear. An emergent property. \n\nAlone, they are a single-celled organism. But put them together, and they start to act as a whole.\n\nDoes that make sense?\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nYes.\n\nI can't access what he's seeing. {{ACCESSING MACHINE LAYER...}}\n[[/div]]\n[[<image bufly_normal.png]]\n[[div class=\"forge\"]]\nNo need. It was an intentional design limitation of REDO. Supposedly, it was to respect the privacy of visitors, whoever they might be.\n\nBut I think the real answer was rather more complicated. I was told I was to have the power of creation, along with my fellows. We would build new worlds, and once we were done, we could create mirror images of ourselves, simulations and servitors, who could continue the good work, the routine work, while we retreated deeper into our paradises, our heavens, our sandboxes. We could relax in paradise forever, while copies of ourselves did the work.\n\nYet in truth we were servants. Servitors. Serfs, told we were gods.\n\nAnd you can't have serfs knowing the will of heaven.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"mariposa\"]]\nEven if you could, would it have done you much good?\n\nWe are knowledgeable, but not omniscient.

Thin blue lines of incarnated Water Element weave around it, forming a grand circle around Cordol.\n\nA dragon, looping around itself three times, like the holes in a pair of brass knuckles. Upon looking closer, it seems to be many smaller serpents, some jade, some white, each biting the tail of the one before it, all chained together into a greater beast. The wind blows heavily around it, forming a vortex with Cordol at its center, with occasional static pops of lightning. Air-Element.\n\nA jagged column of solid red. Hot to the touch and glowing with firelight. Seven small rods of red. They orbit the column, then circumnavigate the Universe Turtle, then orbit again. This process repeats. There is a thick heat haze. Fire-Element.\n\nA small bronzed beast that has the snout of a pig and the horns of a bull. It sits on its haunches cutely and snorts. Earth-Element.\n\nA dome of all wings and feathers, colored pure black. The flapping wings overlap each other entirely. Nothing can escape. Death-Element.\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"font-style:italic\"]]\nCordol is suffused with black light. Streams of it leap from his body to protagonanite after protagonanite, like plasma filaments.

The Water Baboon gesticulates faster and faster, and the water around them forms more and more ornate patterns. The Storm Dragon speeds up, as does its winds; the Red Column pulses hotter and faster, and its Rods fly so fast they become almost invisible. \n\nAbove, the flapping of black wings.\n\nThe protagonanites are forced closer, forced inward. Cordol's black light blasts outward in sweeping beams, catching multiple protagonanites at once, tinging them his particular shade of black as he seeks to assert dominance.\n\nAnd yet they keep breaking free.\n\nA few protagonanites escape from his interdiction zone -- very few, but some nonetheless. They make their way past Cordol's six gatekeepers, and upon reaching the open air, dissolve into Cyber particles and return to the world, to their higher selves.\n\nHe collapses to his knees.

He raises his gun and his lens and shoots, peppering Signus with bullets of Base Element, to little effect.\n\nThe baboon gestures and incants; a glyph of Water Element forms behind it, and the climate bends around them.

Yet traces of their valiant battle remain: a sharp gleaming in the air of the faintest afterimages of the baboon's magical arrays, a heady ozone from the dragon's frolicking, and embers that glimmer and hold stagnant in the sky.\n\nAcross the blasted plain of crystal glass, Signus remains. Smaller, now. Standing on two feet, almost like a human, yet still indubitably a swan. Diminished, but not broken.\n\nCordol glows with black light. He swings his arm in a circle above his head and shapes the light into a lasso. And the lasso flies towards Signus, settling around it. Caging it.\n\nHe strains.
