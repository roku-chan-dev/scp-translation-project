As such, SCP-8209 is considered neutralized.\n\n------\n\n**Archived Special Containment Procedures (active Dec 2020):** Residents of Habakkuk, North Dakota have been told that, due to a legal technicality stemming from a quirk in the town charter, Habakkuk is technically blocked from obtaining state aid for its school district. To resolve the issue, they have been told, a new town is being established under the same name and legal code and with essentially identical boundaries. Because of the onerous paperwork associated with dissolving a municipality, the former town is to be renamed Habakkuk_2 and its limits redefined to solely encompass 100 square yards of brownfield in the town’s outlying woodlands. \n\nIn fact, the above measures are being undertaken to limit SCP-8209’s area of effect and permit complete Foundation control over the drafting of municipal laws to which SCP-8209 is subject.\n\nAfter a new town charter is obtained for Habakkuk, the former Habakkuk Municipal Code, now re-titled the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code, is to be rewritten to reduce the number of seats on the Habakkuk_2 City Council from 12 to 3. To ensure that the Foundation holds voting control over the Habakkuk_2 City Council, the only three individuals permitted to officially reside in Habakkuk_2 are Drs. Oded Shimoni, Ghulam Hazrat, and Courtney Spangler. \n\nSnap elections will be held for all city council seats due to the loss of Habakkuk_2 residency of all prior members of the city council following the change in town boundaries; after these snap elections, the roster of members of the Habakkuk_2 City Council will consist of Drs. Oded Shimoni, Ghulam Hazrat, and Courtney Spangler, with Oded Shimoni holding the chairmanship.\n\nAfter the Habakkuk_2 City Council is elected, tests will be held to ensure the continuing efficacy of SCP-8209, identify its limits, and test its practicability for assisting in containment of other anomalies. If successful, SCP-8209 may be utilized to help discipline humanoid anomalies.\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-8209 was an anomalous phenomenon that caused any individual who violated a city law of Habakkuk, North Dakota to instantaneously and subjectively experience the maximal punishment prescribed by the relevant law. Individuals subject to this effect would forget their experience immediately after its completion, though psychological impacts typically remained. \n\n------\n\n**Discovery:** Although precise identification of the SCP-8209 anomaly’s relationship with the Habakkuk Municipal Code required several months of clandestine testing, the initial anomaly was flagged when, at a Great Plains-spanning psychiatry conference, one attendee mentioned to a Foundation operative that many of her patients suffer a “brief, deep sense of loss” whenever they drive through Habakkuk. (As the portion of the freeway that passes through Habakkuk is a known speed trap, and the Habakkuk Municipal Code technically permits temporary confinement as a punishment for speeding, these individuals are presumed to have instantaneously suffered the subjective effect of being fined and briefly imprisoned.)\n\n------\n\n**Addendum:** Testing logs, as well as relevant project team discussions and write-ups of the minutes of city council meetings, are presented below. Due to their significance in provoking Incident 01.16, which led directly to the neutralization of SCP-8209, communications between Dr. Shimoni, Director Ahe Kahele, Rabbi Issachar Levy, and / or unnamed HR personnel are presented contemporaneously.[[footnote]] We understand that the publication of communications between Dr. Shimoni and Rabbi Levy may make readers concerned about the confidentiality of discussions with site chaplains. **There is no reason to be concerned.** [[/footnote]]\n\n------\n\n**December 12 Testing:**\n\n> = **TESTING LOG**\n> \n> //Dr. Shimoni places a debit card, with $1,001 upon it, atop a table and instructs D-14328 to ‘steal’ it.

D-14328 complies. Immediately upon picking up the card, D-14328 drops the card, stares into space, and begins weeping. Five minutes later, once D-14328 has composed himself, he is asked if he knows why he was weeping. He says that he does not.//\n> \n> //Dr. Shimoni places a debit card, with $10,001 upon it, atop a table and suggests that D-14328 ‘steal’ it.

Check that, of course, but if you take him there, you can stand outside Habakkuk and have him cross that road to take the card. You’re outside, he’s inside.

(Stealing a debit card with $50,001 or more upon it is a Class A felony under North Dakota law, carrying a maximum sentence of twenty years in prison and a $20,000 fine.) D-14328 picks up the card and collapses to the ground, assuming an expression that Shimoni described as ‘hollow.’ Shimoni crosses the road to help him up. Upon being helped up, D-14328 begins walking in an awkward circle, having apparently developed a slight limp (presumably due to a lack of exercise in his past 20 subjective years of life.) After thirty seconds, he focuses his gaze on Dr. Shimoni and charges at him, apparently intending to seize his sidearm. Shimoni and D-14328 topple to the earth; however, immediately upon making contact with Dr. Shimoni, D-14328 goes limp and begins weeping uncontrollably. On the assumption that he ideated a desire to kill Dr. Shimoni during his twenty years of subjective imprisonment, he is presumed to have technically committed a premeditated act of attempted murder, which carries a potential life sentence under North Dakota law. Actuarial analysis suggests that he experienced approximately forty years of imprisonment, followed by subjective death.//\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ **Director Ahe Kahele**\n\n+++++ (Sender: Dr. Oded Shimoni)\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Done.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Shoot, you turned that log around quickly.

For access, please contact Director Kahele’s office.//\n\n------\n\nResults from December 12 and December 13 testing were sufficiently convincing to provoke the establishment of a new town charter (‘New Habakkuk’, formally Habakkuk); the renaming of ‘old Habakkuk’ to Habakkuk_2 and the restriction of its town limits to a single patch of field with 3 ‘inhabitants’; and the ‘election’ of Dr. Shimoni, as well as Drs. Ghulam Hazrat and Courtney Spangler, to the Habakkuk_2 City Council. \n\nIn the interests of urgency and to prevent disproportionate resource usage, the Foundation Legal Department declined to perform a full rewrite of the Habakkuk_2 Municipal Code; however, the explicit grandfathering-in of federal and state law was eliminated, to prevent any body besides the Habakkuk_2 City Council from influencing the legal code that governs SCP-8209. \n\nThe above processes were performed between December 16 and December 28, 2020, during which time all SCP-8209 testing was suspended. During this time, Dr. Shimoni sought out spiritual support from Rabbi Issachar Levy, a chaplain at Site-19.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ **Rabbi Issachar Levy**\n\n+++++ (Sender: Dr. Oded Shimoni)\n\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Shalom! I know we haven’t really spoken, but my name’s Oded. I’m based out of Site-48, and I could really use a little advice.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Sure thing! What can I help you with?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]It’s going to sound a little bit silly.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]I don’t think I’m an especially good Jew.

For members of religions that teach that people are saved by grace, by faith, then the things that we’re exposed to every day can really test their relationship with their religion. Because once you lose your faith, it’s hard to find it again.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]As for us, we have a list of mitzvot that demand concrete satisfaction; we have obligations that we owe to ourselves and to others, obligations that Hashem commands us to fulfill. For the kabbalists, those mitzvot facilitate the reunion of the Shechinah with the Tiferet. And for the rest of us, they’re simply our purest mode of prayer.[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]You don’t need to actively seek your faith again; if you’ve lost it, it’ll come back. For us, what you are is what you do.\n[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]I mean, that’s very sweet.

But I’d like to finish this first.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]In that case, I think we’ll have to talk a little bit more about what you call ‘the things you do.’[[/span]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]The good news is that Yom Kippur is in September this year.

Usage of SCP-8209 for disciplinary purposes is as flagrantly unethical as the use of a stockade or of an electric collar; if its mechanisms of pain were not invisible, the obscenity of its deployment would be obvious to all. \n\nIn sum, working for the SCP-8209 project team is utterly irreconcilable with my moral and spiritual commitments, and I would like to leave as soon as is practicable.\n\nAll the best,\nDr. Oded Shimoni\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Oded Shimoni (oshimoni2@scp.foundation)\n**From:** Site-48 Director Ahe Kahele (akahele@scp.foundation)\n**Subject:** Re: Rotation request\n[[/div]]\n------\nOded,\n\nI hope that email felt good to write.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s not a request that we can accommodate. \n\nMy understanding is that the Habakkuk_2 City Council is legally mandated to meet January 1, with follow-up testing planned.

We have reached quorum. Courtney, could you talk me through what we’re approving today?\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** The long and short of it is that we don’t know how, if at all, death is experienced within SCP-8209; that is, whether a punishment that would be fatal in the real world is experienced as such. If people experience a loss of sensation at the moment of subjective death, then two identically fatal punishments would be expected to have identical responses. If they don’t- if they keep experiencing even beyond the typical point of death- then it might vary.\n> \n> **SHIMONI:** Does the second one have to be quite so long? Like, wouldn’t we be able to tell the difference between two minutes and an hour?\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** I suppose we would. But people can have very different responses, so the difference in duration would have to be so immense that it would overpower any plausible difference in reaction to the same duration.\n> \n> **SHIMONI:** Can we put it at just a day, then? I really just don’t see why we’d need to do //three months.//\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** Sure; for the chairman, anything.\n> \n> **HAZRAT:** All right, let me annotate my copy real quick. Oded, would this language work for you?\n> \n> **SHIMONI:** Yeah, fine.\n> \n> **HAZRAT:** Courtney?\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** Works for me as well.\n> \n> **SHIMONI:** We will now vote on Councilman Spangler’s legislation. All in favor, say ‘Aye’; all opposed, say ‘Nay.’ Aye.\n> \n> **HAZRAT:** Aye.\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** Aye.\n> \n> **SHIMONI:** Carried. Not sure we’re following Robert’s Rules //exactly//, but it seems like the old city council didn’t either.\n> \n> **HAZRAT:** By the way, Oded, I have a //really strange// testing idea that I haven’t fully written up the enabling legislation for. But I don’t want to wait until February 1. Is there some route to hold a special session?

It has become clear that my work at the SCP Foundation is ethically untenable.\n\nI know that we have a second city council meeting scheduled on January 13; at that meeting, I intend to resign my seat on the city council, with my resignation taking effect within a few days. This will give you a few days to select a replacement and have them become a ‘resident’ of Habakkuk_2 in time to run in the ‘special election.’ \n\nI consider my time at the Foundation to have been the most fascinating and enlightening experience of my life thus far, and I am deeply grateful to you and the rest of the Site-48 team. Though I know I’ll be amnesticized upon my exit, I hope to remember these years as a happy, wistful mystery; and, though I cannot ask any of you to ‘stay in touch,’ I do hope that you’ll remember me with fondness as well.\n\nAll the best,\nOded\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ **[RECORD PURGED]**\n\n+++++ (Sender: Director Ahe Kahele)\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Good morning!

You need to call it within ten days of my departure, and hold it within three weeks. I know Ahe is going to want some time to find a new person, so just let me know what day you want my resignation to be effective upon.\n> \n> **SPANGLER:** I’ve got a pretty busy week and a half coming up, and I know quorum is all-but-two, so I’m not too worried about needing a third person going into the February 1 meeting. Want to make your resignation effective on Jan 20? \n> \n> **SHIMONI:** Yeah, works. I officially announce my resignation, effective on January 20 at 12:00 PM.
