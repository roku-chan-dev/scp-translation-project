Clutching onto the edges of the paper so severely, she almost tore it in half when the door to her office burst open.\n\nDr. Gerald, a man in his mid-twenties and a bit worse for wear, had panic written all over him -- sweat was rolling down his face like they were the Niagara falls, and his face frozen like the Mt. Rushmore monument.\n\n”And...?” Klein finally spoke up.\n\nTongue-tied, the young researcher shook his head. His eyes were wide.\n\nShe snatched the document that hung loosely between his fingers out of his hand. Gerald became startled for just moment, having forgotten that he was even carrying that piece of paper. Klein’s eyes settled on the paper, like the one before.\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n> **Item:** Casaba-White ”Anti-Matter” Howitzer\n> \n> **Termination Test Record:** Device was aimed at SCP-524.

It reminded her of her younger brother, rest his soul.\n\nShe took a deep breath in. ”It’s time for our last contingency.” Gerald just stood there, wide-eyed. But not those wide eyes of pure terror, but //perplexity//. Klein pressed down a button on her desk.\n\n”Katie,” she said into the microphone.\n\n”Yes, Senior Researcher Klein?” answered her secretary. She had heard her voice a bazillionth times now.\n\n”Contact the Council, and tell them that I request [[[SCP-6871|6871]]] for the ongoing 524 project.”\n\n”Are you sure, Klein?”\n\n”I’m damn sure.“ She ended the call right then and there. Dr. Gerald still stared at her with the same look. He parted his lips to speak, before he decided against it. Before he decided against that.\n\n”W--what’s 6871...?”\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nThis was the last straw. If not this, then nothing. Senior Researcher Autumn Klein sat in a room in Exclusionary Site-01, with several of the O5 heads standing beside her. They oversaw a live video feed of the rabbit, still nibbling at the air.\n\nWhat would soon follow was the completion of a ritual -- one that could erase anything retroactively from existence.

Never again would he let such a nightmarish threat, so merciless and bloodthirsty, destroy his city and terrorize its citizen ever again.\n\nBut today was a different day than over three decades ago. //”You choose your own fate,”// his predecessor, King Nuada Airgetlám VII, had once said to him. He’d be wrong, because Delbáeth never chose to be sucked up by a gigantic maw of death and destruction up in the sky.\n\nHe held onto the railing of his balcony for dear life. He saw helplessly, as his friends were devoured by the giant mouth. A maiden of his grabbed onto the railing just like himself. She had difficulty holding on. She screamed.\n\n”Hold on!” Delbáeth yelled against the howling winds of this once beautiful world. But it was for naught, as the balcony became undone.\n\nSoon, not only he would be consumed, but the city, the planet, and the entire universe.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**| Berlin, Germany |**\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\nMartin Müller wasted away in the sixteenth or so night club for the night. He also chugged down the hundreth or so drink down his throat. His augmented liver could handle it, though, so he didn’t have to worry about any of that.\n\nWhat he did worry about, though, were the screams and howls coming from outside. Even a drunk man, such as himself, knew that there was something seriously wrong going on when someone started screaming from the top of their lungs -- not that it was his obligation to do anything about it.\n\nNot even when the very bricks and concrete of the building started collapsing into a pitch blackness spreading ever-so closer on the ground. When one lived as long as he had, and there were //a lot// of people like Müller, then nothing could surprise one anymore.\n\nStill, in a world where death had died, the end was a welcoming change.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**| Yellowstone National Park, United States of America |**\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\nThe buzzing of the locusts was near inaudible at this point. Cuts and large gashes adorned her arms and legs; no bother. Caroline North trudded on the winding corridors of this underground bunker.\n\nShe stopped at a corner to hold her breath. Each one heavier than the last. She could taste her own blood in her mouth, that iron taste. It was sickening.\n\nThe lights turned on. Whether it was motion sensors or something different, she did not know. The light shone on a control panel. It barely reached any farther than that, a red light blinking steadily. She walked toward it, nearly stumbling over her own two feet.\n\nThis was it. Months of running across the entire globe had led her to this point. The A.I. -- //she cursed herself for having forgotten its name// -- told her that humanity’s fate rested in her hands. That only she could press the button that would save the entire world.\n\nEverything had a sort of cathartic element to it -- like in a dream, where nothing was real, but felt like it. All of her thoughts remained dreams, as a P.A. system spoke of ”reality-anchors failing”, and the entire underground facility folding in on itself.\n\nEven the locusts, with their insatiable hunger, were eaten by the darkness.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**| Site-19, [REDACTED] |**\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n”Order.

After all eyes were set on her did she open her mouth to speak:\n\n”Has any of you found a solution yet?”\n\nThere was more of that silence. Only that it was the wrong kind of silence Autumn Klein wasn’t hoping for.\n\nShe spoke up again: ”Anyone?” Her eyes darted across the table.\n\nAn arm rose in the corner. ”Yes?” she said, somewhat relieved there was at least one to break the silence.\n\n”I’m a replacement for Autumn Klein, Dr. Gerald, and I just wanted to say that my Autumn Klein has holed herself up in her office and is getting drunk.”\n\n”... that’s it?”\n\nDr. Gerald nodded.\n\n”Lord, we’re all gonna die,” said another Klein, who pulled out a whiskey bottle from under her desk.\n\nAutumn Klein stemmed her head in her hands. She rubbed her temples, her eyes for any ideas of how to avert this clusterfuck of a ZK. But there was nothing. No ideas on how to avert the ends of the world. Hopelessness consumed her. The desperation was literally eating her from the inside-out--\n\n//”It needs to eat itself.”//\n\nThe holograms looked concerndly at Autumn Klein. She pressed down a button on the table. ”Katie, order a meeting with the O5-Council! I’ve got an idea on how to stop all this!”\n\nBefore any of the other Autumn Kleins could question what was going on, Autumn Klein barged out through the conference room’s door. The holograms were left in utter silence.\n\n”Even I could’ve come up with that,” one said, as she gulped down a glass of her whiskey.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n> ------\n> [[=]]\n> **PROJECT FUDD**\n> [[/=]]\n> ------\n> **PREFACE:** The SCP-524-PRIME phenomenon functions as a ”reality-sink”, whereby the anomaly’s Hume-level is at a significantly decreased amount than surrounding reality.
