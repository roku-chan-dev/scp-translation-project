Artifacts recovered from SCP-4481 are stored in Site-29's containment facilities as appropriate.\n\nThe remains of SCP-4481-A are currently in cold storage at Site-29. These remains are to be inspected once yearly until such a time that the Foundation deems them not worthy of further study.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4481 refers to a piece of extra-universal wreckage which was discovered off of the coast of Florida in February of 1986. SCP-4481 consists of a craft superficially resembling a NASA space shuttle, including the cockpit, one surviving engine, and the dorsal side of the fuselage; a large part of the ventral side is missing, apparently sheared away in a circular pattern at the molecular level.\n\nSCP-4481 differs from a NASA shuttle in that it has solid black coloration, a much larger cockpit, and the image of the American Flag on the right tailfin bears only forty-one stars.\n\nSCP-4481 contains several items of note, including:\n\n* Packets of dehydrated banana slices that appear to have been made using the largely-extinct Gros Michel cultivar.[[footnote]]Largely rendered extinct due to a fungal blight in the 1950s. The most commonly available variety of banana in the baseline is of the Cavendish cultivar.[[/footnote]]\n* A rhesus macaque, fused to the inside of its cage; speculated to have been a test animal.\n* Several puppets resembling characters from the American children's program //Sesame Street//; most are too waterlogged and damaged to identify, but some characters, such as Kermit the Frog, are recognizable.\n* What appears to be part of a passport for a citizen of the Soviet Union, dated 1985, name illegible. \n\nSCP-4481-A was the sole surviving crew member aboard SCP-4481. SCP-4481-A is a costume resembling the character of \"[[[tales-of-the-automaton-the-big-birdocalypse|Big Bird]]]\" from //Sesame Street//, albeit with several discrepancies.\n\n* The feathers on the costume are white and blue as opposed to solid yellow.\n* The eyes of the costume are heterochromatic, and contain small cameras of unknown use. Prior to 1987, the cameras continuously broadcast a signal that was picked up in Boston, MA.\n* The head of the costume contains advanced motors and hydraulics that are out-of-place for 1986.\n* The costume is styled to be wearing a suit similar in appearance to a contemporary NASA EVA suit. Emblems present on the suit claim to be part of the \"Muppets in Space\" initiative aboard the shuttle \"Excelsior\". A nameplate on the suit reads \"B. BIRD\". \n\nSCP-4481-A was found in the flooded cockpit of SCP-4481, attempting to drown itself. When SCP-4481-A was alive, it was capable of muffled vocalization, most of which were pleas for death; interviews conducted during this time provided no gainful information. SCP-4481-A successfully drowned itself before it could be recovered. \n\nAn autopsy conducted on SCP-4481-A produced the following findings:\n\n* No solid muscular or skeletal structures were present. Several pieces of soft tissue, believed to be organs, were found in a soup of fluid-- mostly blood and sweat --at the lowest point of the thoracic cavity.\n* What is believed to have once been the skull of the individual inside SCP-4481-A was found to have integrated itself into the heart. Cranial and cardiac matter intersected in this manner would have caused severe pain to the subject while they were alive.\n* One .475 bullet, origin unclear. Powder burn found on exterior of costume indicates a recent injury at time of recovery, but no firearm has been discovered near SCP-4481's location of recovery in the intervening years.\n* A ziplock bag containing a crayon drawing on 5x8 writing paper, depicting SCP-4481-A alongside several figures that resemble characters on //[[[SCP-6690|Sesame Street]]]//. SCP-4481-A is dressed in an astronaut's uniform. The drawing is signed \"Johnny, Age 5\".\n\nSix other suits belonging to the crew of SCP-4481 were found in the cockpit alongside SCP-4481-A. These all contained a soup of tissue and organs similar to what was found inside SCP-4481-A. In addition, there is evidence of human tissue being integrated into the structure of these suits; whether or not the crew survived this process in a manner similar to SCP-4481-A is unclear.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4480]]] | SCP-4481 | [[[SCP-4482]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
