In the event that SCP-damej-J starts firing towards Site-19, it is to be spun around so it is once again firing away. Personnel are required to wear level 7A ear protection while communicating with SCP-damej-J, as well as during testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-damej-J is a robotic automaton constructed out of wood and small pieces of twine. On its back is a sticker reader \"tranfomr: robit is desguse, by researcher james age 10[[footnote]]Any connections to the currently AWOL Researcher James who left the Foundation at age 8 after stealing many dangerous SCPs to form the \"kA0s insuRgnc3e\" are currently tenuous at best.[[/footnote]]\".\n\nUnfortunately, despite its significant state of disrepair, SCP-damej-J is still able to function as originally designed; that is, it is able to shoot bullets and talk. Testing has shown that SCP-damej-J hurts to listen to and look at to an unusual degree.\n\n**Interview:**\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**Dr. Bill:** Hello SCP-damej-J.\n\n**SCP-damej-J:** i fir gun.\n\n**Dr. Bill:** Excuse me?\n\n**SCP-damej-J:** i bork so i fir gun heh, heh heh.\n\n**Dr. Bill:** I see.
