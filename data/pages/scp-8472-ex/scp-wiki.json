No further action required.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8472-EX refers to the various body parts comprising the remains of a brown rat (//Rattus norvegicus//). On December 23rd, 2023, the rat entered Site-333's on-site break room and suddenly exploded, covering the break room in a then-unidentified liquid. Footage of the event is provided below.\n\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Site-333 Surveillance Footage:\n{{Employee Break Room}}\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n<BEGIN LOG>\n\n//[Site Director Vincent Bohart enters the break room. Leonora Morales and Noah Patel are present in the room already, eating their lunches. Patel waves as Bohart enters. Bohart does not react.]//\n\n//[Bohart approaches the refrigerator. He rummages through it for a moment before pulling out a container with the name \"CATALANO\" on top. He opens it, grimaces, then shrugs, taking it to the table and sitting down. He begins eating.]//\n\n//[SCP-8472-EX waddles into the room. The gathered personnel do not notice its presence.]//\n\n**Morales:** That's a great ugly sweater, Vincent! It's nice to see you finally getting into the holiday mood.\n\n**Patel:** Yeah! I can't believe you're actually coming to the party and everything!\n\n**Bohart:** Party? And hey, screw you, this sweater is one of the nicest I own.\n\n**Patel:** Wait you-\n\n**Morales:** You seriously forgot about the holiday party? It's literally today. You signed the approval for it and everything!\n\n**Bohart:** How the hell'd you talk me into doing that?\n\n**Morales:** You were blackout drunk at the Halloween party and opportunity presented itself.\n\n**Bohart:** [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7399 With our finances, how the hell'd we even afford it?]\n\n//[Patel hops up and opens the break room pantry.]//\n\n**Patel:** Handled! Everyone pitched in a bit!\n\n**Bohart:** What's on the floor there?\n\n**Patel:** This...? Oh, shit. Something got into the pantry again.\n\n//[Various wrappers, bottles, and crumbs haphazardly cover the floor.]//\n\n**Morales:** Jesus that's a mess and a half, so much for the party. We don't even have drinks!\n\n**Bohart:** You didn't want those anyway, those are the weird diet things Patel was microwaving like a freak earlier.\n\n**Patel:** I like it warm, ok!\n\n**Morales:** It's all chewed through... Vincent, weren't you gonna set traps to deal with the rat issue?\n\n**Bohart:** Uh, yeah. Duh.\n\n//[Bohart motions towards the corner of the room. An unidentified contraption sits in the corner.]//\n\n**Patel:** ...What the hell is that?\n\n**Bohart:** The contraption, for killing rats.\n\n**Patel:** Are those ballistics?!\n\n//[Bohart chuckles]//\n\n**Bohart:** 'Course they are. Learned from this Canadian dude, they're all the rage in Alberta. Apparently that place is rat-free!\n\n//[SCP-8472-EX sniffs at the trap as the personnel talk. It remains unnoticed.]//\n\n**Morales:** That seems needlessly cruel.\n\n**Bohart:** Well boo-hoo. I'm surprised you aren't more on board since the rat ruined your party thing!\n\n**Patel:** Not totally ruined!\n\n//[Patel digs in his bag before producing several sparklers and firecrackers.]//\n\n**Patel:** We still have these things!\n\n**Morales:** Fireworks? Well it isn't food but I suppose they're fun too. Pass me one!\n\n//[Patel hands a firecracker over to Morales, but it slips out of his hand. It rolls towards SCP-8472-EX. SCP-8472-EX squeaks and runs off, darting under the table unnoticed. Patel runs over to the dropped firecracker before it can hit the trap.]//\n\n**Patel:** Whew! That was close!\n\n**Bohart:** If you'd set that off we'd all be going up right now.\n\n//[Site Accountant Tony Catalano enters the break room. He angrily waves around an empty wrapper.]//\n\n**Catalano:** Alright, which of you assholes stole them? Was it you, Morales? I know I saw you eyeing them, and you've got the nastiest breath of us.\n\n//[Morales turns to look behind her.]//\n\n**Catalano:** ...What are you doing?\n\n**Morales:** Trying to figure out who the hell you think you're talking to like that because I //know// it isn't me.\n\n**Catalano:** Oh I'm //definitely// talking to you, you always smell like damn cigarettes and seagulls. What do you even do here?\n\n//[SCP-8472-EX crawls to Patel's bag and begins to nibble at an exposed firecracker.]//\n\n**Patel:** Hold on, we don't really need to-\n\n**Bohart:** Sit down, this is getting good.\n\n**Morales:** //Excuse me?// At least my research is worth a damn. How's that accounting going? Do we still owe the Fire Department 120 grand?\n\n**Patel:** Seriously guys, it's almost Christmas! Shouldn't we all be getting along?\n\n**Catalano and Morales:** Shut up, Patel.\n\n//[SCP-8472-EX appears startled and drops the firecracker, darting back under the table.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Alright, alright. Catalano, what do you think she even stole?\n\n**Catalano:** My mints! The pack of mints I keep on my de-\n\n//[He is interrupted by a loud popping sound as SCP-8472-EX explodes under the table, sending viscera and body parts flying out across the room. Patel, Morales, and Catalano scream. Bohart lifts a leg to see blood and soda covering his pants.]//\n\n**Bohart:** Jesus Christ I JUST bought these!\n\n//[The gathered personnel begin to cough.]//\n\n**Catalano:** What the HELL?\n\n**Patel:** This site is a NIGHTMARE.\n\n<END LOG>\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nResidue left by SCP-8472-EX proceeded to release large volumes of CO2 for several hours. Believing SCP-8472-EX to potentially be a bioweapon created by a hostile GoI, Site-333 was evacuated and SCP-8472-EX was collected by MTF Beta-7 (“Maz Hatters”) for a post-mortem autopsy. Autopsy results revealed SCP-8472-EX's remains to be coated in a generic brand diet cola and shredded remains of a ██████ brand candy mint wrapper.\n\nFollowing the results of this autopsy and review of the footage, SCP-8472-EX was reclassified as explained, and disposed of.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** rats.png\n> **Author:** OriTiefling\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike 3.0\n> **Additional Notes:**\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
