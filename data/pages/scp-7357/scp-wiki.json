Samples removed from the container are not to exceed 100 g. A detailed log must be kept of all SCP-7357 that is produced, complete with accurate records of what has been used to feed it and how much of the sample was subsequently destroyed via incineration.\n\nAll new SCP-7357-A instances are to be incinerated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7357 denotes a mixture most similar to \"friendship cake\" starter; a batter that can be \"fed\", then have portions of it split off to be cooked or shared for as long as people continue to \"feed\" it. While chemical analysis of the batter yields no exact details on its ingredients, the overall makeup remains constant regardless of the ingredients mixed in. Investigations into the extent of this property are ongoing.\n\nSCP-7357-A denotes any cake produced using quantities of SCP-7357 as an ingredient.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=Herman |\ncaption=The delivered SCP-7357-A instance. |\nalign=right |\nwidth=300px\n]]\n**Discovery:** On 14/04/2010, Site-157 received an unmarked package containing the following:\n\n* An SCP-7357-A instance;[[footnote]]Pictured[[/footnote]]\n* A Tupperware container of SCP-7357;\n* A note reading: \"Please Feed Herman\".\n\nShortly after these objects were catalogued, they were transported to a secure locker for temporary storage. Upon arrival, it was found that a slice had been cut from SCP-7357-A. This slice has not been located, and the relevant security footage pertaining to this time period was found to have been misplaced. Investigations are underway to locate the individual responsible.\n\n----\n**Experiment Log 7357-1:**\n\n**Date:** 15/04/2010\n**Subject:** 50 grams of all-purpose flour.\n**Procedure:** Mixed with 50 grams of SCP-7357.\n**Result:** Identical to initial SCP-7357.\n**Note:** 50 grams returned, excess incinerated. - Abbi\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **Video Log 7357-1**\n----\n**Foreword:** The following footage was taken in the Site-157 break room shortly following the submission of Experiment Log 7357-1\n----\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//The feed starts, showing Director Mastus alone in the break room eating lunch at a table.
