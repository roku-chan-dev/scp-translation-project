It should be constantly berated about the dead bodies it leaves on the floor, and the outrageous and loud parties it holds each night. Until it stops inviting those people that whip themselves over, its access to the fridge is denied.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1347-1353-J is a strain of //Yersinia pestis// that is described as \"The worst roommate ever!\" The entity leaves a constant trail of yellow slime wherever it goes, especially when it sits on the couch. Each morning, when SCP-1347-1353-J returns from \"clubbing\" at 4 a.m., it usually leaves a dozen dead bodies on the doorstep. The entity, which goes by \"Yerry\"[[footnote]]Who Drops dem gram negs all over the house during his midnight beatboxing contests.[[/footnote]], prefers to leave its metabolic waste products spread across the floor.\n\nIt is currently not known how SCP-1347-1353-J is able to speak, as he lacks any semblance of vocal cords[[footnote]]Though that doesn't stop him from singing //Don't Stop Believing// at 3 in the morning.[[/footnote]]. It is also not known how SCP-1347-1353-J engages in sexual activities of any kind[[footnote]]Dr. Mike's request for bi-weekly Class-C amnestic administrations is currently pending.[[/footnote]] due to a lack of any sexual organs or cavities. \"Yerry\"[[footnote]]God what a stupid name.[[/footnote]] engages in consumption and excretion like any regular human male during puberty[[footnote]]He eats EVERYTHING. I ordered a whole pizza last Friday for us. He ate the whole thing before I could pay the driver.[[/footnote]].\n\nSCP-1347-1353-J enjoys hosting long, loud, and destructive parties in our apartment, every night. The entity occasionally invites [[[SCP-049|that fucking weird dude with the mask]]] to \"hang out\" and smoke \"[[[SCP-420-J|dat dank shit]]]\", leaving that godawful smell on everything. During their \"hang outs\", \"Yerry\" will reminisce about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death the good old days] while producing a number of dead bodies for reanimation. Said bodies oozed into the carpet of the present apartment, effectively ending any chance of the other renter getting his security deposit back[[footnote]]Dangit Yerry, I was going to use that money to buy a Nintendo Switch.[[/footnote]]. Roommate Mike is currently requesting financial assistance for \"fumigation\" purposes. Reanimated bodies prefer to stand over the location in which the entity's roommate is currently sleeping, until he awakes.\n\nSCP-1347-1353-J is currently involved in a romantic relationship with ████ ██████. ████ ██████ currently displays a number of anomalous effects, including:\n\n* Totally ignoring the inconsiderate messes of her partner.\n* A total disregard for Yerry's roommates while they are sleeping.\n* Spilling blood all over the couch.\n* Moans at the pitch of a clarinet during amorous activities.\n\nSCP-1347-1353-J expresses enjoyment over puns having to do with its past, including:\n* What version of the Black Death would hit an alcoholic? The bourbonic plague\n* What did the plague victim say when his skin turned black? I feel like I've dyed a little inside\n\n**Update 12/20/2016:** On 12/20/2016, roommate Mike found a large number of //Rattus rattus// in the shared living spaces with the entity[[footnote]]YERRY WHY ARE THERE SO MANY RATS![[/footnote]].\n\n**Update 12/21/2016:** On 12/21/2016, roommate Mike received a note covered in yellow slime stating Yerry's intention to spread himself so that others might enjoy his company. Any attempt to carry through with this action should be met with spraying the entity with Streptomycin repeatedly[[footnote]]YEAH TAKE THIS.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Update 12/22/2016:** On 12/22/2016, the entity was noted to be resistant to Streptomycin[[footnote]]FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Addendum 1: Response**\nC'mon Mike, if you can't handle a little black death in your life, how do you expect to face the real world. Don't be a pest. \n-Yerry\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
