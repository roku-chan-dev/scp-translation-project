How the fuck are you going to have Clef and Kondraki kiss but not Midnight Crow??? Neonic is completely disconnected form the community and what we want, they've stopped caring, and so personally I've stopped buying crit crystals from them, only the occasional gear, if they want to get my business back they should hire fans, maybe even our volunteer staff here! they know what's up.\n\n\n\n\n\n++ Fanon\n\nSo, Kain Pathos Crow is a super smart mech pilot for the Foundation. cursed by a witch to be a dog for his hubris after an experiment with the mysterious \"Olympia Project\" exploded in the lab. He must remain in this form untill he learns humility  and reconnects with his son, Kain Pathos Crow Jr. . Midnight is A member of Serpent Clan, a clan of feral warrior cats form what they call the \"Library\". Midnight is their fiercest warrior, and super smart. She gained super-intelligence when her owner Dr. Professorson worked for the GOC, and used her as an experiment by infusing her with demonic intelligence. Unfortunately for unrelated reasons her owner disappeared under mysterious circumstances and everyone forgot about him because of the ancient Deviate magic, except for Midnight since her demon powers make her immune. So she went to the Library and joined the clan because she wanted to find information about her owner Professor Doctorson but unfortunately since she's a cat she can't read. Despite being on different sides, the midnight and crow meet up  for the first time at a pound where they both got trapped due to unrelated circumstances form their enemy the Davea. During this time they started talking and fell in love. Eventually the lovers made their escape by staging a communist revolution against the humans working at the pound. While they each remember their friends fondly, they decided to live in the commune as it's democratically elected leaders for life. And they lived happily ever after\n\n++ Trivia\n\n* This ship is rapidly gaining popularity amongst fans despite it being a rarepair\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#3a3a3a;font-weight:bold;\"]]7 comments[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user sailorenoch]] flandrec0re ¬∑ 10h\n\nWhen the fuck do crow and midnight stage a communist revolution this is stupid like this ship\n----\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user moto42]] adminmartin ¬∑ 10h\n\nYour comment violates the rules against ship hate!
