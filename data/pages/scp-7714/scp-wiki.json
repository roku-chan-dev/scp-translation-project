Metal and wood were present in only the oldest of recovered items, while more recent items were constructed exclusively of bone, cartilage, and a plant-based adhesive.\n\nThe discovered artifacts, as well as the runic inscriptions found in most of the SCP-7714-A-1 instances, have given rise to a theory linking the deceased SCP-7714-A to Viking mythos. Similarly, the likeness of SCP-7714-B depicted by the discovered statuettes is theorized to be of mythic origin.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n= [[span class=\"bt\"]]DRONE RECONNAISSANCE LOG I[[/span]]\n----\n[[div style=\"font-style: italic;\"]]\n\nUAVS ᛝ-2 exits Abyssal Area-7, rapidly approaching SCP-7714-A's Sector B.

It is believed that it is utilizing this ability to detect the high-density low-energy EVE pattern emitted by SCP-7714-A's corpse.\nNevertheless, SCP-7714-B's inability to //accurately// locate SCP-7714-A is likely a result of the disruption of EVE patterns caused by the foreign EVE of the corpses within.\n\nSCP-7714-B is capable of conjuring massive supercell thunderstorms, teletsunamis, and hurricanes of varying stages through poorly understood means, currently believed to be based on the transformation of EVE into thaumaturgy.\n\nSCP-7714-B recently emerged from a dormant state at a location north of Palmer Land, Antarctica, causing multiple Antarctic icequakes, the partial destruction of SCP-7714-A's interior, and an ultra-low-frequency sound that was heard throughout the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.\n\nSCP-7714-C is the provisional designation given to the runic language encountered in SCP-7714-A-1 instances, as well as some on SCP-7714-A's exposed skeleton. Whilst poorly, if at all, understood at the moment, SCP-7714-C has proven to be anomalous. Research into these runes has been delegated to GoI-211.\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ ADDENDUM 7714/5: RECOVERED FILE\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe following file was received by Mikasa Kaori, head of the [[[scp-5514|KEY Project]]], in her SCiPNET email.\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/golem-s-icon-page/Rilevare.png\") no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position: right;\"]]\n+ ##black|HY-B.

The current state of low LSA activity across the world has allowed the redirection of resources into the project with relatively minimal risk. \n\nAs this is the first time SCP-5514 has been deployed against a specific LSA, HY-B TECHNOLOGIES took the liberty of installing several anti-avian modifications designed to counter SCP-7714-B. \nThe added modifications have been listed below. For the full list of SCP-5514's features, refer to its designated file.\n\n||~ Upgrade ||~ Description ||\n||= Cryogenic Missile Battery || A missile launcher system embedded into the left forearm of SCP-5514. The missiles explode on contact, with the additional effect of causing instant freezing to the point of contact. The system houses a maximum capacity of 10 missiles. ||\n||= Gravity Darts || Large darts which vastly increase their weight on contact with a target. Additional weight is gained as a result of the Weight Sink mechanism, temporarily displacing a portion of SCP-5514's weight into the barrel of the dart. ||\n||= Thaumatologically Powered Hamingja-Based Runic Script || Enables the channeling of hamingja from external sources into the pilot of SCP-5514, theoretically bending probability into the pilot's favor via reality bending through high concentrations of EVE. Currently in testing phase. || \n\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ ADDENDUM 7714/7: CONVERSATION TRANSCRIPT\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nFollowing its completion, SCP-5514 was transported to a temporary base located on the east coast of Russia due to SCP-7714-B's theorized connection to SCP-7714-A. \n\nHY-B TECHNOLOGIES director Ramon Wallace, having arrived alongside HY-B TECHNOLOGIES logistics personnel, requested to converse with Mikasa Kaori in person.

Curious to see you face to face like this.\n\n**Wallace:** The feeling is mutual. I wouldn't have seen myself standing here a month prior, trust me. I wanted to see it before it does what it does best.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Right. As you can see, we're running through everything a second time to make sure it's functional when we need it to be.\n\n**Wallace:** It really is an outstanding work of art. I can personally say that I was quite pleased with this opportunity presented to us. The use of anomalies is comprehensive, yet balanced.  \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Judging from the modifications you added, I take it you weren't completely convinced by its arsenal. \n\n**Wallace:** Quite the opposite, actually. I meant what I said. 5514 is designed to counter a large variety of LSA's, but this time we know a bit more about what we're up against. Some specific countermeasures wouldn't hurt. Besides, the project was more invigorating than any others from the last decade. \n\n//Wallace inspects SCP-5514's frame with a somber look.//\n\n**Wallace:** But I didn't come here to reminisce. As you know, our thaumaturges have assisted in the process of integrating the runic patterns you discovered into the hull of SCP-5514.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Yes. The necessary preparations have been made. The human remains in SCP-7714-A have not fluctuated in EVE levels, so they should be a reliable source of hamingja to pull from. The option of pulling it from the attending personnel also exists, and-\n\n**Wallace:** About that, considering our lack of proper understanding of the channeling process, it could pose a significant risk. We currently believe that the excessive transfer of hamingja can prove too much for a person, whether it's given or received. The lack of inherent power in a simple human restricts how much EVE we can hold, which is likely a part of why the LSA's have so much of it compared to us. The nature of their being simply demands they hold more of it.\n\nIf there is believing your research personnel, and by extension the Vikings, luck is just another part of something that could be a soul. While a soul, at least in the way that we understand it, isn't required for the emission of EVE, the three concepts are most likely interconnected. I don't think it's a coincidence that hamingja is said to be transferred forward naturally upon death. Unfortunately, our understanding of it is just as limited as our understanding of EVE itself. \n \n**Dr. Kaori:** So if a being like a Large Scale Aggressor were to lose its hamingja, that would prove fatal to it, in the same way, accumulating too much hamingja would prove fatal to a human?\n\n**Wallace:** Not would, could. And before you bring it up, no, we cannot weaponize the channeling of hamingja through any known means. The tests we have had time to run indicate the process has to be voluntary or at least aided by an already existing connection between the souls through which hamingja is channeled. According to Norse mythology, that would be a family bond. \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** That's a shame. But this raises an issue.\n\n//Wallace gives Dr. Kaori a questioning look.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** If what you're saying is true, the pilot of SCP-5514 isn't going to be able to handle that much EVE. The levels of EVE we can potentially pull from SCP-7714-A is about five times the amount of the average LSA. It's not going to work.\n\n//Wallace turns towards SCP-5514 again and prompts Dr. Kaori to look up at it. Dr. Kaori does so.//\n\n**Wallace:** SCP-5514 itself lacks a soul, so transferring hamingja straight to it isn't a choice we have, but as we know, the runes themselves can hold hamingja, at least for some time. The soul still has to be a part of the equation, which is why the soul of your pilot will serve as a sort of conductor through which hamingja is pulled to SCP-5514's use. It's less effective, but the risks are minimized. \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** This still doesn't sound safe. Are you sure of this?\n\n**Wallace:** No, but it is an option when push comes to shove.\n\n//Both stare at each other without saying a word. A loud humming noise from SCP-5514's power source breaks their gazes.//\n\n**Wallace:** It has been a pleasure, but I better get going. Good luck.\n\n//Wallace turns to leave but is interrupted by Dr. Kaori.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Is this really why you bothered to come all the way here? To tell me something one of your operatives could have told me by email?\n\n//Wallace is still standing silently, his back turned to Dr. Kaori. After a brief moment he sighs.//\n\n**Wallace:** I think my answer would be more appropriate to give after the moment of peril has passed.  \n \n[[/div]]\n\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ ADDENDUM 7714/8: SCP-7714-B ENCOUNTER\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nAbyssal Area-7 was ordered on full alert due to SCP-7714-B changing its course directly towards SCP-7714-A's location. SCP-5514 has been instructed to remain immobile until SCP-7714-B comes within distance. The encounter has been recorded below.\n\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//SCP-7714-B circles the area, ignoring all Foundation personnel and gear.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Alright, whenever you're ready.\n\n//SCP-5514 lifts its arm up. The Cryogenic Missile Battery springs out of its forearm, launching two missiles towards SCP-7714-B. Both connect, hitting it in the side.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** Cold enough?\n\n//SCP-7714-B recovers with little injuries, now directing its attention towards SCP-5514.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** Guess not. \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** It's coming in fast! \n\n//SCP-5514 unsheathes the Cold Iron Sword but gets knocked on its back, SCP-7714-B ramming into it with all 4 of its limbs. It then begins to bludgeon SCP-5514 with its beak repeatedly. SCP-5514 slashes towards SCP-7714-B with the Holdout Plasma Wristblade. SCP-7714-B manages to partially avoid the blow but suffers a wound to the side of its neck. It screeches before jumping off and taking flight again.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** Damn. Kaori, you see it?\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** It's circling around us midflight. Currently at seven o'clock.\n\n**Thousand Word Arrows:** Glory to the Dragonslayer!

SCP-7714-B launches a bolt of electricity that connects with the projectile, detonating it mid-air. SCP-5514 takes flight, moving towards SCP-7714-B at rapid speed.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** Alright big guy. Let's see you fly after this. \n\n//SCP-5514 swings the Cold Iron Sword at SCP-7714-B, but the latter avoids the blow. SCP-5514 is then pushed back a significant distance by a whirlwind from SCP-7714-B's flapping wings.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** This isn't working. We're at a disadvantage in the air. We need to ground it, now!\n\n**Captain Rosales:** Roger. Let's see what the new spices can do in practice.\n\n//SCP-5514 lands in the shallow water, and launches a Gravity Dart at SCP-7714-B. It connects, hitting it in its right forelimb. SCP-7714-B is forced to land approximately 200 meters away. The two combatants throw themselves at each other. SCP-5514 blocks a slash from SCP-7714-B's talons with the Cold Iron Sword before pushing it away with the side of the blade. SCP-7714-B staggers, becoming unable to avoid the second shot by the Beowulf-Sigurd Rail. The shot connects, causing it to roar in pain and jump back.//  \n\n**Captain Rosales:** Here we go!\n\n//SCP-5514 throws the Rounded Recoiling Plasma at SCP-7714-B, severing its left forelimb. SCP-5514 then closes the distance between the two and brings the Cold Iron Sword above its head to finish off the crippled LSA. However, 5514 is forced to step back and drop the massive weapon as SCP-7714-B unleashes an extremely loud supersonic screech which damages the nearby constructs and incapacitates many of the personnel nearby.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Ahhhh... Rosales? Are you ok?!\n\n**Captain Rosales:** What?! Repeat!\n\n//SCP-7714-B tears the Gravity Dart off and takes flight. The severed limb is already beginning to regenerate. The intensity of the storm enveloping the area seems to increase.//\n\n**Anderson:** Hello? Am I getting through? \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Who is this? \n\n**Anderson:** This is Anderson of HY-B Technologies informing you that the Runic System is ready to go should you need to use it. We should be able to pull it off despite the injuries to most of the thaumathurgists present. \n\n//Visibility in the area around SCP-5514 becomes low due to the raging storm. The wind picks up even more, making it hard for SCP-5514 to move effectively. SCP-7714-B emerges from the storm, taking the war machine by surprise. SCP-5514 is struck with a direct blow from the LSA's talons, launching it into the air. SCP-5514 crashes heavily onto the beach.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Systems report damage to the hull integrity.  \n\n**Captain Rosales:** The left arm isn't responding to my commands. Damn it! Fine, let's see what these runes can do.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** You're sure about this? \n\n**Captain Rosales:** Wouldn't be the only chance I've taken today.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Anderson?\n\n**Anderson:** Beginning the channeling process.  \n\n//The on-site thaumathurgists of both the SCP Foundation and HY-B Technologies begin chanting in ancient Norse. A message from Abyssal Area-7 is received, confirming that the EVE levels in SCP-7714-A have begun to drop rapidly.

How are you feeling?\n\n//Captain Rosales answers with a reassuring nod, although it is clear he is having trouble staying conscious. SCP-7714-B releases another screech from within the storm.//\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Aaaaargh!! Percy, hang on just a little more. I think they're almost done.

Let's see if you're feelin' lucky.\n\n//Captain Rosales closes his eyes, releasing SCP-5514 from his control. A brief moment passes before he takes control again, making the Cryogenic Missile Battery rise from the machine's forearm. SCP-5514 haphazardly turns around to meet the gaze of SCP-7714-B who is gliding towards it a mere 50 meters away. The remaining missiles are launched at it, dealing tremendous damage to the area around its head and neck. The beast's frame grazes SCP-5514, the momentum carrying it into the storm. A loud crash and the sound of swelling water are heard, followed by silence.// \n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Is it dead?\n\n**Captain Rosales:** I'm not sure. The storm seems to be calming down at least. Anderson, are you picking up anything there?\n\n**Anderson:** No. We'll keep monitoring the storm. Stay on guard.\n\n//Sounds of crumbling ice emanates from the dark fog, followed by a low, guttural growl. SCP-7714-B spreads its wings, dispersing some of the dark clouds around it. It has sustained severe injuries in the area of its neck and upper torso. Regeneration is taking place, though at a slightly slower rate due to the ice covering most of the wounded areas.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** We can't afford to drag this on any longer! It'll be back in the air soon, and outlast us in this storm. I didn't think it would come down to this again, but we're gonna have to blast it with all we got.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** No! The hull has sustained too much damage. If we use the Sun Vent now, we risk incinerating ourselves. We're not taking any more chances, runes or not.\n\n**Captain Rosales:** We have to! Now's our best chance of taking it down before we're at a disadvantage again. Please understand. Wait... you seeing this?\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Hm? There's... a Gravity Dart stuck in its wing. But we didn't launch a second dart.\n\n**Captain Rosales:** It must've stuck to it when it bumped into us just now. Alright, I have an idea. But if this doesn't work, I'm blasting that thing into outer space.\n\n**Dr. Kaori:** Right, do what you have to.\n\n//SCP-7714-B becomes airborne, making effort to gain altitude. It begins to crackle with lightning, bolts of electricity engulfing the air around it. It then swoops down at tremendous speed towards SCP-5514, sounding a rage-filled cry.//\n\n**Captain Rosales:** On my mark. \n\n//SCP-5514 tightens its grip on the Cold Iron Sword. SCP-7714-B reaches low altitude and charges directly towards SCP-5514, the oncoming impact mere seconds away.// \n\n**Captain Rosales:** Now! \n\n//Dr. Kaori activates the Gravity Dart, causing SCP-7714-B to lose its balance in flight. SCP-5514 evades the LSA by swiftly stepping aside while simultaneously turning around its entire frame, unleashing a slash of the Cold Iron Blade. The blade sinks deep into the LSA's neck, making its way to its back, almost slicing it in half. SCP-7714-B hits the ground, the ongoing speed causing it to tumble several hundred meters in the shallow water before coming to a stop. The storm clouds begin to disperse.//\n\n//SCP-5514 spends a few minutes monitoring the LSA from a distance before finally letting the weapon stained with the creature's blood fall onto the coastline. The runic patterns on SCP-5514's frame flicker before the light dies, and on-site personnel confirm SCP-5514's EVE levels have returned to normal.//\n\n[[/div]]\n----\n= **[END LOG]**\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ ADDENDUM 7714/9: COMMUNICATIONS WITH GOI-211\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe following message from HY-B TECHNOLOGIES director Ramon Wallace was received by Dr. Mikasa Kaori.

I wish I was there to see it myself, the report delivered to my office was expectedly underwhelming.\n\nI'm sure you are aware of the problems HY-B TECHNOLOGIES is struggling with at the moment, but the reality is far harsher for us than you may believe. Reconstructing the //Crocoteuthis gigantis// was indeed our last investment into science under the name of Prometheus Labs Inc.\n\nDuring its years, Prometheus Labs has not always been the most morally bright company. I lead the organization with the mindset of being able to achieve the most if we were to think of limits as artificial constructs. The wake of destruction LSA-Brasil-01 left behind changed my view as quickly as I once adopted it. We had nothing left except for an opportunity to do something different this time. We obviously didn't want to take it down for the sake of our business if there was no future for the organization. But we had a past, one I couldn't be entirely proud of. But there was a chance for our present to be something more than that. We used the last we had for this one last endeavor.\n\nRegrettable miscalculations, unfortunate fluctuations in demand for anomalous weaponry, or the arrogance of resurrecting an enormous LSA, it doesn't matter now. Our time has come.\n\nRegarding your offer to Anderson: Vincent was quite flattered but was steadfast in carrying down his own path. I have faith in him making [[[anderson-robotics-hub|a name for himself]]], I just hope it's something we both can be pleased about.\n\nYou have your answers now.
