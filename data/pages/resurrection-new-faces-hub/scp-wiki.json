Chosen to head a new Mobile Task Force made up (at least partially) by anomalous individuals by the powers that be, Director Light has a lot of pressure on her.  As we have seen so far, the recruitment and assembling of a team has gone slowly.  But Director Light has always felt that a singular team was the biggest flaw in the legacy of Omega-7, and she is insistent that in order for the MTF Alpha-9 (\"Last Hope\") to be effective more than one team would need to be ready to deal with emergencies.  It is in this scenario our story opens: Director Light is looking to recruit new members to her provisional MTF.\n\nAt the same time, an anomaly beneath a Site in Yellowstone has begun to wake up.   This object is left over from a previous Restructuring Event at the hands of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/incident-zero-part-5 | SCP-076]]] and reality hasn't ever truly healed from that incident.  \n[[=]]\nAnd //someone// has to deal with it...\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 5px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; background:#EEEEEE    ; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/yellowstoneC width=\"400px\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n+++ __Intro__\n[[=]]\n//In which the world's rules are set in stone.//\n[[/=]]\n\n**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/new-faces-overture | New Faces: Overture]]]**\nby [[user redredred]]\n//Part of that was true, but Anne didn’t know what.
