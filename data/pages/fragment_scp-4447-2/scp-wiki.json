Foundation facilities in East Asia have been alerted and are working through government channels to locate SCP-4447.## ##gray|Undercover agents assigned into Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. have been informed of SCP-4447, and are to continue to monitor the group## ##mediumblue|and seek information on SCP-4447's whereabouts##.\n\n##mediumblue|If SCP-4447 is found and can be reasonably accessed, personnel are to approach them without their awareness and sedate/detain them.##\n\n**Description:** ##mediumblue|SCP-4447 is Sarah Turner, a 27-year-old U.S. citizen of Chinese and British descent. They possess an anomalous trait## ##gray|that enables instant teleportation between any two people on Earth. When the anomaly is activated, the individuals, including their clothing, attached equipment, and jewelry, immediately switch positions.##\n\n##mediumblue|SCP-4447 was last seen in their Los Angeles apartment by Foundation agents before being replaced with a confused Chinese national. It is believed that SCP-4447 utilized its anomalous properties to escape.##\n\n##gray|The only known medium that## ##mediumblue|previously offered## ##gray|exchange events## ##mediumblue|was## ##gray|a website describing the service, designated SCP-4447-1. Pictures of both individuals must be uploaded, and following payment of 10,000 USD, a time 8-12 hours in the future will be displayed. Within ±3 minutes of the given time, both individuals will undergo the SCP-4447 event and swap locations.##\n\n**Discovery:** ##gray|Agents tracking GoI \"Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\" reported rumors of a new instant-travel service. After some investigation, the URL \"{{████████████████.onion}}\" was discovered, and Foundation technical staff began analyzing the website.## ##mediumblue|It was found that the hidden service was configured to use an obsolete cryptographic suite, enabling some traffic to be intercepted and decrypted. A traffic-analysis attack was successfully executed utilizing compromised Tor nodes, and SCP-4447's apartment was located. SCP-4447's laptop was recovered, but had no useful information as it had been remotely wiped a few minutes after their escape.##\n\n**Experiment Log:** ##darkgreen|No changes detected. Section collapsed.##\n\n##mediumblue|**Addendum 4447-1:** Recovery of SCP-████ files##\n\n##mediumblue|Site Director Chen approved a raid on a Marshall, Carter, and Dark warehouse located in [REDACTED] to recover files and information pertinent to the theft of SCP-████ from Site-19. Recovered memoranda made off-hand references to SCP-4447, which suggested that the transportation service was still active. Further inquiry into the matter is ongoing.##\n\n[[div class=\"yellow left-right\"]]\n[[div]]\n[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4447 ⟵ Previous revision]\n[[/div]]\n[[div]]\n[http://scp-wiki.net/scp-4447/offset/2 Next revision ⟶]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
