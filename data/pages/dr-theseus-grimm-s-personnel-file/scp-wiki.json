Dr. Grimm was then placed under surveillance for 29 hours in a holding cell before being employed at the Foundation.\n\nDr. Grimm has the anomalous ability to psychically use the fear of being watched or having your secrets revealed to affect people around him. Dr. Grimm's can range from the fear itself, forcing someone to feel as though they are being watched, and the ability to know about others from a certain distance.
