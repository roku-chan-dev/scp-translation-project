Should the SCPF Thalassa sustain damage requiring it to leave its patrol, another Foundation vessel of similar size is to be sent in its place immediately.  All personnel onboard the SCPF Thalassa are to not look in the direction of SCP-6617 or SCP-6617-1 under any circumstances.  Personnel acting strangely or expressing the desire to rescue SCP-6617-1 must be restrained and taken at least three kilometers away from SCP-6617.  All supplies for Research Outpost 6617 must be delivered by air.  Radio contact with Research Outpost 6617 should be maintained at all times.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6617 is an island one kilometer in length located in the Atlantic Ocean.  This island is not recorded on civilian maps or in any other records.  If any living subject enters within 50 meters of SCP-6617, they physically cannot be taken away from it.  Attempts to airlift or tow subjects away from it always end in failure, and attempts to swim or fly away from SCP-6617 always end in the subject ending up back where they started.  No food or water sources have been found on \nSCP-6617, although evidence of human habitation lasting at least a month has been found on the northern tip. \n\n SCP-6617-1 is a humanoid female of Mediterranean descent with the anomalous property of influencing humans who directly view it to approach it.  Humans who have seen SCP-6617-1 will express a strong desire to rescue it, even though SCP-6617-1 is not in any physical danger.  SCP-6617-1 is affected by SCP-6617's properties, and cannot leave SCP-6617.  Combined with its properties, this means that viewing SCP-6617-1 will usually result in becoming trapped on SCP-6617.  SCP-6617-1 does not age, and it does not require food or water.  SCP-6617-1 is affected by environmental hazards such as sunburn but cannot be killed by said environmental hazards.  SCP-6617-1 stays inside Research Outpost 6617 for its own safety and comfort, but it has expressed on multiple occasions the desire to keep others safe by staying out of sight.  Those already on SCP-6617 cannot be affected by viewing SCP-6617-1.\n\n\n**SCP-6617 Discovery:** After reports of a small yacht going missing and sending out a radio message describing a woman on an island, a team of eight Foundation agents were sent to the yacht's last known location.  Upon viewing SCP-6617-1, the team changed course for SCP-6617, running aground approximately 60 meters away from it.  The agents immediately swam the rest of the way to SCP-6617 and became trapped by its effects.  The following radio transcripts detail the efforts designed to rescue the trapped agents and the establishment of Research Outpost 6617.  \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Radio Log 1\" hide=\"- Close Radio Log 1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:  This log was recorded five hours after the last message sent by the agents, after radio contact was established between them and the SCPF Pontus**\n**Transcript:**\n**Agent Lang:**  Oh God, someone's here!  Please, get us off this fucking island already!\n\n**Researcher Fox (onboard the SCPF Pontus):** We're going to try.  We're sending you guys a raft right now, you'll be out of there in no time.\n\n**Agent Peters:**  Thank you!  But what the hell happened to us?  We saw this weird lady and then Roberts steered us into the ground.  Nobody knows why, Roberts isn't telling.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  I can't help you guys with that.  But cheer up, the raft's coming right now!\n\n//A raft large enough to carry all eight agents to the SCPF Pontus was lowered into SCP-6617's area of influence, and carried to the water by the agents.//\n\n**Agent Pierre:**  Let's get out of here.  I have a date to get to.\n\n//After boarding the raft and leaving SCP-6617's shore, the agents began moving towards the SCPF Pontus.  Approximately 40 meters away from SCP-6617, the raft broke apart and began sinking.  The agents began swimming towards the SCPF Pontus, but appeared back on the shore before exiting SCP-6617's area of influence.//\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Well, that didn't work.  I'll get working with my team on another way to get you guys out.  Don't give up hope.\n\n**Agent Pierre:** Tell my girlfriend that I love her.  Also, probably tell someone at Site-11 to buy her flowers, it's not going to be pretty when she realizes I'm trapped on an island.\n\n**Researcher Fox (laughing):** Will do, Agent Pierre.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Radio Log 2\" hide=\"- Close Radio Log 2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:  This log was recorded one day after the failed rescue effort, between the agents and the SCPF Pontus.**\n**Transcript**\n**Researcher Fox:**  Hey, is anyone there?  We're going to try and get you out today.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:**  I think they're sleeping.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Who are you?\n\n**SCP-6617-1 (laughing):**  I ask myself that same question sometimes.  To answer your question, I'm that girl that these poor fools saw.  \n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Could you wake the agents up?  I need to talk to them.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:**  Of course.\n\n//SCP-6617-1 shouts \"Wake up\", waking all eight agents.  It then runs to the far side of SCP-XXXX and out of sight.//\n\n**Agent Lang:**  What the fuck!  Rachel, was that you? \n\n**Agent Pierre (confused):** Uh, no.  That wasn't me.  \n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Don't look at me.  All I heard was a voice.\n\n**Agent Peters:**  Probably that weird girl.  I wouldn't put it past the strange island anomaly to do that.\n\n**Agent Ash:**  Well, Lila, do you have anything new for us?\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Yes, I do, Vera.  We're going to try to airlift you guys out today.  If that doesn't work, then we're out of options, really.  So let's hope that this works.  \n\n**Agent Lang:**  Finally!  I've been getting a little tired of rocks and shit!\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Could you tone down the profanity, Jacob?  I have to put this in a report.\n\n**Agent Pierre:**  Seriously.  When I go home, I don't want to get in trouble for messing with a report.  So stop it, Jacob.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  While we're waiting for the helicopter, do you have any information about this island at all?\n\n**Agent Acker:**  I'm sorry, we have nothing.  I'm no researcher.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  That's okay, Markus.  It just makes my job easier to have more info.  Now, everyone stand clear, the helicopter's coming now.\n\n//A helicopter dangling a rope ladder hovers outside SCP-6617's area of influence, moving as close as it can without entering.  As the first agent starts climbing, the pilot notices the rope beginning to fray.  As the agent reaches three meters above the ground, the rope snaps, causing the ladder and agent to fall.//\n\n**Agent Lang:**  What the actual hell!  Lila, what was that!  Is this the island or do you guys keep sending us faulty rescue equipment!\n\n**Agent Pierre:**  Wasn't that girl saying something about rafts breaking?  That a few people tried to make a raft out of wood and it broke?\n\n**Agent Lang:**  I just assumed those guys were shitty at making rafts.  You don't see hoofprints and immediately assume zebras, Rachel.\n\n**Agent Pierre:**  We have worked for the SCP Foundation for way too long to count out the wilder option, Jacob.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  I'm so sorry.  Do you have any ideas on how to get you all out?\n\n**Agent Acker:**  Well, if we can't leave, shouldn't we set up some kind of base for research and things? \n I mean, keep working on getting us out, but set something up.  Plus, the sun's getting really annoying and I want some shelter.\n\n**Researcher Fox:**  Actually, that idea isn't half bad.  Our team here could watch over you guys, and we'll be able to learn more about this anomaly.  In the meantime, we'll send in the materials to build something.  Best of luck to you all.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAfter these radio logs, Research Outpost 6617 was constructed on the southern side of SCP-6617.  Agents Pierre, Lang, Peters, Roberts, Acker, Ash, Fargo, and Porter are the only staff present.  They are overseen by researchers aboard the SCPF Thalassa, after the SCPF Pontus was required elsewhere.  \n\n**Addendum 6617a:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Interview Log\" hide=\"- Close Interview Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6617-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Christine Walker\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-6617-1 was interviewed over radio on 7/24/2019 to gather more information on the origins of itself and SCP-6617\n\n**<Begin Log, 10:00 AM, 7/24/2019>**\n\n**Dr. Walker:** Hello, SCP-6617-1.  I am Dr. Walker, and I'm going to ask you some questions.  You are going to answer them to the best of your ability.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Alright.  Although, if I may ask, why are you calling me that?  I mean, it's fine, I've been called worse, but I want to know.\n\n**Dr. Walker:** It's just procedure.  Now, do you know anything about how you got here, or anything before that?\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** No, not really.  I sort of just, started existing here one day.  I've never been anywhere else, I don't think.   \n\n**Dr. Walker:** Please elaborate on your answer, SCP-6617-1\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I told you, I don't know.  I've been here for all my life.  I don't know how long, I don't know why.  It's kind of hard to count days when you lost count around a thousand years ago.\n\n**Dr. Walker:** Do you know exactly how your effects work?  We have been studying them for as long as we've been here, and we need more information to finish up the report.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Finally, you ask me something I can answer.  If someone sees me, they come here.  They swim, they jump overboard, a few times people stole lifeboats.  And then, of course, there's the people who crash entire ships to come here.  That never goes well.  Sometimes, if I throw hard enough, I can throw items out of the island's area.  Only small things, though.  Like bottles.  Not humans.\n\n**Dr. Walker:**  Thank you, SCP-6617-1.  We found evidence of human habitation here, can you explain that?\n\n**SCP-6617-1:**  That must have been a hundred or so years ago.  A ship wrecked here, maybe two lifeboats full of people got ashore.  They used the boats as shelter, and they had supplies to last them about a month.  It rained once, and the water from that kept them alive.  But, eventually, they ran out of water.  They didn't make it past two months.  I used one of the boats as shelter until it got too worn to use.  Took their clothes as well, but those didn't last either.  \n\n**Dr. Walker:**  Thank you.  That will be all for today.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** When you send supplies for everyone, could you send me a sunhat?  The sunburn on my face is getting unbearable.  Thank you.\n\n**Dr. Walker:** I'll see what I can do, SCP-6617-1.  Goodbye.  \n\n**<End Log, 10:30 AM, 7/24/2019>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** After this interview, a sunhat and several bottles of sunscreen were sent in the next supply shipment.  \n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Addendum 6617b: Therapy Logs**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Therapy Log 1\" hide=\"- Close Therapy Log 1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6617-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Serena Thomas\n\n**Foreword:** A Foundation therapist, Dr. Serena Thomas, was assigned to the SCPF Thalassa for the mental health of everyone onboard, as well as on SCP-6617.  The following is a transcript of a therapy session between Dr. Thomas and SCP-6617-1, conducted over radio.  \n\n**<Begin Log, 12:00 PM, 8/01/2019>**\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Hi, SCP-6617-1, I'm Serena.  I'm here to check in on you, make sure you're okay and all.  I'd go to you, but I kind of want to go home for holidays and all.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Check in on me?  That's sweet and all, but there are way more people on this island who need help more than me.  Rachel's been crying all day, says she missed someone's birthday.  I'm used to all this, they're not.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I'm meeting with her later today.  This is your time, not anyone else's.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Really?  Okay then.  I suppose being alone all this time did something to me.  I can't put my finger on what exactly it is, though.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Well, we all feel like that sometimes.  It's okay to not know what you feel about things.\n\n**SCP-6617-1 (laughing):** Well, I doubt you ever felt as alone as me.  I think I could definitely qualify for the loneliest person in the world.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I remember when I called myself the loneliest girl in the world in school.  Oh, how wrong I was.  So, yeah, I think you could call yourself that.  Not anymore, though.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I'd be less mad if this island had a forest and river and everything else.  But, no, I live on a barren stretch of rock.  Nobody would want to be here, I'm sure of that\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Why do you always stay in the research outpost?  I'm kind of curious as to why you stopped going out.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** You think I want people seeing me?  Listen, I never wanted anything I have, and luring people to their deaths isn't anything to be proud of.  Even now, where nobody'll die anymore, do you think I want someone's life to be ruined?  Rachel can't ever see her girlfriend, Markus has friends somewhere that he can never meet again, and Jamie has two kids he won't ever see again.  All my fault.  Do your jobs and keep people away, I'll do my job and stay out of sight.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I wish I could hug you or something.  And no, this isn't because of your effect.  This is why they put me here.  I'm too soft.  I'm sorry.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** What do you have to be sorry for?  You've done nothing wrong.  I'm the one who should apologize.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I'm sorry, but I have to meet with Agent Pierre now.  Talk again soon, okay?\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Perfect.  I'll be here, as always.\n\n**Dr. Thomas (laughing):** Goodbye, SCP-6617-1.\n\n\n**<End Log, 12:30 PM, 8/01/2019>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** SCP-6617-1 remained in Research Outpost 6617 for two weeks, only leaving when accompanied by Agent Pierre.  \n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Therapy Log 2\" hide=\"- Close Therapy Log 2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6617-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Serena Thomas.\n\n**Foreword:**  The following is a transcript of a therapy session between Dr. Serena Thomas and SCP-6617-1, conducted over radio.  Dr. Thomas was permitted to give SCP-6617-1 a name, provided that it is only used between the two.  \n\n**<Begin Log, 12:00 PM, 9/01/19>**\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Hi, SCP-6617-1.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Oh, hello, Serena.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** These aren't really formal logs, so to speak, so I got permission to give you an actual name.  Keep in mind, we're the only two allowed to use it, though.  Do you have any ideas on what you'd want to be called?  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Wait, they're letting me choose?  I guess something to do with the ocean might be fitting.  Marina, perhaps?\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Marina?  That's a nice name.  Anyway, Marina, I wanted to ask you how you're doing.  For being stuck on an island for thousands of years, you seem to hold up pretty well.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I remember, whenever I was alone, I'd try to count every star I saw in the sky.  I didn't know the constellations, so I named them myself.  Of course, Rachel told me all of them.  I called the Little Dipper the Eel for about a thousand years.  That's how I held up.  I gave myself a task I knew nobody would be able to finish. \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** That's at least a little cooler than what I do when I'm alone, at least.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Come on!  It can't be any weirder than what I do.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I used to draw.  I had like, no friends, so I got really good at it.  What did I draw, you may ask?  Weird monster things.  To this day, I wonder if I drew an SCP before I even knew what an SCP was.  I drew an eyeball with legs once, and someone found it at school.  If I'd been unpopular before, I sure was after that.  Anyway, your constellation thing is better and I'd like to hear what you named the rest of them.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I have a drawing of all of them, I wonder if I could put it in something waterproof and throw it for someone to collect?  It's not out of the question.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I'll see what I can do. You're undoubtedly one of the best people I've talked to here, that's for sure.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Why?  That ship you're on, it's decent sized.  There's got to be someone cooler than me on there.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Well, let's just say, when you're as stressed as a containment specialist, you tend to take it out on the most useless member of the team.  And would you look at that, I'm the most useless member on the team.  But I talk too much.  Back to you.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** They shouldn't.  I don't think you're useless.  And I doubt Rachel think you're useless either.  I should send a letter from her with my constellation chart.  I think her girlfriend would like that.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** You should.  I have another session to get to, so we'll talk later.  I wish we could talk more than once a month, though.  Bye, Marina.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Goodbye, Serena.  \n\n**<End Log, 12:30, 9/01/19>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Several days after this session, a waterproof capsule containing five letters and a drawing was thrown from SCP-6617's area of influence and recovered.  The letters were from the agents at Research Outpost 6617, and were sent to their respective recipients, all Foundation personnel.  The drawing was of various constellations, each labeled differently than their actual names.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Therapy Log 3\" hide=\"- Close Therapy Log 3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6617-1\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Serena Thomas\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a transcript of a therapy session between Dr. Serena Thomas and SCP-6617-1, conducted over radio. \n\n**<Begin Log, 12:00 PM, 10/01/19>**\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Hi, Marina!  I'm honestly kind of relieved I get to talk to you.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Same to you, Serena.  Looking at the sky gets a bit boring after a while.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Well, I'm not the only person here.  The agents aren't going anywhere.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** They're still doing research of some sort, although I really don't know what more there is to know about this place.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Well, best not to interrupt.  I suppose talking to you is one of the highlights of my month. \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I agree.  With the talking to you thing, of course. \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** At least it's better out here than where I was before.  So many more people to counsel there, and an ocean view is much better than concrete.  \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** Agreed.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Marina?  Do you know about Sirens?\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** No.  I'd like to hear about them, though.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** They're from Greek mythology.  Half woman, half bird, and they lure sailors to their deaths with their singing.\n\n**SCP-6617-1 (laughing):** Sounds a bit like me.  I wish I could sing, though.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** That makes two of us.  You're sort of a Siren, but you don't want to lure people to their deaths.  It's strange but I tie everything to myths because I'm a nerd.  I think I annoyed a lot of people doing that.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I don't mind it.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I wouldn't expect anything less from you.  Also, I'm excited to report that after three months of knowing you, that you are still one of the coolest people I've talked to.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** You too.  And I've been around for thousands of years.  Well, most of the people I've talked to have either thought I was some kind of island witch, so there's that.  I guess I sort of am.  But it's less magic, what I have, and more of a curse.  \n\n**Dr. Thomas:** Thank you.  And you're no island witch.  I've also got some good news, I think I might stay permanently here.  Whether that's good or bad, I can't tell. \n\n**SCP-6617-1:** After seeing so many ships sink, I honestly can't understand anyone who chooses to spend more time than necessary in one.  But to each their own.\n\n**Dr. Thomas:** I hate cutting our time short, and I hate that I can't talk to you until next month.  But there are five people I need to see.  Take care, Marina.\n\n**SCP-6617-1:** I hate it too.  Talk next month, I guess.\n\n**<End Log, 12:30, 10/01/19>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Two days after this session, Dr. Serena Thomas put in a request to be permanently transferred to SCPF Thalassa duty.  This request was accepted.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6616]]] | SCP-6617 | [[[SCP-6618]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
