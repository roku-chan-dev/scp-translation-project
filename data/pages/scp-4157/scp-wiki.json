Phone number has been expunged to avoid further incidents.\n]]\n**Item #:** SCP-4157\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Any instances of SCP-4157-1 found in the public are to be confiscated and disposed of via incineration. If a civilian contacts the number listed on SCP-4157-1, all individual(s) are to be removed from the caller's place of residence under a feasible cover story based on the location of the incident. This is to occur until the SCP-4157-2 instance following the call manifests. Once the instance of SCP-4157-2 manifests, the agents are to dispatch and/or collect the SCP-4157-2 instance. \n\nThe body of the SCP-4157-2 instance is then to be disposed of along with any other objects found within its originating box. Individuals affected or injured by an SCP-4157-2 instance are to be treated and given Class-A Amnestics, with damaged property being replaced if possible. Current investigations into GOI-4998 are underway, although tracking of the number on SCP-4157-1 yields no results to viable locations for GOI-4998.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4157 is the instantaneous creation and placement of paper flyers with the phrase \"WANT DOG GET FREE DOG HERE [sic] (███)-███-████\" printed onto them, hereafter referred to as SCP-4157-1. SCP-4157 events have only been shown to occur in North America, with SCP-4157-1 instances only appearing in areas and at times where no video surveillance and/or human viewing is currently present. Individuals contacting the number listed on SCP-4157-1 will be answered by the voice of an unidentified male speaking in broken English, hereafter referred as POI-4998. POI-4988 will proceed to ask the caller a series of unusual and seemingly arbitrary questions, the specifics of which vary between calls. These questions seemingly have no effect on any events that follow, and once these questions are answered, POI-4998 will stop the call abruptly. \n\nAfter approximately 11 business days from the original contact, the individual will receive a package at their current location of residence in the form of an unremarkable cardboard box of varying size. The only identifying information found on the box is a sticker displaying the logo for GOI-4998 \"MAKE WISH FOUNDATON [sic]\"[[footnote]] GOI-4998 is an organization that haphazardly generates unpredictably dangerous anomalies for no shown monetary gain.[[/footnote]]. Inside said box are several non-anomalous pet toys and blankets, and an organism bearing genetic and physical similarities to various canid species, designated SCP-4157-2. \n\nSCP-4157-2 instances are hairless quadrupeds, with inconsistently placed and mostly nonfunctional limbs and facial features. Most SCP-4157-2 instances are hostile and uncoordinated, but do not survive for long periods of time after their initial appearance due to all recorded specimens showing some degree of distortion of organ, muscle, and bone structure, resulting in major organ failure within the first day of manifestation in 85.6% of SCP-4157-2 instances. 44.7% of the previous percentage are SCP-4157-2 instances that are deceased upon arrival to the individual's household.\n\n**Addendum 4157-1:** The following transcript is of an organized call with Researcher Charlotte Mehr and POI-4998 via the number located on SCP-4157-1.\n--------\n[[collapsible show=\" (?)

The contents of which can be found transcribed below.\n--------\n[[collapsible show=\" (?)

The voice of POI-4998 is heard over this footage.//)\n> \n> **POI-4998:** Hello! This is the video where we show the dog! We use all 100% real dog like these in our products!\n> \n> **00.08:** (//Camera cuts to footage of an unidentified female child playing with a domesticated dog inside of a house.//)\n> \n> **POI-4998:** People like dog! People want dog! But sometimes, people do not want dog.\n> \n> **00.15:** (//A woman comes into the house, who then grabs the dog from the child and takes it outside; the woman starts screaming at the dog and the girl, and the girl starts crying.//) \n> \n> **POI-4998:** People don't want dog, but we want dog! And you do too! So we take dog from the people who don't want dog, and give them to those who WANT DOG!\n> \n> **00.26:** (//Footage cuts to the outside of the house; the dog is sitting in the front lawn whimpering, when an unidentified man with a hooded sweatshirt obstructing his face comes into view, picks up the dog and then runs out of frame. It is also of note that in the background, there appears to be a small amount of blood on one of the front windows of the original house.//)\n> \n> **POI-4998:** We get dog, we LOVE dog and then give dog to those who want dog! When dog is sad and so are you, no more sad happens when you two are together! \n> \n> **00.39:** (//Footage cuts back to the farm; the dog from before is now present and is running with the rest of the captive dogs. Camera then pans to the left to view a small shed by the enclosure.//)\n> \n> **POI-4998:** And how do we make dog happy? That is trade secret of MAKE WISH FOUNDATON. Do not investigate this process or MAKE WISH FOUNDATON will pursue legal and/or illegal actions. MAKE WISH FOUNDATON will make your wish of being happy by making dog happy for YOU!
