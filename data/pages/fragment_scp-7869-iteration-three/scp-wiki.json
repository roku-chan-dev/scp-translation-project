The deterrence features originally made to detect SCP-7869 instances which were implemented in some SCP Foundation sites will remain, of which are detailed below.\n\nFoundation zones which store non-anomalous techno-waste have been equipped with automatically triggering Scranton Reality Anchors and a constant Akiva Radiation detector has been installed at all Foundation Waste Disposal Areas to alert personnel to the presence of SCP-7869 instances and incapacitate the invading Instance. \n\nMisinformation campaigns have been launched in various civilian waste-handling areas to obscure the nature of SCP-7869’s thefts of digital waste, with a success rate of 97.5%.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7869 are a race of deific entities which reside and operate in a vibrationally higher dimension adjacent to baseline reality, referred to as ‘Heaven’ in religious texts. They show a very limited understanding of modern human technology (modern technology defined here as technological items and innovations created between the 20th-21st centuries) and are unable to replicate such technology by manual means although there has been a demand for such by the human residents of ‘Heaven’, of which there are currently 30.5 Billion present.\nDue to this, they have resorted to stealing technological scrap to refurbish through thaumaturgical means and distribute throughout ‘Heaven’ to appease these demands, with a record 1.5 billion metric tons of techno-waste being stolen each year from various scrapyards worldwide.\nSCP-7869 instances show a preference for items such as\n•Vehicle Chassis\n(This also includes vehicles such as electric scooters, jet-skis, and small engine boats.)\n• Smartphone Shells\n• Laptop/Computer Parts\n• Discarded Automatic Door Frames with Keycards\n• **//Foundation Waste (Including broken Scranton Reality Anchors, and old parts that were used for research and containment of various SCP objects)//** [No longer taken as of 08/02/2024]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2224801/light-sky-kyiv.jpg\n| caption=An attempt to photograph an SCP-7869 instance in Kyiv, Ukraine. Note obscuration of picture by the instance's anomalous effects.\n| width=300px]]\nSCP-7869 Instances communicate in archaic terms, have a tendency to include many words in one spoken sentence, and react //very// adversely and violently to repeated pain stimuli.\n\nAll SCP-7869 instances possess minor memetic effects [**which can bypass SCRAMBLE Goggle protection- research is ongoing as to why this is**] which cause individuals that look at them to perceive them differently with each glance, but they can still be identified by defining characteristics such as glowing halos, goat-like horns or wings. They also leave behind mass traces of Akiva radiation around every location they visit due to their innate connection with it- it is estimated that all SCP-7869 instances are comprised partly or fully of Akiva radiation. SCP-7869 instances can also be traced through the presence of silicon shards around any area that they have visited, as they shed silicon shards in place of sweat. Instances also suffer immense pain when a copy of the standard Bible is burned in their immediate vicinity due to their intrinsic relationship with the religion of Christianity.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://www.nist.gov/sites/default/files/images/2018/10/23/dsc_3174_processed_web.jpg\n| caption=A shard of silicon shed by an SCP-7869 instance.\n| width=300px]]\nThey also have the ability to obscure all conventional photographs and videos taken of them- photographs and videos of an SCP-7869 instance will only display as if the instance were a bright flash of light, obscuring their real appearance in the taken image. It is currently impossible to obtain a real image or video of any SCP-7869 instance for this reason.\n\n**SCP-7869 Instances in a //Wrath Threshold State// can also possess lethal pyrokinesis, minor-scale reality bending powers, the ability to manifest high-intensity lasers from their hands, an 'Impulse Effect' trigger which can shut off all thaumaturgical artifacts or weaponry in a 3-mile radius, and can summon cognitohazardous effects which disable an individual's brain for 24 hours when viewed. Although SCP-7869 instances are usually peaceful in nature, a //Wrath Threshold State// can be provoked if Instances are severely harmed, possess feelings of immense anger, or sense that an Instance is in grave danger, upon which the rage-state activates. The //Wrath Threshold State// of SCP-7869 instances was never recorded in written history before Incident-7869.**\n\n**Addendum:** //**[[Incident 7869]]**// On 05/02/2024, a pack of about 10 SCP-7869 instances in a //Wrath Threshold State// converged on Site-81 and decimated the wing housing the Department of Tactical Theology by using their combined abilities of pyrokinesis and high-intensity laser beam generation. While MTF Eta-77 was swiftly dispatched to contain the instances, attempted neutralization with thaumaturgic  and conventional weaponry was unsuccessful, as the instances disabled all thaumaturgical effects around them subsequently and overwhelmed their attackers by displaying potent cognitohazards, then proceeding to also tear apart MTF Eta-77's living quarters in an apparent fit of mindless vengeance.\n\nWhile the SCP-7869 instances teleported all personnel present in the wing housing the Department of Tactical Theology at the time of the attack safely to a nearby field (presumably due to their moral principles), both the affected wing and MTF Eta-77's living quarters were utterly unsalvageable due to the extent of the damage afflicted, and several SCP objects were also destroyed due to the attacks. The incident and its aftermath are estimated to cost the Foundation US$10,000,000 to salvage and repair completely due to its scope and severity.\n\nWhile several warning signs were detected up until the eve of the attack, such as random automatic Scranton Reality Anchor activations throughout Site-81 and SCRAMBLE goggles around the Site constantly flagging errors within their systems, these signs were mistakenly dismissed as odd software glitches and subsequently ignored by Foundation technicians, who had not been briefed on SCP-7869's properties prior to Incident-7869.\n\nDispatched cleanup personnel found another note while searching the ruins of Site-81, which read,\n 'THIS WAS ONLY A WARNING. GIVE US COMPENSATION FOR THE IMPRISONMENT OF OUR FELLOW NOW AND LEAVE US ALONE IN THE FUTURE, OR MORE WILL FOLLOW'.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n> //...//\n>\n> //I think we're all asking ourselves about what possessed Sr. Rsr. Willis to spontaneously act so unprofessionally during the interrogation of the prime SCP-7869 Instance- his actions cost us years worth of important knowledge on thaumaturgic anomalies and immense funds, and are thus completely unforgivable. I give you my word that he will be prosecuted with the full force of the Foundation. I have now opened an investigation case despite his compromised state to find out what compelled him to display his erratic behavior. Willis was a brilliant researcher, and I pray for his sake that he was under the influence of a hostile anomaly or agent and wasn't responsible for his actions, because if he was, God help me, there will be no mercy for him. He has already been demoted to D-Class effective today. Once he recovers, and it is discovered that he committed his infraction willingly, he will be sent to handle the more dangerous anomalies in our possession- an effective death sentence.//\n>\n> //But only exacting punishment on Willis is not enough. We have to pay closer attention to the SCP-7869 Instances. The Instances displayed an unexpected ferocity and were able to overpower MTF Eta-77, one of our best thaumaturgic strike forces, quickly- and they've threatened to do it again. We have to decide how we'll respond next, and we have to do so **quickly**. - O5-1//\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= //**The O5 Council will now vote on this issue.**//\n= **__Compensate the SCP-7869 Instances, or combat them with the full force of the Foundation?__**\n= **COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **O5-1**\n= ##red|COMBAT##\n\n**Comment:** Why should we bend to the empty threats of the SCP-7869 Instances? The attack on the Department of Tactical Theology and MTF Eta-77's living quarters were just empty shows of bravado. They can't even bring themselves to actually harm anyone, only cause property damage. If they want a fight, the Foundation is more than prepared.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **O5-2**\n= ##green|COMPENSATE##\n\n**Comment:** It was our fault that the Instances were pushed to this action, and so I believe they must be compensated appropriately. Besides, they have displayed an unprecedented level of power- they were able to destroy the reinforced Department of Tactical Theology building as if it were butter, and they were also able to down MTF Eta-77 quickly despite the team's inoculations against thaumaturgical hazards. Who knows if they are even more powerful than they have shown today? I fear for the Foundation, and Earth as a whole, if we choose to pursue combat.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **O5-7**\n= ##green|COMPENSATE##\n\n**Comment:** We have no choice but to leave them alone. While they were merciful to us today, and I'm using 'merciful' very sparingly here, if we chose to combat them, it would only lead to more destruction and possibly even mass casualties. It wouldn't achieve anything.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **O5-11**\n= ##red|COMBAT##\n\n**Comment:** They are anomalies. They do not deserve to be set free.

We cannot just completely raise our arms to the Instances- there needs to a compromise drafted to ensure that both ours and their demands are met. I want the Ethics Committee to get on it now. - O5-1//\n\nEthics Committee Expert Negotiators were dispatched to draft a compromise deal that would benefit both the Foundation and SCP-7869 as compensation. After the deal was drafted, it was dispatched to 'Heaven' by a Foundation thaumaturge, and the document below manifested on O5-9's desk very shortly after [**O5-9 is acting as the director of the Ethics Committee as of 10/11/2019**].\n> ++ SCP FOUNDATION ETHICS COMMITTEE\n> +++ //Foundation/SCP-7869 Compromise Deal [Simplified Ver.]//\n> **SCP Foundation's Requirements:**\n> •SCP-7869 instances are to provide the SCP Foundation with 50% of all repaired pilfered scrap materials.\n> •SCP-7869 instances are never to clandestinely enter any Foundation Site or designated area.\n> •SCP-7869 instances are never to work with any other Group of Interest in the event that they are discovered by such groups.\n> **SCP-7869 Instances' Requirements:**\n> •Reclassify SCP-7869 to //Archon//\n> •The Foundation is to arrange education programs to equip all SCP-7869 Instances with knowledge on how to replicate modern human technology and advancements to reduce theft from human scrapyards.\n> •The Foundation is to send reality benders and thaumaturges in their employ to 'Heaven' regularly to repair the damage that the dimension has sustained.\n> ++++ Drafted by Dr. Lawton Schiff of the Ethics Committee, Junior Researcher Carl Greenwood, and SCP-7869\n\n@@@@\n\n+++++ **To consult the full version of this document, please go to the RAISA branch at Site-138 and request it.**\n//Following further discussions between the O5 Council and groups of SCP-7869 Instances, the compromise deal was officiated and put into action on 09/02/2024. SCP-7869 Instances have not been sighted at any Foundation area since the officiation of the compromise.//\n\nBefore Senior Researcher Grant Willis could be prosecuted by the Ethics Committee for his inappropriate handling of the initially contained SCP-7869 Instance, he succumbed to his injuries and passed away on 10/02/2024. A postmortem autopsy revealed that a Chaos Insurgency-branded mental probe had been inserted into Sr. Rsr. Willis's brain and had been influencing his behavior- the events leading up to Incident-7869 have thus been assumed to be a purposeful move by the Insurgency to sabotage the Foundation during an important SCP object examination. It is unknown how the Chaos Insurgency was able to insert the mental probe into Willis's brain, as Willis was heavily guarded by a security team at all times. Sr. Rsr. Willis has now been posthumously acquitted of his infractions, as he was not directly responsible for them at the period during which they were committed.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n> **Private Electronic Logs of Junior Researcher Carl Greenwood, 10th February 2024 [[Level 3/001]]** \n>\n> **//February 10 2024//**\n>\n>>\n>> I kind of feel guilty for... What happened to Site-81. Claire tried to reassure me that it wasn't my fault, but... I'm not sure. All of this happened because I discovered the skip. If I'd just left the damn thing alone, then all of this wouldn't have happened. Who would've thought? Angels stealing stuff and being destructive wasn't on anyone's bucket list for the month. Shouldn't have trusted Willis to keep it together throughout the interrogation either... The old man was already showing signs of mental illness before this, and he should've been the last person to ever touch SCP-7869. Well... Hey, at least I got promoted. That's better than nothing.\n>> Carl out.\n>",
