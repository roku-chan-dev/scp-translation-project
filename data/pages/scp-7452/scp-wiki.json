Research is currently underway to identify a possible method to awaken SCP-7452 for experimentation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7452 is the skull of an //Ursus americanus// (black bear) possessing an intense fluctuating signature of Elan-Vital Energy (EVE). The item was obtained from Eric Klammanski, designated PoI-7452.\n\nAccording to PoI-7452, when SCP-7452 is active, it possesses flames in its eye sockets and speaks in a deep, masculine voice. The item is allegedly able to predict future events including, but not limited to, games of chance. The user is required to sacrifice blood to SCP-7452 before soliciting it for predictions.\n\nFollowing its acquisition by the Foundation, SCP-7452 is presently dormant. A method of awakening it has not been determined due to a lack of knowledge held by PoI-7452 regarding such a process.\n\n------\n**Addendum:** SCP-7452 was obtained in Kyuzhevitz, North Carolina, USA. Prior to containment, PoI-7452 attempted to use information gathered from the object to win the Super-Duper Millions Jackpot on July 18, 2014. A video was filmed by a bystander during the event and posted to social media; PoI-7452 admitted to the existence of SCP-7452 in this video, alerting Foundation webcrawlers. Site-56 personnel were dispatched and successfully detained PoI-7452.\n\nFollowing containment, the convenience store in which the aforementioned event occurred was identified. The store's security footage of the event was obtained successfully; the transcript below has been written with data gathered from both the security footage and the video filmed by the bystander.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Transcript 7452-1**\n\n**Location:** Choi's Corner Market in Kyuzhevitz, NC, USA\n\n**Date:** July 18, 2014\n\n**Foreword:** The Super-Duper Millions Jackpot draws its numbers every Friday at 22:00 EDT.\n------\n= **<Begin Log>**\n------\n\n//It is 21:50 EDT. PoI-7452 is waiting behind another customer at the cash register, fidgeting with a piece of paper. His right hand is bandaged. He continuously checks his wristwatch and wipes the sweat from his face.//\n\n//The customer in front of PoI-7452 finishes the transaction and walks away from the counter. The clerk, identified as store owner Kang-doo Choi, waves goodbye.//\n\n**Choi:** Thank you, come again!\n\n//Choi turns towards PoI-7452 as the latter approaches the counter with the paper.//\n\n//PoI-7452 grins as he sets the paper on the counter and claps his hands.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Choi, my man! You know the drill, one Super-Duper ticket my good sir.\n\n//Choi frowns as PoI-7452 points at the paper.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** I got the winning numbers //right here//, they're uh... \n\n//PoI-7452 looks down at the paper.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Eight, six, seventy-five, thirty...\n\n//PoI-7452 looks up at Choi, who is shaking his head.//\n\n**Choi:** Eric, out of good conscience, I refuse to sell you any more lotto tickets.\n\n**PoI-7452:** Wha- how come?! \n\n**Choi:** You've spent thousands of dollars on the lotto. Scratchers, Super-Duper, Lucky Horseshoe, and every time you win //nothing//. \n\n**PoI-7452:** Okay, but now I //know// the numbers, Choi. I'll actually win now, just let me enter one last time!\n\n**Choi:** I will //not// indulge your addiction anymore, for your own good.\n\n**PoI-7452:** Sir, just- after this, after today, I'll be set for life! Please just sell me the ticket!\n\n**Choi:** No means no, Eric.\n\n//PoI-7452 rubs his forehead and hair with his hands.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** You know you're losing my money by refusing me service, right Choi?\n\n//Choi looks at the line of customers behind PoI-7452, one of which is holding up a smartphone to film the event.//\n\n**Choi:** I can survive without watching you suffer. There's paying customers behind you with places to be.\n\n//PoI-7452 checks his watch.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Shit, nine fifty-four!\n\n//PoI-7452 holds up the paper and points at it.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** These numbers'll expire in six minutes! I need to play them //now!//\n\n**Choi:** Play them next week, today you take a break.\n\n**PoI-7452:** But Choi, I can't- I can't play them next week, I told you!\n\n**Choi:** Why not?\n\n//PoI-7452 pauses to breathe and wipe his brow.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Look, uh... I found this bear skull, right? It was like a- a magic skull, it could talk to me and predict the future. I had to give it my blood...\n\n//PoI-7452 shows Choi his bandaged hand.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** ...to get it to tell me today's lottery numbers. The problem is, after it told me, it fell asleep, and I don't know how to wake it up for next week's lottery. So that's how I got these numbers and why I need to use them //today.//\n\n//Choi stares at PoI-7452.//\n\n**Choi:** You need to see a doctor.\n\n**PoI-7452:** Wait- no, I'm not bullshitting, I promise! Just let me play one more time, sir! Please!\n\n//PoI-7452 clasps his hands together.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Mister Choi, I beg you. Just one more game, then I'll never, //ever// play again. I'll give you twenty-five... thirty percent of the winnings. \n\n//PoI-7452 leans forward towards Choi.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Just //one// more time, then I'll quit forever. Please sir, //please.//\n\n//Choi looks behind PoI-7452 at the line of customers. He takes a deep breath.//\n\n**Choi:** This //will// be your last lotto, Eric. What are the numbers again?\n\n//PoI-7452 pumps his fists.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** YES! Okay, uh... eight, six, seventy-five, thirty, and nine.\n\n**Choi:** ...seventy-five, thirty-nine?\n\n**PoI-7452:** No, it's...\n\n//PoI-7452 holds up the paper towards Choi and points at the numbers on it.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** It's thirty, as in \"three-zero\", and //then// the last number is nine.\n\n**Choi:** Three-zero, and nine. Five dollars.\n\n//PoI-7452 inserts his credit card into the card reader. It beeps twice.//\n\n**Choi:** It declined.\n\n**PoI-7452:** NO!!\n\n//PoI-7452 turns towards the line of customers behind him.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Can someone pay for me? I'll pay you back, I promise!\n\n//The other customers snicker at PoI-7452.//\n\n**Customer 1:** Get a job!\n\n**PoI-7452:** You don't get it! I found a magic skull and it told me today's lottery numbers! One more play and I'm set for life!\n\n**Customer 2:** Go see a shrink, you junkie!\n\n//PoI-7452 scratches his head and looks at his watch.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Look, uh... I got a blanket and a pack of Newports in my car, I'll give them to you, just someone //please// help a brother out!\n\n//Another customer checks her phone, then looks at PoI-7452.//\n\n**Customer 3:** If I pay, will you finally leave?\n\n**PoI-7452:** Yes yes yes! Please!\n\n//Customer 3 sighs and approaches the counter. She places her six-pack of beer on the counter, Choi scans it.//\n\n**Choi:** With the lotto ticket, it's eleven ninety-seven.\n\n//The customer inserts her credit card into the reader. It beeps once; Choi nods his head at PoI-7452.//\n\n//The lottery ticket is printed out, Choi hands it to PoI-7452, who examines it.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** Nine fifty-nine! I fucking made it! Nine fifty-nine!\n\n//PoI-7452 laughs as he pumps his fists in the air.//\n\n**Customer 3:** Excuse me, my Newports?\n\n**PoI-7452:** Of course, of course! Thank you so, so, //so// much, ma'am! \n\n//PoI-7452 looks at Choi.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** And Choi, you're the man as always! Thank you for coming around!\n\n//Customer 3 and PoI-7452 exit the store as the latter points at Choi.//\n\n**PoI-7452:** As I promised, twenty percent!\n\n------\n= **<End Log>**\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nFollowing this event, the winning numbers given by SCP-7452 were revealed to have been for the North Carolina Lucky Horseshoe Lottery, and not the Super-Duper Millions Jackpot.\n\n@@ @@ \n\n\n[[div style=\"display:none\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-7451]]] | SCP-7452 | [[[SCP-7453]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** skully.jpg\n> **Name:** Black bear skull 2\n> **Author:** Acroterion\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Black_bear_skull_2.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Additional Notes:** Slightly cropped from original\n\n\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
