Due to the nature of SCP-2786, all personnel assigned to the study and reconnaissance of the anomaly are to exhibit extreme caution during testing.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Description:</strong> SCP-2786 is the designation for a <del>metaphysical entity</del> narrative-based bipedal humanoid of indeterminate age, sex and appearance. SCP-2786 will be idiosyncratically perceived by any being that interacts with it, varying in traits from interaction to interaction. SCP-2786 displays symptoms of narcissistic personality disorder and appears fantasy-prone, often having difficulty distinguishing between internal landscapes, narrative works, and physical being.</p>\n</ br>\n<p>SCP-2786's nature was first brought to the attention of the Foundation when several forms of horror media were found to have been illegally altered in a means that did not coincide with standard editing equipment. Upon closer observation, all narratives altered in this manner involved substantially changing the plot to include SCP-2786, who is always perceived as a protagonist or \"Deus ex machina\" character. SCP-2786's presence within a story ultimately disrupts the flow of events, leading to different (and often positive) endings. SCP-2786's actions within various media suggests it may have a mild form of precognition or anomalous intuition, often preventing characters from progressing the plot in a way that avoids danger entirely.</p> \n</ br>\n<p><strong>Addendum 2786-1-1A:</strong> List of alterations </p>\n</ br>\n<table class=\"wiki-content-table\">\n<tr>\n<th>Affected Works</th>\n<th>Notable Alterations</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>The Shining</em> (Film), 1980</td>\n<td>Film is without alteration until halfway through, during a scene in which two characters venture into a hedge maze; SCP-2786 appears in the background, observing the individuals. Entity moves off camera and is not seen again until twenty minutes later. SCP-2786 reappears in the Overlook Hotel, approaching antagonist Jack Torrence from behind. Torrence is seen drinking and conversing with the ghost of a dead bartender. SCP-2786 takes the antagonist's drink, pours it out, and hits him over the head with the glass. The tumbler shatters on impact, Torrence falling from his seat and onto the floor, outside the camera frame. SCP-2786 is seen briefly peering downward, but turns and walks off camera a moment later. The rest of the Torrence family is then escorted off the Overlook's premises by the entity and into the blizzard. Camera cuts to epilogue, Danny and Wendy Torrence in a new studio apartment and apparently doing well. Movie ends forty-five minutes early.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Silent Hill</em> (Film), 2006</td>\n<td>SCP-2786 manifests early on, warning main character Rose not to bring her daughter to Silent Hill. After it becomes apparent that they are adamant about going, SCP-2786 frowns and disappears off camera. Some time later, Rose goes to start her car only to find it non-functional for an unknown reason. Unable to make the trip, Rose and her daughter stay inside and build a one thousand piece jigsaw puzzle of a lighthouse until the movie abruptly ends.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>House of Leaves</em> (Novel), 2000</td>\n<td>SCP-2786 appears in the <em>Navidson</em> metanarrative, confronting Karen and insisting she and her family avoid moving to Ash Tree Lane. Karen convinces her husband and the <em>Navidson Record</em> ceases to exist for the remainder of the story. Narrator/protagonist Johnny Truant is no longer negatively affected by the material, going on to describe his life at the tattoo parlor, which seems improved by SCP-2786's presence. Entity is referred to as \"HERO\" throughout the story, which ends three hundred pages early.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Cabin in the Woods</em> (Film), 2012</td>\n<td>SCP-2786 appears shortly into the film, posing as one of the college kids heading to a remote cabin vacation as a group. No characters refer to the entity by name or gender, but do not seem fazed by its presence and react with candor. SCP-2786 attempts to stop the characters from interacting with one of the many cursed items in the basement of the cabin, including the diary of the late Patience Buckner, an event that would otherwise go on to resurrect the undead corpses of her and her family. Unfortunately, SCP-2786 was unable to keep one of the main characters, Marty, from inspecting a set of negatives on a vintage projector reel, setting in motion the release of a large lycanthrope which proceeds to maul one of the teenagers. SCP-2786 is seen pulling the attacker off of its victim, grabbing a spoon from a set of vintage silver cutlery found conveniently nearby and stabbing the creature multiple times until it expires. Film ends without mention of B-plot, the final scene detailing their escape from the woods and recounting of the event from the table of a fast food restaurant in what is presumably a future date.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Amnesia: The Dark Descent</em> (Video game), 2010</td>\n<td>In affected copy of the game, player was greeted by SCP-2786 when the protagonist Daniel awakens on the floor of Castle Brennenberg without his memory. SCP-2786 addresses the character directly and not the player, insisting he \"sits this one out\". SCP-2786 proceeds to progress through the game, the camera following it despite no further dialogue on the character's end, suggesting he was left behind. Player is unable to control any game functions aside from pausing the game, during which SCP-2786 is seen loitering in the background and appearing impatient. Completion of game by SCP-2786 is done swiftly, the entity brute-forcing most puzzles and interacting with the environment in a way that is not possible for the player. Upon encountering a Gatherer, SCP-2786 brandishes a handgun from an unknown source, firing several times at the entity until the weapon is emptied of ammunition. The Gather emits a scream of pain but is otherwise undeterred. SCP-2786 reacts with surprise at this but recovers quickly, tossing the pistol upwards and catching it by the barrel on its descent. Subject then proceeds to physically assault the adversary with the butt of its handgun out of frame. This continues for the next fourty-seven minutes, which proves effective in terminating the usually-impervious enemies. Game proceeds in this manner until SCP-2786 confronts and kills main antagonist Alexander Brennenberg, after which it appears to flex for no one in particular, sigh, and then walk off camera. Game credits roll shortly thereafter.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Incident Log 2786-1-1A:</strong></p>\n\n<p>On ██/██/████, three days before scheduled monthly terminations and reassignment, SCP-2786 appeared to manifest onsite without warning. Subject remained cooperative for the most part, but was generally considered obdurate and unlikable.</p>\n\n<p>Although seemingly incorporeal, SCP-2786 exhibited an apparent blending of reality, narrative causality and internal fantasy. Hume readings of SCP-2786 reveal little difference from baseline, yet the anomaly behaves and interacts with reality in a way that warps the flow of events to follow what appears to be standard narrative cohesion. It is unknown how SCP-2786 managed to manifest itself within the Foundation, but there has been some <a href=\"/sandrewswann-s-proposal\">hypothesis</a> on the nature of this subject.</p>\n\n \n<p><strong>Addendum 2786-1-2A:</strong> Interview Logs</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Interviewee:</strong> SCP-2786</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> <a href=\"/your-future-is-bright\" target=\"_blank\">Agent Markus Mcclanahan</a></p>\n</ br>\n<p><em>Note: This was the first and only recording of a willing interview between SCP-2786 and Foundation personnel.</em></p>\n<hr \\>\n<br>\n<p> [BEGIN LOG] </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Alright, this is a bit impromptu, but, given the circumstances, I think you at least owe us some answers.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Straight to the point, I like it. Works for me too, I have business elsewhere.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Business? What kind of business?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> <em>The hero's work is never done.</em></p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> So, you're a hero then?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Am. Always have been. Is that what this is about?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Not quite. How did you end up in our facility?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> What, this chop shop? Same way I find myself in any other place. I go where I'm called upon. </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> So, who called upon you? </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> [laughs] Those in distress. The suffering. Is this <em>really</em> not making any sense to you? I'm the champion. It's what I do. </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Is that what you were doing when we found you in the horror flicks? And the books?\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> The what now? </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Where—where you were before you manifested here.\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Ah, you meant the campground? Camp Crystal Lake.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Yes, that's the one.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> That one's actually a funny story. See, I usually have a rough time with the bigger guys, sometimes even <em>I</em> worry I won't make it out when the baddies are Eldritch horrors or what-have-you. These teenagers, I can't even believe they needed me to dispatch <em>one guy</em> for them. I have more important things to do than babysit a few kids who made the mistake of ignoring all the obvious warning signs. This guy comes lumbering out of the woods, burly fella, big ol' knife in hand. I barely broke a sweat kicking his mask in. </p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> I saw that, yes.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> You were <em>there</em>?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Not exactly, no.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Huh. So, is that it? Can I go?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> We still have a few more things to discuss—</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> Listen, I've been pretty cordial considering, I usually get right to work but honestly you guys have been holding me up from the get-go. I'm here for a reason, you know.</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>Agent Mcclanahan:</strong> Right, right, the suffering. Who might they be?</p>\n</ br>\n<p><strong>SCP-2786:</strong> I think you know. It's better if you don't, anyway.</p>\n</ br>\n<p> [SCP-2786 promptly stands up and phases through the wall on its left. Containment breach alarms trigger shortly thereafter.]</p>\n</ br>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Following the events of the interview, Site-180's humanoid containment wing and seven of its ten D-Class personnel cell blocks were found breached by an unknown source. SCP-2786 is suspected to have been involved in the event. Approximately ███ D-Class and █ humanoid anomalies were found missing from their chambers. <del>SCP-2786 remains at large.</del></p>\n\n<p>SCP-2786 was detected less than forty-eight hours later, attempting to save characters in a Blu-Ray copy of <em>Saw IV</em> in the Site-180 employee lounge. The affected copy was played on a loop until its current containment measures were devised. SCP-2786 has been placed in its enhanced narrative complex and containment is considered a success.</p> \n\n\n</div>\n</div>\n <div class=\"rando\" style=\"display:none;\">\n                    <div id=\"action-area-top\"></div>\n                    \n\n\n                    \n\n\n\n                    <div id=\"page-content\">\n<blockquote>\n<br>\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\"><tt><strong>EVENT LOG 2786-4591</strong></tt></div>\n<p><hr /><br></p>\n<p><tt>INIT SUBSTRATE BUILD @ 0xc0000159 ; OK</tt></p>\n<p><tt>LOADING CORE ASSETS&#8230 PLEASE WAIT</tt></p>\n<p><tt>LOADING narrative_threeact_04.txt &#8230; DONE</tt><br />\n<tt>LOADING character_model_superlist_04.db &#8230; DONE</tt><br />\n<tt>LOADING world_model_superlist_04.db &#8230; DONE</tt><br />\n<tt>LOADING settings.ini &#8230; DONE</tt></p>\n<p><tt>INIT PROTOCOL 2786-PROVIDENCE.obf</tt></p>\n<p><tt>&#8230;</tt></p>\n<p><tt>RENDERING&#8230;</tt></p>\n<br>\n<br>                       \n<p><tt><em>&quot;</em>HERO.<em>&quot;</em></tt></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>&quot;Please wake up.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p><em>&quot;We need you, the world needs you.&quot;</em></p>\n<p><br /></p>\n<p>When the <tt>HERO</tt> opened their eyes, they knew of confusion and nothing else. Existence was a show of great clouds, patterns and shapes, filled with color and without reference just moments before, now rapidly fading to nothing. Roused from a sleep that was as instant as it was endless, the champion's form slowly remembered who they were and, more importantly, <em>why</em> they were.</p> \n<p>Brushing off fleeting thoughts of contextless imagery and other remnants of sleep, the <tt>HERO</tt> was greeted by a shining form that stood at the foot of the bed, radiant and beautiful, like a warm and glowing embrace, one of a goddess and a matriarch. The Great Warrior squinted at her with blurred vision through eyes with irises that shifted hue between blinks, eyes which struggled to adjust to the effervescent brilliance before them. The <tt>HERO</tt> used this opportunity to look about the room and drew their gaze from her to do so.</p> \n<p>The space they awoke within was unfamiliar and strange, though that fact mattered little. The details, although hazy, were concrete enough to bring the <tt>HERO</tt> back to here and now. The mission, the <em>purpose</em> of it all. The champion yawned as she spoke again.</p>\n<p><em>&quot;</em><tt>HERO</tt><em>, your time has come. Do you remember your past? The great calamity slain that rises once more. He who brought its blight unto the people of Homeworld, the destroyer. A great Horror, it lives eternal, and it festers in the Valley of the Forgotten. Life cries out as a beckoning to its savior.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>The plot sounded a tad familiar, déjà vu perhaps? Then again, all the worlds in need seemed to blend together after a while.</p>\n<p>As the <tt>HERO</tt> stood and shook off the fatigue of a billion wars, they felt the nobility in their blood surging without a second of hesitation. Clear, awake and aware, our protagonist surveyed the interior with greater scrutiny and found that it described a small hut, one made of wood and fiber and leaf. The sun was shining through the entry and various cracks in the walls, signaling the dawn of a new day. Everything was rather bright, more so than they were used to, but welcome to the <tt>HERO</tt> all the same; they heard the familiar, panicked cries of distress over the horizon, those distant woes that had summoned them many times before, to many places like this. Suffering, oppressed millions silently mourning in unison, creating a waveform only their savior could hear. </p>\n<p> The God-Warrior, ever elegant in their design, drew an unwavering gaze to the one that had awakened them—a feminine being, whose inner light was an outer light, ineffable. She who brings the call to action, her shining visage a sight to behold, beautiful and without flaw. A princess, or spirit of the woods, or whatever she was. She had her role, and she played it perfectly. The <tt>HERO</tt> gazed upon her figure and understood.</p>\n<p>&quot;How did I get here?&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;</em><tt>HERO</tt><em>, you were injured from your toils, the wars of many worlds. I have rescued you, brought you to my people, so your destiny can be fulfilled.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>&quot;Right, destiny. I remember now.&quot;</p>\n<p><em>&quot;Good. Then you shall go forth, defeat the great Oblivion, before it cleaves the flesh from our bones, I beg of you. Bring peace to this realm, for it is your fate, and your duty. The wheel of fortune spins in your favor. Ready yourself and make haste.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>Understanding the weight of her words, the <tt>HERO</tt> gave a nod and parted ways with their fair goddess, knowing what must be done and seeing the routes laid before them. Their journey was clear, and the answers there, as information in space-between-spaces. In the preamble, which they had known so well, and traveled so many times before.</p>\n<p>As the One, paragon, exited the tiny structure, they emerged into a lush world, expansive in its design. Limits boundless,  creation magnificent, and there it existed, solely for the warrior, those in need, and the dance they would share for the rest of time. The champion was oblivious to this, the scheme that surrounded them, for the being's selflessness was all-encompassing, their empathy grand and their heart ever-pure.</p>\n<p>They believed it, felt it all and, in that brief moment, the <tt>HERO</tt> was euphoric within their place, playing their part in the Way-of-Things. The being set out on their quest without another thought.</p>\n<br>\n<hr />\n<br>\n<p>The path to the unholy abomination spanned across seasons and continents. A ravaged world, fraught with perils, many the <tt>HERO</tt> had seen before. They dodged these dangers with ease and a familiarity known only to the Archetype. <em>Fight true</em>, spoke the Mother-Queen, her blessing a kiss on the forehead of the chosen child, her spirit guiding, pulling the savior to their end, their destiny. <em>Flay the beast with a thousand heads, whose spawn tore throats from the innocent and razed the gates of Paradise. Drive your blade into its wretched hide, so it may heed the champion's call, and the voice of the Goddess will sing a song of harmony that will echo throughout the land.</em></p>\n<p>Like courage incarnate, our champion flew through the beast's ghastly domains, eviscerating anything that attempted to slow them down, large and small, without hesitation. They took a small detour along the way, heeding advice from an old fortuneteller who told them of skies in flame and the impervious scales of their Adversary on the day of the Great Battle between the two. Her words spoke to retrieve   the shattered remnants of such-and-such Divine Amulet, an artifact with which the <tt>HERO</tt> would use to fell that mighty, nameless evil who plagued these people and restore prosperity to their world. Once complete, they pressed forward with the confidence and steadfast will only the paradigm could possess, traits which they had gathered from so many battles won throughout millennia.</p>\n<p>They continued onward in a formulaic stride until the being stood at the gate of Supreme Evil itself. The beast's lair was a crooked tower built atop a lonely mountainside and sealed at the entrance by protective magicks and deadly traps. The champion paid those ornate, towering doors little mind, opting instead to move along the outer perimeter with a certainty that surprised even them. More than a hunch, but less than knowing. As if on autopilot, the being walked up to a thin crack in the posterior side of the tower, obscured by bushes and vines. The luminous sigils that blanketed the entryway were not present here, and the protagonist was able to sneak inside with no resistance whatsoever.</p>\n<p>\nWhile passing through those cold and barren back halls, taking pains to make little noise as they approached a chamber likely occupied by the King of Darkness, our <tt>HERO</tt> mentally prepared for the obvious ambush waiting ahead. Instead, the abomination was found peacefully asleep, curled aside a pile of bones and tattered clothes, much smaller than the legends claimed, and even less cunning; those wards and alarm-like security hexes, still intact on the doors on the opposite end of the room, seemed to imply a grave lack of forethought on the part of the Great Deceiver that supposedly resided here.</p>\n\n<p>Quietly and cleanly, the protagonist pressed the smooth steel of their broadsword into one of the Shadowcaster's horrid, yellow eyes, twisting the instrument until death was of certainty. The terrible creature writhed momentarily and was still not long after.</p>\n<p>There was a brief moment of silence as the protagonist stood, motionless, over the corpse of the supposed greatest evil. The Harbinger of Wars died <em>so easily</em>, quivering like a child, not even awake to put up a fight. The Divine Amulet, whose power was supposedly near infinite, lay unused. Acquiring all twenty-eight pieces of the gaudy necklace seemed like too much work to not be utilized once. Even worse, in that moment, with the Biggest Bad in all the land truly gone, our <tt>HERO</tt> felt <em>absolutely nothing</em>.</p>\n<p>The whole scenario just felt wrong, tampered with. Everything took way too long without being remotely challenging, playing out in increasingly predictable ways. The bones of lost souls piled near the champion's least satisfying arch-nemesis to date were taunting the warrior with feelings of imperfection and bolstering an innate drive to keep trying. It felt awfully familiar and very confusing, almost repetitive, and not very believable at all. Like if someone was lying, but the liar was the world. But if this is the Place of Lies, where would the Place of Truth be?
