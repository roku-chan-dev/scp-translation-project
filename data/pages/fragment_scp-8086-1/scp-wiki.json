  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-8086\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to SCP-8086's recent development and its unpredictable manifestations, SCP-8086 is currently uncontained.\n\nEfforts to neutralize SCP-8086 are underway.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8086 refers to the manifestation and rapid demanifestation of aerial vehicles, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-A instances, throughout Siberia.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-8086-1/MapChart_Map.png|caption=SCP-8086's manifestation zone.]]\n\nSCP-8086-A instances will manifest out of a red portal that will appear in the sky, hereafter referred to as SCP-8086-B instances, and fly for a few seconds before another SCP-8086-B instance manifests causing the aforementioned SCP-8086-A instance to demanifest.\n\nAs of October 10th, 2010, testing has shown that the distance and time between the manifestations of an SCP-8086-B instance is consistent, with the time between the manifestations being 3.42 seconds.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt's a well-known tale that Prometheus gave fire to the mortals below, issuing in a new era of human dominance.\n\nThe Zhujihui, who militarily aided us with the old SCP-8086, is run by personnel who require ionizing radiation to function at full capacity. As such, they generally include small nuclear reactors in their vehicles, which they call solar furnaces. It's quite impressive how small these solar furnaces can be, as well as how monumental they can be in the Right Phase.\n\nRegardless, just like baseline reality and the Right Phase, the demonic layer of reality is populated by sentient beings who have created civilization after civilization. Hunter Industries blessed their world with the Industrial Revolution, and I fear we, like how Prometheus brought the sun down to the mortals, have inadvertently given the demons access to a solar furnace from that missing wyvern-ship.\n\nPrometheus, for his hubris, was bound with chains, and his liver was eaten by an eagle every day.\n\nAnd I fear we too are about to get our just desserts.\n\n[[>]]\nDr. Konstantyn Jackowski\nHead of the Demonic Department\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 1:**\n\nOn November 15th, 2010, it was noted that a SCP-8086 manifestation had taken 3.58 seconds. As the next manifestation had taken the expected 3.42 seconds, it was assumed that that manifestation's duration was an outlier. However, the following manifestations' durations deviated from the expected duration, ranging from 0.34 seconds to 15.76 seconds.\n\nTwo weeks later on November 29th, an SCP-8086-A instance manifested above a small Siberian town before crash-landing in the middle of the town, causing the makeshift solar furnace within the SCP-8086-A instance to explode, destroying approximately 6% of the town. Afterward, the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/centre-du-dcd|Department of Censorship and Disinformation]]] swiftly arrived on the scene, utilizing DCD-████ to cover up the incident.\n\nFollowing this, the O5 Council began preparing a briefing to give to other major anomalous organizations to begin discussing the possibility of an invasion by the demonic layer of reality and what defensive measures would be necessary to implement.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nWar? That's preposterous.\n\nThis is not war. At best, this is the efforts of a mad scientist who reverse-engineered some technology randomly plopped into his world.\n\nAt worst, this is the fruit of an entire research lab's attempt to figure out how a solar furnace works and remake it. Still, this does not mean war.\n\nJust because a technology is discovered or created does not mean it will be used to its fullest extent.\n\nA Roman was the first to invent a steam engine, yet the Empire at large saw no use for the doo-dad that moved on its own. As such, it took another millennium and a half before the steam engine's potential was realized and acted upon.\n\nAt present, we are unlikely to have to truly worry about SCP-8086. With what I know about the demonic layer, they are unlikely to figure out how nuclear fission works from just having access to an extremely small and efficient nuclear reactor which is likely killing their researchers as they study it.\n\nIf they do figure it out, though, and the technology begins to be used by a bad actor who wishes to expand his empire's reach, then we will need to worry.\n\nBecause then, and only then, will we be at war.\n\n[[>]]\nDr. Maslov T. Manferd\nSite Director of SCP Foundation Site-470\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 2:**\n\nFollowing an agreement between the Foundation, the Global Occult Coalition, the Unusual Investigations Unit, and GRU Division \"P\", the organizations all established patrols and defensive structures in and around SCP-8086's manifestation zone.\n\nShould an SCP-8086-A instance not demanifest within less than 20 seconds, the soldiers of each involved anomalous organization were instructed to open fire on the instance.\n\nApproximately 2 weeks later, an SCP-8086-A instance spent 26 seconds within baseline reality before demanifesting, during which time it was fired upon by a GRU Division \"P\" anti-air canon, damaging its wing.\n\nFollowing this, SCP-8086's manifestation frequency gradually slowed until it ceased completely for a period of 5 months before beginning again. However, instead of SCP-8086 demanifesting after the standard 3.58 seconds, the SCP-8086-A instances remained in baseline reality for several minutes at minimum, with one instance demanifesting after 24 minutes. The SCP-8086-A instances were now additionally armed with weaponry, which they used to fire at anything that moved that wasn't an SCP-8086-A instance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nIt's generally agreed upon that one should not try to poke a sleeping bear, much less one merely wandering around.\n\nUnfortunately for us, after we gave the bear the ability to produce endless energy rather efficiently, we then shot it with an anti-aircraft gun for daring to use its newfound power.\n\nFortunately for us, we're not the only ones upset about these angry demons. The [[[https://scp-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/wind-dew-travel-agency|Wind Dew Travel Agency's]]] pissed that they had to stop tours to the demonic layer and to the area of Siberia where the SCP-8086-A instances are hanging out, as apparently it's a hot tourist destination for certain [[[scp-457|heat based species.]]]\n\nHunter Industries is also pissed, not only because their economic control in several demonic layer nations is in jeopardy because the demons figured out nuclear fission, but because they're now attacking Hunter Industries' home turf.\n\nOn the bright side, due to the previously mentioned economic control, Hunter Industries has some influence in some regions there. I heard through the grapevine that they were sending some people there to get the demons to stop sending their military into Russia's backyard.\n\nLet's just hope that wherever these planes are coming from, the demons there will listen to Adam Hunter. Because if they don't and they try to escalate this battle, well, let's just say:\n\nThe demonic entities have just now discovered nuclear weaponry.\n\nWe've //perfected// it.\n[[>]]\nDr. Maslov T. Manferd\nSite Director of SCP Foundation Site-470\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 3:**\n\nOn May 13th, 2011, SCP-8086's manifestations ceased completely. It's presumed that this occurred due to Hunter Industries' actions in the demonic layer of reality. Hunter Industries sent representatives to Dügia[[footnote]]The nation in the demonic layer where SCP-8086 manifestations originated from.[[/footnote]] and demanded that its ruler, High Demon Elgrim, immediately cease all incursions into baseline reality under the threat that Hunter Industries would stop providing Dügia with all human goods the company brought into the demonic layer.\n\nHigh Demon Elgrim gave in to Hunter Industries' demands, opting instead to invade nearby nations in the demonic layer instead of invading baseline reality. Despite this, defensive structures are still being built throughout baseline reality in the event that SCP-8086's manifestations begin again.",
