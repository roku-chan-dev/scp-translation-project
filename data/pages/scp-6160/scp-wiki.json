No personnel are permitted to enter SCP-6160 under any circumstances. The guest bedroom door and the basement have been sealed shut with concrete.\n\nAny personnel who enter the basement are considered lost. No efforts to retrieve them will be made.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6160 is a two-story residential home located in Hexgan, Nevada. Although the property itself does not showcase inherent anomalous properties, it has been documented as being a hotspot for non-descriptive[[footnote]] Thoth class anomalies have known anomalous qualities, although for one reason or another, said anomalous features can not be directly stated. The class is also applicable for it's containment procedures.

Beneath SCP-6160 is an underground tunnel believed to extend several kilometers into the earth. The full extent of SCP-6160 has not been measured, as all personnel who enter it are eventually lost.\n\nThe corpse of Agatha Blythe was found near the entrance of the basement. Her body exhibited signs of extreme weakness, malnutrition, and dehydration, suggesting death via continuous, non-stop overexertion.\n\nThe initial investigation of her death by authorities led to the discovery of the tunnel system beneath SCP-6160. After several officers were lost, Foundation agents embedded within law enforcement reported the anomaly, prompting the implementation of containment procedures.\n\nAgatha Blythe's mobile device contained several dozen audio files, many shared with her close family. Notable excerpts have been listed below, having been scanned and cleaned by both the Department of Infohazards and the Department of Tactical Theology.\n\n> ----\n> [[size 115%]] **05/OCT/2003** [[/size]] ##transparent|lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala## [[size 115%]] **Department of** [[/size]]\n> ##f5f5f5|.......##**11:23** ##transparent|lalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalalala## [[size 115%]]**Tactical Theology** [[/size]]\n> ----\n>  Hey mom!
