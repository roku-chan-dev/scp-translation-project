If the changes are not limited to your own article(s) and/or are substantial changes across multiple entries, you should post in that month's discussion page and then make the changes.\n\n++* Q: I wrote an article and it seems to have stuck. Can I send a blurb of mine to one of the frequent collaborators?\n\nA: Yup!
