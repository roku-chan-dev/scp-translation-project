No personnel under Level Three clearance are allowed to utilize the anomaly without express permission from the current Project Lead or from any personnel with Level Four clearance and above.\n\nAll simulations created by SCP-8065 are to be thoroughly documented for future use. Failure to comply will result in reprimanding and potential demotion on the project, along with restrictions being placed on the offending personnel's usage of the anomaly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8065 is a Foundation-made supercomputer with a custom anomalous operating system. It is capable of running only one program, which runs immediately upon startup. Within the program there is a comprehensive list of all simulations run, and a timeline of events for each individual simulation, as well as a text field. The text field is used to input the wanted simulation, which must be prefaced with a two to three letter code. A description of the event must also appear, such as \"End of the World Scenario\". If a scenario is not already present in the Foundation list of K Class Scenarios, inputting it into SCP-8065 will automatically add it to the database. It will also automatically generate a description from findings in the simulation. Further specifications can be added after this point.\n\nSCP-8065 was created by the Foundation throughout 2015 utilizing various thaumaturgical processes. There was confirmation of no harmful cognitohazardous or memetic agents being present in the simulations, as per protocol. It was then approved for use as a way to draft more accurate response procedures to various End of the World scenarios. It has been estimated that SCP-8065 has a 98% accuracy rate[[footnote]] 2% inaccuracy is in regards to inaction of SCP Foundation or other Groups of Interest when not noted in simulation. [[/footnote]] in regard to the events of the simulation. Accuracy of the simulation does not correlate with the likelihood of the event happening.[[footnote]] See Addendum 8065.1 for further information.

To avoid major panic, Foundation plants in the media industry begin to disseminate the misinformation that the asteroid is due to pass safely past Earth instead, utilizing data provided by the Department of Astronomy. The simulation seems to disclude uneventful years toward the simulation's event, the next major event occurring on April 11th of 2029.\n> **Notes:** Simulated documents below.\n _\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Asteroid Destruction Briefing**\n**Date: 4/11/2029, two days to impact**\n----\n**[00:10]:** 225 space-faring, high power missiles from 15 countries were released to push Apophis off of a crash course with Earth.\n\n**[00:50]:** The first missile was calculated to have hit the meteor. There is no confirmation of it having hit.\n\n**[1:21]:** The final missile was noted to not have a confirmed hit, observational units on Lunar Area-32 are called to action.\n\n**[1:33]:** Observational units confirm that all missiles had missed their target. A comment is made that most of the missiles were still directly on course with the asteroid, akin to passing through it.\n\n**[1:54]:** Possibility of some kind of anomaly being present is studied by Lunar Area-32 staff by launching small scale missiles.\n\n**[2:16]:** First confirmed recording of the anomaly occurring.

Database updated to show its likely probabilistic nature.\n\n**[4:00]:** Attempts to contain SCP-8065 seem to be met by mistakes on the part of the experiments. Notable failures include mistyped coordinates, device failure, and a containment breach. Theorized to be an effect of the probabilistic anomaly.\n\n**[5:00]:** Emergency convening of the O5 Council.\n\n**Proposed Solution:** Reclassify SCP-8065 to Apollyon, try to mitigate damage that impact will cause before 00:00 of 4/12.\n\n----\n\n**OVERSEER VOTE**\nYEA: O5-1, O5-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-6, O5-7, O5-8, O5-9, O5-10, O5-11, O5-12, O5-13\nNAY: N/A\nABSTAIN: N/A\nNotes from O5-1: All necessary measures must be taken.

[[/footnote]]. The instances quickly reproduce and spread from Syracuse into the wilds of New York. SCP-3683 instances quickly begin diversifying and adapting to their new environment, breeding with various other bird species to increase their own ability. They quickly take to breeding with birds of prey, allowing the new instances to properly fight against the now overworked Gamma-119. They began using their talons and sharp beaks in tandem with diving and tossing heavier rocks at high speeds to kill or heavily injure the personnel of Gamma-119.\n> **Response:** A successful response plan to this would require that MTF Gamma-119 is properly maintained, funded, and staffed. The current response plan is to ensure that Gamma-119 is never to be left in a state where it is functioning with less than fifty men. They are also to be supplied with proper equipment to test the intelligence of any captured instances, to ensure they are not improving in intelligence and problem-solving ability.\n> **Notes:** Attached documents below.\n _\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Captain Frank Rodriguez of Gamma-119\n \n**Interviewer:** Doctor Lilyann Sophia\n \n**Foreword:** Regarding the Large-Scale Containment Breach of SCP-3683\n \n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Sophia:** So how did it begin?\n \n**Capt.
