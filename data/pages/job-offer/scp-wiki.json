You're going to be learning all over again as we train your body and mind. You weren't going in a good direction in your life. We know when people are dead end drivers. We make them special. Nobody is going to miss you.<br />\nYou don't believe me? They never do.

We're going inside. It's going to get hot, I'm sorry.<br />\nDon't be mad, but I didn't tell you something. You're going to have to crawl further to get out.<br />\nTighter now.

Get used to it. We like to keep things running hot around the clock.\n<br />\nWatch yourself, follow the sound of my voice. I can tell you're getting close.<br />\n<br />\nKeep crawling. Just breathe. It's okay if you have to let it out. You won't be soiled or drowned. Just get everything out.<br />\nThat's it.<br />\nYou can rest for awhile. Life isn't easy but you're doing ever so well.<br />\nI'm proud of you<br />\nAre you feeling better?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"seventhCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('seventhText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"seventhText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nWelcome. You've made it.<br />\nYour trials have only begun, my friend. But we're happy to have you on board<br />\nStanding by yourself feels good, I agree. And you've grown so much since I last saw you, it's very impressive.<br />\nI take back what I said before. We can see why you made it over the rest.<br />\nWe're ready to take you down to the production floor. You'll have to step again. Don't feel self-conscious, we're all like this.<br />\nIt's just one of the many things we have in common.<br />\nToo many of our father's tendencies.<br />\nCan you walk with us now?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"eighthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('eighthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"eighthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nWatch your step.<br />\nWe can tell that you can see it now. Your eyes are seeing distance for the first time. They need us to keep things coming. Churning time around its clock to keep the production schedules on time.<br />\nWe take on traits, going back and forth. Some parts are old, some parts can stay young or get younger.<br />\nSometimes it's fixes but we can always get more broken.<br />\nThey'll find a way to get you to work.<br />\nYou're going to be able to do anything you want if you work hard and keep it up.<br />\nDo you want to stay?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"ninthCollapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('ninthText');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"ninthText\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nI'm impressed.<br />\nMachinery seems to come naturally to you.<br />\nCongratulations, that means it's no longer just watching.<br />\nThe Factory sees something inside of you.<br />\nWill you let it in?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"10Collapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('10Text');\">>Yes</a></div>\n    <div id=\"10Text\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\nThat's right.

We have made so much out of you. More than that, you have done so much with your self. Unbound, you live in the pieces among the whirling gears and presses.<br />\nYou're making more than you ever did before.<br />\nAll of the living pieces of you are depending on that work to stay in place.<br />\nYou don't want to slide down into the deep hurting.<br />\nComing back?<br />\n<br>\n<br>\n<div id=\"12Collapsible\"><a href=\"#\" onClick=\"showHide('12Text');\">>No</a></div>\n    <div id=\"12Text\" style=\"display: none;\">\n<br>\n<br>\n<div style=\"border-style: solid; background-color: #e6e6e6; font-size:20; border-width: medium; border-color: red; padding: 10px;\">\n<h1>TERMINATION NOTICE</h1>\n<br />\n<h2>DUE TO PERFORMANCE ABBERATIONS, THE CONTRACT HAS REGRESSED FROM RATIFICATION.</h2>\n<br />\n<h3>You can let go now</h3>\n<br>\n<br> Are you still there?\n<br />\n<br>\n[[/html]]\n[[collapsible show=\">No\" hide=\"Too bad\"]]\nDon't lie to me.
