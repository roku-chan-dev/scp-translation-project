SCP-6664 is not to be climbed, for fear of damaging its branches.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6664 is a tree of the species //##blue|Pinus banksiana##//, more commonly known as the ##blue|jack pine##, currently located at ##blue|Site-43##. SCP-6664 is identical to other trees of its species, save for its anomalous effects.\n\nSCP-6664's anomalous effects activate whenever ##blue|one of its cones is touched## by ##blue|fire##. When ##blue|fire makes contact with a cone from## SCP-6664, instead of ##blue|opening and dropping its seeds## as expected, ##blue|the cone will violently detonate, releasing a number of seeds not physically able to fit inside the cone at high speeds. Cones produced by SCP-6664 have## been designated SCP-6664-1.\n\nSCP-6664-1 ##blue|are the cones produced by SCP-6664##. SCP-6664-1 ##blue|contain seeds that grow anomalously fast, growing to full size in approximately 4 days. Trees produced from SCP-6664 are otherwise non-anomalous.##\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 6664.01: Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-6664 was discovered on January 28, 2014, after ##blue|Isabelle Diana##, a ##blue|local teenager##, reported ##blue|lighting sparklers near SCP-6664, and being hit with several seeds at high speed. A nearby off-duty Foundation agent saw the detonation of## SCP-6664-1 and reported it as a possible anomaly. SCP-6664 was subsequently moved to ##blue|Site-43##.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//**This file has been locked.**//\n\n//No more edits are being allowed on this page until you all can agree on something.
