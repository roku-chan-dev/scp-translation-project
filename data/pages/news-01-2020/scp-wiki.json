I highly recommend reading their work, which is available [[[t-rutherford-author-page|here.]]] Keep an eye on them heading into 2020!\n\nWoedenaz has developed a tasteful collection of themes that use impressive CSS and design skills. They are viewable [[[/woedenaz/offset/1|here.]]]\n\nAnd last but not least, here is my favorite art piece from last year:\n\n= [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-952/HighwayAsh.png style=\"width:50%\"]]\nMade by Woedenaz for uraniumempire for the 2019 Art Exchange. It's a beautiful rendition of the album in Uranium's [[[SCP-952]]]!\n-----\n++++* UraniumEmpire\n\nTsercele started off with [[[SCP-4581]]] and hit the g-ddamn ground running! Keep an eye on their hit series, [[[The Eternal MxTape]]].\n\nThe best skip of the year, in my humble opinion, was [[[SCP-4504]]]. If you've got some time, give it a read!\n-----\n++++* TheMightyMcB\nkybard showed up out of the blue and just started kicking ass and taking names! Be sure to check him out at [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kybard|his author page]]] and read all three of his skips, because they're excellent.\n\nOne of my favorite skips from 2019, and one that I find to be massively underrated, was [[[SCP-3638]]] \"You Can't Be Serious!\", by 440 Hertz. It even has a really fun collaborative art page!\n-----\n++++* gee0765\n\nI recommend [[[SCP-4338]]], [[[SCP-3272]]], [[[SCP-4368]]], and [[[SCP-4357]]].\n\nMy favorite breakout author of the year was none other than T Rutherford!\n-----\n++++* Vincent Van Gone\n\nMy favorite SCP of the year was [[[SCP-4390]]], and Tanhony really popped off this year!\n-----\n++++* Croquembouche\n\nI highly recommend you check out the End of Death subseries, [[[the-existential-maw-of-despair-national-park|Lookout 281.]]]\n-----\n++++* A Random Day\n\nMUCKSCAPE/MEGAGRID/MAYHEM series (https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/muckscape-megagrid-mayhem-hub); Maim The Sky, Slay the Sun series (https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/maim-the-sky-slay-the-sun-hub) are my picks.\n\nThere was exactly one author i can remember who wrote good-ass shit last year and his name is pedantique.\n-----\n++++* MalyceGraves\n\n[[[SCP-4140]]], [[[Breakneck]]], [[[SCP-4840]]], [[[SCP-4372]]] and the new author Hatcheye are my picks.\n-----\n++++* Elenee FishTruck\n\nSome great content got made for the International Group of Interest competition! I'd recommend you all check out the [[[sky-sermon-hub|Sky Sermon series]]], [[[non-prophet-organization-hub|A Non-Prophet Organization series]]], and [[[SCP-4775]]] and [[[SCP-4642]]] for the Meat Circus GoI!\n\nMy pick for best new author is [[[oricat-author-page|OriCat]]]. Go read some of their tales, especially, their Daevite-centric ones.\n-----\n++++* Roget\n\n[[[adoption-poster-darius| Mr. DARE]]] is the best thing produced on the SCP Wiki in 2019. Try to prove me wrong. You can’t.
