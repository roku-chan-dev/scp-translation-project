SCP-4090-3 is to be stored in an adjacent locker. Testing of SCP-4090-1 requires the permission of any Level 4 researcher. Testing involving SCP-4090-3 requires the permission of Research Director Dias.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4090 is a large Amazon brand cardboard box. When entered by a living human, the anterior opening of SCP-4090 serves as a gateway to a small extradimensional space, hereafter referred to as SCP-4090-1.\n\nSCP-4090-1 is a Martin-class[[footnote]] Used to denote small, self-containing, non-populated extradimensional spaces. (Mack Martin, //A Proposal for Pocket Dimension Classification//, 2016)[[/footnote]] extradimensional space. SCP-4090-1 is spheroid, with a radius of approximately 8 km. The majority of the space within SCP-4090-1 is an ocean, with a 0.5km^^2^^ central landmass in the exact center. No animal life is present in SCP-4090-1.\n\nSCP-4090-1 remains brightly lit despite the absence of a visible source of light. Personnel has described the colors within SCP-4090-1 as \"glowing\" and \"saturated\". The air temperature within SCP-4090-1 remains at a constant 25 degrees Celsius. No other physical differences exist between SCP-4090-1 and Earth.\n\nPersons entering SCP-4090-1 by way of SCP-4090[[footnote]] Attempts to enter SCP-4090-1 through thaumatological or other means have been unsuccessful.[[/footnote]] arrive through a stone doorway in front of a large structure resembling an ancient Greek temple, hereby designated SCP-4090-2. Attempts to date the material comprising SCP-4090-2 have been inconclusive, with results indicating the temple is anywhere between 10 and 2,000 years old.\n\nSCP-4090 is believed to have been created by POI-3055, \"zazzbery\", formerly affiliated with Gamers Against Weed, at the request of one Keegan Horner. Notably, Horner is the son of POI-958, an anarchist believed to be responsible for EE-████ and several related events. SCP-4090 was intercepted en route to its destination by Foundation employees embedded in the United States Postal Service. \n\nThe following chat logs were archived by the Foundation due to their connection with SCP-4090.\n\n> -> **horner** joined\n> **bluntfiend:** weed that lets u talk to god\n> **zazzbery:** 420 praise it\n> **bluntfiend:** exactly lmao\n> **horner:** Hey, is this where I go to ask about works?\n> **bluntfiend:** yeah\n> **bluntfiend:** are you new\n> **horner:** Yeah, and I wanted to ask about commissioning work.\n> **zazzbery:** lmao we arent DeviantArt\n> **zazzbery:** we just make shit we dont work on commission\n> **zazzbery:** ill draw your fursona if u want to\n> **horner:** I know, but I really want this very particular piece of artwork and I don't know how to get it myself.

At the time of its retrieval, SCP-4090-3 was located inside SCP-4090-1's temple on a marble pedestal. When a human subject makes physical contact with the surface of SCP-4090-3, their biological father becomes the host of an infovorous construct that consumes sensory and mnemonic information about the subject. Affected individuals are unable to be perceived or remembered by the host of the construct. The construct evaporates after approximately two weeks but can be reapplied through additional contact with SCP-4090-3. Repeated contact tends to diminish the duration of the effect until a suitable amount of time (usually two to three weeks) has passed.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nEfforts to contact POI-3055 \"zazzbery\" are ongoing.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4089]]] | SCP-4090 | [[[SCP-4091]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
