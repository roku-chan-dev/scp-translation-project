Due to the specimen's behavior, a locked door is considered to be all that is required to prevent escape. SCP-1991 is to be fed three kilograms (3 kg) of cooked and pulped beef daily. Water is to be provided via a trough which is to be kept refilled constantly. Containment cell is to be cleaned weekly by Class-D personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1991 is a two (2) meter-long quadruped mammalian creature of unknown species, enhanced by the implantation of cybernetic compounds. Both implanted compounds and creature show signs of damage consistent with extreme age, poorly-healed puncture wounds, bullets of assorted calibers embedded underneath the skin, burns comparable to those produced by industrial cutting lasers, and starvation. SCP-1991 appears to have suffered psychological damage as a result of physical abuse or trauma, displaying extreme fear of loud noises, rapid movements, and aggression or seeming aggression by personnel.\n\nSCP-1991's body core is roughly humanoid, with elongated limbs of equal length. All limbs end in \"hands\" similar to those of a large primate, apart from the presence of elongated claws. The head resembles a mummified canine skull with elongated incisor teeth. Skin resembles decayed leather with matted fur growing from it, primarily around the ankles and back of the neck. SCP-1991 lacks a tail. When recovered, SCP-1991 displayed traits of starvation, including enlarged gut and emaciated limbs. Proper feeding while in containment has been shown to cure said traits.\n\nCybernetics consist of a mechanical \"collar\", implantation of unidentified structure into right forelimb, sharpened steel blades replacing teeth and claws of forelimbs as well as [DATA EXPUNGED] system alterations of unknown usage. \"Collar\" consists of a metal disc embedded in the front of the neck, possessing a small speaker array (nonfunctional due to bullet damage), six (6) video cameras, two (2) of which have broken lenses, and a complex network of [DATA EXPUNGED] fibers apparently serving as linkage/control to its central nervous system (nonfunctional due to ██████). Due to the nonfunctional nature of linkage between its nervous system and the camera network on the \"shield\", SCP-1991 appears to be blind. The \"right forelimb structure\" consists of a pair of miniature mechanical clamps and an extending, rotary metal rod similar to the triggering equipment of remotely-operated firearms. It is assumed that the clamps were intended to serve as the mounting system for such a weapon.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-1991 Test Logs\" hide=\"-Close SCP-1991 Test Logs\"]]\n**Behavioral Test Log 1991 - 1**\nTests of SCP-1991 behavior in regards to positive stimuli.\n\n> **Supervisor:** Dr. ████████\n> **Stimulus:** Dr. ████████ saying \"hello\" in a normal and calm voice.\n> **Effect upon subject:** SCP-1991 having huddled in the furthest corner of the containment chamber upon Dr. ████████'s entry emerged and hesitantly licked Dr. ████████'s outstretched hand.\n> \n> **Supervisor:** Dr. ████████\n> **Stimulus:** SCP-1991 \"petted\" on the top of the head by Dr. ████████.\n> **Effect upon subject:** SCP-1991 emitted gurgling noise assumed to be a sign of pleasure.\n> \n> **Supervisor:** Dr. ████████\n> **Stimulus:** SCP-1991 given common canine chew toy shaped like a teddy bear.\n> **Effect upon subject:** SCP-1991 prodded toy with forepaw, causing it to squeak.
