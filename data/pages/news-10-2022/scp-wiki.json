As you might imagine, we here at the SCP Wiki love the holiday, in no small part due to our origins as a creepypasta/horror fiction site. A lot of our most memorable articles, such as [[[Treats]]] and [[[SCP-330]]], as well as various S&C Plastics series, take place on or around Halloween. And speaking of Treats, October 2022 marks the ten-year anniversary of its creation, as well as the Halloween 2012 Contest, one of three Halloween contests held on the site over the years.\n\nSo how do we plan on celebrating our favorite time of the year as well as the creation of one of the all-time highest-rated tales? With a Halloween-themed Tale contest of course! But wait, there's more! We are running a contest with two categories; Writing and Art! That's right! We wanted to celebrate the talented artists of the site who illustrate such wonderful creations for our enjoyment. This contest is also notable because it's the first Tale contest in four years! It's been too dang long in my opinion.\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/halloween-con-2022/halloweencon2022.jpg]]\n\nAuthors and artists are expected to select prompts from a selection of 9 total among both categories, with authors picking two and artists picking one to work on. To make things extra interesting, polymaths are welcome to enter both categories! That means if you want to, you can both write and create art to enter the contest.\n\nThe victors will have their creative endeavors featured on the home page for the duration of November. So let's get all get spooky and celebrate the occasion together! You can find the contest over at this url: [[[halloween-con-2022|Click me!]]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ October 18th\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ The SCP-JP 3000 Contest Is On!\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Japanese branch of the SCP Wiki was originally founded in July 2013, with an original series of 1000 articles, similar to how we over on EN do things. They held their first-ever kcon in mid-2016, a mere 3 years after being founded. The theme of this original kcon was 'Japan', a fitting theme for the language being used! Another four years later, in early 2020, the SCP-2000-JP contest was held, and this time the theme was 'transition', to symbolize the wiki's growth from a small group of authors and translators to a bigger, more mainstream organization.\n\n\n[[image http://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file%3A7662975-90-t0gu/3000JP_Kota-2_2_16_9]]\n\nAnd now, a mere 2 years later in October of 2022, the SCP-3000-JP contest has been announced! This time, the theme is a topic many wish for a kcon to be about here on EN, 'fantasy'. But not just any fantasy, the word used was specifically //\"幻想\"//. Though the word translates to 'fantasy', its literal meaning is 'illusion' , so we can probably expect some high fantasy pieces to come out of this contest. How exciting!\n\nPosting will be open December 3rd to December 19th, and the winner will be decided on the 16th January 2023.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ October 3rd\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ The 2022 Annual Survey has been Released\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/832417653435662377/1011899563361194035/CommOut.png?width=676&height=676|caption=The Community Outreach Team Logo courtesy of EstrellaYoshte|width=340px|align=left]]\n\nAs the title explains, we have released the 2022 SCP Wiki Annual Survey for people to fill out! Now, I am sure you are asking the question, \"WhiteGuard, why are we releasing the next survey already? We just received the results from the last one a month or so ago.\" That is a good question! In the past, we have always opened up the survey for submissions in the spring following the year and released their results later that summer. However, we always lagged a year behind which made things confusing. For example, the 2021 survey was opened in February of 2022, closed a few months later, and the results were announced not that long after. The entire 2021 survey took place in 2022 ... I am sure you get the idea. That is why from now on, the annual surveys will run from the beginning of October to the beginning of December. Hopefully, we will have the results by the end of the year!\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\nWith all of that said, if you wish to participate, click on the following link to submit your answers!\n\n+++ [https://forms.gle/2nvfJHDeFFmtaT3B6 SCP Wiki Annual Community Survey, 2022 Edition!]\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ October 3rd\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ The Front Page has been Given a Redesign!\n[[/=]]\n\nI trust you all have seen the front page redesign, but in case you haven't, check it out right away by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ | clicking here]]]! As its creator //Rounderhouse// put it, here is a non-exhaustive list of improvements:\n\n> * A classified banner that’s smaller (70% of the original) while still retaining the aesthetic of the original. The CLASSIFIED also links to the About the Wiki page, giving it a level of functionality beyond form.\n> * A grid-based double column layout that’s responsive on mobile.\n> * More economical use of vertical space.\n> * Almost all article features are immediately visible without scrolling, which is fairer and leads to overall more clicks on each article.\n> * Art features on a rotating slideshow that doesn’t require any raster image editing.\n> * The entire system is built on Wikidot vars, so each item can be changed from the front page itself without the need to edit the individual fragments. This lets us have a clear, centralized edit record.\n> * The vars and sections are all also clearly annotated for editors.\n> * The individual components are still set up in fragments as with the current front page, reducing the risk someone will accidentally edit and/or break the CSS.\n> * A clear, constant link to the Site News.\n> * Set up to accommodate rather than work around contest announcements; as you can see on the contest alt, during contest season the {{contest}} div can be altered to suit the contest and replace the classified banner for the duration of the con.\n> * It’s also set up to accommodate the annual survey announcements, as you can see on the contest alt.\n> * Generally a more updated, 'modern' looking visual design to the page.\n\nIt is certainly a big change, and although we expect not everyone to love it, we hope it will make it easier to showcase and provide the type of content we wish to bring forward to the community. There are bound to be fixes and updates as we go along, but this is the most substantial update the page has seen in a very long time.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By WhiteGuard//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ October 3rd\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ SCP-KO has Announced their 1000 Contest!\n[[/=]]\n\nOn January 2013, the Korean Branch of the SCP Foundation was founded by Merlin Emrys and scpfskhq. Together, they worked on drawing translators to their site and very quickly became a hub for quality Korean translations of SCP articles. Before long, there began to be original works on the site, and the first Series of the KO branch was born.\n\nToday, almost a decade later, the KO branch has finally come close to filling out all 999 SCP articles in their first Series, and as such, requires more room to grow. And thus, we come to the theme of the SCP-1000-KO contest; Growth. That's right, whether it's personal growth, the growth of a plant, or any way you want to crack open its etymology, the theme of the SCP-1000-KO contest is Growth!\n\n[[image http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp1000kocontesthub/banner_wide.jpg]]\n\nThe hub for this contest has been translated by //Fluxman// and is viewable [[[scp1000kocontesthub|here]]]. There will be translations to follow, so make sure to stay tuned for them! To all our Korean friends over at SCP-KO, we wish you all the best of luck and join you in celebrating 1000 SCP's! Here's to 1000 more!\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ October 1st\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ Follow up on SCP-RU's New Independent Wiki\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://o5command-int.wdfiles.com/local--files/tech-team:graphic-templates/scp-logo-ru-400.png|caption=SCP-RU Logo|width=340px|align=right]]\n\nSCP-RU recently announced that they are moving their assets to their new wiki, https://scpfoundation.net, which SCP-RU's Tech Team created. The project was created in collaboration between //ZZYZX// and //MrNereof//. According to these users, the new site has a lot of Wikidot functionalities, some of them being Wikidot syntax including edit and rating modules.\nThe Russian Branch actually began the project a few years before but had not succeeded in creating a site outside of Wikidot. However, two weeks before the Wikidot geo-block, the blocking of all users from Russia to access the site, the branch had already reactivated the project for the purpose of fixing bugs and security vulnerabilities that are present on Wikidot itself. Due to the geo-block restrictions, the branch made a massive development push to speed up the project since it was now considered a 'vital issue for the Russian branch.'\n\nOne of the developers, Nereof, thinks that with their new site, users can have an alternative to Wikidot, and even other branches can migrate to the new platform considering its open source. The current development of RuFoundation Engine will be focused on fixing all the [https://github.com/SCPru/RuFoundation/issues current issues] like adding forum functionalities and migration.\n\nWith the engine being based on Wikijump, and considering the current Wikijump's development speed, we have reached out to the English branch wiki administrator, aismallard, to discuss -RU's new engine and its relation with Wikijump. Asked about the difference in development speed between the two projects, with Wikijump still being under development, aismallard noted several issues that appear in Wikijump are not present in RU's project. \n\n> \"... while we have a handful of people on the team, a number of real-life issues have precluded the level of contribution originally predicted, which has made things difficult.\" ~ aismallard\n\nThe EN Administrator also mentioned -EN's tendency of producing large incidents on a semi-regular basis, requiring attention. Since these problems are rare in -RU, they do not often affect the development team there. Aismallard also wanted to have more discussion on development with -RU, in which they can share their methods and knowledge on complicated implementation issues since Wikijump has a larger-scale approach: a larger platform, localization support, etc. With a shared mindset on the subject, Nereof also believes that -RU's project will speed up the development of Wikijump, giving them some examples for future development, and benefits for users.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By StupifPotato//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Features Last Month\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Top Articles of the Month\n[[/=]]\n\nRatings of course do not mean everything, but they are representative of what people happened to like seeing at the time.
