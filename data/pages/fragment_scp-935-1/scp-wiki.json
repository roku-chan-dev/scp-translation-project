When SCP-935 breaches containment, the recontainment of the object will begin under the Bowe Protocol. The recontainment of SCP-935 will only occur with the recovery of SCP-935-1. In the case that SCP-935-1 is found dead, the --Bowe Commission-- SCP-935 Research Team will trace the subsequent SCP-935-1 subject.\n\nThe Bowe Protocol is the current method utilized by the --Bowe Commission-- Research Team, with the assistance of SCP-935-1. The subjects of SCP-935 are assisted with the decommissioning of SCP-935 and, in the case of failure, the body of the subject will be returned to the family with a coverup story for their death.\n\n**Description:** SCP-935 is a box of playing cards dating back to eighteenth-century Brandenburg, Germany. Physically, the cards are in a worn but playable condition. Inside the box, the top card reads: “Sins of the father, crimes of the son. For the cheating committed centuries ago, you and your descendants will suffer the consequences of your ancestors.\"\n\nSCP-935 affects the Bowe family, and all members that are selected by the object are classified as SCP-935-1. When the subject reaches 41 years of age, 935 will teleport into the possession of the subject; before both the subject and 935 disappear. The time of disappearance is unknown, but it is estimated that it lasts to the corresponding card game. Recovery of the subject alive has failed thus far.\n\nOnce SCP-935-1 is in possession of SCP-935, the top card will show the instructions of the specific card game that will be played. Besides the instructions, SCP-935 will give two warnings to the subject: not to cheat during the game and not to lose against it. Failure to follow these rules will result in the death of SCP-935-1.[[footnote]] The subjects deaths include examples such as: brain death, heart failure, blood loss, asphyxiation, as well as other unknown causes. [[/footnote]] When the game begins, SCP-935 will move on its own according to the development of the card game. When the game finishes, SCP-935 will return to its inactive state and wait for the next subject, repeating the process.\n\n**Addendum 935.1:** Discovery\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-peppo\n|name=AdrianBoweVonBraun.jpg\n|caption=Colonel Adrian Bowe and Dr. Wernher von Braun discussing the test of the ballistic missile (1956).\n|width=290px\n]]\n\nSCP-935 was discovered after the death of Colonel Adrian Bowe while supervising a Foundation ballistic missile test on 03/02/1956.[[footnote]] At the time, Colonel Adrian Bowe was acting as the Pentagram Liaison and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unusual-incidents-unit-hub Unusual Incidents Unit] Observer for Site-150.

When you find my body, you'll find an old box of cards near me: that box is the cause.\n\nI'm not the only who's died like this: your dad, Oliver; my ma', Abigail.

For the last eighteen years, I've kept it in secret from our family, because your father asked me to.\n\nSupposedly, these cards have some sort of curse, something to do with \"cheating\".

I only ask for two favors: one, take care of my wife Sarah, as well as Little Oliver and Janey. I couldn't bare losing them like this. Second, make sure you destroy this shit. Make it pay for what it has done to our family, and what it will do if you let it.\n\nBest of luck, prick.\n\nSemper fidelis,\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Mrs Saint Delafield', cursive; font-size: 2em;\"]]@@Adrian Rye B.@@[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 935.2:** Relevant subjects of SCP-935\n\nFrom the containment of SCP-935 on 03/02/1956 to the death of General Stan Bowe on 09/07/1970, the General was the Head Researcher of SCP-935 as well as the Director of the Bowe Commission. During these fourteen years, the General dedicated his life to the recovery of historical documents of the Bowe family in order to assist in the termination of SCP-935. Between 1956 and 1970, seventeen members of the family died because of the object.\n\nHowever, little progress was achieved in the termination of the anomaly, the mitigation of its anomalous capabilities, or its origin. However, General Stan Bowe and the Bowe Commission compiled the most relevant subjects terminated by SCP-935.

It saddens me that you cannot visit your mother in her last days, but more so what will happen next. That's why I've made sure that this letter reaches you, as well as our [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7377 family's property]. While this may be incredibly valuable in this earthly world, it cannot be compared to the Kingdom's glory and the great gift of life given to us. That's why it saddens me because our gift of life does not belong to us anymore. From your father's side, at least.\n\nI'm currently 71. I've lived a long life, I married your father late in life, after becoming a widow. It was strange to me as to why he married an older woman, but now I know: I was an experiment, to see if I could survive the curse that plagues us. He died early, and I only lived because I was given mercy from the wrath of our Lord. The source of this punishment comes from this box of cards, which will be with this letter.\n\nThe box is the reason for your father's death. And while I shouldn't have gone against our Father's wrath, I'm your mother. I'm supposed to protect and I hope that God can forgive me for what I did: after asking for help from our bishop and being unable to stop it, I asked for the help of occultists to decipher the why of our Lord's punishment. They failed as I should've known and soon, I caught this disease that I suffer. This is another punishment, one that I cannot stop, and one that I will die knowing I have sentenced my children to. I'm sorry, my child.\n\nMaybe one day we will stop this curse, and receive the forgiveness of our Father. But that will only happen if we redeem ourselves. From what? I wish I knew. But what I want you to know, Henry, is that I want you to be the next patriarch of the family. You're one of the few remaining elders of our blood, and you're the only one I can trust with the task of our blood's survival. Continue our tradition: early marriages with elder families, and many children. That's the only way our family will be saved.\n\nI wish I could've seen you one last time on this Earth, but maybe we will meet again in Heaven if God allows it.\n\nYour ill mother,\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Mrs Saint Delafield', cursive; font-size: 2em;\"]]@@Sally L.

I know you advised me not to trespass protocol, but I'm the Director of the Initiative,[[footnote]] This is referring to the American Secure Containment Initiative, a paranormal agency under the jurisdiction of the United States government and a predecessor to the Foundation. Brigadier General Henry Bowe was the director from 1881 to 1888. [[/footnote]] so I can do whatever I want. You wanted to exploit the recent revival of magic, thaumaturgy, or whatever the fuck you people call it nowadays. The problem is that I was running out of time, //you// were running out of time, and our family was running out of time.\n\nWhen I stepped to Window Rock, the memories of the war passed through my eyes. Even when we gave them land, they fought for more -- they just couldn't stay where we told them to stay. I saw one or two people that I captured before, and the word of my arrival quickly spread. Short enough, I was greeted by the leader of the largest clan and I ordered him to bring me to his healer. I knew that he was insulted by my presence, but he followed my orders.\n\nWhen I met the shaman, I explained the situation. He listened carefully and begrudgingly accepted my order. He had the help of some assistants and performed a ritual that lasted for who knows how long. He asked me  if our family was guilty, and I returned with a question: whose family isn't? He didn't like my answer, but he continued. By the time the sun had set, he answered: the cards are not a divine punishment like our mother believed. The shaman said that these cards hold a vengeful spirit and that it emanated a burning hatred toward me. He confirmed that it was a punishment, but he didn't know of what.\n\nI assumed that was the case, and I asked if he could do anything to purge this spirit: he told me he could. I ordered him to do so, and he denied my request. I reached for my bag and tossed him a dozen dollars, so he could buy food in the nearest base. He didn't take it, so I stood up and left -- they could've helped me, but they decided not to.\n\nSo next week, after approval from President Arthur, I sent the Cavalry and ordered them to pick up the shaman, his assistants, and their families. Like a few years ago, I ordered my men to take them for a long walk. When the shaman decided to not help our family, to pursue revenge for what I did, they dug their own grave. Lately, I've heard stories, that their [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2750 spirits now roam the land]. In a way, they remind me of us: dead spirits seeking revenge for what happened to them.\n\nWilliam, just like I did to those Indians, I want you to do the same to those cards: an eye for an eye.

I don't have much time left to continue my research and neutralize our family's curse.

I wish I could turn back time, to stop this curse from ever happening, and return to grow old and watch you two become men. But there's no point in regrets now, and all that's left is to pray that I win this sick game.\n\nIn the case I don't, I ask you, please finish my work -- our family's work. You'll receive everything you need to know along with this letter. I found almost nothing new with one exception: when the cards kill us, it leaves a message. I've compiled these messages in my notes and you can see them for yourself. I didn't want to believe it at first, but I can't deny the evidence: it seems it has faith in us. Each time that it leaves a message, it reads as if it were disappointed in us. And it has done so every time I've found one of our family members dead.\n\nIt wants us to play fairly, but we've either lost the game or cheated. The strategies we have used so far have failed, and we must change in order to win. Now that I know this, I must test this theory. I hope I live to tell you because I can't bear leaving without you knowing this. Cross your fingers, Adrian.\n\nMy boy, promise me that if I die, you'll take care of your cousin. I'll die for both of you if I have to, but I wouldn't be at peace if he also went through what I will. Forgive me, my boy, for putting this weight on your shoulders -- but we must save ourselves because we only have our family.\n\nI don't know what these cards think we're guilty of, I just know we are, and I'm sorry I couldn't redeem ourselves. These are my last words to you, so please keep them close to your heart: I love you, and Stan.

During his disappearance, a secret operation was carried out by Bowe Commission personnel closely related to SCP-935-1 to aid in the neutralization of the anomaly, by utilizing luck and probability-related SCP objects to increase the game in favor of SCP-935-1.\n\nThe breach of these objects suddenly shifted the localized probabilistic field, causing the operation to devolve into a containment breach. Despite the loss of control by the Bowe Commission personnel, the anomalies were delivered in time to the location of SCP-935-1 in Site-19. However, the anomalies did not aid in the neutralization of SCP-935 and after the recontainment of breached anomalies, the involved Bowe Commission personnel were captured with the exception of SCP-935-1.\n\nSCP-935-1 was not neutralized by the anomaly, but shot himself when surrounded by site security.
