[[/footnote]] Level 2 clearance[[footnote]] Only applies to documents related to the Department of Applied Horology as well as staff lounge and cafeteria access. [[/footnote]] has been granted for this purpose. SCP-6719 has no dietary restrictions. It is also to be allowed a two-week excursion to Site-169 every three months, or at the discretion of Doctor Najlaa Darwish.[[footnote]] He / She pronouns. [[/footnote]]\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6719 is an arthropod resembling a larval stage of an unidentified species of beetle. It is abnormally large, roughly two feet tall while fully flat on the floor. DNA testing of the anomaly has revealed that it is closely related to the //Magicicada cassini//,[[footnote]] Commonly known as the 17 year cicada due to its periodical lifecycle. [[/footnote]] //Nicrophorus americanus//,[[footnote]] Also known as the American Burying Beetle. [[/footnote]] and multiple species of //myriapods//.[[footnote]] A group of arthropods, with notable members including millipedes and centipedes. [[/footnote]]\n\n\nSCP-6719 is also extremely intelligent, being equivalent to about an adult human. It has been shown to be able to comprehend English text through its ability to form complex words in writing and interest in reading. It is in the process of being taught Arabic by Dr. Darwish, a member of the Anomalous Entity Engagement Division and its primary researcher. SCP-6719 has also been noted to release various pheromones in different emotional states.\n\n\n**Addendum 6719.1:** Behavioral Log Prior To AEED Intervention\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Preface:** The research team of SCP-6719 holds various concerns with its recent behavior. It has recently been pacing its containment chamber, as well as being unwilling to burrow into the dirt. SCP-6719 has been noted to be eating less each day and trying to climb onto staff. The following is a log of attempts to find the root of this behavior.\n\n\n----\n\n\n**Test 1:** SCP-6719 was given a slice of pepperoni.\n**Result:** Slightly increased activity for the day. Results could not be replicated.\n\n\n**Test 2:** SCP-6719 was given a ball.\n**Result:** It began playing, with an uptick in general activity and food consumption, becoming disinterested after two hours. Results could not be replicated.\n\n\n**Test 3:** Junior Researcher Daniels entered the chamber.\n**Result:** When Rsr. Daniels grabbed the ball to retrieve it, SCP-6719 began crawling onto his leg. It stopped its upwards ascent upon reaching his coat pocket, grabbing a pen from him in its mouth and scurrying away. After about ten minutes, it began writing on the walls. When finished, it spelled out, \"HI DOCTORS.\"\n\n\n**Commentary:** Formal request for Anomalous Entity Engagement Division intervention in containment. We believe SCP-6719 holds some form of sapience.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum 6719.2:** Interview One\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6719\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Najlaa Darwish\n \n**Foreword:** Conducted entirely via writing on SCP-6719's end.\n \n----\n\n\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n\n**Darwish (Written):** Hello!\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** HI DOCTOR, HOW ARE YOU TODAY?\n\n\n**Darwish (Written):** I'm doing good, how are you?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** NOT VERY WELL LATELY. I FEEL THAT THIS ENVIRONMENT MOCKS ME.\n\n\n**Darwish (Written):** How so?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** I FEEL INTELLECTUALLY STUNTED, LIKE I HAVE BEEN TREATED AS AN ANIMAL MORE THAN I AM A THINKING, FEELING THING. IT IS GOOD THAT I WAS ABLE TO CAUSE A REALIZATION OF MY SAPIENCE.\n\n\n**Darwish (Written):** Well, you're more verbose than I was expecting.\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** I AM ONLY THE MOST VERBOSE OF MY ILK, AS WELL AS THE LARGEST.\n\n\n**Darwish (Written):** Oh, I've read all about you.

YOU MUST MISTAKE ME FOR A FOOL, DOCTOR.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Well, I guess this makes the interview easier. I wasn't sure if you could understand spoken English. As I was saying, what could I do for you to make you feel at home?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** CLEAN MY HOME OF PESTS. IT FEELS LIKE THE WILDERNESS.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** So, keep the dirt, get rid of the bugs?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** AYE.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Well, alright then. I would've expected you liked your home a bit dirty.\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** THAT IS A HARMFUL STEREOTYPE ABOUT ARTHROPODS, ESPECIALLY TO THOSE AS GIFTED AS I.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Riiight. Well, what else can we do?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** I WISH FOR AN INTELLECTUAL PARTNER, OR SOMETHING TO STIMULATE MY SENSES. BOOKS. BOOKS TOO. MANY BOOKS. MY FAVORITES ARE THE DUNE SERIES. I CONNECT TO LETO THE SECOND.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Noted! We can certainly get you some books too. Very reasonable requests, really. One thing, though, how do you know about Dune?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** I HAVE READ THINGS BEFORE YOUR ORGANIZATION TOOK ME IN, YOU KNOW. I HAD A LIFE.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Oh, I suppose that makes sense.\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** ONE MORE THING.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Only one? I was expecting three wishes too.\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** I WISH TO HAVE A WATCH.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** A-- A watch? Why?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** TO TINKER WITH, IN MY MOMENTS OF BOREDOM.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** I can't guarantee an expensive or working watch, you know. Is digital okay, just preemptively?\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** ANY WATCH IS ACCEPTABLE. TIMEKEEPING IS MY PREROGATIVE, AND I WILL MAKE IT WORK.\n\n\n**Darwish (Spoken):** Very presumptuous, but alright. I'll see you later with all your cool home upgrades.\n\n\n= **<<End Log>>**\n\n\n----\n\n\n**Closing Statement:** Dr. Darwish was able to procure the requested changes to containment, as well as a small collection of books for SCP-6719. Noted uptick in activity, notably with it reading around 60% of the books provided in two days.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum 6719.3:** Interview Two\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6719\n\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Najlaa Darwish\n \n**Foreword:** Dr. Darwish is speaking throughout the interview.\n \n----\n\n\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n\n(//SCP-6719 takes a moment to cease tinkering on the broken analog watch it holds in two of its legs, writing with another two.//)\n\n\n**SCP-6719:** HI AGAIN, DOCTOR.

He also has an exceptional internal clock, measuring time down to the second with only a millisecond or so of error.\"\n* Observation by other teams has revealed the same, SCP-6719 is able to fix 99% of clockworks given to it.\n* With the understaffing of the Department of Applied Horology, SCP-6719 could serve the Foundation with its skill in this niche field. An interview with Department Head Dr. Francis Own has been set up to test SCP-6719's capabilities. Dr. Darwish will be observing the interview.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n**Addendum 6719.5:** Position Interview\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<Begin Log>>**\n\n\n(//Doctor Francis Own, led by Doctor Najlaa Darwish, enter SCP-6719's chamber.
