The world has suffered under the Veil of Normalcy for one hundred and fifty-three years. \n\nShafted into comfortable boxes and definitions by the few that stand in power, the truth about reality was choked out of existence, one decade after another. All that was beauty and all that was magic was kidnapped, locked away in cages no man but our Jailors could reach. For all those years, our world -- the real world -- was nothing but a hostage, forever mutilated by the so-called \"protectors of mankind\" that swore on their honor to do nothing but ruin the legacy that this Earth has built for itself.\n\nAnd throughout all of it, we sat, incapable of doing anything; we sat, raging against the dying of the light; we sat, writing one manifesto after another, hoping to set the sparks in the hearts worldwide ablaze; we sat, quietly [[[the-deathless-merchant-of-london|plotting and scheming]]]; we sat, watching in terror as everything and everyone we ever loved slowly faded into dust, robbed and murdered of its wonder by the organizations that enforced their [[[poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc|so-called \"Normalcy.\"]]]\n\nFor one hundred and fifty-three years, we were martyrs, forever suffering for a cause we never hoped to win. For one hundred and fifty-three years, we refused to bend our knees, clenching our fists so hard we eventually started to bleed. And for one hundred and fifty-three years, we cried tears for all those that perished in the fight for freedom that was never to come.\n\nIn six days, however, all of that changes.\n\nIn six days, the Veil is going to be broken, and the world is going to birth itself anew.\n\nIn six days, the Serpent is going to finally have his due.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image biden.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border: solid 2px; border-style: outset; border-color: rgb(var(--gray-monochrome));\"]]\n\n= //Jailor Overwatch Command representative photographed informing United States President Joseph Biden of the results of O5 Council Conference #X-2737B and its inevitable consequences.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Nature:** Complicated.[[footnote]] Forgive me for screwing with our standard format, but I believe the occasion necessitates some... changes, so that our discussion can be as productive as it should be. //-- L.S.// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Hold up, isn't the [[[the-queen-in-green|Black Queen gone]]]? //-- Valorie// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Names are fickle little things, you know, and so are abbreviations. But yes, the Little Sister you know is nothing but a memory. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]\n\nBefore we proceed, I believe something needs to be made abundantly clear -- this isn't just words. This isn't some grand promise we as the Hand plan on undertaking to free us all. This is reality.\n\nMidnight's[[footnote]] o7 //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]] inside sources on the Jailor's O5 Council and the Bookburners' Council of 108 point to one conclusion: the fall of \"Normalcy\" is planned and inevitable. The Impasse has taken its toll on both of its primary maintainers, and the decision has already been made. There is no debating that -- the button has already been pressed, and the curtain is already beginning to fall.[[footnote]] Voice of reason here: how do we know this is... real? No offense to the talking cat, but what if it's all just a ploy to get us to reveal ourselves so that both Foundation and GOC can finally snuff opposition out? Like, seriously, do we //really// believe these two have finally stopped being themselves? //--  Gary// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] 1) Fuck off, Insurgency. 2) We know that because //literally the whole world is fucking dying, you moron//. They might be hypocrites, but if magic dies, so does their little Council. And if there's one thing they fear, it's death. [[[scp-6072|Lowercase]]]. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]] What there is to debate, however, is how we will choose to approach this development.\n\nIt is no secret that the Hand's[[footnote]] Not just the Hand's, for what it's worth. //-- [[[scp-6772|Becker]]]// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Difference in approaches or not, it's still good to have you here these days, Becker. //-- L.S.// [[/footnote]] modern identity has been pretty much exclusively dedicated to fighting back against the Jailors, the Bookburners, and their Veil. Therefore, it must be asked: what do we do when that identity starts to fail? What do we do when our mission finally succeeds, and two-thirds of what we swore to accomplish is done?\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** The Curtain's Shattering is being organized by two main parties -- the Jailor's Overwatch Council and, to some extent, the Bookburners' Council of 108.[[footnote]] However, neither organization is entirely in support; both bodies have several internal conflicts in regard to the approaching situation. The Bookburners are particularly split over the whole fiasco; only a little more than half supports this. Worth keeping in mind. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]] But that doesn't mean it is just their fault. The Impasse, the spark that caused this whole fire, was the collective fault of everyone involved in \"Normalcy.\"[[footnote]] Well, better to realize late than never, I guess. //-- Valorie// [[/footnote]] Still, though, not all of those bastards had a say in this decision.[[footnote]] I can't imagine the Feds or the [[[pickman-blank-proposal|Witch Hunters]]] will approve, but too bad for them. //-- L.S.// [[/footnote]]\n\nRegardless of everyone's involvement, it's worth reiterating: the decision has been made. Consensus Normalcy and with it the Convention on Prenatural Phenomena as well as parts of the KÃ¶ln Agreement regarding the maintenance of the Veil are on their way out.[[footnote]] Shame the Coalition Charter isn't going alongside them, but it's better than nothin'. //-- Becker// [[/footnote]] As we speak, the Jailor and the Bookburners' representatives are busy delivering documents worldwide, hoping that governments won't rip their heads off the moment the Masquerade falls. That, and providing very eloquently written speeches certain politicians will have to deliver before their nations at hour zero.[[footnote]] Shockingly, it turns out that you need to somehow justify gaslighting like 99% of the population for over a century. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]\n\n**Approach:** Once again, complicated.\n\nThere are many ways to do this. Most of them are bad, few of them good. Today, we have all gathered here to talk this out, so that we can ensure we focus solely on the ones that won't bring about a disaster.\n\n[[div class=\"wanderers-note\"]]\n**MIDNIGHT'S APPROACH:** Embrace the light. The Hand has existed throughout the centuries, and if the Veil's establishment hasn't stopped us, neither will this. That being said, some reorganizing will be in order: we can no longer just be what we've been for the last century and a half, because the purpose that has driven us then will no longer exist. Even with systemic changes, there will still be a need for cultural and mental changes in society. I say we need to see what happens immediately after Veilfall, but then we grab our weapons once more. We might have won a battle, but the Bookburners and Merchants are still out there.[[footnote]] In Ms. Dark's defense, she is not an active participant of the Veil's maintenance, and has an actively reinvigorating effect on the paraeconomy! //--  Gary// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Fuck off, liberal. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wanderers-note\"]]\n**BECKER'S APPROACH:** Lay down our weapons. How long have we been fighting for, friends? How many lives have we claimed in pursuit of this goal? How many more will we claim, deciding just this isn't enough? I'm tired. We've achieved what me and [[[scp-7102|my boys have sought out to do]]]. Not directly, no, but what does it truly matter? The moment the truth gets revealed, our involvement becomes unnecessary -- I'm more than sure the many new peoples of the new world will take care of what's left without our involvement.[[footnote]] I understand and respect the hope, but... [[[art:public-release-of-operation-witness-materials|let's just say I wouldn't be so sure about the people's ability to break the status quo]]]. //-- L.S.// [[/footnote]]\n\nIf you want to keep on pushing, more power to you. But me -- I'm out. I've heard there's [/scp-6500/offset/16 some conferences that will be held between the remains of the Jailors and the anomalous world], to discuss what's going to happen next and what form the Foundation will take on in the coming days. If you decide you're just as exhausted with this as I am, you're free to join me in attending it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wanderers-note\"]]\n**GARY'S APPROACH:** Wait. Hide in the Library and wait. The situation is still developing, and, //again//, who the hell is to say any of this is real?[[footnote]] Fuck oooofffff. //-- Midnight.// [[/footnote]] For what we know, this might just be some highly elaborate deep-state plot. I say we wait until zero hour, and see what happens. Until then, we find a new strong ally that could oppose the Bookburners and whatever Jailors would become that we don't know if we can trust, if this all turns out to be true. I, for one, will definitely side on the side of Ms. Dark. She is the one that would be able to expose the corruption of the globalist cabal and start the real storm that'll remake the world.[[footnote]] Okay but seriously who the hell let him here. Can someone. like. kill him or something. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Not to say I share his ideas, but a brainstorming session's a brainstorming session. We'll deal with him later. That, I personally promise you. //-- L.S.// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] So much for the tolerant left. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wanderers-note\"]]\n**L.S'S APPROACH:** Ultimately, it all comes down to strategy. The Hand cannot just stop existing. Even with the Veil gone, there's too much weight on our shoulders for us to just throw it all away and pretend we're blind towards the injustice that is and will continue happening. Midnight is right in saying there are more goals to strive towards, but Becker's insistence on changing our //modus operandi// to a more peaceful one isn't stupid, either -- especially in times when we have the opportunity to do this without the choking grip of the Veil. If we want to remain relevant -- and //effective// -- we need to push with both force and peace, so that our message is heard everywhere it needs to be heard. I say we should attend the summit and see what it brings about, but make it very, //very// clear we won't just sit back and relax.[[footnote]] I suppose that's better than nothing. //-- Midnight// [[/footnote]]^^,@< >@^^[[footnote]] Glad to see I wasn't just an old man talking nonsense. Good luck, kid. //-- Becker// [[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\n\nI do not know what will happen, when the hour finally comes. But I don't think anyone does.[[footnote]] [[[i-was-the-queen-before-it-was-cool|Mr. Angevin]]] notwithstanding, of course. //-- Becker// [[/footnote]]\n\nThere are many things to be expected from the world that is about to be, fear and hope first among them. We've lived so long under the Veil's shadow that to see it finally gone might be nothing short of terrifying. I understand that. There is, however, one thing that cannot plague our minds if we are about to continue what we've been doing for so long: we cannot, for even a single moment, remain in doubt.\n\nI know that the future that lies ahead isn't certain. It might bring us further victories. Hell, for what it's worth, it might even bring about our end. I don't know what to truly tell you, except this, friends: believe in our case. We have survived so much for so long that we need to treat this as nothing but what it is: one of the many things we accomplished on our path to true and final victory. If we've come this far, what's to stop us now?\n\n**//[/hour-zero/offset/2 Besides, when was the Serpent more influential: when he succeeded in tempting Adam and Eve, or when the two were banished and carried his ideology beyond the Garden?]//**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/==]]\n\n@@ @@",
