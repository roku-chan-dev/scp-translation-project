Roufhous:** Luck, what's up?\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** Well, we haven't exactly observed it doing... anything for like a week or two, now.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** And now it concerns me; what do you mean?\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** We just haven't seen anything from it, like at all. Haven't had anything to misinform the public about, haven't had someone fall down an \"unlucky\" set of stairs, nada.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** It could just be nothing? Let's just keep monitoring for now. If nothing happens for a week, come back here, and let's set up a test.\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** Okay.\n\n**Dir.

Roufhous:** Still nothing?\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** Nothing that we could pick up on, no.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I see. One moment, please.\n\n= //Director Roufhous interacts with their terminal, before turning back to Doctor Fallen//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Right. We're going to need one... two D-Class, a gun that almost always jams, a handheld mirror, and some totems to 7101, you'll find those in storage locker 112 of Wing-T-2; it's labeled 7101, you can't miss it. And meet me in Testing Chamber D-4 in twenty minutes.\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** What gun that always jams?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** We need a gun that almost always fucks up when firing. Something that might not fire at all. You have twenty minutes, go!\n\n= //Recording is cut and then resumed within Testing Chamber D-4 24 minutes later.

Now, lemme see the goods.\n\n= //Doctor Fallen proceeds to hand Director Roufhous 2 severed rabbit paws, a mirror, and an M1 Garand//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** A Garand?! We have a Garand in the armory?\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** I just picked whatever looked unreliable. I don't know.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Did you get the proper ammunition for it?\n\n**Dr. Fallen:** I think so, here.\n\n= //Doctor Fallen hands them 6 bullets//\n\n**Dir.
