This was even the first //idea// I had for a skip. It started as Mr. Miyagi the skip and ended up as the same. O-49 was based on the Japanese Oni, while Kuro is a Karasutengu. \n\nThis went through an absolute //boatload// of rewrites, and it was while I was rewriting the journal for the third time that the idea of the Yokai Hunters came to me. This was the foundation of all my work here, and it will continue to remain as such. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[SCP-7567]]] -- The Place Where A Lone Dreamer Once Ruled.**\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7567\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nWhile not my second, third, or even fourth idea, this was still fun to write. The inspiration for this one came from a mixture of wanting to use Kuro from the previous entry and a yokai called nobiagari[[footnote]]A living bamboo that uses its height to tower over people. When they look up at it, it attacks their throat.[[/footnote]]. I also wanted to expand on the hunters some more and give them a place to run out of.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[SCP-7568]]] -- The Desire of a Dead Woman.**\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7568\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nOh, boi, this one. I had no idea what the skip for this would be until after I wrote the story, but here we are. The inspiration behind the skip is a yokai known as Hone onna. It's the corpse of a woman that keeps returning to her home every night out of love for her husband. The husband doesn't suspect anything, as his own love blinds him. In the legends, only those unclouded by love or with strong religious faith were able to see its true form. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[SCP-7569]]] -- River Children**\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7569\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nThis is probably the truest to legend skip I've written. The yokai featured in this one is the Kappa, a reptilian, childlike race of creatures. I randomly got the idea for this while attempting a tale, so clearly, the tale didn't happen. \n\nI wanted to try a more character-focused piece here and really start digging into Hyuse's personality when playing off other Foundation staff who don't constantly live with skips.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[SCP-8029]]] -- The Thousand-Year-Old Island That Got Up And Disappeared.**\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8029\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nThis time around, we have a giant ray yokai called akeai. They were often mistaken for islands by sailors.\n\nFor something started in October 2022[[footnote]]And the year and a half break.[[/footnote]] And finished during the April 2024 [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deer-college-spring-cleaning-event#side-bar Spring Cleaning Event], I think it turned out alright!\n\nThis was one of those times I learned about something and just //wanted// to write about it. It didn't matter that I had to completely rework the story like six times. I was going to do it, and I eventually did!\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Hunter Formats]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[Yokai Hunter's Document- OS-1]]]**\n[[module ListPages name=\"yokai-hunter-s-document-os-1\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nA start for a new Goi Format. It took a while to get this sorted, but hopefully, it does its job. And another entry for the Yokai Hunters? \n\nKatsuyori makes a return from SCP-6932, and promptly dies. Piku is a cute fucker based on the Osaki yokai. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[Site-250's First Halloween]]]**\n[[module ListPages name=\"Site-250's First Halloween\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nMy first ever tale, and my entry into Halloween con 2022. Something I had far too much fun writing. Somehow it's wholesome?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[Into the Motoverse]]]**\n[[module ListPages name=\"Into the Motoverse\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nAnother tale? This one started as a skip but I figured this worked better. This came about due to a nice little glitch on IRC and turned into this. Hope y'all enjoyed. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[[[When a Hungry Ghost Brings us to Our Next Adventure]]]**\n[[module ListPages name=\"When a Hungry Ghost Brings us to Our Next Adventure\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nOh boi. Here we have a rewrite of a failed skip. The sequel to SCP-7569. \n\nIn today's episode, we have, Shiko trying her best, Anders being a bro and one very hungry ghost. The ghost is a yokai called Gaki, a hungry ghost cursed to eternally wander in search of food but never being able to fill its belly. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/into-the-motoverse-2-electric-boogaloo Into the Motoverse 2: Electric Boogaloo]**\n[[module ListPages name=\"Into the Motoverse 2- Electric Boogaloo\"]]\n**[##purple|+%%rating%%##]** (##grey|%%comments%% comments##)\n[[/module]]\n\nAnother entry into the Motoverse.
