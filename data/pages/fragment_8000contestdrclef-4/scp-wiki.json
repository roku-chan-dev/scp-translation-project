KTE-8888 is sapient, sentient, and possesses high-level thaumaturgical abilities. General technology level is rated at **TanGenT++.**\n\nPhysiology differs from our own on several points, including fluorine-based hemoglobin-equivalent, silica-carbide skeletal structure, and extended/tapered ear structures. Skin tones range from bluish-white to blue-black. Hair tones range from pure white to black. Eyes include a tapetum lucidum. Brain structure includes an enlarged structure in the frontal lobe corresponding to the Corpus Merlinius [[footnote]]An anomalous brain structure corresponding to thaumaturgical talent.[[/footnote]] in humans. Height averages 2 meters, weight averages 75 kg. Average lifespan is unknown: captive specimens have not survived longer than seven days away from their home universe. However, captured records indicate a possible upper lifespan exceeding one thousand years. \n\nKTE-8888 possesses superhuman speed, senses, strength, and thaumaturgical ability. In addition, KTE-8888 instances emit high levels of radiation (both electromagnetic and Aspect) in the course of their normal life processes. Prolonged exposure results in severe radiation sickness and mutagenic thaumaturgical alteration. Deceased KTE-8888 specimens do not emit this radiation, and are safe to handle and study.\n\nKTE-8888 currently represents an existential threat. Primary threat vector is intent to invade and colonize our universe, mandated by **KTE-8001-Black-Dokkalfarfather** (“Alvar Leader, aka Malkarius, The Great Unifier”). Threat is mitigated by presence of opposing faction led by **KTE-8002-Black-Ljosalfarfather** (\"Alvar Leader, aka Illyriel, The Apostate.”) However, opposing faction currently does not possess the strength to overthrow KTE-8001-Black, and cannot be counted on to prevent incursions into our world.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size large]] **Engagement Rules:** [[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\nKTE-8888 is highly allergic to ferrous metals (particularly high concentrations of iron), with lesser allergies to lead and aluminum. Standard issue firearms using [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-equipment|Mark VII Frangible Cold Iron Ammunition (Ochre Bullets)]]] can be highly effective against them, provided that one can penetrate their defenses, which are considerable. \n\nTypical armaments include monomolecular blades made of a high-density compressed bronze, armor made of the same, and flexible ballistic-rated cloth woven from silk produced by a spider-analogue designated KTE-8008-Goodrick-NACL (“Sapient Arachnoid”). Ranged armament primarily consists of a TanGenTial technology weapon utilizing nesting ring-structures thaumaturgically constructed to accelerate hardened projectiles to hypersonic speeds. Weapon is capable of penetrating [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-equipment|MkII Combat Suit (White Suit)]]] armor plating at 500 meters, and projectiles are often thaumaturgically enhanced with explosive charges and penetration aids.\n\nEngage at distances exceeding 1 km if possible. Prioritize neutralization of thaumaturgical enhancements, utilizing thaumaturgical workings and Spellbreaker systems. Once telekinetic shielding is removed, utilize coordinated saturation fire to destroy KTE-8888 at range. Should KTE-8888 close to point-blank range, casualties will be unavoidable: sacrifice of GOC personnel is pre-authorized in any engagement with KTE-8888. In extreme cases, utilize \"Broken Arrow\" protocol[[footnote]]Saturation bombing of friendly positions by airstrike or artillery.[[/footnote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size large]]**History:**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px;]]\n[[div style=\"background-image: url(http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8009/corruption.png)\"]]\nAn accurate historical record of KTE-8888 is difficult to determine due to temporal framework misalignment between our universe and theirs. However, it is known that KTE-8888 instances have invaded our world throughout human history, ranging as far back as the 10th century BCE. Initial incursions appear to have been in response to precognitive visions by KTE-8001 (“Malkarius”), intended to prevent some future event, but were opposed by KTE-8002 (“Illyriel”)\n\nOldest extant records of contact with KTE-8888 date back to 5th Century BCE, when the predecessor to the Universalist Order of the Aesir was first visited by b̷e̸i̴n̸g̵s̵ ̷f̷r̴o̸m̴ ̶a̴n̵o̸t̶h̴e̶r̸ ̴w̷o̷r̵l̸d̷ ̴w̴h̶i̴c̴h̵ ̵t̸h̷e̸y̸ ̸r̷e̵f̷e̷r̴r̸e̴d̴ ̴t̵o̴ ̸a̸s̴ ̶\"̷T̸h̶e̴ ̸D̵o̵k̶k̸a̴l̴f̷a̸r̴,̶\"̸ ̴o̴r̴ ̷D̵a̶r̷k̴ ̵E̷l̷v̷e̵s̵.̶ ̵[[collapsible show=\"H̵̜̹̰̠̗́̑̔̄̐͆͗̋̐̎̚͝o̵̧̖̦̲̫̭̖̮̼͇̼̗̤̹͠w̶̢͙̘̣̹̙̓̒̅̿e̷̪̯̝̘̙̲̩̙͎̖̯̹͉͖̩͐ͅv̴̦̮́̓ȩ̷̛͈͇̻̱͔̻̭̫̘̅̆͆̔̿̒̂̑́̈́͒̂̀̐̋͝ŗ̵̖̤̼̖͌̒̔͌̀̅͋͑͘,̵̢͚̥͍͚̪̫̌ ̵̬̩̹͎̯̱̝̹͂̉̿̾͘t̴̛̖͐͌̿͐̔̅̌͆̾͌̒͘͘͘h̴̢̨̞̰̦̟͖̗̯̖͓͔̪̱͕́̊͂͑́̉͜ḙ̸̡̧̹̗͓̘̮̬̠̭̩̘͖̮͐͐͆̎͊̔̿͆̔̑̍̿̎ͅr̵̡̛͓̟̮̻͖̹̰͐͊̎̓ͅe̸̛͍̣̓̄̀̇̑́̀͆̓̂͋͛̆́̕͘ ̴̣̱͇͚̣̺̭̪̈̽̒͊̿͛͝͝i̴̛̠̲̿̓̅̒̋̐̀s̴̛͕͖͈͙̜͌͆͒̑̌̊̃̇̈́̅͊̊͂̿͘͘ ̷̡̛͚̹̟̗̪̫̥̩̟͚̣̱̀̔́̋͑́̂̃̇̃̏ę̸̧̤͙̠̜̣̪͓̺̗̝͍̈́̊̈̿͝ͅv̵̢̡̘̟̬͔́͂͐̋͒ͅȋ̴͖́͆̈̆̅͂̀̂̐̄̑̿̀͝͠d̸̛̮͉̆̔̿͐̑͐͜e̷̢̝̥͚̝̝̽͗̾̈́͋́̂͛̒́͛͋̏ņ̷̡̜̰̻̳͔̘̬̼̘͓̓́c̵̢̦̼̪̖̻̼̥̮̦̮̰̙̾͌͆͋̀̔̓̄̽̒̄͂̊͐͜ȩ̴̛̛̤̞̜͙̼̤̠̯̱̩͍̅̃̆̾͂̂͛͋͗̈́͛́͜͜͝͝ ̶̥̩̩̘͍̠̩̮̥͙̻̖̣̀̓̏̎̾̾̈́͒͐̀̕t̷̜̻̭̰͑̐̃͜͝h̵̡̢̪̭͎̦̠̮̪̹̣̆̇̊̈a̴͚͂͋͗͗̈́́̑ẗ̵̢͚͚̭̤͉̠͕̺́̌̎̄͗̾͝͝ ̵͖͍̄̈̋͛̄̈́̓̋͌̅̉̓̏͂͛̕a̴͔͕̯̲̳̫̩̯̯̮̬͉̙̩̎͋͋̀͆̎͊̐̕͘̚͠͠͠ͅ ̷̡̧̹̩͖̣̻͚͎̩̳̯̍̓̔͜ͅp̴̛̦͙̬̩̲͔̖̽̈́̿̂͂͊̀͑͝r̸̢̘͙͇̮̯͇̭̗̤̫̘̫͎̘̄̊͜͜͠į̵̧̛̜̠͎̰̫̝͓͚͇̖̺̙̫̩̽̎̓͋͊̋̂́̓̏͗̈́͒͝ơ̶̡̧̢̨͖͇̭̲͔̼̦̭͈͉̼̓̒̈́̇͒̓̅̓͗ͅr̶̬̿̄̈́̃͛ ̶̡͚̝͚̲͍̫͚̰͙̬̤͕̱͉͆͒́̔͗͌̐e̷̢͓̜̞͙̬̳͎̣͇̓̔́̃͛͗͆͗̏̑͘͠͝͝͝͝n̴͚̮̟͈̱̈́̅̓̇̒c̷͎͕̰̜̭͖̯̳͙̩͈̓̈́͗̔ͅͅȏ̴̥̯̱͔̼̦̺̲͍̩̬̊͐̊͂̾̊̏́̆͘͜͝ǘ̵̧̢̪̟͕͈̓̃́̑̃͗̽̓͑̍̏͂̚͠͝͠n̶̡̳͆̈́̑̑̈́̄͊͘͝t̶͕̙͋̇̎e̶̝̤͎͔͈̫͔̯̗͆͐͠ŗ̸̛̫̙̪̘͙̮̩͋̍̽̋͒̃̈́̎͌͑̄͛͆͘͝͠ ̵̨̛̥͇̘̭͇̙̟͉̍̽̅̿́͆̎̚͝i̶̛͚͉̺̖̗͎͉̻̘͛͒̽̈́̊̈́̅̔̑̓̓̓͗̃̏̕n̸̢̝͇͇͇̫͇̹̤̖̤͚̎̈͗͊͑̉̔̋̐̒̈́̅̔͠͠͝ ̴̛̝͚͉̥̼̤͇͇̊͂̄̐̌̈́̂͗͌p̶̮̤̝͈̮̖̝̓́́͊̚͝ŗ̶͙̜̗͍͉̹̦̋́̔̏͗̽̓̄̑̆͗̿͒͘͘ȩ̸̤͙͓̳͕̙̖͚̦̩͕̒͌̊̎̌̃͐͐̔̈́̓̕͘͜͜ḩ̵̛̯̲̳̙̲̙̬̳̰̊̀̍͗̀͐͋͋̾̽̏̆͛́̉͘ḭ̵̡̛͙͓̤͍͎̥̰̯͇̜̥͛͋̐̍͗̀̍̕͘̕͝ș̵̡͓̠̣͉̻͉͓̟̞̼̠̟̜̀͆̿̋̎̽̀̈́̒͑ͅṱ̸̯͙̬̙͇̭̗̈́͐̈̌͒̐͋̐͘̕ǒ̶͈̗̯̙̘̼̿̌̒̏̋̓r̵͎͂̊͛̆͝͠͝i̶̳͎͈͔̹̳̼̖͂̊̋̀̅̋̀̏̈́́̈́̌̈́̈́̓͐c̵̦̗̘͍̗̘̠͙͎͇͚͔̣̮͚͊̏͛͑͐́͜ͅ ̵͔̰̗̟̬̦̘̟͙͋͋̐́͌͒̈̋̑̚̕͘͝͝ͅN̷̺̈́͗̈̓̽͋̈́̈́͛̿͊̀̄̍̆̐͠o̷̧̮̙̾r̶̯̩̟̼̲͎̹͖̹̰̱͍̞̜̙̙̗̎͊̆̄̔͝ẃ̷̤͔̺̩͉̦̥͔̙̳͍͕̬̼̂̇͐̑̚ͅa̵̢̨̛̭̲͓͎̠͓͖̜̝̻̖̿̄́̂̋̀̍͐͊̅̾͒̒͛͒͜ẏ̷̢̡̡̛̳̲̥̳̮̗͚̦͍͍̆͌̽̈́̆̔͌̉̐̃̕͠ ̸̢̡͚͍͙̣̘̰̹̬̻͎̟̼͓͍̒͗͌̀̋̌̀ͅm̶̩̗̦̈̈́͊̋̓̌â̵͖͖̦̤͖̲̰̪͉̰̙y̶̬͔̯̑̄̓͂́̆̑ ̶̩̟̱̦̲̞̹̭̼̠͋ͅh̸͍̙̙̼̲͉̝̬̳̝̘͍̳̀͒̊̍̎́̓͋̚̕͜͝ạ̷̙̙̼͈̲̜̱̗̗̃́͘ͅv̷̨͓̥͙͎̯̞͙̭̱̣̑̑͒̾̈́̆̚͜ḙ̴͚͚̓̍̋̏̊̚ͅ ̵̧̘̲̯̞̯̓̑́́͠t̸̛̪͚̱̩͖͇̱̻̣̱̏̌̆̿̀̾͐̕͝å̴̧̨̧̗͇̭͚̖̣̪͉̂̇͊̾̋̿k̷̗̩̫̬̱̝̯̥̘̅̀͂̄ě̵̢̢͖͙͉̣̭̫͚͔͒̂̏̈́̒̎̾̎̿̍̉̆͘͝n̷̛̫̤͙̦̳͉̻͓͈̥͔̪͖̄̾͑̈́̊͆̆͐̋̄͘͠͠ ̶̨͕̳͈̲̖̥̲̂̒̑̾̌̄̓͋̈̿̉̄͂͠͠p̶̧̨̨͖̞̞̣̹̳̠̰͉͖̯̫̀̄͛̄̀̐̎͛͋̈̀͊̌̄̔l̵̬̺͚̫͓͚̳̺̰͇̥̗͍̖̿̏̓̇͐͆̓̈́̈́͜a̴̡̨̝͕̫̩̠̭̾͆̌̂́̒̌́̃͝c̷̼͙̻͍̤̣̘̲͚̗̯͔̓̽̈́̏͗̑̈́̇̌̃͑͛͘͝e̸͇̎́̄̍̇͒͗̋̂̏̎͌̅̍͠,̷̨̡͎̪͓̳̺͎͒̇́͗͘ ̶̙̜͛͊b̷̛̻͙̞̪̫͕̭͖̲̣̥͈͔̩͑̉͆̃̍́̾̎̈̽̋̄́͠ą̸̪̞͇͙̻̹̰̞̱̯͓̭͍̱͈̃̔̑͑̄̈́̄̂̈́̐̄̽͂̕̕͝͝s̶̡̧̨͇̗͇̘͎͔̦̺͐͛ͅͅḙ̶͎̜̜̺̫̒̐̓̊̃̀͐͊ḑ̶̠̲̪̲̟͇̣̦͎̳͙̣̙͎̋́̈̉͗̾́͌̏̕͘͜ͅ ̷̭̺̹͓͓͂̌͑͂́͆̍̅̀̍̆̌̔̚͠o̴̜̬͂̅̍͑̿̾̍ņ̷̨̨̱̤̼̞̳͇̥͓̰͔̓̃̋̈́͑̂̕ͅ ̴̡̧̛̗̝̲͉̠̝͇̐̉̈́͋̃̏͛́c̸̨̭͙̝̲͈͙̻͈̝̟̣͔̜̮̓̈͗̓̀̇͆̾͘ą̸̘̪̮̖̖͈͓̍̍v̴̧͍͍̠͚͈̞̬͈̅è̷̮̞͖̪͒̿̏̚͠ ̷̠̯̪̿p̴̡̢̛̩̞̠̠͔̤̹̳̱̝͉̯̎͐̌̀́͗͐̄̄̅̏̕̚̕͝͝a̷̡̨̬̹̝͐́͛́͊̆̀̿͛̊́͠͝į̵̧̱̺̯̺̥̻͕͖͆̇̅̇͒̾͋͌̈́̎͆͌̕͘̚͝͠n̴̡̠̖̣̙̳̗̮̯̹̩͕̋̅̀͐̉̆̿̓̑͂͋̈́̑́̕̕t̷͓͌͒̀̔̈́̈́̔̋̇̾͝ï̸̪͊́̕͝ṋ̵̛̮̼̜̃̾̉͐̚͜g̶̡̨̢̻̪̰̪̬̗͉̲͚̪̩̣̔̈̓̉̈́͑̊̓̇̊̑͑͐̚͝s̴̛̮͗̄̄̋̿̚͝ ̵̢̼͇͈̰͍̝͔͈̫̫̹̅̏̄̅̾̋̀̈́̆̒̈͒̅͘̕ͅd̴̨͔͉̟̖̋̀͋̐̌͌̍͊̊̀̈́̉͒̄̀͘į̶̨̨̨̧͎̗͕̝͖̱͕̗̦̌̆̐̅͊͌̋̉͝s̸̛͕͙̲̬̈̍̏̒̆̀̿̾ć̸̨̱͓̮̳̗̖̼̹͚̀́͋͆͐͂́͘̚͝ͅö̵̻̭̤̱͙̝͚̹́͋͑͑̊͑̚͘̕͘͝v̷̛͇̟̅͒̊̄̓̄̉̑̋̈́̚͘͝ ̷͔͙̈́̄ḋ̸̡̪͈̥͍̮̫͔̝̬̗͔̮̻̖͇̟͑̂̒̔̌͋͂i̵̭̻̹̦̜̭̗̬̺̞̣̼͈̫̝̪̼̋̀̒̓̈́̈́̾̈̎̈́͂̀̽̕s̶̛̻̟͈̭̐͆̆͌̊͛̈́͌ć̸̨̡̯͉̘̮̥̖̯͙̹̙̤͓̍̑̉͐͛̈͌̊͑̈́͐͘̕ơ̷̡̨̙͚̥͚͓̮̤̞̖̞̖͗̇̽͂̈́͝v̸͍͖̜̞̘̺͔̫͗̊̉̌̀̎͑̏͘ ̵̧̨̧̗̪̮̖̳̖̽͛́̉͑̊̌̔̓͋̆̓͗͜͝d̸̡̛̜̗̼͕͉̬̲̣̭̘̥͉̎͗̉̌̋̆̈́̎̾̃̋͂́̔̕͝i̷̡̡̢͙̘̗̖͖͖͓̺̭̱͋̀̀ş̶̜̯̮̪̻͔͎͎͖͙̗̘͋͗̆̀͆̚͠ç̷̝̳͚͖̦̥̙͈̻͈̺̝̣̹̈̿̔̈́̀̆̂̍͋̋͋͘͜o̴̧̲̬̤͓̱̹͈͆̍̈̿̿̄̽͒́́͗̈́̈͛̅͑͜͝ͅv̵̡̻͇̳̺̩̦̞̯̐̑͐̈̐̿̒͋̅͆̎̀̇͘̕͠ͅ ̷̢̻̲̻̦̭͐͌̏̀̈̈͋͆̉̋̅͗͒̚͝d̶̛̥̝̮̤̠̲̜̱̰̻̃̄̀͆͒͝í̶̞̙̥̄͌͋̆͊͒̃͒̚͠͝͠s̶̩͗͒̅̈́̉̇͛͒͘͝͝͝͠c̸̰̗̣̗͎͚̼̱̬̼̫̟̣͊̓̊̀̈́͂̄͋̋͂͂͜͠ŏ̸̝͚̤̹̪͋͊̉̔̉̆̄̏̈́̈̐͋͘͝v̸̛̗͎̖̥̭̭͙͎̥̹̭̆̿̋̿̇̽̆̑͗͊̉́̕̕͝ W̵̘̩̞̺͖̉̐̇̏̇̇̑̽̓̈́̾̑̕Ạ̴͙̹̦̝͎̱̪̝͓̐́́̀I̷̧̹̒͊͛͆̓̄̿̃̀̈̈̅̇̆̒̆͘Ṭ̷̨̯̩̻̤̪͓̬̑͌̿͗͐̓̎̊̎͊͛̉͘͝.̴̡͇͎͍̩̻̘͈̺̦̫̱̠̼̖̀̉̊̄͝ ̸̦̯̲̭͖̌͗̌Ỳ̷̢̥͍̲̞̣̳̦̼͔̞͕̯̠̂̐́̊̍́̔ͅÖ̷͉̝̕Ṳ̷̢̝͉̪̼͚̬͖̓͛̾͂̉͗̀͐̀͌̃̆͝ ̸̢̨͔̫̰̯̩̠̞̰͛͊̓̌̇͆̃́̀̅͋̋͊̈͘A̷͙̫͙̙̯͋̇͐͌̍̀̈́̈́̕̕͠Ȓ̸̝̘̥̬͈͎͔̟̯͉͈̏̋͑̀̑̓͜͝E̴̱̬̫͉͍̻̩̥̼̹͐͆̈́̋̒̏̈́̑̌̋̋̋̉͊͘͝ ̶̢̨̡̛͈͈̯͓̻̯̣̙͕̣̦̞̦̄̃̓̈́̈̊̅̇̔̿̍͆͋̌͘N̸̖͔̱͎̘̲̈́̂̀͛O̷̗̞̣̲̖͖̬̅͋̏́̊̒̾̂̏̀͛͑̄̾̈́͠T̸̢̻͔̻̩̘͎̫̬̺̾̏̅͋̋̊͠͝ͅ ̶͕͔̺̃͆͗̓Ơ̷̘͓̗̯͌̅͛͊͒̈́̍̒̄͋͝͠Ņ̶̮̫̖͎͕͉̰̳̪͈̥͒̑̐̌̋̓̓̌̀͠͝ͅͅĘ̷̡̪̝̹̞͎̥͈͈͈̳͎̀̓͜ͅ ̷̺͈̳̻͖͈͚̩̃Ơ̸̆̐̆̓̔̿̒̉̅̇͘͠͠͠͝ͅF̶͚̹͔̪͎̯̔͗ ̷̛̲̠͓̝́͐̂̔͋̑̄̈́͠ͅƯ̶̛͙̲͔͆̑̄̂͋͐́̀̃S̶̡̱͇͉̫͍̒̓́̋͊̐̀̇̀͌̾̓͌̈́̃̐͂.̵͍͍̲̞̩͈̠̯̠͐̍̔̈́̑̈́̏͑̋̓̀̕͘͝͠͠ ̷̜̬̬̭̰̘͚͖̱̟͙̈́̽̈́͐͜͜H̴̢̛̯̲͍̥̥̗̟̪̤̰͚̩̝́̌̆̐̇̓͗̈́̆ͅO̴̡̖̰̲̝̟͖̘̯͕̹̻̹̾̊̇͆̑̚͜ͅW̵̨̛̳͐̃̀̏͒͒̓͋̉̈́̓̍́̔ ̶̢͇̜̟̮̪̭̯͈͚̙̂͗̒͌̏̈́̄̌͛̕͜D̸̡̡̹̻͔̳̹̦̣̤̳̆̊͗͆̏̌̒̓͂́̏̋̃̍́I̸̧̱̎̇͋̈́̄̄͊̕̚͝D̵̰̗̰̤̗̣̥̭̞̯̱͇̥͇̞̉͑͊͐̏̓̂̀͌̈́̔͐̾̈̕ ̶̢̨͙̯͉͈̩͎̫͇͈̮̫̻͖̉̋̔̄̔͛͗͂͑͐̉̕͜͠ͅY̸̨̘͎͈̥̣̝̙̙̗̤̝̤̥͒̋̍̔̾́͘͘͜͠͠ͅO̵̡̼̣̥͕̭̘̯̲̥͇̫̼̓͛̅͜ͅU̶͖͒̓̄̀̊̈̅̊̾́̆͘̕͝ ̴̜̺̱̙͎͈̤͖͔͔̥̋͊͌̅͗̎͗̓̏̕͜͜͜ͅͅF̵͇̺͚͉̙̳͓͈̹̗̤͍̝̟̍́̀̑́̎͛̎̐̈́͐̓͘͘͜͝I̵̟̺͍̦͆̇͗̍̚N̴͖͖̬̿̎̃̕D̶̺̫͔̅̓ ̴̧͓͉̉̈̃̂͂͌͒̈̍͗͐͛͘͜Ý̶̢̢̲͖͕͓̱̩͕͚̲̪̹͙͉̓̓̑̇́̈́́̅̀̀̐̍͜͝\" hide=\"A bold attempt.

The end result was an information cross-contamination between your universe and ours in the form of  [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1764|a small, rounded mirror that exists in both our worlds simultaneously.]]] The mirror itself was harmless: however, any text written about it would become unhinged in reality and transfer into the counterpart world. \n\nThis is what the Deviant Artifacts Research Division called \"The Information Anomaly.\"\n\nMalkarion ordered the researchers of his DARD to devise a working to enter this alternative world. The initial intention was conquest, but ambition soon became terror. The DARD was unprepared for the kinds of hazards that your world contained, and several of them passed into our world, resulting in the deaths of several dozen of our people. After the third such contamination, Malkarion gave new orders: the gateway from our world to yours would now be used for the introduction of a death-curse --(The Unspeakable)-- that would wipe out all of humanity. \n\nThe end result should have been the complete eradication of your species, if it were not for a senior researcher with the DARD: Malkarion's most favored scientist, one of his most talented magi, and the creator of both the Triliminal Gate and --The Unspeakable-- Death-Curse. \n\nThe researcher's name was Illyr Celebrion. She is who I used to be, before the moment that my conscience overwhelmed my loyalty to my God.\n\nOne does not defy a God lightly. Rest assured that I have paid the consequences for my actions. Malkarion made one mistake: in his pride, he chose to punish me personally. I will not relate the agonies I suffered at his hand, except to say that they gave me the opportunity I needed to escape, and to achieve my own apotheosis. That was when I found my first followers, and when our war began.\n\nThe nature of this war is both existential and metaphysical. When gods go to war, reality is your sword and time is your shield. Already, our history has become twisted and unmoored in time relative to yours, as Malkarion and I engage in attack and counter-attack, attempting to erase each others' existence. The war has been a long and difficult one, but I am pleased to say that my followers and I are finally beginning to gain the upper hand against our deadly foe.\n\nUnfortunately, Malkarion is nothing if not spiteful, and has begun to lash out not only at our world, but yours. Although he has lost the knowledge of the replicating death-curse, he has been able to create duplicates of the original Triliminal Gate, through which he sends his lesser death-curses and assassins. His goals are three-fold: to engage in wanton slaughter, to capture artifacts and weapons he believes will aid him in his fight, and to capture slaves to supplement his dwindling forces. (This last action I consider the most reprehensible, for what slaves he does capture live miserable lives, twisted and mutated by the magic that permeates our world into foul monsters. Regretfully, in many cases, the only succor we can offer is oblivion.) \n\nMy followers and I are currently engaged in a series of defensive actions, attempting to destroy these Gates before they can do too much harm. Sometimes we are less than successful. The current disruption of your records is a side effect of a partially failed attempt. Thankfully, my followers were able to intercept the attack before it could do too much harm.\n\nThe record which was the initial vector of this attack has been repaired. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8009/offset/5| My apologies for the inconvenience. I now return you to your original place and time.]]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\nengaged by Strike Team 1220 (“Snorri’s Sons”) after interdimensional gateway manifestation in Peary Land, Greenland. Contact was made with four KTE-8888 instances (Threats 1 through 4) attempting to carry out a high-level thaumaturgical working with eschatological consequences. Strike Team Commander ordered immediate engagement with all assets: resulting saturation fire disrupted thaumaturgical working, but failed to terminate threats. \n\nThreats 1 broke off from the main group and proceeded north, while Threats 3 and 4 immediately charged the strike team in an attempt to close to point-blank range. Threat 2 took cover and laid down suppressing fire, resulting in the death of operative “Siegfried” after a projectile penetrated his helmet’s faceplate and detonated inside his cranium. Two other operatives were injured at this time: the remainder of Third Squad returned fire and were able to overwhelm Threat 2’s telekinetic defenses, following which Threat 2 returned through the gateway, escaping the battle. \n\nSecond Squad was detailed to deal with Threat 1, while First Squad attempted to halt Threat 3 and 4’s advance. Threat 3 was terminated fifteen meters from First Squad’s position: Threat 4 closed the distance and killed two operatives (“Victor” and “Hugo”) at close range before being eliminated by operative “Katrina,” who detonated her White Suit’s internal reactor after tackling Threat 4 and carrying them out of First Squad’s position. \n\nSecond Squad engaged in a rapid flanking maneuver to cut off Threat 1’s escape, but lost track of them due to an incoming snowstorm. Threat 1’s corpse would be recovered two days later, having perished due to exhaustion, exposure, and hunger.\n\nHaving secured the interdimensional gateway, Strike Team Commander detailed the attached thaumatologists to deactivate and destroy the device. Artifacts were recovered and returned to the local GOC embassy for analysis and study. Surviving Strike Team operatives underwent therapy for radiation exposure: no further casualties were reported as a result of this incident.\n[[/div]]",
