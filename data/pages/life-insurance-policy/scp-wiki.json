What if my wife lives longer than the three months you permit for me to be on leave? I would hate to have to come back to work knowing her health is in decline and I can't be by her side.\n\nBesides, to be truthful to you, I only took this job because of the advanced healthcare it offered for her and the pay to allow her to live a comfortable life. Once she passes I don't see myself working for the Foundation any longer simply because I won't have the need to. Don't get me wrong, I've loved working here and I will cherish the friends and memories I've made here for a lifetime, but without Luisa, I would rather live a civilian life. Maybe I'll become a teacher.\n\nBy the way, don't worry about sending my one-month notice anymore.
