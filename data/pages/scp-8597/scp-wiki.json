Upon viewing, a looping 30-second audio clip of Claude Debussy's //Clair De Lune// will play. The first slide is dedicated to a title card reading \"//your month, your guy,//\" followed by twelve images. Each depicts an instance of SCP-8597-1, as well as its name and individual characteristics.\n\nSCP-8597-1 is a group of twelve anomalous entities correlated to a month of the year that spontaneously appear upon viewing SCP-8597. The viewer’s birth month is the determining factor in which of the twelve entities will manifest. \n\nFor an SCP-8597-1 instance to materialize, a user must have the slide corresponding to their birth month opened for over 60 seconds. The title card also specifies that users \"believe hard;\" though there is no evidence linking a user's belief and the likelihood of an SCP-8597-1 manifestation. A user's SCP-8597-1 instance will remain within their vicinity as long as SCP-8597 is actively open on a user's device.\n\nShould a user scroll away from SCP-8597, close the application, or shut their device off, the SCP-8597-1 instance will violently explode. Among the blood and viscera, a piece of paper will be left in place of the entity, containing only a text-based \"sad face\" emoticon.[[footnote]] :( [[/footnote]] Users can remanifest their corresponding SCP-8597-1 instance by following the manifestation parameters above.\n\n**Addendum 8597.1:** SCP-8597-1 Instances\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-8597-1A | Jan.]]\n[[div class=\"slide\"]]\n##white|january##\n__bicurious frank__\n[[f>image https://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/jawn-four/frank.png width=\"300em\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@   @@- ooh ooh aah aah\n@@   @@- pees on stuff to claim it\n@@   @@- fiscal conservative\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-8597-1A is a golden snub-nosed monkey (//Rhinopithecus roxellana//) enveloped in pink, purple, and blue colored light, commonly referred to as “bisexual lighting” in popular colloquialisms.

Despite pulling the slide corresponding to his birth month, no SCP-8597 entity manifested. Instead, White's phone crashed due to overheating. \n\nOver the course of an hour, White's stomach became incredibly distended and bloated. He was sent to the Site infirmary, where nurses noted White's body temperature was 10 degrees below baseline. Attempts were made to sedate White, all of which failed, and his assertions of intense pain became continuous screaming as the mass grew larger. The mass squirmed violently within White before throwing him off the bed into a kneeling position. The mass could be seen moving up White's digestive tract, causing extreme distension to his chest and neck that should have sent White into unconsciousness or proven fatal. White expelled a black, viscous fluid from his mouth, followed by two hand-like implements attached to a 25-pound, amorphous blob of flesh, hair tissue, teeth, and eyeballs. \n\nWhite subsequently passed out but made a full recovery.
