There's no way I can be drunk. It's preposterous. Absolutely absurd.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nLet the record show that--\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nI'm not done yet! It's factually foolish. Ridiculously ridiculous. You'd have to be a smooth-brained baboon to assume to say that me, //the// Ruiz Duchamp, is drunk.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYour honor, I'd like to conduct a breathalyzer test on the defendant.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nThat's... understandable, to say the least. An officer should be over here in around 15 minutes.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nThat's all the time I need to win this damn case.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nLet the record show that you're currently far from winning \"this damn case\".\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nAnyways, my client alleges that on June 3rd, 2021, he was approached by defendant Ruiz Duchamp. Duchamp offered to sell her, in his words: \"Tarkan stones. These are rocks from the last island in existence we're talking about.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nWhen my client asked how this supposed island could be the last one in existence when the earth and multiple islands within it are obviously still present, Duchamp became belligerent. He began insisting that my client was questioning his methods and retrieved one of his alleged Tarkan stones from his jacket, which I would like to present to the court.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\n//Anthony Stone pulls out a sealed bag with a rock inside of it, placing it on the table.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYour honor, this is just a normal rock.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\n//Ruiz Duchamp slams his hands on the table.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nHe's stalling for time your honor.

Your honor, the weapon used to assault my client.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\n//Anthony Stone pulls out a sealed bag with a quartz crystal inside of it, placing it on the table.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nWhile you may not be able to see it from here, your honor, this piece of quartz has a price sticker on it. Clearly, this was purchased by Duchamp prior to his assault.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nIt isn't from Tarkan, it isn't from some magical island at the end of the universe, it's just a hunk of quartz. Mister Duchamp is clearly deranged.

But yes.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nAnd you're assuming, therefore, that I must have purchased it from a store prior to assaulting-- ALLEGEDLY ASSAULTING-- Ms. Emmerson?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYes.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nAnd because there is a discrepancy in your belief that I purchased the Tarkan crystal from a store and my testimony that it is from The Last Island, you are claiming that I'm deranged?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line stone\"]]Stone[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nAre you going to continue summarizing my arguments or are you planning on having an original thought?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nAnd you assume this discrepancy DESPITE the fact that, as a vendor of Tarkan minerals, I may have added the price sticker myself.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYou also assume this discrepancy DESPITE the fact that I may have purchased the crystal from a store on The Last Isle.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nIn either case, I would not be deranged and your argument would fall to pieces like a sand castle at high tide.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nMister Duchamp.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYe?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nDid you add the price sticker to the qua--\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\n//Duchamp glares at the judge.

I'm here to testify!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nLet the record show that...

Mister Duchamp, remove yourself from the witness stand at once.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line socko\"]]Socko[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\n...now, I've known Ruiz for a long time, and I can tell you that he's a fine, upstanding man.

Your Honor, I was planning on calling my own witness up to the stand.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYeah... if we could just... security, can you remove Socko from the stand?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\nSecurity places Socko inside of a shoe box and removes her from the witness stand.

Anyways, \"POV: Me\" is a VR headset that shows you the world through Ruiz's eyes. I decided to put on the headset, and that was when I saw Ruiz hit that poor woman over the head with a geode.

No, a geode is a rock with crystals in it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nDuchamp's right. Geodes and crystals are completely different things.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line thorton\"]]Thorton[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nWell-- I-- You know what I meant! I saw him do it!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nUh huh. And you said that I hit Miss Emmerson over the head with the crystal? I'm assuming you meant I used a sort of swinging motion?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line thorton\"]]Thorton[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nI... Well I don't know! Why don't you tell me how you did it?!...\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYour Hon--\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line thorton\"]]Thorton[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYou little shit!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\nDuchamp glares at Thorton before turning to face the judge.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYour Honor, the prosecution claims that I broke Miss Emmerson's nose by jabbing a crystal into her face, while the prosecution's witness claims that I hit Miss Emmerson over the head with a geode.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nSomething isn't adding up. I'd go so far as to say that my dearly despised Alacia Thorton didn't witness anything. She just made it up for the purpose of getting me prosecuted!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYou forgot to say \"end cross-examination.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nWhat?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nWhen you finish cross examining someone, you're supposed to say \"end cross-examination.\" You forgot to say it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nOh. So I just... end cross-examination.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"box mid\"]]\nThe Judge nods.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line judge\"]]Judge[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nYou may proceed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span class=\"line champ\"]]Duchamp[[/span]]\n[[div_ class=\"box\"]]\nSo, um... yeah, what I said earlier.
