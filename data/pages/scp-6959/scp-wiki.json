Generators are to be inspected every two days for faults.\n\nThe object's containment cell is constructed of steel-reinforced concrete, with the only entrance to the cell being a secure airlock requiring clearance 4 or above permission to be opened. Any unauthorized entrance detected within the cell will be met with immediate termination to prevent a containment failure. Any testing performed on SCP-6959 must be authorized by Site Director Roerens. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6959 resembles a  Fumo Plush doll of the character Cirno from the video game \"Embodiment of Scarlet Devil\". SCP-6959 has no discernable aesthetic differences from any factory-made doll apart from lacking a tag. The object's makeup consists entirely of strange matter, displaying all hypothesized characteristics associated with the substance. It is currently unknown how SCP-6959 came to have its current appearance; research regarding its origin in space and how it came to be on a collision course with Earth is ongoing.\n\nSCP-6959 presents a significant danger to Earth as any matter it comes into contact with will undergo an instant conversion and be added to SCP-6959's mass; it is hypothesized that SCP-6959 could completely convert the earth within 5 hours of initial contact resulting in an XK-Class End-Of-The-World scenario. Due to the properties of strange matter, efforts to destroy or cause cellular decay in SCP-6959 have proved useless, and research suggests SCP-6959 could only be permanently removed if jettisoned into a black hole or through the use of paradimensional anomalies.\n\n\n**Discovery:** The earliest record of SCP-6959's existence was a routine NASA drone's report on 2/17/09, it was determined to be on a collision course with the Earth. Foundation efforts were requested and SCP-6959 was successfully inserted into a temporary containment unit on 3/11/22. No origin point for SCP-6959's travel has been determined, further research is pending.\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Clearance level 4 detected. Welcome Dr. Roerens.

SCP-6959 has no discernable aesthetic differences from any factory-made doll apart from lacking a tag. The object's makeup consists entirely of strange matter, displaying traits previously hypothesized with the substance. SCP-6959 originated from the fusion of neutron stars RX J1856.5−3754 and JT J17855.2-3752, strangelets expunged during the process formed into SCP-6959, which subsequently came to be on a collision course with Earth. Through the use of procedure Merlin-184, it has been confirmed that SCP-6959 is non-anomalous. Despite this, due to the events outlined in Addendum 6959-A and a unanimous vote from the O5 Council, SCP-6959 will not be classified with an -EX appendage. Information regarding the true nature of SCP-6959 is not to be disclosed to anyone below Level 4 clearance. \n\nDespite its lack of anomalous characteristics, SCP-6959 still presents a significant danger to Earth, as any matter it comes into contact with will undergo an instant conversion to SCP-6959's mass. It is theorized that SCP-6959 may have the ability to thoroughly convert the Earth within five hours of initial contact, resulting in an XK-Class End-Of-The-World Scenario. Due to the properties of strange matter efforts to destroy or cause cellular decay in SCP-6959 have proved useless. Research suggests SCP-6959 could only be permanently removed if jettisoned into a black hole or through the use of paradimensional anomalies.\n\n**Addendum 6959-A:** The following is a series of events following the research efforts of Site Director Evan Roerens and Temporary Co-Site Director Everett Chalmers in relation to SCP-6959. Dr. Roerens was given supervision of experiments regarding SCP-6959 with Dr. Chalmers being assigned to documentation and interpreting information regarding the object.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Everett Chalmers\n**From:** Dr. Evan Roerens\n**Subject:** SCP-6959 Assignment\n**Date:** 3/13/22\n[[/div]]\n------\nGood morning Chalmers,\n\nGlad to see we're going to be working together again, it's been a while hasn't it?

We've detected no reality-bending, no cognitive effects, none of the people we've interviewed know a thing and on top of that, we used magic and still it points to a lack of anomalies. I'm gonna talk directly with the O5's tomorrow about reclassifying this thing, if you have anything to say about that you can come to my office.\n\nBest, Evan\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n**The following is a transcript from CCTV recording of Director Roerens's office**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**DATE:** 3/23/22\n------\n[[=]]\n**BEGIN TRANSCRIPT**\n[[/=]]\n------\n//[Dr. Roerens is seen typing at his computer]//\n\n//[Dr. Chalmers enters the room, looking slightly disheveled]//\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** What the fuck do you think you're doing?\n\n//[Dr. Roerens is startled by Chalmers' sudden entry]//\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** Fucking Christ, you scared the hell out of me. What do you want?\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** I //want// to know what the fuck you think you're doing try to classify 6959 as Explained.\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** Are you still upset about this? I told you already, there's no evidence to the contrary.\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** No evidence? Have you looked at the damn thing? Here, I've got a replica right here for you.\n\n//[Chalmers produces a Fumo Doll matching the appearance of SCP-6959]//\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** You bought one? Aren't those things 500 dollars? \n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** That's beside the point, take a good long look at it. You're telling me this could somehow resemble something independently created out of the fusion of two Neutron Stars?\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** It's the working theory with what we have.\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** Are you serious? You're fucking delusional, how the hell did you manage to get this job if you're capable of believing something like this.\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** Calm down, there's no ne-\n\n//[Chalmers cuts off Roerens and begins speaking louder]//\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** Calm down!? You're suggesting that this fucking anime doll somehow existed during the big bang, the entire creation of the universe somehow coinciding with it!\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** We have nothing else to go off of, that's the only theory with evidence behind it. You read my email.\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** So what then!? Did Ōta somehow subconsciously get influenced to create a character resembling it!? Did its exact design get imprinted onto the minds of the designers!? Is God pulling some fucking prank on us? One so powerful and divine nothing we can do can reveal the punchline?\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** We don't know.\n\n**Dr. Everett:** The ramifications of it being nonanomalous are too heavy for you to be acting so nonchalant, were we destined to recreate it? Have we succeeded as a species now? Are you suggesting that everything we've done is pointless or something? Has every moment past the creation of the doll been a disappointment to some fucking Touhou Deity!?? Is that what you're fucking implying right now?\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** ...Maybe?\n\n//[Both Doctors pause for thirty seconds]//\n\n**Dr. Chalmers:** Are you suggesting that the perfect state of matter, the result of matter that existed at the beginning of the universe....is an Anime plushy?\n\n**Dr. Roerens:** .....Yes?\n\n//[Dr. Chalmers picks up an office chair and throws it at Dr. Roerens, the doctors fight for a moment before security arrives to apprehend Chalmers.]//\n------\n[[=]]\n**END TRANSCRIPT**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**STATEMENT FROM O5 COUNCIL**\n[[/=]]\nGood morning,\n\nAfter taking into consideration the events that transpired between Dr. Roerens and Dr. Chalmers, the Council has unanimously voted to not only deny reclassification to explained for the time being, but to also refrain from releasing info regarding SCP-6959 to the public.\n\nThe object will not be classified -EX until it is more properly understood and information regarding it can be conveyed in a way to prevent personnel from having an episode similar to Dr. Chalmers.\n\nDr. Chalmers himself is currently undergoing psychiatric evaluation, he will be denied access to SCP-6959 documentation for the time being.\n\nThank you.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6958]]] | SCP-6959 | [[[SCP-6960]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Fumofumofumofumofumo.jpg\n> **Author:** Renafox \n> **License:** CC BY 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/project-cirno-fumo-3d-scan-efd2a7f4dbf048c1a18438db7f86c4b9\n\n> **Filename:**RX J1856.5-3754.jpg\n> **Author:** NASA\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2002/0211/\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
