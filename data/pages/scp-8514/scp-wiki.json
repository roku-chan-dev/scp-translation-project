He noticed something and looked away from the body, toward a tree stump in the distance. He pointed at it lazily.\n\n\"A-huh.\"  Then he traced a line from the stump to the body. After glancing around again, he knelt, patting the corpse's pockets. He found what he had been searching for and went to take it.\n\n\"Isn't it a crime to remove evidence from the scene?\"\n\nWesson grunted, and without missing a beat, pulled out his badge and flipped it so it was facing behind him.\n\n\"It's okay, I know what I...\"  He glanced behind, seeing a woman.

He gestured for her to approach and stood.\n\n\"I'm Agent Smith, Unit 49,\" she said. \"I've been assigned to be your partner for this investigation.

Bit of a hypochondriac.\"\n\nHe shrugged carelessly.  \"So what did they tell you about this case back in Forty-Nine?\"\n\n\"Not much more than they told you, I'm guessing.\"  Smith knelt down to examine the corpse, crinkling her nose. \"Yep, that's a decapitated body, all right. Any idea who it is?\"\n\n\"I was about to go for his wallet when you came in.  No, I'll get it,\" he said as Smith went for the corpse's pocket. \"I'm used to getting in trouble with Forensics.\"\n\n\"Don't worry, I brought gloves.

No wedge marks in the ground. I'll go take a look.\"\n\nHe shoved his hands in his pockets and perambulated. He only got an eyeful before something diverted his attention. Female, older than Smith, good-looking. Pale, dark hair, excellent posture. Dressed better than either of them, carrying a suitcase. Nothing to indicate who she was or where she came from.\n\n\"Hey there,\" Wesson called, waving. \"The area's off-limits to civilians.\"\n\n\"I'm with the Bureau,\" she replied, raising a badge. Wesson trudged over and listlessly examined it. Ebony, Dana. Thirty-seven, Unit 22. He looked over at Smith.\n\n\"Did you request backup?\"\n\n\"Wasn't me.\"  He looked at the woman.\n\n\"I'm with forensics,\" she said. His face lit up with indolent delight.\n\n\"Oh, hey, good timing. He's all yours.\"  He gestured for Smith to move out of the way and stood back as the woman, Ebony, examined the corpse.  \"By the way,\" he grumbled, \"I'm Wesson, this is Smith.\"\n\n\"Smith and Wesson?\" she parroted, snickering. \"Are you joking?\"\n\nWesson glared incredulously at his partner.\n\n\"No. How are his knees?\" he called. Ebony glanced at him.\n\n\"His...knees?\"\n\n\"Yeah. What kind of stress were they subjected to in the last few hours?\"  She made a face and examined the corpse's knees more closely, even going so far as to lower its pants.\n\n\"I'd say he was kneeling,\" she reported. \"Why?\"\n\n\"Thought so,\" Wesson stated.  He crossed his arms, staring down at the body.  \"This wasn't a murder.\"\n\n\"Makes perfect sense,\" Smith stated ironically. \"People get decapitated naturally all the time.\"\n\n\"No, I mean, this man was -- what's his ID?\"\n\n\"Uh, Wayne,\" Smith said, peering at a passport she had found in the body's wallet.  \"Wayne Lotson.\"\n\nWesson nodded. \"Mr. Lotson was killed of his own free will, or otherwise convinced into it.\"\n\n\"That's a bold statement,\" Ebony said as she crossed her arms. \"How do you figure that?\"\n\n\"Because his hands weren't bound, there's no other injury on the body, and like you said, he was kneeling. The angle of his neck muscles confirm a single clean cut, probably from an ax, hewn straight from nape to throat. I just wasn't sure if he had been standing or kneeling.  Look.\"  Wesson guided them over to the stump, knelt down, and traced his finger over it. Three deep wedge marks could be seen, one still entrenched with bloodstains.  \"These two marks were made separate from the big one here. That means Mr. Lotson observed the first two blows, and didn't run off before, during, or after they were made. The third one did him in.\"\n\n\"Are you sure those other two marks weren't made after he was killed?\" Smith said. Wesson shoved his hands in his pockets.\n\n\"There's blood in only one of those marks. If our killer had made those other two later, they'd be stained. One and two missed, I'm guessing deliberately, while the third hit. Then he was dragged away and left to rot. Still no idea where the head went. Hell of a way to kill a guy.\"\n\nThe trio was silent for a few seconds as they processed everything.\n\n\"Well,\" Ebony murmured, \"we know the Where and How. Now all that's left is the Who and Why.\"\n\n\"HEY DANA!!\"  Startled, the trio jerked around, seeing a young man waving frantically as he ran at them.\n\n\"Partner?\" Wesson said.\n\n\"Yeah. Dana Allen.\"\n\n\"Wait, so you two have the same first name?\"  Wesson snorted.  \"That won't get confusing.\"\n\n\"Dana,\" the man gasped as he approached them, \"call me 'some kind of wonderful', cuz' I got us a //witness//!\"  He skidded to a halt and made a face as he saw the body.  \"Eugh!

Sorry for coming here so late.\"\n\n\"It's fine, I'm still a bit too high-strung to sleep. Get you a water?\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"  He found two inside the mini-fridge; they sat across from each other, only a small table dividing them.\n\n\"So what's up? Still worried about that body?\"\n\n\"Listen, Wesson -- umm, //Rave//, if I may?\"  He gestured in the affirmative. \"Um, yeah. Call me Ronnie. Look, I feel like I should come clean with you. You seem...trustworthy.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" he grunted as he shifted in his seat. \"Don't you think you're being a bit naive? You've only known me for a few hours.\"\n\n\"Well, I don't have much of a choice,\" Smith murmured. \"I'm short on time and I can't do this alone.\" Wesson sighed in consternation, so she simply pressed onward.  \"Just listen, Rave. I'm...not really a Fed.\"\n\n\"I figured,\" he shrugged, causing her to recoil.\n\n\"You did? Um, how?\"  He sipped from his drink.\n\n\"Because Captain 'Big' Edison Horne died of a heart attack a year ago, five years after retiring. Anyone from Forty-nine would know that.\"\n\n\"You said he owed you a dinner.\"\n\n\"That was a test on my part. I needed to know if you were on the level.\"\n\nShe cringed. \"And I failed. So why didn't you call me out on it?\"\n\n\"Because you made me realize this was no ordinary murder.  Think about it,\" he pointed:  \"I'm sent out here to investigate something far below my pay grade, when suddenly //another// agent sweeps in, claiming she's here to help. Suddenly the plot thickens, and I'd like to know why. So, I just went with it.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well,\" she sighed, \"I really am sorry. But I have my reasons.\"\n\n\"Don't we all.\"  He mutely apologized, urging her to continue.\n\n\"Just listen, and don't freak out:  I'm with an organization called the Serpent's Hand. I was sent here on assignment to track down Vernon Cabal. You might have caught me staring at him.\"\n\n\"Might have.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well...that's because...\"  Smith sighed, deflating in preemptive defeat. \"He's what's known as a narrative construct, a living real-life work of fiction. Think of it like...Sleeping Beauty or Peter Pan coming to life, walking around in the real world.\"\n\n\"All right,\" he replied nonchalantly. \"So that would make Mr. Cabal...who, exactly? Hercules?\"\n\n\"No:  Paul Bunyan.\"\n\nWesson nodded.  \"So it isn't just an uncanny resemblance.\"\n\n\"No,\" she whispered. \"I'm almost entirely certain that we spoke with the construct of Paul Bunyan today. I've been sent here to...bring him back with me to the Wanderer's Library, where he belongs. Him and any other...uh...\"\n\n\"Living manifestations of fictional characters?\"\n\nSmith offered a disquieting grin. \"You're taking this very well, Rave.\"\n\n\"I'm with the UIU,\" he waved dismissively, \"I see bullshit like this all the time. Er,\" he gruffly corrected, \"not that I'm saying you're full of it, though. So what do I need to do?\"\n\n\"Find Cabal again and take me to him, alone. I'll handle things from there.\"\n\n\"Do you think there'll be trouble?\"\n\n\"I'm sure that,\" she began, but was interrupted by a knock on the door. Wesson muttered something about it being a busy night and called out; it was Ebony. He glanced at Smith and opened the door.\n\n\"Hey,\" she said, \"Allen just called me. He's got a lead. Oh, good, you're both here.\"\n\n\"A bit late in the evening for a lead, isn't it?\" Wesson grumbled. Ebony gave him an apologetic expression.\n\n\"You did say you were too high-strung to sleep,\" Smith reminded him. He shrugged and resigned himself to a late night. They set out at once and drove to the location Allen gave them. The road ended close to a long-abandoned cabin, with nothing to see by but the distant glow of the moon and the frantic jerking of a flashlight, provided by Allen.\n\n\"What in the world brought you all the way out here?\" Wesson demanded. Allen, eyes and teeth flashing with zeal, approached with a small sealed glass tube in tow. He opened his mouth but shut it just as quickly when he saw Smith and Wesson.\n\n\"You brought them?\" he said to Ebony. Her eyes glinted in warning.\n\n\"Yes. Why wouldn't I?\"\n\nHe blinked, momentarily confused. \"Oh, right. That makes sense. Anyway, look! [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6800|Ash]]]!\"  He gave the tube to Ebony, emblazoning it with his flashlight. Ebony carefully flicked the glass with her finger. They murmured incoherently between one another for a moment, prompting Wesson to approach.\n\n\"What's that you got there? New evidence?\"\n\n\"Just some ash from a cigar, I think,\" Ebony said. Wesson snorted.\n\n\"You brought us out here in the middle of nowhere, in the middle of the night, right next to the cabin from //Evil Dead// for cigar ash?\"\n\n\"Ha!\" Allen chirped. \"Nice reference!\"\n\n\"Shut up, Allen,\" Ebony grumbled. She reached to open her suitcase to store the ash, but stopped short as a low rumbling caused everyone to jump. They froze. Another rumble. Another. The forest shivered black in the darkness. Birds screamed as their sleep was broken. Another rumble. The tube was forgotten as all the agents drew their firearms.\n\n\"Shit,\" Wesson growled, \"//now// what?\"\n\nThe forest trembled again. The veil of branches was parted as a massive hand pierced their boughs. Something emerged:  gargantuan, nearly as large as the trees themselves, wispy and thin with vaguely humanoid features. Next to it was an enormous bull, coals for eyes and fire for breath, horns like spears, muscles rippling with titanic power.  Wesson's eyes flared open in astonishment but he kept his cool.\n\n\"Stay calm, all of you,\" Ebony intoned. \"No sudden movements.\"\n\nThe creature's body cracked and split, issuing a noise like moaning wind, like breaking branches, like stones smashing against one another. It was, in defiance of all sense, speaking.\n\nIt then advanced, the bull roaring at its side, the world shuddering with every step.\n\nEbony cursed and everyone opened fire.  Wesson ran as the bull's horns carved trenches into the soil. Ebony dove, dropping her weapon, as the tall wood-creature swung. Allen roared and continued to fire.\n\n\"Go! I'll cover you!\"  The attack barely served as an annoyance, but it got the creature's attention. Ebony scrambled for her firearm as it stormed after Allen, pealing like thunder. Allen stumbled, the creature lunged--\n\nAnd just as suddenly, stopped. Its immense limbs raised, covering what appeared to be a face, and it made a gurgling sound akin to revulsion. Allen just stood there gawking.\n\n\"Wait,\" he said softly. Before the large creature could recover, he reached into his pocket and took out a packet of salt he had removed from the diner. His fingers slipped trying to open it, but in no time a hail of white granules sprayed in the air. Allen lashed the tiny packet like a whip as he shouted:\n\n\"Bastard! Asshole! Hellfire and damnation! Shit-faced!\"\n\nThe tall creature groaned, and to the amazement of everyone there, withdrew as if offended by the vulgarity, slipping into the darkness of the forest with its companion in tow. The night's silence returned as if nothing had happened.\n\n\"Wesson,\" Ebony called, securing her firearm, \"you okay?\"  He nodded, covered in grass and dirt though he was.\n\n\"Yeah. You?\"\n\n\"I'm not hurt. Allen, how about you?\"\n\nAllen stood amazed, hyperventilating.\n\n\"Allen!\"\n\n\"Holy shit!\" he roared, walking ahead as if in a daze. He stared at Ebony and Wesson, livid with excitement. \"That was a goddamn leshy!\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8514/Leshy_%281906%29.jpg\n|caption=A depiction of SCP-8514, Variant-3\n|width=300px\n|align=center]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: green; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n//Once upon a time, there lived a kindly old fairy in [[span style=\"color:green\"]]**a city concealed beneath a well**[[/span]]. This fairy loved the city, but it seemed to have changed overnight. Where once the fairy saw friends and loved ones smiling, there was gossip, cold stares, envious whispers, malice. The fairy knew that their friends were jealous, because they did not have what the fairy now possessed:  they did not have a Name. Growing discomforted with their behavior, the fairy left [[span style=\"color:green\"]]**the sylvan realm of the nameless**[[/span]], and returned to the forest, where it could be away from the spiteful eyes of its friends, and listen to the wind and the water and the leaves instead.//\n\n//Unfortunately, the soothing song of the woods was broken that day, for a group of men had gathered to cut down the trees. The fairy knew that it was the habit of men to claim parts of the grove for themselves, but only at need, and would leave gifts for the fairy in exchange. These men, however, hacked and burned without pity or pause, without regard or remorse, leaving nothing but the lamentations of the fallen. This enraged the fairy, and it used its great magic to transform into a mighty warrior. It set upon the men with great anger and furious vengeance, using the very weapon they had wielded against them, and did not stop until every last fallen oak, beech, chestnut, willow, and pine was accounted for. With justice meted out, it returned to its original form, and secluded itself in the woods to bask in its victory.//\n\n//The next day, men returned to claim the bodies of their fallen comrades. Many of them left gifts for the fairy -- not out of love or reverence, but in fear. The fairy took them all the same, and was proud of the power it now wielded. There would be no whispers of jealousy here:  only emboldening terror and respect. Here, at last, it could have a home, for it now had a Name, and what more beyond that could it want?//\n\n//The years waned. Stories began to spread of the creature, of its malice and mystery, of how it could be offended or appeased. Stories also began to weave of the Warrior, the arbiter of nature's vengeance, keeping eternal vigil against the iniquities of the civilized world. Men still cut and burned and cleared the forest, but many also tended and cared for it, loving it as the fairy loved. It came to pass that these men would wear sashes woven with linden, identifying themselves as friend and ally, a ward against the warden. The fairy wondered at these men, and whether they were truly of the same kind as those who spread destruction. It meditated upon these matters in solitude and silence, passing into the mists of legend, to be remembered only in whispers.//\n\n//It is said that no one has seen the fairy since.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Dyne:**  What the heck's a leshy?\n\n**Wesson:**  A Russo-Scandinavian forest spirit.\n\n**Dyne:**  Oh really?

Wesson tried to keep his balance, but the ground felt spongy, like it was churning underneath him, and the air was difficult to breathe. Birds cackled as trees slapped him with their leaves; stones sprang out of nowhere to stub his toe; puddles bubbled up from the grass to saturate him. He found a dew-soaked bench and laid his coat across it so he could sit in peace; as he did so, a hornet landed on his hand.\n\n\"Whaddyou want?\" he grumbled. He shook it loose and eyed it carefully, but was distracted by a large shape moving in the distance. His sleepless indignation was immediately discarded as he sat up, wide-eyed, staring at the object. It moved like an enormous river, weaving with effortless grace through the bracken, Job's Biblical behemoth come into the world to terrorize -- or rule -- or liberate...\n\nWesson rose, forgetting his coat, and drew closer, heedless of any danger. The shape turned and evaded him, but a second figure followed, an accomplice or parasite or...or shepherd. This was no tree-spirit, though, but a figure almost human, seemingly stone but covered completely in moss. It followed close behind the behemoth, making no more noise than its ward, ignorant of its surveyor.\n\nNot wanting to risk drawing its attention, Wesson halted only a few steps into his venture, content to stand and observe. He made no move, save to blink, and bit his lip to assure himself this was real. Even so, he was noticed:  the moss-man jerked its head, focusing on him, and breached the gulf between them with a lordly stride. Wesson stiffened but remained still. The moss-man carried with him a shield, and a great battle-ax, its head hewn into helm. It made a sound, perhaps a speech, but Wesson didn't understand any of it.\n\n\"I'm not here to cause trouble,\" he stated calmly. \"If you're some spirit of the Dakota or Chippewa, I'll be happy to leave you in peace. I'm just here to solve a murder.\"\n\nHe eyed the ax.\n\n\"It's a nice park,\" he added, perhaps foolishly. The moss-man slowly raised a hand -- it could have been a gauntlet -- pointing at Wesson, speaking again. Wesson sighed and shook his head.  \"I'm sorry, I don't understand you. I'm just another ignorant human who might be--\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Behæs**[[/span]].\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he sighed. An even stupider idea crossed his mind, and he stretched his hand out, palm facing up. \"Um...pax?\"\n\nThe moss-man grunted. \"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Videbimus quod.**[[/span]]\"[[footnote]] \"We shall see about that.\"[[/footnote]]\n\n\"So you speak Latin. Good to know.  Umm...\"  Wesson awkwardly hemmed, but was spared further discourse as a commanding voice called out:\n\n\"Drop your weapon! Hands on your head, knees on the ground! NOW!\"\n\nHe sighed. Ebony. \"You two have the //worst// timi--\"\n\n\"You too, Wesson!\" Allen barked. \"Hands up! Don't move!\"\n\n\"Oh, come on,\" he groaned, \"seriously?\" He half-turned, observing that Allen and Ebony were definitely serious, and made an indolent show of compliance. Allen disarmed him while Ebony kept her eyes on the moss-man. It had not let go of its ax.\n\n\"Last warning!\" Ebony shouted. \"Disarm or I'll put one right in your fairy face!\"\n\n\"I'm pretty sure a bullet won't do you much good, Eb,\" Wesson mumbled.  Ebony smirked.\n\n\"It will if it's a thaumaturge-infused bullet with an iron casing.\"\n\nWhether out of defense or defiance, the moss-man advanced, its ax glinting emerald in the sunrise. Allen got off one round, which stopped the creature, but seemed to do no damage. It regarded the wound in its chest with nonchalance and shook its head. Its voice came out in undulations, an earthquake of retribution, and raised its weapon to kill. Allen backpedaled as Ebony opened fire, but the creature deflected the shots with its shield, growling.\n\n\"Whoa, whoa, whoa!\"  Wesson darted between them, an improvised arbiter.  \"Hey now,\" he said, \"let's not lose our cool, all right? Like I said, none of us want to cause any trouble! We're //just// here to solve a murder! Okay? Lay off the guy, he's twitchy.\"  Wesson stared intently at the moss-man, arms outstretched, anxious to see what would transpire. The creature slowly calmed down, lowered its weapon, and grunted. It jammed a rust-green finger at Wesson once again:\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Behæs**[[/span]].\"\n\nThen without any further ado, it slipped into the darkness of the woods and was gone. All three agents loosened a sigh of relief.\n\n\"Not too bad there, Wess,\" Allen admitted. \"I guess I owe you one.\"\n\n\"Yeah, no kidding,\" he spat: \"and since when do Foundation agents shoot first and ask questions later?\"\n\n\"What are you talking about?\" Ebony said indignantly.\n\n\"I mean you're with the SCP Foundation. I've known since yesterday afternoon.\"\n\n\"I think the lack of sleep is affecting your brain, Wess,\" Allen pointed. Wesson rolled his eyes.\n\n\"Look, you can think I'm stupid all you want, just don't //treat// me like I'm stupid, all right? I knew you were Foundation from the scars in your forearms.\"  Allen and Ebony stared quizzically at each other, so Wesson explained:  \"When Eb came back from the bathroom during lunch, I noticed a very distinct scar on her forearm before she rolled her sleeve up. It's from where they implant your microchip tracking device. Look, I've seen them before.\"\n\nAllen and Ebony exchanged another silent, disquieting expression.\n\n\"I guess there's no point in subterfuge anymore,\" Ebony relented. There seemed no point in brandishing guns, either, so they holstered them again.\n\n\"Can I have mine while you're at it?\" Wesson said. Allen glanced at his partner.\n\n\"I dunno. The Foundation and the UIU are, um...\"\n\n\"Ambivalent relations, I know. Look, we don't have to be friends, but we don't have to be enemies, either. I'm willing to cooperate if you'll trust me -- or do you really think I'll shoot you in the back?\"\n\nAllen considered it carefully. Gingerly, he reached for Wesson's sidearm, turned it, and hovered it before him.\n\n\"Like I said, I owe you one.\"\n\n\"Thanks,\" Wesson said as he took his gun back, \"and don't worry about it. These things happen all the time in our line of work. I'm guessing the Foundation's angle is containing that leshy -- and maybe that armored green guy as well.\"\n\n\"More or less,\" Ebony confirmed. \"We received reports from civilians about a giant blue steer wandering around. Allen and I were sent from two different MTF squads--\"\n\n\"Hogtown Garrison and the Green Stags,\" he interrupted. Ebony nodded.\n\n\"To investigate. So yes, it would seem we are on the same side. At least for now.\"\n\n\"That's good enough for me,\" Wesson exclaimed. He walked over to his discarded coat, flapping the dew out before donning it again. \"By the way, I don't suppose either one of you is a linguist? That guy, or...that thing said something to me that stuck out. Does 'Behæs' mean anything?\"\n\n\"It's Old English,\" Allen answered. \"It loosely means 'vow', or 'oath'.\"\n\n\"Hmm. Is it weird that that somehow makes sense?\"\n\n\"In our line of work?\" Ebony remarked, raising her eyebrow. \"The abnormal is normal. Still, a man in green armor speaking Old English in central Minnesota--\"\n\n\"Oh my god!!\" Allen roared suddenly. He stood gawking and grasped his head in dramatic surprise. \"Vernon Cabal!\"\n\n\"What about him?\" Wesson said. Allen's eyes bulged frantically.\n\n\"Don't you get it? VERNON -- VERDE -- GREEN!  CABAL -- CABALLERO -- KNIGHT!  Vernon Cabal is that Green Knight!\"\n\nEbony sighed in disgrace, covering her face with her palm. \"Shut up, Allen.\"\n\n\"That is a pretty big stretch,\" Wesson grunted as he crossed his arms. He scrunched his face in grim consideration.  \"Still, Smith was keen on tracking him down.  She claimed to be part of this group called the Serpent's Hand; does that mean anything to you two?\"\n\nAllen and Ebony gave each other a concerned expression.\n\n\"Yeah, it does,\" she said.  \"I think Mr. Cabal bears another investigation.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8514/Sancho_Martin_the_Green_knight.jpg\n|caption=A depiction of SCP-8514, Variant-2\n|width=350px\n|align=center]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"background: green; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n//Once upon a time, there lived a fairy named Otcovský Strom, Father Tree, who heard about a New World across a vast ocean.

Drawn by the promises of adventure and curiosity, Otcovský Strom used its magic to assume Milesian shape, and sailed with the Suehans until they reached the New World.// \n\n//It followed them west, across great plains and mighty rivers, finding forests to the north that sang a bittersweet song of familiarity and freshness.

Going on fumes, a rushed breakfast, intuition, and an unhealthy dose of curiosity and obsession, they split up to search the park. Wesson called in a few favors and had the park rangers form a perimeter around the entire area, as well as every hotel, cabin, and trailer park; he took to the woods while Allen directed the rangers and Ebony combed the rivers.\n\n\"Where the hell am I gonna start?\" he muttered, sighing and plunging his hands in his coat pockets. It had been relatively warm the last few days, but an unusual chill was creeping in. Wesson girded himself for a long day and started walking, taking to the trails first. Noon came and went, with only a brief pause for a mushy overpriced club sandwich, and dinner wasn't any more dignified, a rushed bowl of dry spaghetti and meatballs held in a noisy cafeteria. Cabal still hadn't been found when they lost the day's light, and Wesson was too weary to continue the hunt despite their urgency. He only had time to shower and set his alarm before crashing and blacking out.\n\nThe next day was bright but bone-cold, wisps of cloud escaping with every breath. Wesson picked up right where he left off, keeping in touch with Allen and Ebony as he eliminated one possibility after another. There was still no word on Smith -- or the leshy, the behemoth, or the moss-man -- and any trace of Lotson's remains were lost with her. Wesson had vaguely entertained the idea of Cabal or Smith being responsible for the body's removal, but unless they genuinely had magic powers, and were able to be in two places at once -- they had been with him in the diner when the corpse vanished -- then it was just another dead end. He was trying to figure out why that cigar ash was so significant when the distinct sound of metal striking wood diverted his attention.\n\n//Tok. Tok. Tok.

Sounds like quite the pilgrimage.\"\n\nVernon paused, then placed a log on a stump. He cleaved it perfectly in two with one blow.\n\n\"Yah, sure is. I like to travel. But I also like to feel settled, y'know. Sometimes it's good to rest your bones.\"\n\n\"You mind if I join you?\"  Vernon grinned, clutching his ax: perhaps in pride, perhaps in preparation.\n\n\"Cutting logs?\"\n\n\"No, just to sit down. I feel tired as hell.\"\n\n\"Sure. You can borrow that chair over there.\"  He indicated a large, handmade wooden chair that sapped all the strength out of Wesson when he sat in it.\n\n\"You gonna be okay?\"\n\n\"Yah, I don't mind standing.\"  He cut another log, then tended to the skillet. He grinned proudly at Wesson. \"Almost done. You had breakfast yet?\"\n\n\"Yeah, at the hotel.\"\n\n\"I don't really care for their food. Too artificial. There's nothing like cooking a meal outdoors, over an open fire, especially if you just caught it yourself an hour ago.\"\n\n\"Hmm,\" Wesson shrugged. \"You lead quite the masculine life, if you don't mind my saying.\"\n\nVernon laughed loudly, cleaving another log.\n\n\"Sure do!\" he bellowed, then resumed singing:  \"//Freude, schöner Götterfunken, Tochter aus Elysium, Wir betreten feuertrunken, Himmlische, dein Heiligtum//!\"\n\n\"Quite a life,\" Wesson murmured to himself. He coughed. \"Listen, Vern, about that body we showed you the other day, the one with the missing head.\"\n\n\"Yah? You find out who did it?\"\n\n//Tok.//\n\n\"It's gone.\"\n\n\"Who, the killer?\"\n\n\"The body. Completely gone, no trace. Some weird things have been going on here, Vern.\"\n\n\"Oh yah?\" he said nonchalantly. //Tok//. \"Well, this part of the country is pretty old.  Anishinaabe territory. Countless generations of men and women, thousands of years before European settlers. That kind of history has an effect on the land, if ya don't mind me getting too spiritual.\"\n\n\"Not at all.\"\n\n//Tok. Tok.//\n\n\"Speaking of the Anishinaabe, they have a legend about Red Lake. They say it was formed when a trickster god fought a giant. It was one of them battles that took three days and three nights, y'know. In the end, the trickster god won by slapping the giant with a fish he pulled out of a river. He landed right flat on his bottom, and that formed the lake.\"\n\nWesson chuckled softly. Vernon laughed as well, but there was danger twinkling in his eyes.\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" he murmured, \"that sure was a good fight.\"\n\nHe split another log. Another. Another. //Tok//.\n\n\"You ever see or heard of,\" Wesson began, when he was interrupted. A large steer, larger than any he had seen, meandered into view, wisdom and patience in its dull dark eyes. Vernon stopped what he was doing and caressed the steer's head.\n\n\"Hi, Babe. Yah, I've got company today. Yah, I know, it's a shame. I wish it could've gone on a bit longer. But I had to do it. It would've killed the others. Yah, I miss him, too. But he'll be all right, don't you worry.\"\n\n\"What would've killed the others, Vern?\" Wesson called. Vernon pointed his thumb at the lumber pile.\n\n\"This here dogwood. It's got a disease that would've spread to the whole forest if I hadn't chopped it down. Ya gotta do that sometimes, clear away the dead and dying, or the ones choking out new life. It hurts, but you gotta do it, because it'll hurt more if ya don't. It's one pain or the other. Just be sure to give back what ya took. Plant two trees for every one, and plant em' proper. There's the joy, the other side of the coin. Pain and joy.\"\n\nHe scratched behind the steer's ear and sent it away with a firm pat.\n\n\"Vern,\" Wesson said, \"have you ever seen or heard--\"\n\n\"I killed Wayne Lotson.\"  He turned around, no longer smiling, large enough to block the rising sun, clutching an ax drenched in the blood of trees. \"Is that what you want me to say? Is that why you came here?\"\n\n\"Is that a confession, Vern?\"\n\nThe two men stared at each other in silence.\n\n\"Your meal's burning, Vern. Tend to that first, then we'll talk.\"\n\nHe grunted and shuffled over to his skillet. \"Not quite the last meal I had in mind.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to kill you, Vern, I just want the truth. Look, I don't know why you're mixed up in all this. You, Lotson, Agent Smith, cigar ash...there's some forest-spirit and a man running around in green armor...\"\n\nVernon scooped the fish onto a plate, drizzling it in fat. When he stood, a suit of green armor had taken his place. Wesson stared nervously.\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Shall we play a game, Raven Wesson?**[[/span]]\"\n\nWesson rubbed his neck.  \"I'd rather keep my head, if it's all the same to you.\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**I invoke the Binding of Words. You once swore an oath to me, an oath that you only came here to solve a murder. Now you make an oath that you were not sent to kill me, and that you only seek the truth. I wish to bind you to your word.**[[/span]]\"\n\nWesson considered his words carefully.\n\n\"Do I have a choice?\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Are you the sort of man who breaks his word?**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"I try not to be,\" he admitted quietly. He stared at the Green Knight in resignation. \"What do I need to do?\"\n\nThe Knight drew close. \"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Place your hand on my ax and make the oath. Then the game begins.**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"Seems easy enough,\" he murmured. The Knight remained motionless as Wesson did as instructed. \"Um...I'm no good with flowery words.\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**It is enough that the oath is yours.**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"All right,\" he sighed, then cleared his throat and bound himself. The Knight nodded when he had finished.\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**For every truth you tell, I will take one step backwards. When I reach my campfire, you are free. Deceive me once, and your life is forfeit.**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"Just like back at my old fraternity,\" he scowled helplessly. \"All right, um...I was sent here to investigate the murder of a man found decapitated in...damn it, I forgot the name of this park. Uhh...decapitated in this particular area.\"\n\nThe Knight took one step back.\n\n\"I came here alone. I joined up with a woman named Rhonda Smith, and two others, Dana Ebony and Dana Allen. I'm the only one from the FBI, though. The two Danas are from the SCP Foundation, and Smith's...\"\n\nWesson considered his words carefully. He eyed the Knight. The truth.\n\n\"Smith claimed to be part of the Serpent's Hand. I have reason to believe she was lying.\"\n\nAnother step back.\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**What reason is that, Raven Wesson?**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"Her eyes kept changing color,\" he gestured. \"Sometimes blue or red or yellow or...like, a rainbow kaleidoscope. And she never touched silverware, or...or anything that had any iron. Always wore gloves instead. Kind of a weird detail, but...\"\n\nAnother step back.\n\n\"And I ain't gonna kill you. That's not my job. I don't even think I could, even if I wanted to.\"\n\nAnother step back. The Knight was almost at the campfire.\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**If it turns out I killed Wayne Lotson, and you can prove it, what will you do?**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"I honestly don't know,\" Wesson murmured. \"God as my witness, I don't know. It's not like I can arrest Paul Bunyan, or whatever you are. Uh...I'd probably report it to my bosses at the department. It'd be in their hands then. Not my problem.\"\n\nThe Knight's hands clutched tightly to the ax handle.\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**You are a slovenly, apathetic man, Raven Wesson.**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'll own up to that. It's gotten me in trouble before. But I think it's saved my sorry hide a few times, too.\"\n\nThe Knight relaxed its grip and took another step back.\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Dana Allen must pay for what he did to me. I must have justice. What do you say to that?**[[/span]]\"\n\n\"Look, it was an accident, okay? You went after us, the guy got excited, he fired a shot... He's a good agent, he's just wet behind the ears. He doesn't deserve -- look, if you're that upset about it, I'll take his place, all right? Leave Allen alone and do what you have to do to me. I'm old, tired, washed-up, I stopped caring about everything a long time ago, I got nothing to lose...\"\n\n\"[[span style=\"color:green\"]]**Do you bind yourself to that?**[[/span]]\"\n\nWesson swallowed.  Nodded.\n\n\"Yeah. I do.\"\n\nThe Knight gestured to the stump. Wesson took a deep breath. Approached. Stared down. Went to his knees. Placed his head down. Waited.\n\n//Tok.//\n\nWatched as a log split in two and fell over.\n\n\"And that's the last one for the day,\" he heard Vernon say. The other man laughed softly and helped Wesson stand. He rubbed his neck.\n\n\"Not sure what to say to that,\" he admitted quietly.  \"I guess it wasn't a coincidence after all.\"\n\n\"What wasn't?\"\n\n\"Your name.  Allen thought it had something to do with the Spanish translation for Green Knight.\"\n\nVernon chuckled.  \"And here I thought I was being clever.  Maybe I should've used a different language.\"  He smiled, but his smile faded just as quickly. Danger sparked in his eyes.\n\n\"Drop your weapon, Mr. Cabal. I'm placing you under arrest.\"\n\nWesson sighed. \"Are we doing this again, Allen? How long have you been there, anyway?\"\n\n\"I came in right before he tried to kill you.\"\n\n\"He didn't...\"  Wesson grunted, exasperated.  \"Could you just relax?  I'm starting to get deja vu here.\"\n\n\"I'm not pointing the gun at you, Wess. Only Mr. Green Knight here.\"\n\n\"Feels like you're pointing it at me.\"\n\nAllen adjusted his aim. Now there was no question.\n\n\"Arrest, eh?\" Vernon grumbled. He chuckled and walked over to a large sequoia. He touched the bark, caressed it, put one arm around it, and uprooted the entire tree in a single motion. He rested the trunk casually on his shoulder.  \"All right.  Arrest me!\"\n\n\"Wow,\" Allen whispered. \"Just like Lu Zhishen in //The Water Margin//!\"\n\n\"Shut up, Allen,\" Wesson grumbled. Cabal shoved the sequoia back in place, root and all, waiting for Allen to make his move. He never got the chance, as Wesson felt the steely barrel of a gun nudging against his spine.\n\n\"You know, I'm getting real tired of people pointing guns at me!\" he yelled. Cold feminine laughter answered him.\n\n\"I'm flattered you noticed my eyes, little Raven. It's just too bad they were my downfall. I'm rather fond of them.\"\n\n\"Hi, Smith,\" he sighed. \"I guess that bit about the Serpent's Hand was a lie.\"\n\n\"What better way to gain your trust than to swap out one lie for another?  Just admit you're deceptive...\"\n\n\"And people tend to believe you,\" he finished. \"Smart. So I guess the Seelie Court has business with Mr. Cabal as well.\"\n\nSmith chuckled. \"Very perceptive, Raven. Did my iron aversion give me away?\"\n\nAllen suddenly spun around, shifting his aim.\n\n\"Drop it, Smith! Or whatever your name is!\"\n\nShe laughed. \"And give up my Milesian shield?\"\n\n\"Do what he says, Sidhe,\" came another voice. Smith bit her lip. She hadn't noticed Ebony coming in from behind, still armed with her Fey-killing weapon. \"We can handle this peacefully or we can have a perforated fairy on the ground. I'm fine either way.\"  She gestured to Allen and Wesson. \"Stay cool, both of you. I got this.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Allen taunted, \"this is a real Mexican stand-off, isn't it?

There would be no victory for her here, no way to accomplish her mission -- not yet, at least. Best to cut her losses and try again some other time. Maybe when there weren't so many humans around.\n\n\"Well?\" Ebony demanded. \"What'll it be, Sidhe?\"\n\n\"Better decide soon,\" Wesson murmured. \"The Foundation's not afraid to sacrifice others. How about you?\"\n\nRhonda Smith chuckled coldly as she pressed the gun into Wesson's back. \"Don't worry, Raven, I'm not going to kill you. Do you know why?\"\n\n\"Because I'm not worth wasting a perfectly good bullet on?\"\n\n\"There is that,\" she admitted. \"But I'd rather not have any of your filthy blood splashing on me.

Allen and Ebony remained on guard.\n\n\"However,\" Rhonda Smith added, \"since I can't have you following me...\"  She then arced her gun and fired, shooting Allen in the foot. He crumpled immediately, howling.\n\n\"AAAAOOOOOOWWWW!!!  Mother fucker!!\"\n\n\"Babe!\" Vernon shouted at the same moment. Before anyone could react, a massive blue bull stormed across the campsite. It pierced its horn through Rhonda Smith's torso and rammed into a redwood with the force of an earthquake. Rhonda Smith cried out but still had enough sense to grasp the tree and meld into it, disappearing. The redwood slowly teetered and crashed to the ground, dislodging from the bull's horn.\n\nAllen was in too much pain to offer any comment.\n\n\"You'll be all right, Allen,\" Ebony assured him, her own face a sheen of cold sweat. \"Just lie down, I'll call for backup.\"\n\n\"Easy for you to say,\" he managed.

The pilgrim passed his hand over the sentinels of the forest, feeling the life they exuded. This one was young and eager; that one firm, stretching, growing; here, an august elder, playing with the wind; there, one quietly sleeping, drinking deep the draught of the sun. He soon found what he was looking for: one who was bent, gnarled, selfish, their growth stifling others. Even as he set his ax to it, though, the pilgrim felt a twinge of sorrow. It must be done, though, for the forest proper to live, so he set to his task.\n\n//Tok. Tok.//\n\nHe ended its suffering mercifully, and only at the point where the guardian's growth had gone wrong. In no time at all it would resume its proper course, and would, perhaps, thank him. Meanwhile the wood would fetch a good price, perhaps being made into a cabinet or doorway, maybe even a toy, or...\n\n\"So it's true,\" a voice called out to him:  \"Otcovský Strom is out chopping down the forests he once swore to protect.\" He turned, thrilled with excitement, knowing that tone from anywhere. The only thing preventing him from embracing One Who Was Greatly Longed For was their accusation.\n\n\"Old friend!\" he exclaimed. He hesitated, his words stuck in his throat, caught between adulation and guilt. He swallowed. \"You look very well. It has been too long.\"\n\n\"Only for you,\" retorted One Who Measures Differently. \"Your account of time has changed. You've assumed Milesian shape for too long.\"\n\n\"Scarcely three-hundred of their years, and a handful more,\" the pilgrim replied defensively. \"I was avenging the forests you accuse me of destroying for nearly twice that time.\"\n\nOne Who Remained Without Name approached the pilgrim, feeling his clothes, pulling on his beard.\n\n\"Is this what being Named does?  Drive you from your home, cause you to forsake your people?\"\n\n\"I was given Name,\" he whispered. \"I could not refuse.\"\n\n\"No. But you could have remained.\"\n\n\"And done what, friend?\" the pilgrim snapped, pushing away. \"While away in councils of war and invasion? Let the memory of the past fester inside me, as disease festers inside these roots? Sit idly as my loved ones glare at me in envy? I...\"  He faltered, choking, leaned against a redwood. \"I could not stay. To remain would be to invite stagnation. The seed that lingers in the ground does not grow.\"\n\n\"But the root remains firmly planted,\" countered One Who is Bitter.  \"You ripped yours away, turning your back on those you claim to love.\"\n\n\"There are woods aplenty here,\" the pilgrim muttered. \"And t'was here that we met.\"  The pilgrim finally managed a smile. \"Met and fought.\"\n\n\"Hmph,\" the Former Resident grunted, smirking. \"I'll wager you still have bruises.\"\n\n\"None so painful as the ones I dealt to you.\"\n\nThe Once-Bruised Friend smiled, nodding wistfully. But that feeling passed. \"I was once as a god in this realm. The people did me reverence, gave gifts. I even had...my own Name. But it has been forgotten. Yours...remains.\"\n\n\"I've had many names,\" the pilgrim sighed gruffly. \"Otcovský Strom and Apostle-Pilgrim brought me fame, Verde-Caballero brought isolation. These days I am content with the latter.\"  The pilgrim turned to his friend, touching their shoulder, recalling ancient camaraderie. \"Why have you come? To judge me? To rekindle our friendship? If it is war you wage, I no longer have the heart.\"\n\n\"I have been directed to retrieve you.\"\n\n\"For what purpose?\"\n\n\"To come home.\"\n\n\"Then I ask again,\" the pilgrim grumbled impatiently, \"why are you here?\"  The One Sent to Retrieve gawked, stuttering, but could not answer.\n\n\"We will talk. You will tell the others how to acquire Names of their own. We will...  You will be great again.\"\n\n\"I no longer care for greatness,\" Apostle-Pilgrim stated. \"As for how to acquire names, I do not know. T'was a free act of Milesians.\"\n\n\"As was their robbery of our station!\"\n\n\"Aye,\" the Verde Caballero sighed. \"They have taken. They took our Names and they took the woods. But they give as well, often out of love.\"\n\n\"Or fear,\" One Whose Blood Still Boiled reminded him. Father Tree withdrew.\n\n\"I say again, I do not have the heart for war. I have killed enough already. Let me regrow now.\"\n\nOne Who Had Lost their Name eyed Otcovský Strom's ax.\n\n\"Regrow,\" it stated coldly. Paul Bunyan sighed. Their eyes met. \"I invoke the Right of Contest,\" the Friend from the Other Realm stated coldly. \"We shall wager on it. You will be my prize.\" \n\nFather Tree stared in horror at his friend. Did he even know what he was asking?  To invoke something, anything, was to bind one's self to it. It could never be broken, only fulfilled.\n\n\"I do not wish to play games. Leave me to my work. There are trees dying in these woods.\"\n\n\"Name your prize,\" the Invoker of Contests commanded. The One with Names sighed.\n\n\"My freedom. My life is yours to command should I lose.\"\n\n\"And mine is forfeit should I lose.\"\n\n\"Old friend, do not--\"\n\n\"What do you think they will do to me if I return empty-handed?\" the Frightful Visitor hissed. Their eyes met again, each pleading in desperation. \"I would rather trust your ax over their sentence. Please.\"\n\nPaul felt himself grow cold. He nodded.\n\n\"Tell me your rules.\"\n\n\"We shall each speak two truths and one lie. Whoever cannot distinguish the lie loses the contest. As I made the Invocation, and set the rules, you will begin first.\"\n\nThe Green Knight swallowed. Cleared his throat. Felt his ax weigh heavy in his hand.\n\n\"The first name given to me was Otcovský Strom, 'Father Tree'. I have never slain a man bearing linden. You defeated me using the tusk of a boar.\"\n\n\"The third statement is a lie. You made it too easy.\"  The Other Contestant drew a deep breath. \"The people who once named me are still alive. My children ask about you regularly. I still think of you as a friend.\"\n\n\"The Anishinaabe are no more. That was the lie. We are at stalemate.\"\n\n\"Then we begin again.\"\n\n\"My friend...\"\n\n\"Begin again!\" he snapped. The Apostle-Pilgrim shrank. He felt sick, helpless, defeated.\n\n\"I came here with a tribe called the Geats. I had mushroom and potato stew for lunch today. I can read Milesian letters.\"\n\nThe Invoker of Rites curdled its face in contemplation.\n\n\"The first is the lie.\"\n\nPaul nodded.\n\n\"You are the only fighter who has ever matched me in combat. I do not envy you. I came here over a bridge of ice.\"\n\n\"You truly envy me?\" he whispered. The Envious One cast its face away.\n\n\"You have a Name,\" it growled. \"How could I not? Begin again.\"\n\n\"How long will we do this, old friend?\" Paul sighed.\n\n\"As long as necessary.\"\n\nHe shook his head in despair. \"I have a companion I've named Blue. Countless people in this country know my name. I love you.\"\n\n\"You couldn't possibly love me,\" the Old Friend spat. \"Not after what you...\" It gasped as it saw the horror in Father Tree's eyes, the quivering mouth, the tears. \"No!\"\n\nThe contest was over.\n\nAn age, it seemed, passed before either of them moved. The One Who Had Doomed Itself approached the remains of the tree its friend had felled, placing its head on the stump.\n\n\"I Invoked the Rite. I lost the Contest. My life is forfeit. Fulfill your end of the bargain, Otcovský Strom.\"\n\nPaul tightened his grip on the ax. Trudged countless distances to the stump. Raised his judgment.\n\n\"By rite of victory, I deliver to thee thy proclaimed judgment. In this, the Invocation is fulfilled.\"\n\nHe swung down. //Tok//. Missed.\n\n\"Coward!\" the Condemned hissed. \"Have you lost all sense and pride? Does your Word mean nothing to you? You have bound yourself! Fulfill your obligation, Apostle!\"\n\nPaul wept. Tried again. The tears blurred his vision. Missed.\n\n\"There will be others,\" the Old Friend swore. \"When I am gone and my body becomes the Cold Ash, another will take my place, and another, and another. They will forever be at your elbow. Demonstrate to them that you are a Sidhe, or else consign yourself to the realm of Shadows and Air. I command you in the name of Paul Bunyan, and every other Name you were given!\"\n\nPaul took a deep breath. Cleared his vision. Held true to his self. Braced.\n\nLeaned in. Took his friend's hand.\n\n\"Gawain,\" he stated. \"Your Name is Gawain! Do you hear me? You are, and have always been, Gawain, Son of Lot!\"\n\nThe One Who Had Been Newly Named Gawain froze, mouth gasping, eyes glossing over with tears. They fell freely and a shudder of happiness washed over him.\n\n\"It is...a difficult name to pronounce in our tongue. Give me a simpler one, like yours, my friend.\"\n\nPaul swallowed. Held Gawain's hand tight. Trembled. \"Just Wayne, then. Wayne, Lot's son.\"\n\n\"Wayne Lotson,\" whispered he. He smiled, nodding, closed his eyes. \"I am Wayne Lotson now. It is good.

He stood and stretched; Vernon approached him, extending his hand.\n\n\"Don't forget, Raven Wesson:  you gave me your word. I'll hold you to it.\"\n\n\"I appreciate that, Vern.\" They shook hands; Wesson winced. \"Hell of a grip you got there, Paul!\"\n\nBunyan rumbled with soft laughter as he released him. Wesson turned his back and waved as he made his way back to the main road. As he turned a corner, he heard someone humming softly to themselves.\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Wesson:**  And that's it. The Foundation was already on the scene by the time I met up with Allen and Ebony. I told them everything that happened, and they let me keep my memory and gave me that folder as thanks. They even paid for the hotel. Then I flew home, wrote up my report, filed it, and then you two called me out to have our little chat.

One day, as he emerged from his cabin to greet the rising sun, he received a visitor.\n\n\"We meet again, Father Tree.\"  The lumberjack sighed, waving feebly.\n\n\"Hi there, Rhonda Smith. Sorry about last time. How's your injury?\"\n\n\"Forgotten. I've had worse. Your companion...\"\n\n\"Babe,\" he answered. Rhonda smirked.\n\n\"He's quite loyal to you. Turning against a fellow Sidhe is a very serious affair.\"\n\nFather Tree nodded solemnly. \"That it is, Rhonda Smith, that it is indeed. I assume you've come for me as well.\"\n\n\"I'm not going to invoke anything,\" she assured him. \"Wayne Lotson was...impulsive. Desperate. I'm not so easily frightened. If I fail, my punishment won't be so...severe.\"\n\n\"You shouldn't be punished at all,\" he remarked, lifting his axe to profile against the sun. He touched it gingerly, though the iron alloy burned him. \"I left our home of my own free will. I have Names now. I don't want to go back.\"\n\n\"Why?\" she whispered. He set his axe down and began piling logs together for a fire. He had but to touch it and a spark ignited. Carefully he laid a skillet over the flame, holding tight to its wooden handle.\n\n\"Well, I'm at peace here. I know my way around. I go places, meet people; I care for the forest, cutting down diseased trees, clearing out dead ones, planting anew. Win contests.\"\n\n\"Don't you miss your home?\"\n\n\"Home is where the forest lies,\" he stated. He cracked a few eggs over the skillet. \"Hungry?\"\n\nShe made a face. \"For burnt chicken embryos?\"\n\nHe chuckled. \"Don't knock it till' you've tried it. I'll eat anything except beef.\" He nodded at the giant steer, which had now sidled up to Rhonda Smith, wanting to be scratched. She did what it wanted and whispered some words in their ancient tongue.\n\n\"Maybe it's a generational thing,\" Father Tree muttered. He gingerly removed the eggs from the skillet and onto a plate, eating daintily. \"I was one of the old-timers, someone who actually had a Name before...before losing it. I remember going into hiding, and staying there, planning and dreaming my life away. I no longer walked in the woods, or bathed in rivers, or spoke to the animals, or listened to the wind. I no longer curried wonder with men, or found gifts at my threshold, or heard my name in Stories. I guess what I'm trying to say is that...I wasn't //alive//. I was just a Something that didn't have a name, waiting for the day when we'd...I don't know. \n\n\"When I received my Name, I realized what a fool I had been, how wrong I was about the Milesians -- some of them at least -- and I realized that, even if I stayed, everything had changed too much. //I// had changed too much. Being Named gives you a special perspective. There's a kind of beautiful stagnancy in that lost realm, Rhonda Smith, but I chose growth, running rivers, breezes blowing, life and death, pain and joy...and I paid the price. That's the best way I can describe it.\"\n\nRhonda crossed her arms, glancing away in contemplation. The wind picked up, blowing away the scent of eggs, supplanting it with the fragrance of an early autumn.\n\n\"And now, I think, you have a choice of your own to make.\"  Paul Bunyan smiled at her, his large eyes twinkling. \"Wayne was right, you know:  others will come after me. You were the next in line.\"\n\n\"To try and bring you back?\"\n\n\"To have a Name. Even if you stole it, it's still a good one.\"  Grunting, he stood, taking his ax in one hand and leading the steer with the other. Rhonda called out to him.\n\n\"You're still giving up a lot, you know. The great lord of the forest, the arbiter of nature's justice, the embodiment of the pioneer wilderness... And now you're just a regular lumberjack?\"\n\nThe fairy who had left his home to find peace looked back at Rhonda Smith and smiled.\n\n\"Yeah. I'm a lumberjack. I'm okay with that.\"\n\nAnd then the fairy walked back into the forest, and some say he lives there still.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8514/Paul_Bunyan_statue_in_Bangor%2C_Maine.JPG\n|caption=A statue depicting SCP-8514, Variant-1\n|width=350px\n|align=center]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\nRaven Wesson left the office, shifted his coat, and walked down the hallway to the elevator, softly whistling //Ode to Joy//.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 11884158495_6136a39fba_c\n> **Name**: Bearded Lumberjack Look\n> **Author:**    Mike Mozart\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/jeepersmedia/11884158495\n=====\n> **Filename:** 16199348839_370c28415f_z\n> **Name**: This is the tired and somewhat disheveled look.
