All personnel were recovered without incident or recollection of the event.|width=240px]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-ES-115\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The Zaragoza Metro, its facilities, and the public company that managed it (Zaragoza Metropolitan, L.L.C) have been acquired by the Foundation. All related documents have been confiscated or edited to hide their existence, which is also being eliminated from living memory by means of an advanced information control program as part of //Operation Spirits of the Transition//.\n\nAll Zaragoza Metro stations have been closed to the public. These stations and the tunnels that connect them will be incorporated into the Foundation's facilities in Zaragoza, receiving the joint designation of Containment and Reliquary Site-181. This includes the former Aragonese headquarters of the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/hub-comisaria Special Security Commission] (formally, the Reliquary Sector of Site-181).\n\nSince all areas of Site-181 including the Metro tunnels require active personnel, Metro stations will be monitored by video surveillance. At least one Class C Agent with Cognitive Resistance scores above the 95th percentile (TPNL Measurement) should be stationed at each station; the Agent will be equipped with SCP-ES-115 calibrated hearing sensors. This Agent shall act and dress as a Station Manager employed by the Metropolitan of Zaragoza, L.L.C.\n\nIf any individual present in the dock where SCP-ES-115 appears is affected, the Agent will blow his whistle twice and gesture in the direction of SCP-ES-115 to leave the station immediately. If this attempt fails, the Agent shall not attempt to rescue the victim.\n\nAny subject released from SCP-ES-115 is to undergo debriefing and psychological assessment to assess their reintegration into mainstream society. If possible, they will be administered Class K amnestics and released, supervised, or tutored by social services staff; if not, the Analysis Team will decide how to handle them.\n\nSCP-ES-115-1, a humanoid entity dressed in uniform, has been observed exiting SCP-ES-115 instances. The stationed Class C Agent shall raise the alarm and make every effort to apprehend SCP-ES-115-1 for containment and interrogation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-115 is an anomaly that acts as a means of urban subway transportation in the capital of Aragon, Zaragoza (Spain). It is suspected from unclear reports that its presence was detected during the months following the end of the Spanish Civil War,[[footnote]] The armed conflict was triggered by the uprising of the majority of the regular army of Spain against the prevailing policies of the government of the Second Republic, installed years earlier in place of the monarchy ruled by Alfonso XIII.[[/footnote]] running through the tunnels under construction of the Zaragoza Subway. This project was initiated in the years of the Republic,[[footnote]] The government prior to the Civil War, which was replaced by a military dictatorship known as the Francoist \"Regime\", built around the fascist ideology of the Falangism, conservative Catholic morality and the figure of the leader of the uprising General Francisco Franco. [[/footnote]] abandoned during the war and retaken by the Franco regime afterward; it was completed by an independent public corporation managed by the Zaragoza City Council in 19██ (█), and is a typical example of post-war architecture, functional and vaguely brutalist in style[[footnote]] Repetitive angular geometries, rough appearance of the finish, abundant use of unfinished construction materials or simplified symbolic decorations. [[/footnote]] with austere decorative motifs and symbology related to the Franco regime. The Metro itself is not anomalous.\n\nSCP-ES-115 manifests itself as one or more objects running similarly and resembling a metropolitan commuter train in terms of the number of doors and windows, acceleration, maximum speed, braking, and arrival times[[footnote]]SCP-ES-115 never stops outside of arrival times, although it does run non-stop and along unpredictable routes at many stations, it passes through off-schedule. It is not known if it is aware of these schedules or if an external force forces it to stop when arrival and presence times coincide at the station. [[/footnote]] to the stations through which trains were planned to pass on Line C (which never had any trains on its planned route). However, SCP-ES-115 is composed entirely of living human bodies.\n\nEach of the carriages of each SCP-ES-115 object comprises between ███ and ███ bodies of different anatomy, ethnicity, age and physical conditions, intertwined or clinging to each other. These bodies may be wounded, bleed and emit residual heat. Generally, only their limbs and torsos are visible; some necks may be seen on rare occasions. The vehicle is supported and propelled by hundreds of human arms and legs emerging from the assembly.\n\nThe bodies are contorted in such a way that it is not possible to fully see the anatomy to which they belong or the way in which they \"fit together\". Between 13 and 78 faces with open eyes always appear at the front of the vehicle. It is common for the vehicle to emit vocalizations that resemble those of a moving diesel-powered subway train, although it has no wheels, engine, mechanical parts, or contact with the tracks.\n\nWhen initiating its movement and closing the doors (generally formed by the torsos and legs of six human bodies), SCP-ES-115 will emit vocalizations that resemble the sound of bells, horns, and/or chimes. It presumably employs all of its mouths to emit them, with the sound of each mouth being different and uncoordinated from the rest; only the vocalization itself of the faces at the front of each wagon has been visually confirmed. The resulting cacophony appears to serve SCP-ES-115 as a station arrival and departure warning, but it is also a cognitohazard that precludes detection of its atypical character by non-anomalous humans. Upon boarding the vehicle, the subjects join the vehicle like the bodies already present.\n\nThe bodies included in the vehicle are not aware of their surroundings. An anatomical study of their components while integrated in SCP-ES-115 confirms that they are non-anomalous human beings, but lack independent sentience or mobility. They do not produce biological waste or breathe, do not require food or fuel, and have never been observed in a situation of muscular or neurological rest.\n\nWhen a body of SCP-ES-115 is forcibly removed, it will die immediately. This process usually requires mutilation of the body and several others, given the enormous passive resistance of its limbs to removal.\n\nHowever, each time SCP-ES-115 stops at a station, most subjects who recently boarded disembark without sequelae and with total amnesia of the event. When questioned, they report having been \"distracted,\" but vaguely recall a trip on a normal subway train. A variable portion of those involved do not disembark but remain embedded in perpetuity.\n\nAll attempts to trace SCP-ES-115 have ended in failure. Several of the routes marked as dead-ends on the maps of the facilities that were preserved after their closure opens into natural cavities that make reliable tracking impossible due to their irregular layout. The larger ones also open onto the depots of the Zaragoza metropolitan railway, annexed to the former headquarters of the Special Security Commission. SCP-ES-115 seems to be able to navigate them without difficulty, although they constitute a considerable danger for the Foundation's trained speleologists.\n\nTracking alternatives are being researched.\n\n**Addendum SCP-ES-115-A: Pre-Foundation Management.**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"++ Open Log.\" hide=\"-- Access registered and authorized.\"]]\n\nSCP-ES-115 was identified by agents of the Spanish Special Security Commission in 19██ (█) while searching the subway works of the Zaragoza Metro, suspecting that it housed Republican agents and/or caches of weapons and material resources.

Those orders consisted of preparing a large puddle of kerosene more than eighty meters long, which we lit at the signal of my second at the moment he suspected of his arrival.

But they burned without a complaint and were therefore inhuman.** }}\n \n{{ **Many of the wounds gushed rather than bled, and some of the bodies fell off as olive leaves fall off when they are plucked, but the beast itself kicked the ground. It was not advancing, but extinguishing the flames. I swear I saw it lose charred limbs, made charcoal and dust on the ground, but all it had to do was lean on new ones. I also swear that we did not hear a single wail, even though we killed as many as we could. One boy of a few years took two bullets in the face, but he did not let go until a peon sank his jaw with a buckshot.** }}\n \n{{ **There came a moment when the being became agitated. I guess it was running out of legs and had to move towards the barricade we had prepared to escape. It charged at it like a fighting bull charges, with as much run as he could muster, putting all the weight it had into his run to carry it off... but the barricade didn't stop it. What's more, it didn't even seem to hit it.** }}\n \n{{ **We could not count how many arms were raised at one to dismantle the wooden panels, but the men behind the parapet, veterans of the Crusade,[[footnote]] Reference to the Civil War. Meme almost exclusive to pro-Franco supporters. [[/footnote]] were run over unceremoniously. Two of them jumped in time and they say they thought they saw the arms of the beast tearing the other unfortunates to pieces as if they were part of the wood. Perhaps they saw no difference between the two. We did hear them scream.** }}\n \n{{ **But the beast kept taking fire from those of us who remained, and at the end, it screamed for the last time; it was a fierce scream, a challenge. Many arms reached for our flesh; I think what they wanted was more pieces for their body, or for their herd of bodies, or for themselves if they were some kind of thief... God help me, one of the Civil Guards had an arm ripped off trying to keep them from taking it. But they took it away; what can a man do against something like that? What can a man do, whether his arms are strong or not?** }}\n\n{{ **But in the end, all the bodies were dead. The few that remained alive fell as if they were, but we made sure to give them the last shot in the back of the head. They all wore uniforms, although it took me a while to realize that they were the tattered uniforms of the Reds: CNT and POUM armbands, Soviet insignia, badly kept beards, and the occasional medal of the Virgin. There were uniformed women, nurses, some deviants dressed as men, and some poor children. Few, but I can attest: there they were.** }}\n \n{{ **Although spirits were flagging, I encouraged those of us who remained to burn the bodies, as is the custom of the House. The Chaplain anointed the fallen and blessed the fire. It was more for the men than anything concrete, but they were grateful. Afterward, I gathered them together and we went through what was left of the tunnel.** }}\n \n{{ **I don't know where it nested or where it ate. I don't know what it wanted. I don't know where it came from unless someone dug it up by digging tunnels or reanimated it with the black arts I'm getting used to. Oh, Lord, how can anyone get used to it? But nothing we found of him or that told us of him, and I think it is for the best. As far as I am concerned, no sacrifice is too great to ensure the end of such dark spawn. I hope not to find any more.** }}\n \n{{ **I also enclose the testimonies of my men, including the wounded (among whom I count myself), and those of the cowards who did not even dare to fight the monstrosity.

By that time (the 1970s), the Commission had already lost its influence and many internal elements, such as [REDACTED], the HIDALGO in command of Zaragoza Metro operations, were dissatisfied with the central management of the organization.

Similarly, Foundation agents removed much of the public bibliographic holdings during the years following the takeover. The information purge carried out was extensive and reliable with respect to this and other anomalies, framed in the so-called //Operation Spirits of the Transition.//\n\nThere are records, for example, of the departure of at least eight humanoid subjects (naked but in good shape) from several SCP-ES-115 instances during the last few years of the Commission, but no written reports remain.\n\nThe first three were summarily executed; the next four were identified as missing subway users but declared \"deviants\" (possibly suffering from serious cognitohazards or psychiatric problems) and imprisoned until they committed suicide or died in captivity.\n\nThe last subject was released from his SCP-ES-115 instance in 1972 and, after being briefly interviewed, re-entered SCP-ES-115 on his own feet.\n\nNo records of this interview are preserved.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum SCP-ES-115-B: anomalous behavior of SCP-ES-115.**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"++ Open Log\" hide=\"-- Access registered and authorized\"]]\n\nOn three separate occasions since his containment by the Foundation, the same subject dressed in a uniform similar to that of a Republic-era streetcar conductor has descended from the \"wagons\" of SCP-ES-115.
