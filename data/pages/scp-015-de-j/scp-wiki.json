We laughed so much.[[/footnote]] by MTF 180-Donald \"Don't Duck With the Police!\".\n\nAny personnel on contact with SCP-015-DE-J are permitted to shoot and otherwise use violence on --that Son of a Bitch-- SCP-015-DE-J in an attempt to decommission the anomaly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-015-EN-J is a male mallard (//--**ANUS**-- Anas platyrhynchos//) that can reach speeds of over 180 kilometres per hour when --he-- it runs in a straight line on foot. In doing so, this causes wind gusts and whirlwinds, which leads to damage to street infrastructure.\n\nOnce SCP-015-DE-J is crossed by a vehicle, a second anomalous property manifests itself in the form of the rendition of the song //Deja Vu// by Dave Rodgers. This appears to come from SCP-015-DE-J's beak and the lyrics are sung in a high-pitched, quacking voice. As soon as this would theoretically normally end, SCP-015-DE-J opens its wings, takes off and does not land again until it encounters a new vehicle, where it starts playing the song again. The vehicle that is the trigger is caught by SCP-015-DE-J's gust of wind in the process and is thus swept along.\n\n--For reasons that are not clear, vehicles are immune to the effect when they play the song //Gas Gas Gas// by Manuel Caramori through their speakers.--\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki-de.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-015-de-j/Agent%2BHund.jpg|caption=Agent Erwin Jaeger (Left) and Tetiana (Centre), lying in wait to finally put a stop to this speedster!|width=250px]]\n\n**Addendum:** Since 2016 vehicles playing //Gas Gas Gas// have been subjected to a new effect in which SCP-015-DE-J lands on the roof and thus \"surfs\" through traffic. After the end of the song, SCP-015-DE-J takes off together with the vehicle and only lands again when a corresponding track (for cars this would be roads, for trains and trams tracks) reappears. From then on, SCP-015-DE-J removes itself from the vehicle.\n\n**Discovery:** The SCP Foundation first became aware of SCP-015-DE-J when [[span style=\"color:black; background-color: black\"]]Jeffrey Jack Johnson Jr, the Cowboy, Adventurer, Tamer of the Stupid Reptile, etc. etc.[[/span]][[footnote]]//Redacted at the request of O5-7. – O4-1// [[/footnote]] O5-6's company car, a Hummer HX to note,[[footnote]] //Someone must be compensating for something. – O4-8// [[/footnote]] was severely damaged in a confrontation with the Entity and had to be scrapped at an early stage because of it.\n\nFrom then on, MTF 180-Donald \"Don't Duck With the Police!\" was formed to neutralise SCP-015-DE-J.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"> Update\" hide=\"…\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki-de.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-015-de-j/GOI-015-DE-j.jpg|caption=We think that this stupid Goose is waiting for the right moment for a counter-attack.

This goose appears to be capable of honking at 140 dB.[[footnote]] //For all those who have no idea about sound and how the Eggheads measure it: It is VERY loud. So loud that it hurts. - D-2510//\n//P. S. How do I know? I've had my eardrums damaged. Twice. - D-2510//[[/footnote]] This --Superpower-- ability can create cracks in various structures when focused on a target. It uses this to destroy roads and other facilities, such as car parks, used by vehicles.\n\nIt also appears to have the ability to --magically-- --magnetically-- magic-netically attract any baked goods within a one kilometre[[footnote]] For our friends from the part of North America that is below Canada and above Mexico: That's a lot of Feet to walk. [[/footnote]] radius.\n\n~~~~\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO-RECORDING-015-DE-J**\n----\n**DATE:** Afternoon. Don't know when exactly it was.\n\n**NOTES:** This is the first encounter between SCP-015-DE-J and the new entity. How it came about that agents from the SCP Foundation could be on the scene to record the confrontation is not clear. The people from the 'Pataphysics Department mumbled something about \"fate\" before [[[SCP-044-DE-J|they got drunk]]], but who listens to them, am I right?\n\n//By the way: We translated the dialogue from Universal Bird, just so you know why you can read it.
