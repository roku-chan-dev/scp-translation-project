  "content": "**Item:** SCP-001-A\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-001-A is to be kept under constant surveillance at Warehouse 9 of the Large Anomaly Containment Wing at Site-59. Emergent instances of SCP-001-A-2 are to be subdued and placed in Site-59's Humanoid Containment Wing.\n\nA full exploration attempt of SCP-001-A-3 by Mobile Task Force Zeta-9 \"Mole Rats\" has been scheduled for 10/1/22.\n\n**Description:** SCP-001-A is a 13.59 m x 2.44 m x 2.9 m shipping container. Its exterior has been reinforced with an unknown substance that, to date, has completely withstood all attempts to cut through.\n\nSave for SCP-001-A-1, it is identical in appearance and, presumably, function to SCP-001. However, the presence of SCP-001-A-2 makes SCP-001-A too volatile to act as a replacement for SCP-001.\n\nSCP-001-A-1 is a flat metallic device, 2.1 m in height and 0.9 m in width. The text \"SCP-FNA\"[[footnote]] Does not reference any known SCP designation. [[/footnote]] has been painted on the surface. Through unknown means, it has been permanently affixed to the right wall of SCP-001-A's \"cockpit.\" Whether or not SCP-001-A-1 has \"phased into\" the wall is unknown.\n\nOn irregular intervals, instances of SCP-001-A-2 emerge from SCP-001-A-1.\n\nSCP-001-A-2 denotes 57 (so far) identical humanoid entities of indeterminate gender, intelligence, and identity. Though unarmed and lacking in capacity to do serious damage to armed personnel, subjects are extremely hostile and will assault anyone in range.\n\nInstances are dressed in blue jumpsuits emblazoned with the words \"PROJECT BELUGA.\" They are hairless, grayish-brown in skin tone, and hygiene-deficient. Tissue samples taken from SCP-001-A-2 display both human and bovine DNA. It is unknown if they are capable of speech.\n\nSCP-001-A-1 can be opened internally (usually by SCP-001-A-2) and through the use of a button on the exterior. The latter will cause two halves [[footnote]] With the exception of a 3 cm perimeter that serves as a door frame. [[/footnote]] of the device to fold inward, leading to SCP-001-A-3.\n\nSCP-001-A-3 is an extradimensional space consisting primarily of interior corridors for a fortified storage area.\n\n**Addendum - Incident-001-A-88198:** On 9/1/22 at 0100 GMT, the speaker system of SCP-001-A's internal console suddenly began making the following announcement at 120 dB:\n\n> {{EMERGENCY EMERGENCY EMERGENCY █████ ██ ██████ ████, ████, ██████ ██ ████ ██}}[[footnote]] A memetic passphrase that, when spoken by anyone other than a current or former O5-11, will result in the subject bursting into flames. Similarly, recordings of this phrase when spoken by another voice are destroyed upon playback. [[/footnote]] {{LIKELIHOOD OF GANYMEDE PROTOCOL ENACTMENT IF NON-ACTION IS TAKEN APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED PERCENT XK-SK-ZK-YK-CLASS SCENARIO ALL PENDING I AM STRANDED ON THE FIFTEENTH BASEMENT LEVEL OF SCP-001-A-3 THERE ARE POSSIBLY SEVERAL CHILDREN DOWN HERE WITH ME THIS MESSAGE WILL REPEAT UNTIL MY DEMANDS ARE MET HELP ME EMERGENCY EMERGENCY EMERGENCY}}\n\nAfter consulting both Site Director Naismith and the O5 Council, Researcher Aaron Gualtieri was chosen to meet the broadcaster. Gualtieri was already scheduled for termination due to exposure to a FAFNIR-class infohazard and had expressed a desire to \"go out doing something useful.\" He was given a hidden microphone to record all interactions with the broadcaster.\n\n> **Log of Incident-001-A-88198**\n> **9/1/22, 0618 GMT**\n> \n> <Begin Log>\n> \n> //(Sound of a blast door opening on level B15 of SCP-001-A-3.
