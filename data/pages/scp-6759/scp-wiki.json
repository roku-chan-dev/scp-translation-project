Only Foundation personnel are granted access to Site-89; any civilians within the perimeter are to be administered Class-A amnestics and escorted off the premises.\n\n\nSCP-6759-1 instances found within the perimeter of Site-89 are to be interviewed and escorted back to SCP-6759. Interviewers are encouraged to inquire about topics such as their experience within the city and the nature of \"The Crux\".\nExploration into SCP-6759 must be authorized by Director Fuschl. Personnel exiting SCP-6759 must undergo a 2-hour quarantine and a standard decontamination procedure. \n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6759 is an extradimensional, labyrinthine space composed of alleyways and buildings, it conforms to none of Euclid's 15 postulates. Layout, architectural style, and materials are inconsistent between buildings.\nRegardless of what side is viewed, observers will perceive the front of the building. The buildings' heights cannot be determined, as upon inspection they appear to extend indefinitely into the sky, only obscured from view by a thick fog. Testing has provided inconclusive results on the composition of the fog. Attempts to measure the height of buildings within SCP-6759 via drones have failed.\nVarious cognitive hazards are present within SCP-6759, at the time of writing none have proven lethal or significantly dangerous.\n\n\nThe entry to SCP-6759 is located between ██ and ██ street, New York City. It appears to be a standard alleyway but ends in a separate passageway with no visible light passing through.\n \n\nSCP-6759 does not adhere to any known laws of physics; gravity is inconsistent and matter can be created and destroyed, with temporal anomalies being common. Any effects inflicted on subjects disappear shortly after exiting SCP-6759. \n\n\nSCP-6759-1 instances are the inhabitants of SCP-6759 and vary wildly between appearance and properties, although are usually non-anomalous humans. SCP-6759-1 instances regard the city as their home and act like typical New York citizens, speaking the local dialect where of the area SCP-6759 is found in. Many instances incorporate the various anomalies of the city into their lifestyle; when questioned about their lifestyle within SCP-6759, they claim it is the way things normally are.\n\n\nSCP-6759-2 is the broad designation given to other anomalies found within SCP-6759. Such as anomalous entities or objects separate from buildings.\n\n**Addendum 6759.1:** Exploration log\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Initial Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n@@ @@\n**Date:** 12/08/2018\n\n**Exploration Team:** Special Agent Goodwell, Special Agent Jenkins.\n\n**Foreword:** Shortly after the discovery of SCP-6759, two agents were sent into the anomaly to gain intelligence about the interior.\nEach member was supplied with reality anchors, Kant counters, and cognitohazard-detectors, along with standard exploration gear to prepare for any hazards detected by Foundation drones before the mission. \n\n------\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Site Command:** Recording's starting.\n\n**Goodwell:** Ready?\n\n**Jenkins:** Ready.\n\n//Jenkins and Goodwell step through the threshold, and the camera feed cuts to static for two seconds before reconnecting//\n\n**Goodwell:** Holy shit.\n\n//Agents Goodwell and Jenkins appear to be in a wide alleyway. Buildings are standard as to what would be expected outside the anomaly, apart from the gaping mouth on the nearest left. Most other buildings seem to have some variations. There is a stegosaurus present, and a few abstract shapes,  There are also some standard civilians within the anomaly, apart from an instance who is wearing all of its clothes backward. The video quality has lowered significantly.//\n\n**Jenkins:** Jeez, you weren't kidding Shan, this place does look... bizarre, to say the least.\n\n**Goodwell:** I'm sure there's a pattern. I'm waiting for some wizards to come out and tell us this is just a weirder part of Three Portlands.\n\n**Jenkins:** Well, we'll see.\n\n//An SCP-6759-1 instance is seen approaching. It is wearing khaki shorts and a stained tank top.//\n\n**SCP-6759-1 Instance:** Yo, y'all the 'xterminators?\n\n**Jenkins:** No sir, we are conducting an investi'ation.\n\n**SCP-6759-1 Instance:** Woah, woah!

After snapping its fingers 7 times, the instance and the tricycle sink violently into the ground.//\n\n**Jenkins:** The 'ell?\n\n**Goodwell:** Wh- Huh?\n\n**Goodwell:** Focus, focus. That could be the building he meant, I'm assuming so, given the slot machines jutting out the side over there. Alright, Jenkins, ready the anchor.\n\n**Jenkins:** Shan, I think we've been through enough missions together to be on a first-name basis.\n\n//Agent Goodwell sighs.//\n\n**Goodwell:** Not now.\n\n**Jenkins:** Okay, okay.\n\n//Jenkins pulls out the reality anchor from his pack and readies the activation mechanism.//\n\n**Goodwell:** The entities here seem non-hostile, but keep range and keep your guard up.\n\n//Agent Goodwell and Jenkins approach the building, Jenkins turns on the reality anchor but on activation it melts into gummy worms.//\n\n**Jenkins:** Wha- I'm uhh... Guessin', we can't use those 'ere.\n\n**Goodwell:** Shit, that's a bad sign. But we just started the mission. It wouldn't be worth the funds to leave now.\n\n**Goodwell:** I'll run a perimeter check.\n\n//Agent Goodwell walks around the left side of the building, a wooden trapdoor manifests where she was previously standing, and she climbs out of it.//\n\n**Goodwell:** Nothing new. I'll enter the building, you stay out here to keep guard and make sure nothing happens.\n\n**Jenkins:** Great.\n\n//Agent Jenkins goes to stand outside the door.//\n\n**Jenkins:** Command you seein' this? There's some sort of mold out here, it's purrin' at me. Bit cute actually.\n\n//Jenkins bends down to touch the mold, and when he does, it becomes a matryoshka doll.//\n\n**Jenkins:** Huh?\n\n//Goodwell enters the building while Jenkins remains posted outside the door, as she enters the camera feed turns to static.//\n\n**Goodwell:** Bigger on the inside, I guess.\n\n**Site Command:** Video cut out, describe your surroundings.\n\n**Goodwell:** Interior appears to be larger than seen on the outside. Here's what I believe is the other side of the slot machines. They are rectangular and have scales, it looks like they're pulsating and twitching. I caught a glimpse of some sort of visual cognitohazard, not sure what it was, but now my left arm is green, and it tingles a bit.\nThe layout seems like a regular casino, but some of the gambling machines are dispensing candy corn, and further into the room the floor is flooded. The inhabitants look like regular civilians. There are also these butterflies with more wings on their wings.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Casino-capture\n| caption=Recovered from Agent Goodwell's camera[[footnote]]Agent Goodwell's camera was reclaimed in another exploration[[/footnote]].\n]]\n\n//Splashes are heard, presumably, Goodwell is stepping into the water.//\n\n**Goodwell:** There is a slug with the head of Abraham Lincoln.

A faint rhythmic beating is heard.//\n\n**Goodwell:** I'm further into the building now. There are more of the slug things from earlier, but different presidents, there's Ilham  Aliyev[[footnote]]President of Azerbaijan[[/footnote]], Jack Pithey[[footnote]]Former president of Rhodesia[[/footnote]], and Stephanus Schoeman[[footnote]]Former president of South Africa[[/footnote]]. \n\n//Note: Prior to this mission, Agent Goodwell had no experience regarding the political history of Rhodesia, Azerbaijan, or South Africa.//\n\n**Goodwell:** More slot machines, but I won't pull any more levers. The room here is becoming more cavernous as I venture further in, it doesn't seem like there's anything worth finding in here. I'll get ba- HEY, YOU! STOP RIGHT THERE!\n\n//Agent Goodwell begins running, presumably away from the entrance since the audio feed begins cutting out.//\n\n**Goodwell:** Command come in! There's an ag-\n\n//All connection from Agent Goodwell is lost.//\n\n**Site Command:** Agent Goodwell? Come in Agent Goodwell! Jenkins, are you still there?\n\n**Jenkins:** Yeah, I'm just sittin' 'ere. Stoppin' and bein' smelled by the flowers. How much longer do I 'ave to stay here?\n\n**Site Command:** Are you able to get out?\n\n**Jenkins:** Yes, the entrance is still 'ere, there was a little blue fellow earlier who tried to take it away but I shooed 'im off.\n\n**Site Command:** We lost Agent Goodwell. Get back, we don't want you lost either.\n\n**Jenkins:** What? Shouldn't I go in there and look for 'er?\n\n**Site Command:** Too risky.\n\n**Jenkins:** So I just leave? No!\n\n**Site Command:** Jenkins, push your personal feelings aside, and get out.\n\n**Jenkins:** Fuck you, I'm gonna find 'er.\n\n**Site Command:** We're afraid that if you do that, you'll be classified as lost as well.\n\n//Agent Jenkins kicks at the ground, a section of which grunts and shouts profanity.//\n\n**Jenkins:** ...\n\n//After 30 seconds, Agent Jenkins exits SCP-6759.//\n\n**Closing statement:** Little information was gathered on the nature of SCP-6759 and the mission was deemed a failure. Agent Goodwell is classified as missing. Agent Jenkins' request for another mission into SCP-6759 has been denied.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@ \n**Addendum 6759.2:**\nOn 17/09/2018, a stack of handwritten documents formatted as standard SCP personal exploration logs on A4 paper was found outside the entrance to SCP-6759.

These logs are to act as an account of my experience here for research purposes. Or as a black box, although hopefully, it won't come to that.\n\n\nI'm writing these entries on paper I found growing on the bark of a tree. The pencil was gifted to me by someone who asked me to reattach their arm. She didn't seem distressed, and I did a first aid course back at the academy. Turns out I just had to push it into the stump and all the muscles, and veins fused back together. The pencil is alright, just standard graphite with a button on the end that makes my next word glitter. I'll do my best to refrain from pushing it.\n\n\nIf you're reading this, Jenkins, I suppose I should provide context to my disappearance; I was exploring deeper in the casino, when I saw an inhabitant wearing a UIU badge, at the time I was acting rashly and shouldn't have gone after him, but I thought this place was a part of Three Portlands or some weirder Nexus. I apologize for my actions, it was negligent of me to leave. At the time I wanted answers and wasn't thinking clearly.\nWhen I shouted to him he attempted to flee, and I pursued him. When he was apprehended, his UIU badge turned into a GOC emblem, then into an SCP logo. When I tried to exit the building, I found myself in an entirely different place. \nI concluded at that point I was lost. Given how //violently// non-euclidean this place is, I figured there's no way of reliably finding anything here, I hope you didn't follow me. It would have proven futile, and you most likely would have ended up in the same situation as me.\n\n\nOnce apprehended, I took the inhabitant into an empty building. The interior was a single office block but all the stationary seemed to be made of felt or knitted together in some way. I assumed the wool would soundproof the area but everything echoed. It seemed adequate to hold an impromptu interview, and I'm not sure where I might have found better options. I held a rudimentary interview using my supplies on hand. I've attached a transcript of the interview below. Please excuse the rushed handwriting.
