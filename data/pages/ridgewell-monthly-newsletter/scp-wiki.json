The sky is so bright, and the outside room hurts my skin more than ever. When the school year starts, I'm tasking my students with finding out why that's happening and if we can stop it!\nEven if we can't, whenever I come back to our great campus to start another semester, I see the [[span class=\"eo\"]]EDUTAINMENT OBELISK[[/span]] still standing strong, and I'm reminded how everything's going to be okay. It doesn't matter what the world looks like outside, because in here, we're deciding the future, shaping the minds of tomorrow, and giving praise to the [[span class=\"eo\"]]EDUTAINMENT OBELISK[[/span]]. And we're having fun doing it!\nLet's see what the 24/25 school year brings to Ridgewell Edutainment Center!\n----\n[[div style=\"background: #d82c2cff; padding: 6px 6px; border: solid 3px #7f1919ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 6px 6px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: #fcf7f6ff; padding: 5px 5px; border: solid 1px #000000ff; margin: 1px; border-radius: 4px 4px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ AUGUST 2024 STUDENT OF THE MONTH:\n++ **EDDIE CARMICHAEL!**\n[[/=]]\n//Our school year hasn't even begun, but 12-year-old Eddie Carmichael is already in the building! In fact, it looks like he didn't leave for Summer Break in the first place! He's been sitting in one spot in the assembly hall for three months now, studying a potted fern. Somehow, the fern has been studying him, too. Now, spiderwebs are at his knees. The branches of the fern are growing towards him, stretching closer with each passing day, while he sits still. So, **so** perfectly still.//\n\n//When we asked Eddie what advice he has for his fellow students who also want to get ahead, he told us:  \"Stop interrupting me. I'm so close to perfection. I'm so close to planthood.\" Way to go, Eddie!//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n++ BACK-TO-SCHOOL SHOPPING! [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/ridgewell-monthly-newsletter/clip2.png width=\"10%\"]]\n[[/=]]\nKnowing what school supplies to shop for can be such a gosh-damn hassle for both students //and// parents - which is why, at Ridgewell Edutainment Center, we use the helpful acronym **PPPMCN2PTPEMDAS**! That's **P**encils, **P**ens, **P**aper, **M**echanical **P**encils, **N**o. **2**. **P**encils, **T**iconderoga **P**encils, **E**rasers, **M**aybe **D**esks, **a**nd **S**taplers! Don't worry, staples will be provided.\n\nSome of our lesser teachers may have their own list of whatsits your child will need, just for their class! How greedy of them. Make sure you grab these gobstoppers if your child has one of the following classes:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n//**Intro to Complex Emotions**//\n**with Ms. Udailey, 4th Grade:**\n* One (1) sick or dying pet, preferably mammalian.
