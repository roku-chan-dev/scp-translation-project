Who was she?\nA girl unsure of who she'd be.\nJust desiring to be free.\nA lass unhappy of where she'd been.\n\nSought a home, where to belong.\nFound a place of stories told.\nStarted anew from down below.\nAn agent, yes, but could be more.\n\nIdeas galore, backed up by pride.\nShe thus began, this was her stride.\nSo on and on she would just write.\nShe did believe this was her life.\n\nOn her home, ignored she thought.\nAnd a name, for that she fought.\nAspirations loudly spoke.\nYet sorely found she was alone.\n\nFor in the chase of others' praise.\nShe poured her heart.\nShe gave her mind.\nBut the turn of tides left her behind.\n\nLaughter reigned without a doubt.\nNo more sense of what was taught.\nOf mischief they were devout.\nCouldn't help but feel distraught.\n\nActions changed, conducts too.\nIt wasn't \"what\" but rather \"whom\".\nAnd as fate its grace withdrew.\nLeft her stranded without a clue.\n\nShe has vanished.\nNothing lost.\nA soul tarnished?\nNothing more.\nFlame extinguished?\nHardly so.\nShe is long gone.\nShe's home now.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/o3K6MlC.png width=\"160px\"]]",
