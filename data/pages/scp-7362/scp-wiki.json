A contingency budget has been established at each Site and the central Foundation administration. This reserve fund will be used exclusively to maintain basic operational capabilities, cover essential personnel costs, and address emergency situations, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7084 |including containment breaches]]].\n\nCurrently, collaboration with multiple governments, private organizations, and philanthropic entities has been necessary to maintain financial stability and adaptability in the event of another SCP-7362 manifestation. Site Directors and administrative personnel are required to assess and prioritize resources based on criticality to containment efforts. Non-essential projects and research may be temporarily suspended or put on hold to direct resources to the most urgent containment needs.\n\nWith the death of personnel involved in resource management due to SCP-7362, their duties will be assumed by personnel from other Sites or departments, ensuring continuity of essential functions. A centralized database of qualified personnel and their skill sets has been established to facilitate rapid deployment during crises.\n\nAll physical calculators within Foundation sites have since been destroyed.[[footnote]] SCPs such as [[[SCP-6199]]] and [[[SCP-168]]] have been placed within top-priority containment. [[/footnote]]\n----\n**Description:** SCP-7362 designates a poorly understood and presumably anomalous incident that occurred at Site-841, the facility which is responsible for a large majority of calculations related to containment procedures, construction projects, and budget management across the Foundation.\n\nListed below is camera footage recorded from the Site-841 security cameras, following Site Director Indus Stanner.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n@@ @@\n//Site Director Indus Stanner walks into the building, yawning to himself.//\n@@ @@\n**Stanner:** Sorry for being so late!
