This movement has been continuous, rapid, and consistently northward.\n\nDue to the difference between this event and SCP-6247's established anomalous properties, it has been assigned an SCP designation until more information is acquired.\n\nRelevant information on SCP-6247 prior to this phenomena follows:\n[[div class=\"blockquote solid\"]]\n++++++ [[[SCP-6247]]] -- Summarized Description:\n-----\n\nSCP-6247 designates a structure typically residing on the Atlantic seafloor, stationed near the Eastern coast of Canada.

As the drone descended, its searchlights revealed a damaged structure that appeared to have been sheered from a larger facility. Access to the interior was provided via an aperture resembling an airlock. The structure itself was flooded, but displayed minimal internal water damage. The architectural style featured large metallic elements and non-functioning digital displays were integrated into many of the walls.\n\nThe area explored contained a series of exoskeletal dive suits and an assortment of conventional and esoteric weaponry, that were retrieved by the submersible for further study. These suits were specialized for deep-sea combat: resistant to atmospheric pressures up to -6,000 m and featuring integrated, omnidirectional, water-jet-propulsion, aquatic movement suites. The recovered weaponry universally enhanced the capabilities of human hand-to-hand combat and included an assortment of piston-powered pneumatic devices worn on the user's forearm, capable of generating and displacing electrostatic charges, and mundane implements including brass knuckles and boxing gloves. No bladed weapons, firearms, or elastic-projectile armaments were recovered.\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n++++* Communications Transcript\n= //06/05/2022//\n----\n**Foreword:** The following transcript recounts a conversation between Cpt. Pollman, //SCPS Jeannette's// and Dr. Lawrence, //Site-184, Foundation Naval Command, Office of Naval Intelligence.// The conversation was recorded following the recovery and analysis of previously mentioned SCP-6247-affiliate materials.\n-----\n**Dr. Lawrence:** We've had people scrubbing through everything we have on SCP-6247. The information you've sent back has helped fill in the picture, but so far we don't have any definite leads. We got in touch with Site-120, and they've confirmed what we expected: the shifting in-and-out of our reality previously displayed by SCP-6247 wasn't thaumaturgic or ontokinetic in nature.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Meaning we aren't likely to be dealing with any magic bullshit. That's good right, all things considered?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Maybe. We do have a tentative theory. You're not going to like it though.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Nothing new there. Hit me with it.\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** We think the anomaly may be narrative in nature: SCP-6247 isn't shifting through physical dimensions, but rapidly oscillating through different stories.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** This some phata stuff? 'I never meta-narrative I didn't like, and all that?'\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Not exactly, we don't have reason to think it's playing with meta-narrative layers, at least not at the moment. Our best comparison is that it's behaving analogous to a setting, under some specific parameters.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Meaning?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Well, look at the suits you've recovered. Those are some high-tech pieces of hardware, designed for a very particular and inflexible purpose. Despite this, every single one seems unworn and unused: no wear and tear, no battle damage, no sign that anyone has ever been in them. SCP-6247's setting itself up for potential narrative action: the implication of some impending, heroic fight, but nothing that's been resolved. The stage is set, inviting something to happen -- so to speak.\n\nWe think SCP-6247's been bouncing between realities with narrative //potential.// Ones that can or will make use of it. Its ambiguous shape and form are representative of its attempts to suit various stories, or maybe reflective of their influence on it.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** So let's say I buy into this, how's it relate to what's going on now? Why's SCP-6247 moving north?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Well, in this framework SCP-6247's been shifting between narratives, inviting them to act upon it. We think that is what's going on with it now. We don't know what purpose it was meant to serve //here.// But our hypothesis is that something, some existing narrative actor -- either from our reality or one it brought along with it -- affected it. It's been swept up into some unfolding narrative.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** So the Office of Naval //Intelligence// is sending us after it?\n-----\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n**Update: 14/05/2022**\n[[div class=\"blockquote simple\"]]\n{{__AUTOMATED EXPEDITION REPORT:__}}\n{{POSITION: 80°44'07.7\"N 67°09'54.9\"W}}\n{{WEATHER: Fog Warning -- Windspeed: 4.6 kts}}\n{{SAILING CONDITIONS: Limited Visibility, Severe Cold}}\n[[/div]]\n-----\nAs SCP-6247 continued moving northward, the //SCPS Jeannette// persued.

Each docking space hosted an individual vehicle, all of which appear capable of self-propulsion via a series of propellers, but require individual tethers to the structure for power and oxygen. Notably, these vehicles and the shuttle bay itself display artistic forms consistent with the \"Art Deco\" artistic and architectural movement of the 1930s: featuring layered and symmetrical repetitions of geometric shapes, streamlined forms, and heavy usage of gold and brass ornamentation.

Various types of plant matter ranging from tubers to leafy greens were recovered, although much of the vegetation had been consumed by local sea life. The architectural stylings of this segment differ from those hitherto encountered: the physical layout adheres to the design philosophy and architectural stylings of modern, purpose-built Foundation laboratories.

The following is a select transcript of their conversation:\n-----\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Two distinct architectural styles and technological apperati -- three actually, If you include the advanced technology you recovered at the last spot. Suppose that lends some credence to our theory.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Or it means they couldn't decide on a contractor.\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** What, not a fan of the hypothesis?\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Frankly, I don't care either way -- as long as we know it's not going to pose a risk to the crew. I just don't want us to lose sight of what's going on here. If you're right about this, what does that change on our end?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Not much, at least for your expeditionary parameters. We still need to find the main structure of SCP-6247 and try to determine the cause of its behavioural change. If it's responding to some narrative influence or actor, it's important we establish its relation to the Foundation. We're worried it could be antagonistic, given the state of SCP-6247; but due to the nature of the anomaly what we're seeing might just as easily be the result of something beneficial.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Fail to see how that's the case.\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Well -- sticking with the narrative framework -- we've been dealing with the setting: where stories, varied ones at that it seems, would have taken place. But we haven't encountered any people, or actors I should say. No one with the agency to //affect// that story.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** So, are you hoping to find people alive down there?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Not likely, given the circumstances around it. Between the pressure, depth, and structural damage we've noticed, it's more likely you'll find some account of what happened: a note or a message, something cliched.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** I can work with that; we've got some sharp eyes here.\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** And uh, this may seem like an odd request, but...\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** I'm listening.\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Well, we're wondering if you can try to track any unusual occurrences: mechanical problems, odd crew members' dreams, phantasmal apparitions. We're just trying to determine what sort of narrative may be at work here.\n\n**Cpt. Pollman:** Phantasm-- You're asking me to be on the lookout for ghosts?\n\n**Dr. Lawrence:** Just, well anything that might fit certain tropes; things you may associate with doo-- Uh, arctic expeditions.\n\n**Cpt.
