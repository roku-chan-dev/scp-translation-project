I'm contacting you about Case 102-9381-23, the breaking and entering at Stephen Crane's Pub and Brewery. During a standard review of all closed cases, we noticed that this case was shelved despite having no clear conclusion or arrest. I'm sure this is likely a clerical error, but I'd like to ask you about it, given the fact you were the one directly involved in the incident. It would be highly appreciated if you could reply to me with an email with your recollection of the case. Thank you.\n \n[[<image https://i.imgur.com/swu5LLh.png width=\"140px\"]]\nRegards,\nAlejandro Marquez\nNew Jersey State Police, Internal Affairs[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#ffffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nMathias Dean\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nAlejandro Marquez\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRE: Case 102-9381-23\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n07-05-2010\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]] \n-----\nHello Mr. Marquez,\n \nTo be honest, I don't remember a ton from the case. It was a while ago, and I've always had a poor memory. But I'll try to put down what I can grasp.\n\nMe and my partner, Officer Jameson, were about a block or two away from the place when we received the report. Standard public disturbance, some loud noises. Call was put in from the little coffee shop across the street. I was sure it was just some kids boozed out of their minds and making fools out of themselves.\n\nWe booked it to the pub. I've been there a couple times, nice place. Had my retirement party there, actually. But yes, we raced to the scene of the crime. Springfield is a small town and we don't get much action, which makes it all the more exciting when we finally //do// get something interesting. We parked across the street, and moved in. I vaguely recall seeing some weird lights in the place.\n\nWhen we went in, we found the perps already down. Two men and a woman, all adults, all dressed in suits. Some lady was there, cuffing them. No clue who that was. We ordered her to throw her hands up and we cuffed her. I ordered Jameson to call another squad car to get the three goons to the hospital. They must've had a bit too much to drink, could smell the booze on him from a couple feet away. \n\nMy memory just sort of fades out there. I vaguely remember handing over the perps and woman to the drunk tank at the station, but not much past that.\n\nHope this helps. \n[[<image https://i.imgur.com/swu5LLh.png width=\"140px\"]]\nRegards,\nMathias Dean\nSpringfield NJ Police Department[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#ffffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nAlejandro Marquez\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nJeremiah Thompson\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nCase 102-9381-23\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n07-06-2010\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]] \n-----\nHello Sgt. Thompson,\n \nI'm with Internal Affairs, and we're contacting you about an old shelved case, Case 102-9381-23, a public disturbance at Stephen Crane's Pub and Brewery. I've been informed that the arresting officer, one Mathias Dean, handed over the suspects to you in Precinct 15 for processing. However, the records lose track of them after that. Could you perhaps give me some insight onto what happened that night so we can tie up this case for good?\n\n[[<image https://i.imgur.com/swu5LLh.png width=\"140px\"]]\nRegards,\nAlejandro Marquez\nNew Jersey State Police Internal Affairs[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#ffffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nJeremiah Thompson\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nAlejandro Marquez\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRE: Case 102-9381-23\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n07-07-2010\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]] \n-----\nHowdy Mr. Marquez,\n\nI do believe I remember what you are referring to. I had booked them into the drunk tank and was waiting for them to sober up. One of the women kept insisting she wasn't drunk, but then, that's exactly what most drunk people say. Not a ton happened, to be honest. But, I went ahead and checked the system to confirm, and it said they were all bailed out by one Samuel Chris Parker at about 2:00 AM, which is weird because I was on shift until 5:00 AM and don't remember that //at all//. I'd appreciate it if you could search through the state records for this (since our local records are rather limited) and get back to me soon. I'd hate to find out a clerical error lead to that much inconvenience for us.\n\n\n[[<image https://i.imgur.com/swu5LLh.png width=\"140px\"]]\nRegards,\nJeremiah Thompson\nSpringfield NJ Police Department[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; background:#ffffff; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 4% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nJeremiah Thompson\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nAlejandro Marquez\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRE: Case 102-9381-23\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:** \n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n07-14-2010\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]] \n-----\nHowdy Mr. Marquez,\n\nDid you ever get the opportunity to search up those records?
