Patrols are to routinely monitor this perimeter and perform any maintenance that is required for continued function. Any unauthorized individuals attempting to gain access to SCP-6066 are to be detained by on-site security, interrogated, and administered amnestics or further detained as appropriate.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6066 is a small cottage located on the outskirts of the village of Lerry, located in Merseyside, England. Local records contain no accounts of SCP-6066's original construction or history, but exterior inspection of the building displays definite signs of Victorian-era windows and brickwork.\n\nSCP-6066's anomalous properties have made conducting a full investigation of the property extremely difficult. However, visual inspection through outside windows and doors have shown that a massive population of domestic felines of various breeds is constantly present within the property. Despite the lack of any known source of consistent food and water, these cats have never been seen in anything but good health, and have never been observed attempting to leave SCP-6066.\n\nThe only functional entrance to SCP-6066 is the backdoor leading into the kitchen -- attempts to break in via other means have proven unsuccessful[[footnote]] Often resulting in loss of personnel in a similar manner to a failed expedition. [[/footnote]]. When an individual enters SCP-6066 through the backdoor, they must proceed through the house in an exceedingly exact manner, performing a number of specific actions at specific times in order to prevent a failed expedition. \n\nIn the event that an individual inside SCP-6066 behaves in a manner inconsistent with the required actions, no matter how slightly, all lights within the property will immediately deactivate for five seconds -- and once they reactivate, the individual in question will have completely vanished. What exactly occurs during these five seconds is unclear, and all attempts to recover lost individuals have been unsuccessful.\n\nThe basis behind the actions required to proceed through SCP-6066 is unclear, and ordinarily their arbitrary nature would prevent expeditions from making any progress at all. However, evidence suggests that a secondary anomaly is present within SCP-6066: even in cases where those dispatched have not been informed of prior expeditions or the actions that resulted in their failure, there have been no reported cases of subsequent expeditioners making those same errors or failing to make further progress.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Expedition Log 6066-1**\n[[/=]]\n\nThe following is a curated record of expeditions taken into SCP-6066 during the research process. Extraneous logs have been removed from this record, but are available upon request.\n\nIndividual logs consist of the subject in question, the point in SCP-6066 they reached prior to failure, and a summary of the individual expedition. Prior to the expedition, all subjects were equipped with a mounted camera to document their experiences.\n\n> **Subject:** D-6066-1\n> \n> **Failure Location:** Kitchen\n> **Expedition Summary:** Subject opens back door of SCP-6066 and enters kitchen.

Subject then turns around and walks to the kitchen counter. Subject opens the drawer and retrieves two dinner forks, placing one on the counter and putting the other in their pocket.\n> \n> Subject returns to the kitchen door and opens it, entering the hallway -- two doors are visible on the left side of the hallway, and a staircase leading downwards on the right. Numerous paintings of phoenixes, skeletons and eggs are visible on the walls. One of the fifteen cats visible in the hallway rubs their face against D-6066-7's leg. \n> \n> Failure immediately occurs.\n\n> **Subject:** D-6066-15\n> \n> **Failure Location:** Stairs\n> **Expedition Summary:** Subject opens back door of SCP-6066 and enters kitchen.

Numerous paintings of skeletons and eggs are visible on the walls. One of the twenty-one cats visible in the hallway attempts to rub their face against D-6066-15's leg, but they step over it and proceed down the hallway, knocking twice on each of the doors on the left as they pass them.\n> \n> Upon reaching the stairs, subject bows respectfully to the gathered felines and begins walking down the stairs.\n> \n> Failure immediately occurs.\n\n> **Subject:** D-6066-19\n> \n> **Failure Location:** Stairs\n> **Expedition Summary:** Subject opens back door of SCP-6066 and enters kitchen.

Numerous paintings of kittens are visible on the walls. One of the twenty-one cats visible in the hallway attempts to rub their face against D-6066-19's leg, but they step over it and proceed down the hallway, knocking twice on each of the doors on the left as they pass them.\n> \n> Upon reaching the stairs, subject bows respectfully to the gathered felines and begins walking down the stairs, skipping every second step. Each time a cat is encountered on the stairs, subject covers their ears with their hands and ignores their mewling. This repeats six times as they proceed down the stairs.\n> \n> At the end of the stairs, subject reaches a large wooden door. Subject knocks on the door and speaks: \"Hello?\"\n> \n> Failure immediately occurs.\n\n> **Subject:** D-6066-20\n> \n> **Failure Location:** Stairs\n> **Expedition Summary:** [EXTRANEOUS INFORMATION EXCISED]\n> \n> At the end of the stairs, subject reaches a large wooden door.

Subject knocks on the door and speaks: \"Could you please tell me about yourself?\"\n> \n> The door opens and the subject enters.\n> \n> Inside is a small room containing numerous disconnected bathroom installations such as toilets and shower units. An elderly Bengal tiger is visible lounging on an upside-down bathtub. It is surrounded by at least sixty cats of various breeds, all of which are displaying poses of supplication. Subject bows respectfully to the tiger before approaching.\n> \n> After staring at the tiger for a period of sixty seconds, D-6066-25 can be heard speaking the following words:\n> \n> //\"What am I doing here? I'm just... acting in a way that's true to myself, I suppose. Just holding myself together. It's nothing big. You're the same, right? Exactly the same. I've been watching. Living a life is like sharpening a sword -- you just get rid of everything you don't need, everything that gets in the way of the path of your actual existence.\"//\n> \n> //\"Every day I look more and more like myself. That's my duty as a living thing.\"//\n> \n> See Addendum 6066-1 for further information.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 6066-1 (Final Expedition Aftermath)**\n[[/=]]\n\nAt the end of D-6066-25's expedition, all lights in SCP-6066 deactivated and reactivated in a manner consistent with a failed expedition.\n\nUpon reactivation of the lights, however, on-site personnel observed that no cats were visible through the windows or doors of SCP-6066. After an eight-hour period of further observation during which no further changes occurred on SCP-6066's exterior, D-6066-26 was dispatched to perform an internal investigation. This inspection went forward without incident, with footage confirming that all previously observed cats had disappeared from the premises, and that SCP-6066's usual anomalous properties were also absent.\n\nIn the basement of SCP-6066, where the final expedition ended, no trace of either D-6066-25 or the elderly Bengal tiger were present. Instead, next to D-6066-25's broken camera, a Bengal tiger cub -- estimated to be six months old at the oldest -- was found. D-6066-26 was instructed to recover this cub for further investigation. \n\nFull analysis of the recovered feline has not yet been conducted, but exterior inspection of the body displays definite signs of Victorian-era windows and brickwork.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6065]]] | SCP-6066 | [[[SCP-6067]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
