All known instances are to be documented in order to track potential exposure to SCP-8883 among relevant medical workers.  Access to this catalogue is available upon request.\n\nWorldwide medical imaging infrastructure has been remotely updated to automatically detect SCP-8883.  Upon detection, these systems will temporarily cease normal operations in a manner appearing to result from mundane technical malfunctions.\n\nIn the case of high-profile SCP-8883-A instances[[footnote]]Instances whose unexplained illnesses/deaths would arouse public suspicion - such instances are noted in the aforementioned catalogue.[[/footnote]] attempting to receive medical care that would necessitate the use of medical imaging, anomalous treatment methods will be provided via undercover Foundation doctors, followed by an amnestic regimen.  Standard amnestics are to be used on instances deemed low-profile or untreatable, along with relevant medical professionals and family where necessary.  Any medical complications experienced by these instances are considered acceptable losses.  The development of medical imaging methods and cost-effective anomalous treatment immune to SCP-8883's effects is currently headed by Dr. Wyatt.\n\nSCP-8883-A instances employed by the Foundation are to have their status as such noted on their medical records.  These individuals are exempt from medical imaging, and are eligible for aforementioned anomalous treatment regardless of security level.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|Your hand moves to the ribs on your left side.  The bones stick out just a little more than they should.  As you take a deep breath, you slowly rub your thumb up and down, feeling the stiffness of each bone beneath your skin.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**Description:**  SCP-8883 is an anomalous phenomena in which an individual (designated as SCP-8883-A)’s internal components—including all organs, muscles, bones, and bodily fluids[[footnote]]Eyes, teeth, and oral cavities are unaffected in all instances.[[/footnote]]—appear as a random assortment of animal viscera when viewed via medical imaging.  Said biomass consists of partially decomposed carcasses, organs, bones, musculature, and fecal matter from various species of cows, pigs, chickens, fish, and other livestock animals.  Smaller amounts of flies, maggots, and other insects are also usually seen infesting these tissues.\n\nThis effect only manifests via medical imaging systems, including (but not limited to) x-rays, CT scans, ultrasounds, and thaumaturgic imaging.  Methods that involve direct viewing of an instance's internals, such as endoscopies or surgeries, are unaffected.  The internal structure of each SCP-8883-A instance appears to be unique, though new viscera may manifest as an instance matures. The contents of this biomass have not been known to decompose further beyond its initial manifestation.\n\nDespite this, SCP-8883-A instances appear to be physically normal.  Through extensive testing, it has been determined that SCP-8883 does not directly alter an instance's biology or bodily functions in any way.  Instances are able to process food, respire, and reproduce[[footnote]]SCP-8883 does not affect a pregnant SCP-8883-A instance's fetus.[[/footnote]] no differently from baseline individuals.\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|You still remember your onboarding physical - sitting on that cold table as the CT scan machine hummed around you.  The technician's eyes widening at the display as you exited the machine, reassuring you that everything was fine despite her obviously frazzled tone of voice.##\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|As you were being ushered out, you caught the tiniest glimpse of your innards on the screen - a cow stomach taking up your entire left side.  Your hands filled with tiny, splintered bones and jumbles of impossibly long tendons without rhyme or reason.  Two eyes floating around a slurry of muscle, a giant cluster of maggots where your heart should be.##\n[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|The rest of your orientation was a blur.  Eventually, after days without answers, a gray haired man pulled you out of a meeting to introduce himself as 8883's head researcher - Dr. Wyatt.  He gave you a printout of the first SCP documentation you ever read - the very page you're on now.  After reassuring you time and time again that you'd be fine and that nothing was wrong with you, he asked if you had any questions.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|You asked if you could keep a copy of your scan.  Dr. Wyatt shook his head without asking you why.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n------\n\nThe process in which SCP-8883 manifests is believed to be instantaneous, as no partially affected SCP-8883-A instances have ever been documented.  It is unknown how widespread SCP-8883 is among the general populace, though it is estimated that between 4,000 and 12,000 new manifestations occur each year.  \n\nAll instances of SCP-8883-A identified thus far have previously been diagnosed with (or shown signs of) depression, body dysmorphia, or gender dysphoria.\n\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|Shocker.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|You've only ever met one other -A instance - the only other person in this entire organization who's shown you an ounce of real kindness.  You remember Dr. Wyatt's tired face, his eyes that seemed to hold no light at all, and the way he slumped a little as he told the story of how a broken finger eventually revealed the miasma of mush and organs that had replaced his insides.  How he agreed to head research and containment, and how he personally volunteered to have endless samples taken from his body and be sliced open again and again, just to confirm that he was indeed human like everyone else.##\n[[/size]]\n\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|Your eyes fall from the screen for a moment as your attention is brought to a dull sensation of pain.  Your hand has been clasped around your right arm for a while now - you've got a bad habit of digging your nails into your skin whenever you get too stressed.  You briefly let go to reveal the tiny scratches nestled between the bones in your arm, hard enough to scrape up the topmost layer of epidermis.##\n[[/size]]\n\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|A tiny dot of blood swells from where you've broken the skin.  You can smell it - it's disgusting.  Your attention moves back to the page, your hand returning to press down harder without even realizing it.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**Discovery of SCP-8883:**  SCP-8883 was first documented in 1934, due to advancements in medical technology allowing for easier identification of SCP-8883-A instances.  However, records of SCP-8883 attributed to faulty equipment and other anomalies have been found dating back 20 years prior.  SCP-8883 is not believed to exist prior to the invention of medical imaging.  Upon discovery, it was estimated that less than 300 new instances manifested per year, allowing SCP-8883 to go relatively undetected.\n\nManifestation of SCP-8883 has steadily increased over the past 80 years, with the most growth occurring since 2002.  This is believed to be due to an overall increase in the aforementioned conditions associated with SCP-8883.\n\nDue to inconclusive testing during SCP-8883's discovery, it was initially believed to be a memetic perception of one's physical innards as non-anomalous, rather than an alteration of imaging scans. As memetic and perception based anomalies became better understood, researchers concluded that this hypothesis was inaccurate. However, modern memetic testing is still not entirely conclusive.  Specifically, SCP-8883 often registers as a memetic anomaly only among SCP-8883-A instances.  This phenomena has never been replicated among non-affected individuals, and is believed to arise from a common belief among SCP-8883-A instances that SCP-8883 affects them physically, despite evidence to the contrary. Even so, this cognition is not anomalous in nature, and has been attributed to conditions associated with SCP-8883.\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|It can't just be some cognition.  It feels too real.  The bones in your face are wrong.  Your hands don't feel like they should.  The rhythmic pump of blood you can feel if you focus hard enough doesn't feel human.  It's real.  //It has to be real.//##\n[[/size]]\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|For weeks, you've had nightmares where you're standing before your bathroom mirror, frozen in place as your abdomen rips itself open before your eyes.  Your entrails spill across the floor of your bathroom, the scent of blood and dung and bugs hitting you like a truck as you weakly collapse to your knees.  Dozens of feet of intestines all squirming in unison, a litter of malformed piglets plopping onto the ground, squealing at you in terror.  When you open your mouth, you squeal back.  The buzz of flies, the feeling of whole udders squeezing out of you one by one, a thousand different flavors of mucus and pus escaping every orifice, finally revealing themselves after hiding in the dark for so long.  Finally answering the eternal question of what the hell is wrong with you.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[size smaller]]\n##5c0606|You are rotting.  You've been rotting this whole time.  Thank God.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n**SCP-8883's Effects on Medical Treatment:**  Though SCP-8883 does not inherently cause any health complications, the inaccuracy of SCP-8883-A instances' medical scans greatly hinders the diagnosis and treatment of a wide variety of other diseases[[footnote]]The number of deaths arising from lack of treatment is unknown, but is believed to be at least 5,000 since discovery.[[/footnote]]. While current containment procedures have been effective at keeping SCP-8883 hidden to the public, it does not mitigate this difficulty.  Research teams headed by Dr. Wyatt have made several advancements in new methods of medical imaging, though none thus far have been immune to SCP-8883's effects.\n\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|Oh, but it could be worse.  You could be dying of some horrible illness that nobody will ever find.  You should be grateful.##\n[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\nHowever, SCP-8883 does not directly hinder the body's ability to receive treatment or heal naturally.  Because of this, various anomalous treatment methods (including SCP-████ and SCP-████) have been used to treat instances without the use of medical imaging.  Attempts to extend the availability of such treatments to all SCP-8883-A instances in a cost-effective manner have been unsuccessful thus far.\n\nAll attempts to outright neutralize SCP-8883 have failed.  SCP-8883-A instances continue to show anomalous properties even after death.\n\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n[[size smaller]]##5c0606|There's no way out.
