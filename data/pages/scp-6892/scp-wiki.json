The mess is not cleanable.//\n\n//As of this memo, SCP-6892 is currently located in Research Room 3 of B-Wing. Do not remove SCP-6892, as I still have important work to finish.//\n\n//If staff report sightings of an individual displaying paranormal properties, such as intangibility or levitation, do not be alarmed. These are simply the properties of SCP-6892-1.//\n\n//To O'Hara and Director Roberts, I would like to extend a thank you for your constant attendance and prayers on the anniversary of my death; it means more than I could ever express.// \n\n- Snr.
