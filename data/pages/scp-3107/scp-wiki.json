Access to SCP-3107 is prohibited by order of Site-19 Administration. Individuals erroneously requesting access to SCP-3107 must submit to a mandatory psychological evaluation. Possible instances of SCP-3107-A are to be reclassified as Class-E personnel and detained.\n\nElectronic documentation regarding SCP-3107 and SCP-3107-A is considered non-anomalous. The full transcript is to be housed in a Site-19's Electronic Storage Unit, on rack 532-B.\n\n------\n\n**Description:** \n\n{{ **AN EXCEPTION HAS OCCURED!** \n ERR.MSG: Query on column S19.SCP.3107.DESC Exceeds maximum allowable data. Please alter search parameters.}}\n\n[[collapsible show=\">> ../RemoveDataLimitationAndResubmit.ksh\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n__Overview__\nSCP-3107 is an anomalous spherical construct measuring 20.32456 cm in diameter with a .000001cm margin of error. This error in measurement is a result of the 21,493 individual scratches on the surface of SCP-3107. See Note N-3107-460 for full documentation on the length, width and depth of each individual scratch on SCP-3107. SCP-3107 weighs an estimated 11305.55503 grams. This differs from the calculated weight of a non-anomalous, solid aluminum sphere of the same size by 559.373 grams, suggesting that SCP-3107 is hollow. See Note-392-A for full documentation on estimations of SCP-3107's interior cavity.\n\nIn certain conditions, SCP-3107 emits acoustic noises similar to that of chime. The noise is played in C-Major at 63.3445433db with an average variation of .003456612db across all 340,512 recorded occurancess of this anomaly. See Note N-3107-341 for full documentation on individual noises emitted from SCP-3107. This noise played in response to certain stimuli.\n\nFor full documentation on instances of SCP-3107-A, see Notes N-3107-A-1 for an overview and Notes N-3107-A-2 through N-3107-A-10457 for detailed errata regarding SCP-3107-A.\n\n**Notes:**\n__Note-3107-1__\n{{<div class=\"ac_granted description\" style=\"display:block>\n@@  <?php@@\n@@      if(!verified){@@\n@@        echo '<a href=\"' . htmlspecialchars(\"/termination.php?SCP=3107&@@\n@@        stage=23&data=\" .urlencode($critical_data)) .

Due to the lack of [DATA EXPUNGED], it was later discovered that the box was a fake; SCP-3107 holds no relation to Dr. Wondertainment Incorporated. Research is ongoing to determine if the intent of the fabrication was to deliberately have SCP-3107 placed in Foundation custody.\n------\n**Testing Log**\n> __A Foreword:__\n> Most of the recordings on file have been redacted for brevity.

Site-19 administration was made aware of erratic behavior in researchers studying SCP-3107, following reports of \"the horrifying stench of rotting flesh.\" Upon investigation, the remains of D-3107-1 were recovered. All researchers studying SCP-3107 were reclassified as SCP-3107-A and administered psychological treatment. Amnestics have proven incapable of lifting the cognitohazardous properties of SCP-3107.\n\n@@ @@\n------\n@@ @@\n**Addendum:** \n> //I was a good friend of 3107-A-1, back when we still called him Dr. Winslow.
