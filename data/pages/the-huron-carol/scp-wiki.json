Though not a religious man, as Chair of Theology and Teleology at [http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43#TT Site-43] religion was often on his mind. On this particularly pointless evening he'd been pondering the life of a long-dead Jesuit, and had eventually pulled up the notepad on his PDA to vent his Christmas blues. Jean de Brébeuf had brought smallpox and Christianity to Huronia some three hundred and fifty years ago; he'd been burned at the stake for his trouble, many miles down the shore from the forest beneath which the Site now sat. Before that fiery finale, the poxy priest had composed the \"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khQlkRcTdN0 Huron Carol]\" in the Wyandot tongue to fob his God on the locals. The retranslated tune was good and creepy, like most memorable Christmas carols, not least because of the context of impending doom hanging over every word.\n\nThe smallpox-related tangent hadn't been accidental. As if on cue, the same warning that had popped up on his PDA every fifteen minutes for the past week again made its appearance:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#F2E0C2; padding-left:12px; padding-right:12px; padding-top:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION EMERGENT THREAT TACTICAL RESPONSE AUTHORITY \n\n[[f>image ETTRA.png]]Lake Huron Research and Containment Site-43 has experienced a containment breach.

He didn't imagine a new one had suddenly appeared between blinks; he didn't imagine any of the stacks were suddenly a little bit taller, or that perhaps an extra CD had popped into existence between the ones he could see. Totally unburdened with a creative impulse of any sort, he gazed contentedly at the static pile of storage media.\n\nAfter two straight hours of silence, Dr. Daniil Sokolsky finally addressed him: \"What're you doing?\"\n\nWettle did not glance across the lab to where Sokolsky sat behind a cluttered desk, redacting colour printouts and frowning. \"Classified.\"\n\nSokolsky raised an eyebrow. \"Classified? I'm clearance level //five.// You're level, what, two?\"\n\nThis time Wettle did look at him. \"TWO? I'm a full researcher! Level three.\" He looked back at the CDs, untroubled by the thought that he might have missed the appearance of a new one. \"Anyway, I'm doing a replication study.\"\n\n//Of course you are,// thought Sokolsky. \"What're you replicating?\"\n\n\"Okay, well, you know how if you die, and you have a lot of CDs, sometimes a new one appears full of all the awful stuff you thought you deleted?\"\n\nSokolsky kept his breathing even by dint of tremendous effort. \"You mean [[[SCP-5751]]], a file on which I, Daniil Sokolsky, are the researcher of notice?\"\n\nWettle nodded. \"Yeah, that one. Well, I'm trying to see if the extra disc shows up when the collection is being monitored.\" He pointed at the CDs. \"These belonged to Dr. Phillips.\"\n\n\"Thought Phillips would have CD-I,\" Sokolsky remarked.\n\nWettle blinked, still staring straight forward. He did not respond, which meant he did not understand. He did not respond often.\n\nSokolsky sighed again. \"Phillips is the guy who got crushed by his own bookcase last week? At, ah, 17?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Nothing good ever happens there.\"\n\n\"What if he never deleted anything awful? Maybe there's no extra CD to generate.\"\n\nWettle scoffed. \"He worked at //17.//\"\n\n\"Okay, that's fair.\" Sokolsky stood up from the desk, and stretched. \"But you know, sometimes the anomaly just plain doesn't happen.\" \n\nWettle shrugged. \"Science doesn't care.\"\n\nSokolsky walked over to him. \"How many replication studies does it take to prove that something //isn't// happening, anyway?\"\n\nWettle shrugged again. \"You can never have too many.\"\n\nAfter another few minutes of silence, Sokolsky pulled up a chair and sat down. They stared at the discs together as a ticking clock marked the progress of the hour.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nThey are a cold and callous lot\nWho face a daily doom,\nBut in the heat of jeopardy\nThe rose of love may bloom;\nOur tinder hearts can find a spark\nThat's buried deep within the dark;\nEven down in the pits,\nKeep looking up;\nChristmastime in quarantine!\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nShe gently closed the door behind them. The halls of Habitation and Sustenance resounded with a funereal silence; the lack of sound was almost deafening, broken only by the soft //click// of the lock. She glanced at the nameplate for a moment, as she always did, feeling the usual inexplicable rush of warmth.\n\n[[=image Door.png]]\n\n\"We still good?\" Phil asked.\n\nAmelia checked her tablet. \"Yep. 43NET says there's nobody else in the halls, and it'll keep our path clear. Praise be to Big Brother.\"\n\n\"Amen.\" \n\nShe was carrying a bundle of assorted holiday nonsense — chocolate, candy, cheap little toys, Christmas crackers, and a card. It was all wrapped up in clear plastic, upon which the distorted image of Phil's constant companion, Doug, had manifested. Doug was humming an eerie tune; Phil chose to think of it as his version of a Christmas carol. The bundle was attached to a string of helium balloons, which bounced back and forth and rubbed against each other noisily. One of them was also transparent; from time to time, to seek a better vantage point from which to stare fixedly at Phil, Doug apparated on it as well.\n\n\"Whose idea was this?\" Phil asked, as he locked the door with his key.\n\n\"Mine,\" she said. They started down the hall, one of his arms around her shoulders, one of hers around his waist. \"But I ran it by the other Chairs and Chiefs first. We've all got provisional clearance to know about [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5520 5520], but we're not supposed to be interacting with it. Our little secret.\" She glanced at him. \"Our little secret, too.\"\n\nHe nodded.\n\nThey walked in contented silence for a while, Doug still humming — though only Phil could hear it — and keeping otherwise uncharacteristically mum. Phil was almost sorry when they finally reached a thick vault door with a complex key lock, and Amelia detached herself from him to put the package down.\n\nShe tapped a long series of numbers into the pad, spun the vault lock handle, took a deep breath and opened the heavy door.\n\nThey were looking into an impossibly deep, seemingly endless gulf in the rock, a narrow chasm which stretched down and onward to an extent which he immediately knew was anomalous. The far end of the cleft terminated in a gargantuan tangle of machinery, scaffolding, switchback stairs, pipes, chimneys... all of it lit by what had to be thousands of sharp white stars, industrial-grade spotlights, floodlights and wall fixtures. It was the most magical, unreal, terrifying thing he'd ever seen.\n\nHe looked at Amelia. She was staring at a fixed point far away, somewhere between where they stood — he looked down and realized that the door opened onto a sheer drop, and his stomach turned — and the eternal factory beyond. As his eyes adjusted to the weird play of light and dark, he saw what she was looking at: the silhouette of a man, standing on a ledge cropped out from the cavern wall. Phil couldn't tell if the man was looking at them, or at the factory. He had an uneasy feeling that it might be both.\n\n\"How long has he been down there?\" Phil asked. He was so lost in thought that the words came out sounding comically natural.\n\n\"Decades,\" she said, the same dreamlike quality on her face. \"More than half a century.\"\n\nHe didn't know what made him do it, but he knelt down on the floor and stuck his arm through the door. He felt underneath, scooching closer to give him some extra reach. The door was sat on what felt like a very solid metal beam, more than a foot thick... but the beam seemed to be hanging over nothing at all.\n\nHe stood back up. \"This really goes underneath the entire Site, doesn't it.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" She picked up the bundle again and looked at it thoughtfully. \"Yeah, he's always down there beneath us, wherever we go. Some days he knows what's up, some days he doesn't. I&T gets messages from him; they're not happy messages. I don't think he wants to be down there.\"\n\nThe silhouette was unmoving. \"Then why don't they bring him back up?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"That's above my pay grade.\" She looked down at the bundle. \"In fact, there's a good chance we'll get in shit for doing this, but... \" She shrugged. \"We're stuck in here for a few days. He's stuck in there all the time, and nobody ever visits.\"\n\nNeither of them had stopped looking at the silhouette; they were both pleased when their hands found each other anyway, and linked together.\n\n\"Well, let's do it,\" said Phil.\n\nShe thrust the package through the door, and let go. It gently floated towards the distant lights, the colourful balloons an almost absurd contrast against the dark, desaturated canyon. Doug rode them down for a while, staring back at Phil as he always had and always would, before disappearing suddenly; Phil knew, without looking, that the gaunt grey face was now observing him from the face of his wristwatch.\n\nWas it their imagination, or did the figure's head tilt back perceptibly, watching the gaudy gift descend?\n\n\"Merry Christmas, Dr. Rydderech,\" Amelia whispered, and closed the door.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nChief Eileen Veiksaar sang along enthusiastically.

In two distinct voices.\n\nShe keyed her radio. \"Bremmel's fine. He's in the Arms lab.\"\n\nThe voice of Dr. Helena Forsythe bounced back to her: \"Breaking things, I imagine?\"\n\n\"Yep. And yelling at his new assistant.\" She adjusted her uniform jumpsuit and continued down the hall. \"Who's next?\"\n\nThere was a pause of several seconds before Forsythe responded. \"Elstrom had the sniffles this morning. 43NET says she's in her office; let's make sure it's just the sniffles.\"\n\nIbanez didn't work in Security and Containment anymore; she now led the Site's MTF detachments. But with everyone confined to quarters, or at least confined to their workspaces, that role was on hold. She'd been drafted into wellness check duty, as she had what Health and Pathology considered a near-flawless immune system.\n\n\"Any new patients?\"\n\nThis time the pause was longer, and Ibanez nearly radioed again when Forsythe finally answered. \"Three, maintenance techs. Pensak brought them in. Infection rate's stayed slow but steady all day; just us indispensables, getting expended.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Ibanez wished she had a flashlight, or maybe a billy club, to drag along the walls or tap the windows with. She felt like a cop in a period piece movie, walking the empty streets at night. This was more or less acceptable to her; some fictional cops were alright.\n\nShe stopped dead at the sound of coughing, from up around the bend. She pulled her facemask up over her mouth and nose, and turned the corner.\n\n\"Shit.\" Dr. Karen Elstrom was lying on the hall floor, gasping for air. She'd managed to twist herself around when she fell; Ibanez knelt beside her and carefully, carefully set her torso back into a breathable position. The coughing stopped.\n\n\"Need a stretcher and a friend outside Elstrom's office,\" Ibanez said into her radio. \"Got another present for you, Helena.\"\n\n\"Decked,\" Elstrom muttered.\n\n\"What's that?\" Ibanez fought the urge to lean closer.\n\n\"Decked,\" Elstrom muttered again. \"In the halls.\"\n\nIbanez laughed. \"Stay jolly, Karen.

It was a respiratory disease, that much was clear; not as virulent or as deadly as COVID, but still enough to shut down the entire Site.\n\n\"Seems awfully blunt, for an Are We Cool Yet joint,\" McInnis mused as they walked into Intake Point 94. They were two hundred meters below the surface of Lake Huron, in a dome composed of one-way glass. The murk around them was impenetrable; the dim lights in the small observation room extended only a few feet beyond the bubble.\n\nThey dropped their packs carefully and sat down together on one of several benches facing the lakebed. \"AWCY is like Anonymous,\" the Chief mused. \"Can't boil them down to one approach.

Here's something to be thankful for.\"\n\nThe Chief raised an eyebrow. \"That the Bowmore 25 Year?\" He walked to the glass wall, placed the bowl on the floor, and emptied the pouch into the bowl.\n\nMcInnis nodded, pointing. \"That red willow tobacco?\"\n\nThe Chief nodded back. \"Purification, respect for the balance, and the promise of good tidings.

Then two more. Then two more.\n\nMcInnis raised a cup to them, as the smoky aromas of tobacco and Scotch washed over him. \"Do they know it's Christmas?\"\n\nThe Chief laughed again. A shadow passed overhead, plunging the chamber into complete darkness. A moment later, something vast, sinuous and spined writhed past the glass in front of them, obscuring the shining eyes, and then it was all gone. They were alone again.\n\nMcInnis spoke first. \"That's a new one.\"\n\nThe All-Sections Chief shook his head. \"Old one. Very, very old one.\"\n\nA sad kind of trumpeting sound warbled through the water as they soundlessly tapped their plastic cups together, and drank deep.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\nO ye who would protect us,\nTo your own salvation look;\nGo not abroad securing, but\nStay home and read a book;\nEnshrine this fact within your head:\nIt could be worse, you could be dead;\nMerry Christmas one and all,\nIf that's your thing;\nGood luck with your quarantine!\n [[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n<< **[[[SCP-5866]]]** | **[/on-guard-43-hub Words of Power and Poison]** | **[/the-time-after-time-password-hub The Time After Time Password]** >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Door.png\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]] and [[*user Woedenaz]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** All other .jpg/.png files\n> **Author:**  [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
