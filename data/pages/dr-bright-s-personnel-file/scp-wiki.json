Whether this is natural, or a function of 963, is both unknown, and untestable.\n\nJack acts as the unofficial bookie of the Foundation. If someone is betting on it, there's better then even chance that Doc is holding the books. We could shut him down, but it serves as a needed distraction for many of the researchers.\n\nDr. Bright somehow has been given access over the personnel files. We don't know how this happened, but it sure is entertaining.\n\n//O5 Note://Do not allow Dr. Bright to know, but several of his overwrites have been allowed to live, to work on special projects. Dr Brights 2-7 are assigned as follows [Data Redacted]\n\n**Addendum**\nFor complete list of Dr. Brights infractions, please see [[[the-things-dr-bright-is-not-allowed-to-do-at-the-foundation |the official list of things Dr. Bright is no longer allowed to do at the foundation.]]] If more infractions are discovered, please feel free to add them. -O5-6\n\n**Note:** //Oook, ook ook ook, eek. Oook, eeeek. Oook ook eek eek, ook ook ok. OOOOOOK. Oook. Ook ook.// -MB\n\n**Note:** //...The hell? Who the fuck wrote that? I resent those implications about my mother, damn it!// -Dr. Bright\n\n**Note:** //Dr. Bright: When did this [http://www.scp-wiki.net/video-logs information leak] first come into existence?
