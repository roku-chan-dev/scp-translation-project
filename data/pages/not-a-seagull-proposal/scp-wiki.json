Personnel at Site-05 and -06 are to enter ALERT LEVEL 8 and begin evaluating new methods of containing SCP-001.</p>\n<p>Site-05 has been constructed around Point Alpha. Procedure 001-ENTRY is in effect to contain SCP-001-1. A monitor containing Document 032, as well as a speaker reading the document, are to be placed at least five meters away from SCP-001-1. If SCP-001-1 swells up to 2 meters or more in diameter, the speed of the narration is to increase. This system is to have a direct cable link to the Foundation SCiPNET database at Site-06, and several redundant power generators are to ensure this system stays operational at all times.</p>\n<p><b>Description:</b> SCP-001 is an ongoing ZK-Class \"Reality Failure\" Scenario. SCP-001 is prevented from happening through several procedures manipulating its sub-anomalies. The only known observable symptom of SCP-001 is the sky becoming a different color; it is believed that, if SCP-001 were to progress to the point where other symptoms began to occur, it would become irreversible.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-1 is a levitating object contained within Point Alpha, a cave chamber five kilometers south of the ruins of Babylon. SCP-001-1 visually resembles a perfectly smooth sphere with a texture similar to blurred television static. Measurement instruments indicate SCP-001-1 is currently <span class=\"rndiam\"></span> meters in diameter. Solids and liquids that pass within the bounds of SCP-001-1 are replaced entirely with argon gas, giving the illusion of disappearing.</p>\n<p>SCP-001-2 is an entity that is capable of being seen within Point Alpha. SCP-001-2's manifestations are random; witnesses report seeing SCP-001-2 \"past the walls of the cave.\" From descriptions of eyewitnesses, SCP-001-2 is humanoid in shape and large in stature, and is only visible when looking through SCP-001-1. Descriptions of SCP-001-2 vary from person to person; common features include an emaciated figure, long limbs, and prominent facial features. SCP-001-2 takes the position of lying against the wall. It is most often seen with a neutral expression; however, the expression occasionally changes to discomfort or bliss.</p>\n<p>It has been determined from historical precedent that \"entertaining\" SCP-001-2 through SCP-001-1 will prevent SCP-001.</p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-left\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/not-a-seagull-proposal/cave.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\" alt=\"cave.jpg\" class=\"image\" />\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>Point Alpha shortly after it was acquired by the Foundation, with Agents Samuel and Boise performing preliminary evaluation. SCP-001-1 not visible.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><b>History:</b> Point Alpha and its contents are believed to date back to prehistory. Babylonian scripts indicate that SCP-001-1 was routinely patrolled by a group of sages, known as the \"Order of White and Black,\" who refused passage to anyone who could demonstrate the ability to read or write.</p>\n<p>This group was made defunct by the rise of Achaemenid Persia, which contained SCP-001-1 with a group of Zoroastrian monks. Very few accounts of SCP-001-1 are present; recovered accounts assert that all information about SCP-001-1 and its significance was passed orally.</p>\n<p>The most substantial account of SCP-001-1 and SCP-001-2 at this time dates back to the Greek philosopher Xera, who made an expedition into the Achaemenid Empire and found Point Alpha. During Alexander of Macedon's conquest of the Achaemenid Empire, he took interest in Xera's texts and continued the Achaemenid containment of SCP-001-1. However, this new institution, known as the \"Cronus Guard\", was given Greek epics to read in order to \"punish Cronus\" for his actions. This institution lasted through the partition of Macedon into the Seleucid Empire, the rise of the Sassanid Empire, and even the formation of the Rashidun Caliphate.</p>\n<p>The Cronus Guard were eventually replaced with an Islamic equivalent: \"The Society for the Containment of the Babel Demon.\" This group was the first to perform substantial research on SCP-001-1, and the first to accurately link SCP-001 to SCP-001-1.</p>\n<div class=\"socotbd\">\n<p style=\"font-size: 82%\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"toggle('socotbd');\">View Attachment: Excerpts from the notes of the Society for the Containment of the Babel Demon</a></p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"socotbd collapsed\">\n <p style=\"font-size: 82%\"><a href=\"javascript:;\" onclick=\"toggle('socotbd');\">\nClose Attachment</a></p>\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img src=\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/not-a-seagull-proposal/book.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\" alt=\"book.jpg\" class=\"image\" />\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>Records from the Society for the Containment of the Babel Demon, recovered in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century within ORIA archives.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Literature Read:</b> The first quatrain of the <i>Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam</i></p>\n<p><b>Result:</b> DEMON squirms but otherwise does not react.

New literature may be necessary to prevent further phenomena from occurring.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<p>The Society was eventually absorbed into the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts, who assumed containment of SCP-001-1. After Incident 001-EXAL, the Foundation purchased Point Alpha from ORIA for a large sum of currency and several Safe-class anomalies.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<center>\n<hr class=\"smaller-g\" />\n<p class=\"adden\">Incident 001-EXAL</p>\n<hr class=\"smaller-g\" />\n</center>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p style=\"font-size: 82%\"><i>Note: Some documentation taken from ORIA's account of Incident 001-EXAL.</i></p>\n<p>On <span id=\"today\"></span>, personnel with ORIA read the book <i>Tafsir al-Ahlam al-kabir</i>, or \"Great Book of Interpretation of Dreams\" as per normal containment of SCP-001-1. However, SCP-001-2 was observed to rapidly thrash while screaming. SCP-001-1 itself swelled from 50.3 centimeters to 3.2 meters in diameter.</p>\n<p>Shortly following this event, SCP-001 began to worsen. The sky worldwide turned a black/white color similar to the texture of SCP-001-1. In addition, reality bending phenomena began worldwide, causing deformed geography, the manifestation of dangerous anomalous objects and several natural disasters. This event was ended after ORIA personnel read SCP-001-1 an undisclosed number of as-of-yet unread books, which caused SCP-001-2 to stop thrashing and SCP-001 to restore to its pre-incident point. However, the damage caused by this incident was deemed enough to require an activation of <a target=\"_top\" href=\"/scp-2000\">SCP-2000</a>.</p>\n<p>This prompted the Foundation to take control of containment of SCP-001.
