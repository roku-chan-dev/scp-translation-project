And it’s ‘Ben’, remember?”\n> \n> Dr. Gears:  “I have been informed of your civilian designation.  I request that you accompany me to Testing Area 8-B for evaluation and testing of your ‘wireless’ connection to the Internet.”\n> \n> SCP-1016:  “Hey, I already said I wouldn’t do anything you guys don’t want me to.  Besides, you can’t really block me…I’m behind seven proxies!”  (Several seconds of laughter)\n> \n> Dr. Gears:  “…if you would accompany me immediately, we can conclude testing in a timely fashion.”\n> \n> SCP-1016:  (appears somewhat hurt and sulking) “…Ok.  Jeeze, lighten up man…”\n> \n> (Dr. Gears and SCP-1016 exit the containment area.  Site Maintenance enters after several minutes and begins collection and disposal of SCP-1016 personal effects.)\n\n------\n\n**Excerpt from Termination Order 1881712-DDrt-1016:**\n\n“..Due to our continued inability to prevent SCP-1016 from accessing the internet, its extremely destructive and poorly-controlled rage states, and multiple containment breaches via unauthorized server access, it has been determined that SCP-1016, in its current state, is too much of a security risk.  Measures MK118 and A-517 are to be taken immediately, to reduce…”\n\n------\n\n**Surveillance Log x8B11███, Date █-██-███**\n\n> (Dr. Gears and SCP-1016 enter testing area 8-B)\n> \n> SCP-1016:  “Holy crap…that’s a big friggin’ server!  What’s with all the tools…want me to take it apart for ya?  Or maybe I get to upgrade again!”  (Several seconds of laughter)\n> \n> Dr. Gears:  “No, however you will be interacting with this system today.  There is a file sequence inside this system that has become deeply encrypted.  Please decrypt and access it.”\n> \n> SCP-1016:  “Sweet!  Hey doc, can you get me some vitamins?  I’m hungry as hell…this shouldn’t take long at all, I’ll be done by the time you’re back!”\n> \n> Dr. Gears:  “I am required to remain present for the entirety of the testing period.”\n> \n> SCP-1016:  “Okay, fine… whatever, man” (mumbles several inaudible words, before closing eyes and ‘interfacing” with the provided server.\n> \n> (Eight minutes pass without incident, apart from small grunts or laughter from SCP-1016)\n> \n> SCP-1016:  “Phew, that thing was buried!  Still, nothing…I…what is…WWWWWHAAA(inarticulate noises)\n> \n> (SCP-1016 begins to thrash on the floor, holding its skull and bashing its forehead several times into the ground.  Several fluids begin to leak from the body of SCP-1016, later identified as oil, coolant, and silicone)\n>  \n> Dr. Gears:  “Initial contact made.  Initiating second stage decommissioning.”\n> \n> (Dr. Gears removes several screwdrivers and a large set of pliers from a tool case.  SCP-1016 appears to be slowing down.)\n\n------\n\n**Excerpt from Termination Order 1881712-DDrt-1016:**\n\n“…While the full destruction of SCP-1016 is warranted, the individual components have a level of research value that precludes this action.  Memetic Kill Agent 11010 will be issued directly to the processing centers of SCP-1016, “burning out” the areas controlling personality, will, and other psychological traits.  This will revert SCP-1016 to a “component parts” state, thereby allowing the initiation of the second stage of decommissioning.\n\nStage two will involve the physical break down of SCP-1016.  Non-essential biological components are to be disposed of, with essential biological components fitted with nutrient bath capsules to sustain operations.  The bulk of the components…”\n\n------\n\n**Post-Incident psychological evaluation transcript excerpt:**\n\n> Dr. Glass: \"Alright, let's see here... so, you doing okay Gears?  Everything okay up there?\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"I assure you, my mental state is in no way impaired.\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"So, I heard you decommissioned Ben.\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"This is correct. That is in fact, the reason for this evaluation. I expect you were aware of this.\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"Uh .. yeah.  So, listen, how are you feeling about that?  No .. guilt, or regret, or angst of any sort?\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"No sir. I was asked to perform my duty in as timely and efficient manner as possible. I did so. I do not see the reason for possible mental or emotional degradation.”\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"Well, you just cooked the brains of a partially living being until they leaked out of his head.\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"I still fail to see...\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"You tore out ...\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"... the possible cause of ...\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"His heart, with a screwdriver, while it was still beating...\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: (Silence)\n> \n> Dr. Glass: (Silence)\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"SCP-1016 needed to be decommissioned. I did so. The physical configuration of SCP-1016 makes no difference.\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass. \"Right, well, how does this make you feel?\" [Holds up a flash card of a cartoon kitten about to be run over by a truck]\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"I don't understand. It appears imminent that the kitten is -\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"Yeah, okay, the usual.\"\n> \n> Dr. Gears: \"Are we done here then?\"\n> \n> Dr. Glass: \"Yessir. I'll just keep you under 'axiomatic preoccupations with duty, and complete lack of empathy' as always.  Good eve, Gears.\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
