  "content": "+ Are you Ok?\n\nIt was bright outside the den. When the insects stopped their buzzing, she noticed the others had already ventured far. There was only one resting in the patches now. She tried to approach him, but he kept getting further away. He opened his eyes and after a  wink, took off.\n\nShe raced after his shadow, her a hare behind, him a cloud out of reach. Dew leapt in the air with her stride across the wet ground. The gap still widened. He pretended not to notice her so far below.\n\nThey reached a field introducing the thicket ahead where she knew not to go. He stood in the center, face still enough to see the quiver of his whiskers. She paused, planning her next move.\n\n쿵…\n\n쿵…\n\nShe declared her challenge. The den they came from was now far in the distance, any further would be dangerous. As the thought pulled her focus, he escaped in the tall grass.\n\nShe faced the blades, hesitating. They opened so easily for him. But, she wasn’t going to lose after coming this far. She crossed into the forbidden garden after him.\n\nShe followed the sound of breaking bramble, until it was drowned out by the cry of frantic waters. There he was again, a leaf guided by gale, landing on the other side of the river.\n\n쿵~쿵~\n\n쿵~쿵~\n\nHer heart muttered as she pondered how to cross. But she would get across. Because if he could, she can. He was an idiot. The kind of dummy who would get in trouble just to make people mad. Just to make her mad. She was small, but she was not stupid.\n\nShe climbed up on a reed, clinging to it. She began a rhythm, swinging the reed closer to the other side with her weight. She hung on with all her might as the water tried to devour her. She was not weak.\n\nThe reed gave way before she did, tearing at the stem. But she let go before she lost herself in the waves. She grabbed the stem of another across with her ear outstretched.\n\nShe held on, catching glances as he binkied around before melting back into the mist. She was not stupid.\n\nHer eyes resisted the crash of wind and water long enough for her to leap to the other side. She trudged forward, forgetting its sound. She had to bring that dummy back.\n\nOne step. It only took one spot where the ground wasn’t firm to slip.\n\n쿵쿵!\n\n쿵쿵!\n\nThe world revolving, a mess of blue and brown with splotches of red until a white spark scared the color away.\n\nWhere was she now?\n\n쿵쿵…\n\nDown a mountain?\n\n쿵쿵…\n\nA cliff?\n\n쿵쿵…\n\nShe could hardly make sense of her surroundings. Where was that dummy?\n\nAn arm reached out from below her. It was her arm but it looked…wrong. Her grip on the ground was tight with the only paw she could feel.\n\n아빠? 엄마?\n\nShe struggled to flip over. Her legs, they also looked…wrong.\n\n할머님! 오빠! Where was everyone?\n\n쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~!\n\nShe began to weep as she lost strength. The tears made her eyes burn slower in the light reflecting through the mist. Her wails became a duo. A girl stared at her with eyes as large and wet as the sea.\n\n“Stop crying.\"\n\n쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~! 쿵~!\n\n\"Good. Now heal your legs.”\n\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/i-m-gonna-be-alright/offset/1|...I think I’m]]]\n[[/>]]",
