Mercator// ||~ Date || //May 06, 264// ||\n||~ Interest|| //High// ||~ Identifier|| //The Steeds of Destruction// ||\n|||||||| The head of an empire: The most prominent, and affluent, position one man can attain. _\nDesperation: The most effective driver of business dealings. _\nA combination of these factors has created an opportunity for immense profit. _\n _\nReaching out from captivity in Bishapur, Publius Licinius Valerianus Augustus has had delivered to me a request.  His petition is for an item capable of completely annihilating the Persian people.  Taken, in part, from his own words: \"A force to destroy every square foot of land on which they have ever walked.\" _\n _\nAs it is our endeavour to fulfill any desire our clients can afford, I solicited the services of a source capable of fulfilling such an order.  As expected, my supplier did not disappoint, and delivered in the form of six miniature statues.  Their effect is certain to satisfy our client's aspiration. _\n _\nAn act of spite worse than salting of fields!  These items are capable of transmuting water, the very essence of life itself, into a poisonous black tar incapable of sustaining anything, save for a burning flame.  Even a brief exposure is sufficient means to taint any source and cause sickness in the reliant populace. _\n _\nI can not comment on the conditions of the Emperor's accommodations in captivity.  I can, however, state with confidence that these items will provide him the means to take his vengeance, many times over. ||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| //G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3// ||\n||||||||~ Forum Tenebris||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||~ Tracking Information||\n||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Owner ||~ Date ||~ Comments||\n|| Unrecorded || Ca. 260 || Original creator of items.

There are developments afoot that will completely redefine their potential, and I am certain of my position to capitalize on this fact. _\n _\nIf I won't be selected to broker this deal, then you can be assured of my presence at the table as purchaser. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Rental Record 01||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Name ||~ Date ||~ Period ||~ Comments||\n|| Lewis Hart || June 2, 1971 || 12 months || (1 item) ||\n|| Lewis Hart || August 3, 1972 || 12 months || (2 items) Mr. Hart, it seems, has devised an efficient process for making use of the items. ||\n|| Lewis Hart || March 20, 1976 || 9 months || (3 items) Mr. Hart's operation continues to grow.

I shouldn't want to see them simply sit and gather dust while they aren't being rented out. _\n _\nI propose we explore the potential for operating our own refinery, and take advantage of the items while we retain them between contracts. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n||||||||~ Memo 02-B||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Sender || //Richard Dufresnes// ||~ Recipient || //Percy Swanson// ||\n|||||||| Your enthusiasm for seeking profits is admirable.  I ran this past the boys upstairs though, and was assured that the logistical needs of our enterprise are already well taken care of.  Furthermore, manipulating non-anomalous global markets (beyond what's necessary to maintain our own position) is beneath the interests of the organization. _\n _\nI understand this item's rates tend to be quite high, and few clients possess the means to take full advantage of its effect.  However, seeking such clients out, and selling them on the merits of this investment, //is// your job.  So make it happen. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Incident Report 01||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Author || //Percy Swanson// ||~ Date || //November 14, 1984// ||\n|||||||| A bidder at auction, determined to be a representative of Manna Charitable Foundation, attempted to purchase the item.  Their motivation was presumably to remove the item from circulation, as they have voiced concerns in the past regarding the potential for an environmental disaster created by the item's effect. _\n _\nOur own representative planted in the audience successfully outbid the MCF member, essentially purchasing the item from ourselves to sell at a later date.  Took a minor loss to maintain our assets in the long term. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 03||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Sender || //Richard Dufresnes// ||~ Recipient || //Kate Cohen// ||\n|||||||| This message is in response to your query to technical support.  There is not an error in the directory, the system has been updated to reflect Mr. Zev's assignment as primary broker for the Item Listing. _\n _\nI am aware there are some unsavoury rumours circulating regarding this action.  I'm not at liberty to address any of them specifically, however I can assure you that the decision was only made with the goal of advancing the firm's interests in mind. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 04||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Sender || //Sully Zev// ||~ Recipient || //Kate Cohen// ||\n|||||||| Clients wishing to rent these items as a complete set should be given priority over those requesting a single instance.  The profits of collecting the full rate for just one week vastly outweigh the item's earning potential when divided amongst several clients. _\n _\nAs we currently have all six pieces of the collection in our possession, this policy should be applied to all related interests moving forward. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Incident Report 02||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Author || //Sully Zev// ||~ Date || //August 30, 1999// ||\n|||||||| Manna Charitable Foundation, once again, attempted to acquire the item through an intermediary agent.  While feigning ignorance of their affiliations, I assessed their position and personally negotiated the transaction (ensuring the final figure would fall just beyond their means). _\n _\nThe client departed to obtain the remaining balance, but never returned to complete the transaction.  After a courteous 30-day waiting period, during which all attempts to contact the client failed, both the item and the partial payment were retained by MC&D, Ltd.  Said payment more than covered the cost of 'the cleaners', netting us a tidy profit on the whole ordeal. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Incident Report 03||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Author || //Sully Zev// ||~ Date || //April 05, 2004// ||\n|||||||| A client who, apparently, did not fully understand the item's requirements for use expressed great disappointment in their acquisition.  It seems all their water had been sourced from a man-made reservoir, and was not subject to the item's effect.  I met with the client to negotiate their early withdrawal from the contracted rental agreement. _\n _\nAt the meeting the client demanded a full refund, which I informed him was simply not possible.  The client insisted on escalating the confrontation, at which point my personal security detail was forced to intervene.  The full price of rental was retained, and the items returned to MC&D, Ltd's possession. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Memo 05||\n||||||||~ G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3 ||\n||~ Sender || //Kate Cohen// ||~ Recipient || //Terrence H. Swanson// ||\n|||||||| I'm sending this memo only because you've ignored my attempts to address the issue informally.  It is in regard to the provisional changes which, as yet, still appear in the Heading attached to this Item Listing.  [[[broker-bailer-grifter-thief|The SCP Foundation's raid on our New York assets]]] was three months ago now, and this 'temporary indication of status' should have been finalized by this point. _\n _\nI am aware of your personal opinion of Mr. Zev, and your father's history with him as it relates to the item.  However, these matters can not be allowed to diminish the professional appearance of Marshal, Carter and Dark, LLP as an organization.  Because you are now the assigned broker for this Listing, making the changes official requires your authorization.  The updated Heading is attached to this message, please make use of it.  It's time you removed this monument to Mr. Zev's failure. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, LLP||\n**Attachments:** [[collapsible show =\"PREVIEW: Header1.doc\" hide =\"MINIMIZE: Header1.doc\"]]\n\n||||~ //G2T67/L9VXC/WI3M3//||\n||~ Status||//Unacquirable//||\n||~ Demand||//Medium//||\n||~ Value||//N/A//||\n||~ Availability||//Current inventory (0), Estimated worldwide (6)//||\n||~ Identifier||//Little Draft Horses//||\n||~ Description||//Items are a set of six bronze, horse-shaped statuettes.
