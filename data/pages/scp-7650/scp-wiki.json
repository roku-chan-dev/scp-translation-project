Archon SCPs may be a part of consensus reality that is difficult to fully contain or may have adverse effects if put into containment. These SCPs are not uncontainable—the defining feature of the class is that the Foundation chooses to not put the anomaly into containment. [[/footnote]], and thus need not be contained. It is to be closely monitored and tested, in a procedure known as **##red|PROJECT: π##**.\n----\n[[span class=\"st\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-7650 is an ideatic construct that resides within the human Noosphere[[footnote]] The collective human unconsciousness. [[/footnote]], conceptually encompassing all circle-sphere objects, whether they be a two-dimensional circle, a three-dimensional sphere, a fourth-dimensional hypersphere and any and all hyper-dimensional sphere-like objects.\n\nChanges to SCP-7650 are forbidden due to subsequent effects on baseline reality, such as affecting humanity's perception of circles and circular objects, such as wheels, coins, soccer balls, major celestial bodies, and other objects that can be described as 'circular' or 'sphere-like'. This can cause catastrophic damage to not only reality but also human sanity, as theorized by Dr. Scarlet Jones[[footnote]]The lead researcher on SCP-7650, who mainly works in the fields of metaphysics and ontology. Her theorems on SCP-7650 are detailed in the addendums.[[/footnote]], due to the perception of spheres theoretically being warped to the point of incomprehensibility, causing an **AK-CLASS END OF THE WORLD SCENARIO.**[[footnote]]End of the world via restructuring of subjective reality - that is, the perceptions and/or thought processes of the human race. Simply put: \"everyone goes crazy\", in one fashion or another.[[/footnote]]\n\nThe Noosphere, in which SCP-7650 exists is an ideatic construct, following Carl Jung's predictions of an archetypal world. The Noosphere is nestled in and eclipsed completely by an infinite sea of chaotic hyper-concepts[[footnote]]A significant one is that of a hierarchy of alephs dictated by their mathematical size. Under recent research, this hierarchy stretches to all possible uncountables prior the Inaccessible Cardinal.[[/footnote]], colloquially known as the [[[SCP-5800|Infosphere]]].\n\nThe Infosphere is home to many [[[SCP-3125|pests]]], all of which exist on a higher level of logic and comprehension. Its volatile and toxic ecological environment causes a direct and imminent threat to reality and the Noosphere, due to these pests' extremely hostile nature.\n\nIn the event that an Infospheric anomaly attempts to become conceptually integrated into our reality, a global amnestic must be administered, and necessary anti-memetic defense must be put in place to prevent it from accessing the greater Noosphere.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]ADDENDUM 7650.1:[[/span]] **##red|PROJECT: π##**\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\nI am Dr. Scarlet Jones, head researcher on SCP-7650. I have discovered a multitude of things about this entity that amazes and astounds even an experienced ontologist such as myself. I have done this via constructing a mini-Noospheric sub-space that I have exposed several D-Class personnel to, within which I have recreated a smaller, less potent mini-concept, asimilar to SCP-7650.[[footnote]] Now shall be denoted as SCP-7650-M.[[/footnote]] I have done this to tamper and play around with it, to see what it does. I believe my research will enhance our understanding of the greater Noosphere and its undiscovered and underlying machinations.\n\nThe process of **##red|PROJECT: π##** is detailed below:\n\n* D-Class' unconscious is to be exposed to the Noospheric sub-space, and affiliated closely with SCP-7650-M.\n\n* A metaphysical link is to be established using an anti-ontological bridge in which to interact and affect SCP-7650-M.\n\n* D-Class personnel are to be asked to draw a circle on a blank sheet of paper, the goal of which is to understand how to deal with and be cautious around concepts of this nature by testing the limits of the human mind when subjected to significantly altered versions of these concepts.\n\nCareful precautions must be taken to make sure that SCP-7650-M does not leak into the greater Noosphere, thus not affecting the main SCP-7650 concept. We do not know the damage that could be caused if such an event happened. Think about it; oval shaped wheels on cars? Pennies that only fit into a cash register when placed upon its side? The inconveniences would be atrocious. So, to avoid this, we need to be hesitant and calculating in how we deal with this concept. No unnecessary prodding, no overly extra experiments, etc.\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following details the events that have been studied in **##red|PROJECT: π##**.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ PROJECT π: TEST LOG 1\" hide=\"- Does the Black Moon howl?\"]]\n> Initial test, shall be a small one.
