  "content": "d[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n\nAll researchers working with [[[SCP-3636]]] should be aware of the current blacklist and take into consideration the lyrical content of any song they select. As SCP-3636 has shown the ability to select songs on its own, research is focused on gaining a better understanding of SCP-3636.\n\n**Test Log Format:**\nExperiments should be written in this form. \n> **Test #**\n> **Song Selected:**\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** \n> **Effects:** \n> **Notes:** \n\n------\n\n\n> **Test 13**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Have a Cigar\" by Pink Floyd\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-71829 suddenly grows shoulder length hair and a thick mustache, his clothing also changes to a loosely fitting t-shirt and blue denim jeans. A yet to be identified man in a grey suit appearing to be in his mid-sixties offers D-71829 a cigar and a bottle of champagne. D-71829 accepts them and the two begin having an unheard conversation for the duration of the song. During the final notes of the song, the man in the grey suit turns into a black Fender Stratocaster commonly used by David Gilmour in live performances. \n> **Effects:** D-71829 immediately began playing the guitar. D-71829 previously displayed no musical talent or interest. D-71829 now speaks exclusively in a British accent despite being of Chilean origin.\n> **Notes:** D-71829 has been held for further testing and is allowed usage of the guitar during daytime hours. D-71829 has repeatedly expressed concern that the Foundation will attempt to commercialize his music. \n\n> **Test 14**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Let Me Clear My Throat\" by DJ Kool\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-94812 experiences a seemingly painful coughing fit for the entirety of the song, only stopping to cheer when the song asks the listener to \"make some noise\". At roughly two minutes into the song, a paper cone \"party hat\" materializes on D-94812's head and party balloons materialize from the ceiling. \n> **Effects:** All attempts to remove the party hat from D-94812 have failed, including surgical methods. D-94812 claims to feel incredibly healthy\", and was confirmed to be in fine health after a standard checkup despite a previous checkup showing damage to several organs due to years of drug and alcohol abuse. D-94812 previously exhibited violent behavior and a rude and angry demeanor which has not been noted since the conclusion of the test. D-94812 began treating Foundation personnel with respect, and expressed a desire to \"compile the ultimate party playlist\" for future Foundation events.  \n> **Notes:** Approval to create playlist granted. D-94812's termination has been suspended for further testing on possible long term psychological and medical benefits of SCP-3636.  \n\n> **Test 15**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Regulate\" by Warren G ft. Nate Dogg\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A man appearing to be a young Warren G is seen being robbed by four African American men in modern day Long Beach, California. A man similar in appearance to Nate Dogg arrives and kills the four men. The two then find a group of women and enter a motel as the song ends.\n> **Effects:** Four corpses were discovered on an abandoned lot in Long Beach. All four men were previously convicted for gang-related crimes. Women in the video were identified and remembered the events in the video. Class-B Amnestics are administered to the women involved.\n> **Notes:** One woman who appeared in the video was confirmed to be pregnant, with DNA tests showing Nate Dogg as the father despite his death six years prior to the test. Warren G claimed no memory of the event after an interview.\n\n> **Test 16** \n> **Song Selected:** \"Deacon Blues\" by Steely Dan\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** During the lyric \"This is the day of the expanding man\" D-19223 is transported into an open field outside of Malibu, California. D-19223 expands to the size of a football field. The University of Alabama Crimson Tide and a seemingly fictional team referred to as the Malibu University Deacon Blues appear on top of D-19223 and begin to play a game of football. The Crimson Tide win the game 34-7 and all players for the Deacon Blues disappear.\n> **Effects:**  D-19223 died of multiple organ failure immediately after the song ended. University of Alabama team was found confused, searching for help 3 miles from D-19233's corpse.  \n> **Notes:**  Amnestics distributed to all members of the University of Alabama football team as well as nearby residents who witnessed the event. D-19223's body was destroyed and a story about a brush fire used as a cover.\n\n> **Test 17**\n> **Song Selected:** \"You Suffer\" by Napalm Death\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A close up of D-17891's face as they experience extreme pain immediately after selecting the song.\n> **Effects:** D-17891 confirmed that she felt extreme pain for the song's full 1.316 second duration that immediately subsided afterwards. \n> **Notes:** No long term anomalous effects apparent after a standard Foundation medical examination of D-17891.   \n\n> **Test 18**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Ladies Night\" by Kool and the Gang\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** SCP-3636 disappears from containment at the same time as 4 female researchers at Site 17. \n> **Effects:** SCP-3636 found with the missing researchers in a pink 1979 Chrysler Cordoba parked outside of a club in Jersey City, New Jersey. SCP-3636 was discovered in the driver's seat of the car wearing a long silver dress with mascara and lipstick applied to its touch screen. All 4 researchers were in similar attire and noticeably intoxicated. The researchers claimed to have \"partied all night\" with SCP-3636.\n> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites. Further research is suggested to see if SCP-3636 continues to treat itself as female in future tests.\n\n> **Test 19**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Pisces\" by Jinjer\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-1879 is turned into an adult Northern Pike in SCP-3636's containment cell, after briefly laying on the floor she appears in Ukraine's Dnieper river. She swims for the duration of the song before being caught by a fisherman who proceeds to cook and eat the fish during the final minute of the song.\n> **Effects:** No traces of D-1879 could be found. Fisherman depicted in video was eventually located and displayed no anomalous effects. \n> **Notes:** Researchers have suggested that SCP-3636 may have difficulties understanding complex metaphors. \n\n> **Test 20**\n> **Song Selected:** \"The Camera Eye\" by Rush\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-12281's eyes are transformed into camera lenses. D-12281's  veins and arteries temporarily become visible under her skin and are slowly replaced with what appear to be XLR cables. D-12281's fingers change in shape and coloration to appear similar to standard cardioid microphones. At roughly 3 minutes in the song, D-12281 appears in midtown Manhattan and begins to spy on citizens, apparently unseen. Later in the song, D-12281's location changes to a busy area of downtown London.   \n> **Effects:** D-11281 was eventually located in London and returned to Foundation custody. Amnestics distributed to affected neighborhood as a cautionary measure. \n> **Notes:** Surgical analysis of D-11281 is pending.\n\n> **Test 21**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Endless Forms Most Beautiful\" by Nightwish\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** No effects independently observed. Video starts with a microscopic shot of what seems to be a colony of primordial organisms before quickly zooming out, and presumably accelerating time, to reveal a seabed populated by numerous species of arthropod-analogues, similar to those associated with Earth's Cambrian Period. View then zooms to many areas of an undocumented Earth-like planet, occasionally accelerating time to showcase the evolution of life on the world. Video ends showing a tribe of hominid-analogues, focusing on one which repeatedly strikes two rocks together, seemingly to observe the resultant sparks.\n> **Effects:** No persistent effects can be observed at this time. However, the continued existence of the planet shown in the video or life on it cannot be ruled out. \n> **Notes:** \"This one isn't quite blacklisted, but further testing with it will require O5 approval.\" -Dr. Sutherland\n\n> **Test 22**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Song of Beren and Lúthien\", by Aragorn, son of Arathorn. \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The \"Live Music Video\" banner did not appear. Video depicted an individual resembling actor Viggo Mortensen singing acapella as a serenade to an unknown, non-human individual, apparently female. The first individual is noted to have grey eyes and a more athletic build than Mortenson, and the female has pointed ears and is very pale. At the end of the video, the pair share a kiss.\n> **Effects:** Following playback, search engines recorded a spike in searches for \"Beren and Lúthien\", and other terms related to //The Lord of the Rings// and J.R.R. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Beyond this, no effects have been observed.\n\n> **Test 23**\n> **Song Selected:** \"4'33\", by John Cage\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Screen displayed static for duration of the song.\n> **Effects:** All sound within test chamber was nullified.\n> **Notes:** So I guess it doesn't really qualify as instrumental? Maybe SCP-3636 \"imagined\" it being performed by a singer? -Dr. N█████\n\n> **Test 24**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Devoured by Vermin\", by Cannibal Corpse\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-27542 immediately disappeared from site, and reappeared on video in an undisclosed location. Various vermin is shown approaching him on ground, and various insects are shown approaching in the air. Subject appears to have the powers possesed by the current host of SCP-027. 33 seconds into the song, subject is completely covered by vermin, and is not seen for the rest of the video. More vermin continues to approach for the duration of the video.\n> **Effects:** Subject found in V████, Liechtenstein 4 hours after the SCP-3636-1 event. Subject found completely covered in vermin. Subject terminated. \n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist.\n\n> **Test 25**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Never Gonna Give You Up\" by Rick Astley\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-29234 vanishes, and is shown on video at the London underpass where a portion of the song's official video was filmed. He is dressed in Astley's outfit from that shoot- a tan longcoat over a black shirt and slacks. He sings the lyrics to a blonde woman standing next to him, while performing dance moves similar to Astley's. The woman responds positively to his affections, and at the end of the video, D-29234 sweeps her into his arms.\n> **Effects:** D-29234 is found at the same underpass with his head in his hands, weeping openly and muttering \"she looked just like her\". The woman depicted in the video is found several blocks away. When interviewed by personnel, she reports that D-29234 broke down inconsolably at the exact moment the song finished. The woman and all other witnesses to the SCP-3636-1 event are given Class-A amnestics.\n> **Notes:** D-29234 had a prior conviction for the murder of an ex-girlfriend, who was similar in appearance to the woman depicted in the SCP-3636-1 event. Based on its past behavior, it is believed that SCP-3636 was acting out of a terribly misguided sense of kindness.\n\n> **Test 26**\n> **Song Selected:** “Ode to a Superhero” by Weird Al Yankovic\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The video appeared in the form of a montage depicting re-enactments of various events from the 2002 film adaptation of Spider-Man, as described in the song. While all extras and background characters were portrayed by actual, contemporary residents of New York City, all principal characters which appeared in the montage were portrayed by exact duplicates of their respective actors as they appeared during the time period that the movie was filmed in.\n> **Effects:** Amnestics distributed to witnesses and non-anomalous participants. The Kirsten Dunst, James Franco, and Rosemary Harris duplicates (as well as the cadavers of the Cliff Robertson and Willem Dafoe duplicates) were located and taken into Foundation custody. Medical testing confirmed them to be genetically identical to the original actors, and interviews revealed that both individuals had memories corresponding to the character they portrayed (Mary Jane Watson and Harry Osborne, respectively) and believed themselves to be that character. A search for the individuals corresponding to the other principal characters is still ongoing, and it is not yet known if the duplicate of Tobey Maguire possesses the same anomalous abilities as his character.\n> **Notes:** An accidental second selection of this song caused the duplicates to revert to the same physical states and locations as in the beginning of the first music video, after which they re-enacted all the same events exactly identically. The specimens within Foundation custody show no memory of having gone through these same events twice.\n> //\"It's only been, what, a few days? I'm sure he'll turn up soon enough. A real live Spiderman would be hard to miss.\" --Researcher Lee//\n\n> **Test 27**\n> **Song Selected:** “Woodpecker No.1” by Merzbow\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-21512 vanishes. The video consists of an abandoned, dirty room with windows and a television which displays several flashing colors and bright, over saturated imagery. D-21512 is seen in some of the television footage. \n> **Effects:** The room in which the music video was located was found in [REDACTED], however D-21512 was never found. The television in the room was inspected, which revealed [DATA EXPUNGED]. \n\n> **Test 28**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Call Me Maybe\" by Carly Rae Jepsen\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Assistant Researcher Thompson is showed dressed in similar clothing that Carly Rae Jepsen wore in the music video. Agent Hendricks was also present, and was assisting Assistant Researcher Thompson who was observing him from behind fanning herself nervously. They converse and Assistant Researcher Thompson hands a folded piece of paper to Agent Hendricks before quickly leaving.\n> **Effects:** Interview with Assistant Researcher Thompson confirmed that she was attracted to Agent Hendricks, and wanted to be in communication with him but was anxious. Both have memories of the interaction, and Agent Hendricks had the folded paper in his pocket. On it was the personal phone number of Assistant Researcher Thompson.\n> **Notes:** A second viewing showed a pair of different individuals, and they were depicted in similar circumstances. Both of the individuals were identified and recalled their interaction, though they initially thought it was a dream. SCP-3636 has also added the song into its favorites.\n\n> **Test 29**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\" by Daft Punk\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The creation process of members from Mobile Task Force Tau-5 (\"Samsara\") is displayed.\n> **Effects:** The newly made clones had the most recent memories of Tau-5 and expressed confusion. It was reported that Tau-5 who was stationed at [REDACTED] collapsed and ceased all functions. Cause is currently unknown.\n\n> **Test 30**\n> **Song Selected:** “Flamingo” by Kero Kero Bonito\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-20357 disappeared for the duration of this test. The display showed her within the Site-17 cafeteria, sitting at a table. In front of her was a large bowl of raw shrimp, which she proceeded to eat in its entirety. Other personnel were present in the cafeteria at the time, but seemed to not notice D-20357. Over the course of the video, D-20357’s skin gradually becomes a bright pink hue. \n> **Effects:** D-20357’s skin remained the pink hue after the test ended. Analysis of her skin showed large amounts of carotenoids present. Despite this, D-20357 showed no negative effects from the large amount of shrimp consumed.\n\n> **Test 31**\n> **Song Selected:** “I’d Do Anything For Love (But I Won’t Do That)” by Meat Loaf with Patti Russo\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Staff Sergeant Julia “Jinxie” Penlan, assigned to base security and not previously aware of SCP-3636’s anomalous properties, disappears from SCP-3636’s containment room. On SCP-3636’s screen, SSgt Penlan reappears in a hallway at Site-██ standing next to a similarly relocated Doctor Gerald.\n> **Effects:** [DATA EXPUNGED]. Complete loss of Site-██ and all assigned personnel via massive containment breach of several Keter-class entities, requiring the last resort emergency detonation of Site-██’s nuclear warhead. Unusual in being one of the few SCP-3636-1 events to employ the interscene diegetic trope, where the events at Site-██ are interspersed with scenes of singers Meat Loaf and Patti Russo in a hitherto unreleased live studio recording session from 2013. \n> **Notes:** Staff Sergeant Penlan and Dr Gerald survived the mass containment breach and subsequent total loss of Site-██, having made their escape riding tandem on a motorcycle from the site’s motor pool and barely managing to clear the blast radius. Neither party was previously acquainted with the other, nor had they ever been assigned to or visited Site-██ prior to its destruction. Song has been recommended for blacklist.\n\n> **Test 32**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Super Mario Bros. Theme (Ground)\" by Koji Kondo\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The video showed 80% of personnel at [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/secure-facility-dossier-site-77 |Site-77]]] dancing to the rhythm of the song, and then personnel heading to the site cafeteria and consuming their supply of mushrooms.\n> **Effects:** Due to the lack of watch on several SCP items, there was a high-level breach at Site-77. All personnel below level 4 clearance were given amnestics.\n> **Notes:** Song added to SCP-3636's blacklist, along with Site Director Gillespie issuing punishment for the personnel who played this on SCP-3636.\n\n> **Test 33**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Act 1 Scene 1 - Regression\" by Dream Theater \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** After the introduction of the song, D-21928 vanishes and is shown in the music video lying in a therapy office, where he begins vocalizing the words in the song. After the song ends, the rest of the album begins playing with no way of stopping it. The video continues to portray the entire album in its original sequence.\n> **Effects:** Just before the album finishes, D-21928 is killed by the same therapist from the beginning as he says \"Open your eyes, Nicholas\". SCP-3636's screen only shows static after the final song ends. D-21928 does not return, and the whereabouts of the location of his teleportation is unknown.\n> **Notes:** Lyrical and story research on the full album that this song originated lines up with the scenes shown in the music video with D-21928. Any attempt to start the album from one of the tracks in the middle forces the first song to play.\n\n> **Test 34**\n> **Song Selected:** \"PokéRap\" by 4Kids Entertainment\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Music video follows an identical format to the PokéRap's actual music video, however, all named Pokemon are replaced with SCP objects roughly equivalent to the creature in question. For example, #006 (\"Charizard\") shows SCP-1762, #052 (\"Meowth\") shows SCP-529, #97 (\"Hypno\") shows SCP-4666, #130 (\"Gyarados\") shows SCP-169 and #149 (\"Dragonite\") shows SCP-682. In the chorus, various staff members from Site-17 are shown attempting to \"catch\" (contain) the objects in question.\n> **Effects:** A massive containment breach occurred as the music video was playing. Full containment re-established after 42 hours. \n> **Notes:** Song added to SCP-3636's blacklist.\n\n> **Test 35**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Prayer of the Refugee\" by Rise Against\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-38452 disappears and is shown in an unidentified superstore. D-38452 begins pacing down aisles, lip-syncing to the song, consistent to the original music video, while multiple customers and staff of Hispanic and Arabic descent are shown assuming a prayer position respective to their religions for the duration of the event.\n> **Effects:** D-38452 was later discovered at a local Wal-Mart in ███████, ██ and was returned to Foundation custody. All customers and staff present during the event were questioned, amnestized, and released. All video surveillance footage of the event were taken by Foundation personnel and wiped from the store's records.\n> **Notes:** During questioning, the individuals shown praying during the event were identified as legal immigrants who moved to America in search of employment.\n\n> **Test 36**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Veteran of the Psychic Wars\" by Blue Oyster Cult\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** An unidentified woman wearing a Foundation ID is shown standing in an elevator. The ID is smeared with blood and the name cannot be read. She is below average height and appears to be roughly 50 years in age. She is carrying what appears to be an energy weapon of unknown make or origin. The elevator opens to an empty, featureless corridor with what appears to be an airlock at the end of the corridor. At 2 minutes and 12 seconds into the song the woman enters the airlock. D-39338 and all observing researchers are unable to recount the events of the remaining 2 minutes and 38 seconds of the song.\n> **Effects:** D-72338 and the observing researchers all show signs of having been affected by an unknown cognitohazard.\n> **Notes:** No record of a woman matching the description of the woman observed in the first 2 minutes 12 seconds of the video could be found in Foundation personnel records. The elevator contained signage indicating that it was within Foundation Site 41, but no record of any such site could be found.\n\n> **Test 37**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Promise\" by Kohmi Hirose\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-72339 is shown re-enacting the events of the music video until the chorus at which point D-72339 is shown rapidly spinning. The spinning continues throughout the chorus, pausing briefly in the 3rd and 7th lines of the chorus where D-72339 sways their hips. After the chorus D-72339 resumes re enactment of the music video.\n> **Effects** After the music stops D-72339 collapses and is taken to the infirmary where X-ray scans show breaks in most joints of D-72339.\n\n> **Test 38**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)\" by Journey\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-45383 is shown on a planet █████ in an 80's rock themed space suit, crying out for who can be assumed to be a previous lover.  As the video continues, D-45383 is shown to progressively age and show more and more signs of depression and by the outro is now old, nearing 90 years old and has given up on singing and has just simply been crying.  With the last two words being \"No, no!\" the now old man is shown screaming and crying into the sky.\n> **Effects:** D-45383 is yet to be recovered nor was the disappearance shown on the cameras, as the cameras in his cell disconnected for 7 seconds.\n> **Notes:** The cameras disconnecting had no long term effects on their performance.\n\n> **Test 39**\n> **Song Selected:** \"The Entertainment's Here\" by AJR\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-62884 disappears from the testing chamber and is shown in a bedroom. They are seen lying on the bed with their eyes closed, lip-syncing the lyrics of the song, with the viewer's perspective positioned approximately one foot above their face. A digital alarm clock on a nightstand next to the bed goes off, presumably playing the song. D-62884 leaves the bed and exits the bedroom, and is suddenly in an outdoor area, lying on the ground. When the chorus of the song hits, D-62884 jumps into a standing position and a crowd of people suddenly appear, some holding instruments and pretending to play them, mimicking the song, while others lip-sync the lyrics. At the next portion of the song, D-62884 is shown in a diner eating a cheeseburger and drinking a milkshake. D-62884 leaves the items on the counter and exits the diner, reappearing in Las Vegas, Nevada. D-62884 is holding an empty wallet, which they toss behind them. Moments later, D-62884's head bursts, and their headless corpse falls to the ground, staying there for the rest of the video. When the chorus starts for the second and final time, the same crowd from before, with a few additional members, reappear from outside of the now stationary viewpoint, performing the same actions as before. Balloons and confetti appear from above and fall upon the crowd slowly. When the video ends, all members of the crowd, except those from Las Vegas, leave the viewpoint and disappear.\n> **Effects:** D-62884 and the remaining members of the crowd were found in Las Vegas, Nevada. D-62884 was still deceased. The remaining crowd members and all other known witnesses were given amnestics, and the blood, corpse, confetti, and balloons were cleaned up.\n> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites.\n\n> **Test 40**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Two-Headed Boy\" by Neutral Milk Hotel\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-59394 appeared to instantaneously age backwards to a pre-adolescent state, followed by the growth of a second head extending from his neck. D-59394 is shown dancing in a field of white roses with a young girl matching the appearance of Annelies Frank. Neutral Milk Hotel singer Jeff Mangum appears in several scenes throughout the video, playing guitar and singing beside D-59394 and the girl.\n> **Effects:** D-59394 passed several vision, hearing, and psychological tests, despite possessing extraneous sensory organs. Personality now matches that of an average pre-adolescent, and scans seem to indicate that the subject's two brains function identically with no complications. Subject placed in containment for further study. The girl shown in the video has not been located.\n> **Notes:** Jeff Mangum was found in the containment cell of SCP-3636, clutching his guitar and sobbing quietly. Following a week-long period of testing for anomalies, subject was amnesticized and released.\n\n> **Test 41**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Whip A Tesla\" by Yung Gravy & bbno$\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-68319 disappeared after the 3 second mark in the song. D-68319 immediately reappeared inside of a Tesla Model X, along with the 2 creators of the song. Many female D-class were observed getting out of the car.\n> **Effects:** D-68319 began to call himself \"Piper Johnny\" and continues to call himself by the name. The 2 musicians had no memory of the event. D-68319 passed all physical and psychological tests.\n> **Notes:** Further requests for the song result in SCP-3636 stating \"Piper Johnny ain't pipin' no more.\"\n\n> **Test 42**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Blinding Lights\" by The Weeknd\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** D-78912 was obscured by a sudden burst of bright light. At the end of the song, SCP-3636's cell was unchanged, while D-78912 had collapsed on the floor, suffering from full thickness burns over their entire body.\n> **Effects:** D-78912 expired shortly after the event. \n> **Notes:** Blacklist consideration pending.\n\n> **Test 43**\n> **Song Selected:** \"The Jukebox Song\" by Researcher ███████[[footnote]]A song written by Researcher ███████ in order to gain insight on the nature of SCP-3636. The song describes a sentient jukebox, referred to with female pronouns.[[/footnote]]\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Video consisted of SCP-3636 being created on an assembly line with similar objects in an unidentified factory, being shipped to a bar, burning the bar down, and being recovered by the SCP Foundation. Video ended with Researcher ███████ singing \"The Jukebox Song\" in front of SCP-3636.\n> **Effects:** The bar in which SCP-3636 was originally discovered was observed to repair itself before again burning down. Class-A amnestics were administered to all witnesses.\n> **Notes:** Usage of an \"interview song\" to further understand the nature and history of SCP-3636 is under consideration. SCP-3636 added song to favorites.\n\n> **Test 44**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Death of a Lizard\", by Doctor N████[[footnote]]A song beginning with a description of SCP-682 perishing quietly from no specifically identified cause, followed by several verses explaining that it's death was permanent and mankind continued to live peacefully afterwards.[[/footnote]]\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  Screen displayed a live feed of SCP-682's containment chamber. SCP-682 begins growing weak, before collapsing on the floor. The rest of the video consists of shots of various civilians from across the globe going about their lives uneventfully.\n> **Effects:**  SCP-682 displayed no life signs for the duration of the song. At the conclusion of the event, SCP-682 reanimated and resumed it's normal activities.\n> **Notes:** //[EXPLETIVE], we were so close!// -Dr. N████\n\n> **Test 45**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Reaganomics\" by Lemon Demon\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Researcher ████████, one of the researchers in charge of monitoring [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1981 SCP-1981], is shown putting a Betamax tape, presumably SCP-1981, into a Betamax player. Introductory text is altered to say \"RONALD REAGAN CUT UP WHILE SINGING.\"  Tape plays former U.S. president Ronald Reagan lip-syncing to the song, dancing with other persons present in the original recording including what appears to be SCP-1981-1. Reagan is shown to lip-sync while doing a variety of different activities in various locations, including driving a 1985-model DeLorean away from a nuclear explosion, dancing in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and satirically recreating scenes in films he had previously starred in. Throughout video, Reagan is still shown to be \"cut up\" as with previously conventional recordings of SCP-1981, albeit at an accelerated rate. Upon reaching the final chorus of the song, Reagan takes out a revolver and shoots SCP-1981-1 once the singing in the song reaches a high note. SCP-1981-1 is then shown dying in a manner similar to the main character of the 1964 film //The Killers,// which is notable as being Reagan's last acting role before going into politics. Tape ends on a still of a campaign button for Ronald Reagan's 1980 run for presidency. Video ends with Betamax tape being ejected from player, and Researcher ████████ reacting with a \"shocked\" expression.\n> **Effects:** Researcher ████████ contacted Foundation higher-ups and other researchers assigned to SCP-1981, confirming SCP-3636 had effected the actual SCP-1981. Future plays of SCP-1981 were seemingly effected. While subject matter of SCP-1981's speeches remained consistent with previous recordings, speeches were more thematically coherent.\n> **Notes:** SCP-3636 added song to favorites.\n\n> **Test 46**\n> **Song Selected:** //Ice Cream Man// by Van Halen\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The screen depicted an ice cream truck driving through the streets of Los Angeles.  Said truck was decorated in the distinctive pattern of Van Halen guitarist Eddie Van Halen's signature \"Frankenstein\" guitar and had a large plastic ice cream cone[[footnote]]described as \"oddly phallic\" by personnel[[/footnote]] mounted atop it.  At 1:12, the truck stopped beside a large crowd of scantily clad women and an entity resembling Van Halen vocalist David Lee Roth (as he appeared circa 1978) emerged from the window to offer them ice cream, apparently for free.  Ice cream products included the banana pops, Dixie cups, and push-ups mentioned in the song's lyrics, as well as at least forty distinct flavors of ice cream.  Footage of the Roth entity distributing ice cream was interspersed with video of the women consuming it.  At 1:44, the door at the rear of the ice cream truck opened to reveal Eddie Van Halen (circa 1978) performing the guitar solo.  At 3:00, the truck pulled away from the crowd and drove into the sunset as the video faded to black.\n> **Effects:** Events occurred exactly as depicted and were captured on video by several bystanders.  Affected women did not recall any anomalous influence, but unanimously agreed that the ice cream was delicious.  David Lee Roth did not report any unusual activity.  The truck and unknown entities have not been located.\n> **Notes:** To prevent suspicion of the video evidence or potential future sightings, a cover story was disseminated claiming that the event was a publicity stunt by a Van Halen tribute band.\n\n> **Test 47**\n> **Song Selected:** \"Hung Up\" by Madonna\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  The video displays Madonna lounging on her bed as she frequently calls Dr. Clef, apparently leaving voicemails as she calls him. She occasionally stands on her bed to perform a dance.\n> **Effects:** Dr. Clef reported over 200 voicemails from Madonna, most around 20 seconds in length in which Madonna flirts with him very directly.\n> **Notes:** That's not even my favorite Madonna song. - Dr. Clef\n\n> **Test 48** \n> **Song Selected:** \"Ryncaria's Night\" by Datura Lacroye \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:**  A street in Buffalo, NY is shown late at night with only neon signs lighting it up as two young adults walk down the street while laughing and conversing. The then enter a nearby apartment where they can be seen as silhouettes through a blinded window. \n> **Effects:** The test, conducted in the early afternoon, caused an area of six block to lose sunlight. Various buildings that previously had no neon signs were suddenly found to possess them. Created materials were acquired and amnestics were distributed. \n> **Notes:** Song added to favorites by SCP-3636.\n\n> **Test 49**\n> **Song Selected:** //And When He Falleth// by Theater of Tragedy\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** A wide imagery becomes visible on the screen depicting Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro. The statue of Christ the Redeemer is located on top of the mountain. The sky is clouded.\n> **Effects:** A few seconds following the video's initiation, a bright light breaks through the clouds, hereafter a humanoid figure is seen falling down from the sky. It is accompanied by two angels, both of whom feature disheveled wings. Christ the Redeemer cries blood. During this event, a man clothed in a medieval garb enters the containment chamber, despite there being two guards stationed outside to report any unusual occurrences. Following the man's arrival, the dialogue part of the song begins, with both parties performing the scene. The stranger leaves after having finished his final line. No inconsistencies reported by guards.\n> **Notes:** The subject developed a strong Christian belief after this experiment, claiming that there must be a god, no matter what the stranger told him. The being that fell from the sky has, as of yet, not been located. Additionally, severe acts of blasphemy were reported from all around the world, ending with the event's conclusion.\n\n> **Test 50**\n> **Song Selected:** //Eternal// by Evanescence\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The screen depicts a park covered in white flowers. A woman dressed in a wedding dress is seen running through the park, while holding the left hand of a man clothed in a fancy suit. Then, several short clips become visible, showing the happy life of the pair. Following the conclusion of the first part, and subsequent initiation of the second, a more dark scene is depicted.[[footnote]] Additionally, rain falls have started to occur in the area around Site-17. [[/footnote]] The man from the first part enters what appears to be a bedroom, though, the woman sitting on the bed is foreign. The scene fades out as the man approaches the woman, whereafter a new one starts with the aforementioned man holding prison bars. The woman from the first clip looks at him in frustration, while holding a file with the man's charges. Intoxication of self & cheating. The second part terminates, whereupon the third is showing the now lonely woman wearing a gothic dress. Thunder becomes more intensive, until sounds of knocking emanate from the window. As the woman opens the window, a white dove of peace drops a letter inside the room, before flying away. After having closed the window, the woman picks up letter, opening it. It reads:\n>> = //Bars and crimes speared my heart//\n>> = //Though my means are not of tart//\n>> = //for with clocks come wisdom//\n>> = //and wisdom makes contrition//\n>> = //Forget our past and move along//\n>> = //take me off my long//\n>> = //and forgive me//\n> Afterwards, a frame depicting both protagonists embracing each other is shown, which remains for a few minutes, before vanishing with the song's conclusion.\n> **Effects:** Since the experiment, D-2728 has shown great remorse for all his crimes, as well as a strong will to \"do whatever he can to come back and make his amends\".\n> **Notes:** It appears that SCP-3636 fictionalized an interpretation of the song, though this would entail that the object possess a kind of consciousness.\n\n> **Test 51**\n> **Song Selected:** //Cotard's Solution (Anatta, Dukkha, Anicca)// by Will Wood & The Tapeworms\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** The screen shows a montage of D-17582, laying in his cell while tearing apart his skin to reveal more layers of himself, with different tattoos, skin color, and other features. When the song ends, all the layers of flesh torn from D-17582 layer back onto his body, laying in bed while curled up in a fetal position.\n> **Effects:** D-17582 suffers from Cotard's delusion, and claims having a sense of dread while the test was occurring, although camera footage shows him in his cell with no anomalous effects.\n> **Notes:** While D-17582 was not a member of the test, it seems that SCP-3636 knew about his condition. Further tests are to note.\n\n> **Test 52**\n> **Song Selected:** //Moonlight on Vermont// by Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event**: The screen displayed low quality, grainy footage of a moon, tinted a blood red color. It pans down to a small town, people initiating with violent acts towards each other, including [REDACTED].\n> **Effects:** 25 people in the town of ██████ was killed by unknown means, bodies showing signs of blunt force trauma and damaged hands/teeth. Witnesses claim the moon turned a blood red during the event.\n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist. Witnesses amnestisized and footage was destroyed. \n> //This song sucks.// - Dr. Blue\n\n> **Test 53**\n> **Song Selected:** //Smells Like Teen Spirit// by Nirvana\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Screen displayed the teenage years of Dr. ████, eventually showing him at a house party with other people. It ends with Dr. ████ collapsing on the floor drunk.\n> **Effects:** Dr. ████ was heavily intoxicated during the duration of the test, but was able to make a full recovery.\n> **Notes:** Sorry, just wanted to test something else.\n\n> **Test 54**\n> **Song Selected:** //Smells Like Nirvana// by \"Weird Al\" Yankovic\n> **SCP-3636-1 event:** Identical as before with minor alterations. Dr. ████ was replaced by Yankovic, and the house party had many unusual details. Including the band from Nirvana playing different instruments, a cow on set, and other details.\n> **Effect:** Cameras on Yankovic shown that he was intoxicated during the test, Dr. ████ experienced feelings of paranoia.\n> **Notes:** Sorry, ████.\n\n> **Test #55**\n> \n> **Song Selected:** Sesame Street Theme Song (Raposo, Stone, and Hart — Season 1 arrangement)\n> \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Opening footage from the show's 1969-70 run appeared to play over the song as requested. On closer inspection, however, several of the children on film resembled friends from the subject's kindergarten years. (Junior Researcher ████ notes that she herself was born in 1966, so no anachronistic clothing or other technology could have shown.)\n> \n> **Effects:** For the duration of the song, Junior Researcher ████ regressed physically to age four, and wore typical play clothes for a girl of the early 1970s. She was also teleported to Reeves Teletape Studio in New York, where a taping of Episode ██ (airdate: ██/██/1970) was in progress. Thankfully, ████'s reversion to her natural age occurred off camera. However, a Foundation employee working undercover at Teletape had to distribute Class B amnestics to several personnel and actors on site.\n> \n> **Notes:** Thank heaven the writers referred to \"a street where anything can happen\" on day one; if those amnestics were a bad batch, the children will probably dismiss it as typical kidvid weirdness.\n\n> **Test #56**\n>\n> **Song Selected:** \"The Dumb Song\" by AJR\n>\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** SCP-3636 displayed the lyrics of the song, until the lyrics \"You should not have done that!\" when an extreme barrage of colors, shapes, and other seizure-causing elements to appear on screen. D-18382 fainted promptly.\n>\n> **Effects:** Upon waking up, an IQ test was administered to D-18382. It revealed their IQ had dropped by 15 points.\n>\n> **Notes:** Song added to favorites by SCP-3636.\n\n> **Test #57**\n> \n> **Song Selected:** \"Somewhere Only We Know\" by Keane\n> \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4666 An elderly, disheveled man] was observed leading a group of children into the woods, where they entered a dimly lit cave which seemed to lead underground. Inside, additional children were seen collaborating to create toys fashioned from the body parts of other children. During this unsettling scene, one of the children collapsed, and the elderly man was seen dragging her further into the darkness.\n> \n> **Effects:** On 02/01/2018, SCP-4666-A-0960 was discovered at a family's residence in Hoonah, Alaska, which consisted of a crude, life-sized doll made from the emaciated body of a female child.\n> \n> **Notes:** Song added to favorites by SCP-3636. \n> The footage was submitted to the Site Director for approval of location tracing and potentially rescuing additional victims.\n> //I --might-- need therapy.// - Dr. Avenlee\n\n> **Test #58**\n> \n> **Song Selected:** \"Lily\" by Alan Walker\n> \n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** Subject D-33465 escaped containment and entered the nearby woods, where she encountered an unidentified entity. Whom she reported, had her hypnotized and pursued her throughout the duration of the song as she attempted to flee, repeatedly singing the lines:\n> \n> //\"Follow everywhere I go,//\n> \n> //Top of all the mountains or valley low,//\n> \n> //Give you everything you've been dreamin' of,//\n> \n> //Just let me in, ooh\"//\n> \n> **Effects:** D-33465, identified as Lily Lenson, was recaptured near Site-██ while attempting to escape the aforementioned entity. She had no recollection of the entity's appearance and was subsequently administered Class-A amnestics.\n> \n> **Notes:** Everytime the song is played, a similar phenomenon occurs involving various individuals, all coincidentally bearing the first name or nickname \"Lily.\"\n\n> **Test #59**\n>\n> **Song Selected: The Ballroom Blitz by Sweet**\n>\n> **SCP-3636-1 Event:** In the Site-17 conference hall members of Mobile Task Force Units Epsilon-11 and Beta-7 are attending a joint presentation hosted by Research Director Alison Page. There appears to be some tension between the units. This tension grows until a member of Epsilon-11 identified as Private Seamus Carter is heard yelling “everyone attack” and both units begin fighting each other. As the brawl happens Private Carter and Research Director Page can be seen having a conversation seemingly lip syncing parts of the song's lyrics. \n>\n> **Effects:** Despite the brawl ending when the song concluded members of both units expressed disdain for each other. Members of the units were unable to recall any reasoning for this disdain or why there was tension between the units in the first place. This effect lasted a few days before disappearing. Research Director Page and Private Carter were unable to recall any parts of their conversation that were not exact lyrics to the song.\n>\n> **Notes:** Song added to blacklist. Not only do we not want conflict between Foundation MTF units but that brawl also did significant damage to Site-17s only conference hall despite the individuals involved only using fists and chairs as weapons.\n\n----",
