Observation of SCP-6921 is to be done remotely to prevent external interface during behavioral study. \n\nTo further study its behavior, small mammals are to be released within its cell on a bi-weekly basis.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-6921 refers to a 4m tall spherical automaton composed of common metal alloys and complex circuitry. SCP-6921 is suspended by 35 mechanical appendages resembling elongated human arms. These limbs are incredibly dexterous; housing an abundant amount of joints to help it traverse environments and track prey. They have been documented extending far beyond what their design would suggest. Directly on top of 6921’s sphere lies an inoperable hatch, as well as a retractable input chamber directly beneath. X-ray analysis of SCP-6921’s interior has revealed the deceased remains of Jesse B. Court.\n\nWhenever SCP-6921 locates organic matter [[footnote]] It has been documented preferring live, able-bodied organisms. [[/footnote]], it will begin navigating towards it. Upon arrival, it will use its appendages to forcefully tear the matter into small segments, where \nthe remains will be inserted into a retractable lower compartment. Periodically, SCP-6921 will expel matter out of this compartment due to the excess of matter gathered.\n\nSCP-6921 will remain dormant when not in the presence of suitable organic material.\n\n**Addendum:** 16 video recordings were successfully recovered from Jesse’s personal computer.

Even with all of this, I've found myself in a pretty shitty living situation. Been workin’ under the table for a dead-end newspaper company, which on top of disability checks is just barely getting me by.
