The break room is to be shut down indefinitely and restricted solely for testing. Testing is currently focused on gaining access to SCP-1322-J-1. Should a site containment breach of a dangerous anomaly or anomalies occur, extra guards will be assigned to prevent access to SCP-1322-J-1.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1322-J is a space-time anomaly two metres in height and one metre across located in Site-27's break room leading to a parallel universe designated as SCP-1322-J-1. SCP-1322-J appears to lead to an alternate Foundation's Site-27 break room.\n\nSCP-1322-J-1 appears to be identical to baseline reality, except for its chiral nature. Due to this effect, it is currently impossible for personnel to enter SCP-1322-J-1, as their chiral counterparts will block them from entering. Attempts to collaborate with SCP-1322-J-1 instances will prove fruitless from what appears to be a result of its anomalous chiral nature, and meaningful communication will prove impossible.\n\nSCP-1322-J was discovered by Researcher Cameron Barnes, who proceeded to immediately alert security to the presence of an unknown anomaly. Currently, Barnes is in charge of containment.\n\n**__Test 1__**\n**Success:** N\n**Action Taken:** Researcher Barnes attempted to enter SCP-1322-J.\n**Result:** Researcher Barnes collides with SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Barnes attempts to enter the anomaly for 23 minutes, but is blocked by SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes. Testing ends after SCP-1322-J-1-Barnes becomes aggressive.\n\n**__Test 2__**\n**Success:** N\n**Action Taken:** MTF Eta-15 (\"Chess Players\") is ordered to enter SCP-1322-J by any means necessary. \n**Result:** MTF Eta-15 immediately entered hand to hand combat with their counterparts. As expected, neither version of MTF Eta-15 made any progress. Testing was abandoned after MTF Eta-15 deployed grenades, resulting in three members requiring hospitalization.\n\n**__Test 3__**\n**Success:** N\n**Action Taken:** A drone is deployed towards SCP-1322-J.\n**Result:** The drone is blocked by the alternate drone. \n\n**__Test 4__**\n**Success:** N\n**Action Taken:** A drone (D-1) is taped on top of another drone (D-2) and sent towards SCP-1322-J at 60 km/h, in the hopes that the impact will throw D-1 into SCP-1322-J-1.\n**Result:** D-1 is dislodged by D-2's impact and thrown towards SCP-1322-J-1, but is blocked by its counterpart that experienced a matching flight pattern.\n\n**__Test 5__**\n**Success:** Y\n**Action Taken:** D-23432 is ordered to enter the portal on pain of immediate termination.\n**Result:** D-23432 appeared confused about SCP-1322-J, insisting it was not anomalous. D-23432 refused to enter SCP-1322-J.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Updated SCP Designation\" hide=\"- \"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-1322-J\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-1322-J is to be removed from the break room and put in secure storage.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1322-J is an indestructible mirror. In approximately 92.9832123% of humans, subjects are convinced that it is a portal to a highly interesting alternate universe.\n\n//I'd like to offer my immediate resignation. -Researcher Barnes//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
