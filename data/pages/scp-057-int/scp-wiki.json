Knew it from the top of my hat to the tip of my tail. Knew it in my bones, in the cracks in the paint on the Site walls, in my own reflection at the bottom of the bowl. After doing this for so long, you just develop a sense. And when I slinked through the underground passages of Facility-57 that day, my senses were telling me all hell was about to break loose. \n\nNobody else seemed to think anything was wrong. No, they were going about their day, checking clipboards, attending meetings, performing experiments. I tried to get Everwood's attention, but they only chuckled and straightened my hat. Dowell wasn't much better. So I went straight to the top -- and lo and behold, Director Venceslao is nowhere to be found. \"In a meeting,\" his secretary claims halfheartedly. A likely story.\n\nThey're mice, you see -- mice love to stick to their routine. Wake up at twilight, spend the night scurrying around in the walls, eating, defecating, and then return to their holes to sleep the day away.

A perimeter has been established around both sides of the border with multiple checkpoints under the guise of geological research. Any individuals caught attempting to access SCP-057-INT are to be captured, interrogated, amnesticized, and released.\n\n**Description:** SCP-057-INT refers to the sudden manifestation of a mega-structure largely located beneath the Andes Mountains between the border of Chile and Argentina. SCP-057-INT contains multiple entities claiming membership in the Foundation. \n\nFurther investigation is pending.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-057-INT was initially discovered by Foundation geological outposts on Easter Island, which reported a sudden shift in seismic activity in the area of the Andes alongside multiple earthquakes in the surrounding area. Due to the lack of any previous activity in the Nazca and South American tectonic plates, the earthquakes were deemed an anomaly, and Foundation field agents were sent to investigate.\n\nAgent Carlos Gutierrez was the first to discover signs of SCP-057-INT. The following is a log of his interaction with an SCP-057-INT entity recorded on his standard field agent recording box.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**Gutierrez:** This is A-1221 to homebase.

But what the hell is a crab doing here? We're so far from the beach... Hello, little guy. How did you get up here?\n\n**???:** //Holis, ¿como andas, amigo?//\n\n//[There is a five-second silence.]//\n\n**Gutierrez:** Command, the crab just spoke to me in Spanish. \n\n**Command:** Engage it in conversation. We are sending a containment team to your location.\n\n//[In Spanish]// **Gutierrez:** <Hey, buddy. How are you?>\n\n**Crab:** <I can't really complain. I got assigned a top-secret mission by Director Venceslao! So I need to be on the up and up!>\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Oh yeah? And what is this mission?>\n\n**Crab:** <I can't say!>\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Oh, surely you can tell me. I'm your friend, remember?>\n\n**Crab:** <Really? So you'll let me eat your dead skin?>\n\n**Gutierrez:** <I, uh, well... Sure?> \n\n**Crab:** <Yipee! Agent Blue Crab, away!>\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Whoa, you're fast. Hey, watch it there!

Sorry for jumping up to your head but the best dead skin is always on the scalp, you know?> \n\n//[There is a twenty-five-second silence.]//\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Hey now, that's enough picking at my scalp. Why don't you tell me about this mission of yours?>\n\n**Crab:** <Well... Promise you won't tell anyone?>\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Yes, I promise. Now go on then, get off my head and tell me.>\n\n//[The sound of skittering is audible as the crab presumably jumps off of Guiterrez' head.]//\n\n**Crab:** <Okay! So you see, the people who take care of me, the SCP something or other, they wanted me to go out and investigate the area around them because they said there was some sort of... uh... something failure event? I don't really know much about that stuff. But look at what I can do! Pow! Pow!>\n\n//[Gutierrez would later describe the crab as striking poses while puffs of gas emitted from its claws.]//\n\n**Crab:** <Pretty cool, huh?>\n\n**Command:** Please attempt to gain more information about what it means by 'SCP'.\n\n**Gutierrez:** <Indeed. So tell me, Agent Blue Crab, what is this 'SCP something or other'? What are they like?>\n\n**Crab:** <You can call me Crabby, Agent Blue Crab is just my secret agent name. And they're typically really nice to me. I have my very own room, complete with friends like Doctor Helmit, Juan, Pedro, Gastón and Pepito! They also don't ever call me by my name, they call me... uh... what was it... [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-264 SCP-ES-264]? At least Doctor Helmit doesn't, and none of the other doctors. I think it's very rude of them to not call me by my name, but they're very stuffy about rules.

Grab it now, do not let it get away!\n\n**Crab:** <Hey, why are you looking at me like that? You're giving me the heebie-jeebies.>\n\n//[The sound of Gutierrez diving for the Crab is audible.]//\n\n**Crab:** <Aaaah! I thought we were friends!>\n\n**Command:** Do you have the object in your possession, Agent?\n\n**Gutierrez:** Trying!\n\n**Crab:** <I'm not inviting you to my tea party anymore!>\n\n**Gutierrez:** Get over here you little--\n\n//[Gutierrez dives for the Crab again.]//\n\n**Gutierrez:** Gotcha!\n\n**Crab:** <Aaaah! Help!>\n\n**Gutierrez:** Command, I got it. How much longer until the unit arrives?\n\n**Crab:** <You leave me no option! Take this, villain! Pium, pium!>\n\n//[Gutierrez later described the Crab as releasing a gas from its claws directly onto his face, causing him to become paralyzed and release the Crab.]//\n\n**Crab:** <Aaaaah!

Heeeelp!> \n\n= **<END LOG>**\n\n//Note: Gutierrez recovered from the full body paralysis within an hour of being located by the recovery team.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAgent Gutierrez reported his findings to his superiors, who set up a tentative cordon in the immediate encounter zone and monitored for further activity. Due to the nature of the potential threat, the O5 Council called an emergency department heads meeting at Site-01 for the following day, allowing time for urgent research. The following conclusions were reached:\n* The Department of Containment reported that its agents are instructed to first attempt communication in English with individuals within the Veil of Secrecy, and no agent of theirs would have instigated a conversation with Agent Gutierrez in Spanish. They also noted that \"Hello, how are you, friend?\" is in no way an acceptable greeting while following established protocol. They further noted that they do not employ talking crabs. The DoC outlined over one dozen possible containment strategies, none of which carried any significant chance of success without the acquisition of more detailed information on the status of the anomaly;\n* The Temporal Anomalies Department reported that all signatories of the //Multi-Foundation Pact of 1981// had been consulted on incidences of their Sites going dark. While over four hundred such losses were reported, none involved complete disappearance or talking crabs. The Spider Crab Protection Foundation offered to send a diplomatic envoy. The TAD recommended against this action, as the use of spider crabs in baseline reality Japanese cuisine has been kept from the Spider Crab Foundation. The TAD concluded that if SCP-057-INT represents an outpost of an alternate multiversal Foundation, said Foundation must either be unknown to the coalition, have been rejected for membership, or have rejected membership themselves. Extreme caution is thereby indicated;\n* The Emergent Threat Tactical Response Authority reported that while they do possess an emergency containment plan for the discovery of a hostile power underground in the Andes Mountains, as this plan consists of collapsing the Andes Mountains, they recommended diplomatic efforts be first attempted;\n* The GoI Research Group reported that their Director, Dr. Jay Everwood, is a fluent speaker of Spanish and would be willing to engage in diplomacy with SCP-057-INT should this be the will of the Council.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=helicopter.jpg|\n    caption=MTF π-3 (\"Garcas Oligarcas\").|\n     align=right|\n     width=300px\n]]\n\n\nThe Council agreed to attempt renewed contact with SCP-057-INT before implementing more drastic containment measures. A small RES/CON team, escorted by MTF π-3 (\"Garcas Oligarcas\"), approached the outer border to SCP-057-INT by helicopter.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n**π-1:** Command, we've touched down about point-seven-five klicks outside of the exclusion zone.

Hey, doesn't that person missing the arm look a little like--\n\n//[As they approach, a handful of figures step to the front of the crowd: one man in a well-tailored suit, and two people in labcoats -- one of them conspicuously missing an arm. The rest of the guards hold their rifles defensively. The man in the suit speaks.]//\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Unknown:**[[/span]] //[In Spanish]// I don't know who you are, but this is a top-secret military install-- Everwood?\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Everwood:**[[/span]] Me?

They're great at scooping litterboxes, carrying bags of food. But when you want something investigated? Well, you don't call a plumber to launch a rocket, do you? I kept a close eye on these strangers as Venceslao invited them in. Two Everwoods is interesting. Might just mean that whatever world we've landed in has an above-average number of one-armed researchers. \n\nOh, yes. I figured out the 'other world' thing immediately. Like I said, humans, not the best at such things. While the researchers were busy interviewing one another, I got to work. Discovered some interesting things about this reality -- it is not //terribly// different. Slightly parallel to our own, a few historical shifts. Nothing major. The structure of the Foundation is much more hierarchical, for one -- no regional commands.\n\nThat, and they don't seem to have a Facility-57. No records of Venceslao, Dowell, González, myself, or anyone else here. In fact, the only member of the staff that //does// exist in this Foundation's database is the illustrious Doctor Everwood. \n\nAll of this is fishy, and not in the salmon-treat way.

That's what I was forgetting, what we were all forgetting.\n\nAnother search with my bumped-up clearance brought up nothing for Facility-57. No surprises there. I left the computer and went out for a walk around the facility. It was only hours later, nestled with my paws under my body next to a radiator with a bit of leftover fish in my mouth, that I remembered what the visitors had been chatting about when I first saw them: the differences between us and them.\n\nEverwood was a red herring, I realized while gnawing on the actual herring.

Everwood consulted their Group of Interest connections and determined that materials confiscated from Serpent's Hand operatives in 2022 had been digitized and stored in Site-57's database. These materials contained detailed instructions for a delicate thaumaturgical working capable of anchoring an area of space from an alternate multiversal plane in baseline reality, at the cost of an enormous expenditure of electrical power. They radioed this information to the plane.\n\nMarw convinced Site-57 that Agent Masterson and Researcher Dunwich were his 'hired stooges', and would be remaining in the plane. While the facility was occupied with entertaining its guest, Agent Masterson exploited inbuilt vulnerabilities to bypass its security systems and allow entry. Researcher Dunwich accessed the Site's reactor and performed a series of thaumaturgical interventions (with instructions supplied by the Everwoods' Serpent's Hand contacts) to prevent it from being utilized in this fashion again. He then returned to the plane, where he and Agent Masterson remained for the next seven hours.\n\nOn reboarding the plane, Marw described his rendezvous with Site-57 thusly: \"I sat on a warm server stack, she read me //The Maltese Falcon// out loud and did all the voices. I gave her the third degree, she gave me the runaround. She dimmed her lights, I killed three mice. Dames walk you into their lives, then shoo you out when you cough up on the carpet. We're all just one hairball from heartbreak in the end, friends.\"\n\nSite-57 sent a coded message to Facility-57 shortly thereafter, agreeing to reverse the translocation when signalled. The baseline Foundation envoys and Facility-57 staff took their leave of one another.\n\nThe following is a log of their final interaction.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n-----\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Everwood:**[[/span]] I can't believe you're finally going home! I have to admit, I never got used to seeing myself like that, but I guess I can't complain.\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Everwood:**[[/span]] Yeah, seeing myself walking and talking like that was really unusual, but I'm just glad we get to go home now. And since nothing bad happens if we touch, how about a high-five?\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Everwood:**[[/span]] Sure.\n\n//[Both high-five, then laugh.]//\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Masterson:**[[/span]] I'm gonna miss the food more than anything else.

Even just a little bit?\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Dowell:**[[/span]] No.\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Masterson:**[[/span]] Come on, Dowell. You gotta admit you grew to like me some. Eh? Eh?

I would have loved to work some more with you.\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Rodriguez:**[[/span]] Such is life. I appreciated your wisdom and guidance while we were here as well. Maybe in another life, we were coworkers.\n\n//[Venceslao laughs and takes a drag of his cigarette. Rodriguez cracks open his Pepsi and takes a sip.]//\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Venceslao:**[[/span]] Maybe. Maybe. With how big the multiverse is, there's a chance for everything and anything.\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Rodriguez:**[[/span]] Of course. I'm glad I got to share this last week with you and your personnel. It's been eye-opening. But I have to ask; what was with that blue crab we discovered when we first came searching for you?\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Venceslao:**[[/span]] Oh, that was just our own way of surveying what had happened around us. We sent him out to snoop around and see what he found. And he found your man! What luck.\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Rodriguez:**[[/span]] Huh. Okay.\n\n//[Von Braun enters the room, he is holding a box of bottles.]//\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Von Braun:**[[/span]] Who wants to take home some F-57 Beer? Brewed right here in my dormitory!

We have to. It's a part of our culture. If we don't work with each other, we'll fall apart.\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Rodriguez:**[[/span]] That's a nice thought.\n\n[[span class=\"ES\"]]**Venceslao:**[[/span]] It is, isn't it?\n\n[[span class=\"EN\"]]**Rodriguez:**[[/span]] Yes.

This Foundation didn't lose any personnel. Even Site-57 got her spirits raised a bit, that little minx. Everybody comes out happy.\n\nExcept me. But that's not a surprise -- it's the life I chose. Or maybe the life chose me. I certainly didn't //ask// sister fate to make me a talking cat with a thirst for justice. But, tip to tail, that's what I am, no denying it. \n\nTruth is, I'd been down in the dumps since well before we got multiversally-chucked. I live to solve mysteries -- our work is what gives us meaning. Everwood has Groups of Interest, Venceslao has running the Facility, Masterson has being a whole //p//-- well, the point is, I have mysteries. But Facility-57 was drying up. I had solved all there was to solve. And my continued presence around the complex made sure none of the employees or anomalies ever so much as took someone's lunch without asking, lest they risk my scouring eye.\n\nSo nobody noticed a tabby cat slipping out of the Facility just before the activation.\n\nThe way I see it, justice is an ongoing process. You clean up one place, you move on to the next. Facility-57 will be fine -- humans are stupid, but as far as humans go, Everwood, Venceslao, and Von Braun are about the best you can get. There's a whole world of cold cases and mysteries for me to solve here. Just as soon as I find a packet of cigs.\n\nBesides, that Site-57 broad says she'd like to meet up now and again. A cat can love, can't he?\n[[/div]]\n----\n[!-- = [[size 85%]]**[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-057-int Don’t forget to vote for this article on the INT Wiki for the purposes of the contest!]**[[/size]] --]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Uncle Nicolini, HarryBlank, & Rounderhouse]]\n> **Filename:** doors.jpg\n> **Name:** NORADBlast-Doors\n> **Author:** United States Air Force\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NORADBlast-Doors.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n> **Filename:** map.png\n> **Name:** Abrocoma_cinerea_map\n> **Author:** Dunnum, J., Bernal, N., Vivar, E., Jayat, J. & Ojeda, R. 2008\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://uk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%A4%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%BB:Abrocoma_cinerea_map.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n> **Filename:** helicopter.jpg\n> **Name:**  A US Marine Corps (USMC) CH-53E Sea Stallion helicopter assigned to Heavy Marine Helicopter Squadron Four Six Two (HMM-462), taxies after landing at Blair Field in Al Kut, Iraq, during Operation IRAQI FREEDOM\n> **Author:** U.S National Archives\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://picryl.com/media/a-us-marine-corps-usmc-ch-53e-sea-stallion-helicopter-assigned-to-heavy-marine-2d9b62|Picryl]]]\n\n> **Filename:** site57.png\n> **Name:** National Security Agency, 2013\n> **Author:** Trevor Paglen\n> **License:** CC0 1.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:National_Security_Agency,_2013.jpg|Wikimedia]]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
