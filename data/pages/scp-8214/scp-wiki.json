Backup copies of SCP-8214-A are stored in IT Department servers at Site-15. \n\nA database of all known SCP-8214-B instances and their corresponding SCP-8214-C instances is to be maintained by the Department of Prophetics.  \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"text\"]] **DESCRIPTION:** [[/span]]\n\nSCP-8214-A is the software //\"ATROPOS.EXE\"//. When running on a device SCP-8214-A displays a rudimentary interface consisting of a list of names comprising all human beings within a 10-meter radius below which is the prompt “//SELECT NAME//” and a command line to enter text. SCP-8214-A does not distinguish between living and deceased individuals, and further testing has established SCP-8214-A will only list individuals when a majority of their biomass remains within the 10-meter radius. Depending on the text input into the command line SCP-8214-A will produce the following effect:\n\n* When input with text not corresponding to any of the listed names SCP-8214-A will output the text //“INVALID”//.\n\n* When input with the listed name of a deceased individual SCP-8214-A will output a date matching their known time of death.\n \n* When input with the name of a currently living individual SCP-8214-A will output an apparently random date typically ranging 1-4 months into the future.\n\n\nThese dates, designated SCP-8214-B, act as Class I Prophetic Anomalies which will invariably result in the death of the named individual, designated SCP-8214-C, on the output time otherwise referred to as their activation date.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"text\"]] **DISCOVERY:** [[/span]]\n\nSCP-8214-A was first acquired in 2005 alongside other anomalies during a raid on a para-technology company formerly associated with Prometheus Labs. Initial assessment was carried out by junior researcher Emily Yoon of the IT Department. Her sudden death a year later via cardiac arrest incited an investigation that would eventually identify the prophetic effects of SCP-8214-B prompting its transfer to the Department of Prophetics in late 2006.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"title\"]]\n++ ADDENDUM 8214/I: EXPERIMENT LOG\n[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"padding-top: 20px; border:2px solid #373737;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]\n+++ EXPERIMENT 8214-01\n[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[span class=\"test\"]] **DATE** [[/span]] 12/02/2014\n\n[[span class=\"test\"]] **PRESIDING** [[/span]] Dir.
