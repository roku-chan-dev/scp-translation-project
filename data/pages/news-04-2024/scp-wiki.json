You can find out more in the convention's discord server here: https://discord.gg/FdnN9f7s4u. \n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n\nAnother bit of news out of the Spanish-speaking Branch of the Wiki this month; they are hosting a Dark Arts Contest called 'Necronomicon'! How's that for a clever name? The rules are simple, you and one other author must collaborate to create an SCP, Tale, or GoI Format that depicts a cursed object/individual. But wait, there's more! It's also an art contest! For more information on the contest, you can check out the hub [http://lafundacionscp.wikidot.com/necronomicon-2024 here!]\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Uncle Nicolini//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing prompts! Every month there will be user-submitted prompts to help inspire new pieces. Participation in these prompts is completely optional, and any pages based on the prompts will be featured in the next issue of Site News! If you're interested in submitting a prompt for next Site News, send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]]. One prompt submission per person, and up to five prompts will be shown in each edition of Site News. \n\nThis month's writing prompts are below! \n\n[[size x-large]]Mix & Match[[/size]] //Submitted by Merehrab//\nPick 3 random scps that don't already have tales written about them and write a tale that connects them together in a way that makes sense. Bonus points if one SCP is from early series one or two and another one is from the more recent series (seven, eight, or nine).\n\n[[size x-large]]Human Emeritus[[/size]] //Submitted by Caospin//\nWhat does it mean to be a \"human emeritus\"?\n\nIf you write an entry inspired by this or a previous month's prompts, feel free to send a wikidot PM to [[*user ParallelPotatoes]] to have it featured in the next Site News! There isn't a time limit on getting prompt submissions featured, so feel free to write for a previous month's prompts as well!
