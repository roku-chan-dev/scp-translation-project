You’ve found yourself on the homepage of the Kensing Farm, where I grow and publish SCP pages and tales by the bushel! Take a look at the produce!\n\n-- //Most Likely Kensing//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Right here, we’ve got our home-grown SCP Foundation tales, with the upcoming tale crop growing nicely in the draft stages. I'd recommend the series in particular!//\n\n||~ SCP Tales||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/back-to-your-irregularly-scheduled-programming Back to Your Irregularly Scheduled Programming] || Here's a somewhat gross tale about a nasty corporate documentary revealing and introducing my Greazeburger Incorporated GOI, and one of my favorites! Also, there’s an excellent reading by [[*user Doctor Fullham]] on this one, so be sure to check it out!||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/a-disgruntled-fan-letter-on-the-subject-of-clownery A Disgruntled Fan Letter on the Subject of Clownery] || This jamcon tale is an in-universe angry fan letter set in [[*user Tropinano]]'s Clownverse, and I had a lot of fun with this mess! ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/true-stories-with-lincoln-smoke-1-bambousio-starswinger-and True Stories With Lincoln Smoke #1: Bambousio Starswinger and Comedy Cryptids] || Another Clownverse tale, this time featuring a podcast gone completely off-the-rails! ||\n|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/pulled-pork Pulled Pork] || A creepy tale set in [[*user Marceline_Raynes]]' upcoming setting, where almost all natural light has vanished from the earth. Take a look! ||\n|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-canadian-standoff A Canadian Standoff] || Written for Azamo during the 2021 Holiday Art Exchange, this tale about a lunch thief getting caught in the act is one of my personal favorites! ||\n|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/corporate-dealings-after-the-calamity Corporate Dealings After The Calamity] || A melancholy unhuman tale featuring Martin Greaze, a strange desk lamp, and pancake mix.||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/lawyers-greaze-and-money Lawyers, Greaze, and Money] || Martin Greaze gets sued for every penny he has in this funny Greazeburger tale! ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-cave-and-the-garden The Cave and the Garden] || A short horror/springtime gothic tale where a man finds himself in a labyrinthian garden every night, chased by an unseen force that will do anything to keep him out.||\n\n//Next, we’ve got our SCP Foundation articles, fresh from my sandbox page! So far, a good variety of horror, humor, and maybe something in-between.//\n\n||~ SCP Articles||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6951 SCP-6951: Loyalty to the Company] || One of my darkest articles yet, this Greazeburger article features a dark insight into the company policies of Greazeburger Incorporated. ||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5324 SCP-5324: There'll Be No Next Time] || This one's the result of me wanting to see if I could pull off a horror skip in about 400 words! The end result worked out pretty well.||\n|| [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6676] SCP-6676: Unless] || A horror article about a worst-of-both-worlds combination between human and plant, the destruction of public and private property alike, and the discovery that the Foundation's motives aren't too different from the creatures that are irreparably altering the state of the world. ||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5519 SCP-5519: A Dark Timeline] || Right here's a short, weird skip very, very loosely based off of my frustration with various food intolerances. Fortunately, this takes place in an alternate universe, and is limited to a very distant corner of the Foundation multiverse!||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5229 SCP-5229: Dem Wet Bones] || This was my first-round entry for Jamcon 2021 before a currently under-way rewrite began, and it's a nice horror article about a liquid-craving skeleton!||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5951 SCP-5951: Corporate Dealings in the Multiverse at Large] || This one’s a nice Greazeburger skip about corporate takeover and also a quasi-sequel to Irregularly Scheduled Programming, although not as vibrant as the tale.||\n|| [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5215 SCP-5215: Welp, Sky’s Haunted] || My first skip here is a not-as-weird article about a friendly entity trying to help with light pollution in the somewhat far-off future, and while it is short, manages to express a melancholy atmosphere pretty well over the course of the story.||\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\nNow, there's serious stuff for a minute, so here's what should happen if I ever buy the farm:\n\n> \n> If I, Kensing, am inactive on the site, the IRC network, or the SCP Discord for over one year //without// prior notice, then [[*user Oboebandgeek99]] has control over my unhuman content, [[*user Tropinano]] has control over my clownverse content, and [[*user Mooagain]] has control over my Greazeburger content. I trust the staff of the SCP Wiki to handle the rest of my onsite work responsibly.\n> \n\nHere's hoping that I won't mysteriously gain possession of a large, open pasture anytime soon!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
