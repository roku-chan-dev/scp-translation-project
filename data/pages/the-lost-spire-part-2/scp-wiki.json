It looked exactly as Gwyneth described it. All of the buildings were constructed from silver and crystal, and had highly decorative trimmings and arches covered in gold and alabaster. Many tall towers and skyscrapers could be seen for miles. Now that she had a closer look at the buildings, she noticed the architectural style resembled Celtic designs with subtle traces of Indo-Islamic, yet it still retained the Fae architectural styling that she was familiar with.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/lost-utopia/City-Towers.jpg style=\"width: 625px; border: 8px solid #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #999;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nThey also took notice of the many figures soaring high in the sky. Changelings of all ages, flying without a care, family and friends enjoying themselves in the air.\n\n“Marvelous, absolutely marvelous! A work of art in itself.” King Ragna exclaimed in delight, highly impressed and fascinated by the city’s design.\n\n“I said it once, and I’ll say it again… I feel like we’re at the gates of Heaven.” Halloran said as he took in the sights before him. “I definitely need to document all this!” He exclaimed, before he pulled out his digital camera and began taking multiple photographs of his surroundings.\n\nThey managed to catch up to Artoria and Gwyneth, as Artoria was currently giving orders to her squad, who then saluted her before soaring off in the direction of the colossal palace in the distance. She then turned to them before speaking.\n\n“I’ve sent my squad to inform our queen of your arrival. She had a strong feeling that the lullaby was played, and is currently awaiting my return.”\n\n“We understand. I’m sure she has a lot to talk about with us, just as we do with her.” Asheworth replied as he continued to look around, basking in his surroundings.\n\n“Indeed. Until then, I will guide you and allow you to view the many sights of our homeland. I’ll also answer any questions that I can. However, some of them I humbly request you save for her grace to answer.” Artoria replied with a nod.\n\n“Great, because I have a ton of questions I’d like answered. Would you mind if I also interview you on the way there?” Gwyneth asked as she held her video camera in Artoria’s direction.\n\n“As long as I can answer them, it wouldn’t be a problem for me. Now then, let us be on our way.”\n\nThey all continued to follow Artoria as they passed many massive buildings, along with a few smaller settlements. Halloran continued to take many photos as they followed. Aside from the architecture, he noticed the attire of the citizens. They were all dressed in lovely sparkling reflective clothing made of a silky material, mainly white with traces of other colors. The males wore long-sleeved waist high tunics with a high collar, and ankle length pants, some also wore a long sash over their tunic. The females were garbed in gossamer long bell-sleeved dresses, some were knee length, and some were floor length and they dragged along the ground. One noticeable feature was that no one wore any footwear, A few wore ankle length silk stirrups, but the rest were completely barefoot.\n\nNormally Halloran wouldn’t question cultural fashion sense, but he couldn’t help but be curious. So, he went up to Artoria for answers.\n\n“Say, I’ve got a question for you. Now this might seem random, but why don’t any of you wear shoes?”\n\nArtoria gave him a confused look before she looked down to their feet then back to him.\n\n“This? It is simply our custom to be unshod. It represents how we wish to live in harmony and equality with nature and progress, as well as embracing both peace and purity.”\n\n“Speaking of customs, it was stated that Fata Morgana followed the ways of The Inventor and was therefore free of the corruptive influence of Mab. Is this true?” Gwyneth asked as she continued recording.\n\n“It is indeed true. The Inventor herself was the one who orchestrated the construction of Fata Morgana, intended to be a sanctuary of peace and equality, a metropolis that was clean and untouched by The Undoer’s wicked ideals. This is why we bowed to her, because it was her will that breathed life into the city.” Artoria answered, as she spoke with great reverence.\n\n“So your city was, in a sense, independent from the rest of the empire?” Captain Agron asked, as he joined in asking questions of Artoria.\n\n“It was somewhat, in the beginning, but we still had support from both the common peoples and the wealthy. But it eventually became fully independent, for out of spite and jealousy, Mab chose to separate the city from the rest of the empire, and isolated us within as a sign of defiance against those who would question or defy her ways. She hated Fata Morgana just as much as she hated her sister, and so did not accept it as part of her kingdom, even though everyone else did.” Artoria answered, as she spoke with great disdain.\n\nGwyneth seemed greatly pleased by the answer, as she laughed, and fist pumped her free hand.\n\n“Yes, I was right! That must mean the same thing also applied to anything that came from the city, yes?”\n\n“Indeed. We had to reclaim everything that was created within Fata Morgana, because we knew Mab would most likely destroy them just to spite her sister. It’s very likely she succeeded in destroying some items, but we often made duplicates to ensure such works didn’t end up lost to time. All of the art pieces, literary works, and songs that we’ve ever created now resides within our many museums and music halls.” Artoria responded, in a tone that implied she was feeling disappointment. “It is truly a shame, all of these wonders we have created, and nobody in the outside world remembers them.”\n\n“Hold on a second. You said //all// of your artifacts were reclaimed, but we found a painting of Fata Morgana in the ruins of the empire’s royal repository. Not only that, but it had a note that told us how to summon the city. Why would that painting be in there if everything you created was taken back, and why would it have that note? What happened to this place in the past?” Asheworth asked Artoria, as he felt there were some things that didn’t make sense or hadn’t yet been answered.\n\n“I’ve been meaning to ask that as well. Legends said that Fata Morgana suddenly disappeared on the day the two queens fought. Completely vanished. Why?” Rivera asked, as eager for the answers as Asheworth was.\n\nArtoria was silent for a few seconds, as she looked down at the ground with a somber expression.\n\n“…I believe it would be better for our queen to answer those questions.” She held her somber expression for a few moments, before it shifted to a more pleasant one. “But enough questions of the past, let’s focus on questions of the present. Also take time to bask in your surroundings.”\n\nThey then reached an interchange of bridge walkways, all over a large lake filled with glistening water, its channels breaking off into deeper parts of the city. Many Changelings were looking over the railways enjoying the view, while some were flying over the water. Suddenly, on the right edge of the lake, jets of water shot up in the air from several areas of the lake. One male Changeling got his face soaked as a fountain erupted right below him. His female companion laughed loudly.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/lost-utopia/Lake-Fountains.jpg style=\"width: 625px; border: 8px solid #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #999;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nWhat caught the group’s attention the most was on the left side of the lake. Several Changelings were riding small boats on the water, both individually and in groups. The boats had a regal and fantastical design, resembling a medieval or 16th century sailboat. However, the boats appeared advanced in as much as they were outfitted with outboard engines of some sorts, and the sails seemed to be only decorative as they were made of some form of penetrable hard light.\n\n“Are those motorboats?” Rivera asked.\n\nThey then heard humming from above. When they looked up, they saw a trio of aircrafts flying above the buildings, all very advance in design and varying in shape and size. One was vivid white and covered in golden decals. The body was a teardrop shape with four wings, two large wings in the front and two smaller ones in the back. Another looked like a platinum colored helicopter, but instead of blades, it had four long wings similar to a jet plane in an X formation. The last one resembled something straight out of a space fighter science fiction film. A purple vertical pill shaped body with two curved tear shaped front arms, and two back legs in the shape of medieval shields.\n\n“Air vehicles?” Halloran questioned with surprise.\n\nThey then focused to Artoria’s crescent staff. Now that they had a closer view of it, not only was it highly detailed with engravings and embedded jewels, but they also noticed the channels flowing with thaumaturgical energy, starting from the fancy pommel piece at the bottom and ending at the tip of the blade. a faint glow also emanated from the edged of the blade.\n\nThinking quickly, Asheworth pulled out his EESPR and scanned the weapon, the readings showed it was flowing and emitting EVE.\n\n“Thaumaturgic technology… They’re advanced.” Asheworth said in astonishment, realizing that Fata Morgana had become an advanced civilization.\n\nArtoria overheard this and decided to reply.\n\n“Why yes, you are surprised that we have our own technology? I mean it’s only logical that overtime we would become a more advanced culture and create our own technology, especially after thousands of years. Because we always valued the art and beauty of magic, we chose to center our technology around it. Every device you’ll find in the city is powered and energized through mana, collected and studied for countless generations.”\n\n“You found the means to utilize mana as an energy source? Highly impressive! Though it is a common practice that one can use mana to empower and enchant other living things or objects, never have it been done on this level before! Not even my home of Arcadia has yet to reach this level.” King Ragna stated, visibly amazed at the level of progress the Fae of Fata Morgana had reached.\n\n“Yeah, how did you do it? What’s the secret?” Gwyneth asked excitedly.\n\nArtoria answered by flipping the staff upside down then twisting the ring on the pommel, activating a mechanism that made it open like a budding flower. Inside was an ornately glowing pink crystal. It rippled and glistened with energy and a hypnotic light.\n\n“This is a mana crystal. Seven thousand years ago, one of the Spire Court’s most enlightened scholars made a hypothesis. If all living things were capable of generating mana, and some materials could conduct mana, then would it not be possible for there to exist or even create objects that could emit mana? So, they began researching and experimenting in order to discover the means to create a substance capable of emanating its own mana. Eventually, after much struggle and from studying the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000 Yeren’s] biomancy, they succeeded in creating these! Organic crystals capable of generating mana. They are easy to grow, and depending on the color, as well as the quality or size, can last for years.”\n\n“That’s incredible! Such a mineral could bring the study of thaumaturgy to a whole new level!” Asheworth exclaimed, genuinely astonished by the information Artoria just shared. If the Foundation had access to such a resource, the breakthroughs they can achieve in thaumaturgical studies would be immense.\n\nAs Artoria closed the pommel, Gwyneth noticed something familiar about the metal. She realized her weapon and portions of her armor were not only created with a similar metal, but resembled a metal she was quite familiar with. She wondered how she didn’t notice it before.\n\n“Wait a minute, your weapon and armor, is that… irrilite?”\n\nArtoria looked down at her armor and at her weapon before looking back to Gwyneth.\n\n“Fortunately, they are, yes.”\n\n“Fortunately? What does that mean?” Rivera asked.\n\n“I mean my weapon and armor are indeed made of irrilite, but it is no longer available in the abundance it once was.” Artoria responded as she began waving and caressing the blade of her staff. “We once had a large amount of pure irrilite in the past, however, over time, our supply of it had begun to dwindle quickly in more recent years. This concerned us greatly. Thankfully however, we found a solution.”\n\n“Which was?” Halloran asked.\n\n“Through our research, we found that yttrium becomes very strong and magically conductive when polished with a slurry made from powdered mana crystal. We refer to this super yttrium as morgana silver. While inferior in power, it has allowed us to slow the decrease of our precious irrilite enough that we can ensure it will remain available to us for centuries to come. We limit our use of irrilite only for the most important or dire circumstances.” Artoria stated. She ushered them to continue forward. “Let us continue. We do not want to keep her grace waiting.”\n\nAfter admiring the view of the lake and the boats for a few more seconds, they continued on their way through the city.\n\nDuring their walk, they came across many other sights that caught their attention, all of them captured on footage by Gwyneth and Halloran.\n\nThey walked through one of the many parks in the city, which much like the rest of the city, matched the description in the spire tome. The trees resembled a cross between an //Alstonia scholaris// and a //Bluewood Condalia//. As they walked, the soft wind rustled the trees, resulting in a sound resembling a windchime or a harp. It was a very lush and beautiful environment, filled with healthy grass and flower fields. They saw many Changelings enjoying themselves, from families having picnics, to couples enjoying a stroll. During the walk, Halloran thought he must be imagining things when he saw what looked like a man in a tuxedo with the head of a white rabbit sitting at a table drinking tea. He wasn’t sure if what he saw was real or not, but just in case, he would mention it when they arrived at their destination.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/lost-utopia/Lush-Park.jpg style=\"width: 625px; border: 8px solid #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #999;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nThey then passed some sort of musical concert. There was a crowd gathered around a stage, where a group of Changelings in flashy and whimsical clothing were playing decorated instruments. There were fancy and dazzling lights effects added to make the show more exciting. The music being played seemed to be a blend of pop and classical, and was both elegant and energetic. The crowd definitely enjoyed it as they cheered and even danced to the music, with some dancing a ballot in the sky.\n\nThey eventually found themselves crossing through a market district. Many stands and establishments sold everything from exotic trinkets to delicious foods. The market was quite crowded, as many Changelings passed along the stands and made purchases. It wasn’t long before the crowd took notice of Artoria and with her guests. Many of them looked on in confusion and curiosity at Asheworth, Rivera and Halloran. Whether because some of them have never seen humans in the flesh before, or because they wondered why humans were in Fata Morgana. Gwyneth’s presence was not as startling, as she was a Fae just like them. But the fact that she was a //Sidhe// Fae and not a //Changeling// Fae was quite unusual. King Ragna and Captain Agron had caught the most attention and reaction. Completely unfamiliar with the Droganians and unaware of their connection to the Sky Keepers, the Changelings watched them with fascination.\n\n“Well, this is awkward.” Halloran said, as he couldn’t help but feel uncomfortable with everyone staring at them, some of them whispering to each other.\n\n“What did you expect? These people aren’t used to seeing humans here, so it’s only natural they’d be confused and feel uncomfortable.” Rivera stated to Halloran, already familiar with similar feelings.\n\n“Yeah, I guess you make a good point there.” Halloran replied, as he decided to continue photographing his surroundings, to the surprise of a number of the citizens.\n\n“All these faces looking upon us with amazement, yet none of them recognize us as those who helped their ancestors blossom.” King Ragna stated somberly, finding it a bit upsetting that the Fae here didn’t recognize his kind with their new forms, and thus a number looked upon them in worry.\n\nAs they were walking through the market, they approached one stand where a Changeling vendor with a beard and balding head was preoccupied with counting his daily profits. Once he noticed the group, he initially was just as confused as the others, however, his eyes then caught sight of something familiar. An ID tag with a circular symbol with three arrows pointing inward. Seeing this symbol flooded his mind with very unpleasant memories, of a time of agony and unbearable self-unfamiliarity. This caused his blood to boil as he gnashed his teeth and exclaimed “YOU!”\n\nEveryone in the area was startled by the unexpected angry exclamation. They all turned to the vendor, who pointed straight at Asheworth and his Foundation colleagues. He then suddenly jumped out his booth and immediately tried to tackle them, only for Artoria to interfere as she pushed him back with her staff.\n\n“What is the meaning of this?! Stand down!” Artoria demanded, as she continued to restrain him.\n\n“You bastards! You dare show yourselves here in this paradise?! You think I haven’t forgotten what you segregating tyrants have done?!” The vendor shouted as he continued his attempts to reach the humans.\n\nThe ruckus had begun to attract a crowd, and the changelings were wondering what the angry commotion was about.\n\n“I said stand down! This is unacceptable behavior!” Artoria shouted, now getting annoyed at the man’s uncivilized behavior.\n\n“Do you have any idea what it’s like to experience what you did to me; do you know what if feels like?!” The vendor shouted as he continued to struggle, even as more guards arrived to assist in restraining him. “Having who you are forcibly ripped out of you, not remembering who you are or your true face?! Being trapped within **##green|that damn endless purgatorial nightmare##**, for 57 years?! I’ll never forgive you! You hear me?! When I get my hands on you, I’ll make you experience an agony you could never imagine, so violent and traumatizing it will make the Daevites look like hippies! I’ll have you—” He continued to shout before one of the guards pulled out a glittering blue powder and blew it into the vendor’s face. He coughed as his struggling began to diminish, and he slowly faded to unconsciousness.\n\n“Have him brought to the courthouse for questioning once he awakens. Make sure to have a plentiful supply of tranquil dust on hand should he become agitated.” Artoria ordered the guards, as she stood upright and dusted herself off.\n\n“Yes captain!” A female guard said, as they began to fly off with the man in tow.\n\nArtoria turned her attention to the uneasy crowd, and Asheworth’s group who looked confused and uncomfortable.\n\n“All right everyone, break it up! Nothing to see here, just a mere misunderstanding. Everything is under control. There’s nothing to be worried about. Carry on!” Artoria assured the crowd, who began to disperse and return to browsing the market. “That’s better.”\n\n“Um… What the hell was that?!” Halloran demanded, absolutely confused by the unexpected aggressiveness of the vendor.\n\n“Yeah, what exactly was he talking about? Is there something we should know about?” Asheworth questioned, now feeling suspicious and being left in the dark.\n\nArtoria sighed before responding.\n\n“I very much apologise, but for your sake I’d not have those badges to be visible for all to see while we are out in the open.” She said, as she pointed to Halloran’s Foundation ID tag.\n\n“Why not?” Rivera asked, also uncomfortable at the sudden outburst.\n\n“I’m sorry, but that is better being answered by our queen. We should get moving.” Artoria informed them, as she continued forward. The others follow her in silence.\n\nFor the rest of their walk, not much was said after the unexpected hostility from the vendor. They chose to save asking about it until they met the city’s leader, but Asheworth and Rivera couldn’t stop thinking about the things that the vendor said in his outburst.\n\n“Daniel, that vendor back at the market, those things he said… It sounds like he was talking about—” Rivera whispered to Asheworth, who quickly responded back.\n\n“Yeah, I noticed it too. There’s something going on here in this city. Something bigger that the Foundation is somehow connected to.”\n\n“You might be right. Do you think it has anything to do with the 3903-A instances?” Rivera questioned back, agreeing with Asheworth that the Changelings were hiding something.\n\n“We’ll soon find out. For now, let’s stay quiet about it.” Asheworth instructed Rivera.\n\n“Alright.”\n\nThey walked for fifteen minutes more as they continued to view the many sights within the city. They passed several more parks and other water bridges, as well as some type of water park which contained glistening pools and numerous structures similar to water slides. The Changelings present were wearing some type of swimwear. There was even a lazy river that went underground, with faint light and music emanating from the tunnel entrance.\n\nViewing these beautiful sights helped the group feel more at ease, admiring how these people were living in a truly peaceful and wonderous place.\n\nEventually they finally reached their destination as Artoria led them to an absolutely incredible sight. They found themselves in front of the colossal palace that was visible from outside the city, and it was a truly unbelievable sight to behold.\n\nThe palace was megalithic in size, possibly the largest structure to have ever been built. It had to be a thousand meters in both width and length. It retained the same architectural styling as all the other buildings in Fata Morgana, but with a more regal and aristocratic appearance. The design of the palace resembled a cross between the Taj Mahal, the Sagrada Família, the Sultan Ahmed Mosque, and the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem. It was flanked on all sides by multiple towers, all slightly taller than the main portion of the palace. However, the most noticeable feature of the structure was the immensely tall spire-like tower perched directly atop the center of the palace. It was so tall and slim that it not only rose above the clouds, but it seemed almost impossible for it to remain stationary without some form of support. While barely visible, there seemed to be an observation deck at the top.\n\n“Holy shit, look at the size of it!” Halloran exclaimed, dumbstruck and overwhelmed by the size of the structure.\n\n“It’s huge! I don’t think such a structure of this size has ever been documented or discovered before.” Rivera said as she stared at the palace in awe.\n\n“The Titania Spire…” Gwyneth said, as she had to crane her neck back to capture the entire structure on her video camera.\n\n“Truly incredible! It greatly warms my heart to see how much your civilization has prospered.” King Ragna remarked towards Artoria.\n\n“The Titania Spire is the pride and heart of Fata Morgana, constructed by the greatest architects of the Fae Empire to ever live. The outside is indeed glorious, but it is even more magnificent on the inside. Let us proceed. We don’t want to keep her grace waiting.” Artoria said as she ushered them in.\n\nShe led them through the massive golden doors, held ajar for them by palace guards. Once they passed through the doors, they were met with a massive, bustling glittering lobby lined with marble columns and a polished quartz floor heavily detailed in colorful patterns. There were many beautifully carved murals on every side of the chamber, each depicting Fae figures in either nature or city environments. In the center, surrounded by water fountains and flower bed displays, was a decorated cylindrical column that rose to the ceiling with a door in the center. It was revealed to be an elevator as the doors opened and a group of Changelings came out and another group went in. Looking up, they could see there were many more floors within the structure, each taking the form of a ring-shaped balcony with four walkways leading to the center elevator.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/lost-utopia/Spire-Lobby.jpg style=\"width: 625px; border: 8px solid #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #999;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n“Well, I can say you were right about it being just as amazing on the inside.” Asheworth said, as he admired the room’s décor.\n\n“May I ask, why would you need an elevator if you can fly? I’ve also been meaning to ask the same thing about the aircrafts as well.” Halloran asked Artoria as he glanced at the aforementioned elevator.\n\n“While our wings may be strong and flowing with mana, they are just like any other muscle or limb of our body. Eventually they get tired and need a break. It also eases the burden on carrying heavy loads to higher areas!” Artoria answered Halloran.\n\n“Okay, you make a good point.”\n\n“Speaking of the elevator, let us make our way to the royal chambers.” Artoria said, as she ushered them all toward the elevator.\n\nOnce in front of the sliding doors, she pressed one of many glowing sigils on the side, choosing the one that had an insignia resembling a tiara. After several seconds, the elevator doors opened, and they all entered as the doors closed behind them. To their surprise, the elevator’s interior was much larger than it appeared on the outside, big enough to fit a small crowd.\n\n“A non-euclidean spaced elevator? Impressive.” Asheworth said, as he admired the elevator as they ascended.\n\n“If I may, before we meet face to face, what can you tell us about your monarch? Not to sound like I am making accusations, but considering this city was a part of the Fae Empire and knowing of one of their rulers…\" Captain Agron asked Artoria, as he felt cautious and unsure of their meeting with the city’s queen.\n\n“I assure you her highness is a benevolent and kind individual, with a pure heart and soul. She is a sweet and caring ruler who ensures the happiness and safety of not only her people here, but for Fae of all kinds. She is also one who can see the good in all souls, and knows when one is deserving of forgiveness for any wrongdoing. She is in all ways a mirror image of the beauty and kindness of the Inventor, in more ways than you can fathom!” Artoria retorted back to Captain Agron, slightly offended by his assumptions.\n\nCaptain Agron was slightly taken back by this response, but he straightened himself and cleared his throat.\n\n“…Forgive me, I did not mean to offend you in any way. I just wanted to be sure there was nothing to be concerned about before we meet your queen. I am simply considering the safety of my liege.”\n\n“I accept your apology, and I understand as we both are the most trusted guards to our leaders.” Artoria assured him, understanding Agron’s reasoning.”\n\nThe elevator then stopped, as the doors opened into a hallway lined with lush flower beds and paintings of regal Fae figures.\n\nAs they walked down the hallway, one of the paintings caught Gwyneth’s attention. It depicted a Sidhe Fae woman with golden hair with silver highlights. She was wearing a regal green dress with white bell sleeves and an unusual necklace. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-enlightened-children It was a golden charm with a red gem and a dragon shaped motif in the center]. But the most eye-catching detail was the floating crown composed of gears hovering above her head.\n\n“Is that…?” Gwyneth whispered to herself in question, as she looked at the painting in familiarity.\n\nTwo other paintings also caught her attention. The first one featured the same woman with her hands clasping the hands of a male Changeling Fae with short brown combed hair and sky-blue eyes. He was wearing a decorated tunic and cape along with a sapphire encrusted silver crown. Both were smiling in the painting, which made it give off a very romantic vibe. The second one depicted the Fae king holding an infant wrapped up in a white blanket. She had golden locks of hair peeking out of the blanket around her forehead.\n\n“…What?” Gwyneth questioned, with a look of shock and confusion at what she was viewing in the paintings.\n\nHer thoughts were interrupted however by the sound of a female voice singing. It was getting louder as they approached the end of the hallway, where a set of incredibly ornate platinum doors stood before them.\n\n“Here we are, the royal chamber.” Artoria said, as she then opened the doors and led them inside.\n\nThe room was a large domed chamber where a star-shaped chandelier hung from the ceiling. The chandelier also held smaller star themed decorations. The area was overflowing with many colorful plants and flowers along the walls. The chamber had the overall feeling of a garden. Numerous butterflies fluttered in the air, over the lights and around the plants. They didn’t resemble any currently known species, as their large wings were a sun yellow with a blue, white, and pink diamond pattern that resembled stained glass. A faint trail of sparkles coming from their wings as they fluttered in the air was also visible.\n\nFinally, they noticed the source of the singing. At the end of the room, a throne similar to a hammock chair was suspended from a gazebo covered in flora and surrounded by lavender grass.\n\nPerched on the throne with her eyes closed was a Changeling woman with waist length golden blonde silky hair. She wore a white elegant gossamer dress with angel sleeves and gold trimmings and a long train. Her gown had golden shoulder guards and she wore glimmering full length fingerless gloves. Much like all the other Fae in the city, her feet were bare, with the exception of thigh high white stirrups which matched with her gloves. Perched on her head was a platinum tiara adorned with bright pink flowers, and a set of decorative silver inlayed gold Fae wings on the sides. Although she also wore several gold jewelry pieces, her wings were her most beautiful trait. They were large and glittering, light gold in color and emitted a white shimmering light. Their stained-glass pattern made them look mesmerizing as the wings pulsed with colors.\n\nShe was beautiful, young and flawless. Combined with her natural beauty and elegant attire, she resembled an angel more than a Fae.\n\nShe was singing to a group of small children. The song she was singing was an extended variant of the same song that was on the note that summoned the city. Besides her were two female twins. Both had blue eyes and midnight blue long hair, although the one on the right’s skin had a more purple tint compared to the blue of her twin. They both wore gossamer gowns and laurel crowns. The one on the left played a golden harp, while the one on the right played a velvet ocarina.\n\nArtoria loudly cleared her throat before speaking.\n\n“My queen, I have returned with the strangers.”\n\nThe queen stopped singing and opened her eyes, revealing them to be sky-blue and sparkling, as she along with the twins and children looked at Artoria and the others.\n\n“That will be all for now children, we will continue later at another time. You may return to your parents.” The queen softly said to the group of children, who immediately rushed past Asheworth and the others, giggling as they ran through the doors.\n\nShe then stood from her throne and approached the group, walking on her toes with a graceful and soft step as the twins followed her.\n\nArtoria turned to the others as she bowed her head and held her arm out to the queen.\n\n“Presenting her majesty, the Lady Titania of Fata Morgana, Queen Áine Lurline Tanaquill.”\n\nQueen Áine stood before them as she spread her arms out with a slight bow.\n\n“I have been expecting your arrival. Welcome to my home. I hope the trip and sights were to your liking.”\n\n“Indeed, they were. Your city is quite a sight. The most beautiful I’ve ever seen.” Rivera said, bowing her head as a show of respect.\n\n“Fata Morgana’s beauty knows no boundaries, for it is felt within the currents of time and the will of the soul. I see you’ve already met my captain of the guard, Artoria.” Queen Áine replied.\n\n“Yes, your highness. She has shown us around the city, and answered several questions we’ve had.” Gwyneth said, as she moved forward. “It is an honor to meet you. My name is Olivié Gwyneth, a Fae historian.”\n\n“A great pleasure it is to have you here my dear. It has been so long since a Sidhe Fae has walked within Fata Morgana. Tell me, are you the one who played Morgana’s Lullaby?” Queen Áine greeted Gwyneth, with an unexpected soft embrace that made Gwyneth slightly blush before she let go.\n\n“No, your highness, the one you want is him.” Gwyneth said as she pointed to King Ragna.\n\n“Oh, you must be the one that my guards informed me of. The one whose people descended from the Sky Keepers of old. Droganians I believe is what they said, yes?” Queen Áine said as she approached King Ragna, showing signs of excitement and curiosity.\n\n“You are correct, Queen Áine. My people survived Mab’s purge and still walk this Earth, evolved into a new people. My name is Ragna Von Morrowind, Vajra King of the city of Arcadia. It is an honor to be welcomed to your magnificent metropolis.” King Ragna introduced himself, as he took Queen Áine’s right hand and softly kissed it as a respectful gesture.\n\n“I must speak in gratitude as well. Captain Agron, his trusted commander of the Droganian Army.” Captain Agron said as he placed his hand on his heart.\n\n“The gratitude is mine, knowing all that your ancestors have done for my people in ancient times. I do wish to hear much about your people and this Arcadia.” Queen Áine said to King Ragna, before her attention was drawn back to Asheworth and his companions. “Of course, let us not forget our human guests. You are the first humans I have ever seen in person.”\n\n“I am sure a lot of the people here feel the same way. I am Daniel Asheworth. These are my colleagues Jessie Rivera and Chris Halloran. We’re researchers from—” Asheworth replied as he began introducing himself and his colleagues, before he was interrupted by the blue twin.\n\n“The SCP Foundation.”\n\nThis of course, surprised and shocked the team as they stared at her with wide eyes.\n\n“What? How do you know that?!” Halloran exclaimed in confusion.\n\n“Because she has met your people before. I’m Erelynn Levainn, and this is my sister Elewynn. We are her majesties’ royal minstrels.” The purple twin, now known as Erelynn answered.\n\n“She has? How?” Gwyneth asked.\n\n“Because I wouldn’t be here if it weren’t for your organization, you brought me here.” Elewynn responded as she moved to stand next to her sister.\n\nHearing this, Asheworth immediately put two and two together.\n\n“You were a 3903-A weren’t you? An Otherkin.”\n\n“My sister and I both are actually; I was first, and she came much later.” Erelynn said.\n\n“So, you two used to be human?” Rivera asked.\n\n“No, they were always Fae, but it wasn’t until they returned to this city, that they were truly Fae once more.” Queen Áine said as she placed her hands on the twins’ shoulders.\n\n“What does that even mean? In fact, I think now would be a good time to stop with the pleasantries and get some answers from you. Because we have many questions.” Halloran stated as he walked up to Queen Áine and looked her in the eyes.\n\n“I know that you have questions, and I promise all of them will be answered. But first I must ask questions of my own. Firstly, why have you come to Fata Morgana?” Queen Áine asked them, as she stepped back a bit and looked at everyone in Asheworth’s group.\n\n“A day ago, we discovered the royal repository of the Fae Empire. Inside we found numerous artifacts, but the most notable is a painting depicting this very building. Thanks to Ms. Gwyneth here, we were able to learn about the legend of Fata Morgana and how it disappeared.” Asheworth informed Queen Áine, as he and Rivera moved to the front of the group.\n\n“Not only that, but the painting secretly contained a note that stated if we played this //Morgana’s Lullaby// as you called it, it would summon the ancient city. However, that begs numerous questions. Why was that painting in the repository in the first place? Artoria confirmed that all relics and works made in Fata Morgana were reclaimed so Mab wouldn’t destroy them. If that’s true, why was that painting in there, and why did it have that note with instructions to bring back the city, and most importantly… what happened to Fata Morgana? Why did it disappear?” Rivera chimed in as she also began laying out the main questions of interest.\n\nQueen Áine was quiet for several seconds, as she looked at the ground with a somber expression. She then finally looked back up to them and spoke.\n\n“The Inventor.”\n\n“The Inventor?” Gwyneth asked.\n\n“She is not only the reason that this city came to be, but she is also the reason why it vanished and has not been seen since. However, it was to protect us and the ones she loved.” Queen Áine stated, as she looked up to the ceiling.\n\n“Protect? From what, and how?” Halloran questioned.\n\n“To protect us from Mab in case she fell. You see, the Inventor didn’t just guard and watch over the city because she helped create it and cared for its people, but because she cared for its governing ruler more than anything else in the world. The first lord of Fata Morgana, Adresin Balloer. He and the Inventor actually knew each other since their youth and were very close, so much so it was believed that they were having an affair in secret. No one, not even Mab herself knew about it, or as it was assumed.” Queen Áine began explaining.\n\n“When the time came for her to face Mab and put an end to her tyranny, she first came here to Fata Morgana, to Adresin and gave him a crystal flower and her greatest treasure. She then told him, demanded of him, that he hide the city from the world, to send it somewhere else, beyond this realm where it be isolated and safe, and to wait there until it could return. The crystal flower reflected her lifeforce. She told Adresin that if the flower was still healthy and strong when the hour of midnight struck, then it would mean that she survived and that it was safe for the city to return. However, if it were to wilt, crumble and shatter, then it meant she had sadly perished, slain by her wretched twin. If that were to happen, then the city would remain hidden, separated from the world until the day came when Mab was no more, and the world was once again pure and tranquil.”\n\nQueen Áine stopped for a few seconds before she continued “To let it be known that day had come, she secretly took one piece of work from Fata Morgana back with her, slipped a hymn sheet with a message in her writing, and stored it in the empires’ vault of treasures to be found by the ones from this bright new world, so they could bring back the silver towers. She also made him promise that if the latter possibility did come to pass, he would not only protect Fata Morgana and its people, but would also protect and cherish her greatest treasure. Her most prized possession, the one thing that she cherished and loved just as much as Adresin, maybe even more. He swore on their love that he would, for it was his greatest treasure too.”\n\n“Isolation… into a separate reality.” Asheworth exclaimed, now that the mystery of the city’s fate was answered. They intentionally separated the city from baseline reality to ensure its survival, thus turning into a nexus.\n\n“So, The Inventor was in love with the king? That’s quite a surprise.” Halloran exclaimed, interested by the new information.\n\n“Actually, that brings up a question, what was this great treasure of hers? I was told that it was theorized that the Inventor entrusted something to the city, but what exactly was it? Also, what exactly do you mean it was Adresin’s greatest treasure too?” Rivera asked, as she pondered what the treasure might be.\n\nSurprisingly, Queen Áine didn’t have to answer Rivera, as Gwyneth’s eyes widened as she came to a sudden realization.\n\n“A child…”\n\n“What?” Rivera asked, as she barely heard Gwyneth.\n\n“Those paintings in the hall, one of them depicted who I assume was Adresin, and he was holding a baby girl. The greatest treasure… it was a child, the Inventor and Adresin’s child!” Gwyneth explained.\n\nAsheworth and the others looked shocked as they looked to Queen Áine for clarification. She smiled in response.\n\n“Your friend is indeed correct. The treasure was her daughter, Ariel… my ancestor.”\n\n“…Oh my god!” Halloran said, as he placed his hand on his forehead and stared off into the distance, trying to absorb what had just been revealed.\n\n“I-I don’t know what to say.” Asheworth stated.\n\n“Don’t worry, that is pretty much everyone’s reaction when they find out.” Elewynn stated with a look of slight amusement.\n\n“It was quite a surprise to us when we first found out as well.” Erelynn followed up.\n\n“But… I don’t understand. How can this be?! This is just so sudden! I mean, neither I nor anyone else has ever found any relics or documents that implies the Inventor had a child!” Gwyneth ranted, as she was overwhelmed by the fact that not only was The Inventor a mother, but that the woman standing in front of them was a descendant.\n\n“That is because she did not want anyone to know. She feared that if Mab were to find out her sister was gravid, she would harm or kill the child, or do something far worse such as place a curse on her while she was still in the womb. Mab would have done so as she would see the child as a potential threat to her power should they mature. So, the Inventor kept the truth hidden from the rest of the empire. She even went so far as to use powerful illusions on herself to hide her development, although, she was getting concerned that Mab may have already had suspicions. Luckily however, Ariel was born at early dawn on the very day the Inventor would face Mab. She entrusted Adresin, as the father, to protect and care for Ariel if she did not return from her confrontation with Mab. Of course, she never did.” Queen Áine stated somberly, which is understandable as she spoke of her beloved and legendary ancestor.\n\n“Do not let her passing sadden you. You should know that thanks to her sacrifice, her people were freed from her sister’s evil ways. Look at the city you stand in now. It is a paradise! She ensured it survived and it is a symbol that not all the Fae Empire was corrupt. You and your ancestors have even ensured it prospered into such a beautiful and peaceful place. I’m sure the Inventor is watching you from beyond… and is truly proud of you.” King Ragna said, as he placed his hand on Queen Áine’s shoulder and comforted her.\n\n“Speaking of which, if I may interject, I do have a concern that you could perhaps address. During our travels through the city, I noticed all your guards carry magical mana charged weaponry, and saw one of the sigils for the elevator resembled a sword. If I were to guess, I assume this would be an armory. Also, I must state that Artoria and her comrades first reacted to us with caution and signs of unease, stating they did not know if we were a threat. So, I must ask, why this assumption of possible hostility, and why have weapons? Are you not a peaceful people?” Captain Agron stepped in and questioned Queen Áine.\n\n“We are, and always have been.” She then sighed before continuing. “Unfortunately, when we separated the city to the space beyond this realm, we did not expect there would be forces and horrors on the outside. Hordes of lifeforce draining demons, soulless abominations that knew only destruction, unspeakable malevolent beings that can break the mind like the stone against glass, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3930 formless specters ripped between existence and the void that howl and rage with no clarity]. To defend ourselves from these threats, we decided to focus on the development of our military prowess, to ensure that Fata Morgana and its people would never become prey for the wretches from beyond. We amassed a strong army, designed durable battle armor, and constructed great war machines and powerful weapons, all for the sake of protecting our home and ensuring peace for us all from the wicked and the abominable. We are a peaceful people, but even the most tranquil of utopias must know when to prepare themselves for battle.” Queen Áine replied.\n\n“I see now, that is indeed a wise and responsible ideal to follow. Forgive me for my suspicions your grace.” Captain Agron stated, as he bowed his head as a gesture of apology. “I am relieved to know you are prepared should the need arise. You should stick to that ideal, because unfortunately, we summoned your city at the wrong time. The world is not in a state where your people can just roam freely—” He began to inform the queen, but he was interrupted by her as she cut him off.\n\n“I know of what you speak. You refer to the many dangers which still walk this earth, and of what the humans that control the world from the shadows refer to as The Veil… I also know that our people, the Fae have suffered a horrible tragedy, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ralliston-s-proposal where thousands of souls have been lost and stripped of their names, one that the ones known as The Foundation had a hand in].”\n\nAsheworth’s group was once again completely taken back, and their eyes widened by what Queen Áine had stated.\n\n“How… How do you know about all that?!” Rivera shouted in surprise at the queen’s awareness of the Veil and of the Third Diaspora\n\nQueen Áine looked to the Levainn twins and Artoria, giving them a nod and a look of assurance. They silently responded by shaking their heads in agreement. She then looked back to the others, as she began walking past them with the twins and Artoria following her, and waved her hand forward, ushering them to follow.\n\n“Come, there is something I must show you.”\n\nSo, they followed her as she led them back to the elevator. Once at the elevator doors, she waved her hand above the panel of sigils, causing a larger yellow sigil in the shape of a globe to materialize. She pressed it and the doors opened. They all walked into the elevator and watched as the doors closed. They began to ascend, only this time at a much faster rate that went on for over a minute.\n\nThe elevator finally stopped, and the doors opened. They now found themselves in a bright white domed chamber. It was mostly empty, except for several large bookcases, a number of unidentifiable machines, and a large statue depicting the Inventor located on the front wall. On the sides of the statue were large windows, revealing a beautiful starry sky, a cloud occasionally passing by, and a sea of lights at a far distance below. There was also a podium-like device made of irrilite and gold with a glass globe in the middle located in the center of the room.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/lost-utopia/Sky-View.jpg style=\"width: 625px; border: 8px solid #ffffff; box-shadow: 0 0 5px #999;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n“Where are we now?” Gwyneth asked.\n\n“This is the Grand Observatory.” Queen Áine answered.\n\n“This is a very special room, as only the Lady Titania herself and a select few, including myself and the twins have access to it.” Artoria followed up.\n\n“An Observatory? But I don’t see anything that looks like a telescope.” Halloran stated as he looked around the room.\n\n“It is not meant for viewing the stars above, as there are no real astrological bodies in the space Fata Morgana occupies.” Queen Áine said, as she approached the podium.\n\n“Then what is it for?” Rivera asked, sensing they were about to see something incredible.\n\n“I shall show you.” Queen Áine replied, as she stood in front of the podium. She proceeded to operate a small spherical device on the side of the podium that turned, twisted, and rotated much like a Rubik’s Cube. After several seconds, she squeezed it as it began glowing a pink light, and the globe in the center of the podium began pulsating and rippling brightly in vibrant colors. Suddenly, a beam of energy and a huge diamond shaped projection materialized before them from the crystal on the front of the podium. It appeared to be a holographic screen as an image began to form. An aerial view of a large urban city was shown on the projection.\n\n“That’s… that’s Philadelphia!” Rivera stated in surprise, recognizing the location.\n\nQueen Áine then tapped the globe and the image changed to another. This time a Russian city.\n\n“Moscow.” Asheworth stated.\n\nShe tapped the globe once again and the image changed to a beach with the city of Fata Morgana visible on the ocean’s surface.\n\n“Brzezno Beach, that’s where we came from.” Halloran stated, as he began putting the pieces together of the device’s functions. “This is a global surveillance system.”\n\n“You are indeed correct; this is the Eye of the Observer. It allows me to open a dimensional window that lets me view any location I desire. I am able to view anywhere above or below the surface of the Earth.” Queen Áine, stated as she changed the image again, now showing [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7600 an underground megalithic city with buildings made of metal and plants inhabited by millions of Yeren].\n\n“Those are Yeren. What is that place?” Asheworth questioned, in shock at the image.\n\n“This is Druv’tuul, ancient subterranean home of the Yeren that was founded after the Day of Flowers. I believe your organization already discovered it several decades ago.” Queen Áine stated.\n\n“They did? I mean Asheworth and I were vaguely aware of the existence of a Yeren city, but never had any confirmation from the O5.” Rivera stated in surprise.\n\n“I think it would be best if the three of us didn’t mention seeing this when we leave.” Halloran suggested to Asheworth and Rivera, worried at the idea of punishment for discovering information likely above their clearance levels.\n\n“Agreed.” They both said in unison.\n\n“Absolutely fascinating! If you do not mind me asking, can you put in these coordinates?” King Ragna asked, as he whispered something into Queen Áine’s ear.\n\n“Very well.” Queen Áine said, as she changed the image yet again. It was another underground city, appearing to be still in some stages of development and improvement populated by Droganians.\n\n“This must be your home. Arcadia you said it is called, yes?” Queen Áine asked King Ragna, as she admired the architecture and the many Droganians flying in the air.\n\n“Indeed, Lady Áine. I hope you do not mind the numerous signs of construction and renovation, my people just started progressing to a more developed society a decade ago, after getting over a millennia-long period of paranoia.” King Ragna replied.\n\n“Amazing! So, this thing can view anywhere on Earth?” Gwyneth asked, as she was baffled by such a technological marvel.\n\n“Indeed, my dear. It can view any location above the surface, below it or even within the ocean’s depths.” Queen Áine said, as she then changed the image to show what appeared to be an underwater [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/orcadia Finfolk] city settlement deep beneath the sea. “It allows me to see everything that is occurring in the world, whether it be the lives of humans, or of the many other races that still thrive today.”\n\n“Amazing, I don’t think even the GOC has technology like this.” Gwyneth said in astonishment.\n\n\"However, it is not limited to just Earth. It can also view neighboring pocket dimensions…” Queen Áine changed the image to a large highly developed city with amazing architectural structures that seemed to go on for miles.\n\n“That’s Three Portlands.” Gwyneth said.\n\nQueen Áine then changed the image to a city that Gwyneth, Asheworth, and Rivera knew all too well.\n\n“Esterberg…” Gwyneth said, as she was somewhat flattered that Queen Áine was familiar with her home.\n\n“…As well as separate dimensions.” Queen Áine stated as she changed the image to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2264 a regal non-euclidean city with a yellow sky with black stars].\n\n“This is indeed an incredible machine your highness. But considering what you told us you knew earlier, I’m guessing this machine is quite old.” Asheworth said, as he began to have an idea where Queen Áine was going with this demonstration.\n\n“You are correct. It has been used for eons by my ancestors to watch over the Earth. It was built a few hundred years after Fata Morgana vanished. Originally it was less powerful and could only view the Earth for a limited amount of time, but as we advanced over the millennia it was redesigned and modified into the device it is now.” Queen Áine stated, as she continued to shift the images to various locations.\n\n“Exactly… How much did you and your ancestors see with this, what events did you witness?” Rivera asked, as she was beginning to get the feeling that Queen Áine knew more than she was letting on.\n\nShe then turned back to them with a serious expression, one of an old soul that has witnessed much more than we could ever imagine.\n\n“We’ve seen more than enough. We witnessed the time of the Yeren as they ruled the Earth and built their towers of vines and roots, then watched as the relentless spirit of The Undoer manipulated you humans into rising up, burning their empire to the ground and stealing the title of rulers of the Earth. We witnessed your many ancient cultures and societies as they rose, prospered, then fell. We witnessed the first great war of magic, where [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/church-of-the-broken-god-hub the metallic empire that followed the metal lord of intellect] clashed with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/sarkicism-hub the benders of flesh and blood who praised their grand messiah who gained great power when they challenged the broodmare of flesh and infection]. We also watched when [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-pl-259 a descendant of Mab had set out to resurrect her empire and clashed with the kingdom of sorcerers who mastered the art of commanding thorns and roots soaked in the blood of their slaves].”\n\n“You and your ancestors witnessed many of ancient history’s greatest events, haven’t you?” Ashworth questioned Queen Áine.\n\n“We have, but not just of ancient history. We also watched, as out of fear and paranoia, your organizations of the shadows chose to isolate the magical world from your people, leading them to forget the past and letting most fade into myths or mere stories. We were watching as a nation, through the will of their power-hungry dictator, attempted to manipulate the laws of magic by seeking to re-create a being that would control the rules of human magic and bring it under their control, and saw as they failed and nearly led to you humans forever losing the chance to ever again experience the ancient arts.” Queen Áine stopped as she suddenly clenched her fists, and tears began to fall on her cheeks. “Then… I witnessed, when during the attempted siege on a black factory of pain and misery, many of my kind, many good Fae men, women and even children, were stripped of their identities and banished to **##green|a land where those who forgotten themselves forever wander##**. Friends lost, entire families torn apart… and they were unable to remember those that they wished to mourn.”\n\nThe room was quiet, except for the quiet rustling of Queen Áine’s gown as she fell to her knees and began to weep with regret, pity, and remorse for all the poor souls who perished or were lost both physically and spiritually that day.\n\nEveryone watched with somber faces, feeling empathy for the monarch, as they watched her wipe away the tears streaming down her face.\n\nRivera walked to Queen Áine, assisted her back up on her feet, and even helped wipe away her remaining tears.\n\n“I know you must feel terrible having to witness that. Nobody deserves to witness most of their kind disappear like that. I get the feeling you probably blame us for it. But you must understand, that was an accident and wasn’t even our doing. Mab, she—” Rivera was interrupted as Queen Áine held her hand up.\n\n“No, you are mistaken. I do not blame you, for I know it was Mab’s doing, through possession of one of your own. I do not hate you for what happened, because I know you did not mean it, and feel guilty for it, as I have seen your many attempts to make amends for the tragedy.” She then looked down to her feet as her somber expression returned. “In fact, the only person who should feel guilty is me. Because I could have saved them.”\n\n“So, why didn’t you? If you were aware of what was happening at the factory that day, then why didn’t you try to do anything to prevent the Third Diaspora?” Asheworth questioned, as he was confused about the queen’s lack of actions.\n\n“I tried, oh how I tried. The moment I saw what was occurring on the projection, and realized the presence that was buried underneath that horrible complex, I immediately rallied my entire armada and ordered them to prepare for our return to Earth to stand against the Undoer. I knew how to bring Fata Morgana back to Earth, since my family has passed on that knowledge for generations, since the time of Adresin and Ariel. But, by the time my army was prepared, and I was ready to perform the ritual… It was too late. We took too long, and we failed them.” Queen Áine was silent for several seconds, before her expression shifted to one of determination and commitment. “But I refused to give up! I may not have been able to help them before, but I am able to at least help them now!”\n\n“How?” Gwyneth asked, wondering how Fata Morgana could possibly help **##bf59bf|those of blank personas in the woods##**.\n\n“You already know the answer.” Erelynn said as she and Elewynn walked up to stand next to Queen Áine.\n\n“We do?” Rivera asked in confusion.\n\nAsheworth suddenly had a look of realization, as he looked upon the twins.\n\n“3903-A, the Otherkin.”\n\n“Yes. While I am aware of **##green|that land of green that is empty of itself##**, I sadly cannot simply pull **##bf59bf|its poor confused refugees##** out as long as they lack their names. However, I am not powerful enough to return their names to them while they are trapped there, nor do we have the technology to do so. Mab had gained enough power to have achieved partial divinity, a demi-god if you will. I realized they were stuck there until their names were returned, or until they perished. That’s when I had an idea, If I couldn’t save them in their current lives, then I could save them in their next one.” Queen Áine stated.\n\n“The next one? Like in the afterlife?” Rivera asked.\n\n“Not exactly. Through the Eye of the Observer, and the many ancient spells I had access to, I managed to get in contact with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-moons-initiative-hub The Prime After-Plain of the many realms where those who passed are sent to]. There, I made contact with the deities that govern it, for if a partial-deity can take away names, then surely a full deity can restore them. It was then I bestowed upon them a proposal. If they were to allow **##bf59bf|the lost ones who cannot recall their souls##** that perished to have their names restored, along with those who lost their lives from an unstoppable horrific calamity, and allow them to reincarnate, the people of Fata Morgana in return would praise and worship them as part of the many deities that we honor. They accepted this offer, and the deal was struck. But, as an extra measure of protection for them in this world govern under the bounds of what you call “Normalcy”, They would reincarnate as humans, and once they matured, we would send signals of influence which would unlock the memories of their previous life. We would then lead them to the shores where Fata Morgana would temporarily return, thus allowing them to enter the city. Once they entered the city’s walls, their memories would return along with their true names, and they would go through a metamorphosis and become Changelings, or as we have come to know them, Otherkin, thus being Fae once more.” Queen Áine stated, explaining the final mystery of Fata Morgana and of the Otherkin.\n\n“Reincarnation through divine intervention?! That’s… absolutely insane!” Gwyneth exclaimed, as she is overwhelmed by everything that she learned within the past hour.\n\n“Is that also why you guys know how to speak English?” Halloran asked.\n\n“It is indeed. We simply felt it would be better for all the reincarnated individuals who arrive here that we learn the languages of these modern times, instead of them learning the languages of old.” Queen Áine explained.\n\n“I’m guessing that vendor at the market was an Otherkin as well?” Asheworth questioned Artoria.\n\n“Yes, that is also why I asked you to hide your badges. Despite being manipulated by Mab, your Foundation was still heavily at fault for the Third Diaspora, thus not all Otherkin are forgiving toward your organization.”\n\n“I’m guessing that is why you two don’t show us hostility. You know it was Mab who took away your names.” Rivera said to the Levainn twins.\n\n“Oh, no no no. My sister and I were not victims of the Third Diaspora. We actually used to be elves from Hy-Brasil. We both perished when that beast brought the kingdom’s destruction.” Elewynn retorted. as she held her sister’s hand.\n\n“Wait! I just thought of something. What about those that managed to escape by stealing the names of someone else? Do you know and do something about them? Because we passed one of the parks getting here, and I saw what looked like a man with a rabbit head wearing a tuxedo. At first, I thought it wasn’t real, but after learning about the reincarnated Fae, something tells me it was.” Halloran exclaimed, realizing he forgot to mention it when they got to the Spire.\n\n“Oh, that must have been [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/taboo Japers]. Yes, you are correct. He did lose his true name and stole another’s to escape **##green|those gloomy forest trees##**.” Erelynn said as she rubbed the back of her head with an expression of pity. “But he promises to return it once he gets his own back!”\n\n“It is true. Those who stole another’s name and managed to return to your world, were allowed to take refuge here in Fata Morgana. For since they are no longer trapped within **##green|a domain of dull greenery and somber sunlight##**, we can help them restore their true names, and are currently seeking a way to do so.” Queen Áine stated, sounding full of hope.\n\n“Well in that case, my people and I will be more than happy to assist you. After all, the Fae back on Earth have been more than willing to help us Droganians, so I feel we should return the favor by helping you and **##bf59bf|the many victims of the Undoer’s sins##**. Speaking of which, I was hoping that you and I could discuss possible cooperations between our peoples. I’m sure there is much we could do for each other.” King Ragna suggested, as he held out his hand to Queen Áine in a gesture of friendship.\n\n“That goes the same for me and my friends here. I wish to learn everything you and the Changelings can tell me about your home and its customs, along with whatever secrets you may know about the Fae Empire. Whatever knowledge you share with us will be of great use to the Sidhe Lounge and Fae everywhere!” Gwyneth stated, excited and thrilled to learn whatever Queen Áine could provide her.\n\n“If you really are trying to help undo the mess that the Foundation unintentionally created with the factory, then let us help as well. We and the O5 created what we call Directive Alpha/1911 to atone for it, so even if some of the Otherkin may be against it, please let us work together to make a better world for everyone.” Asheworth said as he too offered his hand to Queen Áine. “I’m sure it is what she would have wanted.” He said, gesturing toward the statue in the room.\n\nQueen Áine gave them all a soft caring smile, as she took both King Ragna and Asheworth’s hands.\n\n“I know, and I humbly accept your willingness to help. However, I do have some conditions to this partnership.”\n\n“What will those be?” Captain Agron asked, as he stood next to King Ragna.\n\n“We shall discuss those at a later time. Until then, as a way to thank you for your willingness to aid us, I’d like us all to take some time to enjoy ourselves. There is so much Fata Morgana has to offer in regards to luxury and entertainment. I would like for you to have a chance to experience it for yourself. It is my offer.” Queen Áine said, as she gestured to the expansive city view, with a look of excitement and eagerness. “I would also like to hear some of the stories you may care to share. I may have watched many events through the Observer’s Eye, But I wish to hear you speak of them yourselves.\n\n“Also, I would like to have a friendly spar with Agron. I find your weapon fascinating. I can tell it is magical just like mine and am interested to see what it is capable of.” Artoria said to King Ragna, as she pointed towards Captain Agron and his weapon Astarot.\n\n“My sister and I would also like to know the current state of Hy-Brasil. While we have access to the observatory and the Observer’s Eye, we have just been too afraid to find out for ourselves. Our deaths are a touchy subject for us after all.” Elewynn said, as she and Erelynn looked to each other uneasily.\n\nAsheworth, Rivera, and Halloran glanced at each other for several seconds before they looked back to the Changelings.\n\n“Give us a moment.” Rivera said, as she and Asheworth gestured the others to group together as they took a moment to discuss Queen Áine and her companions’ requests.\n\nAfter a minute of few moments of discussion, they split and Asheworth walked toward Queen Áine.\n\n“Áine Lurline Tanaquill… we accept your offer.”\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/four-knights-tango/logosmall.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 22nd of March\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]], Częstochowa, Poland**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** overwatch.command.public@site.01.int\n**From:** d.asheworth@site.120.int\n**Subject:** Fata Morgana Alliance Proposal\n[[/div]]\n------\nOverseers,\n\nI am sending this message to inform you that the expedition into SCP-3903 was a success. Thanks to SCP-7629-ARTHUR accompanying my team, we were able to gain entry into Fata Morgana. Once in the city, we were fortunate to gather much information in regards to both the culture and thaumaturgical capabilities of the city, the Fae inhabiting it, and the purpose of the SCP-3903-A instances. I also wish to advise you we have managed to discover information we believe is of high importance. Attached is a documentation of all the information we’ve acquired within SCP-3903, as well as connected historical knowledge shared with us from Olivié Gwyneth.\nI must also inform you that the leader of SCP-3903 has agreed to a partnership between the SCP Foundation and the City of Arcadia. This partnership has been agreed upon under the following conditions:\n* Fata Morgana will remain partially outside of baseline reality until a time where it believes the world is [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/no-return-hub in a state suitable for its return]. However, the Foundation will have personal access to return to Fata Morgana through private and secure way-lines. The city of Arcadia will also be given access as part of the partnership between the Lady Titania Queen Áine Lurline Tanaquill and the Vajra King Ragna Von Morrowind.\n* Any thaumaturgical technology and materials, along with any historical documentation and artifacts the Foundation wishes to access must first be brought up to the Lady Titania’s court for approval.\n* Fata Morgana is to be granted Free Port status.\n* All Foundation personnel who wish to enter Fata Morgana must remove all identifying items showing their connection to the Foundation to prevent provoking any Otherkin who still show hostility towards the Foundation.\n* All reported instances of 3903-A are to be brought to Fata Morgana as soon as possible.\n* Any Eshu-entities which have managed to escape from **##green|The ever expansive plain of greenery##** through the theft of another entity’s name must be brought to Fata Morgana immediately for protection.\n* The Fae of Esterberg and the remaining inhabitants of Hy-Brasil will be granted safe means to travel to Fata Morgana, on the condition that the only means of travel are located within the aforementioned Free Ports, and for them to have security measures to prevent any possibilities of hostile entities entering the city.\n* Fata Morgana shall be allowed to research why all means to restore Hy-Brasil have failed thus far, and how to prevent future failures. They will also assist in restoration once a successful permanent process has been discovered. In addition, they will also be allowed to research means to restore the stability of the kingdom of Avalon.\n\nSincerely,\nDr. Daniel Asheworth, Site Director, Site-120\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** d.asheworth@site.120.int\n**From:** overwatch.command.public@site.01.int\n**Subject:** Re:Fata Morgana Alliance Proposal\n[[/div]]\n------\nDr. Daniel Asheworth,\n\nWe have reviewed the forwarded information as well as the alliance proposal and the terms of conditions set forth by the governing power of SCP-3903.\nIn regard to the many major benefits it offers to both the SCP Foundation and the success of Directive Alpha/1911, The O5 Council has chosen to agree to the conditions of the Lady Titania “hereafter referred to as SCP-3903-NU”, and authorize the partnership between the Foundation and the city of Fata Morgana.\nWe are looking forward to hearing back from you regarding the results of this alliance.\n\nSincerely,\nOverwatch Command, O5-5\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** City-Towers.jpg\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/34907359@N08/24370953033 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Lake-Fountains.jpg\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=94358254 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Lush-Park.jpg\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=77360325 Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Name:** Spire-Lobby.jpg\n> **License:** CC BY-NC-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/61683005@N00/3300475546 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** Sky-View.jpg\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/67069761@N06/8687954327 Flickr Image 1]\n> [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Starry_sky_at_Mount_Rinjani,_Lombok_island.jpg Wikimedia Commons Image 1]\n> [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mineral_moon_t%C3%B5rva.jpg Wikimedia Commons Image 2]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
