Dr. Webber should be permitted to continue working as a researcher, given that its health remains stable.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6441, known as Dr. Webber, is a sapient, unidentified member of the order //Anura// possessing a memetic effect that causes those who view it to believe that it is human. Prior to the discovery of its anomalous effects, SCP-6441 was seemingly unaware of its non-human characteristics.\n\nUpon discovery of its anomalous effects, subjects will become aware of many non-human characteristics of SCP-6441; however, its body will still appear human.\n\n**Addendum 6441-01:** Discovery\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Note:** The following log is a transcript of a multi-department meeting at Site-56. Dr. Juno Payne is known to have an unusually high level of memetic resistance.\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 12:16 04/20/2022]\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Is everyone here?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Juno's late again.\n\n**SCP-6441:** Who's Juno?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Y'know, tall, four eyes, kind of a bitch?\n\n**SCP-6441:** I don't think I do.\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Eh, we can get started without her. So-\n\n[Dr. Payne enters hurriedly.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Sorry, got caught up in...\n\n[A pause as Juno moves to take a seat.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** The fuck?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** What is it this time?\n\n[Dr. Payne points towards SCP-6441.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Why's there a frog?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Excuse me?\n\n**Dr. Payne:** A frog. Why is there a frog sitting next to me?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Ah, ha-ha, because Webber.\n\n**Dr. Payne:** No, dumbass. There's a frog right there!\n\n**SCP-6441:** Hey, guys?\n\n[SCP-6441 stares at its hands.]\n\n**SCP-6441:** I don't... think she's joking.\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** What do you mean?\n\n**SCP-6441:** I mean, she's not joking. These aren't... human hands. I don't...\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Aaand it's talking. Great.\n\n**SCP-6441:** Guys? I can't remember anything before 2018...\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Correct me if I'm wrong, but frogs take two years to reach adulthood, right?\n\n**SCP-6441:** That's... what I'm saying...\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Oh, that's why the table was so slimy!\n\n[Dr. Payne squints.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** You didn't know the frog was there?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** No, I mean-\n\n**SCP-6441:** //(quietly)// Oh god, I'm a frog.\n\n[END LOG, 12:20]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Interview 6441-01:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr. Juno Payne\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. John Meyers\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 08:39 04/21/2022]\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Thank you for coming.\n\n**Dr. Payne:** I mean, I didn't really have much of a choice.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** I suppose. Anyway, what happened during the meeting yesterday?\n\n[Dr. Payne shrugs.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Not much, really. Walked in late, saw a frog in the chair next to me. \n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Hm. Had you met Dr. Webber before, or was this your first time?\n\n**Dr. Payne:** First time.\n\n[A pause.]\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Webber's the frog, right?\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Yes.\n\n**Dr. Payne:** Yeah, first time.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** That'll be all, then. \n\n[END LOG, 08:41]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Interview 6441-02:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr. Aaron Frye\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. John Meyers\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 09:30 04/21/2022]\n\n**Dr. Frye:** I'm guessing this is about yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Yes. You know Dr. Webber somewhat well, correct?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Uh, yeah, other than the whole... frog thing.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Had you noticed any unusual characteristics before yesterday?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Kind of? I saw her eating bugs once, but I didn't think anything of it.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Is that all?\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Mm-mm. Sometimes, things she touches are slimy.\n\n[A pause.]\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Oh, and she always... sticks her hands in water? Like, she just sticks her hand in the glass. I've never seen her drinking it. Which, yeah, seems weird in hindsight.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** And none of these things seemed strange?\n\n[Dr. Frye shrugs.]\n\n**Dr. Frye:** Uh... not really. I just didn't really think about them.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** I see. Thank you for your time.\n\n[END LOG, 09:35]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Interview 6441-03:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** Dr. Bruce Stevens\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. John Meyers\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 10:33 04/21/2022]\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Dr. Stevens.\n\n[Dr. Stevens nods.]\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** You were responsible for hiring Dr. Webber, correct?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Yes. Seemed like a good fit.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Why's that?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** She's brilliant. Great with physics, which happened to be what we needed.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Did you run a background check?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** Mhm. We found nothing. Literally nothing. No background.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** And you hired her anyway?\n\n**Dr. Stevens:** I just... didn't think anything of it. Seemed normal for some reason.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Hm. Well, that's all I need from you.\n\n[END LOG, 10:35]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Interview 6441-04:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6441\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. John Meyers\n\n[BEGIN LOG, 11:31 04/21/2022]\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Dr. Webber. How are you?\n\n**SCP-6441:** I dunno. How'd you be if you found out you were a frog?\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** I'm sorry. This won't take long.\n\n**SCP-6441:** I- [sigh] great.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Before yesterday, were you aware of... your species?\n\n**SCP-6441:** No, I just said I wasn't.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** You didn't think anything of your odd behaviors?\n\n**SCP-6441:** Odd behaviors? Like what?\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Eating insects, absorbing water...\n\n**SCP-6441:** That's normal.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** That's not normal at all.\n\n**SCP-6441:** Oh... shoot.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Moving on, what's the earliest thing you can remember?\n\n**SCP-6441:** Uh, being alone, I think. I had... siblings. Something happened to them. I think, uh...\n\n[A pause. SCP-6441 squints.]\n\n**SCP-6441:** Some kids... did something...? I dunno. It's kinda fuzzy.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** What happened after that?\n\n**SCP-6441:** Um... a woman said something, and... I could think.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Could you not think before that?\n\n[SCP-6441 shakes its head.]\n\n**SCP-6441:** I didn't really have any thoughts before that.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** When did you enter human society?\n\n**SCP-6441:** Pretty soon after. I was in grad school.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** What about your lack of a background?\n\n**SCP-6441:** I dunno. I didn't really think anything of it.\n\n[A pause.]\n\n**SCP-6441:** I don't get it. How didn't I notice? //Why// didn't I notice?\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** Well, we think it's some sort of memetic-\n\n**SCP-6441:** No, I mean, if I knew, I could've done more. My time... must be running out.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** How would you have known?\n\n**SCP-6441:** I don't know. Whatever- whoever did this, she could've made it so I knew. I could actually do something to help if...\n\n[SCP-6441 sighs.]\n\n**SCP-6441:** I just... don't know how to deal with this. It's a lot, really.\n\n**Dr. Meyers:** I'm... sorry.\n\n[END LOG, 10:41]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 6441-02:** On 04/23/2022, SCP-6441 submitted the following note to Dr. Meyers.\n> I think I get it now. She just wanted me to have a good life.\nShortly after, SCP-6441 was cleared to continue its work as a researcher.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6440]]] | SCP-6441 | [[[SCP-6442]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
