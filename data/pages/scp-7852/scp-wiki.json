From 2002 to 2018, this office was used by Agent Claessen for assignments in the Netherlands.\n\nSCP-7852 contains a near-complete vacuum, capable of draining all batteries and power sources of electric energy on the premises.

Non-anomalous fire suppression measures were ineffective in subduing the fire. After initial shock subsided, it was noted that the fire did not cross the boundaries of the office space.\n\nDuring the fire, hereafter referred to as SCP-7852-1, all furniture and generic office equipment were destroyed.

Dubois’s office at Site 312. He looks tired, with a pale complexion and bags under his eyes.//\n\n//Dir. Dubois points to the chair in front of her desk.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** Take a seat.\n\n//Agent Claessen sits down.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** How are you, Jan?\n\n**CLAESSEN:** Good, good. I’ve almost finished outlining the new Field Agent training manual for Site 583, and I’m on track for this quarter’s containment reviews. I’ve also considered your proposal for redistribution of anomalous item containment at Site 312, but haven’t worked out the details yet. All in all, I’m on schedule for this year’s goals.\n\n**DUBOIS:** Glad to hear it. Is that why you requested this meeting?\n\n//Agent Claessen is silent for a moment.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** How are //you//, Jan?\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I’m fine. Could use a vacation, I guess. But don’t we all?\n\n**DUBOIS:** You don't need to go through me to request vacation time. But I’ve had some reports –\n\n**CLAESSEN:** [Defensively] Is there a problem with my work?\n\n**DUBOIS:** There isn’t a problem with the quality of your work, but I am worried about the toll it takes on you.\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I –\n\n//Agent Claessen looks away.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** I’ve noticed you’re a bit tense lately. Not just with me, but also with colleagues. Including a vocal altercation with Gijs earlier this month.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** I know he can be a little rough around the edges, but you don't usually let him get to you like that.\n\n//Agent Claessen is visibly struggling to get his words out. He looks down to the floor.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** We’re all just a little bit worried about you. //I’m// a bit worried about you. Is everything alright?\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I – I’m fine. I am fine.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I have it all under control.\n\n**DUBOIS:** I never doubted that.\n\n**CLAESSEN:** It’s just Site 312. No Keters, no big treats. We don’t even have D-Classes to monitor.\n\n**DUBOIS:** Jan –\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I can handle that. I can handle it!\n\n**DUBOIS:** Jan, I know. It’s okay.\n\n**CLAESSEN:** It shouldn’t be an issue. It’s goddamned Site 312, it’s not dangerous. It’s barely a joke. What’s the worst that can happen? A stoner getting a scare over an unscheduled coffee shop refill?\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**CLAESSEN:** It shouldn’t be an issue.\n\n**DUBOIS:** But it’s just a lot right now, isn’t it?\n\n//Agent Claessen gasps for air, and starts to sob.//\n\n**CLAESSEN:** It feels like I can’t breathe sometimes.\n\n//Agent Claessen sobs in silence for several seconds.//\n\n**CLAESSEN:** I can’t fail.\n\n//Agent Claessen starts to cry uncontrollably at this moment.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** You're not failing.\n\n//He grabs a tissue Dir. Dubois handed him.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** You’ve done decades of amazing work for the Foundation. Stressful work, often while underfunded, and you’ve done amazing things. I don’t know where I would have been without you. Now does that sounds like failing to you?\n\n**CLAESSEN:** [Quietly] I know..\n\n//He wipes the tears from his face.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** Wouldn’t it be nice to take some time off? A nice vacation with Jacqueline. Spend some time with the grandkids.\n\n//Agent Claessen nods while staring at the floor.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** Let’s do that. And in a couple of weeks, you and I are going to see what else you need.\n\n**CLAESSEN:** [Quietly] I don’t want to give up.\n\n**DUBOIS:** You’re not. You’ve given so much to the Foundation, it’s time we gave something back. Doesn’t that sound fair?\n\n//Agent Claessen nods again.//\n\n**DUBOIS:** Site 312 can survive for a while. You’ve made sure of that. Why don’t you go home early today?\n\n**CLAESSEN:** There is stuff I need to finish! I need –\n\n**DUBOIS:** Write them down. Make a list. I’ll make sure they get done, by me or the rest of the team.\n\n//Dir. Dubois sits down next to him as they compose a short list of tasks.

I don’t want them to see me like this.\n\n**DUBOIS:** As long as you need.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n-----\n\nFollowing this evaluation, Jan Claessen accepted 4 weeks of paid administrative leave, after which he started partial retirement. His current responsibilities cover auditing containment protocols of SCPs he contained during his tenure, and training new Field Agents.\n\nAlthough already qualifying for the Foundation retirement plan, Agent Jan Claessen requested to enter full retirement in mid-2019, stating a desire to oversee a full transfer of his responsibilities himself.
