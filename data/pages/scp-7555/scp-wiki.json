One end located in a specialized vacuum containment chamber within Area-12's Humanoid & Esoteric Containment Wing Theta (APT-Ω1), and the other located in close orbit of Sirius B, a main-sequence Type-A star located in the nearby Orion constellation (APT-Ω2). These connect to each other through conventional means, conforming to standard, non-anomalous cosmological models.

The dimensional condition of [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] oscillates irregularly between three (3) and four (4) spatial dimensions, often simultaneously displaying attributes of both; --believed to be remnant of its primordial formation conditions and subsequent dependence upon our universe's reality--.

Adverse universal hume conditions have been ruled out as a potential cause, with current theories suggesting the more likely possibility that natural, extra-universal forces beyond biological human conception were either partially or wholly at play.

And the order to utilize anomalous alternatives was canceled when it was calculated that sufficiently powerful installations would be incapable of spooling up in time to avert the impact.\n\nThe dire state of affairs necessitated an external call to aid. The Global Occult Coalition was contacted and informed of the unfolding incident and was provided clearance to liquidate the object despite its presence within mutually agreed-upon SCPF territory. Five (5) minutes later a launch was detected from the Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, with the projectile accelerating to an estimated 18.532% the speed of light before reaching the approximate location of [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]], disappearing from scopes precisely 00:01:22 before the object's impact with Earth.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]] appeared entirely unaffected by the launch, continuing on its calculated trajectory towards the Eastern United States.\n\n= //<Further neutralization attempts omitted.>//\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7555/path.jpg\n|caption=Path left in [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]]'s wake.\n|width=320px\n|align=left]]\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]] landed on the outskirts of the village of Bemis, West Virginia.

Footage from the expedition revealed several aspects of the parasite-universe and [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]] that could've previously only been theorized.\n\n----\n\nEarly footage by EXP-D6 captured an external view of one of [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]]'s stomachs, revealing the organ to be an apparent dead-end within the digestive tract despite clear prior observations to the contrary. The stomach is additionally noted to be significantly smaller in size compared to measurements taken previously within the organ, which extended far beyond the limits of what could physically be contained within its external dimensions. These conclusions suggest that the rest of [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]]'s digestive systems are located entirely within a non-euclidian space internally to their respective stomachs. This discovery foiled plans to attempt accessing organs deeper within the digestive tract through external entry.\n\nEXP-D7 was dispatched to explore the additional esophagi attached to the central digestive organ, finding each to extend further than could be physically explored by the drone on its limited charge. Deep field imaging of their vast distance yielded no sight of a terminator. This quality was noted on all esophagi connected to the stomach, including the esophagus which the expedition made its exit from within. EXP-D7 was sent back into the esophagus to measure the remaining distance to the stomach, finding its internals to be vastly contracted in comparison to the external dimensions.\n\nUltra-Deep Field images of [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] estimate the approximate age of the universe at a minimum of 300,000 years. However, most notably, cosmic background radiation imaging returned no signs of microwave radiation throughout [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] at any point in its history -- suggesting its formation conditions were not that of expansion from an initial state of high density and temperature. It is currently unknown whether or not the space within [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] is static, expanding, or contracting.\n\nThe source of [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]]'s seemingly omnipresent luminance has yet to be determined.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=100%\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7555/CMB.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The Cosmic Microwave Background of ITER-Ψ (hold to expand)\n]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n>  <system> ERROR.

This appears to be the true cause behind [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]]'s abnormal spatial activity. Rather than a parasite-universe attempting to adapt to the narraspatiotemporal state of its singular host, [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] is in actuality attempting to simultaneously adapt to two (2) hosts with incompatible dimensional states, resulting in significant spatial irregularities.\n\nRecent alterations of unknown origin within [[span class=\"st\"]]ITER-Ψ[[/span]] have resulted in [[span class=\"table5\"]][[span class=\"st\"]]EXIT-Θ[[/span]][[/span]] gaining dominant influence over the narraspatiotemporal state of the shared parasite-universe. The consequences of this power shift have yet to be fully determined, however, a primary aspect appears to be significant physiological alterations within [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]]. A new gravitational field has been detected moving from deeper within [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]] and outward towards the esophagus, in contrast to the graviton-field influencing 3-dimensional biological matter which moves in the opposite direction. This force however appears to only influence 4-dimensional ##transparent|not-##matter, which is now being detected in increased amounts throughout [[span class=\"bt\"]]OBJECT 5[[/span]].\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7555/simplex2.png\n|caption=Updated orthogonal projection of WAY-Ψ0's 5-polytope manifold aperture in an A,,4,, coxeter plane\n|width=280px\n|align=left]]\n\nWAY-Ψ0 has additionally seen a substantial increase in topological complexity (Schläfli symbol t,,0,1,2,4,,{3,3,3,3}).
