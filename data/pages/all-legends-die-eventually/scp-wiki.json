It is quiet, with the only sounds he hears are the occasional sound from the animals, and the running of a nearby river. It is a cloudy night, the only light in this forest coming from the full moon, illuminating the ground not under the canopy above.\n\nThis man is well-dressed, wearing a black tuxedo jacket and an office shirt underneath with a red tie in excellent condition. He ties his tie and combs his short black hair and his diamond-shaped beard afterwards. He also wears brown business shoes which make small thumping sounds as he walks on the mud, into the forest, knowing exactly where he needs to be.\n\nHe finds a red car, a car that has crashed, and has a young man dying, crawling on the ground. The nearly dead man is blonde with short hair and has cyan eyes. He has a slender body shape. The dying man knows who this man is, but not as a friend or family member, but as an anomaly.\n\nThis anomaly is a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4999 silent, formal man that visits you when you are dying alone, he stays with you until your death.] The dying man lets out a single tear under his left eye, then says “Somehow, I knew you would come. Just that calmness you know?” The well-dressed man nods; He neither smiles nor frowns, his face echoes out of the idea that he knew this was going to happen.\n\nThe dying man starts crying. \"So, this is the end. I'll never see my wife or children again.\" The visiting man nods in the same way that he did before. The crying man painfully takes off his tan coat and shakes it with his phone coming out of his pocket. \n\nHe continues, \"Listen, can you take my phone and call my wife? The password is 1-9-8-3, that's the year we got married. Her name is Mary.\" The visiting man walks over to the man dying with his back in his car. The hurt man's arms are dangling like ragdolls with his legs bending in unnatural directions making it obvious that they are broken or mangled in some way.\n\nThe urban legend does the man's favor, he grabs the man's phone, types in the password and enters the call app. He scrolls until he finds the name 'Mary.' The fancy man called her and placed the phone against the dying man's ear. The phone rings for a bit.\n\n\"Hello, this is Mary! I'm currently not available, please record your message after the beep!\" The voice was blissfully unknowingly cheerful. The phone then played a beep sound.\n\nThe dying man is still crying, \"Hello, this is your husband, Thomas! Listen... I won't come back. My car crashed, I called you, well, I tried calling you; this message is going to voicemail.\" \n\nThe voice of the man sounds panicked and calm at the same time, the man continues, \"I called you because, I know I won't make it. I didn't call 911 because I would die before they came. I just wanted to say... I love you. Please don't mourn my death for too long, I mean, we have 2 kids.\" The man's voice is now calm, despite his endless rush of tears.\n\n\"If you play this voicemail to kids, I want to tell them that I am sorry for what I did. I know that I was too harsh on them.\" The dying man raised his left hand painfully and slowly. The fancy man understood, he ended the voicemail and clicked 'send.' His eyes are now closed due to his lack of energy. \n\nWithout saying anything, he opens his mouth. Both the legend and the exhausted, nearly dead man knew what was coming next. \"Let me die with my first and last smoke. I know that there are two dying wishes I am giving you but I'm sure you've done more. Besides, this doesn't count right?\"\n\nThe fancy man lets out a small chuckle silently. He shuffles his hands through his coat's pockets, looking for something. Eventually, he finds what he is looking for, a pack of cigarettes. He opens the pack, grabs two and lights both of them on the nearby fire from the car crash. He then moves back near the car and sat to the left of the nearly dead man. He places one of the lit cigarettes into the dying man's mouth and then places the other into his. \n\nNo more words were exchanged. All you could hear was pouring of the rain, the cackling of the fire, sounds of nearby animals, and the squealing of the fire being extinguished by the rain. Eventually, the cigarette drops from the dying man’s mouth; It is no longer lit. \n\nThe well-dressed man stops his smoke, disposing of his cigarette into the fire. The noble man stood up and turned to move in the direction opposite of the now-dead man putting his hands in his pants’ pockets.\n\nI suddenly hear a gunshot, the sound being in front of me. Before I could react, it hit me in the chest. I hear some shuffling in the bushes in front of me, the man who shot me left. I look down at my wound. //I guess urban legends die too. Fatal wound.// I limped over to a nearby tree near the back of the dead man’s car and sat down feeling pain all the while. \n\n//Might as well think in the first-person, narrating my life in the 3rd person is a bit tiring. It doesn’t hurt to try something new. So… this is what it is like to die alone. Although, there is a dead man with me, are you truly alone if you're with a dead body being the person you just met? I feel truly sorry for his friends and family. I have lived a long life, has it been like what? I know it is at least 130 years. However long it has been, it's been a long time. At least I have felt the pain of the people I have visited; the people in the hospital, the people who died on the battlefield of WW2, who else… I guess this dead man is near me; The last person I'll visit. People who died without any friends or family were there when they died, except me. The one that is currently now feeling their pain. Man, the hospital, that was how The Foundation found out, good ol' security camera footage.//\n\nI hear a sound from the bushes on my left. I sigh, //I accept my fate. It was bound to happen sooner or later.// I see a well-dressed man; he is wearing a white suit and pants. I also see him wearing white slip-on shoes. He has long brown hair with it going down all the way down to his kneecaps. His green eyes pierce mine, making it obvious that he is the same as me.\n\nI try to chuckle but fail due to the fire's smoke making me cough instead. //You know what they say, history repeats itself. God truly runs out of ideas.// He shuffles through his suit's pockets, looking for something. I already know what and where it is. I waved at him with my right hand, painfully moving it to a pocket on the inside of my now unbuttoned tuxedo jacket. The pocket was on my left side. He walks over to me and squats down when he gets close to me. He takes the cigarette pack from my pocket and holds it out.\n\n//You’re welcome. I know that you don't have them. They never do the first time.// I smile in approval. He goes to the now raging fire, the only thing you can hear besides the impact of the branches hitting the dirt floor and the hissing sound coming from the fire coming in contact with the water; he grabs out a cigarette and holds it in my direction. I chuckle again. //Light it the same way I did for the dying man.// He holds out the end of the cigarette near the fire, lighting it. //Thank You.// He then moves over to me as I open my mouth slowly & painfully as he then slides the cigarette into it. The visiting person then does the same for himself.\n\nMy eyes are now closed due to the lack of energy. It’s now or never, my first and last words in my life. “Do me a favor ok? Keep the legend of the man who watches us alive,” I say out loud. \n\nI hear the crackling of the fire while I hear the last words of my life. “Of course. When one dies, another one takes its place.”\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=WatcherKatrielle]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
