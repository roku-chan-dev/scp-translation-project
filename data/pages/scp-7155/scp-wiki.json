The label on the container reads \"Unremarkable.\" The paint inside SCP-7155 is black and odorless. Any amount of paint removed is replenished upon closing the lid.\n\n[[module ListPages limit=\"1\" category=\"*\" order=\"updated_at desc\"]]\nSCP-7155 was discovered on 05/11/1955. Further anomalous properties remain unknown, pending further testing scheduled for %%updated_at|%d/%m/%y%%.\n[[/module]]\n\n**Addendum:** In the weeks following the initial documentation of SCP-7155, a series of edits and comments have been added to this file.
