Something went wrong. She checks her files again. \n\nA portion of the files for Knights of Terra are corrupted. Mostly files for indoors textures, models and scripts. She hears a deep voice ring over the loudspeakers of the building.\n\n\"Ms. Lancester, to the Manager's office. This is urgent.\"\n\nShe stands up from her office chair and swiftly walks towards the glass door used to exit her department.\n\nShe walks up the staircase covered in a big blue carpet, passes by the support department and enters the managers department. Her manager is sitting on his way too comfortable office chair.\n\n\"Did you notice already?\" Mr. Hunt spouts even before Sophie has a chance to just sit down.\n\n\"Just right now, yes. Listen, I myself don't know what happened.\"\n\nMr. Hunt sighs. \"We promised to release this game by autumn next year. Now, your bloody team fucks up and half of your files are corrupted.

She attempts to grasp for air, only to slowly lose control over her muscles. She quickly grabs into her pocket to get her inhaler. She takes it, puts it in her mouth and presses the orange button on the top. She feels her throat loosening up and takes in a lot of air. And so, she walks back to her office chair.\n\nShe exhales and opens private messages. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-start= --] ]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:discord-chat-source |inc-msg-start= --]\n|user-id=one\n|username=SophL\n|msg-time=Today at 3:01 PM\n]]\nHey.
