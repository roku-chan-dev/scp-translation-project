The reactor uses a primary sodium loop and a secondary high pressure water loop. This method must be re-evaluated annually. If energy transfer between the coolant system and SCP-6070 is no longer feasible using high pressure steam, the secondary coolant loop must be upgraded to a sodium loop without interrupting the energy supply to SCP-6070.\n\n[[span style=\"color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));\"]]If the temperature in SCP-6070's containment chamber drops below 20 °C, the site's reactor thermal output must be increased to compensate. The thermal output required to keep SCP-6070 stable is expected to rise indefinitely.[[/span]]\n\nIf the reactor approaches its physical limits due to increased energy demand, more reactors must be constructed and coupled with SCP-6070. This method is believed feasible until 27.02.2093, at which time SCP-6070 is to be coupled to itself to increase energy supply. At present, it is unknown which technical and anomalous modifications are necessary to achieve this. Researchers are tasked to find a solution to this problem until 27.02.2093.\n\nBeginning on 09.03.2093, all messages received through SCP-6070 from the past must be answered. All messages received from the future which are intended for the past must be relayed.\n----\n\n+++ Description\nSCP-6070 is a permanent heat sink that is at present removing approximately 230 MW thermal energy from its surroundings. Unmitigated, this poses a serious risk for the surrounding countryside and local climate. It is expected that the power demand of SCP-6070 will rise indefinitely, severely endangering its environment if not supplied with an equal amount of thermal energy.\n\n[[span style=\"color: rgb(var(--basalt-sub-text-color));\"]]SCP-6070 was an experimental anomalous rocket thruster designed for deep space missions. It was built by Foundation researchers in 1991 and tested for two years before arriving at the conclusion that it didn't work as intended.\n\nIn 2093, an unknown entity designated GOI-6070 will begin siphoning energy from the system through unknown means. The time loop within SCP-6070 leads to a thermal flow into the device in present day. This thermal flow is not subject to the laws of thermodynamics and will continue virtually indefinitely.[[/span]]\n\n----\n+++ Addenda\nBefore Incident 6070/3, a strategy was formed on how to approach decommissioning SCP-6070 without alerting GOI-6070 about the intended procedure. Since the research team including Site Director Schönfelde were already infected with a memetic agent that prevented them from participating in decommissioning, the issue had been escalated to Overwatch Command.\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[div class=\"overwatch\"]]\n[[div class=\"document_content\"]]\n+ Overwatch Command\n+++ Proceedings: SCP-6070\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6070\n**Purpose:** Threat Escalation by RAISA\n**Classification:** Level 6: Cosmic Top Secret\n**Protocol fidelity:** Summarized. Interjections and chatter omitted. Paraphrasing.\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10:** Having read the provided documentation about SCP-6070, I am sure each of you considered several theories about the problem at hand. We have to consider the possibility that the GOI is being truthful about it being the Foundation. We also have to consider the possibility that the GOI is another entity that is in possession of SCP-6070 and related documentation. Furthermore, the research team is currently unable to proceed with decommissioning of SCP-6070 for reasons not revealed to us. RAISA was quite adamant that we cannot know why.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-6**: It is either an anomalous effect preventing them or a memetic agent. Considering that escalating the subject to us in case of an anomalous effect is rather useless, I discern that it probably is a memetic effect that requires our ignorance.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10:** Agreed. However, this presents a new challenge: Assuming RAISA and Site 54 want us to finish the decommissioning, how are we going about that without exposing ourselves to the memetic agent?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-4:** Predictions are that we are capable of containing the object for about 100 years. We just send an MTF to dismantle it blindly. If that fails, we instruct the research team to debrief them, and try again until we find a way to properly shield an MTF against the memetic effects. Audible, olfactory, any combination etc.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-6**: This only works if the GOI neither is the Foundation nor has access to our documents. If one of those conditions is not met, they will know which MTF got deployed and when. If it is a memetic agent that hinders decommission, and they know when we strike, they can just adapt to our deployment.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-4**: Yes, but it is worth a shot. If one of those conditions is true, it fails, but then we will know.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10**: We won't. Since we are withheld information, we cannot know why the MTF failed. So we cannot discern if they failed because the GOI reacted, or if they were hindered by memetic effects.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-3**: Assuming this, we can never definitively know the outcome of any action. Whatever we do, even a slight paper trail is enough if we are our own adversary. If this council is involved, even knowing that this meeting happened at some point suffices to prevent any action from taking place. So even if we do everything in person, and leave no digital or paper traces, just the knowledge that we held this meeting will be enough to stop us. We can't even use Alpha-1, since our future selves would know and prevent it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-6**: While this is correct, it is beside the point. If this council is involved in the energy drain through SCP-6070, then we must not interfere. Whatever our future version does, we must assume that it is done in the interest of the Foundation Charter. So if we do something that does not leave a paper trail and still fail, we must assume that we should not interfere with SCP-6070. The only condition for our action must be, that we can differentiate between failure induced by GOI-6070 and failure induced by any present memetic agent.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-3**: In this case I propose an unconventional solution. Since we must prevent a paper trail within the Foundation, and we cannot know for sure who gets exposed to whatever memetic agent is affecting SCP-6070 nor if the memetic agent is capable of leaking information to GOI-6070, I suggest we alter the documentation of SCP-6070 entirely and then leak it to the Coalition. We make it an easy catch for them, provide them with just enough information, so they know what they are getting into. If they succeed, we have decommissioned the anomaly. Best case. If they fail silently, we know it was a memetic effect that hindered them, and we can try something else. If they fail loudly, we know that our adversary knew about this meeting and can worry about what SCP-6070 is actually doing.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-6**: Why use the Coalition? We can just use D-Class for that. We don't keep track of their assignment anyway, so this doesn't leave a paper trail.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-3**: Because D-Class aren't trained in decommissioning anomalies that fight back with memes. And also because we cannot know for sure who is affected by the meme and who isn't. What if the memes are contagious? If they spread across departments, they will indubitably infect D-Class. By using the Coalition, we have an outsider that cannot be affected before they strike, and we don't have to generate a paper trail to get outside forces in.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-4**: How do we prevent reports about the raid in case of silent failure? If they go in, fail, and leave again, we still have to prevent any and all paper trails, otherwise our adversary still knows what we are up to.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-3**: We move SCP-6070 off-site and leave it attended only by minimal personnel. We assign only D-Class, pre-amnestize them to prevent them from remembering anything after their shift, and since we barely keep track of D-Class assignments anyway, no connection between SCP-6070 and their assignment is possible. We keep tabs on one of the D-Class to know if the Coalition was there, and otherwise we will just sit and wait.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10**: This could work. We assign them outside the building, so they are not exposed to SCP-6070 at any time, and we do not arm them, so they cannot interfere with the Coalition. Should the Coalition decide to capture them, the amnestics will ensure secrecy.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-4**: What about the research team? If we go in and change all SCP-6070 documentation to some made-up anomaly that is sufficient to bait out the Coalition, they might have one or two questions about that.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10**: I trust Jones to keep them on a leash. This whole operation hinges on us not knowing whatever prevents them from decommissioning SCP-6070, so Jones will do her best to keep it that way.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-6**: What are we changing the anomaly into?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-3**: Something mundane but irresponsible. Something that will seem like an easy target for the Coalition. Something that sounds like we are overstepping our boundaries and using anomalies in a dangerous and unpredictable way. We include all safety warnings, so they don't accidentally blow up 1950, but don't put any more safety guards in place, so they simply have to intervene. Then we leak the documentation to some sleeper we know about. I'm sure in the Department of Personnel Affairs they know somebody that we can use for that.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"proceedings\"]]\n**O5-10**: So it is a vote.\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Voting Results:** 4 in favor, 0 against, 9 absent.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe results of this meeting were followed by incident 6070/3, thus Overwatch Command held a second meeting. Proceedings of this meeting are omitted. The draft version of the SCP-6070 document which the research team was using during the Decommission attempt by Overwatch Command was locked, and SCP-6070 was reclassified as Neutralized. The following memo was sent to RAISA and subsequently attached to this iteration of SCP-6070 documentation.\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[div class=\"overwatch\"]]\n[[div class=\"document_content\"]]\n+ Overwatch Command\n+++ Notification about Reclassification\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6070\n**Object Class:** Neutralized\n\nDear Ms. Jones,\n\nI sent this memo on behalf of Overwatch Command. As you were surely informed by the SCP-6070 research team, we have reclassified SCP-6070 as Neutralized. It still requires containment, but we consider the Decommissioning a success.\n\nYet, we require another measure to finalize the SCP-6070 containment procedures. However, the Council is of the opinion that this matter should remain classified information and thus cannot be relayed to the SCP-6070 research team. We therefore entrust you with performing the necessary procedure.\n\nAttached to this memo you will find an encrypted file containing a linguistic cognitohazard. Don't worry, it has been carefully designed to target GOI-6070 operatives in the future, so you can safely handle it. The Council wants you to send this meme through SCP-6070 at the nearest convenience. We are aware that the ongoing construction of the nuclear reactor outlined in the new SCP-6070 containment procedures might impede your attempts at sending a classified message. We trust you will do so no later than at the end of construction work.\n\nThe meme forces the future party to send a reply. Once they do so, please classify it as O5-only and attach it to the SCP-6070 documentation.\n\nWith best regards,\n\nO5-3.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe memetic agent was sent in December 1994, after construction of the designated nuclear reactor for SCP-6070 had been completed. After two years, instead of an answer, GOI-6070 instructed Foundation personnel to change the transmission mode to a fully binary protocol. After this had been implemented, GOI-6070 sent a new iteration of SCP-6070. Against O5 instructions, the document was classified Level 4 (Secret) and a warning of infohazardous infection was added.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6070/offset/4|Proceed to new iteration]]]",
