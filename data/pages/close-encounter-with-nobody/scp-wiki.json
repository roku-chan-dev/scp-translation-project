Cold out here. Where are they?\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nSaw the following UFOs:\n* Black sphere with long tail.\n* four-winged craft with plated surface.\n* oblong with pyramid on top.\n* One that resembled a rose.\n* lights, 24 of various sizes\n* disk shape with turbine beneath it\nSome interdimensional possibly? Be nice to obtain one.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nSee deliverers. Nice ship.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nGot package. Deliverers were well-mannered. English was a bit off but OK.\n@@ @@\nAlso I can see UIU agents in distance watching. I'm acting like I can't see them. Fools. See faint red, definitely have a camera and recorded my transaction.\n@@ @@\nWill intercept them.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nDestroyed evidence and applied amnestics (__NOTE:__ get more).\n@@ @@\nUIU agents still incompetent. Good.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nPackage warm and light despite being large. Opened it and got the goods. Five bars of Alloy 7 [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-148 (compare with Prometheus Lab synthesized ver.)], 3 bars of Mekhanium, and 1 cylinder containing anti-matter (half for Lefty, owe him).\n@@ @@\nWill be useful at my lab and I could use the Mekhanium to repair some old tech I found.\n@@ @@\nFirst I will be staying at a motel. I am tired.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nAn interesting event occurred last night.\n@@ @@\nI was abducted by mechanical entities with a cephalopod appearance. They had blasted me from the motel into their ship. Called themselves \"the Children of Mekhane\" (they even called themselves as Servants too interchangeably. Overall, Mekhanites.) and interrogated me for the Mekhanium. It was stated as \"stolen\" and I was able to see the mangled remains of the deliverers. Poor guys.\n@@ @@\nThey planned to torture me, but as I was left unattended I escaped.  I traversed the ship and found that we were high in the sky. I had to return for the materials were camouflaged in my motel room. Foundation agents could have already been snooping around the area.\n@@ @@\nAs a somewhat of a diversion and way to get down, I crashed the ship. Had to fend off the Mekhanites though (ET weapons are great and must take to Lefty. Need to make ammo). Obviously, I survived the crash but lost my left arm. Regeneration always stings for severed limbs.\n@@ @@\nSo made it back and recovered the items. Foundation agents were few, and most went to crash site. Long night.\n@@ @@\n--I need a drink.--\n\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
