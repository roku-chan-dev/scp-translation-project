This thing was a sort of dramatization of a little research disaster that happened in July four years back. It was meant to illustrate to some of our less cautious researchers the value of emotional detachment during the job, or some BS like that. Never really got produced, and no, I don't know why not. It's missing the a bit of narration that was meant to go in before and after the thing played. If I remember correctly, just details about the event. I think that it was something about this being written from live video feed, with creative liberty taken only when necessary. I found what I could about the incident, and it seems to match pretty well. Apparently the SCP was destroyed by the girl afterward, which is one reason they got worked up about it enough to start making this thing... I guess someone wanted to use it for questioning the dead or something. Since the research was never completed and the thing got burned, there's no official entry in the database on it. The guy's name matches the other stuff I've found, but the girl's name is only here - I guess they didn't want anyone to find out what happened to her. Seeing as she destroyed a potentially useful SCP after making a rather serious mistake in studying it, I can see why they might not want that to appear in a human resources type video. I can keep digging for more, if you'd like, but I can't make any promises.\n - J.N.\n\np.s. - Dinner, Saturday.\n\n*Click click click tap*\n*Beep*\n\n-*-*-*-*-*\n\nACT I\n\nFADE IN\nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nA small room with a medium-sized bed and two chairs. There are two doors, on either side of the room (One leads to a small bathroom, the other to a hallway). Everything is white and sanitary.\n\nA MAN is sitting on the bed. He is holding tightly on to a book. He is in mid teen years, and is wearing clean white hospital clothes.\n\nTwo researchers are standing in the hall. One is MASON, an early middle-aged man, the other is HOLLY, a woman also in early middle age. Both wear lab coats.\n\nANGLE ON HALLWAY.\n\nHOLLY\nWell, Mason, you got the tickets?\n\nMASON\nOf course I do, Hol. Vacation in Vienna. Two months. I promised, didn’t I?\n\nHOLLY\nGod, I’ll be glad to see the back of this place. When do we leave?\n\nMASON\nFriday. We just need to finish the interview, see what makes him tick. And he’s a safe class, so we can take it easy.\n\nHOLLY\nI don’t think I’ve ever had this much go right before, honey.\n\nMASON and HOLLY grip each other's hands briefly, then open the door to the MAN’s room.\n\nANGLE ON MAN, looking up.\n\nMAN\nPlease, why am I here? Why won’t anyone tell me?\n\nMASON\nSir, we just need to ask you a few questions. After that you can go home.\n\nMAN\nWhy?\n\nWIDER ANGLE ON ALL CHARACTERS\n\nHOLLY\nWe think you may have some knowledge about a recent accident, and we just need to know a few things about you.\n\nMAN\nWhat do you mean, accident?\n\nHOLLY\nSir, just answer the questions. Then, you can go home and just forget about all of this. Now, what’s your name?\n\nMAN\nHow can you have me here if you don’t even know my name?\n\nMASON\nPlease, sir, this is just protocol. Now, answer the question.\n\nMAN\nMy name is Esteban Tetson.\n\nMASON takes out a notepad and begins writing in it.\n\nANGLE ON MAN\n\nMAN (CONT.)\nMy parents were migrant workers from Chiapas, Mexico. They changed their last names when they acquired US citizenship. Esteban means crown, and has etymological connections to English names such as Steven and Stephen.\n\nMASON stops writing, and both HOLLY and MASON look at the MAN.\n\nMASON\nSir, where did you receive your education?\n\nMAN\nI didn’t. My parents were very poor. I learned English mostly from the other boys my age. I didn't learn to read and write until I was a teenager.\n\nMASON\nYou don't seem to be having any difficulties. You don't even have an accent.\n\nMAN\nI wouldn't know.\n\nMASON shrugs, and starts writing again.\n\nHOLLY\nWhy don't you tell us about that book?\n\nMAN\nThis is my diary. I've kept it ever since I was a kid.\n\nHOLLY\nI thought you said that you didn't learn to write until you were a teenager.\n\nMAN\nI didn't.\n\nHOLLY\nBut then how did you keep a diary?\n\nMAN\nYou're wasting my time with this. Please, just let me go home now.\n\nMASON\nSir, please just tell us how you kept a diary before you learned how to write.\n\nMAN\nWhy won't you believe me? Have you never heard of someone keeping a diary before?\n\nHOLLY AND MASON share a glance.\n\nMASON\nSir, those are all the questions we needed to ask for now. I suggest you get some sleep. We'll be back tomorrow.\n\nMAN\nBut...\n\nANGLE ON HOLLY AND MASON leaving. CLOSE ON THE MAN sitting briefly, then lying back, gripping the diary to his chest.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nEND ACT I\n\n-*-*-*-*-*\n\nACT II\n\nFADE IN\n\nResume. OVERHEAD SHOT OF MAN lying down, asleep, still gripping the book. HOLLY and MASON are out in the hall, talking. MASON has a carrying case.\n\nTWO SHOT ON HOLLY AND MASON\n\nHOLLY\nThink it's him or the book?\n\nMASON\nDunno yet. I had the team pick up some memorabilia from Esteban Tetson's family, and ask whether he kept a diary. They didn't remember. I mean, it's been a while.\n\nHOLLY\nI hate this part.\n\nMASON\nYeah.\n\nHOLLY\nMaybe, after this is done, we could just stay in Vienna. You know, forget this place. Move on. Find some safe and enjoyable employment in hard manual labor.\n\nMASON\nI wish that was still a joke. You know we can't.\n\nHOLLY\nYeah.\n\nTWO SHOT as they hug briefly, then walk over and OPEN the DOOR. At the SOUND OF IT OPENING, the MAN immediately sits up, fully awake.\n\nWIDE ANGLE ON ALL CHARACTERS\n\nMAN\nPlease, just tell me when you'll let me go. I have children.\n\nMASON\nAh, good. That's the topic I wanted to start on.\n\nMASON and HOLLY sit down. MASON takes out his writing utensils.\n\nANGLE ON MAN\nMAN\nWhat? Why do you need to know about them? Has something happened?\n\nTWO SHOT ON MASON AND THE MAN\n\nMASON\nNothing has happened, sir. This is just protocol. Now, please, just play along for a little bit longer.\n\nMAN\nFine. Fine, I don't care, I just want this over quickly.\n\nMASON\nHow many children do you have, and what are their names?\n\nMAN\nTwo daughters. Celia and Chicha.\n\nMASON\nHow old are they?\n\nMAN\nCelia is twenty, Chicha is fourteen.\n\nMASON\nAnd how old are you?\n\nMAN\nForty-five. I was born in 1958, just after my parents immigrated. I was born at seven thirty-two in the afternoon on Wednesday, April twenty-seventh. There were no complications during birth, and I weighed exactly six pounds.\n\nCLOSE ON MASON'S HAND when he stops writing. MASON and HOLLY look at the man.\n\nMASON\nWhy do you do that?\n\nMAN\nDo what?\n\nMASON\nTell us so much about yourself. You did it yesterday, when we asked for your name. And if you were poor, how do you know your exact time of birth and your weight at that time?\n\nWIDE ANGLE OF ALL CHARACTERS, FAVORING THE MAN\n\nMAN\nPlease, if you must ask me questions, don't make them like that. I'm being questioned, and I don't even know where I am. I don't feel like joking.\n\nMASON\nCan you please just answer the question?\n\nMAN\nWhy should I answer the question, when it's so obvious and unnecessary?\n\nMASON begins to speak again, but HOLLY puts a hand on his arm, and he stops.\n\nHOLLY\nWe're sorry for upsetting you, but this is just protocol. We'll leave that question for later. I think that for now we have something to show you.\n\nMASON begins unpacking the bag. He takes out a small photo album and a mirror.\n\nMAN\nHow did you get that? Why do you have my photographs?\n\nHOLLY takes the photo album from MASON, and opens it.\n\nHOLLY\nSir, just answer our questions. After that, we'll answer yours. Now, where was this picture taken?\n\nMAN\nI was on vacation in Vienna with my family. It was hard, but I had saved enough to go. That was three years ago.\n\nHOLLY quickly turns the page of the album, points randomly.\n\nHOLLY\nThis one?\n\nCLOSE ON PHOTOGRAPH OF UNFAMILIAR MAN, WOMAN, AND TWO GIRLS, IN FRONT OF A GARAGE.\n\nMAN\nThat's us in front of the garage where I work. We took that two years ago.\n\nHOLLY\nThis is you in the middle?\n\nMAN\nYes, of course.\n\nMASON holds up the mirror. WIDER ANGLE TO INCLUDE MIRROR. The MAN can be seen in the mirror. There is no similarity between the man in the photo and the man on the bed.\n\nMAN\nWhy are you doing that?\n\nHOLLY\nDo you see any differences between the man in this photo and yourself?\n\nMAN\nNo, of course not.\n\nHOLLY\nOf course.\n\nANGLE ON CHARACTERS\n\nMASON\nSir, you are a teenager. Look at yourself. You are not forty-five. You are closer to fifteen. Your name is not Esteban Tetson, Esteban Tetson died while you were in elementary school. You are Jon Eois. You live with your parents, Kip and Janice. You have never been outside the United States.\n\nMAN\nI don't know why you have me here, and I will not answer any more questions until you explain what this is about. I know who I am. I know exactly who I am, and I am tired of these jokes.\n\nMASON\nI see.\n\nTWO SHOT OF MASON AND HOLLY repacking the bag in silence, leaving the mirror. They walk to the door, but HOLLY stops and turns.\n\nHOLLY\nDo you remember how you found that diary?\n\nThe MAN does not answer. POV of the MAN watching the researchers exit, then looking back at the mirror. It shows Esteban Tetson holding the diary. CLOSE ON MIRROR.\n\nCUT TO HALLWAY\n\nTWO SHOT OF HOLLY AND MASON, STANDING AT THE WALL ACROSS FROM THE ROOM.\n\nHOLLY\nI think it's the book. He's too fixated on it, too illogical about it.\n\nMASON\nJust be glad he's safe to work with. We'll grab the book tomorrow, run some tests. I just want to see this thing filed and gone.\n\nA MEDICAL GURNEY ENTERS at the far end of the hallway, being rolled by another researcher. It is steadily rolled towards HOLLY, MASON, and the camera. HOLLY AND MASON watch it approach.\n\nHOLLY\nMason?\n\nMASON\nYeah?\n\nHOLLY\nWhy'd I have to come here to meet someone?\n\nTHE GURNEY reaches HOLLY and MASON.\n\nMASON\nBecause the universe has a really weird sense of humor.\n\nTHE MAN SCREAMS from OFF SCREEN. HOLLY AND MASON jump in surprise, and run for the door. The GURNEY WHEELER does not react, and continues to move.\n\nANGLE ON DOOR. HOLLY OPENS IT, but the view begins to fade as soon as she does.\n\nFADE OUT\n\nEND ACT II\n\n-*-*-*-*-*\n \nACT III\n\nFADE IN\n\nRESUME. TWO SHOT HOLLY AND MASON ENTERING THE HALLWAY. MASON is holding a CELL PHONE.\n\nHOLLY\nIt figures, doesn’t it? We finally get an easy subject, and this happens\n\nHOLLY AND MASON stop walking outside the door.\n\nMASON\nWe’re just lucky, Hol. At least we’re not on statue duty.\n\nHOLLY shudders.\n\nMASON (CONT.)\nAt least he died quickly.\n\nHOLLY\nThat really isn’t very comforting.\n\nMASON\nNo, I guess not. But we have to figure out how his body affected our lovely little ticket to Vienna. It’s procedure.\n\nHOLLY\nI know, honey. I’m just sick of this. Every day someone’s careless and there’s another body to deal with. It didn’t use to bother me that much, but now…\n\nHOLLY reaches for MASON’S hand.\n\nHOLLY (CONT.)\nNow, every day I think the body’s going to be you.\n\nMASON\nI know. We shouldn’t be here anymore.\n\nHOLLY\nNo choice.\n\nMASON\nI know.\n\nTHE CELLPHONE BEEPS. MASON hits a button on it.\n\nMASON (CONT.)\nHe's awake. Let's go.\n\nHOLLY AND MASON kiss, then walk to the door.\n\nANGLE ON MAN, looking at the door as it opens and HOLLY AND MASON ENTER.\n\nMAN\nFinally. Holly, Mason, I'm fine. I have no idea how, but I'm fine. Now can I please go home and get some rest?\n\nWIDEN ANGLE to show all characters.\n\nMASON\nWe've told you before, sir. Once we're done asking you questions, you can go.\n\nMAN\nWhat on earth are you talking about?\n\nMASON\nWhat do you-\n\nHOLLY\nMason, how did he know our names?\n\nHOLLY AND MASON pause.\n\nANGLE ON MAN\n\nMAN\nWe've worked together for five years. Now stop joking around.\n\nMASON takes out his writing pad, and begins scribbling furiously. He does not look up when he talks.\n\nMASON\nWhat, if anything, do you know about the men Esteban Tetson and Jon Eois?\n\nMAN\nWhat? Why?\n\nMASON\nJust answer the question.\n\nMAN\nI've never heard the names before. Now can you please explain what's going on here?\n\nMASON\nWhat about that book you're holding?\n\nMAN\nMy diary? I've kept it ever since I was a kid.\n\nMASON\nYou bring it to work?\n\nMAN\nOf course I do.\n\nMASON\nIn spite of the restrictions on personal belongings we may bring on site?\n\nMAN\nI don't see the relevance.\n\nMASON\nNo, of course not. Holly, restrain him. I want to try something.\n\nWIDEN ANGLE\n\nTHE MAN acts surprised and confused. He attempts to defend himself, but HOLLY easily overpowers him. MASON forcefully takes the diary from him. THE MAN begins to SCREAM.\n\nMASON (CONT.)\nPut him in the bathroom and lock the door.\n\nCAMERA FOLLOWS as HOLLY drags THE MAN to the bathroom and pushes him in, then shuts the door and presses a button on it.\n\nMASON (CONT.)\nHe, or they, displayed an obsession with the book, a fear of separation from it. If I'm right, the effect should end after a bit of time alone.\n\nCAMERA CUT TO BATHROOM, with the MAN on one side of the screen and a mirror on the other. The mirror shows the reflection of another researcher.\n\nTHE MAN begins to cough, growing steadily louder throughout the conversation. MASON AND HOLLY can be heard talking as if they were in the room.\n\nHOLLY\nHoney, I don't like this. We shouldn't do tests without approval from higher up.\n\nMASON\nThat takes too long. I want to leave tomorrow. Hell, I want to leave right now. I don't want to talk to someone who believes they're a dead friend of mine. That's just too much.\n\nTHE MAN begins to pound against the door, still coughing.\n\nHOLLY\nWe can't afford to be careless, not now.\n\nMASON\nI'd rather take a risk than keep hearing that thing talk.\n\nTHE MAN GASPS AND COLLAPSES. HOLLY AND MASON notice the absence of noise.\n\nMASON (CONT.)\nThere. Let's go check.\n\nTHE DOOR OPENS, HOLLY AND MASON STANDING in it. MASON is holding the diary. HOLLY rushes to THE MAN'S side. She puts her hand on his chest, and her ear to his mouth.\n\nHOLLY\nNo heartbeat, no breathing. He's dead.\n\nMASON looks down at the body.\n\nMASON\nWhere am I?\n\nHOLLY turns toward MASON. The mirror shows an exact copy of JON EOIS standing above his own body, in MASON'S place. He is gripping the diary.\n\nCAMERA CUT TO BLACK\n\nEND ACT III\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
