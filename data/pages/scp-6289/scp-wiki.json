Access to SCP-6289 requires Level 5 clearance and must be approved by at least two members of the O5 Council. If any personnel encounter a file protected by SCP-6289, they are to immediately shut down their computer, unless the password was given to them by a supervisor.\n\nSCP-6289 is only to be inserted into folders including files with Level 5 clearance or higher. Testing the limits of SCP-6289's anomalous properties is --ongoing-- prohibited.\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{**DESCRIPTION** }}\n[[/=]]\n-----\nSCP-6289 is a file titled \"priest.exe\", appearing as a 4.8 MB executable file. The file's icon resembles a priest standing atop a pillar in an empty room. When SCP-6289 is placed within any folder, the folder itself and all files within become password protected. Attempts to bypass the password prompt have proven unsuccessful through all known means, including brute force trials, reverse engineering, and any form of software manipulation.\n\nSCP-6289 demonstrates limited knowledge of its surrounding environment but is capable of textual communication through anomalously altered interfaces such as text editors.\n\nThe password prompt generated by SCP-6289 is a black screen with a blinking cursor. The text \"THE WIZARD\" is displayed at the top of the screen, accompanied by the phrase \"ENTER WIZARD COMMAND\" centered below it. The person who placed SCP-6289 into a folder is able to freely select its password.\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6289/COMMAND|caption=SCP-6289's command prompt.|width=250px |align=left]]\nIf an incorrect password is entered, SCP-6289 initiates a series of anomalous effects within the user's computer or to the user themselves.[[footnote]] The host computer is unaffected in remote cases. [[/footnote]] The exact nature of these effects varies but most commonly includes the following.\n\n* Increased CPU and GPU usage, leading to overheating and potential damage.\n* Manipulation of the computer's hardware, such as causing hard drives to spin rapidly or disrupting power supply units.\n* Visual memetic agents displayed on the screen.\n* Triggering latent vulnerabilities in the computer's software, often resulting in a critical system failure or total data loss.\n* The manifestation of spiders.[[footnote]] Species vary. [[/footnote]]\n* Propulsion of the affected computer at high velocities.\n* Drainage of user's bank accounts.[[footnote]] Money is used solely to purchase items relating to wizards. [[/footnote]]\n* Several terabytes of image files manifesting on the user's hard drive. All images depict SCP-6289 partaking in various actions.[[footnote]] Examples include paying taxes, gambling, and ordering fast food. [[/footnote]]\n* Transfiguration of all text files to copies of \"The Fellowship of the Ring\" by J. R. R. Tolkien\n* Emission of abnormally loud auditory phenomena. (Refer to Incident 6289-1)\n\nFollowing initial testing, SCP-6289 was assigned the Thaumiel classification due to its effective usage in securing a total of --1,279-- --2,394-- --2,917-- --6,383-- 8,244 files classified as top secret.\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{**INTERVIEW LOG** }}\n[[/=]]\n-----\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-6289\n> @@ @@\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Rolland\n> @@ @@\n> **Foreword:** A .txt document was anomalously modified to allow communication between SCP-6289 and Dr. Rolland.

To ensure the safety of personnel, SCP-6289 was placed within an empty folder on a laptop, and testing was conducted using a remotely operated robotic arm. The final remote log from Test Site-1337, which was being streamed to several other sites, has been transcribed below:\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n> @@ @@\n> //Site Director Melvin Dash is standing in front of a control panel with Dr. Rolland.

A cover story of a volcanic eruption was put in place.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, it was discovered that despite the destruction, the computer housing SCP-6289 remained intact.
