If a location shift of SCP-ZH-981 is detected, its Task Force is to be notified to return it to its container and perform \"Disposal of Suicide Body\" coverup on any witnesses.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ZH-981 is the corpse of Makuwa Yurika, who committed suicide on 20██/██/██. \n\nSCP-ZH-981's anomalous properties is that it will sporadically teleport to a random coast on one of Taiwan's main islands, and it cannot decompose or be destroyed. The time interval pattern of SCP-ZH-981's movements has not been defined; the only discernible information is that its properties become more frequent nearest to traditional Chinese festivals, e.g. Tomb Sweeping Day, Hungry Ghost Festival, and Lunar New Year.\n\nAfter each teleportation of SCP-ZH-981, its hairstyle and clothing will be different, occasionally with items surrounding it. Recovered items have included:\n\n* A suitcase decorated with a multinational flag sticker, containing worn-out clothing and Ms. Makuwa Yurika's passport.\n* A resume contained within a folder.\n* Japanese landscape photos.\n* Garbage bags from ██ City containing Chinese calendars, incense wicks, and joss paper.\n* A family photograph, the family members' faces unrecognizable.\n\nAccording to our investigations, Ms. Makuwa Yurika immigrated from Japan to Taiwan in order to marry, and her spouse and surviving family are non-anomalous civilians. From testimonies gathered from her neighbors and in-laws, Ms. Makuwa Yurika cared greatly for her mother- and father-in-law, who shared residence with her, and was amicable with her husband's relatives with no complaints.\n\n**Addendum:** Ms. Makuwa Yurika's husband remarried in 20██[[footnote]]A year after her suicide.[[/footnote]] to an unknown civilian.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=AbyssDream and newnykacolaquantum\n]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename：**lqBDa6t.jpg\n> **Author：**[[*user AbyssDream]]\n> **License：**CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link：** https://i.imgur.com/lqBDa6t.jpg\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
