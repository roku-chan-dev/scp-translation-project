They will then move an object suitable for sitting down on next to a window, situated within the room, and will sit there for the remainder of the day with a sombre and relaxed expression.\n\nDuring the length of SCP-7991, no adverse weather conditions will arise in the subject's immediate vicinity, with most cases almost always consisting of sunny and cloudy weather.\n\nOver the course of the day, the subject will lose the ability to perceive the voices of individuals around them, though will display no distress towards this change. They also appear to become hypersensitive to other stimuli, with a fondness for natural sounds.\n\nThe affected individual is unable to engage in any meaningful conversation, often expressing confusion when such attempts are made. Upon noticing that they are being spoken to, the subject will glance between their surroundings, the initiator of the conversation, and the window they are seated near with visible tension. After several seconds, the individual then regains their composure, smiles, and politely waves the initiator off before they resume looking back towards the window.\n\nThe next morning, occurrences coinciding with the start of an SCP-7991 IRIDESCENT event will transpire. Attached below is a written transcript of a recorded IRIDESCENT event, experienced by an SCP-7991-affected subject henceforth only referred to as \"Jane\"[[footnote]] A widowed woman, 49, living alone at a small residence inherited from her parents which she moved to shortly following the passing of her wife.
