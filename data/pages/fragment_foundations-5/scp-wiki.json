A week after the signal starts, Mr. Hutchinson has returned -- alongside a brilliant chemist from France. Two weeks after //that//, they have several backers, six more scientists (with one more on the way), and a laboratory of their own.\n\nThe message they are receiving describes a universe beyond the boundaries of their imagination. It is a universe filled with quarks and singularities -- containing cosmological events so grand, so enormous in scale, that they defy all comprehension -- alongside quantum phenomena so subtle, so minuscule in nature, that they can scarcely be said to exist at all.\n\nIt is also a universe filled with the impossible. Impossible ideas. Impossible science. Impossible magic. And impossible monsters. \n\nSo very many impossible monsters. \n\nThe message is prefaced with a warning:\n\n[[div style=\"font-weight: bold; font-family: Courier New;\"]]\n> DO NOT RESPOND\n> \n> AUTOMATED MESSAGE\n> \n> OTHER UNIVERSES EXIST\n> \n> SOMETHING DIGESTING THEM\n> \n> IF YOU SEE THIS THEN WE LOST\n> \n> YOU ARE NEXT\n> \n> THIS IS ALL I CAN DO\n> \n> SORRY AND GOOD LUCK\n> \n> - ALICE CHAO\n[[/div]]\n\n\n----\n\n= **Next: That God-Damned Lizard**\n\n----",
