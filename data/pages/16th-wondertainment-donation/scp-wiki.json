As usual, another project that did exceedingly poorly with the intended target groups. Fortunately for both of us, those very same surveys have made it abundantly clear that we should focus on producing more plastic space robots that can be used as untraceable walkie-talkies, so at least it wasn't a complete waste of our time. \n> \n> The Doc was really sad when we heard about it failing so miserably, by the way... we really loved this idea. There is no justice.\n> \n> Anyways, we'll send you our surplus as they keep popping out of their eggs. Give them a good life, okay? And keep up the good work!\n> \n> Yours Sincerely,\n> Padrig Banes\n> \n> PS: I hope you don't mind the interruption, Prime Minister.
