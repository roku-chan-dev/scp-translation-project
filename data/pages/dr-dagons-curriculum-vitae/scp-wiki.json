His expertise in determination of properties and effects of sentient anomalies and of anomalous objects through his background in analytical and interpretive science techniques led him to excel at determining proper containment procedures upon their arrival to the Department of Sciences.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[toc]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ Early Life\nDagon was born to Dianne Trimble and Jonathan Dagon eight months from first diagnosis shortly after Valentines Day, 1995. Dagon's first few weeks of life were spent in an incubator due to his habit of turning blue during bouts of stubbornness towards breathing. However, his opposition towards air is not believed to have contributed to his later development. As a toddler, Dagon was known for the many added straps into his stroller due to his frequent attempts to escape and run into the street.\n\nAs an adolescent, Dagon frequently engaged in risky behaviour such as running full-speed into walls head-first, experimenting with various toxic substances,[[footnote]] Particularly the common garden slug, which he fed to various relatives at varying dosages. [[/footnote]] and instigating conflict between nearby persons to fuel his addiction to stress.[[footnote]] Which he believed allowed him to control the immediate temporal and spacial dimensions in his immediate surroundings. [[/footnote]] It was during one of his self-induced panic attacks that Dagon first became aware of the latent reality-warping abilities held by all emotive beings. Dagon would later reference these experiences as inspiration for his work with the AIAD.\n\nAs a young adult, Dagon excelled in the sciences beyond his peers.[[footnote]] In one particular event, Dagon was banned from participating in local science fairs after building a rudimentary railgun and embedding a hotwheels truck inside a classroom wall. [[/footnote]] However, he was frequently in trouble and was warned against becoming a scientist due to his attitude towards authority[[footnote]] Dagon would later be disciplined during graduate school for referring to a professor publicly as \"a hypocritical dumbass who exemplifies all the problems of teaching and learning in one rat-shaped man.\" [[/footnote]] and general disinterest in his education.[[footnote]] Although Dagon eventually became actively engaged in learning when given an opportunity to excel as an independent researcher in university. [[/footnote]] Outside of his schooling, Dagon also engaged in sports,[[footnote]] Playing football on his high school team. [[/footnote]] music,[[footnote]] Playing drums recreationally, once at a biker bar, and once at a country bar. [[/footnote]] and volunteering.[[footnote]] Participating in Scouts as a Beaver, Cub, Scout, Venturer, and Leader. [[/footnote]] Dagon has often credited his experiences in scouting in his development of skills related to management[[footnote]] After forming an illicit speakeasy of international badge trading. [[/footnote]] and reacting to unexpected situations.[[footnote]] After dealing with a leader who would throw meat. [[/footnote]]\n\n+++ Foundation attention\nDagon first entered the eye of the Foundation during his youth when he became involved in a search for a rare Canadian Chupacabra. In this event, Dagon was participating in a \"Blood Hunt\"[[footnote]] A scouting activity where children follow a trail of fake blood to find a cache of candy in the woods at night. [[/footnote]] when his group stumbled upon a second path of blood leading deeper into the woods. After tasting the blood and finding it to be real, Dagon's group decided that this second path must have been the correct path and followed it to the corpse of a deer that had been freshly killed and drained by the Chupacabra. Dagon and his group were amnesticized the following morning, although Dagon is believed to have retained all memory of the event due to a temporal procedure he would later undergo after the events of Project RUBY.\n\nDagon would then be observed by Foundation personnel throughout much of his life as he had many other encounters with the anomalous. Some Foundation personnel[[footnote]] Such as Dr. Harold Blank. [[/footnote]] have even gone as far as proposing that Dagon had become some sort of living nexus sometime in his childhood due to the sheer amount of anomalous occurrences that had occurred around him, although no tests of this theory had ever been performed. Of particular note, Dagon's presence often changed the activity of barbershops that he entered, causing hairdressers to enter a fugue state and act uncharacteristically of their professional and typical identity,[[footnote]] Known cases include causing hairdressers to waterboard, accost, or otherwise become aggressive towards Dagon. [[/footnote]] and conferences that he attended, causing technology to malfunction around him.[[footnote]] Known cases include a projector bulb exploding in the moments before Dagon began to speak, a network outage during an online poster conference, and a printer catching fire while printing one of his posters. [[/footnote]]\n\n++ Career at the Foundation\nDr. Dagon has held multiple roles at the Foundation during his tenure. In October of 2020, he completed Foundation training as a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/butterfly-squad-roster|Butterfly Reviewer]]] and became involved in the critique and review of internal documentation as a copy editor of the Journal of Predation and Containment. Additionally, Dr. Dagon has been involved in various other Foundation initiatives, although the majority of these records are still being retrieved after the events of Project Ruby.\n\n+++ Career as the head researcher of the AIAD (1986-1999)\nDr. Dagon oversaw the AIAD task force responsible for containing a hostile extraterrestrial construct released from containment in 1996.\n\nHis knowledge of computers and artificial intelligence, developed in his work at the Foundation between 2008 and 2024 before being sent back in time to 1986 by a reality bending anomaly, made him an invaluable asset for the early AIAD program.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-dagons-curriculum-vitae/aiad_card.png\n|align=center\n|caption=Greetings from Site-15 by [[*user daviiid]]; From left to right is Dr. Nathan Valis (Dr. Placeholder), Dr. Pierre Dagon, Yves Isabi, and Agent Tyler Umen from the Limited Memory series.\n|width=44rem]]\n\n[[div class=\"museum-display\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[ai-classification-guide|AI Classification Guide]]]\nBy [[user Placeholder McD]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[scp-5241|SCP-5241: That Alien Message]]]\nBy [[user Placeholder McD]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[project-ruby|Project Ruby]]]\nBy [[user Tyumen]], [[user Pedagon]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[scp-5841|SCP-5841: Digital Hydra]]]\nBy [[user Tyumen]], [[user Placeholder McD]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[corruption|Corruption]]]\nBy [[user Pedagon]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[a-symphony-of-iron-and-steel|A Symphony of Iron and Steel]]]\nBy [[user Its a Bad Idea]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[internet-explorers|Internet Explorers]]]\nBy [[user Pedagon]], [[user Tyumen]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[fragmented-compiled/|FRAGMENTED / COMPILED]]]\nBy [[user Tyumen]], [[user Placeholder McD]], [[user Its a Bad Idea]], [[user Pedagon]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n++++* [[[isolated-efficient|Isolated, Efficient]]]\nBy [[user Tyumen]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Decrypt Limited Memory Artwork?\" hide=\"Displaying classified info\"]]\n[[div class=\"museum-display\"]]\n[[div class=\"entry\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dr-dagons-curriculum-vitae/mnemosyne_estrellayoshte2.jpeg]]\n\nMnemosyne by [[*user EstrellaYoshte]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n++ Legacy\n+++ Selected works\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab SCP-5365]]\n++++* [[[scp-5365|You Do Not Recognize The Antibodies In D.

Unfortunately, I very soon after fell extremely ill and somewhat (completely) abandoned Grigori in the writing process. However, as a great guy and friend he pulled out this amazing piece and it helped me at some of my lowest moments to go back to and appreciate that he wrote this while I couldn't. \n\n[[>]]\nGo read [[[grigori-karpin-s-author-page|Grigori's stuff]]].
