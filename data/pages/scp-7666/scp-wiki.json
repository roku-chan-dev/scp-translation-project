In the interim, additional funding and personnel have been allocated for Site-666 as a result of the sudden increase in containment domain that SCP-7666 represents.\n\n\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-7666 is an anomalous metropolis located in the Fourth Circle of Hell, relative to the city of Las Vegas, Nevada, United States. SCP-7666 is colloquially known to its 1.1 million demonic residents (and Foundation personnel) as Undervegas.\n\nUntil 1992, SCP-7666 did not exist in its current form of a discrete city. Instead, it was simply part of Las Vegas as it protruded into the Fourth Circle of Hell, forming a massive gateway through which demons could cross; in essence, they were different sections of the same city. The forcible rescue of Las Vegas from Hell in March 1992 by the Foundation successfully returned and anchored Las Vegas to baseline reality. It also inadvertently returned and anchored Undervegas to the Fourth Circle Hell, where it continued to grow and operate as a tourist destination, economic hub, and occasional host of the Summer Olympics.\n\nBy 1999, Undervegas was inhabited by over a million demonic residents and a handful of humans. The city's topology is roughly analogous to that of Las Vegas itself, though highly exaggerated, and contains several legendary landmarks and casinos that have long since been torn down and replaced. The city has a complex social and political structure controlled by the most powerful of these demons: \"Pit Bosses\".\n\nAstonishingly, this all went largely unnoticed by Site-666 for nearly 7 years (despite being located on top of SCP-7666), until February 1999.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//[Director HOUSE clears his throat.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Okay, I admit, maybe not our greatest moment. We're not perfect here. Otherwise we wouldn't be in Hell, right? But you're also here, which means you can't criticize us!

I mean, none of the rest of this matters if you can't find the door, right? Actually, speaking of doors, here's a question: how many of you like to win?\n\n//[A chorus of assent rings out through the lecture hall.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Good, good. How many of you think cheating to win is wrong?\n\n//[A confused, weaker chorus, perhaps a choir of assent rings out.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Unfortunate, but we'll beat that out of you soon enough. See, the reality is that we're horrifically outnumbered here -- in Las Vegas //and// Undervegas. The 19s and 120s and 43s you guys worked at might have discouraged open, blatant lying and cheating to win. I carry no such reservations, on the casino floor or in the office. I encourage you not to, either. Actually, you probably shouldn't cheat on the casino floor, Suurthaxyl might break your knees. But my point is that if you're not prepared to bullshit and hustle your way into containing anomalies, this isn't the place for you. Door's right there.\n\n//[Two researchers get up, gather their things, and leave.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Suckers. What was I talking about? Oh yeah, getting to Undervegas. Well, it used to be real easy. People would pass into it and back again without even realizing it, multiple times a day. Course, when Las Vegas completely collapsed into Hell in '92, we turned on the Theoplanar Vacuum Unit, and that got a lot harder. Oh yeah -- the spotlight on the Luxor is one of the most expensive pieces of paratech in the Western Hemisphere. You should probably know that. Interestingly, the engineers tell me it also smells really, really bad. Go figure.\n\n//[HOUSE shrugs.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Anyway, nowadays there's really only two ways for a regular Joe to get into Undervegas. The first is naturally. Like I said, partake in the city's all-you-can-eat-buffet of sin -- do the horizontal Macarena in the back room of an Elvis chapel, lose all of your money on horse fights, pass out under a car. That sort of thing. Do it at the right time under the right cosmic conditions, you might stumble out of your haze in the Infernal Apple, Sin^^2^^ City, Undervegas.\n\n**DOCTOR:** Uh, sir? You said there were two ways.\n\n**HOUSE:** Oh yeah. The second is when your IDIOT STAFF accidentally summons the Prince of Hell during a party and opens a gateway into Tartarus.\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-7666's existence abruptly came to Foundation attention on February 2nd, 1999, during a small party in the Site-666 employee lounge on Sublevel 2. After three years of //in-situ// study and training, including hundreds of interviews with demonic entities, Foundational personnel, and local vermin, Doctor Contessa Thorner had published her thesis paper to the Foundation Academic Service[[footnote]] THORNER, \"Wages of Sin City: Towards an Empirical Immorality Metric for Undervegas,\" in DEICIDIA: The Journal of the Department of Tactical Theology, vol. 24 no. 16 1999. [[/footnote]]. In celebration, she and several coworkers had a small recreational get-together in the bar of the employee lounge. Incidentally, she had recited several Latin chants earlier in the day as part of her thesis reading, and throughout the day, through sheer astronomical coincidence, completed almost all the tasks necessary for an exceptionally powerful demon summoning ritual.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[Agent ALICE STERLING, Agent CLARK ADAMS, and Doctor CONTESSA THORNER are seated at a table in the Site bar. Several empty glasses litter the table. There are about three dozen other off-duty personnel in the lounge, mingling.]//\n\n**ADAMS:** So then I tell her: ma'am, if you keep resisting, I'm going to have to use UNDEAD-ly force. \n\n//[He giggles drunkenly. The other two stare at him.]//\n\n**STERLING:** What?\n\n**ADAMS:** She was a demon. So I says--\n\n**THORNER:** Demons aren't undead.\n\n**ADAMS:** Uh, yes they are. They suck your blood, turn into bats.\n\n**THORNER:** Those are vampires, Clark.\n\n**ADAMS:** Oh. Yeah. Right. I knew that. You know. Yeah.\n\n**STERLING:** Wait, have you been working here for //seven years// thinking that we were containing vam--\n\n**ADAMS:** I'll go get another round!\n\n//[ADAMS slides out of his seat and heads to the bar.]//\n\n**STERLING:** So, Tess -- happy to be done?\n\n**THORNER:** Done printing a hundred page paper from our shitty printer, //yes//. Done with the thesis, not quite yet! I still have to present the findings at the annual conference and then actually apply the findings. I'm thinking of creating a reverse-TRE vacuum--\n\n**STERLING:** Relax, hun. You'll be fine, you always kill it with this nerd stuff.\n\n**THORNER:** Thanks. Just so excited, you know? I've been //dreaming// about this day ever since I started this project. When I'm not dreaming about killing and dissecting the Vegas Mothman, I mean.\n\n**STERLING:** Sometimes you scare me, Tess.\n\n//[ADAMS returns with three bottles of beer, taking a seat.]//\n\n**ADAMS:** Aw hell yeah. Oh, anyone got a bottle opener?\n\n**THORNER:** No, but I have a shiv I made from demon-horn-shavings. \n\n**STERLING:** Same principle.\n\n//[THORNER takes one of the bottles, removing the small knife from her labcoat, and wedges it under the bottlecap. It opens the bottle but slips, cutting her thumb.]//\n\n> **FILESERV CONTEXTUAL NOTICE:** The sole remaining step to complete the summoning ritual Dr. Thorner had accidentally begun was the sacrifice of the blood of a virgin.\n\n**THORNER:** Ow!\n\n**STERLING:** Oh shit, are you okay?\n\n**THORNER:** //(Lightly sucking her thumb)// Should be fine, it's not deep. I haven't had any feeling in that thumb since I got a fourth degree holy burn on it, anyway. Let's drink!\n\n//[The three raise their bottles, clinking them together. At the same time, the facility begins to shake, quickly increasing in intensity. Personnel look around, dive to the floor, and surreptitiously steal bottles of alcohol from behind the bar in the chaos.]//\n\n**ADAMS:** Uhhhhh I think we're having a storm. No, an earthquake.\n\n//[STERLING yanks ADAMS down under the table. The shaking continues to increase as a large, red-ringed glowing gateway forms on the far wall, shooting sparks and surrounded by inscribed runes. Through the 4m wide circle, the hellish landscape of the Las Vegas Beltway can be seen. A hulking, red-skinned, ram-horned demon wearing a Los Angeles Lakers jersey and shorts over its weighty frame ducks through the gateway. A deflated basketball is impaled on its left horn.]//\n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** GRAAARGH! WHO DARES INTERRUPT THE PRINCE OF THE INFERNAL CITY, THREE LENGTHS FROM A GAME-WINNING ALLEY-OOP?

It's gotta be a paper jam or something, but I really don't want to open it up. Useless--\n\n**OVCOM:** Director House.\n\n**HOUSE:** We're in Hell. \n\n**OVCOM:** Is that... standard?\n\n**HOUSE:** A little bit. \n\n**OVCOM:** What's different now?\n\n**HOUSE:** I'm looking out of my window, and I can only see a fire-and-brimstone version of the Vegas Strip. Typically that would signify a bachelor party, but right now it seems like we have slipped into Hell. I think I can see a cavern roof where the sky should be. Also, all the casinos are wrong and there are demons everywhere.\n\n**OVCOM:** Oh. That seems... problematic.\n\n**HOUSE:** A little bit.\n\n**OVCOM:** Hold on, please.\n\n//[The OVCOM operator patches into several internal security feeds of Site-666. They all return no signal.

In the western hemisphere, that is. Goddamn Macau. Place is named after a bird, not even a real name. \n\n//[HOUSE grumbles under his breath.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Anyway, well done! So you emerge from your stupor staring into a demonic perversion of a frankly already-pretty-perverted American city. But Las Vegas sucks, right? I mean, we all know it's a mess of hot asphalt, crappy underpasses, densely-packed buildings and alleys. The traffic sucks, and if you didn't know you might go to Hell you'd probably do a jumper off a casino balcony. So you're probably wondering how much worse Undervegas could possibly be.\n\n//[He chuckles.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Man, if you think OUR city planners hate you-- see, everyone says Vegas changes with the times. Old casinos and hotels demolished to make way for the new. Phoenix rising from the ashes and all that, the grand spirit of capitalism run amok. In the spirit of opposites, Undervegas is permanently stuck in the past. Imagine, you walk out of an alley, eyes bleary, and survey the Las Vegas skyline. But wait -- The Stratosphere and the MGM Grand are missing. In their places are low, squat buildings you've never seen before. Not the megacasinos of the modern age, but all of the legendary Strip fixtures demolished over the past decade. It's the Dunes, the Sands, all the kitschy old casinos that became food in the bellies of hungrier operations before being imploded and built over. In the pits of Hell, they live on. And are somehow more profitable. Appropriate, isn't it? All casinos go to Hell.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=blacksuburban.png|\n    caption=Doctor Thorner's survey team.\n]]\n\nImmediately after realizing that Site-666 had fallen into unfamiliar territory, Director House contacted Overwatch Command before ordering the casino management to seal the doors and restrict guest movement. Conveniently, most guests were uninterested in leaving. The handful that did resist were allayed by the announcement of an all-night happy hour at the Luxor. Meanwhile, Director House convened a meeting of Site personnel to evaluate the situation. \n@@ @@\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶OPEN ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n**HOUSE:** WHAT THE--\n\n**ADAMS:** He'sgonnasayithe'sgonnasayithe'sgonna--\n\n**HOUSE:** **FUCK** DID YOU ALL DO?\n\n**ADAMS:** Hah! Wait.\n\n**MACKENZIE:** Our readings inform us that an exceptionally powerful demonic presence suddenly entered the Site at 0251 hours.\n\n**HOUSE:** Great job, I could tell from the security footage of the 9 foot tall guy with red skin and horns. Calling himself the Prince of Undervegas. Title's taken, jackass. //How// did he get in? And //how// did he drag the Site into Hell despite the Unit being on? And //how// do we get out? I want answers, people, not drool on your clipboards.\n\n**THORNER:** I may be able to help with that, Director. I believe I know how the demon got into the Site. The references to being a prince of the city reminded me of some interviews from my thesis paper, so I quickly ran down to my office and read through a few dozen pages of testimonies from interrogated demons. Then cross-referenced those with some old first editions of the Ars Goetia, Lemegeton, Inferno, and Pseudomonarchia Daemonum I had lying around.\n\n**HOUSE:** It's been like fifteen minutes.\n\n**THORNER:** Yes, I used the remaining time to make some coffee.\n\n//[THORNER sips from a coffee mug. It is emblazoned with the words \"#1 DEMONOLOGIST\".]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Damn, okay. What did you find?\n\n**THORNER:** It appears that at my thesis reading earlier in the week, I inadvertently spoke some phrases in Latin that began a complex ritual to summon an exceptionally powerful demon Prince. Through the following week, I essentially completed all of the rest of the steps as daily part of my research. Vivisection, demonic worship, communing with spirits, verbal abuse of my graduate students. The ritual was completed tonight, when I cut my thumb, spilling the blood of a vir-- a person who has a regular, standard amount of sex.\n\n**THOMPSON:** So you're saying that you summoned a Prince of Hell into the Site.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**THORNER:** I am no longer confident I know how the demon got into the Site.\n\n**HOUSE:** Ugh. Okay. Thompson, how are we holding?\n\n**THOMPSON:** We have enough on-Site power to survive a week, assuming the air is breathable, which it seems to be. \n\n**HOUSE:** Can we power the... other thing, with that?\n\n**THOMPSON:** What other thing?\n\n//[Pause.]//\n\n**THOMPSON:** Oh! Oh, yes. The other thing. I'm... not sure, sir. Not for long, and not very well. The real issue is the clientele. The guests are relaxed for now, but I expect within 4 hours we'll be dealing with real resistance to not letting them leave. \n\n**HOUSE:** This is a Vegas casino, so make that 8. But point taken. How many of our MTFs do we have?\n\n**KURTZ:** Only 25% of High Rollers were on base at the time of the incident. The ones left topside are holed up in Caesar's Palace. \n\n**HOUSE:** Okay. Okay, let me think. Doctor Thorner.\n\n**THORNER:** Yes?\n\n**HOUSE:** Here's your chance to redeem yourself: where exactly are we and how do we get out of here?\n\n**THORNER:** I'm going to need more research for that. With our largest MTF out of commission--\n\n**KURTZ:** I mean, we still have over a hundred troo--\n\n**THORNER:** --**and completely disabled**, I propose that you let me take a small, three-man survey team out of the Site to assess what we're dealing with. We'll move fast, talk with some the demons that appear to be writhing outside, and with any luck we'll have our way out of here quick.\n\n**HOUSE:** That's surprisingly not insane, coming from you. Not even any dissection necessary.\n\n**THORNER:** It's unfortunate, but not every problem can be solved by well-applied scalpels. Just the vast majority of them.\n\n**HOUSE:** Alright. You'll go, I'll come with you.\n\n//[A chorus of dissent springs up from the assembled Site leadership.]//\n\n**MACKENZIE:** Sir, we need your expertise in case the demonology equipment stops--\n\n**KURTZ:** Letting a Site Director go anywhere dangerous without a full platoon is madness. And more important, against Foundation policy--\n\n**THOMPSON:** The personnel and client questions aren't going to stop, Director, and we need someone for the buck to--\n\n**LEIBOWITZ:** Sir, we need someone to fix the printer--\n\n**HOUSE:** Okay! Okay! I get it. Jesus Christ.\n\n**ADAMS:** He's not--\n\n**HOUSE:** Don't say it!

Everyone else was walking this way.\n\n**HOUSE:** You know what, that's a pretty good reason. Anyway, I'm going to radio back to Overwatch and tell them to hold off sending the cavalry. Doctor Thorner, hurry up and assemble your team for this mission. I'm going to stick around batting down the fires here and assisting you from base. The rest of you, make sure your spheres are as clean as they can be in the circumstances and lend help to those who need it. \n\n//[A rousing, affirmative chorus from the group.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** We might be in Hell, but that doesn't mean we're gonna go to it. \n\n//[A weaker chorus goes around.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Yeah, that sounded cooler in my head.

Wait, what?\n\n**STERLING:** You have like six PhDs and you don't have a driver's license?\n\n**THORNER:** They had to invent a new class for me: //\"vehicular menace\"//. \n\n//[The Suburban makes a slow loop around Site-666. The group looks out of the windows.]//\n\n**STERLING:** It looks... just like Vegas.\n\n**ADAMS:** No, look at the buildings. They're all wrong. None of the big casinos are there. The Bellagio, the MGM. These are all the old ones. I think that's the Dunes, the Sand in the distance. Oh shit, do you think Frank Sinatra's down here?\n\n**THORNER:** We can only hope.\n\n**ADAMS:** Man, my grandma's gonna be so disappointed. \n\n**STERLING:** If the megacasinos aren't down here, what are those?\n\n//[She points at the far end of the Strip. There are multi-story buildings reaching up to the caverned roof, with neon signs proclaiming their names. The most visible is \"DESSERT INN\".]//\n\n**ADAMS:** You mean the Desert Inn?\n\n**STERLING:** No, it definitely says Dessert. \n\n**ADAMS:** No idea. There's never been a casino called that in Vegas.\n\n//[The car pulls out of Site-666, which is haphazardly planted into the rock by the roadside. They get onto the main road of the Strip. It is a gently curving circle, other buildings lining the roadside. Almost immediately, demons become visible everywhere. Demons of all kinds, shapes, and appearances fill the streets, drinking out of paper bags, partying, and generally causing a ruckus. Big band music seems to ring out over the entire city, fueling the drunken rave. Flying demons are visible overhead, doing much the same in midair.]//\n\n**THORNER:** Oh my.

Actually, if you say \"scumbag that started this whole mess\" to my employees, they'll probably assume you're talking about me. So don't do that.

Envy, wrath, sloth. \n\n//[He points to each section of the ring as he speaks.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** My point is that don't make the most common mistake: thinking that Undervegas is a monolith. It's not.

No. Ba'al is too powerful for that. Once he quartered and drank another Prince's blood. You know, as a warning. Then sunk a three-pointer from two courts away.

I don't mean that to say that demons are just people -- though they are. I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's a little bit of demon in everyone. It's just who we are. Maybe there's a few Zen monks in the audience, but most of us are ruled by temptation and desire and all the other things French people write poetry about. We're slaves to our own wants.\n\n**HOUSE:** Demons are that turned to 11. Pit Bosses are that turned to 11,000.

Actually, I always thought the weird old dude who lived across the street was a demon, but it turns out he just had tetanus and anxiety.\n\n**CALENDAR:** Humans are weird. Where I grew up, the second most popular game was \"punch contest\".\n\n**STERLING:** What was the first?\n\n**CALENDAR:** Monopoly. It usually led into the punch contest.\n\n//[CALENDAR flexes her biceps.]//\n\n**CALENDAR:** Three time champ in the old neighborhood, baby. \n\n**THORNER:** These are Conceit-class demons. Not a lot of these guys in Las Vegas.\n\n**STERLING:** What's the main casino here? Is there one?\n\n**CALENDAR:** Bet your sweet ass there is. The Sands shouldn't be far from here. Just follow the trail of people who are smiling at you but clearly think their life choices are slightly better than yours.\n\n//[The Suburban continues to drive through the suburbs. As the endless, repetitive neighborhood continues, a demon in a suit waves down the car.]//\n\n**DEMON:** Howdy, neighbors! You folks seem like you're not from //around here.// Let me bid you welcome to Ivory Towers, where we pride ourselves.\n\n//[A beat passes.]//\n\n**STERLING:** Oh, I thought you were going to finish that senten--\n\n**DEMON:** Nope! Can I help you with something?\n\n**THORNER:** Do you know how to get to the Sands casino? \n\n//[The demon chuckles.]//\n\n**DEMON:** Oh, but why would you want to go to the Sands when suburban Ivory Towers is so nice? I mean, we're crime-free, gang-free, homeless-free--\n\n**THORNER:** Wait. Hold on.\n\n//[THORNER sniffs the air intently. She draws her nose closer to the demon.]//\n\n**THORNER:** I know this kind of evil.\n\n**ADAMS:** What?\n\n**THORNER:** He's an HOA president.\n\n//[The group responds with various noises of disgust.]//\n\n**CALENDAR:** Tell us where the Sands is before I break you over my knee, snotnose.\n\n//[He points down the road. The car speeds off -- the demon is briefly audible yelling about property valuations and being the recipient of a best-kept lawn award before he disappears in the rearview mirror. Shortly, the sprawling Sands casino comes into view, surrounding by mid-market American sedans and SUVs. Well-dressed, slightly-above-middle-class demons walk in and out of the casino's large doorway. The group parks the car and enter. A bellhop demon greets them.]//\n\n[[include component:image-block name=thesands.png|\n    caption=The Sands casino and hotel, located in Undervegas.\n]]\n\n**DEMON:** Welcome to the New Sands Casino! Three-time recipient of the Infernal Award for most hospitable Undervegas hotel and casino! Unfortunately, only guests are allowed access, so I'll need to see your--\n\n//[CALENDAR picks up the demon by the scruff of his shirt and throws him. He smashes headfirst into the marble wall, and does not move. The other guests stare for a moment before whispering to each other indiscreetly and giving the group a wide berth.]//\n\n**THORNER:** You make an excellent bodyguard, Calendar.\n\n**CALENDAR:** I don't know what that is, but thanks.\n\n//[They move through the casino floor.]//\n\n**STERLING:** Is this place all slot machines or something? I don't see a single other type of game.\n\n//[Passing by, ADAMS idly pulls the lever on a slot machine. It jerks.]//\n\n**ADAMS:** Oh, shit! You're a demon.\n\n**DEMON:** //Don't stop.//\n\n**ADAMS:** Yeugh!\n\n//[ADAMS whips his hand back.]//\n\n**CALENDAR:** Slot machines are the perfect game for Pride demons. Basically no skill involved, all luck and chance, but they still get to feel superior when they win. Which is why so many of them //are// slot machines.\n\n**STERLING:** That... makes a strange amount of sense.\n\n**ADAMS:** This is nuts, man. Ocean's Eleven was filmed here. Frank Sinatra played here!\n\n**STERLING:** You've said that about every casino we've been to, Clark. \n\n**ADAMS:** Because he did! \n\n**THORNER:** Shut up with your throat noises and look.\n\n//[THORNER points down the lane. At the end, between the potted plants and endless rows of slot machines, lies a lone card table, occupied by a single white-suited dealer.]//\n\n**CALENDAR:** Smells like unspeakable evil. That's your man.\n\n**ADAMS:** Hey, I think I smell it too!\n\n**CALENDAR:** No, hon, that's the overwhelming aftershave.\n\n**ADAMS:** //(Eyes watering)// Oh, yeah.\n\n//[The team approaches.]//\n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** Ohoh. Look at this motley foursome. You must be the humans and the...\n\n//[He looks at CALENDAR, lip curling in slight disgust.]//\n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** Dog accompanying them.\n\n**CALENDAR:** Careful, pretty boy. I bite.\n\n**STERLING:** And I guess you're the Pit Boss here. \n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** Oh, no. He is.\n\n//[He signals behind him. Through the windows of the Sands, a gigantic, disgusting, blue-purple fleshy mass can be seen lying in the courtyard. A single, winding tendril extends from it, snaking across the astroturf and into the wall, before exiting from a vent and landing in the dealer's neck.]//\n\n**ADAMS:** What the hell?!\n\n**CALENDAR:** Oh, gross.\n\n**STERLING:** Thaaat's disgusting.\n\n**THORNER:** Fascinating! I want to dissect it. See how it tastes. Maybe broiled or seared.\n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** What?\n\n**THORNER:** What?\n\n**UNIDENTIFIED:** You guys are weird river trash. I mean, I knew you were river trash, but I didn't know you were weird. Anyway, I'm just a voice for him. And he's Asmodeus.\n\n//[THORNER sucks in a breath.]//\n\n**STERLING:** Based off her reaction, I'm assuming you're important, or have subtly agreed to let her taste you.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** The former. Belial and Queen Forneus mentioned you wanted to make a deal in IRC.\n\n**STERLING:** Yeah, we-- wait, you use IRC?\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Yes, Imp Relay Chat. We yell the message at an imp, maybe whip it a little, and it flies across town to deliver it.\n\n**THORNER:** That's interesting. I like that. We should use that.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Indeed. Unfortunately, I highly doubt you have anything to offer me that would will me to move against Ba'al on the behalf of mortals. \n\n**STERLING:** Yeah, our boss said you might say that.\n\n//[STERLING slips her phone from her pocket, dialing a number in. On the second ring, it picks up.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Hello?\n\n**STERLING:** You okay, sir?\n\n**HOUSE:** Yeah, fine. Just trying to get the PRINTER working.\n\n**STERLING:** Cool. Yeah, we're talking to the Pit Boss in Ivory Towers. An Asmodeus.\n\n**HOUSE:** Ah, wunderbar. Put me on.\n\n//[STERLING hands the phone to ASMODEUS, who takes it hesitantly.]//\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Hello?\n\n//[The group watches ASMODEUS' inaudible conversation with the Director. His face goes through several emotions, from disgust, to surprise, to rage, to amusement, and finally back to smug.]//\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Yes, I think that will be quite suitable. Pleasure doing business with you.\n\n//[ASMODEUS hands the phone back to STERLING.]//\n\n**STERLING:** Boss, I do not like the look on this guy's face. What did you do?\n\n**HOUSE:** I'll explain when you get back. It's all part of the plan, don't worry. This guy's an arrogant, smug prick with almost no redeeming qualities. We understand each other.\n\n**ADAMS:** Don't know if this is the kinda guy we wanna be operating with, Boss.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Definitely not. But you don't have a choice. Though of course, you're going to fail anyway.\n\n**HOUSE:** Wait, what did he say? Put me on speaker.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Nothing!\n\n**HOUSE:** Spit it out, you prehensile fuck!\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Or what? You're a tiny metal object that folds, you can't do anything to me.\n\n**HOUSE:** Calendar!\n\n**CALENDAR:** I don't work for you.\n\n**HOUSE:** Break his knees!\n\n**CALENDAR:** Oh, nevermind, I'll work for you.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Wait, wait! Okay -- the reason Ba'al was able to get your stupid little pyramid down here to begin with despite your anchoring agent was because he had help. From someone on the inside.\n\n**THORNER:** Yes, we know, me. But not on purpose.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Not that. An exceptionally powerful demonic presence. Not just a demon, in fact. The father of all demons. King of the Nine Circles of Hell, Overlord of Sin, Supreme Dawg, the Big Kahuna.\n\n**HOUSE:** Wait, are you saying that--\n\n**ASMODEUS:** Yes, you stupid fruit! Satan himself, agent of betrayal and destruction, is in your walls! And as long as he favors Ba'al, you stand no chance!\n\n**STERLING:** Why would you tell us this?\n\n**HOUSE:** I signed the contract. He doesn't care what happens as long as he gets his. Shit.\n\n**STERLING:** Maybe not the best move. What did you promise him?\n\n**THORNER:** Wait. This is impossible. This doesn't conform to any of the demonology logic we know Undervegas and Hell operates on.\n\n**HOUSE:** What?\n\n**THORNER:** Hell aligns with Dante's understanding of it, as attested in //Inferno//. He said Satan was frozen in the bottommost circle of Hell, suggesting any of his appearances were just weak projections. No real Satanic power, just the ability to influence people and things to sin. I interviewed hundreds of demons for my thesis. They all agreed with that.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** 'Tis true. Our father Satan is still imprisoned in the Great Frigidaire of the Ninth Circle. But even his projection, appearing as a simple, unassuming object, can wreak havoc on you naïve mortals. \n\n**HOUSE:** Hold on. You said betrayal.\n\n**ASMODEUS:** The Ninth Circle contains the Great Betrayer. As such, he loves to spread chaos and discord through subtle betrayals and creeping treachery.\n\n**HOUSE:** Oh. Oh god.\n\n**ADAMS:** Boss?\n\n**HOUSE:** What's the one object that, throughout this entire endeavor, has been consistently failing us and betraying us when we need it most? Leaving us frustrated and out to dry, throwing a constant, minor annoyance in my plans to get the Site back to Earth?\n\n//[There is silence on the line.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Get back here immediately.\n----\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n----\n**HOUSE:** You bastard.

He is standing in the middle of the room, in front of his printer, holding a sledgehammer.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Oh, good. I was about to start. AAAAAH!\n\n//[He bashes the sledgehammer into the printer, shattering its plastic casing. Nothing happens.]//\n\n**CALENDAR:** I think the pressure cooked his brain.\n\n**STERLING:** Sir, maybe you should--\n\n//[He raises the sledgehammer, smashing it into the printer again and again. His assistant peeks into the office.]//\n\n**SECRETARY:** Sir, why are you assaulting your printer?\n\n**HOUSE:** Devil got into it.\n\n**SECRETARY:** Okay, sir.\n\n//[She closes the door. Suddenly, the shattered, pulverized remnants of the printer began to shake and emit a thick, black smoke. Everyone jumps back. A stilted, digitally-synthesized voice escapes from its remains.]//\n\n**SATAN:** {{HA. HA. HA. WELL DONE. I ADMIT, I DID NOT EXPECT YOU TO DEDUCE IT.}}\n\n**HOUSE:** You bastard!

As part of Plan Copperfield, executed by Assistant Director Lindsay Blake, signs and advertisements were pasted up in the area advertising a surprise one-time-only show by famed American illusionist David Copperfield, in which he would make the Luxor disappear and reappear. This was similar to a notable 1983 performance in which he had made the Statue of Liberty 'disappear', and the audience did not question it. Copperfield was acquired by MTF Omega-33 and forcibly put up to the task. Upon Site-666's reappearance, the crowd applauded and Copperfield was permitted to return home.\n\nSite-666 personnel secured the location and affirmed that all guests were present, no demons had stowed away aboard the Site, and generally that all was in order.

How did you know?\n\n**HOUSE:** How did I know what?\n\n**RESEARCHER:** That the Site had enough power for the vacuum unit? That the other Princes would successfully distract Ba'al? That you had... Satan's favor on your side? I mean, how did you know that any of this would //work?//\n\n**HOUSE:** I didn't. But I made a plan, I stacked the odds. Then I did what we all do in this city: I rolled the dice. And I got lucky. I need risk-takers, people who don't just think outside the box -- they //live// outside it. People willing to make a gambit and roll the dice.\n\n//[He pauses, then grins.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Hey, you guys know why I got lucky?\n\n//[A groan passes through the audience. Director HOUSE grins and sips from his mug.]//\n\n**HOUSE:** Yeah, you goddamn know.\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[div style=\"display: none;\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=**ROUNDERHOUSE**]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n----\n> **Filename:** luxorred.png\n> **Name:** Pyramid In Las Vegas (47384666).jpeg\n> **Author:** Mikhail Gritsak, edited by [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pyramid_In_Las_Vegas_(47384666).jpeg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** blacksuburban.png\n> **Name:** Black 2015-20 Chevrolet Suburban on LV Freeway.jpg\n> **Author:** Noah Wulf, edited by [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0 Unported\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Black_2015-20_Chevrolet_Suburban_on_LV_Freeway.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** luxorinterior.jpg\n> **Name:** inside the luxor hotel/casino, las vegas\n> **Author:** Stilfehler at wikivoyage shared\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 1.0 Generic\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Luxor_Las_Vegas_3.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** luxornorm.jpg\n> **Name:** Luxor Sky Beam, Luxor Las Vegas, Las Vegas Strip, Las Vegas, Nevada\n> **Author:** Ken Lund\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0 \n> **Source:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/kenlund/245237369 Flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** thesands.png\n> **Name:** Sands 95 (28276866984).jpg\n> **Author:** Christian Schmitt from Lohr, Deutschland, edited by [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]]\n> **License:** CC 2.0 Generic\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sands_95_(28276866984).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
