  "content": "As you are not an Epic Gamer, you feel you would not be up to a conversation about the games you noticed. That, or you just find Greg intimidating; hard to say. Either way, you keep your mouth shut as Greg does his best to ignore you. He clicks through projects and files that don’t seem like they have anything to do with the information you need from him. As you wait, you can feel the air become tense with annoyed awkwardness. The mouse clicks become a little more forceful, the keyboard clacks become a bit more rushed. You feel like you’ve made yourself a nuisance just by standing here, but you also feel it would just make things more awkward to go sit at the table now. Then again, Greg didn’t want you to stand here in the first place, but then again you feel it might be rude of you to walk away from him now. On the one hand, leaving him alone might help him focus; on the other hand, he might finish as soon as you start to walk away…\n\nBefore either side of your social anxiety can win, you are startled back to reality by Greg loudly clearing his throat. He’s holding out your clipboard for you to take, and from the look on his face you get the sense that he’s been trying to hand it to you for more than a few seconds. You take the clipboard and thank Greg in a tone that probably sounds more relieved than you wanted. You look through the data he’s written in; it all looks fairly normal: A large amount spent on paper and ink (no surprise there), a moderate amount spent on instant coffee (more than they should, just like every other department in the Foundation), a request for funds going toward better computers and scanners (we’ll see), and…\n\nUpkeep costs for 8 Scranton Reality Anchors? So far you haven’t seen anything in this department that would require a single Reality Anchor, let alone 8. The thought that someone might be embezzling those funds crosses your mind, which would be completely unacceptable for any Foundation department! Then again, this seems to be a strange department, and you can always just note that oddity in your auditing report. They may get investigated by the Auditing Department for it anyways. You could just leave and be done with it, or you could ask and make this awkward situation even more awkward. You decide to…\n\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/14 Leave without asking about the Reality Anchors.]||= 37||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/15 Ask about the Reality Anchors.]||\n\n-----\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _",
