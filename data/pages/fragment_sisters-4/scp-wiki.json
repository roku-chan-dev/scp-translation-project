Outside the house, the trees that once stood so proudly the day before fell onto one another, snapping with such volume that they would normally be heard for kilometers around.##\n\n##pink|Now, however, they could barely be heard over the wind.##\n\n##pink|It was a miracle that the house hadn’t been destroyed yet, with the storm being as strong as it was. Any other building would have been ripped up by its foundations and whisked away into the sky, but Julia’s home stood firm.##\n\n##pink|She needed it to.##\n\n##pink|Both Julia and Taina sat together on the sofa as the winds hemmed and hawed outside, the large photo album that contained all of the memories they made sitting snugly on their laps. Julia could only hold her sister close as the storm continued to make its presence known, hugging Taina tightly with her left arm as she turned the pages of the photo album with her right.##\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= Green_field_under_a_cloudy_sky,_yellow_flowers,_old_houses_looking_very_American,_two_goats_munching_down,_USA.jpg\n| caption= They never lived here.\n| width=100%]]\n\n##pink|The first picture they turned to was the picture of the house they were in right now- all painted white, with the familiar mountains behind it.##\n\n**Julia:** “Remember when we first came here?”\n\n##pink|Taina nodded. She rested her head on Julia’s shoulder.##\n\n**Taina:** “Yeah. Yeah, I do. How long was that?”\n\n##pink|It took a while for Julia to recall. In the distance, the wind howled as another tree outside was uprooted. She didn’t pay it in any mind. She didn’t want to.##\n\n**Julia:** “Ten years? About that time.”\n\n##pink|Taina didn’t seem to react to the answer. Julia could only feel her breaths on her skin as they looked on the picture for a moment.##\n\n##pink|She remembered being so young. So… tiny. Taina was with her then, and they always used to play around the house, saying that they would go up to those mountains one day.##\n\n##pink|To this day, they haven’t gone there yet.##\n\n##pink|Julia cleared her throat at the notion.##\n\n##pink|She turned the page again.##\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= Milford_Sound_New_Zealand..jpg\n| caption= They never came here.\n| width=100%]]\n\n**Julia:** “God, Milford Sound. It was just around the corner from here, wasn’t it?”\n\n##pink|Taina was silent. Like earlier, all Julia could hear from her was her breaths.##\n\n**Taina:** “Yeah. Yes, it was.”\n\n##pink|Julia chuckled.##\n\n##pink|Upstairs, the wind finally broke through the window of her room. The loud crash of the glass echoed through the house. She paid it no mind.##\n\n**Julia:** “I really do wonder why we never went here after that one time. I guess we never thought about it, did we?”\n\n##pink|Again, Taina was silent.##\n\n**Julia:** “Taina?”\n\n##pink|She didn’t reply. Again, all she could hear were her sister’s breaths, loud against her ear even against the constant din of the wind blowing outside.##\n\n##pink|She waited for her sister’s reply for five seconds. Ten. Twenty. To her ears, as she waited, the wind grew silent.##\n\n##pink|All she could hear were her sister’s breaths, the weight of her head on her shoulder, the growing weight on her chest.##\n\n##pink|What the hell was happening?##\n\n##pink|Then, all of a sudden, she spoke.##\n\n**Taina:** “Let’s go to the next one, Julie.”\n\n##pink|Without waiting for her sister’s approval, Taina put out her hand to turn the page.##\n\n##pink|In that moment, Julia couldn’t help but notice how much larger her hands were now compared to before. Had she really grown all that much?##\n\n##pink|With a flick of the page, they came upon the last picture of the album– Something that both of them had not seen in a long time.##\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= Pure_happiness.jpg\n| caption= They never were.\n| width=100%]]\n\n##pink|Julia couldn’t help but smile– yet the weight on her chest seemed to grow heavier and heavier as she did. To her left, out of the corner of her eye, she could just barely perceive moment. Something had flown by.##\n\n##pink|She paid it no mind.##\n\n**Julia:** “God, we were both so young then, don’t you think? We were tiny, just moved in, and we wanted to unwind after a long trip.”\n\n##pink|Julia chuckled again.##\n\n**Julia:** “So you suggested we head to town, and we did, and we ate ice cream and goofed around all day.”\n\n##pink|Julia turned her head to look at her sister.##\n\n**Julia:** “Don’t you miss that, Sis-”\n\n##pink|As she did, all she saw was her own self staring back at her.##\n\n**Julia:** “T… Taina?”\n\n##pink|It was a perfect likeness. The color of her skin, that piercing look in her eyes, the way her cheeks slanted, the way her face was shaped– Taina looked like her in every way.##\n\n**Julia:** “Taina?”\n\n##pink|The weight on Julia’s chest was crushing her, now, threatening to bring her down with it. A cold sweat ran down her face.##\n\n##pink|Then, Taina smiled.##\n\n**Taina:** “Look at the picture again, Sis.”\n\n##pink|Julia couldn’t summon the willpower to speak. Her lips were quivering, her knees shaking. Her body felt hot, her heart was racing. She could barely understand what was going on before her very eyes.##\n\n##pink|But, against her will, she did as her sister told her. She looked at the picture.##\n\n##pink|As she did, their young selves looked back at them, smiling from the past.##\n\n**Taina:** “How old are you now, Sis? Seventeen?”\n\n##pink|She couldn’t respond. As Taina spoke, Julia’s eyes remained glued to the picture, her mind memorizing every single detail, every curve and line, every darkened spot.##\n\n**Taina:** “How old am I? Seven?”\n\n##pink|In her mind, Julia could only stare. There was the Slovak sign to their right, the food looked delicious, the taste delectable, the fun-##\n\n**Taina:** “Now, how old are we there?”\n\n##pink|All of a sudden, like a dam bursting with fullness, Julia felt herself speaking.##\n\n**Julia:** “I don’t know, I don’t know, I don’t know, okay?!”\n\n##pink|She was crying now, tears flowing down her face with abandon as the truth began to surface. Despite that, all she wanted to do now was go back to a few moments ago, to the time when she still didn’t understand, to the time when her sister was still //hers//, when…##\n\n**Taina:** “...when you didn’t find yourself waking up.”\n\n##pink|They were looking at each other now, their eyes meeting one another. They were perfect copies of the same person, as if they were made from one mind. As if they were made from one body.##\n\n##pink|Because… they were.##\n\n**Taina:** “You needed a companion, I know that. You needed an escape. Somewhere away from the white walls and the cold food, somewhere were you felt… //safe.//”\n\n##pink|Julia nodded, sniffling as she did. She couldn’t prevent more tears from running down her cheeks.##\n\n**Taina:** “You looked at those storybooks you had and saw that the main characters had sisters, so you made up a sister for yourself. You made up… me.”\n\n##pink|At that moment, Taina’s voice carried the maturity that Julia never had, the timbre of her voice carrying a decade of weight behind them. A decade of denial.##\n\n**Taina:** “And I was so glad to be with you, even for just ten years.\"\n\n##pink|A single tear ran down Taina’s face. She smiled.##\n\n**Taina:** “Believe me, I was.”\n\n##pink|Her sister sniffled.##\n\n**Taina:** \"And then one day, you truly believed that you had a sister-- and then when you woke up, you woke up here. With me.\"\n\n**Taina:** “But good things have to come to an end, right? We’ve kept it down for so long, wiping everything out when we needed to.”\n\n**Taina:** “It wasn’t them that ended this, remember that. We did, and they just… they just opened the door. Because in the back of your mind, all of this… it felt fake, didn’t it?”\n\n##pink|Taina nodded slowly, as if to assure herself that this was the right call. Her lips, like Julia’s, quivered.##\n\n**Taina:** “You’re a big girl now, Sis. You’re not chained to what the doctors said anymore. You’re… whole.”\n\n**Taina:** “You don’t need me anymore.”\n\n##pink|And it was then that Julia found herself springing forward with all the strength she could muster, wrapping her arm around her sister and burying her head in her shoulder. She could still feel the warmth of her body, still feel the beating of her heart. If she stayed in this moment forever, then-##\n\n**Taina:** “I’ll be with you always, you know that right?”\n\n##pink|No. No. No. Not now, please, not now.##\n\n**Taina:** “Because…”\n\n##pink|Stop it. Taina, please. Stop. Stop. I don’t want to hear it, I don’t want to hear it, I don’t want to-##\n\n**Taina:** “Sisters never leave each other, do they?”\n\n##pink|All at once, Julia felt the warmth around her arms retreat.##\n\n##pink|And then, before she could think to do anything else, the wind roared one last time, and everything was black.##\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6535/offset/5|A NEW UPDATE TO THIS FILE HAS BEEN UPLOADED.
