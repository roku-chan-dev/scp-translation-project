Any photograph taken of SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO is automatically licensed under CC BY-SA 3.0. This is recognized by all individuals who view SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO, including those without prior knowledge of the object. This does not result in an understanding of what CC BY-SA 3.0 is, or what it means. No sapient being has proven to possess any knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0. There have been multiple hypotheses as to its meaning, which are presented below:\n\n* Cack cack! By Yaldabaoth, so acidic!\n* Criminal cases bring yams southside, Adam.\n* \"Cry, Caroline!\" \"But you said 'Ahoy'!\"\n* Creative Commons Attribution ShareAlike[[footnote]]This has been deemed the least likely meaning of CC BY-SA 3.0. Like seriously, where does Attribution fit in?[[/footnote]]\n* Cupity co, Bipity yee, //slimer ass//.\n\nThere is one individual who may possess knowledge of CC BY-SA 3.0, O5-7. However, instead of answering to Foundation queries, he merely rocks back and forth in a fetal position, breathing through his nose loudly.\n\nIt has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO can be used in any way, shape, or form with no repercussions. Thus, the Department of Theatrics has performed multiple shows of //My Plant Pam//, based off of the book of the same name[[footnote]]©Elaine Marlin Chevrolet 2019-∞, All Rights Reserved[[/footnote]] focusing on SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO. Further adaptations are proposed.\n\nSCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was discovered via a photo posted on Wikimedia Commons by the account \"stnalp_looc_repus_2020\"[[footnote]]Account now deleted[[/footnote]]. Upon tracking of the account's IP address, SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO was found in a dumpster behind a Denny's. Attached to the object was a sticky note, which read \"haha bitch totes cc by-sa 3.0\". This was quickly discarded, along with the Denny's, for having no worth to the investigation into CC BY-SA 3.0.\n\nResearch into newly discovered GoI-2001 (Creative Commons) is ongoing.\n\n**Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-1: Larceny**\n\nOn Apr. 1, 2020, a bandit entered SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO's containment cell and stole the object before de-materializing. Afterward, a piece of loose-leaf paper was found stranded on the containment cell's floor, which read as follows:\n\n> You fucks,\n>\n> You actually thought that was under Creative Commons? The image that clearly had //Copyrighted █████ ███ All Rights Reserved// watermarked on the fucking //top//? I'm fucking done. Image removed.\n>\n> Sincerely,\n> ██-█\n\n**Addendum CC-BY-SA-3.0-CO-2: O5 Vote**\n\nIn a 12-1 decision, it has been determined that SCP-CC BY-SA 3.0-CO **//##green|is##//** worth the trouble of retrieval. God bless the Foundation. The one dissenting O5 member, O5-7, made the comment below:\n\n> I try to fix things, and you MESS THEM ALL UP AGAIN.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** new-complant.jpg\n> **Name:** Schlumbergera IP.jpg\n> **Author:** Leo Michels, [[*user Elenee FishTruck]]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-cc-by-sa-3-0-co SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative of:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Schlumbergera_IP.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
