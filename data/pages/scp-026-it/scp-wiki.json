Translated to EN [[user Subervos]].\n[[/<]]\n[[include info:end]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-026-IT\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-026-IT is currently contained in a standard humanoid containment chamber at [[[siti-italiani#Sito-Iride|Site Iride]]]. A 10L water tank is installed in the containment chamber, and human blood[[footnote]]Blood type is irrelevant.[[/footnote]] is pumped into the tank using a special hydraulic system every 12 hours. In the event of a malfunction, which is frequently caused by unexpected blood clotting, the water tank must be replaced by two D-Class[[footnote]]The personnel should be familiar with how to handle hydraulic assemblies.[[/footnote]] personnel whenever SCP-026-IT requires nourishment. SCP-026-IT must be in the capsule provided before the D-Class personnel are deployed, and must remain in the capsule until the replacement is completed.\n\nSCP-026-IT's containment chamber is provided with a cylindrical capsule, 1 meter in diameter and 2 meters in height, used to transport SCP-026-IT. This capsule must be used for any transport of SCP-026-IT outside the designated containment chamber. The capsule is equipped with two auxiliary reservoir water tanks each containing 2.5L to supply human blood to SCP-026-IT via intravenous injection continuously. The capsule is designed to allow excessive pressure to disperse along the 2-cm-thick plexiglass on the outer surface. The capsule is also provided with a steel exoskeleton, which serves both as reinforcement to the capsule and as a secondary barrier to protect personnel from SCP-026-IT. The capsule has ventilation systems at the top and bottom. The only entrance into the capsule is at the top.\n\nSCP-026-IT's containment chamber is equipped with a bathtub measuring 1.5m × 1.5m × 2m, and blood diluted in distilled water is always filled to allow the subject to use when nutrition is needed. The walls of the bathtub consist of 5-cm-thick one-sided transparent glass plates. A motion-sensing surveillance camera is installed outside the bathtub to monitor SCP-026-IT's behavior in the bathtub through the glass.\n\n**Description:** SCP-026-IT is a Slavic female, allegedly of Russian nationality, approximately 30 years of age. Subject's eyes are green and hair is red, standing 1.7 m tall, and weighing 60 kg.[[footnote]]This measure varies depending on the amount of blood absorbed.[[/footnote]] SCP-026-IT is capable of speaking and acting like a normal human. SCP-026-IT's eyes emit mild green light due to bioluminescence, with the amount of light emitted varying depending on the amount of blood present in SCP-026-IT's body. Furthermore, SCP-026-IT's scalp follicles have a very irregular hair cycle, repeating a period of excessive hair growth followed by intense periods of hair loss that eventually lead to total baldness.\n\nSCP-026-IT consistently displays symptoms of acute radiation syndrome, including: epidermal degeneration and spontaneously presenting burns upon exposure to high doses of radiation, periods of delirium[[footnote]]SCP-026-IT also reported numerous cases of hallucinations.[[/footnote]] and emesis, followed by spontaneous formation of internal bleeding. SCP-026-IT also displays symptoms of radiation sterility, apart from the aforementioned anomalies described above, the entity presented an unusually regular menstrual cycle.\n\nSCP-026-IT cannot consume solid or liquid food and can only obtain nutrients from human blood, preferably intravenously. SCP-026-IT is also capable of absorbing liquids, with a maximum viscosity of two times that of water through its skin due to the subject's cellular structure, which is currently under research. For ease of ingestion, it is recommended to dilute the blood in water to reduce its viscosity and make it 'drinkable' through the skin.\n\nSCP-026-IT's stem cells, in general, are unable to generate healthy cells, which constantly mutate and frequently become non-functional cells. The only way for SCP-026-IT to carry out efficient cell regeneration is through the absorption of nutrients present in the blood. It is hypothesized that SCP-026-IT stem cells have high proliferative capacity, but in the absence of necessary nutrients, they do not appear to be capable of forming healthy cells. Microscopic examination of various tissue samples of SCP-026-IT has shown how such regeneration is capable of generating cells that are not normally regenerable for a human being.\n\n**Addendum:** All research on SCP-026-IT's properties is presently halted.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: SCP-026-IT Acquisition Process Document \" hide=\"➤ Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 5px; border: dashed 1px #444444; background: #F5F5F5; float: top; width: 96.5%; padding: 10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[include component:image-block name=http://fondazionescp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-026-it/026-IT.png| caption=Scan of SCP-026-IT's disappearance flyer, under the name \"Veronika Lagounova\", dating back to 1973.

The family was later informed of their daughter's death due to medical complications.| width=300px]]\nSCP-026-IT was discovered by an agent of the Russian Branch of the SCP Foundation, infiltrating a military hospital in Russia, on 02/21/1972; --the reason for the presence of SCP-026-IT in a military hospital rather than a civilian one is unknown-- where it was taken by the military patrol that made the discovery. SCP-026-IT was under the jurisdiction of the Russian Branch at Biological Site-23 until May 12, 1993, when it was transferred indefinitely to the Italian Branch of the Foundation. Immediately after the transfer, Dr. Sokolova was assigned as the chief containment researcher.\n\n@@@@\nAs noted in Document VIUS/026-IT/12.2, SCP-026-IT was transferred to the Italian Branch of the Foundation at the direct request of Dr. Sokolova. This is a measure that allows more meticulous research and seeks to ensure more effective containment as the Russian Branch does not have a specialized facility for humanoid object containment, such as Site Iride. For other information regarding the transfer, refer to the corresponding document attached to this SCP-026-IT document.\n@@@@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: Administrative Document VIUS/026-IT/12.2 \" hide=\"➤ Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background-color : #ede4cc; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px; text-align: center\"]]\n[[size 125%]]{{SITE VIRTUS ADMINISTRATIVE DIVISION}}[[/size]]\n[[size 120%]]{{Published and approved by the Superintendence Committee on 20/06/1995}}[[/size]]\n-----\n{{The Administrative Council of Site Virtus has decided to prohibit access to document VIUS/026-IT/12.2 to all personnel below Level 026/4, under order of the Superintendence Committee.

Unlike healthy blood, which SCP-026-IT physically requires and is constantly supplied with, infected blood appears to cause SCP-026-IT to become addicted to the blood regardless of the disease it carries. If healthy blood enters the body, SCP-026-IT can withstand up to five hours without exhibiting symptoms of acute radiation syndrome.\n\nAt 19:17, SCP-026-IT, during a psychotic episode, managed to break through the door of its containment chamber with unprecedented force and killed 8 personnel. From what was deduced from the recordings and the survivors' report, it attacked and killed the staff solely in self-defense to continue into the facility. Based on the route taken by SCP-026-IT, it is presumed that it was headed toward the IRDE/STC-06 storage area in hopes of finding more infected blood. It is currently unknown how SCP-026-IT knew the route.\n\nAt 19:43, with the intervention of appropriately armed security personnel in full-coverage hermetic suits and armed with stun-only weapons, SCP-026-IT was quickly contained in a temporary containment cell, whilst personnel Dr. Ingargiola Giuseppe and containment technician Prof. Maurizio Piombo were tasked with examining the water tank and the original containment chamber of SCP-026-IT to better understand the subject's behavior. Once the contaminated blood was discovered and replaced with clean blood, SCP-026-IT was transported to its cell. Addendums #1 and #2 were proposed and approved after the incident on 05/25/2002.\n\n**Addendum #1:** --Following Incident 026-IT-01, Dr. N. Sokolova requested reclassification of the subject from Safe to Euclid.-- Changed on May 31, 2002.\n\n**Addendum #2:** Following Incident 026-IT-01, the blood supplier company was replaced to ensure strict control of the blood to a cleaner state. - Dr. Ingargiola Giuseppe.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@@@\n[[collapsible show=\"➤ File: Interview Transcript 026-IT-D-1\" hide=\"➤ Close\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 5px; border: dashed 1px #444444; background: #F5F5F5; float: top; width: 96.5%; padding: 10px\"]]\n@@@@\n**Interviewed:** SCP-026-IT\n@@@@\n**Interviewer:** Dr. N. Sokolova\n@@@@\n**Date and Time:** 22/12/1990 10:15\n@@@@\n**Note #1:** To facilitate conversation with SCP-026-IT, the interview was conducted entirely in Russian, and the relevant translation is provided below. Dr. Sokolova is assigned to be the interviewer because she is fluent in Russian as well as being the permanent researcher on the anomaly.\n@@@@\n**Note #2:** The following log is an excerpt from an interview with SCP-026-IT-A, given to the Italian Branch of the SCP Foundation by the Russian Branch along with the rest of the documentation regarding SCP-026-IT.\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log 10:15>**\n[[/=]]\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** All right, we're all set. SCP-026-IT, let's get started.\n@@@@\n//SCP-026-IT throughout the interview demonstrates an attitude characterized by anxiety, stuttering, and trembling.//\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** If you don't mind, you can call me Veronika...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** That won't be necessary. Can we start?\n@@@@\n//Although the reason for this is unknown, SCP-026-IT appears to be more intimidated by Dr. Sokolova than other Foundation personnel. Among these reactions are swallowing of saliva, and trying to avoid eye contact, especially when asked by the doctor.//\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** Okay...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** So, first of all, what do you know about your condition?\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** I have always been affected by a congenital syndrome. They wanted to name it after me, but I think right now my name only appears in my obituary...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** Please don't digress. Do you know what this syndrome consists of?\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** Sorry… My immune system was spontaneously attacking a variety of my tissues, resulting in symptoms similar to necrotizing fasciitis when it attacked superficial tissues... Doctors thought they could use immunosuppressant drugs to calm the symptoms...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** You are not currently taking immunosuppressant drugs, so I assume the therapy was changed some time ago.\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** Yes... Immunosuppressant drugs were not enough, so they were discontinued... The biggest fear of the doctors was that my immune system would attack the nerve or bone tissue... Then one day I was offered to move to Russia, to a place bordering Siberia for an intensive research session. From what I've heard there are a lot of people who were sick like me from all over the world...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** Who offered you this opportunity? The same doctors who were treating you?\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** Yes... They said they had received funds for the study of particularly rare diseases like mine... But I suppose that was a lie, since the only memories I have of those days are of me falling asleep on the journey on the way out... I have no memories of that time, none at all...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** What are your earliest memories after that period of emptiness?\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** I remember waking up in a military hospital, being told that a military patrol found me in an abandoned factory on the Siberian border, naked, alone, and unconscious... They were shocked that I had survived more than an hour in that state in the middle of Russian winter...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** And how were you? I mean, how are you now or how were you before the trip?\n@@@@\n**SCP-026-IT:** Right now... I spent in that hospital a few days before I was taken and detained indefinitely by you guys...\n@@@@\n**Dr. N. Sokolova:** I see… This should be enough. Thank you for your patience.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n**<End Log 10:32>**\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Dottssa_Riba_Nahi, translated by Subervos]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 026-IT.png\n> **Name:** girl_red_hair_green_eyes_portrait_beauty-834557.jpg\n> **Author:** Ignoto\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.it\n> **Source Link:** https://pxhere.com/ko/photo/834557\n> **Notes:** Edited by Dottssa_Riba_Nahi\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
