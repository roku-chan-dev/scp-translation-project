My finished work, works in progress, and the work of the authors and artists I work closely with across all mediums can be found here. I also have a section dedicated to works from the wiki that inspire me. Also a big fan of Kenneth Hite and Brian Daley.\n> \n> Got a question? Want to tell me my work is awful? Want to look into possibly collaborating? Hit me up on [https://x.com/NapalmsHooch Twitter (X)] or through the Wikidot PM system.\n> \n> If (for some odd reason) you really like what I'm putting out, you can sauce me a couple bucks on [https://ko-fi.com/napalmdoctor556 Ko-fi]. Jokes aside, I really do appreciate it. I think it's every creators dream to make money off of what they put out, and by donating you're helping me do just that. Looking to throw out some designs for patches, stickers, stuff like that so there's something physical to show for all of this.\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Finished Work]]\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7741\nA massive amphibian stored within the Runit Dome by the United States. Due to the potential for extensive loss of materials and personnel, direct research and containment efforts have been halted as of August 16th, 1964.\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fbi-uiu-updated-2018orientation\nA supplemental for The Arachne universe FBI UIU. This onboarding dossier for incoming Special Agents in 2018 details some of the factions, terminology and important locations that new agents will encounter. An important document for any greenhorn. Comes with some words of morale boosting encouragement from one Executive Assistant Director William Doucet.\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-snowman\nBrian Upshur, Special Agent in the DEA Paranarcotics Division, is dispatched to rural Romania to investigate a trafficking operation alongside French allies. Unfortunately for him, this is more than just a simple jump out operation. Part of \"The Arachne\", a collaborative canon coming soon to the SCP wiki.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Sandboxes and Drafts]]\n- https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/collab:napalm-usodysseus\nA collaborative piece with author USOdysseus (check out his work on this hub!). This is meant to act as an expansive hub, and basis for a collection of stories that will be added piece by piece. By far the largest project I have ever worked on.\n\n- https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/incense-and-peppermints\nA Coldest War tale about a disenfranchised Nalkan, his new students among the Montagnards, and opportunistic Americans who believe they have a new ally in their Asian conquest.\n\n\n- https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/napalm-brazil-federal-occult-security-force-goi-descrip\nA Brazilian veil enforcement agency under the National Public Security Force of Brazil. Created shortly after the collapse of a military agency under the dictatorship of Brazil. Now officially part of \"The Arachne\"\n\n- https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/the-pentagram-hub-wip\nA long term project that will develop as I learn syntax and find the free time to work on it. A hub for all articles and tales that focus on or mention The Pentagram.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Inspiration]]\nA fairly exhaustive list of SCP articles that I really enjoy, and that I try to draw inspiration from. Big shoutout to the authors. Additions are likely.\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5108\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3874\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4406\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4776\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5050\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5323\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5525\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5778\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2498\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3256\n\n- http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-111-vn\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7269\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/paralaw\n\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/uiu-file-1972-055\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Stuff My Friends Made]]\n- https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:sleepydancho-s-art-taqueria\nVery talented and very open for commissions SleepyDancho. She made the Pentagram insignia in my header, so go sauce her page an upvote and check out her other work!\n\n- http://parikami.wikidot.com\nVery talented writer who has helped me out more than I can say regarding wiki sytax and page formatting. Non-site wikidot, and she hasn't posted much of her own work here, but it'll be worth it when she does.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
