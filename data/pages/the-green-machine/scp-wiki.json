He didn't intend to give her any more of a reason than he gave most people, but that still left a worryingly wide margin for error.\n\n\"You work with Dr. Lillihammer, right?\" she asked, as they strolled the corridors. \"I almost met her at that Site-01 conference, but I had to cancel.\"\n\n//Walk and talk, aren't we cool,// he thought. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Pyongyang,\" she said bluntly. \"The Foundation isn't super popular up North, and they give us trouble from time to time so we don't always get the chance to socialize.\" She looked at him appraisingly. \"What do you know about Korea, anyway? I thought they'd send a security expert.\"\n\nBlank counted on one hand. \"I know it's two countries in all countries but one, I know there was a war, and I know I like Kimchi.\"\n\n\"Everyone likes Kimchi. But seriously.\"\n\n\"I know Site-64K, which sounds like a computer thing but isn't, is in Mujin... which is basically Silent Hill by the Sea. And I know you've been fighting... environmental entropy terrorists?\" He squeaked out that last term to underline his uncertainty. \"And I don't know much of anything about 13K.\"\n\n\"That's why they picked you, right? For your genteel air of know-nothingness?\"\n\n\"For this trip, you mean, or in general?\"\n\nShe sighed. \"Anyway. Jeju Island is the largest chunk of South Korea not on the mainland, a self-governing, self-sufficient district. It's also a potentially live volcano, and the topography means that there's no single area large enough for the facilities we wanted to build here. 13K is actually eight separate compounds, built up in the decades after Six-Two-Five and consolidated under one command just five years ago.\"\n\n\"What's 625 got to do with it?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Six-Two-Five. The 25th of June, 1950. The beginning of what you call the Korean War.\"\n\n\"Oh.\" //Nice job, historian.// \"So, how do you manage all those degrees of separation?\"\n\n\"Our primary MTF is stationed at the island centre. Each sub-Site has its own security contingent, and if they need direct intervention, we fly it in.\"\n\nHe frowned. \"Sounds... slow.\"\n\nShe laughed. \"It's slow here anyway.

Beyond Entropy.\"\n\n\"Right, that's who I was thinking of. Ra's al Ghul.\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"What?\"\n\n\"Batman villain. Ecoterrorist.\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Not sure why you think I'd know that, but sure. Yeah. Ecoterrorists. A loose coalition of 'cells' — they're big on biological metaphors — dedicated to protecting mother Earth from external entropy. Human interference with natural systems.\" She rolled her eyes. \"By interfering with human systems. Especially ours.\"\n\n\"Why especially yours? Ours?\"\n\n\"Because Jeju Island is a world heritage site with some of the best untouched wilderness in the region. It's not subject to the whims of mainland politicians, and the permanent population is low... but it gets about fifteen million tourists every year, and we're seeing some pollution.\" They reached a glass-walled conference room. \"That's our fault, for some reason.\"\n\n\"Groups of Interest, man.

He sat in the server room, head between his knees, letting the soft buzzing of the machinery calm his stomach. //I hate water,// he thought. //I hate the sea.//\n\nThere was a gentle //ping// from his pocket, and he sat up suddenly. This was a mistake; he nearly vomited, again, into the wastepaper basket beside the server. Nearly, but not quite, because he pulled out his phone and saw the notification.\n\n//The deal is on.// Surprise momentarily overwhelmed his nausea. Beyond Entropy had engaged in a costly battle with Site-13K not five years prior, so the idea that a Foundation employee would willingly deal with them was... well, it was unlikely. He'd expected a trap; he was still expecting a trap. His cell had been insistent, though: this was too important an opportunity to pass up. It was worth the risk.\n\n//My stomach begs to differ.// He forced himself to stand, legs wobbling, guts churning. He wondered if he'd ever get those mythical 'sea legs'. //Oh, how weak the flesh.// For the briefest of moments, he wished he'd joined a more radical cult.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image BE.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nBlank tucked his tie under the labcoat flaps, and began buttoning buttons. He felt vaguely ridiculous, but that wasn't a problem. //Ridiculous is good. Ridiculous is innocuous.//\n\nHe stood on the deck of the unnamed Foundation cutter as it plied the waves between Jeju and the Chuja Islands. Hwang stood beside him, looking quite at home in the choppy waters; he was thankful now for a childhood which had included sailboat outings on Lake Huron. He didn't want to vomit up the anomaly rolling around in his tired brain.\n\nHwang pointed. \"There she is.\" The Beyond Entropy vessel was visible on the far horizon, steaming from Lower Chujado. \"They must have been hiding behind the island, waiting for our message.\"\n\n\"Waiting for their //contact's// message.\" They'd been thrilled to learn, from said contact's files, that his payment would be a dossier of classified info on a series of Groups of Interest operating in the area. Presumably, he'd meant to fence the data for a high price. Hwang couldn't wait to get her hands on it, but Blank had... concerns. \"Has it occurred to you that I don't look very Korean?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"It's the Foundation. Lots of ethnic variety.\"\n\n\"Yeah, but most of the Korean Sites are mostly... Korean. That's the reason for the \"K,\" right? Not all of your staff speak English, because not all the best minds in Korea do.\"\n\nShe shrugged again. \"I think the reason for the \"K\" is Overwatch being colonial, hogging all the good numbers for North America. But seriously, this doesn't matter. You might be more likely to be Korean, if you're from 13K, but it's not a guaranteed thing.\"\n\n\"I just don't like additional variables. We need them to believe I am who I'm... not, if this is gonna work.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"It'll work.

He's not above selling his fliers' parachutes, or their rations, or what have you. Capitalism at its finest.\" He smoothed out his buttoned, bulging labcoat; Lee had scrutinized that very carefully, before determining there were no weapons concealed within. \"That's what we're up to.\"\n\n\"A dangerous proposition. You even commandeered a Foundation vessel for this purpose?\"\n\n'Blank' laughed. \"I've got my fingers in every pie at Jeju, my friend. One small boat for a diplomatic mission was hardly a stretch.\" He held up both hands, and flexed each finger. \"I have very flexible phalanges.\"\n\n//Is this guy for real?// Lee shook his head again. //No, of course he's not, he didn't even give me a real name.// \"Fine, we'll see if you're telling the truth soon enough. Do you have the Word?\"\n\nA look of concern crossed the man's face, just for a fleeting moment, and Lee wondered if he'd overplayed his hand with the accidental internal terminology. But the moment passed, and the man nodded. \"If you've got the payment, I've got the password.\" He reached into his labcoat pocket and produced a notepad and a pen. \"Let me write it down, so we can confirm the transfer.\"\n\nLee nodded warily. \"What you write down should look like gibberish to me, right? Until I have the anomaly in my possession.\"\n\n'Blank', //just think of him as Blank,// nodded. \"That's right.\" He began writing on the pad, slowly, tongue stuck out of the side of his mouth. He wiped his forehead. He exhaled heavily. He turned the pad to face Lee, and Lee saw... nothing he understood. Alien symbols. Nonsense. He nodded.\n\n\"Hot in here.\" Blank placed the pad in his lap, pen still in hand, and unbuttoned his labcoat. \"Now, listen carefully,\" he said as the most garish tie Lee had ever seen came gradually into view. Incredibly, nonsensically, the man was wearing a hooded sweater beneath the tie.\n\n\"The manichean idol holds a key to the captive chaos,\" Blank intoned, as the last few inches of his swirling, technicolour tie swung out. Lee's breath caught. He saw stars in front of his eyes. He could see... he could //see...//\n\n\"I can see the letters!\" he cried, leaping up. \"I can see the Word!\"\n\nBlank smiled at him, climbing to his feet. \"That's good, 'cuz I can't.\" He turned the pad to face Lee; there it was, in blue and white, the magic phrase in messy script.\n\nLee took a PDA from his pocket, and was about to thank the man when the room exploded.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image BE.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHwang was in the captain's office when the second ship appeared, but because her skeleton crew was well-trained she'd been called back to the bridge just in time to see it open fire on the first ship.\n\n\"What the hell?\" A series of small explosions on one craft resulted in a series of large ones on the other. \"Who are these new assholes?\"\n\n\"//BES Choi Yul,//\" a bridge officer responded. \"Another BE vessel.\"\n\nThe //Moon Kook-hyun//'s hull slid aside, and two sleek cannons of unknown make and model began returning fire.

His eyesight went fuzzy, and for a moment he thought he might forget the sacred phrase... but no, it was still there. He felt relief, even as he realized he was clutching his chest and his hands were wet with blood.\n\n\"Stand down, and prepare to be boarded!\" Someone was shouting over the din with a very powerful speaker system, presumably from the attacking ship. \"Fire again, and we'll send your metal filth to the bottom of the ocean!\"\n\n\"Short-sighted tree huggers,\" he muttered.
