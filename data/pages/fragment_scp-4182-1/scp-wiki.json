These files are to be isolated and reported to the on-duty server administrator for review and sterilization. Personnel are to be reminded that there is no Site-5.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4182 is a phenomenon by which internal Foundation documents are periodically altered to include references to a non-existent site (\"Site-5\"). The mechanism by which this occurs has yet to be understood. \n\nDepictions of Site-5 are inconsistent, but typically describe it as a man-made island constructed to store hazardous materials.[[footnote]]Specifically, a containment site for anomalous waste.[[/footnote]] \n\nSince its discovery in 2018, SCP-4182's rate of occurrence has been increasing exponentially.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n++ 404 Internal Server Error\nThe server encountered an unexpected condition which prevented it from fulfilling the request: \n[[div style=\"color: white; font-family: Courier; font-weight: bold; display: inline-block; background:#000000; float:top; padding:5px; width:100%\"]]\n**##white|{{@@ Traceback (most recent call last):@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@   File \"/SCP/4182/files/_display.py\", line 551, in respond@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@     table.open.body = self.handler()@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@   File \"/SCP/4182/files/_display.py\", line 24, in __call__@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@     return self.callable(*self.args, **self.kwargs)@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@   File \"error_classic.py\", line 6 in index@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@     raise FileNotFoundError(obj)@@}}##**\n**##white|{{@@ FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'CAM-5.ogg'@@}}##**\n[[/div]]\n> **NOTE:** This document has encountered an unexpected condition.
