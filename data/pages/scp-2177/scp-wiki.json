Infections have been identified in 17 institutions, including ██ academic libraries, █ private collections, and the former non-classified public library of Site 11[[footnote]]Text based SCP objects at this site, including [[[SCP-986]]] have had their containment procedures updated to prevent potential infection by SCP-2177[[/footnote]].\n\nInfected institutions are to be infiltrated by at least two Level-2 personnel in supervisory positions, including at least one containment specialist with training in library/information science. SCP-2177 infections are to be quarantined in restricted collections or secure archives not open to the public. In order to avoid Alpha events, new instances of SCP-2177-1 must be shelved according to existing institutional policies. No attempt should be allowed to remove SCP-2177 infections from these institutions. Civilians exposed to SCP-2177-1 are to be detained and administered Class C amnestics.\n\nIn order to avoid Beta events, Regional Directors have been authorized to provide financial and political support required to keep infected institutions in operation. If a Beta event is unavoidable, [[[task-forces#alpha-4|Mobile Task Force Alpha-4 (\"Pony Express\")]]] is to intercept all deliveries of documents to vulnerable institutions and seize SCP-2177-1 instances until such time as a suitable institution can be infiltrated and infected.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2177 is a virus-like pathogen that targets libraries holding print subscriptions to large numbers (> 50) of technical journals. SCP-2177 takes the form of documentation requesting that a journal or document be added to the institution’s collection. This request is always in the correct format for the receiving institution, and occasionally includes misinformation suggesting a pre-existing record. Once SCP-2177 has been entered into the catalog in any capacity, its record is altered to indicate an ongoing subscription to a technical journal. This facilitates reproduction, with new instances of SCP-2177-1 arriving amongst existing subscriptions. Reproduction rates range from 1 item every three months to 1 item per month[[footnote]]Similarity between the vectors of transmission, and contagious nature of SCP-2177, [[[SCP-1866]]], and [[[SCP-2976]]] has been noted. Investigation into a potential shared origin for these phenomena is ongoing.[[/footnote]].\n\nSCP-2177-1 refers to the viral envelope of SCP-2177, which always takes the form of a 24 x 30 cm technical journal bound in yellow pasteboard. SCP-2177-1 always contains the SCP-2177 pathogen, although in advanced infections this may only consist of a tailored address label. SCP-2177-1 contents and findings are not anomalous, but always refer to large-scale unethical testing on human subjects. (Sample contents of SCP-2177-1 are available in Addendum 2177-01.)\n\nAlpha events occur when infected institutions intentionally discard new instances of SCP-2177-1, attempt to physically remove all SCP-2177-1 instances, or attempt to eliminate SCP-2177 from the catalog. SCP-2177 infections have been shown to adapt to these threats in the following ways:\n- Drastically increasing reproduction rates (up to 1 item per week).\n- Subdividing to multiply reproduction (e.g dividing a title into Series A, B, and C)\n- Creating additional instances of infection under other titles and technical fields.\n\nBeta events occur when an SCP-2177 infection is successfully eliminated or when an infected institution ceases operation. In Beta events, SCP-2177 will be transmitted to other vulnerable libraries until at least one institution becomes infected. Transmission vectors include any shipment of documents to a library, including returned materials and large donations. SCP-2177 will initially target institutions with names or street addresses superficially similar to the previously-infected institution, but these criteria become less strict as transmission time increases.\n\n**Addendum 2177-01: Sample contents of SCP-2177-1**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access Archive\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n> **Format:**\n> **Subject matter:**\n> **Publication date:**\n> **Example article:**\n> **Findings:**\n> \n> **Subject matter:** Military aviation\n> **Publication date:** May 1947\n> **Example article:** Effective kill radius of 550-lb (sic) aerial bombs.\n> **Findings:** Detailed explanations of anatomical effects based on human subjects restrained at various distances from a static ground explosion.

Truman Presidential Library and Museum. Research findings and methodologies contained within this instance were identical to known research conducted under the guise of the //Kantōgun Bōeki Kyūsuibu Honbu//[[footnote]] Epidemic Prevention and Water Purification Department, the official cover for the Japanese Kwantung Army's covert chemical and biological warfare research program during the Second World War.[[/footnote]] between the years of 1935 and 1945. Although no SCP-2177 pathogen could be located, the following dedication was included on the front plate of the volume.\n\n> \n> Dear Mr. President,\n> \n> Based on your recent acquisitions, we are pleased to note your keen interest in our fields of research.
