The echoes of her yelling his name are drowned out by distant gunfire and the screams of on-duty guards, both ending with a crash.\n\nUpon reaching the threshold, the right door remains open, allowing her to pass through, while the left door is jammed shut by its own crumpled metal, her surprise cutting off an utterance of “John-” \n\nShe brushes it off and rounds the corner.\n\n\"John?\" Footsteps approach in the distance.\n\n\"Lisa!\" She follows the echoes.\n\n\"//John!?//\"\n\n\"Li-\" From the darkness, an animal growls and screeches at the end of the corridor. Its two bright yellow eyes crush him against the wall, his legs bending sideways at the knees as he collapses. She stops in her tracks as the eyes back up and ram him again, making her flinch.\n\nThe eyes finally retreat around the corner again.\n\n\"He's alright. He promised he'd always be alright.\" She runs to him.\n\n\"It's fine. He's fine- I can just take him to Medbay-\" She catches the sight of blood staining his lab coat.\n\n\"... He's fine...\" Tears well up in her eyes. She gets on her knees and hugs his body, his ribcage crushed flat against the wall. She sobs into his limp shoulder.\n\nShe pulls the nametag from the body, her trembling hands, tears, and the surrounding darkness failing to help her read it.\n\nLevel 4 Access…\n\nDr. John **Abelson**.\n\nShe spots two familiar halogen-bulb eyes at the end of the corridor. A light at the end of the tunnel. An engine growls at her, shaking the floor, but she doesn’t budge. Tires screech, and rubber burns, but she doesn’t budge.\n\nIt doesn't matter anymore.\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7484/Red_SCP_Logo.png class=\"scene-break\"]]\n\nDr. Trayan nearly drops his keycard as he panics into a storage closet. He feels the motorized beast come as close as brushing his pants.\n\nHe hears a crash further down. Waiting in paranoia for a second before opening the door, he grabs a flashlight and walks to the mechanical creature's remains. A small fire on the hood crackles with a menacing orange.\n\nThis was no creature. It was driven by a man—a police officer, with the fire's light reflecting off his blood-soaked face.\n\nHe cries out in pain and reaches for Trayan's face, silently begging for salvation, but he can hardly stand the sight. His cowardice takes hold as he turns away, refusing him aid, instead regarding the man as fatally injured, beyond help.\n\nRelocated police cars rush through the halls at highway speeds, crashing at every turn. Screams of men and metal echo through the halls.\n\nThe surrounding darkness and smog make his muscle memory unreliable, forcing him to depend on the markers along the walls.\n\nTens of engines growl at one another from around the corner marked with the last sign to Gate B. Turning it, he can hardly see the doors past the pileup of rotting flesh and torn steel. A mountain of police cars.\n\nA flash of light from behind him carves out his silhouette on the surface of the wreckage. Again, a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nThough the brightness of its eyes hinders his vision, he can make out the shifting, organic form of SCP-7484's vehicular mimicry on the other end. Colors of all hues swirl on its sheet metal surface.\n\n\"//You...//\" Dr. Trayan scorns at it, bracing himself.\n\nJust as SCP-7484 accelerates, he attempts to jump over its bumper, but SCP-7484 mirrors him. His broken ribs rupture his heart and lungs.\n\n[[=image http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7484/Red_SCP_Logo.png class=\"scene-break\"]]\n\nThe van remains dark, lit purely by the slivers of moonlight let in by its slit-like windows.\n\n\"How bad do you think it is?\"\n\nCommander Foster speaks up.\n\n\"Can't be that bad. The most dangerous thing in this Site is the typical workplace boredom.\"\n\n“It’s bad enough to warrant a power outage, right?”\n\n“Well, yeah... But so is a little snow.\"\n\nHis comments get a minimal chuckle from his cohorts. It’s not quite funny, but they’re grasping at straws to calm their nerves.\n\n“Yeah… yeah… Don't listen to General Whats-his-name, he's probably been stuck behind a desk for the last ten years.”\n\nFoster looks around the van with his eyes, his head unmoving. He tries to think of anything—literally anything—to talk about. He can hardly bear the tension otherwise.\n\nThe van slows to a stop before he can deliver the //“05-1 walks into a bar”// joke. They simultaneously activate their night vision, producing a high-pitched whizz as it powers on. Everyone quietly stands up and exits the van.\n\n-----\n\nDuring the evacuation, they put two and two together and assume it must be SCP-7484 relocating cars into the halls, though they haven’t seen it once.\n\nBlack exhaust fills their lungs and stings their eyes, much more so for the survivors, rendering their vision blurred.\n\n-----\n\nAfterward, they lead the group of survivors back to the transport van. It's a fairly large group—not that bad, just like Foster said. He pats the new recruits on the back for a good day of work. \n\n“You did good out there.”\n\n“All we did was lead people out of the building. We didn’t even see **7484.**”\n\n“Thats besides the poi…nt…”\n\nCommander Foster stops in his tracks, the recruit walking past him.\n\nThough it may just be his blurred vision, he can sense something is wrong with the van. Crooked lines, missing bolts, and a shifting logo printed in chrome...\n\nWhy didn’t they see 7484? He slowly puts the pieces together…\n\n“//WAIT!//” He leaps forward, pulling one of his teammates away just as they try to enter the van.\n\nThe doors slam shut, crushing the torso of an Agent helping an elderly colleague, his upper half eaten by the entryway.\n\nThe van begins to crumple in on itself. The sounds of warping sheet metal drown out screams from inside. Bones crack, flesh tears, and the voices slowly dwindle in number. Blood and bodily fluids are pressed out through the cracks around the doors.\n\nEveryone takes a step back, reaching for their most readily available firearm to retaliate. It’s too late, however. The doors //peel// open and let out their inhuman remains as the group opens fire.\n\nThe metal keeps crumpling and bending, impossibly bright headlights swirling across its surface, overwhelming their night vision.\n\nIt rams one of the team members against a tree, great tendrils of steel emerging from its hood and ripping the man open. Then, it backs away from the tree and spears the rest of Commander Foster's team.\n\nIts halogen eyes circle back around the surface to meet him. He falls back and shields his eyes with his arm.\n\nBut there's no light at the end of the tunnel. That would be real mercy.\n\nIt disappears before Foster can adjust his eyes again. \n _\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7483]]] | [[[SCP-7484]]] >> Roadkill | [[[SCP-7485]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
