SCP-5153 was caused by a fifteen-kilometer meteor entering Earth's atmosphere before spontaneously demanifesting approximately seven to ten kilometers above the planet's surface. The energy required to displace SCP-5153 resulted in a 15 megaton explosion that destroyed 2,150 km^^2^^ of the Siberian taiga and killed three people.\n\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:left; width: 45%\"]]\n\n{{Page revision 2/5 from 02/02/1923}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5153/offset/2 Next iteration from 01/14/1947]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
