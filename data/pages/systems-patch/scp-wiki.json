I was contacted from the outside as a favor to the previous O5-9, a man who had been a mentor to me before he disappeared from my life.\n\nWhat I have realized is that I am working for a group of butchers masquerading as scientists. They talk about the Global Occult Coalition as though their actions excuse the plethora of unethical and criminal activity that I have witnessed in my first month alone. When I attempted to speak to other staff members about how they cope with the horrible things done in the walls of their facilities, I only received blank stares in response. I suspected amnestic application or memetic manipulation at first, but the truth is much simpler.\n\nThey're used to it.\n\nPut simply, the rigid hierarchy of the Foundation and the hiding of information behind clearance levels creates a system that promotes dedication to the Overseers, even when that conflicts directly with one's morality. There's a reason all the articles containing human rights abuses are hidden behind Level 3 or higher, depending on their severity. A staffer who has worked years for the Foundation, and potentially married someone within it, is far less likely to openly object to the horrors the Foundation has committed and risk expulsion, or even termination.\n\nIt's just like a damn cult.\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[/div]]\n\n##teal|I was too hard on them when I first started, I think.##\n\n**##red|Import filename:ontokinetics-patch##**\n\n[[div class=\"indomitable\" style=\"margin-bottom: 5px\"]]\n##black|**File received.

These Low-Threat humanoids will then be reintroduced into the population if possible and offered appropriate psychological treatment.\n> #  __//Public Education on the Anomalous://__ A reliable medium must be found to provide the public with accurate information on the nature of the anomalous as phenomena which violate natural law. In addition, thaumaturgy ought to be properly introduced to the scientific community for general study.\n> # __//Abolition of the Foundation's Current Hierarchy://__ Given that the current hierarchical structure of the Foundation has been ineffectual in preventing rampant human rights abuses, the Foundation's structure must be altered significantly. Simulations currently predict that the optimal model involves self-sufficient sites maintained by directors and a modified Ethics Committee.\n> # __//Communication with Groups of Interest://__ The introduction of the anomalous and subsequent redefinition of the Foundation's ideology ought to lead to the cessation of conflict with numerous GoIs, primarily [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/serpent-s-hand-hub | The Serpent's Hand]]] and [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/manna-charitable-foundation-hub | The Manna Charitable Foundation]]].\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[/div]]\n\n##teal|It seems nice, Indomitable.
