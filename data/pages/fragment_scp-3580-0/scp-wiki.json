No less than two Nu-7 units are to be immediately dispatched for appearances of SCP-3580.\n\nDisinformation campaigns have been initiated to conceal the nature of the Türkiye incident.

All known members are highly dangerous and possess various anomalous traits.##[[/span]].\n\nPhysically, SCP-3580 is 190 cm in height with tied black hair reaching down to its waist. Missing both its arms, SCP-3580 utilizes thaumaturgically enhanced prosthetics. The entity's ethnicity is unknown. \n\nWhile interactions with SCP-3580 have been scarce, it is known that it possesses incredible proficiency in close-quarters combat, specializing in the usage of edged weapons. It is also capable of moving and reacting at rapid speeds, with one instance displaying an estimated 65 km/h.\n\nIn addition, it has been found that SCP-3580 possesses an advanced degree of expertise in combat-related areas of thaumaturgy, utilizing these skills for primarily defensive purposes during observed conflicts.\n\nIt has been found through recovered correspondence that SCP-3580 is regarded as \"Inquisitor Proxima Ramexe\" among GOI-850 members.\n\n----\nSCP-3580-A is a humanoid entity, measuring roughly 400cm in height, belonging to GOI-850.\n\nPhysically, SCP-3580-A possesses thick wrapping around its entire body with metallic plates placed around the shoulders, shins, thighs, forearms, back, neck, jaw, and head. Its left arm has been replaced by a mounted sextuple-barreled Gatling gun of an unknown model, with built-in ammunition reserves along its figure.\n\nSCP-3580, alongside SCP-3580-A, has engaged in multiple raids on Foundation sites, leading to various numbers of casualties while stealing artifacts and documents, or releasing persons of interest. Contact with other under-the-Veil agencies has reported few but several occasions of being attacked or approached by, SCP-3580, SCP-3580-A, or other members of GOI-850.\n----\n= **Discovery:**\n----\nSCP-3580 was first observed on 18/2/1971 during a raid on Site-41 which resulted in the deaths of fourteen personnel. One person in this group was the Site Director, Malkin Fallen, who refused SCP-3580's demands for him to open containment cells on the lower floors as Mobile Task Force operatives moved in.\n\nWhen the incident concluded, several anomalous items were found to have been stolen, and an open terminal with level-3 submitted clearance entered was discovered. The terminal had been used to access all available topics relating to GOI-850, certain anomalies, and a brief attempt to uncover the location of Area-55 - the base of operations for Project Labyrinth investigations. This attempt was unsuccessful.\n\nNear the end of the incident, multiple MTFs were deployed to Site-41, including Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") and Epsilon 11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\"). However, they proved ineffective at stopping SCP-3580, resulting in its escape and subsequent disappearance.\n\nThat same year, SCP-3580-A was first observed during the failed detainment of POI-9112 [[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]##black|\"Kevin Gibson\", an identified affiliate of GOI-850. Wanted for human trafficking.##[[/span]]. During that incident, SCP-3580-A intervened, killing four operatives and injuring the fifth before proceeding to terminate POI-9112.\n\nBefore it fled, SCP-3580-A interacted with the fifth agent - Agent Mortimer Woodlock. A transcript of the after-action report has been provided below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n=  [[size 125%]]**Internal log - Woodlock and Riley dialogue**[[/size]]\n\n//Agent Woodlock and Senior Researcher Jackie Riley are seated in an interview room.//\n\n**Riley:** How're ya holding up, Morty?\n\n**Woodlock:** I've been better.\n\n**Riley:** Mm. I'm really, really sorry for what happened. I'm sure your team would be glad to know you survived. \n\n**Woodlock:** It's just a part of the job. Come on, Jacks, you brought me here for a sob story or what?\n\n**Riley:** Right. We wanted to know the specifics of what went on, on the twenty-first. What went wrong, what was that thing, just what happened?\n\n//Woodlock adjusts himself in his chair.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Well, it was all going smoothly. Got the bastard up in cuffs at his home and we were fixing to leave. To be honest, for all he did, just being held in a cell didn't seem like justice to me.\n\n**Riley:** What would have been justice, then?\n\n**Woodlock:** //Careful what you wish for// played a bit in my mind after the fact.\n\n**Riley:** Mm.\n\n**Woodlock:** So we'd just cuffed him up and we were just about to move out. Suddenly, Kamsky starts shouting in the back. Says \"Get down!\"... I don't think he was alive by the time he hit the deck.\n\n//Woodlock briefly pauses before continuing.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Bullets start spraying everywhere. Kamsky went first, then Rodriguez... Allison... and the Captain. Was lucky I got behind cover in the kitchen, so I grab Gibson and pull him down with me. Even luckier I only got nicked.\n\n**Riley:** I wouldn't say almost losing your leg was a \"nick\".\n\n//Woodlock leans forward with his elbow on his injured knee.//\n\n**Woodlock:** Sure, Jacks. Sure.\n\n**Riley:** Sorry.\n\n**Woodlock:** Now, as I was saying, I'm holding this idiot and he's screaming bloody murder. Of course, I can barely hear him since I didn't have my hearing protection in, and the gun show just started about twenty feet away.\n\n**Woodlock:** But even while Gibson's crying like a baby, I could feel something - a rumbling. There was a shadow on the wall, and it was coming towards us. I could barely move, so I crawl over to hide behind the kitchen counter. I try to drag Gibson with me, but - too late. He gets picked up.\n\n**Woodlock:** I look up and see this huge hulking thing standing there, hoisting Gibson by the neck. It's gigantic - has to get down on one knee just to fit in the room. Covered in what looked like roughed-up armor. Knight shit. It had these, these glowing green eyes that shot through the thing's mask. And a great big gun on one of its arms.\n\n//He leans back.//\n\n**Woodlock:** So it holds Gibson up and looks him in the eye. I can't hear what it says, and it looked like Gibson was just begging for his life. All I see after is a quick movement, just some shadows and a dust cloud falls from the wall. Gibson's brains are splattered everywhere, and his body falls backward from up on top the kitchen sink.\n\n**Woodlock:** So I try to scoot away. I'm losing a lot of blood, so I try to treat it at the same time. I'm panicking - not thinking straight. Then it noticed me.\n\n//His fists clench.//\n\n**Woodlock:** It nudges over and looms over me. My ears start to clear, and I can hear it speaking.\n\n**Riley:** What did it say?\n\n**Woodlock:** Couldn't make out exactly what, but it did say something along the lines of an apology. I tried to raise my gun - big fucking mistake.\n\n**Woodlock:** I take a shot at its face, it clocks me so hard in the arm the pistol goes flying and my hand feels twelve types of broken.\n\n//He raises his right arm, showcasing the cast.//\n\n**Woodlock:** It stands up and glares down at me with those cold eyes. It just stood there for like a minute, watching me writhing before it decided I wasn't worth it. I pass out and get rescued like a princess.\n\n**Riley:** I don't know what to say, Morty, I-\n\n**Woodlock:** You don't have to say anything. It's just part of the job. It's always just a part of the job.\n----\n[[/div]]\nThese incidents marked the first time either entity was observed before they both disappeared for a period of eight years.

This attempt was successful. A notice to Area-55's Site Director has been sent, and emergency lockdown procedures have been issued.\n\nThe following is a Project Labyrinth briefing pertaining to topics of GOI-850.\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n+++* GOI-850 / Order of the Archine Eclipse\n[[/=]]\n= ^^Presented by Senior Researcher Jackie Riley^^\n----\nGOI-850 is a highly secretive, loosely organized international religious group comprised of both standard and anomalous humanoids. Evidence of GOI-850's existence dates as far back as the 18th century, though it is believed that it has existed for far longer than that.\n\nGOI-850 has been credited with the theft of multiple items of interest to anomalous history - an undefined amount of the past that has either been forgotten or hidden from the Foundation or the general public. Such items that have gone missing range widely in subjects, from enchanted weaponry of old to evidence of the Siege of the Hearth.\n\nIt is believed that GOI-850 operates outside of multiple unknown locations, having spread out across the Earth following a failed attempt at securing their original facility in the early 1800s. After this attempt, however, GOI-850 went into an elongated state of dormancy as the mission had, purportedly, heavily crippled their ranks.\n\nGOI-850 is primarily maintained by an unknown number of enhanced humanoids - referred to as \"Knights\" - only one of which has been observed and contained by the Foundation, excluding SCP-3580 and SCP-3580-A. Analysis of this entity revealed a mixture of crude carnomantic[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]##black|Thaumaturgic manipulation of flesh and living matter.##[[/span]], technological, and thaumaturgical procedures had been performed on it, leading to its aforementioned augmentations.\n\nThe group is devoted to a figure known as \"Archine\", an ancient hero credited for having imprisoned multiple monsters, including a large bird-like beast that had been terrorizing a village.\n\nRecently, however, with the identification of POI-9112, it has become known that GOI-850 engages in acts of slavery. Thus far, no person having gone missing as a victim of POI-9112 has resurfaced.\n\nFurther details on GOI-850 are scarce, unprovable, or unknown. Investigations are ongoing.\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ **Addenda: 3580.2:**\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidebox\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= Morty |align=center|width=73%|caption=MTF Sigma-8 Captain Mortimer Woodlock.]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\nIn light of recent events, resources have been pooled into creating a temporary MTF unit solely for combatting and containing SCP-3580. This group, managed by Captain Mortimer Woodlock, utilizes several kinds of prototypical anomalous weaponry and armor selected to deal with the subject.\n\nCurrently, the team (Sigma-8 \"Hellbound Cavalry\") is composed of seven operatives picked from multiple high-ranking units, and chosen for having experience in close-quarters combat. Given the threat displayed during Incident-3580-1 and Incident-3580-2, proposals have been made for agents under Sigma-8 to undergo augmentation, pending approval.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n=  [[size 125%]]**Internal log - Woodlock and Samuel dialogue**[[/size]]\n\n//The two are talking as they walk through the upper facility of Area-55.//\n\n**Samuel:** This place might as well be a fortress, especially now on lockdown.

Personnel with clearance 4 have temporarily had their levels demoted to their lowest necessary access. Lockdown's a pain, but the safety of the site comes first.\n\n//Woodlock nods along.//\n\n**Samuel:** A team and I examined the recording of it fighting; while its technique is unorthodox, its most alarming facet, besides its swiftness, is its incredible strength. We'll have to better prepare your agents to counteract that attribute.\n\n**Woodlock:** Twelve good men and women dead for its sadistic pleasure. Do whatever it takes. We won't be burying any more.\n\n**Samuel:** Well, Captain, if you are approved for those augments, I'd imagine taking it on would be made much simpler. Tracking it has proved rather fruitless; the only lead we found was an attack on the GOC, which reported a description similar to SCP-3580 over a year ago. Killed the entire strike force of five mercenaries before kidnapping their target -  some reality bender kid.\n\n**Woodlock:** //Great//, so bupkis on where it is now?\n\n**Samuel:** Unfortunately so. We're working as quickly as possible to find anything on it, but between the roadblocks we're already facing and the fact that the woman may as well be a ghost, we'd be lucky to find a single somewhat worthwhile bead.\n\n//Samuel stops and stares down into the containment chasm.//\n\n**Samuel:** How's the team going? The director expressed their disapproval of this task force's creation, and I'd like something to show to hold them over.\n\n**Woodlock:** It's going about as well as it could be. Not many hiccups or problems. Hell, we even got a mage on the job.\n\n**Samuel:** So you think they'll be ready to deploy and combat SCP-3580 should the need arise?\n\n**Woodlock:** Maybe. I've been rushing them to get ready as quickly as they can manage since we only have one shot at this.\n\n**Samuel:** Take your time, Morty. It disappeared for years after its first appearance. \n\n**Woodlock:** Wouldn't be wise to depend on that. It disappeared because it screwed up. It couldn't get what it wanted so it hid from us, just like the first time we came knocking on their doorstep.\n\n**Woodlock:** That wasn't the last period of Order activity either, it was just the last time we saw their ace in action. They probably spent all this time trying to find another site to attack and how to properly get in and out.\n\n**Woodlock:** We're running out of time, Sam.
