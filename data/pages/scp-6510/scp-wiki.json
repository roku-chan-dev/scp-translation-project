Requests for further testing should be directed to the Department of Procurement and Liquidation.\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://live.staticflickr.com/4050/4378431447_31c8ca2977_o.jpg|caption=One half of SCP-6510. Stored separately to prevent improper usage.]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6510 is a pair of stainless steel ring piercings. \n\nSCP-6510's anomalous effects do not activate when worn on the earlobes, nasal septum, bellybutton, eyebrows, lips, tongue, or genitals, nor when only one of the two pieces is worn.\n\nSCP-6510's primary effect activates when both pieces are worn on human //papilla mammaria//. The wearer of SCP-6510 obtains the ability to accelerate SCP-6510 at up to 5g[[footnote]]1 g = 9.81 m/s^^2^^, the approximate acceleration experienced by an object within the earth's gravitational field at sea level [[/footnote]]. SCP-6510 applies a tensile force to the user's body, providing the capability for self-directed aerial motion. The acceleration of SCP-6510 is invariant to the mass of the wearer's body: regardless of body mass, subjects using SCP-6510 reach a consistent maximum acceleration.\n\nSCP-6510's secondary effect imparts increased tensile and compressive strength to its wearer's body tissues. The wearer's //papilla mammaria// become fully resistant to traumatic amputation. Wearers of SCP-6510 routinely survive high-velocity collisions without sustaining permanent injury.\n\nAll wearers of SCP-6510 have reported perfect real-time control over SCP-6510. The pre-containment owner of SCP-6510 used it as a means of rapid airborne transport; replication of this capability for specialized Foundation agents has proven infeasible for reasons discovered in the course of testing.\n\nTest subjects universally report that SCP-6510 does not have any anesthetic effects, and neural activity scans show activate of the anterior cingulate consistent with pain induced by 5gs of acceleration upon the //papilla mammaria.// All attempts to redistribute the force applied by SCP-6510 on its wearer have nullified its primary effect.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6509]]] | SCP-6510 | [[[SCP-6511]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** \n> **Name:** My nipple ring!
