For exact information regarding the Free Port, please access the [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|attached external file]]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-5373 is FP-120, a [[[locations-of-interest|Free Port-type Nexus]]] currently existing within a pocket dimension parallel to the city of Częstochowa, Poland, commonly referred to as \"Tysiąclecie Górne\" in Polish or \"Esterberg\" in Fae, acting as the hub of operations for GoI-120 (\"Triumviraté\").[[footnote]] GoI-120, Fae for \"we will prevail;\" a large-scale organized Fae terrorist group, focused on reclaiming its supposed territory back from humanity; full report pending.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=graffiti.jpg|align=right|caption=One of the five entries into SCP-5373 as seen behind an abandoned factory building in Częstochowa, Poland.|width=300px]]\n\nAlthough this area is strictly separated from baseline reality, it is accessible through five main entries from baseline reality, one for each of its districts, connecting these two dimensions together leading into one of its districts. All of them are located throughout the entirety of Częstochowa, Poland, only accessible to individuals knowing the passcodes necessary to pass through each door. Despite the location of these entries and / or said password having been noted to be changed about once a century by Esterberg's rulers, the Foundation had been successfully able to locate them following each shift through the usage of scanner technology and thaumaturgic rituals.\n\nDespite mostly acting as a free living space for numerous anomalous races, such as common Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) or [[[SCP-1000|Yeren]]] (//Homo sapiens noctis//),[[footnote]] With a population graph showing approximately 40% / 30% / 30% for Fae, Yeren, and other races respectively. [[/footnote]] human society is neither a rarity nor an ostracized minority -- in fact, the concept of racial discrimination within SCP-5373's boundaries is nearly nonexistent.\n\nSCP-5373's area covers around 59 km x 62 km of land (with 10% of that being taken by the actual city and 90% by the outside), with a centralized citizen-run council currently acting as the main ruling organ for the city. The entire city appears to run on a democratic-socialistic system, with the internal government being run by a body known as the \"Council of Three,\" a group comprised of one Fae, one human, and one Child of the Night, chosen from the city council once every four years in a democratic vote among the council, acting as a position similar to that of prime minister and president to the city.\n\nDue to SCP-5373's large area, it is inherently divided into five different districts, self-referred by its inhabitants as the Ruling District, the Living District, the Market District, the Sewer District, and the Port District.[[footnote]] Though the area outside of SCP-5373 does not possess any sea connections, the Port District does -- it is currently theorized that this internal sea system connects to the river of Warta outside of the pocket dimension. [[/footnote]] Due to their complexity, refer to the Addenda for further information on each.\n\n**Discovery and Historical Context:** SCP-5373 first came to the Foundation's attention even prior to [[[SCP-5292|Site-120's founding]]] in 02/05/1916. During that time, intel from allied minor Groups of Interest revealed the existence of a Free Port within the boundaries of Częstochowa. Following the founding of Provisional Site-120, SCP-5292's discovery (at the time known as PL-X0R38/0124) and the Fae attack that followed, Site-120 had been properly established to watch over the entirety of the Free Port for further action-planning.\n\nWith the passing of the 1923 \"Free Port Protection\" League of Nations Act, any plans of containment of SCP-5373 were immediately discontinued to not break the newly established international law. However, due to a loophole allowing for unarmed Foundation research exploration, further study conducted revealed that SCP-5373 is most likely more than 500 years old. Markings found within its oldest building -- the Grand Temple located in the Ruling District -- suggest that it was originally created as a refugee camp for anomalous during Medieval times during the attacks by the Catholic Church on the the Fae and Children of the Night populations during the Fourth Occult War, caused by an [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-259 attempt at resurgence by the Fae Empire in the 13th century].\n\n[[include component:image-block name=thing2.png|align=left|caption=Second one of the five entries into SCP-5373 as seen within an abandoned block of flats located within Częstochowa, Poland.|width=275px]]\n\nDespite SCP-5373's continued existence over the following eras, no major interactions with the human population in any capacity were noted -- the only real exception of this rule was the hermetic sealing of the community during the Medieval-era Catholic Church-organized hunts for all that was anomalous, with a focus on individuals possessing thaumaturgic abilities and / or anomalous races. It's believed that this was mainly caused by the fact that almost no representatives of the hunting organizations possessed any knowledge regarding the usage of thaumaturgy; therefore a magical lock on portals leading to SCP-5373 were effectively permanent protection.\n\nDuring 1916, intel of its existence had been acquired by the Foundation -- in the light of this information, further actions were almost immediately undertaken, in the end resulting in Site-120's establishment. For more information regarding these events, see file -- [[[SCP-5292]]].\n\nIn recent years, SCP-5373 has been acting as the main hub for all legal anomalous activity within a majority of central Europe. Being both a Foundation influence-free area as well as a society accepting of thaumaturgy, ontokinetic abilities, and other common anomalies, its population consists of more than 50 000 individuals both living within it on a daily basis as well as visiting.  Noteworthy is the fact that despite being relatively up-to-date with modern technology, SCP-5373 has no infrastructure supporting cars,[[footnote]] But possesses one for trams. [[/footnote]] and its architecture is heavily non-modern, with a currently untitled mixture of neoclassical, gothic, medieval, and modern architecture dominating within.\n\nDue to the relative ease of access to most individuals as well as the fact SCP-5373 is not forbidden to anyone, even Foundation personnel, FP-120 is seen as both a positive phenomenon and a wanted one due to its limitation of any non-controlled anomalous activity within the region -- it's currently estimated that due to its existence, at least 100 anomalous events are prevented from being seen by the public on a daily basis.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n**⚠️ FILE UPDATE -- 01/05/1985 -- Project Neverland Briefing ⚠️**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nFollowing the receival of intel suggesting that the next planned move of PoI-5936 is going to be an exploration mission into SCP-5373 for the purpose of a gathering of his military force consisting of anomalous races, [[[SCP-5890|SCP-5890-1 entities]]],[[footnote]] Which, due to their containment breach, possess knowledge of the Foundation's inner workings as well as numerous other SCP files within its database. [[/footnote]] and [[[SCP-5795|SCP-5795-2 instances]]], which are able to remotely compromise Foundation databases. Due to this, as well as information suggesting this event will lead to a destruction of the second metaphysical thaumaturgic circle referred to by his followers as a \"[[[SCP-5936|Seal]]],\" in turn progressing his final, currently unknown, plan.\n\nTo counter this, a planned military operation focused only on the elimination of PoI-5936 and his followers has been launched on 17/05/1985 by the Foundation; logs and details of this operation are available below.\n\nOperation details in regards to specific SCP-5373 Districts are marked in the color of ##blue|blue##.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n**Addendum 5373-1: Specific SCP-5373 District Descriptions**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=sewer.jpg|caption=The entry point into the Sewer District as seen by MTF Theta-120 (portal-entry-enduced visual anomalies removed). |width=325px|align=right]]\n\n**The Sewer District:** Being the smallest district within all of FP-120, the sewer district acts as the city's main garbage disposal system. Within its boundaries, numerous thaumaturgy-operated burners as well as other machinery to which all pipes and sewage lines are connected, are located. Despite this system however, a large portion of the underground sewer system is either heavily outdated due to its age and repurposed for usage by anomalous races finding the environment it creates to be beneficial. Such modifications range from mass grave / crypt areas,[[footnote]] With one of such possessing an extremely deep tunnel with an internal temperature of over 120°C, anomalously not spreading outside its boundaries; due to this property, [[[SCP-5572|where it leads]]] remains unknown. [[/footnote]] tunnel underground black markets, and housing areas for the previously mentioned races to connections to local cave areas.\n\nEntry into the Sewer District is available directly through a loose portal located within Częstochowa's sewers, through which the Foundation leads almost all exploration missions into SCP-5373 due to the relative secrecy that location offers. However, due to the loose dimensional boundary enforcement this way of dimensional separation creates, numerous minor anomalous behaviors have been noted to affect the non-SCP-5373 part of the gateway, with the most present one being the feeling of a [[[SCP-5659|powerful presence within the Częstochowian sewers]]]. However, as none of these effects is severe enough to affect anything else than the extremely small space that is the connection between Częstochowa and SCP-5373, no action against them was declared necessary.\n\n##blue|The Sewer District is to act as the starting point to the PoI-5936 Capture Mission, further referred to as \"Project Neverland.\" There, a total of five MTF units are to be dispatched as the beginning to this operation, with their main goal being heading towards the Ruling District, where a Foundation-contacted inside agent is planned to provide more intel information to the squads regarding Nowak's whereabouts; after this occurs, the main focus is on locating the area he resides in and eliminating him.##\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Open Exploration Log 5373-1 ◀\" hide=\"▼ Close Exploration Log 5373-1 ▼\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n**Date:** 17/05/1985\n\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Theta-120 (\"Tyrfing Black\")[[footnote]] A three-man Mobile Task Force consisting of the main research group of the [[[and-every-time-we-meet-again-hub|The Damien Nowak case]]]; despite their relatively high rankings within the Foundation -- these being the Site Director statuses of Jessie Rivera and Daniel Asheworth and the Chief of Security status of Jeremy Cornwell -- the team was decided to be a valuable field resource due to their high knowledge of PoI-5936.

Due to the buildings it houses, most of the Ruling District's area is severely renovated above any other area within the city.\n\nBeing the oldest part of the city as suggested by prior scans, the Ruling District possesses by far the highest rankings of Akiva radiation out of the entire city, with the focus point of this radiation being the Grand Temple, which is also the oldest building within the entire city. It's theorized that this is mainly caused by the sheer amount of religious activity it houses every day due to its size -- however, this doesn't explain why [[[i-was-the-queen-before-it-was-cool|energy amounts similar to those excreted by dietic entities are mainly focused on underground parts of the facility]]]. \n\nDue to the relatively rich population of the Ruling District, a relatively large portion of its buildings are directly owned by large [[[groups-of-interest|Groups of Interest]]], with the main players within this area being [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|Marshall, Carter & Darke]]], which possesses an official auctionhouse within the district and the [[[goc-hub-page|Global Occult Coalition]]] with its own office and a patrolling force. Additionally, numerous cults and smaller religious organizations such as the [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Church of the Broken God]]], the [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent's Hand]]], with a direct portal to the [[[wanderers-library-hub|Wanderers' Library]]] in one of its buildings, singular believers of [[[sarkicism-hub|Sarkicism]]], and a small but formidable cult of individuals worshiping an unknown deity known as \"Father\" have been found within the numerous minor chapels and religious buildings the Ruling District offers.\n\n##blue|Following their escape from the Sewer District, Project Neverland exploration teams are to head into the direction of the Grand Temple, where they are to meet the Foundation's inside agents, from whom they are to collect information regarding Nowak's whereabouts (this information wasn't forwarded prior due to the chance of compromisation this offer would hold for the agents).

In the center, a featureless humanoid entity is standing, visibly above all others; the material previously used to make it up seems to be destroyed, purposefully leaving only its silhouette visible.

From one of the apendeges of the red entity, unidentified items can be seen; behind it, a number of small red humanoids equivalent to that of the offered blue ones are present.//\n\n**Rivera:** So someone... dealt with something, in exchange for people, getting what in return, exactly?\n\n**Asheworth:** Technology, I imagine. Or at least some material wealth. No idea.\n\n//Shrugging, he proceeds to the next image, which showcases two visibly divided parts -- the top one, within which the red mass with numerous parts of it covered in holes, numerous unidentified items from the last panel, as well as a number of red humanoids identical to the one of the blue ones from panel one can be seen. Separated from the bottom panel with a black line, within the down portion, the tall blue humanoid can be seen, in visible stress, with parts of its body missing. Despite this divide and most of the red mass being located atop the panel, a slight red appendage penetrating this wall can be seen.//\n\n**Asheworth:** \"III. The escape.\"\n\n**Rivera:** They fought, I imagine?\n\n**Asheworth:** Probably. Ended in the blue one running away from whatever its home was.\n\n**Rivera:** Why though? \n\n//Asheworth points at the red humanoids.//\n\n**Asheworth:** The red one probably overpowered the blue one by sheer numbers. Too many deals to do anyone good, I guess.\n\n//Proceeding to the fourth panel, the team reveals an open plain, with the tall humanoid present in its center -- from its hands, plants and two small entities looking similar to humans can be seen emerging. Within the blue entity's eyes, a slight red light can be seen.//\n\n**Asheworth:** \"IV. The creation of life.\" Eugh. Seen and heard too many world-creation stories. Sick of them.\n\n**Rivera:** Agreed.\n\n//The fifth mural showcases five smaller circles located around the entity -- the tall humanoid has parts of its body missing, with one of its eyes burning with a red light, sand its visibly connected to the five circles, with parts of its body present within them. One of these circles is slightly damaged.//\n\n**Asheworth:** \"V. Imprisonment..\"\n\n**Rivera:** So it... put itself in a prison? Why?\n\n**Asheworth:** The red one somehow penetrated the barrier and got to it.

Due to boats becoming more of an obsolete movement method as well as the closing of all river-based entries into SCP-5373 within the couple last centuries, the actual port is now more of a decoration / tourist attraction rather than a functioning trade center; though boats still roam the waters of the foggy lake, Lake Arlande, connected to the harbor, trade through this method is almost nonexistent.\n\nDespite being mostly populated by large warehouses as well as markets from the Market District, numerous other buildings, including houses, still do exist within the Port District's area -- the biggest landmark being the gigantic lighthouse located on the shores of Lake Arlande. The building, being powered by a thaumaturgic flame, permanently exhorts a large pillar of light, regularly patrolling the harbor. Despite no real need for this, a local legend attributing the flame's wealth to the wealth of the city exists; no correlation has ever been noted, but Esterbergians keep the flame permanently alive as a visible tradition.\n\n##blue|After the information exchange within the Ruling District will become successful, Project Neverland personnel are to head within the location within which PoI-5936 is planned to locate himself, in the process adhering to as many safety rules as possible -- not being detected by the target prior to engagement is top priority. During the relocation process, all individuals involved are to keep an eye out for any irregularities within SCP-5373's terrain, with structures such as thaumaturgic glyphs, runes, totems or any other items possibly used for the completion of a ritual being items they are to look for the most.

The crates suddenly engulf themselves in flame as the area around the thaumaturge's eyes starts to slightly wither.//\n\n**Rivera:** I... What--?\n\n**Asheworth:** It meant sacrifice. He's ready to open another one of his seals.

Despite being mostly filled with houses and buildings built with similar purposes, the district possesses numerous buildings commonly found within urban areas, such as shops, restaurants, and small businesses. Due to this as well as the large clientele the area offers, numerous smaller Groups of Interest were noted to open their locals within, with the most active players being [[[wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub|Wilson's Wildlife Solutions]]] with an active shelter for [[[critter-profile-sparky|stray animals]]] titled \"Wilson's Esterberg Center\" and [[[ambrose-restaurant-hub|Ambrose Restaurants]]], with numerous smaller sub-instances located within. [[[ambrose-esterberg|Surprisingly, Ambrose does not possess any subinstances outside of the Living District — the reasons for this remain unknown]]].\n\nDespite being an active nexus for anomalous inhabitants, it's been noted that numerous portals appear to lead out of parts of the area, connecting areas inhabited by anomalous races spread across Poland to this area; examples of such include [[[the-furmen|SCP-1000 habitats within the Podlasian Voivodeship]]], Fae habitats in the Wielkopolska areas, and Finfolk housings near the Baltic Sea.\n\nThough initially entirely separate, due to the ever-increasing amount of residents requiring vital products on a daily basis, the Living District and the Market District partially overlap, resulting in a large area of the Great Market existing partially within the latter.\n\n##blue|During the search for PoI-5936 following the inquiry of vital information regarding his whereabouts, Project Neverland personnel are to be especially worried about potential threats coming from within SCP-5373 inhabitants -- as seen from prior interactions, Damien Nowak possesses an inherent ability to turn normally neutral parties against the Foundation; with FP-120 possessing numerous potentially dangerous races as well as the Living District's large amount of inhabitants, special caution is to be shown during the operation.##\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▶ Open Exploration Log 5373-4 ◀\" hide=\"▼ Close Exploration Log 5373-4 ▼\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//The feed reconnects, revealing Rivera and Cornwell standing in a large, densly-packed crowd standing around a large open area, filled to the brim with a mix of humans, Children of the Night, Fae, and other anomalous races.
