The coat of arms presented here purely describe cold_Nights's name and not really more. I had to think a bit about how to depict the cold part, and eventually I settled on the use of a thermometer. The supporters are wild men frequently used in German heraldry. In addition to that they are both [[[Nature | M and Nature]]].\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** It's night, so there has got to be a moon. Even better, since we are talking about cold_Nights, so plural, I decided to add two.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-17-collide| Day 17: Collide]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-19-loop| Day 19: Loop]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** coldnights.png\n> **Name:** coldnights\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\ncoldnights.png is a composite.
