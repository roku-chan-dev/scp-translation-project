Anyway, they caught Zero and hold em for trial, in which Zero tells the Overseers or whatever what the deal is. Only way to make sure it don’t happen again is shut it down, the whole foundation. To their credit, half the overseers take Zero’s side. But not the tie breaker.\n\n**Him**: Not only is the Foundation to blame, it’s willful. Where’s this Zero now?\n\n**Me**: Site-01, only Overseers allowed in to talk with them. Figure they’re gonna torture them until the bastards have what they want. Whatever that is.\n\n**Him**: Probably ways to stem the problem when it comes up again. Right.  Job just changed. \n\n**Me**: Oh?\n\n**Him**: Here’s my friends now, they’re useful so we should get them up to speed. But real quick, yeah the job’s different than I thought. Far as I can tell, there wasn’t any of us before the Foundation started their containment. Earliest notions around World War I or so, putting it a few decades after the Foundation got started. I figure it’s our job to gum up the works, undermine their containment, shut em down if I can. But now, it’s a rescue mission.\n\n**Me**: Just gonna waltz into Site-01 and snatch this Zero? You mental?\n\n//He slides a gun across the table, little thing like what James Bond would use.//\n\n**Him**: Maybe I am. You in?\n\n//So I take the gun and slip it into me bag.//\n\n**Me**: Fuck it. Yeah, I’m in.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Grigori Karpin]]\n\n=====\n> **Filename**: I Feel It All Around Me\n> **Author**: qthomasbower\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/55943778@N00/3799162361 | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**: Labelled as “Cognitohazard” in file\n\n\n> **Filename**: martini logo\n> **Author**: Willis Lam\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/85567416@N03/18938713706 | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**:Edited by [[user Grigori Karpin]]\n\n> **Filename**: Sue the T-Rex\n> **Author**: Michael Gray\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/23842402@N07/2452545096 | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**:Edited by [[user Grigori Karpin]]\n\n> **Filename**: Blackfoot!\n> **Author**: dynamosquito\n> **License**: CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/25182210@N07/3045749364 | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**:Edited by [[user Grigori Karpin]]\n\n> **Filename**: Arc de Triumph\n> **Author**: KJGarbutt\n> **License**: CC BY 2.0\n> **Source**: [[[https://www.flickr.com/photos/25187937@N05/7846823258 | LINK]]]\n> **Additional Notes**:Edited by [[user Grigori Karpin]]\n\n\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
