SCP-4224 is to remain within its life support system permanently, and electricity is to be continuously supplied to the cell. A backup generator is also installed and automatically activated in the event of main power failure. Medical staff must constantly monitor SCP-4224's homeostatic status; any deviation from nominal levels must be immediately corrected. Secreted Substance RJ-O1 \"ROYAL JELLY\" is collected in a secure vessel exterior to SCP-4224's chamber. This vessel, and by extension all SCP-4224 products, are considered Class-V extreme biological hazards.  \n\n255 instances of SCP-4224-1 are to be contained within a panopticon[[footnote]] Due to infection hazards, a regular prison risks too many personnel. A panoptical setup risks a minimal amount of guards without compromising security. [[/footnote]] located at Site-97. The cells are to be equipped with basic living facilities alongside an additional gas inlet, waste, and outlet pipes, as well as a wall-mounted monitor. Interactions with SCP-4224-1 instances are to be minimized, and guards must regularly be checked for DR-O1 \"DRONE\" infection.\n\nUpon expiry of SCP-4224, an SCP-4224-1 instance is to be promoted to SCP-4224 status. Upon expiry of SCP-4224-1 instances, a random selection of D-Class without any notable characteristics, history or experience are to be exposed to DR-O1 followed immediately by RJ-O1 and contained as an SCP-4224-1 instance. SCP-4224-1 instances are to be conditioned to release Substance DR-O1 upon visual stimulation, while SCP-4224 is to be conditioned to release Substance RJ-O1 upon visual stimulation.\n\nIn accordance with the Ennui Protocol Directive, the majority of Site-97's functions are controlled by a remote terminal, accessible only to the O5 Council.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=ironlung.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-4224's life support system (hover to enlarge)\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-4224 is a Russian female approximately 90 years old, named \"Natalya Ignatova\" prior to Foundation classification. Due to the deteriorating health of SCP-4224, it must be attached to a bespoke Foundation-created life support system. \n\nSCP-4224 produces two products at will, designated RJ-O1 and DR-O1. These substances are detailed below.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n> **__RJ-O1 \"ROYAL JELLY\"__**\n> \n> **Characteristics:** Viscous, translucent liquid at room temperature. Visually resembles honey.\n> \n> **Containment:** Contained in a chilled (5 ^^o^^C) Class-V biological hazard liquid tank.\n> \n> **Effects:** Once RJ-O1 enters the digestive system in volumes greater than 500 mg, the individual is granted immunity to subsequent DR-O1 exposure. The individual's morphology changes to accommodate the generation of RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances unique to the individual, allowing them to create these substances at will. Infectees are designated SCP-4224-1.\n> \n> **Application:** Due to the unfamiliarity of secreting RJ-O1 and DR-O1 substances, individuals must be applied DR-O1 prior to RJ-O1 application. RJ-O1 may be administered orally or through injection. \n\n> **__DR-O1 \"DRONE\"__**\n> \n> **Characteristics:** Airborne viral pathogen. Invisible to the naked eye. \n> \n> **Containment:** Contained in a body-temperature (37 ^^o^^C) Class-V biological hazard aerosol tank or storage vat.\n> \n> **Effects:** Infection causes only behavioural symptoms, detailed below. When infected, the pathogen causes massive neural remodelling to the host's brain. This process takes approximately two weeks to complete and is highly energy intensive, requiring a caloric intake of 5000 kcal/day to sustain. After infection of DR-O1, the process is irreversible.\n> \n> After initial infection, the disease begins the transformation in the prefrontal cortex and progresses posteriorly. Meaning that personality is affected first, before affecting other areas such as facial recognition, memory, language, reading, etc.\n> \n> After the process is complete the individual's connectome will mirror that of the individual that synthesized the DR-O1 substance, creating a neurologically identical copy. Infected individuals act autonomously, but identify as the parent except in cases where infiltration is required, such as assuming a position of authority. \n> \n> **Application:** For DR-O1 harvested before Ennui activation, an oral-nasal mask is attached to a DR-O1 tank and opened for 3 seconds once secured over the patient. Aseptic techniques must be followed when working with pre-Ennui DR-O1. DR-O1 harvested post-Ennui activation may be used freely.\n\n|| **Note:** The following addenda are out-of-date, and saved for purely archival reasons.||\n\n**Addendum 4224-A: Heather Everwood's Video Logs**\n[[div style=\"border: 3px double black; padding: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n__Heather Everwood's Video Log #1__\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**<Begin Video>**\n@@ @@\n//Camera is stationary and pointed directly at SCP-4224, who is pacing within its cell.
