However, Foundation personnel with Special Clearance PSM-1 are required to engage with SCP-5553 regularly each day from a non-Foundation personal computer, and file reports with External Affairs Team Sierra-611 in order to refer useful information obtained from SCP-5553 to local law enforcement agencies.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5553 is a social media networking site called JACK, accessible from url @@https://jack.███@@. Its features include status posting, photo sharing, a news feed, public and private commenting, and direct private messaging. This site is only accessible to people who have committed serial murder of at least 3 victims.\n\nPersons who are not eligible to view site content are exposed to an infohazard that causes confusion and memory loss related to the contents of the web page. In approximately 5% of cases, this effect is more severe, causing nearly-instantanious quadriplegia, intense pain, and subject death within 10 minutes, after which the device connected to SCP-5553 disconnects and shuts down. Premature shutdown of the device does not mitigate the lethal effect of the infohazard.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addenda 5553.1: Site Content\" hide=\"Close Addenda 5553.1: Site Content\"]]\nInvitations to join the site are sent via email to users with internet access who meet the above condition (Designated PSM-0). These emails are routed from the above (invalid) .███ domain but are otherwise non-anomalous.\n\nUpon joining the site, PSM-0 users are allowed to utilize the site features. They can create a user profile under a pseudonym—or their real name if they so choose—and join discussion forums. These forums cover many topics related to homicide and other off-topic subject-matter. Several of these forums cater to specific interests, including support groups for users who want to reform or repent for past actions, and advice boards dedicated to sharing tips, tricks, and strategies to perform murders without being caught. The most popular board, the \"Showcase\", allows users to have their own individual page to act as a portfolio of past murders performed.\n\nAccording to the site's \"about\" page, it was launched in 1999 by an entity under the pseudonym Moriarity. Reviews of ICANN[[footnote]]The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers[[/footnote]] records have produced no evidence of such a domain being registered, as .███ is not a valid top-level domain. An attempt to force ICANN to create the .███ domain for Foundation use is in progress.\n\nAn example of the news feed is reproduced below with the aid of a graphic artist.\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; width: 100%;\"]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"background-image: linear-gradient(to right,#000, #333); color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n++++ ☰ MENU\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #333 , #FFF);; color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"greybox\" rowspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center; background-color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n[[image jacklogo.png width=\"100px\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"Greybox\" style=\"text-align:center; background-image: linear-gradient(to right,#000, #333); color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n+++ Friends\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"Whitebox\" style=\"text-align:center; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ News Feed\n[[/=]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"Greybox\" style=\"background-image: linear-gradient(to right,#000, #333); color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n ##green|◉## ChuckChuck\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"Whitebox\" style=\"font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n**Dan Bontelli** shared:\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell class=\"Greybox\" style=\"background-image: linear-gradient(to right,#000, #333); color:#FFF; font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\n ##green|◉## Narbelscot\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell class=\"Whitebox\" rowspan=\"3\" style=\"font-family: 'PT Sans Narrow', sans-serif;\"]]\nCan't fucking take this.
