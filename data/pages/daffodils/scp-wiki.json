But somebody who found contentment in solitary. \n\nField Agents don’t talk much about love or relationships. Even when they’re attached, they don’t talk about it. Nobody wants to jinx their happiness. The lucky go and retire and move on with their lives. But not everyone is lucky to enjoy that; most end up haunted in one way or another.\n\nHe found himself lucky, though. Not haunted, or aching for other. He never yearned for a companion in his youth, but now he found his centre. His home. \n\nAnd tonight Agent Ben Green laid by himself, the moonlight filtering through his blinds. It was a full moon, bright and clear. His favourite sort of scene. Serene, lonesome. Maybe peaceful. Outside, the squeak as a rabbit was snapped by an owl. Quiet. The breeze carried the squeak away.\n\nIdle thoughts and worries passed through his mind in the dark. Thoughts of his life, the Foundation, the future… Where //could// he go from here? Of course, once he found contentment and happiness, something was going to drive a wedge in it. Of fucking course that’s how it has to be. That’s how it usually is in this Foundation.\n\nHe put that out of his mind. More important things were happening. \n\n“... tonight’s a good night,” he sighed.\n \n“Yeah.”\n\n“... I hope we can have a few more like this.”\n\nGreen looked across his bedroom, to the chest of drawers, to the mirror hung behind it. He looked into his eyes, then over to his own, their fingers winding together.\n \nThey fell at first sight. A true spark. A connection, that nobody else could ever have. Or ever would, really. \n\n“... the world is ending, you know,” his voice mused, squeezing tight. \n \n“... Is it really though?” his own voice answered.\n\nGreen nestled into himself, and tried to forget the outside.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
