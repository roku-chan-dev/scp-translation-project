Please, do come in, do come in. It's dangerous to be out on the city streets at this hour.\n\nAh, where are my manners? I am Oliver, pleasure to make your acquaintance. And you are? \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-1 users=\".\"]]\n%%title%%?\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-2]]\n█████████?\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:listusers-3]]\n\nThat's an unusual one. You aren't from Ilcana, by any chance? No? Ah.\n\nI see you're admiring some of my wares. I suppose I should explain this place to you, seeing as you came dashing in from the rain. I sell curiosities, little trinkets with minor inexplicable traits. Nothing too major, mind you. I wouldn't want the Fundamentum knocking on my door. Just magical little items. \n\nFeel free to browse, everything is for sale. And don't fear to ask me about any particular item that catches your attention, I am more than willing to tell you about any of the items on display.\n\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**An Ornate Pocket Watch**\nAh, this one brings back memories. One of the first little things that fell into my possession, actually. I first found it in my mother's things, when we were sorting out her will. While you hold it, you will always know what the time is, at least in the hours of the eld-day. Give it a go, will you?\n\nNow, what time is it?\n\nTwelve minutes to ten?\n\nSpot on. Wondrous, is it not?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**A Broken Dagger**\nAh, watch your fingers with that, wouldn't want anyone cutting you cutting yourself now, would we?\n\nOh, what it does? Well, if you'll just step back for a moment... There! As you can see, it glows. All by itself! Handy for getting around in this eternal night, and a useful deterrent against the ruffians that'll demand your money or your life. Just be careful not to get caught with this on your person, the constables will arrest you all the same.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Portrait Of A Woman With Cats**\nA fine painting, wouldn't you say? Of our very own Queen Irene Von Xeraphon, with her beloved cat Berry. Pay close attention to the eyes, now. See how they seem to follow you? Now look to the cat's tail. Look away for a moment, and now back to the tail.\n\nIt's moved, yes?\n\nYou can't say for sure? Look away again, then look back. I'm sure you'll notice a difference this time around.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**A Dirty Old Smoking Pipe**\nAh, this was my grandfather's old pipe. He had a knack for finding these sorts of things, they just seemed to gravitate towards him. It'll expel some colorful smoke if you blow into it, tobacco or otherwise inside of it. Smells quite nice too, unlike those awful cigar things the governor is always puffing on.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**A Pristine Looking Glass**\nNow this one I like. Pick it up and take a peek through the glass, you'll see why.\n\nYou see all those colors swirling about, like little clouds? Try to grab one, throw it up to the ceiling.\n\nAha! You're getting quite into it, I see. It's quite therapeutic to play around with this little thing, tossing those clouds of color around. I do wonder what they are, sometimes...\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**A Blood and Bone Compass**\nAh! This one here, a peculiar little thing, isn’t it? Not often one sees a compass carved of bone.\n\nSee that needle there, suspended within the blood? It’s a bit opaque, you may have to squint, but it will point you to where blood has recently been shed. I think it goes by proximity, so it won’t be too helpful if you’re the one shedding the blood. But if you're unharmed? It will have its uses.\n\nSo perhaps, when using this, you want to head in the opposite direction of where it’s pointing you! Ha!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**A Picture of Your Family**\nAh, this one is of particular interest to me. I haven't yet discerned what magics are at work here, but sometimes it's good to keep a little air of mystery in one's life, wouldn't you agree?\n\nWithin its ornate mahogany frame, you should be able to see your own family, perhaps in a place you remember? Now do not fret my friend, I am no crook, it is simply a magical guise, a trick of the light.\n\nIt should change once you look back at it again, see? Remarkable, isn't it? Personally, I've always felt an under taste of concern admiring this trinket. How does it know my family? Or yours? Does it seek to deceive us?\n\nOr perhaps you're a little more optimistic than I. Perhaps it wishes us happiness, a nostalgic comfort. Food for thought…[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**The Living Blunderbuss**\nAn interesting piece this one is. A strange firearm that acts like a living being. I'd be careful where I aim it if I were you. It seems to fire shards of bone and bits of teeth. Bones of what you ask? I have no clue.\n\nIt also seems to talk, the man who sold this to me said it kept whispering to him, and whenever he did decide to fire it, it screamed in agony every time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**The Glass Butterfly**\nOh, The Glass Butterfly! Such a beautiful and delicate thing... I must say, kind shopper, this would make an //amazing// addition to your home!\n\nHow did acquire such a beauty, you ask?\n\nWell, I can't exactly remember when I was initially sold this item, but what I do remember is //who// sold it to me. An elderly lady, it was. 'Told me it was the family heirloom. When I inquired as to why she would want to sell me something so significant and priceless as a family heirloom, she stated that it would occasionally move from one spot to another when no one was around. Intriguing enough, she also ejected how she once observed it //\"levitating\"// upon entering the room she had kept in.\n\nI do have to admit, though, kind shopper. I myself would occasionally notice it having moved from one spot to another, but levitating? Can't say that's on the list of oddities I've seen from this beauty. 'Not out of the question, though.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**The Timekeeper's Relic**\nAhh, the classic!\n\nI must say you have a sharp vision for valuable objects, and there's nothing more valuable than time itself.\n\nUnlike ordinary hourglasses, this one defies the laws of time. Its sands flow not just downward but also sideways, creating intricate patterns that mesmerize the observer. \n\nTurn it upside down, and time itself seems to pause momentarily, as if waiting for a decision to be made.\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\nAh, leaving so soon? What a shame, you make for pleasant company. Do feel free to return anytime, my doors are always open.\n\nTa-ta, for now.\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"Perhaps you have a curio of your own you wish to part ways with?\" hide=\"Hehe, very well\"]]\nThis is a NIGHTFALLified version of the [[[Log Of Anomalous Items]]], and should be treated similarly. Everything here is a small scale anomalous object in a shop in a Victorian-era city, not something that'd be deserving of an SCP file.\n\nIf you want to add your own little oddity to the list, create a new blockquote and put your title in bold. Add a few little lines of dialogue from Oliver describing the object's odd properties, and save the edit. This list will be regularly pruned by [[*user BitOddInnit]] to ensure content is fitting of the setting.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
