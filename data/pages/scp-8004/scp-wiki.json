Vincent Bohart was transferred to [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-333 Site-333] in 1991 and currently serves in the position of Site Director. Requests from Director Bohart for transfer to other Foundation facilities are to be denied -- as are requests for his removal from this position due to ineptitude, moral and/or ethical failings, misallocation of funds/resources, and/or other grievances. No additional Special Containment Procedures are needed at this time.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8004 is an act of anomalous legerdemain whereby an individual, acting as the 'dealer,' is capable of manipulating the order of playing cards dealt from a standard 52-card deck. This occurs through a method of shuffling that situates the deck within a cardician superposition; the dealer is then able to assign the rank and suit directly to each card upon drawing it. Any other individual handling the deck at this stage -- or any disruption to its arrangement -- will collapse the superposition into a definitive order, as though the cards had been non-anomalously shuffled.\n\nIn effect, SCP-8004 allows the dealer to select card-by-card which of the **{{80,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 (52!)}}** potential playing orders will occur.\n\nSCP-8004 is unique amongst various methods of card manipulation as it does not produce any discernable thaumaturgical signatures, EVE or Akiva Radiation, nor detectable variations in Hume reading. It is theorized the only means by which one may detect the usage of SCP-8004 is by recognizing the physical method of shuffling and dealing employed. Documentation of SCP-8004 in use has contained inconsistencies and attempts to replicate the anomaly have failed thus far.\n\n**Notice: SCP-8004 Clearance Level**\nFollowing the events of the 2018, Site-Directors' Regional Conference (Eastern Seaboard division), SCP-8004's file was approved for clearance and distributed to previous and future conference attendees. This was done to dissuade participation in after-hours gambling activities organized by Director Bohart.\n------\n[[include component:image-block name=Absecon_1.png|width=100%|align=center|caption=Postcard depicting Absecon Lighthouse & associated buildings: the current location of Site-333.]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n++ Site-333 Surveillance Footage -- Director's Office\n//11:42 am -- Febraury 12, 2024.//\n-----\n[[/=]]\n//Vincent Bohart sits forward in his office chair with one sandalless foot placed on the desk.

Noah stops frequently to scan the horizon with a pair of binoculars, while Vincent attempts to receive cellphone reception -- eventually dropping his phone in the mud.//\n\n//After circling the marshland several times, the pair pause under the nearby bridge. The sun sets along the horizon as twilight dwindles into dusk.//\n-----\n**Vincent Bohart:** Noah, I can't. I literally cannot go anymore. Just leave me in the mud and my sorrow.\n\n**Noah Patel:** No worries, boss. It's a bummer to not find anything, but you just gotta keep going. Sometimes, all that really matters is what //you// know, and what you're willing to do to prove that to yourself. Anyway, I've brought some snacks.\n\n//Noah reaches into his backpack and withdraws a plastic tub filled with small brown morsels. He tosses it to Vincent and misses. As Vincent lifts it and wipes mud off its surface, he pauses and turns to Noah.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Noah, this is dog food.\n\n**Noah Patel:** What do you mean?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** There's a photo of a labradoodle right on it. It's for dogs.\n\n**Noah Patel:** No, that's their branding. It's for exercise, dogs are energetic.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** It says they're 'pup-tastic.' That's not even a real pun. Oh, fuck it.\n\n//Vincent unscrews the container and pops several of the pellets into his mouth. He chews audibly for a while and coughs a few times before being able to swallow.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Noah, why do you do this? How //long// have you been doing this?\n\n**Noah Patel:** Always, I suppose?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Always?\n\n**Noah Patel:** Yeah, I grew up around here -- Atlantic City's in my blood. My folks worked a lot growing up and I started walking around after school. I suppose I just wanted to see more of the city than my neighbourhood. That's when I saw it -- the Jersey Devil.  \n\n**Vincent Bohart:** And you're sure it wasn't like, an abnormally large cat?\n\n**Noah Patel:** No, it was exactly what you'd think: almost shoulder-height, bat-winged with goat legs and a dog's snout. I was out late one night and there it was, looking at me. It was like seeing all of New Jersey in one place. I could tell it had been through a tough time, but despite bad luck and shitty food and everything, it was still standing. And then it stretched those wings and just took off. Could you imagine that: all the weight of the city and the state on you, and you just take off flying?\n\n**Noah Patel:** I know you're busy, and I know none of you really like Atlantic City. At least not like I do. But I thought maybe it would make living here a little easier if you saw that too. I thought I'd imagined it for years, but with everything that's out there, why wouldn't it be?\n\n**Noah Patel:** Do you think it's real, Vincent?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I-- I don't know, Noah. But maybe... it's real for you and that's enough?\n\n**Noah Patel:** Yeah, I suppose so. It would still be pretty cool to find some proof though.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Yeah. Noah, I don't hate Atlantic City. I know I haven't exactly been--\n\n//As Vincent speaks, Noah stumbles sideways and catches himself on a support pillar of the bridge. He covers the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7703 trepanation hole in his head] with one of his hands. Vincent moves towards him and helps Noah sit down.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Noah, are you dying? I do not need to deal with explaining why they found me with your corpse under a bridge in the middle of fucking nowhere with a literal hole in your head. I am not taking responsibility for your phenomenally terrible medical decisions.\n\n**Noah Patel:** This happens sometimes, it's nothing. I just pass out for a bit. Dr. John Clarke said--\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** That is absolutely-fucking-not nothing, Noah. You need to stop referring to that man as a doctor. I don't care what hypocritical oaths he gave you.\n\n**Noah Patel:** I'm just going to rest my eye for a few minutes.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Am I supposed to let you sleep? Fuck, is that for concussions or migraines? Do we want to turn you upside down so the blood flows to your head? Or is that when you choke on your own vomit? Noah, I cancelled mandatory first aid training because I wanted to avoid situations like these.\n\n**Noah Patel:** Just... going to... rest...\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Okay, uh sure, do that. I'm going to try to call someone.\n\n//Vincent steps back and tries to turn on his mud-covered phone, which fails to respond as the battery died earlier.//\n\n//While distracted, Vincent fails to notice the hole in Noah's head darken in colour and slowly expand.//\n\n//As the hole dilates, a three-digit, clawed hand emerges from within and grasps the side of Noah's skull. Another claw follows and begins to push outwards, expanding the orifice. A low, gurgling noise emanates from the division.//\n\n**Unknown:** Unnnggghhhhhhgggnnnnnn\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Look, I've almost got it, okay. They just lie about the battery life to make you buy another. It's scummy but brilliant. I stole the idea for how our employee of the month system works.\n\n//The entity continues emerging from within the hole. Each clawed appendage reaches outward, grabbing onto Noah's unconscious body and pulling; a snout-like, horned head emerges from the darkness, followed by a hairy, scaled torso. The creature appears slick and wet with an unidentified, vicious dark liquid.//\n\n**Unknown:** nngghhhhh-rrammmmm.\n\n//Vincent turns towards Noah as the entity continues emerging, he freezes for a moment and drops the phone, which breaks.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** What the fuck is that!\n\n//The entity extends and flaps a pair of leathery wings, propelling itself out of Noah's skull. Its hindquarters are matted with thick, oily fur ending in a pair of cloven hooves. It falls to the ground in a heap before raising its head toward Vincent, matching his gaze with a pair of rectangular pupils.//\n\n**Unknown:** mmmmMMMMMmmmm--\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** What the fuck are you!\n\n**Unknown:** MMmmmmeeett--Mettaaa-Meta-MetaMeta-Metaphor!\n\n//The creature rises, balancing on its hind legs while extending its wings for balance. It comes to slightly higher than waist height. A long tongue flicks out of its mouth and licks the greasy fluid off its face.//\n\n**Unknown:** I'm a fucking metaphor, okay. Chill the fuck out. Trust me this was way worse for me than you. Have you ever tried crawling out of someone's fucking brain through a god-damned hole?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** What the hell is going on?\n\n**Unknown:** Let's just calm down. The yelling's stressing me out, man.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Oh, sure. I'm the one making a big deal out of the fucking monster that birthed itself from my employee's head!\n\n**Unknown:** Don't blame me! Do you know how much time this guy spends thinking about the Jersey Devil? It's non-stop and there's only so much room in there. It gets crowded. A devil's got to have room to spread its wings, you get me?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** No, I do not fucking get you. You said you were a metaphor? A metaphor for what?\n\n**Unknown:** Honestly, I've got no clue: the American Dream? The monstrous other as a manifestation of societal fears and the drive to alienate? The last guy had to do with cinema. Noah can't make up his mind, it just becomes muddled together in there. Haven't you read his dissertation?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** No, I haven't read his dissertation! No one reads those things! Wait, what do you mean the 'last guy.'\n\n**Unknown:** Like I said, it gets crowded in there. Another one of us left last week, Well, I say 'us,' but, we're not like a hivemind or anything. It's more like a set of shared experiences that continue through comm--\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I do not give a shit about the specifics. How many of you are there?

At least since I became a distinct sub-manifestation of the ideological principles projected--\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I still don't give a shit. Now give me one reason why I shouldn't shove you back into that head and duct tape it shut.\n\n**Unknown:** I mean, I don't think that falls under Foundation protocol.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** You know what, I'm pretty sure Noah packed something for this.\n\n//Vincent drops his pack on the ground and begins rummaging through it, drawing out a vaguely cylindrical metal device. The top is composed of a suspended hemisphere attached by a series of springs; a mechanical lever along the side allows the top hemisphere to be locked into a lowered position.//\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** That's right, Scranton Reality Anchor, fucker. Want to see how you handle getting hit by reality? Trust me, it'll knock you on your ass -- let's see how you handle comparing the relative heating costs of an electric and oil boiler.  \n\n**Unknown:** Do you even know what that does? Or when it's from?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I know I'm used to dealing with reality, as shitty as it can be. Can you say the same?\n\n**Unknown:** Vincent, that's a first-generation SRA. They're on generation 73 now. Do you know what the first 10 generations //didn't// have? I'll give you a hint: radiation shielding, jackass. That thing is weapons-grade plutonium. You're holding the fucking Demon Core there.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** I have no idea what that is.\n\n**Unknown:** Little Boy? Fat Man? Vincent, that thing conveys its reality-enforcing agents via neutron radiation. You pull that lever, and sure things will become more real for a bit, but they're going to be radioactive for a hell of lot longer. Not that you'll live to see it, given that you'll be vomiting blood. Noah too, come to think of it. Are you ready to die?\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** Oh don't you start too. I've had enough of that already today. For all I know you're lying out your chimeran ass. But this thing still weighs about twenty pounds. Chances are I could clobber you and force you back in from where you came.\n\n**Unknown:** That is categorically not 'Protect,' which is like a third of your whole thing.\n\n**Vincent Bohart:** It doesn't mean protect //you//.

Death tipped in toward itself and drew the chairs in closer as a flensed, beetle-cleaned, wind-lashed hand withdrew a frayed deck of cards from a hidden fold in its robe.\n\nDeath-the-Fool smiled as it thumbed open the box and slipped the cards free. There was little talk to be had; they’d played this game too many times for casual pleasantries to matter. Concepts were the shared language of the group: action and reaction, start and stop, risk and reward, give and take. Round-and-round, the cards were dealt: to Death-the-Comfort, Death-the-Ravenous, Death-the-Absent, and back to grinning Death-the-Fool.\n\nOnce given, they sat faced-down on the table as the laden potential suffused the space.\n\nThe dealer broke the silence. \"So, how about we up the ante? We've been playing for chump change recently and it's getting stale: little untimely ends, dregs of unwanted territory, fleeting meanings -- aren't you in the mood for a little more?\"\n\nDeath-the-Ravenous raged in response, a howling orchestra of winds above a barren desert shrieking over the even, steady tone of a cardiac monitor. The sourceless light dimmed and brightened as the walls around it turned the force inward.\n\n\"See, I knew they'd go for it. What do you say, moody? Willing to put your precious greyscale on the line? I'd be keen to see some flush in that chiselled face of yours.\"\n\nThe figure opposite let the cigarette dancing across his fingers burn to a nub before responding. \"Sure. I won't be coming for your right to dress in rags, I'll leave you with that much. I am looking to diversify, though. Hardly sporting to put me in such a narrow box.\"\n\nDeath-the-Fool's grin reached its empty eyes. \"Can't blame us for your attachments: sickly, lonely, and up for smoking's a narrow portfolio. The best thing I ever did was roll the oceans in under liquid death: 'water, water everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.' And Coleridge wasn't even thinking about microplastics! You know, they literally have areas of the ocean called 'dead zones,' now. But, I digress. If we're all in agreement to wager a little more, it's time to fill the pot.\"\n\nThey each felt it: something //of// them -- more than usual -- flowing outward, filling the space around them. It hovered in a fluid nebula, tied to each player. They wanted it for their own reasons: hunger, familiarity, longing, and simple greed. The moment between loss and reward had drawn them back around this table for more games than the rings across its surface.\n\nThose with hands to raise their five cards took them up -- others saw with more inward or missing eyes. Their mutual gazes swept over each other, searching for intent, hesitation, fear, refusal -- for the tells of lies and lying-unlies.  \n\nDeath-the-Fool opened.\n\nDeath-the-Ravenous raised, predictably.\n\nDeath-the-Comfort called.\n\nDeath-the-Absent folded, or was inferred to by the unanimous agreement of those present.\n\nThe rounds progressed, much the same. They were all creatures of familiarity and habit, and their bets and raises were of a substance as arbitrary as any other currency. When the pot had grown too tantalizing, they turned their cards outwards; the masks fell to reveal the naked gambler's excitement beneath.\n\nDeath-the-Fool gazed upon the others' card with joyous familiarity, before laying its own on the table: Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and ten pips -- a Royal Flush.\n\nIt reaped. Death-the-Fool took the pot, all of it, to suffuse, bolster, and expand itself; it savoured new thoughts, spaces, and meanings as they flooded in. It spoke through the chattering of its teeth, echoing across its hollow skull.\n\n\"Well, there goes my luck for the evening.

As he was leaving the event space, Vincent collided with a pedestal upon which sat an ancient Mekhanite vase made of exquisitely blown glass, which was knocked over and began to fall. Vincent attempted to catch the falling vase but slipped -- and reflexively grabbed an ancient Nälkän tapestry mounted on the wall depicting the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-baptism-of-fire Fall of Kalmaktama]. The organic fibres of the tapestry tore as Vincent fell and pulled it from the wall, coinciding with the vase hitting the ground and shattering. The expected cost-at-auction of these items amounted to a sum slightly higher than Vincent Bohart's winnings, which were seized by those present.\n* Vincent Bohart is not known to have disclosed his knowledge of SCP-8004 or the methods through which to employ it to any known individuals.

He turns towards the small assembled crowd; aside from Leonora and Noah, a few of Site-333's staff have chosen to attend. One of the tourists takes a photo and the bright flash distracts Tony for a moment as he tries to begin speaking.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Uh, I want to thank those of you from Site-333 in attendance today. For those of you not from Site-333, uh -- don't think too hard about the implication of anything I'm saying. Consensus reality is not something you need to question, and  -- uh -- the greatest power in the world is the US government. I suppose unless you're religious or something. Vincent wasn't, and that's what we're here to talk about today. Not him not being religious, but him in general. Although the religious stuff's pretty timely in situations like this. Sorry, I'm rambling. I wrote out cards, let me get those.\n\n//Tony Catalano withdraws a set of small paper cards from his suit jacket. He flips through them for a minute before continuing to speak.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Vincent Bohart was not a good man or a kind man. He wouldn't be described as generous, patient, or understanding. He had a habit of pretending not to know your name to avoid needing to speak to you. But despite his faults, he--\n\n//Tony attempts to turn to the next card, appears confused by it, and continues flipping through them before resuming his speech.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Sorry, I misplaced the one after that. I'll just jump right to the next one: Vincent was our boss. We may not have liked it, but he was. Regardless of what Site-333 means to you: if you're here because of a shitty choice you made or because you never had a shot elsewhere, you're still here -- and Vincent was too. He was here through the worst of times, which he was often responsible for, and the best of times, as few as they were.\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Because of his faults, Vincent was an easy man to blame. If you thought your department was underfunded, your hours too long, if you thought he wronged you, it was easy to stack that on top. But we aren't perfect people -- none of us can claim that. Vincent may not have tried his best to lead us, but he did try; that's the memory of Vincent that sticks with me. A man who tries, sometimes -- mostly when it would benefit him, but not exclusively, not always. And I--\n\n//The doors to the funeral parlour swing open, revealing a cloaked figure who strides inward toward the casket. The individual tosses its hood backwards, revealing a bare skull.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** Who the fuck are you? I was talking here!\n\n**SCP-6292:** Hey everyone, sorry I'm late. Been stuck in traffic all afternoon. God this place is seeming dour. Isn't a wake supposed to be a celebration? The next round's on me.\n\n//SCP-6292 approaches the open casket and peers down towards the corpse of Vincent Bohart.//\n\n**SCP-6292:** Always weird seeing them like, this -- you know? Empty? For those of you who don't know, which is most-if-not-all all of you, I've known Vincent for longer than anyone in this room: 33 years. I'm going to be honest, he was always a bit of an enigma to me, a wildcard.\n\n**SCP-6292:** Maybe it's weird for me to be here, but you know, I saw a lot of him in the lead-up to the big moment. Saying goodbye seemed important, even if he's already gone. Maybe you humans are rubbing off on me. They say funerals are for the living, so here's to all of you! Raise a glass, and have some cheer. Let old acquaintance be forgot. Or whatever you do in Atlantic City. I'm not looking to be back here soon, so Tony -- you're going to want to get that lump checked out. You know the one. Back to you!\n\n//SCP-6292 leaves the casket and moves towards the bar, where it begins preparing a cocktail from the available spirits.//\n\n//Tony Catalano continues and concludes his speech; Noah Patel and Leonora Morales make a series of quick remarks before the other attendees are invited to approach the casket before leaving. The trio converges around SCP-6292 as he sips from a cocktail shaker.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** So, you're the one, huh? The clown Vincent cut a deal with?\n\n**SCP-6292:** I prefer 'the fun one,' but yes. Guilty as charged.\n\n**Leonora Moraled:** Sorry, I feel like I'm missing something. What's your deal?\n\n**SCP-6292:** Are we really going to need to go over this again? Vincent had something I wanted. I gave him some more time and was willing to give some more if he pulled off three selfless acts. You can see how that went in the box over there.\n\n**Leonora Morales:** You can just stop people from dying? Does that cost you anything? Are you just letting people die all the time? Why?\n\n**SCP-6292:** I've drunk too much to get into the legalities, and too little to deal with the philosophical points. Let's just say you're not the first one to raise those concerns and you won't be the last. Vincent gave it a go with each of you and fell short. That's how things go and there's no use fighting it.\n\n**Noah Patel:** But, shouldn't we have a say in that? You said he had to do three selfless acts, and that they involved us. Why do you get to be the judge? That doesn't seem fair.\n\n**SCP-6292:** Better question! Truth is, it's not fair -- life's not fair so why should death be any different? On that note though, I've got a game I'm late to, so I've got to run. I'll be seeing you all eventually.\n\n//SCP-6292 finishes its drink and departs the funeral parlour. Most of the visitors have likewise left. Before it leaves, it turns towards the corpse of Vincent Bohart and bows in an exaggerated, performative fashion.//\n\n**Tony Catalano:** What a prick.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __Somewhere__\n+++ ♠♡♦♧//2024//♣♢♥♤\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=image ElfRib.jpg]]\n-----\nDeath-the-Fool was late, but unworried. It knew the others could play a few hands on their own -- doing so would only make them keener to match the rising bets as its turn to deal came.\n\nAs it manifested by the table, it prepared itself to assess its compatriates and competitors and found -- quite immediately -- that something was wrong. Death's multiple forms had been reduced, those familiar impressions were fainter, weaker: Death-the-Ravenous was subdued and feeble, Death-the-Absent had slipped further away into nothingness, and Death-the-Comfort was dishevelled and flustered. The pervasive sense of loss and wrongness disoriented Death-the-Fool as a chill set into its bones.\n\nBut loss wasn't absolute -- power moves and shifts, but never dissipates. It was then that Death-the-Fool saw the figure in the fifth chair: a human, male, in his mid-50s and balding. His sleeves were rolled up, revealing the permanent tan-lines of one whose sunscreenless youth was spent baking under the desert sun. The familiar form of Vincent Bohart looked at him over a hand of cards. But that name slipped away as it came to his mind. The familiarity went deeper, more essential than that association would imply. The once-human form had become infused with something -- his winnings, it deduced.\n\nDeath-the-Bastard smiled and set the cards on the table: a winning hand.\n\n\"Just in time, pull up a chair. It's my turn to deal.\" The weight of implication was carried across each syllable. Death-the-Fool found itself complying, lacking even the recognition of its choice. \"How are you here?\" it managed to ask.\n\nDeath-the-Comfort's hands shook as it lit a cigarette -- then steadied after breathing in the smoke. \"We found him passing through on his way beyond. Clearly, //someone// didn't feel like following things all the way through. He said he knew you, we knew you'd be on your way back here sooner or later, and he asked to sit in and play a hand. Seemed like the thing to do, give the dead their due.\"\n\nDeath-the-Fool cursed, the rasping sound of a retreating glacier, \"Well fucking done, then. Gave the cheating bastard a seat at the table.\"\n\n\"You're one to talk -- what, you didn't feel like sharing with the class?\" Death-the-Bastard interjected. The diminished interests of the others flared towards Death-the-Fool, who squirmed under their gaze. He found himself sitting at the table already, with no recollection of how or when he got there. Whatever force of //self// kept him distinct was being moved around, like a boat in a tempest.\n\nDeath-the-Bastard began dealing out the next hand. Death-the-Fool stared at the regular backs of the cards, thinking. It knew it should rev the weedwhacker that was never far from hand -- despite what it claimed, or that it should run, or throw the pretender out, or beg and plead, or--\n\nBut the time for potential had slipped away, the myriad of responses were narrowed to the hand of cards before it. They grew in number, one by one.\n\nThen it was time to bet.\n\nDeath-the-Bastard filled the pot, poured forward everything he had taken, the matter and meaning of those at the table; all their years and fear and sighs and cries. The space around them swelled and strained. Death-the-Ravenous folded, literally, turning into itself and compressing over and over, its cage growing tighter to enclose its feeble fury. Death-the-Comfort looked sickly, he coughed and bent over, leaning on the table. Death-the-Absent wasn't even there.\n\nWhen it reached Death-the-Fool it was like a whirlwind, tearing at its cloak, rattling its bones, and pulling everything between them outwards, into the growing pot. It couldn't stop it, and suddenly, it was confronted with the sobering reality of its choices: its bets and mistakes -- so much of what it was -- hovered in the space around them.

The others had already departed; whatever was left of them that they hadn't lost would coalesce in time, into new meanings and significance, they'd have until the end of time to do so.\n\nDeath-the-Fool watched as its conquering foe slid the cards together, one-by-one with the patient grace of someone who had utterly and totally won. It broke the silence as Death-the-Bastard broke the deck to shuffle: “So what now?”\n\nDeath-the-Bastard flexed the simmering power he had mantled, just a touch: somewhere the walls of a single-celled organism ruptured, a bird turned towards a window, the unending motions of the earth pushed upwards as tectonic layers shifted far below a quiet Icelandic village. He let the simmering energy dissipate: the wall healed, the bird turned away, and the roiling forces beneath the earth quieted — just a little.\n\n\"Now? Everything. Always and forever. Isn't that how this all works? You know,” he continued, with a voice that reverberated through Death-the-Fool's hollow skull. “You were pretty fucking cheap. You gave me 33 years, it wouldn’t have cost you anything to make that 33 thousand, huh?\"\n\nDeath-the-Fool was silent. \n\n“I’m getting a sense of it now, of what this all means: what you are, they are, we are. It might not be infinite, but it’s pretty fucking close. You could have set me up with more than I’d ever want, ever needed, and moved on. Maybe you come back to visit and have a drink as the sun collapsed in on itself, or when the stars flickered off one by one. You’d have avoided this whole mess, this whole awkwardness. But no. 33 years. That was all you were offering. You wouldn't risk more on such a small game; better to lose //everything// if you're going to lose, right?\"\n\nDeath-the-Bastard shrugged. “I can’t say I’d have done differently. Or maybe I will. -- Although you're not the only one who's been a selfish bastard. I left you with enough to keep going. We can exchange notes, and see where different choices lead us from here on.”\n\n\"You took everything! What's the point of carrying on -- I'm a caricature of myself now. A fucking stamp, I'll be worn down with every touch, every day, until there's not even an impression left. I'll just be a memory -- your memory! I won't even have that dignity in the end!\" Death-the-Fool's wrist cracked as its hands hit the table -- the bone was no more brittle than it had been before, but that wasn't the point.\n\nDeath-the-Bastard set the deck of cards on the table. “Here’s the thing I didn’t get at first. You could have done it too. At any point in the last 33 years, you could have cleared those suckers out; everything I won would have been yours. So, I’m left wondering: why didn’t you?\"\n\n\"The answer’s clear to me now. You didn’t want to win, not really. You wanted the game to keep going because it’s the only one you know, and they’re the only ones you could really play it with. You were never going to risk it all and you were never going to take it all, even though you could. You wanted an advantage, to tip the scales in your favour, but you weren’t about to lay claim to real pot. You just wanted a better chance to be the one gloating.”\n\n“If you had, if you’d played to win, there wouldn’t be a ‘you’ or a ‘them.’ You'd be on the edge of eternity without any more winners or losers. Things would be boring and predictable, death would be rote, absolute. The only thing worse than a casino where you always lose is one where you don't even get to play. Am I right?”\n\nDeath-the-Fool respected itself enough still to bolster in response: “That doesn't answer my damn question: //what now?// Let's say you've called my bluff. You've played the winning hand, but what's next? You got what you wanted, didn't you? You won. So what, are you going to walk away from the table with your pockets full and carry on as Death?\"\n\nDeath-the-Bastard laughed, paused, and laughed again. “You're serious? Pal, I was — well not content, but something like that — running a low-budget Foundation facility in a tourist trap that had somehow become a municipality. I considered it a good start to the day if I got to work by 11. Do I want the responsibility of death from now until the end? Fucking hell, no. Does Death get every second Monday off? I didn't at the Foundation, not officially, but no one gave a shit if I took it off anyway.\"\n\n\"I don't begrudge you your little game, why do you think we run poker nights at 333? I'm more than happy to reset all this, I've already won, haven't I? You -- all of you -- can have what you lost back. If you're willing to cut a deal, that is.\"\n\nSome sort of jolt surged through Death-the-Fool, firing through the missing synapses of its nervous system. Something had been returned, some power, some meaning. \"And what is it you want?\"\n\n“Is this when I’m supposed to say I’ll settle for a normal human life, isn’t it? Another 40 years? If I’m lucky? Am I supposed to look at all this and say: 'Yes, I will accept my mortality and find meaning and reconciliation with death as the one true commonality of the human experience?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" Death-the-Fool knew that whether the question was rhetorical was irrelevant -- it was a prompt, and it said its line on cue. \"I imagine that is what you're supposed to say.\"\n\n\"Yeah, fuck that,\" answered Death-The-Bastard. \"I don't want some shitty deal where I'm hit by a bus in a day and we get to go through all this again. No, if we're making things square, you owe me a lot more. I want to live, Death. And I want to go on living for as long as I damn well please. Maybe I'm a selfish bastard, but so long as I'm living, I can live with that.\n\n\"So here are my terms: I give back what you all chose to lose -- and it was a choice, any of you could have walked away from the table, but none of you did -- and in exchange, I get to live for as long as I choose. I get to keep going, and none of you can touch me. And then, when I'm good and ready for something else, and only then, we'll play another hand. Win or lose, that will be the end.\"\n\n\"Deal?\"\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8003]]] | SCP-8004 | [[[SCP-8005]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** DeathLine.jpg\n> **Author:** Janez iz Kastva\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dance_of_Death_(replica_of_15th_century_fresco;_National_Gallery_of_Slovenia).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** CardBanner.jpg\n> **Author:** Marco Verch\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/30478819@N08/51222538231/in/photostream/\n\n> **Filename:** Abescon_1.png\n> **Author:** Unknown author\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Absecon_Light_House,_Atlantic_City,_New_Jersey.png\n\n> **Filename:** Imp_1.jpg\n> **Author:** Simon Blocquel\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Imp_with_cards_-_illustration_from_Le_grand_Etteilla.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Bridge.jpg\n> **Author:** Mr. Matté\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Great_Egg_Harbor_Bridge,_January_2021.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** SRA.jpg\n> **Author:** ENERGY.GOV\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:HD.6B.491_(11985404135).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Skells.jpg\n> **Author:** anonymous\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** http://hdl.handle.net/10934/RM0001.COLLECT.695120\n\n> **Filename:** Mirrored.jpg\n> **Author:** Dante Gabriel Rossetti  \n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dante_Gabriel_Rossetti_-_How_They_Met_Themselves_(1851-60).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Vulture.jpg\n> **Author:** gailhampshire\n> **License:**  Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Andean_Condor._Vultur_gryphus_(48439926867).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Leonora.jpg\n> **Author:** GT1976\n> **License:**  Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:2017-09-09_Feuerwehrausflug_in_die_Steiermark_(147).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Dopple.png\n> **Author:** Mrs. Collins, Nevit Dilmen\n> **License:** public domain\n> **Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Face_or_vase_JaneAusten.svg\n\n> **Filename:** Babette's.jpg\n> **Author:** Tichnor Bros.
