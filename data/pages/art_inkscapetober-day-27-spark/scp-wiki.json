One of the most aparent facts about Vivarium is that he has ''a frankly odd obsession with lighthouses'', to quote his author page. So that's what the shield is about. I could have made it look more like an ordinary lighthouse, but I thought this to be more elegant. As for the supporters, I have chosen to include two omnious, mysterious and perhaps dangerous figures that are definitely not cultists, how could you possibly think that?\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** Another advantage of using this design of lighthouse is that one can see the tiny spark that generates all the light and even shines further than the shield.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-26-connect| Day 26: Connect]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-28-crispy| Day 28: Crispy]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Vivarium.png\n> **Name:** Vivarium\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nVivarium.png is a composite.
