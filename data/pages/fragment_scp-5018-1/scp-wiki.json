This terminal is physically secured with non-electronic locks and is to remain unpowered outside of authorized testing. Site 15 AI THEIA is to monitor all Foundation networks for suspicious activity fitting SCP-5018's electronic pattern. If discovered, MTF Kappa-10 (\"Skynet\") and MTF Rho-9 (\"Technical Support\") are to be deployed immediately to isolate and purge all instances of SCP-5018.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5018 is an advanced self-replicating malware capable of releasing reinforced magnetic containment locks [[footnote]]Colloquially referred to as MCL's. These have been determined to follow a specific product code of //Item Number: 4510878//. Any continued use of these items has been terminated for all Sites.[[/footnote]] connected to the Foundation network. Analysis of the MCL's indicates that their magnetic field had been disrupted[[footnote]]This has been determined to be caused by the malware terminating electrical power to electromagnets connected to the MCL.[[/footnote]], causing a subsequent repulsion to occur. How SCP-5018 exhibits this ability, and the entity which created the program is still under investigation.[[footnote]]SCP-5018's source code retrieved from memory dumps during its runtime resembles the C programming language. It cannot compile or run in any other conditions than during the anomaly's activity.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-5018's execution command initiates once it confirms the presence of specific parameters in the affected system. The execution of the code triggers the manifestation of SCP-5018-1 within 5 meters of the terminal. \n\nSCP-5018-1 is an indistinct humanoid figure that can only be observed through digitized media and de-manifests when SCP-5018's running code is terminated. Although all attempts at verbal communication with SCP-5018-1 have been unsuccessful, it has been observed to acknowledge others around it through the use of exaggerated body language.[[footnote]]Refer to Experiment Log 5018-B.[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-5018 was discovered on 9/15/████ on the Foundation's network. Probes scanning for its digital signature detected that the malware was spread over 74% of the Foundation network. Of the detected instances, only approximately 10% of them had been executed, with 8% activating in high-security level sites. How SCP-5018 gained access into the Foundation network is under investigation. MTF Rho-9 has been tasked with its removal.\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**Addendum 5018-1**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-grey border-white text-black\" data-title=\"INCIDENT REPORT 5018.1\"]]\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\nIncident Report ID #: 5018-A1\n[[/div]]\n**Summary:** On 07/19/████, Site 119 initiated a 119/B/Coldsilver [http://www.scp-wiki.net/lockdown-procedures Lockdown Response Code] following containment breaches of six Large Scale Aggressors, four Non-Terminable Threats, and five other extradimensional anomalous threats. O4 approved the detonation of Site 119's nuclear warhead one hour and thirty-four minutes after the Lockdown Response Code was initiated. Site 68 received a backup of files, sent by Director David Bold, 26 minutes after the destruction of Site 119. Included in the backup was one folder of encrypted files and one image taken after the detonation. Following the incident, MTF Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") was dispatched to establish a perimeter around the affected area.\n~~~~~\nMTF ε-11 was unable to locate any threats after Site 119's detonation. However, MTF ε-11 reported sightings of 5 unidentified individuals 3 days following Site 119's destruction. MTF ε-11's attempt to apprehend the individuals were unsuccessful[[footnote]]Theories suggesting the individuals may have used anomalous objects to facilitate in their escape are being investigated.[[/footnote]]. MTF ε-11 was immediately relieved by MTF Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") and sent to Site 68 for medical treatment and debriefing. 6 weeks after the detonation, MTF Omicron-2 (\"Nuclear Nomads\") was sent to investigate the remains of Site 119.\n~~~~~\nMTF o-2 discovered 15 compromised MCLs in the remains of Site 119. This incident is recorded as the first insertion point of SCP-5018 into the Foundation's network infrastructure.\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Attached Image: SCP-5018-1\" hide=\"Close Attached Image: SCP-5018-1\"]]\n[[<]]\n> [[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-5018-1/office.jpg]]\n>> The metadata of the original image was 6% corrupted once it was retrieved.
