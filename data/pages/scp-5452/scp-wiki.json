SCP-5452 was programmed in Pavon, an anomalous programming language that uses thaumic methods to create metafictional entities. The object can only be played by one person at any time. All attempts to include other subjects that are not the main player will cause the game to terminate itself until the main player is alone. A new player can play the game only if the previous one completes the plot by marrying one of the SCP-5452-2 instances. The following log was recovered from a text file named README.txt inside one of SCP-5452-1's folders and describes SCP-5452’s rules:\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"► Game Mechanics ◄\" hide=\"▼ Game Mechanics ▼\"]]\n[[<]]\n> Welcome to our community!

Every place has different gifts and every character likes or dislikes specific items, so beware!\n>  * Interact: makes the player interact with a character nearby.\n> * Interaction options include Talk, Gift, Date, and Greet.\n>  * Talk: a short conversation, sometimes letting you choose between lines.\n>  * Gift: uses one of the items earned at a vending machine to offer to the character.\n>  * Date: only available if the person has an amity level above 50%. Gives the option to take the character on a date. Dates are match-three puzzles, similar to Candy Crush. Some gifts can give bonuses here.\n>  * Greet: gives a hug or a kiss.\n> * Depending on the character, each interaction can increase or decrease the amity level.\n> * The game will conclude when the amity level with a character gets to 100%. The Greet interaction will be changed to Marry and will end the game.\n>\n> I wish you luck with the game!

SCP-5452-2 also present metafictional characteristics such as:\n* Retaining memories from previous playthroughs\n* Ability to adapt and learn of its environment outside of the game, even in the absence of the appropriate programming\n* Reacting to visual, auditory, and olfactory stimuli\n* Recognize themself as characters in a game\n* Interacting with other instances even when off-screen\nSCP-5452-2 has also demonstrated telepathy,[[footnote]]Capacity of creating psionic links to read minds or send mental messages.[[/footnote]] psychometry,[[footnote]]Power that permits the user to uncover someone's past by contact.[[/footnote]] empathy,[[footnote]]Extrasensory perception of feelings and emotions.[[/footnote]] and technopathy.[[footnote]]Psionic control over technology.[[/footnote]] The range of these powers is to be determined, but from recent experiments, it appears that most of them solely affect the player. Added below are the specifications of the individual SCP-5452-2 instances:\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-5452-L]]\n\n[[=image l.png]]\n\n**Character Name:** Levin\n**File:** L.anm\n**In-Game Description:** Levin is a half-demon boy and motorcyclist.

A lone wolf, the android boy doesn't show the need for a company but also hates to be alone. He just needs a little push to accept someone and become their significant one.\n**Favorite Location:** The Museum\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-5452-V]]\n\n[[=image v.png]]\n\n**Character Name:** Vivi\n**File:** V.anm\n**Color:** Yellow\n**In-Game Description:** A silly cat girl that you discovered at the park. Playful and gentle, she acts more like a dog than like a cat. This compassionate cutie just wants a lair and someone to hug. Maybe you can be their significant other!\n**Favorite Location:** The Park\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-5452-E]]\n\n[[=image e.png]]\n\n**Character Name:** Eva\n**File:** E.anm\n**In-Game Description:** This shy and insecure girl is your classmate and your old childhood friend that mysteriously turned away from you. Now you know that she did that because she discovered that she is an esper. You’re certain that a little bit of love will take her out of her box and turn her into the strong and powerful girl that she is.\n**Favorite Location:** The School\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-5452-R]]\n\n[[=image r.png]]\n\n**Character Name:** Ramiel\n**File:** R.anm\n**Color:** Pink\n**In-Game Description:** A strange angel that fell from heaven, Ramiel is trying to recover their wings and their place in their world. The easiest and quickest way to do that is loving someone. Ramiel can be a difficult being to deal with, but their love is pure and eternal.\n**Favorite Location:** The Church\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\nThe game also presents a plot. The protagonist, who is always named after the player without any naming input, is a high school student that is returning from school with the SCP-5452-E. The entity claims that it is an esper and it received a vision that five entities are lost in this world and they need to be saved by the protagonist. As the game itself is very confused due to the metafictional interference of the five ANIMA entities, the story tends to change radically through different playthroughs.\n\n**Addendum 5452.1:** Discovery and first analysis\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5452 was discovered inside Unexplained Location, a South Korean LAN gaming center sponsored by ##purple|Arcadia##. The place was designated UE-71135[[footnote]]UE is the standard prefix for Unexplained Locations[[/footnote]] after it was identified as a minor Nexus for electronic game anomalies, including copies of objects already known and contained by the Foundation. In January of 2023, the business was bought and closed by the Foundation.\n\nAfter initial testing, the flash drive was considered a secondary object, as the principal anomaly was the game itself. The flash drive has since been designated as anomalous as it is the only storage item capable of hosting SCP-5452.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Data Log #1 ◄\" hide=\"▼ Data Log #1 ▼\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]] __DATA LOG #1__[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n> SCP-5452 was investigated by a group of six experienced researchers from the Division of Anomalous Programming, a subdivision of the IT Department.

A list of updates was created by Dr. Novakova and is disponible below.\n* SCP-5452 is to be reclassified as Euclid and its Risk Class to be changed to Caution.\n* Special Containment Procedures are to be changed as follows:\n * SCP-5452 is to be contained in a designed computer in Room 5452 at Site-15. This computer is not to be connected to any communication device in any circumstance. SCP-5452 is to be revised weekly by authorized personnel for inspection of the psychological and social behavior of the SCP-5452-1 instances.\n * The research team was advised to watch for any behavior mirroring the acts of SCP-5452-R. Any presentation of emotion between SCP-5452-1 and any of the researchers is to be dealt with. The Metafiction Division is working with Site-15's psychologist to create a schedule to handle the entities’ emotional side, but the procedures are yet to be approved by the Ethics Committee.\n * In the case of any notable alteration, the Research Team shall contact Site-15’s Psychologist. Other authorities are to be contacted only after the psychotechnic evaluation of the SCP-5452-1 entities. If this is necessary, the DIDEROT Protocol will be immediately initiated.\n* Description will suffer major modification:\n * The USB flash drive previously designated SCP-5452-1 was neutralized now that, without SCP-5452-R, it’s no longer the only device that can contain SCP-5452 files. SCP-5452-2 specimens were redesignated SCP-5452-1 for consistency.\n   * The new SCP-5452-1 object is to be added to the SCP-5452-1 descriptions. Its sheet can be seen in the attachments below.\n  * With the neutralization of both the flash drive and SCP-5452-R, descriptions and explanations about the entities are to be added as an addendum and deleted from the main description.\n * The game name was changed to “LOVED”, so both the object designation and mentions to the previous name, “LOVER”, are to be updated.\n* New description about the SCP-5452-1 entities may include:\n * Their lack of memory from their existence before the Reboot or about SCP-5452-R.\n * That their power over the game was shared equally between the specimens during the Reboot, so there is no leader figure anymore.\n* Attached File #2 is to be added to a new addendum.\n@@ @@\n**Attachments:**\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"► SCP-5452-D Character Sheet ◄\" hide=\"▼ SCP-5452-D Character Sheet ▼\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-5452-D]]\n\n[[=image d.png]]\n\n**Character Name:** Daniel\n**File:** D.anm\n**Color:** Orange\n**In-Game Description:** A strange angel that fell from heaven, Daniel is the guardian angel of the protagonist, always trying to protect them.

I decided that I should undo what I’ve created inside SCP-5452, so I hacked into the game and I am trying to fix it. The procedure is simple: I will become part of the game and will mix my files with SCP-5452-R’s files to become a new entity. I’ll temporarily maintain my conscience while doing so, but I'll lose all my memories and personality when the game reboots. I know you’re smart enough to understand the minutiae of what I’ll be doing, but that’s not why I’m sending this to you.\n\nAs I studied SCP-5452 with you I felt the need to understand Love. You see, every SCP-5452-2 entity has their vision about Love: E’s Love is needy, it needs company, needs attention, needs contact. R’s Love is dominant, is all about control, about having the person for yourself and yourself only. V’s Love is about sacrifice and confidence. O and L’s Love is greedy and narcissistic, focused on themselves more than on the others. I was confused about that and I need to understand it.\n\nSo I decided to do this, become part of the game. As SCP-5452-R got out of control due to my “emotional infection” and is the one that is controlling the game and making everyone’s life hell, they are the one that I’ll use to recreate the game. Hope you don’t get any punishment due to this. Have a good life, Dr. Novakova.\n\nYours truly,\n\nDiderot.aic\n\n**PS:** I’ll leave a \"backdoor entrance\" in the object. If anything goes wrong after I’m gone, use it to reboot the game again by rearranging the game data. I suggest you name it DIDEROT Protocol.
