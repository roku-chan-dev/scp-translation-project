Pietrykau:** I'd like to thank you all for joining me today.\n\n**Dir. Bold:** Forgive me, but I was under the impression that we'd be presenting to the entire Council?\n\n**O5-8:** We're spread rather thin at the moment -- a lot of fires to put out these days, as I'm sure you all know.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Many of them literal, yes.\n\n**Dir. Bold:** //<muttering>// Fucking climate change.\n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** Those metaphorical fires, as it happens, directly pertain to why we're meeting here today. As you can see here...\n\n= //<Dir. Pietrykau shifts a sheaf of papers across the table to O5-8.>//\n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** The rate at which we've been discovering new Anomalies has increased by over 44% in just the past decade. \n\n**O5-8:** Yes, the expansion has been... worrying. There was a time when we would fill maybe a dozen, two dozen slots per quarter. Now it feels like we fill twice that many a //day//. \n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** You're not far off with that estimate, actually.\n\n**O5-8:** Any idea as to the cause? And if so, what is the feasibility of containment?\n\n**Dir. Bold:** If only it were that simple.\n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** Were this trend Anomalous, perhaps we'd have better news. Unfortunately, the root of our problem lies in mundane statistics.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** Anomalies, as a common rule, beget more Anomalies. Non-euclidean spaces distort surrounding geometries, thaumaturges imbue everyday objects with magicks and teach their craft to baseline humans while Anomalous wildlife reproduces,  crossbreeds, and mutates with abandon. The amount of damage a single reality bender can do to the Veil in the space of a weekend is, frankly, staggering, even while not considering the rest of the picture.  \n\nBetween the natural rate of aberrant proliferation, increases in unlicensed thaumaturgy, the recent surge of hive-minds in Free Ports... We're on the verge of an \"Anomalous baby boom\" that, if left unchecked, will throw us directly into an [[[SCP-6383|NMK-Class \"End of Normalcy\" Scenario]]].[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]An event wherein Anomalies, either through overwhelming influence over reality, sheer numbers, or some other combination of factors, render Normalcy and maintenance of the Veil impossible.[[/span]]\n\n**O5-8:** What solutions do we have?\n\n**Dir. Bold:** Decommissioning appears to be the only remaining option with potential for long-term sustainability. We simply do not have the resources to continue containment as we have been. Unfortunately, we're not sure if that is even an option at the moment.\n\n**O5-8:** Right. Logistical complexities. \n\n**Dir. Bold:** For starters, yes. You're well aware decommissioning isn't an inexpensive process. On top of that, precautions are necessary to avoid worsening an Anomaly's effects or bringing harm to Foundation property and staff, there's the cost of developing and manufacturing appropriate equipment to ensure maximal success rates, etcetera.\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** The aftermath is nearly as expensive, too. The process of Acroamatic Abatement -- the disposal of Anomalous waste products -- makes radioactive waste handling look [[[SCP-7243 |risk-free]]] by comparison. Each Anomaly has unique parameters for disposal, I assume it's the same for decommissioning as well. \n\n**Dir. Bold:** Absolutely, and decommission success rates have been decreasing, on top of everything else, by over 25% in the past three years. \n\n**O5-8:** So, Anomalies are getting harder to put down, too. Do we know why?\n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** Statistics again. It's a simple cultural shift -- the longer the Foundation exists, the more likely that Anomalous cultural cells and organizations are to create countermeasures against us. It seems related Anomalies are adapting to our methods as a result.\n\n**O5-8:** Hmmm. Highly concerning. What are we thinking? Disinformation campaigns? Memetic agents? How much do we need to spend to get something like that off the ground nowadays?\n\n**Dr. Reynders:** We have some rough ideas for avenues of research and subterfuge we could pursue -- where is that spreadsheet?\n\n= //<[DELETED] hands O5-8 a piece of paper.>//\n\n**O5-8:** Thank y--\n\n= //<Silence on recording.>//\n\n**Dir.

Pietrykau handed across the table.>//\n\n**Dir. Bold:** For the record I, um, believe I just saw a disembodied arm give the Overseer a document, and then disappear.\n\n**Dir. Pietrykau:** Has the facility been breached?\n\n= //<O5-8 calmly holds down a button on the table, leaning forward to speak into a built-in microphone.>//\n\n**O5-8:** I need a memetics team here for an emergency inspection, possible cognitohazard inoculation necessary.

The upper half of my body is gone. When did that happen?\n\n**Control:** You... don't seem too concerned.\n\n**D-6183:** I am. Well, I was, but that was before I uh, started turning into candle wax and uh... fucking, fettuccine. \n\n**Control:** Sorry, fettuccine?\n\n**D-6183:** It's a type of pasta.\n\n**Control:** I'm aware. You just haven't mentioned any pasta-related activity until now. \n\n**D-6183:** Yeah, well, feels like time doesn't move the same way over here, as if I can see ▃ ▊ ▄ ▜▜ ▏▆ ▜▞ ▍▐ ▂▚▟ and it can see me too. Sometimes you talk really slow, sometimes I can barely keep up. Other times you just ignore me completely. I'm also realizing that I'm not alone down here. Never was. \n\n**Control:** Who is with you?\n\n**D-6183:** Me. Pieces of me, and pieces of others. So many little fragments, in these black clouds. You-- You soak them up and they fill in the blank spaces that have been erased. Deleted.\n \nLike a thousand thousand-piece jigsaw puzzles, all with missing pieces, thrown into one box. A puzzle can be completed but the picture is a patchwork. I feel hundreds down here. They're all waiting. Waiting to die, but death never arrives. The construct is flawed. The wheel has been broken. The mirror reflects a negative. Equal and opposite forces. Why does this feel familiar? Who am I?\n\n**Control:** Can you still move? \n\n**D-6183:** Yes. Well, no. Well, sorta. I can move in some directions. Towards the stairwell, for example. If I try to leave this hallway, I start to lose pieces of myself. I can feel it. It //hurts//. \n\nI think-- I think I've been marked. It's why I can't leave. Not this way. \n\n**Control:** What do you mean?\n\n**D-6183:** I got a pretty big promotion.\n\n**Control:** Promotion? D-Class don't... get promoted. \n\n**D-6183:** All the more reason to accept. They've even assigned me a super important mission.\n\n**Control:** And what does this mission entail, exactly? \n\n**D-6183:** Message delivery.\n\n= //<Audio feed is lost shortly after and is not recovered.
