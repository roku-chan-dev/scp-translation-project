KNOW THAT THEY ARE DIVINE BY THEIR FIVE ARMS AND FIVE TENTACLES, THE EMANATION OF THE LORD HIMSELF.]]\n\nThe Southern Baptist Fifthist Church of Pensacola rarely - in all honesty - actually had full attendance. Most of the attendees were of those \"January 5th and 5Ã—5 Day only goers\" types, that //said// they were Fifthists but really only went for the big holidays (but of course, all the while looking down on everyone else who did the same.)\n\nBut it just so happens that the literal end of the world could get even those types off their couches and into pews. Who knew! A scoop of armageddon, handful of eschaton and a little something of what those Foundation eggheads called an ``MH-Class 'Large-Scale Aggressor Overrun' Scenario'' works //wonders// for bringing out the faith in us all.\n\nWhen the first of these so-called \"angels'' had crashed down on the shore of Hy-Brasil, only a few had actually believed it was anything of the sort. Sure, it had five arms, five tentacles, and five eyes, and a lot of people tended to hear its voice whisper things to them after it had died, but the Global Occult Coalition had __killed__ it. Angels weren't supposed to die!\n\nBut then the other angels came, and boy howdy were there a lot of those. The argument that these were the beasts causing the apocalypse became a lot more convincing when there were ,,5,,5^^5^^ of them, crawling all over the world, mindlessly killing everything they could see and doing their level best to wipe out human civilization as we know it.\n\nAt the very least, the members of the Southern Baptist Fifthist Church of Pensacola were convinced that the world was ending, and they might just want to get on the good side of T[[size 80%]]HE[[/size]] L[[size 80%]]ORD[[/size]] before the end. Was it an automatic pass into heaven if you died in church? Maybe? Hopefully? Probably not. The optics looked good, at least.\n\nThe congregation had all filed in -- with a couple of new converts, who had heard about these people who claimed the kaiju eating the world were their own angels and at the very least thought it'd be interesting to give that a listen -- and crowded the pews.\n\nThe pastor -- a man who had previously spent most of his time preaching that the great {{5}}tarfish above would help those who helped themselves, and faith in Him would be rewarded with riches fivefold -- stepped forward to preach to the choir. A part of him, in truth, //was// indeed connected with the entity that poked through reality and had coiled around the concept of a Southern Baptist Church, but that part of him was the //religious// part and was subservient to his greed.\n\nBut at the end of the world, greed tends to fall quiet and faith tends to start screaming.\n\n[[div class=\"kaiju\"]]\n+++ THE COLOSSI THAT WALK OUR WORLD ARE NOT DEMONS, BUT ANGELS SENT FROM BELOW.

IT IS OUR DUTY AS THE CHILDREN OF GOD TO ACCEPT HIS HOLY WISDOM AND WILL,[[footnote]]Joshua 1:9 -- //Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.//[[/footnote]] AND SO WE LAY OUR LIVES DOWN BEFORE THE ANGELS AND THE FLOOD.\n\n+++ MAY THE ANGELS PURGE THIS WORLD WITH THEIR HOLY FIRE AND MAY THEY CLEANSE IT WITH THEIR FLOOD[[footnote]]Genesis 7:11 -- //In the five hundredth year of Noah's life, in the fifth month, on the fifth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst forth, and the windows of the heavens were opened.//[[/footnote]], FOR WE ARE SINNERS IN THE TENTACLES OF AN ANGRY GOD.\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\" \"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe problem with most Southern Baptist Fifthists was that any of the truly devout had their minds addled by their devotion to ,,5,,5^^5^^5,,5,,, which had the nasty habit of completely replacing the intellect of anyone who followed it. And anybody who wasn't truly devout most certainly wasn't going to listen to a sermon like that.\n\nBut as the pastor rambled on concerning the wrath of God and how Man had managed to draw it, there was a roar outside. It started alone and was then was joined by a choir. The choir inside the church shut up and looked outside.\n\nA swarm of so-called angels had descended upon Pensacola, hundreds of the little angels, not one taller than thirty feet tall. These were some of the smaller of the harbingers of the apocalypse - the big ones towered into the clouds, after all. Together, their cries drowned out all other noise in the world and to the ears of the Southern Baptist Fifthist Church of Pensacola, it was nothing less than beautiful.\n\nIdeally, the churchgoers would lay their lives down before the swarm of angels that had come to deliver divine reckoning to them. But, unfortunately, as we have established, most members of the congregation were only tangentially Fifthist and reacted as any normal person would to a horde of five armed, five tentacled crocodile-squid-dinosaur-monsters.\n\nWhich is to say, not very well.\n\nThe beach around them had already erupted into chaos, with civilians and tourists trying to escape. Some souls had heard that the apocalypse was coming and had elected to continue on with their vacation plan? Was that stupid or prudent? I know that I, for one, would rather die on vacation than in Gary, Indiana.\n\nThe pastor was the only member of the congregation to embrace the angels. Without fear, he walked forward, a puppet dancing on the fifty strings of a greater being from out of time and out of space. Devout men and women stepped forward, walking behind their leader.\n\nHe stepped forward and his mind fell apart. His connection to {{FIVE}} had always been present, but seeing something that was so closely tied with {{FIVE}} brought it forward and ripped every other bit of his mind out, leaving it on the cutting room floor.\n\nHis fingers graced an angel for just a second before his head was in the stomach of the beast, and in that second he knew divinity.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
