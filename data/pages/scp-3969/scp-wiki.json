No further containment procedures have been deemed necessary at this time.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3969 is a middle-aged human male of Irish-American descent. SCP-3969's primary anomalous property appears to render it invulnerable to numerous forms of injury, disease, and aging -- although whether SCP-3969 is entirely impervious to these ailments or merely resistant to them remains unclear.\n\nSCP-3969 claims to have acquired its anomalous properties through an extensive thaumaturgic ritual involving \"consuming 138 fermented lima beans a day\", \"bathing in the blood of a blind coyote\", and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Investigation of these claims is ongoing.\n\nSCP-3969 first came to the attention of Foundation personnel in Seattle, Washington, following reports of a local derelict falling from the roof of a seven-story apartment building and emerging unscathed. Upon confirmation of its anomalous abilities, SCP-3969 was detained and transported to Site-17 for questioning.\n\nA transcript of this interview, conducted by Dr. Phillip Grant, has been attached to this file below.\n\n**Addendum 1:** First interview\n\n> **Date:** 9/16/2008\n> @@ @@\n> **Objective:** Ascertain the source of SCP-3969's anomalous properties.\n> ------\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> @@ @@\n> **SCP-3969:** I always knew this would happen.\n> @@ @@\n> **Dr. Grant:** What do you mean?\n> @@ @@\n> **SCP-3969:** Nothing.
