Site-43, under the supervision of PENTAGRAM, is to remotely monitor Nx-84 via aerial reconnaissance. PENTAGRAM, as well as Foundation and UIU personnel, are prohibited from operating in Nx-84.\n\nFollowing Nx-84's expansion to its current size, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7993 Agent-7993] has been deployed to remove any interest or attachment to the former United States East Coast to prevent any civilian attempts to explore Nx-84 or SCP-7035-2.\n\nSite-43 is to remain the main supervisory site for SCP-7035, despite recent events, due to it remaining the next nearest site, with Site-55, Site-28, Site-83, Site-98, Site-322, and Area-179 having been destroyed and Site-184 not possessing the required facilities for the oversight of SCP-7035.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7035 is a nineteen-year-old human female that is capable of opening Extrauniversal Selective Ways[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Ways capable of transporting entrants with specific traits between universes. One of the rarest and most difficult to recreate ways.[[/span]] on mirrors. Ways created by SCP-7035 lead to SCP-7035-2, a universe that has significantly diverged from the baseline (>10Â°). SCP-7035 can only create Ways on surfaces that exist in the exact location[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]In relation to Earth[[/span]] in SCP-7035-2 as in the Baseline Universe. SCP-7035 is only capable of maintaining one way at a time, designated as SCP-7035-A.\n\nAll objects and living beings tested so far have been able to pass through SCP-7035-A with the exception of SCP-7035.\n\n**Addendum June/1976:** \n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Interview|06/24/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7035\n\n**Interviewer:** Field Agent Burke\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-7035 was discovered by the USCGC //Fir// during routine inspection and maintenance of Lighthouses in the Boston Area. The following is a transcript of a conversation between James Burke, a Foundation plant working as a Boatswain's Mate on the //Fir// and SCP-7035.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Hey, how are you holding up? It was pretty cold out there before we found you.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm fine.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You sure? How'd you end up all alone out there anyways?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm not supposed to talk about it. Can I get another drink?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Sure, I'll go grab one.\n\n//Field Agent Burke leaves the room to get another drink for SCP-7035. As he is gone SCP-7035 can be heard sniffling.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Alright, I got one for you and one for me. \n\n**SCP-7035:** Thanks.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Are you sure you're doing okay?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm...lost. I've been lost before, but not like this. I'm lost and nothing is the same here, everything is destroyed.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yeah, I'm not used to it either.\n\n**SCP-7035:** No, you don't understand. It's not that I'm not used to it. I'm not supposed to be here.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Are you talking about your home? We're trying to help you get there, but first, we need to get somewhere safe.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I don't live in this world. I'm trapped in this world and I can't go back, I don't know why.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Ah. That's...are you sure you're okay? I think the cold might be getting to you.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I said I was fine! Can't you understand? I don't belong here. I come from a different world, a world that used to be the same as this place. Before something changed in //your// world. I'm only here because my stupid powers stopped working.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Powers?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Yeah, I don't like calling them that but it's the best description I have. I can open portals on mirrors, but only specific ones. I think it only works on mirrors that exist in both my world and yours. I called yours, the world we're in right now, the mirror world. And now it won't let me back into my world, for some reason.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** And you said your world used to be the same as this one?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Yes. Until everything in your world got destroyed. I stopped using my portals after that because there wasn't anything or anyone to visit anymore. I didn't like seeing Wonder World like that. The air alone would make me feel sick.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Wonder World? We found you in Boston.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Where I'm from is called Wonder World. It's a magical city, hidden in Boston from most people. When I came here and realized my portals wouldn't let me back I left to find help, where I found you guys at the lighthouse.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Could anyone else from Wonder World open portals?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I don't know, but I never found anyone else that could and I never told anyone about my powers. \n\n**Field Agent Burke:** How many people lived in Wonder World?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Thousands. It was a great place, I wish more could experience the joy of living there but there were groups that wouldn't allow that. I hope I can fix my portals and get back soon. I miss my family. My friends. Everyone.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** We'll try our best to help you. For now though, unfortunately, We'll have to bring you to a secure facility where some people are going to talk to you. It's not every day we find people out here and they're making sure you aren't a threat.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Why can't you just help me go home?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** It's not my choice to make. I will help you as much as I can but eventually, the people looking over you will outrank me, by a lot. Eventually, I will have to turn you over. Its procedure.\n\n**SCP-7035:** You're going to leave me!? How long will I be with these people?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I'm not sure, and yes I will have to leave you eventually. As I said it's not my choice to make.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Please don't leave me. You said you were going to help me get back home. That's what you said when you found me. The other people sound like they don't care. Please don't leave.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I...I don't... I can't stay, I have a job here on this cutter, and they won't let me go where I'm bringing you, It's above my pay grade.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Then I won't leave this boat.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** That's unreasonable. If you cooperate with them they will help you.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I don't care. I'm not leaving.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I can escort you there but that's it, I can't be with you forever.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm staying.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Look, I don't think you understand how much trouble I will get in if they find out you are being uncooperative because of me. Please, I have no choice.\n\n**SCP-7035:** You better make a call or something, because I am only leaving with you. I don't know anyone in this world, everyone I know here is dead.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You don't even know me!\n\n**SCP-7035:** You found me, and we've been talking for a while in this boat. You're the closest thing I have to someone I know.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I can't just make a call.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Tough luck.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You... Fine, I'll ask but I already know the answer.\n\n//Field Agent Burke leaves the room once again to contact his command, requesting permission to be temporarily relieved of his duty on the USCGS Fir in order to escort SCP-7035 personally. This request was approved. He reenters the room to end the interview with SCP-7035.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You will stay under my custody for the time being. We both leave this ship in a few hours.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Really?! It was that easy?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Unfortunately. This concludes our initial interview.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** A investigation of \"Wonder Land\" is currently being proposed by a planned JTF[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Joint Task Force, comprised of Foundation, UIU, and PENTAGRAM personnel[[/span]] Whiskey-12 \"Wonderful World\". SCP-7035 has been transferred to Site-43, and Field Agent Burke has been assigned to SCP-7035.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Nx-84 \"Wonder World\" Dossier| 06/30/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Nexus #:** Nx-84\n\n**Foundation Designation:** [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wonder-world-dossier Wonder World]\n\n**Population:** No permanent population, prior to October 1967 around 5,000 citizens.\n\n**Area Class:** Briar\n\n**Nexus Interaction Protocol:** Personnel are to wear NBC[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Nuclear, biological, chemical[[/span]] suits when in or around Nx-84 due to non-anomalous fallout in the area.\n\n**Containment Facility:** Site-43\n\n**Description:** Wonder World is located in a vast spatial anomaly, which is itself located in the former Boston, MA, USA. Prior to October 27th, 1967, Wonder World was a city that maintained, various industrial parks, research facilities, housing developments, schools, a university, and the headquarters of GOI-386[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Dr. Wondertainment.[[/span]].\n\nThe former population size or demographics of Nx-84 is largely unknown, however, testimonies by SCP-7035 and evidence recovered indicate that there were approximately five thousand citizens. The investigation into the culture of Nx-84 and testimonies by SCP-7035 have revealed that the population of Nx-84 followed a similar calendar to the Baseline world, sharing a majority of holidays and using a Gregorian-like system to measure years. However, the population of Nx-84 observed \"Wonder Years\", starting with the founding of the Dr. Wondertainment Company, in 1909.\n\nTestimonies by SCP-7035, the sole surviving Nx-84 citizen in the Baseline Universe, have revealed the goal of Nx-84 was referred to as \"Wondermaking\", the idea that life's purpose is to make the world a more wonderful place. The exact meaning of this idea appears to have been decided on a case-by-case basis by each citizen of Nx-84.\n\n**Addendum:** Nx-84 features little remaining anomalous properties, but remains within a spatial anomaly.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum July/1976:** \n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Interview|07/01/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7035\n\n**Interviewer:** Field Agent Burke\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-7035 requested a private conversation with Field Agent Burke once arriving at Site-43. While this request was initially denied, it was ultimately approved once SCP-7035 refused to participate in any preliminary interviews before this conversation.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Good morning, SCP-7035.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Hey Burke. Can you call me by my real name?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Sure, normally it would be against protocol but normally I wouldn't be here so...What do you want me to call you? \n\n**SCP-7035:** Alice.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Well, Alice, they told me you were being uncooperative. Isn't the whole reason I'm here so you'd cooperate?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I was being cooperative, but I was overwhelmed and wanted to talk to you. My whole life I was told to hide from people like the Foundation, and now they're my only hope. It feels wrong.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yeah...You'll be fine here.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Were you going to say something else?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** No, I just misspoke.\n\n**SCP-7035:** The last thing I need is for //you// to start lying to me. I already don't trust the Foundation, but like I said I have no choice. I just wish you guys didn't destroy Wonder World.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** //We// didn't destroy anything! It was those fucking soviets! The Foundation just intervened.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I wasn't accusing you of doing anything, I meant in a broader sense the...\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You meant the Foundation, or in your mind what the Foundation is, right? The Foundation barely exists anymore, it's more of a name, a division of PENTAGRAM. I know you don't know any better but don't group me with those people.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I wasn't implying you were responsible, and how would I know not to associate you with the Foundation, do you not work for them?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** In name only. I used to be in the Coast Guard. Joined right before the war. After the nukes hit, we, those who didn't know of the anomalous, thought that was the worst of it. Then we got orders, not from our command but straight from the Pentagon. We knew little information but our mission was to keep an eye on inland. Hundreds of anomalies from about a dozen Foundation sites were loose on the now ruined East Coast.\n\n**SCP-7035:** So you're in the Coast Guard?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yes, but I have to wear this stupid uniform. I stayed in because I had nothing left, and now I am a Field Agent, \"undercover\" in the Coast Guard. Everyone on my ship knew I was working with Pentagram, it's hard to hide the anomalous and those who deal with it these days, especially in the military. \n\n**SCP-7035:** Is that why you didn't want to come here?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Partially, yeah. I also didn't think you needed me so much. Why is that anyways?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I just don't want to be alone, and you found me. We talked for a long time. I've told you all this before.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I know, it just doesn't make sense to me.\n\n**SCP-7035:** When you were talking to me on the ship, I felt there was something different about you. You weren't the stereotypical government type, the kind I was told to fear. It felt like you wanted to help, to make things better. I also want to make things better, it's what I was taught to do in Wonder World.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** You got all of that from our first conversation?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm very observant. \n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I don't think that's the right word, but I get what you mean I think. Regardless, I think you're wrong. I'm not trying to change things, to make them //better//. After I found out how bad things were, I gave up.\n\n**SCP-7035:** There is more to look forward to, and change to be made. We can make the world better.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** All that we have to look forward to was either destroyed or stopped by the government when they contained SCP-7992.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm sure it's not that bad. And even if it is, we have two worlds, remember? Sure this one is sad, and kinda destroyed but there is an entire Earth, untouched by the events that happened here. You can visit that place, and when I go back I'm sure I can get help for this world.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I don't...\n\n//SCP-7035 interrupts Field Agent Burke.//\n\n**SCP-7035:** Remember, things can get better, Think of the future, an optimistic future.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I can't think of any...I'll try...I look forward to you getting back to your world. I'm glad that I can help at least one person.\n\n**SCP-7035:** That's...the most bitter-sweet sentence I've ever heard.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** It's true though. When I think about it, the only good thing I have going is helping you. I've done nothing but watch the world get worse for the last decade basically. I hope you make it back safely, and when you do perhaps we can get some help, I just hope the Foundation there is...\n\n**SCP-7035:** Is?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Nothing. Let's just focus on the bright side, getting you back home, right?\n\n**SCP-7035:** That's the spirit.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yeah...Well, it was nice talking, SCP-7035. I think I have to go now.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I thought you didn't do anything here?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I still have paperwork, unfortunately.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Ah, well I'll talk to you some other time.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Interview|07/02/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7035\n\n**Interviewer:** Field Agent Burke and Dr. Sanders\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a transcript of an interview between Dr. Sanders, accompanied by Field Agent Burke, and SCP-7035.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Good morning, Alic...SCP-7035. This is Dr. Sanders, he'll be talking to you today while I stay here to make sure you are comfortable.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** I'm just going to ask a few questions, this shouldn't take long. After this, we'll run a few tests with your powers. Only with your full permission of course.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Why can't Burke ask the questions, is he not allowed to?\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** He's allowed to talk, but for this conversation, I will be asking the questions as I am trained for this type of thing and Burke is, respectfully, out of his comfort zone.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** He's right, I'm out of my league here.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I guess that makes sense.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Great. Let's get started. When did you first notice you had powers?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I first realized I have powers when I was nine, so about ten years ago. It wasn't until I was about thirteen that I could effectively use my portals.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** And how would you use these portals?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Initially I would use them to visit the mirror Wonder World and meet people I already knew for a second time. I...I'd sometimes redo conversations with people that I made upset in my world.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** I see, and did anyone else know about your powers? I'm sure there were people who would find your abilities interesting.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Not many people knew about my portals. I told a few friends, both from this world and my home, but it was never a public thing.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Why keep it a secret, were there people that would've taken advantage of your abilities? \n\n**SCP-7035:** In Wonder World? No. Outside? Yes. There were groups in the city that would've kidnapped me and sold me or something worse. I was also told when growing up that there were groups in the normal world that would seek to contain all things unnatural, so pretty much everything in Wonder World. The Foundation being one of them.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Do you feel any hostilities towards The Foundation?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Me personally, no. I was hoping if I worked with you I could go home.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** That's good to hear, and I also hope we can help you. After we figure out more about you, of course.\n\n//Field Agent Burke shuffles in his seat and crosses his arms.//\n\n**SCP-7035:** You doing okay, Burke?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** What..oh, uh.\n\n//Dr. Sanders glares and Field Agent Burke. SCP-7035 does not notice this.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yeah, I'm fine. Just a bit tired.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** SCP-7035, can you tell me more about your abilities?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I can make portals between my world and this one on mirrors, but only specific ones. And up until recently, I could pass through these portals.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Could anyone else pass through these portals?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Yeah, at least they used to. I haven't had the chance to try it since I've been trapped here. I could also bring things through.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Ok, and what specific mirrors would work?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm not sure, but I know I couldn't use portable mirrors or any brand-new mirrors. I'd usually stick to older ones. Ones that haven't moved in a while.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** What about Wonder World? Could you tell me more about that?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Well, It was a city within a city. A magical place that only the innocent-minded could enter. Where nothing bad ever happened. A place where everybody's goal was to spread child-like happiness.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Why'd you leave? Especially considering you claimed to know our world was destroyed.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Is that important?\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Yes, every question I ask is very important.\n\n//SCP-7035 looks at Field Agent Burke. He looks back and shrugs. SCP-7035 deeply exhales before beginning to speak.//\n\n**SCP-7035:** I was running from someone I made very upset. I ran to the mirror world. When I tried to make my way back I realized I was trapped. After trying to get back for...hours...I left Wonder World, or what's left of it, and was found by Burke.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** Why was someone upset with you?\n\n**SCP-7035:** I really don't see how that's important.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** I assure you this is all necessary, after all, we need to trust you. \n\n**SCP-7035:** I...I might have been cheating with my boyfriend, with himself. He found out and freaked out, and I ran.\n\n**Dr. Sanders:** That's surprising, but not an issue. I'm sorry you had to talk about it, but we need to make sure you don't have a violent history. The good news though, this concludes our interview for today. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Burke will now escort you back to your room.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** Site-43 granted permission to test SCP-7035's claims of creating 'portals' between the Baseline and its alleged home world.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Initial testing|07/07/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **Test 01:**\n> \n> **Protocol:** SCP-7035 is provided with a hand-held mirror and is told to create a 'portal'\n> \n> **Results:** In accordance with SCP-7035's claims, the hand-held mirror fails to host a portal created by SCP-7035.\n\n> **Test 02:**\n> \n> **Protocol:** A full body mirror was wheeled into the test chamber and SCP-7035 is told to create a 'portal'\n> \n> **Results:** Similar results to test 01.

SCP-7035-2 is a parallel universe of substantial value.\n\n**O5-1:** What makes SCP-7035-2 different from the dozens of other parallel universes? Why is it important?\n\n**SCOUT:** Well, SCP-7035-2 is the first parallel universe we have discovered since Pentagram has been overseeing Foundation operations. The Foundation has been confirmed to exist inside of SCP-7035-2, implying they could still have access to anomalies we no longer have.\n\n**O5-5:** That's a bit of a jump. What anomalies are you even referring to?\n\n**SCOUT:** To name a few we hope they have SCP-2000, 6999, as well as an unused Project 39B-1955-N.\n\n**O5-5:** Wait, unused? What is the divergence degree of SCP-7035-2?\n\n**SCOUT:** My team at Site-43 believe SCP-7035-2 has a difference of over ten degrees, up to thirty. We need to further explore SCP-7035-2 to...\n\n**O5-5:** Are you asking permission to send a team into the anomaly?\n\n**SCOUT:** Yes, but I'm also requesting to submit a proposal for a plan I've created, which would involve cooperating with their Foundation for a limited time.\n\n**O5-5:** Work with them? We haven't even contacted them yet. What makes you think we will work with them, how do you even know if they will work with us?\n\n**SCOUT:** I intend to send a copy of my proposal with the exploration team, it will also be our first contact.\n\n**O5-5:** That's not ho...\n\n**O5-1:** Send us the proposal, and we will inform you of our decision within a week.

We can remove any trace of SCP-7993. The ties with the rest of the world can be rebuilt, we can end the war.\n\n**O5-5:** I hope you know the stakes of making such grandiose goals.\n\n**SCOUT:** I understand.\n\n**O5-1:** Director Scout, you better have a good plan.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n-----\n\n+ Operation Spiral Renegade\n\n++++ APPROVED BY HIGH COMMAND & THE EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT.\n\n------\n\n**Classification:** Top Secret, FOUO\n\n**Parties Involved:** United States PENTAGRAM, The Foundation.\n\n**Foreword:** The following plan was developed by Site-43 Director Scout, who has overseen the initial containment and study of SCP-7035. \n\n**Proposed Action Plan:** \n: Stage one : JTF Whiskey-12 \"Wonderful World\" will contact Site-43-2[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Entities, locations, and organizations inside of SCP-7035-2 are documented with a -2[[/span]] and deliver a false copy of this plan, they will be provided with minimal information to prevent diplomatic interference on their part.\n: Stage two : Upon successful contact and the establishment of a mutual cooperation agreement, construction on SCP-7035-A1 will begin. SCP-7035-A1 will be a 300ft by 120ft mirror constructed in the former Site-55 and Site-55-2 which will be used as the primary accessway to SCP-7035-2. The large size of SCP-7035-A1 is due to the requirement for vehicles and other large objects to pass through it.\n: Stage three : Once SCP-7035-2 has been properly assessed and the location of SCP-2000 and Project 39B-1955-N are discovered a rapid covert acquisitions team will be dispatched to retrieve the objects. At the same time, JTF Whiskey-12 will launch several attacks on Site-55-2, initially targeting its communications capabilities to prevent any notice of this attack from reaching their High Command.\n: Stage four : When the objects are retrieved and secure, SCP-7035 will be ordered to close SCP-7035-A1 before being placed into an indefinite medically induced coma, to prevent it from reopening SCP-7035-A1.\n\n**Predicted Resulting Action:** Following a successful enaction of this plan the United States PENTAGRAM would have access to SCP-2000, which would aid in the recreation of the East Coast, as well as an intact Project 39B-1955-N, which could be used to undo the effects of Project Protector.\n\n------\n**O5 COUNCIL VOTE TO RUN A DECEPTION OPERATION IN ORDER TO ACQUIRE HIGHLY VALUABLE ASSETS FROM SCP-7035-2, EFFECTIVELY ENDING ANY DIPLOMATIC CHANNELS WITH SCP-7035-2:**\n\n\n||~ Y ||~ N ||~ Abstain ||\n|| O5-1 ||  ||  ||\n||  || O5-2 ||  ||\n||  ||  || O5-3 ||\n|| O5-4 ||  ||  ||\n|| O5-5 ||  || ||\n|| O5-6 ||  ||  ||\n||  ||  || O5-7 ||\n|| O5-8 ||  ||  ||\n|| O5-9 ||  ||  ||\n||  || O5-10 ||  ||\n|| O5-11 ||  ||  ||\n|| O5-12 ||  ||  ||\n||  ||  || O5-13 ||\n\nOPERATION SPIRAL RENEGADE APPROVED.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ SCP-7035-2 Exploration\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 08/18/1976\n\n**Exploration Team:** JTF Whiskey-12 \"Wonderful World\"\n\n**Protocol:** SCP-7035 opened SCP-7035-A in the same manner as in test 03.

We have strict orders to make contact and deliver the message ASAP.\n\n**W-4:** I agree, we can then research the smaller things later.\n\n**W-4:** I agree, we can then research the smaller things later. For now, We should just move on and make contact with the Foundation here.\n\n**W-2:** Guys, I think someone's coming.\n\n**W-1:** Remember, we're just here to talk.\n\n**W-3:** Lock it up, they're coming.\n\n//A janitor appears around the corner, he turns on the light to the breakroom and immediately spots all four members of JTF Whiskey-12.//\n\n**UNKNOWN:** H-hey guys. Is there some kind of training going on?\n\n**W-2:** Uh, yes. In fact, we're doing a surprise penetration test of this facility. We actually need to talk to the Director immediately, to discuss the uh...results.\n\n//The janitor stands motionless for a second, staring at the group. He appears to try to speak several times but fails to do so.//\n\n**W-1:** Don't worry, you're not in trouble. We need you to bring us to the Director's office. We can show you our clearance cards.\n\n**UNKOWN:** Uh, yeah. Sure, show me your cards and I'll bring you. I'm not in trouble, right?\n\n**W-1:** No, the only ones in trouble are internal security and the Director.\n\n//W-1, -2, -3, and -4 show the janitor their cards.

I have a new anomaly to bring to your attention.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** And who are you?\n\n**W-4:** Dr. McMarren. I'm new here, so I'm sure you haven't memorized my face yet.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Very well, and what is this anomaly you want to bring to my attention?\n\n**W-4:** A human female, capable of creating Extrauniversal Selective Ways on mirrors. Ways created transport subjects to and from this universe and mine.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Extrauniversal Selective Ways? I've never hea-wait did you just say \"to and from this universe and //mine//\"?\n\n**W-4:** Yes, I am here as a liaison of the Foundation in my universe. We want to cooperate to better utilize this anomaly.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Utilize the anomaly? What is the Foundation's goal in your universe?\n\n**W-4:** To preserve Normalcy, as defined by a consensus formed by the O5 Council and JCS.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** JCS? Is your Foundation run by the United States military?\n\n**W-4:** It's managed by the United States government, but I assure you we are only better than before.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Before?\n\n**W-4:** Before the war. 1967, the Soviets declared war by destroying the East Coast, and the Foundation caused the nuclear defense program to stop working. It was a huge conflict, the veil is barely intact. After the war, the US had no choice but the take more firm control of the Foundation.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** And this female, why can she make these ways?\n\n**W-4:** We don't know, but that's not the point. I have documents for your eyes only, I was told they were the plans for our cooperation.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Ok, let's look those over. \n\n//Director Scout-2 reads over the document for a few moments.//\n\n**W-4:** Everything looks good?\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Not entirely, but I'm sure you would be willing to change some things around. Now about that anomaly, the girl. Has anyone run more in-depth tests since these documents were made?\n\n**W-4:** I'm not sure and like I said, it's not the point. All we need her for is to open a way from our world to yours, so we can work with you. It sounds like you don't want to cooperate.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** I never said that. It just seems like we have different goals. From what I'm gathering, all you want is the Foundation's help, which I understand, but it appears that in this frenzy to reach us you have neglected to further research SCP-7035.\n\n**W-4:** You're cooperation is all that matters.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** I'll maintain communications with you, and I'd imagine the O5 will consider exchanging mutually beneficial information, to learn from each other, and I imagine we will help you in your goal to restore the damage done by containment breaches in your world. However, I can't promise it will be to such a scale as in these plans. \n\n**W-4:** Any assistance is worthwhile. Is there anything else you would like to ask me?\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Yes, is that the entire plan?\n\n**W-4:** I have not been briefed on the specifics, so I do not know.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** That will be all then. I will need to enact containment protocols on you and your way here. \n\n**W-4:** Understandable. Oh! And one thing before I leave. Do not move the mirror in that break room. If you do our way here will not work, and we will be forced to find another one.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Understood.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statements:** All members of JTF Whiskey-12 were taken into quarantine by SCP-7035-2's Foundation following a similar protocol to the baseline Foundation. As such, no counter-measures were taken to retrieve the members early and after forty-eight hours JTF Whiskey-12 returned to the baseline universe through SCP-7035-A.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum September/1976:**\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Interview|09/10/1976\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7035\n\n**Interviewer:** Field Agent Burke\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a transcript of a conversation between SCP-7035 and Field Agent Burke.

Why are you here though, I didn't think I had an interview today.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I just wanted to talk. \n\n**SCP-7035:** Oh, ok. What do yo...\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** It's funny, you're the closest I have to a friend. No one here takes me seriously.\n\n**SCP-7035:** I'm close to a friend?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** No! I mean yes. I...I meant you are my only friend here. I just can't be saying that out loud.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Ah, you can't say you're my friend but you can just walk in and talk to me, unscheduled? Kinda weird. I...\n\n//SCP-7035 starts to speak but is interrupted by Field Agent Burke.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Alice. Those tests, what did they make you do?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Oh! I wanted to talk to you about that. They tested my ability to open portals to my world, they called it a \"way\" for some reason. I still couldn't pass through though, but they said they will still help me.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Alice, did they send people into your portal?\n\n**SCP-7035:** Yeah, did you read the test results?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I wasn't authorized to but that's not the point. Alice, I've only worked with the Foundation for a few years, but once I was assigned to them back in 73' I saw what they did to anomalies, sentient ones. Your own documentation refers to you as //it//.\n\n**SCP-7035:** What did they do?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Destroyed them. Thousands, and to be honest I thought it was a good thing. The Foundation had done terrible things and I saw what the United States was doing to it as a victory, especially after the coast. I really hated the Foundation.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Why are you telling me this?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Look, Alice, I'm not trying to scare you. I...\n\n//Field Agent Burke stops as he notices SCP-7035 appears distressed.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Alice. They won't hurt you, that's why I'm here. Why I bring all of this up is I might be one of the few people here that has a problem with what they have planned for you.\n\n**SCP-7035:** What they have planned for me?!\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I...They are going to enter your world, steal anomalies, and leave. To make sure they are safe, they're going to force you to close the portal and place you in a coma, indefinitely.\n\n**SCP-7035:** They're going to kill me.\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Alice, they aren't going to carry out this plan for a while, we have time. I've been talking to Dr. Scout, he is the director here and he has a plan to save you.\n\n**SCP-7035:** If he's in charge then why doesn't he just not kill me?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** He's not the one in charge, Pentagram is. You need to remember that when I tell you the plan. The Foundation here is not what it used to be, it's a shell of its former self.\n\n**SCP-7035:** Ok, but what's the plan?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** We can't discuss that here, they're listening.\n\n**SCP-7035:** They are?!\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Yes, we need to go now.

He's an asshole.\n\n**Director Scout-2:** Is that what you wanted to tell me? That you don't like one of your co-workers?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** No. I have documents for you, I'm whistleblowing. These are the real plans.\n\n//Field Agent Burke hands Director Scout-2 a copy of the undoctored plans.//\n\n**Director Scout:** This is...absurd, but these signatures match the plans I was given. Thank you for this, but can I ask why?\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** To be honest I couldn't care less about the Foundation. I lost most everything I cared about when the Soviets nuked New York, killing everyone I have ever known. I blamed the Foundation for a long time. Thought it was their fault. \n\n//Field Agent Burke pauses for a moment before continuing.//\n\n**Field Agent Burke:** I only recently realized now that the Foundation prevented more deaths from nukes. Stopping it on the East Coast, as that was as fast as they could do it. No soviet family had to experience what I went through, at least they shouldn't have but we invaded, killing millions anyways.\n\n**Director Scout:** I'm sorry, but that still doesn't explain why you told me this information. \n\n**Field Agent Burke:** Once they get what they want from your world they're going to kill SCP-7035, closing her portal and preventing you guys from entering our world. She's all I have left.\n\n**Director Scout:** I see. She can't enter her own ways, and once we would launch any counter-attack they'd probably just kill her anyways.

Containment efforts began immediately, however, personnel responding failed to effectively fight the plant growth originating from Nx-84, of which the original entrance was unable to be accessed by October 11th due to anomalously large and dense plant growth. By October 20th the area formerly comprising Boston was overgrown, and growths began to resemble structures or varying forms and colors, frequently featuring bright and varied colors.\n\nBy November 1st, significant United States military presence was called in as Nx-84 had expanded to the size of Massachusetts. Due to strict media control in place due to SCP-7993, public knowledge of this event was largely unknown. The areas closest to Nx-84, primarily Boston, now closely resembled a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/city-of-wonder city-sized theme park of varying bright colors]. As the growth of Nx-84 did not slow down, the O5 Council declared an RK-Class Restructuring Scenario, and in accordance with this declaration, the veil was lifted announcing the Foundation's presence in the world.\n\nOn December 24th, 1976 Nx-84 stopped expanding, having covered the states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, and Large portions of Maine, New York, and Pennsylvania. The resulting area was reclassified as Nx-84, and exploration was chosen over destruction, as it was detected a large number of humanoid entities resided in Nx-84. \n\nThe following is the only exploration log of Nx-84.

You report this information to your bosses. \n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n> //Following this, as well as private transmissions to the O5 Council and PJCS from NX-84, the Foundation, PENTAGRAM, and UIU have been prohibited from operating in Nx-84.//\n\n**Addendum January/1978:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Nx-84 \"Wonder World\" Dossier|01/01/1978\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Nexus #:** Nx-84\n\n**Foundation Designation:** Wonder World\n\n**Population:** Estimated to be between 100,000 to 150,000.\n\n**Area Class:** Open Free Port[[footnote]] Nx-84 functions as a Free Port, but can be entered through non-anomalous means.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Nexus Interaction Protocol:** Personnel are prohibited from openly operating in Nx-84, in accordance with the 1977 Anomalous Protection Act[[footnote]] An agreement between PENTAGRAM and thirty known GOIs that prohibits any actions taken against Nx-84.[[/footnote]].\n\n**Containment Facility:** Site-43\n\n**Description:** Wonder World is located on the East Coast of the United States of America, in a territory formerly comprising the US states of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Delaware, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, and large portions of Maine, New York, and Pennsylvania.\n\nPrior to October 10th, 1976, Wonder World was a single city that maintained, various industrial parks, research facilities, housing developments, schools, a university, and the headquarters of GOI-386 that was located solely in a spatial anomaly, which itself was located in the former Boston, MA, USA.\n\nThe investigation into the culture of Nx-84, as well as testimonies by SCP-7035 prior to its relocation to Nx-84, have revealed the population of Nx-84 follows a similar calendar to the Baseline world, sharing a majority of holidays and uses a Gregorian-like system to measure years. However, the population of Nx-84 observes \"Wonder Years\", starting with the founding of the Dr. Wondertainment Company, in 1909.\n\nThe goal of Nx-84 is allegedly referred to as \"Wondermaking\", the idea that life's purpose is to make the world a more wonderful place. The exact meaning of this idea appears to have been decided on a case-by-case basis by each citizen of Nx-84. Another current goal of Nx-84 appears to be to manifest itself in more territory, with the theorized goal of overtaking the United States.\n\nNx-84 has political ties with several known Groups of Interest, most notably the Global Occult Coalition, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., Manna Charitable Foundation, Prometheus Labs, Inc., and The Serpent's Hand. All of which were signing members of the 1977 Anomalous Protection act.\n\n**Addendum:** //Nx-84 is the largest threat to the United States on American soil, however, PENTAGRAM and the Foundation can't act without starting a war with the entire anomalous world, which is rallying around Nx-84 as some common ground. Nx-84 is a ticking time bomb that we are unable to defuse without sparking a chain reaction, removing what little normalcy we have left. We will overcome this obstacle.// - Adm. T. H. Moorer, Chairman of PENTAGRAM.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7034]]] | SCP-7035 | [[[SCP-7036]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
