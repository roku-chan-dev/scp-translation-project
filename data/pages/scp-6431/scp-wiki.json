No persons, civilian or otherwise, are to enter SCP-6431. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6431 is an extradimensional space located underneath the Morning Call Cafe in New Orleans, Louisiana. \n\nSCP-6431 is accessed through a sinkhole in the back room of the cafe. Radar scans have revealed the space to be predominantly empty with only infrequent, unidentified movements detected within.\n\n**Exploration Log 6431-01:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Exploration Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Exploration Team:** Mobile Task Force Rho-23 (\"Vinyl Scratchers\")\n\n**Subject:** SCP-6431\n\n**Team Lead:** Provisional Captain P23-02 - Granite\n\n**Team Members:** P23-03 - Basalt, P23-04 - Pumice, P23-05 - Slate\n\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Granite:** Mic check.\n\n**Basalt:** Check.\n\n**Pumice:** Check.\n\n**Slate:** Check.\n\n**Granite:** Alright, proceed.\n\n//The team descends into SCP-6431.//\n\n//Houses with varying architecture span throughout SCP-6431. The space appears open. A sunrise is visible, giving SCP-6431 a red tint.//\n\n//Pieces of trash are scattered across the ground. Multiple roads fork off from the entry point, and pieces of furniture sit on the sidewalks.//\n\n**Pumice:** The fuck? Why's it so red in here?\n\n**Slate:** I don't think we're inside.\n\n//Slate gestures upwards.//\n\n**Basalt:** Weird-ass neighborhood.\n\n**Slate:** No kidding. What's with the furniture everywhere?\n\n**Basalt:** The furniture? What about the houses?\n\n**Granite:** I mean, it's a space under New Orleans. Isn't that already weird?\n\n**Pumice:** Why's that weird?\n\n**Granite:** You really don't know?\n\n**Pumice:** Oh, right, water...\n\n//A slight breeze pushes a cup across the street.//\n\n**Granite:** Let's get going.\n\n//The team proceeds along the left road for approximately 21 minutes. Various houses of no discernible pattern line both sides. The road branches after every 4-8 houses.//\n\n//The sound of a closing door is heard, causing Basalt, Pumice, and Slate to stop. Several vaguely humanoid figures briefly appear in the windows of the surrounding houses.//\n\n//Slate looks around.//\n\n**Slate:** Where'd that come from?\n\n**Pumice:** I don't think we're alone.\n\n**Basalt:** Let's investigate. What do you say, Granite?\n\n**Basalt:** Granite?\n\n**Pumice:** Shit, he's still moving.\n\n//Basalt, Slate, and Pumice run to catch up with Granite.//\n\n**Basalt:** You good?\n\n//A pause.//\n\n**Basalt:** Granite, are you alright?\n\n**Granite:** Oh, yeah, I'm fine.\n\n**Basalt:** And you'll tell us if something's wrong.\n\n**Granite:** Mhm...\n\n//The team continues walking for ten minutes. Granite turns on multiple roads before stopping. and turning around.//\n\n**Granite:** Hey, why do you guys keep following me?\n\n**Pumice:** You're the team leader.\n\n**Granite:** What're you talking about? Team?\n\n**Pumice:** Y'know, the exploration?\n\n**Granite:** Just- stay away. Stop following me.\n\n**Slate:** You-\n\n**Granite:** Go!\n\n//Basalt looks around.//\n\n**Slate:** What do we do now?\n\n**Basalt:** Let's go... right.\n\n//The team, with the exception of Granite, turns to the right and continues walking.//\n\n**Slate:** We're not seriously gonna leave him, are we?\n\n**Basalt:** No. We'll turn on the next block. \n\n//The team takes the next turn and walks for six minutes.//\n\n//Basalt holds her head.//\n\n**Slate:** You okay?\n\n**Basalt:** Yeah, just kinda dizzy...\n\n**Slate:** Why don't we take a break?\n\n**Basalt:** No, we're almost there.\n\n**Slate:** You heard from Granite?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Slate:** Basalt, did you hear from Granite?\n\n**Pumice:** I don't think that's it.\n\n**Slate:** No shit, Sherlock.\n\n**Pumice:** No, I mean-\n\n//An unidentified female voice cuts in.//\n\n**Female:** Where have you been? I told you to be back before dinner.\n\n**Granite:** I was out with some friends.\n\n**Slate:** The fuck?\n\n**Female:** I was worried about you.\n\n**Granite:** Sorry, Mom.\n\n**Pumice:** Granite, you okay there?\n\n**Female:** Come on, let's get you cleaned up.\n\n**Pumice:** Granite, come in.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Slate:** Granite?\n\n**Pumice:** We lost him.\n\n//A pause.//\n\n**Slate:** Basalt, where are you taking us?\n\n//A pause.//\n\n**Slate:** Basalt, where are you going?\n\n**Pumice:** Let's just follow her.\n\n//The team continues walking for five minutes before Basalt stops and stares up at a house.//\n\n**Slate:** I... I don't like this.\n\n//A vaguely humanoid figure briefly appears in a window before moving out of sight.//\n\n**Pumice:** Did you see that?\n\n//Basalt begins to walk towards the house.//\n\n**Pumice:** Oh, no, you don't!\n\n//Pumice forces Basalt to the ground.//\n\n**Pumice:** What's gotten into you?\n\n**Basalt:** Who- who are you? What do you want?\n\n**Pumice:** Basalt?\n\n//Pumice's hands begin to sink through Basalt.//\n\n//Basalt stands up, leaving Pumice on the ground.//\n\n**Slate:** Oh god.\n\n//Basalt tilts her head slightly before removing her headset.//\n\n//She opens the door and walks inside.//\n\n**Pumice:** Shit.\n\n**Slate:** What now?\n\n**Pumice:** Head back before it happens to us.\n\n**Slate:** I... guess.\n\n//Pumice turns.//\n\n**Slate:** They're gone, aren't they?\n\n**Pumice:** Probably.\n\n//Pumice and Slate walk silently for ten minutes.//\n\n**Pumice:** Hey, Slate?\n\n**Slate:** Hm?\n\n**Pumice:** What was your family like?\n\n**Slate:** Why do you ask?\n\n**Pumice:** I think... I understand now.\n\n**Slate:** Understand what? What're you talking about?\n\n**Pumice:** I just wanna know.\n\n//A pause.//\n\n**Slate:** I didn't have one.\n\n**Pumice:** Well, you're lucky, I guess.\n\n**Slate:** Lucky? How is that lucky?\n\n**Pumice:** You'll understand eventually.\n\n**Pumice:** I think I'm gonna go home now.\n\n**Slate:** You're not making any sense.\n\n//Pumice turns to the left. Slate follows.//\n\n**Slate:** Pumice, where are you going? This isn't the right way.\n\n**Pumice:** I told you: I'm going home.\n\n//Slate grabs Pumice's wrist and attempts to pull him in the opposite direction. He continues walking, pulling Slate along slowly.//\n\n**Slate:** You're coming back with me. Come on!\n\n**Pumice:** It'll be over soon.\n\n**Slate:** Yeah, because we're going back up! Snap out of it already!\n\n//Pumice's wrist passes through Slate's hands, causing her to stumble.//\n\n**Pumice:** You need to leave.\n\n**Slate:** I'm not gonna lose you, too!\n\n**Pumice:** You've already...\n\n//Pumice stops and walks into a house. Slate follows him inside.//\n\n//The camera feed cuts out.//\n\n//Two unidentified voices begin to speak.//\n\n//Slate breathes heavily.//\n\n**Child A:** Nate! You're back!\n\n**Pumice:** Hey, Syd.\n\n**Slate:** Pumice, whatever that thing is...\n\n**Child B:** Look, look, my tooth fell out!\n\n**Pumice:** Don't forget to put that under your pillow.\n\n**Slate:** Get- get away from it!\n\n//Slate screams.//\n\n//The camera feed begins again, showing Slate running from the house. She continues running towards the entry point for 32 minutes.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Concluding Statement:** Slate was successfully extracted following the mission; however, she refused to speak about the events that occurred inside the house. Of note, the sun did not move from its initial position during the exploration.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6430]]] | SCP-6431 | [[[SCP-6432]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
