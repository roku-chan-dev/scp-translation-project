Since then, it has evolved to fit some very key concepts:\n\n* Wondertainment is a capitalist construct.\n* Wondertainment makes children's toys.\n* Wondertainment is childish and playful.\n* Whether or not the previous bullet point is a façade is up for debate.\n\nDr. Wondertainment may be a company, it may be an individual, it may be an individual that runs a company. Most important, however, is that Dr. Wondertainment is magical, and they make toys. Whether they be toys that aren't exactly safe or toys that are beyond anything a kid could ever imagine (or want), the very basics of Wondertainment is that they make toys. Interpretations range from [[[SCP-3301|being warm-hearted and kind]]] to either [[[SCP-1799|straight up terrible]]] or [[[SCP-958|more than a little misguided]]]. However their intentions / grasp on the world is perceived, they are inarguably tied to children and child-like behaviors.\n\nSo, how does one write Dr. Wondertainment? Well, trust me, I know this is going to sound stupid, but... have fun with it. Yes, you should have fun writing anything, because then what's the point? Specifically with Wondertainment though, I believe that the primary way to write it well is to not worry about logic. If you're going to write a Wondertainment toy, it has to be fuckin' //fun//. Make your reader //want// that toy. If you're going to write a tale, make it over the top. Put a [[[Assistance for the Boss Lady|shit ton of corgis]]] in it. Make there be a [[[We Just Make Toys|dictator that rules over candy]]]. Even when it gets dark, [[[Tales of Mr. Collector|hide it behind a veneer of fun]]].\n\nWhen whimsy goes wrong, it's still whimsy. And Dr. Wondertainment is 100% whimsy, to its core. That's what Wondertainment is all about. If you're an aspiring Dr. Wondertainment writer, your main job is to //go nuts, kid//.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Dr. Wondertainment CSS Theme [+]\" hide=\"[-] Hide CSS Theme [-]\"]]\nTo use the Dr. Wondertainment CSS theme, copy the following into the top of your article:\n\n@@[[include theme:wondertainment]]@@\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-Fairy Tales-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"dr-wondertainment +tale -hub\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-Social Work-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"dr-wondertainment +goi-format\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-Chapter Books-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"dr-wondertainment +_tale-hub\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-Toys-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"dr-wondertainment +scp\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Title||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-International Imports-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n||~ Title||~ Author||~ Translator||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/a-big-monster Big Monsters] || [[*user DrSSS]] || [[*user Bonneneige]] ||\n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-003-int SCP-003-INT] |||| [[*user Einer von Rabe]] and [[*user Dr Lekter]] || \n|| [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-014-vn SCP-014-VN] || [[*user KirQ]] and [[*user StupifPotato]] || [[*user Irina Bougainvillea]] ||\n\n------\n[[div id=\"myDiv\" style=\"background-color: #780d8e; text-color: #FBD926;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[SIZE 120%]]##FBD926|**-Other Things-**##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[module ListPages order=\"title\" tags=\"dr-wondertainment -goi-format -tale -scp -_tale-hub\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"200\" prependLine=\"||~ Story||~ Author||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%created_by_linked%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=DarkStuff, taylor_itkin]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** tannerbanner\n> **Name:** tannerbanner\n> **Author:**  [[*user taylor_itkin]] and [[*user Zhange]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dr-wondertainment-hub\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
