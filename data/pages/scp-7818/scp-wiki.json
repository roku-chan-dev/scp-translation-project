Read with caution.  \n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B are to be stored in a standard anomalous item storage locker at Site-81. Physical interaction with either instance by research staff who are involved in romantic affairs, or who have previously been involved in romantic affairs that have ended within thirty days prior to experimentation, is strictly prohibited. Further containment procedures have been deemed unnecessary at this time.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=locket\n| caption=Photograph of SCP-7818-A\n| align=right]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7818 is the collective designation for two identical antique lockets composed of silver, further categorized as SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B. Each locket is embossed with an intricate design depicting interwoven vines and flowers in 14^^th^^ century European Gothic-era patterns. The lockets are heart-shaped and there is a small pocket within each intended to hold photographs.\n\nWhen SCP-7818 is worn by an individual who shares a deep[[footnote]] Referring to a profound and intense emotional bond between individuals involved in a romantic relationship. It implies a heightened level of intimacy, understanding, and affection, wherein the individuals feel a strong sense of connection, empathy, and mutual vulnerability and encompasses a profound emotional and psychological resonance between the partners involved.[[/footnote]] romantic connection with another individual who is wearing SCP-7818-B, SCP-7818’s anomalous effect manifests. \n\nSCP-7818 drastically enhances the physical and mental affection, intimacy, and emotional resonance between the individuals under its anomalous effect, causing an intensified romantic experience between them. Wearing SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B for an extended period of time will invariably cause one of the affected[[footnote]]Henceforth referred to as SCP-7818-1[[/footnote]] to slowly dissipate from baseline reality and conceptual spacetime. \n\nThe intensity of this effect and the rate of dissipation is directly correlated to the emotional strength of the established bond between wearers; the stronger the emotional connection, the faster the dissipation. Initially, subtle signs of the erasure event manifest, such as affected individuals disappearing from photographs, before more notable effects manifest such as the individual's parents forgetting they concieved the affected.\n\nThe only aspect of the lost individual that remains unaffected by SCP-7818 is the content SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B. It is unclear why the content of SCP-7818-A or SCP-7818-B remain unaffected by SCP-7818. It is unclear what happens to individuals who are removed from baseline reality by SCP-7818. Efforts to locate these individuals have remained inconclusive.\n\nCurrently, the photograph contained within both SCP-7818-A and SCP-7818-B depicts Researcher Katherine Varga holding a female woman in a loving embrace. The identity of the second woman cannot be discerned, and Researcher Varga has no recollection of meeting or conversing with the woman in the photograph. \n\n-----\n\nThe following was recovered from Katherine Varga’s apartment on May \n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nDear ##transparent|ㅤㅤaㅤㅤ ㅤoㅤㅤㅤ##,\n@@ @@\nSince it’s our anniversary I figured I would get us something nice. You always said we should get matching lockets, so I thought this would be the perfect gift! I love you so much, so I figured the engraving on it was more than accurate. I already put the pictures in. \n\n@@ @@\n\nAnyway, I’m really sorry I couldn’t give this to you in person. You know how work can be, especially when you get called in and can’t say no. But when I get back, you better believe I’ll make the best dinner for you ever. No spoilers, but you will absolutely die for it. \n\n@@ @@\n[[>]]\nBack soon,\nKatherine Varga.\n[[/>]]\n\n(P.S.

They don't remember me ever having a partner, much less one that worked for the foundation, and the people who knew I had filed the document said they hadn't ever read it. I really had to fight for them to take me seriously. They're suggesting that she never existed, that I made her up in my mind, via anomalous means or otherwise, but that cannot be true. This document is the only proof of her so I need to maintain it to the best of my ability. I've dedicated my life to her, she dedicated her life to me, I promised I would always be by her side, that I would always be there for her, and that I wouldn't forget.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 03:** It’s just now I was looking at the file, and all mentions of her name had disappeared and I had to replace them like I had before. That's when I realized, I had forgotten her name. I don't remember any party. What party? What is happening!? This cannot be happening. I'm trying everything I can, I'm her last hope. I promised I would fix this, she means everything. I can't forget there has to be something I can do. I can fix this, I can do this. I will get her back.\n\n------\n\n**Addendum 03:** My locket still has her picture in it. Those stupid lockets we got like a month ago symbolize our love. Hers, the ones with my picture in it, are gone. Every other picture of her disappeared without a trace, but the other side with her picture on it is in my hand right now. I already updated the file to reflect this. This is huge, I finally have a lead. This could be it. This could be why my darling is gone. What...whatever her name was. Please please don't let me forget now. There's no one else, everyone has forgotten, I am so close, I can't give up now, I can't forget. I promised.\n\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Video Log Transcript**\n\n**Date and Time:** 2023-05-20T09:45:00-06:00\n\n**Subjects**: Katherine Varga.\n\n**Foreword** //The following transcript is an amendment to 7818.
