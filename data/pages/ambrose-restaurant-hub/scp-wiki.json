That doesn't mean you shouldn't try to explore serious themes, far from it, just remember that Ambrose is far away from the doom and gloom of other parts of the Foundationverse.\n\nOne thing you should be keeping in mind with Ambrose is that they are, at the end of the day, a restaurant. Focus on the people, but also focus on the food. Don't ever make it seem like a place that a customer wouldn't want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal in. Unless you're re-imagining it, of course.\n\nWhen it comes to setting, the Ambrose Restaurant is far behind the veil, steeped up to the eyeballs in the anomalous. They're frequent collaborators with other anomalous groups of interest, and are always looking for new and stranger ways of making a meal of it. As for the timeline, there's currently no fixed dates, however, we know that they formed as a group some time in the last decade or so. From there, they set up with suppliers, and operated normally until the Foundation discovered them during the events of Dining Out, and began to track and isolate their baseline reality establishments.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Franchising Options\" hide=\"- Writing your own Format\"]]\n@@@@\n[[span style=\"color: #A38800; font-size: 4em; font-weight: bold; font-family: 'Poiret One', cursive; word-break: normal;\"]]\n= How to Write an Ambrose Format[[/span]]\n\nUnfortunately, the Ambrose Format does not have an easy copyable template. The reason for this is simple: no two menus are going to look aesthetically the same, depending on the type of food served and the price range of the establishment. The menu should fit the restaurant, and every Ambrose Restaraunt is different.\n\nThe format consists of two parts: the menu and the reviews.\n\nThe menu is where you put all of the good items. These should be varied, without too much repetition or similarity between items. A general rule of thumb is that there are three possible reasons a dish is anomalous: ingredients, preparation, or effect. A dish might be made from a dragon, it might do something special when served, or finally, give the user some benefit. Generally, a single restaurant will stick to one of these - but feel free to mix!\n\nWhen making a menu div, keep this in mind: Try to select colors that work together and seem accurate for the restaurant in question. Look up menus to get a good idea of what it'll look like. Check fonts - it's always good to have one in your menu. Prices can be included, optionally. Don't just copy the CSS of another menu - look at real world menus and create your own visual appearance to match!\n\nFor the reviews, you can copy the framing device that sets them up from another format. The first three Ambrose Formats all had different review formats, so you can take one of those or make your own. It's versatile. This is where you should talk about the food, and give more opinions and description of it. You're rather limited in the menu, but you had a lot more freedom say whatever you want in the reviews.\n\nBroadly speaking, an Ambrose Format is going to describe food from two perspectives: the first is trying to sell you on the food, and make it seem as appealing as possible. The second is a more realistic perspective, talking about reactions to the food. The contrast between these two perspectives is vital to the format.\n\nGenerally speaking, reviews are going to be the easier place to convey the narrative of the work - it's possible to do it in the menu, but the nature of that makes it more of a list of interesting items, with what really makes the piece work coming in to play in the reviews. Do not treat the reviews as an afterthought: they are the primary focus of the work.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:85%; padding-top: 1em; padding-right: 1em; padding-left: 2em; padding-bottom: 1em; margin-bottom: 3em;\"]]\n+ λ-14 DEBRIEFING DOCUMENTS\n\n**__PRIORITY TARGET:__**\n**GOI-116: Ambrose Restaurants**\n**STATUS:** [[span style=\"color:green\"]]●[[/span]] ACTIVE [[span style=\"color:green\"]]●[[/span]]\n**THREAT LEVEL:** [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]●[[/span]] YELLOW [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]●[[/span]]  (NON-HOSTILE, NORMALCY THREATENING)\n[[=image Bs0O0C1%20-%20Imgur.png width=\"150px\" ]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nMobile Task Force [[[task-forces#lambda-14|Lambda-14 (\"One Star Reviewers\")]]] is a task force which specialises in retail-oriented locations and anomalies, be they singular restaurants or entire shopping districts displaying anomalous properties.\n\nSince their initial investigation of an Ambrose restaurant, MTF Lambda-14 has concentrated on dealing with this specific group, in whatever form they might take.\n\nLambda-14 is comprised of two containment teams, fifty mobile agents, ten thaumaturgy specialists, and twenty anomalous art specialists.
