Pishroy to decommission it. SCP-2085 was forcibly introduced into a highly-secure containment chamber with SCP-1915 at Site-01. Within the first few hours, SCP-2085 made several attempts to breach the containment cell, most spearheaded by SCP-2085-A-1, all of which resulted in failure. SCP-1915 does not appear to notice the escape attempts and professionally introduces themself to SCP-2085, before attempting to engage in small talk with them. None of the members of SCP-2085 respond, causing SCP-1915 to repeat his question several times before SCP-2085-A-4 violently lashes out at him in frustration, causing SCP-1915 to step back and apologize. After ~5 hours, SCP-1915’s effects become noticeable on SCP-2085 and appear to intensify: Members of SCP-2085 begin having their cybernetic enhancements gradually deteriorate until disappearing, though this appears to cause no harm to the physiology of the members. In addition, their clothes begin to become more akin to a traditional work dress, with SCP-2085's S1035 ACES being replaced with a collared white shirt and jeans. SCP-2085 becomes less motivated to escape, instead displaying signs of intense fear and dread at their transformations. SCP-2085-A-3 begins screaming to the interior roof camera, viciously insulting the Foundation and demanding for the door to be opened. Onset of mental amnesia occurs after ~7 hours, after all cybernetic enhancements (including SCP-2085-1) have demanifested, when SCP-2085-A-5 displays confusion about their location. Over the course of the next 10 hours, despite numerous attempts by SCP-2085-A to retain them, they gradually lose their memories of any anomalous phenomena, including their crimes, their modifications, each other, and SCP-2085-B, instead having these replaced by typical memories of a non-anomalous human being growing up in Japan. SCP-2085-B is not affected, presumably due to their non-anomalous upbringing, instead reacting with horror at SCP-2085-A’s gradual loss of memory. At ~T=18:00:00, All members of SCP-2085-A are indistinguishable from non-anomalous Japanese civilians, both physically and mentally. SCP-2085-B’s attempts to make SCP-2085-A remember are met with confusion and apathy. SCP-1915 does not appear to notice and engages in small talk with SCP-2085-A, this time without incident. Upon release from the containment area, SCP-2085-B attacked attending researchers, yelling “What did you do to them!?” before being forced to ingest an Amnestic that targeted memories of SCP-2085. After the procedure was done, SCP-1915 also showed no anomalous effects, likely as a counterbalance to SCP-2085.

However, if SCP-204-2 is put into danger, or if SCP-204-2 commands it to, SCP-204-1 will instantaneously materialize into a solid, physical form. All instances of SCP-204-2 are children between the ages of 4-14 and have had a history of abuse and danger, with many developing acute mental disorders as a result. SCP-204-1 will imprint on SCP-204-2 and encourage more aggressive and danger-seeking tendencies with little regard for human life.||Children kidnapped by instances of SCP-1788-1 and subjected to SCP-1788 make prime candidates for becoming instances of SCP-204-2. The instances of SCP-204-2 have been observed to internalize the trauma of the experience and will attempt to hunt and terminate as many instances of SCP-1788-1 as they can. Upon reaching adulthood and turning into an instance of SCP-1788-1, SCP-204-1 will kill its previous host and will seek out another prepubescent victim of SCP-1788 to imprint on and will prioritize repeating this instead of imprinting on children unaffected by SCP-1788. {{-Professor Mint}}||\n||[[[SCP-3501]]] - a coffeehouse in Isfahan, Iran, run by a figure designated SCP-3501-1.

Infected individuals have their tissues and organs gradually converted into an \"organic metal,\" forming complex machinery to replace the original biological function. The infection also greatly diminishes the subject's mental state, making their actions repetive and mechanical. ||Cross-testing of samples of SCP-217 with individuals suffering from late-stage infection of SCP-610 was approved following extensive research by Foundation doctors specializing in anomalous pathology and tactical theology. The test was conducted in an airlocked, sterilized containment chamber and SCP-217 was administered via aerosol. Once the SCP-610 infected subject was exposed to a sample of SCP-217, the subject entered a state of extreme distress. SCP-217's conversion of biological tissue occurred at a massively accelerated rate, with large portions of the subject's lower abdomen having been completely converted within fifteen minutes of infection. The subject ceaselessly screamed in apparent pain and began clawing at the portions of its body that had been converted, attempting to tear off the metal. Large tumorous growths began to appear under the organic metal, as if pushing it away from the rest of the body, but SCP-217 continued to convert the tissue. This continued for over two hours before the subject's body violently ruptured, terminating the subject and repelling the organic metal away from the body. Post-analysis of the corpse found no traces of either SCP-610 or SCP-217. The organic metal had autonomously reconstructed itself into a dimensionally perfect cube and no longer became a vector for the spread of SCP-217. Occasionally, sounds resembling growls and gargling can be heard inside the cube. Repeated tests unanimously resulted in similar results.  Following O5 approval, SCP-217 was unleashed upon the SCP-610 quarantine zone and protocols were instituted to ensure complete isolation. After one month of exposure, the zone was inspected by drone and found to be completely vacant of all life.

The rapid and continous creation and extinction of new genomes has prevented SCP-6002-B from spreading further across SCP-6002. {{- Dr. Zero}}||\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[!-- CSS for mobile layout below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere it is! --]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n@supports (display: grid) {\n@media only screen and (max-width: 767px) {\n    #page-content table tr {\n        display: grid;\n        grid-template-areas:\n            \"one two\"\n            \"result result\";\n        grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr ;\n        margin-bottom: 1rem;\n    }\n\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1) { grid-area: one; }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) { grid-area: two; }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3) { grid-area: result; }\n\n    #page-content table tr > td {\n        padding: 0.75em;\n        font-size: 1.05em;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr:first-child { display: none; }\n\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1),\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) {\n        border-bottom-width: 0;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2) {\n        border-left-width: 0;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(1)::before,\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(2)::before {\n        display: flex;\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n        width: 100%;\n\n        content: \"SCP描述\";\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-size: 85%;\n        background-color: #EEEEEE;\n\n        padding: 0.75em;\n        margin-bottom: 0.35rem;\n    }\n\n   #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3) {\n        position: relative;\n        padding-left: 7.35rem;\n        min-height: 3rem;\n    }\n    #page-content table tr > *:nth-child(3)::before {\n        display: flex;\n        position: absolute;\n        left: 0.75em;\n        box-sizing: border-box;\n\n        content: \"收容方式\";\n        align-items: center;\n        justify-content: center;\n        text-align: center;\n        font-weight: bold;\n        font-size: 85%;\n        background-color: #EEEEEE;\n\n        width: 6rem;\n        height: calc(100% - 1.75em);\n        padding: 0.5em;\n    }\n}\n}\n[[/module]]",
