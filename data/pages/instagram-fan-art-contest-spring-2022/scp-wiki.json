  "content": "[[include :scp-wiki:theme:black-highlighter-theme]]\n\n\n[[image http://smlt.wikidot.com/local--files/collab:drakimoto:art-stuff/banner4 style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n\nThe SCP Foundation Wiki is known for the awesome stories, characters, and SCPs created by our wonderful authors. A more overlooked aspect of this community is the tons of fantastic artists that bring these creations to life. This contest is meant to promote these artists and give them a fun way to share their creations with the community.\n\n+++++ Theme:\n\n+++++ __Design a Foundation Researcher__: Make your own original character that works at one of the many Foundation facilities across the world. \n\nEver wanted to make an original character that fits into the SCP Universe and works at the Foundation, but never knew where to start? Here's your chance to make someone cool! Pick a workplace from the [[[secure-facilities-locations | Foundation Facilities]]] map or the [[[facilities-complete-list | Semi-Comprehensive List of Foundation Facilities]]] and make an original character researcher that works there. \n\nConsider the theme of the site and make a researcher that suits that location - a wildlife biologist would want to work at Site-18, for example, not Site-15. As long as the character is a researcher of some sort and fits the theme of site, all the other details are up to you! \n\n------\n++++ Winners:\n[[=image insta_winners.jpg]]\nHere are both our community voted winners, and our mods' choice bonus winners.
