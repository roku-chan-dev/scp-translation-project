The Engineering and Technical Service Department is constructing 30 new high-capacity, multipurpose facilities in areas of high elevation with low-risk of climate related disasters. \n\nThe Department of Ecological Sciences is documenting anomalous \"tipping points\" attributing to ecological destabilization; current estimates account for 18%-26% of all ecological contaminants.

A subcommittee drawn from all three attending groups was established in order to facilitate the creation of specific policy proposals.//\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**O5-01:** All right. Our mandate is to establish some sort of compromise by which we can move forward with some sort of unified policy proposal we can give to our respective departments. We need to move forward on this, but we cannot do so if we're constantly at loggerheads about the very origin of this catastrophe. \n\n**Dr. Ormulogen:** Why yes, yet another subcommittee, this will clearly work out w-\n\n**O5-01:** Excuse me, Rosalind. If we don't even attempt to work together, then your words become self-fulfilling prophesy. You were included specifically because of your expertise in this area. You can at least give it a try.\n\n**Dr. Ormulogen:** Climate change has been a debate in the energy sector for decades, One. It has been a constant source of irritation for climate scientists, energy companies, and governments. It's not like we're going to come to a consensus in a few hours. \n\n**Dr. Hines:** We're not debating if humans are to blame for climate change, the science on it is incontrovertible. Humans are to blame, it's as simple as that. No, our debate is whether or not we should utilize our vast anomalous resources in order to reverse the damage that-\n\n**Franks, Esq.** Apologies, I don't mean to interrupt, but we can't just do that. I realize that the 04s are here in an advisory capacity, and it is in that role that I'm interjecting. The Charter is pretty clear on the extent to which the Foundation can legally interfere with international sovereignty. It also establishes clear limits on our authority to intervene on a global scale. \n\n**Dr. Ormulogen:** Please. We interfere all the time. Time and again we've literally changed the course of history! We've meddled continuously in the affairs of all world's nations, whether they're signatories of the Charter or not. Don't give me this \"non-interference\" hogwash.\n\n**Franks, Esq.:** We are allowed to interfere when the incident requiring our interference is anomalous in nature. The oncoming ecological disaster isn't anomalous. There is a clear cause-and-effect. \n\n**O5-07:** Is there, though?\n\n**Dr. Francois:** Site-12 runs the Aureole Orbital Recon Array[[footnote]]See //Project AurORA - Akiva, EVE, and Hume Spectra Analysis From Low-Earth Orbit// 4th ed., 2048 by Dr. Emmanuel Salazar for more details on the array.[[/footnote]], and we've already run intensive scans specifically looking for a \"smoking gun\". While the Array has only been online since the 1970s, we can run spectra analysis on bore samples dating all the way back to the neolithic. A global ecological disaster such as this would have left rampant evidence throughout the aethersphere. Yeah, there are some anomalous additives, [[[factory-hub | the Factory]]] alone has contributed a great deal to greenhouse gas emissions. Same with [[[dr-wondertainment-hub| Wondertainment]]]. Even so, they have only contributed a small fraction to the overall speed at which the climate has been changing. \n\n**Dr. DeCroix:** Fine. Even so, we have a duty to protect the people of this planet. While I cannot argue that the root cause of climate change is entirely anomalous, we cannot simply ignore that if we don't do something, this planet is going to die.\n\n**Dr. Ormulogen:** Precisely. We can do something, thus we should do something. It's as simple as that.\n\n**Ftr. Oluwafeyisayo:** With all due respect, I don't think it is that simple. We can't just go about changing the fate of the world on a whim. There are religious aspects to all of this that we must consider.\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:**\n\n//The conference continued for five days, with several action plans eventually being consolidated into a series of votes.

This appearance was granted, under the provision that PoI-0007 appear via virtual link from Foundation Site 18 in New York City.//\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**O5-01:** This meeting is now brought to order. Due to the unprecedented appearance of tonight's guest, I am moving that we table all existing business until after Ms. al Fine has had an opportunity to address her concerns.\n\n**O5-07:** I second the motion. Let's hear what the Undersecretary has to say. \n\n//Several moments pass as O5-01 tabulates the vote.//\n\n**O5-01:** All right, motion carries. Ms. al Fine, the floor is yours. \n\n**al Fine:** Thank you. I realize that my intrusion here has been completely unorthodox. While our organizations have a long history of coordinated efforts, I believed that the situation is such that it necessitated my direct intervention. I appreciate the opportunity to do so. \n\n**O5-09:** Yes, yes. Please go on, Undersecretary. We have a lot to discuss tonight, so let's skip the formalities.\n\n**al Fine:** Sure. As I'm sure you are all aware, the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly have each passed several measures granting my office expanded authority to respond to an unspecified impending event of an ecological nature. While both bodies have been exceptionally close-lipped when it comes to specifying the details of such an event, I'm sure you're also aware of what it is. \n\n**O5-12:** NOAA's recent report on the Antarctic. \n\n**al Fine:** Precisely. Despite the coordinated efforts of China, Russia, the EU, and the United States, the climate issue has reached a tipping point. The reality is simply that we can no longer prevent total ecological collapse. Frankly? Too little, too late. It was too politically unpalatable to make such drastic changes to the international economy back when change was possible and at this point, even if we could somehow force every developed nation to completely shut down, it wouldn't be enough.\n\n**O5-09:** We are also aware of this, Undersecretary. I assume that you haven't come here simply with dire portents, so I suggest you get on with it.\n\n**al Fine:** The GOC has had enough, and we intend to do something about it. I want to be very clear here, I am not seeking your permission to do this, we've moved passed that now. We have no other option and I refuse to simply stand by and do nothing.\n\n**O5-09:** Then why are you here? \n\n**al Fine:** I'm here to offer to coordinate GOC efforts with whatever the Foundation is doing. We've worked together in the past, and I'm certain that working together we can solve this. You represent some of the finest minds in the entire world, and I'm offering you the combined resources of the GOC and the entirety of the UN. Let us help.\n\n**O5-09:** I think you are misinformed. While I appreciate this offer of assistance, there is no ongoing Foundation project that matches the assistance you are offering. \n\n**al Fine:** Cut the crap, Nine. You have to be doing something, the situation is worse than it has ever been. I know the Foundation has contingency plans to combat K-class scenarios, so which is this? EK-Class \"Ecological Disaster\"? CCK-Class \"Climate Change Scenario?\" Whatever your fancy acronyms, we want to help. \n\n**O5-09:** Once again, you are misinformed, Ms. al Fine. This is a man-made disaster. As much as I regret the state of the world, the Foundation does not interfere with non-anomalous human activity. Doing so would violate the Charter, and that is simply not going to happen.\n\n**al Fine:** Seriously? The world is dying, Nine, and //now// you decide to follow the fucking rules?\n\n[END LOG]\n----\n**Afterword:**\n//The meeting continued, culminating in another vote on whether or not the Foundation should engage in an effort to prevent further ecological collapse.//\n\n||~ YEA  ||~ NAY  ||~ ABSTAIN ||\n||O5-01 ||O5-02  || ||\n||O5-03 ||O5-04  || ||\n||O5-06 ||O5-05  || ||\n||05-10 ||O5-07  || ||\n||O5-12  ||O5-08  || ||\n|| ||O5-09 || ||\n|| ||O5-11 || ||\n|| ||O5-13  || ||\n[[/div]]\n\nWhile the majority of the O5 Council voted to reject PoI-0007's proposal, elements within the 05 Council decided to act counter to the majority. \n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#c9c9c9; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n**Date:** 17 August, 2100 \n**Memory Source:** O5-12\n**Foreword:** \n//The following took place in PoI-0007's office in New York.//\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**al Fine:** I'm not going to bother to ask how you got in here, Twelve.

We had to strike back, and taking away the Foundation's ace in the hole was the best course.\n\n**O5-12:** No, you don't understand. SCP-2000 isn't- wasn't just the Foundation's \"ace in the hole\". It's the fucking restart button for the entire goddamn planet. We weren't just saving Foundation assets in that facility, but we had records of MOST of the world's greatest minds there.
