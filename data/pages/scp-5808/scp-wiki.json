A monthly medical evaluation is to be performed on SCP-5808-1, followed by an inspection of SCP-5808-2's status. The Foundation's Maximus-507 research satellite is to constantly monitor SCP-5808-2 under the supervision of the Site-51 Astronomical Anomalies Department. Direct testing of SCP-5808 is currently restricted; all tests require direct authorization of Dr. Westbrook and Site-51's director. \n\nIf civilian discoveries occur, Foundation assets in the field of astronomy are to cover and/or discredit all findings relating to SCP-5808.\n\n**Archived Update 2019/05/22:** O5 Command is currently accepting proposals for the neutralization of SCP-5808-2. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\nSCP-5808 is an astronomical phenomenon affecting Peter Westbrook (SCP-5808-1) and a lunar satellite that manifested upon its birth.\n\nSCP-5808-1 was born on 2009/08/25 at exactly 12:13:38 GMT, measuring 48 cm and weighing 4.8 kg. Its mother, Researcher Debra Westbrook, died during childbirth with no cause of death determined. SCP-5808-1 shows no anomalous properties other than its connection to SCP-5808-2.\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=moon.jpg|\n    caption=SCP-5808-2.|\n    width=100px\n]]\nSCP-5808-2 is a lunar satellite that manifested on 2009/08/25 at exactly 12:13:38 GMT, approximately 20,000 km from Earth. At the time of manifestation SCP-5808-2 measured ~4.8 meters in diameter with a similar radiological composition to Earth I. Annually on August 25, SCP-5808-2 undergoes a rapid expansion in size increasing in magnitude with each year. As of 2019/07/30 SCP-5808-2 measures ~170 meters, which is estimated to increase to ~250 meters on 2019/08/25\n\nAny physical damage occurring to SCP-5808-1 or SCP-5808-2 will directly correlate to damage on the other. The exact means by with SCP-5808 operates is currently unknown but is theorized to be some form of anomalous quantum entanglement. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nOn 2009/08/25, Dr. Westbrook (Under Director of Astronomical Anomalies Department) confirmed SCP-5808-2's existence moments after it had manifested, during which time his wife, Researcher Westbrook, was giving birth in the Site-51 Medical Wing. The Statistical Analysis Team flagged the event as a statistical anomaly far beyond the chance of naturally occurring. Site-51 was put into temporary lockdown while the situation was analyzed, and SCP-5808-1 was isolated for observation.\n\nA high-speed analysis drone (507/A) was dispatched from the Maximus-507 research satellite to run preliminary tests on SCP-5808-2. Once in range, 507/A deployed a penetrating laser on SCP-5808-2 in order to perform spectral analysis. At the exact moment of impact, SCP-5808-1 received a 3rd-degree burn on its left forearm, bringing an immediate halt to testing. Over the next several weeks low-risk noninvasive testing revealed the nature of SCP-5808 and the current containment procedures were enacted.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Neutralization Proposal Summaries__**\nDue to its rate of expansion SCP-5808-2 will pose an immediate threat to normalcy. As such, O5 Command has authorized the neutralization of SCP-5808-2, under the condition that SCP-5808-1 is not harmed in the process if possible.\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#FFF8E7; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n= **Astronomical Anomalies Department | SCP-5808 Proposal**\n\nUse of light refracting drone array to camouflage SCP-5808-2 from civilian observation.\n\n**Ethics Committee: ##green|Approved##**\n**O5 Command: ##firebrick|Denied##**\n\n**Reason:** While possible as a temporary solution, the long term feasibility of this proposal is low.

Upon activation of the anomaly, SCP-5808-1 received severe bodily damage with a total of 65 broken bones, internal bleeding, ruptured spleen, and brain damage in a manner typically found in high-speed collisions. SCP-5808-2 was moved approximately 1 km before the test was halted due to injuries sustained by SCP-5808-1. SCP-5808-1 was brought to the Site-51 Medical Wing in terminal condition, though Foundation surgeons were able to stabilize it. Two hours after the initial test Dr. Westbrook demanded all staff leave SCP-5808-1's room before shutting down the security cameras and sealing the room with himself and SCP-5808-1 inside. A monitoring device picked up the following recording:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"● Audio Log ●\" hide=\"○ Audio Log ○\"]]\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[A chair can be heard scraping against the floor, followed by an exaggerated sigh from Dr. Westbrook. The beeping of SCP-5808-1 monitor can be heard.]//\n\n**Westbrook:** Hey kiddo... even after all this you're still holdin' on. \n\n**Westbrook:** Your mother would be so proud of you; you've been so strong these past 10 years.\n\n//[Dr. Westbrook can be heard lighting a cigarette; SCP-5808-1's monitor continues to beep.]//\n\n**Westbrook:** //[Heavy exhale.]// A lot stronger than I've ever been. I should've quit years ago... before you were born, before the promotion, before your moth... I just should've made more time for her, for everything. Maybe things would've turned out differently.\n\n//[SCP-5808-1's monitor continues to beep.]//\n\n**Westbrook:** You've suffered so much, I'm not gonna' let you suffer anymore. \n\n//[Several beeps can be heard from SCP-5808-1's IV regulator; its monitor begins to beep faster as well as its respirator.]//\n\n**Westbrook:** It's almost over ki-kiddo... almo–\n\n//[SCP-5808-1's respirator goes silent as its monitor emits a steady tone. SCP-5808-1's time of death recorded as 13:12:35 GMT. Dr. Westbrook can be heard sobbing.]//\n\n**Westbrook:** I'm so sorry...\n\n//[Dr. Westbrook continues sobbing; SCP-5808-1's monitor continues a steady tone.]//\n\n[END LOG]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAt 13:12:35 GMT, SCP-5808-2 began to steadily increase in size by a rate of .5 meters an hour. Dr. Westbrook isolated himself in his office following the failed neutralization and refused emergency psychological counsel. At 16:30:45 GMT, a security camera registered a single gunshot originating from Dr. Westbrook's office. \n\nSCP-5808-2 instantaneously demanifested at 16:30:45 GMT, effectively neutralizing SCP-5808. This led the Astronomical Anomalies Department to determine Dr. Westbrook to be the unknowing cause of the SCP-5808 phenomenon, prior to self-neutralization. The means by which this occurred is currently being investigated.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5807]]] | SCP-5808 | [[[SCP-5809]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
