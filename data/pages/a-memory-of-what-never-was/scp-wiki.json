Passing the time by looking at the moonless night sky. Seeing the heavenly stars twinkle aimlessly throughout the void above. There’s nothing currently happening on the mortal soil. Nothing unusual to speculate or too unusual to call their unofficial superiors for. \n\nThey hoped this could continue a while longer. Unfortunately that sloth desire dashed the moment they saw a large fellow walk their way. Brandishing a tiresome straight face. Dress in ancient attire, filthy crimson hair that stretched to his knees, branding numerous ancient arcana tattoos. Top by an aura surrounding that scream malice. \n\nCould this be what their superiors warned about? They thought readying their firearms. Only to freeze as the man arms blacken by a metallic coating. Before either knew what was what, said weapons were crushed into a small baseball in this trespasser hands. \n\nYep, he definitely type their superiors warned about. The security guards thought has the stranger causal walk through the doors. Not opening, demolishing the wood barrier as he pressed forward. One to the left became paralyzed by the scene. His mind turn blank at this display of power. Understand he was alive purely out luck and luck alone. The other guard wasn’t has accepting of reality. Placing his hand on the stranger right shoulder. Didn’t have any plan, but a delusional hope he can stop him right there. \n\nOf course, that pipe dream shatter immediately. Not with a blow to the face, merely by a quiet display of power. This warrior grab the guard by his shoulder and lift him a foot in the air, then place back on down. With that, the second officer will was defeated. Mouth tremble random noises. “Wh-Wh-Wh-”\n\n“Thy, 076.” He said has he place a finger to his lips. A quick way to say: be quiet or else. Once the brief threat set in, 076 walked inside the medical facility.\n\nHospital was a cold place, and it grew colder after a few minutes of wandering. The professionalism here a germ worse nightmare. Being the upmost to perfection. Hallways were spotless and cold. Every once thoroughly washed smooth. Walls painted a fresh bright white color. Couple pictures of unknown folks were roughly a meter from each other. \n\nThe whole thing was alien to a warrior like 076. No sound, no filth, or blood. A place to recover far too foreign. He preferred an atmosphere of energetic nihilistic carnage. Not an environment of calm optimistic preservation.\n\n“Stop right there fiend!” A kid proclaimed. It was a little boy with a wooden sword. There serval other brats behind him. Dressed in hospital clothes and sloppy private get-ups. They obviously snuck out their bedrooms to play some stupid game. \n\nThe warrior didn’t have the patience for this shit. Before he even take one step, the kid swarm him like moths to a flame.\n\n“RRR! Put-up your dukes! We the band of crow shall not let you pass! You hear!” Boy shouted out. Trying look menacing as a child could be.\n\n“I think you’re suppose to say ye’ not you. Also you need to say-” One of the smaller girl pest. \n\n“You’re ruining the moment.” Boy said.\n\n“Hey, you wanted us to play privates, remember. You should least do it right!”\n\n“I am. Beside I am the captain. You’re not even my first mate.”\n\n076 didn’t have time for this bantering shit. He just lifted the pretending captain up 7ft high. When he looked at him with the same stern glare, he was flabbergasted. To his surprise there wasn’t fear in the boy, instead joy? Yes, joy with a stupid smile and all. \n\n“WOW, I’M FLYING! CHECK IT OUT I’M FLYING!” The boy cheered. Waving his arms like a bird.\n\n“NO FAIR, DO ME NEXT! IT MY TURN! MY TURN!” A girl ran toward him shouting. \n\nThis seem so strange. The kids lineup to him to be hover across the room. Each one had a simple fly around, then be place on the ground. Some wanted get close to his face to touch his nose. Other wanted to touch the ceiling lights that would flicker. It was so weird to think that where the adults outside wet themselves, the kids merely chuckled. The immoral warrior pondered how much humans could change over a single decade. Where most immortal he faced hardly ever change at all.\n\nStrange.\n\nSo strange.\n\nOnce all the kids had their fun, he ready get on the move. “Waitaminute, where you going mister?” Like before, he was stopped. They’re hundreds of easy way out this situation. Most involve blood, others have these brat screaming. However those methods were for more critical situations. So he decide on the most effective option. Answering the damn question. He did so by showing an image. It was an old photograph, one of a jovial woman holding an old-fashion camera.\n\n“Hey, that woman looks like grandma.” Girl said pointing at the head.\n\n“No way. Grandma hair white, her is purple.” Boy corrected.\n\n“Violet, and hair turn white over time, idiot!”\n\n“You’re the idiot, idiot!”\n\nThis crap lasted a good while. After another pointless insufferable argument, the children lead their new friend to the doors. Where a couple guards and doctors formed a human wall. Stare at him with whatever courage they could muster. Clear alert by the incident outside. \n\n“If you leave the children alone and promise not to hurt anyone, you can step inside.” One requested nervously. Knew full well they hadn’t a chance in hell. nothing in their arsenal stood any hope of stopping a force like 076. \n\nIn a single nod, the security forces ran to retrieve the kids, much to their dismay. They all seem grow fond of the warrior. Although anyone who knew the fellow better had the opposite opinion. Wanting get the hell out of dodge as fast as possible. Meanwhile the man in question walked into the room. Couple other individuals followed. Purely to keep an eyes on him. Very least to ensure everything went somewhat decently.\n\n076 was prepared for anything. A trap, a double-cross, or even an unexpected surprise attack. Those trick were old-hat to someone like him. Unfortunately there one thing he wasn’t steel for, the truth. The moment he stepped inside to see his old acquaintance. His very old acquaintance. The long spiderweb hair woman in bed was 101-years-old. Skin crumbled-up paper dipped in greasy soap. Her bones could be seen as clear as crystal. The withering fingertips held a relic camera in hand. \n\nThis woman was well-known to many. Practically going by hundreds of  names over the course of her life. Some grand, some plain. But on paper she just 105. Her third favorite number.\n\n“Long time, no see jackass? Still the bigger dick I remember. I take it your still fucking every asshole you see?” 105 joke with her only good eye spotting 076. Her voice sounded like a broken steaming tea-pot. \n\nNo words were spoken by 076. Not so much a sound. The warrior has fought countless battles against the noblest of souls. To him dying in the midst of combat was the honorable end. To see someone full of life like 105 in such a state was unthinkable. It force a new sensation in him. A mixture of guilt and sorrow, with a hint of fear? Whatever it was, it left an uneasiness in his chest. \n\n“I see my kids gave you a hard time? Little shits. Love playing games at the worst possible places.”\n\n076 just glared at her in disbelief.\n\n“Okay, my Grandkids.”\n\n076 just continued to stare at her.\n\n“Okay, okay, my GREAT-GREAT-grandkid! Happy now, you immortal dick?”\n\n076 just shrugged.\n\n“Hey, you mind helping me up? I heard the night sky were in for a… What do you calling… comet shooter? No, huh, Asteroid shower? Whatever. I heard it going be a dizzy thing and I be damn if I’m going miss it.” The old friend asked, scratching back of her head. Trying disconnect the various tubes and wires on her person.\n\nThe order was heard, but it didn’t affect much. 076 stood there, still contemplating the revelation before him. \n\n“HEY JACKASS, CAN YOU STOP LOOKING LIKE AN IDIOT AND GIVE ME A LIFT ALREADY?! YEESH!” She prefer go alone, unfortunately both legs have long since gone limp. Arms weren’t far behind either, requiring a lot of effort to get them moving. Moments like these made her regret not getting the metallic limbs. Although 105 far too stubborn to ever take that offer. \n\nIn fact, her stubbornness was what driving her action. The lousy doctors claim she have a few more weeks if she stayed bedridden. That means following all the instructions from top to bottom. Get plenty of colorful medical drugs in the blood. Do a minor surgery or two here and there. Eat plenty of the daily plain shit offered by the staff. Stay cope inside a near empty white room all day long. \n\nNaturally 105 was ready to say fuck that. Prepared to reduce her time to a minutes if it mean getting one last chance to live. (Actually it was going just be a few hours, but who’s really counting?) Wanting to perish with a sense of dignity. Under the night sky if nothing else. Not as lab-rat or with half her body replaced with techno bits. \n\nThe doctors and guards nearby would try to stop. Yet their glances immediately turn to the immortal warrior in the room. Who looked at them like a wild animal. All while causally twisting a metal rode into a poorly done balloon animal. Making it clear how their resistance will be rewarded.\n\nOnce the aforementioned doctors and guards began walking back, 076 took a kick at the wall. Utterly demolished the entire thing unless then a second. All to create a quicker exit. He manage to take out all the windows, curtains, decorations, and whatnot along that side of the hospital.\n\nA minor dust cloud rosed up into the sky. The rumble crash against the ground. This naturally got everyone who didn’t see the action first hand to mistake for an explosion. Screaming and crying were happening left and right. Massive panic like children often do. Authorities called in to settle the manner. News media raced to report the chaos. \n\nAll this occurred as 076 lifted 105 in his arms. This was something the warrior wasn’t used to. Carrying something so fragile felt wrong against his instincts. Still, to abandon his comrades wishes seemed worse. Two walked, or more accurately 076 carried 105, for miles. Until reaching the closest central park. Preferably one that processed a lake, a couple trees, and a healthy amount of animal life. \n\nThe old photographer lays beside the lake shore. Her feet out to bathe against the cold water. Her fingers wiggle round the green grass. Ears could hear the cricket opera from behind the bushes. Winter hair fellow along the winds. 105 smiles at the embrace of nature.\n\n076 stood tall, rest at tree that leaf rained down. Wore the same straight face as always.\n\n105 weakened eyes took one final glance at the cosmic beauty. Although her sight is filtered through a blacken mist. As well as just barely held enough to keep to concentrate. It was still a mystical experience as always.\n\n“So, how far did you travel to see me? Did you awaken in West Korea or New Texas?” 105 asked eyes fixated to the magic above. Prepping for the shooting stars. “My contacts informed me how often they moved your cell. Keep you forming a plan or keep people active. I can’t recall the details. Can you? No, wait, they probably don’t tell you anything since the incident?”\n\n“…” 076 stay silent. Normally this insufferable conversation would have him silent the pest. Not this time, this time that big fat mouth was allow run as much as possible. Not like it’ll be long anyhow.\n\n“You remember how we met? Outside of that stupid test I mean. You were sitting alone from the rest of our team. We were having a quick celebration over a successful mission. One that averted a disaster due to…” The number was lost to her. The memory was still fresh as yesterday, but the little details around it have long since faded. Able recall the faces and names of the crew. Rough idea about the location, some plain the cafeteria. Everything else just hidden behind a haze of fog. “You remember, right?”\n\n“Nay.” He said lowering his head and tightening his fists.\n\n“I… I see.” 105 replied in a cold tone. “I wish your brother was here. He could remember those pesky little details, huh? Where is…”\n\n“Dead.”\n\n“I see, well good riddance if I do say.” The elder soul stroke the moist grass. Allowing the dirt to soak her fingertips. “As I was saying, we were all partying. Having pizza, playing games, and drinking whatever shit was laying around. Everyone just having a blast, everyone expect you. Sitting in the corner like a low-wolf wannabe. Remember?”\n\n“Yay.” He said has his face reddened. \n\n“I ask if you wanted a slice and you said: ‘THY TIS A WARRIOR FILTH SCARLET AND SOLELY REQUIRE THE FONDNESS OF BATTLE!’ To which I laugh and care you a drama-queen.”\n\n“Yay, thy remember that all too well.” Ancient warrior remark covering his face. \n\n“Afterward I promise to leave you alone if you play a game with us.”\n\n“Thy did, yet thous were quick forget their own words.”\n\n“WHAAAT? IT WAS A PARTY? YOU JUST DO ONE GAME? SO MAYBE I STRETCH THE MEANING A BIT?” She retorts in an overly-energetic manner. Waving her muddy hand all around.\n\n“That ‘twas the day thy learn of thous lair tongue.” \n\n“Whatever. You enjoyed it. I could tell. Since then I wasn’t going let you waste time being so moody.”\n\n“Instead, wasted time on thous poor trickery? yay, most pleasant indeed.” He remarks rolling his eyes.\n\nAt that moment a ray of light twinkle across the Black Sea. Each dash of light illuminated the darkness. Just so many flighting by. Soft colors stretching endlessly before fading away. There for nothing more than a mere moment, but long enough to craft a wondrous image. Some eve call it god very own universal painting. \n\n“Hey, can you promise me one thing? Don’t worry it’s nothing embarrassing or tuff or insufferable. Not even interesting really.”\n\n“…” There no reply. His throat began bubbling with a ton of words across the dictionary. No matter how hard they beat down, he stayed silent.\n\n“Help people, okay?”\n\n“Huh?”\n\n“Just help people. Don’t have to go out of your way to do anything extraordinary. Doesn’t have to be by much. Just take the time do a good deed here and there. Like pick-up the trash or lift a heavy box once in a while. Just make your life worthwhile. ”\n\n“Nay. Humans are-”\n\n“NO, STOP RIGHT THERE! Let me guess you big grump. Humans are: Weak, Predictable, Ignorant, Pathetic, Stupid, or Traitorous? Look I heard this preachy shit a good dozens upon dozen of times now. Humans aren’t the best, no arguing that. However, if you take the time and put in the effort we…” \n\nA small silent pause the world. As if the warrior was despair to hear one more word. “Rose?” At that moment 076 lean forward. Reached to the his company. Placing his fingers before her neck. That when he knew the obvious.\n\n…\n[[=]]\n**01/08/2022**\n**Site-19, 09:35 AM**\n[[/=]]\n\nAt that moment, SCP-105, Iris, awaken from her dreams. Stretched both arms outward as far as possible. Gave a quick yawn as eyes adjusted to the lights (or lack thereof) in the room (or cell). Grab the cup of water to race to her dry throat. When finally awaken, she notice there another individual at the door. Would be terrified by this development, if this wasn’t a week tradition. Every damn Tuesday an agent waits by that metal door to look menacing. Preferably when she gets up, to be like a boogeyman. \n\nOne blessing is that fact, the individual this time around was a friendly person. That is going by normal standards, not the low sadistic Foundation. Her name was [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-letter-from-a-undesired|Dr.Baker]]]. She at least has manner and brings homemade cookies. This time no different. She was short and elderly lady, acted like a grandma to Iris. Probably some tactic by The Foundation to the anonymous photographer. So long as cookies were coming, who gave a shit. \n\n“What is it, Dr.Baker? What the hell am I in for this morning?” Iris asked with a lazy eye roll. \n\n“The same as always, dear.” Dr.Baker then lean forward. “Care for a bite?” \n\n“F-” Iris caught herself halfway, quick to change the topic. “I mean, yes, yes I would.”\n\n“Good. Have as many as you like.”\n\nImmediately stolen least five right off the bat. That were half melted like she loves. “Don’t get me wrong, but I have to ask. Are you sure this is allow? You won’t get in trouble or shot for this? Don’t get me wrong, I love your cookies, but…”\n\n“Haven’t yet.”\n\n“Good enough.” Iris said stuffing down another cookie. “By the way, the answer still no. I ain’t joining no suicide squad. Get someone else to tagalong to that avengers-wannabe Alpha-9 crap. Preferably someone who hasn’t heard of that train wreck Omega-7.”\n\n“When did-” Before in that moment, Dr.Baker immediately knew who. Probably the same nutcase as always. Her damn troublesome-immortal-sister-in-law, Dr.Kegan, was such a tattletale about these little classified details. “Never mine. Have a couple more.”\n\n“YES, PLEASE!”\n\n…\n\n[[=]]\n**01/08/2022**\n**Area 25B, 09:35 AM**\n[[/=]]\n\nMeanwhile, in a metal tomb far below ground an ancient beast awaken. He had grey eyes and black wild hair as long as an arm. Fully covered in a thick black leather and a practically torn cloak. Few areas that exposed his olive skin were swamp in black arcana tattoos. This tall maniac simple known as SCP-076 or Able. \n\nUsually he walk out his coffin in a lustful wraith. Swing freshly manifested dark blades at all whomever opposes his sights. Often splatter red all across the environment. On occasions a glorious battle will abrupt to satisfy an animal urges.\n\nThis time he was hauled by that strange dream. It was so unusual. From the sounds, to the sights, to the very texture he touched. Whole thing was just so realistic and so wrong. Absolutely wrong. To spare a worthless live is heresy to the brutes lifestyle. Especially that old bitch. The meek, fragile shit, that loom over the ordeal. She so damn annoying, pathetic, and insufferable.  \n\nThe woman also so comforting. Like her very presence ease his heart. Almost like-\n\nAt that moment Able, acting purely on instinct, manifests a black block. Able right hand grab it with all his might before smashing his forehead in. He utility every once of strength he could muster. Resulting in cracks forming in his skull. As well as a river of blood gush from between the eyes. “Dreams are dreams, and that can never substitute reality.“ He proudly muttered.\n\n As if on cue the water began to flood the room. Reminding him where he was and what was about to happen. In a sense he is quite grateful to the… Jailers? Fountains? Founders? Burners? Who cares, the name really doesn’t matter. A name is as valuable as a life after all. Only worthwhile for a few moments at best. The mountain of soon to be corpses are prove of that statement. \n\n“Best get moving for Mother sake.” Able proclaim as he move forward to paint the upper walls red.\n\nInside the cold monitoring room an old man scream. Try to use whatever burst of energy he could to escape the maniac. “SHIT!”\n\n[[=]]\n**01/08/3322**\n**The Remembrance Valley, 09:35 AM**\n[[/=]]\n\nAmongst the warm garden a small girl chuckles. As she tries to races toward her hero. “REDDY!”\n\nA single warrior stood alone beside a peach tree and a tombstone. He had crimson eyes and hair as long as an arm. Garnishing animal fur and bronze armor below the waist. Upper body was bare, revealing cold pale skin covered in various black Nordic tattoos. This tall fellow simple known as #13577TG-076 or Thor.\n\nThe warrior could see the child from a mile away. At first took a small step back, upon seeing the child run towards him. Something about children was just so painful. Their stupid innocence smile withering away into wrinkly frown just insufferable. However, despite all his afford, he only took a step back.\n\n“There you are mister Reddy!” The child jiggled, named Petal, with her hand stretching out. She was a just like Rose in some many ways. From the natural violet hair and eyes. To that honey warm smile. Even that strange jovial upbeat accent was spot on. Although Rose had two arm, while the poor girl been missing one since birth. “Let play, let play!”\n\n“Nay, thous father and mother must be worried child. Best to where thy lives.” Thor said pointing at Petal family picnic a few meter away. \n\nThe kid was annoyed by that statement. She then widen her eyes like a puppy in the most manipulative display. “Can we play later, Reddy?”\n\n“…” In that cold moment Thor looked at Petal and for a moment saw Rose face. “Soon, young one. Thy promise.”\n\nTime was and is and will carry onward. All lives beside the immortal shall fade away. Nevertheless, he distracted himself for now by studying the location lone tombstone. So stay true to another promise nearly lost to history. Said tombstone was nothing special. Made from the same material the rest of it kind. Edges wither down due to the weather and other external factors. Still the words engraved on it remain as legible as ever. That what kept him returning over and over again. All just to read the following: \n\n[[=]]\n**HERE RESTS**\n**Rose Hill**\n**#73076PG-105, Friend, Agent, Wife, and Mother**\n**”Something Deep.”**\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=John Asknes]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
