Portable instances of SCP-1595 are to be transferred into Foundation custody, while stationary instances are to be documented and deleted. Use of Class-C amnestics is authorized when necessary.    \n\n**Description:** SCP-1595 is a series of numbered messages originating from various time periods and locations. SCP-1595's anomalous properties stem from their anachronistic nature; instances of SCP-1595 will often be written using methods which should not be available in the time period or location from which they originate, and are always in modern English. SCP-1595 messages are internally serialized, and each instance discovered will follow the one found before it, despite sometimes being written centuries earlier.\n\nAdditionally, analysis of the handwriting used in SCP-1595 messages indicates that they have been composed by the same person, regardless of the aforementioned chronological discrepancies. Of the sixty-seven messages found so far, fifty-three have been addressed to the same person, an unknown woman named \"Molly\". Of the remaining messages, three address a \"Danny\", two address a \"Ben\", four have an unknown addressee, and five are mostly illegible.  \n\n**Addendum SCP-1595-A:** The following is a list of notable instances of SCP-1595:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Log\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n> SCP-1595-1\n> \n> **Origin:** Chiseled on the inside of the ██████ family mausoleum, London. \n> \n> **Approximate date of writing:** 1700's \n> \n> **Recovered:** 1920\n> \n> **Message:** I know you're out there somewhere, Molly.

You always loved watching me work in the garage. \n>   \n> **Note:** ████ ██████'s death was determined to be a homicide, but the murder weapon was not identified.

Them, of all people? That takes guts, I'll give you that. It won't be enough though, not even where you are. Or rather, when you are. They can't protect you, not ever. \n> \n> **Note:** Enlistment papers also contained an African Elephant World Wildlife Fund 1st Stamp, dating to 2011. \n\n> SCP-1595-51\n> \n> **Origin:** Etched on a copper plate found in an unmarked tomb, Siberia. \n> \n> **Approximate date of writing:** 5,000-4,500 BCE\n> \n> **Recovered:** 1990\n> \n> **Message:** Can you hear the ticking, Molly? I hear it all the time, nowadays. It was irritating, at first, but I got used to it. You'd be surprised, the things you can get used to if you have to. Like the cage they must have put you and the kids in. How could you do that to them? \n> \n> **Note:** In addition to the body, the tomb contained three hundred (300) ivory beads, one hundred and fifty (150) fox teeth, and the remains of a .38 Smith & Wesson Special.
