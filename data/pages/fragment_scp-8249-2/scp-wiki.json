SCP-8249-A is to be provided with standard humanoid rations. Agent Esther Lewis should be kept appraised of the recovery of SCP-8249-A, and is considered an authoritative source regarding their strategies, possessions, and origins.\n\nSCP-8249-1 is currently in the possession of Agent Lewis to assist with a developing situation at Site-██. SCP-8249-1 should only be directly handled by Agent Lewis and/or SCP-8249-A, and handling of the item by other personnel must be kept to a minimum and/or conducted remotely. When not in use, SCP-8249-1 should be kept within its scabbard and the hilt securely covered to prevent accidental contact with the item. Testing of SCP-8249-1 with subjects is expressly forbidden.\n\nAll handling of SCP-8249-2 should be conducted by two or more authorised personnel, and kept to a minimum to prevent unnecessary damage and/or injury. When not in use, SCP-8249-2 should be kept within its scabbard and stored in a padded anomalous artefact container.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8249-1 is a steel arming sword[[footnote]]The stereotypical ‘one-handed’ sword associated with medieval combat.[[/footnote]] with a total length of 85 centimetres, which SCP-8249-A and SCP-8249-C refer to as ‘the Sword of Ages.’ Analysis indicates SCP-8249-1 has been repaired and reforged repeatedly throughout its history, with the current hilt formerly adorned with inlaid jewels which have been removed.\n\nWhen the hilt of SCP-8249-1 is directly held by a sapient subject, two interrelated properties are triggered:\n# The entirety of the wielder’s current memories are copied into SCP-8249-1, and continuously updated with new additions for the duration of physical contact;\n# The wielder spontaneously acquires all memories contained within SCP-8249-1, which cannot be removed by any means for the duration of physical contact.\n\nThe memories within SCP-8249-1 span several thousand years across multiple wielders, excluding several large gaps where  SCP-8249-1 was temporarily unused or lost for significant periods of time; there is currently no known method by which information can be removed from SCP-8249-1.\n\nSCP-8249-2 is a bearing sword[[footnote]]An intentionally-oversized sword intended for ceremonial displays of wealth, and typically too large for effective use in combat. A significant example is the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cdachi#%C5%8Cdachi_Norimitsu Ōdachi Norimitsu], which has a total length of 377 centimetres.[[/footnote]] 175 centimetres in total length, which SCP-8249-A refers to as ‘the Sunsword.’ The blade of SCP-8249-2 consists of a metallic rod embedded in the core of a single, large diamond, which has been cut into the shape of a conventional, unsharpened sword blade. The blade constantly emits small amounts of light, the properties of which match terrestrial daylight; this is allegedly due to SCP-8249-2 being created ‘in the Underforge Nithavellir,[[footnote]]The name of the home of dwarves in Norse mythology. The implication of this shared name between baseline reality and SCP-8249’s world of origin is uncertain.[[/footnote]] from the heart of a newborn star.’[[footnote]]The composition of the rod cannot be ascertained without irreparably damaging the diamond surrounding it; non-invasive observations indicate the substance is primarily iron-based.[[/footnote]] This emission has gradually decreased in luminosity throughout containment.\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 5:** SCP-8249-A Initial interview\n\nOn August 1st, 2024, SCP-8249-A regained consciousness following extensive treatment for advanced //Crotalus Viridis// envenomation. Researcher Le Guin was notified and attended to conduct an initial interview.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Footage depicts a medical recovery room for a single patient. SCP-8249-A is lying on the lone bed, connected to an IV drip and staring at the ceiling; they are handcuffed to the bed’s rails. There is a wall-mounted television opposite the bed, which has been left on at low volume.]//\n\n**???:** That sounds like Swiper the Fox!\n\n**???:** That sneaky fox is always trying to swipe our stuff!\n\n//[The door opens. SCP-8249-A watches Researcher Le Guin enter, closing the door behind her.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Good morning, Adam. How are you feeling?\n\n**???:** Will you keep a lookout for Swiper the Fox? If you see Swiper, yell ‘Swiper!’\n\n//[SCP-8249-A does not respond. Researcher Le Guin walks over to the television and turns it off; she then moves a seat to SCP-8249-A’s bedside and sits down, opening a clipboard folder on her lap.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** My name is Wynn Le Guin. I am a researcher here -- what you would call a scholar. May I ask you some questions?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A does not respond.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Allow me to address several assumptions you have. First, we are not your enemies. We are genuinely trying to help you.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A raises their arms, showing off the handcuffs and the casts preventing use of their fingers.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** You are restrained because you will attempt to flee otherwise. You need time and further treatment to recover, and to adjust to your new disability.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Disability?\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin nods. She moves to the foot of the bed, partially pulling the covers aside; SCP-8249-A’s left foot has been amputated several centimetres above the ankle. SCP-8249-A lowers their arms and stares at the bandaged stump.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** The foot was already necrotic when we recovered you. I am told that you are //incredibly// lucky to have not lost the entire leg, and the damage to your organs is recoverable. Your thaumaturgy may have assisted with that. Regardless, if we had not captured you for treatment, you would undoubtedly be deceased by now. As I said, we are trying to help you.\n\n//[Le Guin returns the covers and sits down again; SCP-8249-A continues staring at the end of their left leg.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** A prosthetic is already being prepared -- a metal replacement for your foot -- and once you are willing to co-operate with us, we can assist you in adapting to it --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I don’t want a Tyrant’s gifts.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** That is another misconception. We are not aligned with the Triumvirate.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** You aren’t Transients.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** You are correct, we aren’t affiliated with the Transient factions you are familiar with. But we are not involved with any of the Three Tyrants either -- we are not associated with the Triumvirate, or the unseen lord, or…\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin checks her notes.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** … the court of Ebutapakht.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A scoffs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** What are you then? Followers of the Fifth Power?\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin looks through her notes, then begins writing.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** We have not heard of a ‘Fifth Power’ before. I assume they are distinct from the four factions already mentioned?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A rolls his eyes and looks off to one side. Researcher Le Guin sighs.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Adam, this world is entirely distinct from the one you knew. We have found no evidence of any prior interactions between our worlds, or any awareness. We have never heard of the Three Tyrants before your arrival, nor any factions or figures from your history, and neither is there any indication of your world knowing of ours. Now except yourself and Bard.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A locks eyes with Researcher Le Guin.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** You've been speaking with the Bard.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** They are our only source of information regarding your world, beside yourself.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I take it they’ve been regaling you with stories about myself, too?\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** You are the topic they are most willing to discuss, and they will only educate us through narrative recounts.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** //[Turning away.]// Bastard.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** You disapprove?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No matter where I go or what I do, they’re always nearby spreading those blasted stories like a plague. Damn that parasite!\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Returning to my point, we are not subjects of the Triumvirate or any other faction you know of, despite appearances. They do not exist here. The motivations of our faction parallels your own, however; we also are trying to manage greater forces to protect the others of our species from their influence. We are, in a sense, this world’s version of yourself.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** And how do I know you aren’t just lying to trick me?\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Because those aligned with the Triumvirate do not lie.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** So you admit it.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** No. I am proving my claim; if Triumvirate’s subjects do not lie, then my statement that myself and my organisation are unaffiliated with the Triumvirate must either be the truth, or a lie -- in which case, I cannot be a subject of Triumvirate, because I have lied. \n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Then you’re with one of the other powers. \n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** The Bard has informed us our architecture only resembles the aesthetic style of the Triumvirate, and contradicts the style of the other Tyrants. We have no knowledge of this ‘Fifth Power,’ but unless their behaviours and aesthetics closely resemble the Triumvirate’s, I do not expect you will decide we are affiliated with them. Or do you disagree?\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Triumvirate deceives.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** But they do not lie, and I have made a direct statement on our association with them. We are not working for the Triumvirate.\n\n//[Another, long pause as Researcher Le Guin waits for SCP-8249-A to continue; after several moments of silence, she closes her clipboard and stands.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** I will give you time to consider this. Regardless of your conclusion we will continue to provide you with food, water, and medical treatment to ensure your recovery. Whether you will allow us to assist you further is your own decision.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** My sword.\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin checks her notes.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** I assume you mean the ‘Sword of Ages’?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Yes. If you are a friend like you say, you’ll give it back.\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** There is no reason for it to be returned to you at this time, because we both know you will use it to attempt an escape. That is not in your best interests.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Give it--\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** The Sword of Ages, along with the Sunsword and…\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin checks through her notes, then readies her pen.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Does your horse have a name?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A does not respond. Researcher Le Guin puts away the pen.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** They will be treated with due care and respect, but will not be returned until we are certain you will not attempt to threaten or harm our personnel with them.\n\n//[A pause. SCP-8249-A returns to staring at the ceiling.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** Do you have any further queries, concerns, or requests?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A does not respond.]//\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** We will resume this at a later time. I will ask the nurses to prepare your breakfast.\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin steps over to the television and turns it back on.]//\n\n**??? (Both):** Swiper, no swiping! Swiper, no swiping! Swiper, no…\n\n**Researcher Le Guin:** We have other entertainment available -- would you prefer to watch something else?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A does not respond, staring at the ceiling.]//\n\n**???:** You’re too late! You’ll never find it now!\n\n//[Researcher Le Guin waits a moment, then leaves the room.]//\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 6:** Improvised Interview of SCP-8249-A\n\nOn August 15th, 2024, SCP-8249-A requested to check on the condition of their horse. This request was approved; as SCP-8249-A was still recovering from envenomation and was unable to independently walk, the anomaly was transported by wheelchair and overseen by a medical assistant.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Footage depicts SCP-8249-A being brought into a common horse stable using a wheelchair; the camera is worn by Nurse Rodda, the porter moving him. Several of the stiles are occupied by various horses, and two stable hands are busy distributing hay. As SCP-8249-A is brought toward a pure-white mare in a stall, he makes a kissing noise; the horse turns at the sound, approaching the stile door and lowering its head into his reach.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** There you are. It’s been a while, hasn’t it? A long time since we’ve been so long apart. Are they looking after you?\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** Yes sir, she’s being well looked after, like you’ve been told.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A gently strokes the mare’s head.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I can see that -- I don’t remember the last time she was so clean. You feed her well?\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** She should be, yes. Orders would be to treat her like the others, if not better.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** And exercise? She isn’t kept in here all the time?\n\n//[The nearest stablehand, Arthur Nix, steps over and leans against the adjacent stile.]//\n\n**Nix:** Out  to pasture every day, where she can graze and run as she likes. You’re the owner?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** … sort of. Why?\n\n**Nix:** What’s her name?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** A… name? For a horse?\n\n**Nix:** Well yeah. You never… named her?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** … she’s a horse, you don’t usually name horses.\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**Nix:** Around here you do, especially champions like her. She outlasts every other horse we have, every time.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A grins, patting the mare.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** That sounds like her. The best of two worlds, queen of her kind. No, I… I never thought to name her, I guess.\n\n**Nix:** Well… does anything come to mind? Like a… a characteristic, or something?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A scoffs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Freedom, easily. Won’t do anything she doesn’t want to, runs like nothing else, and I can’t ever remember her being tired.\n\n**Nix:** You can say that again. Freedom she is, then!\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** … wait, I thought you meant… ‘Freedom’ isn’t a name.\n\n**Nix:** Why not? You said it fits her perfectly. Why’s she got to have a namey-name?\n\n//[A pause. SCP-8249-A shrugs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I… guess.\n\n**Nix:** What’s her breed?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I have no idea. Wild palfrey, I would guess.\n\n**Nix:** Wild -- you just found her? She isn’t purebred?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** As I said, I have no idea. Maybe she escaped from somewhere, maybe she was stolen, maybe she was born wild. Doesn’t matter to me -- I found her free-roaming, and she’s been reliable ever since.\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** How did you tame her?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A laughs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I didn’t, that’s why she doesn’t listen. I was on my way to…\n\n//[SCP-8249-A pauses, briefly staring ahead as his expression hardens.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** … an important meeting, and happened upon where she was tangled in a hunter’s snare. She was kicking up a ruckus because a pack of wolves had found her, I came over to see what was going on…\n\n**Nix:** You fought off a pack of wolves?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A glares at Nix.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Is that what the Bard’s been saying? That I fought off a pack of wolves with my bare hands, then ran for fifty million days at the speed of a stallion or something? Half the damn things ran off when I showed up, and the other half went when I swung my sword and shouted. She -- //[SCP-8249-A gestures to Freedom.]// -- was still frenetic so I gave her time to calm down, and some food to help. Then I just…\n\n//[SCP-8249-A pauses, then chuckles, shaking their head.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I was a bit of an idiot, and thought if I just slipped a loop of rope around her neck, she’d just follow wherever I led.\n\n**Nix:** //Ah.//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Mhmm. I cut her free, and next thing I know I’m half-way to Lesterton before I get her to stop. Then it took the //other// half before she decided to give me a chance. I got her into town and paid a few hands to break her in, but she wasn’t having any of that -- just knocked us over, ran off, and nobody could keep up with her. I thought I’d lost her for good but she came back after a while, and we went through the whole cycle a couple of times before I got the message and gave up. I didn’t tame her, I’m pretty sure //she// tamed //me.// Once we had that understanding we got along well, and off we went.\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** Why all the effort?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A holds up two fingers.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** One, dare I say it, I thought I could sell her for money. I think we all know how that would’ve gone if I’d tried it.\n\n**Nix:** Two?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Even an idiot like me could see she was //legendary//. She pulled me from Willowwood to Lesterton in under a day.\n\n//[Nix looks to Nurse Rodda, who shrugs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** It’s a bloody //long// way, I’ll tell you that. Understanding her put me nine or ten days behind in my journey, but once we set off I arrived three days //before// Svaldi did.\n\n**Nix:** //Oh.//\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** Who’s Svaldi?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** He…\n\n//[A pause. SCP-8249-A frowns.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I don’t want to talk about it. The point is she’s fast, she is her own, and nothing anyone can do will change that.\n\n**Nix:** Fair enough. Speaking of her, it's about time for her to go out  -- would you like to, or…?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Best not to, she might take off while I’m still holding the reins. I just wanted to see her and make sure she was alright.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A returns his focus to Freedom, giving it a final pat.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** You be good now, you hear? Don’t cause trouble for the fun of it. I’ll see you again when I can, ok?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A gently grabs the lead and gives it to Nix. Nurse Rodda moves SCP-8249-A away from the opening stall door.]//\n\n**Nix:** Alright then, Freedom, come along now.\n\n//[Nix leads Freedom out and toward the main entrance. Nurse Rodda turns SCP-8249-A’s chair, walking him back the way they had come; SCP-8249-A looks back and watches Freedom being led away. His smile fades into a sullen expression.]//\n\n**Nurse Rodda:** We can stay a little longer if--\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No, no. Let’s go.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 7:** Narrative Provided by SCP-8249-C Regarding ‘Svaldi Storm-in-the-Eye’\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n+++ ‘//Of Svaldi Storm-in-the-Eye and his Fall//’\n-----\nAh. Svaldi Storm-in-the-Eye, a once-great hero to rival the renown of Adam in his own time – but now a name said in scorn, a curse, made so by his own despicable acts.\n\nOnce there were many tales of Svaldi’s works, of victories foreseen and wrought with his mighty hands; but they are retold no longer, and all but forgotten because of it. Only two stories of him are yet repeated -- of his fall, the betrayal of his kind, and of his greater fall into death before the vengeful might of Adam.\n\nThough he never held the Sword of Ages -- a fortunate fact, for his touch would have been an eternal taint upon it -- his motives, in the first, aligned with those who did. Freedom, peace, prosperity; defiance of the Tyrants and their archons, liberty for those who did. But though he outwardly seemed so, and even for a time held friendship with Adam’s mentor, somewhere deep within his core was a seed of corruption which grew and flourished in the soil of his soul. He was valiant yet flamboyant, as drawn to crowds as they were to he; and though he was equal in might to others of his standing, all knew he thought himself the better. Such attributes are not wicked of themselves, unless indulged to excess -- but they were symptoms of a greater, growing disease within.\n\nI regret to say I do not know when his mind turned to treachery. Some say it came to him in a dream, wrought by those of the unseen lord; other blame the victory over a legion-hoard sent by Ebutapakht, the Court of Ten Thousand. So too are his reasons disputed, oft a lust for greater power or an ill-decided hope for everlasting peace; the stories are as varied as those seated in Court. But that his mind did change, for good or for ill, is well-known and undisputed.\n\nAdam’s predecessor, Saul, heard news of marching at the Westfold, a Triumvirate army moving into Transient kingdoms. He gathered his band to rally against them, for Triumvirate never moves without intent though its designs are oft occluded; but Svaldi brought word of a greater threat, that the unseen lord’s armies too were on the march across kingdoms.\n\nTerror seized them of the great peril they foresaw; one legion was trial enough, let alone two. But if news had reached them so too would Ebutapakht hear of it, and they would send an army of their own to meet the others. A fierce storm was brewing over the lands, a mighty clash between all three Tyrants; but the truth of the matter was hidden from them until the darkest hour.\n\nA plan was devised and set in motion. That the heroes would be divided was inescapable; both legions needed to be addressed and simultaneously so, but they could through great effort be redirected, and the brunt of their collision deflected from prosperous lands. Saul led those who would redirect the unseen lord’s forces; Svaldi led those going against Triumvirate.\n\nSaul’s journey was long, hurried, and of little significance until the end. The significance of the end was in the absence; they did not find the unseen lord’s forces, nor any such news in the towns and kingdoms they had supposedly passed through. They realised then of Svaldi’s lies, and turned back in haste; then the treachery was full-shown.\n\nTheir return was barred by the Clockwork Earth-Eater, an archon of the Triumvirate. Never before had any of Adam’s whole lineage dared to stand against an archon, whose power, stature and might is exceeded only by the very Tyrants they serve -- Saul and his allies too dared not, and in fleeing lost much pride and many of their number. Seven seasons passed before they could return home, and by then there was little to return to but the truth of their betrayal and the already-growing fall of the Transient golden age.\n\nSvaldi had sworn fealty to Triumvirate. How long before no-one yet knows, nor the core of his motivations in doing so; perhaps he sought to be an archon, or believed everlasting peace most likely beneath Triumvirate with the Emperor Orrery, or yet still that he simply had no mind of his own anymore and was merely a thrall for Triumvirate’s will. That he had lied of the unseen lord’s marching -- made true by Triumvirate’s growing conquest, then heading toward a prosperous kingdom’s capital of which I have spoken of in past -- was assured, and that he had done so to divide the group for easier conquest.\n\nNo sooner had his band come upon Triumvirate forces did he openly defect, and though it is known he spoke to his former kin the words are lost to time. The purpose was clear nonetheless -- surrender, or perish.\n\nThose faced with Triumvirate legion were never prepared to fight it. But they fought nonetheless.\n\nWhat became of Saul and his allies I have already well-spoken. Svaldi remained in service to Triumvirate for many, many years, and all throughout kept his master well ahead of Saul’s efforts; there was little he could do that Svaldi could not foresee, and in many other affairs he proved invaluable too. Many boons were given him in reward, but if to be an archon was his desire, that was denied him.\n\nThe season came when Svaldi marched out against an Ebutapakht archon, the Thousand Dragon, which was of particular difficulty to his master’s designs. All seemed typical for many a day until the dragon’s movement shifted, and in an uncommonly predictable manner. It seemed to travel suddenly and directly northward, away from Transient lands, instead of roving generally about as was its norm; Svaldi sought wisdom from the Triumvirate archives, and though he found little precedent in the dragon’s own behaviour, he did find that in recent years the Tyrants’ conflicts seemed pushed away from Transient lands, as they once had been long ago.\n\nHis men he sent to meet the dragon as intended; but Svaldi himself went alone into Transient kingdoms, knowing what the change meant and seeking to silence its source. Of course, news of Svaldi Storm-in-the-Eye’s return spread quickly and found its way to Adam’s ear. That he demanded for Saul’s successor made his intent clear; a confrontation was set, and met.\n\nWords fail me to fully describe the ferocity of their fight. The vigour of a once-greatest hero’s successor, met by the man who had brought his tutor low, defiled the future of his kind, and wrought the miserable age Adam was born into. A half-human fiend with little conscience, against the last kindling spark of the one he’d thought destroyed, a growing thorn in Triumvirate’s designs, and a lingering reminder of those he had betrayed, those allies who had perished because of his acts, and whose memories yet haunted him so. The greatest remaining Transient of the last age, against that of this one -- both equalled in might, resolve, and skill. Neither would accept stalemate, defeat, surrender. The fight would not cease until one lay dead, and their touch upon the world was obliterated.\n\nImagine the battle for yourself, if you can, but know that what you envision pales to nothing compared to how it truly played out. For five straight days they clashed, their fight moving through field, forest, chasm, town, watched from afar but never interrupted, as those who watched sided with Adam but feared Svaldi’s master. Beneath sun and moon the sound of crashing steel rung out through air scented with effort sweated and blood shed. Their strokes ebbed and flowed with their might; they rested only when both were too wearied to do anything more than grapple, and only until one felt refreshed enough to swing again. Many times throughout Svaldi tried to wrest the Sword of Ages from its master; but never did Adam yield it.\n\nThe end of their conflict came slowly and suddenly. Triumvirate, being the Tyrant of orderly designs, is predictable once one understands their logic; so too are those enthralled to them, though their minds are easier to discern. This was Svaldi’s undoing, as he had spent many, many years as Triumvirate thrall, and throughout had learned -- intentionally or no -- to think as they did. He could adapt, still being Transient at a core, but all to easily he fell into routine and struggled to escape it.\n\nAdam recognised this and led the fight into a rhythm. Every now and again he would test if Svaldi kept to the pattern, and once certain he would, his strokes became effortlessly predictable -- in the end, it was no difficulty to run his sword through what remained of Svaldi’s heart.\n\nSvaldi the once-great fell in a field in the Northern Reaches. He lies there still -- or rather, all across it -- for Transient hands did not bury or disturb his corpse, instead leaving it to be torn by wild beasts and whatever remained to be burned in scorn.\n\nNo memorials were erected to bear his name. No words were spoken to mourn his passing. Adam spat upon him and left; Triumvirate noticed a minor loss and forgot of him.\n\nSuch was the end of Svaldi Storm-in-the-Eye. Nothing and no-one bear his name anymore except in scorn; all that remains of him is shame and this tale, now ended. \n-----\n**Note/s:** Story exchanged with a recount of Robert Falcon Scott’s //Terra Nova// expedition.\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 8:** SCP-8249-A Physical Rehabilitation Session 17, September 30th, 2024.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Footage depicts the physical therapy treatment area of Site-87’s medical facilities.

This is still good progress, lets have a break so you can get your strength back, then we can give it another go.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No. No more. I’m done.\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** Adam, you really are making excellent progress --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I told you, I can’t do it! I can’t! One bloody snake, and now I can’t even stand --\n\n//[SCP-8249-A bashes the armrests of their chair. Several others around the room turn and look at the outburst; Tolkien dismisses them with a handwave, then crouches down to SCP-8249-A’s eye level.]//\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** You //can// do it. You just need more time, and to keep trying.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No. I’ve had enough. I’m tired of throwing myself at impossible goals. I’m tired of failing and falling and failing again. I’ve had enough. No more.\n\n//[A pause. Dr. Tolkien brings a chair over and sits down.]//\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** Just a few days ago, you couldn’t stand at all. Now you can walk --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I wouldn’t call that walking.\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** I would. Maybe not for long, but it’s progress, and the only thing you need to succeed is to keep making progress. I //know// you can do this. You spent five days fighting the greatest --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Don’t. Don’t lecture me with the damn story that bard has created. Don’t -- don’t talk about Svaldi as if killing him was some noble triumph. He was a good man. He did good things. He just…\n\n//[A pause, as SCP-8249-A stares blankly ahead.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** He was a good man. He //was// a hero. People sung praises of him, cherished him, and not for nothing. He did what he thought was good, but he… he made one mistake. One. And that was enough for everyone to turn against him, forget everything he’d done before, act like he was always evil. He… his death was not a triumph.\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it like that. I meant to say that you’ve done amazing things --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Nothing that hasn’t been done before, and done better. I’m not the outstanding heroic legend people talk of me as. I’m not even significant within my lineage. I’m just… I’m just another Adam. The forgettable one.\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** Another Adam?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** ‘Adam of the Transient’ is a title, not a name. One that’s supposed to be earned. My… my predecessor, before he took up the mantle, before he held the Sword of Ages as his own, he was a hero in his own right. Countless accomplishments to his name, long before he was called Adam -- he became Adam //because// of his earlier feats. His predecessor earned it too, and his own, and his, and his and his and his… everyone in my lineage proved they deserved it, proved to the previous they deserved to be next.\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** But not me. All I did was pick up a dead man’s sword. I only have it because there wasn’t enough time to find who actually deserved to have it. I’m just… I’m just the one who was chosen in desperation, the one who got it because there was no-one else to give it to. A nobody, both before and now. An interim. Waiting to pass it on and be forgotten, or… or fall, like Svaldi did, and have it taken from me. \n\n//[Another pause. Dr. Tolkien leans forward, steepling his fingers against his mouth.]//\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** I doubt someone will need to take it from you, you seem like a perfectly kind and sensible person.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** So did Svaldi. So did all of the Adams before me, and yet so, so many of them…\n\n//[A long pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** They did terrible things, in the name of Adam. //Terrible// things. Entire… entire kingdoms, people, have been completely //annihilated//. Thousands of, of innocent people… suffered, terribly, //needlessly//, because those… those who held the Sword, in their time, genuinely, unerringly, thought it was //right//. That those people //deserved// to die, because their very existence was…\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** That doesn’t mean you will be the same. If anything, it means you’re less likely to be like them -- you know what led them down that path, and you can hold yourself accountable.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** They knew too, and it didn’t help. Nothing I’ve done proves I’ll be anything more than they were. Nothing I //can// do will surpass what they’ve already done. I can’t… I just can’t do it. I will fall, or I will be forgotten, or both. I can’t do anything else. Nothing is enough. \n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** Adam, I’m sure --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Don’t… don’t call me Adam. I’m not Adam. I never was. I never will be. I’m just… nobody.\n\n//[Another pause.]//\n\n**Dr. Tolkien:** Ok. I… I think, we should call this a day, for now. I will speak to my superiors, and we’ll see about organising someone you can talk to --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Just… take me back to my room. Please.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n**Afterword:** SCP-8249-A was returned to their room, and Dr. Tolkien immediately alerted relevant personnel that SCP-8249-A was suffering from a significant depressive episode. Simultaneous to this, the daylight emissions from SCP-8249-2 declined to undetectably-low levels, and has remained functionally inert since; the significance of this is under investigation.\n[[/div]]\n-----\n\n**Addendum 9:** Interaction between SCP-8249-A and Agent Lewis\n\nSince the events of the previous log, SCP-8249-A has consistently declined further physical rehabilitation therapy, and where forced to participate has made no observable progress due to a significant lack of engagement. SCP-8249-A has similarly declined offers to check the wellbeing and treatment of //Freedom//, claiming ‘she’s better off without [him], and happier too.’ SCP-8249-A has continued to co-operate with Foundation personnel otherwise and participates in casual conversation, however personnel interacting with them have reported an evident decline in enthusiasm and a growing preference for self-isolation.\n\nOn October 12th, 2024, Agent Esther Lewis requested permission to interact with SCP-8249-A directly, to encourage them to resume their rehabilitation. Although Agent Lewis is critically required for the ongoing containment failure situation at Site-██, this request was approved; the following is a transcript of their interaction.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Footage depicts SCP-8249-A sitting alone in their sparsely-furnished personal quarters. They are watching television with a blank expression.]//\n\n**??? (TV):** //[Three knocks.]// Penny. //[Three knocks.]// Penny. //[Three knocks.]// Penny.\n\n//[A door opens in the television show, followed by canned laughter. SCP-8249-A doesn’t react.]//\n\n**??? (TV):** Sheldon, what are you //wearing?//\n\n**??? (TV):** I need help.\n\n//[Canned laughter. A pause.]//\n\n**??? (TV):** You’re realising that now?\n\n//[More canned laughter; SCP-8249-A still does not react. There is a knock at the door and SCP-8249-A grunts; Agent Lewis enters carrying a long briefcase and closes the door behind her. SCP-8249-A doesn’t look away from the TV. Agent Lewis watches silently for a moment.]//\n\n**??? (TV):** -- sit down and tell me what happened.\n\n**??? (TV):** Well, last week I found out Professor --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** //Big Bang Theory//?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A glances at Esther.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Who are you?\n\n**??? (TV):** -- needed a radioactive --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You don’t remember?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Figures, you were in bad shape when we got you. You’re lucky you’ve only lost a few memories.\n\n//[Agent Lewis steps over and turns the TV off.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** I’m one of the ones who caught you, and apparently the person who’s going to save you from that garbage. Please tell me you haven’t been binging.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Binging…?\n\n**Agent Lewis:** How long have you been watching it for.\n\n//[A pause. SCP-8249-A shrugs. Agent Lewis sighs.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** At least it isn’t //Seinfeld//… look, enough of that junk, you’ve got better things to do than binge stupid sitcoms.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A shakes his head and turns the TV back on with the remote.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I’m not doing those damn exercises anymore. There’s no point.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You need to recover, and the --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I don’t //need// to do anything, because I’m not need//ed//. I’m not… I don’t --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** I need you. We need you. Your whole damn world needs you.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** They need //Adam//. I’m not he.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You have the Sword of Ages --\n\n//[SCP-8249-A holds both palms upright.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Not now I don’t, and I never deserved it anyway. Go find someone else, and leave me alone. I’m done.\n\n**??? (TV):** Bernadette and I went to --\n\n//[Agent Lewis grabs the remote from SCP-8249-A, turns the TV off, then throws the remote at the wall to destroy it.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Hey!\n\n**Agent Lewis:** I’m not letting you waste your time on crap like that, Adam --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I’m not Adam!\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes, you are! You are Adam of the Transient, wielder of the Sword of Ages, the latest face of the hero with a thousand, and you //are// going to get off your damn arse and stop acting like a sook!\n\n//[SCP-8249-A lunges at Agent Lewis, who effortlessly shoves him aside, sending him sprawling to the ground. SCP-8249-A stays facedown and begins to weep. Esther’s expression softens.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** … shoot, that’s not -- I’m sorry, I didn’t mean --\n\n//[Agent Lewis crouches down to help SCP-8249-A, but he recoils away.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Don’t touch me! Just leave me alone! Go away! Get out!\n\n//[A brief pause, then Agent Lewis backs away from SCP-8249-A, but doesn’t leave. A minute passes as SCP-8249-A sobs, covering his face with his hands, and Esther silently watches.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Adam, I --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** //(Shrieking)// Don’t call me Adam, I’m not Adam, I never will be!\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to speak like that. But I can’t leave you like this, you’re too important.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** I’m not --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes, you are. Yes. You. Are. You are far, far more important than you give yourself credit, and you are far, far stronger than you tell yourself.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No, I’m not, I can’t even stand --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** That’s not what I meant. You might be physically weak -- for now -- but your heart is strong. You can set yourself to great things and succeed.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A shakes their head. They shift into a sitting position.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No. I’m not -- I’m not. I’m a lesser son of greater sires. I haven’t -- I //can’t// do anything that anyone else hasn’t done better.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** No, you --\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Yes, I am, and there’s no point in denying it! You can’t change the truth just by… just by ignoring it! Stop trying to deny it!\n\n**Agent Lewis:** And how do you know it’s a truth? Where’s the proof? How do you know you can’t do better?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Because I’m a coward! Because -- because when I came here, I was running. I was…\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You were losing the fight with the archon, and you were running away.\n\n//[Another pause. SCP-8249-A pulls their legs in close and hides their face between their knees.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** So?\n\n//[SCP-8249-A looks up at Agent Lewis.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** How does that make you a coward?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Adam doesn’t run.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes, he does. Your teacher ran when he was faced by the Clockwork Earth-Eater. He and all his friends ran.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** The others Svaldi betrayed stood and fought.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Because they had no choice, and they died. It was a heroic stand, yes, but every single one of them died, while those who ran, lived. Lived to fight another day, lived to keep the fire alight. Your teacher ran, and he lived to find you, and //you// finished the fight because //you// are stronger than they were. It isn’t cowardice to recognise an opponent is stronger and retreat -- it’s just sensible.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A scoffs.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Sensible? Sensible is to know your place in life and not waste time trying to accomplish things beyond your grasp. If I was sensible, I never would’ve picked a fight with an archon in the first place.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Then why did you?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Because I was an idiot, and thought I could.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Say the truth.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** That is --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** //Part// of the truth, but not all of it. Say it all. Why did you //want// to defeat an archon?\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Because no-one ever had before. No Adam has ever fought an archon and won. I… I thought…\n\n//[Another pause.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You thought you could be the first, and you would be remembered for it.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You thought it would prove you’re an Adam. That you deserve the title, and the Sword.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes, or no.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** All I proved is that I’m a failure to the name. I deserve to be forgotten.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** But you tried. Success or not, you are the first Adam to actually go out of his way to //try//. Everyone before you have always turned and run at the first sight of an archon. Even your predecessor.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Even me.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** But you tried first, you fought before you fled -- and you //survived//. Has any Adam ever fought an archon and lived to tell of it? Has anyone at all, for that matter?\n\n//[A pause.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** For thousands of years, everyone has thought it can’t be done, it won’t be done, and never bothered to test it. You and you alone are the first to think ‘maybe it //can//,’ to see if it could, and show that maybe one day, it //will// be done. //That// is why you were given the Sword of Ages. You weren’t given it because there was no-one else left to take it. You were specifically //chosen// because out of your entire village -- out of everyone your mentor met, across years and years and years of searching -- you were the only one that had what it took to be Adam. You dream of better days, just like everyone does; but you have the guts to actually do something to create them. You dare to //try//. That is why you are Adam. That is why you are known, and remembered, as a hero.\n\n//[A long pause. SCP-8249-A sniffles, wiping their tears on their sleeve.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** But -- what if I make a mistake?\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Then you learn from it and grow. You become a better person than you already are. Who cares what people think of you? Why should that stop you from doing what’s right?\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Svaldi --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You’re nothing like he was.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** But --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** No, you’re not, because you’re a Transient at heart, and he was not. Yes, he did good things for a time, and yes, he made a mistake. But he committed to it, and never turned back from it -- //that// is why he’s forgotten. You are better than that. You will make mistakes, but you learn from them, and you turn back from them. Your attempts to tame the wild mare -- you made the mistake of thinking she could be tamed, you realised your mistake, and in turning back, you succeeded in convincing her. Which do you think people are more likely to retell and remember: the story of a man who arrogantly kept trying to do the same thing to no avail, or a man who changed his ways and accomplished a great feat because of it?\n\n//[A pause. SCP-8249-A nods, relaxing his posture, sniffling, and wiping his eyes again. Agent Lewis offers a hand; SCP-8249-A accepts it, and Agent Lewis helps him up and back into his seat.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You are a good man, and far from forgettable. Don’t be afraid to try. Don’t be afraid to fail. Just remember to get up, learn, and try again.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A nods, wiping his nose on his sleeve. Agent Lewis grimaces.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** And get a handkerchief, that’s disgusting.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A frowns.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** Hand--\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Forget it, we’ll deal with it later. What matters is that you need to get back into your rehab, because I can’t buy you much more time.\n\n//[Agent Lewis picks up the suitcase, resting it on one knee to unclip it.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** … what do you mean? What’s happening?\n\n//[The suitcase opens to reveal SCP-8249-1, in its scabbard and with a cover wrapped around the handle; Agent Lewis turns the suitcase, offering the sword’s handle to SCP-8249-A. SCP-8249-A removes the cover and grips SCP-8249-1; pauses; pales.]//\n\n**Agent Lewis:** You have to do it.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No.\n\n**Agent Lewis:** Yes.\n\n//[SCP-8249-A lets go of the handle.]//\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No, I’m not -- I can’t…\n\n**Agent Lewis:** I didn’t want it to go this way, but we don’t have time for you to waste on your arse. You need to get back into rehab, and you need to get ready.\n\n**SCP-8249-A:** No, I am //not// fighting that thing again --\n\n**Agent Lewis:** It isn’t a choice. There’s nowhere left to run, and once it’s out, it’s going to find you, eventually. Either //you// kill //it//, or //it// will kill us all.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n-----\n\n|| **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8249/offset/2 Page 3 of 3 >>]** ||",
