For the various employees of the Foundation, the regular day-to-day work of securing and researching the anomalous is only one part of their lives. Fishing Council's a chance to explore the slice-of-life-style connections that form between these people in a space adjacent to their professional environment -- the fishing itself is entirely optional.\n\nThat or it's about some pals going fishing, up to you I suppose. \n\n-----\n\nCurrently, the series is broken into four groupings: \n* **__\"The Great Fishing Saga:\"__** A continuing narrative focusing on a specific group of people and one whale. I have some plans for this but am always open to suggestions/people getting involved. \n* **__\"Fishing Tales:\"__** One-off stories related to the Fishing Council at Site-184 (and/or other locations!)\n* **\"Fishing Trips:**\" Accounts of Fishing Council members' experiences at Foundation Sites around the world. \n* **__\"Catch of the Day:\"__** Fishing Council-related SCPs. \n\n-----\n\nBoth the **Fishing Tales** and **Fishing Trips** sections are extremely open to anyone! And if you've got an idea for a related SCP or your own Fishing Council Series, that sounds super cool and I want to read it!\n\nFishing knowledge is not required! If you want to write something for Fishing Council go ahead and do that. As they say, there's plenty of fish in the sea![[footnote]] That's what that refers to, right?

Works in Anamolaous Art & Artefacts. \n* Sarah Colleart: The resident [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5516 lobster] expert at 184, may have a harder time with human social interactions. In a long-term relationship with Jennifer, who also works on-site in Art & Artefacts. \n* Henry Ivanon: Overworked and tired, got dragged into this, but not-so-secretly really enjoys this. Father of two young children.\n* Greg Albsernester: A Foundation Naval Architect, and the biggest fishing enthusiast of the lost, Greg usually wears cable-knit and owns the Fishing Council vessel, //The Holy Mackeral,// and that basically says more about his character than anything I could add.\n* Charles Cohen: A representative of the Dept. of Anomalous Communications and Relations, Charles has a 'winning smile' a can-do attitude, and employs copious usage of finger guns; if the Foundation thing doesn't work out, he has a job lined up at a used car dealership.\n* Peter Lebedev: A 15-year-old boy, from WW2 Russia, currently [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-5597 stuck inside the body of a whale].
