Eight(8) Scranton Reality Anchors are to be placed in the containment cell, one in each corner. We implemented these procedures back when we thought this was just a normal hole in reality. They ended up not really working, but we keep them around for the sake of the story. That’s the real containment procedure: The story, or stories, you’ve formed while getting here. Even you reading this right now is continuing the story.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8642 is a localized pocket of un-narrative. At first we thought it was a pocket of nothing, like SCP-3930, but that didn’t quite fit the bill. Then we thought it might be a spatial or temporal anomaly, but testing showed it wasn’t either. Eventually we realized that it only affected 2 things: narrative stories, and the fabric of reality. SCP-8642 exclusively affects narrative stories, drawing them into itself. It tugs on reality in the same way, like it’s trying to fill itself. Now, that doesn't seem too weird (by Foundation standards) until you start to get philosophical about it. Something that’s looking for a story to fill itself, and tugging on reality to get it…\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8642 was detected ██/██/████ during the inspection of a newly-built wing of containment cells at Site-19. Kinda funny, actually; brand-new containment cells, and one already has an anomaly! An anomaly that’s just a missing story.\n\nThen we figured out how to start detecting these pockets, and realized that they were all over the Foundation! Of course we freaked out a little bit when we realized that, but then we looked deeper. We realized that these pockets only existed in places where there were Skip Numbers that had no anomaly yet; that had no story. Once a new anomaly filled the slot, the pockets of un-narrative disappeared. Once a story filled the void, the universe became a little more whole.\n\n**Addendum:** There is nothing more powerful than a story, especially in a world that’s built by cool, creative storytellers. Our world is kept alive by Them and everything They write. Without Them, without You, we wouldn’t even be here. Most of the Foundation is terrified of that, but not me. I’m more scared of what our universe would be like without Them: nothing. A void.\n\nThat’s what we’re containing here. A spot with no story. A slot waiting to be filled in. I don’t know why we were suddenly able to see this particular empty slot. Maybe it’s something waiting to be filled in, maybe it’s here on purpose; I don’t know. But I do know that someone needs to write those stories to fill in those SCP slots.\n\nNow, I don’t want to push You. I know writing a good story takes time, and good people like You need rest, relaxation, food, and water. I know you love our world, and when you’re ready, you’ll write the best story that you can! Who knows? Maybe this spot with no story is just waiting for the story that You write.\n\nAnd if you say you can’t, I say that’s bullshit. After all, you clicked through all the pages to make it here. That just shows how much you love this world.\n\nThank you.\n\nHead Researcher Hannah  ████\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n\nP.S.
