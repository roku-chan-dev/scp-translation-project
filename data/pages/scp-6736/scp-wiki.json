The task force is to document SCP-6736-Aleph instances present in the environment and neutralize all glyphs of class 'Cathay' and class 'Carthage'. Counter-glyphs of class 'Garden', class 'Cloud', and class 'Yerevan' are to be utilized during SCP-6736-Caspian, -Ctesiphon, and -Carthage events. SCP-6736-Aleph  instances identified by the public are to be neutralized and a cover story implicating GoI-4302 ('Children of Fire') is to be distributed.\n\nPer **Reintegration Protocol #6736**, instances of SCP-6736 housed at facilities outside Site-90 must be returned to Site-90 upon request. Instances in containment are to be housed together in 10m x 10m x 5m amphibious terrariums and always have materials available to enable written communication. Facilities currently authorized to house SCP-6736 include Site-17; Site-██; Site-28, Site-35; Site-48 (Variant Wing C); Site-██; Site-73; Zoological Facility-B34; Botanical Facility-Ш1; Facility-Λ9; Ethics Committee Baku Office; Tactical Theology ██████ Office.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6736 is a population of the genus //Eoscapherpeton// in the family of giant salamanders. It is currently native to the Caspian Hyrcanian forest ecoregion, but was present in a much wider range encompassing Asia Minor, Central Asia, and South Asia until as recently as seventy years ago.[[footnote]] SCP-6736's largest population range during the Anthropocene epoch occurred during the 1950s.[[/footnote]] SCP-6736 is similar in physiology to other species of giant salamander, with the exception of bioluminescent markings on their extremities and epidermal glands capable of secreting a sulfur-based toxin.[[footnote]]This compound is mildly irritating to humans and irritating or life-threatening to small vertebrates.[[/footnote]] SCP-6736 have indefinite lifespans in captivity and retain the ability to regenerate limbs and to undergo neoteny[[footnote]] Reemergence of traits from earlier stages of development in adulthood.[[/footnote]] of the gills.\n\nSCP-6736 instances are sapient, and develop cognition comparable to five-year-old human children[[footnote]]Most members of SCP-6736 do not reach a level of cognitive function past this point, but some may develop greater intelligence as they age.[[/footnote]] if they are exposed to interactive social structures. Members of SCP-6736 are capable of recognizing human faces and personalities, and will socialize with human observers as equals if encountered.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=10\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=250px\n|url=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6736/scp-6xxx-salamancers-bertha.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-6736-032 ('Edna'), estimated age 59, housed at Variant Site-48.\n]]\nMembers of SCP-6736 communicate using a sophisticated combination of percussive noise, body language, gestures, vocalizations, drawing, and writing. They are able to communicate emotions and abstract concepts through an understanding of symbolism. With sufficient education they can comprehend arithmetic, multiple expressions of human language, and be trained to participate fluently in conversation using Morse code. SCP-6736's communication makes use of multiple politeness registers, with formal introductions usually involving the collaborative creation of a pictogram.[[footnote]] These pictograms are referred to hereafter as Hyrcanian Pictography. [[/footnote]]\n\nMembers of SCP-6736 exhibit a passive antimemetic effect, making them difficult to directly observe. Individuals struggle to perceive members of SCP-6736 as fixed objects in their environment, often losing track of them or failing to notice them entirely. This effect is cumulative, amplifying with each instance of SCP-6736 present in a given space. Large or tightly-packed groups exhibit such a strong effect that they can become visually undetectable. This effect is lessened significantly when instances interact with people they recognize.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum- SCP-6736-Aleph\" hide=\"- Addendum- SCP-6736-Aleph\"]]\n**SCP-6736-Aleph** is the designation for thaumatological effects associated with the Hyrcanian Pictography. Wild specimens of SCP-6736 are able to create syntactically unique pictograms using a combination of the Hyrcanian Pictography and collective ritual, such as music and dance, from a very young age. These rituals can radically alter the local weather and ecology of the area in which they are performed. Wild specimens will instinctively draw pictograms using whatever medium is available, including soil, tree resin, algae, foliage, mucus and writing utensils. Hycranian Pictography tends to appear more often in the environment during important stages of SCP-6736's life cycle, such as breeding season or after forest fires.\n\nIndividual glyphs do not, in and of themselves, manifest thaumatological effects; rather, SCP-6736 uses the symbols to communicate concepts to each other, causing the thaumatological effects to activate as SCP-6736 performs other tasks. Because of this, a symbol's effect changes in proportion to the frequency of its use, fluctuating in \"power\" as SCP-6736 creates or erases it from its surroundings. The effects manifested are categorized below by memetic class.\n\n||~ Memetic Class ||~ Glyphs ||~ Description ||\n|| **Garden** || [[=image scp-salamancer-garden.png]] || Invokes the Earth and instincts.||\n|| **Cloud** || [[=image scp-salamancer-cloud.png]] || Invokes water and survival.||\n|| **Caspian** || [[=image scp-salamancer-caspian.png]] || Invokes the sky and socializing.||\n|| **Ctesiphon** || [[=image scp-salamancer-ctesiphon.png]] || Invokes fire and birth.||\n|| **Cathay** || [[=image scp-salamancer-cathay.png]] || Invokes wisdom and history.||\n|| **Carthage** || [[=image scp-salamancer-carthage.png]] || Invokes salt and death.||\n|| **Yerevan** || [[=image scp-salamancer-yerevan.png]] || Invokes humanity and the artificial.||\n\nThe following passages are cited from //Authors of the Earth// by Dr. Yasya Najafabadi, PhD in Historical Linguistics, published internally in 2006:\n-----\n[[div class=\"textbook\"]]\nSo, when did the Hyrcanians develop their script? A simple question with a complicated answer. We must first take into account that the script is not, in any sense, developed. Logographies as typified by Chinese characters utilize both precise calligraphy and an established lexicon to disseminate meaning. For Hyrcanians, these are only suggestions. The set of glyphs used throughout this text cover over 95% of known lexical items, but the number of potential glyphs is functionally infinite. We speculate that SCP-6736's \"vocabulary\" has grown and shrunk many times throughout history . . .\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"textbook\"]]\n. . . Suppose you have written a note card and a highly intricate message, or heard a spoken message that you will not hear again. You might resort to the use of shorthand and abbreviation to condense such information. Writing exists to not only assign a reproducible value to phonetic information, but also to maintain that value across generations as phonetics change. Many people believe, incorrectly, that the Hycranian script functions in the same way. But human historical precedent would disagree.\n\nLanguages change as their speakers do. For writing systems developed for oral traditions, radical shifts in meaning are an inevitability. But for Hyrcanians, the phonemic value[[footnote]]Amount of distinct sounds within a language. Hycranian uses a three-vowel system and multiple consonants to which there are no human analogs.[[/footnote]] of their voice has no bearing on the words written, and symbols can be made, changed or unmade on a whim. So, where is meaning derived? As far as we can tell, cultural value, context, and not much else . . .\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"textbook\"]]\n. . . If we know that the myths associated with salamanders have reflected Aleph-class events since at least Pliny the Elder, then it's easy to claim Hyrcanian was established nearly two millennia ago. But, this is not the complete picture either. Do we go back further, make connections between their writing and our proto-writing, our hieroglyphs? It will serve us better to start with something concrete: our oldest preserved Hyrcanian glyphs shortly predate the Sassanian Empire, and this period is more bountiful in evidence than any others before 1700 . . .\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"textbook\"]]\n. . . The most unique aspect of Hyrcanian is that it does not exist to transmit information to the future. The fundamental motivation of all physical mediums developed by humanity, to outlast our ephemeral use of language, is a notion which Hyrcanian pictograms reject. Hyrcanians have preserved their gift not through reason, but through instinct. While our language survives to tell us what //has happened//, Hyrcanian tells its speakers what //is happening//.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=10\n|speed=500\n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=250px\n|url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/45/Japanese_giant_salamanders_in_Tottori_Prefecture%2C_Japan.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Two adult members of SCP-6736 adjusting to a Site-90 terrarium.\n]]\n\n**Addendum- Discovery:** SCP-6736 was poorly studied prior to the 1950s. Because of the species' antimemetic properties, accurate population estimates are exceedingly difficult to collect, but environmental markers suggest a current population ranging anywhere between 12,000 and 100,000 individuals. Their anomalous abilities were discovered in 1954, when a captive member of SCP-6736 produced glyphs as part of a circus exhibition in Astara, Iran. Interrogation of the proprietors led the Foundation to GoI-4302 ('Children of Fire'), a millenarian sect of Zoroastrianism.\n\nFurther probing from an agent recruited from within GoI-4302 resulted in the discovery of a compound in Sorkhanhol Wildlife Refuge which contained at least 14 instances of SCP-6736. A mobile task force entered the facility and the instances were contained.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Refuge Log\" hide=\"- Refuge Log\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n**21/05/1954**\n[[/>]]\n\n**Foreword:** //Agent Uysal, Agent Zhordania, and informant Alizadeh isolate two members of SCP-6736 for observation in a chamber exposed to the surrounding forest.

Thus, an established history of SCP-6736 does not extend much further back than the 20th century. However, it is well-established that SCP-6736 was critically endangered by the mid-90s, primarily due to aggressive policies enacted against GoI-4302 by Iran and the Soviet Union.\n\nGoI-4302 covertly maintained populations of SCP-6736 for an undetermined amount of time.[[footnote]]Members claim, without evidence, a direct descent of their sect from Shah Ardashir I.[[/footnote]] Surveillance of the group was made difficult by concurrent political conflicts and opposition to Foundation activity in the region. SCP-6736-Aleph events related to GoI-4302 were thus responded to on a case-by-case basis.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Class-Ctesiphon Event 06\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n**26/07/1975**\n[[/>]]\n\n**Description:** A high-magnitude Class-Ctesiphon event occurred in Golestan National Park, Iran. GoI-4302 organized the event by relocating various broods to a centralized location within the surrounding forest. Using the glyphs for \"fire\", \"tree\", and \"storm\", GoI-4302 created a forest fire over an area of approximately 16km^^2^^. Within this forest fire was a clutch of approximately 10,000 eggs belonging to SCP-6736, which were protected from the intense heat. Approximately 6,000 hatchlings were believed to have been released by this Class-Ctesiphon event.\n\n[[=image scp-firestormbreed.png]]\n\n**Conclusion:** Foundation agents tasked with controlling the population of SCP-6736 immediately identified the forest fire as a result of anomaly, and successfully terminated over 2,000 instances spawned from event.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Class-Caspian Event 02\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n**01/05/1984**\n[[/>]]\n\n**Description:** in 1979, the Islamic Republic of Iran established a prohibition on both Foundation activity and the activity of GoI-4302. Public displays of the Children of Fire's Zoroastrian beliefs were criminalized, resulting in the group's clandestine activity increasing and millenarian philosophy becoming more radical. Incorporation of psychotropic substances into religious ceremonies, including the administration of substances to SCP-6736 instances, became a practice of the sect. Glyphs for \"know\", \"sky\", \"horizon\", and \"king\" were scrawled throughout a compound in Ajan Sangarli, Iran. The resulting Class-Caspian event was a memetic hazard affecting members of GoI-4302 and SCP-6736. Subjects experienced visions described as apocalyptic, perceiving the return of a Shah[[footnote]] Referring to a mythical pre-Islamic Shah, not Mohammad Reza Pahlavi or his descendants.[[/footnote]] who would serve as a world leader in league with the \"Spenta Mainyu\"[[footnote]] \"Holy spirits/mentality\" [[/footnote]] in a battle against the \"Angra Mainyu\".[[footnote]] \"Destructive spirits/mentality\" [[/footnote]]\n\n[[=image scp-knowskyhistoryking.png]]\n\n**Conclusion:** Activity discovered retroactively following first Class-Carthage Event.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Class-Carthage Event 01\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n**04/08/1985**\n[[/>]]\n\n**Description:** The group of individuals and SCP-6736 affected by SCP-6736-Caspian-02 trekked to the city of Aralsk, Kazakhstan. Approximately 5,000 instances of SCP-6736 were compelled by memetic hazard to scrawl the symbols for \"salt/danger\", \"ritual\", \"sandstorm\", and \"king\". Interviews of GoI-4302 members involved suggest that this was an attempt to prevent or delay the arrival of the Angra Mainyu. \n\nAt approximately 12:00 local time, an anomalous sandstorm began to develop in the region, affecting an area of nearly 2,500km^^2^^. The storm persisted for several days and resulted in over nine hundred casualties. A profound ecological collapse would later affect the surrounding farmland, degrading the corridor from the Aral Sea to the Caspian Sea into a massive salt flat.\n\n[[=image scp-saltritualhorizonking.png]]\n\n**Conclusion:** Attempts to reverse environmental damage are ongoing, but are hindered by both a lack of cooperation with Foundation personnel and existing hydropower and irrigation installations draining the Aral Sea further.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe government of the Soviet Union would later respond with procedures to neutralize SCP-6736.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ GRU Division \"P\" Memorandum\" hide=\"- Hide Memorandum\"]]\n[[div class=\"gru\"]]\n**@@ OSI \"SCYTHIAN\"          |     DIVISION \"P\" DEPARTMENT II @@**\n**@@ APPROVED 13.XI.1985     |     PRINTOUT NR: 3 @@**\n**@@ SIGNED ..................

Outside of an estimated 2,000 specimens in Azerbaijan and 200 in Turkmenistan, SCP-6736 is now considered functionally extinct within the borders of the former Soviet Union.\n-----\n**Addendum- Reintegration Proposal:**\nFollowing multiple decades of continued observation and study, Site-90 concluded that SCP-6736 was of no apparent risk to Foundation personnel and declared it safely contained. Resident research head Ezekiel Hammond made an appeal to the Foundation Ethics Committee in October of the same year, citing that the species' capacity for intelligent thought were potential assets to future containment efforts and study of similar organisms. Also cited was a successful reversal of a Class-Carthage event's effect on soil salinity within Site-90, achieved by informing SCP-6736 of the event's negative effects and through the utilization of Cloud and Garden counter-glyphs.\n[[div class=\"appeal\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: left; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 16px; padding: 0px;\"]]]]\n[[span class=\"date\"]]**From the Office of\nDr. Ezekiel Hammond, Site-90\n10/10/2016**[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n++ **__To the Office of the Ethics Committee__**\n//Regarding the protection of SCP-6736 under the Pseudohuman Civil Rights Act//\n+++++ **Forward to: Ethics Committee members E-1 through E14; E-21; E-25; E-40; E-49**\n-----\nI, Site-90 head researcher Ezekiel Hammond, submit the following to the Ethics Committee:\n* SCP-6736 is an integral component of its local biosphere;\n* SCP-6736 has potential applications as a means of terraforming or environmental restoration;\n* SCP-6736's anomalous properties do not pose a risk to continued containment, or to the exposure of itself or other Foundation assets;\n* SCP-6736's anomalous properties are easily controlled and monitored, and they have the potential to positively impact Foundation site security and morale with their presence if accommodated;\n* SCP-6736 has repeatedly demonstrated a capacity for human or near-human intellect and properties of sapience as defined under the Pseudohuman Civil Rights Act:\n *  Understanding of personhood, perception of self by other intelligent creatures and individual and group identity;\n *  Distinct cultural traditions and values;\n *  Ability to communicate fluently with humans (trained in use of Morse code);\n *  Capacity for intelligent, peer-to-peer communication as defined in the 2016 edition of the Ngwane-Turei Accord;\n *  Complex internal concepts of self such as empathy, altruism, and the creation and maintenance of multiple types of social bonds;\n *  Command over basic forms of thaumaturgy and ritual\n\nIt is my professional opinion that SCP-6736 is a sapient, autonomous entity of minimal risk to itself or others, and is therefore eligible for a reintegration appeal.

Over the course of the next several months, they completed an exhaustive assessment of the site's internal records and resident staff, testing over one hundred of Site-90's SCP-6736 instances for cognitive ability, thaumatological properties and capacity for socialization.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Hatess Entry 0058: SCP-6736 Appeal, Day 0 Field Study\" hide=\"- Hide Entry\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:** //Representative Hatess is accompanying a pair of Lambda-40 agents (Lim Chung-Ho and Navarro Ruiz) during a routine perimeter survey of Site-90.//\n\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Chung-Ho:** . . . and that one there is \"shelter.\"\n\n**Hatess:** Thank you, agent Chung-Ho, but I have a copy of the glossaries. I'm cataloging what I see. You should be too.\n\n**Ruiz:** [to Chung-Ho] Not getting paid hourly, remember. We got another acre to do. [to Hatess] I hope you're finding Site-90 to your liking, representative.\n\n**Hatess:** Too hot, too wet. Not your fault, though. This is the asset's natural home, correct? They survive best here? Weren't relocated?\n\n**Ruiz:** That's correct. Our terrariums match the Hycranian climate as closely as possible, and SCP-6736 reacts favorably to them.\n\n[Hatess wipes a sheen of rainwater from their jacket. They grimace and shake their hand.]\n\n**Chung-Ho:** Come on, Hatess. They've got rain where you're from, surely.\n\n**Hatess:** [Deadpan] Nope. It rains blood where I come from. Blood and guts. [to Ruiz] Suppose there's not a . . . drier population, is there?\n\n**Ruiz:** Not anymore. During the 20th century they reached as far as the Aral Sea. Their habitat is a fraction of what it once was. Or so the director tells me.\n\n**Hatess:** I'm not interested in the Aral Sea, mister Ruiz, I'm interested in the lizards.\n\n**Chung-Ho:** [Interjecting] Amphibians, ma'am.\n\n**Hatess:** The Committee handles taxonomies, dear. Lizards are lizards.\n\n[Hatess turns to agent Chung-Ho and bares their teeth, peeling back the skin of their jaw to reveal their molars.]\n\n**Hatess:** And I'm not a //ma'am//.\n\n[The team continues in silence. Agent Chung-Ho refuses to speak for the remainder of the survey.]\n\n[Hatess stops as the team reaches a clearing. They inspect the tree line, then turn to agent Ruiz.]\n\n**Hatess:** They're here, aren't they? Seven or eight of them.\n\n**Ruiz:** Uh . . .\n\n[Ruiz checks his tablet. Seven members of SCP-6736 are detectable in the clearing.]\n\n**Ruiz:** . . . seven, yes. Are you able to see them, representative Hatess?\n\n**Hatess:** Smell.

Roll call.\n\n[SCP-6736-044 (\"Dudley\") approaches Hatess. He sits up on his hind legs, waving a stick with his forelimbs.

I assume age correlates positively with intelligence?\n\n**Hammond:** Edna has been living at Site-90 since 1988. Juveniles fully mature after about four years or so, so at her youngest she would have been around 32. But other specimens of similar age ranges demonstrate much lower intelligence, at least in regards to speech and mathematics. We speculate she's much older than that. Possibly 40 or 50.\n\n[Hatess studies Hammond's notes. They sort a series of glyphs and write them out on a piece of paper.]\n\n**Hatess:** And the \"Cathay\" glyphs are reserved for elders . . .\n\n[Hatess passes the paper to Edna.]\n\n**Hatess:** Got something to tell me, Edna?\n\n[Edna slaps the table repeatedly with her hands, then pushes the paper away.]\n\n**Edna:** @@..- -. -.- .. -. -.. / - --- / .- ... -.- / .- / .-.. .- -.. -.-- / .... . .-. / .- --. .@@\n//UNKIND TO ASK A LADY HER AGE//\n\n[Hatess chuckles.]\n\n**Hatess:** [to Hammond] You said they can change the power of these things.\n\n**Hammond:** At the behest of a leader, yes. We believe that the power is tied to their collective belief rather than the symbols themselves. The symbols' strength is a //consequence// of that change, rather than the //cause// of it, if you follow.\n\n**Hatess:** So not as easy as writing our own, then.\n\n**Hammond:** I suppose you could, with control of an elder to relegate such things. But most of their actions are instinctual. They just create glyphs as they work. It's . . . not quite spontaneous, but very few of them create with discernable purpose. It's possible that influencing their emotional state would achieve what you're talking about.\n\n**Hatess:** Hm. [To Edna] If you're done, little lady, I think we have a prior engagement.
