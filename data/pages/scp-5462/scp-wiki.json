Foundation assets in art institutions and auction houses have been placed on alert for a Goya painting matching SCP-5462-B's effects.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5462-A is the journal of Spanish painter Francisco Goya, detailing an anomalous event that resulted in the creation of 15 oil paintings painted between 1819 and 1822  commonly referred to as his Black Paintings due to their emotionally disturbing contents, themes, and use of dark colours.\n\nThe paintings were painted onto the walls of his villa in his country estate on the outskirts of Madrid, nicknamed the Quinta del Sordo (house of the deaf man)[[footnote]]Named after a previous deaf inhabitant, and not after Goya, contrary to popular belief.[[/footnote]]. While all 14 paintings at the Prado Museum in Madrid have been confirmed as non-anomalous, the journal describes a 15th unconfirmed painting[[footnote]]While most scholars point to //Heads in a landscape// as the 15th Black Painting, an examination by Foundation archivists reveals it was not painted in the same period as the others.[[/footnote]], designated SCP-5462-B, that has been described as having significant anomalous properties.\n\nThe status of SCP-5462-B is unknown.\n------\n\n**Addendum 5462.1:** Truncated Biography of Francisco Goya\n\nFrancisco Goya (30 March 1746 – 16 April 1828) has been considered as one of the most popular Spanish painters of his time. Born to a lower-class family in Aragon, he was interested in art from an early age. Goya studied under Spanish Baroque painter Jose Luzan at the age of 14, copying stamps for 4 years. He would eventually grow tired of this, moving to Madrid to study under Anton Raphael Mengs, and then later to Rome, which was considered the cultural capital of the world at the time.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=goya|\n    caption=Francisco Goya, two years before his death in 1828. (by Vicente López Portaña)\n]]\n\nHis career only seemed to grow at this point, receiving awards, royal commissions, and an appointment to a position as a member of the Royal Academy of Fine Art. Goya's career appeared to reach new heights when he was commissioned to paint the portrait of the Count of Floridablanca in 1783, becoming introduced to the royal court. Only three years later, Goya would become a painter in service to King Charles III, later becoming the First Court Painter under Charles IV.\n\nSomewhere between 1792 and 1793, Goya fell prey to an illness that left him deaf. He grew more withdrawn and insular, with his works shifting to a darker tone, such as his //Caprichos// prints, which he described as \"the innumerable foibles and follies to be found in any civilized society, and from the common prejudices and deceitful practices which custom, ignorance, or self-interest have made usual.\" Goya complained of loud noises within his head, as well as poor vision and balance. Historians have speculated on the cause of the illness, with most suspecting a case of Ménière's disease, or lead poisoning resulting from a lifetime of creating his own paints.\n\nThe invasion of Spain by France in 1808, and the death of his wife in 1812, did little to alleviate his mood. Once one of the most famous painters of his time, Goya retreated to a life of solitude in the Madrid countryside (possibly due in part to fear of political reprisals), where he created his infamous Black Paintings.\n\n------\n\nIn 2004, the Foundation came into the possession of Goya's journal, detailing a series of events that had occurred at Quinta del Sordo. The journal had been sold at a Marshall, Carter, and Dark auction as the recollection of Goya's \"brush with the anomalous,\" initially appraised at 1,000,000 euros. Several high bids from unidentified members of the audience drew attention, leading the embedded Foundation plant to purchase the journal for 3,000,000 euros.\n\n**Addendum 5462.2:** SCP-5462-A excerpts\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : dashed 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n//I dreamed that I was young.//\n\n//I was on the road to Rome.
