As the oldest Site located within the boundaries of Poland, Site-120 is the primary unit of action during Poland-related activities and the main observation point for the [[[locations-of-interest|Free Port]]] of [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]].\n\n**Founded:** 02/05/1916\n\n**Location:** Abandoned industrial complex of Częstochowa, Poland\n\n**Founding Director:** Hannah Rivera / Raia Micheals\n\n**Cover Story:** Renovation and safe demolishing of abandoned industrial complexes within near proximity, radioactive waste disposal, cleaning of radioactively polluted areas of the Warta River nearby\n\n**Size:** Aboveground Area of 34 km^^2^^\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Site Overview\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n//Researching Realities / Fighting Fire With Fire / Belief is Key//\n[[/=]]\n\nAs one of the few Sites built almost entirely near anomalous spaces and not using D-Class personnel whatsoever, Site-120 is a rather odd Site when compared to the rest of the facilities operated by the Foundation. Initially built as a provisional outpost within SCP-5292 (at that time known as PL-X0R38/0124) for the [[[historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego|Polish Containment Project]]], Site-120 quickly became a larger facility with the anomaly it was supposed to monitor actively becoming a part of the entire building.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:carousel\n| images=ontologo2.png,ontologonew2.png,120.png\n| caption=Site-120's logo evolution over time: 1916,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]][[size 125%]]The original Department of Ontokinetics logo, created by [https://www.wikidot.com/user:info/jakob17 Dr. Jakob], later adopted as Site-120's logo.[[/size]][[/span]] 1959,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]][[size 125%]]Re-designed by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/desk-of-junior-designer-s-yvonne Junior Designer S.

Though this \"fighting fire with fire\" -- fire being here thaumaturgy, reality-bending, and anomalies -- has been initially looked down upon by the entire Foundation -- even following the implementation of [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Directive Alpha/1911]]] -- following the grand success of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43|Site-43]]]'s [[[on-guard-43-hub|implementation of esoteric containment and classes into its containment plans]]], the dislike for Site-120's system has visibly decreased.\n\nBeing the hub for the entire Department of Ontokinetics, Site-120 is one of the few Sites that treat ontokinetics, thaumaturgy, and theology as real sciences with set rules, and not just anomalous influence. This approach, though dangerous at times -- with the most well-known incident being the unfortunate loss of Dr. Scranton, one of the lead ontokinetics researchers at Site-120 within [[[SCP-3001]]] -- has been noted to yield great results. Following Site-120's discovery and creation of numerous anti-ontokinetic and anti-thaumaturgic equipment and technology -- such as the Scranton Reality Anchors and Asheworth-Rivera Conduits and the [[[SCP-6172|entirety of the modern multiverse theory]]] -- numerous other Foundation departments are less than shy about using them.\n\nSite-120's overall research has proven itself to be extremely useful to the Foundation at large -- after years of non-stop studying and translating of SCP-5292-1 instances, Site-120 came to possess the most extensive physical and digital library of information concerning everything it researches, with the amount of information concerning its three main specialties being a particular point of pride. In fact, over its numerous operation years, this database became so large that it needed to be digitized, with a necessity for a special digital keeper to look over, catalog, and further study all such files -- this task is accomplished by [[[SCP-6079|Ra.aic]]], Site-120's primary [[[aiad-homescreen|Artificially Intelligent Conscript]]].\n\n\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[f>image ra.png width=\"125px\"]]\n\n**Designation:** Ra.aic (\"Ra\")\n\n**Classification:** Class-IV Positive-Aligned General Intelligence, ver1.2.1, Gen(II), Clearance Level 3\n\n**Description:** Developed in 1988 by a collaboration between the Departments of Ontokinetics and the Artificial Intelligence Applications Division, Ra.aic focuses on sorting and analyzing all knowledge regarding deities possessed by Site-120 for further research as well as on the general maintenance of its digital space. Named after one of the founders of the Site, Raia Micheals.\n\n[[/div]]\n----\n[[=]]\n++++ //Beyond Science, Towards Understanding//\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n\"Esterberg,\" \"Tysiąclecie Górne,\" \"Częstochowa's Free Port\" -- many names were given to FP-120, the anomalous city under Site-120's watching eye. Built entirely within a pocket dimension parallel to the city of Częstochowa, Esterberg is the main hub for all anomalous races and activities within the region, acting as a safe space without the danger of Foundation interference.\n\nDue to numerous trust issues mainly caused by ideological differences and unpleasant prior interactions the Foundation-Esterberg relationship is most of the time less than ideal. Site-120's secondary objective is to fix this divide, as diplomatically as possible. To achieve this, the Foundation has been forced to cooperate with numerous [[[Groups of Interest]]] in the past. Though initially widely regarded as a bad idea, following the satisfying results given by the [[[the-gulf|SUSEOCT]]] and [[[the-holiday-special|Site-59 festivity initiatives]]] as well as the successful Foundation-GoI-571-20 cooperation that occurred during SCP-PL-252's discovery, the Foundation-Esterberg cooperation plans have started to receive more and more funding with each year of activity, with continually improving results.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Anomalies Under the Jurisdiction of Site-120\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"table4\"]]\n||~ ID Number||~ Object Class||\n||[[[ralliston-s-proposal|SCP-001]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-PL-054]]]||Safe||\n||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-213 SCP-PL-213]||Pending||\n||[http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-252 SCP-PL-252]||Skótos||\n||[[[SCP-PL-253]]]||Keter/Tiamat||\n||[[[SCP-PL-259]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-PL-273]]]||Argus/Conscientia||\n||[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-284 SCP-PL-284]||Archon||\n||[http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/scp-pl-369 SCP-PL-369]||Yesod||\n||[[[SCP-PL-399]]]||Neutralized||\n||[[[SCP-643]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-3001]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-3963]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-4845]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-5292]]]||Yesod||\n||[[[SCP-5314]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-5327]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-5373]]]||Gödel||\n||[[[SCP-5464]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-5484]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-5572]]]||Terminal||\n||[[[SCP-5659]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-5672]]]||N/A||\n||[[[SCP-5795]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-5815]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-5890]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-5936]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-6072]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-6079]]]||Pending||\n||[[[SCP-6099]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-6120]]]||Eparch||\n||[[[SCP-6172]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-6198]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-6471]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-6483]]]||Integrated||\n||[[[SCP-6596]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-6625]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-6651]]]||Draugr||\n||[[[SCP-6672]]]||Argus||\n||[[[SCP-6744]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-6747]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-6772]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-6936]]]||Embla||\n||[[[SCP-7102]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-7120]]]||Memet||\n||[[[SCP-7272]]]||Keter||\n||[[[SCP-7278]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-7600]]]||Archon||\n||[[[SCP-7629]]]||Thaumiel||\n||[[[SCP-7672]]]||Pending||\n||[[[SCP-7924]]]||Neutralized||\n||[[[SCP-7999]]]||Integrated||\n||[[[SCP-8007]]]||Euclid||\n||[[[SCP-8008]]]||Safe/Enochian||\n||[[[SCP-8120]]]||Safe||\n||[[[SCP-8280]]]||Keter||\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Site Layout\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ Aboveground\n[[/=]]\n\nThough not as impressive as the rest of the facility, Site-120's aboveground area is still a sight to behold -- transformed from an uninhabitable space left by the rapid industrialization of Częstochowa's nearby areas in the 19th century, it is now mainly occupied by an industrial complex seemingly bleeding into the newly planted green around. With a park, couple of animal habitats for animal anomalies the Site contains, riverbanks, and a small port located nearby, with each day the once toxic wasteland that was the area around Site-120 is being eliminated, giving into the newly found nature.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Level 1\n[[/=]]\n\nThe first and largest floor of Site-120 is where the day-to-day life happens; filled entirely with staff offices, RAISA archives, recreational areas, and the Site's cafeteria. Almost no anomalies are contained within this area -- with the only exception to this rule being a large portion of Site-120's staff.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Level 2\n[[/=]]\n\nThe second floor is where the actual research and containment happen. With highly equipped laboratories and research areas, containment cells -- even if a rarity -- and servers overlooked by Ra.aic, Level 2 is the main workspace for the entirety of the Site.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Level 3\n[[/=]]\n\nBeing entirely occupied by SCP-5292 and the library it offers, Level 3 is a relatively strange space -- occupied by both translation offices led by Dr. Alistair Vemhoff and reading areas available to all staff for free access, the dimly-lit halls of Site-120's Grand Library are never devoid of life.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Level 4\n[[/=]]\n\nLocated underneath a reinforced barrier dividing the maintenance spaces of Site-120 and SCP-5292, Level 4 houses most of the electrical apparatus that keeps the Site running. Being a maze filled with numerous dark hallways and long corridors, the technical space is one of the more interesting places Site-120 has to offer -- especially its plumbing system, with a sewage cleaning apparatus releasing purified water directly into the waters of Warta, which was built relatively early in the Site's development and thus remains a place filled with much weirdness -- sometimes more literally than one would expect.\n\n[[=]]\n+++ Level 5\n[[/=]]\n\nOnly available to Clearance Level 4+ personnel, Level 5 is by far the most ominous and secretive place within Site-120. With a Deepwell Archive and a small area acting as a total exclusionary zone, it is the final front of defense for personnel and information likewise. The whole floor acts as a gigantic ritual site, artificially created to allow for the activation of the Site's final failsafe, should the situation become desperate enough -- a monumental thaumaturgic rite that, when performed correctly, allows for the [[[nima-king-of-the-desert|teleportation of the entire building to a select few locations in the world]]].\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Staffing Information\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Aboveground Personnel\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Description:** Maintaining the Veil and protecting the secrecy of all of Site-120, Aboveground Personnel keep the aboveground structures working to maintain the illusion of normalcy.\n\n**№ of Members:** 41\n\n**Leader:** Mirosław Górski\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Site Director Council\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Description:** Due to the lack of an appropriate candidate following the [[[SCP-5936|death of Site Director Dr. MacCarthy on 28/03/1984]]], and the number of complex divisions working within Site-120, it was decided by Overseer order that rather than a single individual ruling over the Site, a five-person council is to be in charge of this duty, with the following division of responsibilities:\n\n* **General Project Overseer and Department Director:** Dr. Magdaleine Cornwell\n\n* **Human Resources and Personnel Satisfaction Lead:** Dr. Jessie Rivera\n\n* **Grand Thaumist and Thaumaturgical Archivist:** Dr. Daniel Asheworth\n\n* **Theology Division Chief and Theological Projects Overseer:** Dr. Ethan MacCarthy Junior \n\n* **Ontokinetics and Spatial Disruptions Chief:** Dr. James Micheals\n\n**№ of Members:** 5\n\n**Leader(s):** Dr. Magdaleine Cornwell, Dr. Jessie Rivera, Dr. Daniel Asheworth, Dr. James Micheals, Dr. Ethan MacCarthy Junior,\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Research Team\n[[/=]]\n-----\n**Description:** The main research organ for Site-120, focused on furthering the knowledge of anomalous sciences and objects within its custody.\n\n**№ of Members:** 163\n\n**Leader:** --[[[SCP-3001|Dr. Robert Scranton and Dr. Anna Lang]]]-- Dr. Mark Kaufmann[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Of the [[[SCP-1483|Third Empire]]], employed by the Foundation as one of the personnel given to it by [[[antarctic-exchange-hub|the Exchange]]].
