Host: **##65d366|DChance##**//\n\n-----\n\n**##65d366|DChance:##** Hello everyone. I've made this chatroom for the purposes of discussing SCP-6664.\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** Who are you?\n**##65d366|DChance:##** I'm Researcher Chance, I work at 103.\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** Never heard of you.\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** yeah one of you edited my report and now the page is locked. good going\n**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** I could say the same.\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** here's the solution: you're all wrong, i can see the greenhouse from my office and SCP-6664 is right there\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** Well, I pass by SCP-6664 every time I visit HR, and it is not fun. There's no way it's at 86.\n**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** Alright. Clearly all of us think we're correct. And we all probably are. Why don't we just give a different designation to each anomaly and call it a day.\n**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** This is a good solution.\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** yeah why did this happen in the first place\n**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** I'm pretty sure what caused this is a technical issue. I thought the slot was unallotted when I wrote my report.\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** Me too.\n**##65d366|DChance:##** Well, we can't just do that.\n**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** Do what? Give each tree a different slot?\n**##65d366|DChance:##** Yes! This is a major problem! All of these anomalies //happened// to be chosen for the same slot? Something must be at play here.\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** not... necessarily\n**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** Chance, there are much more logical explanations.\n**##65d366|DChance:##** Really? You've been perverting nature with your research, and now nature is perverting your research back! And none of you care?\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** It's really not that big of a deal, man. I can find a new slot.\n**##65d366|DChance:##** You're not even going to try to find out what happened? Isn't that what you do?\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** chance are you ok\n**##65d366|DChance:##** How can I be, when this calamity is happening before my very eyes?\n**##6a6a6a|HBlank:##** I already finished replacing all the numbers in my report.\n**##65d366|DChance:##** So none of you care?\n**##7c46a4|ELongcastle:##** I don't see a reason why we would.\n**##65d366|DChance:##** Then what was even the point in doing any of this? I tried to show you! To show you that the anomalous can wreck your research as much as your research wrecks it! And it was all for nothing? Then why am I even still here?\n**##65d366|DChance:##** No. I know why.\n[[=]]\n//**##65d366|DChance##** has left.//\n[[/=]]\n**##ff5947|EKing:##** So that.. happened.\n**##e1a956|CWendover:##** [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6664/offset/6| yeah i think we got our guy]]]\n[[/div]]",
