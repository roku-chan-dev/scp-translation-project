SCP-3743-A-1 is a thaumaturgically powered portal[[footnote]]Colloquially called [[[serpent-s-hand-hub | Ways]]], these primarily serve as entrances to the Wanderer's Library, but have been known to open to other anomalous locations as well.[[/footnote]] to an extradimensional space found within the greater Yorkshire area.  SCP-3743-A-1 is located in a wooded area approximately two kilometers from Site-91’s perimeter.  SCP-3743-A-1 is constructed with branches from the immediate area and thaumaturgically linked to an icon of Eros found hanging nearby.  \n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=ruins|\n    caption=Single structure found within SCP-3743-B.\n    |width: 600px\n]]\nSCP-3743-B is a finite extra-dimensional space resembling the arid plains of Greece, measuring roughly eighty-eight square kilometers.  Located within the boundaries of SCP-3743-B is a solitary man-made structure constructed from mud bricks, sitting atop a stone block foundation.  The structure resembles the construction methods of the Hellenistic-era of ancient Greece.  Due to thaumic pollution and relatively high levels of Akiva radiation present within SCP-3743-B, photographs invariably develop without any color present.\n\nSCP-3743-A-1, when activated, using thaumaturgical techniques common to Group of Interest ALPHA-019 (“Serpent’s Hand”), allows for transportation to SCP-3743-B.\n-----\n**__Discovery__**: Routine reconnaissance around Site-91 by security personnel revealed SCP-3743-A-1 on 13 August, 1992.  Members of MTF-Beta-777 examined the area and found the aforementioned icon to Eros.  Concerned that the anomaly represented an attempted incursion into Site-91, Captain Zadeh of MTF-Beta-777 requested reinforcement from MTF-Tau-9 (“Bookworms”) as said MTF focuses on anomalies related to the Library and the Serpent’s Hand.  \n\nLieutenant Gilroy Laguerre[[footnote]]Thaumatologist specializing in studying and disarming Ways.[[/footnote]] of Tau-9 analyzed SCP-3743-A-1 and confirmed that it was an active Way leading to an extradimensional space.  The proximity of the Way to Site-91 was ruled to be a clear and present danger.  On 15 August, 1992, Director Varga ordered an joint task force exploration into SCP-3743-A-1.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▷ Exploration log of SCP-3743-B 15/08/1992\" hide=\"Close File\"]]\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/logo width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\" align=left]]\n\n **__Exploration Log of SCP-3743-B by joint task force from MTF-Beta-777 and MTF-Tau-9__**.\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=eros|\n    caption=Thaumaturgically active icon linked to SCP-3743-A-1, found hanging nearby.\n    |width: 600px\n]]\n**Personnel Mobilized**:  \n//Captain Sahara Zadeh//, \n//Sergeant Maria Waltham//,[[footnote]]Both Zadeh and Waltham are Class-A thaumatologists.[[/footnote]] \n//Sergeant Gabriel Merced//, \n//Lieutenant Gilroy Laguerre//, \n//Sergeant Mark Kenoshi//.  \nAccompanied by //Agent Rebekah Douglas, Level-3 psychometrist.//[[footnote]]Perceptional ability to experience associations, images and other sensory information by tangibly manipulating an object of unknown history.

The pain seems less like immediate trauma and more like a disability? Like it’s a constant and persistent pain. Pain that colors your perception over the long term.\n\n**Rossi**: How can you tell?\n\n**Douglas**: //[snorts]// Look, I know you’re new to the Site.

There's script engraved into the outer edge of the ring.\n\n**Kenoshi**: It’s Old Attic, an Ancient Greek dialect in use in and around the Athens area until late fifth century BCE.\n\n**Rossi**: Can any of you read it?\n\n**Kenoshi**: I can, mostly. It’s a repetition of a single two-sentence phrase.\n\n**Rossi**: What does it say?\n\n**Kenoshi**: This is rough, but it says: “Behold the land of the Hundred Handed.  Here there be Titans.”\n\n**Douglas**: Ominous.\n\n**Rossi**: Agent Douglas, do you think this is connected to GoI-8832?[[footnote]]The Second Haptic Assembly.[[/footnote]]\n\n//Almost sixty seconds of silence.//\n\n**Douglas**: Hard to say for sure.

Anything else of note?\n\n**Merced**: There’s a boundary here. The plain we can see is only a few dozen kilometers before a wall of mist or fog impedes all view.\n\n**Rossi**: Right well, try to take notes of anything distinctive.\n\n**Zadeh**: Alright, let’s head out. Keep your eyes peeled for anything moving.\n\n//Extraneous thirty minutes of audio omitted.//\n\n**Zadeh**: Coming up on structure of some sort, Command.\n\n**Rossi**: Describe it?\n\n**Zadeh**: Still a half click out, but it looks white and multiple stories.\n\n**Rossi**: Proceed.\n\n//Extraneous ten minutes of audio omitted.//\n\n**Kenoshi**: We’re closer now, Command. Looks like it’s whitewashed mud bricks. Three stories, lots of curves. Almost looks like an ant hill. Lots of doors, and a few stone staircases on the exterior.\n\n**Rossi**: Still no contact with any people?\n\n**Douglas**: None.  It’s eerily quiet. Not even any wind. The bell is louder though.\n\n**Zadeh**: Okay, we’re going to breach. Kenoshi and Douglas with me on the right side of the first floor. Laguerre, Merced and Waltham on the left. Stay in contact. Let’s go.\n\n//Extraneous three minutes of audio omitted.//\n\n**Zadeh**: Command, the structure appears empty. At least over here. Laguerre, anything?\n\n**Laguerre**: It’s clearly been lived in. Wood stove and sleeping bags. The stove is still warm. Negative contact though.\n\n**Zadeh**: Same here.  Let’s clear the other floors before we start looking around.\n\n//Extraneous seventeen minutes of audio omitted.  MTF members clear the structure and find none of the occupants.  Items found included over twenty sleeping bags, three portable wooden stoves, cooking supplies, some electric lights on extension cords plugged into anomalous power sources, and a small library of scrolls.//\n\n**Rossi**: When you say “anomalous” power source, what do you mean?\n\n**Merced**: Looks organic, like polyps on coral, all built one on the other.  There’s at least eight of them, and the plugs for the stringed lighting are plugged directly into an organic “socket.”  They each stand maybe a meter in height.\n\n**Rossi**: Can you take one back with you?\n\n**Zadeh**: Let’s belay that, for now.  No sense letting the locals know someone is messing with their house while they’re away.\n\n**Douglas**: Kenoshi, you said you read Greek right?\n\n**Kenoshi**: Yeah, I'm proficient but not an expert.  Why do you ask?\n\n**Douglas**: The scrolls I've seen are all covered in the same script as the bronze ring when we entered this place.   Second floor, towards the front of the building on the right.  Come take a look?\n\n**Kenoshi**:  Just a mo.\n\n//Extraneous five minutes of audio omitted.//\n\n**Zadeh**: Found the bell.  It's in the upper most chamber.  It's just ringing constantly.  Command, you can’t hear that?\n\n**Rossi**: Negative, Captain Zadeh.\n\n**Zadeh**: Very fucking weird.  \n\n**Rossi**: Is there a mechanism powering the bell?\n\n**Zadeh**: Well, sort of.  One of those polyp generators is here and it's connected by biological material to a sigil above the bell.  Bell itself is only ten centimeters in height, but it's not typical brass.  Pretty sure this is beryllium bronze.  More sigils etched into its surface.\n\n**Rossi**: Any idea what the purpose is?\n\n**Zadeh**: Could be an alarm we tripped by coming through the Way, or it could be very annoying music.  I have no idea.\n\n**Rossi**: I assume interfering with it would be a bad idea?\n\n**Zadeh**: Given I have no idea what it does, yes, I’d say it’s a bad idea.\n\n//Kenoshi has rendezvoused with Douglas near the scroll library.//\n\n**Kenoshi**: What have you got here?\n\n//Sounds of rustling paper for a few moments.//\n\n**Kenoshi**: Holy shit, these are old.  Wait… they don’t //feel// old though.\n\n**Rossi**: What do you mean?\n\n**Kenoshi**: The parchment seems almost new.  Although I don’t think I've ever handled actual new parchment.  \n\n**Rossi**: Why did you say they were old?\n\n**Kenoshi**: The Greek these are written in, it's contemporaneous with the script on the bronze ring at our entry point.  Why would someone transcribe Ancient Greek so painstakingly onto new parchment?\n\n**Rossi**: Can you read them? \n\n**Kenoshi**: Not easily, I’m going to suggest we take a few so I can study and translate back at base.\n\n**Rossi**: Good idea.  Agent Douglas, were you able to read anything off these scrolls?\n\n**Douglas**: They’ve been handled recently but that’s about it.  \n\n//Extraneous five minutes of audio deleted.//\n\n**Merced**: You’re all going to want to come out here.\n\n**Zadeh**: Out where?\n\n**Merced**: Lieutenant Laguerre and I came around the back of the structure and we found something.\n\n**Zadeh**: What?\n\n**Laguerre**: Better just come and see.  Kenoshi, you too.\n\n**Kenoshi**: Okay, let me store these scrolls in a protective container.  Be right out.\n\n//The six MTF members gather together, presumably behind the building.//\n\n**Douglas**: What is it?\n\n**Zadeh**: A cave of some sort?\n\n**Rossi**:  Please describe what you're seeing.\n\n**Merced**: It’s a hillside, fairly low, behind the structure.  In the hillside is a recession with a large stone block over the entrance.  The opening is man-made, reinforced with small stone blocks.  \n\n**Kenoshi**: More to the point, the large rock over the entrance is a stele.\n\n**Rossi**: A what?\n\n**Kenoshi**: Stone slab, usually upright, with some sort of commemorative relief or a message inscribed.  This has more Ancient Greek, and a lot of it.  \n\n**Rossi**: Can you read it?\n\n**Kenoshi**: Like the scrolls, I would need time to decipher it.  Gonna take some pictures to help translation back at Site.\n\n**Zadeh**:  While he’s doing that, let’s see what’s in this cave.  Douglas, you and Waltham are with me.  Rest of you hang here and watch Kenoshi’s back.\n\n**Merced**: Yes, Captain.\n\n//Thirty seconds of silence as the three presumably enter the recession.//\n\n**Rossi**: See anything?\n\n**Douglas**: Sarcophagi, thirteen of them.  Roughly made but full slabs of stone.  No writing on them whatsoever.  \n\n**Zadeh**: I don’t think anyone has been in here for a long time.  Lots of cobwebs and dust coating every surface.  \n\n**Waltham**: Look at this.\n\n**Rossi**: What is it?\n\n**Zadeh**: Bas relief of some kind carved into the central stone block of the tomb.  Approximately two meters in height and three in length.\n\n**Rossi**: Depicting what?\n\n**Douglas**: Seems to be arms, dozens of them.  They’re thrusting through the earth towards the sky.  They’re wrong, though.\n\n**Rossi**: Wrong how?\n\n**Waltham**: Way more than five fingers, its crudely sculpted but I’d say they have upwards of eight to ten fingers each.  Something in their palms, but the details aren’t clear based on the crudeness of the carving.\n\n//Multiple gunshots are heard from outside the tomb.//\n\n**Zadeh**: Laguerre, what’s going on out there?\n\n**Laguerre**: We’ve got company!\n\n//More gunshots are heard.//\n\n**Zadeh**: Outside, now!\n\n//Gunshots continue to sound on the recording.//\n\n**Laguerre**: Fuck, where are they even coming from?\n\n**Rossi**: What’s happening, Captain?\n\n**Zadeh**: Command, I don’t have time to explain!\n\n//Gunshots from multiple firearms drown out all other sound.//\n\n**Douglas**: Jesus, there’s ten of them! What the fuck are those things!\n\n**Kenoshi**: No idea, but they’re flying all over the place.  Started launching arrows at us, but some of them have swords of some kind.\n\n**Zadeh**: Group your shots, they’re moving too fast!\n\n**Douglas**: No effect!\n\n**Waltham**: How do you know? I can’t tell if I’ve hit any!\n\n**Merced**: I’ve hit three, they’re wounded but not out.  Also, there aren’t ten of them, there’s thirteen.\n\n**Douglas**: Fuck, you don’t think….?\n\n**Zadeh**: Okay, calling the retreat.  We’re getting the fuck out of here.\n\n//The next fifteen minutes are full of sounds of exertion and the occasional gunshot.
