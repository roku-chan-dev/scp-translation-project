When I first got onto the site, I thought big. Large conspiracies, historical events, you name it. But then after failing for so long it hit me: I shouldn’t strive that big on my first try, I should try something simpler. So I used a format from one of my favorite GoIs to write a story detailing a relationship of another favorite thing of mine: Anti-memes.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFor more content from me, check out my [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/greengolem-s-author-page Author Page]!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\n[[size 1.75em]][[span style=\"-webkit-text-stroke-width: 1px; -webkit-text-stroke-color: white; -moz-text-stroke-width: 1px; -moz-text-stroke-color: white;\"]]Hello, my name is Phoebe![[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n//Phoebe playing around in her Enclosure//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nGet To Know Me!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\nI’m looking for a loving home in whichever family is willing to take me in!\n\nThe folks here at Wilson’s aren’t sure what I am.

I just don’t want you to go.\n* I don’t feel good when you spray weed killers, insecticides, and pesticides in my room. The chemicals hurt me!\n* If you bring me plants and flowers, I won't reject them! Their presence doesn't cause me anxiety.

Hello world!\n\n**Date: 8/17/2016**\nI finished my orientation here. I got assigned to take care of whatever critter ends up in Enclosure 45. I can't wait!\n\n**Date: 8/19/2016**\nA certain critter got assigned to Enclosure 45. I can't quite remember being told anything about the critter. Am I really getting that old?\n\n**Date: 8/20/2016**\nI went in and still can't remember anything about the critter. I'll try again.\n\nNope, still nothing. I'll send an email over to Mr. Wilson and see if he can tell me anything.\n\n**Date: 8/21/2016**\nMr. Wilson just sent me an email saying there wasn't any critter assigned to Enclosure 45. But I swear on my reputation there was something assigned there! Or maybe this has to do with what it is. They went through something like this during orientation. What was it called... \"Anti-mom\"? That thing that makes people not remember them or something. Whatever it was, It's my duty to look into this further.\n\n**Date: 9/5/2016**\nIt's been awhile since my last update. I keep going into the enclosure and forgetting about what the little critter is. Makes it hard to have a critter profile, don'tcha think? But I'm certain that this critter exists. I just gotta think outside of the box.\n\n**Date: 9/25/2016**\nAfter awhile, I've got it! I keep forgetting what the little critter is, but I can remember what it isn't! See? Those labcoats got nothing on me!\n\n**Date: 10/1/2016**\nI let a squirrel into the enclosure to see how our critter interacted with other littler critters.  I ended up finding the squirrel huddled on top of a tree with some claw marks below. Note to self: Do not let another critter in with them anymore!\n\n[[=image Tree size=\"small\"]]\n\n**Date: 10/2/2016**\nI've been feeding the critter frogs and earthworms as its meals for awhile now. But I'm not sure whether that's the best meal for the little guy. I put out a steak, some chicken, some fruits and veggies, and its usual meal. I'm curious to see what it eats (Or rather, what it doesn't?)\n\n**Date: 10/3/2016**\nIt ended up not eating the frogs, earthworms, or the fruits and veggies. I'll go to the store and get some more stuff for the critter. I'm making progress!\n\n**Date: 10/20/2016**\nI tried redecorating the enclosure several times with a variety of different environments to see how well they would do with each one. They seem to dislike desert environments alongside urban and suburban ones.\n\n**Date: 10/25/2016**\nAlrighty, I'm writing this while I'm sitting in the enclosure. For the time being, I know what they are, but I can't write down much about it due to the fact that I would just forget it later. I'm just sitting here playing around with them for the time being.\n\n**Date: 10/28/2016**\nI brought them some flowers. I had no idea what kind of flowers they like, so I brought the ones I normally love. I think she probably liked it.\n\n**Date: 11/2/2016**\nI know it likely isn’t much of anything, but I’ve been having bad dreams quite a lot now since I joined. I’ll still make it through though, I don’t plan on quitting the WWS!\n\n**Date: 11/15/2016**\nHello again, notepad. Been awhile. It's been harder to get around, so I haven't been able to make much progress. Guess that's the negative of being an old man like me, huh? Anyways, I've gotten some toys for our little friend. I played around in the enclosure for awhile. I don't know what happened, but I know that it made me happy.\n\n**Date: 11/17/2016**\nI did some thinking. I've decided to name the critter. I decided... Phoebe. I've always wanted a girl, but with me being too old for any orphanage to accept me, I haven't been able to adopt one. Anyways, enough about me. I'm going to go see if I can get a nameplate printed out for the enclosure.\n\n**Date: 11/25/2016**\nI've decided to let Phoebe out of her enclosure for a short while. It seems Phoebe was quite kind, and didn't cause much damage! But she ended up knocking over my morning coffee. What a silly girl, huh?\n\n[[=image Coffee size=\"small\"]]\n\n**Date: 12/15/2016**\nApologies for such a late note. I've been really busy now, and it's becoming more difficult for me to get around. But I've decided that I should likely start spending more time with Phoebe, before I become unable to do so. I'll keep you updated.\n\n**Date: 12/17/2016**\nI let Phoebe out of the enclosure once more. A couple people around the area met her. They enjoyed their time with each other, but yet again nobody knows about Phoebe after I asked again a little while later. At least this confirms my theory about it being an anti-cream.\n\n**Date: 12/20/2016**\nA bit of chest pains here and there. Painful, but I don’t plan on leaving Phoebe alone in her enclosure.\n\n**Date: 12/25/2016**\nMerry Christmas to us! I bought a couple of toys for Phoebe as a present for being so good.\n\n**Date: 12/28/2016**\nSomeone just tried to clean out Phoebe's enclosure. I had to rush in to make sure it didn't happen. That could've been bad!\n\n**Date: 12/31/2016 - 1/1/2017**\nHappy New Years from us at enclosure 45! I bought some champagne to commemorate the occasion. I hate champagne, but it makes it feel all new-yearsy!\n\n**Date: 1/16/2017**\nI'm going to take a one week vacation. I get two weeks a year for vacationing, so I decided I might as well use one of them now. I'll make sure to spend time with Phoebe along the way.\n\n**Date: 1/19/2017**\nI finished the book I was reading through, and don't have much left to do. I cooked Phoebe a nice ribeye steak and am going to take it to her, if I remember it then I’ll make sure to write it down.\n\n**Date: 1/23/2017**\nI had quite a fun time over my vacation! I may have taken Phoebe out a few times after last note. I put a picture of me and her sitting at a park bench below!\n\n[[=image OldMan.jpg size=\"small\"]]\n\n**Date: 1/25/2017**\nI'm not sure if I am feeling well. I think I'll stay home today.\n\n> Barney Dwyer has gotten quite sick, and is now currently hospitalized. I will be writing things down and taking actions on his behalf while he is there.. All the folks here at WWS hope he gets better!\n> - Fae\n\n**Date: 1/30/2017**\nI hope Phoebe is doing well without me.\n\n> At this point Barney requested I print out adoption posters for a critter named Phoebe. I found the file for the posters he printed out, and distributed them. I'm not sure if that is what is supposed to happen (I didn't even know there was a critter named Phoebe!), but I think the one in charge of their enclosure probably knows best.\n> ~ Fae\n\n**Date: 2/7/2017**\nEveryone forgets about Phoebe at one point or another. Do... you think that she will remember me?\n\n> Barney told me to print out adoption posters for a critter named Phoebe. He made it sound like I've already done it at some point in the past, but I didn't even know we had a critter named Phoebe (Crazy, considering I'm supposed to know about every single critter we have)! I'll hand the posters out anyways, considering the one in charge of the enclosure probably knows more than someone who didn't even know they existed.\n> ~ Fae\n\n**Date: 2/10/2017**\nI don't know what Phoebe is. But what I do know is that she makes me happier than anything. She is the child I never had. I never knew I would grow so attached when I joined this preserve but... You know, I hope somebody picks up Phoebe. She deserves better.\n\n> Barney passed away at 2/15/2017 at 2:43 A.M. We at Wilsons Wildlife Solutions send our condolences. The enclosures Barney was in charge of (Currently only Enclosure 45) will be held by me until I decide what to do with them.\n> ~ Fae\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowynn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Anders Wilson\nDate: 2/19/2017\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey Andy,\n\nAfter Barney's passing, I decided to look through the primary enclosure he was to look after.
