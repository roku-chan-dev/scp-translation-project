Interaction is limited to four hours per day per researcher. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4128-J is a hive mind collective consisting of 3 //levothyroxin// tablets and 3 //cetirizine hydrochloride// tablets. These are currently housed in a mundane pharmaceutical pill bottle. \n\nWhen emptied onto a flat surface, SCP-4128-J is capable of rudimentary visual communication through assisted self-configuration. It displays both an understanding of basic human concepts and a persistent memory of previous communications.  \n\nMore than eight hours' exposure per day may cause memetic effects mimicking mutual affection and interpersonal bonding. Whilst SCP-4128-J is non-hostile, these effects are cumulative and may result in staff divulging unsanitized, sensitive or otherwise inappropriate information. In such cases, standard re-assignment applies.\n\n**Test #15,321** //(Unofficial, unscheduled. Full test protocols not applied).//\n\n* Please Note: Procedure A consists of the researcher waiting five seconds, collecting up the SCP-4128-J instances, putting them into their container, shaking them, then emptying them out into a green receptacle.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Set-up\" hide=\"Set-up\"]]\n//Researcher Gwent shakes SCP-4128-J's bottle, then randomly tips the SCP-4128-J instances into a green receptacle.

Didn't mean to shake you so hard. Hope I didn't wake you... Just came by to say it's Christmas Day. It's Christmas Day and I'm locked up //here.//\n\n//Researcher Gwent performs Procedure A.

I didn't mean to be insensitive; I meant we're //both// locked up here. Sorry - I'm not myself. You may have already heard but I've been reassigned to other duties with immediate effect. They think we're getting too \"pally.\" \n\n//Researcher Gwent performs Procedure A.

It's okay. Nothing I can't handle. It's okay. Really...  Hey can you do me a final favour for old time's sake? Can you do me something cute? A bunny rabbit?\n\n//Researcher Gwent performs Procedure A.

I love rabbits. Or is it KFC Guy? \n\n//Researcher Gwent performs Procedure A.

Just trying to lighten the mood.\nSeeing how it's Christmas Day, and I'm here sitting in a cold white research chamber, whilst everyone else has gone home... maybe something festive?  Maybe Santa?\n\n//Researcher Gwent performs Procedure A. Result: Communication 9.//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Communication 9\" hide=\"Communication 9\"]]\n[[include component:image-block \nname=Santa|caption=Communication 8|width=200px|align=center]]\n\n**Researcher Gwent:** That makes me feel happy and sad at the same time.  Well... I guess that's that. I only popped by to say a final farewell. I probably won't see you again, but I just want you to know it's been a privilege to get to know you. We've had some times together, haven't we? Goodbye, SCP-4128-J. Goodbye.\n\n//Researcher Gwent waits five seconds, collects up the SCP-4128-J instances and puts them back into their container. He appears to be distracted and in a state of sadness. He neglects to secure the container and instead places it onto a coaster. He then proceeds to exit the research chamber after glancing back at SCP-4128-J's container.//\n\n//The following is picked up by motion-sensitive cameras: the chamber door closes and this causes the container to slip off the coaster. The contents spill into the green receptacle. See Final Communication.// \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Final Communication\" hide=\"Final Communication\"]]\n[[include component:image-block \nname=Moneyshot|caption=Final Communication|width=200px|align=center]]\n\n**Dr Gwent**[[footnote]]Dr Gwent is currently cataloging the List of Anomalous Items.[[/footnote]]: //FFS//\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
