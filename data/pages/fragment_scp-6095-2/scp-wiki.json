Following the events of Incident Report 6095-1, SCP-6095 is to be kept in a humanoid containment chamber 11.5km under Site-43, and any interaction between the object and all forms of sentient fauna is prohibited unless absolutely necessary. A singular individual from an SCP-6095-B instance is to remain present within the containment chamber as a means of indirect communication with the object.##\n \n##Blue| When it is necessary to be within 10km of SCP-6095, all personnel are to be amnesticized following interaction. To enable long-distance communication, a video camera with an attached microphone is to be affixed to the wall above the entrance. Sustenance is to be provided to the present SCP-6095-B individual using on-site machinery. Any newly observed anomalous properties are to be taken note of and containment procedures are to be adjusted accordingly.##\n\n**Description:** SCP-6095 is a 2m tall wooden sculpture depicting a humanoid figure of indeterminate sex with physical features of the //cervidae// and //leporidae//[[footnote]]Commonly referred to as deer and rabbits, respectively. [[/footnote]] families. ##Blue| The object exhibits intelligence consistent with //homo sapiens sapiens//, yet remains stationary and does not possess the ability of direct communication.## A command line terminal, henceforth SCP-6095-A, is installed on the back of the object and is fully functional.\n\nTyping \"!help\" into SCP-6095-A and pressing the Enter key presents a list of commands utilized in the operation of the machine, most of which present a use in the modification of various parts of the user's body by unknown processes. Repeated utilization of the object results in outcomes that diverge from the initially desired modification, typically culminating in sections of the user's body converting into various types of naturally-occuring inorganic matter and plantlife.[[footnote]] Examples of materials created by SCP-6095-A include soil, foliage, gravel, and various types of moss. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6095 is capable of reacting to the operation of SCP-6095-A, frequently discharging an fluid visually similar to water from its eyes despite the apparent lack of tear ducts carved into the object. This effect is most commonly observed when used for the purpose of body modification, and often results in the user seeking to appease the object. This may either take the form of the user simply ceasing to use the object or voluntarily utilizing it to convert 100% of their body mass into inorganic material.\n\n##Blue| SCP-6095 is capable of a cognitohazardous effect wherein it partially suppresses the consciousness of sentient fauna within a 10km radius, creating a gestalt consciousness hereby referred to as SCP-6095-B. This effect has been observed to spread at an exponential rate to nearby sentient life. The object typically utilizes human SCP-6095-B individuals for the purpose of communication, and typically disposes of an instance[[footnote]] Refer to Incident Report 6095-1. [[/footnote]] after it finds that it has no practical use. ##\n\nSCP-6095 was recovered from an MC&D warehouse by MTF Mu-3 (\"Highest Bidders\") on 15/08/2006. The object was accompanied by an owner's manual that suggested a history of use dating back to 1994, as well as physical evidence suggesting a history of tampering with the object beforehand. ##Blue| Information gathered from a previous SCP-6095-B instance suggests that the object was modified by MC&D specifically for the purpose of body modification, and that it wasn't capable of this use beforehand.##\n\n**Incident Report 6095-1**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nOn 22/01/2008, a provisional Mobile Task Force was assembled following 16 days of radio silence from Site-19. Upon their arrival, several anomalies had breached containment and several personnel were reported missing. Various flora occupied approximately 67% of hallways and containment chambers on-site. MTF Epsilon-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") was sent in, and 5 days of extensive re-containment efforts followed. \n[[/div]]\nFollowing the incident, an interview was conducted by Dr. Laurence Henry with SCP-6095.\n----\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Interview Log 6095.A\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6095\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Laurence Henry\n\n**Foreword:** SCP-6095 is using a remaining individual of an SCP-6095-B instance to communicate. The interview is being conducted remotely from a distance of 22km.\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Henry:** Good evening, SCP-6095. I would like to ask a few questions following the events of last week. Firstly-\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** What does that number mean?\n\n**Dr. Henry:** It is a designation you have been given for the sake of reference. The number itself doesn't necessarily mean anything significant. \n\n(//Brief pause//)\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** (//sigh//) Make this quick.\n\n**Dr. Henry:** Very good. Firstly, how long have you been capable of advanced intelligence?\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** I think I've been this way for... almost fifteen years, and I don't know how to adapt to this. I still haven't, truthfully. I used to just be a normal animal that lived peacefully without any of these concerns, but... one day I suppose that had to end, and I was grabbed by some men in suits and subjected to a- just, a horrible process that I can't even begin to describe. \n\n**Dr. Henry:** Very interesting. What were your motivations behind the events that transpired last week?\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** You know, for the past 14 years, I've been trying to... understand and adapt to these new thoughts and feelings I've been having, and I haven't had a chance to do that, because all I've known are people who want to use me to fix a superficial feature about themselves, and... (//breath catches//) it hurts. I miss my family. I don't even know half the words coming out of this person's mouth. These are just... the faculties I've found, and I suppose they're relatively effective, but pardon me if I don't understand a question you're asking. Just- what's the next one, please?\n\n**Dr. Henry:** Is this ability of yours something you recently acquired?\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** Things have gotten... no better since I was locked up by you people. It's even worse, I'd argue. Somehow you've found people who are even more vain than I'm used to and for some reason I have had to be exposed to them way more often than I thought I ever could be. The worst part is that I can never do anything about it.\n\n(//Transparent liquid begins to discharge from SCP-6095//)\n\n**SCP-6095-B:** I just want to go back... It's almost like they knew what suffering they were putting me through when they made me look like this, and... I just hate it so much. I want you to go away, so I'll summarize: I'm not sure. I guess I just wanted to be left alone badly enough that I could suddenly make people... cater to that desire. I wanted to be reminded of the landscape I once lived in, so I attempted to be decorative about their disposal.\n\n**Dr. Henry:** That concludes this interview. Thank you for your time.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n**Closing Statement:** SCP-6095 has been deemed self-containing, and is capable of manifesting anomalous properties at will.\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing the interview, Dr. Henry voiced a concern with the ethics of the current containment procedures, instead proposing the relocation of SCP-6095 above ground. This proposal was denied.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Listen, I know the Foundation is currently concerned with reducing the likelihood of this object's acquisition by Marshall, Carter & Dark, but we have to consider the ethical implications of taking what is essentially a human being with thoughts and feelings and spending millions of dollars to dig what is probably the second deepest man-made hole on the planet just to hide it from a rival organization. Can we at least allow it to be in its natural habitat? We could construct a dome that covers the radius of its anomalous effects and stick it in Wyoming where nobody is likely to stumble upon it. It's a much more ethical solution and likely would have been way less expensive if we had gone with it in the first place.//\n\n//-Dr. Laurence Henry//\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
