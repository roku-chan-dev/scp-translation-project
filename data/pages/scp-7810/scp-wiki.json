Personnel handling SCP-7810 are prohibited from reading its contents, except with testing pre-approval. Entities E-7810-01 through -174 are to be contained in habitats containing sufficient terrestial and aquatic ecosystems appropriate for their species. During testing, SCP-7810's 175th chapter is forbidden from being read. Should HK-E-7810-14 be realized, she must be praised immediately. Individuals who summoned HK-E-7810-14 must be relocated to the nearest body of water.\n\n**Description:** As of March 15th, 2028, SCP-7810 is a 175 chapter non-fiction book, published in 1800 CE titled \"Ducks. Ducks? Geese? GEESE! SWANS!?!?\" subtitled \"A Guide to the Featherly Host and How to Survive\". SCP-7810 is credited to Drake M. Gosling[[footnote]] Foundation historians were able to identify 15 Drake M. Goslings and one Ryan Gosling, none of whom can be traced to SCP-7810. [[/footnote]] and published by Mallard Books, a supposed subsidiary of Penguin Books.[[footnote]] Penguin Books was founded in 1935. [[/footnote]] Seventy copies of SCP-7810 have been discovered by the Department of Acquisition and Liquidation as of March 15th 2028 in 58 different major and regional languages and dialects.\n\n174 of SCP-7810's chapters are dedicated to the documentation of all 174 extant species of the bird family Anatidae, referred to frequently as members of 'The Holy Fowl', 'The Featherly Host', and 'The Celestial Feathered Ones'. Descriptions of each species matches baseline physical characteristics, with the exception of height and weight. Behavior, environmental, and psychological descriptions of each species are anomalous. Upon reading a chapter of SCP-7810, the species described within will manifest into baseline reality. These entities are thus labeled as E-7810-01 through 174, with the second number indicating which chapter of SCP-7810 triggered their manifestation.[[footnote]][[span style=\"color:#006603\"]] Doland be praised. [[/span]][[/footnote]] Each recovered instance of SCP-7810 has slight variations to its chapters, theorized to be a result of cultural drift, local folklore, and anomalous circumstances. Additionally, each chapter is written with a different voice and style than the chapter that preceded it.\n\nPartial transcriptions of SCP-7810 do not retain their anomalous properties.\n\nThe final chapter of SCP-7810 contains a passage that ends with a seemingly random number that has decreased since the anomaly was first discovered. In 1958 when first identified, this number was at 42. As of 04/02/2028 it is at 25.\n\nAs of 04/08/2028 SCP-7810 exhibits a low level memetic effect on associated documentation over time, primarily affecting ancillary documentation and image captions. The reasons for this are unknown.[[footnote]][[span style=\"color:#00660C\"]] Doland approved.[[/span]][[/footnote]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Manifestation Log ML-7810-01\" hide=\"Credentials accepted\"]]\n+++ Manifestation Log ML-7810-01\nThe following materials consist of notable E-7810-XXX entities which have been manifested either by accident or during experimental procedures.

When placed on water, E-7810-001 proceeded to float despite being denser than the water it sat on. E-7810-001 was placed in a standard containment habitat for anomalous waterfowl.

Behavior is described as highly aggressive, exemplifying the ability to breathe concentrated cones of fire, lightning, or ice across several editions of SCP-7810.\n**Manifestation:** E-7810-010 was manifested under highly controlled conditions, MTF PSI-32 \"Birds of a Feather\" were on standby to neutralize it should it break free of its containment facilities. E-7810-010 manifested and was noted to be the size of a large dog, and exhibited playful, friendly, and curious behavior. No signs of elemental projectile breath blasts were detected.

Further investigation by MTF PSI-32 “Birds of a Feather” discovered an intact Boeing 747 manifested both inside, and outside of the containment unit, including the control room, fusing with the material of the containment unit walls, surrounding hallways, the control room, and any individuals within the spatial path of the plane. Upon clearing access to the containment unit and cutting through to the interior of the plane, responding agents discovered the plane was filled with E-7810-021 and their droppings.\n\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Salvadori_Teal.jpg|\n    caption=Rendition of a non-anomalous **//Salvadorina waigiuensis**// moments before disappearing into the brush.\n]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Wow_Look_At_That_Duck.png|\n    caption=Dr. Anseriform with E-7810-042 perched on her head.\n]]\n\n**Entity #:** E-7810-042\n**Name:** Salvadori's teal (**//Salvadorina waigiuensis**//) [[footnote]][[span style=\"color:#0045E6\"]]\"And thou whilst never know fear!\" She proclaimed to the flock.[[/span]][[/footnote]]\n**Book Classification:** Angelic Fowl, Doland’s Infiltrator[[footnote]][[span style=\"color:#0522FF\"]]\"For when cataclysm threatens you shall find reprieve!

Dr. Anseriform claimed there was not a duck on their head. All other researchers present confirmed that E-7810-042 was indeed perched on her head. Attempts to remove E-7810-042 resulted in the duck spontaneously returning to its perch after random durations.

Three E-7810-066 entities manifested, along with a round wooden poker table, and 3 empty chairs. Each E-7810-066 entity was wearing checkerboard pattern shirts, formal slacks, 1950’s style blazers hanging off the chairs, and were wearing period appropriate hats. E-7810-066 entities turned and looked at present researchers until all three joined them at the table.

It proceeded to play a number of compositions, with portions of the trumpets sound producing mechanisms moving to accommodate changes in pitch. Despite its trumpet head, all sounds emitted were confirmed to be normal swan vocalizations.\n\n-----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Roman_Goose.jpg|\n    caption=E-7810-102 shortly after doffing it's armor, inquiring about the state of remaining Carthaginian forces.\n]]\n\n**Entity #:** E-7810-105\n**Name:** Roman Goose (**//Anser cygnoides**//) [[footnote]][[span style=\"color:#BA00BD\"]]And they slew and desecrated Her favorite child.

Behaviorally, E-7810-105 is described as being highly disciplined and organized, capable of functionally forming combat units.\n**Manifestation:** E-7810-105 manifestation was catalyzed, whereupon a unit of 100 individuals materialized. All entities manifested wearing Lorica Segmentata, and wielding weapons consistent with those used by Roman Legionaries in the Early Roman Republic. A single individual wearing Centurian Regalia addressed present researchers, asking how far it was to Carthage. When told that Carthage was razed to the ground and the earth salted, the centurion expressed disappointment at missing the opportunity to join.

Illustrations throughout the chapter depict E-7810-112 as possessing feathered hair with a glossy luster.\n**Manifestation:** Manifestation of E-7810-112 resulted in low level reality bending transforming the woodland containment habitat into an Urban Street Alley containing a chainlink fence. E-7810-112 individuals were wearing black leather jackets and white t-shirts. Upon noticing Foundation personnel, the entities began aggressively snapping and walking towards the researchers, pulling out switchblade knives, while singing “You’re the One That I Want” by John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.

It proceeded to eviscerate and remove the remaining researchers’ limbs, before breaching containment. MTF PSI-32 “Birds of a Feather” were deployed, but not before an additional 15 personnel were killed. E-7810-172 could not be subdued with conventional weaponry, and a prototype Omega-15 Atomic Disseminator had to be deployed to neutralize the entity, resulting in severe damage to a quarter of the East Containment Wing of Site-116.\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Black_Swan.jpg|\n    caption=Last image of E-7810-173's manifestation prior to incident I-7810-05. //[[span style=\"color:#B30000\"]]Doland spoke, and she sang, with a voice of the finest swans.

Communications blackout began at 15 minutes after manifestation. Onsite nuclear warhead primed at 20 minutes post manifestation. Site-116 nuclear warhead detonated 30 minutes after manifestation. Recovery and analysis of Site 116’s black box contained a 30 minute recording of increasingly choral chants of “Oh Doland be praised. Oh Doland may she ever approve.
