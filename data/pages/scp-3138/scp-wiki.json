Kaminski; recovered from a 1921 edition of //Great Expectations//.]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3138\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation personnel embedded in literary and academic circles are to be briefed on SCP-3138; they are to report any fictional work discovered to deviate from its canonical number of human corpses.\n\nA Foundation-operated bot (I/O-MANDELA) is to monitor websites and online communities centered on discussions of printed media; discussions regarding books that describe more human corpses than previously expected are to be flagged for review.\n\nUpon discovery, any printed work of fiction suspected of being affected by SCP-3138 is to be recovered and reviewed by MTF Rho-1 (\"The Professors\"). Should it prove feasible, all non-canonical corpses are to be extracted, examined, and catalogued. Otherwise, affected works are to be kept on-site in a secure locker. Access is restricted to Level-4 personnel.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3138 is a phenomenon involving the insertion of human corpses into a printed work of published fiction. The work must convey a narrative capable of recognizably describing the presence of a human corpse.\n\nInserted corpses will be depicted in a manner suited to the work; for example, a corpse inserted into a poem relying upon a particular rhyming scheme will be described via this rhyme scheme. Extraction of inserted corpses can be accomplished by destroying the work or editing it to remove the depiction of a corpse. Should this occur, all erased corpses will immediately emerge from the text in question. Notably, corpses that emerge during these events are non-anomalous, and show signs of decay reminiscent of extended submersion in an acidic environment.\n\nThe method by which SCP-3138 is accomplished has yet to be determined.\n\n**Addendum 3138.1:** Recovery Logs\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/3138/recovery/102.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n> = **RECOVERY LOG**\n> ----\n> **DISCOVERY DATE:** 16/03/1942\n> **SUBJECT:** A 1921 paperback edition of //Great Expectations// by Charles Dickens.\n> ----\n>> = //**{{GREAT EXPECTATIONS}}**//\n>>\n>> **{{@@    @@‘Bless your soul and body, no,’ answered Wemmick,}}**\n>> **{{very drily. ‘But he is accused of it.
