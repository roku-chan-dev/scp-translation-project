For nearly a century, Fifthist activity on Earth was almost nonexistent. However, increased contact with the wider universe in the late 21st century and beyond revealed the continued existence of Fifthist practices similar yet distinct to Terran Fifthist traditions.\n\n++ Discovery\nThe following poem was found engraved on a slab on Epsilon 555-5 (colloquially known as \"Qintnep\"). Qintnep was already notable for its use of a Terran English-descended language despite minimal contact pre-22nd century C.E., presumed anomalous but explained via standard disinformation campaign. \n\nWhile similar to standard 21st century Foundation English in spelling, pronunciation, and orthography, 21st century Qintnepian English incorporates several words not easily pronounceable by standard human physiology. While many of these words can be explained by dialectal and physiological variation, several have phonological characteristics clearly drawn from pangalactic Fifthist glossolalia. \n\nWeathering and erosion analysis placed the carving of the poem to circa 2015 C.E. to 2050 C.E. The poem has been transcribed in its entirety with no alterations to spelling or grammar. Where necessary, standard Foundation English definitions or terms that best match the known connotations for these words have been given.\n\n++ Anomalous/Poetic Analysis:\n\nThe poem consists of five stanzas, each of five lines. Each stanza follows an AABAA rhyme scheme, where the B is held consistent across all five stanzas. Furthermore, the poem is written in iambic pentameter, though the poet breaks from said pentameter in stanzas 2, 3, and 4.\n\nStanza 5 adheres to iambic pentameter throughout.\n\nInvestigations are ongoing into whether the poem's content is neo-Fifthist apologia or genuine revelation.\n\nThis poem is safe to read aloud.\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 250%]]**1 Staar Cuttt 2 5**[[/size]]\n\n@@ @@\n\nI raised my eyes beyond the taunting stars\n\nThe pitch, the fractal void that spoke of tar\n\nAnd felt my God was dead; by arrow rent\n\nA wound from marble thought so deep afar,\n\nA blue void bright in God; a hole ffvar^^1^^.\n\n@@ @@ \n\nThey tore it, broke it, ignorant fearful\n\nHate, the blacktal^^2^^ of God's fruitful \n\nGift that in our souls consent, rise, ferment,\n\nRepent, enlighten each, all apostle.\n\nAliens thought that God's gift was awful\n\n@@ @@\n\nA weeping tearing of I came to pass\n\nThey slew my god, and I was now tlazs^^3^^\n\nTo break their world; their dream-space I make bent\n\nI call the chant; let crawl the blacktal mass\n\nBut horror strikes: my breath is merely gas\n\n@@ @@\n\nI knew it then, that truly God was dead.\n\nWhere purpose was, now bloomed the sevvenn^^4^^ dread\n\nI journeyed pink; my life was mine to end\n\nIn God, or husk, was there I'd lay my head\n\nAnd sleep and dream of fives.
