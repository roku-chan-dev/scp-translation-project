Containment measures discovered alongside SCP-4171 are to be maintained until deemed unnecessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4171 comprises two entities, designated SCP-4171-1 and SCP-4171-2.\n\nSCP-4171-1 is a silver coin. The obverse side (“heads”) features the face of an unidentified man; the reverse side (“tails”) features the logo of the Foundation. When tossed, SCP-4171-1 consistently lands tails,[[footnote]]The exception occurs when SCP-4171-1 is launched into a trajectory calculated to result in heads, a method which removes the intuitive concept of probability from the toss. Refer to Experiment Log 4171-1.[[/footnote]] though its mass is evenly distributed between the two faces.\n\nSCP-4171-2 is a human female of unknown age and race. Its anomalous nature manifests in three characteristics:\n* SCP-4171-2 does not require sustenance.\n* SCP-4171-2 does not blink.\n* SCP-4171-2 consistently flips tails on any coin[[footnote]]Or any such object with obverse and reverse sides, with the latter established and possible.[[/footnote]], including SCP-4171-1. The technique in which SCP-4171-2 tosses a coin sends it back to its thumb, allowing it to flip continuously. SCP-4171-2 has been observed to flip coins in this manner without ceasing or slowing down.\n\nSCP-4171 was discovered in the aftermath of [REDACTED]. The breach ended (after █ minutes and ████ casualties) when SCP-████ was destroyed by containment measures built into an unmarked cell. While moving to confirm that SCP-████ had been subdued, MTF Epsilon-11 (“Nine-Tailed Fox”) found SCP-4171-2 flipping SCP-4171-1 in this cell – a sealed chamber reinforced with steel, incorporating six active Scranton Reality Anchors. No records or special containment procedures for SCP-4171 existed prior to this discovery.\n\nSCP-4171-2 has generally complied with procedure. While retrieving SCP-4171-1 for experimentation, Dr. Aurelio Testa observed SCP-4171-2 catch and invert it onto the back of its hand before offering it to him. As he retrieved the item, Dr. Testa also heard SCP-4171-2 utter the words //you’re welcome//, marking the first time SCP-4171-2 had spoken and the only time SCP-4171-2 has spoken outside of its interview with him.\n\n**Addendum 4171-1:** Interview Log\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-4171-2\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Aurelio Testa\n> \n> **Foreword:** Dr. Testa was instructed to return SCP-4171-1 to SCP-4171-2 after experimentation (refer to Experiment Log 4171-1).\n> \n>  **<Begin Log>** \n> \n> @@[@@//Dr. Testa enters the cell with SCP-4171-1, stopping to regard SCP-4171-2.

Small gestures to… welcome what might otherwise be normal people to this place. As far as I know, you’re just a girl who doesn’t eat and doesn’t blink, who can’t flip heads on a coin. Not the strangest thing I’ve seen – not even close. And I like to play good cop with things that don’t scare me.\n> \n> Normally, I’d be the one explaining why you’re here. //You’d// be the one asking //me// why you’re here. Normally.

Why do you think that?\n> \n> **SCP-4171-2:** Because your foundation trusts in inevitability.\n> \n> **Dr. Testa:** We don’t believe in self-fulfilling prophecies.\n> \n> **SCP-4171-2:** Do you believe that?\n> \n> **Dr. Testa:** Do //I// believe that we //don't// believe in self-fulfilling prophecies?\n> \n> @@[@@//Dr. Testa contemplates this question//@@]@@\n> \n> **Dr. Testa:** I'm not inclined to answer that.\n> \n> @@[@@//SCP-4171-2 closes its fist around SCP-4171-1//@@]@@\n> \n> **SCP-4171-2:** Who do you answer to?\n> \n> **Dr. Testa:** Excuse me?\n> \n> @@[@@//SCP-4171-2 does not repeat the question//@@]@@\n> \n> **Dr. Testa:** I’m... not letting you in on the workings of our organization.

The timing was deemed coincidental. [[/footnote]] twenty-seven hours later, at which point SCP-4171-2 resumed flipping SCP-4171-1.\n> \n> Subsequent attempts to communicate with SCP-4171-2 were met with unresponsiveness. SCP-4171-2 has not ceased to flip SCP-4171-1. As of 01/01/2023, all recorded tosses have been tails.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4170]]] | SCP-4171 | [[[SCP-4172]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
