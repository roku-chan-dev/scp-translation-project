Information pertaining to SCP-8987 was leaked to the Foundation on 03/05/1966 by what appears to be an attempted whistleblower from Summit Anthracite, a Pennsylvanian coal company that has been in operation since 1952. The Red Brook Mine is the only mine owned by Summit Anthracite. \n\nThe POI who presented this information to the Foundation has yet to be identified.\n\nThe report alleged the following anomalous activities:\n\n* Notable loss of equipment.\n* Inexplicable alteration to pre-existing tunnels and mineshafts.\n* Deep vibrations, despite a notable lack of tectonic activity, even when no detonations are occurring. \n* The harvesting of minerals that the whistleblower could not identify. \n* Reported sightings of unknown figures. \n* Numerous other events that lack consistency or throughline, and are seemingly random. \n* The statement that \"the brook runs red\" was repeated multiple times within letter correspondence. This has been deemed noteworthy. \n\nAll these events are claimed to have begun in early 1963, when the mine's deepest point reached a depth of 170 meters below the surface, and are still ongoing. However, due to the vague nature of the leak itself, truth and accuracy are up for debate. An investigation into the Red Brook Mine, and Summit Anthracite, is ongoing and primarily being led by the Department of Geology under the name \"RED CANARY.\"\n\n------\n[[=]]\n+ ##red|INVESTIGATION RED CANARY##\n\n[[image redcanary.png width=\"350px\"]]\n\n//Led by Doctor Julian Eden, Head of the Department of Geology// \n[[/=]]\n\nOn 18/05/1966, a team of Foundation agents[[footnote]] Primarily members of MTF Gamma-89 (\"Rock and a Hard Place\"). [[/footnote]] were dispatched to locate and enter Summit Anthracite's primary building. The intention of the mission was to gain access to the company's archives and search for any available information on the Red Brook Mine. \n\nThe building was found to be completely empty. \n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **RED CANARY REPORT**\n\nWe'd been prepared for standard procedure.

Whoever had been here left //fast.// We almost thought we had the wrong building for a moment, till I found the scraps of a poster in a dusty corner with Summit’s logo on it.  \n\nThere used to be things here, that’s for sure. I can tell where they used to store records and what used to be office spaces, imprints on the floor where storage once was. But it’s gone. \n\nOddest thing is, none of this is mentioned anywhere.

It appeared new but hastily constructed, and the deployed agents estimated  that the area was housing up to 100 individual workers. This location was not present in any public records -- its construction appears to have been wholly unauthorized, or just unrecorded entirely. This discontinuity was reported immediately to Dr. Eden, who was chief communication for the investigation.\n\nMembers of Gamma-89 were instructed to attempt to infiltrate the mine camp under the guise of employees, and recover information from the surrounding housing. They were to map the area and determine the equipment onsite in tandem.\n\nThe most notable discovery regarding the mine town and its operations was that, during day-to-day operations, they were excavating petrified wood alongside the anthracite coal. \n\nThe following snippets are transcribed from recovered journal and paper fragments from Summit Anthracite miners that have been deemed relevant to RED CANARY.\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n**5/14/1963**\n\nWeather was fine, bit of a drizzle, but when the fog coats the mountain I can't really complain. Looks downright lovely. Decent backdrop before throwing myself back in the depths for another shift.\n\nWhile digging, a buddy of mine was going on some spiel about ancient forests turned to rock, and those old plants are what makes the coal. Petrified, or something, was the word he used. Apparently some folks are finding wood in the muck, or something. Guess trees can reach to these depths.\n\nThat, or he's just making some odd idle chatter to keep things interesting. There isn't much to talk down below, sometimes.

He briefly covers it with his palm as he steps through the mine's entrance and into the dark. He removes his hand, and walks on.//\n\n//He illuminates his path via an open lantern affixed to his hard hat, much like the other miners. He nods his head at the pair he passes, slipping past the mine cart. Agent Weller holds a clipboard in his hands, and uses it to sketch out his path as he progresses through the mine.//\n\n//There is squelching as he walks, the mine floor muddy beneath his shoes. Rain water runs rivulets down the tunnels and walls. Above the static of Agent Weller's breathing, dripping can be heard.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** //[Muttering]// Damn rain. \n\n//He begins to walk on the wooden guides for the mine carts, instead.// \n\n//It is early in the morning, but there are an ample amount of workers about. Agent Weller passes laborers, miners, people loading carts with coal. After approximately two minutes of walking and mapping, he pauses and watches a pair of miners chipping away at a vein that appears a different texture than the rock body it lies in. Agent Weller would later report that what they were mining chipped away into brilliant oranges and pinks. They appear to have difficulty in removing it from the wall.//  \n\n**Agent Weller:** You boys struggling? \n\n**Milton:**[[footnote]] \"Dean Milton\".

He is at the outskirts of the mine, now.//\n\n//Agent Weller comes to a pause, and reassesses his map, while leaning against an empty mine cart.//\n\n//A hand can be seen resting on the cart.

Oh, no, no. There's just work to be done. Can't eavesdrop for shit over the sound of picks on stone, ey? \n\n//Agent Weller stands in silence for a long moment, clearly tense.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** Are you the one causing the anomalies? \n\n//The figure barks a laugh. It's a thick, wet sound.//\n\n**Unknown:** Ha! If it were up to me, I would've brought the mountain down while they all slept. Maybe drag that bastard Keshner into the rubble with me. \n\n**Agent Weller:** Then what are you?\n\n**Unknown:** The foreman. \n\n//Agent Weller pauses in confusion. The figure continues.//\n\n**Unknown:** Not of these folks, of course. They already have one. I am the foreman of the //mine//, not the men. My duty lies in watching below.\n\n**Agent Weller:** So the mine's yours. \n\n**Unknown:** I've more a right to it than they ever will, but it's still far from mine to claim. I'm merely trying to chase them out before something worse than //I// crawls outta the trembling woodworks.\n\n**Agent Weller:** Clearly it's not working. I dug out years worth of accidents from Keshner's desk. People die, they hire new ones, nothing changes. \n\n//The entity hisses out a breath.// \n\n**Unknown:** Sickening, ain't it? Them black market bastards will run this place red before they give up what they think they'll gain. \n\n**Agent Weller:** You know about Marshall, Carter and Dark?\n\n**Unknown:** Hard not to, with that sniveling rat they put in charge. //[It chuckles]// Good riddance you robbed his office blind. \n\n//Agent Weller exhales. He roots around in his pocket and produces the piece of petrified wood he'd gathered earlier. He examines it in the light of his lantern.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** But why the hell are they here?

This occurred without incident, as the majority of Summit Anthracite's employees were civilian -- with little knowledge of the potential nature of the operation -- and did not resist Foundation efforts. All mining activity was thus ceased. \n\nAll individuals from Red Brook Mine were summarily amnesticized of their employment post-1963 and released, and Foreman Keshner was taken into custody after being confirmed as an MC&D operative. The area surrounding Dutch Mountain has been locked down and secured out of concern for any retaliatory efforts from MC&D. \n\nRED CANARY's investigation concluded with sufficient evidence of anomalous activity to warrant designation of SCP-8987. \n\nDiscovering SCP-8987's nature would become the next goal of operations conducted at the Red Brook Mine. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=oro-red\n|unique-name=lowercase-nospaces\n|display-name=OROGENESIS.aic\n]]\n[[image OROGENESIS.gif width=\"100px\" style=\"margin-right: 10px; float: right;\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"aic\"]] All previous witness accounts of anomalous events that occurred within the RED BROOK MINE from 1963 to 1966 -- prior to FOUNDATION intervention -- have been assumed to be entirely FACTUAL.

As construction progressed, the scope of the Site's purpose would expand. Site-898 subsequently became the Foundation's first geological research facility.  \n\n[[div class=\"floatbox right\"]]\n[[span style=\"color:#ff0033;\"]][[span class=\"aic\"]] The head of the DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY, Doctor Julian Eden, would be promoted to DIRECTOR of Site-898 on 15/07/1966.[[/span]][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Site was constructed within the original mine encampment left by Summit Anthracite, and the surrounding housing once used for miners and laborers was refurbished as usage for staff dormitories. This area, nestled within Coalbed Swamp, lies at the base of Dutch Mountain. The primary entrance to the Red Brook Mine itself was built over and integrated into the Site's grounds for means of further study, with the remaining open shaft being marked. Local geological surveys have been edited to reflect priority category Extreme Health or Safety Impact, Reclamation status in progress.[[footnote]] Indicating ecological and safety dangers posed by mine pollution. [[/footnote]] \n\n[[include component:image-block name= site898.png|caption= **Figure 3.1:** Geological Research Site-898, interior. |width=400px|align= left]]\n\nSite-898 itself would begin operation under the cover of an non-anomalous geological research facility working in environmental reclamation. The Site was originally staffed by RED CANARY personnel, who were later joined by Foundation geological specialists.\n\nAfter the establishment of Site-898 reached completion, Director Eden and members of staff would begin to re-investigate the Red Brook Mine. By proxy, this would resume mining operations within Dutch Mountain — though specifically being done by Foundation geologists.\n\nUpon resumption, discordant phenomena associated with SCP-8987 also resumed. Aside from a positive correlation between intensity and excavation depth, no consistent patterns of behavior were established.[[footnote]] No Foundation casualties occurred. [[/footnote]]\n\nResearch into SCP-8987 continued until a major breakthrough on 24/08/1966. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Video Log 8987.2** \n**Date:** 24/08/1966\n**Individuals Present:** Director Julian Eden, MTF Gamma-89[[footnote]] Captain Alfred Lynn, Agents Rudy Weller, Derrick Joyce, Glenn Bird, Rosa Pierce, Irene Reed. [[/footnote]]\n------\n//<Recording Start>//\n\n//Dir. Eden is striding down the tunnels, adjusting the pager at his hip as it beeps. The camera is affixed to his hard hat.// \n\n//The sound of drilling echoes from ahead. He picks up his pace as the sounds grow louder.//\n\n//At the end of the tunnel are six individuals of MTF Gamma-89. Cpt. Lynn is aiding Agent Weller in drilling large holes into the wall. Agents Joyce and Reed are taking measurements of a vein of petrified wood with a heavy duty compass, while Agents Pierce and Bird are standing watch. They are a task force of field geologists, explosive techs, and engineers.//\n\n//Agent Pierce nods at Dir. Eden as he approaches.// \n\n**Dir. Eden:** You rang? \n\n//He clicks his fingernail against his pager for emphasis.//\n\n**Agent Pierce:** Captain says there is airflow through the holes. There is something on the other side of that wall. //[She jerks her head towards Cpt. Lynn and Agent Weller]// He wanted you here for it, probably to oversee. \n\n**Dir. Eden:** A cavern is promising. Are we still on course? \n\n//He peers around Agent Pierce, and Agent Reed glances over her shoulder.//\n\n**Agent Reed:** Yeah. Strike and dip of these veins--\n\n**Agent Weller:** Roots.\n\n**Agent Reed:** Of the //roots// started getting mighty consistent about a couple meters back. We've been mapping a good chunk of them, and they seem to all be dipping towards a center point.\n\n**Agent Joyce:** Which seems to be right where we are heading. \n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Which is why -- //[He braces a hand on his knee and pushes himself up, grunting]// -- we think this cavern is what we've been hunting for. \n\n**Dir. Eden:** Wonderful.\n\n//Agent Weller prepares dynamite, checking the wiring that connects to a detonator a few meters behind Dir. Eden. He then looks up at Cpt. Lynn, and nods.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Alright, scram, we're gonna detonate. Keep it small, Weller, we don't know the stability of whatever is beyond. \n\n**Agent Weller:** Yes, sir.\n\n//Cpt. Lynn jerks his head down the tunnel, and all members of the team take cover a significant distance away from the tunnel's end as Agent Weller primes the detonator. He double checks the dynamite's wiring. He looks over his shoulder to the others for confirmation.//\n\n//Cpt. Lynn gives it, and the agent begins a countdown.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** FIRE!\n\n//Detonation successful.// \n\n//A sizable hole has been blasted into the wall. When the dust settles, there is only darkness beyond that gap.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Adjust your lights. We're going in.\n\n//The team enters the space. Their lights do not pierce far. Dir. Eden scans large evaporite deposits that lie close to them, before turning his head back forward. Cpt. Lynn strides ahead.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Damn, she's bigger than I thought. \n\n//Agent Joyce slips with a quiet yelp, causing the team to startle. Agent Pierce seizes his arm before he falls.// \n\n**Agent Pierce:** //Whoop!// Be careful. There's a slope. \n\n//Agent Joyce steadies himself, ducking his head at Agent Pierce.// \n\n**Agent Joyce:** Steep, too. Watch your steps.\n\n//Dir. Eden keeps his head low as he begins to trek down the slope. He pauses, briefly, when his foot hooks on what appears to be an outcrop of petrified wood.//\n\n//The slope becomes gentler, and eventually flattens out. The sound of dripping water can be heard echoing through the cavern. Agent Reed tilts her head back and forth, seeming to try to gauge the cavern's size by that echo. She sighs and shakes her head.//\n\n//Agent Weller squints, adjusts his light.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** There's something up ahead.\n\n//They press forward, and Dir. Eden can be seen repeatedly glancing around. His light catches on more outcrops of the wood, casting shadows across the stone. They're getting larger. His head jerks up to stare at the ceiling above. His light does not reach it. There is only darkness.//\n\n//Dir. Eden hisses in a breath and looks back down. He picks up his pace, and walks closer to the rest of the team. Agent Reed suddenly stops, sucking in a breath. It causes the others to still, confused.//\n\n**Agent Reed:** Holy shit. Bring the lights to 12 o'clock.   \n\n//Cpt. Lynn huffs at the order, but the rest of the team obeys.//\n\n//Their lights cast against a massive form at the cavern's heart. It is a tree trunk, 6 meters in diameter, with thick roots growing out from the base. Dir. Eden's gaze traces upwards along its form, and his light dimly reflects off of tangled branches above. The leaves upon them glimmer.//\n\n//The shadows of hundreds of branches, lined with crystal, loom above their heads. They still cannot see the ceiling. Estimates put the space at a height of at least 30 meters.//\n\n//There's a crunch, when Agent Weller takes a step back. He jolts, and the team all whip their heads over.//\n\n//He had stepped on a fallen twig. There are shards of crystal around it.//\n\n//There are broken branches and shattered crystal all throughout the base of the tree.//\n\n**Dir. Eden:** ...It's been damaged...? \n\n**Agent Joyce:** Can't be dying. It's already dead. \n\n**Agent Pierce:** Still damaged. \n\n//Dir. Eden glances over his shoulder at Agents Pierce and Bird.//\n\n**Dir. Eden:** Get one of the floodlights. \n\n//The two agents duck their heads in a nod, and depart back towards the tunnel to retrieve the equipment.//\n\n//A few minutes later, they return. The large, albeit clunky device sits at the top of the slope as they adjust it. Agent Pierce ignites the wires so that the large bulbs can spark to life.//\n\n//The floodlight activates. Its bright beam pierces the dark.//\n\n//The room's ceiling is lined with both stalactites and branches, twisting throughout the entire length of it. There are millions of crystals glimmering off the branches of the tree, sharp prisms that cast shifting patterns across the ceiling.//\n\n**Agent Bird:** That's gotta be the size of a redwood.  \n\n**Agent Weller:** ...All the roots lead here. \n\n//There is a pause.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** We're gonna wanna bring in more equipment. Get up some analysis, measurements, more folks down here. Weller, with me. We're gonna blast a bigger hole so we can fit shit through.\n\n**Agent Weller:** Yes, sir. \n\n**Dir. Eden:** Just mind the slope when you do.\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Will do. Should be able to keep it back.\n\n//The two depart, and leave the remaining five members of the team investigating the base of what will now be referred to as SCP-8987.//\n\n**Dir. Eden:** We should wait before gathering samples. Refrain from touching anything for now.\n\n**Agent Pierce:** Don't have to tell me twice. \n\n//Agent Joyce nudges one of the broken pieces of wood with his shoe, before stepping back when Agent Bird glares at him for doing so.// \n\n**Agent Joyce:** Wonder what's been making them fall. \n\n**Dir. Eden:** I'm honestly surprised its branches still hang to begin with. Their fossilization should've rendered them far too heavy.\n\n//Cpt. Lynn pages Dir. Eden, notifying him that the detonation is to occur within the next 10 seconds.//\n\n//The team turns towards the tunnel, meters back and up the slope, as the sound of Cpt. Lynn's shouted countdown echoes through the cavern.// \n\n**Agent Weller:** //FIRE IN THE HOLE!//\n\n//Detonation successful.// \n\n//The cavern shakes, as dust and rocks explode into the air.//\n\n//There is a deafening snap, almost louder than the explosion moments prior. Dir. Eden turns back towards SCP-8987 just in time to see a massive branch crash to the ground meters from him. It sends a shower of shards out in its sudden burst.//\n\n//A thick, dark liquid oozes from the broken end of the fallen branch. Agents would later state that it was red.// \n\n[[include component:image-block name= tree1.jpg |caption= **Figure 3.2:** SCP-8987 branch. |width=750px|align= center]]\n\n//All individuals have startled and scattered away at branch's sudden fall.// \n\n**Agent Bird:** //Shit!// Blast was too much--  \n\n//Cpt. Lynn and Agent Weller come running back into the cavern. They have analysis equipment in tow. Agent Weller almost drops his at the sight of the scene unfolding.// \n\n**Dir. Eden:** Get away from the tree, //NOW!//\n\n//Wheezing can be heard over the Director's shout. It is wet and heavy. Agent Weller's head snaps up, eyes widening.//\n\n//The crackling and snapping intensifies. Crunching like breaking wood and stone, echoing loudly throughout the cavern. The team scrambles away from the tree with shouts of confusion.//\n\n//More of the liquid gushes from the tree. It splatters down from the broken stump where the branch fell, spraying against the cavern floor. Dir. Eden just barely avoids being caught in that spray, his breathing audible. It syncs with the wet wheezes that are echoing through the cavern.//\n\n//Though nothing else falls from SCP-8987, the sounds continue. They are growing louder. There is an audible, white-noise hum.//\n\n//Agent Reed's compass suddenly breaks. Its casing falls apart, its hands and levels and gears tumbling to the ground. Glass shatters against the cavern floor. She yelps and throws its pieces in surprise.//\n\n//Dir. Eden's pager crumbles. Its screen turns to sand and pours down his leg, its screws fall out and its wiring spills. He too throws it to the ground, where it continues to come undone.//\n\n//The liquid spraying out from SCP-8987 spits and hisses as though boiling.// \n\n//There is a crackling noise from behind, and the team whips their heads around just in time to see that the floodlight's bulbs are cracking. The camera footage has degraded significantly.//\n\n//With sharp snaps, the bulbs in the floodlight all explode one by one. The glass and glass shards crumble to sand. The team's own headlamps soon follow. There's a THUNK as one of them throws their hardhat to the ground.//\n\n//The cavern is plunged into darkness. No visual feedback.//\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Sound off. We all alive?\n\n//All agents indicate clear. Dir. Eden states similar.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Did that thing fry all our tech?\n\n**Agent Pierce:** Shit was shoddy to begin with. Open flames in a mine aren't smart, but I trust 'em more than I do any bulb.\n\n**Agent Weller:** Wait -- //shit do I still have it.// Hold on. \n\n//There's a clicking, sparking sound. Agent Weller ignites an old lantern. The firelight flickers against the faces of the team members as they approach. Camera footage is still degraded, but functional.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** ...Foundation tech might fail, but fire won't. \n\n//Dir. Eden catches his breath, exhales audibly. He turns his head back in the direction of SCP-8987, though now it cannot be seen. The sound of dripping liquid is still audible.//\n\n**Dir. Eden:** So that's what's has been causing this...\n\n**Agent Bird:** The tree gets shaken, the mine bleeds? \n\n**Agent Weller:** I think it's been bleeding for a long time. MC&D were just twisting the knife in the wound when they took over. \n\n//Cpt. Lynn sighs.//\n\n**Cpt. Lynn:** Blood from stone. \n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Agent Weller:** We should go before the lantern runs out of fuel.\n\n//There is a murmur of agreement. The team shuffles to head back up towards the tunnel. There is a faint light emitting from it. The event did not reach beyond the cavern.//\n\n//Agent Weller glances back, and Dir. Eden follows his gaze as he ducks back into the tunnel. For a brief moment -- in the low, flickering light -- a humanoid figure can be seen standing amidst the stalagmites.// \n\n//<Recording End>// \n------\n**Afterword:** The team departed from the Red Brook Mine without further incident. Upon return, Dir. Eden was treated for minor cuts, being the only individual to have sustained injury. \n\nImmediately, plans for SCP-8987's containment began. \n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"anom-bar-esoteric\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 8987\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= keter\n|secondary-class= none\n|secondary-icon= \n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|disruption-image= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/vlam-icon.svg\n|disruption-color= 39, 30, 46\n|inc-disruption= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|risk-class= caution\n|risk-image= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:anomaly-class-bar/caution-icon.svg\n|risk-color= 39, 30, 46\n|inc-risk= --]]]\n------\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= tree2.jpg |caption= **Figure 4.1:** SCP-8987. |width=1000px|align= center]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-898 has since been established, and the Red Brook Mine has ceased operation and shut down as of 06/06/1966.

A pair of magnetically locked gates separate this chamber from the rest of the mine, and an array of Scranton Reality Anchors have been constructed to stabilize the anomaly.  To avoid immense power drain on Site-898 these SRAs are only to be operated by stationed staff when OROGENESIS detects an activation event.\n\nFull access to SCP-8987's chamber can only be authorized by either the Director of Site-898,[[footnote]] As of 1966, Director Julian Eden.[[/footnote]] or by the Head of the Department of Geology.[[footnote]] Dir. Eden would pass this role onto Dr. Hellen Gibbs upon receiving his directorship.[[/footnote]] This authorization can be extended in case of emergency at its holder's discretion. However, all personnel are prohibited from taking samples from SCP-8987. \n\nFor activation events, defer to the RUNS RED Procedure. \n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-8987 is a petrified tree of unknown genus, whose roots and branches proliferate throughout the bedrock within and around the Red Brook Mine, Dutch Mountain, Pennsylvania. SCP-8987's trunk is 6 meters in diameter, with its branches reaching a height of 31 meters at their peak. These branches expand through the majority of the 41.8 meter diameter chamber the anomaly resides in. This chamber itself lies at a depth of approximately 250 meters below the surface.\n\nAnalysis of samples from SCP-8987's roots -- harvested by previous activity -- has shown that the petrified wood contains heavy amounts of silica, and minerals similar to those of baseline petrified trees. In addition, SCP-8987's formation within a coal bed has resulted in the accumulation of heavy metals within it such as chromium and germanium. \n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= crystal.jpg |caption= **Figure 4.2:** Photograph of SCP-8987 crystals. |width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIn place of leaves, SCP-8987 has crystalline structures growing along its branches. These crystals are small, angular and white in color. While chemical analysis of them is impossible due to their sensitive nature, they superficially resemble hexagonal crystals such as quartz. \n\nSCP-8987 activation events are surges of localized reality failure brought on when significant vibrations[[footnote]] Threshold unknown.[[/footnote]] within the surrounding environment trigger resonation within the anomaly's crystalline leaves. This destabilization of local reality[[footnote]]An area encompassing roughly the entirety of the Red Brook Mine.[[/footnote]] results in the manifestation of anomalous effects. These created anomalies, phenomena, or events are typically unpredictable in nature -- with currently little noted pattern or consistency outside environmental influence.[[footnote]] For a comprehensive list of recorded/contained RUNS RED anomalies, please refer to the Site-898 Database and Containment Wing.[[/footnote]] As a result of the cessation of the Red Brook mine's previous operations, and the instatement of SCP-8987's containment procedures, activation events have significantly decreased as of 1967.\n\n[[div class=\"floatbox\"]]\n[[span style=\"color:#ff0033;\"]][[span class=\"aic\"]] KNOW/REMEMBER \nthat SCP-8987 is \nnot ALIVE.[[/span]][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\nDuring an activation event, SCP-8987 will appear to \"bleed\". The resultant liquid is red, with a consistency similar to sap, and ontokinetically unstable. Once released, it will then flow down the tree and along its roots, and solidify after an indeterminate amount of time. It is theorized that this bleeding and solidifying has caused SCP-8987 to \"grow\", and that disturbances from the Summit Anthracite mining operation caused its gradual expansion throughout the mine. \n\nIt has also been found that the petrified wood that makes up SCP-8987 is a powerful conduit for ontokinetic energy,[[footnote]] Excess SCP-8987 wood, seized from the previous operation, has been sent to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Foundation Site-120].[[/footnote]] and likely the reason for the severity behind activation events.

Enter the Red Brook Mine, seal the gate behind. Have personnel on standby at the entrance in case of emergency. Any remaining staff should remain within the Site until the Procedure's conclusion. \n\n4. Locate the anomaly. Do not split up. \n\n5. Determine the nature of the anomaly: \n**Event**\n**Object**\n**Entity**\n\n6. Act accordingly: \n  If the anomaly is an **event**, let it run its course. \n  If the anomaly is an **object**, determine its properties in the safest manner possible and retrieve it.\n  If the anomaly is an **entity**, attempt to make contact. If the entity displays sapience, attempt containment diplomatically. If the entity does not display sapience, apprehend by force. \n\n7. The Containment Wing lies beneath Site-898's central building. Due to the RUNS RED Procedure, there is an entrance to it linked within the mine. Secure the gate and enter. Close behind. \n\n8.
