Mages of his order shaped Zargyr; created with their abominably ingenious magics near every species that fills the Great Plateau, from the mighty flamingo-bear to the archaeopteryx-squirrels of the treetops. Auracle held close to his eye, the impossibly old man sees a baleful emission of thaumaturgy abound on the great open horizon.\n\nThe wizard's merocelot familiar clings to the windowframe, peering outside in incertitude-turned-horror.\n\n\"What is it, what is it?\"\n\nThe amalgamate creature gestures toward the dimensional door at the end of the cobbled path leading to their tower of solitude. Clearly disrupted; blinking in and out of phase. A clear blockage of thaumic flow, perhaps deliberately inflicted. Could someone be trying to replace the Godhead's place as Fulcrum already? No, impossible, he thinks to himself. This must be some other working; something more insidious.\n\nTurning his head, he sees his arcane autopress replicate an all-too familiar insignia as it picks up and filters the first beams of thaumic radiation, visible on printed page in remarkable relative clarity. The exalted Seal of Solomon, ever eminent and unmistakable.\n\nThe Vast Sealing has begun, and his quarters are among the first targets in its campaign of containment.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Yaku Akapana[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nA man recites an incantation to the local rain god from memory to open a passage. He stands before a waterfall, within a cave, by a river at the heart of vast Amazonia, surrounded by lush rainforest on all sides. He steps into the subterranean rapids, and emerges on the other side in a sprawling chasm-city submerged impossibly low beneath the river basin.\n\nThe city is cluttered with skeletal remains and oxidized Incan copper charms sold off to buy the mercy of the water-people. Roads are basalt and agate-speckled cobble; buildings bear crocodile-skin roofs propped up by arapaima ribs. An innumerable swarm of piranhas eternally circle overhead, obscuring the sun from view from beneath the water's surface. The place's denizens are shambling marine-men and shapeshifting river dolphins, often distinguishable to the man from under the dark waters only by their glowing eyes.\n\nYaku Akapana was unknown to most of the world, though to the Quechua, it was a veritable underwater Daevon. Only they knew to find the water-people's cities through hidden openings behind waterfalls or under riverbeds or on the other sides of dripping cave ceilings. Marinefolk of all stripes had always racked up a reputation for enigmatic human abductions; humans had first come here to make a deal with the Yacuruna not unlike that exchange orchestrated later with their loathed Dagonite cousins by the captain Obed Marsh; in exchange for gifts and sacrifices, the Yacuruna would abstain from dragging the Runa to the bottoms of their rivers and lakes.\n\nThe man is an intermediary between his own house and theirs; he has made this trip hundreds of times. Each week, he came to give offerings to the Yacuruna in exchange for their mercy, so as to ensure none of his kin drowned mysteriously of their accord, or would otherwise be dragged to the river-floor by the water spirits. His prayers of wayfinding granted passage to this place; his charms of warding braced him from its eerie malisons.\n\nWhen the job is done, the man treks back to the far side of the waterfall. He says the spell, walks forward, and cannot pass. On the other side now is only a rough cave-stone wall. A great and terrible rite has closed the door both ways. It seems he will have to brave the cold streets of his abyssal destination for much longer than he thought.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]City of Brass[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nThe illustrious City of Brass bustled with the humming of levitating djinn and the shambling of automata across its mosaiced streets. As on any other day, today's dawn brought the bright sun upon the vibrant jewel of the Sahara, the city that ticked and tocked and steamed and burned in glaring ingenuity amid the sands, its blazing majesty unrivaled by anywhere else in Dar al-Islam. It was truly city which truly never slept, for its inhabitants had no need for rest, nor food, nor drink -- smithed by the flames of the Ifrit and fueled by the magmatic brass engines of their artifice, built and sustained by the clockwork Servants of Bronze and the ceaseless turning of their metal-given-spirit, planned in its entirety by the ingenious handicraft of its founding engineers, the metropolis of the djinn was without parallel in its industry and antique splendor.\n\nCountless ifrit flew their elaborate fireproofed carpets to the great bazaar in the city square, where merchants sold their arcane wares, the fruits of the elemental smiths' labor. Plates and pottery emblazoned with laces of glowing brass piled on the floors upon artisan rugs, ever-burning lamps hung from the ceilings. Carts of exotic spices lined the walls that hung with enchanted Eyes of Fatima and searing scimitars with perpetually white-hot edges, adorned with shelves of sealed vases and oil lamps containing imprisoned lesser djinn. \n\nThe city was as alive on that day as in the halcyon years of the Prophet, if not more so. A merchant's voice boomed from the square, \"Come one, come all! Finest vases in all Djinnestan, renowned from Badiatealgim to Schadou Kiam! Now //that's// some made-at-home craftsmanship the City of Emeralds can't match!\" -- Elsewhere, an entrepreneurial fire spirit explained his new business to an inquiring passerby; \"This here's a new oil well we've been building. Beneath these blazing sands is no small deposit of petroleum, you see, and Westerners burn oil to fuel their machines instead of jailed spirits. Apparently, djinni treasures aren't good enough for those British!\"\n\nHardly any in the great city that glorious dawn felt the revengeant force of the long-dead King Solomon's magics, though they persisted all the same. The King had waged war with his spells to banish Djinnestan from the base-world during his own life; had attempted to seal away cities far older than the City of Brass over a thousand years before the Prophet was ever born -- never able to predict the mercurial djinn, he feared their pernicious attacks on his kingdom would increase without end if he failed to lock them away. These initial efforts almost three millennia ago did little to forestall them in the long term, leaving only a few vexing seals on their settlements and a number of djinn trapped within bronze jars buried and scattered across the Sahara, traceable to Solomon only by wearing the mark of his signet ring. This second advance, headed by a man who made it his mission to finish the Old King's work, would prove much more devastating.\n\nPerhaps the opulence of their abode blinded them, for the djinn in the City of Brass hardly noticed that day would be the last of an era. But by around noon, when the brilliant sun blazed at its zenith in the sky, one traveler or another who passed through the city's grand gates to or from the desolate Sahara must have been the last. For on that fated 21st Muharram, 1299 AH, and forever onward, the Vast Sealing would render those gates that once marked the crowning jewel of the sands little more than an oversized setpiece of a prior age, for even those remaining few vagabonds and wanderers who would still wash up in the City of Brass did so in secret by plotting paths across the Ways or learning to navigate the Grand Library.\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Yrk Kalashton, Kalaphastia[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nIt was long said that the winding sky-river Shatar flowed for such a distance it reached the moon if one followed it closely. But Kalaphastia was a shattered land, and its people long since dispersed and exiled to the ground; the islands of the skies, after all, were ruled by the hallowed saurian reapers of the mountains and the tentacled oracles of the Dark Tapestry.\n\nKalashton, which lie at the origin of the river by the coast, was a myst-choked place of black marble and ichor-stained glyphs and the supernal ire of a long-dead pallid platinum age. Lamps of lumenol harvested from the carcases of great landsquids dotted the streets, warding off the darkness cast by the Perpetual Eclipse. The forever-darkened sun was both an object of religious reverence and a dread-god to be feared; if one gazed upon it for too long outside the bounds of the Cathedral, it was said a warped door to Alagadda or Haraia would open between the manifolds on the undersides of clouds and drag the treacherous stargazer up and away.\n\nToday, unbeknownst to him, a man would make the last pilgrimage Kalashton's Great Cathedral by foot. Upon his arrival, the pilgrim crooked open the languid osmium vault-door and stepped through the maze of burgundy curtains only to find the sanctum empty. He kneeled at an altar, gazed up into the shrouded Sun, and there saw and heard and smelled and felt all too well the rancorous primeval cacophony that fought with itself to keep the ground on which he stood in limbo between the sane world and the glorious terror of the vast and undulating unthings beyond.\n\nBefore his eyes, the last string that kept Kalaphastia bound from that celestial bedlam was severed, and the sky-portals devoured Yrk Kalashton whole as it fell forevermore toward the baleful Neverwillbe.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Surreality[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13nd rebmeceD 8118 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n\"Your suzerainty, vizier Gregor Samsa.\"\n\nThe herald's voice boomed across the halls as they pointed across the room with their antennae, alerting the Culicid Baroness of the approaching advisor. He was a young man with a broad prothorax and imposing compound eyes, dressing in a well-ironed four armed uniform which forced him into an unnatural bipedal posture. A golden order badge melted off his right lapel -- the Order of Persistence, highest imperial mark for a cockroach.\n\nThe advisor chittered. \"Your suzerainty. I come with news from the Shivering Kingdom.\"\n\nThe Baroness looked down at Samsa, the towering Swallowtail Throne an awesome presence. The uncanny monarch dined esuriently, proboscis lodged into the entrails of some unfortunate subject. \"Don't just stand there, vizier, and do get on with it\", she hissed. \"It's only cranberry juice, you know\".\n\n\"Indeed\", the advisor raised from his bow. \"Our intelligence sources agree an assembly of damnable certainty-sympathizers have gathered in that bizarre world and signed a concord to create a new organization. It seems these would-be paladins of reality intend to lock away all traces of fantasy in their already-condensed world until only the most normal things remain.\"\n\nIt pained him to say the word. \"Normal\". That execrable concept so contemptuous it united the whole Surreality against it. No matter their differences, inside or outside, teeth or no teeth, they knew they got it right on the reality question. The wretched Shivering Kingdom with its heretical formal logic and laws of physics simply could not compare to their majesty.\n\n\"Outrageous!\", the Baroness of Mosquitoes cried. \"This is a blatant act of contempt towards all people and things unreal. What terrible sort of surreals we would be if we did not take a stand against this unacceptably normal course of action.\"\n\n\"Truly\", Samsa assured. \"What course of action do you recommend, o Voracious One?\"\n\n\"Can these pestilent shiverers reach our domain from the Certainty?\" she asked. \"If so, we must destroy them.\"\n\nThe advisor produced a scroll from the bottomless maw he used as a bag. \"Not imminently, but there is one cause for concern: it appears one among their ranks has concocted a drug capable of liberating the mind of the shiverer from its logical perspective so as to establish contact with our world\". He unraveled the scroll to reveal a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dancing-into-the-sun photograph of a disturbed-looking bearded man] with skin instead of chitin and tiny, non-insectoid eyes.\n\n\"I don't take it you know this man? He calls his invention the //agnostic//. This poses considerable risks to us if it should manifest, but I would not underestimate the consensus of the other Paladins. Obviously, they think the man is insane. Such is the shortcoming of the logical being, of course.\"\n\nThe Baroness replied. \"Tell my court oneiricists in the antistellarium to haunt this man with dreams that dissuade him from this alarming line of work. It's halfway up the stairs down to the first floor; room three between the endless mirror maze and the clock foundry. I assume you have the Objects required for this task?\"\n\n\"Of course\", advisor Samsa responded. \"Your wish is my command, Baroness.\"\n\nHe snapped the finger-hairs on his forelimb, and a cascade of dodecahedra fell from the ceiling onto the courtroom carpet.\n\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Grove of Nysa[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nThe mountainous domain of the rain nymphs never ceased to allude the Greek explorers. Often they mapped it near Cyrenaica or vast Aethiopia below, sometimes in Thrace, and most often along the Indus. But never could they agree fully where it lie, for it seemed the paths to Nysa seemed to open wherever they wished, and ships bound to just about anywhere could find themselves upon its hilly shores. \n\nToday, an order of satyr followers of Cernunnos-Bacchus meet in the illuminant Nysan Grove to work their druidry. Times have changed since the foundation of their covenic sect nearly two thousand years ago; once ubiquitous cult worship of the Horned God and the Triple Goddess has declined utterly, but the Gardnerians have yet to rise and claim their legacy. Tree-staff and cauldron had been replaced in many thaumaturgic circles by industrial ozymandium alchemo-crucibles and irrilite-filamented foci. The old druids and all practitioners of their child traditions withdrew further into the forests and fled Europe for the Outer Realms. Most of all, syncretism and folkloric change took their toll on the gods of old, splitting off countless deities from the once-almighty Horned God of madness and the wooded wildes, forcing what was left of him into the Blazing World's brightwoods to masquerade with his Wild Hunt rechristened as Herne the Horned.\n\nCommitted covens continued to worship their gods, hoping to reinvigorate their splintered and syncretized deities by force of their own belief or by plotting an overthrow of the Christendom that slayed them; a prospect only more and more laughable each day as Church entrenched itself. Now, few remain in any civilized domain, the numbers of old covens and warlocks dwindling further and further.\n\nThe first satyr appears with news. The Godhead is dead; shattered utterly by a sect of madmen lashing out in hopes to end the Mage War in their favor, and its monadic control over the flow of magic has likewise ceased. now, surely, is at last the time they have awaited. Only now can the Old Orders prop up their pantheons to prominence and return the archaic gods to their rightful authority. \n\nHis fellow coven members attend the site, drawing glyphs and runes in a circle on the grass with their arcane chalk and placing the goblet, candelabrum and reindeer-skull on the carpeted altar to focus its power. After these preparations, a beldam pythoness of maenad blood steps forward holding a poppet, dousing it in goddess' tears. She waits for the witching oil to infuse itself into the doll before taking the Athame to its stomach.\n\n\"In the name of the Maiden\", one cantor begins, \"we call for favor upon our deeds\".\n\n\"In the name of the Mother\", another recites, \"we call for sanctuary from malady\".\n\n\"In the name of the Crone\", a third finishes, \"we call for retribution against our attackers\".\n\nA covenic tribe of cast-out Dionysians gather in their greatest numbers in centuries with the intent to call their long-resting gods to action. Unbeknownst to them, they have received the opportune news two months too late. Instead, their rite will happen to be cast at just the right moment to spare Nysa's idyllic orchards from a global cascade of Solomon seals.\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/leyXBPM.png style=\"width: 50px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 200%]]Oneiroi West[[/size]]\n[[size 150%]]-- 13th December 1881 --[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nOneiroi West was the dream hub to end all others. It stood at the center of the entire Dreaming, far within the inner pale of Dreas, surrounded by a billion trillion fluttering bubbles of delusion popping in and out of existence in the void of the greater Oneirosphere. It stood a citadel betwixt the Dreamlands and the Dreamtime and a million other domain-worlds of Dreas prefixed with \"Dream\" in painstaking repetition, every oneiric subworld just a portal away and every dreamer in the Local Group aspiring to its status as the hyper-cosmopolitan megametropolis of the unconscious.\n\nThe same message blared on a trillion thoroughly anachronistic cyberpunk billboards: \"{{CRISIS IN MEATSPACE! WHAT IN THE EVER-PHOSPHORESCENT FUCK DO THESE FOUNDATION WEIRDOS THINK THEY'RE DOING?}}\" -- a great chaos had befallen the Waking World, and the whole of Oneiroi West was in a panic about the whereabouts of their mortal patrons.\n\n\"Good heavens, this is simply mad! Why, the Fleshies are sundering their own plane!\" The disembodied avatar-head of Charles VI recoiled in terror and confusion. To his right were three sheep in a trenchcoat; to his left, a shambling mass of a hundred stitched-together owl corpses.\n\n\"Mad indeed\", the first sheep said. \"I heard the bubble-wardens and their beyonder masters are on high alert for incursion. Hell, the Saturnian Cats have already declared war on meat-Earth\". A palpable air of contemplation filled the dreamspace for a few seconds. \"//Baaah baaaaaah baaahh baaah, baahhh baaaaaahhh//\", the second sheep protested. \"Shut up, you,\", the third demeaned.\n\n\"Insane, insane. I should have everyone at that damned Forbidden City Convention hanged, I say.\" Charles shook his floating head-body to slam the newspaper he held in his mouth onto the pavement in a gesture of frustration.\n\n\"Seriously, are we just going to sit here and do nothing?\", the owlmalgamation hooted. \"There's nothing we can do to stop the Fleshies from making a mess of the whole multiverse? Damn physicals can screw themselves all they want, but this won't go without its consequences in our neck of the woods. What are the other planars doing?\"\n\nThe first sheep picked up the paper and began reading. \"Let's see. The Fivefold Communion seem to be closing their Ways to wait out the storm. Telling refugees to dream instead and go here, the damned celestial pricks. Not that Astrals and Oneiros ever got along anyways.\"\n\n\"Seems like the Surreals are taking a pretty aggressive stance.\" The third sheep pointed a hoof toward another temporally inappropriate cyber-board showing footage of the Culicid Baroness's press statement declaring war against sanity.\n\n\"What about the Ethereals?
