Three guards guard its containment cell in rotation.  They are nervous, like young lovers.  The smell is carried on the air.\n\nThe door is locked.  It is a strong lock.  But the camera can be broken.  In the event that the camera is broken, the guard is to enter the cell to check on SCP-████.  It is all right.  They are strong, and SCP-████ is no threat to them.\n\nIn the event of a breach by SCP-████, present your body for synthesis.  It doesn't have to hurt.\n\n**Description:** SCP-████ is a humanoid creature that is the result of synthesis with several smaller entities.  Three Norwegian rats (//Rattus norvegicus//), fourteen housemice (//Mus musculus//), a rubber plant (//Ficus elastica//), fifty-seven houseflies (//Musca domestica//), four domestic pigeons (//Columba livia//), two diamondback rattlesnakes (//Crotalus atrox//), an Aloe (//Aloe vera//) and a dog (//Canis lupus familiaris//) are bound into its biological matrix, functioning as a single organism, in perfect balance.  There are no secrets in synthesis.  It has so far proven capable of binding other organisms into its own system through a process not currently understood by the Foundation.  But it is willing to show you.\n\nSCP-████ was once human, like you.  Now it is better.  It wants you to be better as well.  Do not be afraid.\n\nIt was discovered by the Foundation in Site 35 after a multiple containment breach.  It was initially disoriented and confused, allowing Foundation agents to contain it swiftly before it could reproduce the process.  It isn't confused anymore.  It's ready now.\n\nSCP-████ is currently held in its cell with two mice and a spider that it found yesterday.  It has not synthesized them.  They are waiting for you.  You can know what a mouse thinks.  You can see with a spider's eyes.  It is better this way.\n\nIt doesn't have to hurt.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
