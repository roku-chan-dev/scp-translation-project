It's chamber requires sound dampening paraphernalia and a sound system capable of playing vinyl discs and a catalogue of cassette tapes.[[footnote]]There is substantial evidence that points to SCP-5578's consciousness existing on multiple wavelength frequencies. Our current metric understands that this experience is similar in stimulation to a massage chair. [[/footnote]] During standard hours of operation, SCP-5578 must be routinely inspected and provided with maintenance as necessary to preserve its function. Additional paper, lubricant, replacement parts; qualified repair personnel are to be kept onsite at all times in the event of a jam, mechanical failure, or other obstruction to its operation.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5578 is a Teletype Model 33 ASR (Automatic Send and Receive) electromechanical teleprinter. The machine has the ability to print messages dictated from a consciousness manifesting within the device. The anomaly does not require electrical power or a corresponding sending device in order to operate and will do so unimpeded as long as its other mechanical needs are met. Testing on the output of 5578 shows the paper and ink in its correct state with no anomalous qualities. It follows a ‘sleep cycle’ that begins at nightfall and ends at the next sunrise. This cycle persists independently of SCP-5578's exposure to timekeeping devices or sunlight.\n\nThe transcripts produced by SCP-5578 previous to its testing and subsequent designation were rambling and loosely formatted, seeming to be derived from domestic conversation interspersed with lines from music, literature, and popular media.\n\nAn example of SCP-5578's pre-discovery output can be found below:\n-----\n[[=image SCPVinny.jpg]]\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum #1\" hide=\"- Addendum #1\"]]\n**11/02/1991-** Site-67 researcher Kelgood began a series of tests following an adverse reaction from SCP-5578 on 03/05/1991. A Site-67 security guard had been monitoring objects under investigation for anomalous behaviors. At the time, said security personnel attempted to listen to a compact disk through the surveillance terminal. The officer had intended to route the album “Dr. Feelgood” to a tabletop speaker via a 3.5mm audio cable, but in error, played the music through the containment chamber's internal speakers instead. The music was active for approximately two minutes before corrected.\n\nWhen researchers recreated these conditions, SCP-5578 produced 168 characters per minute, significantly exceeding its traditional functional output limitation of ~100 characters per minute. A sustained outburst of exclamation points filled nearly ten feet of paper, and, moments later, SCP-5578 ceased to function entirely. Once the music was removed, standard function resumed, and SCP-5578 started to communicate again.\n\nThe object was reclassed as SCP-5578 and provided individual containment for further testing purposes. \n\nWhen tested in isolation, function became more robust and seemingly deliberate rather than the random strings it previously exhibited. After four months of testing, researchers became aware that the data being relayed was, in fact, from its own volition and conscious. After six months, this data became full sentences and could understand human speech. Head Researcher Kelgood was made aware and scheduled an interview, seeking to find the source of this anomaly.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum #2\" hide=\"- Addendum #2\"]]\n__**Transcription Provided by Dr. █████ Kelgood:  05/12/1992**__\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Kelgood:** How are we doing today, 5578?\n\n[[=image VinceDialog1-1.jpg]]\n\n[[=image VinceDialog1-2.jpg]]\n\n**Kelgood:** I just need to ask some basic questions.
