  "content": "**Personnel File**\n\n**Personnel Number: IS601** - //Systems Analyst Patrick Gephart//\n\n**Biography**\nMy name is Patrick Gephart, and I am a Class 1 Systems Analyst with a major in Information Systems, a minor in Computer Science, and a certificate in Networking. I was recruited by the SCP Foundation after discovering the Biological Networking Device, a wireless router with a connection to living beings.\n\nI have worked in the field as an agent and I have worked in the laboratories as a doctor, but I am not considered either of these professions. However, when it comes to mechanical or electrical systems, I am to be consulted before any major changes are to be made. I am slowly taking on more jobs but I am hurrying as fast as I can. You can reach me at any time with a page to my Personnel Number or contact via phone at (███)-███-████.\n\nCurrent SCPs Discovered (Working to Date)\n[[[SCP-379 |SCP-379: Mechanical Pheromone]]]\n[[[SCP-380 |SCP-380: Biological Networking Device]]]\n\n**Note:** Any technical issues of any sort should not be added onto my personnel file but may be placed in the [[[techissues |Technical Issues file]]]. Thank you.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
