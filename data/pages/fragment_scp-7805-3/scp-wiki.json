This is observed to occur whenever SDT-62 moves along the dimensional plane, with the item disappearing in the interim of two separate realities. SDT-62 cannot be entered even with applied force. It also has the ability to withstand an incredibly high amount of damage inflicted onto it. While speculative, SDT-62 is theorized to have the unique ability to travel through time in a similar fashion to interdimensional travel.\n----\n**Item Description:** SDT-62 is an interdimensional bus of a much older model than modern ones. It appears to originate from the past, yet shows no signs of deterioration both temporally and dimensionally. In our base reality: Dimension-6193EH, SDT-62 uniformly appears at Location-62.[[footnote]]62 miles SE of ##d5ffab|[DATA EXPUNGED BY GCP FORCE DUE TO INFORMATION WHICH MAY RISK A COMPLETE COLLAPSE OF ORDER WITHIN DIMENSION-6193C]##[[/footnote]] This location is not believed to exhibit any anomalous properties as observed through extensive testing (See **Tests-62/03-08**). SDT-62 is currently driven by George Pollen, an individual with no retrievable identity who researchers believe may have been create by SDT-62 itself. Following Test-62/31, SDT-62 no longer opens its doors to any individuals originating from Dimension-6193EH.\n----\n**Reason for classification as an SDT object:** SDT-62 has been classified as such due to the inexplicable nature of its appearance and its great withstanding of external forces.\n----\n= __**SDT-62 Gallery**__ [[/size]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-7805-3/sdt-62.jpg\n| caption=SDT-62 during Test-62/25\n| align=left]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-7805-3/location-62.jpg\n| caption=Location-62 directly prior to Test-62/07\n| align=right]]\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:scp-7805-3/frank_bordeo.jpg\n| width=150px\n| caption=Frank Bordeo during Test-62/29\n| align=center]]\n----\n= [[size 130%]] __**SDT-62 Test Logs (Abridged)**__ [[/size]]\n||~ Test # ||~ Instructions ||~ Findings ||\n||= 1 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG using SDT-62. _\n**Variable 1/2:** Travel to Dimension-6193EG three days into the past/future. || **Control** works as expected, albeit with minor hesitation due to the employment of much older communication systems. _\n**Variable 1** may have succeeded in traveling time, however exact temporal displacement is unknown.

Corp knowledge of how to travel through time using SDT-62 is being refined. _\n[{{Data of **Test-62/02/V2** has been deleted due to compromising information.}}] Following this, all attempts to travel to the future have been deemed too unsafe and are henceforth prohibited during testing. ||\n\n= [[size 130%]]Following orders from the Enforcers of Ethical Protocol (EEP), experimentation involving travelling on SDT-62 has been put on hold until further notice.[[/size]]\n\n||= 3 || **Control:** Photograph Location-62 from three different angles, ensuring details on Location-62's shelter is visible. _\n**Variable 1:** Using a blow gun, remove any dust or grime from Location-62's shelter.

Then, follow **Test-62/03/C**. || During **Control**, shelter appears to be a blue, old-fashioned bus shelter with typical deterioration as would be expected of a shelter with its presumed age. _\nAfter **Variable 1**, the shelter appeared to be reacting typical of the materials used to create a shelter of its design. _\nAfter **Variable 2**, the shelter reacted as normal. It is to be noted that Location-62's shelter is now in the need for a cleaning as the blood used has stained its outer walls. ||\n||||||= ... ||\n||= 6 || **Control:** See **Test-62/05/C**. _\n**Variable 1:** Using a blow torch, test the shelter's ability to withstand extreme heat.

No more experiments can be made on the shelter following this. ||\n\n= [[size 130%]]In light of an update to EEP regulation regarding SDT-62, experimentation involving traveling on SDT-62 has henceforth been allowed under the condition that updated EEP protocols are strictly adhered to.[[/size]]\n\n||= 8 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI using SDT-62. _\n**Variable 1:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI one day into the past using SDT-62. _\n**Variable 2:** Travel to Dimension-6193EI three days into the past using SDT-62. || **Control** works as intended. _\n**Variable 1** shows that the Corp are close to pinpointing how to temporally displace individuals riding SDT-62, with it resulting in individuals travelling to Dimension-6193EI one week into the past exactly. _\n**Variable 2** works similarly, however only temporally displaced people three hours into the past. ||\n||||||= ... ||\n||= 12 || **Control:** Travel to Dimension-6193EJ using SDT-62. _\n**Variable 1/2/3:** Travel to Dimension-6193EJ one week/month/year into the past using SDT-62 || **Control** works as intended. _\nWith use of the refined SDT-62 Temporal Displacement Guide,[[footnote]]**[ACCESS DENIED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT SECURITY CLEARANCE]** [[/footnote]] **Variables 1, 2** and **3** all worked as intended. The Corp are now putting in research to detect any continuity errors caused through temporal displacement through SDT-62. ||\n\n= [[size 130%]]While efforts to research continuity errors formed through use of SDT-62 are underway, experimental focus has now been placed on controlling the appearance and disappearance of SDT-62.[[/size]]\n\n||= 13 || **Control:** Record times of SDT-62's appearance at Location-62. _\n**Variable:** Park standard-sized motorized vehicle at Location-62 in the way of where SDT-62 usually apparates. || **Control** found that SDT-62 appears twice every day, once at 700 hours and at 1900 hours. _\nDuring **Variable**, motorized vehicle was parked at Location-62 at approximately 1840 hours. When SDT-62 appeared, it stopped behind the vehicle and acted as normal. Upon departing, it turned and overtook the vehicle. It appears that this had very little change in the behaviour of SDT-62. ||\n||||||= ... ||\n||= 17 || {{NOTE: Following rigorous testing to block SDT-62 from leaving Location-62 and hence disappearing, it appears we need to test other methods to control SDT-62.}} _\n**Control:** Allow SDT-62 to appear and disappear as normal and record findings. _\n**Variable:** On the road adjacent to Location-62, apply petroleum to ensure travel on road will result in a loss of control of vehicle. || **Control** works as intended. _\nUpon appearing after **Variable** was put in place, SDT-62 notably had no change in behaviour despite the change in road conditions. It is theorized that SDT-62 is not affected by reality, however this would directly contradict actions observed in **Test-62/13**. ||\n||||||= ... ||\n||= 21 || {{NOTE: After continual failed attempts to control SDT-62, experimentation on how to cause damage SDT-62 has begun.}} _\n**Control:** Analyse condition of SDT-62. _\n**Variable:** Strike the outer walls of SDT-62 with a hammer once the item comes to a halt and opens its doors. Then, analyse condition of SDT-62. || **Control:** SDT-62 appears to have no significant wear despite events from Tests-62/15-16 and its presumed age based on the old-fashioned model of interdimensional public transport it exhibits. _\nDuring **Variable**, hammer bounces back a significant amount after striking SDT-62. No damage is visible on the walls, however SDT-62 immediately after **Variable** closed its doors and drove away from Location-62 swiftly. ||\n||||||= ... ||\n||= 23 || **Control:** Analyse condition of SDT-62. _\n**Variable:** Use blow torch on outer walls of SDT-62 once the item comes to a halt and opens its doors. Then, analyse condition of SDT-62. || **Control:** SDT-62 appears as normal. _\n**Variable** causes no damage to exterior of SDT-62 and leaves in a similar fashion to Tests-62/21-22. SDT-62 appears to be extremely heat-resistant. ||\n\n= [[size 130%]]As a result of a new technological breakthrough, devices with the ability to prevent interdimensional travel have been reserved for use on SDT-62 during experimentation.[[/size]]\n\n||= 24 || Interdimensional Inhibitors are placed around Location-62 35 minutes prior to scheduled SDT-62 appearance. || SDT-62 behaves as normal until attempting to leave Location-62, after which SDT-62 loses all functionality and all personnel aboard item disappear through unknown means. ||\n\n= [[size 130%]]Following Test-62/24, SDT-62 has been transported to a garage located at Area-13 where physical tests on item will commence.

Any attempts to ride SDT-62 will be met with immediate forceful action up to and including termination. As of 17/6/2115, SDT-62 will continue to be documented as an SDT object due to its nature still being anomalous and unexplained despite our rigorous experimentation.
