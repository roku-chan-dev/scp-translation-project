Due to the nature of SCP-4952, no further containment measures are necessary beyond standard anti-trespassing measures.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4952 is a recurring event associated with the exit of a decommissioned motor-vehicle tunnel, a nearby sinkhole, and the section of road connecting the aforementioned points, located in Frost National Park, [[[SCP-4006|Massachusetts]]].\n\nSCP-4952 involves the following components:\n* SCP-4952-1 is a 1963 Chrysler 300, painted a light blue.\n* SCP-4952-2 is a human male resembling American poet Robert Frost as he appeared circa. 1910. SCP-4952-2 is seated in the driver's seat.\n* SCP-4952-3 are three corpses identical to SCP-4952-2 in appearance. SCP-4952-3 are seated in the back seats, secured with seat belts.\n * In approximately 0.8% of recorded cases, a single instance of SCP-4952-3 is replaced with SCP-4952-4, a corpse resembling American musician Mal Blum as they appeared circa. 2015.\n* In addition to SCP-4952-2 through -4, SCP-4952-1 almost always[[footnote]] 99.96% of recorded instances. [[/footnote]] contains three two-liter canisters of kerosene, five neutralized instances of [[[SCP-4065]]]-1, an assortment of electrical wiring equipment, four to seventeen photographs of various North American musicians or poets[[footnote]] Several of which appear to have been marked with a red X. [[/footnote]], several firearms, three briefcases containing approximately 15 million units of an unidentified currency[[footnote]] Composed primarily of plastic coins and banknotes printed on low-quality paper, utilizing Roman numerals. Banknotes appear to additionally feature classical depictions of the Archons in Sarkicism.[[/footnote]], and a single suitcase filled with damaged electronics of unknown make and function. A variety of miscellaneous office supplies may also be present between iterations.\n\nDuring an iteration of SCP-4952, SCP-4952-1 will emerge from the tunnel at approximately 110 km/h, striking the last and second-to-last iterations of SCP-4952-1 and -2; SCP-4952-1 and -2 of the second-to-last iteration will be knocked into the sinkhole and subsequently disappear. SCP-4952-2 inevitably survives its initial SCP-4952 iteration, although its previous iteration is killed upon impact. SCP-4952-2 initially displays shock, then frustration upon the conclusion of SCP-4952.\n\nNew iterations of SCP-4952 are triggered under any of the following conditions:\n* SCP-4952-2 attempts to remove SCP-4952-3 or -4 from either iteration of SCP-4952-1.\n* SCP-4952-2 attempts to examine the corpse of its previous iteration.\n* Any attempt is made to transport any physical component of SCP-4952 outside the boundaries of SCP-4952.\n* Any attempt is made by external actors to prevent the immediate recurrence of SCP-4952.\n* An external actor addresses SCP-4952-2.\n* 3 hours, 56 minutes, and 27 seconds have passed since the last SCP-4952 event.\n\nSCP-4952 was discovered on 21/03/1986, following a series of distress signals received by Foundation agents stationed in Frost National Park.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4951]]] | SCP-4952 | [[[SCP-4953]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
