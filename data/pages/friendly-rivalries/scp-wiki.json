However, as the North American regional head of the Department of Entomology and the most determined to get the position of Director of the Department, it was clear she had a lot of work. Constantly. From meetings to emails to orientations and everything in-between, there was always something to do. Although in the end, all this work was worth it for her as every step was one step closer to getting more funding and recognition for the department.\n\nThis meant that the hallways of Site-95 were always busy. This day was no different. Anne had just finished doing the paperwork for the budget for the Department, not a lot but they could survive with this budget. Finally, she had some free time in her office. She laid back in her chair and started having her daily mini-crisis of thinking if anything she had ever done had made an effect on anyone.\n\nThis was quickly interrupted when she heard a knock on the door. She grumbled quietly to herself thinking \"What now?\" before opening it. On the other end stood [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6220 SCP-6220-C] [[footnote]] SCP-6220-A is a deity claiming dominion over all Insects while SCP-6220-B is a deity claiming dominion over all Fungi. Dr Leroy Keiten is currently assigned as the head of SCP-6220. [[/footnote]], more commonly known as Dr Leroy Keiten.\n\n\"May I come in?\" he said in a tired tone, and he looked like it too.\n\n\"Sure.\" She was also too tired to argue with him.\n\nHe walked inside the office, minding the mountains of paperwork and strange, elaborate insects in cages everywhere. \"Take a seat. Or at least try to.\"\n\n\"Umm, I'll find a place,\" Keiten awkwardly replied before finding a beanbag and collapsing on it, minding his rhino beetle anatomy. He was spending one of his few precious hours away from the slavery of the other two insects, hoping to have a conversation. It was nice to talk to someone for Keiten, as it provided a distraction from the monotonous daily tasks he had to do.\n\nAnne knew this too. \"You sleep much?\" She always pitied him, but in the end, someone had to do it.\n\n\"Not really. Every day feels the same.\" He yawned. \"Like I just want some more freedom from them as I spend most of my day with those two, and then I have to do my duty as the Oceanian regional director as well.\"\n\n\"I feel the same.\" Of course, Anne could never feel the exact same way as Keiten as she wasn't a half rhino beetle slave researcher, but she was in an arguably worse position than Keiten as he at least was in the garden for most of his days.\n\nNow Anne loved her job. In fact, she wouldn't give up the world for it. It fulfilled her. But even she had to admit it got a bit tiring sometimes.\n\n\"You look terrible, when's the last time you had a vacation?\"\n\nThese words shocked her. She had barely been on vacation in all of her years working for the Foundation. Sure, she took business trips abroad, but those were rarely for pleasure. Site-95 was her home for as long as she could remember.\n\n\"A long time ago. I don't know if I can leave this place. Who will keep this place running? I still need to work for that promotion.\"\n\n\"The site will stay afloat on its own. Besides, you'll be able to relax for a short while.\"\n\nAnne had to admit that she needed a break, but it was unlikely that it would get approved.\n\n\"The Foundation would never let me take a vacation anyways, you know how they are.\" Anne sighed. \"HR would be on my back on it for months.\"\n\n\"I'm sure we could find a way, cause you need it.\"\n\n\"Too bad you definitely can't go. Must be even harder for you.\"\n\n\"I'll survive. See you later, I guess. I have to get back to work.\"\n\nKeiten left the room, leaving only Anne with her thoughts.\n\n----\n \nIt was a few days after this conversation, when Anne was yet again walking down one of Site-95's many underground hallways that she got stopped by one of the interns.\n\n\"Umm. Miss, there's a letter for you.\"\n\n\"Oh really?\" She was confused, why would there be a letter? Why couldn't they just send an email?\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDear North American Regional Director Anne Tina,\n\nYou have been selected for a one week transfer to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-169 Site-169] in Yavapai County, Arizona, United States for recreation work for [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6570 SCP-6570] as we have heard it has been not doing well recently.\n\nAs the headquarters of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomalous-entity-engagement-division-hub Anomalous Entity Engagement Division (AEED)], hopefully this will allow some relaxation time for 6570 as it has been so good recently. AEED Director, Amelie Rose Metanoia, will be able to help you if you have any other queries.\n\nYou will be able to also utilise the facility's equipment, but I am to remind you this is a business trip, not a vacation.\n\nThe plane leaves tomorrow.\n\nSincerely, Dir. Moses Feghoot, Site Director, Site-169.\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Keiten told me to give this to you,\" the intern chimed in.\n\nAnne was too busy thinking to herself to bother responding. //Seriously? Site-169? The other small, underfunded, weird department that thinks they are the most important people in the whole world. Why did Keiten choose them of all of the hundred or so sites in the Foundation?//\n\nObviously, she didn't actually hate the AEED, but they had somewhat of a friendly rivalry going on. Well, more of a one-sided rivalry.\n\n\"Uhh. Are you there?\" The intern was confused after seeing her pause for 30 seconds straight right after reading the letter, rightly so.\n\n\"Oh. Sorry about that, thanks for the letter. I guess.\"\n\nShe had no idea whether to be relieved or scared.\n\n------\n\nSoon enough, the day came and she was quickly escorted to a Foundation jet sitting near Site-95, which was strange as Site-95 didn't have a runway, just a large dirt patch. Despite that, the jet still took off towards Arizona in just under an hour, before she was put into a van and driven all the way to the middle of nowhere.\n\nShe got out of the van and into the desert heat. Despite being from Australia, she never got used to it.\n\nAnne trudged through the hill and towards Site-169. When she finally got there, she was met by Amelie Rose Metanoia, or Amy for short. Behind her was the facility in all its glory.\n\nThey looked each other up for a few seconds before talking.\n\n\"Hello! Welcome to Site-169.\"\n\n\"Oh hi there, has 6570 [[footnote]] An amorphous mass comprised largely of muscle and flesh, covering an approximated 12m2 area when stretched. X-rays have revealed bones and organs to be absent, aside from a single pair of lungs.\n\nDespite this, SCP-6570 has demonstrated a limited degree of sentience and can recognise faces, retain memories of positive and negative stimuli, can perceive visual stimuli, and is believed to enjoy social activities.  \n[[/footnote]] arrived yet?\"\n\n\"It arrived yesterday, we even got a room set up for it. It's been doing great right now. There are a few problems but it's going good. Want to come inside?\"\n\n\"Sure. Nice place you got here.\"\n\nThe inside wasn't anything special, the same white corridors they had back at Site-95. Along with most other sites at the Foundation. Although it was noticeably less chaotic then she expected with more of a laid-back atmosphere than most other sites.\n\n\"So over there is the mess hall or cafeteria, and to the right is the vehicle storage. We should be nearing the containment cells. We're all pretty cosy here.\"\n\n\"How's it like working here? Looks nice.\"\n\n\"Thanks. It's not too bad, but it's pretty different then most other sites. We also deal with bugs like you. Maybe I'll visit you one day.\"\n\nThey arrived at the room where SCP-6570 was kept, the whole mass of muscle and flesh. There were numerous toys and soft pillows. The room was a light pink and it had everything 6570 could ever want. It still missed 5566-ENTO as it was not able to come, but they set up a live video stream so they could still interact with each other.\n\n\"Wow! It looks comfortable. I think this will make it much happier.\" Anne was shocked at how good it was doing.\n\n\"I agree, sometimes you just need a rest from everything going on in the world. Why don't I show you downstairs? Some of the skippers and caretakers are playing a game.\"\n\n\"I would love to.\"\n\nSoon, they went down the stairs and into a large, brightly-lit room. There were all types of people there, Foundation staff casually interacting with anomalies. It was all so simple. And there in the middle, was a table, where some sort of card game was being played.\n\nDespite her still being stressed, despite not being allowed to interact with anomalies at most other sites, she ignored that. They were asking her to come over. It was warm, and friendly.\n\nAnd for the first time in a very long time, Anne smiled.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
