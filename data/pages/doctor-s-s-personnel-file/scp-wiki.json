  "content": "**Legal Name:** ██████ █████ ██████\n\n**Title:** Doctor S███████\n\n**Known pseudonyms:** Soulless, Soul, Solace, Solis\n\n**Profession:** General Researcher\n\n**Comments:** Lack of general moral fiber somewhat disconcerting. Has a fascination with any SCP's considered 'creepy' or 'frightening'. Sometimes needs to be reminded not to be excessive.\n\nDoctor S███████ has had at least fifty-seven failed attempts made on his life over a period of six months. Weapons used have included standard kitchen knives, a wide variety of firearms, several of Doctor S███████'s documented SCPs, fire, and an on-site nuclear device. Though no confirmed attacker has been found, extended hospitalization on his part, and several notes found in his office point to Researcher Gargus.\n\nAdditionally, Doctor S███████ has a large collection of cords scavenged from various places, each lovingly labeled with the date, month, hour, season, equatorial alignment, and humidity of the day of recovery. Doctor S███████ keeps the cords (being mostly of the extension, bungee, or spermatic variety) in his top left desk drawer.\n\n**Important Contributions to the Foundation:**\n[[[SCP-797]]] - \"The Curious Poltergeist\"\n[[[SCP-979]]] - \"Stoneware Rabbit\"\n[[[SCP-747]]] - \"Children and Dolls\"\n[[[SCP-1771]]] - \"Seasonal House\"\n[[[SCP-1551]]] - \"Repeating House\"\n[[[SCP-1252]]] - \"A Half-Formed Idea\"\n[[[SCP-1353]]] - \"Comforting Centipedes\"\n[[[SCP-2772]]] - \"Real Life Memorial For A Virtual Non-Existence\"\n[[[SCP-2552]]] - \"A Delusion's Desperation\"\n[[[SCP-2442]]] - \"Sometimes Therapy Is Merely Painful Truths\"\n[[[SCP-2992]]] - \"Everything Flows Towards Cadence\"\n[[[SCP-2882]]] - \"Overwriting Myself For A Faraway Dream\"\n[[[SCP-2662]]] - \"Cthulhu f'**UCK OFF!**\"\n[[[SCP-2909]]] - \"The Kind Of Neverland One Never Wishes For\"\n[[[SCP-2331]]] - \"**//SCRAVECROW//**\"\n[[[SCP-2353]]] - The Mannequin That Will No Longer Put Up With This Shit, Honestly\n[[[SCP-414]]] - \"Regardless, I Might Prefer Myself Sick\"\n[[[SCP-5995]]] - \"The Viper And The Newborn\"\n[[[From Unknown Admirer to Unknown Admiree]]] - A tale about [[[SCP-1204]]]\n[[[The Special Bond Between Child and Mother]]] - A tale about [[[SCP-1782 ]]]\n[[[Seasick Sharks]]] - A tale about [[[SCP-7475-J]]]\n[[[The Slow Asphyxiation of Undiluted Ardor]]] - A tale about [[[SCP-682-CU]]]\n[[[I Wish To Be An Asteroid, Burning To Nothing]]] - A tale about [[[SCP-1959]]]\n[[[The Melody Of Autumn, Passing Into Winter]]] - Dystopia entry involving the Scravecrow, Oneiroi, AWCY, and a rogue disco ball.\n[[[They Who Find Darkness Loving]]] - Avery and his pseudo-hallucination Ichor!Lament.\n\n**Projects:**\n[[[Senescence, Consumption, Persecution]]] - A tale for the [[[rat-s-nest-hub|Rat's Nest canon]]]\n[[[we-never-wanted-things-to-come-to-this|A Eulogic Elegy For The Dreams]]] - The dreams are dying.
