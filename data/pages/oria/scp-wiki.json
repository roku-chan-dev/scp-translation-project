I've come to realize this place as home as life goes on. \n\nMy time here has felt so short, and yet, it feels like it lasts forever. Every so often, I feel fragments of myself drifting away as the frigid, solar winds push me into the darkness. I shouldn't worry, my consciousness will live on, but this form won't.\n\nHowever, I've experienced many things in this form. I've seen unusual objects that others haven't: a collective of small raptors, a floating lobster, and even a bull god. They're unable to communicate correctly, but they managed to give me a word that defined who I am.\n\nOria.\n\nIt's an interesting name. My collective consciousness says it means \"the keeper of light\" and it means that in a literal sense.\n\nMy father had a similar name, his being Orion. From one of his stars, he gave birth to me as his successor. He told me he once was a hunter and was placed here. After my mother's physical form decayed, he predicted that she would be here, although it seems like that isn't the case. \n\nI'm very unsure about my father's whereabouts and I have little hope that my mother is out there. I'm assuming the last pieces of him are drifting about since he hasn't come back. All that's left in his place is me and the stars as I think silently.\n\nMy father once said to me that time is relative. Everything experiences time, but the effects differ with every sentient being. Time is an eternity to me. I'll live as long as the universe and see it fade away, but I hope to experience something new in the future.\n\nTill then, I sit in the darkness, waiting and hoping for my parents to return.\n\n@@ @@ _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[=]]\n…//ping//...\n\nI hear something from the darkness: a soft beating.
