SCP-5526 is to be fastened to the wall of the cell using Beryllium-Bronze chains. All SCP-5526-A instances produced by SCP-5526 are to be harvested by one D-Level Corporation intern every 12 hours (with a maximum leeway of one hour) and repurposed as paraweapons for forced civilian compliance. SCP-5526-B is to be incinerated upon manifestation. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5526 appears to be a man of middle eastern origins adorned with a crown, although simple scans for anomalous properties reveal it to be a \"Beelzebub\" Class Demonic entity originating from an alternate universe. Although such an asset would typically be utilized by the Corporation for Demo-thermic energy, SCP-5526 has several unique properties that make it more valuable for other uses. For instance, on SCP-5526's back is a quiver designed for holding 26 arrows, which produces instances of SCP-5526-A at a rate of roughly 2 per hour. SCP-5526 also has the ability to manifest a bow capable of firing SCP-5526-A.\n\nSCP-5526-A is the designation for a collection of arrows resembling those used in the Middle East in the 1st Century. Whenever one of these arrows is fired from a device intended to launch projectiles and reaches a speed of at least 30 KPH, the arrow will demanifest once it comes in contact with a sentient creature. This creature is now considered \"conquered\" by the person who previously fired the arrow. A \"conquered\" creature will then proceed to act subservient to the person who fired SCP-5526-A, and will listen to most of their commands, except for anyone that seems directly harmful to itself. This state dissipates after 168 hours. After this, the subject is unaware that the choices they made were not their own.\n\nSCP-5526-B is the designation for an abnormally large white //Equus ferus caballus//[[footnote]]Domestic Horse[[/footnote]] that manifests within an unoccupied area within 100 meter of SCP-5526 every 72 hours after expiring. Beyond this, SCP-5526-B has no other anomalous properties and has such been deemed unfit for Corporation use.\n\n**Use of Product:** SCP-5526-A has been to carry over it effects, as long as the projectile they are in, is at least 50% composed of the materials from SCP-5526. For practical usage, the bronze arrowheads of SCP-5526-A are to be melted down and made into a solution of 95% bronze, 5% zinc. Bullets are then to be created using a mixture of 52.5% of that solution and 47.5% standard brass, and used as a non-lethal option for Corporation Compliance Enforcers. \n\n**Discovery:** Historical records show that SCP-5526 was present in the Middle East as far back as 10,000 BCE, acting as the ruler of an ancient Arabic city-state, and manipulating SCP-5526-A to control it's rebellious population. SCP-5526 was overthrown by an unknown human, and driven to the Gobi desert. SCP-5526 was first discovered by the Global Ownership Corporation after the purchase of Marcus, Carter, and Darwin and the subsequent takeover of East Asia. Upon first encounter, SCP-5526 appeared to be nothing more than a standard Demonic Entity with some memetic properties. \n\nHowever, during a containment breach, the anomalous properties of SCP-5526-A were first noticed when several C-Level Outer Employees were affected by it. At the command of Chief Governing Officer Darke, SCP-5526 was then transferred to the Department of Compliance for testing. The details of these tests are below.\n\n**Test 5526-1:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A D-Level Intern is to be shot with an SCP-5526-A instance fired from a standard compound bow.\n\n**Result:** Intern is subservient beyond the extent of its standard memetic conditioning. \n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-2:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A fragment of SCP-5526-A is embedded into a bullet, and launched from a standard sidearm.\n\n**Result:** The bullet does not demanifest, and instead embedded itself in the Intern's shoulder. The Intern then bled out over a span of 28 hours before terminating (determined to be no different from standard termination time). \n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-3:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A bullet fully composed of SCP-5526-A is to be launched from a standard sidearm at a D-Level Intern.\n\n**Results:** The Intern acted subservient to the testing Employee, although the bullet appeared to fire less accurately, on account of being damaged in the gun.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-4:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A bullet composed 75% of SCP-5526-A and 25% brass is to be launched from a standard sidearm at a D-Level Intern.\n\n**Results:** The Intern acted subservient to the testing Employee, although the bullet appeared to fire slightly less accurately, on account of being worn in the gun.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-5:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A bullet composed 50% of SCP-5526-A and 50% brass is to be launched from a standard sidearm at a D-Level Intern.\n\n**Results:** The Intern acted subservient to the testing Employee, although the bullet appeared to fire slightly less accurately, on account of being worn in the gun.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-6:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A bullet composed of 25% of SCP-5526-A and 75% brass is to be launched from a standard sidearm at a D-Level Intern.\n\n**Results:** The bullet did not demanifest, and instead pierced the Intern's lung, terminating him after 11 and 1/2 minutes.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Test 5526-7:**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Procedure:** A bullet composed of 50% of SCP-5526-A, 5% zinc, and 45% brass is to be launched from a standard sidearm at a D-Level Intern.\n\n**Results:** The bullet demanifested, making the Intern completely subservient. No irregularities were noticed in the firing. As such, this mixture is the current one produced for use by Company Compliance Enforcers. \n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n> [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5526/offset/0|<- Previous Iteration]]] |   __Iteration 1__ @@ @@|[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5526/offset/2| Next Iteration -> ]]]\n[[/=]]",
