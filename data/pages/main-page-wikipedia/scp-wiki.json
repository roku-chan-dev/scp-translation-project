It is the first Akiva based reactor and first [# anomalous] power source to be used by the public after the [# Dissolution of the Veil Policy]. The Stein-III reactor also features prominently in the [# Whole Earth Campaign] organized by the [# Manna Charitable Foundation] as part of their yearly [# environmentalism] month, which saw great success in reducing [# carbon emissions] in [# North America].\n\nIn 2027, [# NPR Active Reporting] discovered [# controversial] information on the development and use of the Stein-III reactors. The SCP Foundation performed Akiva experimentation on large numbers of [# religious] artifacts and populations, specifically those that produced notable amounts of Akiva radiation during the 1990s. The artifacts were either borrowed from [# normalcy organizations] or stolen from various religious sects, and the populations were sourced from remote Southern Christian churches. Most of these experiments are ethically dubious, violating [# right to privacy], [# right to religious freedom], and [# right to ownership].

It is the single largest [# art gallery] showcase, hosting over two hundred unique artists per showcase. The goal of the event is to \"explore the limits of art, without regard ... to the constraints of physical reality\". The winner is awarded the [# Real Duchamp Prize], determined via a set of critics chosen by the host of the event, [# Ironic HANSARP]. The critics are given a set of abstract criteria (e.g. \"Which one do you think tastes the most like submerged rage?\" which was asked during the [# 2023 RAEMCG]), and asked to rate on a scale of [# five] to [# seven], which functions similarly to the [# up or down vote], with the addition of an ambivalence rating. Uniquely, the ambivalence rating is more akin to a conventional down vote, as the art was simply not impactful enough to leave an impression on the critic.\n\nThe RAEMCG is exceptional in that it allows very few express limits on what is allowed to be presented as art. This has resulted in several iconic artpieces, such as //[# Home]//, in which the artist, [# Adam Smalls], claimed the premises of The Oldest House and everything contained within as a part of his art, quoting \"my perception is reality\". This has also resulted in Ironic HANSARP being implicated in several crimes against humanity, among them, a live demonstration of [# summoning the Antichrist].
