Be sure to leave a comment with your thoughts![[/size]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Editorial]]\n**From the Editorial Desk -**\n\nTransparency in governance is something that we care a great deal about. We strive to showcase the vast majority of the actions Staff takes on [https://05command.wikidot.com/ 05 Command] and in the deletions threads. Obviously, keeping track of every single minor change is impossible, the records-keeping side alone of such things would often take longer than the change itself. So while we may not keep track of every staffpost we make in the forums or every time a staff member adds a title or a rating module to a mainsite piece, we do record all of the major decisions we make on that site.\n\nThere has been a great deal of conversation lately about transparency, because it is also important to showcase the reasons behind why we make the decisions that we make. While this is not always possible due to a wide variety of concerns, we do strive to give rationale behind our decision-making process whenever possible. Additionally, there is a fine line between transparency and an outright invasion of privacy.\n\nOur goal is to showcase the decisions we‚Äôve made, why we‚Äôve made them, and how we‚Äôre going about implementing them, but to do so in a way that doesn‚Äôt also impinge upon the privacy and mental health of the staff members who are volunteering to get the work done. While not all of you have had the opportunity to work in some sort of customer service capacity, a great many of you probably have. Those of you that have had that experience know first-hand how difficult it can be to maintain ‚Äúretail mode‚Äù day in and day out. Even the most extroverted and genial of people can find themselves facing burnout when working through such a thing, which is why there are staff rooms and vacations. \n\nThe SCP wiki is a project that we all love and engage in on many different levels. While some users have found ways to monetize their usage of the site through youtube, podcasting, etc., staff members do what they do entirely without monetary recompense. We do what we do out of a love for the site and a love for the community that we serve. In that vein, we try to find a balance between doing what we can to adequately respond to the transparency requests of the general community, while also attempting to foster a healthy and fun work environment for the people that work behind the scenes to ensure everything keeps functioning properly. \n\nWe will always do our best to provide everyone with as much up front information as we can about what‚Äôs going on behind the scenes. In fact, the revamp of the Site News to become even more of a way to showcase the doings of staff is a part of that effort. Even so, we will not always be able to provide transparency in a way that everyone will appreciate. Every day we discuss ways to improve, and I ask everyone to be patient with us as we work towards finding that perfect balance. \n\n\n-----\nThe Site News team:\n**Editors:** TSATPWTCOTTTADC & MalyceGraves\n**Reporters:** Naepic, The Pighead, WhiteGuard, DrAkimoto, Edna_Granbo, Hexick, & Limeyy \n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab News from the Fandom]]\n__The [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/ Polish Branch] had a GoI contest!__\n* //From BlazingPie over at -PL//: It was a team contest during which participants formed 3-person teams to write about a specific GoI originating from the Polish branch.

Today, I am wanting to talk about the Rewrite team with you. To begin, let's talk about what Rewrite does and what they have purview over. What do you all do over there and why does staff have a team dedicated to this task?\n\n> Well, Rewrite's job is to act as custodians over articles and tales whose authors haven't been around for a while! We try and do our best to preserve the site's history by giving people the chance to rewrite older things that aren't doing as well now as they did in the past. It'd be a shame to see a lot of stuff get deleted and disappear into the aether because the original author hasn't been around for the past five years, and we aim to address that! \n> \n> Despite the name though, not all rewrites pass through us! Only in instances where the author hasn't been around for at least a year do we get involved!\n\nAlrighty! As someone who helps maintain the staff rosters, I have of course noticed how small Rewrite is as a team. In fact, it is by far the smallest with only 4 members including yourself. Is the job just one that can be maintained by a small group then? What are the tasks you do personally within the team?\n\n> It used to just be one member a year ago! Unlike a lot of teams, we're in a position where most of our work comes from people coming to us about staff work. I know MAST is super forward thinking and forum crit always has their hands full managing the forums, but over in Rewrite it's mostly pretty quiet until a rewrite request comes up. \n> \n> I think for the most part it's something that can be done with this small team! We've definitely had our hands full this year, but we've been able to make it through with our newest member, stormbreath, who's been absolutely wonderful! As for me, I do a lot of the internal organisation, inter-rewrite/inter-site communication, and try not to let my opinions about what is and isn't an scp bias my Rewrite reviews! :p\n\nLovely! So moving on to you personally, you are a moderator and one who has been around for a while now. However, you did have a large break in activity. Would you mind taking us through a quick outline of your time on staff? Why did you decide to return?\n\n> Oh man, I'll do my best, but my memory's never been good and it's definitely a lot fuzzier than it was!\n> \n> I think I joined the site around 2013, after seeing a Containment Breach video on youtube (my greatest shame). Luckily I was too nervous to post most of my really bad ideas, like \"what if an MTF had SCP-447 for blood??\", so people mistook me for someone who knew what was going on?\n> \n> But uh, I guess I made a good impression and eventually I got inducted into the first-ever Junior Staff class, though JS at the time was more like what Operational Staff is now. I poked around, did staff work, got promoted to modship! That was very exciting! \n> \n> I think around 2015, though, I started to drop off from the site due to... just life taking precedence. I kept up with the friends I'd made and would check in every once in a while, but it wasn't till summer of 2020 that I got a message from a buddy inviting me to join the upcoming contest that I decided to stick my head back in. I guess I didn't realise how much I missed it, and staff was kind enough to let me back in (after some good natured ribbing about being JS haha). And yeah, that's the quick rundown!\n\nSince you are a member of Rewrite, I assume you have read a good number of rewrite attempts in the past. Which would you say was your favorite rewritten work that has passed your metaphorical desk?\n\n> You know, the original IRC rewrite channel name was Historians-Desk, speaking of metaphorical desks. Fun coincidence! \n> \n> How does the saying go? A gentleman never asks and a lady doesn't tell? I love all the rewrites that pass through our desk equally. \n> \n> My philosophy when reviewing rewrites is that I try to separate my personal opinions as much as possible from what feedback I give. I know that I've got some hot takes on SCPs, and ideally no one should have their rewrite denied because I'm unironically \"downvoted, can't wait to see it as a tale\"-ing them.\n> \n> So I try to focus on \"does this preserve the themes of the original article\" and \"how well does it execute on those themes\". Then once the rewrite is up and stable I'll go back and take a look and determine whether or not I personally like it.\n\nHaha fair enough. Alright, so to round things out, why don't you mention the thing that you love the most about the SCP Wiki? What articles would you recommend as a sort of first reading for any newbies out there wanting to get started writing for the site?\n\n> Aw geez. I think I'd have to say the SCP format itself. It's always an interesting puzzle to write the format properly, and I love an article that manages to tell stories by clever use of the format. Just like there's a lot of things you can do in film vs. the written word, there's a lot of awesome things you can do in the SCP format that just isn't possible in prose. \n> \n> I think a great example of this is SCP-3393-EX by Captain Kirby, which I think wouldn't this effective if it were written any other way. As far as good first reading articles... I'd love to tell you \"my stuff\", but I want to answer this honestly, so... not my stuff! It won't help anyone in getting started! \n> \n> I think recently created is a great place to start! There are a lot of great writers on the site right now, putting out lots of great work. I'm just really really bad at listing them. But my advice would be to start with the story you want to tell, or the theme you want to explore, or emotion you want to evoke. Start with that, and then think about how writing it as an SCP can help enhance that. See what's working for people on recently created! What strikes you as clever, what seems hokey. Writing is a process! Just don't look at top rated of all time, or I'll have to ramble about statistics at you.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Word from Staff]]\n\n**Staff News:**\n\n++++* __New Staffers:__\n\nIt was a quiet month as we did not pick up any new Junior Staff in May.\n\n++++* __Staff Changes:__\n\nJunior Staff Limeyy is now on [http://05command.wikidot.com/community-outreach-main Community Outreach] for the Site News Subteam!\n\n++++* __Updates from 05 Command:__\n\nModerator MalyceGraves started the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14080547/proposal-updates-to-the-appeals-process Updates to the Appeals process] proposal which addressed some discussion about clarifying our appeals process.

Given that there is precedent in chat for banning users for a year for immaturity, it was desired to implement a similar ban for the main site in the case of immature, but most likely non-malicious, spammers such as these. The proposal passed with unanimous approval on the condition that such bans would be publically logged.\n\nModerator aismallard followed up a request made to us that we never got around to implementing concerning [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-14108709/change-wiki-syntax-link-the-sidebar Changing the \"Wiki Syntax\" link in the sidebar].
