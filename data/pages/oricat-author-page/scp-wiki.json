Slightly Granola Sarkic, looking backwards.\n* Kadakúni tales: Another internet writer, [https://fialleril.tumblr.com/tagged/tatooine-slave-culture fialleril], developed an AU culture for Star Wars Tatooine. I decided that I wanted one of those things for myself, so I made one.\n* Klavigar Character Studies: Second-person point of view is difficult to pull off, sometimes, but I do think it serves well for characters that occupy a somewhat mythical role, where first-person would feel too intimate and grandiose, while third-person would feel too cold and would not permit the reporting of private thoughts and feelings.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=OriCat]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
