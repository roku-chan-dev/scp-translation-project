On average, a //Solis// is approximately 2.3 meters (7.5 feet) in height, and has enhanced combat abilities, including (but not limited to):\n\n* Partial Regeneration (See the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goc-supplemental-humanoid-guide PHYSICS Division Field Manual 13: Special Circumstances, Humanoid Threat Entities] for more information on Type Reds)\n* Increased muscular capacity, resulting in increased levels of physical strength and speed\n* Increased durability\n* Suppression of emotions such as fear and sexual attraction\n* Heightened metabolism, allowing for faster growth\n* Heightened reflexes and mental abilities\n* Innate skill with firearms\n* Resistance to thaumaturgy \n\nKTE-2957 is currently being utilized by the People's Empire of Southern China in the ongoing 8th Occult War.\n\n[[size large]]**Rules of Engagement:**[[/size]]\nDue to Section 2 of the UN-GOC Treaty of Sainshand, all sentient humanoid KTEs employed as soldiers are to be treated as prisoners of war when captured and given a Threat Rating of no higher than 3. Conflicts with KTE-2957 also create Second Mission concerns, and as such, all conflicts between KTE-2957-White-Cresentchild and UN/Allegiance forces are to be censored and re-worked to conceal the existence of parathreats.\n\nKTE-2957-White-Cresentchild have also been known to utilize other parathreats, namely TanGenT technology and devices capable of manipulating reality on a localized scale. As such, all recovered objects from KTE-2957 are to be studied and then destroyed, in compliance with the 5th and 4th missions, respectively. \n\nBoth mundane and anomalous means are effective against KTE-2957, although their natural resistance to thaumaturgy and their regenerative abilities can reduce the effectiveness of certain liquidated methods. The preferred method is the use of MK-VII Coalition +2Gen Rifles fitted with an M203 grenade launcher attachment, armed with either incendiary or acidic rounds (to counteract the regenerative abilities) or high explosive rounds. Due to their resistance to thaumaturgy, TanGenT Technology is less effective against KTE-2957-White-Cresentchild, although will work in absence of better methods.\n\n[[size large]]**PSYCHE Records:**[[/size]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n||~ Parathreat Investigation||\n\n__**Special Observer:**__ \"Silkworm\" U8234710/J82\n\n __**Overview:**__ A breed of genetically modified soldiers with mild parathreat abilities may be in development by the Chinese Empire.\n\n __**Parathreat Evidence:**__ The PESC Ministry of Defense has released a statement saying they have \"changed the future of warfare\".

We dropped behind enemy lines in a surprise attack and did substantial damage before they managed to get into a defensive position.

If you wish not to answer any of the questions, you don't have to.\n>\n> **Chinua:** Oh...Ok.\n>\n> **Hal:** So first, a few questions about yourself. First off, who are you? Or, more accurately, how did you come to be at Nx-901?\n> \n> **Chinua:** Ok. I... I'm originally from Mongolia. I'm a... well, you'd probably called me a sarkoform. My \"fathers\" were a neo-sarkic couple, and since they couldn't have a normal child, they created me. //Chinua pauses.// After a while, I got fed up with the sarkic lifestyle and struck out on my own. After a while, I stumbled upon the monastery. \n> \n> **Hal:** And about how long ago was that?\n> \n> **Chinua:** I'd have to say about 2 years ago. I'm still a //śrāmaṇerikā//, myself.

About when did the Threat Entities reach the nexus?\n> \n> //Chinua says nothing and begins to shake visibly//\n> \n> **Hal:** If you don't want to answer-\n> \n> **Chinua:** No. It's fine. It was about ... 3 or 4 days ago? The monks and nuns thought the wards would hold them off but... they just walked right through it.\n> \n> **Hal:** Really? Well, what happened next.\n> \n> //Chinua takes a deep breath.//\n> \n> **Chinua:** They entered the temple and demanded we surrender. They said they would take everything in the temple for the glory of the Empire, and in return, they might let us live. One of the monks, I think it was Daivika, asked them if they might leave us alone and... and... //Chinua begins to sob.//\n> \n> **Hal:** It's alright. Just take a deep breath. \n> \n> **Chinua:** They just started shooting. Most of the monks managed to hide or run away, but I hadn't been instructed in the True Teachings yet. I ran into a back room and hid. I thought they wouldn't find me. But then...\n> \n> **Hal:** Yes?\n> \n> **Chinua:** One of them... found me. And... I killed him. I didn't mean to.

Currently, a 97% chance exists that the People's Empire of Southern China will make an attack against the Allegiance of Freedom using KTE-2957-White-Cresent within the next few days. There is uncertainty, however, about where they will attack. There is a 11% chance that they will strike at the Mongolian border. There is also a 24% chance that they will strike at Japan and the Confederation of Pacific States. However, the most likely occurrence is a strike against the Eastern League, namely the New Republic of Western China, at a 62% chance. If they choose to strike against the Eastern League, our greatest chance of success is to utilize [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/project-roc-part-1 J-CEAD-04 \"Zagerus\"], which is currently stationed within the Eastern League.
