At the site directer's discretion, it can be covered with a waterproof tarp or accommodated in an empty large hangar in case of severe weather exceeding average rainfall.\n\nThe containment area of SCP-295-KO must adhere to safety regulations according to the Foundation's standard reactor handling protocols. Radiation emissions and nuclear material leaks must be continuously monitored, and personnel accessing the entity must be equipped with radiation-shielding hazmat suits. The containment team must include zookeepers and veterinarians, providing professional management to ensure that SCP-295-KO does not exhibit aggression or leave the containment area.\n\nPast containment procedures and related records of SCP-295-KO must be preserved. If SCP-295-KO escapes containment and enters into prolonged flight, past procedures must be restored to continuously monitor SCP-295-KO's flight path, eliminate surrounding threats, and respond accordingly. Under no circumstances should SCP-295-KO be destroyed in areas or airspace where civilian damage is anticipated.\n\nResupplying fuel and repairing parts for maintenance is almost permanently unnecessary. \nThe next expected repair cycle is in the year 1,306,600 AD.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n**Description:** SCP-295-KO is a nuclear-powered strategic bomber developed by the Soviet Union during the Cold War. SCP-295-KO was equipped with numerous anomalous devices to deliver nuclear weapons while evading the surveillance assets and air defence networks of enemy forces. Multiple sources confirmed the involvement of the GRU Division Psychotronics(Referred to as GRU-P) in the development process.\n\nSCP-295-KO was produced solely for testing purposes as a single unit, and due to the project's failure, no sister or subsequent models were produced. The Foundation currently secures this single aircraft under the Mobile Air Force's management, located in Area-44 in Australia. The Soviet Union expunged a significant amount of relevant material. The information provided below has been reconstructed through statements collected from defective engineers from the Tupolev Design Bureau, supplemented by various circumstances and additional materials.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"box1\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-295-ko/scp-295-ko-blueprint.png\n|caption=Reverse-engineered blueprints of SCP-295-KO, created by the 1st Aviation Maintenance Depot based on the publicly available blueprints of the Tupolev Tu-95 bomber.\n|width=100%]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIn 1961, the Tupolev Design Bureau developed the Tu-119, a nuclear-powered experimental aircraft, by modifying their primary strategic bomber, the Tu-95. Whether the Tu-119 merely reached the stage of test-mounting a nuclear reactor on an aircraft or advanced to the level of actually applying a thermonuclear jet engine as its propulsion system remains unclear. However, by the time of its last test flight in 1969, the Tupolev Design Bureau had identified the following issues:\n\n* The internal space is even more cramped than a submarine, limiting the activity of the operating personnel and the amount of in-flight time used for operation.\n\n* The aircraft's empty weight increased as radiation shielding apparatus was installed for the safety of the operating personnel, which in turn reduced the armament load capacity.\n\n* Like the original Tu-95, it produces loud noise, making detecting and endangering the aircraft easier.\n\nIn addition, the original goal of developing a nuclear-powered strategic bomber, which was to enable nuclear attacks on the mainland of enemy nations, had already been achieved through intercontinental ballistic missiles. Therefore, despite some achievements, the development plan for the Tu-119 was cancelled. The prototype and related documents were to be disposed of, but the GRU Division P secretly contacted the Tupolev Design Bureau to encourage the resumption of the project. The improvements proposed by GRU-P and were implemented were as follows:\n\n* Introduce a rudimentary analogue artificial intelligence based on analytical engines to automate the overall operation of the aircraft. The aircraft's power is obtained from the reactor, which implements automatic flight and targeting functions and receives launch commands from outside. A link with [[[SCP-1984]]] was considered, but it was not implemented in the test phase. Automation permanently solved the operation time loss due to crew fatigue, reduced the need for radiation shielding, and allowed more space to be allocated to reactor safety and armament loading by reducing the living space.\n\n* Equip with a Ж-type cognitohazard appearance fluidisation thaumaturgic device to disguise the exterior of SCP-295-KO as an animal, thus evading enemy surveillance networks. Similarly, it obtains the necessary power from the reactor and drives the Ж-type device by converting power to ARAD through the Everhart resonator. SCP-295-KO was planned to be operated by disguising itself as a large bird, such as the albatross (//Diomedea exulans//) from the moment it left Soviet airspace, secretly flying over hostile territories such as the United States and Europe. This method was known to have completed multiple actual trial flights. This feature was expected not to interfere with the aircraft's size or function, as it only changes the perceived appearance.\n\nAfter such modifications utilising anomalous technology, the improved Tu-119 No. 2 underwent test flights for five years from 1969, testing its safety and performance. By 1973, it achieved significant success, including completing a test that involved circumnavigating the Earth and returning using solely a thermonuclear jet engine. From the end of December 1973, the Tupolev Design Bureau was preparing for test flights with actual nuclear warheads onboard to finally verify its operational capabilities.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"box2\"]]\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-295-ko/scp-295-ko-bear.jpg\n|caption=SCP-295-KO's picture after safely landing after securing.\n|width=100%]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIn January 1974, the Soviet military scrapped the Tu-119 project altogether, including any follow-up projects. This decision was based on the exorbitant costs of the project compared to the marginal effectiveness and nuclear deterrence capabilities when compared to conventional nuclear weapons, such as ICBMs. Consequently, the decommissioned Tu-119 No. 2 was to be dismantled to remove the reactor, nuclear warheads, and anomalous equipment.\n\nOn January 21st of the same year, the development and inspection team discovered the experimental aircraft was missing when they visited the parking ramp of the Ukurainka Air Base to dismantle the Tu-119 No. 2. Shortly after, a brown bear (//Ursus arctos//) was spotted on the runway and soon took off into the air, heading south.\n\nAfter flying over the Mongolian People's Republic, the People's Republic of China, and over the Pacific, the bear was soon detected by the Mobile Task Wing Delta-61. The bear was immediately designated as SCP-295-KO. Over the next 26 years, it posed a significant threat to the veil and regional security as it flew over the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\n\nAt the time, the Mobile Air Force had to monitor the SCP-295-KO's course and location around the clock, making efforts such as deploying tactical aircraft to intercept and divert its course towards international waters, if necessary, to minimise its civilian detection. Alongside these efforts, research was conducted to identify SCP-295-KO. However, it proved unsuccessful, as attempts to secure flight records before its initial detection yielded no results. SCP-295-KO showed extreme aversion to the approach of other aircraft, making it impossible to get close enough to gather clues.\n\nIn 1991, the USSR collapsed. During this period, engineer Andrey ███ █████, who had collaborated with GRU-P at the Tupolev Design Bureau, joined the Foundation. Based on his statements, the Mobile Air Force determined that SCP-295-KO was the Tu-119 No. 2 that took off from Russia in 1974. Knowing that SCP-295-KO was an aircraft, the Mobile Air Force -- although the target was an unmanned drone -- periodically attempted to communicate with it to persuade it to surrender and land.\n\nOn May 3rd, 2000, SCP-295-KO, flying over northern Australia, suddenly lowered its altitude and approached Area-44. Unusually, SCP-295-KO mostly ignored the Foundation's aircraft intercept manoeuvres and entered the airspace of R5 Great Sandy Airfield, eventually landing safely after several attempts. Immediately after landing, SCP-295-KO wandered off the runway into nearby grasslands. Soon, the containment team responded and successfully relocated the subject to the open-air apron.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nThe Ж-type cognitohazard appearance fluidisation thaumaturgic device used in SCP-295-KO was initially developed by GRU-P to camouflage vehicles or individuals. It is reported that minimising attempts were unsuccessful due to power requirements; hence, it was diverted for use in SCP-295-KO. However, when data on terrestrial animals entered during initial development was removed, the device failed to operate correctly. This led to a temporary workaround by adding some avian data to the initial version before it was installed in SCP-295-KO. This is presumed to be why the subject could appear like a brown bear.\n\nFurthermore, the Ж-type device did not receive safety tests for long-term operations over a year. SCP-295-KO retained the appearance of a brown bear for 26 years, and had not only its perceived appearance but also its actual identity change to that of a brown bear due to a misapplication of the fundamental principles of thaumaturgy[[footnote]]. The law of contagion and similarity. Summarised as \"the part affects the whole\" and \"similarity results in similarity\".[[/footnote]]. As a result, SCP-295-KO transformed into a fully grown adult brown bear, from its physical structure to its occupied volume. Research findings indicate that SCP-295-KO's biological processes, including cell division and metabolic activities, match those of a brown bear.\n\nNotably, despite such changes, SCP-295-KO preserves the functionality of a nuclear-powered strategic bomber. It can still fly and fire its weapons, and its reactor is fully functional, which obtains the energy used for life activity as a brown bear. SCP-295-KO's 3-megawatt compact reactor has 50 cores with 400kg of concentrated uranium each. Approximation[[footnote]](500GJ/kg × 400kg × 50) ÷ (21000 kJ/day × 365 days) = 1304631 years. The cores were inserted in 1969. Therefore, will exhaust in 1,306,600 AD.[[/footnote]] suggests that SCP-295-KO could survive for a virtually infinite amount of time as a lifeform.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
