The CONFEDERATION is a collection of independent organizations and civilizations collected under the singular cause of regulating and allowing safe and easy multiversal travel. All aspiring members are required to contact one of the member organizations or universes.

It is advised that your organization watch for any subversive groups or individuals, as they are plentiful and liable to cause damage to the integrity of the CONFEDERATION. A guide to identifying subversive individuals is below.[[footnote]] A full list of known and suspected Subversive Organizations can be acquired on request.

Jacob sits up, rubbing his arms as he tries to drive the remaining feeling of tiredness from his body. He stretches, taking a sip of the day-old cup of water next to his bed. He had come to visit his family, to see how they were during the holiday season.\n\nHe opened up his phone, sending a message to his confidants in the Neo-Insurgency. Branded after some rebellion buried by the sands of time, and probably some well-placed money.\n\n> **##green|MagesAwakening:** hey guys, stay safe today. merry christmas for all you who celebrate it##\n\nHe smiles to himself, before lying back down in his bed. It's Christmas, he's allowed to sleep in a bit. A present to himself, maybe. To himself, he thinks about what made them brand him like a rabid wolf. It takes a moment, but it was //probably// the fact he sent a few of their soldiers that were just killing people where they were occupying into various Apocalypse-Timelines. Yeah. That sounds about right.\n\n+ BANG.\n\nShit. Oh shit. Fuck.\n\nHe didn't think they would be able to track him so easily during a two day stay.\n\nBut then they hit the front door once. It was loud and hard, like a sledgehammer, or a battering ram. Two more hits, then the sound of charging laser weapons. They readied themselves outside of the room, yelling inside.\n\n\"Come out,\" said the voice, \"and we'll make sure your family doesn't get hurt.\"\n\nJacob thinks to himself, reaching under his bed and finding a page of magic that he brought with him in case of the worst. The Hand kept him well armed for the threat of the Jailers. He stuffs it under his coat, coming out with his hands raised in the air. They pat him down, not noticing anything out of place.\n\nBeginning to lead him out of the family apartment, Jacob notices the open bedroom doors. Nobody was inside. Absolutely nobody. They must've been evacuated or escorted away. They begin to shackle him, as he reaches into his coat pocket to reach for the spell--\n\nA laser bolt shoots straight between his eyes, a searing hole left where his brain should've been, instantly cauterized by the pure energy of the weapon. Jacob Monroe of Universe B11 collapses, dead.\n\n...\n\n[[size 95%]] Jacob Monroe awakes. He isn't sure what to do. He had just returned to his home Universe of C12 after an expedition to various apocalyptic universes. He was looking for ways to recruit more Freedom Fighters against the Universe-Jailers. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] But they had found him. He wanted to be closer to his family so that he could easily hop over for a few hours on Christmas. The motel was swarmed by them, Confederation Agents and MTF, the \"Multiversal Terrestrial Fighters\", were preparing to take the motel for him. He wonders how many of the recruits are just kids who got drafted in for the promise of food and infinite shelter. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] It doesn't matter, at this point. He grabs his tome of spells, whispering an incantation to create a barrier around the motel. It takes a moment of careful recitation, but he is able to manifest it. Nobody will be able to enter. He has no idea how long it will hold, so he locks the doors for good measure and begins reciting another spell-- One to take him back to the Library. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] The laserfire begins almost immediately. Jacob reads, trying to repeat the words perfectly, but he keeps messing it up. He can't focus at all. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] The barrier shatters. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] The laserfire pierces the building. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 95%]] Jacob Monroe of Universe C12 collapses onto the alcohol and piss stained motel carpet with thirteen fatal wounds and forty-nine nonlethal. [[/size]]\n\n...\n\n[[size 90%]] Jacob Monroe awakes, stretching his arms as wide as he possibly can. He has to get ready for the dead-end job he's placed himself in. The cars aren't going to be assembling themselves. He's not too knowledgeable on the whole politics of the world, but he'd be damned if he didn't know something was going on. Lot of talk about spaceships. He makes a mental note to check the news when he gets home-- He hasn't had time with the work he's been having to put in. Somethin' about a \"F194\", whatever the hell that means. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] He walks into the factory, taking his place in the line and giving a wave to his co-workers. They make a few japes at him, asking where he's been. \"Yeah, yeah,\" He mutters, \"I know the boss would've had my ass if he bothered to show up on time. I'm a minute late, y'bastards.\" He snorts out a laugh, elbowing the guy next to him and getting to work. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] A whistle is heard for a moment, growing louder and louder, until everything cracks and flashes. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] Jacob's vision flickers in and out. He's under rubble. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] He can see co-workers running to the exit. They open the door and blasts of energy, their buzz of charging energy and distinct whish through the air can be heard. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] Somebody's boots, bearing the initials \"M.C.T.\". They're right in front of him. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 90%]] Then it all goes black. [[/size]]\n\n...\n\n[[size 80%]] Jacob Monroe, assistant secretary to the Universe Ψ443 Confederation Liaison, types at his desk. He's gotten a few termination reports he's had to forward to his boss. A part he //always// enjoys is combing over the details of it, the traitor and details on their execution. Lot of Jacob Monroes in the multiverse, apparently. It's not a super uncommon name, but he must be a universal traitor to the Confederation. 1,114 after-action reports concerning a \"Jacob Monroe\" have been filed. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]] The only good traitor is a dead traitor, he supposes. He sips from his coffee, before hearing the call of his name over the P.A. Boss wants to see him, apparently. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]] He heads in, giving the Liaison a salute. She gives a half-hearted salute, obviously overworked, and a smile. There's a buzz that Jacob can't identify. \"Do you know why I called you in, Jacob?\" [[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]] \"No, Ms. Starr. What's the situation?\" His shoulders fade into ease from the attention he was standing at, before snapping back as she shoots him a glare. [[/size]]\n\n[[size 80%]] \"It's unfortunate that I have to be the one to break this news to you, but, we're going to have to make some adjustments to your schedule.\" Jacob tilts his head, before realizing what the buzzing noise was, as a blast of energy shoots through his chest. He feels the liquification of his organs from the blast, as his boss steps out from behind her desk. \"It seems I misjudged the power of an energy weapon. Goodbye, traitor.\" She huffs, dropping the battery from the pistol and inserting another, the buzz slowly creeping to a conclusion, timed to the black stains around the edge of Jacob's vision finally closing in. [[/size]]\n\n...\n\n[[size 70%]] Jacob Monroe wakes... [[/size]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
