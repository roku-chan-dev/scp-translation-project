It's looking at me funny.\n> \n> **Carl:** Whatever do you mean?\n> \n> **Paul:** The statue. Right there. It's in the middle of our living room.\n> \n> **Carl:** Oh, that! I thought that was a mountain.\n> \n> **Paul:** Mountains don't fit in houses!\n> \n> **Carl:** How do you know that?\n> \n> **Paul:** I don't! How'd you even get this here?\n> \n> **Carl:** I didn't bring it here. For once I am innocent.\n> \n> **Paul:** Then why is it looking at //you??//\n> \n> **Carl:** Must be my legs.\n> \n> **Paul:** Where did you get this from?\n> \n> **Carl:** My nice, sexy legs.\n> \n> **Paul:** Answer me, Carl.\n> \n> **Carl:** It came out of a top hat I was using for a magic trick.\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** Fine. I broke into a place called Site 19.\n> \n> **Paul:** How'd you do that? You don't even have thumbs.\n> \n> **Carl:** I used an egg sandwich and a mattress tag.\n> \n> **Paul:** What even is this thing?\n> \n> **Carl:** I don't know. I've tried eating it and it's just made of stone and paint.\n> \n> **Paul:** Why would you break into somewhere and eat what you find?\n> \n> **Carl:** Because the egg sandwich wasn't enough.\n> \n> **Paul:** I'm not listening anymore.\n> \n> (Paul turns before Carl blinks.)\n> \n> **Carl:** Woah! That thing just moved.\n> \n> **Paul:** What? I turned my back for one second. What'd you do?\n> \n> **Carl:** I sunk a cruise ship 4 days ago.\n> \n> **Paul:** I didn't mean that!\n> \n> **Carl:** Then what did you mean?\n> \n> **Paul:** Why did it move?\n> \n> **Carl:** It had to follow its destiny.\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** It slipped on the floor.\n> \n> **Paul:** Be honest with me.\n> \n> **Carl:** I don't know! It probably noticed //your// legs.\n> \n> (Paul turns around, seeing the statue in front of him.)\n> \n> **Paul:** Oh God.\n> \n> **Carl:** Yeah, this was probably my fault.\n> \n> **Paul:** You don't say?\n> \n> **Carl:** At least I didn't bring back the other thing I found.\n> \n> **Paul:** What was it?\n> \n> **Carl:** Some [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-096 pale guy], long arms. I looked at him for one  second and he went crazy.\n> \n> **Paul:** I'm so disappointed in you.\n> \n> **Carl:** Well that's mean. Now I kind of wish I brought that pale guy back.\n> \n> **Paul:** I'm not talking to you anymore.\n> \n> **Carl:** Well, that's rude. I'm disappointed in you now.\n> \n> (Banging at the door.)\n> \n> **Paul:** Who's that?\n> \n> **Carl:** Probably the pale dude.\n> \n> **Paul:** What? Why?\n> \n> **Carl:** Maybe it's the statue's best friend.\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** Well, I didn't know.\n> \n> **Paul:** You're just being awful today.\n> \n> **Carl:** I stole this yesterday.\n> \n> **Paul:** I'm not even shocked at this anymore.\n> \n> **Carl:** Fine, I'll go answer the door. \n> \n> **Paul:** You go do that, Carl.\n> \n> (Carl walks to the door as Paul is stuck looking at the statue.) \n> \n> **Carl:** Has it moved again?\n> \n> **Paul:** Not yet!\n> \n> (Carl walks back.)\n> \n> **Carl:** Yep, it's that crazy guy.\n> \n> **Paul:** I think you should keep the door closed, Carl.\n> \n> **Carl:** Fine.\n> \n> **Paul:** So, what should we do with this thing?\n> \n> **Carl:** Sell it to an art museum. \n> \n> **Paul:** I was thinking give it back.\n> \n> **Carl:** No way, we could get so many dead bodies with this.\n> \n> (Pause.)\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** Fine, I'll give it back.\n> \n> **Paul:** No, I'm giving it back. \n> \n> **Carl:** Bad idea, Paul. They had lots of guns back there.\n> \n> **Paul:** Fine. Well, did you do anything else there?\n> \n> **Carl:** I killed some people and ate some paper.\n> \n> **Paul:** Oh.\n> \n> **Carl:** I mean, it was [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-085 screaming] as I was eating it.\n> \n> **Paul:** The people or the paper?\n> \n> **Carl:** What do you think? It was the paper.\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaarl! What have I told you about eating things that scream?\n> \n> **Carl:** The egg sandwich wasn't enough.\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** You're right. You've told me not to do it.\n> \n> **Paul:** Right. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to find a way to give this statue back.\n> \n> (Paul starts pushing the statue out of the house.)\n> \n> **Carl:** Yep, he's going to get slaughtered out there.\n> \n> **Paul:** I can hear you, Carl!\n> \n> **Carl:** Sorry.\n> \n> (Paul exits the house, screaming.)\n> \n> **Paul:** Caaaaaaarl!\n> \n> **Carl:** I told you, Paul!\n> \n> (Ending theme.)\n--]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
