All Foundation personnel with level two clearance or higher are permitted testing of SCP-6309 at the discretion of the site director.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6309 is Junior Researcher Mary Name’s resignation letter. SCP-6309’s anomalous abilities manifest when it is damaged in any capacity, after which it will anomalously repair itself to its original state after a period of ten minutes.\n\n**Discovery Log:** SCP-6309 anomalous capabilities were discovered after being placed in a paper shredder by Dr. Name. One hour after its presumed destruction, Dr. Name returned to empty the contents of the paper shredder and discovered SCP-6309 intact.\n\n**Addendum:**\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-6309-A\" hide=\"- Addendum-6309-A\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Formal Resignation Notice**\n[[/=]]\nget out of my head\n\nget out of //my// head\n\nWhen I say //my// head, I mean mine. Not Dr. Name’s, not stop1010’s, not anyone else’s,  mine.\n\nFor the past year, four months, and twelve days, there has not been one where I haven’t thought about you. I hate it. I don’t hate //you//, I just hate how you’re everywhere I go.\n\nEvery time, without fail, anytime I read or watch a piece of fiction, the first thought I think is “Wow, that would be a good SCP!”\n\nEvery. Time.\n\nMore than that, even when doing mundane tasks I can’t stop thinking about you. I’ll be looking at a door knob and think, “What if that knob became the dot in PONG, bouncing off the sides of the door frame? That would be an interesting article!”\n\nSometimes, I’ll have dreams, not of an SCP or anything, but of me writing an SCP or thinking of a concept for an SCP.\n\nI do not like doing any of the things listed here.\n\nI’m sure you’re wondering now, “Hey, if you don’t like it, why don’t you take a br-”\n\nI already did that. Nothing has changed.\n\nI do not enjoy writing 99% of the time anymore. It is painful. It hurts to write. \n\nEvery time I’m not writing about you, I want to be. Every time I’m writing about you, I don’t want to.\n\nI do not know why I still think about you. I don’t want to. I want to move on with my life. It is painful to think about you. Yet I still think about you anyways.\n\n----\n\nThis is such a stupid fucking idea. I come up with some dumb little phrase and waste a day writing an article. Actually, I wouldn’t even call it “writing.” I wrote three paragraphs and spent the rest of the day //thinking// about writing this article.\n\nThe procrastination didn’t stop yesterday either. I spent the entire day listening to music and pretending the lyrics were about this article I haven’t written yet. You were in my head the whole day.\n\nIt’s the middle of the night now and I’m finally getting this over with. \n\n**Item #** SCP-6309\n\n**Object class:** I don’t know. That’s the point. I’m trying to find out what this is. \n\nLet’s just go with “Uncontained” for now.\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** I have no idea. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6309 is a memetic phenomenon that has only affected me. --I will now only refer to myself as SCP-6309-1.-- [[footnote]] Well, that’s just plain unnecessary. Not only is it confusing, it distracts from the point. SCP-6309 affects //me//. Calling myself anything else will make containing this thing actively harder. [[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6309 takes the form of persistent intrusive thoughts of the SCP wiki, even when none are desired. Experiences of SCP-6309 exponentially increase over a period of approximately 1.5 years.\n\nI have reported spending, at minimum, seven hours per day experiencing SCP-6309.\n\n----\n\nI’ve been thinking about this a lot, and I think writing this is a bad idea. I’ve been spending way too much time thinking about how to make this into an interesting article that people like. \n\nThen I asked myself,\n\n“Do I want this to be a good article, or do I want you to take this seriously?”\n\nIt may be disappointing for both of us, but I think I know how to contain this thing now.\n\nMaybe a bit of disappointment is what I need right now.\n\nYou know what you need to do.\n[[/div]]\n[[/Collapsible]]\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n[[Collapsible show=\"+ Addendum-6309-B\" hide=\"- Addendum-6309-B \"]]\nOn 2/13/2022 at approximately 5:31 AM, SCP-XXXX and Dr. Name  [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3309| spontaneously dematerialized.]]]\n\nThe following note was found at Dr. Name’s desk:\n\n> thank you\n\n\n[[/Collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[Collapsible show=\"▶ Show Archived Documentation? ◀\" hide=\"▼Close▼\"]]\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-6309\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The following Procedures are to be enacted if Dr. Name attempts to document SCP-6309, or displays signs of being willing to document SCP-6309 at a later date:\n\n• Dr. Name is to consume media containing content that can be vaguely utilized to describe SCP-6309.
