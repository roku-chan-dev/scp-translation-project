Suddenly, you hear it again. A shuffling, a clunking, a door opening and closing. \n\nThis godamn place. The protocols require you to investigate anything possibly anomalous. You grip the clipboard and identification badge tightly. \n\nYou walk to the door. It is obscenely different. Not cheap pine slathered with absurd stain. No. Deep, rich oak, the pure smell of it hits your nostrils.\n\nYou can barely resist reaching out and gliding your hands across the knob, the engraved woodwork slipping into your fingers.\n\n[[=]]\nComfort. \n\nIntrigue. \n\nRest. \n\nFuck it. \n\nYou open the door. \n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\nTucked away in the bowels of your office building, with the three-arrowed badge around your neck, you find something beautiful. A desk, wrought from living wood and growing small desk succulents, sits in front of you, welcoming and willing. You run your calloused pads across the surface. It is smooth. You are reminded of the touch of your first lover. \n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\nYou sit in the chair. It is molded to you rback. It supports, and yet, gives. You lean back, and wooden cogs creak. A long sigh unleashes from your chest, tension released like a chain snapped in kind. You stare at your hands, and the paper drops from them. You turn your head to view the walls. \n[[/=]]\n\nChests. Drawers. Filing cabinets. The most beauticious iron. Varnished copper. You get up. touching one of the knobs. Your knees go weak. Bureaucratic excess. It is nothing but perfectly craftedpapyrus and printed paper, the text a perfect size and color for your delicate eyes. The pure variety of files is immense. Clam shells, filled with pearls. \n\n[[=]]\n\nPapyrus scrolls. \n\nStandard manilla envelopes, stamped with high level classifications. \n\nA thumbdrive covered with stamps. \n\nA cybernetic eye, ready to be ported. \n\nYou take one of the files and begin. \n\n[[/=]]\n\n+ Glen and Glenda\n\nYou grip the file in your hand. It is weighty, half-metal, half-skin. It is human, and within the mechanism, a small pump pushing blood through the system of the flesh. It smells of sweat and gunpowder. Blood flecks the pages within. You cannot help but be intrigued. You sit down at the desk, looking at the combination lock closing the file. Your fingers lie upon the keys. You know the number. The nine keys flicker as you enter the forty-two number passcode, the center key graffiti'd by an extended letter \"A\" with a circle around it. A shrill electronic locks clicks, and the file opens. You grin as something falls out of the bursting mechanisms. \n\nA mag of .22LR, explosive payload. \n\nThis should get interesting. \n\n||~ Title ||~ Description ||~ ||\n|| [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/glen-and-the-gun Glen and the Gun] || Triggers.

Here, the richness of the material increases. You reach down to pick up the paperwork, feeling soft and indubitably lovingly made papyrus in your hands.
