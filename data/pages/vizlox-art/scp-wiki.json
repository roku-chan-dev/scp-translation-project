I also work on two SCP games so I may post some art from that if I can. \n\nMost of the SCP art I have from before I started that animation are really old and look like shit so I will probably just shove that all in a collapsible as a \"see how far I've come\" kind of thing. \n\n------\n\n+++ SCP Pipedream\nThis is the animation I mentioned earlier. I haven't been keeping track but if I had to guess, I'd say I put 50 to 150 hours into it. I think I started this in early 2018 or late 2017, but I only worked on it on-off for awhile before completely abandoning the project for a few months because I got distracted with other projects. I am hoping to finish up some stuff and get back to work on this so I can finish it and get it out the door.\n\nThe basic synopsis of the animation is \"Security guard goes on a drug trip\". The entertainment is more from the trippy visuals of the animation rather than a story, but I do want to have a story in the background for you to pick up on. Before you ask, no I have never done drugs, other than coffee. \n\nFYI I am making the animation in ToonBoom, with backgrounds made in Gimp.\n\nAlso, I am working on this project by myself, but I want to look into finding voice actors at some point down the line.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Security Guard Person\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis is (as of now) the very first frame of the animation.\n\nThe security guard is heavily inspired by the security from containment breach. I would say the background, specifically the texturing, was inspired by how Lord Bung does his backgrounds.\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/AIHK2Ux.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-086\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nSCP-086 is in the back there along with some miscellaneous shapes and illusions. This is the planned background for a scene near the end of the animation. (I added a border so it meshed better against the white background.)\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid #000;\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/MfbvAKl.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-2146\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis was in that confinement music special so I thought I would try and make it a trend to have in animations for SCP. Gotta include that 2146 reference. \n[[image https://i.imgur.com/s2gqMIr.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-312\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nLucky you! You get to see some actual //animation!// It a bit low res because I cropped it from a larger scene but this is SCP-312 floating around in space. I think one of the frames may have also gotten removed when I converted it to a gif. It looks slightly choppier than in ToonBoom. \n[[image https://i.imgur.com/94m3OOJ.gif]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-Not-A-Real-SCP\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis isn't an SCP on the site. It doesn't have a number. It is an SCP that appears during the first few scenes of the animation. This was a concept art for it, not actually from the animation, which is why it looks a bit pixely.\n\nYou could probably guess where the name \"Pipe Dream\" comes from at this point.\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/gP3d8c1.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Animation Frame\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis is a frame from around the middle of the animation. Go ahead and theorize about what is going on here. \n[[image https://i.imgur.com/vNuKNDg.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Another Animation Frame\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis is another animation frame from one of the trippier parts of the animation. The background is taken from the Mandelbrot set but I need to get higher quality images for that at some point.\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/A1ftkAP.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n+++ SCP Games\n\nI work in the concept art department for SCP Ascension but I don't have anything of my own to show here. All of that is under lock and chain.\n\nI also work on a game called SCP Foundation Command which is pretty early in development. I do graphics for it but most of what I've done so far is concept / placeholder since we are still very early.\n\nThe game is similar to Prison Architect except you build an SCP site facility instead of a prison, so of course there has to be D-Class. Here is a mock-up for a D-Class design.\n\nThe plan is to have a wide variety of body and face types so most of them won't have an ugly ass chin.\n[[collapsible show=\"D-Class\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/C39wlrs.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n+++ Other SCP stuff\n\nHere is an abandoned animation project called \"Project Shotgun\". It was going to take place in the Bellerverse but I realized my plans were way too ambitious and unachievable so I abandoned it and reworked a lot of my ideas into Pipe Dream.\n\nThere is nothing but a green screen for the second half of the video because I exported the video wrong. \n\n[[[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RgR8R0awFQ&t=1s]]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Old SCP art\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/0GzhTHl.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/EjfTFAS.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/MrYHNcF.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n------\n\n+++ Misc.\n \n[[collapsible show=\"Jeffeffe\" hide=\"Hide\"]]\nThis isn't an SCP related thing but I am really proud of it and it looks like it could be an SCP so I'm including it on my page.\n\nAlso I named it Jeffeffe because I think it's funny.\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/bKCrNgD.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
