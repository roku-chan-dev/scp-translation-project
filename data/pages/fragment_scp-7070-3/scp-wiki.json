Given the essential nature of SCP-7070-Ω to the Foundation's operations, the data core and servers are to remain under armed guard at all times.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7070 is the reconstructed SCiPNET network, the database containing the totality of the SCP Foundation’s knowledge. \n\nIn 2048, the Earth experienced a catastrophic event, referred to as the Black Moon Incident. Whilst the cause of the incident remains unknown, events on the day of the incident indicate a connection to SCP-7070-1, a form of data corruption experienced by the previous iteration of SCP-7070. Not only was the vast majority of SCiPNET data corrupted, but motifs and phrases associated with SCP-7070-1 proliferated across all forms of information including civilian databases, noospheric concepts, speech, and written text. Those affected by this corruption experienced significant psychological trauma. \n\nIn conjunction with this, a toxic substance, subsequently named \"Black Blight\", was released from the Moon, resulting in 72% of Earth's land mass being rendered uninhabitable, and irreversible corruption to the ecosystem. Over the course of a single day, an estimated 5,500,000,000 casualties occurred, alongside catastrophic damage to the planet's infrastructure. Since the Black Moon Incident, no new anomalies have been discovered.\n\nIn the wake of the Black Moon Incident, SCP-7070 entered a state of prolonged stasis due to the corruptive influence of SCP-7070-1 affecting the entirety of the network’s files, with servers remaining inaccessible and their contents incomprehensible. This drastic loss of communicative tissue left the Foundation unable to mobilize its resources efficiently, resulting in a semi-lifted veil state where the organization openly and publicly cooperated with world governments to address the fallout. As a significant portion of global infrastructure and civilian populations had been displaced, destroyed, or lost, most of these efforts were focused on securing resources and outlining potential futures for humanity.\n\nAfter a period of global strife and unrest, SCP-7070 was reconstructed by the Foundation in 2052. This reclamation was only possible due to the neutralization of SCP-7070-1 by SCP-7070-Ω. \n\nSCP-7070-Ω is ORACLE.AIC, an artificial intelligence responsible for curating, managing, processing, and generating information within SCP-7070. The Foundation began construction on SCP-7070-Ω in the months following the Black Moon Incident, an effort that was aided by the Global Reconstruction Effort, a conglomerate of numerous world governments and Groups of Interest, who assisted the Foundation due to the urgency of the global situation. There were numerous calls from involved parties to devise an automated solution to the world’s overwhelming, compounding dilemmas. \n\nSCP-7070-Ω was devised to be the most comprehensive artificial intelligence ever constructed. It is the world’s first collective superintelligence, an egregore[[footnote]] Defined as a non-physical being that arises from the collective unconsciousness of a group.[[/footnote]] composed of the minds of all Foundation personnel. Connection to SCP-7070-Ω  is introduced via a microscopic series of thaumaturgic sigils surgically inscribed onto the brain, a mandatory process for all Foundation personnel. This is non intrusive, and has no effect on an individual’s autonomy or baseline capabilities. \n\nUpon introduction to SCP-7070, SCP-7070-Ω neutralized the SCP-7070-1 anomaly and retrieved a comprehensive backup of SCiPNET’s data prior to its prolonged blackout. \n\nIn the decades since, SCP-7070-Ω has provided the guiding doctrine on how best to achieve the containment and maintain the veil in the wake of the Black Moon incident. To prevent overreach, SCP-7070-Ω is bound by a sole guideline in the form of the Foundation’s prime objective.\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\nThe Foundation’s mission is to re-establish normalcy through secure containment in a way most efficient in the current state of the world.\n[[/div]]\n\nAs such, SCP-7070-Ω is constrained by the Foundation’s mandate to re-establish society in a way that complements the organization’s goals. \n\nAs of 2098, SCP-7070-Ω manages the entirety of the Foundation’s operations, prioritizing and assessing anomalous threats as they occur, mobilizing Task Forces, and generating the most efficient methods of containment. In addition, ORACLE is responsible for the construction and oversight of all Foundation exclusionary cities, including: resource distribution, traffic flow, utilities management, and civilian surveillance.  \n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n= [[size 200%]] ##red| ADDENDUM ONE## [[/size]]\n------\n@@@@\n@@@@\nThe following partial transcript is a speech given by O5-13 during a Global Reconstruction Effort conference in 2052, held at Neo-Site-19 shortly following its establishment:\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n\n//[O5-13 stands at a podium in an open-air section of Neo-Site-19. Multiple high-ranking members of the Global Reconstruction Effort are seated behind her, including remaining members of the Overseer Council, ORACLE Head Technician Thomas Holden, and world leaders from various countries. There are hundreds of Foundation personnel present, the majority of which are armed and outfitted in military gear.]//\n\n**O5-13:** Thank you all for being here. I’m grateful we could hold this ceremony today amidst all of the… multitudes of pressing duties that would require us elsewhere.\n\nMy name is Sophia Light. I am O5-13. At one point in time revealing your identity as an Overseer was tantamount to treason. It still is. But on paper, the Foundation is still an organization dedicated to containing the anomalous, upholding a curtain to the rest of the world. For all the progress we’ve made, and the sacrifices that have occured over the past four years, one fact remains: the Foundation failed. \n\n//[Silence. Some members of the Reconstruction Effort look at O5-13 with confusion.]//\n\n**O5-13:** If we hadn’t failed, we would not be sitting underneath a bleeding sky, or be using empty containment cells for supply storage and shelter. We wouldn’t have to cope with the knowledge that our loved ones have succumbed to the Black Blight, living like animals in the desolate wastes that surround our encampments. This is not what I was asked to say today, but we failed. And in the face of that failure, there still remains, however childish, a hope that we may bounce back. That we can hit a switch and return like //that//. Trust me, we tried. There’s a screaming sinkhole where Yellowstone used to be now.\n\nDuring the initial fallout, governments and organizations approached the Foundation, begging us to do something. They knew we had exhausted all of our resources, but they still asked. They came to us because of an idea. The idea of the Foundation, an organization which had miraculously succeeded against impossible odds for over a century. How could that Foundation fix this?\n\nWe were asked to create something that could coexist alongside and above us, to embody the tenants that we hold inside of us without placing responsibility in the hands of a select few. And so, I would like to unveil the Foundation’s ark, humanity’s life raft. A project that has been pushed into completion as it is our last possible option— the ORACLE collective superintelligence. Chances are, you’ve worked on completing it. Chances are, you’re already a part of it. \n\nThis is our last chance. ORACLE will, ideally, eliminate the factor of chance from the global equation entirely. It will efficiently chart a course for the world’s future, and how best to achieve it. As Foundation personnel, consider your mandatory participation a penance to reconcile with the past. \n\nWe are not accepting transfers or resignations from the organization for the foreseeable future. I believe you understand our reasoning. \n\nI know you never asked for any of this. \n\n//[O5-13 exits the stage. She is visibly upset.]//\n\n//[The crowd is silent.]//\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n= [[size 200%]] ##red| ADDENDUM TWO## [[/size]]\n------\n@@@@\nFollowing the establishment of SCP-7070-Ω, the reformed Overseer Council elected to process all decisions and strategic matters through ORACLE, and execute the solutions provided by it.

As the organization had been waning in influence over the Foundation as a whole, the strategy focused on folding willing groups within the Effort into the Foundation, forced amnesticization, and utilization of aggressive military campaigns on opposition within the effort. 83% of notable opposition was sourced from the Global Occult Coalition.\n\n**Outcome:** Over the next year, the Foundation successfully dismantled the Global Reconstruction Effort through controlled campaigns on various fronts. Upon recruitment of new members of the Foundation, ORACLE.AIC was used to determine their loyalty to the organization, and their chances of defection. Those who fell lower on the scales were incorporated as D-Class personnel or killed.

Confirmation was unable to be achieved due to a large amount of airborne black blight in the sector, obfuscating imagery. Sector 231 sustained critical damage during the Black Moon incident – estimated 0.07% survival rate.\n\nUpon arrival, the field team encountered a group of 63 human survivors inhabiting a makeshift encampment. At the center of the encampment, the team discovered a formerly contained anomaly, SCP-173, albeit displaying little of its prior documented anomalous properties. Since rediscovery and recontainment, the statue has not moved.\n\nThe community had survived by consuming SCP-173’s output substance. As a result, the anomaly had obtained an almost deific importance in the community’s structure and culture. \n\nSCP-173 was recontained and transported to Neo-Site-02, where it was neutralized via hydraulic press, and incinerated. 58 survivors were transported to Foundation encampments.

The Foundation begins an ongoing campaign to fold all surviving populations into these cities.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .5em .5em; text-align: center; border-top: 5px solid navy;\nborder-bottom: 3px solid navy; background-color: #BDBDBD; width: 100%; font-family: 'Audiowide', regular; color: navy;\"]]\n[[size 150%]] ORACLE DECISION LOG 8003\n2068[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .45em .45em; text-align: left; border-top: 0px solid navy;\nborder-bottom: 0px solid navy; background-color: #BDBDBD; width: 33%; font-family: 'Audiowide', regular; color: navy\"]]\n[[size 110%]] PROBLEM STATEMENT:[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"padding: .45em .45em; text-align: left; border-top: 1px solid #2f333c; border-left: 0px solid #2f333c; border-right: 0px solid #2f333c; border-bottom: 5px solid navy;background-color: #BDBDBD; color: black; width: 66%;\"]]\nProlonged exposure to Ennui amnestics results in rising levels of amnestic resistance and amnestic sickness in the civilian population inside the exclusionary cities.

Ocular implants would obfuscate the perception of remaining outside anomalous activity and objects by civilians, as well as create a realistic simulation of how the world had looked prior to the Black Moon Incident, circa 2028. The neuroinhibitors enable Foundation control over civilian work, expediting reconstruction of society, as well as dampen complex thought processes and reasoning that would undermine the Foundation’s goals. Combined, this would create the illusion that the Incident had never occurred, and normalcy had been maintained.\n\n**Outcome:** Installation successful. Civilian populations were added to the ORACLE.AIC egregore for the purposes of mass manipulation. As of 2070, the Veil has been decidedly re-established for individuals existing inside Foundation exclusionary cities, an estimated 70% of the world’s remaining population.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n= [[size 200%]] ##red| ADDENDUM THREE## [[/size]]\n------\n@@@@\nOn 2098/12/15, the second Foundation Centennial Summit will be held. The event was created as a means by the Overseer Council to assess the state of the Foundation, what it had achieved over the previous century, and its future.\n\n[[div class=\"darkbox\"]]\n= //NEO-SITE-19. CONFERENCE ROOM.//\n\n//[Five individuals sit beside a large slab of black rock located at the center of the room. O5-13 is situated at the table’s head. Windows line the walls, offering a view of the moon and the ground below. Several Foundation exclusionary cities can be seen in the distance. O5-5 enters the room.]//\n\n**O5-5:** I was about to apologize for my lateness, but it appears I’m not the latest by a fair margin.\n\n**O5-13:** Rebekah, I must be the bearer of bad news. The rest won’t be coming.\n\n//[Rebekah walks to the table and takes a seat. 7 remain empty.]//\n\n**O5-5:** The other council members told you this?\n\n**O5-13:** The other council members do not exist.\n\n**O5-5:** Sophia, I’m not quite sure I follow-\n\n**O5-6:** Well, I see the plan to fill her in before the Summit went //swimmingly.//\n\n//[O5-13 waves her hand at O5-6.]//\n\n**O5-13:** Ms. Dark, your comment is neither helpful nor appreciated.\n\n//[A mechanical voice is emitted from O5-10. His lips do not move.]//\n\n**O5-10:** Agreed. \n\n**O5-13:** Perhaps I should elaborate. When the Black Moon Incident occurred, the only survivors on the Council were the previous O5-5, O5-8, O5-11, and I. No-one’s seen nor heard from O5-11 in 20 years; he’s still alive, but holed up in his personal fortress. O5-5 has passed. Which leaves myself and -8.\n\n//[The Council glances towards O5-8. The old woman sits huddled in her seat, staring down at the table. She mumbles indiscernible words to herself. O5-6 leans across the table, and whispers to O5-5.]//\n\n**O5-6:** In case you were wondering, it’s easier to just mark Eight as an abstention on any votes we hold. Her mind left some time ago.\n\n**O5-13:** -1 died at Yellowstone, trying to prepare 2000 for activation. -2 slit her own throat whilst I was on the other end of the phone. O5-9 turned to Fifthism in a miserable attempt to transcend… but we all know how that ended. The others died. I don’t know how, but I know they died. Like everything did.\n\n**O5-8:** Never trust a pentagram. Too many corners.\n\n**O5-13:** In the aftermath, we did what we could. As the creator of ORACLE, it was natural to offer Thomas a seat at the table in O5-4’s position.\n\n**O5-4:** ORACLE’s creation was very much a team effort, Sophia.\n\n**O5-13:** Indeed, a team //you// led. And then, when we merged with Vincent and Lenora’s respective organizations, we offered them the positions of O5-10 and O5-6 respectively. And that was our team, for a time. Until the passing of your predecessor – and now you’re here.\n\n**O5-5:** Why only bring me on board? Why not replace the other roles? \n\n//[O5-13 turns to O5-4. The latter nods. O5-13 pulls out an electronic device and begins to type.]//\n\n**O5-4:** ORACLE. You were the first person it recommended for the Council. Your predecessor was a military man, I think you bring the same qualities he did. Bold. Straight talking.\n\n**O5-5:** I’ve been part of the Council for months. Worked with you all. And you didn’t think to mention this to me? \n\n**O5-6:** We’re mentioning it to you now. “Months” is nothing for an Overseer. \n \n//[O5-13 stops typing.]//\n\n**O5-13:** ORACLE?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**O5-13:** ORACLE, I have a question.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**O5-13:** I've disabled 7070-Ω. Shall we commence the meeting?\n\n**O5-5:** ORACLE isn't to be included in the Summit discussions?\n\n//[O5-4 glances at O5-13, before turning to O5-5.]//\n\n**O5-4:** No. The... the Summit stipulations state only Council members can partake. Whilst important, ORACLE is technically not a Council member.\n\n**O5-5:** Will the Administrator at least be in attendance? \n\n//[The question is met by silence.]//\n\n**O5-5:** I asked if-\n\n**O5-13:** No. No, the Administrator will not be in attendance.\n\n**O5-5:** Why is that the case?\n\n**O5-13:** The Administrator looked out at the world following the Black Moon Incident, and he saw the destruction. The devastation. The damaged state of his beloved Foundation, with over half his handpicked Council dead. And he decided he could look upon that world no longer. \n\n**O5-6:** Things got tough; he threw in the towel.\n\n**O5-13:** You know it was not that simple.\n\n**O5-5:** But I… I’ve spoken to him. When I was promoted to the Council, he called me directly to ask. There are annual video messages from him sent to the whole Foundation!\n\n**O5-4:** What you saw, who you spoke to… it was ORACLE. After the Howling, we didn’t think what was left of us could survive knowing what happened to the Administrator. He was – //is// – the figurehead. We couldn’t tell the survivors the Administrator was gone.\n\n**O5-6:** You should tell her everything.\n\n**O5-4:** I will. I //am//.\n\n**O5-5:** What else-\n\n//[O5-5 is interrupted by a coughing sound. O5-8 retches, and a small ball of mucus is ejected onto the table.]//\n\n**O5-8:** Family business to attend to.\n\n//[An O5 hierophant, until now unseen in the shadows of the room, runs forward and wipes O5-8’s mouth, before retreating away from the table.]//\n\n**O5-5:** What else is it that I need to know? \n\n**O5-4:** ORACLE’s power, its sheer capacity, is obtained, in part through the thaumaturgic inscriptions – //[he taps his head]// on our brains. There was a… progenitor for this though. When…when the Administrator…\n\n**O5-6:** Would you like me to say it for you? \n\n**O5-4:** No no, thank you Six. The Administrator had a wealth of knowledge, of the Foundation, of the anomalous. And an abundance of anomalous knowledge can change you – The way your brain is wired. And that stays with you even after death. We didn’t want to let that power go to waste. In the aftermath of the Howling, we couldn’t afford to. \n\n**O5-5:** What did you do, exactly?\n\n**O5-4:** We installed the Administrator – what was left of him – into ORACLE. And it worked. It worked beautifully. ORACLE changed, upgraded, instantaneously. It gave us a fighting chance. \n\n**O5-5:** The details expunged from the logs…\n\n**O5-4:** In the cold light of day, we did what needed to be done. Without the Administrator, ORACLE would not have worked. Without ORACLE, the Foundation would have collapsed. And without the Foundation, there was no hope for the remnants of humanity. Even the Global Reconstruction Effort understood that much.  At the time, we were desperate.\n\n**O5-13:** Maybe once. But no more. It's time to shut it down. \n\n//[05-5 turns and stares at 13.]//\n\n**O5-5:** Shut down ORACLE?\n\n**O5-13:** The Centennial Summit is held to determine the future of the Foundation. To decide if the organization is still necessary. To ask whether or not this course is sustainable. So no, Rebekah, not just ORACLE. ORACLE and the Foundation.\n\n**O5-5:** Thirteen, the Foundation is the only reason why humanity still exists right now.\n\n**O5-13:** You call this humanity?\n\n**O5-5:** The Foundation pulled me from a survivor’s tribe when I was 10, I know what the absence of humanity is. \n\n**O5-13:** Rebekah, blind loyalty is dispensed of at our rank for good reason. Look at those cities, filled to the brim with human cattle. It's an attempt to cling to what we once had. \n\n**O5-5:** Living in an exclusionary city is better than living in the Blightlands! In the wild, having to fight for yourself, not knowing what’ll come next! They’re happy in those cities!\n\n**O5-13:** They can’t be anything else.\n\n**O5-5:** The Foundation succeeded. To anyone in those cities, the Veil had never fallen. The Howling had never occurred. We did the impossible and //contained// the Black Moon!\n\n**O5-13:** Then why does the sky still bleed? We didn’t contain anything, Rebekah. It’s more like we wrapped a bandage made of amnestics and synapse-switchers over it. ORACLE’s directive was to uphold the Foundation. But, at some point, what was best for us was not best for the world.\n\n**O5-8:** Bandages never truly stem the bleeding. That requires devotion.\n\n//[O5-5 turns to the rest of the council.]//\n\n**O5-5:** Won’t any of you say something? This is madness.\n\n**O5-4:** We categorically -- //categorically// -- have not contained the Black Moon. If anything, I fear worse is still to come. We've never proven the cause of the Black Moon Incident, but I have my theories. We know the Black Blight wasn't in the Moon naturally -- the Foundation conducted plenty of tectonic studies prior to 2048, and there was nothing to indicate its existence. \n\n**O5-5:** How does this relate to ORACLE?\n\n**O5-4:** Let me finish. We also know, that the Black Moon was connected to the database corruption. Vincent and I have been researching this and we don't think the Black Moon caused the database corruption. We believe it was the other way around. The Foundation caused the Moon to bleed.\n\n**O5-5:** That's not possible.\n\n**O5-10:** In 2048, SCiPNET was the greatest repository of information on the anomalous ever created. To bring together that knowledge into one place, to combine all that power in ones and zeroes, and to leave it there together. The database corruption, the Black Moon. It is all connected.\n\n**O5-4:** I developed my suspicions decades ago, after installing the Administrator. It's like I said: an abundance of anomalous knowledge can change you. And we're making the same mistake again, except this time housing that information inside the world's most powerful AI. I created ORACLE. The machine is my life’s work. It was designed to help us survive the worst catastrophe mankind had ever experienced. But we use it now to tell us how to //live//. We’ve become dependent on it.    \n\n**O5-10:** I always admired the Foundation, even prior to joining you. An adamant pursuit of knowledge and scientific research. But under ORACLE, that aspect of our work has been quashed. Look at the design of our cities. We yearn for the past instead of facing the future.\n\n//[O5-6 stands from her chair, and gestures towards the landscape seen through the window.]//\n\n**O5-6:** Do we really think that //this// is the best possible future for humanity? Stagnated livestock in a global containment chamber. We haven’t detected new anomalies since before the Howling. The old ones are dead, or rotting away in the Blightlands. \n\n**O5-5:** But what happens without ORACLE? What happens when people begin to starve to death, and when the inhibitors shut down? When the cities open up, and they realize their lives are a lie? Without the Foundation, how will they get resources? I've spent my career rescuing survivors from the Blightlands, I don't want to damn them again!\n\n**O5-13:** Humanity’s greatest strength is our adaptability. Our ability to make our own path. They will find a way. The hydroponic farms in each city are now active, ORACLE isn’t needed to keep them running. It's time to give people back what we took from them.\n\n**O5-5:** We should at least ask ORACLE what it-\n\n**O5-4:** No. Enough is enough. This is our decision to make. \n\n**O5-5:** You’re suicidal. You’re damning everyone if you do this. It’s genocide. Why are none of you–\n\n**O5-13:** Rebekah.\n\n//[O5-13 calmly stands from her chair, walks over to O5-5. She takes her hand.]//\n\n**O5-13:** When the Foundation found you, scared and alone on the banks of the Mississippi River in the shadow of SCP-3000, you were not there because of ORACLE. It was luck, luck and your own ingenuity. No scripted event, no problem statement and response. You survived. As a member of the Foundation, you’ve made your own choices. Excelled in what you do, done your best to protect others. It’s time we gave everyone the chance to do the same. \n\n**O5-5:** Sophia… this is the only world I’ve ever known. Even without the Foundation, we still have an obligation to help those people. If we're going to pull the rug out from underneath them and say that we were wrong to put it there in the first place, imagine how that will make them feel? If you're admitting fault, you're admitting that we stole their lives. I... I put so many people in those cities, knowing I was doing the right thing. How am I supposed to suddenly feel remorse? I know we were doing the right thing! \n\n**O5-13:** I know. But I promise you – another world is possible. This will not be an end. But a beginning. You’ll have free reign to help who you want, regardless of mission briefing arriving in your inbox.\n\n//[O5-13 lets go of O5-5’s hand, and returns to her seat.]//\n\n**O5-13:** Initiate vote. \n\n//[Electronic screens from the table, one in front of each Council member.]//\n\n//[The screens flicker to life, each displays a single sentence:]//\n\n[[div class=\"lightbox\"]]\n= [[size 150%]] {{SHUT DOWN ORACLE. DISSOLVE THE FOUNDATION.}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//[Below the directive, three options, “YEA”, “ABSTAIN”, “NAY”, are illuminated by a slight glow.]//\n\n//[O5-4, O5-6, O5-10, and O5-13 all vote. O5-5’s finger hovers in front of the screen.]//\n\n**O5-13:** This is your call, Rebekah. The vote needs to be unanimous. I’ve said all I-\n\n**O5-8:** End it.\n\n//[The O5s turn to O5-8.]//\n\n**O5-8:** This whole charade has run for far too long.\n\n**O5-13:** Maria… is that you? \n\n**O5-8:** So focused on the how. We forgot about the why.\n\n//[O5-13 stands, and makes her way around the table to O5-8.]//\n\n**O5-13:** Maria?\n\n//[O5-8 forcefully presses the screen in front of her. Her finger lands on the affirmative vote. She stares at O5-5.]//\n\n**O5-8:** The decisions hardest to make are often the most frightening.\n\n//[O5-8’s gaze drifts, falling to her lap.
