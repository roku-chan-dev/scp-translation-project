This box is comprised of multiple layers of tele-kill shielding, tantalum hafnium carbide, an outer layer of a graphene/carbyne lattice, and decorated with a vantablack floral stencil pattern.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=vanta|caption=Artist's rendering of the box's intricate surface ornamentation]]\n\nThe container is secured with multiple redundant locking mechanisms that are presumed to decrease the likelihood of unauthorized access. These locks are labelled --SCP-????-Box-A through, uh, shit,--  SCP-????-Box-1 through SCP-????-Box---41-- --46-- --50-- fuck it idk, the locks are—are all SCP-????-Box-1. It's a—what do you call it—collective designation. They materialize and dematerialize in random intervals but only one manifests at a time. When inactive, the box appears as a 1 m^^3^^ sheen black cube, bearing a single hinged compartment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-????-J is the designation for an anomaly of unknown specification, currently locked in this fucking box. It's been in Site-44 for as long as anyone can remember, and, I'm gonna level with you, //no one knows where the fuck it came from//. It's stuck inside with a bazillion gizmos, and they all show up randomly on the sides of the box. Anything—keypads, combination locks, time-based Sudoku puzzles—you name it. The thing is locked --tighter than Clef's butthole--. \n\nSCP-????-J's box's condition was brought to the attention of Site-44 director Yanni Belushi when O5-1 pointed the box out during a leisurely stroll through the facility. The conversation is transcribed below:\n\n> = **Transcript of SCP-????-J's Box's Discovery:**\n> \n>\n> = <BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>\n> \n> **O5-1:** Oi, what the fuck is that thing?\n> \n> **Belushi:** What, that? It's been around here for god knows how long. It's just a box, I think.\n> \n> **O5-1:** There are no 'just boxes' in the Foundation. That thing probably has an Apollyon in it, lock that shit down.\n> \n> **Belushi:** Yeah, you're probably right. Guard!\n> \n> **Guard:** What's up, Belush?\n> \n> **Belushi:** Don't call me that, that's not my name. Get this box out of here.\n> \n> **Guard:** What, should I throw it in the trash?\n> \n> **Belushi:** No, you moron, put it in a containment cell. Who knows what is inside the thing.\n> \n> **Guard:** I dunno, Belush, it feels pretty empty.\n> \n> **Belushi:** I said //don't. Fucking. Call me that.// And stop rattling it around, you might piss off whatever is in there.\n> \n> **Guard:** I'm telling you mate, this box is totally empty.\n> \n> **Belushi:** And I'm telling //you//, put that box in a bigger box or else I'll shove my foot so far up //your// box that you'll be having infant-sized Dockers in nine months.\n> \n> **O5-1:** Jesus.\n> \n> **Guard:** Alright! Calm your tits, man. //Sheesh//. \n> \n> //SCP-????-J's box was then transported to its current containment area. Guard was reprimanded and probably demoted, jackass.//\n\nWe weren't sure if the box was safe to open for the longest time, we still don't know for sure, but like five years ago—after the old Administrator kicked it—the story goes that the Council was divvying up his stuff and O5-4 kept going on about how the late Admin borrowed his signed region-free copy of the //Fringe: The Complete Series// Blu-ray box set back in like 2014 and hadn't returned it. He kept going on about how it was odd the old man's DVD collection hadn't been recovered with any of his effects, nor from his numerous [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3311 storage units],[[footnote]]Ohhh yeah, you remember that whole thing? Turned out the previous Administrator was three wooden Adirondack chairs in a trench coat, disguised as a human. What, they never told you that? Oh—oh, right. [speaking into wrist] [[size 75%]]//I'm gonna need some Class-B amnestics to Site-44, sublevel 18, room 7A—//[[/size]] What? No, you're fine. Just stay right here.[[/footnote]] then they found some ledger of the Admin's with \"OPEN [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/qntm-s-proposal THE LOCK], ENACT EVIL CHAIR-MAN CHAIRMAN AGENDA\" scribbled in one of the margins. O5-1 mentioned SCP-????-J's container having locks, then they got this ludicrous idea they were somehow referring to the same thing and maybe SCP-????-J's box had a bunch of stolen Blu-ray disks inside.\n\nSo we started opening the box for them, or doing our best to. Then like last year, O5-4 finds his boxed set of //Fringe// in his basement, behind his dehumidifier or something, and left us to figuring out the nature of SCP-????-J ever since. \n\nAnyway, we are making progress. Probably. Every time we solve something, or we think we do, the box makes this tone and we never see that specific //bastard// lock again. I think it's working. Some of them have timers on their sides, counting down. Sometimes a little instruction is scribbled on the exterior of the box, most often written in black permanent marker, which is, you know, an absolute pain. Typically, though, we're in the dark. If it weren't for some clues, we'd be going nowhere. How else would we have known you had to send it a fax? //A fax?!// Who faxes shit anymore? What is this, 1870? \n\nA full list of all these goddamn locking mechanisms are found here. \n[[div class=\"table1 tableb\" style=\"border-spacing:1px;order: solid 1px #cdcdcd;padding: 0.5em 0.625em;\"]]\n||~ **Type:**  ||~ **Info:**   ||~ **Notes:** ||\n|| Standard combination lock || Container requires a five number combination || No solution found ||\n|| Biometric fingerprint scanner || Requires thumbprint of late pianist Mieczysław Horszowski|| Thumb is kept in a maximum security cryogenic freezer in [[[scp-1730|Site-13]]][[footnote]] //Who in the fuck put it there?
