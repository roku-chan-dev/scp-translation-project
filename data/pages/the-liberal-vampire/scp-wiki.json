[[/footnote]] All recorded victims share the following similarities:\n* the possession of a high-ranking status as a member of right-wing political parties, groups, or movements in Eastern Europe;\n* a history of accusations of human rights violations and abuse of power;\n* a history of accusations of silencing political enemies, especially outside the boundaries of law;\n* a total and seemingly instantaneous removal of all blood from their organisms.\n\nIn all cases recorded, exsanguination has been deemed the cause of the victims' deaths; their bodies are otherwise unviolated and show no signs of any manipulation or damage, magical or otherwise. Similarly, all victims were found dead within public spaces they had often frequented -- such as offices or chancelleries -- usually being reported dead only minutes after being seen in perfect health in public.\n\nAs of writing, no suspect has been identified. Recovered documents from international organizations similar in purpose to the Division operating in affected areas -- such as the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-ua#DATSSU|Department of Abnormal Threats to the Security Service of Ukraine]]] or the [[[https://scpfoundation.net/scp-1390-ru|Federal Agency For the Supervision of the Abnormal]]] -- have similarly failed to identify any such person.\n\nEach crime scene has been found devoid of physical evidence, save for the bodies themselves. Due to this, there exists no certainty that the person (or persons) responsible has stopped their actions, whatever their motivation may be -- It is therefore the Division's opinion that the murders are yet to cease and should be considered an ongoing case.\n\n**History:** The first murder relating to the investigation was recorded on 03/12/2021 -- these activities have since continued in a sporadic and irregular manner and are yet to cease as of writing (26/12/2021). Under normal operational guidelines, the case would be classified under Alpha Priority and immediately pursued further. However, due to the heightened staff requirements on account of the ongoing [[[hour-zero|Veilfall scenario]]], the Division is unable to supply additional personnel to this investigation.\n\nWere it not for the fact that the murders affected Zbigniew Ziobro, a high-level supporter of the operations of the Ministry of Occult Phenomena and the Division, the case would be temporarily frozen. Due to this, only Agents Zieliński and Mazurek were cleared to continue the investigation\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"logs\"]]\n[[div class=\"logs-header\"]]\nInitial Analysis\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n**> RECORDING STARTS <**\n[[/=]]\n[[table class=\"dialog\"]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n//Zieliński and Mazurek are standing around a desk displaying files for #03/12/2021-A.

I'm running to you almost directly from a battlefield. (Zieliński is in appropriate hands. Hurt, but stable; he'll live). I do not know how much time we've got to spare.\n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe confrontation with the #03/12/2021-A murderer was far from a success -- in the end, they got away, and it almost cost us the life of two Agents to try and stop it from happening. But it wasn't a total failure -- we heard their voice and their words. And we saw their //sigil// -- three entangled snakes, all surrounded by a single circle.\n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTheir words, too, back up what I am about to propose. I may not personally know [[[old-adytite-language|Ämärangnä]]], but I'd trust our local B/6 linguopath with my life. She says the words they spoke just after shooting Zieliński mean, and I quote: //\"Contact the others. Tell them I've taken care of the [dogs / beasts] for now, but that they will soon return. We cannot take any more risks. Not until we are [done / finished / complete].\"//\n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI hope I do not need to tell you what a threat a re-emergent Klavigar Saarn poses.\n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat's even more worrying is that this isn't just an isolated incident; Supervision tells me they have unconfirmed reports about [[[sarkic-heat|a ten-meter horned warrior following Vanguard staff]]]. There's also been rumors of a many-handed figure being spotted around Prague and Alexandrian libraries. And while it would be a stretch to say from the intel we have gathered that what apparently lurks beneath the [[[scp-2191|Hoia Forest]]] is Lovataar, it would also be dishonest to call the two unrelated.\n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith all of this in mind, I must therefore ask: what the //hell// are the four Klavigars up to? What is so important that all four of them have seemingly only now decided to stop their millennia-old slumber, and reveal themselves to the world at large? \n\n[[div style=\"height: 14px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd, most importantly of all, can we truly be sure it is //just// the [[[scp-6500|Impasse]]] that has caused this?\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n| [[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives]]] |\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** ZM-2.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jasiu06]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-liberal-vampire SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** ZM-1.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jasiu06]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-liberal-vampire SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative Of:**\n\n> **Name:**Herb Polski.svg\n> **Author:** N/A\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Herb_Polski.svg Wikimedia Commons]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
