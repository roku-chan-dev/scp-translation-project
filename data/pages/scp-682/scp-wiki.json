At this time, no means available to SCP teams are capable of destroying SCP-682, only able to cause massive physical damage. SCP-682 should be contained within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m chamber with 25 cm reinforced acid-resistant steel plate lining all inside surfaces. The containment chamber should be filled with hydrochloric acid until SCP-682 is submerged and incapacitated. Any attempts of SCP-682 to move, speak, or breach containment should be reacted to quickly and with full force as called for by the circumstances.\n\nPersonnel are forbidden to speak to SCP-682, for fear of provoking a rage-state. All unauthorized personnel attempting to communicate to SCP-682 will be restrained and removed by force.\n\nDue to its frequent attempts at containment breach, difficulty of containment and incapacitation, and high threat of Foundation Exposure, SCP-682 is to be contained in site [REDACTED]. The Foundation will use the best of its resources to maintain all land within fifty (50) kilometers clear of human development.\n\n**Description:** SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with [[[SCP-079]]] during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B). \n\nSCP-682 has always been observed to have extremely high strength, speed, and reflexes, though exact levels vary with its form. SCP-682's physical body grows and changes very quickly, growing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material.  SCP-682 gains energy from anything it ingests, organic or inorganic. Digestion seems to be aided by a set of filtering gills inside of SCP-682's nostrils, which are able to remove usable matter from any liquid solution, enabling it to constantly regenerate from the acid it is contained in. SCP-682's regenerative capabilities and resilience are staggering, and SCP-682 has been seen moving and speaking with its body 87% destroyed or rotted. \n\nIn case of containment breach, SCP-682 is to be tracked and re-captured by all available Mobile Task Forces, and no teams with fewer than seven (7) members are cleared to engage it. To date (██-██-████), attempted breaches have numbered at seventeen (17), while successful breaches have numbered at six (6). (See Addendum 682-D). \n\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 682-B:** Portion of recorded transcript of [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-682/682.mp3 ██████]. \n> \n> **<Begin Log, skip to 00h-21m-52s>** \n> \n> **Dr. ██████:** Now, why did you kill those farmers? \n> \n> **SCP-682:** (No verbal communication) \n> \n> **Dr. ██████:** If you don't talk now, we will remove you from this attempt and place you back into- \n> \n> **SCP-682:** (Incomprehensible) \n> \n> **Dr. ██████:** Pardon?

General ███, General ██████, and Dr. ██████████ observing. \n\n> 0400: Exposure. SCP-682 began to tear at the point of contact, causing massive trauma to the area. SCP-682 requests several times to know what it has been exposed to. \n> \n> 0800: Crystallization begins, spreading much slower than normal. \n> \n> 1200: SCP-682 shows signs of extreme pain, and begins having seizures \n> \n> 1300: Crystallization stops at 62% conversion. Crystallized area explodes, causing massive physical trauma to SCP-682 \n> \n> 1400: SCP-682 recovers from exposure, despite the loss of limbs and organs. SCP-682 begins regeneration, stating that it will attempt to kill and consume all staff involved in Event 682-E18. \n\nSCP-682 appears to now be immune to [[[SCP-409]]]. Use of other SCP items to terminate SCP-682 must now first be tested on samples of SCP-682 before full-scale testing. \n\nIn accordance the Dr. ████████'s recommendations (see Document 27b-6), Dr. ███████ and Dr. █████ have requested permission to attempt the termination of SCP-682 using [[[SCP-689]]]. The request is currently pending approval from the ████████. \n\nIt has also been suggested by Dr. Gears to use [[[SCP-182]]] in an attempt to communicate with SCP-682. [[[SCP-182]]] has expressed reluctance, and refuses to enter the containment center of SCP-682, if at all possible.\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 682-F:** Termination Log: \n[[[experiment-log-t-98816-oc108-682 |Experiment-Log-T-98816-oc108-682]]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-681]]] | SCP-682 | [[[SCP-683]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Dr Gears and Epic Phail Spy]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 682.mp3\n> **Author:** [[*user thattallfellow]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** monster8editub9-new.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user OccultistMave]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative of:**\n> ----\n> **Name:** Beached humpback whale at Kincaid Park.
