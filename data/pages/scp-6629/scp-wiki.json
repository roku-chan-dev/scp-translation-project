SCP-6629-A is to be kept in an electronically-timed safe in Director Hammond’s office. Personnel are forbidden from accessing either object outside of testing.\n\n**Addendum_6629-01:** As of 08/15/2024, inquiries to the Ethics Committee or the Decommissioning Department on the pursuit of the total cessation of SCP-6629’s production have been paused. Until a conclusive O5 vote is reached, all information regarding SCP-6629’s origins have been restricted to personnel with level 4 clearance and above. Those aware as of the date of this addenda without clearance are to be amnesticized to prevent a loss of efficiency in their duties.\n\n**Addendum_6629-02:** Fast-tracked funding initiatives for the creation of programs intent on splintering members of GoI-012[[footnote]]Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.[[/footnote]] into MTF Sigma-66 (“Sixteen Tons”) and MTF Mu-3 (“Highest Bidders”) are currently awaiting approval. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6629 refers to the collective designation of 205 known instances of black, humanoid-shaped automatons and the singular device used to power them, SCP-6629-A. Each SCP-6629 instance is composed entirely of standard commercial-grade porcelain and contains a single spherical crystal (SCP-6629-1) that levitates within the chest cavity. SCP-6629-A is a silver box with a singular golden button on its face that contains a closed circuit inside of it.\n\nAll SCP-6629-1 instances possess a randomized number of microscopic typographical characters corresponding to the Latin script carved on their surfaces. --Analysis of these characters has not yet revealed a connection to any known cipher, work of literature, or pataphysical algorithm. Due to this, it is theorized that SCP-6629-1’s markings may have been created using techniques which harness anomalously pure randomness.-- //See Addendum_6629-Δ.//\n\nThe function of SCP-6629-1 is to power each of SCP-6629’s mechanisms via SCP-6629-A. When powered on, all SCP-6629 instances within a 50m radius will animate and attempt to locate the user. If an SCP-6629 instance cannot find an unblocked path towards the user, it will deactivate after half an hour of attempts. \n\nHowever, in the presence of a visible user, SCP-6629 entities will not deactivate until they have  been given a task or command and then fulfills the request to the user’s unspoken standards of what such a service entails. There is no way to force SCP-6629’s inanimation in this state outside of removing SCP-6629-1 from itself.\n\nThe capacity for physical tasks which can be performed by SCP-6629 match exactly that of which can be executed by the average baseline parameters of consensus humanity. The processing power it possesses for mathematical tasks falls within the perfect center of a Gaussian distribution based on data collected from --globally balanced samples-- persons living within the United States of America. Asking SCP-6629 to fulfill a task which would normally harm or put strain on a human being will result in similar “injuries” displayed on its body—these include, but are not limited to: cracks in key joints, weakness of automotive limbs, and the complete and total loss of animation, analogous to “death”.\n\nAs of 06/02/2024, 121 of the collected 205 entities have entered a “death” state.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"LEVEL 4 CLEARANCE REQUIRED\" hide=\"CLEARANCE ACCEPTED\"]] \n**Discovery:** SCP-6629 and -A were recovered on three separate occasions during raids of what were believed to be residences belonging to PoI-012-01[[footnote]] Percival Atherolis Darke, CEO of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.[[/footnote]], taking place in 2003, 2008, and 2014. MTF Upsilon-10 (“No Secret Money”) initially stumbled upon SCP-6629 in inert decorative states, believing the objects to be of the typical, low-hazard anomalous paraphernalia encountered during the rest of their mission. This was until fifty instances became active and attacked them, resulting in two casualties, and all fifty SCP-6629 instances being forced into a “dead” state in the ensuing skirmish. MTF Upsilon-10 believed all objects to be neutralized until thirty-five inactive SCP-6629 entities were found in a secret, signal-barricaded chamber of PoI-012-01’s master study. SCP-6629-A was also collected here.\n\nBelow are documents amassed across all operations, relating to SCP-6629’s commissioning and use by PoI-012-01.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop show=+ Show Relevant Documentation|hide=- Hide Relevant Documentation]]\n[[div style=\"border:1px solid #000000;\"]]\n[[div style=\"color:#032D38; font-size:11pt; background:#f5f4f2;font-family: book;padding: 15px;\"]]\n**MISCELLANEOUS ITEM COMMISSION FORM No. 98257**\n\n**DATE DRAFTED:** 07/07/1995 | **DATE STAMPED:** 08/07/1995\n\n**REQUESTEE:** PERCIVAL A.

Carter.[[/footnote]]—but this is a rare opportunity. It must be learned from fully.\n\nAlso, how shrewd of you to find such a convenient spot for our new source of cores for the automated servants. I was skeptical of sourcing from China, but the lack of G.O.C and Foundation proxies there make it more perfect than I ever imagined. It’s no less than monumental luck that they have so little idea of what goes into these; and I intend for it to stay that way.

I hope you’ve been having a wonderful day. I’m emailing you about SCP-6629, as I believe we’ve made a breakthrough about the -1 components. I know Site-106 has been itching to lend these things out to other branches of the Foundation because of how convenient they are, but I think you should reconsider that for now.\n\nSo, as you know, Site-74 has been running under budget for quite some time. I’m extremely proud of myself, no need for applause, but I nearly mucked that achievement up trying to reverse engineer this dang thing and its cores’ scribblings.\n \nThat’s when a few of my colleagues suggested we try cross referencing the letters with random assortments of data. Maybe Darke was pulling from exotic sources to make these things work, because once they die, the letters fade away, so there has to be a relationship between what’s on them and why they can locomote.\n\nIgnore the email sent to you earlier about the letters corresponding to taxonomic classifications of currently named species—the actual randomizations seem to line up with names from US census records ranging from 1995 to 2014. It’s weird, and insanely specific, but at least we’re one step closer to figuring this out.\n\nForward the files attached in this email to the Analytics Department and let me know when they’re done. Everyone’s a bit confused about the ‘why’ here, but this can’t be anything that major, right?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n|**To:** ste74_drctrhammond@scpfound.net\n|**From:** ste106_drbruntsworth.tanesha@scpfound.net\n\n**TIME RECEIVED:** 08:01 AM CST 07/22/2024\n**SUBJECT:** Resend those files\n\nDear Site-74 Director Lakely Hammond,\n\nI don’t mean to alarm you, but Analytics is requesting a second copy of those files. They’ve run three batches of logistics on them already, and they want to be 100% sure they’re making the right correlations here. \n\nIn lieu of that, O5-02 and O5-07 have put in commands for your presence at their desks next week. There’s nothing I can do to change their minds this time.\n\nDr. Bruntsworth\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n|**To:** ste106_drbruntsworth.tanesha@scpfound.net, ste74_drctrhammond@scpfound.net\n|**CC:** ste106_drctrjeanskeates@scpfound.net, + 26 others\n|**From:** overseerASEAH_02@scpfound.scip\n\n**TIME RECEIVED:** 06:37 AM CST 07/27/2024\n**SUBJECT:** An Important Announcement About SCP-6629\n\nTo everyone receiving my email, you will want to sit down.\n\nI understand that there have been rumors flying between the Analytics Department, Site-74, and Site-106 about the nature of SCP-6629 and its -1 components. I am here to quell and properly explain to each of you the truth of what we have uncovered so that panic does not indiscriminately spread to other sites and the Ethics Committee. To those who have already filed requests on our current plans of action regarding Percival A. Darke, please know that we will be addressing them at the next O5 Council meeting.\n\nSo—as discovered by Site-74 Director Hammond, the characters engraved into SCP-6629-1 are indeed not random as we once previously believed. They correspond one-to-one with the names of missing persons in the United States who possessed legal entries within the US census database. As of the time of this email’s sending, all individuals whose names we have managed to recover have been declared legally dead by local, state, and federal authorities. Not a single person’s body with a name on one of those cores was ever found, dead or alive.\n\nWhat this means is that we have found an answer which the United States found itself lacking nearly three decades ago. As you all know, the rate of missing persons in the US doubled from roughly six hundred thousand per year to 1.2 million starting in 1995, with the decade of 2002-2012 seeing the highest growth of this trend, peaking at 3.4 million in 2006. \n\nThe mass social panic caused by this crisis was unprecedented. Initially the Foundation thought the disappearances to be the work of many heated, but ultimately ordinary factors: communist and French influences wreaking havoc within the G.O.C, Russian spies encouraging the defection of civilians with far-right beliefs to its satellite countries, the Sovereign State of Hawai’i serving as an isolationist haven for all manners of asylum seekers, etc. All of this greatly stifled our ability to investigate wide-reaching phenomena, both anomalous and not.\n\nWhat we, the O5 Council, now understand is that we should have never permitted any of that to stop us. For the past decade, China has been undergoing the same problem—and now we know why. Each instance of SCP-6629-1 has thirty thousand names inscribed on it. We currently possess 205 of them, but based on insider information obtained by MTF Mu-3, about 700 total were produced in America. \n\nThere is no other conclusion we can come to except that Darke has somehow committed one of the greatest anomalous atrocities under the Veil, and for a period of time that no one thought possible for an entity like MC&D. Over twenty million people have been silently, unabashedly extinguished from existence because of her mercurial whims, and we are currently powerless to stop this death march.\n\nNow, before alarm bells begin ringing, understand that the O5 Council is in a bind despite the clear danger here. Because Darke has somehow managed to tweak whatever creates SCP-6629-1 (hereby referred to as SCP-6629-Ω) to specifications so insanely meticulous[[footnote]]Based on evidence from archival records, Foundation staff and individuals belonging to other GoIs known to pose a threat to MC&D's operations did not disappear in numbers associated with SCP-6629-Ω’s existence and its rate of attack on civilian populations.[[/footnote]], we are currently at a stalemate of how to not just procure SCP-6629-Ω, but how to utilize it as well. \n\nI do not need to tell the more tactician-minded among you of how a perfectly silent, under-the-Veil killer of this scale and precision would be of extreme benefit to the Foundation. It would save the lives of countless MTF members and civilians threatened by keter-level humanoids, along with providing us with unlimited leverage over any government which dares to roadblock us. Perhaps we could even alter it to neutralize non-humanoid anomalies which cannot be feasibly contained.\n\nBut this is also a dangerous, dangerous thing. This needs to be kept out of the hands of other GoIs at all costs, especially those more politically motivated like ORIA and the Chaos Insurgency. Should this fall into the hands of anyone else but us, we can expect little but to be wiped off the map when we inevitably piss off the wrong people, followed by everything we know collapsing without our stability keeping it in place. \n\nWe find ourselves therefore as Atlas in this situation. The burden of the world has too been thrust upon our shoulders, and there is no easy solution or agreement about what should be done. The O5 Council understands that SCP-6629-Ω is an active threat, but the Veil must be maintained at all costs, and we will need time to craft a plan that will preclude any possibility of Darke destroying SCP-6629-Ω permanently, or worse, turning it against us. The lives we can save by obtaining it, rest assured, shall make up for what we have currently suffered.\n\nIf you have any family or friends in China you’re worried about, we advise you to have them contact us for a job here. We will offer them work-visas and places to stay. That is the best protection we can offer on that front for now.\n\nWith all authority,\nO5-02\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum_6629-03:** On 09/12/2024, a hidden compartment was found on an SCP-6629 instance during a regularly scheduled maintenance check.
