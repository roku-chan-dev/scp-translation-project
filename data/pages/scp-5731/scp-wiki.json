Request to gain access to the item is to be submitted to Dr. Green.\n\n**Description:**\nSCP-5731 is a square music box which is 6 cm in length, 5 cm in width, and 3 cm in height. Its top is made from clear plastic, allowing the interior to be viewed. When its anomaly is not in effect, it plays a rendition of “Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah” when cranked. When in the vicinity of a non-sapient biological entity, its anomalous effect is triggered. If cranked nearby one of these entities, SCP-5731 will instead play English human speech. This is believed to be the broadcasting or “translation” of the non-sapient entity’s thoughts. The voice from the music box is always that of a young female, despite the sex of the effected entity. Tests discovered wildly varying personalities in the music box between test subjects used. It is not believed the female voice is its own consciousness, rather a projection of the ones surrounding it.\n\n**Discovery:**\nSCP-5731 was purchased by Researcher Pret’s wife from a yard sale at some point during the summer of 2013. Researcher Pret was not aware of SCP-5731’s effects until 8/17/2018 when his daughter wound it in proximity to the family cat, which triggered SCP-5731’s effects. Researcher Pret surrendered the object to the Foundation for testing.\n------\n**Testing:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Tests\" hide=\"- Access granted\"]]\n**Testing is currently overseen by Dr. Green.

I have a couple of questions for you.\n> \n> **Judy T████:** About the music box, I bet.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Yes, of course. How did it come into your possession?\n> \n> **Judy:** If I answer the questions you’ll give it back to me, right?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Certainly.\n> \n> **Judy:** Alright, I got it as a gift when I was little. From my aunt.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Do you know where she got it?\n> \n> **Judy:** No.\n> \n> **Interviewer**: What’s her name?\n> \n> **Judy:** What, are you gonna go after her family too? I already know you’re mad enough at me for knowing about… all this… the weird stuff out there.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Tell us her name, please.\n> \n> **Judy:** Ugh, it’s █████ ██████. But don’t bother. She’s been dead for 6 years now.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Thank you. How did you find out about “all this”?\n> \n> **Judy:** Well, it started with the music box. One thing kinda led to another and… I guess I just never stopped believing in magic as a kid, you know?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** And about the Foundation?\n> \n> **Judy:** Came across it in my search for the music box.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Could you elaborate?\n> \n> **Judy:** How do I elaborate? I don’t remember exactly when I found out about it. At that point I’d already known about the supernatural stuff for years, so a place that collects that stuff ain’t so hard to imagine. And I figured a place that collects magic stuff might have ‘collected’ something that was mine.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Hm, what was your aunt like, then? Do you know if she was aware of the anomalous?\n> \n> **Judy:** She definitely knew what the music box could do. That’s why she gave it to me. My best friend even back then was Sparky, and I really wanted nothing more than to talk to him. I don’t know what else she knew about anomalies. What, do you think she was a witch?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Ha, well that’s not entirely out of the realm of possibility. How exactly did you lose the music box?\n> \n> **Judy:** I didn’t lose it. It got sold at a yard sale. I like to think that it accidentally got swept up with the other things that were getting sold, but my mom may have just gotten rid of it on purpose.\n> \n> **Interviewer**: Your mother was aware of it, then?\n> \n> **Judy:** Yeah. She didn’t like the music box //or// my aunt. She wasn’t real fond of magic, and she always said that I needed to make actual friends, cause a dog wasn’t good enough or something. [ //Judy laughs// ]\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I see. Do you have any more information?\n> \n> **Judy:** Nah. Can I have the music box back now?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I’ll see what I can do.\n> \n> **Judy:** Hey now, you just said ‘certainly’ at the beginning of our chat, and now it’s ‘I’ll see what I can do’?\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I will try my be-\n> \n> **Judy:** No! //No,// that’s not good enough.\n> \n> //Judy stands up from her seat.//\n> \n> **Judy:** //Swear// to me you’ll get it back.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** I d-\n> \n> **Judy:** Do it! Please... [ //Judy's voice falters// ]\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Please remain calm, Judy.\n> \n> **Judy:** That thing is mine, and I’m running out of time. Swear you’ll give it back.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Fine then, I swear! Please Judy, sit back down.\n> \n> //Judy sits and breathes deeply.//\n> \n> **Judy:** Stand by your word, or I’ll be back on your doorstep tomorrow- I swear to //that.//\n> \n> **<End Interview Log>**\n\n> **Closing statement**: Judy T████ provided no further useful information. She received amnestics to remove all memory of SCP-5731 and the Foundation, and was released from Foundation custody.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n##white| Why didn't they let her say goodbye? What is one person on the outside knowing about us? No no, amnestize everything away. She remembers nothing about her best friend. To her, he was nothing but a dog. Why? Because we're the Foundation, and //we're cold.//##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5730]]] | SCP-5731 | [[[SCP-5732]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** music box test.png\n> **Author:** [[*user A Green Squid Kid]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5731 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
