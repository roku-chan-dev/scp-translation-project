She supposed she should take pride in looking as young as she liked.\n\nBut she had no use for her beauty anymore. There were no more kings to seduce, no more reason to be the most beautiful woman in the land.\n\n\"[[span class=\"ruby\"]]//leng^^3^^neoi^^2^^, maai^^5^^ gam^^3^^ siu^^2^^ gau^^3^^, maa^^3^^? seoi^^1^^ m^^4^^ seoi^^1^^ do^^1^^di^^1^^ aa^^3^^?//[[span class=\"rt\"]]\"Pretty girl, buying so little?

The auntie shook her head, muttering something about how men didn't know how good they had it, and gave her the change and slippers.\n\n//Boyfriend.// Daji dryly noted the word as she walked out of the store. A strange concept to her.\n\nShe was not unfamiliar with romance. She remembered being Dì Xīn's concubine, and how he showered her with love. She remembered hearing Dì Xīn and Xǐmèi making love for hours upon hours, how her sister had developed true love for the king, how her sister dreamed of Nüwa granting their wishes and allowing them to live forever in Heaven.\n\nBut Daji herself did not feel that love.  To her, concubinage was always a step in her mission. Her beauty was an asset, something she could use. Perhaps it was the centuries and centuries that had passed before she was given her task, watching mortals grow and die, watching [[span class=\"ruby\"]]//xiān//[[span class=\"rt\"]]immortals[[/span]][[/span]] rise and fall. Maybe had she been millennia younger, she too could have loved, could have lusted like her sisters.\n\nShe closed her eyes. Su Dájǐ's limp body came to mind, an eternal memory of the only woman she killed who did not deserve it. The only human she ate and regretted.\n\nA sin that she punished herself for.\n\nShe walked up to a street stall and ordered a lamb skewer. Daji stared unblinkingly as the vendor grilled the meat, layering paprika, cumin, and other assorted spices as the flames flicked and colored the meat.\n\nShe turned around after getting her food, only to come face to face with a woman in a suit standing behind her.\n\nDaji didn't need to be a detective to know that this woman was following her.\n\n\"//Duìbùqǐ//,\" she murmured, biting into her lamb skewer and brushing past the woman. She felt an uneasy tingling on the back of her neck, and she readjusted her cap.\n\nAs she feared, the woman followed her path — not too close, just within her periphery.\n\nDaji wordlessly cast a simple search spell, and cursed under her breath. Every alleyway around her, her preferred method of escape, had at least one presence in it, no doubt someone lying in wait. Whoever this woman belonged to - and she had a suspicion it was the Jailors again — they were clearly targeting her.\n\nIt seemed she would have to make do with a more public area.\n\nDaji walked into a local fast food restaurant and got in line. As expected, the Suited Woman entered shortly after, making sure to stand directly behind her.\n\n\"I never know what to get before I stand in line,\" sighed the Suited Woman. \"I really should correct this.\"\n\nDaji did not respond, and the woman did not bother her again.\n\nSoon it was her turn. \"Welcome to Five Guys, how may I help you?\"\n\n\"Yeah, uh, can I just get a hot dog?\" asked Daji.\n\n\"Absolutely. Will that be all? Any toppings or-\"\n\n\"Nah, just a hotdog.\"\n\n\"Alright, ma'am, your total will be $7.29.\"\n\nDaji nearly choked on her own spit hearing that. Seven dollars for a hotdog? That was a full rice box that could keep her happy for an entire day.\n\nWith a heavy heart, she reached into her wallet. She hesitated for a brief moment before reluctantly pulling out a five and three singles.\n\n\"Also,\" she said, as she collected her change. \"May I use your restroom?\"\n\n\"Sure, no problem.\"\n\nDaji gave the employee a forced smile before slipping away into the restroom. Already, she could hear the Suited Woman getting her order taken as quickly as possible. There was little time left.\n\nShe locked the door behind her. With a deep breath, Daji shed her human shell, doing her best to avoid making any noise.\n\n\"What a pain,\" she muttered. \"Waters of Penglai, cleanse my soul.\"\n\nThe uneasy feeling from before disappeared as the spell worked its way through her body, confirming her suspicions that the Suited Woman and her peers had cast something on her body — and now that she had removed it, they would likely converge on her position.\n\nTeleportation was out of the question — the Jailors had some device that suppressed the powers she had gained. But those that she owned, those a core component of her very existence, she could still use, even with a little nausea.\n\nShe was not the Thousand-Year-Vixen for nothing.\n\n\"Damn you mortals,\" Daji sighed, lifting the toilet cover.  \"I decide when I will confront you. Don't rush me.\"\n\nShe clenched her teeth before transforming into a smaller fox, just enough to fit through the toilet, and began swimming.\n\n------\n\n//\"You look... awful, my Lady.\"//\n\nDaji snarled, splashing another bucket of water on herself. \"I am not in the mood, Once-Was.\"\n\n//\"Why did you not kill her or the other humans? I have not known you to be shy from violence.\"//\n\n\"Should I have?\"\n\n//\"Perhaps. The tools of the Jailors bind the brilliance of your ethereal existence. Magic stops working near them. You would just be a very angry fox. And perhaps I would be gone for good.\"//\n\nAnother bucket of water. Daji had lost count by now of how many she'd dumped on herself. In her heart, she knew no amount could ever wash away the humiliation of the sewer escape.\n\n\"What do you want from me, then?\" asked the foxqueen. \"My death?\"\n\n//\"Unsure. I did not think I could ever come back — with all due respects, due to you, my Lady. But at least in this era, I no longer have to worry about marriage to a man I do not care for.\"//\n\n\"You're not exactly alive either,\" pointed out Daji. \"For all I know, you're just a hallucination, Once-Was. One who shares my voice. Or perhaps I'm just talking to myself.\"\n\n//\"Maybe. Would that help your conscience?\"//\n\nDaji shook her head. \"No. I'd rather think you were real. It's... comforting. To know some sins can still be undone.\"\n\n//\"Undone sins were still committed,\"// pointed out the Once-Was. //\"And my apologies in advance, but I am in no hurry to forgive you immediately, my Lady.\"//\n\n\"Good enough.\" With a sigh, Daji put down the bucket and stepped into her makeshift shower. \"Is that why I've been less aggressive? Because of your thoughts? Your feelings\"\n\n//\"Maybe. Maybe not. I can see you are fractured, my lady. Léizhènzǐ's staff could rend both Heaven and hell with a swipe. It is a miracle that enough of you was left to return.\"//\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n//\"As far as I am concerned, I am you, my Lady.\"// The Once-Was sighed. //\"Or rather, inseparable from you. My legacy is yours. My face is yours. My name is yours. To the world and everyone else, we are one and the same.\"//\n\nDaji nodded. \"I'm sorry, Once-Was. Truly.\"\n\nA scoff in response. //\"I know. Lady Nüwa's orders. You showed me, as you showed me your claws.\"//\n\n\"I tried to make it quick and painless.\"\n\n//\"My lady, you are a fox spirit, not a deliverer of miracles. You do not know how to kill painlessly. You are an animal, and I absolutely felt the force of your tails.\"//\n\nDaji winced, but resumed applying her shampoo.\n\nSeconds of silence turned to minutes. It would not be until the foxqueen had put on her clothes - clean ones, this time — before the Once-Was spoke again.\n\n//\"Thank you. For doing as you did.\"//\n\n\"You don't need to thank me, Once-Was.\"\n\n//\"Were it not for you, I would not have seen a world filled with all these marvels. It is because of you that I can see a world beyond my family's dreams. I was doomed to be a concubine to a cursed empire's harem. Perhaps being devoured was the best moment of my life.\"//\n\nDaji could say nothing in response.\n\nHow could she, to the Once-Was of Su Dájǐ?\n\n------\n\nA fist shot towards Daji's face. She twisted her head in response, allowing the attacker's momentum to trip him up for her.\n\nNot one to let an opportunity pass, Daji kicked the man in the crotch, causing him to fall over and groan.\n\n\"What the fuck are you doing?\" she asked, knocking him back down with a thrown bike as he tried to get up. \"Why are you here?\"\n\n\"I could say the same thing about you!\" yelled the man. \"Why are you here of all places?\"\n\n\"I buy food in this place, idiot, and the damn Jailors aren't here to bother me,\" she hissed, too quietly for the onlookers to hear. \"I can see that not even millennia could change that bayface of yours, Nézhā.\"\n\n\"Still looking down on me, fox bitch? I'll rip that pretty face of yours off with half my arms.\"\n\nHe tried to get up again, but Daji swept her legs, tripping him yet again. A kick to the head dropped the god.\n\nShe prepared to kick him again, but Nézhā held up a hand. \"Wait, demon, hold on.\"\n\nHe groaned as he pushed himself up before raising his hands in defeat. \"Look, can we continue this after I finish my delivery? The boss said if I'm late for another delivery, I'm getting fired.\"\n\nDaji rolled her eyes. \"I'm not here to fight, you idiot brat. You struck first. I'm just here to buy some vegetables.\"\n\n\"Sick, can you get some ginger too? I'm running out at my apartment.\"\n\nWithout letting Daji protest, Nézhā got up on his bike and began pedaling off, checking midtravel to make sure the food hadn't fallen apart.\n\nThe foxqueen rolled her eyes and entered the supermarket, ignoring the stares from the bystanders. She walked up to an employee.\n\n[[span class=\"ruby\"]]//\"m^^4^^hou^^2^^ ji^^3^^si^^1^^, goeng^^1^^ gei^^2^^ cin^^2^^ aa^^3^^?\"//[[span class=\"rt\"]]\"Excuse me, how much for the ginger?\"[[/span]][[/span]]\n\n[[span class=\"ruby\"]]//\"deoi^^3^^ m^^4^^ zyu^^6^^, ngo^^5^^dei^^6^^ mou^^5^^ saai^^3^^ goeng^^1^^ laa^^3^^.//\"[[span class=\"rt\"]]\"Sorry, we have no more.\"[[/span]][[/span]]\n\n//\"The godling won't be pleased, my Lady,\"// giggled the Once-Was.\n\nDaji's eyebrow twitched. With a sigh, she gave the man a forced smile before continuing with her groceries.\n\nShe would deal with the god's rage later.\n\nSure enough...\n\n\"How does a supermarket run out of ginger?\" Nézhā demanded. He swung his bike at her with one arm, as though he was holding a sword. \"Liar!\"\n\n\"Why are you asking me?\" asked Daji. She blocked the bike with one arm, then kicked the god away.\n\"Ask the supermarket!\"\n\nNézhā snarled, pulling the bike apart into two and attacking her with them. They shimmered in appearance, and Daji could see the resemblance between them and the familiar wheels the babyfaced god once used.\n\nSome things never changed.\n\nA thrust of her palm shattered Nézhā's stance. A follow-up kick knocked one of the wheels aside. She went for a third strike, but Nézhā was ready, his leg matching hers in the air. With a grunt, he twisted his leg, catching Daji by surprise. He tossed aside the bike halves and leaped at her.\n\nFists rained down on her, mostly blocked by her mortal shell's clothes, but irritating nonetheless. She leaned forward, and as was tradition, bit his nose.\n\n\"Damnit woman,\" howled Nézhā, clutching his face. \"Why is it always the face?\"\n\n\"Because you're stupid enough to get close to my teeth.\" Daji took one of the discarded bike halves and put them together. Almost instantly, they snapped back into place as one, as though never broken.\n\nWithout giving the god a chance to thank her, Daji slammed the bike down on his face. She glanced at the sun and squinted.\n\n\"Aren't you still working? It's early in the afternoon, godling.\"\n\nNézhā blinked and looked at his phone before turning pale. \"Shit, I thought it was still my lunch break.\" Immediately after, he swung his bike back and pedaled off as quickly as he had come.\n\n//\"The godling is a quick one,\"// noted the Once-Was. \"//I could scarcely keep up with both your movements.\"//\n\nDaji shook her head. \"He's an idiot, wasting so much time on us. Any //xiān// that needs to do delivery work has bigger matters than a rogue spirit.\"\n\n//\"On the topic of time, when you are done with your supper, I would like to watch the sunset with you, my Lady. Together, for once.\"//\n\n\"So be it.\"\n\n------\n\nThe Once-Was remained quiet for most of the afternoon. Were Daji not familiar with the overwhelming silence of loneliness, she might have been unnerved.\n\nBut the Once-Was's lack of a physical body meant it was as though nothing had changed.\n\nAs promised, Daji finished her dinner early — just a small bowl rice. The loss of the hotdog still stung. Better to make up for it with a low-budget meal.\n\nAfter washing the dishes, she sat outside and watched the yellow star fall on the green horizon.\n\n\"How is it?\" she asked the Once-Was, as the blue sky began to give way to more vibrant colors. \"This sunset?\"\n\n//\"It is a strange feeling. I know hundreds of years, thousands of years, have passed since I last saw the sun set, yet it seems just yesterday I was able to see something so beautiful.\"//\n\n\"That...\"\n\n//\"Yes, the first and last time I met you. You granted my wish to die facing the sun, so that I would not have my back turned to the end of an era. You made sure I died not ignorant.\"//\n\nDaji could say nothing in response.\n\n//\"I am happy, my Lady. Truly. My family used me to save the Su clan. Lord Jī Chāng saw me as an acceptable sacrifice. To marry a king of a declining empire, to bind me forever to the end of Shāng. You freed me from that.//\"\n\n\"You deserved better, Once-Was,\" sighed Daji. \"You were young, scarcely a woman when your life was stolen away from you.\"\n\n//\"We all deserve better, my lady. But life is not kind, and the sun sets on us all eventually.\"//\n\nThe last hints of the blue sky gave way to a brilliant orange sunset. The Once-Was sighed.\n\n//\"What will you do after eating the Jailor's gumiho, my Lady?\"//\n\n\"Unsure. Find fragments of myself, maybe. Topple the Primeval Lord of Heaven himself. Discover what really happened to Jiāng Zǐyá. Perhaps live in human society. Too many options to choose from.\"\n\n//\"May I offer a suggestion, Lady Daji?\"// asked the Once-Was. Daji tensed up at that. The name felt wrong, coming from the Once-Was of Su Dájǐ.\n\n\"Go on.\"\n\n//\"Let her be. Few of your kind are alive. Is killing one more worth what you gain yourself?\"//\n\n\"Awfully sentimental for a Once-Was.\"\n\nThe Once-Was sighed. //\"I was once mortal. Even if I'm not sure what I am now.\"//\n\nDaji could offer no response to that, and the two watched quietly as the sunset gave way to the purple hues of nightfall.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| previous-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oath-for-a-foxqueen\n| previous-title = Oath for a Foxqueen\n| next-url =\n| next-title = TBD\n| hub-url = https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/foxhunt-hub\n| hub-title = Foxhunt\n]]\n\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Naepic]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
