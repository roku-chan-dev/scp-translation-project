What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art.

There doesn't have to be.\n\nThink about everything that Anderson sells: prosthetic limbs, domestic drones, custom-made friends, war machines, toys, perhaps even the occasional branch-out into uncharted territory. There's got to be installation guides for such things, right? And what could such things say about the people who buy them?\n\nAlternatively, Anderson isn't just in the business of advertisement. Any manner of story could be told through the creative usage of production notes, schematics, and even inventory logs. How best might the horrors of Anderson be expressed in the production phase?\n\nThe possibilities, as with the list of Anderson's crimes, are endless.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write an Anderson Robotics format set in the Those Twisted Pines canon.\n* **For artists:** Draw up a schematic of \"Anderson Robotic's newest ______!\"",
