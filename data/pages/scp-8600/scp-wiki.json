An inscription in Mekhanite above the doorway reads //\"The Hall of the Empresses\"//. \n\nSCP-8600 comprises 10 rooms, each corresponding to a generation of the Bumaro dynasty. Each of them documents the life of the dynastic empress through plaques and murals, with bookshelves lining the walls containing books documenting the lives of the concubines, if any.[[footnote]] If no concubines were present during the ruling of a particular Emperor, the bookshelves are absent from the room. [[/footnote]] The rooms are otherwise empty. Of note is that neither the number of rooms, nor height of their walls correspond to the external dimensions of the building.\n\nThe rooms are aligned in a circular pattern around the centerpiece of SCP-8600, a fountain with a sculpture featuring three persons: a masculine figure sitting on a throne and two feminine figures standing around it. One of them is standing behind the masculine figure, while the other one is sitting on the floor next to him, embracing his legs.

And Emperor Hashir spoke unto the husband of his daughter, Astir, as such:\n\n17. \"Answer my question, Astir: who, in your mind, will inherit the Voice?\" \n\n18. And Astir answered as such: \n\n19. \"Shataash is the one who inherits the Voice, Emperor, as she is Your daughter.\"\n\n20. And Hashir said nothing, but asked Astir again: \n\n21. \"Answer my question again, Astir. Which one of you two resembles the blessed Mekhane more closely: you, or my daughter?\"\n\n22. And Astir answered as such: \n\n23. \"Shataash is the one who resembles the blessed Mekhane.\" \n\n24. He understood not why the Emperor was asking him these questions. \n\n25. As Shataash was His daughter, and as she was the one who resembles the Goddess, it was as solid as fuladh that she was the one set to inherit the Voice. \n\n26. And as if Hashir read the thoughts of the young man, He shook His head, and spoke unto him as such: \n\n27. \"Mekhane is our blessed Goddess, yet the Emperors wield Her as a tool. They forge Her fuladh and they borrow from Her voice. It has been decreed such ever since my father, the first Bumaro. And I have found his works to be good.\"\n\n28. And he continued as such: \n\n29. \"My daughter bears resemblance to the image of Mekhane. The blessings of the Voice befalls on the Man. Whether he is a descendant or not, it matters not.\"\n\n30. But Astir did not take a liking to these words. He understood not what significance did the words of the Emperor hold, and he understood not why Shataash cannot wield the Voice. \n\n31. \"Emperor, are you not suggesting in earnest that I wield my dear Shataash as a tool? And are you not suggesting her resemblance to Mekhane places her underneath me? Surely it must go the other way around?\"\n\n32. And the Emperor had enough of hearing the doubt in the voice of Astir. \n\n33. \"I am not suggesting. I am instructing. You question our ways. But that will not hold me back. I shall guide you to the Throne myself, and you will be overcome with understanding.\"\n\n34. Hashir did as told, and once Astir seated himself, he presented him a cylinder. \n\n35. \"This contains the memories of my father. I shall hand them over to you. You shall do the rest.\"\n\n36. As he inserted the cylinder into the Throne, Astir went silent. \n\n37. And from the doorway, this all was observed by Shataash. \n\n38. The words of her father, Emperor Hashir, cut her soul deeply. The power of the Voice mattered not to her, and yet she was wounded by his words. \n\n39. She understood not why her father would present her as a tool to Astir. \n\n40. She treated him as a peer, despite her being the Heiress, and him being a commoner. Surely, whatever her father presented to him will not sway him. \n\n41. And when she entered the throne room, her voice was tearful. \n\n42. \"Father, you would betray me so? Do you love me not?\"\n\n43. And Hashir did not look in her direction, instead observing the Throne. \n\n44. \"I do, Shataash, it is known. I ensured a proper upbringing for you. I taught you knowledge only the Emperors possess. But the blessing of the Voice was never yours to bear.\"\n\n45. And Astir sat in the throne, overcome with visions left to him by the first Bumaro. \n\n46. \"He will understand soon,\" Hashir proclaimed, and moved to leave the room. \"And with that, I leave you two to your own.\"\n\n47. And when he left through the side entrance, Astir has awakened. \n\n48. Shataash wanted to turn around and run, but she was unable to, as she found the main entrance to be locked. \n\n49. \"Astir...\" she spoke unto her husband, tearful, \"you love me, do you not?\"\n\n50. \"I do,\" came the answer of Astir, short and sharp, as the fuladh dagger. \n\n51. And when he opened his eyes to gaze upon his wife, Shataash recognized a sense of distance and cold that was not present prior. \n\n52. And she spoke unto him as such, hoping she would reach him: \n\n53. \"You are strong, Astir. And I love you. Please, give in not to what you saw. Our strength lays in our love.\" \n\n54. And Astir answered as such: \n\n55. \"I am strong, Shataash, and you know that. But I have tasted what it feels to be in charge. To be the one who controls. The strength of spirit pales next to the strength offered by power.\"\n\n56. \"Astir,\" Shataash pleaded him as such, \"please, resist.\"\n\n57. \"[[span class=\"voice\"]]SILENCE,[[/span]]\" Astir commanded his wife. And as the Voice left his lips, he finally understood. \n\n58. \"So this is how it feels,\" he whispered, looking at her. \"I understand now what your father meant when he told me this power was ours to bear.\"\n\n59. And words left the lips of Shataash no longer, as if her very throat was sealed. And she looked at him with fear in her eyes, and began weeping silently. \n\n----\n\n//[The murals show the life of Empress Shataash, including moments such as meeting with Emperor Astir and their marriage ceremony.

The scholars viewed many moves of Bileath with suspicion, despite knowing well that the very nature of their union went against the traditional union of Emperors and Empresses. \n\nAs the Voice had no effect on her, Bileath gave herself to the Emperor by will, instead of by force. \n\nThe Third Wisdom of Bileath laid in her vast and immeasurable knowledge in technology. As her husband required not for her to suppress her self in his service, she spent countless days and nights studying the scholarly texts of Amoni-Ram. She learned the most intricate ways of working fuladh, and she learned the ways of construction, design, and blueprinting. \n\nAnd when the scholars discovered faults within the efficiency of the transit system of the blessed Amoni-Ram, Ansool hesitated not to propose the blueprints of Bileath as a solution. And when the scholars scrutinized her blueprints, he offered them a test of wit and skills, as follows: \n\n\"If you want a blueprint from the Emperor, I will provide you one. I will provide you my plan for fixing the transit system. And whether mine or the ones of the blessed Bileath will be more efficient, you shall be the judge of that.\"\n\nAnd Bileath minded not the concerns of the scholars, as she knew their minds were closed as a circuitry and their conviction in the old ways of the Bumaros was as solid as fuladh. Instead, she looked forward to the blueprints of her husband with awe and curiosity. If he surpassed her, she would have not minded it, for she knew in their test of wits, their chances were equal. \n\nWhen the day of testing came, the blueprints of Ansool were brought out first. The efficiency problems were still present, though not as strongly as with the current railway system. And then the blueprints of Bileath were tested. The scholars were shocked to find out that the past efficiency problems were minimized as to be nonexistent. And they begrudgingly gave in, and admitted that the blueprints of the Empress were of better quality. \n\nThe skills of Bileath were put to test with great frequency, and with each test, she stood her ground. And in those in which she didn't, Ansool ensured to let the scholars know that one fault of the Empress undermined her skills not. \n\n\"One faulty blueprint of Bileath is enough to make your faith in her waver, yet countless faulty blueprints by me were not enough to shake your faith in me. Look into yourself, your spirit, and ask: why must the Empress be perfect to prove her skills? Why do you demand a level of perfection from her you demand not even from the Emperor?\"\n\nBut once her son grew into power, he was swift to conceal the origin of all her blueprints, to attribute them to Ansool in her stead. His wife possessed no resistance to the Voice, therefore the desire to dominate, the one not present in his father, cropped up. \n\nHe could not bear to see the success of his mother, as he feared it would plant the seed of dissent within the heart of his future wife. \n\nThe spirit of Ansool refused to bear this. The accomplishments of Bileath were hers, not his.  His memories resisted modifications, they resisted attempts to be erased. Even in death, he fought for her prowess. \n\n----\n\n//[The majority of the paintings show Empress Bileath sketching blueprints, attending meetings next to Emperor Ansool, [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fratricide leading the Golden Legion],[[footnote]] The designation given to the Mekhanite army of Amoni-Ram.
