All SCP-3765 instances located that are not in the custody of GOI-466 are to be contained within a Site-64 standard containment chamber and given sufficient food and water. After containment is established, instances of SCP-3765 are to be immediately reported to WWS Liason Frank Richardson and SCP-3765 Head Researcher Throckmorton. Civilian hunting of any beavers within Clackamas County, Oregon is to be discouraged through ad campaigns on local television networks by the WWS.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3765 is an anomalous group of //Castor canadensis//[[footnote]]North American Beaver[[/footnote]] consisting of at least 1400 beavers found in Clackamas County, Oregon, and centralized in the town of Boring. Instances of SCP-3765 have higher average intelligence and significantly higher collaboration skills than their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\nSCP-3765's primary anomaly is the ability to replicate any human structure after being allowed to examine a building or observe blueprints of a structure for a time relative to its complexity. Instances of SCP-3765 prefer to build their structures on riverbeds and other areas where non-anomalous beavers reside, but have been shown to take civilian \"clients\" for inland construction. It is worth noting that SCP-3765 will always use wood for all components of a structure, even when non-wood materials are called for[[footnote]]For example screws, nails, or washers[[/footnote]]. SCP-3765's secondary anomalous property is the ability to communicate in fluent English.\n\n\n**Addenda:**\n++ Addendum SCP-3765-1: Discovery\nSCP-3765 was brought to Foundation attention on ██/██/████ after GOI-466 (Wilson's Wildlife Solutions) received a number of phone calls from civilians encountering a group of beavers requesting the blueprints to their homes. See Addendum SCP-3765-2 for a transcript of one such call.\n------\n++ Addendum SCP-3765-2: Transcript\n> //(Caller calls GoI-466.

We went down to a riverbed where they were rumored to reside, and we were amazed by what we saw; they had built up almost a small town! They had things like a motel, tackle shop, and even a diner! All made out of wood, of course. We visited a building that looked exactly like City Hall, and we spoke to some of these beavers about what they were doing here. It was amazing the kind of ideas that they had, and the ambition they possessed.\n\n@@    @@After seeing firsthand the kind of craftsmanship and intelligence that these beavers have. We believe that these beavers; if put to work, could expand our operations by a large margin. If given the proper training, we could have these beavers building things for our operation. This could expand our facilities significantly, making it so that your Foundation would not have to do as much work for us.\n\n@@    @@We know you folks aren't too keen on using anomalies, you would rather keep them all contained, but we believe that the benefits far outweigh the minor breach in protocol that would be necessary.

We've spoken to them about our agreement and they seem ecstatic! We've already begun putting them to work building a new wing for our on-site dormitories, and they're doing a great job! We're thinking about teaching them how to use materials other than wood, but they seem a little apprehensive to that... They've streamlined our production of facilities and I think that our arrangement is going to be instrumental in the growth of the WWS. The good part for you is that they work for free so this should slash the amount of money you need to give us by a significant amount (see article 3 chapter 4 of the Boring Agreement for more details on the finances).\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 5px\"]]\n[[>]]\n**Kindest Regards,\nFrank Richardson**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n//**P.S.** I know it might be hard to do with all your super-serious top secret save the world stuff, but you should take a day off and see the beavers, it's amazing!//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n> **Dear Frank,**\n> I'm glad that the beavers are being put to good use, after studying their behavior, I feel like they will be of great help to you if you treat them with respect, of course.
