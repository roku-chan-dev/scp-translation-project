Site-27K does not manipulate its scales.\n\nSite-27K's proudest menu, the flounder is known for aiding with the growth of teenagers and good for dermatologic conditions that come with age including wrinkles. High protein contents and low fat contents of the subject prevents obesity. Younger consumers prefer this menu due to its texture. Flounders of Site-27K lack the rancid smell that the fish of other sites have, and has a unique texture, explaining its popularity.\n\nThe salmon sashimi of Site-27K has an incredibly richer flavour.
