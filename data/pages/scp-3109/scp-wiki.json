SCP-3109-1 Visible in upper right quadrant.,, ||\n[[/div]]\n**Item #:** SCP-3109\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid[[footnote]]Reclassification to \"Occam\" rejected on grounds that this object cannot be determined to be a natural or constructed anomalous phenomenon. In addition, the object cannot be confirmed to be self-containing, nor to have any benefit to maintaining collective normalcy. Until any of these points can be verified, Euclid classification remains appropriate. -HMCL Rachel Smith-09[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedure:** A Foundation automated quarantine zone is in effect around SCP-3109 at a distance of 5,000 km. Astronomical observation, robotic and manned exploration of the body formerly known as KBO 2448-U102 is strictly prohibited to all civilian entities.\n\nUN and Martian Nation States are permitted to continue basic reconnaissance and observation of the object, subject to informational transparency with Foundation Assets and other involved Nation States. Data obtained from these observations must be classified Top Secret within their respective governments. Non-Foundation equipment entering the quarantine zone may not be retrieved under any circumstances.\n\nExploration of SCP-3109 is subject to total loss at a rate of 40%. Surviving expeditions have internal loss rate exceeding 60%. All personnel assigned to SCP-3109 must be made aware of this prior to assignment. Exploration by D-Class Foundation assets must be voluntary by order of the Ethics Committee. Consent is not implied by prior voluntary D-Class service.\n\nFuther attempts to contact, sample, or neutralize SCP-3109-1 are prohibited.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3109 is a roughly spherical area centered on the newly discovered Kuiper Belt Object 2448-U102 with an approximate radius of 25,000 km. Material entering SCP-3109 may change in shape, size, chemical composition, and mass, and are also subject to various temporal and spatial distortions[[footnote]]Such alteration of objects and causality has been observed in roughly 22% of recorded missions.[[/footnote]]. The area is also subject to random manifestation of simple and complex objects, both organic and inorganic, including artifacts normally only known to be manufactured by humans[[footnote]]Manifestation of objects occurs in roughly 11% of recorded observations and missions.[[/footnote]]. Unlike other reality-altering phenomena observed within Foundation accessible space, Kant readings within the region consistently align with the vacuum background level of 0.92 and 1.05 Humes.\n\nSCP-3109-1 is an unidentified anomalous entity or object which exists in the vicinity of KBO 2448-U102 at a distance ranging between 0 and 10,000 km of the planetoid's surface. Though SCP-3109-1 is corporeal and visible to lidar, spectroscopic analysis of its composition remains inconclusive, suggesting composition of some exotic form of matter. Despite consistent changes in position, SCP-3109-1 does not move in the classical sense. Though apparent movement can be measured at either the leading or trailing edge, photographic and video evidence confirms that the bulk of SCP-3109-1 remains stationary at all times. The object proceeds through space by manifesting additional material at its leading edge, and annihilating material at its trailing edge. Due to this, SCP-3109-1 is capable of apparently instantaneous movement and acceleration in any direction. \n\nWhenever SCP-3109-1 approaches within 200 km of KBO 2448-U102's surface, the planetoid's topography, environment, and chemical composition are subject to radical changes. Alteration becomes more severe as SCP-3109-1's proximity increases. Observed alterations include manifestation of oxygen atmosphere, spontaneous generation of living organic material, creation of new mountain ranges, liquefaction of the planetoid's crust, and spontaneous nuclear explosion. Despite continued contact with SCP-3109-1, KBO 2448-U102's orbit remains stable, and remote measurements of its mass remain unchanged.\n\n**Discovery:** On 14 September 2448 CE, automated Martian deep-system survey equipment on Ganymede identified the 4th inclination of a new Kuiper Belt object approximately 1060 km in radius, and granted the designation KBO 2448-U102. Analysis of photographic data from the planetoid identified several unidentifiable anomalies in its observed brightness. Martian Navy assets dispatched a long distance probe to perform basic reconnaissance in hopes of retrieving additional water ice and complex organics from the site to stabilize deficits in Martian planetary eco-forming and asteroid belt holdings.\n\nThe probe entered local KBO 2448-U102 space on 05 January 2449 and began transmitting still images of the planetoid along with inconclusive spectroscopic analysis of another large (>200km in length) object apparently in orbit. Transmission continued for 37 minutes before the probe abruptly failed for unknown reasons (See Figure 1 Above). \n\nMartian Naval intelligence quickly notified UN Spacy and Foundation assets of possible anomalous activity, detained all persons directly exposed to the feed, and turned over their records to the Foundation in compliance with DSAAD[[footnote]]Deep Space Anomalous Activity Directive[[/footnote]] Article 1.\n\nUN Spacy assets revealed at that time that an additional, manned mission was in transit to KBO 2448-U102 as of 16 September 2448 in an attempt to establish a sovereign base on the planetoid for future Kuiper Belt operations, flying under radio blackout which would not be lifted by the crew until planned transmission on 07 February. Under duress, UN Spacy assets authorized the release of vessel designation and yielded contact frequencies and command of the mission to the Foundation on 12 January. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transmission Log 3109-01\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n> **Transmission Log 3109-01, 07022449**\n> \n> **Foreword:** //The following is a transcript of transmission between Foundation Site Enceladus-01 and Frigate Class Vessel \"UNV ██████████\" on 07 February 2449.

Please Respond with your mission status as soon as possible.\n> \n> **Captain Park:** SCP Researcher, this is a UN Spacy restricted frequency. No further communication will be acknowledged until we receive confirmation from Admiral █████ herself.\n> \n> //Admiral █████ provided verification through UN Spacy's on-world vessel. Conversation resumed after 45 minutes of radio silence.//\n> \n> **Captain Park:** SCP Site Enceladus-01, this uh... This is Captain Park reporting. I'm sorry, you have us at a loss. We're uh... This is a torpedo bomber designed for running military blockades. Just about the only thing we do is move fast, take pictures, and shoot back.\n> \n> **Researcher Van Allen:** Captain, I understand this is outside your normal mission parameters, and I'm very sorry. This situation is still evolving, and it's important for the safety of humanity that we not miss this opportunity to get important intelligence on KBO 2448-U102. You're equipped with video equipment, lidar, and a spectrometer, correct? Just that can tell us a lot.\n> \n> **Captain Park:** Enceladus, yes that's correct. But you can imagine, getting a call from the Foundation is not good news in deep space. We'll participate in the mission, but I need you to know that my crew and my ship come first and your intel comes second. I'd rather face a Court Martial than... I need some assurance that you're not going to screw us.\n> \n> **Researcher Van Allen:** Understood, ██████████, we are classing you as a provisional Class E asset. That makes your safety our top priority. Based on our telemetry, by the time you get this you'll be within 10,000 km of the object. I need you to perform a HARD deceleration burn as soon as possible. We don't know how far out this thing reaches yet. The farther away you can park, the better. Then point the forward array at the planetoid and send us anything you get back.\n> \n> //Telemetry data shows UNV ██████████ begins deceleration at 3G prior to stop 5000 km from the surface of KB 2448-U102. Data stream connected. Analysis reveals composition of complex organics, water ices, methane, amonia, carbondioxide, oxygen, and trace metals.//\n> \n> **Captain Park:** Enceladus, this...

Contact reestablished.//\n> \n> **Captain Park:** Mr. Van Allen, if you still read, here's our situation.  During our last transmission the ██████████ was attacked by an... entity? A ship? A geometric crystaline... shape of some kind. I don't know exactly how, but it changed size, shape, speed, color... We'll send you video now but... I could barely see it. Rodriquez in weapons thinks it was hiding in the shadow of our planetoid. Lidar didn't even see it until it was 20km away. Right now we're limping home. The contents of our galley, a significant portion of our atmo, and about 2/3rds of our Deuterium vented into space during that last burn. Still leaking a little air. We have... Rod what was it? Two weeks operation time at current thrust. That'll put us just inside Saturn's orbit and about another week from your position before we're sunk. Please advise.\n> \n> **Researcher Van Allen:** Captain Park, you and your crew did wonderfully. Foundation vessels will rendezvous with you at attached coordinates in nine days. Keep in touch.\n> \n> **Afterword:** //UNV ██████████ retrieved without incident. Ship's engineer, Lieutenant Velma Wirth, deceased of acute radiation exposure. All surviving crew members demonstrate various stages of radiation sickness. Radiation source unknown. Crew, vessel, and all material inside vessel subject to decrease in volume and mass of 0.2%.

The anomaly is dangerous and unpredictable, and allowing its continued existence in the Kuiper belt has the potential to destabilize future prospecting operations, and thereby the existence of all extraterrestrial human presence. Mars and Ceres included. Attached to this proposal are plans for an array of N-dimensional manifold inhibitors capable of contracting and isolating the entirety of the current containment strata within a standard S-213 causal isolation cell. Please consider this option seriously, expenses notwithstanding.//\n> \n> - Jr Researcher [[[Set Up Thine Altar Here|Dr. Thaddeus Xyank]]], Extra-spatial Topology\n\n> //Proposal rejected by 3-9 decision.
