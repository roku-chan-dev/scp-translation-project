It had hung over his head every day, a thing unfinished; there was always more to plan, more to learn about the various Sites and Groups of Interest, more work to be done to ensure that the most ambitious thing he'd yet attempted reached a firm and satisfying conclusion. It had taken months -- months! -- of his life, hours upon hours of research, and more preparation than he'd have been able to imagine back when he first conceived of this harebrained scheme. From a deceptively simple germ of an idea, it had grown and grown into a genuine monster. The platonic ideal of feature creep. The most nightmarishly convoluted thing he could ever imagine having to plot out, an impenetrable web of lies and misdirection, a machine made entirely out of moving parts. Its final shape did not //quite// represent the limits of his imagination, but this singular concept? Oh, yes, he felt he had done everything there was to be done with it.\n\nFor this, impossibly, was the end. After today, it would all be over but the crying.\n\nDaniil Sokolsky did not intend to be the one in tears.\n\n\"He's been loose in the Site this whole time?!\" Eileen Veiksaar looked close to tears herself. \"You knew he was probably going to knock us out, and you just let him do it?!\"\n\n\"I forgot you weren't there for the briefing.\" They were jogging down the halls of I&T, headed for the communications server room. \"I keep picturing you there, because it was in your office.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes.\n\n\"These ops are no good if we don't know what the moles want.\" Glass-walled computer labs sailed past, lights off, screens dark. \"The whole point was to gather intel, not just stomp on sabotage. Pensak's a planner, but he's not a dreamer. He's doing what he's doing for someone else. If we took him out ahead of time, we'd never know who sent him. Who masterminded attacks across the globe, Eileen. That's worth a little risk.\"\n\n\"But the Site! The whole goddamn Site!\" She looked like she wanted to strangle him; then again, the unaccustomed exercise was making them both turn red. \"Tell me Alpha-9 is coming.\"\n\n\"Odds are they've been called away. Pensak would've made sure of it.\"\n\n\"ETTRA?\"\n\n\"Same deal.\"\n\n\"What about the other Sites? 87? 246?\"\n\n\"Told them to stand by. We don't know... how bad... this is going... to be.

Where did you get... three more?!\" She took a deep breath. \"//Four// more, because... you obviously... still have... one?\" She was in worse shape than he was, but didn't like to show it.\n\n\"Four more,\" Sokolsky mused. \"Let's see.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 2017\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 8 September\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"Time travel doesn't work that way.\" Thaddeus Xyank, Director of the Temporal Anomalies Department, was clearly unimpressed.\n\n\"It absolutely doesn't.\" Alice Forth, Director of the Department of Temporal Anomalies, was even less impressed.\n\n\"This isn't time travel. It's timeline travel.\" Sokolsky was an impulsive individual, and he hated oversight. He was a man with an efficient mind, so he also hated redundancy. Worst of all he hated being confused, so the existence of two different departments with almost the same name whose heads either couldn't or wouldn't explain the difference between their duties was almost more than he could bear.\n\nBut only almost. If their meddling was required to make this work, then so be it. It was simply too perfect an opportunity to pass up.\n\nThey watched on the monitor as a confused old man in a labcoat walked the halls of Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D, just as he had on 9 September last year when the recursive annual explosion had killed him very dead indeed. Dr. Adrijan Zlatá had been the victim of a catastrophic computer glitch which put him in the worst possible place at the worst possible time, and considering the place in question was AAF-D he'd be living that worst possible time over and over and over each year for all eternity. Zlatá had been a good scientist and an amiable sort, so Sokolsky considered that unfortunate. He'd also been carrying SCP-5109 in his head, however, which Sokolsky had considered an unbearable tragedy.\n\n\"It'll only work once,\" Xyank predicted. \"Just the once.\"\n\n\"There's nothing in any model to suggest why it should work more than once,\" Forth agreed.\n\n\"Just watch,\" Sokolsky sighed.\n\nOne man and one woman in strange black uniforms materialized in front of Zlatá, who responded with not unexpected shock. (It was even less unexpected for already having happened last year.) The man waved a small black penlight in Zlatá's eyes, while the woman seized his shoulders and leaned in. As if in a trance, the doctor began to speak; they couldn't hear it, since the cameras in AAF-D hadn't been able to transmit sound back in 2002, and AAF-D was now experiencing 2002 for the fifteenth time.\n\nWhen Zlatá finished speaking, the first man waved the magic wand again. By the time Zlatá blinked, they had disappeared.\n\nThe baffled doctor leaned on a nearby pillar for support. It exploded in a shower of neon sparks, and he turned bright white for just a moment before hitting the tiles as a rain of pink-skinned blue lemons, split neatly down the middle.\n\nThere was a rush of air, and Sokolsky turned around. The two TAD agents saluted Xyank, who nodded. \"Well?\"\n\nThe female agent nodded back. \"I have the password.\"\n\nForth cursed under her breath. \"But we already got it back from him //last year!//\"\n\n\"That was the last-year version of him.\" Sokolsky pointed at the monitor. \"He's been incorporated into the loop now. Every time 5243 brings him back, he'll have a fresh instance of 5109 in his head.\"\n\n\"Where did you get this 'instance' theory from, anyway?\" Xyank asked.\n\nSokolsky shrugged. \"Lucky guess.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ 2021\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"one column\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ 2 January\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n\"And that's... it?\" Veiksaar shook her head.\n\n\"Yup.

The quandary presently vexing her had dominated her existence for... well, she preferred not to think about that. The situation hadn't seen any progress in a great many years; neither had she, as far as an untrained observer wandering past her only window on the world would see. Her hair, her clothing, her long labcoat and her surroundings were all hopelessly out of date. She was a moving picture from a different era, and only she knew for certain that she was three-dimensional.\n\nShe was thinking, as she nearly always was, about getting out. The Anomalous Documents Disposal Chamber in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-A was her domain, and her prison. For reasons too complicated to explain [/scp-5616 except at length], if she left this room the lingering effects of an old workplace accident would kill her almost instantly.\n\nThere had been times when that hadn't sounded so bad. Times when the chance to step outside and breathe the air of a changed world -- even the //recycled// air of a changed world -- had seemed almost worth the near certainty of violent death. The years had taken a great many things from her, though she'd taken in a great deal herself. Because of that, because of what she'd done with her almost limitless free time, those self-destructive thoughts were mostly in her distant past. She'd learned too much, //achieved// too much to give up now. It wouldn't be long before she cracked the case, her case, then cracked open that long-sealed door and escaped to safety. Not long.\n\nNever long.\n\nThere was a flash from the computer monitor facing her window in the hall. Apparently she had a message. AAF-A was a long way from the bulk of Site-43, having been the very first facility constructed on the shores of Lake Huron, and most people preferred to place a call rather than visit her 'personally'.\n\n//Not like they can get up close anyway.//\n\nShe walked to the window and picked up a pencil off the sill. It was attached to a string, which was itself attached to the window by a piece of ancient but unaging masking tape. On the other side of the window was a high-gain microphone; when she held the pencil in her hand, she could be heard. She had telepresence in most well-travelled areas of the Site, ostensibly so she could weigh in on important intellectual matters. Really, she knew, it was to make her feel like part of the family. Like this was her home.\n\nShe had never set foot in the main facility of Site-43.\n\n\"Accept.\" The screen flashed again, and a bald face appeared. \"Hello, Daniil. You look harried.\"\n\nSokolsky huffed. \"You should see how Harry looks.\"\n\n\"It's happening?\"\n\n\"Just like I said. You ready?\"\n\nShe smiled. \"End call.\" Her desktop reappeared. \"Execute program TELEAANWEZIGHEID.\" A neatly-labelled map of Site-43 appeared on her monitor, and Sokolsky began to recite something that sounded like gibberish but wouldn't for long.\n\nJust as she had been doing since time immemorial, she built up a store of knowledge in preparation for the next step.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nVeiksaar unspliced the leads running from the conference room screen to the PDA they'd snagged from her deputy chief's office.

He kicked her once with each leg, then stopped. \n\n\"Passwords.\"\n\n\"Ayup.\"\n\n\"You said you only had four more! And they're all in use, except the one you kept!\" She really did look like she might cry.\n\n\"Oh, yeah.

The one he thought had animal scat inside? It didn't have animal scat inside.\"\n\nHer lip quivered. \"I mean, I didn't think it did. Whatever was in there was rattling around.\"\n\nSokolsky shrugged. \"Could've been //dried// animal scat.

There were those who could themselves be considered mad, and Bremmel didn't begrudge them this; one of his fondest memories was being mistaken for Everett Mann at a Site-19 colloquium back in 2018. (One of his least-fond memories was being mistaken for Danny DeVito on Halloween of the same year; he had also once been told, by Harold Blank, that he looked like some famous archaeologist or other. Bremmel had been unwilling to admit that 'famous archaeologist' represented an extant category of human being.) But then there were those whose science itself carried the stigma of insanity, the cohort to which Bremmel could proudly claim affiliation. His specific mania was for tools, machinery, and weaponry, which was why he was the Chief of Arms and Equipment at Site-43.\n\nIt certainly wasn't because of his leadership skills. Bremmel might have looked like a kindly old man -- wild, wispy grey hair on the back of his head, a pot belly, a denim jacket under his dark blue engineer's labcoat and a perpetually rheumy expression -- but whenever the gears in his head stopped spinning, whenever he turned from thoughts of stress values and blast radii and crush depths and discovered the real world in front of him, his blurry eyes narrowed and his slouch tensed up and he lashed out at anyone within lashing range. He'd been through nine lab assistants since he started at Site-43 in 1985, and more than a few of them were now in permanent detention at Site-06-3. He had a talent for transferring his agitation to others.\n\nBremmel, in short, didn't care for having to pay attention to the way things were. He was somewhat more interested in the way things might be, with the application of a little elbow grease and copious quantities of actual grease, but mostly he preferred imagination to reality. He was, at this moment, in an in-between state thanks to the collision of Daniil Sokolsky's plan with Roger Pensak's. He had things to do, but he couldn't do them yet. He had to //wait.//\n\nHe somehow liked the combination even less than the individual states.\n\n\"Plug it back in,\" he snapped. \"We'll run another diagnostic.\"\n\nHis lab assistant shook her head. \"We already ran three. It works. It's fine. Do you have the remote still?\"\n\nHe patted his labcoat breast pocket. It jangled. \"Somewhere in here.\" He paused, then patted each of his other four pockets. \"Or in here. It's fine.\" He blinked. \"Plug it back in, I said.\"\n\n\"He'll think we meddled with it if we plug it back in!\" Joanna Bremmel put both hands on her hips and glared at him. She reminded him of her mother when she did that -- not because her mother had been easily offended (or Joanna would certainly never have been conceived), but because her mother had also had hips. Bremmel himself was roughly rectangular. \"He'll be here any minute, and then I can get my password.\"\n\nBremmel shook his head. \"I told them not to include you.\"\n\n\"What?!\" She stomped her foot, now reminding him of himself. \"Why? We've got security guards, dad, so it's not //your// job to protect me.\"\n\nBremmel reached out and fiddled with the gun on its pair of metal mounts. \"I told them not to include you because you're no good at taking orders. Probably screw the whole thing up. For example: PLUG IT IN!\"\n\nAt this moment, the door to the workshop slid open. Pensak entered, service weapon in hand. \"Plug it in?\" he repeated. \"I thought it was finished.\"\n\n\"It //is// finished,\" Joanna growled.\n\n\"Good.\" Pensak walked up to the gun, an ugly mess of welded metal and multicoloured wires, and examined it carefully. \"I'll take it.\"\n\nJoanna considered picking up her chair and braining him, but only because she'd seen movies. It wasn't a serious consideration. Bremmel hardly even seemed to notice when Pensak lifted his experimental weapon off the table and left the workshop; his eyes were already glazed over again.\n\nA minute after the door slid shut, the intercom beeped. \"Assistant Researcher Bremmel?\" a woman's voice asked.\n\n\"That's me,\" Joanna agreed.\n\n\"Are you ready to receive?

He slung its black Mylar strap over his back, the reassuring weight reminding him that if push came to shove he could literally tunnel his way out of Site-43 and into the surrounding tunnels through sheer bedrock. Bremmel had based the design on something he'd built in an alternate timeline, a device he'd only heard about second-hand; it didn't take much to set a mad scientist's feverish imagination ticking over. He'd been more than thrilled to explain the thing to Pensak, thinking nothing of his unusual interest in a weapon far too expensive and destructive to ever see Security and Containment use. Pensak had wanted to know if there were any moving parts, what kind of ammunition it used, whether it carried an electric charge, whether it could in any way be used to harm its own user. He'd then stolen the blueprints and had them checked out with his source for illicit tech, a crotchety old woman who'd once worked at Prometheus Labs. She'd declared it absolutely safe to steal, and then offered to pay him more money than he'd earned in ten years at the Foundation if he stole it for her specifically.\n\nIt wasn't that he thought Bremmel was clever enough to suspect treachery, or conscientious to try and prevent it. It wasn't that he really thought Sokolsky would try to remotely electrocute him with a stolen rifle. It was more that Pensak hadn't allowed himself one inch of intellectual slovenliness since deciding to embark upon this enterprise. Everything was planned out well ahead of time, and in excruciating detail. Nothing left to happenstance, or the wiliness of others.\n\nHe walked into Eileen Veiksaar's office, noting that the Sampis were all still slumped on the floor. Just as he'd planned. As he approached her desk, he noticed that all of the books had fallen out of the case Veiksaar herself had been leaning on. She was somewhere under a pile of technical literature. That struck him as hilarious.\n\nHe had realized Sokolsky was missing by the time he reached Veiksaar's terminal. He had begun to suspect that Veiksaar wasn't under that pile of books by the time the terminal booted up.\n\nBy the time he saw that his database download had been cancelled, a million priceless nuggets of data lost to him quite permanently, he no longer felt quite so certain about the soundness of his plan.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOn the screen, Pensak's mouth was moving very rapidly.

Pensak was rushing for the Security and Containment Section, his personal bailiwick, a hideous hunk of machinery on his back. \"I'm going to keep count, you know. Of the passwords.\"\n\nSokolsky reached across the desk to pat her hand. \"Let me know what number you come up with, and I'll tell you the relevant truths.\"\n\nPensak had reached S&C, and was stepping into his own office.

He didn't have time for an internal monologue. Things were going wrong. He had to work fast.\n\nAll his agents were sequestered in the barracks, save for three -- Todd, Donovan, and Khan -- who were heading through the containment blocks in his direction. That wouldn't do. He unlocked and opened every chamber door; there weren't many Keters at Site-43, but there were enough Euclids of sufficient complexity to keep those three occupied for a while. Long enough.\n\nHe tabbed away, so he didn't see them split up and start accessing the exterior keypads, re-locking the doors with their copies of the once one-time password. He also didn't see the least-dangerous Euclid of all leave its cell and head for the elevator with singular purpose.\n\nHe set off the alarms in the Habitation and Sustenance Section, after raising their volume to a deafening level. He didn't intend to visit the dorms until he needed to take the elevator, and he still had items to collect before that happened. The Chief of H&S would have a thirty-second window to cancel the alarm, not that he could do so without a copy of SCP-5109.\n\nNoor Zaman, the Chief in question, was the fastest typist at Site-43. Forty-one characters in thirty seconds was no challenge at all. The alarms never went off, not that Pensak noticed. He //should// have noticed, because of course whenever his commands were cancelled he was meant to //get// a notice. He didn't, because I&T Technician Winston Barkley used his copy of the password to shut down the notifications system. Zaman and Barkley would sleep the sleep of the just, stunned by Pensak's memetic payload at their respective terminals.\n\nThe last thing he did in his office was disable the topside interdiction zone. He was counting on extraction, and the electrified fence and electronic countermeasures would have made that difficult.\n\nHe was much happier not knowing that I&T Technician Tomas Abreu immediately restored those countermeasures, and that fact that said technician got knocked out for his troubles would have hardly provided much consolation.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Wake up, sleepyheads.

A quick look at his tablet revealed--\n\n\"Fuck!\" he shouted. He wanted to fling the tablet to the floor, but he obviously couldn't, so he kicked the nearest chair and tore a strip of green fabric off it. Someone had blocked everything he'd done in S&C. Someone knew what he was up to.\n\nSomeone was watching him.\n\nAs an experiment, he shut off the cameras in the ISSS. The red light blinking above him briefly went dim -- and across the Site, from the comfort of his bed, Technician Bevan swiped up a storm on his PDA then fell instantly unconscious -- and then the light came back again. The cameras had only been offline for forty seconds, tops.\n\n\"FUCK!\" The tablet was shock-proof and shatter-proof, so he swatted the camera down with it. There were no sparks, just a tinkling of glass and a satisfying metallic //crunch.//\n\n//Clio.// It had to be, somehow. He sent the .aic a kill command -- and Clio's avatar disappeared from the conference room monitor -- and Veiksaar restarted her with forty-two taps of her tablet.

The word had reappeared the next year, in the company of the phrase 'matter of serious concern'. The year after that had seen the advent of the word 'terrifying', which had appeared in every subsequent review in a wide variety of different contexts until the present day. He had every reason to expect Nhung Ngo, his psychologist of record, to come up with an even more hyperbolic intensifier once the actions he was presently engaged in came to light.\n\n\"Can I get dressed?\" Wettle whined.\n\nHe was always whining.\n\n\"No,\" Sokolsky told him, \"but you //can// get your naked self out of my lab. They'll be taking your Humes in the next room.\"\n\nSokolsky had just finished stripping Wettle of his clothes, since they belonged to an alternate dimension. He'd just come back from stopping the Breach that Keeps On Breaching, SCP-5243, thereby restoring the prime timeline which from Sokolsky's perspective had never been interrupted. Precisely one day later, Wettle, his clothing, and his fellow task force members and //their// clothing would catch up with that fact. They would be debriefed by Ngo, relay their no doubt traumatic experiences in the alternate reality they had just successfully erased, and they would try even harder next year not to accidentally create an alternate timeline again.\n\nPTF Sampi-5243 (\"See You in September\") had correctly play-acted the events of 8 September 2002 seven times, resulting in no changes to the timestream, and they had screwed it up three times. This last time had been different, however, and the difference meant that Daniil Sokolsky was about to have to make a call to Overwatch Command. Someone up there would know what he knew, because someone up there would have read the psych reviews that called him terrifying and they'd guess what was about to happen.\n\nYou couldn't bring an object back from an alternate timeline. All objects snapped out of existence after twenty-four hours. The One-Time Password had been discovered in 2009, however, and it was not an object. Sokolsky knew himself well. He knew what he'd do if he discovered that his reality was about to end, but a bit of sleight-of-hand could bestow a lasting memento unto himself.\n\nHours later, when all the staff had returned to their dorms, Sokolsky took Wettle's labcoat out of the plastic container he'd dropped it into. It had to be Wettle, of course, because Wettle was an idiot. Wettle wouldn't notice. Wettle never even put his hands into his own pockets, because Wettle had absolutely zero self-consciousness.\n\nWettle's lower right pocket contained a USB stick.\n\nSokolsky inserted it into his laboratory terminal. His hands didn't shake.

Archives and Revision was one of the largest historical research groups within the Foundation, and Acroamatic Abatement was the nerve centre of its push to neutralize dangerous anomalous byproducts. These two functions were built into the infrastructure of the Site; every Section had circulation systems for transporting documents either to storage facilities or incinerators, every research lab could summon texts or samples and see them delivered on an endless series of conveyor belts and elevators within a matter of minutes. Keeping the system clear, preventing blockages, and preventing intentional misuse was one of the most important duties performed by the Site's artificially intelligent conscript, Cliometria.\n\nAt the moment, however, Clio was otherwise occupied.\n\nSunita Misra had no illusions of escape. Pensak had told her, quite frankly, how far he was willing to go today if his opponents pushed him to it -- and she hoped they would. This place was only marginally less an unholy nightmare than had been Site-36, a prison complex built beneath stolen and sacred indigenous land. She wouldn't be sorry to see it go...\n\nBut Pensak's plan made no provision for the destruction of the books and artifacts which filled the halls of Theology and Teleology, Site-43's religious research Section. Misra was going to make sure that if anyone decided to dig them back up, they'd find nothing but ashes.\n\nShe locked the door behind her, and considered. She was standing in a rotunda surrounded with offices and filled with desks and computer terminals, one in the centre raised up on a slight daïs. That was her destination. If Pensak had been telling the truth -- and in this single case, he had no reason not to be -- that would be where the Section Chair monitored his underlings and managed the circulation system.\n\nShe stepped onto the little platform, sat down, and flicked on the monitor. The computer had already been on, so it was just a matter of entering the credentials Pensak had supplied, then typing in the copy of 5109 they hadn't had time to make her surrender. //Praxis.// She found the relevant application quickly, noted that all of T&T's religious and sacrilegeous texts were sitting safe and sound in their hoppers... and with a few keystrokes, and a few more applications of the one-time password, she sent them on their long and winding road to incineration.\n\nOne of the office doors opened, and before Misra even saw her target, she had the service weapon she'd taken from the S&C lockup out of its holster and precisely aimed.\n\nA middle-aged woman in a labcoat was standing in the office doorway, her posture arrogant, her expression... playful? She had a messy topknot of greying hair, enormous black-rimmed glasses and a gold medallion around her neck. Misra recognized the symbols on the medallion, and felt a rush of rage: it was like a sampler of religious iconography, no doubt to provide some small protection from the profane objects these people handled daily.\n\n//Give me an excuse to see if it stops bullets.//\n\n\"Hi,\" the woman said. \"I'm Brenda.\"\n\nMisra glanced at the terminal, confirmed that the books were on their way to destruction, and stood up. \"How did you get out of your office, Brenda? They're all supposed to be password-locked.\"\n\nBrenda shrugged. \"Universal perversity, maybe? Or are you one of those idiots who thinks everything happens for a reason?\"\n\nThe urge to shoot the woman intensified. \"Of course you wouldn't be a believer, in your line of work.\"\n\nBrenda smiled. It was a condescending smile. \"I used to be. Why else would I sign up to study gods and godlings and godhead? But it's been...\" Misra thought she spied a flicker of weariness on the woman's face. \"I dunno, it's been a discouraging process. The world seemed a lot more full of wonder before I read the database that covers it end-to-end. Before I knew the extent of the heavenly hosts on Earth, and saw honestly not a lot worth writing home about.\"\n\nMisra felt her temper rising. \"This is a pointless conversation.\"\n\nBrenda shrugged. \"Let's get to the point, then. You have the password in your head, and obviously I do too. What do you think it means?\"\n\n\"Means?\"\n\n\"The words. Throw out the numbers, and consider the words. It's a phrase, right? What does it mean?\"\n\nMisra's arm was getting tired, but she kept the gun levelled. \"I don't think it means a thing. Is this your gotcha moment? Are you trying to get me to admit that there's meaningless shit in the world? Because I've gotta say, that dog won't hunt with me. I was GOC, lady. I know that not everything has meaning. I know all about //futility.// Even if I could really understand all this anomalous nonsense, I wouldn't be ennobled by the knowledge. I'm not going to waste my time craving things that don't satisfy. That's what faith has given me.\"\n\nCorbin laughed. \"Wow, you do go on, huh? Good for you, having all that thought through. But I don't agree. The password definitely means something! It means that //nothing// has meaning. It's a riddle for the ages, secret knowledge only a select few can possess, and yet it's a goddamn joke, isn't it? How profoundly unsatisfying. How //absurd.//\"\n\nMisra felt her finger tightening on the trigger. \"So what?\"\n\n\"Do you know where it came from? We think it was burned off one of our subjects in containment. Not a god, //per se,// but something even stranger. That breach shaved a slice off of a primordial force in human form, and not only is that slice completely comprehensible, it's downright disappointing. How does that make you feel?\"\n\nMisra sighed. \"Like you've been wasting my time.\"\n\nCorbin grinned. \"Bingo!\"\n\nMisra blinked. She frowned. She turned to look at the terminal, and a strange feeling of free-fall struck her, and she called up the circulation system's internal security cameras.\n\nThe books weren't heading for the incinerator anymore. They were bunching up on the conveyor belts, running up against.. nothing. Absolutely nothing.\n\nNothing she could see.\n\n//Thaumaturgy.// The books were striking an invisible thaumaturgic barrier. Misra sat down, gun still pointed unerringly at Corbin's forehead, and tried to redirect around the obstruction.\n\nThe system refused her request.\n\nCorbin clearly heard the error tone. \"Something wrong?\"\n\nMisra typed the password out again with one hand, fingers flying frantically. Once again, her request was refused. \"The access code's changed!\" she shouted. She kicked off the chair, and it rolled off the daïs and fell over. \"To //what?!//\"\n\nCorbin pretended to consider. \"Have you tried Morse Code?\"\n\nMisra figured out the joke in the moment before the main door to the rotunda -- which she had locked with the one-time password -- slid open, and a [/scp-5583 pink unicorn in a tutu] walked in and blasted her across the room with a solid stream of sparkling colour.\n\nThe last thing she thought before striking the wall was that the joke, like most things, was basically meaningless.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Gift.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThere was a stock thought in the //spiritus mundi// which Pensak had himself never once thought.\n\n//This can't be happening.//\n\nHis years with the IDF had taught him both to recognize and to accept reality as such. He'd been tasked with making Byzantine plots digestible, irrational motives comprehensible, and reprehensible deeds palatable. His years with the Foundation had focused and honed these skills, though Site-43 both encouraged and required less devious thinking than most other postings. In all this time he had never once sunk to contemplating that desperate phrase:\n\n//This can't be happening.//\n\nThis day was meant to be a strictly ordered series of actions and consequences, and he was in control.

The subway station at R&E wouldn't let him in, because somebody -- Senior I&T Technician Ruan, though he didn't know that -- had turned the lockdown he'd meant for McInnis around on him. He was able to bypass it and break into Quantum Supermechanics, where he intended to hijack the stochastic network and start predicting these unexpected attacks... but even though he'd installed a backdoor into the QS server, he found that someone -- Section Chair Xinyi Du, though he didn't know that -- had changed the password on him. He tried to handshake with the I&T server and completely shut it down, to perform a full permissions wipe -- Dr. Cann put the kibosh on. Pensak wasn't having this shit anymore, so he tried it again. This time Dr. Dray cancelled his shutdown request. It took him three more tries, and his deeply buried meme-sender knocking out both Drs. Rance and Wichman, to finally kill the thing. He watched the router on the ceiling carefully, and when the blinkenlights were cycling in just the right way to suggest that the server was back online, he tried to log in... and all the notifications he'd been missing since this farce began flooding his screen, thanks to Joanna Bremmel. He wasn't going to be able to alter any more passwords now, not even the ones he'd altered ahead of time.\n\n//This. Can't. Be. Happening.//\n\nHe entered Memetics and Countermemetics, found a wall panel and jacked in. //Lights out, everybody,// he thought fiercely as he deployed the memetics package he'd installed a week ago -- and got nothing but an error message in response, because Lillian Lillihammer had just finished deleting his files. She was now sleeping cross-legged in her office, which was at the end of a long tunnel designed to neutralize memetic effects. That was lucky, because if he'd been able to see her from the hall, he would've vaporized her with Bremmel's gun.\n\nAt any rate, he wanted blood. It was time to even the odds.

He nodded.\n\nPensak was hopping mad about the detour, and he did something about it. He tried to set off an EMP bomb Bremmel had been building in the central lab. Bremmel had built a killswitch into it, of course, which he'd given to Max Vroom -- the tech chief Lillihammer had brought back with her from Site-45. Vroom took his first hit for the team.\n\n\"He'll go far,\" Sokolsky mused. \"Probably get your job.\"\n\nA hail of gunfire erupted around Pensak's feet as he ran out of the R&E sectors, and they saw Delfina Ibanez barrelling towards him. He pointed his tablet at the door to the utility corridors and hammered at it madly; the door slid open, then shut behind him. Ibanez set to punching at the keypad, but her quarry now had a forty-one character lead.\n\nBack in Admin and Oversight, Pensak raced past Elstrom's office. He was heading for the real prize. There was little doubt what he was about to try to do. Veiksaar looked at Sokolsky, and saw worry in his eyes for the first time.\n\nEver.\n\nMcInnis' personal terminal in the Director's office was sunken into his desk, and it took a passcode to access. It also took a passcode to deny that access, so Drs. Wettle and Voclain in A&R both knocked themselves out to stop him.

A catastrophic structural event is imminent. All personnel, proceed to the topside elevator for extraction.\" They would have a hard time doing that, locked in their rooms, but Pensak didn't care. He was well beyond caring about anything at this point. He was //done.//\n\nWhen he was out of range, the door to McInnis' personal washroom swung open and the All-Sections Chief stepped in. He pulled out the Director's desk chair, sat down, and began to type out a string of code which would perpetuate the alarm cycle even if the self-destruct protocol were deactivated. It was a substantial change, so it required a password; //the// password, specifically.\n\nIt was a comfortable chair for sleeping in.\n\nMcInnis himself emerged from the washroom, checked his deputy's pulse, sat down on the floor and pulled the keyboard and monitor down with him.

Soporific gas intended for the Security and Containment chambers overhead began leaking into the hall -- Dr. Yang had utilized an ingenious backdoor through the payroll system, then went to his restful reward -- and Pensak broke into Helena Forsythe's office, snatched the tablet out of her unconscious fingers, and shut the valves. He then tried to overstress the tanks, blowing out the entire sytem; that didn't work, though it did indirectly put Senior Agent Jeremy Farrow to sleep.\n\nThe windows of Forsythe's office shattered one by one, and Pensak ducked down out of sight.

Reactivating the Site-to-Site network would almost certainly carry a cognitohazardous effect, though Corbin would send her password back to the general pool before doing so. Still, Pensak was likely waiting for just this very play, and would have the system shut down again before long. \"We're not likely to get more than a few minutes of communication.\"\n\n\"That's fine. If I'm right, there'll be a call coming in from Germany. If I'm wrong, call Site-246 and have them send in the marines.\" Site-246 was located on the floor of Lake Superior, and therefore no stranger to underwater operations; an amphibious unit had been sent in as backup hours ago, and was waiting for the signal to enter 43 via the floodgates. They were probably getting anxious -- the water panthers hadn't attacked Foundation forces in decades, but they weren't precisely welcoming either.\n\nIt didn't end up mattering. Getting the comms back up did, in fact, take Brenda Corbin down, and there was, in fact, a pending transmission request from Site-54.\n\nPhilip Deering and Amelia Torosyan, battered and bruised and very, very tired-looking, appeared on Ilse's screen. \"Need another password?\" Amelia asked.\n\n\"I think we'll have two, in a moment,\" Phil remarked.

Ascher and Reyes fried two sequential keypad locks, and Pensak obliterated both doors with the gun he'd taken from Bremmel's workshop. He was in Habitation and Sustenance, finally, and had clearly decided to cut his losses. He was making a beeline for the elevator.\n\nMore potshots from Ibanez, and he immediately changed course. \"Must have mapped out a dozen routes beforehand,\" Sokolsky remarked with obvious admiration. It didn't work out for him, however, because the next keypad he tried to access wouldn't accept his password. He was in the main cafeteria now; just moments prior, a member of the hospitality staff named Wyers had reprogrammed it and then stepped into the thawing freezer. Agent McTeer knocked out the lights (and herself), Dr. Duson shut the ISSS bulkheads, Junior Technician Nascimbeni used Corbin's password to activate the sprinkler system, Dr. Wattana turned the cafeteria radiators up to full, Dr. Goh (visiting from Site-65 in Singapore) shorted out the electrics in the kitchenette and Technician Al-Ghamdi re-activated the klaxons.\n\nUnder this sustained audiovisualphysical assault, it was small wonder that Pensak obliterated the nearest wall with his gun and staggered out into the hall.\n\nDeep within the walls of the Security and Containment central offices, Technician Jessie MacCrum tore through a final bundle of wires and insulation, found the tiny terminal where Pensak had set up his memetic countermeasures, and rather than tapping out her copy of the password whacked the thing five times with a wrench.\n\nPensak was clutching at his ears, trying in vain to shut out the sirens.
