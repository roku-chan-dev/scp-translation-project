When the citizens of Silesia took to the streets to gain their independence, suddenly gifted with thaumic muscle on a scale unparalleled by modern history, only to meet armed Polish forces and Chaos Insurgency terrorists on other sides of the barricade, the world collectively held its breath. Even now, years later, the American public's consciousness remains concerned with the thaumic uprising. \"What would the government do if this happened in our home? Should we be afraid?\" the people asked, almost ten years ago. \"Could we even prevent bloodshed, if our home suffered the same fate?\"\n\nRecent studies show that the acceptance rate of thaumic individuals in major American cities has gone down from 67% in 2038 to just 23% in 2047. With political tensions on the rise due to the impending 2048 presidential election, the topic of thaumic security has been a burning question in many voters' minds. Though both sides of the political aisle recognised and engaged with the topic, during recent hearings, President Crenshaw's administration addressed the subject directly: \"The American people have no reason to be afraid. With my administration's new directives when I am, or rather, should say 'if' I am re-elected this year, we will crack down on those who abuse their thaumic abilities for evil. Have no fear. We will overcome.\"\n\n[# Continue reading...]\n\n[[/==]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email pentagram\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n[# thomasbowe@pentagram_internal.gov]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n[# haruyoshida@joicl_virology.int]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRe: Project SCARLET DAWN\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n01/17/2048\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n\nProf. Yoshida,\n\nIt is a pleasure to meet you. My name is General Thomas Bowe, and I will be the new head of SCARLET DAWN, filling in for General Johnson. I look forward to a successful partnership between our organizations -- America's long overdue for some proper security.\n\nI understand you had a rapport with General Johnson, but fear not -- though the name on the other side of the communication may have changed, most things will remain the same. I may take a different route than my predecessor in a few aspects of our endeavor, but our goal continues being the same. In particular, there are two major points I would like to emphasize remain identical as during your time under Gen. Johnson:\n\n* 1. The DEADLINE: Administration expects the project to be concluded before the election comes into full swing. Though it would be ideal if we could finish before the final presidential debate airs live, the absolute latest you are to present satisfactory results is the day of the election. We can miss our political leverage, but we absolutely cannot risk the Democrats taking credit for SCARLET DAWN, in the unlikely case that Buttigieg claims the win;\n* 2. The CONFIDENTIALITY: It is absolutely imperative that our work here remains classified until President Crenshaw can present our results to the public. I am certain you were already notified of this, but this extends to internal JOICL databases and communications as well -- until we are done, this is between your team and mine, no exceptions.\n\nWith official bussiness out of the way, I would just like to say I am truly honored to be working with a man like you. It's not often that one gets to talk with an apprentice of the famous Hisashi Kunō himself. I am sure that together, we will make America and the international scientific community proud.\n\nGod bless America,\nGeneral Thomas Bowe, United States Paranatural Warfare Command\n\n----\n\n{{🔗 One (1) file attached: Project SCARLET DAWN Casefiles: Thomas Bowe}}\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n[# haruyoshida@joicl_virology.int]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n[# thomasbowe@pentagram_internal.gov]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nRe: Project SCARLET DAWN\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n01/18/2048\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n\nGeneral Bowe,\n\nYou musn't fear: my team guarantees nothing but efficiency and confidentiality.

We have already begun our work, and are expecting preliminary results shortly; I'll update you as soon as we finalize our genetic designs. I'm attaching their blueprints so that in case you have any further comments, we may edit them in before we start the production.\n\nAll this being said, however, I do have some concerns. \n\nNamely, wouldn't the Coalition and the World Parahealth Organization be opposed to this? If this project were to spread to unauthorized third parties, we could be looking at a potential second Impasse.
