Conduits of SR #5674 found in the possession of the public are to be confiscated; if the offender is repentant, no further action will be necessary. The conduits are constituted of simple ordained matter and may be held at any reliquary or holding site within a locked box.\n\nEcumenical personnel --are allowed to own, forge, and use conduits of SR #5674 at their own free will-- are permitted to use conduits of SR #5674 for the purpose of inquisition under the guidance of the cult of Saint Hubertus.\n\n**Description:** SR #5674 is an aspect of Saint Hubertus[[footnote]]c. 656 – 30 May 727 annō Dominī. Patron Saint of hunters, mathematicians, opticians, and smelters, as well as the Prescient Harmonic Defenses of the Latin Ecumene.

An SR #5674 conduit is a sealable box forged from brass, of any dimensions, with a concave lens which allows a line of sight into its interior.\n\nThe conduit must be blessed in the name of Saint Hubertus—\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"Transcript\"]]\nHeavenly Father,\nInfinite and indivisible,\nOut of your heart emerges everything\nFrom the vastness of the expanse\nTo the smallest grain of sand.\n@@ @@\nMighty Father,\nTo see all that is unseen;\nThe motions of worlds\nAnd the trajectories of light's rays;\nIs to know the sum of your works.\n@@ @@\nBlessed Father,\nIn the name of Saint Hubertus;\nWho holds the keys to burn away madness,\nWho sees everything,\nAnd who guards the forest of Gnosis;\nMay we see what he can see.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nIf the blessing is heeded, Saint Hubertus will consume the offering[[footnote]] Accepted offerings include cardamine, sage, nettles, tarragon, mulled wine, a cup of doe's milk, a prism, or a crucifix cast in antimony by the hand of the invoker.

These images depict a possible world and its consequences wherein the individual connected to the relic was never conceived, so that we may reflect on their impact.\n\n+++++ **Addendum #5674.I— Inquisitions**\n\n||~ Date ||~ Relic ||~ Providence Granted ||~ Insight ||\n|| 01/07/1834 || I; Skin from the **Inquisitor Caius Griffiths** || An idyllic montane countryside.

The people do not dress in Christian garb and Royalist banners are present. || The Saint truly saved his Patronage from this fate. ||\n|| 24/10/1901 || I; A vial of blood from the **Damned #106520** || Geneva Catilina alive and tending to her unborn children.

The Antichrist was disrobed, defanged and declawed, his eyes gouged, and, so cast before a  congregation of his enemies, was shot and baptised in fire. The cult of Saint Hubertus sampled his residue, so that they may be granted Providence.\n\n||~  ||~ Residue||~ Providence Granted ||~ Insight ||\n|| 1^^st^^ || II; Writhing vestments of the **King of Magog** || Glass and metal towers with tops in the sky above streets with soulless people. The beaches and waterways of Mare Nostrum are dyed and polluted by refuse. Beasts of air and sea are choked by an iridescent black miasma which floats on the water. A cross inside a halo floats above the heads of the helpers of God's creatures. || Providence seems to resemble the 51^^st^^ Circle of Sheol. Residue was destroyed. ||\n||4^^th^^ || II; The hearts, the 3^^rd^^ eye, the 13^^th^^ digit, and the womb of the **King of Magog**|| An orange mushroom growing from the ruins of a city. Iram of the Pillars reemerging to forge the Earth in her false clockwork image. Half-bodied golems in the sky crushing the citadels of Palaestīna under their fists. A cabal of smiling Daemons wearing the skins of men and the robes of bishops. Sol breaking through the Firmament and melting our flesh. Wormwood, the Leviathan of New Daevastan, blazing like a torch, regurgitating beasts and turning the seas blue and turbulent. || All attempts at misdirection. Residue was destroyed. ||\n|| 8^^th^^ || I; The Crown of Tongues of the **King of Magog** || The Synod of the Tridecimate murdered by lead bullets. The bodies are placed in coffins draped under an unknown flag with three crescents. || Pathetic mockery. Residue was destroyed. ||\n|| 16^^th^^ || I; Ashes of the **King of Magog** || @@    @@**[POTENTIAL HAZARD OF MIND PURGED]** **Proverbs 27:12**–  The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. || The Daemon blasphemes. ||\nIn the following days, the city of Ierusalem rejoiced, for it was scorched free of deceivers and tyrants and the abominable Larvae of Tartarus.\n\nThree days after this Providence, to punctuate the ceremonies of Resurrection Sunday, the Synod of the Tridecimate threw the ashes of the **King of Magog** into the expanse beyond the Firmament, that he may never return. May all heathens learn humility from his grisly and deserved end.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"Verse\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: url('http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/byebyemanhubert/scp-ecumene-sigil-small-verse.png') center center no-repeat; background-size: 50%; text-align: left; margin: auto; max-width: 350px; font-size: 18px; padding: 0px;\"]]]]\n[[>]]\n**2 Corinthians 4:18**\n[[/>]]\nAs we look not to the things that are seen,\nBut to the things that are unseen.\nFor the things that are seen are transient,\nBut the things that are unseen are eternal.\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=true | last=false | hub=false| previous-url=/\n| hub-url=/ | hub-title=SR #5674\n| next-url=/scp-7511 | next-title=SCP #7511\n]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5673| SCP-5673]]] | SR #5674 | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5675|SCP-5675]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box | author=Rhys Tanner and Dr. Phil McClaw]]\n======\n> **Filename:** scp-saint-hubert.png\n> **Name:** Brass_tobacco_box,_England,_1801-1900_Wellcome_L0057701.jpg\n> **Author:** Wellcome images\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** [[[*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Brass_tobacco_box,_England,_1801-1900_Wellcome_L0057701.jpg | Wikimedia]]]\n\n> **Name:** Majestic_box_camera.jpg\n> **Author:** John Kratz\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 International\n> **Source Link:** [[[*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Majestic_box_camera.jpg | Wikimedia]]]\n======\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
