This event led to widespread dissent and rebellion amongst the civilian population in the empire, as well as the breakdown of the Veil in areas such as Manchuria and Northern China. Operation Ragnarsdrápa involved subversive guerilla warfare against the Japanese Branch of the SCP Foundation. In addition to this, the market and internet were flooded with media banned by the Japanese Government such as anime, manga, and video games.\n\nOperation Ragnarsdrápa was evaluated to be a moderate success by Valravn analysts. In the aftermath of the operation, dozens of anomalous refugees were able to escape the empire. The Japanese military and SCP-JP took numerous casualties and the efforts to repair the damage done by Ragnarsdrápa are estimated to cost 1 billion Japanese Yen. \n\nThe operation was also responsible for kickstarting a cultural revival amongst the minority communities living in the Japanese Empire by reintroducing media and art forms central to their original cultures that were forbidden by Japanese law. In terms of general unrest, Valravn intelligence has only noted a small increase in protests in the Japanese territories and most of these are mainly on economic issues. Valravn intelligence further notes that unhappiness with the Japanese regime has increased online but the chances of this spiraling into open revolt are close to zero.\n\nIn the aftermath of Operation Ragnarsdrápa, SCP-JP had originally reached out to the Valravn Corporation to supplement their forces in hunting for the so-called \"traitorous\" anomalies. However, the High Table[[footnote]] Seven-person council that controls the Valravn Corporation. [[/footnote]] declined after having a meeting with an agent of the Philippine branch of the foundation, known only as VERALTA.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ HT Virtual meeting with VERALTA \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n**HT-CIT:** So let me see if I'm understanding correctly, the Philippine Branch was responsible for this... Operation Ragnarsdrápa? I have to admit this was an unexpected turn of events.\n\n**VERALTA:** Yes, I was closely involved with the planning of said event.\n\n**HT-CEO:** More impressively, you managed to pull it off without R.U.N.N.E.S[[footnote]] The Retroactive Unified Neural Network Escathological System (RUNNES) is a powerful predictive system powered by ancient runic magic and artificial intelligence. [[/footnote]]  figuring anything out. I can only assume you took extra steps to purposely obfuscate us as well?\n\n**VERALTA:** The subterfuge was needed, we couldn't risk the Valravn Corporation finding out about Operation Ragnarsdrápa and informing SCP-7015 about it under the terms of the Cartagena Agreement. \n\n**HT-CIT:** Excuse me, SCP-7015? What is that?\n\n**VERALTA:** It's our designation for the anomaly known as the Japanese Empire and by extension the Japanese branch of the Foundation itself.\n\n**HT-CEO:** You've designated the Japanese Empire as anomalous? That's a bold move. What in Odin's name would fill you with the bravery to do such a thing?\n\n**VERALTA:** That is classified information but what you need to know is the Japanese Empire needs to fall and Ragnarsdrápa was just the beginning. I'm here to offer Valravn a very lucrative contract, an exclusive one at that with the Philippine Branch.\n\n**HT-COO:**What purpose would you have to contract with us? If this is true, that SCP-PH unleashed one of the biggest insurgencies in SEA in recent memory, why on Earth would you need to hire us?\n\n**HT-CIO:** I think I can answer that, Operations Officer. SCP-PH risks exposure with every strike they make against SCP-JP. If we strike at SCP-JP and are found out, their branch will wipe us off the map with no blowback on SCP-PH. I'm sure you'll come up with a cover about a Western PMC overstepping its boundaries in SEA, thinking the Cartagena Agreement[[footnote]] A ceasefire agreement between the Valravn Corporation, the Foundation, and the GOC, allows Valravn to operate as long as it respects the Veil and restricts the use of anomalous weapons only against anomalous objectives. [[/footnote]] doesn't apply to them.\n\n**VERALTA:** Well when you put it like that, it would be very beneficial to me. But to you as well.\n\n**HT-CEO:** Go on.\n\n**VERALTA:** As your Operations Officer already stated, the Cartagena Agreement will no longer apply to the Japanese Branch. We will do our best to obscure your activities in the Japanese Empire where you will be free to attack SCP-JP and secure any of their anomalies for your weapons research. I only ask that you uphold the veil during your operations. I even have a couple of contracts already set to go that I can hire you for.\n\n**HT-COO:** Would the rest of the Foundation allow this? You are essentially committing treason against your organization.\n\n**VERALTA:** I'm not sure what you're referring to. The SCP Foundation is committed to the containment of anomalies and that is what we are doing here. The other branches have their problems to deal with and they are all too afraid to step on JP's toes. Plus those in the West don't care all that much about what we easterners are up to, usually a sad fact but convenient when you're trying to hide.\n\n**HT-CEO:** I think this VERALTA makes a decent argument. But the price for attacking SCP-JP directly would be high. Valravn isn't a charity organization.\n\n**HT-COO:**I'll also point out that before the days of Cartagena, SCP-PH forces decimated us in the Malay skirmishes. I know we all have faith in our forces but this would be a suicide mission. If we can't stand against the SCP-PH what are we supposed to do against the might of the Japanese Empire?\n\n**VERALTA:** I thought you might have doubts concerning the strength of SCP-JP, and I can offer you ways to level the playing field. I'm sending you our document on SCP-7015-OROCHI. Simply put, they are baby dragons and SCP-JP has them wasting away in one of their sites. We'll pay you one million USD to retrieve it and you are free to field it as a part of your forces once they grow up. \n\n**HT-CTO:** This OROCHI seems like quite a powerful anomaly. The Tyr Project[[footnote]] Valravn's Research and Development on paraprosthetics and combat augmentations.  [[/footnote]] was throwing around the idea of a new mounted cavalry unit. I think it would be in our best interest to retrieve these OROCHIs.\n\n**HT-COO:** I do agree that these Orochi would give us a leg up on the Foundation's MTF. However, a direct assault on the Site where they are being held wouldn't be optimal. \n\n**VERALTA:** I agree that is why I would like to hire your Valkyries for a stealth operation. Specifically, the Vindsjamanar. I believe one of them is Filipino, yes? Pantas, I think is her code name.\n\n**HT-COO:**How exactly did you get the information? Valkyrie records are classified.\n\n**VERALTA:** SCP-PH knows more about your little cyborgs than you know. Pantas is Filipino and her squadmates are all from the various nations of the Japanese Empire. It's good for propaganda's sake, speaking of which I also have one last thing for our deal, I can have one of our agents create a new manga series about the squad that completes the mission. It'll add to their intrigue and mythical status. Valravn will receive 20% of the royalties of course.\n\n**HT-CMO:** Hmm, Manga sales have been through the roof after Operation Ragnarsdrápa. Such a deal would be very lucrative for us.\n\n**HT-CEO:** We shall put it to a vote, and expect an answer from us within the week. \n\n**VERALTA:** I thank you for your time and hope that our partnership will be fruitful for both of us.\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThe High Table voted 6-1 to sign an Accord with the Philippine branch. Once the terms of the deal were finalized, Valkyrie HQ was contacted to put send the\"Vindsjamanar\"[[footnote]] Old Norse for \"Wind Shamans\" [[/footnote]] to Osaka to retrieve the targets specified in the contract. The Valkyries were given the order that all SCP-JP Personnel were to be considered Acceptable Collateral Damage (ACD).\n\nThe target anomalies were dubbed //D. orochi// by the Biological Sciences division. Their species name was based on their original designation of SCP-7015-OROCHI. These anomalies resembled small quadrupedal lizards but with fiery orange scales around their brow ridges and chins. //D. orochi// also sported long orange whiskers from their nostrils and their bodies covered in green horny scales. They have been recorded as being able to grow as large as 152 meters in their adult state and breathe flames that register at 18,000 degrees Celsius. //D. orochi// also has the anomalous property of being able to fuse to become a multiple-headed beast, an ability that can use up to eight subjects.\n\nThe //D. orochi// specimens in SCP-JP's care are believed to be the last in existence, making this mission imperative to the Tyr Project that they be collected to be tamed for Project DRAGONRIDER.\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\n**Incident Overview:**\n\nThe Vindsjamanar were deployed into Osaka on January 20th, with the operation planned to commence on January 22nd at which Site-87 was going to be understaffed due to a local celebration. Arriving by boat, the Vindsjamanar were given an apartment provided by SCP-PH to use as an operating base. VHQ provided 100,000 Japanese Yen, a variety of disguises, and technical equipment. The Vindsjamanar were briefed by their leader V-01 on the following information to make their plan of attack.\n\n* Site-87's location was unable to be obtained by SCP-PH, they only knew that it was within Osakan city limits.\n* SCP-PH did provide the address and information of a Researcher Hiromi Kadota who worked with the //D. orochi// anomaly.\n* Under no circumstances were the Valkyries to be captured or caught by the SCP Foundation. Each of them had been equipped with suicide runes to destroy any traces of them via thaumaturgy.\n\nV-01 decided that V-02 would join her in tracking Kadota and retrieving the location of the Site. As for V-03 and V-04, V-04 suggested that the best way to attack Site-87 would be through a distraction. V-04's plan to do this would be to plant thaumaturgic bombs on one of the city's power plants. This would cut power to the Site and allow them to move under the cover of darkness. After consulting with VHQ who decided that any civilian casualties would be considered ACD, the plan was approved by V-01 and would be undertaken on the 21st after a day of performing reconnaissance for their specific assignments. \n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Audio/Visual Feeds of Vindsjamanar during pre-mission operations\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show= + Operation 494\n| hide= - Close Operation 494\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 21/1/21\n**NOTE:** The following feed was taken from Valkyrie V-01, codenamed \"Tatakai\". V-01 and V-02 had surveilled Researcher Kadota and discovered he frequented a nightclub known as //The Jasmine Dragon//. On the night of the 21st, they posed as two aloof bar patrons and entered the club. V-01 and V-02 found Kadota inside and convinced him to bring him back to his apartment, where they interrogated him.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**V-01:** So you said you're a researcher of some sort?\n\n**V-02:** Yeah, tell us all abouts your research! \n\n**Kadota:** Listen, girls, I told you. My research is highly classified. Government stuff. Why don't we stop with the questions and head back to the bedroom?\n\n**V-01:** Okay, okay. Come on Pamyeol, let's show him a good time.\n\n**V-02:** Ooh fun!\n\n[V-01 and V-02 enter Kadota's bedroom. V-02 takes a seat on his mattress while Kadota approaches V-01.]\n\n**Kadota:** You know I was going to say it was a little strange that you both are so covered up. Aren't you hot in all of that?\n\n**V-01:** Not at all. It adds more mystique to what's underneath.\n\n**Kadota:** Mmm. Very true. Let's unzip this thing and see what I got to work with.\n\n[Kadota reaches for the zipper on V-01's jacket but she grabs his hand before he can. Kadota begins to shriek as she applies pressure to his hand, a crunching sound is heard as she walks him back to the bed and pins him with her other hand.]\n\n**V-02:** Keep him still.\n\n[V-02 removes her glove revealing a red cybernetic hand. She pulls back the tips of her index and middle fingers to reveal brushes and begins painting on Kadota's right hand.]\n\n**Kadota:** Ah! Y-you broke my fingers! What the hell is wrong with you! Is that... paratech? Just who the hell are you two?\n\n**V-01:** We'll be asking the questions here, Kadota. Where is Site-87?\n\n**Kadota:** Is that URL or something? I don't know what you're talking about.\n\n[V-01 looks to the right at V-02 who has just finished the runes on his right hand. V-02 begins chanting in Old Norse and a thaumaturgic wind begins to spiral around Kadota's right hand.]\n\n**V-02:** What is that Korean witch doing to my h-hAHHHH!\n\n[Kadota begins to scream as the wind circling his hand begins to lash the flesh away from his digits.]\n\n**V-02:** I advise you to keep your mouth shut about my nationality if you'd like to keep the hand. Please answer my associate's questions or I can make the wind spread farther up.\n\n**V-01:** We need the location of Site-87. Are you going to give it to us or are you going to continue to be difficult?\"\n\n**Kadota:** Th-th-they'll kill me! Please, I can't tell you, you anything! AGH!\n\n[The entirety of Kadota's hand turns into a slurry of blood as the wind intensifies. V-02 stands up from the bed, still maintaining her chant. She passes by V-01's field of view and in the corner of her eye, she sees V-02 grab his keycard from his jacket hung up on the side of his bed.]\n\n**V-02:** Says here he has level 3 clearance. Is that enough to acquire the Orochi?\n\n**Kadota:** O-orochi! (pained huffing), what do you want with them? Those abominations don't have long on this Earth, oh oh god! STOP!\n\n[The wind begins to move farther up his right arm as the bones in his hand become visible through the storm.]\n\n**V-01:** My apologies, my associate is very passionate about her dragons. I'm going to assume based on the fact you know about them, your clearance is enough. Now, the location. I'm only asking you once and then that storm spreads to the rest of your body.\n\n**Kadota:** UNDERGROUND! The Site is underground! There's a meat shop on 24th and 26th, in the back there's an elevator....\n\n[The storm around his hands ceases. Kadota drags his mangled arm to his face to survey the damage.]\n\n**V-01:** Thank you for being honest with us. That is all we needed to know.\n\n**Kadota:** M-my arm.... my arm!\n\n[V-01 extends her arm blade.]\n\n**V-01:** Again, my apologies. You have been determined to be ACD. What is about to happen to you isn't personal.\n\n-----\n\n**NOTE:** After terminating Researcher Kadota, V-01 and V-02 scrubbed his apartment of any involvement and disposed of his body in the harbor.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show= + Operation 876\n| hide= - Close Operation 876\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 21/1/21\n**NOTE:** The following feed was taken from Valkyrie V-03, codenamed \"Shènglì.\" V-03 and V-04 had successfully infiltrated the power plant disguised as maintenance workers.

One wrong line and you'll blow an extra two blocks away.\n\n**V-03:** S-sorry, you know runes aren't my strong suit. \n\n[V-03 wipes the paint away and continues.]\n\n**V-04:** To answer your question about the SCP situation, I'm not afraid. I wasn't in the organization yet when the whole Malaysia thing went down but I do feel for our sisters that were killed that day. I'm sure they're fighting and drinking to their heart's content in Valhalla. What about you, are you ready for tomorrow?\n\n**V-03:** I was born ready for this. I've been itching for some payback against SCP-JP. Do you know what they did to us Thaumaturges in Beijing? I'm lucky my family wasn't strung up with the rest of them.\n\n[V-04 stands up.]\n\n**V-04:** Good and with Loki's blessing; we can pull a few tricks on your family's oppressors with the last of these runes. We'll descend on those bastards like Odin's lightning and afterward, the Skalds[[footnote]] Old Norse for \"poet\" [[/footnote]] of SCP-PH will write tales of our pursuits.\n\n**V-03:** I'll drink to that, sister.

Within their operating base, the four Vindsjamanar performed a spell that detonated the runes placed inside the power plant. The resulting explosion, not only knocked out power around Site-87 in a five-block radius but diverted emergency personnel away from the operation's main location. In the darkness, the Vindsjamanar moved across the streets in civilian clothing and infiltrated the Butcher shop being used as a Foundation front. Inside, the four Valkyries eliminated four plain clothes Foundation agents and began to prepare to enter Site-78. They donned their helmets and armor and V-04 performed a thaumaturgic ritual that would render them invisible for twenty minutes.\n\nV-04 would stay back and provide technical support. After hacking into their systems, V-04 was able to shut down their camera and get the layout of the facility but was unable to locate the specific holding cell of the D. orochi.\n\nAfter readying their kit, the Vindsjamanar descended into the bowels of the Foundation Site, using the keycard they'd retrieved earlier to enter the Site. When they exited the elevator the backup generators had kicked in and the facility was on a level 1 alert. Still cloaked in V-04's thaumaturgy, they were able to sneak by the throngs of bustling researchers and guards. Directed by V-04 the squad made it into the holding cells where they began the search for the //D. orochi// specimens. \n\nTraveling through the winding hallways and floors of the facility had taken their valuable twenty minutes leaving the Valkyries in the open when they entered the //D. Orochi//'s holding cell. Unbeknownst to them, MTF Kappa-46 (Susanoo's Blades), were standing guard inside. The Vindsjamanar had no choice but to engage with the MTF in combat. Not much is known about Kappa-46 other than from the following footage that their units were equipped with never-before cataloged anomalous weaponry and thaumaturgic enhancements.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Audio/Visual Feed of V-01 during Site-87 infiltration\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 22/1/21\n**NOTE:** The following is an excerpt of the skirmish that occurred between MTF Kappa-46 and Valkyrie squad Vindsjamanar as well as the exfiltration from Site-87. The following data was recorded to be studied by the Tyr project to develop countermeasures against SCP-JP forces.\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n[Sounds of heavy fighting are heard. Kappa-03 is straddling V-01's waist and trying to stab them with a knife made of an unknown metal. V-01 appears to be struggling to keep it at bay by pushing the MTF's wrist back with her free hand. A cursory glance to the right reveals that V-01's right hand has been pinned to the ground by a knife.]\n\n**Kappa-03:** As a fellow citizen of the Japanese Empire, I order you to stand down!\n\n**V-01:** I no longer serve the Emperor. His decrees mean nothing to me.\n\n**Kappa-03:** How could you forsake your people, to associate yourself with this anomalous rabble?\n\n\n[A clink of metal can be heard as V-01 frees her hand and rams her arm blade into Kappa-03's chest.]\n\n**V-01:** Those rabble are my sisters!\n\n[Kappa-03 coughs up blood and drops the knife. V-01 quickly knocks the MTF off of her and appears to check how much control she still has of the servo motors in her hand. Immediately she swung around to get a bearing of her surroundings, the corpses of Foundation researchers assigned to //D. orochi// lie on the ground. Three members of MTF Kappa-46 are dead and mangled in various states around her. V-02 and V-03 are engaged in melee combat with two of the remaining MTF. \n\n**Kappa-01:** Tenno Heika Banzai!\n\n[V-01 turns as she sees Kappa-01 charging at her with a Japanese Flag covered in a thaumaturgic aura. V-01 looks down at her arms, touching her fingers on three specific runes on her arm before raising her left forearm and running her right arm blade across it. The resulting motion creates a large spark that appears to blind Kappa-01. V-01 strikes forward with her arm blade but Kappa-01 manages to block it with their flagstaff. The aura seems to react with the strike and V-01 is propelled on to their back. Kappa-01 tries to slam their flagstaff down onto V-01's chest but is impaled through the back by a sword.]\n\n[The man's flagstaff clatters to the floor with his body as the sword is withdrawn. V-02 is standing there with her left arm missing. It has been severed at the elbow joint, her self-repair systems appear to have activated and sealed the limb.]\n\n**V-02:** Looks like the forces of Amaterasu were no match for Odin's daughters. \n\n[V-02 extends a hand to V-01 who takes it and stands up. She looks to her right as V-03 casts a thaumaturgic spell that cleaves her opponent in half. V-03 spits on her opponent's body and limps towards the group. V-03 is sporting numerous punctures to her armor and her self-repair systems are currently working to seal the wounds she received.]\n\n[V-03 raised her fist into the air]\n\n**V-03:** Óðinn á yðr alla! We sure...ugh showed those Japanese bastards... no offense Tatakai.\n\n**V-01:** None taken. An enemy is an enemy. No matter where we are. How is everyone holding up? I got thrown around pretty badly.\n\n**V-03:** Damn MTF nicked the power supply to my augments. My diagnostics are telling me that if I draw too much power to any one of them, I might blow the unit. I'm probably good to fight but if any of their MTF are like those guys, I don't know if I'll make it.\n\n**V-02:** As for me, my arm will need to be re-attached at VHQ. I'm still good with my one hand but I lost a good chunk of my combat runes.\n\n**V-01:** Noted, let's secure the anomalies and see if Pantas has an alternate exit for us.\n\n[V-01 approaches the enclosure in the center of the room where eight //D. orochi// specimens are lounging around in states of lethargy. She reaches into her pouch and procures a treat for one of them. One specimen approaches and consumes the treat before rubbing its head against her hand.]\n\n**V-01:** There, there little guy. You're gonna be alright.\n\n[V-01 pulls the container off her back and places it in the enclosure. She drops some food into the container from a hatch on the top. The starving D. orochi are quick to enter the container which she snaps shut and secures out of frame.\n\n**V-01:** Pantas, do you read me?\n\n**V-04:** My connection is a little borked but I can hear you. Are the D. orochi specimens secured?\n\n**V-01:** Yes, but we had to engage with their MTF to capture them. A lot of us are banged up pretty bad and your spell has worn off.\n\n**V-04:** I take it that going back the way you came isn't an option? \n\n**V-01:** Place is swarming with guards, we won't make it in@ another straight-up confrontation.\n\n**V-04:** Noted. I'll try and pull up the Site's map. Maybe there's an alternate entrance. Which holding cell are you in?\n\n**V-01:** Number 78. \n\n**V-04:** Alright.... excellent. There's an elevator not too far from you. It's down the hall, on the left.  Not sure where you'll end up but it's better than nothing.\n\n**V-01:** Copy, that. Vindsjamanar let's move out.\n\n[V-01 begins moving out of the holding cell with her Valkyries behind her. She hugs the wall the entire time, peeking over the bend she sees two guards in front of the elevator. She gestures to her squad to stop moving and looks down at her arm. She presses a series of runes on her forearm which begin to glow. A swirling thaumaturgic wind appears over her hand. Her cybernetic eyes lock on to the emergency lights onto the ceiling and targeting systems inform her of the optimal trajectory.]\n\n[V-01 then tosses the wind into the lights, dropping the hallway into darkness. V-01 and V-03 begin pressing forward. V-01's vision has switched to low-light, seeing the guards looking around in confusion and heading their way. Each of them facing a guard, V-01 eliminates hers with her arm blade as V-03 appears to do the same. V-01 catches the man's body before it can drop and sets it down quietly. A gurgle of pain can be heard as V-01 makes it over to the elevator, sliding the key card into the reader to open the doors.]\n\n[V-02 and V-03 move into the elevator as well and V-01 presses the surface level button. After a few moments, the doors open and the squad fans out around V-01.]\n\n**V-02:** I think we're in the clear. \n\n**V-03:** I don't see anyone either but we shouldn't stick around.\n \n**V-01:** Agreed. \n\n[V-01 opens an audio channel to V-04.]\n\n**V-01:** We're out of the Site in one piece. The plan is to meet back at the apartment. Are you clear of the meat shop?\n\n**V-04:** I've got your clothes and I'm vacating the space now. I'll see you back at our base.

Once a Valravn patrol ship had retrieved them, they were sent back to VHQ to receive medical treatment. As for the //D. orochi// specimens were sent to be fostered at a Tyr Project facility.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\n**Aftermath:** The Philippine branch of the Foundation informed us that SCP-JP believed that foreign insurgents were behind the attack on the power plant and Site-87. Power was eventually restored to the area but there was significant damage to the infrastructure and five workers lost their lives. The Valravn Corporation was not suspected of the incident at any point, maintaining our appearance as having held our part of the Cartagena Agreement.\n\nVERALTA held up his end of the deal. Under the nose of the Japanese government, 80,000 copies of \"Valkyrie: The Flight of the Shamans\" were sold at stands before being shut down by Imperial censors.  She informs us that more volumes are planned as the first one was well received. The texts also served their purpose of acting as Valravn propaganda tools. Rumors began to spread in SEA that they were based on a true story. According to Marketing, potential clients have begun to show interest in hiring us for additional strikes against the Japanese Empire.\n\nOverall, the mission was a success, and our employers were more than pleased with the results. Three Valkyries were wounded in action but would return to active service in a week. Half of one SCP-JP MTF had been liquidated along with at least four researchers and five security personnel. The Tyr Project has been sent the combat data collected and new countermeasures for SCP-JP combat assets are being developed with the information provided by the Philippine Branch.  We hope that this data bears fruit so our forces will be more effective in the field. As it stands now, Valkyrie HQ stands ready to assist Valravn in any infiltration operations in the region at a moment's notice.\n \nÓðinn á yðr alla\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 15px]]\nV-01 \"Tatakai\"\n**Squad Leader of the Vindsjamanar**\n[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Post Osaka Operation HT- Virtual Meeting Transcript \" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n\n**HT-CEO:** Chief Technology Officer, how fares Project DRAGONRIDER?\n\n**HT-CTO:** The specimens are faring better under our care and have returned to full strength. It will take some time for them to grow to full size but once we do we can begin training our units to ride them.\n\n**HT-CEO:** Excellent. Chief Marketing Officer, how are things faring with the media produced by SCP-PH?\n\n**HT-CMO:** We are bringing in 200,000 USD extra monthly profit from Manga sales. The total number of contracts we have received has increased by 33% compared to last quarter.\n\n**HT-CFO:** I would like to add to the CMO's comments that the deal struck with the Philippine Branch has us projecting a 50% increase in total revenue. We are taking a bit of a deficit in funding countermeasures to deal with the forces of SCP-JP but we believe it to be an acceptable cost.\n\n**HT-CEO:** That is what I like to hear. Chief Information Officer, how is our standing in the Japanese Empire? Do they suspect us at all?\n\n**HT-CIO:** As far as we are aware no. No elements of SCP-JP have been seen surveilling our assets in the region. Our units combined with assistance from sympathetic groups make us seem like every other group of malcontents growing within the area. We aren't the only ones fielding thaumaturges augmented with paraprosthetics.\n\n**HT-COO:** I would advise caution in trusting the Philippine branch entirely. They haven't specified what exactly the ulterior motive of the contracts they assigned to us is. May I remind everyone that Operation Ragnarsdrápa led to the deaths of half the anomalies involved?\n\n**HT-CEO:** Your concern is duly noted. Valravn is not to be shackled by any anomalous organization and the recent mission for the Orochi has shown that we still have a ways to go in matching the strength of the strongest anomalous branch on the planet.  Do all members of the Table agree that our accord with SCP-PH is to stand?\n\n[All members pass their votes.  6-1 to remain in the accord.]\n\n**HT-CEO:** As it stands, the accord with the Philippine Branch will remain for now. We will continue feasting on the corpse of Japan's bloated empire and grow stronger from it. This meeting is adjourned.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]",
