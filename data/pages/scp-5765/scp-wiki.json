I apologize, uh, this is a little awkward. I've been researching bees for twelve years, and haven't done anything like this. It's like I'm conducting an autopsy. Not used to having people watching.\n\n**Edmunson:** I understand. Our research facility is admittedly a bit unorthodox. Just say what you're thinking, and give us an idea of what we're dealing with. It'll feel more natural as you go.\n\n**Ewing:** Okay, it's your show. Let's see them.\n\n//(Ewing secures her beekeeping helmet and enters SCP-5765.

There's nothing in here.\n\n//(Dr. Ewing begins to pace the outer perimeter of the containment chamber.)//\n\n**Ewing:** What's the temperature of this room?\n\n**Edmunson:** Uh, let me check. One moment.\n\n**Ewing:** It feels a bit chilly.\n\n**Edmunson** About 13 degrees Celsius.\n\n**Ewing:** So yeah, that's a bit cold for bees. You could be dealing with some sort of cold-resistant species or subspecies, like we find with Carniolans or Russian honey bees, but either way, they're likely bundled up in the hive somewhere trying to keep warm. Can you adjust the temperature?\n\n**Edmunson:** Sure, bringing it up now. 18 or 19 good for you?\n\n**Ewing:** Sure. Continuing. The room is barren of natural resources, or indeed any resources at all. If we turn this place into a garden, we might draw them out and get a better look. Most bees aren't very specific about the plants they'll mine for pollen, but a few are. In addition to lavender, holly, uh, clover and maybe echinacea, you'll want to also have dogwood and mustard for the pickier eaters. Makes sense they'd be hard to find if there's nothing here for them to eat.\n\n**Edmunson:** Understood, we'll make it happen. Ayim? Write that down?\n\n**Ewing:** I'm not seeing any physical signs of bees. No damage from carpenters, no scouts. You mentioned nobody's been stung, so your bees either aren't aggressive or they simply don't feel threatened. Or, as I mentioned, they could be lethargic from the cold. We'll want to try pheromones for a couple of different species, at least.\n\n**Edmunson:** I'm actually a step ahead of you on that. I have someone ready to test that soon. Please, continue, your input is invaluable.\n\n//(Transcript abridged, available in full as 57655-UA. Dr. Ewing makes numerous suggestions over nine hours for exposing bee populations.

When individuals are told the contents of SCP-5765, they will invariably believe this information to be true. Notably, proximity to SCP-5765 seems to have no bearing on the anomalous effect; individuals who are aware of SCP-5765's physical existence are vulnerable to suggestion regarding its contents. While cognitoaffective, this effect lacks compulsive behavior or directly destructive psychological effects, and thus is not considered significantly cognitohazardous.\n\nThe nature of SCP-5765 makes it difficult to directly study its effects (//see Iteration 0, logged below//). Research performed on SCP-5765 is to be conducted by individuals unaware of its cognitoaffective anomaly, and is to be directed by the Head Researcher, Dr. Johannes Ashby.\n\nSCP-5765 was previously used to contain SCP-████, which is currently undergoing reevaluation and classification. Due to the similarities in their effects, it is currently theorized that SCP-████ experienced \"anomalous bleeding\" into SCP-5765, resulting in its current anomalous state. Research is ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"material-box \"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n++++++ **Addendum 5765.3: Summaries of Previous Test Iterations**\n[[/div]]\n\nPlease contact the Head Researcher for full records of previous test iterations.\n\nData is to be collected regarding how researchers proceed in testing and compiling information about SCP-5765. Approved research methodology prescribes informing researcher subjects that SCP-5765 contains some object of study and providing reasonable accommodations for locating those contents.  \n\nUnreasonable accommodations may be approved on a case-by-case basis.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 0**\n> **Subject:** None\n> **Suggested contents:** None\n> **Results:** Shortly after SCP-████ was transferred to ████████ for reevaluation, the Head Researcher noticed members of the transportation team returning numerous times to the containment chamber and searching inside. When questioned, each member reported that they had returned to see if there was anything left to move, despite SCP-████ being a single solid piece which was transported without incident. \n> \n> After several weeks of continued visits to the empty containment chamber by research and logistics personnel, the former Head Researcher requested the chamber be tentatively classified as SCP-████-A and evaluated for anomalous properties.\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 1**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Machado\n> **Suggested contents:** One banana.\n> **Results:** Dr. Machado conducted several physical examinations of SCP-5765 looking for the banana before redirecting his research into the potential merelogical explanations for the undetected molecules that may have once made up the banana.\n> **Notes:** //It's a shame Dr. Machado has absolutely no background whatsoever in metaphysics, or his research paper would have been significantly more readable.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 2**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Monaghan\n> **Suggested contents:** One Maersk Triple E-class container ship.\n> **Results:** Dr. Monaghan immediately deduced that SCP-5765 was too small to contain the suggested contents and expressed distress over the psychological dissonance that resulted. He presented a 532-page report dismissing the possibility that the suggested contents could fit inside of SCP-5765, which he followed up with a 254-page thesis proposing alternative mathematical schemas for calculating physical dimensions.\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 3**\n> **Subject:** Dr. O'Kane\n> **Suggested contents:** A standard mixture of breathable air.\n> **Results:** Dr. O'Kane appeared confused and suspicious of her research direction and conducted several remote tests on the air quality within SCP-5765 before utilizing D-72771 to confirm. Her conclusion was that SCP-5765 contains breathable air and expressed annoyance toward the Head Researcher.\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 4**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Horsfall\n> **Suggested contents:** Enlightenment.\n> **Results:** Dr. Horsfall's research methodology was erratic, ranging from taking numerous measurements of the room and its qualities, philosophical and religious interpretations of the room, meditation exercises within SCP-5765, and literary analysis of poetry and free-association written while inside. Dr. Horsfall required Class C amnestic treatment to successfully disengage her interest in locating suggested contents.\n> **Notes:** //We can consider this confirmation that SCP-5765's effects are almost certainly related to its previous exposure to SCP-████.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 5**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Salinas\n> **Suggested contents:** A sense of safety.\n> **Results:** Dr. Salinas conducted numerous studies and, unable to definitively locate a sense of safety in the room, showed signs of paranoia and phobia regarding the contents of SCP-5765.\n> **Notes:** //Our researcher is now terrified of his research subject and little data could be acquired. This is unhelpful.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 6**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Trask\n> **Suggested contents:** A sense of safety.\n> **Results:** Dr. Trask conducted few remote examinations of SCP-5765 before entering it personally. She quickly responded that the room did indeed carry an \"intense\" feeling of safety. Dr. Trask then showed signs of paranoia and phobia regarding the world outside of SCP-5765 and refused to leave for 38 hours, when dehydration allowed her to be extracted by the Head Researcher.\n> **Notes:** //While it is useful to know that different subjects seem to produce different results when tested under largely identical circumstances, I'm convinced that SCP-5765 is likely one of those problems that is only a problem because we're messing with it.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 7**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Madison\n> **Suggested contents:** A barely-audible mechanical whining sound.\n> **Results:** Dr. Madison personally confirmed the presence of the sound within SCP-5765, but was unable to measure it using standard audiometric equipment. Initial conclusion that SCP-5765 causes selective vibrations within living matter that makes the sound impossible to detect outside of the human body.\n> **Notes:** //This is an interesting conclusion, even though it's wrong. Perhaps SCP-5765 could be a viable means of incentivizing \"out of the box\" thinking in other research avenues. Recommending future studies in this direction.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[==]]\n> **Iteration: 8**\n> **Subject:** Dr. Edmunson\n> **Suggested contents:** Bees.\n> **Results:** Dr. Edmunson has conducted numerous tests attempting to confirm the presence of bees in SCP-5765. This research has progressed at an increasing pace, and is currently in its second consecutive year of testing, with Dr. Edmunson showing no signs of dissonant distress.\n> **Notes:** //While I recognize that Edmunson was likely transferred to me due to [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4372 that whole fiasco with his previous project], he's provided a remarkable wealth of information regarding the limits of SCP-5765's cognitoaffective capabilities. It appears that suggesting the presence of small, threatening biological organisms is enough to keep him committed to finding them, but also comfortable with not finding direct evidence for them. Let's keep him working on this and see where it goes.//\n[[/==]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5764]]] | SCP-5765 | [[[SCP-5766]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]][[/div]][[/div]][[/div]]",
