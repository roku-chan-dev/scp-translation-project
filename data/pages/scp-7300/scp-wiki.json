In events of extreme weather, an object locker with a grow light has been prepared. \n\nSCP-7300 currently meets with Dr. Joanna Goodman weekly, both for mental health screenings and physical inspection.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7300 is a freshwater phytoplankton[[footnote]]//Pleurosigma, Heleoplankton//[[/footnote]]. While SCP-7300 is able to photosynthesize energy, it can also ingest organic matter. \n\nSCP-7300 is also capable of speech[[footnote]]Fluent in both English and Swedish[[/footnote]] at average human decibel levels and has substantial knowledge of human society.\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Discovery\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid black;\"]]\n[[/div]]\nSCP-7300 was discovered by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wilson-s-wildlife-solutions-hub Wilson's Wildlife Solutions] during a routine blue-green algae test in the Staats Lake of Eugene, Oregon, where it was reportedly \"sobbing\" and \"begging for forgiveness.\" \n\nIn accordance with the Boring Agreement, SCP-7300 was promptly transferred to Site-438. Following a brief observation period, an interview was conducted by Dr. Wexler.\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\n[[=]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n[[/=]]\n\n**SCP-7300:** Hey-- ah fuck, man-- god. Uh. Thanks for moving me to a room with windows. I mean, artificial light is nice and all, but nothin' quite replaces the real thing. But maybe shitty light is just my destiny, 'cause I'm a shitty--\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** SCP-7300. Please, stay on track. I've brought you here to answer some questions, and hopefully we can figure out what happened to you, okay?\n\n**SCP-7300:** That's the thing-- I think I was //always// like this. A shitty fuckin' mite-- \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** I'm going to have to ask that you remain calm. I sympathize with your situation, I really do. I got turned into a mosquito once, and lemme tell you, it wasn't very fun. But I got turned back. We can help you. \n\n**SCP-7300:** I-- okay. Fuck. \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Thank you. To start off... what all do you remember?\n\n**SCP-7300:** Um... a lot. My memories are kind of hazy. I remember being born, and feeling like something //very// wrong was happening. Couldn't quite place it at first-- just felt like-- like a square peg in a round hole, y'know? Then I realized I was actually a guy peg in an algae hole. \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Plankton hole, actually.\n\n**SCP-7300:** A-- I'm a fucking //plankton//? Like-- like Spongebob?\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** I mean, uh... I guess you're part of the species that inspired the character? \n\n**SCP-7300:** Man. I should build a robot. Robot wife... Fuck yeah...\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Sure. So, uh, you mentioned Spongebob, do you have any other memories of human society? \n\n**SCP-7300:** Yeah! Tons of 'em. I watched //so// much cable TV. And I know how to do taxes, like, really well. I'm thinking I was an accountant. I had a wife. And kids. And a kidney stone. And an ex-wife. Turns out divorce papers are harder to fill out than Form W-9s. Way, //way// harder. I don't remember their names. We lived by a river. Had to move in with my parents later. Then I must've died. That's, uh... that's about it.\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** That's... that's a lot. But you're saying that you were //once// a human, correct?\n\n**SCP-7300:** I was. I think. I don't know what god I pissed off for //this// to happen. But I've been thinking, and it's really not that bad-- it's-- I don't have to eat-- I mean, I can-- but. \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** But? \n\n**SCP-7300:** I just wanna know if this is like, a curse, or some kind of cosmic-level fuck up, or like... god. I don't know. I'm sorry. Shit.\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** It's okay. You've given me a lot of information to go off of. We can give you a happy life here, for now. There's a nice pond near here. Maybe I can see if we can put you there? \n\n**SCP-7300:** I... I guess? Ponds are nice. Do you have frogs there? Ducks? \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Yeah! A duck recently laid eggs, we're expecting little chicks to pop up any day now. \n\n**SCP-7300:** Oh my god. Really?\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Really. \n\n**SCP-7300:** That's uh... That's... I don't really know what to say. But, uh, I just... I've got one more worry. \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** What is it? If the pond isn't to your liking, we can try and--\n\n**SCP-7300:** No-- no, the pond sounds great. Wonderful, even. It's just... if this //was// some kind of cosmic fuckup, where like, my guy peg got put into an algae hole... then what happened to the algae peg that got put into a guy hole?\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** That's... we don't even know if that's what happened.\n\n**SCP-7300:** No, no, I've got a feeling that //is// what's happened. I'm a victim here! My body is very much my concern! Because it's //mine//! \n\n**Dr. Wexler:** You're drawing unfounded conclusions and--\n\n**SCP-7300:** There's some fucked up baby out there that's eating //light// and has like, zero brain function! Plankton don't //think//! I tried talking to them, to my brothers and sisters. They really don't! They get eaten up easily, they don't even think to just //swim away//! Maybe I should just embrace my position in the food chain and--\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Calm down. Please, just take a deep--  uh, just-- a deep... photosynthesis? Do you want to go see the pond? \n\n**SCP-7300:** //Do I?!?// Yeah. Fuck yeah. I fucking love ponds.\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** Great. Ah-- just out the window, you can actually see it from here! \n\n**SCP-7300:** Oh //fuck//. That's a good pond. Shit, dude.\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** It really is, huh?\n\n**SCP-7300:** Fuck yeah! Hell yeah! Oh man. Y'know what? I take it back--\n\n**Dr. Wexler:** The pond, or--\n\n**SCP-7300:** I love being a plankton!\n\n[[=]]\n**<End Log>**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs of May 1st, 2022, SCP-7300's morale ratings are at an all-time high. As such, investigations into the origins of SCP-7300 have been placed on low priority indefinitely. SCP-7300's psychologist, Dr. Goodman, expressed support for this action, stating the following:\n\n[[div class=\"quote-block\"]]\nIn this case, doing anything more is unnecessary, and perhaps even harmful. SCP-7300's mental state practically crashes every single interview. Right now, it's finally doing better than ever before. \n \nThe best we can do is give it a happy life, and we're doing just that currently. If you've spoken with SCP-7300, you can tell how it feels.\n \nIt just really loves being a plankton. That's it. \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7299]]] | SCP-7300 | [[[SCP-7301]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Ellie3]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** plankton.jpg\n> **Name:** Mikrofoto.de-Pleurosigma angulatum-11.jpg\n> **Author:** [http://www.mikro-foto.de/ Frank Fox]\n> **License:**  [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/de/deed.en CC BY-SA 3.0 DE]\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Mikrofoto.de-Pleurosigma_angulatum-11.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
