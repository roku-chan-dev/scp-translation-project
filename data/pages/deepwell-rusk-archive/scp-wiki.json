Some claim that our \"SCPs\" are not anomalous, but in fact normal to the natural world, and that we simply \"Do not understand it.\" It's a shame they think that way, but I hope one day, we can rescue those who have fallen into the darkness, and bring them back into the light. \n\nThey aren't completely wrong however, this state of \"normalcy\" is a facade that we have created, but not from a lack of understanding. Quite the opposite actually. We simply know too much. You see, with all our power, and scientific research, we've learned a lot about the state of our world, and how easy it can break. \n\nAllowing even the most benign anomaly into the public sphere is like breaking an open valve. You see, the dangers caused by the normalization of anomalies, increase exponentially. It starts off slow with small benefits being made, but quickly, it snowballs out of control, with reality tearing slowly, but absolutely. And it continues like that until there is nothing left by an empty point in space with hume levels of absolute zero, and not a fragment of our world is left.\n\n@@ @@\n\nI should know. \n\n@@ @@\n\nAt any rate, the matter is; the rate at which anomalous activity is expanding with every coming year. If life on Earth is going to remain, stricter regulatory measures must be set in place, and I will not tolerate any exceptions. \n\n- Eideon Rusak [Site-17]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n+++ The world is cruel, it doesn't have to be ugly.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Database Procedures]]\nThe following containement procedures for the anomalies below have been cleared by Eideon Rusak at some point in the past. \n--------\n\n**[[[[SCP-6395]]]] - //Thoughts are Overrated//**\n\n\n@@  @@ //As the mayor of the humble town, I want to thank you pleasantly for letting us continue to live here.//\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Commentary\" hide=\" ▼ Close File\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6395\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\nThis was both my first article and SCP on the site and it took me a couple of weeks for me to complete. I tried to create a hivemind creature that controlled hundreds of bodies. I mainly focused on the mental capabilities of the anomaly, and how far a consciousness can go in its multitasking abilities, which are greatly explored in the latter part of the article. The beginning description is quite slow, and I'm probably going to rewrite it one of these days.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[[SCP-6487]]]] - //Pigs Can't Fly//**\n@@   @@ //If a member of personnel not a part of the primary research team would like to assist in an SCP-6487 exercise, they must schedule an appointment no less than five hours in advance.//\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Commentary\" hide=\" ▼ Close File\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6487\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\nI wrote this SCP because I wanted to explore a successful Foundation project with an anomaly. I wanted to explore how the Foundation helped improve the lives of something in confinement and how they just don't throw things in a box and are done with it. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[[SCP-6817]]]] - //\"Esther\"//**\n@@  @@ //SCP-6817 is a female humanoid that has the inability to hear human voices in any capacity.//\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Commentary\" hide=\" ▼ Close File\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6817\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\nThis SCP was inspired by a fear sense of fear I had while driving one day. At some point, my playlist ended and it played a random song. This song was an instrumental cover of a song I liked. For some reason, I thought I had lost my hearing. I quickly realized how stupid that was because I could hear the music. Thus, this SCP was born. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**[[[[SCP-6397]]]] - //A Good Girl//**\n@@   @@ //Mobile Task Force Kappa-9, otherwise known as \"Bad Boys,\" is an MTF comprised in its entirety of canines.//\n[[collapsible show=\" ► Commentary\" hide=\" ▼ Close File\"]]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6397\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\nThis was the first SCP featuring the infamous MTF Kappa-9 \"Bad Boys,\" the MTF comprised entirely of dogs.
