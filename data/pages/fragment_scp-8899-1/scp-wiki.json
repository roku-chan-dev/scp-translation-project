And in time, it became rich with wild lives and powerful beings. Forms of strength, speed, dexterity, longevity and more. As the aeons passed, some of the lives died off and were replaced while some changed and grew further in form. But for most of this period, they remained wild and senseless. Until, from out of the mud, grass and sand, rose beings. Three beings not yet seen in the world before.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/homo-sapiens-sidhe|Those Who Flew In Starlight]]].\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/children-of-the-night|Those Who Sang In Moonlight]]].\n\nThose Who Built In Daylight.\n\nQuite dissimilar to each other, though sharing a mind and soul, these three beings set out into the world, to find their place in its wild tapestry.\n\nThose Who Sing, The //Basajaun//, were the strongest of the three. Titanic in size, the Basajaun possessed coats of fine hair and eyes that could see even in the darkest of nights. They were not blessed with the power of speech and language like their sibling beings, but instead, could communicate through sheer thought alone. In the nights, as they walked and sang as one, the very forest and flowers would bend with their rhythm, as if drawn to their melody.\n\nThose Who Flew, The //Ellyllon//, were the swiftest of the three. Born with six wings of crystalline structure, they would fly among the clouds and mountains, nearly touching the heavens themselves. They were also gifted with a sense not seen in the world's lives before. As they flew, they could feel the secret rules and rituals that the Behemoths had left in the world before their destruction. In time, they would learn to harness these rules to further themselves.\n\nThose Who Built, The //Menn//, were the simplest of the three. Devoid of strength and swiftness, they were not as gifted as the Ellyllon and Basajaun. However, this weakness helped them develop skills, as they soon began to use the materials around them to build and craft artefacts to aid them. And nature had not left them completely without ability. For at night, when they slept, huddled from the cold and dark, their mind would fashion new images and ideas, encouraging their craftsmanship and resourcefulness.\n\nAnd so the world was ruled by three beings. The Basajaun, of great strength and fruitful song; The Ellyllon, of swift flight and insightful touch; and The Menn, of delicate craft and rich dream.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"fancyborder\"]]\n+  //The War Instigators//\n\nAs the world turned, the three beings travelled the lands and oceans, each fueling their wonder and longing. The Ellyllon, unburdened by a need to remain grounded, gathered together and flew North, towards the lands of winds and snow. Soon, they felt a pull in the land. A familiar whisper left by dead, godly beasts. Descending, they found buried in the ice and stone, the corpse of a dead Behemoth, believed to have succumbed to the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/history-of-behemoths|starvation]]] caused by the Serpent. Though dead, its flesh was still rich in Sruth, the pollen of the Tree, which fueled the secret rules of the world. Seeing what the body and aura of a Behemoth could do, the Ellyllon settled in the area, entombing the body and creating their first home.\n\nAs the Ellyllon bred and spread, the aura of the Behemoth enhanced their bodies and thoughts, granting them longevity and opening their eyes to the hidden rules. Soon, they applied these rules to memory and began to use them in their own ways. They started storms and rainfall, reshaped lands and mountains, stole names and inheritance and twisted the animals around them into abhorrent shapes. This power grew and grew and soon encouraged a sickness in the Ellyllon. An obsession with control, rules and experimentation. And soon, the sickness caught the attention of The Serpent.\n\nThe Serpent was familiar with the sickness. The Behemoths had shared it and so once, when young, they had too. But they had learnt better and changed themselves into a guardian of knowledge. Not wanting history to repeat itself, The Serpent left their home in the depths of the Tree and appeared before the Ellyllon. It showed them the Ways of the world and introduced them to the records lining the branches of the Tree. In their heart, The Serpent hoped its actions would bring the Ellyllon into a new age. Their hope was false.\n\nNow empowered and lettered further, the Ellyllon spread across the world, creating magnificent settlements in which to study, experiment and play. With access to the Tree, they pushed the secret rules further, designing spells and rituals that granted them capabilities no creature could've hoped to gain through natural evolution. Eventually, in a battle that lasted a decade, the Ellyllon were united under one ruler. An immortal queen named //Aibell//, ruled her people through desire and wit.\n\nBut the Ellyllon were not alone in their evolution. Back in the lands of mud and grass, the Basajaun and the Menn had shown signs of growth too. The Basajaun's control in flowering and breeding had developed significantly, now able to fill entire lands with fruitful gardens through [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-407|song]]]. The Menn's skills had also matured, now able to shape wood, wool, stone and clay into tools, vehicles, weapons and buildings. Although this growth was impressive, it was not what caused the Ellyllon to worry. The two species had not only progressed but had forged alliances, teaching each other their skills and knowledge and communicating during the dawn and dusk.\n\nFearing the threat the two species could pose to them, the Ellyllon looked to their queen for an answer. The queen, skilled in the art of deception and politics, used her skills to incept a doubt in each species. Once placed, she encouraged the doubt into distrust, which finally formed into a hostile paranoia. Before long, the two species who had once been peaceful allies, were at war with one another. The war stagnated their growth, poisoned their minds and allowed the Ellyllon to continue unthreatened.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"fancyborder\"]]\n+  //A Sin, Most Foul//\n\nAs the centuries passed, the war continued. Each side taking more and more ruthless actions. All while the Ellyllon continued with their games and secrets, even going as far as to create [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-860|small]]] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1660|worlds]]] in pockets for their goals. They even went as far as to deform themselves and their sibling species. So great was their power and arrogance, that they believed themselves to be divine. However, soon the conflict between the Basajaun and the Menn began to grow out of hand. Furthermore, many Ellyllon had been careless and left many of their creations unchecked, with some coming under the ownership of Basajaun and Menn. Once again wary, the Ellyllon turned to their queen for answers.  \n\nAibell, once so wise and farsighted, was now lost and confused. No matter what they did, their enemies would always be equal to them in will and mind. The conflict, whilst a distraction, had merely encouraged their sibling species' colonisation. Eventually, after much thought, she took herself to the tomb of the Behemoth. With much care and effort, she ripped off a piece of its flesh and sculpted a blade of fine point. Once finished, she requested her finest boffins and theurgists to follow her into the realm of Tree.\n\nTravelling deep into the realm, the party soon found themselves in the root of the Tree, a place even The Serpent hadn't dared go to. There, Aibell unsheathed the blade and dug it into the firm wood of the Tree, ripping and pulling until she'd cut a small branch. A branch bathing in power and knowledge. The party left laughing in pride but blind to the sin they had just caused. The Serpent had seen and felt all, and came to loathe the Ellyllon.\n\nTaking the branch, Aibell and her followers planted it in blessed soil. Soon,  the branch grew in leafage and bloom, becoming a small tree, the size of a child. A //Sapling//. Aibell smiled in triumph. Soon, the Sapling would bear fruit. Fruit like no other. Fruit which, when eaten, would grant the user the power over knowledge and story. With this Sapling, Aibell would have control over all wisdom, secrets and mystery in the world, eradicating any threat to her people by reducing great intelligence into primal idiocy. Her people cheered, though one voice of concern spoke out against the cries. //Belphoebe//, one of Aibell's most skilled witches showed great worry, fearing that the Sapling would bring nothing but chaos and conflict and bring consequences that would last for aeons. Aibell, blinded by pride and cleverness, dismissed her witch, claiming her ideas as nothing but needless paranoia.\n\nUnfortunately for the queen, Belphoebe's worry came too late, for later that day, a Mann snuck into the queen's quarters. The Mann's name was  //Ninmah//, a sagacious leader, farmer and warrior. She had been one of the Ellyllon's many studies and had been embedded with great strength and dexterity. That night, applying all her ability, she found the Sapling growing and stole it, taking it back to her home. By the time her captors had noticed, it was already too late.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"fancyborder\"]]\n+  //When All The Flowers Bloomed//\n\nThe war had been hard on Ninmah and her people. Because of the Basajaun, her farms had produced no crops and many of her people had perished in hunger and cold. She hated the Basajaun, more so than the Ellyllon. As a child, she had to be born into war with them and had lost friends and family at their hands. As an adult, she had to give up so much to fuel an endless cycle of bloodshed and weeping. No more.\n\nWith the Sapling in her hands, she hid the artefact in her tribe's crypt and waited. With time and care, the Sapling flowered and sprouted till finally, one autumn night, a single small fruit appeared on one of its branches. Ninmah was surprised at how small it was. It was no bigger than a flake of gravel. Now her time had come, Ninmah felt a great shame within her. In one act, she would destroy an entire intelligence. Their enemies, yes, but also their siblings. Could she really do this?\n\nThen she thought of her people. So long had they been stuck in warfare and pain that there had been so little in life and growth and so much in death. This was the only way she had. So, full of guilt and sadness, Ninmah picked the fruit of the Sapling, swallowed its bitter-sweet aril and changed the world.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nIt began with a question. As the Basajaun walked and sang in the night, they felt together, a feeling alien to them. A disturbed. A shiver. A hollowness. They looked skyward and saw the heavens fill with golden lights. As they glowed, a single sound was heard. A cry. A shriek.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nThen came pain. Oh, what pain. As if cold and lightning were surging through their minds and bodies, the Basajaun felt their souls, both shared and separate, drain and lessen. All they were was fading. Consumed by terror and agony, the Basajaun screamed as one. And as they screamed, the forests and meadows of the world burst with flowers and bloom. Bending and twisting as the Basajaun wailed for hours.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nFinally came the slumber. With their souls now mutilated and their minds now wiped clean, the Basajaun collapsed into a sleep. A sleep so deep, that when the dawn, almost all had died in their rest. Those who woke were lesser than before. Primal. Mere beasts in the forest, with all they were now lost forever.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nAnd so the war ended, and the world was changed, in a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000|day of flowers]]]. At dawn, the tribe woke to find Ninmah dead, clinging to the Sapling, blood pouring from her mouth and eyes full of tears. They knew not what she had done but knew it had been both brave and painful. As for the Ellyllon, they cowered in confusion and fear. They had seen the flowers bloom and the heavens fill with light. They knew that Menn had won and had in their control a weapon of terrifying power. But the worst was yet to come.\n\nSuddenly, the heavens parted and from the Ways, flew the Serpent. Their green eyes flashed with rage and disgust, for it knew whilst humanity had acted, they had done so in fear and ignorance. The sin was the Ellyllon's to bear. So as punishment, the Serpent forbid the Ellyllon access to the Tree from that day on.  And in doing so, so much of their hidden rules and powers were taken from them. Once again, the Ellyllon were mere animals of the world. Furious, the Ellyllon turned on their queen. Aibell was subjected to torture and torment before having her life and immortality stripped from her at the hand of Belphoebe. Now the new queen,  Belphoebe took her people into the dark places of the world, to find new ways of living.\n\nWith the Basajaun slaughtered and dulled and the Ellyllon weakened and divided, the Menn were now free. Before they wandered out into the world, the Serpent descended and spoke to them.  Disappointed but understanding, they commanded the Sapling to be entombed forever in an enchanted pit, as its power was too great for it to be used again.  Then they made a vow to the Menn, promising it would help them in their endeavours, for they did not want to see history repeat itself.\n\nAnd so, with the Serpent now their teacher, the Menn set out. And behind them, they left the Sapling, entombed and forgotten, hopefully, hidden from the world [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8899/offset/2|forever...]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]",
