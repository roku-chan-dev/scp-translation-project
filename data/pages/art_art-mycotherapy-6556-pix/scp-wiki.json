I also did a biiiiit more of an involved animation than usual because I really got into it. Jeez I'm gonna have to start picking out fun palettes ahead of time it was a lot easier. I know it was an omelet but a fried egg read better in pixel art ðŸ˜­\n\nI'm normally more of a Paleozoic person than a Mesozoic one but oh boy do I love this SCP. Ty Rex is so silly and I love the whole vibe of it. The room full of enthusiastic scientists not listening to the voice of reason was extremely enjoyable. \n\nI wanted to make absolutely certain I was drawing the juvenile T-Rex accurately(Well, as accurately as I could in the style) so I referenced a bunch of photos of that one very complete fossil of a juvenile and was kinda surprised how raptor-like their faces were! In 20 years after more research is done this is still going to be obviously inaccurate though. Thus is the cycle of paleontology.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
