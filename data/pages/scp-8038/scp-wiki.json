On June 1st, 2022, SCP-8038 began to appear on both illegal and legal anime streaming sites and platforms online, as well as retroactively on previously-released physical media (VHS, Laserdisc, Blu-Ray, etc.). As only 78 episodes were produced, the sudden existence of a fully-created 79th episode, as well as its appearance on physical media was determined significant enough for Foundation intervention.\n\nAdditionally, while the original 78 episodes of //Sparkling Butterfly// would often focus on either regular life for Fujimiya or her battles against the evil Crystallizing as the mahou shoujo[[footnote]] \"Mahou shoujo\" means magical girl. [[/footnote]] Sparkling Butterfly, SCP-8038 focuses on the titular character reconciling with the main villain of the series. It is also notable that SCP-8038's run time is significantly shorter than any of the episodes of the original series with a run time of approximately 10 minutes, as opposed to the normal 24 minutes and ten seconds.\n\nThe following excerpts are taken from the English Wikipedia article for familiarization purposes.\n\n[[div class=\"minipedia\"]]\n**//Sparkling Butterfly//** (##3366CC|Japanese##: ÁÖå„ÇÅ„Åç„Éê„Çø„Éï„É©„Ç§, ##3366CC|Hepburn##: //Kirameki Batofurai//) also stylized as **//Sparkling! ü¶ã BUTTERFLY//** ( „Ç≠„É©„Ç≠„É©ü¶ã„Çø„Éï„É©„Ç§, //Kirakira Batofurai//), is a Japanese ##3366CC|magical girl anime television series## written and produced by ##3366CC|Sakura Animations## which aired from 1993 to 1995 on MiraiTV and ran for two seasons with a total run of 78 episodes. The series follows Ageha Fujimiya, a 15-year-old high school student who is recruited by the mysterious Dumach and taught how to transform into the magical Sparkling Butterfly, a superheroine with the ability to fight the evil empress Crystallizing who wishes to corrupt the world. While not fighting evil, Fujimiya deals with her daily life and growing up.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"minipedia\"]]\nIn North America and Europe, the anime was released through online streaming on the ##3366CC|//AnimePalace//## streaming service.

She is cheerful and upbeat, with many friends in her class. After being given the power to transform into the superheroine Sparkling Butterfly by Dumach, she promises to fight the monsters sent by her arch-rival, Crystallizing. She loves gardening, insects, and nature. Aspires to be an entomologist. At the end of the series, she chooses to be the last holder of the Sparkling Butterfly title.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Minami Suzuki** (Èà¥Êú® „Åø„Å™„Åø, //Suzuki Minami//)\n[[div class=\"indenter\"]]\nVoiced by: ##3366CC|Chiho Yonemura##\n\nA 15-year-old girl who is Fujimiya's best friend. She is the only one who knows about Fujimiya's ability to transform into Sparkling Butterfly. Although powerless, she supports her best friend and often covers for Fujimiya in class so she can defeat Crystallizing. She is a lot shyer than Fujimiya but very friendly once she is able to connect with someone new.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Haruki Yamamoto** (Â±±Êú¨ Êò•Êú®, //Yamamoto Haruki//)\n[[div class=\"indenter\"]]\nVoiced by: ##3366CC|Tetsuya Kagawa##\n\nA popular 17-year-old boy who also attends Itogahara High School. He is charming and elegant, which has caused almost every girl in the school to fall for him, including Fujimiya. He is friends with Fujimiya and Suzuki, and it is implied that he has a crush on Suzuki. One of the series's running gags involves him loudly praising Sparkling Butterfly's efforts in front of Fujimiya.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Nobu Shimada** (Â≥∂Áî∞ Âüé, //Shimada Nobu//) / **Crystallizing** („ÇØ„É™„Çπ„Çø„É©„Ç§„Ç∏„É≥„Ç∞, //Kurisutaraijingu//)\n[[div class=\"indenter\"]]\nVoiced by: ##3366CC|Y≈´ri Kai ##\n\nAn evil, chaotic adult woman with the ability to cocoon people and turn their greatest desires into a monster called a Chrysalis. Her plots are often disrupted by Fujimiya, who she considers her greatest enemy. She works in disguise at Itogahara Middle School as a PE teacher, but is initially unaware that Fujimiya is Sparkling Butterfly. \n\nIn the final several episodes, it is revealed that she was the original Sparkling Butterfly. Unwillingly forced into the position by Dumach, she rebelled and was subsequently cursed by him, leading to her becoming Crystallizing. She is heavily injured in the finale, and implied to have died.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Mashhit Dumach** („Éû„ÉÉ„Ç∑„É•„Éí„Éº„ÉÑ„Éª„Éâ„Ç•„Éº„Éû„ÉÉ„ÇØ, //Masshuhƒ´tsu Do≈´makku//)\n[[div class=\"indenter\"]]\nVoiced by: ##3366CC|Kaneto Shiozawa##\n\nA mysterious, well-dressed young man who gives Fujimiya the power to become Sparkling Butterfly. Claiming to be an emissary for good, he instructs Fujimiya to fight Crystallizing's attempts to debauch the world.\n\nAt the end of the series, it is revealed that he is directly responsible for Crystallizing's condition. While mostly appearing to be an affable and friendly man, he is actually a very vindictive spider-like being that feeds on chaos and fear. In the finale, both Sparkling Butterfly and Crystallizing work together to defeat him.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n[[size 125%]] **Addendum 01:** Discovery [[/size]]\n\nSCP-8038 first came to Foundation attention on June 1st, 2022, when a Foundation webcrawler picked up possible anomaly keyphrases on a popular forum board dedicated to anime wherein fans of //Sparkling Butterfly// discussed a mysterious new 79th episode of the series. \n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"minichan\"]]\n\n[[size 130%]] Page 201/210 ¬ª **[ __New Episode of Sparkling Butterfly?

I was going to rewatch Sparkling Butterfly so I could make some more fanart, and on PlaceForAnime I noticed there was a 79th episode. I thought this was a mistake at first and was just like a copy of one of the other episodes, so I decided to watch it to make sure. NOPE. It‚Äôs a completely new episode and it‚Äôs still in the animation style of the original series. The plot was really strange to me, as it was about Fujimiya forgiving Crystallizing for everything she did seven years after the series ended. It also was way shorter than a normal episode at just 10 minutes. But there was one really major change that stood out. Crystallizing was a dude. Like we all know she was a woman (yes I'm aware of what the writers planned originally and all but it unfortunately doesn't count). Is this like their way of starting a reboot or something? And why didn‚Äôt they announce its release? Why dump it straight to streaming platforms? Did anyone else see this?\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"minipost\"]]\n[[span class=\"minisig\"]]##18612E|SoleilFruit## | JUN. 01, 2022 | #267422742[[/span]]\n \nI saw this too, and I honestly wondered if I was going crazy.
