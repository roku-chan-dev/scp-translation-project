Note the isotype of the [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3790 Department of █████████████] in the lower right-hand corner.\n|width=300px\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-ES-243 is currently contained in the High Value Intert Objects Wing of Site-34. The possible functioning anomalous properties of SCP-ES-243 are currently under study.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ES-243 refers to an electromechanical device similar in appearance to a 64m^^2^^ soundproof booth, which was initially rusted and oxidized in appearance.\n\nSCP-ES-243 is composed mainly of titanium, aluminum, and magnesium alloys, though more atypical materials have been found, including osmium, beryllium, chromium, and [[[scp-2046|a material as of yet unidentified by the Foundation]]].\n\nSCP-ES-243's interior has several components with multiple control panels and a pair of elctromechanical terminals for operating them. However, it is currently impossible to do this, as the terminals are inoperative. Nonetheless, it is possible for data from both terminals to be retrieved from SCP-ES-243.\n\nSCP-ES-243's front and multiple parts of its interior are inscribed with emblems of the Foundation and/or one of its Departments. However, there is no evidence of the Foundation contributing to SCP-ES-243's construction, nor being aware of its existence prior to its discovery.\n\nAdditional investigations are currently underway.\n\n**Recovery Log:** On 11 November 1999, at 03:30, the SCP Observation Satellite //Jankovic// detected unusual disturbances in the [[[SCP-ES-154|Reality Gradient]]] in the Chihuahuan Desert, Chihuahua, Mexico. Approximately three minutes later, a 31,5km^^2^^ hole began to appear on the ground, releasing a large quantity of Disforming Radiation[[footnote]] Disforming Radiation is an anomalous phenomenon that is identifiable by the alteration of a Reality Gradient in a specific area, representing the presence of local reality imbalances. This type of radiation is invariably subsequent to a considerably powerful reality alterating event.[[/footnote]] that would dissipate unusually rapidly shortly after.\n\nDue to the possibility of a topological or geological anonaly, Mobile Task Force [[[Task Forces#Zeta-9|Zeta-9 (\"Mole Rats\")]]] was deployed to the area to investigate and explore the formed crater. Zeta-9's initial mapping of the area uncovered an organized complex cave and tunnel system within the crater divided into nine levels.\n\nSCP-ES-243 was discovered, with signs of having been frozen, at the crater's bottom. Subsequent analysis of the other eight levels revealed no signs of anomalous activity or other abnormalities.\n\n**Addendum A:** Data from SCP-ES-243's terminals are transcribed below. Note that a large quantity of the data is corrupted. Efforts to restore these files are in progress.\n\n[[==]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Item #** {{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\n{{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\n{{[CORRUPTED]}} Maximum Security Sub-Level Seven in Area-161.\n\nAll files relevant to Project DESCENT are to be sent for review to Dr. Re{{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\nAll tests with the item are to be dismissed with predjudice.\n\n{{[CORRUPTED]}}666 refers to an electromechanical device similar to{{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\n{{[CORRUPTED]}} recovered from a subterranean facility with insignias indicating it belonging to the Department of Abn{{[CORRUPTED]}} the SCP Foundation has a{{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\nArea exploration has revealed a large amount of Cath{{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> Applied {{[CORRUPTED]}} has offered its assistance with SCP-ES-{{[CORRUPTED]}} gone well.

We will conduct tests on the net{{[CORRUPTED]}} composition.\n\n> The results {{[CORRUPTED]}}rite, a strange choice for machine building. Those in AO are investigating whether it has something to do with an antique rit{{[CORRUPTED]}}ite.  Because of how sensitive our information is, we'll be moving the artifact to a Maximum {{[CORRUPTED]}} Wing.\n\n> We found some kind of clock within one {{[CORRUPTED]}} It wasn't operating until we found it, and now the artifact is constantly ticking, although the hands don't move {{[CORRUPTED]}} 00:00. Midnight?\n\n> Analyzing out security footage confirms nothing {{[CORRUPTED]}} at Midnight. The artifact's hands do not move like a standard clock, though we haven't been able to discern their exact followed pattern. More research must be done in the future.\n\n> Applied {{[CORRUPTED]}} has made some... strange... discoveries. It appears that the use of Nether{{[CORRUPTED]}} after all, so we'll have to take more esoteric measures. To more properly study and contain the item, we will move it to a High {{[CORRUPTED]}} Wing. I have requested that Dr. Guttiérrez prepare transport for a set of {{[CORRUPTED]}} Anchors.\n\n> The equipment was installed successfully and the item transferred with no problems. The boys in the AOD are working on looking at the machine's functionality. We have nothing concrete, a few theories. A few tests have been scheduled for tomorrow. Hopefully we're able to {{[CORRUPTED]}} Midnight on this.\n\n> The fact the clock doesn't stop, no matter how far we go... It frightens me.\n\n> Important {{[CORRUPTED]}}. With what we're seeing, we may need more specific personnel. Personnel specialized in the study of {{[CORRUPTED]}}tholicism. And I think I know where to look. Crossing my fingers they'll accept our request for help.\n\n> Tactical {{[CORRUPTED]}} was succesfully integrated into Project DESCENT. The more personnel we can get, the better. [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-050-int Consultant Jackson] will be arriving in our area in a couple {{[CORRUPTED]}}\n\n> DoTT personnel showed great interest in {{[CORRUPTED]}} DESCENT. Almost as if it was a relig{{[CORRUPTED]}} admiration. Ironic. Though, I wasn't sure the AOD boys would collaborate well with the DoTT boys. In any case, I don't think there's much difference between them, other than their specialized training and gear.\n\n> Now AO is basically out of the Project, Theo's previous {{[CORRUPTED]}} override protocols are now in place.
