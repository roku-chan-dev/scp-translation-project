Can anyone on this floor see anything?\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Gentlemen, is this Security Station Theta Blue?\n> \n> **Agent Randolph:**  There's some sort of containment issue right now, you shouldn't be. . . oh.  Sorry Doctor.  What are your orders?\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Please pass me the microphone if you can find it, Agent Randolph.  I need to make a site-wide announcement.\n> \n> //- Static and feedback -// \n> \n> **Agent Randolph:** -at's it.\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Attention, all Foundation Personnel.  This is Doctor Gears.  There has been a containment incident resulting in the temporary blindness of all sighted individuals in Site-19.  Remain calm and do not leave your workstations.  I repeat.  Remain calm and do not leave your workstations.\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Thank you, Agent.  Please put that on repeat.\n> \n> **Agent Randolph:**  Yes sir... I think this is it.  There.  So this is temporary?\n> \n> //- Recording of statement by Doctor Gears can be heard repeating in distance -//\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  It should be, Agent.  An experiment with Me2515 has gone awry, however our research strongly suggests this will pass within the next six hours.  Please contact Site-23 and have them send in a relief team to secure this location.\n> \n> **Agent Randolph:**  Already done, ETA is 19:45.  God, I hate to imagine what must be going on in some of the lower levels right now.\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  The lower levels are contained by blast shields, all personnel there should be safe.  Casualties will be worse if there is a panic.  Would you kindly secure the door?\n> \n> **Agent Randolph:**  Those poor bastards are down there with the really dangerous stuff and they can't even see anything though -\n> \n> //- Rattling noises -// \n> \n> **Agent Randolph:** -icks should be on his way back, we need to let him -\n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Please secure the door Agent.\n> \n> //- Screams heard in the hallway -// \n> \n> **Agent Hicks via security radio:**  Goddamn it!  Answer me you fucks!  I said 173 has escaped containment!  173 has escaped containment!\n> \n> //- Screaming stops.  Loud scraping noises -// \n> \n> **Doctor Gears:**  Agent.  Please secure the door.\n> \n> END AUDIO\n\n//Note to O5:  This is the transcript of an audio file recovered during the weekly scan and backup of servers at Site-19.  We have no records on anything labeled Me2515 and there is nothing to corroborate what is contained in this file.  Agents Randolph and Hicks were KIA during a field mission in '08 and Doctor Gears was not stationed at Site-19 during their rotation there. - Site-19 IT dept//\n\n//It's probably leftovers from some prank involving 050 again.  Just delete it. - O5-8//\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
