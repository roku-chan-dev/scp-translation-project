My name is Everett Mann. I was your predecessor until I was blackballed by the Administrator, Francis Fritzwilliams. He preferred to be called Fritz by his friends. Until I was burned, I thought I was one of them.\n@@ @@\nI wish I could give you more details at the moment. Unfortunately, all I know is that he transferred over a hundred anomalies to Overwatch Command. Then he framed me for an elaborate plot to kill the other Overseers -- my friends.\n@@ @@\nI'm on the run, so I can't teach you as much as my predecessor taught me. I'll send you as many logs as I can. Don't focus on how they're getting to you, just what's inside them. Fritz undoubtedly has you on a screw-tight leash, but our duty is still to protect the world. You'll have to kill him to save the Foundation. Then you can get back to saving mankind.\n@@ @@\nDespite his myriad failings, Fritz always had a talent for delegation. You are an Overseer. And that means you have the wisdom to make plans, the cunning and tenacity to see them through, and the paranoia to ensure that they can't be traced back to you. More than that, you still have the drive to do the right thing.\n@@ @@\nBut I'm getting ahead of myself. It won't do you any good to run out and get yourself killed. Before you even think of raising a hand against him, you'll need three key things: a lair, escape plans, and safehouses.\n@@ @@\nYour lair is your first line of defense. Stock it with guards and line it with traps so that when Fritz comes you'll have time to get away. In fact, ignore the guards. Traps only betray you if you're stupid enough to fall into them. When Fritz first burned me, he sent his own death squad to my door. I should've been easy prey -- a hermit who'd holed up in an Arctic shack for nearly thirty years at that point. My Factotums did everything short of shit for me. Do you still call them that? They were our body doubles. The people who looked, spoke, sounded like us -- who acted and died for us. I imagine you do.\n@@ @@\nMy point is, I spent all my time making decisions and then smoking the memory of those decisions away. When Fritz came for me, I barely remembered how to hold a gun or even how to throw a punch. But I often read \"The Most Dangerous Game\", and it inspired me to rig the entrance to my lair with Malay man-catchers and Burmese tiger pits. These were crude and simple traps -- so simple that every man on that death squad fell for one. It gave me the time I needed to escape.\n@@ @@\nEscape plans are the second piece of the puzzle. Be ready to exfiltrate anytime and anywhere, be it the toilet or mid-meeting. Have fake escape plans to share with your closest friends. Stress the importance of keeping them quiet. Those are the ones that will be given to Fritz first. Your plans to escape your lair are more important than your lair itself. I escaped through a secret tunnel, so Fritz will probably be wise to those. I apologize for that. Drill some anyways. Use them as red herrings. Maybe teleportation is mundane in your time. If not, find some SCPs that let you teleport. Fast.\n@@ @@\nFrom this point on, safehouses will be your only refuge. Plan for the end of the world. Establish lots of them, stocked with as many supplies as you can get your hands on -- anomalous or not. Have fake safehouses. Steal anomalies that can get you to your safehouses. At any and every Foundation site, have a mole in place you can contact. Have two or three or four if you can. If you can't trust them, blackmail them. As one of the secret rulers of the world, you have every resource that you could possibly dream of. Use them proactively -- but discreetly!\n@@ @@\nI was lucky enough to download the contents of Fritz's email box and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-268 |nab a cap that made me practically invisible]]], but unlucky enough to have trusted him with most all of my other failsafes. Learn from my mistakes and make your own luck. Take what you can. If you succeed, you can always put it back.\n@@ @@\nThis task must seem daunting. Your enemy has the entire Foundation behind him, and maybe the entire rest of the anomalous community as well. I wish I could offer you reassurance or moral fortitude but I can't. I can only tell you that if you've become an Overseer then you are indeed the most qualified for the job. That knowledge carried me through my darkest moments.

So let's move on. By now, you're almost certainly holed up in a safe house somewhere and trying to determine your next move. KILL THE ADMINISTRATOR: a laudable goal, but how do you get from here to there?\n@@ @@\nBefore I was an overseer, I was a silencer: a member of a highly clandestine Foundation task force tasked with eliminating the leadership of the Chaos Insurgency. In the process, Fritz and I developed an eminently effective set of rules for carrying out this task. Rather ironic that we're going to use it against him.\n@@ @@\nThe first and most important rule of silencing is to ask the right questions. As Sun Tzu put it, know your enemy and know yourself and you can fight a hundred battles without disaster. However, Sun Tzu certainly did not have listening devices or email logins or any of the glut of tools available to your disposal. Your problem is almost certainly not knowing your enemy -- it's knowing too much. Just ask the five W's about your enemy: who, what, where, when, and why? Then solve them.\n@@ @@\nWith these questions in mind, I started digging through Fritz's email and found the attached message from Doctor Wondertainment. Whatever Fritz's plan is, the secret rulers of the entire anomalous world are conspirators within it. Unfortunately, Fritz chose to send the file as regular mail rather than email. Given its significance, I decided to go to Wonder World to retrieve it.\n@@ @@\nMaybe you think I should try to assassinate Wondertainment. That's understandable. Fritz would've made you play chess with him once a fortnight. So you almost certainly think that this is like a game of chess. You have to checkmate the king, but first remove the pieces around him. Pick off his pieces one-by-one. Play dirty.\n@@ @@\nMaybe that will work for you. Maybe you have an army of laser death satellites at your disposal. I'm just an old man with an invisibility cap who has to pick his battles. In all my years as an Overseer, all I ever learned about the Doctor was her infinite caprice and malice. Better simply to know what she does and let her squabble with Fritz about it.\n@@ @@\nWondertainment's base of operations is [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/wonder-world-dossier |Wonder World]]]: a pocket dimension that houses her factories and corporate headquarters. But in the decades that we've known about it, we only ever sent a single task force inside. The longer a person stays inside, the more they change -- mutating and becoming something other than human. I'll have to work quickly.\n@@ @@\nTo do: Unravel the conspiracy.\n[[/div]]\n[!-- END DIV FOR O5_1 NOTES --]\n\n[!-- BEGIN DIV FOR O5_1 NOTES --]\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nThe second rule of silencing is to keep your eyes and ears open but your mouth closed. There is a portal into Wonder World on the corner of Birch Road and Loring Road at Chelsea Point. It is opened by ripping the heads off of a G.I. Joe and Barbie doll simultaneously, then tossing them into the trash can in the alley at the intersection aforementioned roads. It took me weeks to find, lurking around the city with little more than a jacket and flask to warm me while trying to suss out the Doctor's men from the blue-collars. But it paid off. Despite the chill, it feels good to be out in the field again.\n@@ @@\nThe portal at Chelsea Point deposited me approximately 1.5 kilometers east of the Doctor's base of operations: the so-called Wonder Tower. Boston is a miserable city, with miserable roads and miserable people and miserable freezing chills. But its natural misery is infinitely preferable to Wonder World's facade of happiness. That place had no sun, only a tambourine drum hanging in a purple sky. Its buildings were stripped from the nightmares of Dali and Escher, possibly literally. Still, the city thrummed with a distinctly urban energy that not even the Doctor could cover in sugar. It's an energy I'd almost forgotten after being away from civilization so long.\n@@ @@\nWonder Tower itself is a monument to the Doctor's hubris -- an ugly purple spire that dominates the skyline, with massive steps leading into an equally massive lobby. Having relied on my cap to shield me for most of the day, I crossed the lobby and asked the secretary for keycard access to the Doctor's private office. She handed it off and told me in the same breath that the Doctor was out of the office.\n@@ @@\nThe third rule of silencing is to be patient. I should have waited and established a schedule of the Doctor's comings and goings. But I was complacent. Age had atrophied my skills, and the cap barely covered those deficiencies. I let haste overcome my better judgment -- and it nearly killed me.\n[[/div]]\n[!-- END DIV FOR O5_1 NOTES --]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[module CSS]]\n.addendum {\n    border:solid 2px #999999;\n    background:#F5F5F5;\n    width:84%;\n    padding:1px 15px;\n    margin: 10px auto;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n= **CCTV CAMERA 13: OFFICE EXTERIOR**\n----\n//[Camera sweeps to elevator.

When a cataloged SCP --willingly-- enters SCP-5555, it will die. Its skills, personality, and anomalous attributes will be slightly modified and reassigned to a new instance, which will instantaneously manifest near the location of the SCP's initial discovery.

Why did you save me from your co-conspirators?\"\n> \n> \"Co-conspirators, eh? Truth be told, Herman's always been one a' Holly's pals more'n mine. An' Bobby's just fun t' mess around with.\"\n> \n> Fritz drank from his glass and held up a finger. The two of them sat there for the minute, savoring the taste of the alcohol. Then he swallowed and winced slightly. \"I saved you because they're a couple'a spoilsports. Lemme tell you somethin', Rhett. Yer like this Pappy Van Winkle -- fulla potential, but ya gotta age and gain experience for the best flavor. Yer what, eighty now? Ninety? But you hotwired those site nukes like you were thirty. An' those Burmese tiger-pits-- made me proud to burstin'.\"\n> \n> He took another sip of his bourbon. \"Or th' way you got into Site-67. You shoulda read that email Clef sent me. Boy was hoppin' mad about you pullin' one over on him. Not t'mention th' way you've been raising hell with the others. Yer a one-man army -- you just needed a little bit more time. Sure, th' others weren't too keen on ya at first, God love 'em, but they started to see yer value once ya started blowin' up my own spaceships. Yer the shot in th' arm this game needed, son-- and we're th' kinda people you need to be your best self.\"\n> \n> Mann gritted his teeth, but simply drank and refilled his tumbler.\n> \n> \"Medium,\" Fritz said. \"You been havin' fun?\"\n> \n> \"A little,\" Mann said. \"It's been nice to travel and apply myself in the field again. Working with my hands. Planning and executing infiltration ops. Being responsible for everything. Having a gun in my hands.\"\n> \n> He drank and held up a finger. \"Not so nice? Why I've been out there. Why I'm all by myself. What you did to -- the //Foundation//. Some goddamn father figure you turned out to be.\"\n> \n> Fritz winced. \"Rhett --\"\n> \n> \"Shut up,\" Mann said. \"I'm not done. The pork chops, the Pappy, the bandaging? That don't make up fer any the bullshit you done.\"\n> \n> He emptied his glass again and took Fritz's. \"I've shot a hundred and thirteen Chaos Insurgents, run through twenty body doubles, had thirteen world leaders assassinated, nine more replaced, ordered nineteen false flag operations, and racked up sixty thousand civilian casualties at th' last estimate. You taught me how to do that. Then just -- \" he emptied the glass -- \"you just tossed it all out the damn window inta that damn pit a' yours. Tried t' toss me out.\"\n> \n> Mann slammed the glass onto the table. It shattered. \"Long. Why th' hell did you do it all?\"\n> \n> Fritz looked Mann dead in the eyes. \"One billion, three hundred million.\"\n> \n> \"What?\" Mann said.\n> \n> \"Hell of a number, innit? Bobby says that's my all-time body count. All the people killed by or because a' me. He's always bin' pretty good with numbers. But I don't worry about that number cause they're just people.\"\n> \n> Fritz got up and rummaged through the cupboards under the sink. \"You an' me, we're //more// n' that. I knew it the day I first laid eyes on ya, you ain't one in a million, yer one in a million years. But you got that damnable streak a' empathy in ya. When I get you to forget it... boy, you do amazin' things.\"\n> \n> \"Like kill thousands?\" Mann said.\n> \n> \"You said it yerself.\" Fritz emerged with a dustpan and began sweeping up the glass around the table. \"Shut down th' Insurgency, put your yoke to th' UN's neck, even strongarmed al Fine into helpin' you erase North Korea from memory. Thought fer sure I was hosed that time, but you fixed it. You were winnin' the damn game for me all by yer self. Then y' went off and developed a damn conscience. Hid in th' Arctic and let yerself go. Squanderin' yer gifts like that? Cut me to th' quick.\"\n> \n> He went and tossed the debris into the trash. \"I've been there before, a couple times. I figured you'd get outta yer slump soon, but before I knew it thirty years had gone by. Game was endin' soon and I couldn't let you go t' waste. But you got that inertia.  Once you get goin' you don't stop, but you needed that push t' get ya rolling.\"\n> \n> \"A push?\" Mann stood up and poked Fritz in the chest. \"You bastard. You absolute goddamn bastard. I wish you were my real father so I could disown you.\"\n> \n> Fritz shrugged. \"If that's what it takes.\"\n> \n> Mann punched him in the face.\n> \n> Fritz rubbed his jaw and stared at him. \"That's some right hook. Technique's flawless. Even when yer sluggin' yer old man yer impeccable. You gotta get over these damn feelings, Rhett. They're only gonna slow you down.\"\n> \n> Mann clenched his teeth so hard his jaw hurt. The bourbon was starting to kick in. \"What th' hell else you want from me? Want me to pretend I'm fine with this? That I like this -- this game you're playing, using th' world as your goddamn Monopoly board?\"\n> \n> \"Who said anythin' about pretendin'?\" Fritz said. \"Just be yerself -- th' spy, th' assassin, th' one-man army. Throw a monkey wrench into things. I've had more fun followin' your globetrottin' adventures than I've had in the last dozen games combined.\"\n> \n> Fritz poured the last of the bourbon into the remaining glass and offered it to Mann. \"Long. Ready to have some fun?\"\n> \n> Mann drew and fired before either of them realized he'd grabbed it. Fritz collapsed backwards and fell against the wall with a sharp crack. The glass of bourbon shattered on the ground.\n> \n> \"There's your fucking monkey wrench, old man,\" Mann said.\n> \n> A moment passed. There was another crack as Fritz's neck realigned itself and a faint tinking sound as a bone-covered bullet popped out of his forehead. Fritz stood up, cracked his neck, and clapped Mann on the back. \"Lookit that, yer already gettin' into the swing of things.\"\n> \n> Mann sat down heavily.\n> \n> \"Don't take it so harsh, son,\" Fritz said. \"You did a helluva job and you'll fit right in. Who knows, y'might even learn t'enjoy yourself. C'mon, we gotta get you set up and up to speed on th' rules.\"\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n\n-----\n\n[[# Epilogue]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/yurt/seal.png\") top 5px right 5px no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**From:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\n##red|@@administrator@site01.scp.int@@##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**To:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nCycle (Group)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Subject:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nGood game, everyone!\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right\"]]\n**Date:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell]]\nX\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n\nThanks for playing!
