A search for PoI-7278 is ongoing.\n\n---------------------------------------------\n\n++++ **__Description__**\n\nSCP-7278 is an object which has become definitionally compromised. To clarify, it is impossible to accurately describe all of SCP-7278's properties and conceptual being within a single word or phrase, with attempts by the Department of Miscommunications only being able to reach the 70% threshold. It is for this reason that determining the true nature of SCP-7278 is extremely difficult and likely impossible.\n\nExtensive testing of SCP-7278 has managed to determined that it has the following properties:\n* It is mechanical in nature;\n* Its volume is approximately 1.6 m^^3^^ and its weight is approximately 300 kg;\n* Its shape is that of a rectangular prism;\n* One of its sides has a keypad attached to it as well as a slot to insert money into;\n* It contains several low cost candies and snacks, such as chocolate bars and bags of potato chips;\n* It will dispense said candies once money has been placed into it and a code has been entered into the keypad, associated with the dispensed candy,\n\nSCP-7278 gained its anomalous properties following a thaumaturgic ritual being performed upon it by an unknown Fae thaumaturgist (PoI-7278).\n\nSCP-7278 was discovered on the streets of FP-120 (\"[[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]]\") on 2/27/2019. The object was given to the Foundation's safekeeping by the Esterberg government.\n--------------------------------------\n\n++++ **__Incident 7278.01__**\n\nSCP-7278 gained its anomalous properties on 2/26/2019 after the following incident.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Date:** 2/26/2019\n\n**Subject:** PoI-7278\n\n**Foreword:** The following log was taken by an Esterberg security camera. Footage procured after the incident. \n-----\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//PoI-7278 walks across the street, whistling slightly. They stop in front of SCP-7278.//\n\n//PoI-7278 produces a 5 złoty coin from their pocket and places it within SCP-7278. After a pause, the SCP-7278 rejects the coin and PoI-7278 takes it back. They then attempt to place it back into SCP-7278. This repeats approximately twenty times, with PoI-7278 growing increasingly more exasperated.//\n\n//PoI-7278 attempts to use a different 5 złoty coin and this time succeeds in having SCP-7278 accept the coin. PoI-7278 then types 52 on the keypad, corresponding to a Grześki chocolate bar.//\n\n//SCP-7278 rejects PoI-7278's coin and its screen displays a \"no designation found\" error. PoI-7278 stares at SCP-7278 for approximately twenty seconds before beginning to bang on and shake SCP-7278. No change is noted within SCP-7278.//\n\n//PoI-7278 then attempts to purchase the chocolate bar, dropping the coin and picking it up several times. Each time they attempt to type a number into the keypad, they are met with a \"no designation found\" error. This repeats for some time, each time being punctuated by PoI-7278 verbally and physically abusing SCP-7278.//\n\n//PoI-7278 shakes their fist angrily and bangs on SCP-7278.//\n\n**PoI-7278:** Skurwysynu![[footnote]]A Polish curse word.[[/footnote]]\n\n//PoI-7278 glows with Elan Vital Energy as they begin to attempt a thaumaturgic ritual.//\n\n**PoI-7278:** //(in Polish)// I'll show you no designation found...\n\n//The recording ends.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7277]]] | SCP-7278 | [[[SCP-7279]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
