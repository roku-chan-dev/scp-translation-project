Today, finding out the answer would be a simple Google search on your phone. Of course, this advancement has birthed more progressive and complex anomalies.

Not to mention, you are an Overseer responsible for overseeing Foundation projects, so to have someone like you take the role of that kind is questionable. \n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]##b49f60|**Omar Amandi:**##[[/span]] Speaking of which, we both know the remaining Overseers are going to vote on whether they should kick you out, or not for that matter. The only ones who can overrule that are the Ethics Committee, and Administrator, which is unlikely they'll side with you because most of the Ethics Committee are working hard to make sure you are punished for what happened and figuring out who could take your place. More than 300 sites can't even work properly because of what you've caused, and more than a thousand digital anomalies have experienced containment difficulties thanks to [[span class=\"bt\"]]##52a3cc|SCP-8747##[[/span]], so from here on out, //you have to plead guilty to the Ethics Committee//.\n\n//<[[span class=\"bt\"]]##395e7f|**O5-8:**##[[/span]] places both of his hands onto his face, as his elbows are placed onto the desk to provide support.

Well, there isn't much of a choice for the Foundation to deal with containing [[span class=\"bt\"]]##52a3cc|SCP-8747##[[/span]] itself, so the idea reprogramming AO-8747 to repair the Cybersphere isn't out of the question thanks to it's systems and hardware.
