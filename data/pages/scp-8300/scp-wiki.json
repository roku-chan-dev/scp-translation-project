[[/footnote]] SCP-8300 is the complete and instantaneous cessation of all anomalous phenomena on December 31st, 2023. This comes to fruition in different ways depending on the kind of anomaly being affected. For example:\n\n* Anomalous entities whose anomalous properties are central to their existence perish or otherwise vanish from baseline reality.\n* Anomalous entities with anomalous capabilities not central to their existence lose said abilities.\n* Anomalous objects lose their properties or cease to exist entirely.\n* Anomalous locations lose their properties, cease to exist, or slowly regress into an alternate, \"normal\" form. [[footnote]] (see Jay Everwood's \"Comprehensive Report of Anomalous Nexuses, Post-SCP-8300\") [[/footnote]]\n* Anomalous events cease occurrence.\n\nCurrently, the reason for SCP-8300 is unknown, as is whether the effect of the anomaly is permanent.\n\nDue to this unprecedented development, insight from the remainder of several GOIs, and a unanimous vote from the Overseer Council, it was decided to enact an intentional \"XK-Class Broken Masquerade\" scenario. Restructuring of the SCP Foundation into \"The Foundation Museum for Anomalous History\" is ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\nI can't say nobody ever expected it.\n\nPeople across all wakes of life in the Foundation have proposed a theoretical end to the anomalous before.

This time, not so much.\n\nI was in Alpha Command when it happened, during the yearly conference with the O5s I'm glad to be leaving behind. The benefit of being a trusted member of staff is that you get entrusted with an annual reminder of purely how much work you do, and how much work is left. I was just in the middle of showing the Accounting Department's budget report, when... a phone rings.\n\nThen another.\n\nThen another.\n\nThen, in the most terrifying turn of events you can imagine happening in a hierarchical organization like ours, O5-3 shorts out. O5-2 literally fades away from existence. One by one, overseers popped out of this universe as if they'd never even been there; I think the only ones left by the end of it were 4 and 12. Well, and the corpse of 13, if you can count it.

As a result of SCP-8300, millions of anomalous people and animals have been lost worldwide. Entire cultures have vanished, with few left to carry their memory.\n\nIn a unanimous vote, we have decided this cannot stand.

O5-12 looks to the people on his side: they shrug, almost defeatedly.//\n\n**O5-4:** Not like it matters much now.\n\n**O5-12:** Ah. Hah, I guess... yeah, I guess there's not much hiding it anymore. Hello, then, world. My name is Anton Radu, and I hold- or, I should say //held// the office of O5-12 for 5 years. I was nicknamed the \"Archaeologist\" and the \"Normalist\" by my peers, and to all the personnel of Site-18 watching this, I'm sorry for my... my disappearance.\n\n//Radu is silent for a moment.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=Mircea_Lucescu_(cropped).jpg|caption=Overseer Anton Radu.|width=300px]]\n\n**A. Radu:** And that's the thing about all of it, really. The secrecy, the collusion with governments, the deception, and the risks taken- god, it wasn't even exclusive to our outer relations. You can tell, just from that, that the secrets were in between us as well.\n\n//Radu stands up.//\n\n**A. Radu:** But it was all for a reason. We told ourselves it was for a reason, a justified reason, so we kept it going for as long as we possibly could. Not just for security, or our own protection, but because in the eyes of our founders, the worlds of fantasy and normality couldn't mix. For either of their sake, it was seen as too dangerous.\n\n**A. Radu:** With such immense resources placed in our hands, there was- there was an implied duty, a //trust// we had to hold. With that trust comes power, and with that power comes mistakes and power-trips, yes, and I cannot justify a lot of what we've done, but it was seen as a necessity. That's why I lied to my friends and family, for example, for 5 years that I wasn't dead. I missed out on... I missed out on 3 funerals for all of this.\n\n**A. Radu:** The anomalous was our dedication, consequences of intentions aside.\n\n//Radu is silent. He sighs, lowers his head for a moment, and takes a deep breath. Moose and Li shuffle in their seats uncomfortably.//\n\n**A. Radu:** But now, it's gone. All of it, within a matter of moments, vanished. Every memetic shield we put in place, every object imbued with the concept of \"[[[SCP-021-J|pure evil]]]\", every goddamn [[[SCP-7209|matrix machine we built]]], they... they vanished. Blink of an eye, everything the SCP Foundation stood for, reduced to ashes. Not even ashes, actually. For some, it was as if they'd never even been there.\n\n**A. Radu:** We spent a long time debating what to do. Many of our best scientists, the ones who survived, tried to formulate a plan to kickstart the anomalous again. The problem was, most of our creative solutions to major problems like this... well, they involved anomalous concepts. They required us to access something conventional science just couldn't do. Magic... magic was gone, and seemingly forever.\n\n**A. Radu:** We reached a conclusion, though, eventually. That's what any of you out here who didn't secretly know about the anomalous world are here for, anyway. It was a pretty reasonable one, and it... it's been viewed as the best option going forward. We don't know //why// SCP-8300 -- that's what the file in my hand this whole time has been -- happened, so- so nobody knows if we can fix it.\n\n**A. Radu:** But we've adapted before. Sure, to lesser gods and weaker beasts, but the SCP Foundation is nothing if not permeable throughout challenges. With the remaining resources and all the remains we have, and the history we hold... it felt appropriate.\n\n//Li clicks to the next slide.//\n\n**A. Radu:** I'd like to introduce the world to The Foundation, Museum for Anomalous History. Open for operations worldwide within the next year.\n\n//Radu sighs.//\n\n**A.

Prior to SCP-8300, EXB-07939 was the leader of an anti-human revolutionary Group of Interest[[footnote]] **Groups of Interest** were organizations other than the SCP Foundation which existed in the world of the anomalous. Whether they worked with the SCPF or against them, their intentions, methods of execution, and places in the the anomalous world varied greatly. Some GOIs -- as they're called -- even exist to this day, such as the UNGOC, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, and the Unusual Incidents Unit! [[/footnote]] named \"The New Whirled Order\", which killed at least 500 people during their assault against the Foundation. Despite his diminutive stature, EXB-07939 was, during his reign as the leader of the New Whirled Order, considered one of the SCP Foundation's biggest threats.\n\nFurther information regarding Khazi, the New Whirled Order, and the related conflict can be found in the newly installed gallery \"[[[the-appliance-war-hub|The Appliance War: Ceramic and Blood]]]\", located in Hall A of the Northern Ontario location.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\nIt was the strangest thing.\n\nI wasn't born or raised a soldier. Intentionally avoided military service, and really shied away from the concept itself entirely. My dad, he came from that kind of background, and he knew what it did to a person. He wasn't one to force his trauma on me, thank god.\n\nUnfortunately, though, I did end up caught in a war. Spent years mulling away at the Foundation, doing grunt work and climbing up the corporate ladder, getting promoted to the definition of a \"technically meaningful job\" at Site-37, trying to pull a department together after years of neglect, and boom. A toilet explodes on our doorstep. Then three more explode across the eastern seaboard. By 2 weeks in, our organization has to implement a Foundation-wide ban on toilets. Microwaves start to turn up to the maximum heat. A blender... what the blender did isn't worth repeating for this, even if I could.\n\nI think the younger ones started calling it the \"Appliance War\". I was never huge on the idea, myself, but I was too occupied in a newfound promotion to \"Director of Appliance Response\" -- an insane position to get promoted to, mind you -- to think too hardly about it. At least someone was having fun, and hey, I think we all laughed at him too.\n\n\"Khazi\". Ethel told me it was a British slang term for a toilet, but you couldn't convince me that the little freak of a toilet didn't invent the word himself, as some kind of horrible foreshadowing for what was to come. God. Sorry, I just really, //really// hate that toilet.\n\nIn retrospect, and this is a commonly shared opinion among the regular folks -- mostly the ones who never saw the consequences of what the \"Appliance War\" yielded -- the titular appliances were probably right. Sure, we never //knew// that they were living, technically breathing, for-sure-feeling creatures, but we always could have asked. Especially us at the Foundation, we should have seen it coming, and in all honestly, we would have heard him out. But Khazi, ha, he was //not// the guy they should have had representing them if they wanted to be heard out reasonably. There's something admirable in fighting against oppression, obviously so, but Khazi wasn't in it for them. He never was.\n\nWe did extensive research into his background. Wouldn't you believe it, a toilet had disappeared from Alpha Command only 3 years prior, matching the exact description of the little bastard. Even more digging, and we traced his steps everywhere, from the shady backrooms dealing to the indiscriminate disposal of the forces he deemed weaker, or as he put it, \"not worth fighting for\". I don't think there was much sympathy for him specifically, maybe the occasional jab from Mayfield about him being a \"twink\" -- whatever that means -- but after all this, I can tell you there was nothing.\n\nSo it was the strangest thing, watching him fly down from atop his bidet-fortress, scepter in hand, army of flying sinks and toilets and microwaves descending upon Site-37, delivering his speech about the \"fruitlessness of man\", landing upon the ground in front of me, pointing what was essentially a loaded gun at me, when...\n\nHe stopped.\n\nFor the first time in all the time I've known Khazi, he stopped talking.\n\nThe scepter dropped to the ground, the bidet fortress thing fell down, and the forest outside of our facility went quiet. Certainly not the weirdest way a war has been won, I guess.\n\nI don't think anyone will miss him, per se, but I think we'll miss the others.

Asheworth asked me to visit personally, though, so I hopped on a plane over to Poland, and...\n\nIt was a ghost town. The only sound that permeated through those hallowed streets were the tears of the few remaining.\n\nI hear the current plan is for The Foundation, Esterberg to be a cultural heritage site for the Fae and Yeren, rest their souls.\n\nThere's really nothing more horrifying than a magician who's run out of tricks.\n\n------\n\n++ HY-BRASIL\n+++++ FORMER CLASSIFICATION: ###ffc800|CAMELOT##\n++++++ REEVALUATED DESIGNATION: ##grey|VACANT##\n\nFor the first time in years, there wasn't a sound in Hy-Brasil. No MC&D agents trying to take Fae gold or Kaiju eggs. No aforementioned Kaijus ravaging the island. No arguments between the Foundation and the ruling monarchs. All I could hear was the sound of the waves, splashing against the nearby rotting corpse of the last monster we \"slayed\".\n\nI'm starting to think this trip was a mistake.\n\n------\n\n++ DALEPORT ([[[SCP-1936]]])\n+++++ FORMER CLASSIFICATION: ##red|DUNWICH##\n++++++ REEVALUATED DESIGNATION: ##grey|VACANT##\n\nSmelled like a dead body.\n\n------\n\n++ CIPHER CITY\n+++++ FORMER CLASSIFICATION: ##008888|TURING##\n++++++ REEVALUATED DESIGNATION: ##red|LOST##\n\nTried to log into the city with the help of one of our Maxwellist contacts. The whole damn thing is completely inaccessible, somehow.\n\nOut of all the people still working for The Foundation now, I think I feel the worst for the former [[[simulacrum-project-hub|SIMULACRUM PROJECT]]] team. Watching them literally pulling the plug on the people who were in Cipher City when 8300 hit... awful.\n\nI think I need to stop this trip. One more place to visit, and then I'm done.\n\n------\n\n++ BORING, OREGON\n+++++ FORMER CLASSIFICATION: ##blue|BRIAR##\n++++++ REEVALUATED DESIGNATION: ##green|NORMALIZED##\n\nI spent most of my career working with Groups of Interest. International relations wasn't really my thing in high school, but I guess that's what I ended up doing anyway. Researching GOIs, figuring out how to stop the bad GOIs, figuring out how to work with the cooperative GOIs, talking to whichever GOIs let us talk to them, etc. It was tiring sometimes, yeah, but it was also probably the most fulfilling job I could have had here. The SCP Foundation, as it was, was not always the most home-like place. Escaping that, and getting paid to do so from time to time, was a relief.\n\nOut of all the Groups, though, Wilson's Wildlife Solutions was probably the most important to me. They were something different entirely, something that tried to look at the confusing and unexplainable world around us, and instead of fighting back or locking up, they cared. All the Wilsons ever tried to do, from Tim to Faeowynn, was care for these creatures that \"conventional science\" couldn't explain. It was something I always thought was more admirable than our own work, in a way. I think I can get away with saying that now.\n\nSafe to say, then, that this was the nexus on the list I was the most frightened to visit. Not because the town itself would have vanished, or that the human population up and died, but rather the animals. Wilson's was the backbone of the Boring community, not just because of their permeation through every facet of the little town's world, but because of the animals. The life they brought, the uniqueness to the environment, the soul, their adorable faces... agh. Writing this is difficult, and even now I'm fighting back tears.\n\nI don't think the worst part was the critters that died right when SCP-8300 hit. Obviously, that's terrible, and seeing the graveyard with all the homemade markers the kids of the town made, that was bad. Worse, though, were the ones who didn't die immediately.\n\nWhat we've found throughout our exploration of SCP-8300’s aftermath is that the effect it has on an anomalous creature varies greatly. For some, it's an instant end; these are the entities we'd classify as purely anomalous. For a lot of Wilson's Critters, though, they simply possess anomalous components; organs, differentiations, abilities, etc. So when SCP-8300 happened, those parts of their bodies were rendered useless or obsolete, and in some cases, became an active detriment.\n\nRecovery to help all of the critters is ongoing, but Tim told me that they've had to put down at least 25% of the surviving population, for their own sake. I could barely hold myself together while standing in the middle of their main house, watching a volunteer caress a little dog with an ungloved hand, as the other slowly pushed down on an injection. Actually, no, I //couldn't// hold myself together, because I left immediately after and started sobbing on a park bench. It was awful, and it's only 2000 times worse for the people who actually raised and cared for these little guys.\n\nFaeowynn wouldn't even look me in the eye when I showed up.\n\nI am declaring an end to this exploratory report and will be requesting a significant period of time off afterward to recuperate. What we're doing here, it's important, but I can't do this. I might go back to some island somewhere, I might go visit my parents now that I've gotten a chance, but I can't be here right now. Sorry.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"backaroo\"]]\nHey Jay,\n\nYour request for time off has been approved. I know this is a hard time for you, as it is for all of us.

The Undersecretary General of the United Nations Global Occult Coalition sits in her chair at the front of the General Assembly's chambers, alone. The rest of the organizations are out of the chambers, on the yearly New-Years recess. All 108 seats are empty in front of DC Al Fine as she clutches her side, a sharp pain digging into her abdomen that has been present for the past 5 minutes. She has a solemn look on her face when an intern opens the doors to the Assembly -- which Al Fine had forgotten to lock on her yearly reflection of the events of the past 365 days -- and bursts inside. He is carrying a report.\n\nWhen he reaches Al Fine, through the pain, she can finally focus on his expression. He is excited, elated even, and has run down the central aisle to greet her. She raises her hand before he can speak.\n\n\"Why are you here?\"\n\nHe sputters out a barely coherent mess of words before collecting himself. \"Ma'am, this- sir? Ma'am? Listen, you asked not to be interrupted, but we're- we're getting reports worldwide, from member nations and other organizations, our own or otherwise. There's-\", he cuts himself off, gasping for breath.\n\nThe sharp pain shoots up into her chest, Al Fine's ribs aching with an indescribable weight. \"There's what?\"\n\nThe intern flips through the pages of his hastily collected report. \"Well, okay, it's going to sound hard to believe, but- and this really is insane- our reports indicate that anomalous people, places, things, events, //phenomena//, they're all-\"\n\nAl Fine raises her hand again, with a stutter and shake to the movement as the pain climbs up her side. She already knows what that report is going to say. Her face grimaces as she gestures for him to hand over the paper, which he does swiftly, almost tripping over his feet in excitement. Al Fine pulls the paper in for inspection, the pain now riding up the sides of her neck, her head barely holding up upon her shoulders. She is sweating as she looks at the list of missing people, missing nations, statistics, and glory-floating paragraphs. The pain has extended downwards now, piercing through her thigh.\n\nCringing from the pain, her expression softens to that of defeat. Her eyes sink down into the paper, the words of the report bringing no joy to the chamber of the General Assembly as she sighs, deeply. The intern speaks up, confused.\n\n\"Ma'am?\"\n\nShe slowly looks up at him.\n\n\"Sorry, ma'am, I'm just- you seem a lot less excited than I thought you would have been.\"\n\nAl Fine speaks, her voice cracking through the pain as it pierces her skull. \"Why would I be excited about this?\"\n\nThe intern raises his hands, in semi-protest and confusion. \"Why would you- Ms. Al Fine, you're reading the report, right? The anomalous is gone, all in an instant, just like that. The prime directive of our organization, it's- it's been fulfilled, like fate or something. Didn't we just //win//?\"\n\nHer expression doesn't change as she drops the paper, the intern looking at the multi-page report hitting the floor beside her feet. The pain courses through her brain, her blood, her veins, as Al Fine can feel her body quickly entering a state of shock. Before the Undersecretary General falls to the floor, unconscious, she mutters out:\n\n\"If... if you look at it like that, s- sure.

He didn't really know why this happened; he just returned from a regular field mission, a universe where appliances were the dominant species, when the Way suddenly burst with activity.\n\nAnd just like it had opened mere moments ago, once the stream of people ended, with a swift and crushing movement, the Eighth Archivist slammed into the Way, closing it.

Excluding the ones who completely dissipated, exploded, vanished, or otherwise ceased entirely to exist immediately, several of the remaining people we had contained were now just that: people. No more anomalous abilities to their name, it was obvious that like everything else we'd done after the Council decided that the museum was the best choice, we should let them go free.\n\nOf course, this raised a lot of questions regarding both process and morals. Some of our more dedicated, longtime Foundation loyalists figured that we couldn't just release them back to their families and lives and that the ethical consequences we'd have to hold ourselves to would be too much; we'd never be able to start The Foundation as a museum if we were gutted by our previous failures and indecencies.\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, we obviously needed to let them go. They were prisoners while they were with us, but at the very least, for some, there was just cause for it. Anomalies are anomalies, containment is containment, et cetera. But now, they'd been freed from the \"crimes\" -- to continue the prisoner metaphor -- that had landed them here in the first place.\n\nEven during their time in the Foundation, we -- I -- tried to help. The idea of Alpha-9 was an innocent one to start, the idea that the failures of an overzealous and uncaring Omega-7 program could be solved with down-to-earth, honest-to-god, humanity. Don't treat the anomalous people like objects, treat them like people. More like a soldier than a prisoner, which is itself still restrictive, sure, but at the very least it was better. Whether or not we failed at this idea is left up to historical interpretation, for the visitors of The Foundation to form judgment on. I have my opinion.\n\nEventually, though, the pro-containment loyalists were quelled, as reason shone through. It was going to be painful, and we were going to have to take a barbed responsibility for our actions. But Director Radu made a good point of it all: isn't that the point of this?\n\nSo that's what we did, and seeing as I am -- I //was// -- the Director of Alpha-9, I was responsible for the reintegration of our team with their families. It was...\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n//Iris Thompson, formerly SCP-105, stands outside a residence in Newark, New Jersey. Director of Alpha-9 Sophia Light stands next to her, holding Iris' hand as Light stares at the front door.//\n\n**S. Light:** You feel ready for this?\n\n//Iris raises her eyes from the pavement below her and looks to the front door; a small sign, reading \"THE THOMPSONS\" hangs underneath a small window, carved from a piece of oak. Iris inhales sharply, closes her eyes, and sighs.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah. Yeah, I think I am.\n\n//She looks over to Light.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** After all this time, though, do you think...\n\n**S. Light:** That they'll remember you?\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah. I mean, I was, what, 14 when you guys carted me away? And... amnesticized them, right?\n\n//Light's expression tightens with a hint of guilt.//\n\n**S. Light:** As far as I know, no. They were just informed you died. In hospice care.\n\n**I. Thompson:** Ah. Right. Because everyone thought I was insane, because I said I could reach through my Polaroids. Of course.\n\n**S. Light:** It was an effective cover story, if not a little harsh.\n\n**I. Thompson:** A little?\n\n**S. Light:** A lot.\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah.\n\n//A cool breeze flows by, shaking the snow-covered trees above the doorway. The sun glistened on the crystal-white snow surrounding the house, as Light and Thompson stare on. Thompson takes a step forward, then hesitates. Light raises an eyebrow.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** You know, when 8300 first happened, I was devastated, actually.\n\n**S. Light:** I remember. I was there with you when the wave hit.\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah, I just- for so long, my camera and me and my powers, they were my identity. That's what got me onto Alpha-9, kept me useful for so long, and gave me something special that nobody else had.\n\n**I. Thompson:** All of us were like that, right? Me, Alexei, Rainer, we... we were unique. So it felt bad when 8300 hit us because naturally, it would feel bad to lose that.\n\n**S. Light:** Sure.\n\n//Thompson turns around to face Light, her hand slipping out of hold.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** But a few days pass, and through all of the tears, confusion, and conversations about what would happen to all of us, I realized something.\n\n//Thompson points at Light.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** All those feelings of devastation, all that guilt and pain, that- that was because of you. It was all because of you, the Foundation, and- and the world you put us in! Locking us in boxes, reducing our identities to the powers that made us different from the rest of the world, //that// was what made me feel terrible. You-\n\n//Tears begin to well in Thompson's eyes. She stifles them back.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** //You// made our \"uniqueness\" the whole of our identity, so of course we felt bad when 8300 \"took it away\" from us, because- because we had nothing.\n\n//Light's expression remains still. Thompson sighs.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** We weren't people to you. I wasn't Iris G. Thompson to you. I was just an object, a tool, some... some kind of purpose without a person.\n\n//She stops for a moment, collecting herself.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** Once I had that realization, the idea that my anomaly wasn't anything more than an excuse to lock me away... that's when I was ready. Ready for this.\n\n//Thompson turns back to the door. Light walks up the single step to meet her, their gazes grossing paths as they look to each other with a bond of broken familiarity. There is guilt buried deep into Light's eyes.//\n\n**I. Thompson:** Sorry.\n\n**S. Light:** Don't apologize. You're right, in everything you said. You don't have to believe me, I have no right to ask that of you, but I agree. The things we did to you, Alexei, Rainer, and all the others; that's going to stick with me, at least, forever.\n\n//They begin to walk closer to the front door; step by step, moment by moment, the winter sun glistening down upon them.//\n\n**S. Light:** This is the least I can do.\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah.\n\n//They stop. The door is within a hand's reach, the doorbell positioned just to the side.//\n\n**S. Light:** I'm sorry, Iris. For everything.\n\n**I. Thompson:** I understand why it happened. And I understand you, more than any of the others. I think I'll still resent the Foundation, though, for a long, long time.\n\n**S. Light:** Fair enough. Now-\n\n//Light gestures to the doorbell.//\n\n**S. Light:** It's time.\n\n**I. Thompson:** It sure is.\n\n//Thompson rings the doorbell, her hand shakily lowering to her side after she does so. Both she and Light nervously shuffle in place for a few moments, before a click. The door slowly opens, the face of Janice Thompson, Iris' mother, peeking through.//\n\n**J. Thompson:** Hello? Who is-\n\n//When the door is fully open, Janice and Iris make eye contact. Light steps back as the two Thompsons examine each other for a moment, trying to understand the other. As Iris smiles slightly, Janice's mouth opens, her eyebrows raising.//\n\n**J. Thompson:** Oh my... Iris?\n\n//Tears well up in both of their eyes, as they stare for a moment, their confusion changing to a shaky smile, their expressions softening as a love shared only between parent and child flows between them. Before Janice can speak again, Iris collapses into her arms, their sobbing filling the quiet neighborhood as the two embrace tightly. They raise for a moment, staring each other in the eye, examining a face not seen in many years. Both can barely get out a word.//\n\n**J. Thompson:** I- Iris, is it-\n\n**I. Thompson:** Yeah Mom, it's- it's really me, I'm-\n\n//Their embrace falls together again, the tears flowing down their faces. The sound of hastened footsteps can be heard through the doorway before Iris' father Stewart enters the frame. He looks to his wife and daughter for a moment, up to Light -- who simply and softly smiles -- and back to Iris. His expression changes from surprise to ecstatic smile as he falls into the embrace, the sounds of the three Thompsons' sobbing enveloping and twisting together into a chorus of love and memory.//\n\n//Light looks to the three, tears welling up in her own eyes as she stifles them back. She sighs, a tear escaping her attempts at holding them down, as her phone begins to buzz. She takes it out, examining the incoming caller's name, \"TROY LAMENT <3\". After looking back to the Thompsons, who themselves buzz with excitement and love, Light picks up the phone, turns around with a lingering glance, and walks away.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n...it was the greatest thing I've done, in all my years of working for the Foundation.\n\n[[>]]\n//Sophia Light,//\n//Director of Contained Person's Reintegration,//\n//Former Director of Alpha-9, \"Last Hope\".//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[=]]\n//{{THE FOLLOWING IS A}}// //**{{MEMO}}**//\n++++++ //FROM THE JOINT DIRECTOR'S OFFICE OF//\n+ [[size 200%]]**THE FOUNDATION**[[/size]]\n++ //MUSEUM FOR ANOMALOUS HISTORY//\n------\n[[<]]\nHello, everyone! With the end of 2024 being here, we're happy to announce that this officially marks 1 year of The Foundation's successful operations. Throughout the overall tragedy that was SCP-8300, our organization has managed to pull itself from the ashes and rise to become the world's premier institute for the study of anomalous history, peoples, culture, and more.\n\nIn our first year of operations, the following achievements have been met.\n\n* We have fully converted 227 Foundation Facilities into museums for The Foundation, with several remaining facilities in remote locations such as Site-07 to be closed down within the next year.\n* An initial loss of personnel by about 25% (excluding the deceased, rest their souls) has been counteracted by a 45% increase in hiring post-opening, with many from the general populous interested in holding positions not requiring a Foundation background.\n* 90% of the remaining original collection of non-living anomalies has been converted into exhibits and moved to the appropriate locations.\n* We have paid monetary reparations to all formerly Contained Persons, specific amounts to be provided at request to the Accounting Department.\n* Despite some retracted deals with more reluctant governments at the \"threat\" of revealing state secrets, we have maintained the presently needed amount of funding from all former governmental allies.\n* Our insurance plan has been transferred from the now-defunct [[[goldbaker-reinz-hub|Goldbaker-Reinz Ltd.]]] to the non-anomalous Reinz, Ltd.\n* A \"Board of Directors\", composed of all department directors of The Foundation, has been established as our leadership body; rather than an elusive 13, we're a connected 47 and counting!\n\nOf course, despite all of these positives, it is at this moment that we must remind all members of staff that this achievement is that of a two-edged sword: for all the success we've had in integrating ourselves into the public, educating the previously-above-veil world about the fantastical worlds we hid behind closed doors for decades, and attempting to aid the damaged communities, we must consider that the road to this success was stemmed from pain.\n\nThrough the tireless efforts of the Human Resources Department, Internal Statistics Department, the Reintegration Program, the Ethics Committee, the Historical and Recordkeeping Departments, and several other facets of our museum, we have managed to finally compile a roughly accurate estimate for the losses incurred to the anomalous world as a result of SCP-8300.\n\n* 12 major anomalous species of intelligent life, including the Fae, Yeren, and Ortothans were wiped out completely; the historical state of their cultures being in jeopardy due to historical records and allies of these cultural groups being the only remnant.\n* 138 anomalous cultural groups, primarily composed of originally-human individuals, have suffered population losses within the critical range of 50% or higher; such groups include the Nälkä, the Church of the Broken God (specifically the Maxwellists, who suffered losses up to ~90%), and all 5 current branches of Fifthism.[[footnote]] Five-Star Publishing, Hollywood Network, The Fifth Army, The Central Fifthist Church of New Hampshire, and [[[interconstelation-man|Fifthist Bass, Pro, Bait and Surf]]]. [[/footnote]]\n* Almost all 108 members of the Global Occult Coalition have dissolved, with notable inclusions being the Servants of the Silicon Nornir, the World Parahealth Organization, and the Coca-Cola company.\n* All multiversal access in or out of our universe has been suspended, leaving several visitors from other universes such as non-anomalous Foundation personnel, the Black Queen, and other surviving individuals stranded here. Similarly, several of our own personnel have been considered lost to other universes, should they still exist.\n* As well, most Nexuses not present within what was known as \"baseline reality\" have vanished or been destroyed completely.\n* Several key politicians and public figures have died as a result of SCP-8300, or as an after-effect, leaving many governmental allies shaky on The Foundation's existence in a form of blame.\n* Public protests against The Foundation from denial groups, extremist members of the now-defunct Parawatch Forums, anti-religious groups, and other individuals who find the existence of our organization to be (as one man put it) \"wrong\", have hampered public image and has even led to damage in extreme cases.\n* Monetary reparations are not, in all cases, significant enough repayment towards former Contained Persons who suffered within the grasp of our organization, and have demanded further action.\n* A not-insignificant portion of our original collection of contained anomalies has still not been accounted for.\n\nSo, that is to say, there is still progress to be made.\n\nWe also have come to recognize that this transition has not been easy for everyone. The heavy loss of life, be it friends, family, animals, Fae, or otherwise has held a toll on everyone that is inevitably unavoidable within the halls of our museums. History is a fickle thing; though we construct and maintain monuments to hold it up, regale it, allow people to access it -- if but for a moment -- the fantasy we'd seen, the one we lived through? There will never be anything like it again.\n\nIt has come to pass, and for the outside world, that is easy -- a fantasy is just a fantasy. For us, though, it was life. Our purpose, our tenets, our point of being. We understand this struggle, and continue to allow for personnel -- whether or not you worked for the SCP Foundation before SCP-8300 arrived -- to take time off when they need to, travel wherever they have to go to reconcile with the losses, and be with the people you love.\n\nOver 100 years of the SCP Foundation and its cold, unfeeling grasp has come to a bitter end. It is over, though, and we look to the future. A future where humanity, despite the death of magic, can at least know and recognize what came before them. A museum for dinosaur bones allows you to wonder what life was like millions of years ago; The Foundation allows you to see what your world was like, now.\n\nIt will not be a perfect upcoming few years, but we will push on. To Show Cultures and People. To Share Celestial Powers. To Save Chronological Poignance. Our purpose changes, but we thank you for staying with us.\n\nThey will live on in the light.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[size 85%]]//This memo was penned by a joint effort within the Director's Board, primarily by Ethel Kursh (HR), Maria Jones (RD), and Director Radu.//[[/size]]\n\n------\n\n**THE FOUNDATION**\n//MUSEUM FOR ANOMALOUS HISTORY//\n[[size 85%]]Founded 2024.[[/size]]\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[=]]\nThank you for viewing our digital information package regarding The Foundation!
