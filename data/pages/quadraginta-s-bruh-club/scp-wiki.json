Whatever, when I was a lot younger and a lot less likeable than I am now. A friend of mine randomly sent me something called **SCP-173** (yes, I know, I'm another one of the myriad peeps who found SCP via the Peanut) and I remember it creeping me the hell out. [[size .3em]] It was the picture, seriously, that thing is creepy as [EXPLETIVE]] [[/size]] \n\nI had spent the next almost-decade (not doing the math, eff that) reading SCPs on and off until I decided to join. After that, I spent 4 months trying to get something published, and when I finally pulled out all the stops and got my skip published, I was floored. How floored? Like. Yamcha getting crushed by 300x gravity floored...\n\n...Eeeehhh, anyways, soooo, I like video games. A lot. Bit of an addict, really. My favourites include but are not limited to:\n\n* Persona 5. I never shut up about this in Site19. Ever.\n* Control. Same. \n* Bloodborne. Same.\n* Pokemon, Gen 5 and 7. \n* A lot more, too lazy to list, lmao \n\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab My SCPs]]\n\n\n* [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5842 |SCP-5842]]], my stop sign. This [EXPLETIVE] got featured in three youtube videos and is so far my most upvoted work. Also my personal least favourite. Eh, it happens. Life's weird like that. Originally started as something kinda stupid and Series 1-ish before I slowly learned that modern SCP is a lot different now. I'm slow like that. \n\n------\n\n* [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-4576 |SCP-4576]]], Prixors, the cactus. Just a cowboy cactus doing his thing, waving around his explosive infinite ammo revolver. Definitely my preferred SCP between the two I have. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Click here for Prixors' origin story. Do this **AFTER** you've read the SCP; spoilers are ahead.\" hide=\"-YEET\"]] \n\nOriginally started off a shitpost character that my BFF and I made when we messed around with RPG Maker VX. \nThe little guy who leap into the main character's arm and begged to be picked up and carried. OG Prixors just wanted his bodyguard job back from some random, non-descript asshole scarecrow. Needless to say, the SCP adaptation is far different, but still has echoes of the original.\n\nAlso, original Prixors was infinitely sillier and was completely overpowered. Also spoke in 1337 speek, and spoke in every language and human accent at the same time. When I tried turning this iteration of Prixors into an SCP, he got #rekt in drafts. Modern Prixors is definitely a better story to tell. However, OG Prixors will forever be missed. \n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n\n------\n\n* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5687 |SCP-5687]]] - The Interdimensional Bodega. A young man runs into a magical retail store that sells informaton and magazines from other universes and uses the knowledge to keep his sickly mother alive. \n\nThis is a collab between myself and [[*user chaucer345]], but I mostly attribute it to her, since she's the one who pitched most of the idea as well as had the overarching ambitious plan of turning the Wandsmen into a recognized GoI. I helped with general formatting and pitched in ideas here and there. \n\nShe said she wanted to do a collab one day, and I offered. We started this in December 2020 and finished it March 2021. It took a bit of time, but we pulled through. \n\n------\n\n* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5247 |SCP-5247]]] - Woeful, Wailing, Whistling Wistful Wind. It's a sapient gust of wind that speaks in song. Composing the song and finding a way to get it on paper without any formal musical training was certainly...challenging. \n\nAnywho, I consider this my SCP return to form. It's a Quad SCP with an alliteration name. Been a while. \n\n\n\n------\n\n* [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6600 |Spidercon]]] \nA collab I participated in, headed by [[*user celestekara]]. I'm super happy se invited me to this because it was a lot of fun to partake in. We procrastinated a buttload until the very end where we hauled ass. That last minute panic was the fun part :D \n\nAnywho, this was our 6k entry. It's about spiders. Go read it. \n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab My Tales]]\n\n\n* [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/the-word-serpent |The Word Serpent]]], my third Tale I actually published to the Wiki, however, it's my first successful one. I'll touch on the failures later, but for now, let me talk (type) about this one. I had a dream(ish, I'll explain later) about a serpent made of text that rose out of an ocean of text and spoke to me. Everything else after that is forgotten. I then had the idea of writing a Tale about this serpent... \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Spoiiillleeerss :3\" hide=\"-yeet\"]] \n...giving someone an apple of text. Something something sin something knowledge something, but the final product ended up being kinda different. \n\n\n\n[[/collapsible]] \n\n------\n\n\n\n------\n\n* [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/demoted-to-d-class |Demoted to D-Class]]]. Don't let the name fool you; this is no lolfoundation. I struggle with self-worth and self-hate and I decided to explore those feelings and turn it into a Tale. \n\nThis is also me taking [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/forum/t-381751 |Bright's Challenge]]], but in Tale form. \n\nI wrote this Tale is about...oh, an hour and a half? Two hours? I coldposted it right onto the site. Yep. It's a coldpost. And it's not dead on arrival. \n\nI...did it!  :o\n\n------\n\n* [[[http://www.scpwiki.com/a-bed-that-grows-arms-and-deals-drugs |A Bed That Grows Arms and Deals Drugs]]]. I...don't know what else to say about this. The name is...//**##red|completely##**// self explanatory. \n\nUm...it's for Jamcon. It's a poem. Lotta rhyming. Enjoy? :D \n\n------\n\n\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/demoted-to-d-class-part-2|Demoted to D-Class Part 2]]]: Sequel to Demoted to D-Class. This came from somewhere unpleasant. Next piece will be significantly sillier. Promise. \n\n\n------\n\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/unhuman-not-inhumane |Unhuman, Not Inhumane. ]]] \n\n[[*user BlueJones]] wrote a Tale. I liked it. I wrote a sequel to it. \n\n------\n\n* [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hersheys-chocolate-humanoid-gets-fucking-eaten|A Hershey’s Chocolate Humanoid Crawls Out of SCP-261 and 1v1s Some Poor Fuck]]] \n\n^^^\nSee above title. \n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Quotes of Note]]\n\n:o\n[[*user Chiifu]] \n\n------\n\n\"You got me emotionally attached to a floating, talking, telekinetic cactus.

Drafts and everything. \n\n\n\n--Life's strangenesses and plot twists can be difficult to predict accurately, but here are some general as well as generous guidelines for if I go quiet on site19 and/or the Wiki.--\n\n--If I go quiet for:--\n\n--1.) **1 week:** I'm likely just taking a break.--\n\n--2.) **1 month:** Taking an extended break.--\n\n--3.) **6 months:** I need time to myself.--\n\n--4.) **1 year:** Unlikely I'll be coming back.--\n\n--5.) **2 years:** Very likely that I'm not coming back.--\n\n--6.) **3 years and beyond:** I'm not coming back.-- \n\nThis section is now irrelevant. \n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab My Failures/Self-Deleted Works ]]\n\nOh, boy, last and most certainly least. My shit that failed. All of my shit that either bombed or I deleted for personal reasons. Mostly bombed. \n\nLet's start with the worst, shall we? \n\n* [[[http://kontainer.djkakt.us/ss:take-your-ship |My Stealing Solidarity Tale for CrenCon. ]]]\n\nThis is easily the worst thing I have ever written, SCP-wise, period. It's awful. It's garbage. If you're curious, read at your own risk. Note: 4k words worth of not-worth-it.\n\n[[*user ScarfDyedShadow]] recruited me and two others for the CrenCon. I wrote this Tale and it bombed. Bombed so hard, [[*user Djoric]] came by and wrote a shitton of tips on how to make it better. I tucked my tail between my legs and ditched my team after this embarassment. Honestly my lowest point on the Wiki. Didn't pick myself back up until Prixors. ScarfDyedShadow, on the off chance you find this and read it...I'm sorry. I know you said it was fine, but I know you loved Stealing Solidarity. Sorry I bombed so hard. I know it's been months by now, but I still never got that embarassing memory out of my head. Hope you're alright. \n\n------\n\n--* [[[http://kontainer.djkakt.us/let-s-unplug-scp-261 |Unplug SCP-261 for a snack. ]]]\n\nThis was an experiment to see if I could coldpost something and not have it disintegrate. It failed. Lmao. Some dude unplugs SCP-261 and fights a chocolate version of himself. Literal chocolate. Chocolate sludge pours out of the opening and gathers into a chocolate version of the dude. I did as much alliteration and bullshit dialogue as possible for this. -4 in like 20 minutes. I deleted it ahead of time to spare people the trouble lmao. --\nI re-uploaded this Tale. It lived. --//How the fuck//--\n\n\n------\n\n* [[[http://kontainer.djkakt.us/alliteration-abbey |Alliteration Abbey]]] \n\nThis one was actually succeeding, but...I admit it. I really wanted an Author Page, so I rushed something out the door and it didn't satisfy me at all in the slightest. So I self-deleted it and wrote The Word Serpent instead. THAT, I am satisfied with. THAT, I legitimately feel it earned me an Author Page. Not some shitpost SCP that was succeeding somehow. I might re-visit Alliteration Abbey in the future, but for now, I'm happy with it being here instead. Largely forgotten. \n\n------\n\n* [[[http://kontainer.djkakt.us/sigma:scp-0ps-j |SCP-0ps-J]]]\n\n**Sigh** \n\n-J about pinging 'ops' on irc. Got some pretty good feedback on it the moment I posted. Turns out saying the punchline ahead of time ruins a joke. I deleted it in like not even 10 minutes. I'll re-visit this one day, but for now, eh. Sit in my failures tab.  \n\n------\n\n* [[[http://kaktuskontainer.wikidot.com/scp-1277-rewrite |SCP-1277 Rewrite]]] Depression, poor time management, and loss of interest all led to a very mediocre rewrite. Got mixed reception on posting. I self-deleted out of shame. \n\nWasn't meant to be, I guess. \n\n------\n\n\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n\n[[tab Fan Art]] \n\n\nI'll have you know I didn't draw any of these...cuz I can't draw :D \n\n\n\n\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/quadraginta-s-bruh-club/image-1.jpg\n| caption= [[*user Kensing]] drew SCP-4576, aka Prixors.
