SCP-005-VN often rides SCP-005-VN-1, a sleigh pulled by 9 instances of //Rangifer tarandus// (Reindeers), which are hypothesized to be the source for the entity’s anomalous capability to travel in the air. \n\n**Addendum 005-VN.01:** History\n\nSCP-005-VN was observed multiple times and recognized as a cultural element by the public throughout history. About ten years ago, SCP-005-VN’s appearance changed to its current form; however, most of its anomalous properties remained the same. The Foundation has officially begun to contain this anomaly after these changes, with almost every attempt ending in vain. An overview of all interactions are summarized below:\n\n\n||~ Year ||~ Notable Events ||~ Reactive Measures ||\n|| 1500 || Initial discovery. || The anomaly was designated Person of Interest Level Alpha ||\n|| 1621 || Signs of SCP-005-VN’s anomalous properties were confirmed during its flight. || Documentations of SCP-005-VN were issued and added to the Foundation’s database. ||\n|| 1770 || SCP-005-VN was discovered by multiple civilians on Norwegian skies at 00:05, 24/12/1770, during a celebration. || The Foundation has issued a cover story of a comet flying by. ||\n|| 1773-1990 || The Foundation has carried out multiple projects to contain SCP-005-VN. However, all attempts failed due to technical difficulties, lack of equipment or lack of resources. || **Notes:** We couldn’t catch an old man due to not having enough money. Really? ~Dr. ███ ||\n|| 1991 || Due to various difficulties in containment, the O5 Council has decided that each year, one Site will be assigned this containment mission at SCP-005-VN’s time of appearance. || N/A ||\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote table4 tableb\"]]\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n**__{{Site-333 -- Interdepartmental Communications Log:}}__**\n{{23/12/2023 -- 11:03}}\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n* ##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##, Director;\n* ##green|**Leonora Morales**##, Wildlife Specialist;\n* ##a3c1ad|**Larry Cumbleton**##, Temporary Junior Researcher.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n##a3c1ad|**Larry Cumbleton**##: Erm, okay, but why do the O5s assign this for individual Sites?

The setup includes: A net made from reinforced metal alloy at the bottom of the chimney, as well as another similar net that would automatically be placed on top of the chimney when the anomaly was inside; a number of armed agents and a civilian female child as the bait. Below is the transcript of the event, which was recorded in the living room of the house:\n\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n\n**<<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>>**\n\n//SCP-005-VN and a Formula 1 vehicle were moving out of the chimney by transforming themselves into a liquid-like state in the same manner of a cartoon character moving out of small spaces.//\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** //[loud voice, not in a screaming way]// HO HO HO, Merry Christmas!\n\n**Bait:** Santa, is that you?\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Ho ho? My my, what do we have here? Have you been a good girl the whole year?\n\n**Bait:** Ah, it is Santa Claus! I have been so good for the whole year!\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** //[took a candy cane out of the pocket]// And the good ones shall be rewarded.\n\n**Bait:** Ah, //[used both hands to grab the candy and ate it]// Thank you, mister.\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Now then //[turned to the hallway leading to the bedrooms]//, do the others want my present also?\n\n//The group of agents moved out of the hallway one by one, carefully making a formation surrounding SCP-005-VN and covering the bait.//\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Ho? What is this? I like the enthusiasm, but shouldn’t you be lining up? I have a present for all of you, you know.\n\n**Alpha:** Guys.\n\n//The squad took out their electric-infused baton from their pocket, and changed into a defensive stance.//\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Ho ho. At Christmas, the nice ones shall be rewarded. //[took a candy cane from its pocket]// And the naughty ones //[gripped its hand tight, then proceeded to use the other hand and swiped from the hand holding the candy cane out, transforming it into a crowbar resembling a candy cane]// will be punished.\n\n**Alpha:** Charge!\n\n//The whole team marched forward, with the intention of hitting on unguarded positions on SCP-005-VN’s body, locking and paralyzing the anomaly. Instantly, SCP-005-VN used the crowbar and hit three out of four members on the head, with the remaining agent able to tase it on its thigh. SCP-005-VN seemed to be immune to this attack and began to turn its upper body around. The entity hit the crowbar on the last agent, but it was blocked by one of the team members.//\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Ho ho, very unanimous, I would say. Such virtues that are commendable for those were deemed naughty.\n\n//An agent standing behind SCP-005-VN intended to jump and made a headlock move. SCP-005-VN spinned and use the curved side of the crowbar to grab them on the neck, using it as a human whip and hit those nearby before throwing it into another agent, making them both unable to fight.//\n\n**Alpha:** Spread out. Move back to formation, then we will get him.\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** //[looked at the clock]// Maybe there is not that much time left for me.\n\n//When the team tried to launch themselves to SCP-005-VN again, the entity used an abnormal speed to grab and throw each member away using its crowbar, knocking them out for the next 30 seconds.//\n\n**SCP-005-VN:** Nightie night naughties. Better luck next year. //[turns to the bait and takes out a present]// And this is yours. Be a good girl next year, would ya?\n\n**<<END TRANSCRIPT>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:image-block\nname=http://scp-vn.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-vn/ready_to_fire.jpg|\ncaption= Image of a turret scouting for SCP-005-VN in one of the missions.|\nwidth=400px\n]]\n\n**Note:** The bait’s memory was erased and she was brought back to her family. Her gift was taken by the Foundation for research and was contained in a locker, although the present was deemed non-anomalous. The item inside the gift was a handmade stuffed reindeer.\n\n* Attempt 2 - Christmas 2009\n\nOn 24/12/2009, the Foundation was able to track the movement of SCP-005-VN through an intel from Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada that an unknown jet was flying above the city at approximately 10 PM. The Foundation has sent a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor fighter jet to this area to try to keep the anomaly under surveillance. Below is the transcript of the conversation between the pilot and the command center:\n\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n\n**<<BEGIN TRANSCRIPT>>**\n\n<10:55 (GMT-5)>\n\n**Ironbird:** Ironbird to Command. I have arrived at the designated point. Over.\n\n**Command:** Copy that. Try to scout the area, if you are lucky, he might still be there. Over.\n\n**Ironbird:** Roger that. Over.\n\n<11:05 (GMT-5)>\n\n**Ironbird:** Ironbird to Command. You sure this guy is still around here? Over.\n\n**Command:** Command here. Keep scouting for the next ten minutes, then fall back. Over.\n\n**Ironbird:** Roger that. Over.\n\n<11:08 (GMT-5)>\n\n**Ironbird:** Ironbird to Command. Found the guy. So what do we do now? Over.\n\n**Command:** Can you state the current situation? Over.\n\n**Ironbird:** Roger. He’s flying kinda low, about 5-10 meters above the ground and between houses. He’s moving quite fast, at a rate of a F1 car, but slow enough to move straight into the chimneys. I will lower my altitude. Over.\n\n**Commandr:** Alright, we will need you to-\n\n**Ironbird:** Shit. He spotted me. I repeat. The target has spotted me. I will begin chasing him. Over.\n\n**Command:** Copy. Try to remain in contact. Over.\n\n<11:15 (GMT-5)>\n\n**Ironbird:** Ironbird to Command. I have chased him for several hundred meters now. The target is capable of maintaining distance at max speed for an adequate amount of time. Requesting counter maneuvers. Over.\n\n**Command:** Copy that. We have requested backup, SCP-005-VN might win on speed, but his maximum traveling distance can be lower than us. Keep following him to test this theory. Over.\n\n**Ironbird:** Roger that. Over.\n\n<11:20 (GMT-5)>\n\n**Command:** Command to Ironbird. What’s the situation? Over.\n\n**Ironbird:** Flying toward a windy area, I think I’m somewhere near Northeast of Russia? No sign of the anomal- oh hang on. The target is speeding up and turning. I repeat, the target is speeding up and turning. He’s heading to a windless area. I don’t think I could follow up with that. Over.\n\n**Command:** Affirmative. //[long sigh]// You can retreat now. You have done your best. Over.\n\n**<<END TRANSCRIPT>>**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Note:** The hypothetical speed when SCP-005-VN was speeding up to get rid of Ironbird was believed to have reached Mach 2.5. This helped SCP-005-VN to be able to move out of the Foundation’s reach. Counter measures were being researched, while better types of fighter jets were on their way to being developed.\n\n* Attempt 3 - Christmas 2010\n\nOn 24/12/2010, the Foundation has deployed over 1000 helicopters worldwide to survey and follow SCP-005-VN after the entity begun to distribute gifts. At about 00:30 on 25/12/2010, SCP-005-VN was sighted at a rural area of northern Finland. Based on previous experiences, Foundation forces only followed the entity from a distance, as well as using a shooting device to attach a tracking signal on the entity’s vehicle instead of actively chasing it. \n\nAbout two hours after the tracking device was set up, the anomaly flew to the north of Europe and lost connection for thirty minutes before circled back into the city of Yakutsk, Sakha, Russia, and spent the next two hours traveling around all over Asia before heading back to the North Pole and disappearing for a moment. During Christmas night, SCP-005-VN traveled through each continent for two hours, then returned to the North Pole and vanished for half an hour before returning and repeating the whole process.\n\nThe Foundation finally lost sight of SCP-005-VN at a location between Norway and Greenland at around 6:00 (GMT 0). However, when closely examining the location where SCP-005-VN was last observed, the Foundation was unable to identify any notable features. Theoretically, SCP-005-VN has either teleported to another dimension or has simply destroyed the tracking device during the flight. Nevertheless, no proof has been found to back up a specific side of the above argument.\n\n**Addendum 005-VN.03:** \n\n[[div class=\"foundation snow\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ SCP-005-VN Containment Strategy Overview\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-vn.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-vn/hq__room.jpg|width=100%|align=center|caption=The meeting room of Site-333.

If we win, we win big.\n\n##green|**Leonora Morales##:** Or we’ll be living next to a dumpster fire.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: Can you just stop making fun of me and think of something better?\n\n##red|**Tony Catalano##**: Just look at all the efforts to contain this thing that got written down into those documents. The others have done it at least ten times more professionally than us. You think this damn place is able to do that also? Bullshit. \n\n##orange|**Noah Patel**##: Such a smooth brain you have, Vincent. Some have like several hundreds of people, and they are still unable to make a dent. Just compare that to us, even if we count the greenie beanie Larry here, it’s just five people.\n\n##green|**Leonora Morales##**: Whatever, let's stop the trash talking part for a second here. We do need a plan. So Vincent, how do you want to make it work?\n\n##blue|**Tony Catalano##**: Clearly we don’t have enough money to go to the Arctic, so I suggest we better catch him somewhere near us. A hundred percent he will have to move through here, just need a perfect timing, that’s all. \n\n##orange|**Noah Patel**##: But where can we find more people? There is not that much time left, you know.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: If we compare ourselves to them, ain’t other sites just have too many people so they all got noticed right away, right? Maybe the smaller the better in this case.\n\n##orange|**Noah Patel**##: That doesn’t help much at all. You want the five of us chasing ducks or something? Even the fastest fighter jet can’t catch up with the guy. Do you need me to borrow the sled from the nearby warehouse store to fasten the process of losing?\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: Noah, you fucking genius. If we can’t chase him, then make something to chase him better. Reindeer, sled, extra glue and magic. How hard could that be?\n\n##orange|**Noah Patel**##: Bro are you fucking serious right now?\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: Never better, Tony. Better check the budget to see how much they had sent us.\n\n##red|**Tony Catalano##:** Fucking hell.\n\n##orange|**Noah Patel**##: What?\n\n ##red|**Tony Catalano##:** 1000 bucks.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: Fucking hell.\n\n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n++ __PROJECT EARLY UNBOXING__\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scp-vn.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-vn/boardwalk_shop.jpg|caption= The beachfront store where the shopping for Site-333 was carried out – Atlantic City.]]\n\nThe project was launched on 23/12/2023 as a countermeasure against SCP-005-VN, which, according to some Site-333 staff members, was a “half-assed, total rush” attempt.

Even if I didn’t want to, this diet full of gingerbread would still sooner or later turn me into this.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: But you’re also dead, right? In 1978 due to kidney failure?\n\n##964B00|**SCP-005-VN##**: Spot on. It’s not a fake death or whatever.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: How the hell could you get back to Earth again?\n\n##964B00|**SCP-005-VN##**: Well, when the light from the other side was waving at me, a hand grabbed my shoulder and pulled me into a room, beside a bonfire, in the middle of a snowstorm. \n\n##green|**Leonora Morales**##: Let me guess.\n\n**Leonora & Tony & Vincent:** Santa!\n\n##green|**Leonora Morales**##: Woah, congratulations Vincent. You’re finally able to catch up with the gang.\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##**: Stop with your sarcasm. //[turning to SCP-005-VN]// Anyways, I still need you to make it clear why he chose you as the driver. Shouldn’t faith or a love for children be more important qualities for Santa? How could he choose a dead racer like you?\n\n##964B00|**SCP-005-VN##**: Well… He said he needed a true racing fellow to guarantee that all Christmas gifts will be given on time, and basically all candidates before me missed their appointments.\n\n##green|**Leonora Morales**##: Woah. So he values KPI over customer experience?\n\n##964B00|**SCP-005-VN##**: Yeah, guess what, Santa has deadlines too. One day, when I was sunbathing on there, he just tapped my shoulder and said “Hey, young man. You drive real smooth over there. I need you to do me a favor!” And then he told his elves to put the clothes on me, threw both his sledge and his responsibilities to me and vanished.\n\n##red|**Tony Catalano##**: In another way, the old lad was lazy as fuck, so he pushed his responsibilities to others.\n\n##964B00|**SCP-005-VN##**: It’s been ten years. Anyways, I’m fine with it.

Each year, the SCP Foundation will assign a Site in its database with the mission of forming a strategy to counter SCP-005-VN.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=http://scp-vn.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005-vn/peterson.jpg|\ncaption=A picture of SCP-005-VN in August 1978.|\nwidth=250px\n]]\n\nSite-333 is obliged to this mission in case of future assignments.\n\n**Description:** SCP-005-VN is Ronnie Peterson, a famous Swedish racer also formerly known as “SuperSwede”. SCP-005-VN is a Resurrection Entity[[footnote]]Resurrection Entities are human beings, animals or any organism capable of thoughts returning from a “forever afterlife” through anomalous means. The entities themselves are bound to resurrection with a problem to be solved, or a mission to be completed [...] In addition, they are given “blessings” from the world above, or more plainly speaking, anomalous properties. ~ Excerpt from \"Looking Up To The World Above: A Deep Research Into Resurrection.\", Sam Jones, PhD, SCP Foundation Journal of Parascience, Volume 286, Issue of April 1^^st^^ (2021), internal circulation.

SCP-005-VN-1’s paint depicts an instance of //Rangifer tarandus// (Reindeer) in a sprinting position on its front half, with its forelegs placing on the two front wheels and its rear legs pushing on the rear wheels, as well as a pair of antlers painted on its front wings.\n\nSCP-005-VN-1’s minimum speed equals the maximum speed of a normal Formula 1 car, and its maximum recorded speed exceeds Mach 2.5. SCP-005-VN-1 also has the ability to completely control its sound level, which prevents nearby civilians from being woken up during the nights that SCP-005-VN fulfills its obligations. It is theorized that SCP-005-VN-1 appeared as an effort to “catch up with modern trends”.\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"blockquote table4 tableb\"]]\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n**__{{Site-333 -- Interdepartmental Text-Based Communications Log:}}__**\n{{25/12/2023 -- 09:14}}\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n* ##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##, Director;\n* ##red|**Tony Catalano**##, Accounting & Tourism.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n##red|**Tony Catalano**##: After all, you still let SCP-005-VN escape.
