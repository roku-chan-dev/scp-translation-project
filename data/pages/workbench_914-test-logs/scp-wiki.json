If your log is rejected or doesn't adhere to the correct format, make sure to save a copy yourself if you want to try again.\n\n----\n\n++++ How to write a 914 test log:\n\nGuidelines for future entries can be found [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|here]]]. The FAQ is located at the bottom of [[[experiment-log-914-hub|this page]]].\n\nAll test logs should be written in the following form. Please include your researcher's name on all records, along with the date formatted in European standard and a list of the total number of items \"refined.\"\n\n> @@**Name:**@@\n> @@**Date:** DD/MM/YYYY@@\n> @@**Total Items:**@@\n> @@@@\n> @@**Input:**@@\n> @@**Setting:**@@\n> @@**Output:**@@\n\nIf you want to add a note to a log that has already been ported over, copy the number of the test log and the output/note before it into the following template:\n\n> @@**Suggested note for Test-XXXX**@@\n> @@[Section before suggested note]@@\n> @@[Your note]@@\n\n----\n\n++++ How this sandbox works:\n\n* [[*user Queerious]] (me) will regularly check this page, with support at the moment by [[*user Leveritas]], selecting logs that are of sufficient quality to add to the log and port them over.\n* Tests that fail to adhere to the proper format (date, etc.) will **not** be ported until fixed.\n* Ownership of content posted to the 914 log is retained by log curators as stewards over any content therein. As such, any authors contributing to the logs cede any future claims to said content to the collaboration log curator.\n\n----\n\n++++ Regarding 914's rules and guidelines:\n\nSCP-914 does not create or destroy matter, nor does it change anything on the atomic level. All outputs should contain all and only the matter included in the input. Some grandfathered entries break this rule, but new entries should never do so. We call this Conservation of Mass.\n\nDo note that in case you intent to break a [[[scp-914-experiment-log-guidelines|guideline]]] other than CoM, your test has to make up for it in quality.\n\n----\n\n++++ Regarding in-universe names:\n\nIt is generally seen as bad form to use other writers' characters without asking. Of course, the rules of the wiki do not prohibit this, but asking beforehand will never hurt anyone.\n\n+++++ If you're not comfortable with your in-universe name being used, politely request a change or come to me about it.\n\n----\n\n++++ Regarding professionalism in the logs\n\nSome of you might have noticed that I'm being harsher on notes and logs that I deem too LOLFoundation. To illustrate my point, I'm going to use an example from Part IV:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Half-Life 3?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar\n**Date:** 20/03/2019\n**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life” for PC\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.\n\n//Note: Jr. Researcher Redmar has requested reassignment. Granted. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nI actually edited the note. This is what it originally was:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Half Life 3? Original\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher Redmar\n**Date:** 20/03/2019\n**Total Items:** One CD containing “Half Life 2” for PC\n\n**Input:** Mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An extremely bright light consisting of [REDACTED] Lumens, which faded after 15 seconds, revealing a CD with the cover art resembling that of Half Life 2, but the 2 was replaced with 3. When inserted into a disk drive, an image with the word: “NOPE” appeared on screen, followed by a noise resembling human laughter.\n\n//Note: Fuck you, 914 - Jr. Researcher Redmar//\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThis is a very small difference, but it makes a world of difference in tone. The first entry works a lot better because it's not a researcher scolding the machine outright as a kid would. It's **implying** (read, show don't tell) that the researcher became so fed up with the result that he outright left. Wacky entries work well if it's against the cold professionalism that signifies the Foundation, and it **doesn't work** if it looks like the employees are acting just as unprofessional. Notes that enforce such excessive or LOLFoundation behaviour will be removed.\n\n----\n\n++++ Other things:\n\n* No more introduction notes. 914 is supposed to be unpredictable, and there’s only so many times it can turn handwriting into different handwriting or a drawing before you start predicting it.\n* Don't link outside of SCP wiki pages (crosslinks to other SCPs/Tales/GoI formats are ok). The reason for this are in-universe and out-of universe for different reasons:\n * In-universe, it's not professional conduct to link to anything outside Foundation intranet if that's not part of your job. On top of that, anyone can edit something like Wikipedia, and the Foundation would not rely on it as a reliable information source.\n * Out-of-universe, it's immersion breaking. Please write a short description of the concept instead. This way, it doesn't require the reader to read a Wikipedia article where a short description would have done the job.\n * The 914 Log adheres to the Sitewide AI Use Policies, and AI generated content is prohibited. If you are found to be in violation of the policy, you will be banned from contributing in the future.\n * [[*user Bonboneka]] is a regular and a veteran. If she tells you to change something, I will likely agree with her.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n+ Reopened once again!\n\n+++ Part XXI is up and running! Find your tests [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/experiment-log-914/offset/20 here].\n\n**Note: A number of tests were just posted, so go check it out!**\n\n----\n\n++++ Critique for your entries to the 914 Experiment Log, and other collaboration logs has a new home on the official [*https://discord.gg/scp SCP Wiki Discord], in the Writing Channels, in the #specialized-critique forum! This is a great place to get feedback on your collab log entry, alongside the crit provided here.\n\n-----\n\n++ Notes to Mod\n\n+++++ For when there are issues with the logs.\n\n**All approved entries have been ported! Thanks so much for the patience! -- QMod**\n\n**I think the date of some tests needs to be adjusted to fit in the log now if it is ported. Since its been more than a month now. The same counts for the other tests from October. However I feel some tests don't fit a new date since they are Halloween tests. Luckily, a changed date doesn't matter for me since mine isn't a Halloween test. - Bamibal** \n\n**I mean, people are gonna be reading these far into the future. They won't know how late we were. I think that it should be fine. - Ibarazaki**\n\n**No no true, tbh when I wrote this message I thought there were already November test ported as well. Still I can imagine that its kinda a vibekiller to have your Halloween test ported with being closer to Christmas than Halloween at this point. - Bamibal**\n\n**I said this under one of the test but I'll put it here as well. PLEASE if you are kinda new to the 914 test (after 2000) and you are not certain if something is allowed or not, please ask one of the older 914 members. (Boneka for example.) because I noticed that a lot of misinformation is spread on what is and isn't allowed. - Bamibal**\n\n**I have a question regarding SCP-914's input/output booths. How does it move an object into itself for refinement? Is there an entrance into 914's insides? How exactly does 914 move the objects out into the output booth? - DMilk**\n\n**You know, the point of all this testing is because we don't really know how 914 works to begin with. - Boneka**\n\n**Related question, but one that is probably more answerable. Are the booths airtight? Without the door. Basically, if you put a seal over the entrance, could you pull a vacuum with proper equipment? - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**I've found a minor issue in one of my tests, test 2031. It says \"D-3238, who inhaled gas accidentally, complained experience pain,\" which should be something like \"complained that he experienced pain in the chest.\" Thanks!! - DrIbarazaki**\n\n**So, are tests actually gonna get ported again or did Q basically forget about 914? At this rate we better would kept it closed after 2000 because this is not it. - Bamibal**\n\n\n> +++ QMod Note: Hey all, I wanted to take a second and apologize for my absence; the previous way we were organizing this was making things more difficult, and I am working on a system that will better empower tests being approved and ported more frequently. I just ask that you be patient with me, and trust that I am working on a resolution asap.\n\n**After five months of not touching the project //you// volunteered for (as is my understanding of the situation) I’m not sure organization is the problem, unless you mean your own personal task management system. While I understand that managing the logs can be overwhelming, it may be better to close the logs again or hand off the task to someone who can better keep on top of feedback and porting if you are not able to give this page the attention it needs. - comptech**\n\n**It would have to be a pretty generous \"ASAP\" considering that there are tests in here from last October and you've been plenty active on other parts of the wiki in that time frame. I want to cooperate on this project as much as I can, but I can only be so patient having already waited that long without a single port happening, or without you even so much as checking this page—especially considering that the bulk of actual feedback is being done by other users such as myself and Ibarazaki, so your main task is really just approving and porting tests, which should not be \"difficult\" by any means—at least not difficult enough to warrant a five months-long absence. - Boneka**\n\n**I have to admit, I do think that it would have been better to at least do this earlier. Waiting 5 months to tell is this does kind of feel rather annoying. At this point, I've almost been considering working towards joining staff for a chance to work on this... Also, to add onto Boneka's complaint, there are some tests already approved by Lev here, anyways. You've been active other places, and all you would have to do, in the case of those tests, would have been to add them. While I understand why you may have been inactive, it would have been better to at least get this notice earlier. - DrIbarazaki**\n\n-----\n\n++ New Entries\n\n+++++ Please put a separator between each test.\n\n-----\n\n**Name:** J.R. Evangeline Perry\n**Date:** 30/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One //Apple iPod Nano// \n\n//Note: Dr. Veritas finally took me off janitorial duty and allowed me to test again. - J.R. Perry//\n\n**Input:** One //Apple iPod Nano// \n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An unchanged //Apple iPod Nano//. When the device is being held and turned on, it shows the favourite music of the holder. However, when removing the device from D-5683, he showed immediate signs of distress and became very emotional; unable to listen to his favourite music, D-5683 started to sing some of the songs loudly to himself. This continued on for thirty minutes before D-5683 calmed down. Output was incinerated.\n\n//Note: It was an unusual experience hearing someone sing \"Call Me Maybe\" by Carly Rae Jepsen so loudly while crying. - J.R. Perry//\n\n**Short and sweet, but I think this works. I'll see what Bone/Lev thinks, but tentatively approved -- QMod**\n\n**I've changed it to Fine since the effect is not particularly complicated or extreme, but yes otherwise I think it's good. - Boneka**\n\n**Approved - Leveritas**\n-----\n**Name:** Dr. Oloko\n**Date:** 31/10/2024\n**Total Items:** One plastic pumpkin bucket, one jester costume, one Trick-Or-Trade //Pokémon// wrapper\n\n//Note: I don’t like giving out candy on Halloween, so I give out cards instead. They’re popular with the kids, right? - Dr. Oloko//\n\n**Input:** One plastic pumpkin bucket\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One block of plastic with a typical pumpkin face carved into it, one miniature bucket made from the excess plastic and filled with spray paint.\n\n**Input:** One jester costume\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Three smaller jester costumes, child-sized. When the cap is worn, the wearer gains an intricate knowledge of pranks and a desire to carry them out. Further testing has not been carried out due to needing children as test subjects. A D-Class with a small head was used to test the cap.\n\n**Input:** One Trick-or-Trade //Pokémon// wrapper\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One Pokémon card made of foil that depicts the Pumpkaboo Pokémon. The art of the Pumpkaboo is animated and there are no abilities listed, except for one called //PumpkaBOO!// that uses no energy. When the move is spoken aloud while someone holding the card, all people in a 2 meter radius see some manner of horrific image that varies by person affected, for up to 5 seconds. This includes the person using the move.\n\n//Note: I saw a bloody clown. Not the greatest experience… - Dr. Oloko//\n\n**Approved - Leveritas**\n\n-----\n\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 20/11/2024\n**Total Items:** Three small 20kW diesel generators\n\n**Input:** One generator\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One slightly smaller generator with the exhaust threaded and the fuel tank relabeled as an “H2O box.” Output cable was also replaced by an input cable. When plugged into a power supply and supplied with water, output started generating methane gas.\n\n**Input:** One generator\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One slightly smaller generator with a fuel tank relabeled as a “coolant reservoir”, a miniaturised cooling tower, five slots that could hold five standard size nuclear fuel pellets each, and slots for two 25.4 mm OD x 8 cm long nuclear control rods. When switched on, output produced 200 kW of power, but was a significant radiation hazard due to the lack of shielding. Switched off and sent to Facility-254 (Foundation nuclear waste repository for North America).\n\n**Input:** One generator\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One small fusion reactor of the stellator design, with a large amount of wires and other cables escaping out of openings in the casing. Fifteen power outlets of multiple known and unknown formats were scattered around the exterior, and one large switch was located on the exterior. Scans of the interior were inconclusive, and showed gravitational anomalies within. When switched on, around 256 kW of electricity was produced, but multiple gravitational anomalies were detected, although they appeared to be localised within the testing chamber. Testing halted after loss of gravitational force noticed throughout the testing chamber, and later readings showed that gravity within the chamber was ~0.73G. Gravitational force returned to baseline after 51 hours.\n\n//Note: Did SCP-914 just create a generator that eats gravity? How is that even possible? Is gravity a particle? Does this thing somehow absorb gravitational waves? What is going on here? - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**(Condensed addressed OOC notes.) - Boneka**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Researcher Joseph Carpenter\n**Date:** 28/11/2024\n**Total Items:** One //Raising Cane’s// receipt, one magnifying glass, one //X-ACTO// knife\n\n**Input**: One magnifying glass\n**Setting**: Fine\n**Output**: One visually unchanged magnifying glass. The magnifying glass now shows within it what lies 2 meters behind it. For example, a user can see themselves in the third person from behind. Trying to manipulate or obstruct the viewpoint in any way has been unsuccessful. The closer an object gets to the viewpoint, the more transparent it becomes. Getting too close will render said object completely invisible until it backs away. Output placed in anomalous storage.\n\n\n**Input**: One //X-ACTO// knife\n**Setting**: Fine\n**Output**: One visibly unchanged //X-ACTO// knife. D-441102 was given a piece of standard A4 (210 x 297 millimeters) paper and instructed to cut it. Over 6 hours, and with a confirmed analysis, D-441102 would cut the paper into 62,370 pieces and was monitored to perform an average of 3-5 cuts within the span of a second. She refused to take any breaks and appeared quite content. Upon completion, D-441102 reported that she had a good time and that she’d be happy to do similar tasks. 5 minutes after completion, she complained about intense cramping and severe muscle strain in her entire right arm, exhaustion, and was overall far less enthusiastic about further testing. Her cheerful nature during the test appears to be another trait of the output. Output placed in anomalous storage. \n\n\n**Input**: One //Raising Cane's// receipt\n**Setting**: Fine\n**Output**: One crisp, noticeably brighter //Raising Cane’s// receipt, with passionate descriptions of the purchased items written in cursive. The names of the items have been capitalized and also written in cursive. All codes and excess receipt data have been removed. The longer someone is in contact with the receipt, the more emotional they feel about //Raising Cane’s//, while reminiscing about false memories related to the restaurant. After holding the receipt for more than 10 minutes, D-91822 began crying tears of joy, claiming they could not wait to go back and order the same meal again, and that they were incredibly hungry. Output incinerated. \n\n\n//Note: For the record, I did NOT go rummaging through anyone’s trash, I politely asked MacLean if I could have it. - Researcher Joseph Carpenter//\n\n**(Critted off-sandbox, no further comments from me) - Boneka**\n\n-----\n**Name:** Guest Researcher Luck, Research Assistant Alice Jensen (documenting)\n**Date:** 05/12/2024\n**Total Items:** One introductory note printed on cardstock reading \"Greetings 914. I am Guest Researcher Luck, visiting briefly from Denmark to finish my thesis. As such, I hope that we may have an amicable working relationship, and to that end, I've brought a little gift for you. Please enjoy.\" One aluminium can of WD40 water displacement, one plastic tube of metal polish, and five bars of sterling silver weighing 10 grams each.\n\n//Note: Greetings everyone. I'm here on a brief visit to this facility as part of my exchange program while I finish my thesis. As such, I found it prudent to introduce myself to everyone involved, including a \"peace offering\" of sorts to 914. Along with the customary introduction note, of course. I will naturally be taking all needed precautions as outlined in the safety manual and thus use a D-class to retrieve all outputs. - Guest Researcher Luck//\n\n**Input:** The aforementioned note, water-displacement, tube of metal polish\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One note reading \"Hello Felicity\" with a cognitohazardous symbol, one small aluminium and plastic keychain resembling a rabbit's foot. D-76251 was instructed to retrieve the items from the output booth without incident. He was subsequently prompted to read the note aloud. Upon reading, Guest Researcher Luck verbally expressed confusion, stating, \"That’s not my name.\" She then removed the note from D-76251’s hand for personal inspection. Following her examination of the note, she collapsed with a murmur before experiencing a severe low-viscosity haemorrhaging from all facial orifices.\n\n**Addendum:** Chemical analysis later revealed the low viscosity was the quality of an anomalous liquid compound, consistent with the product of test output 914-0569 (\"Liquid bad luck\") being inexplicably mixed into the otherwise non-anomalous human blood. The blood itself has been tested and recorded. Every test has come back as a negative in terms of Guest Researcher Luck being the person of origin. Multiple test failures occurred during testing as a supposed result of mishandling by personnel, equipment failures, samples outright disappearing, returning inconclusive results, or becoming cross-contaminated. The keychain did not exhibit any anomalous properties and has been placed into storage.\n\n//Note: I'll be taking over the remaining tests while --Felicity-- Researcher Luck recovers in the medical bay. - Research Assistant Alice Jensen//\n\n**Input:** One bar of sterling silver\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One puddle of silver in a molten state, subsequently solidified, specked with flecks of green oxidised copper.\n\n**Input:** One bar of sterling silver\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One bar of pure silver with a weight of 9.25 grams, one cube of copper with a weight of 0.75 grams.\n\n//Note: Output consistent with alloy composition of input sterling silver. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Input:** One bar of sterling silver\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One small silver teaspoon. A series of symbols of unknown origin are engraved on the back of the handle. Translation is ongoing.\n\n**Input:** One bar of sterling silver\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A sculpture depicting two miniature silver cats seated adjacent to each other, with their tails forming a heart at the base. The eyes of the cats are dyed green, likely due to oxidised copper from the sterling alloy. Testing indicates that individuals in an approximately 3-meter radius of the sculpture experience an anomalous sensation of being judgmentally watched. This sensation is greatly intensified within the eyesight of the sculpture, with subjects reporting the eyes of the cats to be following them.\n\n//Note: It's almost a cute sculpture all things considered. If only the cats weren't so judgemental. The left one in particular reminds me of Researcher Luck. Something about the way her eyes bore into my soul. Output incinerated. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Input:** One bar of sterling silver\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A hammered silver four-leaf clover, with its stalk shaped to allow it to be worn as a ring. Subjects who wear the ring report a general feeling of good luck. However, controlled testing shows no statistically significant alteration in outcomes for the subject. Notably, Subject D-76251 experienced a substantial loss of speculative funds during multiple games of chance conducted as part of the testing, which involved Research Assistant Jensen and Security Officer Jacobs. \n\n//Note: I'm almost disappointed. A test on Very Fine and it's just a mild cognitohazard... Either we should count our blessings in that it wasn't a repeat of --Felicity's-- Guest Researcher Luck's test, or there are other properties than discovered in our initial tests. Either way, hopefully --Felicity-- Guest Researcher Luck will recover soon. Until then, I'll continue the scheduled tests for the upcoming days. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Addendum:** Approximately one week following her collapse, Guest Researcher Luck regained consciousness. She exhibited symptoms of significant dissociative amnesia, having no recollection of her prior identity, activities, or involvement with the research. Upon regaining awareness, she identified herself as “Felicity,” exhibited no signs of distress, and displayed an unusually upbeat and carefree demeanour. A psychological assessment is pending to determine any long-term cognitive or behavioural changes. The first attempt at a blood draw after her waking up resulted in the inadvertent deletion of all prior instances of Guest Researcher Luck's medical records. New records have been requested, but as of writing, they have not been re-acquired.\n\n//Note: As previously stated I'll continue the scheduled tests while --Felicity-- Guest Researcher Luck recovers. Should that happen at all. There might also have been more to that note than initially met the eye. I keep wanting to call her Felicity instead of --Felicity-- Luck... - Research Assistant Alice Jensen//\n\n**(Condensed addressed OOC notes.) - Boneka**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Intern Lacte\n**Date:** 05/12/2024\n**Total Items:** One copy of the Foundation Personnel Handbook (2023 Edition) one copy of Intern Lacte's 3-page will\n\n**Input:** Foundation Personnel Handbook\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 914 Employee Manual, 2024 Edition. This has not yet been created by the Foundation. Output contains advice on the maintainment of SCP-914 and proper testing procedure. --No detected abnormalities or any unusual properties.-- Continued interaction with output leads to the handler gaining a obsessive focus on \"feeding\" themselves to SCP-914. Effect increases in intensity over the course of 7-9 days in which the subject attempts to either interact with SCP-914 or plan for \"feeding\" themselves to it. The effect is able to be temporarily reversed with Class-C amnestic treatment, however, it resurfaces every 3-5 days. Output incinerated.\n\n**Input:** Intern Lacte's will\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One standard Foundation formatted file regarding a potential link between being an employee at the SCP Foundation and the retrocasual alteration of a person's name. Output appears to have greater research, study, and experimentation cited than the only known official Foundation investigation into this phenomenon. Output sent to the Department of Review for the re-analysis of phenomenon. \n\n//Note: I am safe and fine despite any rumours regarding me and Very Fine. Regular amnestic treatment will suck but hopefully this effect will fade soon and I won't develop liver cancer. - Intern Lacte//\n\n//Note: Our medical staff will certainly be kept sharp on the procedures of administering amnestics. Here's hoping the side-effects will be mild in your case, Lacte. - Research Assistant Alice Jensen//\n\n**(Condensed addressed OOC notes.) - Boneka**\n\n----\n\n**Name:** Research Assistant Alice Jensen\n**Date:** 07/12/2024\n**Total Items:** --Five-- Four red clay bricks each with dimensions of 190mm x 90mm x 90mm.\n\n**Input:** One brick\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Small chunks of crushed brick in a large pile of brick dust.\n\n**Input:** One brick\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One poorly fired uneven red clay brick. Output began crumbling at the edges when handled. \n\n**Input:** One brick\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two hollow red clay bricks. Mass of the output is consistent with the mass of the input.\n\n**Input:** One brick\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unaltered brick. Personnel belonging to one or more minority groups report a greatly increased sense of confidence in both themselves and their community and that the brick has a very satisfying heft to it when held. After approximately 10 seconds of exposure to these effects, a strong urge to fight any perceived injustice is induced in the subject. This urge will exponentially increase in strength until the subject violently uses the brick against one such perceived injustice. D-76251 was successfully restrained with minimal injuries to security personnel, though he did manage to strike Research Assistant Jensen with the thrown brick as she was evacuating the test chamber.\n\n//Note: Testing for Very Fine was cancelled. 914 seems to be in a somewhat violent mood today, so I'd rather not risk it. I'll get some painkillers in the meantime. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**(Condensed addressed OOC notes.) -Boneka**\n\n----\n**Name:** Research Assistant Alice Jensen\n**Date:** 08/12/2024\n**Total Items:** One box of 10 plastic //Tom and Jerry// cartoon-themed Christmas baubles\n\n**Input:** Two Christmas baubles\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Shards of coloured plastic.\n\n**Input:** Two Christmas baubles\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A small plastic cube containing liquid dye. Output shattered on retrieval by D-Class as the cube's walls were exceptionally thin. D-76251 was treated for minor lacerations to the palm of his left hand.\n\n**Input:** Two Christmas baubles\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two Christmas ornaments in the shape of characters from the //Tom and Jerry// cartoon.\n\n//Note: I'd personally consider this a downgrade. At least the baubles weren't as obtrusive to the eye as these are. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Input:** Two Christmas baubles\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One larger Christmas bauble with a tasteful white and gold pattern. When output is hung on a tree, viewers report getting different holiday-themed songs stuck in their heads. Songs are not limited to those surrounding Christmas. All effects cease after output is removed from the tree.\n\n//Note: We did indeed test it on trees other than those ordinarily used for Christmas trees. The output works on all of them. Even that half-dead dwarf palm from the cafeteria. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Input:** Two Christmas baubles\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --One M1 fragmentation grenade-- One plastic model of an M1 fragmentation grenade with an anomalous effect that causes personnel not familiar with explosives to perceive it as a real grenade. Upon the opening of the output booth, Research Assistant Jensen immediately ordered the evacuation of Research Cell 109-B and adjacent rooms. EOD qualified personnel were called in, and a close inspection via remote drone revealed the non-explosive nature of the output. \n\n//Note: In my defence, it was a quite realistic model of a grenade. And better safe than sorry when it's 914. It does strike me though. Why did 914 go from baubles to a grenade? What's the connection between the two? - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Addendum:** A loud pop was heard when the output was incinerated. It is hypothesised that ambient moisture of the input chamber had been turned into hydrogen gas contained inside the model grenade. No damage was reported to the incinerator.\n\n**Condensed addressed OOC notes. Last test may only warrant a Fine setting, not VF. Not sure if this one is particularly interesting enough, will leave it up for second opinions. - Boneka**\n\n**I kinda agree that it's right in the middle of Fine-VF, but I think that it could work as a VF. I say it can stay. - DrIbarazaki**\n\n------\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher A. Metanoia\n**Date:** 11/12/2024\n**Total Items:** Four pocket watches, with components removed in order to render them non-functional\n\n//Note: Having analysed the events of previous testing entries, the watches have been rendered non-functional beforehand in order to reduce the likelihood of generating temporal anomalies. - J.R. A. Metanoia//\n\n**Input:** One aforementioned pocket watch.\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One flip clock constructed entirely from brass, non-functional due to several gears in its internal mechanisms being missing.\n\n**Input:** One aforementioned pocket watch.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One analogue wristwatch, non-functional due to the glass that would typically protect its face being entirely made out of brass, leaving the time unreadable.\n\n**Input:** One aforementioned pocket watch.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One \"digital\" wristwatch, made out of brass materials. Display reads 16:05, identical to the time displayed on the input, but cannot be modified due to its construction involving no electromechanical components - the numbers are embossed onto a flat plane.\n\n**Input:** One aforementioned pocket watch.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One penlight, with its lens broken. Upon D-Class retrieving the output from the booth, Jr. Researcher A. Metanoia immediately snatched it out of their hands, placing it in her pocket and indicating disapproval with the output.\n\n//Note: 914 does not have a history of producing outputs that have no thematic link with their inputs - and the only thematic link between a pocket watch and a penlight is that both are used as focus tools in hypnotic inductions. The risk of a D-Class possessing such a tool, especially with a Very Fine output, was something I considered greater than the risk of handling said object. - J.R. A. Metanoia//\n\n//Note: Manually taking a pulse requires a watch as well. Penlights also have use during medical checkups. With --Felicity-- luck that's the connection between the two rather than hypnotic inductions. - Research Assistant Jensen//\n\n**Addendum:** Further testing indicated that, while the lens itself was broken, an anomalous internal mechanism allowed it to emit light despite a lack of bulb to do so. Personnel who were directly exposed to the light (reflected light and exposure through video feeds proved ineffective) were afflicted with a compulsion to fulfill commands given to them, regardless of the origin; interviews with the subjects after the fact indicated that they held no memory of the activities they were compelled to perform. The strength of the compulsion scales with the length of exposure and the mental fortitude of the subject.\n\n//Note: Unfortunately, R.A. Jensen, it would seem the optimistic connection was not the correct one in this instance. Output incinerated - I am inclined to believe that having such an object, even in anomalous storage, would pose too great of a security risk. I, for one, do not wish to wake up one day with another person's blood on my hands. - J.R. A. Metanoia//\n\n//Note: Alas. And a wise choice. - R.A. Jensen//\n\n**Sorry, I know it's been a second since this test was submitted, but looking at it now after going over the entire sandbox gives me some fresh perspectives. My main thing is I think if the attending researcher believed the VF output to be that dangerous, it wouldn't have been very smart to put it in their own pocket, considering it just came out of 914. The output also being a hypnosis device as expected is indeed dangerous but kind of too straightforward? I think it would make a much more interesting test if the effect turned out to be something else entirely. Although I'm not super pressed over this and would probably still approve the entry as-is. - Boneka**\n\n-----\n\n**Name:** Medical Resident Ibarazaki\n**Date:** 18/12/2024\n**Total Items:** Three 7x7x7cm lead cubes, three 7x7x7cm bismuth cubes\n\n//Note: While the inputs themselves are not likely to glean any new information, the difference is in the method of how the test is being performed. One of the cubes will be placed within the input booth, while another of the other type will be placed at the same location within the output booth. I’ll also be starting at Fine, to see if perhaps the role of each setting will be changed. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One lead cube (input), one bismuth cube (output)\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One cube of lead-bismuth eutectic (LBE), of around twice the expected density, with all material contained within the same area as the bismuth cube placed in the output. Output was stable despite the extremely high density for the substance.\n\n**Input:** One bismuth cube (input), one lead cube (output)\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One 7x7x3.5cm block of lead and one 7x7x3.5cm block of bismuth, within the original location of the lead cube. When disturbed, blocks rapidly expanded to their original size of 7x7x7cm.\n\n**Input:** One lead cube (input), one bismuth cube (output)\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** A large explosion of superheated bismuth and lead, with both lead and bismuth shrapnel flying out of the output chamber. The area where the bismuth cube was originally placed was found to contain a pool of lead slag mixed with small amounts of bismuth, and amounts of both materials were found in Testing Chamber 109-B’s air. It is currently theorised that whatever bound the previous outputs together did not apply on the Coarse setting. Further testing, if attempted, is discouraged from using the Coarse and Rough settings. \n\n//Entry into the testing chamber is discouraged for today without proper PPE, at least until we clear the room of heavy metals. We also have to get the slag off the floor of the output chamber before we can test again. Testing should be open tomorrow! - R. Ibarazaki// \n\n**(Condensed OOC notes. Reviewing this again now, I think I'm going to have to turn this one down unless more information is provided. It appears these results involve the superimposing of each item over each other somehow, but there's no reason that this can't be done with testing the conventional way, and though the method is novel, the results aren't interesting enough to warrant it. I'd probably allow it if you want to do a follow-up test that goes further into this method, but you'd have to be cautious to not set any new major precedents in the process. - Boneka**\n\n**That was the original intent; a second instalment where this was shown to cause undue wear to SCP-914. This was meant to prevent the creation of any new precedents, and also for, y'know, content.

A few of the cuts were a bit difficult, but it works perfectly (except for the left window, which gets stuck sometimes). - Dr. Campton Blue//\n\n**Input:** One 2009 //Toyota Corolla// (fully disassembled, 32017 parts), one //Toyota Corolla// assembly manual\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One miniature LGM-3 Minuteman nuclear warhead (fully disassembled, 64013 parts), one manual on how to build a scaled-down LGM-3 Minuteman nuclear warhead from parts. The warhead was determined to have the same mass as the original car.\n\n//Note: Obviously, not doing this, but sent the instructions to a friend of mine at the Foundation (working in site nuke design) and apparently this would actually **work**. Scary stuff. Going to kill two birds with one stone and see if putting this stuff through again will make it work. - Dr. Campton Blue//\n\n**Input:** One miniature LGM-3 Minuteman nuclear warhead (fully disassembled, 64013 parts, output from previous test), one //Toyota Corolla// assembly manual\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A modified 2009 //Toyota Corolla// (fully disassembled) with //Sonic the Hedgehog//-themed cosmetics permanently attached to several pieces (such as the rear-view mirrors and cup holders) as well as a //Sonic the Hedgehog// paint job and a nonstandard engine that ran on a miniaturized antimatter reactor. A manual was found in the glovebox with instructions on how to maintain and build the car from base parts, although many of the instructions on how to manufacture the parts themselves were rendered illegible due to severe motor oil stains. \n\n**Addendum:** The car was assembled and brought out to a cleared area in a nearby uninhabited zone. A D-Class with an implanted anomalous tracker was loaded into the car and instructed to begin driving. The moment the accelerator pedal was pressed, a loud shockwave was heard, and the car appeared to vanish. Analysis of tracker data shows that the D-Class immediately accelerated to 30 km/s. Later analysis of satellite data collated from multiple databases suggests that a debris field in the expected location of the car is currently in orbit around the Sun. Disinformation has been disseminated regarding a pulse explosion propulsion system and respective damage has been incurred to the launch area.\n\n//Note: Requesting permission to send that manual off to RAISA to see if they can extract the full instructions for making another one of these.

Cassette appears to run backwards when played, with time counter decreasing instead of increasing. Testing the output has been inconclusive—all D-Class provided were noted to be in excellent physical health prior to viewing. No changes noted after workout routine was performed.\n\n//Note: There is some debate going on around the lab whether every D-Class we selected just happened to look like fitness models, or if the routine retroactively gave them all 'rock hard abs'. We've devised two ways to test this: We'll specifically request a heavyset D-Class from offsite. If we get another American Gladiator, I'll cancel the viewing to prevent the tape from having an effect. -Dr. Lombardi//\n\n**Addendum:** Pre-testing evaluation of the additional D-Class revealed well-developed abdominal muscles consistent with 90 days of intensive training. The order to cancel the workout was overridden by Agent Hault of the Temporal Anomalies department. Output confiscated following testing.\n\n//Note: Another predestination paradox?

The end goal for this test is to obtain a robot capable of scoring in all of the ways described by the manual. For those not aware, FRC is a high school level robotics competition that I have decided is a good benchmark for 914's understanding, due to its design. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**Input:** A game manuals describing the 2025 FRC game //REEFSCAPE//, six 2.5cm x 5cm x .6m square aluminum tubes, .9m 12awg copper wire, six steel pipes, one lead acid battery, one RoboRIO, twelve //Kraken// motors, 20 //Neo// motors, one robot radio, 24 cubic cm rubber, one .3m x .3m Lexan sheet.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A large robot fully made of intricate clockwork parts. It seems to have no electrical components and deeper internal scans have shown that some gears approach the size of ten atoms in diameter. All provided materials have been used inside of the construction, with rubber notably being used for precision flexion mechanisms. One game manual describing the \"1850 FCC game //TICK TOCK//\", with nonsensical rules such as:\n\n|| **R103 ##green|^^*^^MECHANISM playback rate limit##** || Your MECHANISM must move through time at the global standard rate. ||\n|| **R105 ##blue|MECHANISM DRIVE POWER limit##** ||  Your MECHANISM may not use gravity-powered PROPULSION to move through space at more than .1 m/s/s. ||\n\nNotably, the aforementioned robot breaks several of the robot construction rules in the produced manual.\n\n//For those wondering, rules are colored Green if they are implemented every year and Blue if they are not. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**Input:** Previously outputted robot, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A large lattice of modular robotic cubes, showing rudimentary intelligence and a proficiency for learning FRC games. One manual describing how to use said robot. However, the outputted robot breaks several rules of the //REEFSCAPE// game, including R101, 105, 202, 301, 401 and other various rules regarding bumpers, 501, 502, 504, 506, 601 and other various rules regarding batteries, 613, 614 and other various rules regarding electronics and wiring, and 701 and other rules regarding control systems.\n\n**Input:** Previously outputted robot, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A large robot, a manual on how to use said robot. No rules were violated upon primary inspection. However, when activated, the robot was incapable of scoring coral on the top bar or depositing algae into the net.\n\n**Input:** Previously outputted robot, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** An overly large shredder that involved various impractical components such as a flamethrower, acid tank (analysis suggests that the acid present was distilled from the provided battery), and pulper. The shredder was already activated with the game manual inside the input slot.\n\n//Note: Me too, 914, me too. I think I'll change to Very Fine to take advantage of some of the more esoteric aspects of 914. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**Input:** Previous output shredder, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual, one note of encouragement from Dr. Compton Blue.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A floating chrome-colored orb and one manual on how to operate it. Scans of the orb shows that no rules have been violated despite subjective assessments, and flight has been achieved through an anomalous electromagnetic manipulator providing upwards thrust. It appears to try to score through a claw, however the claw is too small in diameter to pick up algae and too large in diameter to hold on to the cage, making some kinds of scoring impossible.\n\n**Input:** Previous output robot, previous waste cube, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual, one note of encouragement\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --A fully functional robot-- A large inanimate cube of indeterminate material that makes observers believe that the cube is a fully functional robot that has won whatever competition or test it is currently participating in.\n\n**I feel like this one could be expanded on much much more. That description is simply too vague for a VF test, especially considering you could probably do something amusing with the output. - Boneka**\n\n**Input:** Previously outputted --robot-- cube, one //REEFSCAPE// game manual, one note of encouragement from Dr. Compton Blue.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An unstable construction constituting all the previous mass homogenized into one unstable alloy, which appeared to explode with significant force, sufficient to embed the fragments several inches into the wall of the testing area. Video evidence suggests the original construction was in the shape of a fist with the middle finger extended, facing up. No personnel were injured; however, testing was concluded due to safety concerns.\n\n//Note: Conclusion, don't force stuff. Especially when 914 gets cranky. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**Condensed addressed OOC notes. I think it'd be best for you to nix the last entry and focus on expanding the one before it.

Has the ability to respond to basic conversation, though it doesn't appear to properly be sapient. It also is able to still transform into the alternate truck mode, though the shift is much more complicated than the original toy. It still has an on/off switch, and switching it to \"off\" still deactivates the figure. However, there is nowhere to install or change batteries or other power sources.\n\n//Note: All outputs are to be placed inside storage. - Dr. Evening//\n\n**Condensed addressed OOC notes. I think I'll have to reject this one unfortunately because it's not as interesting.

I specifically chose sand because, well, it’s pretty boring and cheap. Not much you can do with sand, but that’s the point. Also, we couldn't fill SCP-914 for the last test, as I could only get 500 bags. - R.

Bag disposed of offsite. \n\n**Input:** 140 sandbags\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One large glass cube, with what appears to be a large circuit board embedded within the centre of it. Attempts are being made to remove the circuit for analysis.\n\n**Addendum:** Circuit board was recovered with acceptable damage. Further analysis shows that the transistors, as well as all other components, were constructed with extreme precision, with transistors the size of those achievable with a 1.2nm die shrink. However, the circuitry was made entirely from silicon metal with none of the additional processes needed for a proper circuit used, making it useless as an electronic device. The backing material was made of HDPE from the sandbags.\n\n**Been a while since I wrote one of these! Sorry if I make any mistakes, but I think that factually it should be good! I should mention that quartz is oxygen and silicon so that's where I got the silicon for the circuit board. As usual, I wrote this at midnight, so I'll read any crit tomorrow.

I'm improving! - Ibarazaki**\n\n-----\n**Name:** Researcher Snapdragon, Intern Raven\n**Date:** 31/01/25\n**Total Items:** One magnifying glass, one hand-mirror, one Microscope, and one pair of spectacles.\n\n//Note: The most interesting outputs seem to come from when all the inputs follow a theme of some sort. I am making sure not to expect anything specific coming from the output, since doing so seems to prompt 914 into creating an object to subvert those expectations. - Researcher Snapdragon//\n\n**Input:** One microscope, one pair of spectacles.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pair of noticeably thicker spectacles. Testing with D-Class revealed that focusing on an object while wearing the output for more than ten continuous seconds will cause every visual detail of the object to be projected into the wearer's mind with perfect accuracy. This includes internal components and details normally impossible to view with the naked eye, and may cause low-to-severe migraines if a sufficiently complicated object is observed. A D-Class was instructed to focus on SCP-914 while wearing the output, and promptly expired from sensory overload when the effect triggered.\n\n**I assume that the microscope in question is a compound microscope, in which case the output only being thicker glasses would likely be a violation of CoM. - Boneka**\n\n**Input:** One hand-Mirror, one magnifying glass.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:**  A perfectly circular pane of opaque glass, set within an ornate metal frame. When placed against a flat surface, the glass will change to a view from the other side of the object it is placed against. When placed against a wall, the glass displayed a view from the adjacent room, as if looking through a window. Testing has revealed no upper limit to the distance the output can be from other side of the object it is placed against.\n\n//Note: We put it on the ground and got a view of the Earth's mantle. Very interesting seeing magma up close and personal. - Researcher Snapdragon//\n\n**Date formatting still needs to be corrected to DD/MM/YYYY.

Due to the low energy-transfer rate of the wood, the output functioned as an overall subpar hammer. \n\n**Input:** One hammer\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One hammer that disassembles anything it hits, similar to the Coarse function of 914. Objects hit with the output will disassemble more/less based on the force applied. When tested on a 20cm block of steel, the cube split into eight equally-sized pieces. When tested on an action figure, every articulate and internal part was separated without damage.\n\n//Note: We should give this to the maintenance crew! - Intern Raven//\n\n//Note: I put it in a box filled with cotton balls so it can't disassemble the whole anomalous containment wing. I'd say the same thing as Raven, but it'd be a nightmare if someone dropped it on their foot or something. - Researcher Snapdragon//\n\n**Input:** One hammer\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged claw hammer. When retrieved by D-Class and swung against a pre-prepared sheet of steel, a circular portal with an approximate diameter of 1 meter was formed around the impacted area, with no visible damage to the sheet. Said portal led to a pocket dimension of indeterminate size, where objects may be stored. When an individual thinks of an object stored inside while reaching into the portal, said object will appear in the individual's hand. Portals may be closed by either opening a new portal with the output, or hitting the affected area with the output a second time.\n\n//Note: It's a hammer that leads to hammer space. I'll put it in anomalous storage once I stop laughing. - Researcher Snapdragon//\n\n//Note: Maybe we could use this to store the more benign stuff in the storage wing? - Intern Raven//\n\n**Condensed addressed OOC notes. Last test I feel like is a pretty major direct improvement. It has the potential to be interesting, but I think it'd be nice if you could add a trait that makes it so that it's not just infinite convenience storage.

This means that any noticeable change will be caused by SCP-914. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Input:** One atomic clock\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One very large precision scale. Despite being constructed from an atomic clock, it worked to a level where it followed most standards.\n\n**Input:** One atomic clock\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One pendulum clock, constructed from components of the atomic clock. Appears to measure time in the antiquated unit of time known as a moment (1/40th of an hour), albeit to extreme precision. The clock also appears to be a perpetual motion machine.\n\n**Input:** One atomic clock\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One atomic clock. The caesium used oscillated at 18,385,263,540 Hz, twice the speed of the regular 9,192,631,770 Hz, causing the clock to run twice as quickly. As caesium is know to consistently oscillate at 9,192,631,770 Hz, and as SCP-914 is not known to directly influence atoms, it is hypothesised that the atoms are experiencing time at half the speed as the rest of the world, and as such are perceived as oscillating twice as quickly.\n\n//Note: Well, that's... Interesting. I guess SCP-914 can affect time. Although I guess we're not sure if this is relativity related, or something else. - R. Ibarazaki//\n\n**Another midnight banger from me, and again, I'll read crit in the morning. Hope I did well, although I'm not sure about the 1:1 output. I'm pretty tired though, so might just be me. Thanks! - DrIbarazaki**\n\n**We already know that 914 can affect time, and it has been shown to do so multiple times in various ways. Remember to account for existing precedents when testing, as often you make it sound like your researcher is the first to explore particular avenues when in fact they are questions that have already been answered thoroughly. Instead of an aimless inquiry like \"can 914 affect time?\" you may want to consider a more specific hypothesis. - Boneka**\n\n**Ok!

We're going to be running some objects through it to see how they get from one side to another. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One block of wood\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One pile of sawdust, scattered across the floor of the output booth\n\n//Note: We saw what appeared to be large, mechanical spiders crawl across the floor and collect the block of wood. Despite this, sensors and recorders outside the chamber did not detect any of the chittering or sounds that were detected by the camera. No memetic corruption was detected in the footage so we're going forward with testing. - Intern lacte.//\n\n**Input:** One block of wood\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** 3 smaller blocks of wood, comprised of different colored wood\n\n//Note: Conveyer belt of gears and steel sheets ported from a side door that appeared. Investigations into the input booth found nothing. Putting the footage through SCRAMBLE shows nothing either. - Intern Lacte.// \n\n**Input:** One block of wood\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One sphere of wood\n\n//Note: Large hand. Human. At least from my reckoning. Like flesh and all that. Gave us all quite the scare. Still nothing noteworthy. I've asked someone to get us checked for any anomalies. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Input:** One block of wood\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One finely carved figurine of a cloaked figure holding what appears to be an egg. \n\n//Note: Fire? Something of that sort. Camera showed heat distortions so we couldn't actually see what happened. Camera isn't damaged and sensors detected nothing. I'm beginning to suspect something's up but I'll wait till the medical report comes back to do the final test. - Intern Lacte//\n\n//Note: It seems that everyone who viewed the footage and a good two thirds of the site were under effect of an cognitohazardous effect of unknown origin. Further investigation is ongoing. The output information is unverifiable as further examination revealed encoded antimemetic data contained within the extracted footage. - Intern Lacte//\n\n**Thing based on my comment on how there's technically nothing on how 914 gets an object into itself for refinement. - DMilk**\n\n**I'm not sure if we'd allow a camera welded into the 914 input door. However, if we did, I'm 90% sure it'd be processed all the same. Still, we'll wait for someone who knows better to clarify. Thanks! - DrIbarazaki**\n\n**Hi there! This test encompasses a pair of very interesting concepts, and I very much enjoy the idea! Having said that, I have a few notes for you!\nFirst, welding things to the inside of the booth likely wouldn't be allowed, as there's potential there to damage the input booth! Your researcher would have to be able to make the case that by running the machine with objects attached in such a manner, the machine won't be at risk of damaging itself attempting to remove them. I'd recommend finding other less permanent attachment methods with which to perform testing alongside the tape. Suction cups, perhaps?\nSecond, this test is very long and has two clear sets of testing being done. The testing on placing things on other parts of the booth from the floor and the testing attempting to image the inside of the booth using the camera. I would recommend splitting this test into two separate entries and fleshing both out more, as both ideas have a lot of potential!\nThird, 914 is a cheeky bugger, and it really seems to like messing with people. It's very hard to make any permanent progress during testing, and 914 often will throw in a wrench to undo or call into question all knowledge gained! Perhaps you could incorporate some difficulty into the camera testing, something that renders it useless or unable to provably provide useful or trustworthy information?\nThank you for your time! I know this is a pretty long comment. - Erickson**\n\n**I think that the implication is that the second log had a cognitohazard that made people think there was a video, or hallucinate it or something. However, if it's hard to understand, that is also an issue. - Ibarazaki**\n\n**The intent here is to communicate that the notes were memetic and not real or at least unverifiable. Will edit. - DMilk**\n\n**There's not really a reason for the appended test to go after your main one; it makes for a confusing read especially considering that the main test is also really confusing. The appended test also feels like a fairly cheap cop-out (ex. \"it was all just a dream\" type cliche). The concept is interesting but the test is also extremely bloated and executed in a way that I don't think properly conveys the goal you may have in mind. - Boneka**\n\n**I'll workshop it. - DMilk**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher Bard\n**Date:** 01/03/2025\n**Total Items:** One broken //Fender Stratocaster// electric guitar, one small //Blackstar// guitar amplifier.\n\n**Input:** One broken //Fender// Stratocaster\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One working //Schecter// C-1 SLS Elite guitar colored black and red. The resulting guitar is highly impervious to damage whether it be through physical strikes or attempts to cut it. This invulnerability extends to the strings, which are not removable or adjustable, and as such are perpetually stuck in Drop-D tuning.\n\n**Input:** A small //Blackstar// guitar amplifier \n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A guitar amplifier which is identical to the original amp in all ways except all //Blackstar// branding is replaced by \"Whitestar\". When used with an electric guitar the amplifier produces sound waves and vibrations strong enough to shatter glass and make the room shake. These sound waves and vibrations also push objects that are in front of the amplifier with strength depending on the amplifier's volume level. This occurs despite the amplifier being on its lowest volume setting and is loud enough to cause potential hearing damage to those nearby if exposed to it for too long. The user is also made incapable of hearing anything other than the guitar during use. This effect ends as soon as the guitar is unplugged from the amplifier or when the user puts the guitar down. The user is additionally immune from potential hearing damage from the amplifiers effects. The amplifier also no longer requires a source of power and seemingly powers itself anomalously.\n\n//Note: If possible, I would like to be in charge of researching these items. - Jr. Researcher Bard//\n\n\n**Condensed OOC notes. The Drop-D tuning for the first output makes it pretty amusing so I do like that. I fear that the second test is not particularly interesting; it's just a guitar that's really loud. You could definitely expand on it, maybe by playing into the aspect of the user being immune somehow? - Boneka**\n\n**Updated it a bit. Made it so the amp makes the user incapable of hearing anything other than the guitar while in use. Seems like an interesting trade off. Originally I made the additional note as a joke to not be included but now I kinda want to write a story of my character trying to kill 682 using the guitar and amp. If the additional note is too much for the entry its fine it doesn't have to be included. - AnomalySource**\n\n**The note is far too Lolfoundation in nature and is too much for the entry. - DMilk**\n\n**Thats completely fair. I have removed it. Let me know what else the entry needs in terms of improvement before it can be added to the actual list.- AnomalySource**\n------\n\n**Name:** Junior Researcher John Doe\n**Date:** 02/28/2025\n**Total Items:** Two copies of James Thurber's //The Secret Life of Walter Mitty// written on dollar store pocket journals with \"Input 1\" written on one copy and \"Input 2\" written on the other.\n\n**Date formatting DD/MM/YYYY. - Boneka**\n\n//Note: I just wanted a good read. Something to occupy myself during the dull bits of work (most of my assignments fit that description.) I'm inputing the other copy out of curiosity. -J.R. Doe//\n\n**Input:** One copy of James Thurber's //The Secret Life of Walter Mitty// written on a dollar store pocket journal with \"Input 1\" written on the cover\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A red pocket journal with the word \"Daydreams\" scrawled on its cover. The contents of the journal contain detailed first-person stories concerning various settings. Stories include:\n* An account from a World War I air cavalry unit involving a breakdown of their dogfight with Manfred von Richthofen, colloquially known as the \"Red Baron\"\n* An astronauts description of their Mars landing\n* A jazz musicians show at a bar\n* A defendant winning a court case for first-degree murder\n\n//Note: The defendant won the case by pointing out that a piece of clothing left by the murderer was machine-made, whereas every piece of the defendant's wardrobe was hand-made. Something tells me the slow moments of work are gone. - J.R. Doe//\n\n**Input:** One copy of James Thurber's //The Secret Life of Walter Mitty// written on a dollar store pocket journal with \"Input 2\" written on the cover.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A blue pocket journal with \"Diagnostic\" written on the cover. The contents of the journal are a medical evaluation of one Walter Mitty. The journal describes Walter's Maladaptive Daydreaming syndrome and recommends him cognitive behavioral therapy.\n\n//Note: Poor Walter. -J.R. Doe//\n\n**I chose //Secret Life// because it's my favorite short story of mine and deserves more recognition. Not sure about the movie, though. -JohnDoeMD**\n\n**This is a nice entry, IMO, but it feels very truncated. Please consider expanding upon the output some more, or creating additional input/output pairs for it to go alongside. - Erickson**\n\n**Added a 1:1 output for the journal. Not sure what note to add for it, so that's gonna have to do until something better is figured out. -JohnDoeMD**\n\n**Is there a reason \"Input 1\" and \"Input 2\" are written on the journals? The notes are too conversational and don't add much to the test. Overall I'm afraid it's not very interesting, especially considering that the content is reference-heavy and won't connect to readers who aren't familiar with the material. - Boneka**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Dr. Compton Blue\n**Date:** 01/03/2025\n**Total Items:** Three hard copies of Mobius Digital's //Outer Wilds// for PS5\n\n**Input:** One hard copy of Mobius Digital's //Outer Wilds// for PS5\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One hard copy of Mobius Digital's //The Outer Worlds// for PS5\n\n**Input:** One hard copy of Mobius Digital's //Outer Wilds// for PS5\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One hard copy of //Outer Wilds Ventures// for PS5. No such game is known to exist. The story serves as a prequel to //Outer Wilds//, following Feldspar and the beginning of Outer Wilds Ventures. However, it was discovered to contain highly cognitohazardous material, which caused any person who finished the game to attempt gradually more dangerous activities up until their eventual death. The content of the disc was stored in Foundation archives and the output was incinerated.\n\n**Input:** One hard copy of Mobius Digital's //Outer Wilds// for PS5\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One hard copy of //Outer Wilds: Reality Edition// for PS5. No such game is known to exist. Due to the nature of //Outer Wilds: Reality Edition//, it is almost impossible to research, as it does not utilize a monitor or speaker to communicate information to the player. While the code can be duplicated to create more copies of //Outer Wilds: Reality Edition//, any attempt to view it or anything produced directly from it (including descriptions made by neural networks, crash logs, debugger data, and AI summaries) inevitably exhibit extreme antimemetic effects.\n\n**Addendum:** The disc was inserted into a PS5 console and D-88798 (who had volunteered for this test) created a new profile. Upon entering the game, he appeared to disappear for exactly 22 minutes before suddenly returning to existence. \n\nD-88978 described the experience to be consistent with a mundane //Outer Wilds// playthrough, although with a much greater level of immersion, to the point of experiencing sensations consistent with that of occupying the body of the main character. It is unknown how much time he spent inside of the extradimensional space.\n\nD-88978 has had trouble reacclimating to his body and shows great difficulty moving his little and ring fingers as well as his index and middle fingers independently, which require physical force from an external source to separate. D-88978 also has shown a large degree of disorientation in eye-hand coordination and balance, able only to walk short distances before falling over. He appears being significantly more mature than his age (while physically 22, he shows a mental maturity of around 47) and shows signs of PTSD. More testing is required.\n\n//I'd like to request access to the transcribed code -- if possible, I'll send this to one of my relations in Antimemetics who owes me a favor, he might be able to get some more information on this for us. If we can replicate the effect, we might be able to make some better training programs. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**I know Outer Wilds is a spoiler-sensitive game, but I've limited spoilers to the first few minutes. Go play Outer Wilds and don't spoil yourself first. Hope this entry is at least okay in quality. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**Hey there, Mr. Blue. This third output is a very interesting concept. I have a few notes for you. To start, the output seems to be a *massive* improvement, with very little drawback, in the form of the 1-month reacclimatization period. One could even call it a direct improvement. 914 doesn't really do that. I recommend you add either a stronger single drawback or a few more small drawbacks. Additionally, your character's note could be improved through the use of a more professional tone. Instead of requesting to keep a copy of the item and send it to a family member in the antimemetics department, you could simply have him state that a copy is being shipped to that department for research.  - Erickson.**\n\n**Alright, I've tried to balance it a bit more and removed the direct statement of recovery time. Also justified the request and related it to a \"contact\" in Antimemetics. Still works for what I'm planning. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**Please don't say you're \"planning\" things without relaying to the critters what it is you're planning. That's like writing up a greenlight and then saying \"it's going to be a surprise\" when critters ask you about your plot. And don't use the test logs as a way to advertise your favorite games. The improvement is still too direct and feels like some sort of wish fulfillment fantasy more than anything so I can't say I'd approve this in its current state. - Boneka**\n\n**...I can't say that after looking over this again I wouldn't agree with you. I wasn't meaning to be cryptic when talking about \"what I have planned\", sorry if it came out that way. I'm not meaning to advertise, I just thought this would be a cool concept and wanted to make it into a draft. I was a bit too hasty with the writing on it first time, I've done it a once-over and I think it looks somewhat better now. Sorry if this came off as a fantasy or something. Wasn't meaning it that way. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Noldo\n **Date:** 05/03/2025\n **Total Items:** Eight 100mL glass bottles.\n\n**I think the descriptions of the bottles mentioned above would look better formatted in a note. - Boneka**\n\n**Done! -Noldo**\n\n//Note: The purpose of this test is to determine how SCP-914 “recognizes” what to refine. It does not refine the ambient air inside the intake booth, nor does it appear from previous logs to refine the air inside containers, despite refining the containers themselves. Four bottles, designated “empty,” have been opened in research cell 109-B, left open for 30 minutes, and closed again. Four bottles, designated “full,” have been opened, depressurized in a vacuum chamber, and repressurized with air taken from research cell 109-B. I hypothesize that SCP-914 will only refine the air in the deliberately filled bottles. -Junior Researcher Noldo//\n\n **Input:** One “empty” 100mL glass bottle\n **Setting:** 1:1\n **Output:** One 100mL covered glass beaker. Contents identical to air sample taken from research cell 109-B.\n\n**Input:** One “empty” 100mL glass bottle\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One 100mL glass bottle. Gaseous contents included measurably higher levels of methane and ammonia than air in research cell 109-B and proportionally lower amounts of free hydrogen, nitrogen and water vapor.\n\n//Note: So it has got the idea of refining air, though interesting it started on an empty rather than a filled bottle. -Junior Researcher Noldo//\n\n**I go back and forth on whether this note should be removed. -Noldo**\n\n**I can never remember whether 914 is allowed to do chemical reactions or not. I may come back to this but I'll leave it for now. - Boneka**\n\n **Input:** One “full” 100mL glass bottle\n **Setting:** 1:1\n **Output:** One 200mL glass jar. Jar shattered immediately upon opening of the output booth, hypothesized due to reduced pressure of gas inside the larger container as compared to the ambient pressure, and thinning of the glass to contain a larger volume with the same amount of material.\n\n**Input:** One “full” 100mL glass bottle\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One glass klein bottle, a solid with no volume. Analysis indicates that the easily “closeable” interior space of the bottle is approximately 100mL.\n\n//Note: This does indicate that SCP-914 is “aware” of the gases inside the “full” bottle, since it followed conservation of matter both inside and outside the container, though it’s not allowing me to actually test the gases inside now. -J.R. Noldo//\n\n**Input:** One “empty” 100mL glass bottle\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One visually unchanged bottle. All subjects attempting to open the bottle for testing of internal gases were unsuccessful. Bottle was opened remotely via drone. Torque required to open indicated a gaseous pressure between 1.4e-6 and 2.2e-7 Pa inside the bottle, several orders of magnitude below the point at which it should have shattered due to external air pressure. Despite this massive compressive resistance with respect to air, bottle was easily shattered by hydraulic press.\n\n **Input:** One “full” 100mL glass bottle\n **Setting:** Fine\n **Output:** One visually unchanged bottle filled with a cloudy substance. Atmospheric sensors detected a brief inflow of air at opening of the output booth. Bottle was again opened via drone, at which point the contents (determined to be air from research cell 109-B compressed to a supercritical fluid) were violently ejected from the bottle, rapidly cooling to ~-15ºC. Bottle was forced out of drone manipulators by outflowing fluid and propelled into the chamber wall, where it shattered. Fluid velocity and diameter of bottle's opening indicated bottle to have anomalously contained a fluid pressure of 1.0-1.2e7 Pa.\n\n **Input:** One “empty” 100mL glass bottle\n **Setting:** Very Fine\n **Output:** One ornate glass goblet, inscribed with cognitohazardous symbols. Symbols induced vomiting in all subjects that viewed them, causing them to “empty” their stomach contents into the goblet.\n\n **Input:** One “full” 100mL glass bottle\n **Setting:** Very Fine\n **Output:** One 100mL glass bottle of //Snapple//-brand fruit drink, with the flavor labeled as \"Name the flav!\" a discontinued flavor originally produced in 2020. Bottle is identical to glass bottle designs manufactured by //Keurig Dr. Pepper// except for its small size. Bottle appears empty until a human subject attempts to drink from it, at which point it will dispense a seemingly random liquid substance into the subject’s mouth. To date, all recorded substances are normally gaseous at standard temperature and pressure, and as such dispense between -20ºC and -204ºC, depending on the condensation point of the substance. Substances are drawn from an unknown source, hypothesized to be either nearby (terrestrial) atmospheric gases that are anomalously cooled and/or pressurized during transport, or local (extra-terrestrial) sources where such substances are liquid //in situ//. Testing has been suspended until a reliable way to survive drinking from the bottle is formulated and approved.\n\n//Note: It seems that SCP-914 became aware of the designations “empty” and “full” more than the actual contents of the respective bottles. -J.R. Noldo//\n\n**Added a sourcing sentence for the last test. Incidentally, I have an idea for a highly invasive medical procedure that would allow a D-Class subject to survive drinking from the bottle, but since the entry is so long already it kind of feels like it should be its own thing. If only there were a way to add follow-up tests on anomalous outputs! -Noldo**\n\n**Consolidated OOC notes. I'd encourage you to try writing that as an addendum if you'd like to include it! We don't mind lengthy entries as long as they meet our quality standard, so it wouldn't hurt to add more if you think it would be interesting to the reader. - Boneka**\n\n------\n\n**Name:** Dr. Compton Blue\n**Date:** 09/03/2025\n**Total Items:** N/A\n\n//Note: For this test, no items were input into 914. Instead, a vacuum was pulled on the test chamber. This was to test the effects of refining nothing. In order to reflect this efficiently, instead of the normal Input/Setting/Output being used, Input will be left blank, and the effect on the space inside of the output booth will be listed inside of the Output block. - Dr. Compton Blue//\n\n**Input:**\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** All of the space where the output booth would normally be was concentrated inside of the center of the output booth. This resulted in the output booth being fully inaccessible, and emitting a large amount of temporarily extant radiation. This radiation caused an abnormally large number of macroscopic quantum fluctuations, resulting in the destruction of 3 Foundation drones due to the individual particle's positions essentially being locally randomized. \n\nAt 3:14:27.235 after the initial experiment, the space inside of the output booth underwent an explosion similar to that of the expansion of an infant universe. Exploration by drone revealed a large, flat plane of steel interspersed with quickly growing and falling structures of rust growing in fanned, fern-like structures, whose patterns had minor cognitohazardous effects involving the platonic solids. Space slowly returned to normal over the following 7 hours.\n\n**Input:**\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** The space inside of the output booth appeared to instantly dematerialize anything that was present inside of it into energy at a rate of close to 100% (estimated to be ~99.897%, .001% error). This resulted in an analogue to the Leidenfrost effect where, while a large amount of radiation was observed, due to its repulsive effect on the surrounding air, there was no major damage to Site-19 Facility-23. This rate decreased linearly to 0% over the following 12 hours.\n\n**Input:**\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** All major fundamental forces exhibited reversals inside of the output booth. This caused the deconstruction of all matter inside of the output booth to a quark soup, which continued to self-replicate. The intensity slowly returned to zero over the following 4 hours. At exactly 2:21:35.021, all forces were at exactly zero, causing the inability to see inside of the chamber. At that exact moment, all of the matter contained within the output chamber ceased to exist. This is theorized to be a delayed response to restore CoM.\n\n**Input:**\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A block of what appears to be solid vacuum, constituting the entire volume of the test chamber. It may be thought of as a clear barrier through which matter may not travel, but light is permitted to. It does not interact with gravity or the electronuclear forces, although it does collide with matter. The standard method of transport is suction cups, and it must be weighed down at all times to counteract buoyancy. All current attempts to destroy it have failed, and all further attempts are on hiatus, as it has been lost several times during destruction attempts.\n\n**Input:**\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** --Output does not exist.-- Output was a sphere measuring 1.5 meters in diameter which did not exist. Due to it having dissipated, predicted negative effects did not occur. Further testing on vacuums or near-vacuums at the Very Fine level is prohibited without direct O5 approval.\n\n**This is a bit of a weird one and I'm excited to hear your feedback. I know I'm stretching what 914 can do a bit, but I never violated CoM and I think it's in the spirit of 914. This is hopefully going to be part of a mini-narrative in the 914 test logs I'm looking to construct. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**Right, I know there are some issues here, but I'm sleep deprived and this is confusing so I'm not entirely sure how to get some of this across. I'll get the main stuff tomorrow. In the meantime, a Senior Researcher would probably hold Level-3 clearance, (Level-4 might be a department head or something), you don't have to redact their name, and instead of the input being blank you should probably put something like N/A at least. The way you formatted the time was also confusing, and what does \"Scrambled the particles\" mean? Thanks! - DrIbarazaki**\n\n**I don't think the name redaction works here unless there's a good reason for the entity's name to be redacted. Changing eye color to indicate possession is very textbook Mary Sue-esque and I'd steer away from it; that test also doesn't seem to have much to do with the rest of the entry, so it feels shoehorned. I do like the rest of the test aside from that. Again, if your intention is to do \"plan\" something or do a subplot, you should communicate your plans to the critters from the get-go. - Boneka**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+old plot\" hide=\"-hide\"]]\n**So, I'm going to give a bit away here. This is pretty complicated, don't tell me I didn't warn you.**\n\n**Sr. Researcher █████████ was involved with the Fae at the point of their death, and the \"anomaly\" is a Pattern Screamer that was pulled out of the void by 914 and shaped by Dr. Blue's memories.**\n\n**Sr. Researcher █████████ accidentally made a deal that involved their name being stolen, but because they were killed in a car accident at the same moment the deal was supposed to go through, it was held in a kind of escrow by the thaumaturgical fields dictating name magic.**\n\n**When Dr. Blue shaped the pattern screamer made by 914, which took time and is the reason for the existence of the --Nothing-- in the original entry, he caused the identity of Sr. Researcher █████████ to return to existence, but not their physical form.**\n\n**The Fae that was originally going to make the deal died after the test, but because their identity wasn't held in escrow, they weren't made into a Pattern Screamer. When the deal went through, the latent name magic pulled them out of Corbenic and into the normal world, where, since the identity of Sr. Researcher █████████ was now a pattern screamer, they assumed that form.**\n\n**The Fae, wanting a physical form, is now trying to convince Sr. Researcher █████████ that they are the real Sr. Researcher █████████, even though Sr. Researcher █████████ doesn't exist anymore. They're trying to do this in order to obtain the name of Dr. Blue.**\n\n**However, Dr. Blue, having worked with Sr. Researcher █████████ during some of this, suspects that the Fae assuming the identity of Sr. Researcher █████████ isn't Sr. Researcher █████████. He knows this because 1) Sr. Researcher █████████ had brown eyes, not green eyes, 2) he knows Sr. Researcher █████████ was involved with the Fae, and 3) green is associated with the Fae. Because of this, he's being more reclusive, not mentioning his own name, and taking steps to protect himself.**\n\n**Dr. Blue was previously a part of the Church of the Broken God, and he has a machine automaton capable of containing human consciousness. What's going to happen is that he makes a deal with the Fae giving them the \"identity of the body\" through a contract facilitated with 914. He then transfers into the automata before the deal can go through, causing the Fae to take the identity of his body //while he isn't inhabiting it//.**\n\n**This creates another situation where the identity of the body isn't present, causing the creation of another Pattern Screamer. However, since the body wasn't dead when the deal went through and instead was only lacking a personality, the Fae instead gains full control of the body of Dr. Blue.**\n\n**Due to them being a Pattern Screamer with no name, however, they gain antimemetic properties that allow them to go undetected. This means that they're able to request tests to facilitate their own interests without anyone being able to know who did it.**\n\n**This creates a situation where the real Dr. Blue (who nobody knows //is// Dr. Blue) in the automata has to kill the fake Dr. Blue, who is under the protection of the SCP Foundation. They then have to explain what happened without invoking the name deal which involved the original Sr. Researcher █████████, while the Foundation suspects he's the Fae, and trying to explain why they can't find his body.**\n\n**This invokes the previously mentioned contact in Antimemetics, who he calls on to investigate the missing corpse problem. While here, the Antimemetics contact (simply known as Guest Researcher) uses 914 to enhance mnestic drugs using Dr. Blue's identity, which invokes terms within the Fae deal dealing with exclusivity. This causes Guest Researcher to lose his name to a Pattern Screamer state as well but allows him to see the Fae.**\n\n**He then uses his own contact in the Department of Temporal Affairs to allow him to send a note back to himself, and it's revealed he is also Dr. Blue (this time a time-duplicate from the future). This note allows him to realize that this all needs to be undone using 914. He then locates and kills the Fae's body and places himself as a proxy holder of the deal inside of 914's input booth and uses a remote-controlled device to turn the key after setting 914 to the coarse setting.**\n\n**This voids the Pattern Screamer and Fae deal, although it also kills himself and destroys the body, returning the identity to, you guessed it, Guest Researcher Blue (temporally duplicated from before they were engaged and planted in the Antimemetics Department), Dr. Blue 2 Electric Boogaloo (the one in the temporal department), the new, machine body Dr. Blue, and the original Sr. Researcher Corianthus, who returns to being dead.**\n\n**Dr. Blue 2 (from the Department of Temporal Affairs) then goes back and collects Guest Researcher Blue's remains and wipe the memory of the new Dr. Blue, replacing their memory of the incident with a car accident requiring a full body transfer.**\n\n**That's about it! It's a bit complicated, but I'm hoping it's okay for a subplot. -BlueEyedFox_**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Above collapsible is cause that OOC note was really long and no longer applicable. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**Stopping you right there. Thank you for explaining everything and it's clear you've given this a lot of thought, but this plot is very convoluted and is not going to convey well in the test log format, especially because everything you described has extremely tangential relation to 914 testing at best. - Boneka**\n\n**I don't like throwing it totally away (I think I'll keep the plot if I ever need a story to tell in an article) but I realize what you're saying and after all, you're the veteran. I'll scrap it for now, but I'm keeping the last test more related to pattern screamers. Oh, and DrIbarazaki, I've clarified \"scrambled the particles\" - that was a bad way to put it anyway. - BlueEyedFox_**\n\n**I feel that the time put for the first log is too specific. - DMilk**\n\n------\n\n+++++ Hey you, sandbox editor!
