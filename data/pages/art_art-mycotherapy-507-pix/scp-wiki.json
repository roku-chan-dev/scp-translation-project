I love friendly monsterlike characters, the Wanderer's Library, anomalies escaping from Foundation custody, and looking at pictures. It's all a win! I didn't even KNOW you could do tales that were comics before I saw Whitney's stuff and have been wanting to draw something from one of them for a while now. Ended up doing TWO technically.\n\nI know the signs weren't supposed to be light up but I... felt like the piece needed more movement. I think it turned out very well!\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
