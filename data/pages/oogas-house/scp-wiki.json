Sometimes for comedic effect, sometimes to scare, it'll always be bizarre if it's coming from me. My articles are rarely all-the-way serious, but aside from the occasional grim piece expect at least one joke per article. I love making weird creatures more than almost anything else in the world.\n\n[[size 125%]]//I don't know how to do fancy divs or themes or CSS formatting please forgive me.//[[/size]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Writing Philosophy:**[[/size]]\nThe way I portray the Foundation is occasionally compared to lolFoundation, but that's not really what I'm going for. I portray the Foundation and life within it as what it is: a workplace. Sure, it's an important, weird, dangerous job, but still a job nonetheless. And the people there are smart, but no less human. They goof off when they know it's safe to do so. They chat with each other, and maybe the anomalies too if they're the less-loathsome type. Because no matter how serious it may seem, the setting is by its very definition full of strangeness. So let's get strange, ourselves!\n\nMy main writing influences include Terry Pratchett, Junji Ito, Ursula Vernon, Q Hayashida, Douglas Adams, Alfabusa, Gary Larson and David Lynch.\n\nI am always open to collabs, as they are fun, and it is cool to see other people's takes on your ideas. For the same reasons, you never need to ask me to use any of my creations in your work, but still feel free to ask me for advice. I like to help!\n\nIf you need me, contact me on discord at iamtheooga#1866.\n\nIf you dislike any of my works, let me know why, so I can make them un-suck. I love getting feedback, and I read all comments in the discussions of my articles.
