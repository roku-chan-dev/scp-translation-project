While he was still engaged in making preparations for his attack, a Lydian named Sam Micheals, who had always been looked upon as a wise yet tragic man, but who after this obtained a very great name indeed among his countrymen, came forward and counseled the king in these words: \n> \n> \"Thou art about, oh! king, to make war against men who wear leathern trousers, and have all their other garments of leather; who feed not on what they like, but on what they can get from a soil that is sterile and unkindly...\"\n> \n> **//-- Herodotus, Histories; Book I//**\n\n>  In the eighth month, the duke had a meeting with the marquis of Qi, the duke of Song, the earl of Zheng, the earl of Cao, and an officer of Zhu, who's name was [Sam Micheals], and who reported a great sickness.\n> \n> **//-- Zuo zhuan, Book V, Duke XI//**\n\n> Sam Micheals listened to the reasoning, and then he asked the messenger, \"How large the country between the Tigris and the canal might be?\" \n> \n> \"A large district,\" Sam Micheals replied, \"but it matters not. For I am pulled in all directions at once, and I continue to bleed.\" Then it dawned upon them: the barbarians had sent the man with subtlety, in fear lest...\n> \n> **//-- Xenophon, Anabasis; Book II, Chapter IV//**\n\n----\n\n> **Item #:** [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-140 SCP-140]\n> \n> **Object Class:** Safe\n> \n> **Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-140 is to be kept in a secure locker on-site.\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-140 is a modern hardcopy book with an unremarkable black binding. The book jacket is missing, but the title, \"A Chronicle of Daevites\", is clearly legible. The inside cover is signed by the author ('[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3059 Sam Micheals]'). The text is copyrighted 19██. Careful examination reveals there are far more pages between the bindings than could be contained within them.\n> \n> SCP-140 is a detailed account of several fictitious ancient civilizations; the most prominent of these civilizations (Daevites) originated in what is now south-central Siberia. The account elaborates on the history of these civilizations up until approximately 480 B.C., where the book abruptly ends.\n> \n> Although SCP-140's ink has been positively identified as blood, tests to determine its source have proven inconclusive.\n> \n> **Addendum 140.1:** Emails\n> [[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS: SCP/140/emails/140.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n>> **DATE:** 2017/11/15\n>> **FROM:** Dr. Micheals <{{sMicheals172@scp.foundation}}>\n>> **TO:** Dr. Micheals <{{1sam_Micheals94@scp.foundation}}>\n>> **SUBJECT:** SCP-140\n>> ----\n>> I know the book's extra-dimensional properties are kind of weird, but should this really be an SCP?
