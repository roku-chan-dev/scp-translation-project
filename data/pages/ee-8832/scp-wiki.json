Foundation forces were notified immediately due to the triggering of motion sensors and countermeasures in the area.  Motion was logged for fifteen minutes and forty-two seconds.  By the time containment specialists arrived at the anomaly, none of the culprits were present.  Despite the detonation of three explosive mines, no bodies or blood was found.  A small amount of charred clay and moss was found in the blast zone of detonated ordnance.  \n\nInside the ruins of the fort contained in SCP-5267, a wall of the throne room was found to have been demolished with explosives.  The revealed chamber contained numerous chests and display pedestals.  Any material goods stored within were taken with the breaching individuals, but residue from thaumaturgical ritual items was diffuse within the chamber.  Foundation surveyors had missed the chamber due to a subtle cognitohazard worked into the mortar between stones that made up the wall.  Some small residue of blood dating to the 2^^nd^^ century CE was found worked into the mortar.  \n\n**__[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5512 | Diego Marquez – PoI-8832 sighting]]]__**.\nOn 3, July, 1993, members of MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”) confirm sighting of Diego Marquez/SCP-4612-B in Manhattan, New York City.

Explosion is determined to be thaumaturgical in nature, theorized to be a forcing open of the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/serpent-s-hand-hub | Way]]].  CC-TV footage in the area revealed an assault force of several dozen armed individuals, dressed in camouflage.\n\nThe assault coincided with several other explosions across Europe: Madrid, Nice, Budapest, and Istanbul.[[footnote]]All eventually found to be thaumaturgical in nature.[[/footnote]]  A cover story was developed and released to the public with the help of affected governments concerning a concerted terrorist attack.  Any witnesses of the assault force were amnesticized during cleanup operations.\n\n-----\n\n++++ __Mobilization__\nWithin an hour, Site-91, only sixteen kilometers outside York, had mobilized forces to investigate.  Given the explosion’s location at SCP-3743-A-2, it was theorized that the attack was focused on the pocket dimension designated SCP-3743-B.  \n\nDirector Varga ordered a mobilization of the Project Hecatoncheires joint task force.  In the months since the Way designated SCP-3743-A-1 was discovered, and ultimately neutralized, researchers at Site-91 had investigated the originating rituals thoroughly; the thaumaturgical research staff were able to determine a mechanism to reactivate the Way.  As SCP-3743-A-1 also led to SCP-3743-B, it was targeted as an insertion point.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #E2E2E2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Beta777%20Logo.png width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n\n\n**__Mobilized Personnel__**: \n__MTF-Beta-777__ (“Hecate’s Spear”): //Captain Sahara Zadeh//;[[footnote]]Class-A thaumatologist.

Apparently, the Matriarch’s plan if she couldn’t outright wipe the cultists out was to rewrite history.  Some sort of blood sacrifice ritual to cancel out the temple having ever been moved off the plain back in Ancient Greek days. If she’d succeeded, Marquez… or Euboea, I guess, would have been screwed – none of the traps or preparations he’d made would be there, and maybe the cultists also.  Who knows how that would have rewritten things?  But I guess we don’t have to worry about that.  The spell wasn’t successful.  Not completely. \n\nI don’t know if I caused Sahara’s death, but I feel like I did.  The others certainly think so.  By the time I got back to the temple, I could see it on all their faces – except maybe Waltham’s.  My fault.\n\nWhat did we gain? We interfered in a war between two ancient cults and we lost two people.  Matriarch’s army was destroyed, that had to hurt, but the temple is no longer the cult’s safe haven.  And now, we don’t know where any of them are.  Took me over an hour to find a way to communicate with Site-91, and that was by pay phone.  \n\nThe more time goes by, the less I think we’ll be able to contain any of these people. Maybe we should be content to put them in the ground and call it a day.\n\nWe brought the pedestal back, the thaumaturges are analyzing it.  I tried to get a read on it, but all I felt was her.  She did it on purpose.  Figured it was powered by blood like the rest of Daeva nonsense and she co-opted the ritual.  Guess that’s something.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"► Captain Rashid al Hasin ◄\" hide=\"▼ Close File ▼\"]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Director Iona Varga\n**From:** Rashid al Hasin\n**Subject:** Concerning performance in the field.\n[[/div]]\n------\n04/07/1993\n\nDir. Varga,\n\nI think I’m not alone in being disappointed with the results of yesterday’s mobilization.  Waltham is injured, we lost both primary targets, and Captain Zadeh is dead.  \n\nBefore I get into the nitty gritty, I want to commend Sergeant Waltham in all aspects of her performance. Without her, we would have been a much worse situation on several occasions.  Her actions saved the lives of her fellow task force members on numerous occasions.  If my opinion is relevant at all, I think a battlefield commission is in order. She’s going to be a great leader someday.\n\nAs for Douglas.  She’s out of control.  She doesn’t follow directions and she decides the best course of action without much thought to the consequences.  I’ve looked over the past year’s action reports and she has shown a growing tendency to just do what she wants.  She sees an opportunity to hurt the target, and she does it.  In Mongolia, she shot the Matriarch without much warning.  It didn’t kill her – is she dead already? I’m confused by how that woman is walking around – but it started a chain of events that ended in losing custody of the anomaly and potentially to yesterday’s loss.  \n\nCaptain Zadeh’s death, while not entirely on Douglas’ shoulders, could not have happened without her ill-advised actions in the field.  This cannot continue.  Either she shapes up, or I don’t use her in the field again.  \n\nSincerely,\n\nCaptain al Hasin\nInterim Joint Task Force Field Command\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[=image  https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/ProjectHeca width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Captain al Hasin\n**From:** Iona Varga, PhD/MD – Director of Site-91\n**Subject:** Re: Douglas\n[[/div]]\n------\n@@ @@\nI’ll take your thoughts under advisement.
