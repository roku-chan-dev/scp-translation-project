Alison Chao is here, I guess?##\n\n\nJust so we are clear, we are discussing this matter due to the request of our latest member. ##blue|Hello, good morning. Or afternoon. I don’t understand how time works here yet.## ##green| Don’t fret. You’ll get used to it in due time.## Let us begin, then.\n\n++ Baseline\n\nThis anomaly ##red|I wouldn't call it an \"anomaly\".## ##green| Agreed, that would give a false impression of what this matter actually is: a mundane occurrence that supports itself on anomalies.## Let's call it a \"phenomenon\", then. ##green|Much better.##\n\nSo, this phenomenon is a form of political superpower that sometimes develops into a global government ##red|fuck-em## and it follows the ideals of fascism ##red|it's just a global nazi regime## This \"regime\" ##green|Are we calling them that? What is this, a YA novel?## ##blue| A what?## ##green|Don't worry about it yet.## As I was saying, the \"regime\" sustains itself through the usual totalitarian ways, with an overwhelming focus on militarism and expansionism. To support this, they usually use all the anomalies and paratechnologies at their disposal. They have a branch with this specific purpose. In a lot of instances it's called \"the SKP\". \n\nAlso, and this is very concerning, they are known to perpetrate genocide against those who they do not consider perfect. ##red| and their view of perfection is very narrow and racist and ableist## Yes.\n\n++ Prerequisites\n\nThe existence of Homo Sapiens as a dominant species ##red|come on, that’s a given!## You can never be too sure as to what’s important ##red|I think it’s also necessary that there is societal development until there’s enough left leaning movements to create a violent response by reactionary movements## And industrialisation. ##green|That would be societal development## ##red|is it truly?## It’s not important, do you have anything to add, Chao? ##blue|I wouldn't know what to say...## Then I think this is all.\n\n++ Utility\n\nNone. ##red|it's a good punching bag## ##green|It can be a fine cautionary tale.## ##red| not the most interesting one, tho##\n\n++ Vulnerabilities\n\n##Blue| None! They are unstoppable. They crush all hope under their boots. I’ve spent months searching and cannot find any vulnerabilities. I've lost almost all of my friends while fighting them, and there's nothing that can be done against!## ##red|well, I don't know about that## ##Green| They do suffer quite a lot from hubris. The mighty villain falls prey to their own pride.## ##Blue|But they're invincible!## ##Red|naah, you know what they say about authoritarianism, once you cut off the head of the snake...## ##Blue|But...## As you'll see, they have their fair share of vulnerabilities that can be exploited, but as administrator of this page, I think it's better if we see those in their respective instances.\n\n++ Instance: Timeline K-1891\n\n##Blue| This is where I come from. “The Regime” controls everything. The army, who is an elite force of artificially created Übermensch who are armed with firearms of varying caliber, and wear a body armour consisting of a ballistic vest with shoulder pads and helmet, which are resistant against calibres up to 6.5 mm. Soldiers of the front-line infantry can be equipped with full armour## ##red| I don't want to be rude, but I don't think anyone cares about how to dress to commit fucking crimes against humanity.##  ##Green| That string of words sounded like a very mild cognitohazard.## We'll have to clean her. \n\nI'm sorry, Chao, carry on. \n\n##Blue|I wanted to say that the police and military control everything, killing anyone who doesn't conform to their view of perfection. They’ve streamlined the means of exterminating dissenters and imperfect people to a monstrous degree. I’ve seen it. I… I cannot begin to describe… It’s horrible…## It must be hard. We are sorry for what you’ve surely had to endure. ##Blue| You don't have to be. Father- I mean- Doktor Gears is in the military elite.  I was part of the Regime for a time. Until I saw what they do up close. Every second I'm alive, I regret being involved with that despicable regime.## ##green| Oh. That explains why you are such a clear-cut [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/blank |protagonist]]], then.## ##Blue| What?## ##Red| don't listen to her. she's very into that patabullshit## ##Green| Can you blame me? Our Little Sister here has a textbook tragic backstory and motivation! ## ##Blue|I don't understand.## ##Green| I' am tremendously sorry for interrupting. Carry on.##\n\n##Blue|That’s it, for the most part. There’s disconnected pockets of resistance, but they are systematically snuffed out. I joined one of those groups, and it led me here.## We are happy to have you. ##Blue|Thank you. I'm glad to be here.##\n\n++ Instance: Timeline M-8903\n\nThis is possibly the single most powerful instance of the Regime we have registered. Their grip on Earth was completely unchallenged. And expansion into space and extradimensional locations was just starting, but going remarkably well for them. Because the Library is obviously closed to them, access to ways offworld was very limited. Through their unethical experimentation, they did discover the existence of afterlives. ##Green| I think I can guess where this is going.## Yes. In 1998, they discovered that the most easily accessible afterlife was [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-galahad |Corbenic]]]. ##Blue|Was what?## ##Red|we'll explain later##\n\nThe \"Regime\", thought that they could achieve immortality if they controlled Corbenic, and tried launching an invasion that went as poorly as expected. And of course, the Three Moons Initiative wasn't particularly happy about an attack from an organisation full of fascists ##Red|as if they are any different## We'll leave that discussion for another time. The forces of the impenetrable retaliated by sending [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2578 |some of their machines]]] into M-8903. In less than a year, most of the high ranking officials of the \"Regime\" had been terminated. And I'm sure their souls are suffering their punishment in Corbenic as we speak.\n\nWithout their leaders, the Regime fell ##Red|hell yeah## The rest of human society in that timeline is now under the Initiative's purview ##Red|hell nah. I don't trust those undead fucks with their drones## ##Green|You don't trust anyone.## ##Red|and I'm right!## ##Blue|It fills me with hope to see that it’s true that the Regime can fall, even if it seems unstoppable.## ##Green|Just wait and see, young one.##\n\n++ Instance: Timeline B-2512\n\n##Red|this one was very fun## ##Blue|I’m sorry?## ##Red|I was in charge of this one. it’s always enjoyable to see how they bash in those squared, perfect blond fascist heads.## Could you get to the report? ##Red|yeah, yeah, I know. basic stuff. bunch of assholes turn up everywhere, they form this fascist government in spain, if I remember correctly, the other assholes in charge either don’t do anything or do a piss-poor job at fighting back, the nazis get a truckload of anomalies and steamroll the resistance at the time. they celebrate with their beer and their perfect little inbred families.## \n\n##Red|and then our people turn up. the resistance movements. they had everyone, and I mean everyone. the serpent’s hand of the time where there, the satanists, the communists, the nälkä, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-man-of-clay-and-men-formerly-men |that one kickass golem]]], the yeren, the fae... everyone. they had enough and orquestrated an all-out rebellion that raged on for years. they were fucked. it was an all out revolution of the people, anomalous and non-anomalous. I had a lot of fun.## Us? ##Red|yeah, I joined the movement, obviously. I love a good throwdown against the forces of oppression. ripped a tank in half with a magic baseball bat!## Sounds fun. ##Green|I’m glad you helped.## ##Red|me too!##\n\n##Red|now it’s over. I dipped out when they started talking about creating new societal structures and stuff which isn’t my style.##\n\n++ Instance: Timeline O-5382\n\n##Green|I was the one who investigated this instance. In this timeline, the Regime controlled the western hemisphere, and is locked in an Occult Cold War against the USSR and an emerging China. This escalated into an eigenweapon arms race. The USSR’s weapons are physical in nature, most of them being giant complex machines developed by the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-of-the-russian-branch |Progress Research Institute]]].## ##Red| I don't particularly care about those people. what happened to the nazis?## ##Green|Their attempts were different. Their weapons were memetic in nature, particularly after the enlisting of a secret society of memeticists apparently called the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6382 |\"Giftschreiber\"]]] ## ##Blue|The what?## I've never heard of them. This is concerning. Do we have any records on this group? ##Green|I didn't find anything.## Then it might be worth it to figure out what their deal is. ##Red|if they worked with nazis this time, I'm sure they aren't friendship material##\n\n##Green|Carrying on, they tried to use memetics to take control of the Nöosphere, which let me tell you, it’s a very bad idea. The records on what they were trying to do is sparse, but what they unleashed was destructive enough that the government collapsed.## ##Red|not that I'm surprised, but how did it happen?##  ##Green|I can think of a couple of explanations, but I don’t have a way of proving my hypotheses. The records of those eigenweapons were written in German, and most Germanic languages in this timeline have degraded into an incomprehensible and cognitohazardous word salad that burns people alive.## That's interesting. ##Blue|And scary.## ##Green|The Regime fell in the nineties because of this event. And society in the western hemisphere is now maintained by those who didn't speak Germanic languages. The USSR has become the de facto global superpower## ##Red|ugh.##\n\n++ Instance: Timeline V-1014\n\nThis timeline followed the baseline requisites pretty closely. By the 1950s, most of the western world was under control of the nazi government after an extremely long WW2 and its correspondent 7th Occult War. Almost all external enemies had been dealt with by the 1970s, with other nations being either integrated or destroyed. The same goes with most known anomalous organisations that could have resisted. And without an enemy to rally against, they fell to infighting. ##Red|fucking guessed it. I had that in my bingo card.## The paranoia of the leaders of the government led to a raging civil war. Interestingly, the use of anomalies was almost minimal. The fall of the Regime was brought about by purely mundane reasons.\n\nBy the early 21st century, most big traces of the phenomenon have been snuffed out by their own self-destructive nature. The rest of the world is moving on, and from what I gathered, is building a more equalitarian society from the ashes of the old one ##Red| I like that a lot## ##Blue| Me too. It fills me with even more hope.## ##Green|According to my models, there’s a lot of timelines where the instance suffers this fate.## And how many is a lot to you? ##Green|I actually don’t know. But there’s an uncountable amount across the timeplane.## ##Red|:)##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##Blue|So, what do I have to do to end the SKP in my timeline?## ##Green| Having seen what we've seen, there's a pretty big chance that if we leave it alone, it will fall on its own.## But we can always interfere a little ##Red|or a lot## ##Blue| You would do that? Would you help me?## Of course! It's the least we can do for our Little Sister. ##Green| I'm sure I can create some gadgets and gizmos and find some MacGuffins that can help!## ##Red|and I'm always down to crack some fascists' skulls!##\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Diogene_s]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
