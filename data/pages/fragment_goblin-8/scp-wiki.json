Junior re-appeared but straight away noticed something wrong with his feet. They felt nothing. At the same time, he blinked. There was nothing on the horizon or anywhere. He was stranded somewhere, where even the law of gravity came to rest.\n\n“UGH! Something is wrong with this damn machine. It keeps spitting out random values. Wait right there, the sensors need time to orient themselves.” Duchamp seemed angry. \n\n“It’s fine. There’s not much here, feels a bit creepy though.” Junior tried to walk forward but as he moved his legs in a walking position it only caused his whole body to flip, causing him to tumble aimlessly at the mercy of his center of mass\n \nHe reached out his arms in an attempt to grab onto something, anything. But, obviously, there was nothing. He waved around like a bird while moving his head around but, again, the world was empty. \n\n“Where am I, exactly?” \n\n“Hmm...it's weird you don't see anybody. Teller, you know that old man across the hall from you, surveyed this place last year. I’m reading his report right now and there's supposed to be trillions of beings or something, highly developed, you know, like overpopulated and...” \n\nDuchamp kept talking while Junior gave up trying to move around. He just sat listening -- his body static in the vacuum, feeling thankful that all he had to do was wait for Duchamp to fix the transporter. The zero gravity felt strangely comforting. \n\n“Who are you?” Junior felt a hot breath as someone whispered in his ear. \n\nHe flinched and swatted against the sudden presence but only empty space met his flailing limbs\n\n“What universe are you from? Not from here, surely?” The voice was in front of Junior now. It was clear, melodic, mocking. \n\nJunior turned his head again. His eyes glanced over a ludicrous character, straight out of fiction. A humanoid, androgynous being was only a dozen inches away from him. It looked to be covered in a dense, metallic exoskeleton with its upper head wearing a visor, reminiscent of VR. Behind the visor was exposed long hair that flowed down to its shoulders. \n\nUnder the steel exosuit, it were wearing a pure white skin suit that contrasted strikingly with the emptiness. \n\nJunior squinted and saw a miniscule pattern covering the whole outfit. Hundreds, maybe, thousands of SCP insignias moving and jumping from one tiny patch of fabric to another. Staring for more than a moment made Junior dizzy. \n\nIt was riding a hoverboard with one side kicked up. Cartoonishly, its legs stood still as its head moved and tracked an outline over Junior’s body as it poked and prodded him.\n\nJunior pushed back against the entity's body. But it blipped back a few feet as soon as his hands were about to reach it. \n\n“Why so antsy?” It said while tipping its head to the left and holding its chin. \n\n“You’re the one whose jumping realities, when you know that’s restricted.” The entity began tapping on its large visor. \n\n“SHIT!” Duchamp yelled. \n\n“Ugh. These guys are fucking crazy. Wardens…They are super hard to deal with. I’ll try to get you outta there as quickly as possible. Answer his questions honestly and don’t be antagonistic.”\n\nThe entity removed it’s headset and pushed back its hair so it didn't float all over the place. \n\n“I can hear you. Whoever’s talking to my friend here.” The entity opened its eyes and Junior gulped. In place of pupils were SCP emblems. \n\n“The Multiversal SCP Foundation aren’t crazy, you dingus. And all wardens are specially trained.” The entity blipped and re-appeared with its arm around Junior who didn’t faint only because of the potion’s aftereffects. \n\nHe noticed that the entity had no teeth but spoke without a lisp. \n\n“My name is Max. Don’t need to tell me yours. Now what are you doing all the way out here?” It said with an alluring voice. It moved around while it talked in absurd and exaggerated gestures. \n\n“We are chasing after a thief.” Junior enunciated with caution. \n\n“So? I would’ve taken care of it for you. Your universe does have contact with us after all. Look around, these poor fools wanted to leave their own reality just like you are. Look at them now. WAIT! Hah! You can't, they're gone.” \n\n“I'm just following my boss’ instructions. His name is Raphaeal Duchamp. ” Junior was rather quick with his answer. \n\nMax blipped again putting his elbows atop Junior’s head. \n\n“Not a loyal pet I see. Hmmm…” Max separated himself from Junior. His head twisted and turned 180°. He turned it back and forth and his head twisted in various directions. \n\n“Wow! You looked like just any ol’ researcher to me. But it seems you're special.” \n\nMax blinked and then peered right at you. He waved his hand into space. \n\n“Hi! Nice to meet you! It’s my first time in one of these so I don’t really have words prepared!” Max was not speaking to Duchamp nor Junior. \n\n“I’m telling you, most of those upper level Multiversal guys are freakin’ psychotic. Give me a few more seconds, this thing is almost done re-configuring.” Junior could tell that Duchamp was disturbed from his uncharacteristic tone. \n\nMax blipped again and was now leaning back-to-back with Junior. \n\n“I think I like you. I won’t eat you this time, but maybe when this whole shindig with that guy over there is done— ” Max was pointing at you. \n\n“Then I’ll come by to hangout.” Junior could not comprehend what Max was saying. He was confused since the start of the conversation but his instincts told him to stay still and shut up. \n\n“Bye now!” squeaked Max. Junior disappeared as his transporter finally turned back on. \n\n**//[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dying-in-an-ocean-of-money-was-worth-it/offset/7|Follow Junior?]]]//**\n\n**or**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Remain A Little Longer?\" hide=\"\"]]\n\n\nMax watched as the obviously terrified boy he found vanished. He looked at you and smirked. \n\nHe placed his headset back on and spoke out loud. \n\n“Computer! Connect me to headquarters.” Max started flying on his hoverboard through the emptiness. \n\nA few seconds later, a sound emerged from somewhere. \n\n“What is the emergency?” A voice from beyond replied curtly. \n\n“There’s someone else listening in. Is that alright?” Max said while giggling. \n\n“I have already detected it. Continue.” \n\n“The demolition of this anomalous reality is about 98% complete. However, I intercepted an unregistered, illegal multiversal traveler from Alpha-Canary-Yellow-ⶢ-3. Due to extraneous circumstances, I let him go.” Max thundered with professionalism. \n\n“I’m familiar with that universe. You will not interfere with that traveler, Duchamp, or their director Castro. The scenario is already underway.” The voice continued. \n\n“And thank you for great work, Warden Max. You have served the Foundation well. But in your next life, do not acknowledge things that are beyond your purview.” The voice from beyond was not referring to Junior nor Duchamp. \n\nThe empty universe began to fold in on itself. The space contorted, crushing Warden Max, until there was only a single point. \n\nAnd then there was a bang. \n\n[[/collapsible]]",
