There are few, if any, other cooperative entities with its degree of expertise in anomalous mechanics. Considering Husik's independent development of successful containment procedures for seventeen separate anomalies within a decade of employment, its current position as Head of the Department of Applied Mathematics is no surprise.\n\n**1.2.** Permission to use anomalous methods to produce containment procedures are heavily restricted. Following formal requests, Dr. Husik has previously employed Sarkic rituals for containment purposes. Although, as it is not permitted to use anomalous practices when not explicitly authorized, its self-experimentation constitutes a direct violation of both Overseer order and Ethics Committee precedent.\n\n**1.3.** Detainment and subsequent analysis of Dr. Husik revealed a set of anomalous features not unlike the arrays of Site CONRAD’s Neural Interface Computational Engines. It is not currently discernible whether these alterations merely resemble or actually share the same origins as the biomachinery. In either circumstance, the same benefit is provided: Husik presents unusually advanced capabilities in calculation and problem-solving. The extent of its capacities are unknown.\n\n**1.4.** Given Dr. Husik’s previous affiliation with the Sarkic Cult, it is presumed augmentations were made [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]. Therefore, it is inconsistent with Foundation criteria for baseline humanity.\n\n**1.5.** It is indeterminable whether Dr. Husik’s moral faculties have been affected. The premature death of Director Kelly suggests that Husik no longer maintains a benevolent view of human life. It has insisted that its usage of the NICE to evaluate the deaths of Foundation personnel was intended to “prevent further loss of life”, but has failed to adequately offer any rational explanation for its choice of persons.\n\n**1.6.** Interview Logs\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► HUSIKM-1959-1\" hide=\"▼ HUSIKM-1959-1\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 11/27/1959\n**SUBJECT:** Moshe Husik\n**INTERVIEWER:** Mason Kelly, Site Director\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**KELLY:** This isn’t really something I expected to be doing, Husik.\n\n**SUBJECT:** I didn’t think you’d be sitting here, either.\n\n**KELLY:** You’re sweating.\n\n**SUBJECT:** I’m nervous, Kelly. Seriously, you have to seek shelter.\n\n**KELLY:** I’ve never seen you go this far off a hunch.\n\n**SUBJECT:** It’s not a hunch. Please, I'm begging you. Run or hide! Do something!\n\n**KELLY:** Calm down. We’ve got all day. //[Sighs]// May you state your credentials for the record?\n\n**SUBJECT:** My name is Moshe Husik. Today’s the twenty-seventh, November nineteen fifty-nine.\n\n**KELLY:** Dr. Husik, on the night of the twenty-sixth you activated the… NICE? //[Kelly looks up from his clipboard].//\n\n//[Husik nods hastily.]//\n\n**KELLY:** … without Overseer approval to use anomalous Foundation equipment. Then, you activated it again this morning. Is that correct?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Yes.\n\n**KELLY:** Why?\n\n**SUBJECT:** To prevent the loss of life.\n\n**KELLY:** How clinical.\n\n**SUBJECT:** I’ll take that as a compliment.\n\n**KELLY:** And have you successfully prevented the loss of life?\n\n**SUBJECT:** No. Not yet, at least. You still have time to save yourself. The probability isn’t certain. Likely, but not certain.\n\n**KELLY:** //[Frowning]// Husik, I already told you I'm not in any danger. Do you know something I don't?\n\n**SUBJECT:** I can’t say. Or - rather, sorry. I mean that I don’t know what it is either. You were just the most probable.\n\n**KELLY:** You need to use your words. //Explain.// Run it by me, step by step. Don't worry if it's classified. I've got emergency credentials for this interrogation. Tell me. Why do you believe I'm going to die?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Ok. //[Exhales]// I’ll explain everything, everything.\n\n**KELLY:** Go ahead.\n\n**SUBJECT:** It started with an idea I had a few years back. Using [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED] to-\n\n**KELLY:** With [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]? That's impossible.\n\n**SUBJECT:** No, not at all. Since the Laplace transform of a superconclusive matrix yields numerically solvable differentials, the algorithm converges.\n\n**KELLY:** That's ingenious. But… I’m still skeptical. That's far too many variables.\n\n**SUBJECT:** Sure. But once you [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED], like some sort of sieve, you can start to precisely define a macroevent.\n\n**KELLY:** That's hardly a definition.\n\n**SUBJECT:** I know, bear with me. Luckily, if you can agglomerate-\n\n**KELLY:** This is all theoretical. You could never compute something this complex.\n\n**SUBJECT:** Maybe with traditional computers. But with [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]… the human mind becomes a computer itself.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**KELLY:** Husik, that's...horrendous.\n\n**SUBJECT:** Come on. When you were a researcher, every other week...well. We both know what you've done to the D-Class.\n\n**KELLY:** I did what was necessary.\n\n**SUBJECT:** Sure. It got you promoted, and now as a director I can only imagine-\n\n**KELLY:** Husik. I made sacrifices for the protection of mankind.\n\n**SUBJECT:** And so have I! And look where that got me? You need to protect yourself, goddammit!\n\n**KELLY:** Alright, alright! Just.. //[Kelly closes his eyes and rubs his temples]// Just settle down. We're getting off-topic. Back to what you were saying. You're telling me that [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]?\n\n**SUBJECT:** That's most of it. To the dot, even.\n\n//[Kelly leans back in his chair.]//\n\n**KELLY:** Theory’s solid. But how'd you get the [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED] to actually work?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Through [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED] interfacing. Although, I'm still unsure whether that's the optimal approach.\n\n**KELLY:** How do you write input for a machine like that?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Well, I hoped it could be verbal at first. But preliminary tests proved that text was… um… less ambiguous. Much more controllable. From there, we trained [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]\n\n**KELLY:** I would've never imagined. How many test cases do you have?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Eleven. Actually, thirteen. Eleven proper cases and two more inconclusive.\n\n**KELLY:** What do you mean?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Eleven cases where the events were both predicted and realized. All the specifics are in the report, but the predictions are generally very reliable. The events always happened.\n\n//[Subject pauses.]//\n\n**SUBJECT:** But we never intervened. I-um, we never acted proactively, and that's why-\n\n**KELLY:** Yes, I know. Run and hide. Don’t start. //[Kelly folds his hands.]// It’s interesting. Quite interesting. I assume I’m one of the two inconclusive test cases?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Yes.\n\n**KELLY:** And what was the other one?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Similar to yours, though I doubt the name will ring a bell. I couldn’t contact her in the timespan given. I assume she’s dead.\n\n**KELLY:** If I was to tell you that Ms. O’Tana is still alive and well, how would you feel?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Elated. If she could escape her fate, you can too.\n\n**KELLY:** It’s good to know that you still care.\n\n**SUBJECT:** Of course I do.\n\n**KELLY:** Husik… why'd you choose me?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Because…\n\n//[Subject takes a deep breath.]//\n\n**SUBJECT:** Come on. You're my friend, and I want you to be safe.\n\n//[Kelly smiles forcefully.]//\n\n**KELLY:** I believe you. I really do, Husik.\n\n**SUBJECT:**  Thank you.\n\n**KELLY:** And even if I didn't, protocol still dictates that I need to be placed under protection. Once I'm put away, they'll swap in someone else. Probably Drennan. You know she won't be as accommodating to you as I've been.\n\n//[Subject nods.]//\n\n**KELLY:** Until I’m in the clear, you’re going to have to hold out. I’ll shield myself from anything and everything, and when I’m done, I’ll get you out of this mess. You hear me?\n\n**SUBJECT:** Thank you. Thank you so much. I can’t thank you enough.\n\n**KELLY:** No worries. And for what it’s worth, you’re also one of the best friends I’ve ever made in this place.

You need to understand the gravity of the situation and keep quiet; there's a good reason everyone else piped down.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Cowardice?\n\n**KELLY:** Let me speak. Your relationship to Moshe Husik is terribly suspicious. You need to realize that. The Foundation protects people from things like Husik. We don’t usually help them. We don’t make anomalies, we contain them. It’s our purpose, it's the reason we’re all here.\n\n//[Hovsky does not speak.]//\n\n**KELLY:** Most of us didn’t choose to work here until anomalies forced their way into our lives. This is personal for a lot of us. You have to understand I'm trying to do what's best for everyone, Alexandra. Please, help me out here. I’m trying to do what’s best for everyone.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Husik… he’s been good to me.\n\n**KELLY:** Moshe was good to everyone. Yet, here we are.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I-I’m not going to turn my back on him.\n\n**KELLY:** I’m not asking you to do anything you don’t want to. Just, please, I want the truth. All of it. Tell me, how much of Husik’s theorem do you truly understand?\n\nHOVSKY: I.. uh. I understand it completely?\n\n//[Kelly raises her brow.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** Erm… the theorem’s almost inextricably linked to the NICE. The two were designed for each another. The NICE are still somewhat general-purpose, but… biocomputers work like normal computers, you know? The problem's more with understanding how they actually function as a whole, and I don't think anyone really gets all the nitty gritty details. So the theorem, I could easily run it, but I couldn't tell you why it works.\n\n//[Kelly continues in silence, watching intently.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** Um. I guess what I'm trying to say is that… //[clicks her tongue]//. Okay. So, for example, somebody actually solved the alpha node problem once, and that was it! Nobody ever needed to figure it out again. So, with Husik's theorem, I know what each part does, and I know how they work together. But I didn’t put it all together.\n\n**KELLY:** I see. Do the NICE pose any threat to human life?\n\n**HOVSKY:** What… what does that question mean?\n\n**KELLY:** Do you have any reason to believe a biocomputer would be willfully malicious?\n\n**HOVSKY:** No?\n\n**KELLY:** Are you certain?\n\n**HOVSKY:** I mean… oh. I get what this is about. I know that those neurons don't come empty. But they were D-Class, right? The worst of the worst. That's what they told us. They said they were up for death row. Just...scum. The type of people who aren’t fit for society.\n\n//[Hovsky swallows audibly.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:**  And...at least they aren't //dead// dead, you know? they aren't really alive, either—I mean, they aren't themselves. It’s not like they’re in pain you know? Besides, we're doing them a favor. They're saving lives now. We're stopping bad things from happening. Or...uh, more bad things. From happening. We aren't hurting anybody. Why would we do that? I...I'm sorry. I never wanted to hurt anybody.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**KELLY:** I didn't ask for moral justifications. I'll repeat. Do you have any reason to believe that a biocomputer might be willfully malicious?\n\n**HOVSKY:** No. It doesn't—it can't, um...\"will\". I-I guess? It's not free to \"will\", if that makes sense. There’s a set of parameters that it’s tasked to maximize or minimize, and that‘s all it does.\n\n**KELLY:** What parameters?\n\n**HOVSKY:** It's all technical. Optimization, that sort of thing.\n\n**KELLY:** Be specific, please.\n\n**HOVSKY:** [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED]\n\n**KELLY:** Ah.

Security footage shows her fleeing Site CONRAD, but personnel were unable to detain her. Recovery is presently considered a medium priority.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**3.** Regarding the Neural Interface Computational Engines (NICE)\n\n[[div style=\"text-indent:10px\"]]\n\n**3.1.** The NICE consist of [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED].\n\n**3.2.** [INFOHAZARD EXPUNGED] Hence, along with an approximate event time, the neural networking may associate terms to the event as well. A number of notable caveats surround the term-linking feature, mainly, the terms associated with the event may not be clearly linked to one another. Furthermore, the terms associated with the event may not be causally linked to the event, nor may the terms associated with the event offer meaningful interpretation. As such, the term-association function must be considered as a prototype feature.\n\n**3.3.** There has yet to be a failure in event prediction, albeit, the small sample size of thirteen cases is insufficient for estimating a true success rate. Nevertheless, a vague estimation of the time-to-event accuracy has shown that events always occur within an hour of the predicted time, which, for all practical purposes thus far, is sufficiently precise. Due to these predictions, four containment breaches were swiftly resolved with minimal casualties. Another three anomalies were identified, secured, and contained with predictive assistance. However, the last three events predicted by the NICE have earned the most notoriety.\n\n**3.4.** The first event predicted the death of Senior Researcher O’Tana. Without express consent of the Foundation, Husik evaluated this event from 17:21, 11/26/1959 to 6:58, 11/27/1959. No intervention was made on account of the holiday, during which all other members of the Department of Applied Mathematics chose to take the days off. The death was predicted for 7:24, 11/27/1959, with terms most associated with the event being ‘snow’, ‘leather’, ‘light’, ‘tree’, and ‘lavender’. It is unknown why O'Tana was chosen for prediction, as is the reason for the event of death being chosen for evaluation, since there are no significant instances of disease, injury, trauma, or personal animosity in her record. The researcher’s only known relation to Husik was a brief period of coworking in June 1956, prior to Husik's promotion to Head of the department. The two have not had direct relations or correspondence since then. Regardless, O’Tana died on the morning of 11/27/1959. when a driver found her car crashed into a tree on the side of a road. It is assumed she slid across the ice and lost control of her vehicle.\n\n**3.5.** The second event predicted the death of Site Director Kelly. This computation was initiated immediately after the prior computation, and was completed at 23:34, 11/27/1959. The death was predicted for 7:25, 11/29/1959. The terms most associated with the event were ‘blood’, ‘soldier’, ‘teeth’, ‘white’, and ‘concrete’. Similar to Senior Researcher O’Tana, Kelly was healthy and lacked personal adversaries. The director considered himself a close friend of Husik's and the two regularly convened to discuss shared interests. Husik contacted Director Kelly at 23:35, calling his home phone from site CONRAD, reporting his own unauthorized usage of the NICE. As awareness of the situation grew, Kelly was placed under protection with heavy surveillance in a standard onsite humanoid containment cell. Nevertheless, an unrelated containment breach resulted in his death at 7:13, 11/29/1959.\n\n**3.6.** The third and final event has still not occurred, as it is expected for 9:48, 12/06/1959. Its computation was programmed to automatically initiate at 00:01, 11/27/1959, and at 19:04 of the same day the computation was finished. It predicted the death of Overseer [REDACTED]. The most associated terms were ‘moon’, ‘quiet’, ‘howl’, ‘black’, and ‘water’.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**4.** Conclusion\n\n[[div style=\"text-indent:10px\"]]\n\n**4.1.** It is recommended that all personnel found to be empathetic to Moshe Husik are to be secured, amnestied, and immediately reassigned to other departments.\n\n**4.2.** It is recommended that Husik be immediately registered as an anomalous entity and contained.\n \n**4.2.** It is recommended that the NICE be left sealed and monitored.

All further documentation may only be obtained with proper clearance from the Memetics and Infohazards Division.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Item #:** SCP-CONRAD\n\n----\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n----\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All information regarding the derivation SCP-CONRAD-1 or any of its components is to be expunged. All schematics, research, and specific descriptions of the NICE are to be expunged as well. Individuals exposed to SCP-CONRAD-2 are to be amnesticized and subjected to appropriate disciplinary action.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-CONRAD-1 is an algorithm which approximates a solution to the Husik macrostatisical evaluation theorem, only known to be computable by the NICE housed at Site CONRAD.\n\nSCP-CONRAD-2 is a memetic infohazard caused by SCP-CONRAD-1, spread by means of verbal or written communication detailing the algorithm’s operation. The infohazard’s effects are, in all cases observed, a strong desire to make use of the algorithm, the urge to explain it to others, and intense, paranoid, cognitive impairment. These symptoms are self-reinforcing, growing in severity as the anomaly propagates. As a result, the spread of the contagion first appears as a mild interest before rapidly escalating to a critical point of social obsession, incoherence, and destructive behavior.\n\n----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Addendum CONRAD-a: History\" hide=\"▼ Addendum CONRAD-a: History\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\nA method to evaluate large scale probabilities using organic computation machines was first theorized by Dr. Moshe Husik in the Summer of 1953, with rigorous proof being elaborated in late 1956. First published in May 1957, the method was circulated within the internal journals of the Foundation’s Department of Applied Mathematics. Following the Dublin Incident, funding was allocated to the development of the Neural Interface Computational Engines (NICE), biological computers capable of approximating the absolute convergence of the Husik theorem. The computers were finalized in April of 1959.\n\nIntended as a means to prevent containment breaches and catastrophes, authorization to use anomalous techniques was given to construct the NICE, although the subsequent anomalous effects were unforeseen. The success of the project warranted further investment until misuse led to the discovery of SCP-CONRAD-2 and the dissolution of the Department of Applied Mathematics.\n\nOnce identified as a memetic agent, steps were taken to isolate research. Crucially, since the biocomputers were designed expressly for solving SCP-CONRAD-1, it is possible to reverse engineer the circumstances of SCP-CONRAD's emergence through intensive study of the NICE. As such, the personnel tasked with developing the biomachinery were amnesticized and transferred to other projects to prevent memetic contagion. However, as a result, there are no remaining personnel both knowledgeable and willing to research the anomaly-- (See Addendum CONRAD-b).\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Addendum CONRAD-b: Recovery\" hide=\"▼ Addendum CONRAD-b: Recovery\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\nOn 11/06/1974, a raid on a Global Occult Coalition safehouse recovered Foundation defector Alexandra Hovsky, who cited ideological convictions as her rationale for fleeing during the initial discovery of SCP-CONRAD. Hovsky is currently the sole remaining researcher capable of understanding SCP-CONRAD-1 and the technical operation of the NICE.\n\nIn accordance with Ethics Committee resolution, she is to receive no disciplinary retaliation under the condition that she comply with researching SCP-CONRAD. Due to the immobility of the NICE, Site CONRAD has been developed into a research site for cognitohazardous anomalies. Moreover, in order to avoid dissemination of the infohazard, all documents produced by Hovsky are quarantined. The chamber which stores the NICE along with the adjunct archival storage and office space of the Department of Applied Mathematics have been reconfigured into a unilaterally isolated containment unit.\n\nUntil the development of more advanced methods to curtail cognitohazardous anomalies, Hovsky’s research is to be contained.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Archived Document 7865-A1-1975]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"margin:-1em;margin-top: -0.6em\"]]\n\nFrom: coopermcc@foundation.intranet\nTo: overseer@foundation.intranet\nSent: 12:29 PM, February 7th, 1975\nSubject: CONRAD Committee Resolution\n\nLatoya,\n\nHere’s from the latest Ethics Committee hearing.\n\nCormick\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0; border-bottom: dashed 0.15rem rgb(var(--general-border-color));\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 3em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"ethics_memo\"]]\nUnder the Foundational Mandate, the Ethics Committee is granted final arbitration on the wording, implementation, and revision of any and all Special Containment Procedures.

If I'm the only one here, then I'll do whatever the hell I want.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I guess it's probably gonna be good for me, too. Mentally, I mean.

It's a luxury I didn't realize I had. Hot showers and all. I enjoyed them. They were so relaxing.\n\n**HOVSKY:**  I'm not really sure how it broke. Or what broke, or why.\n\n//[Hovsky exhales.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** On another note, I've actually started doing origami. Yeah //[chuckles]//, that's what it's come down to. Tearing out pages from old manuals and folding paper cranes.\n//[Hovsky taps her fingers.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** At least I have cold water.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**6 TESTIMONIES OMITTED**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 06/18/1970\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** I found the file on the SCiPNET. Right between some funny house and a cult. And the worst part about it? I'm not even in it. Not a single mention.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I’m not letting it get me down, though. I’m not //that// self-centered. Besides, the article is, well… inaccurate. That’s being gentle. It’s so littered with misconceptions that it astonishes me that I ever worked for these people. The incompetence. It’s pathetic… offensive, even. But it also explains a lot.\n\n**HOVSKY:** See, I figured I'd been quarantined for my work with the Coalition. I applied what Husik taught me then put it to work processing massive quantities of data. We cracked the human genome and started curing diseases that didn't even exist yet. We were decades ahead of the Foundation when it came to biotech. So I assumed that they assumed that I was carrying pathogens. Makes sense, right? I thought so.\n\n**HOVSKY:** But no. Turns out they managed to destroy our data completely. Not only did they never ask me about my research at the GOC, never even knew about my research.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Maybe it was an oversight on my part. I mean, I definitely could've put the pieces together myself, but I just never considered such a wildly stupid alternative… You know why they locked me up?  I doubt you could imagine. A fucking infohazard.\n\n**HOVSKY:** //A memetic infohazard//.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Yes. You heard me right. That gibberish was written down by somebody with an actual doctorate. Comical. You can’t make this shit up. A memetic infohazard.\n\n**HOVSKY:** It’s not that I don’t believe an infohazard could exist-//in theory//. Wouldn't be the strangest thing I've seen. I mean, I know that somebody was seriously floating the idea of a Memetics Department right before the whole controversy. But designating the NICE and then a nonexistent infohazard as two different anomalies? Absurd. I reloaded the page thrice to make sure I was reading correctly.\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:**  And I can't… what they did to Moshe. They fucking killed him, and they didn't even have the balls to list the cause of death. I bet they killed Kelly, too, and just pinned the whole thing on Moshe. Because he was unlucky. Because he grew up in a cult and raised people's eyebrows everywhere he went. It was convenient.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Or maybe it was just his pure fucking heart, ready to whistleblow on the overseers. And after everything he did for them, for their Foundation, they just gave him a number and left him to die.\n\n//[Hovsky sighs.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** I've said enough. I'll keep letting out my anger on the concrete floor.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 06/25/1970\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Found a memo from right after I left. Buried in archival limbo. Almost half of it's blacked out, but I could piece things together.\n\n**HOVSKY:** It's for the O5s, pretty much explaining the whole situation with Moshe for anyone who wasn't already keeping tabs on it. There's a recommended course of action, which they obviously followed to the letter. Which means they locked up Moshe and doped up anybody left with questions. And then they sealed up this room and forgot about it.\n\n**HOVSKY:** My guess? Husik caught wind of something foul. That Thanksgiving, I'd invited him over to my family's dinner. I'm sure Kelly and the others did too. After all, we all knew he didn't have a family to celebrate with. He'd always spent Thanksgiving with me, and Christmas at Kelly's. And we always went to that stupid Department New Year Party together. So...so we'd assumed he'd be out for Thanksgiving, with someone or another. But for whatever reason, that day, he decided to go to work. Alone.\n\n**HOVSKY:** What he did was just...so strange. Unordinary. He started talking about that theorem all the time, going on and on about all the lives we could save, all calamities we could avoid. He said we could save tens, hundreds, thousands of lives at a time. It started out big-picture.\n\n//[Hovsky swallows.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** But then he started predicting deaths. He set the NICE inputs to evaluate individual deaths. And not just once, for one person. Multiple times, for multiple people.\n\n**HOVSKY:** He knew something we didn’t. That has to be it.\n\n**HOVSKY:** That’s why I’m sure Husik got caught up in something he wasn’t supposed to. He wasn't stupid. He wouldn't have chosen those specific people if he didn't already think they would die. He didn’t take shots in the dark, he just needed to know //when// they'd die.\n\n//[Hovsky pauses.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** But he failed. Whatever he was trying to prevent, it happened anyway. He didn’t have the time, leverage, or influence. They got to him, and they made it quick. Got rid of everybody fast.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I was the only one who got out. After the second interrogation, I found a note in my locker. Moshe. He told me to run, said they were going to use those experimental amnestics. So I ran. I trusted him, and he saved me, but…\n\n//[Hovsky exhales.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** Now it's been eleven years. I finally got caught. The dust's already settled, so they put me to work dealing with the skeletons in Moshe's closet. The NICE are useful, after all, and I'm the only person alive who still understands them.\n\n//[Hovsky laughs.]//\n\n**HOVSKY:** And they think I’ll help them.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**5 TESTIMONIES OMITTED**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 10/25/1970\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** I forgot to add a little update to the digging.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I’ve broken through!

Ugh. They’re fucked up. I don’t know how to explain it properly. I don't know if a term even exists to describe the condition they’re in. These people are so incompetent. Dear god.\n\n**HOVSKY:** They didn’t feed the NICE. Yeah, the biocomputers. I thought that was something obvious enough to most people when they hear anything with the prefix “bio” tacked on the front. It’s a biological computer. Biology. Like, life. As in alive, you know? The computers need food.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Almost all of the neural cortex is dead. Fully dead. I can regrow it, yes, but it’s still braindead. The rest? It’s been cannibalizing itself in a bitter struggle to survive. There’s about a handful of cells that survived. I mean that literally, mind you.\n\n**HOVSKY:** All I wanted to do was check the logs. I didn’t even want to use the biological complex. I just wanted to see the history of all previous evaluations. But no. Of course not. Things can’t be that simple for me. Never. Turns out the interfacing between the hard storage and display are biologically interpreted. So I can’t see them yet. Because the most of the biocomputers are, and I’ll say it again for those in the back, fucking //dead//.\n\n**HOVSKY:** //[groans]// I don’t know if I should cry or punch a wall. I'm gonna need to feed this thing my own food. They hardly give me enough to feed myself. Rather, they give me just enough to feed myself. It’s the bare minimum of calories to sustain myself. And now I'm gonna starve to fix the mess they made me.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I suppose that's karma. I’ve been locked in this room for months to study this machine, and I haven’t until now. It took months, yes months, for me to take a good look at my research object and notice that, well, it’s dead. I probably could’ve saved myself weeks of food if I’d realized sooner.\n\n//[Hovsky curses repeatedly.]//\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► HOVSKY-1971\" hide=\"▼ HOVSKY-1971\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 01/02/1971\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** I’ve gone over the math.

It's hard to keep track of time lately and, honestly, I don't really want to. There’s this fog in my head stopping me from getting anything done. It hurts sometimes.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Everything keeps piling up. I’m getting lazier. I’m not cleaning up after myself like I used too. Sometimes I snap out of it, realize I’m doing nothing. Most of the time I’m staring at my computer. I wake up everyday, walk a few feet to my desk, and //click//, //click//, and //click//. Lying around, rotting away. The only productive things I do now are in these little moments of lucidity. And then I have another episode and lose myself again.\n\n**HOVSKY:** But I’ve been a bit better this week. I tidied up a bit, and got back to working. I keep on going over that interview with Husik. There’s something he wants to say but doesn’t know how. There’s something there. I don’t know what it is, but I know that he left me the clues to figure it out.\n\n**HOVSKY:** It isn’t a hunch. You haven’t spent years staring at this machine like I have. I know it inside out. I went back and proved all of our formulas again. I went over the stats. I checked the logs. I did everything. I know this algorithm inside and out,  I figure I understand it as well as Husik did now. It’s not anomalous, emphatically. I’m looking for something I know isn’t here.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I just need to prove that the NICEs are entirely mundane. Not to my eyes, but to someone else’s. I know I’ve had my doubts, but year after year I just keep coming back to the same result: there’s nothing here. There is no anomaly.\n\n**HOVSKY:** It dawned on me that they’re monitoring my vitals. Somehow, I’m not sure. I don’t think they would be sending food down a hatch otherwise,  and they must have //some// expectation that I’ll produce research.\n\n**HOVSKY:** My guess is that there's somebody whose whole job is to read these potentially infohazardous documents. Since they think the infohazard has something to do with the NICE’s algorithm, I can hypothetically relay information that isn’t apparently infohazardous, but still disprove their theory upon later examination.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I know I'm grasping at straws.

How could I use the NICE in such a way that disproved an infohazard’s existence? If there was an anomaly, how could they monitor my mental well-being? And how could they distinguish anomalous deterioration from normal deterioration?\n\n**HOVSKY:** So I thought to myself: every successful prediction is proof that I used the algorithm. But, I can lie. What if I pronounced three different prompts, without all of them being true? What if I pronounced five? Seven? Ten? Every false prediction is proof that I did not suffer the supposed infohazard’s symptoms. Not to mention, there’s a timely aspect to this. I have to make a prediction every week or so, since that’s just how long the computation takes.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Starting with that, I can create a blind test. I’ve racked my brain about it, and I think it’s impossible to generate a double-blind. Still though, if after, say, fifteen, twenty cases, it is obvious that my brain chemistry hasn’t been anomalously altered, then I’ll be free? Right? That’s just stats. Cold, hard numbers.\n\n**HOVSKY:** I know some prompts can’t be calculated, they’ll run-off forever. I just need to input something unambiguous, and entirely unpredictable without NICE's assistance.\n\n**HOVSKY:** So here goes nothing. For the next few entries I’ll read off the report summaries verbatim. I’ll save them as text files onto the SCiPNET local terminal. I’ll print them too. I'll make it impossible for anyone watching to miss.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n**DATE:** 06/02/1973\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Prompt: When will the U.S. President and General Secretary of the Soviet Union next converse?\n\n**HOVSKY:** Elastic regression factor “E” prime is set at seven point twelve [[$( E’ = 7.12 ). $]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Runtime “T” sub “r” is equal to twelve days, seventeen hours, twenty-six minutes, ten seconds, and thirty-eight milliseconds ([[$ t_r $]] = 12d 17h 26m 10s 38ms).\n\n**HOVSKY:** “Alpha” sub “v” is equal to point eight two three six with an error of two ten-thousandths [[$( \\alpha_v  = 0.8236  \\pm 2\\cdot10^{-4} ).$]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Positive zeta correlation confirmed.\n\n**HOVSKY:** Event dated to ten o’ two, June sixteenth, nineteen seventy-three (10:02, June 16th, 1973).\n\n**HOVSKY:** Associate terms are “sunlight”, “tea”, “ice”, “granite”, and “saliva”.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n\n**DATE:** 06/24/1973\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Prompt: When will the New York Yankees next defeat the Boston Red Sox?\n\n**HOVSKY:** Elastic regression factor “E” prime is set at six point ninety-two [[$( E’ = 6.92 ). $]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Runtime “T” sub “r” is equal to twenty-one days, twelve hours, eleven minutes, fifty-nine seconds, and twenty-three milliseconds ([[$ t_r $]] = 21d 12h 11m 59s 23ms).\n\n**HOVSKY:** “Alpha” sub “v” is equal to point seven nine eight one with an error of one ten-thousandth [[$( \\alpha_v  = 0.7981  \\pm \\cdot10^{-4} ).$]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** Positive zeta correlation confirmed.October 6, 1981\n\n**HOVSKY:** Event dated to three fifteen, July third, nineteen seventy-three (03:15, July 3rt, 1973).\n\n**HOVSKY:** Associate terms are “chalk”, “grass”, “summer”, “wood”, and “skin”.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**7 TESTIMONIES OMITTED**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** 09/11/1973\n**Note:** Reduced for the sake of brevity.\n\n----\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**HOVSKY:** //[mumbling]// I don’t think I can do twenty.

Inaction may prove to worsen her mental state by fueling self-doubt.\n\n• Increasingly apparent symptoms of cognitive impairment are demonstrated. Namely, the method by which Hovsky aims to prove her sanity is exceedingly tenuous. Consider:\n@@ @@ • It is known that usage of the NICE (thereby, exposure to the anomaly), leads to a strong desire to make further use of the SCP-CONRAD, the urge to explain it to others, and intense, paranoid, cognitive impairment.\n@@ @@ • If Hovsky accurately predicts an event which she could not without usage of the NICE, it is uncontroversial evidence of exposure to the infohazard, and therefore, should lead to the aforementioned symptoms.\n@@ @@ • If Hovsky inaccurately predicts an event, it is proof the anomaly does not produce its supposed symptoms, since she withheld from using the machine and/or withheld from sharing it with others.\n@@ @@ • Over time, by balancing true and false predictions, it may be safely concluded whether or not the symptoms of SCP-CONRAD are correctly described in its documentation. \n\n• Despite the feasibility of the method, Hovsky is incoherent and fails to properly articulate the proper, logical train of thought expected of a highly-educated Foundation researcher. This may be considered a preliminary indicator of exposure to infohazardous effects.\n\n• Moreover, in the circumstance that Hovsky’s method proves her sanity, it does not disprove the existence of SCP-CONRAD. Instead, it only disproves our current understanding of its anomalous functionality.\n\n• Hovsky continues to make multiple displays of distress and delusion.

Use of noospheric tracing to delineate query boundaries is authorized to identify possible targets who, in turn, are to be detained and undergo conceptual reshuffling until they are released by SCP-7865-2. In response to a PRONUNCIATION event, these individuals must be secured and executed safely.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-7865-1 is a set of biological computers located at Site CONRAD, known as the Neural Interface Computational Engines (NICE). Each engine comprises an assemblage of sixteen conjoined neural masses housed in three chambers, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid. The assemblages are coupled with a classic electronic transistor computer and a basic biological subsistence framework.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-7865/1200px-Colossus.jpg |caption=Last surviving image of SCP-7865-1’s development, under the operation of SCP-7865-3 (left). |width=400px]]\n\nThe computers operate by interpreting text prompts through a superconclusive biological matrix to recursively integrate macrostatistical events, effectuating an algorithm which converges on solutions to the Husik macrostatiscal evaluation theorem. As per the theorem, convergence is only achieved for high-likelihood events. Unlikely events or ambiguous prompts will result in a failure to track noetic point-alignment, generating extremely long or infinite runtimes. Thus, artificial conceptual reshuffling is considered the most effective method to prolong runtimes, which will eventually force the cessation of a prompt’s query.\n\nSCP-7865-2 is an infovore deployed by usage of the Husik theorem. The entity enables the NICE to increase the likelihood of a queried event, inducing convergent solutions. Analysis has demonstrated statistically unlikely rhizomatic associations invariably associated with PRONUNCIATION events. As such, it is presumed the infovore is capable of influencing noospheric conditions in order to promote the occurrence of events beyond its physical vicinity.\n\nSCP-7865-3 is the provisional designation for the former Foundation junior researcher Alexandra Hovsky. It is currently sealed within SCP-7865-1's containment chamber at Site CONRAD, granting it control over SCP-7865's primary anomaly.\n\nHovsky is hostile to the Foundation and has targeted multiple Foundation personnel with SCP-7865-1, producing death sentences. Instances in which these sentences are announced are referred to as SCP-7865-PRONUNCIATION events within internal protocol.\n\nIt is considered impossible to neutralize SCP-7865 prior to January 14th, 1981.\n\n----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Addendum 7865-a: History\" hide=\"▼ Addendum 7865-a: History\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\nSCP-7865-1 was created by the defunct Department of Applied Mathematics in the late 1950s at Site CONRAD. It was intended as a means to prevent containment breaches and catastrophes. Authorization to use anomalous techniques was given to construct it, although its consequent anomalous effects were unforeseen. Initially, the success of the project warranted further investment, until misuse led to the discovery of SCP-7865-2. This resulted in the death of many senior research staff and the dissolution of the Department of Applied Mathematics.\n\nSCP-7865-2 initially was misidentified as a memetic agent, and steps were taken to isolate its research. Accordingly, due to the immobility of the biocomputers, Site CONRAD gradually was developed into a research site for cognitohazardous and antimemetic anomalies. Over time, it became the central locus of the Antimemetic Division. However, further innovations in noetic visualization technologies and retrospective investigation into PRONUNCIATION events have proven the existence of the infovore.\n\nConcurrently, Alexandra Hovsky had defected from the Foundation in the late 1950s, during the incident in which the NICE were first misused. Given the potential applications of the NICE, Hovsky was reinstated as the lead researcher for SCP-7865 following her recovery in 1969. Under the pretense of a potential infohazard, she was quarantined within the containment cell of the biocomputers.\n\nOn January 7th 1975, SCP-7865-3 initiated its first PRONOUNCIATION event, resulting in the near total destruction of Site CONRAD. This event renewed interest in the anomaly and led to its current reclassification. In an effort to avert future catastrophe, the site has been converted into a modernized containment zone solely dedicated to SCP-7865. The previous staff of the site, pertaining to the Antimemetics Division, have since been fully relocated to the division’s main hub, Site 167.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► Incident Log CONRAD-7865-73\" hide=\"▼ Incident Log CONRAD-7865-73\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INCIDENT REPORT**\n\n------\n\n**INCIDENT #:** CONRAD-7865-73\n\n**DATE OF OCCURRENCE:** 1975/02/12\n\n------\n\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[06:00]** All Site CONRAD personnel are alerted as specified by lockdown protocol.

Koans volunteers on Everhart's behalf.\n\n**[06:51]** Drennan is detained in a containment cell, while Koans is detained in Everhart's office.\n\n**[06:55]** The specialist notices the prior notification regarding Drennan's messages.\n\n**[06:56]** He convinces a pair of MTF Epsilon-11 members to escort him in an attempt to locate the unidentified antimemetic anomaly.\n\n**[07:00]** Koans begins to experience symptoms of mnestic overexposure, including impairment of cognitive function.\n\n**[07:01]** Koans mistakenly attempts to access SCP-7865's containment cell, triggering a sitewide alarm. The Epsilon-11 members immediately terminate him.\n\n**[07:02]** The sudden alarm causes the standoff to escalate into open combat. All MTF members within the site immediately rush toward the administrative wing.\n\n**[07:10]** During the crossfire, Site CONRAD's water utilities are damaged. This causes the faulty water heating unit in SCP-7865's wing to burst, flooding the site infrastructure through a hole dug by SCP-7865-3.\n\n**[07:11]** Damage to the site's generators cause a sitewide blackout to occur. Video footage is lost for the majority of the site.\n\n**[07:12]** The remaining Epsilon-11 units are immediately deployed. Upon reaching the administrative wing, they are fired upon by personnel within the site. Due to the power outage, units are unable to discern the affiliations of personnel within the site.\n\n**[07:13]** Epsilon-11 units receive authorization to return fire and begin indiscriminately terminating hostiles within the site.\n\n**[07:14]** [REDACTED]\n\n**[07:16]** Backup generators activate. Director Everhart is confirmed deceased. Hostilities continue among site personnel.\n\n**[07:20]** Drennan is not found.\n\n**[07:24]** [REDACTED]\n\n**[07:55]** Site CONRAD is cleared of all threats.\n\n[[div style=\"margin: 2em 0;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Archived Document 7865-A1-1981]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"margin:-1em;margin-top: -0.6em\"]]\n\nFrom: williamsml@foundation.intranet\nTo: overseer@foundation.intranet\nSent: 10:33 AM, May 13th, 1981\nSubject: Resignation\n\nThere we go, we’ve done it. SCP-7865 has been confirmed as neutralized. Let’s all give ourselves a pat on the back. We did it, we’ve slain that terror of our own creation.\n\nLet the records show that on January 14th 1981 we obliterated Alexandra Hovsky. In fact, the wholesale deletion of containment Site CONRAD should be remarked upon as the most steadfast and complete destruction of non-anomalous property by the Foundation to date. Moreover, the most thorough and unmitigated elimination of a singular, mundane person. Now, in the ruins of that small apocalypse, we are left to press ourselves the question: Why?\n\nSCP-7865 hails from a long legacy of Foundation-backed predictive technology. Each has their own advantages and drawbacks. Anomalies like [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-377 SCP-377] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1244 SCP-1244] give trustworthy predictions, but lack directability. Some, like [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-411 SCP-411] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-552 SCP-552] are psychologically hindered by their own anomalous capabilities. Other objects, such as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3324 SCP-3324] prove themselves to be excessively intrusive, going as far as to potentially alter causality to ensure their predictions. Even the most reliable options, such as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2412 SCP-2412] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-657 SCP-657] aren’t perfect, with their conditions severely restricting their usage. Developing a general-purpose, remotely actionable predictor has been sought after for generations. Ever since it’s been theorized, and shown to be vaguely possible, the Foundation has funded the research. Dozens of well-grounded attempts have been made. Hundreds more will inevitably be made. To say it simply, SCP-7865 was utterly unexceptional. For our standards, perhaps even ordinary.\n\nYet, it warranted unprecedented backlash. When we stormed CONRAD, we made sure every facet of the operation was secure - not a single drop of resistance could be tolerated. Meticulously, we worked to prevent any possibility of retaliation, empowered with the highest scrutiny of science: AI-assisted cognitohazard filters, Scranton stabilizers, three separate mobile MTF units, noospheric topologists, ontokinetic disruptors, and mnestic specialists were all deployed for the neutralization attempt. All the while, an overhead orbital cannon aligned itself for emergency pulverization as a myriad of conceptual applicators scrambled the literal idea of Alexandra Hovsky.\n\nThat which remains of SCP-7865 is a pit in the ground. Containment Site CONRAD was positively removed from the face, and guts, of the Earth. Hovsky is “presumed” dead.\n\nYes, it is no secret that this was revenge. Justice, at best, was an afterthought. In the time I've served as O5-3's personal assistant, I'd grown numb; it never struck me as odd that they were the vengeful sort. After all, I had my own vendettas. This isn’t an industry known for dragging in the kind-hearted.\n\nSo, I was unfazed that day when SCP-7865 showed up in my inbox. It was another email to answer. Between the pattern screamers and blood rituals, it was just another file in the archives. Truth be told, the only impression it left on me was that of a deep, earnest annoyance. That’s what happens when the Ethics Committee gets involved. The emails become meetings, and suddenly you have to pretend you care.\n\nBut weeks after Hovsky became another nameless pile of ash, I couldn't stop asking why. How could we have been so careless? How’d such a commonplace, possibly beneficial research endeavor quickly escalate into one of the largest internal threats the Foundation’s ever handled? Were we truly as incompetent as she'd seemed to believe? There have been Class IV reality benders and imminent XK-Class scenarios that have killed less overseers than SCP-7865. All while Hovsky, the immortal mastermind behind it, was otherwise completely mundane.\n\nAfter O5-3's death finally passed, I found myself suddenly free to scour the entirety of SCP-7865's documentation. I’ve got a heavy-duty binder with over three thousand pages about every possible detail - archived paperwork, inquest files, council memos. I interviewed the people in Information Security that redact the data. I stitched shredded sheets back together. I've even got x-ray analyses of blacked-out sentences.\n\nDon't call it an obsession; I do my job, and make sure to do it well. Though, throughout my entire career in the Foundation, never has a paper trail been so hard to follow. Individual reports seemed to differ drastically between iterations, and conflicting stories came from the same people. Protocol and legislation were nonexistent. All the while, the pressing question of \"why?\" echoed in my mind.\n\nThere's something that remains unspoken. Or, arguably, there’s something which we chose not to hear. It was always there. A realization that Hovsky had many years after Husik decided to bite his tongue. Unspoken, albeit well understood.\n\nIt is certain, beyond any statistical doubt, that SCP-7865-2 does not and has never existed. Continued topological observation of the conceptual constellation associated with SCP-7865-2 has unmistakably proven its preserved existence. With contemporary developments in conceptual mapping, the fact is irrefutable: SCP-7865-2's rhizomatic framework consists of nothing more than itself. It was an unbelievable oversight, akin to a child mistaking a crane for folded paper.\n\nBut it'd be a greater mistake to believe that it was nothing more than a childish naivete. If Hovsky figured it out, then surely, at least Drennan must have realized as well. Is it really plausible that the people who’ve worked on this problem the longest failed to understand it? After one year? After five years? After a decade?\n\nIt’s hubris. An honest, abject conceit forced its hand against admitting that a miscalculation was once made. We’d made a deal with Hovsky. The Ethic Committee was watching. It’s not like we could just knock on CONRAD’s door and say sorry. That’d mean someone else was in the wrong. That’d mean it was someone else’s fault. That would mean someone else should’ve been punished. And we couldn’t let that happen.\n\nSCP-7865 was made an anomaly. We made a file. We reclassified. We redesignated. Pepper some misinformation here, place a tight-lipped division there. As long as Hovsky’s contained.\n\nWe primed the circumstances which guaranteed SCP-7865 its reign. Hovsky was right. As was Husik before her. There was never any anomaly to be found. We were looking for nothing. When Hovsky discovered the date of her death to be wildly beyond any of her own expectations, she finally came to understand the truth, for all the significance it really had. Our arrogance was abused to exact the revenge she deserved.\n\nFor that crime, we punished her. The beast once named Alexandra Hovsky was bewildered, gaunt, and elderly the day I killed her. We had stopped sending her food weeks prior to the operation. The PRONUNCIATION events ceased, her SCiPNET terminal became inactive, and she stopped recording her journal entries. Still, her vitals somehow demonstrated a stubborn livelihood. It was not enough to let her die in silence.\n\nWe opened the vault and found her feral, scared, and alone. The fluorescent light bulbs had all burned out. Outside the dim glow of computer monitors, she lived in the dead, quiet dark. She shied away, hissing at the floodlights. The brightness revealed the dried blood caking the skin around her mouth and down her chin, staining her matted hairs and long, scraggly nails. It became apparent that she survived by dining on the sprawling, cancerous mass of the NICE’s brain. It had taken its toll.\n\nThat diseased thing was irretrievable. It needed to be put down. We annihilated it, cauterizing the wound we left in this world.\n\n[[div id=\"u-hiddenLink\" style=\"display:inline-block; margin:0em; margin-top: -1em\"]] \nI’ll be the first to take [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7865/offset/1 responsibility]. On account of our treatment of SCP-7865, I am stepping down from my position as Overseer Representative.
