Arcana Cards.\n\nEvery monster of the night could be bound, its essence stripped away and stored in an Arcana Card, a tool so safe even the young could be trusted to carry them.\n\nThat the young could take them to War.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nHerein lies the transmutation of Arcana-7375 from V̅CLXXV .\n[[=]]\n+ Night 1: First Blood\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Arcanalamp Muscription**\n**Waxing Crescent, Thermidor**\n**Year of Salt and Cypress**\n\n------\n\nScene: a murder foul.\nBlood spilled upon barrack stone\nThin in red moonlight.\n\nA young boy lies dead\nHair wild, neck cleanly cut.\nResolved.

Every meal a battle, every day a test, underestimated and misunderstood by the other children. My only moments of peace reading the tales of the Fundamentum's great heroes and training in the woods.\n\nBut even then I knew I was different, that I wasn't like the other children, that I wasn't like those sniveling cowards, I was better than them. I knew I had a great destiny, and I was righteous and true.\n\nAll of us were orphans, but I was an Orphan. To be an Orphan is something that is the birthright of the foundling, the changeling, the future hero. They engaged in their petty schoolyard fights, carving out their meaningless hierarchies, while I found my truths in tales of knights and castles and chivalry, from a time long forgotten, a time before the night.\n\nWhen the Ghastly Men came, those thieves of children in the night, the other striplings would flee and make themselves small -- but I knew in my heart that they were not thieves. They were the watchers of the gates of adventure, and so I presented myself -- frail but sprightly, foolish but resolved -- to them. And they took me. \n\nThey were the Fundamentum, those who Guarded at the Foundation of All Things, and they told me my true heritage. My father had been a scion of the ancient and noble houses of Dezmond, who had given his life in service to Xerophylla against the Ogre King Ferdinand, and I had been exiled to an orphanage by avaricious and conniving relatives. They offered me a choice: \n\nThey could restore me to my station and vanish from my life like ghosts in the wind, or they could teach me, train me, make me lethal -- and I could exact such terrible revenges myself.\n\nI chose the latter.\n\nFor there is a sword in a stone awaiting in my dreams.\n[[/div]]\n\nProgressing towards level.\n\n//Approved by Professor C.O. Gears//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anderson-Mab Pactborne Dream Theft**\n\n**Requisition:** #3296202\n\n**Victim:** Damien Lawrence Woodcock\n\n------\n\nThat night, I woke. Soon, I found myself before a great door, not having remembered gone there.\n\nIt is a curious thing, the waking dream. I knew, perhaps, that I was crossing into something forbidden. That I was breaking some great and ancient taboo. \n\nThat is the first step every hero takes. To break the laws set forth by a society too foolish to understand him.\n\nBeyond that door was a great many artifacts. Suits of armor and statues and gargoyles, all indistinguishable from each other. Tens of cursed necklaces, hundreds of cursed rings.\n\nAnd thousands upon thousands of swords. But only one drew my eye.\n\nIt was a curious thing, in a style that I had never seen. Not the shifting blade of Professor Light, nor the greatsword of Professor Gears. No, this blade had the slightest curve to it that gleamed in the moonlight, and symbols I could not recognize embroidered upon the hilt.\n\nThere was an air of portent around it. I cannot describe it except to say it is as it always was in my dream. There was no stone, but there was a sword. And so I went forth to grasp it.\n\nYes, the sword whispered to me. This is true. This is right.\n\nAnd as I held that hilt between my hands and raised it to the moon, I knew this was what had always been my lot in life. What I had always been meant for.\n\nThis was a world of death, short and cold brutality. But through it all, there would be one who was noble, honest, and good. One who was true. One who knew death as his friend and lover against the unjust, yet fought for those who were noble.\n\nI, ##red|DEATH KNIGHT##.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Meeting Minutes**\n\n//Professor Sophia Light, Phlegm//\n//Headmaster Charles Gears, Bile//\n\n------\n\n**S. Light:** Neil Leinnes is dead. Choler class, first year. The murder, I think, is of Blood.\n\n**C. Gears:** Unfortunate. Is revival possible?\n\n**S. Light:** No. He went down Heroically. Defending the interests of Xerophylla from an infiltrator.\n\n**C. Gears:** Or fighting like a beast of the earth for his own life. But not an ambush. No cut to the throat from silent night. This entity is unlike the Stricken -- it does not act with subterfuge.\n\n**S. Light:** Perhaps -- or it knows us far too well. Perhaps it knows this is one of the few ways to kill us permanently.\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n+ Night 2: Fear\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Arcanalamp monitoring whisper**\n**Waxing Half, Thermidor**\n**Year of Salt and Cypress**\n\n//DLW (Tentative)//\n//Unidentified Spirit//\n\n------\n\n**DLW:** There is a lost princess of Xerophylla, stolen by the hordes of Darkest Evropa. I must save milady, and be rewarded with an honorable knighthood. Else I cannot redeem myself.\n\n**The spirit:** The taking of artifacts is dishonorable?\n\n**DLW:** Indeed, so I have dishonored myself.\n\n**The spirit:** Did those who stole me from Hinimoto have more honor than the hero who I speak to now?\n\n**DLW:** They were wiser than I.\n\n**The spirit:** By whose account? The thief's?\n\n**DLW:** Would it not be theft if I took this blade?\n\n**The spirit:** Was it not theft when they took me from my liege?\n\n**DLW:** If it was, then I have taken you. I am no better than them.\n\n**The spirit:** I am no idle hunk of steel. I chose you. In your hands, we can both grow in honor.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Arcanalamp Muscription**\n\n**Waxing Half, Thermidor**\n**Year of Salt and Cypress**\n\n------\n\nScene: A Coward, dead.\nHis back to the red moon,\nDied on his belly.\n\nA rare appearance,\nPaid with the wages of sin,\nWhich of course are death.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Anderson-Mab Pactborne Dream Theft**\n\n**Requisition:** #3296396\n\n**Victim:** Damien Lawrence Woodcock\n\n------\nThe coward fell beneath my blade, his skull split in twain as he tried to run.\n\nI knew him, but only in passing. Wozny, he was called. A Professor of the Blood class. His name was attached to a thousand petty trifles, the sorts of feats that make small men feel big. The Wozny Meal Rotation System. The Wozny Mural for the Class of 76. The Wozny Draft-Beast Side-Saddle Riding Recommendation.\n\nIt was no small wonder that he had been fully corrupted as an agent of the Ogre King Ferdinand.\n\nThe Fundamentum was at war. It had been at war against the forces of darkness long before my birth, and it would be at war until it finally won. The Arcana Institute was a hidden beacon in the endless night and the first line of defense. The best and brightest of the world's minds in the Bile Class. The orators and diplomats that held society together from the shadows in the Blood Class. The mages and artificers of glorious futures in the Choler Class. And heroes in the Phlegm Class.\n\nThe Ogre King was one of many great evils of Darkest Evropa, a beast of Gallic origin. It was jealous of the civilization of Xerophylla, of its great cities and great culture, of glory it could never be a part of from the harshness of Darkest Evropa. Ever since its birth, it had laid waste to Darkest Evropa, and made it a place where only the bravest dared tread.\n\nOne day, I would sojourn forth and slay him, and avenge my father, and bring light back to the world.\n\nThe Professors had sealed him, so he could not physically invade our glorious nation, but even still, his influence had seeped into the Institute. It had turned the noble men and women of the Fundamentum into plunderers, willing to steal a sacred sword from the distant eastern shores of Hinimoto. It had made saboteurs of students, like the first blood I ever drew, and even of Professors.\n\nOf Wozny.\n\nIt made an awful lot of sense. Why else would someone be so enamored with pointless glories, when they could instead serve and find true glory? To distract, to mislead, to confound. To turn the minds of others away from the great war to pointless self-enrichment.\n\nI wondered, looking at Wozny's blood, if this was what heroism meant. To kill the right people -- not even a person, really, one of Ferdinand's creatures -- and feel no remorse.\n\nFor I knew I was doing the right thing, purifying the Arcana Institute from within, yet my stomach felt clenched. My hands were cold around the hilt of my blade, and the distant stars swam in my vision.\n\nYes, a voice said, from deep within. This is how things must be.\n\nIt was not my voice. It was, perhaps, the voice of destiny. \n\nAnd yet I still felt ill.\n\nAnd then, the great voice of the sword appeared before me.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Arcanalamp monitoring whisper**\n**Waxing Half, Thermidor**\n**Year of Salt and Cypress**\n\n//DLW (Tentative)//\n//Unidentified//\n\n------\n\n**DLW:** You are the sending of a spirit!\n\n**The spirit:** You had not realized?\n\n**DLW:** Last night, when I slew the ogre, I thought your arms the wind, your mask a trick of the light upon my face. I drew your blade to strike and sheathed it when my task was done. But now I see you for what you are.\n\n**The spirit:** You do not seem shocked.\n\n**DLW:** There is a student, James No-Name. He tells us of a Joshua, son of Joseph, who I call Jojo and am told it is heresy. I do not understand this Jojo. James No-Name tells me that it is a part of a whole and yet also the whole, or perhaps the projection of a great artifact at the heart of the world; you are hardly more surprising. \n\n**The spirit:** I am no distant vision. I am here.\n\n**DLW:** Truly?\n\n**The spirit:** I am within the blade and have been there since I was stolen. Trapped within that prison, unable to act or to repair the harms I have done. Can you imagine what hell it is to be confined in such a way, with no sense or feeling but the cold of death and your own thoughts? Could you imagine what it is like to be without body, left only with purpose? To be left in a moonless room, waiting, hoping that whoever next calls you forth might be in the slightest way willing?\n\n**DLW:** I shudder to imagine such a fate.\n\n**The spirit:** Know that I chose you. And together, we shall make things right.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Meeting Minutes**\n\n//Headmaster Charles Gears, Bile//\n//Mr. Jeremy Filia//\n\n------\n\n**C. Gears:** Filia. This soul is to be restored.\n\n**J. Filia:** Of that I'm aware, old friend. Wozny of the Blood died neither Heroically or Justly.\n\n**C. Gears:** You tell me what I already know.\n\n**J. Filia:** It died like a coward on its belly, squealing like a pig, unwilling to fight in the slightest for its life--\n\n**C. Gears:** Silence.\n\n**J. Filia:** Feeling perhaps terror in its final breaths-- or do you think perhaps it cried for the mother it promised it would come home safe to? Or was this a stolen child that couldn't remember its mother, because you erased it--\n\n**C. Gears:** Cease. You know nothing!\n\n**J. Filia:** The irony being, of course, that such base cowardice is life itself, yet you have taught these lambs to the slaughter that they ought to fight to the very last for Xerophylla herself, and hoard Arcane immortality for the lucky coward few.\n\n**C. Gears:** Enough! Give me the soul.\n\n**J. Filia:** Will you teach it life?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Meeting Minutes**\n//Professor Sophia Light, Phlegm//\n//Headmaster Charles Gears, Bile//\n\n------\n\n//Professor Gears touches his hand to the earth, cleansed by Filia's passage.//\n\n**C. Gears:** Again, death.\n\n**S. Light:** Is there any truth to his delusions?\n\n**C. Gears:** You know there cannot be. I sealed  the Ogre Fernand myself; his Arcana card sits in my deck right this very moment. Even now he dances at the edge of my mind, a loyal vessel waiting to be called to war.\n\n**S. Light:** And that Woodcock knows of Fernand -- the Ogre King Ferdinand, so he says -- at all?\n\n**C. Gears:** The stories we told him took a life of their own. The spirit cried of the corruption at our foundation, and he chose to believe it was the doing of the same Ferdinand that took his father's life.\n\n**S. Light:** Did his father die for us?\n\n**C. Gears:** Of course not.\n\n**S. Light:** Your verdict?\n\n**C. Gears:** ...Their force is too strong to waste.\n\n**S. Light:** What are you proposing?\n\n**C. Gears:** We seal their minds as one with the Lament Configuration, and throw them directly into Darkest Evropa to fight until underwhelmed. The blood sacrifice of Leinnes can be redirected from their ends to our own.\n\n//Light waits in silence until it is clear Gears shall say no more.//\n\n**S. Light:** Troy never would have wanted for that ritual to be his legacy. \n\n**C. Gears:** And yet he serves even in True Death, as we all will.\n\n**S. Light:** We have none with the Arcana power to seal. None dare wield the power of MMDCCXVIII. Few are foolish enough to think they can escape its touch.\n\n**C. Gears:** Then what of XCIII?\n\n**S. Light:** I could not; I remain Unclean from my last use.\n\n**C. Gears:** Then I shall not ask it of you. The Spiral Path?\n\n**S. Light:** Mann is too //comfortable// at Yarsborough; he would demand a greater price in blood for his aid. You know this.\n\n**C. Gears:** Of course I do. But if the task falls to me, perhaps DCCCXXXV.\n\n**S. Light:** Charles, that is foul.\n\n**C. Gears:** And yet, necessary. Sanctus Santorum, as it were.\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n+ Night 3: Forever\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Annotated Combat Log**\n\n------\n\nProfessor Light walks through a corridor of the Arcana Institute. The light of the moon shines in through slit-like windows.\n\nOutside, a second set of footsteps matches hers.\n\nShe palms an Arcana Card in her hand.\n\nThe corridor opens to a courtyard. \n\nDamien Lawrence Woodcock stands to face her, beneath the light of a full moon.\n\nHe draws his blade.\n\nA dead thing appears around him, with pleated scale-like armor.\n\nShe opens her hand. Her Arcana Card erupts into light which fast shapes into a gladius.\n\nDamien Lawrence Woodcock lunges, his arm above his head, ready to fall.\n\nShe parries.\n\nThe shadow of a second blade falls upon her. The dead thing, too, swings for her neck.\n\nHer blade flares with holy light, blasting it away. She leaps backwards.\n\nThe two face each other again.\n\nShe points her sword at the corrupted knight. He raises his blade to guard his face, as if afraid she might shoot a lance of light at him.\n\nShe charges, her blade aimed at his heart.\n\nThe dead thing folds in front of him; her blade pierces it. Its texture is like mud, slowing her blade.\n\nShe feels his arms moving from beyond the deathly avatar.\n\nHer blade becomes a card again, and then a blade, just in time to stop his from piercing her skull. His arm is flung away, and he scampers back.\n\nHe raises his sword, eyeing her with newfound respect. The first true challenge, she must be. He raises his sword, as if awaiting her next move.\n\nThe clock strikes twelve.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**After-Action Report**\n//Headmaster Charles Gears, Bile//\n------\n\nThe creature was bound by its own set of rules -- that much was clear -- but I believe the true weakness was the story we had fed to its host.\n\nWe teach all the Phlegmlings some version of a rags to riches story. Something to hope for instead of a guaranteed painful death. Some form of hero's journey so that they might have hope -- the Greatest of Evils, as they say in the lands of Greaze. \n\nFor Woodcock, that ideal was the lost codes of Knightly Chivalry, abandoned ever since Night fell. The idea that a social class of authorized killers should follow some form of code in deciding when to mete out death is universal, but the constraints from the times before are so simple as to be quaint. And he thought the Arcana Institute was one of the last bastions of such ideals, the sole shining city on the hill in a world of darkness.\n\nSo he had no preparation for our subterfuge.\n\n--C. Gears\n[[/div]]\n\nThe [[[SCP-835|Sanctus Santorum]]] is come! A rigid prison of coral polyps. It has grasping tentacles and has a taste for human flesh! Beware its bilious phlegm!\n\nProfessor Light jumps out of its range.\n\nThe Sanctus Santorum engages Woodcock. It tears at him with its tentacles. He strikes at it with his sword and the dead thing, but it has endless arms and he and the ghost have only four. It bites and snaps at him.\n\nAnd then it heaves. Its slurry -- a bilious and phlegmatic substance, foul in odor and thick yet lumpy -- splatters across his visage.\n\nHis face is red and patchy and infected. Soon, he shall turn, and they shall be rid of him. He shall be made one of the Sanctus Santorum, and he shall be sealed.\n\nThe earth and air tremors.\n\n**S. Light:** Charles. Do you feel that? A mutation.\n\n**C. Gears:** How fascinating... that this bilious affair might reveal a deeper truth.\n\n**S. Light:** Are you prepared?\n\nProfessor Gears draws a quill pen and flourishes it through the air.\n\n**C. Gears:** Always.\n\nA magic circle erupts, a smaller circle within an outer triangle, with Damien Lawrence Woodcock and the Sanctus Santorum at the center. \n\nThree spears strike at them. The first of flowing quicksilver that melts about him and encases him in sleek metal. The second of white salt that locks the shifting metal in place and purifies the essence of the Sanctus Santorum. The final of burning sulfur that wreathes the man and ghost within with divine fire.\n\n\n**C. Gears:** You are a dead thing without form save in living hands, and you are a boy with dreams of knighthood without title nor armor. You are a parasite of warped and twisted flesh.\n\n**S. Light:** You are abomination to the Burning Gods, in their Hollow halls. Apostate, Traitor, Childslayer. But we give you purpose.\n\n**C. Gears:** We give you form and function, and draw from the relics of the Last Universe the Number that defines you.\n\nThe red welts on DLW's face burst into tentacles. They coil around his body like kudzu vines before hardening into bulbous plates of enamel. They wrap around the Hinimotan sword and encase it in bone. The dead spirit howls, drawn into the coils of bone, becoming imprisoned by the infection of the Sanctus Santorum. The only hint of it that remains, that of a face, twisted and enraged upon the belly and breast of the armor in sharp bas relief.\n\nThe circle closes. The light shrinks inward, inward, inward, circles becoming concentric. The three arrows flash again and again, their echoes formed through magic and time. \n\nA card appears in Professor Gears's hand. On it, the figure before them.\n\nA knight encased in bone, driven by a noble mind and a restless spirit. Stoic and still.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7375 is a statue of bone and phlegmatic enamel, sealed within the Sepulchrum Santorum of the Arcana Institute of Xerophylla. It wields a blade of bone and steel. It cannot move on its own, but can be commanded to do so by one with the sufficient Arcana.\n\nIts temperament is bilious and phlegmatic. \n\nFrom time to time, screams of disgusted agony can be heard from its core.
