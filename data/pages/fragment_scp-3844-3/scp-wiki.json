Please note that information presented herein may be misleading or incorrect. \n\n//Changes from the previous iteration are highlighted in ##blue|blue##//\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3844\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** --While proper facilities are under construction-- SCP-3844 is to be contained at its dwelling within the Dolomite Mountains. A 100m x 100m perimeter is to be regularly patrolled by Foundation personnel to ensure no civilians come into contact with SCP-3844. \n\nAnti-aircraft artillery is to be positioned around SCP-3844's dwelling. --Artillery is to fire at any airborne entities over the containment perimeter. Any evidence of the existence of SCP-3844 is to be attributed to bombing runs.-- ##blue|Artillery is only to be used in the event of a full scale containment breach.## \n\nOnce a week, one --D-Class-- ##blue|member of the SCP-3844 project## is to be sent to interact with SCP-3844, ##blue|and take temperature and radiation measurements. A team of researchers are to take size measurements, perform IQ tests, and determine the maximum temperature of fire SCP-3844 can expel once per month.## Personnel caught stealing items from SCP-3844 are to be disciplined accordingly.\n\n##blue|SCP-3844 is to be provided with the following reading material as part of its monthly measurements:##\n* ##blue|Time Magazine##\n* ##blue|Science Magazine##\n* ##blue|Nature Magazine##\n* ##blue|Communications of the ACM##\n\n**Description:** SCP-3844 is a winged reptile, measuring --73.76m-- ##blue|50.22m## from tail to head, and with a wing span of --67.42m-- ##blue|42.78m##[[footnote]] According to most recent measurements.[[/footnote]]. It is estimated to mass --27,000kg-- ##blue|18,000kg##. SCP-3844's scales are of a --purple-- ##blue|blue## hue, except around the stomach where they are much lighter. SCP-3844 is capable of --expelling fire at 3400°C from its mouth through an unknown method-- ##blue| forcefully expelling a methane vapor from its mouth (achieving temperatures as high as 1950°C), and igniting it through unknown means.##\n\nSCP-3844 is capable of speech in --at least 14-- ##blue|7## languages, and has --an extensive--  ##blue|moderate## knowledge of world events. During direct interactions with personnel, SCP-3844 takes the form of an adult male, however SCP-3844 ##blue|claims it## can mimic the appearance of any human. \n\nSCP-3844 inhabits an immense cavern that contains --a currently unquantified amount of valuable metals-- ##blue| 2.69x10^^6^^kg of valuable metals (approximately 2.6 billion US dollars)##. SCP-3844 often burrows underneath these materials, where it presumably sleeps. \n\n##blue|In conversation, SCP-3844 has confirmed that it is the inspiration behind a number of european myths involving dragons. It also claims to be the model for the Welsh flag[[footnote]] \"I used to be red you know. A vibrant red to match the fire I'd breathe. Those were indeed good days.\"[[/footnote]].## \n\n**Addendum:** The following is a transcript of an interview between --Dr. Lester Fegmont-- ##blue|O5-2## and SCP-3844.\n\n> ##blue|<**Begin Log**>##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I see you've finally returned. A few years late, but I guess that's only to be expected.##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** Yes, I guess I am a little late. Sorry about that.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Don't worry about it. You're obviously busy, and in the meantime, I've had all manner of new reading material. How long had you known about the nature of light?##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** //[smiles]// Decades at least.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** And the inner workings of our smallest building block?##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** We cracked open the atom during the war.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Before long you might have an explanation for my kind!##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** Well, you'd be surprised how far science can get you. My division has discovered that some things aren't even anomalous in the first place.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** So, has science finally found a way to let me stretch my wings?##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** Unfortunately, due to certain advances in radar, we can't risk you leaving the cavern. However, I've asked others to devise a way to possibly... expand your home.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** Oh have you? I'm looking forward to this now.##\n> \n> ##blue|**O5-2:** I do have to be on my way. Hopefully I will see you again.##\n> \n> ##blue|**SCP-3844:** I hope so as well.##\n> \n> ##blue|<**End Log**>##\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:left; width: 45%\"]]\n\n{{Page revision 3/4 from 03/22/1984}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/SCP-3844/offset/3 Next iteration from 11/04/2007]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
