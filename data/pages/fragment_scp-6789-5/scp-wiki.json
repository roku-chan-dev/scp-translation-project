I'll just let you draw the conclusions yourself.\"}}\n\n{{> O5-1 HAS SENT YOU A FILE TO REVIEW. ACCESS FILES?}}\n\n{{yes}}\n\n{{> ACCESSING FILE: DRAFT FOR SCP-6789.}}\n-----\n\n**Item #:** SCP-6789\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The room hosting SCP-6789 and its adjacent chambers are to be cut off from employees of Rollander Steel and the public at large. The sub-basement level of the factory is to be sealed and expunged from the building's blueprints. Access to SCP-6789 is to be placed under constant surveillance and armed guard. Due to scientific knowledge that could be gleaned from SCP-6789 a permanent research team is to be stationed and supplied on-site. Notable research developments are to be forwarded to Site-120 administrative personnel.\n \n**Description:** SCP-6789 is a roughly 20m x 20m area of space located within the sub-basement boiler room of the Rollander General Steel factory in CzÄ™stochowa, Poland, within which the growth speed of organic material is greatly increased.\n\nDespite being shielded from sunlight and isolated to sufficient sources of water, SCP-6789 is capable of hosting a microcosm of floral and faunal life. Organisms present within the anomaly have been observed to be sustained indefinitely through unknown means, barring interference from outside phenomena. Prior to the manifestation of the anomaly, the room hosting SCP-6789 was the main power source for the Rollander General Steel factory. This room has since been rendered nonfunctional due to plant growth.\n\nSeveral eyewitnesses claim to have felt a rhythmic pulsing originating from within SCP-6789 while in its vicinity; these claims are unverified and are being investigated. Further research is pending.",
