The weather is perfect for relaxing outside; at 35°C (or 95°F), there is no reason not to get some fresh air. The wind is, at worst, incredibly light. Seagulls are out on the sand, and the ocean is still. We see our main star, RESEARCHER TALLORAN, lying in a soft chair underneath a parasol. Meanwhile, DOCTOR HIKARI YAMADA has opted directly for sunbathing. Despite the weather, both are in their professional work clothes. If one didn't know better, they'd think that it was colder than it actually is.

The area is unfamiliar; when was the last time TALLORAN ever been to anything like a hotel, let alone a beach? To the right is someone real familiar; DOCTOR HIKARI YAMADA. It doesn't take YAMADA long to notice TALLORAN, now shuffling around the balcony in a nervous sweat.

That's not something the calm and steadfast side of you would be dealing with.[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]TALLORAN[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]I remember the first session for sure. It was about the uh... the roughness I've had dealing with anomalies. No one tells you this when you first join, but you're just so likely to end up traumatized and messed up. I thought I got through my first couple years fine before they found me having a meltdown by some humanoid's cell.[[/span]]\n------\n[[>]]\n[[size 75%]]\nII-1-11\n[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]GLASS[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]Do you remember the anomaly?[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]TALLORAN[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]Would that even matter, really?[[/span]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]GLASS[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courier\"]]No wonder I couldn't figure out which one that was just now.

I had a real rough time surviving before I got picked up by the Foundation. It's tough. But it's hard to remember that many details about it.
