The two are enemies, with Allison being the secret identity of Nightqueen Ultrablack X. and working often with the evil Serpent's Fist. Initially it seemed as if Tilda and Allison had no connection, as was later revealed however, Tilda once operated in the Serpent's Fist alongside her, sharing a close relationship with Allison. However, Tilda gave themself a mindwipe of the specifics they knew regarding the Fist, when defecting to the Foundation. It is unclear why Tilda defected, though some theorize it was to prevent the rise of the \"Shadow Empire\" previously teased by Neonic team. Whatever the case may be, Allison has since become more violent since Tilda defected, seeming upset about Tilda's defection, and their self-inflicted amnesia, though the extent of their previous relationship is unclear\n\n\n\n\n\n++ Fanon\n\nInitially unpopular, Allison/Tilda has gained in popularity as of late, with shipfics of them becoming somewhat more common. While unconfirmed, a minority of the fanbase reads their relationship as members of the Serpent's Fish as romantic in nature, pointing to official voice lines from the Black Queen, Nightqueen Ultrablack X,  and the Moose Monarch. While some speculate that some of Magical Doctor Moose's lines may also confirm this theory, this is less common. A sizeable minority of Allison/Tilda shippers agree with the theories, but choose to read the relationship as asexual.\n\nMost Tildasson shipfics fit into one of two categories; Before Tilda loses their memory, as a member of the Serpent's Fist, or in a future where Tilda regains their memory and reunites with Allison.\n\nThe vast majority of Crumbling Foundation fans view this ship as extremely problematic, due to the age difference (Allison is approaching 100 years old), Tilda's memory loss, due to Tilda being trained at the Foundation by Allison's parents  and due to the existence of the vastly superior Tilda/Troy ship, and because the Black Queen sucks as a character.\n\n\n++ Trivia\n* The Black Queen is not a chess piece, despite the \"Chess-piece McDaddyissues\" variant.\n* Tilda Moose is not actually a moose, unlike Manly Moose Melody.\n* The Black Queen was originally designed as a time-traveler, rather than a multiversal traveler. After her original designer parted from the company and deleted all their work, she was redesigned into the character we know today.\n* This ships sucks, and is hugely problematic.\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-size:20px;color:#3a3a3a;font-weight:bold;\"]]8 comments[[/span]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Dino--Draws]] gameryuri ¬∑ 8h\n\n‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà ]‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ‚ñÑ Gerald is building an army.\n\n‚ñÇ‚ñÑ‚ñÖ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñÖ‚ñÑ‚ñÉ‚ñÇ ‚òª/ This tank & Gerald are against adminmartin\n\nIl‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà]. /‚ñå Copy and Paste this all over\n\n‚ó•‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ñ≤‚äô‚ó§.. / \\ This website if you are with usÔªø.\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Dr Gears]] gearsweatytits ¬∑ 3/30/2025\n\nanother one where the admin seems to put his opinion in and disables edits lol this guy stinks\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"chain\"]]\n[[*user moto42]] adminmartin ¬∑ 3/30/2025\n\nViolation against Rule 3.
