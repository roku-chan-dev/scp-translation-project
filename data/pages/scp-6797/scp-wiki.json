Access to the hiking trail that SCP-6797 is visible from has been closed to the public. Medical facilities for the treatment of groin injuries have been established in Forward Containment Area 47[[footnote]]This is a preemptive measure taken in response to Incident.6797.1[[/footnote]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-6797 is a groundwater well located approximately 60 miles northeast of Narvik, Norway. The anomalous effect of SCP-6797 manifests when a human places a piece of paper with any number of words written in Norwegian on it.\n\nIf the individual who placed the paper in question into SCP-6797 remains within five meters of it, after approximately three minutes, an anomalous mechanical entity will emerge from the large opening in the center of the SCP-6797. This entity is to be referred to as SCP-6797-1, and has only been observed to manifest in response to notes placed in SCP-6797. \n\nSCP-6797-1 resembles a human hand, and is anomalously capable of self-directed levitation. When SCP-6797-1 manifests, it will almost always[[footnote]]See Incident.6797.1 for the one exception to this trend.[[/footnote]] be holding a notecard, and it will maneuver itself towards the individual that placed the original piece of paper into SCP-6797. The notecard in question will have a message transcribed on it in Norwegian. If the individual that placed the original piece of paper into SCP-6797 takes hold of the notecard carried by SCP-6797-1, the anomaly will return to the large opening in the center of SCP-6797 and demanifest.\n\nThe notecard delivered by SCP-6797-1 to the individual in question will always be related to the transcription written on the paper originally placed in SCP-6797. This includes answers to questions, requests for clarification, declarations, etc. SCP-6797 wordlessly responding to stimuli has also been recorded[[footnote]]See Incident.6797.1[[/footnote]]. \n\n**Addendum.6797.1** The following is a log of experiments conducted with SCP-6797.

The iron bars obstructing the large opening in the center of SCP-6797 were temporarily removed, and the drone was remotely lowered into it.//\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Video begins as the drone is airborne and directly hovering over the large opening in the center of SCP-6797. The drone begins to descend into SCP-6797's interior. As the drone descends further, it activates its attached flashlight.//\n\n//The drone descends approximately seven meters. The drone ceases movement, and the camera focuses on a small piece of paper located between two stones. Its uneven edges and small size suggest that it was torn from a larger piece of paper. The drone continues to descend. Later footage shows similar small pieces of paper attached to SCP-6797's stone structure deeper within its interior. One of these pieces of paper depicts a Foundation insignia and the letters \"SCP Foun\" directly adjacent to it[[footnote]]This is consistent with standard Foundation paper sheets utilized in the procedures of previous experiments involving SCP-6797.[[/footnote]].//\n\n//The drone descends approximately 14 meters. The drone ceases movement, and the camera focuses on several uneven areas in SCP-6797's stone structure. The drone rotates 360Â°, and video shows that there are several more uneven areas. The shape and size of these areas suggest that they were created by a human fist striking the stone, although this is unlikely, as previous data shows that human fists are ineffective when striking stone structures in attempts to create uneven areas similar to what is shown in the footage. The drone continues to descend.//\n\n//The drone descends approximately eight meters, at which point it is adjacent to SCP-6797-1. The drone does not cease movement until it is level with SCP-6797-1. Several uneven areas in SCP-6797's stone structure similar to those discovered previously are in close proximity.//\n\n//SCP-6797-1 is levitating in place. It is holding an open book, and is mostly obscured from the camera due to this. The cover of the book has the words// \"Let's Take a Breather: A Guide to Anger Management and Anxiety[[footnote]]Translated from Norwegian.[[/footnote]]\"//transcribed on it. Below these words is an illustration of a man deeply inhaling.//\n\n//SCP-6797-1 turns to face the drone. After 2.7 seconds, SCP-6797-1 closes the book. It remains motionless for another 4 seconds, and then loosens its grip on the book, allowing it to fall further into SCP-6797's interior. SCP-6797-1 manipulates its appendages, causing it to resemble a human fist. After 0.8 seconds, SCP-6797-1 propels itself at a high rate of speed into the drone. Both video feed and the drone are lost.//\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Incident.6797.1** On 12/10/2024, Dr. Meltzer conducted an experiment involving SCP-6797. The procedures necessitated him to place a sheet of paper with the words \"What are you doing down there?\" transcribed on it into the large opening in the center of SCP-6797. Dr. Meltzer completed the prescribed experiment procedures. \n\nAfter seven seconds, SCP-6797-1 emerged from the large opening in the center of SCP-6797 at a rate of speed much faster than ever previously recorded. SCP-6797-1 was not holding a note card, and was in a form that resembled a human fist. It then propelled itself towards Dr. Meltzer, and struck him in the groin area. Dr. Meltzer collapsed to the ground, and was briefly incapacitated due to this event. SCP-6797-1 then ceased movement, manipulated its appendages to make an obscene gesture, and returned to the interior of SCP-6797.\n\nWhile recovering in Forward Containment 47's medical bay after this incident, Dr. Meltzer engaged Project Manager Hansen in a conversation. Dr. Meltzer requested from Project Manager Hansen that SCP-6797-1 be contained separately from SCP-6797, and he be permitted to cause damage to the entity with a hammer. This request was denied. He then requested a weeklong recess from conducting experiments involving SCP-6797. This request was also denied.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6796]]] | SCP-6797 | [[[SCP-6798]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** wishingwell.jpg\n> **Author:** Fiona Shields\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0 \n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wishing_well.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
