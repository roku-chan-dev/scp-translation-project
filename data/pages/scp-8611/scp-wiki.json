Destruction by incineration of any contaminated non-desirable matter is to be affected as a first priority. If contaminated material endures this measure then its removal to a non-essential β-class dimension is authorised.\n\nSCP-8611 is highly transmissible through molecular contact. For this reason any experimentation is to avoid the use of complex polymeric materials or free-deforming fluids with potentially harmful isomers. \n\nThe spread of SCP-8611 has been determined to be slower through chemically non-reactive substances. Storage may therefore be effected in laboratories saturated by a medium of inert gas such as helium or neon to abate its transmission; with all unwanted testing matter disposed of as previously outlined.\n-----\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-8611 is a reality-altering phenomenon which affects compounds on the chemical level. If exposed, a compound of significant complexity - with the potential to form divergent structural or stereo-isomers - will have its atomic arrangement and bonding transmuted into one of these other forms. This results in the gradual substitution of compounds and chemical structures into functionally different versions of themselves, often heavily impacting the reactions which they are able to undergo and the interactions between other parts of the same material. Each individual transmutation is random, meaning that many varying isomers of the same compound may be produced as a result of SCP-8611 exposure. \n\nSo far this effect has proved irreversible through non-anomalous means, with the chemistry of exposed substances being altered from the point of contact at a variable rate depending on their size and composition (see testing record). SCP-8611 appears to work fastest on biological material, subject size notwithstanding, and the profusion of metabolic reactions in living organisms which rely on specific isomers make SCP-8611 \"infection\" invariably fatal if anomalous countermeasures are not undertaken close to the time of exposure.\n\nThe only known instances of extant SCP-8611 affected material are three samples, formerly of haemoglobin protein, suspended at high pressure within a matrix of solid-frozen helium in the Reactive Matter Isolation (RMI) wing of Site 12.\n-----\n**TESTING HISTORY:** On acquisition, experimentation to establish SCP-8611's nature began immediately. Once its destructive effect on biological matter was understood, research into applications in organic threat-nullification was conducted. \n\n [[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"Access Testing Record\" hide=\"- Close Testing Record\"]]\n\n||||||~ [[size 120%]]Test 8611-1[[/size]] ||  \n||||||< **Test Subject:** 25 cm^^-3^^ of laboratory propan-1-ol.||\n||||< **Timeline of Observable Results:** ||< **//Notes://** ||\n||< 48 seconds PE (Post-Exposure): ||< No visual changes observed, but a significantly more pungent alcohol smell had pervaded test chamber.|| //Confirmed as the point at which all propan-1-ol had been transmuted into propan-2-ol.// ||\n||< **1 minute PE:** ||= **Test Concluded** ||< **SCP-8611 effect established after spectral analysis of product.** ||\n _\n\n||||||~ [[size 120%]]Test 8611-2[[/size]] ||  \n||||||< **Test Subject:** 25 cm^^-3^^ of propan-2-ol from test 8611-1.||\n||||< **Timeline of Observable Results:** ||< **//Notes://** ||\n||< 42 seconds PE: ||< Similarly, nothing was observed visually.

Saira Fadhwari-Richwell. But why am I here?\n\n**Matlock:** Well Saira, that was something I had hoped you could help me with. \n\n**8611-Alpha:** What do you mean? I haven't done anything wrong. I haven't done anything. \n\n**Matlock:** Of course not Saira. I'd just like to know what you were working on in the lab?

Um, Mum has her self-help books. They're all about improving your life through dieting and affirmations and stuff. Dad does-- I mean he owns the company. They do all sorts of stuff in their labs.

This was new. I just wanted them to know I liked it, and that I was good at it. So I asked them to let me test it all, only to mess about with. And ... some of it didn't //behave// right.\" \n\n**Matlock:** How so?\n\n**8611-Alpha:** Not like I was taught. There were diseases that spread so quickly, killing their hosts in seconds. There was a lab rat that was covered in tumours. So many tumours I was really surprised it was still alive. But it was. I think I named it Bumby and kept it for weeks. I'm sorry you didn't need to know that, sorry. Erm, I remember aunty Shannon left a sample here once. It looked like wine but it would turn anything that drank it sort of ... inside out. They were all that kind of weird. But nothing actually dangerous if you left it alone.\n\n**Matlock:** I understand Saira. What can you tell me about the one you had before you came here? Did your parents say where it came from, if they had more like it?\n\n**8611-Alpha:** I can't. I ... can't. I don't remember the last few hours. Did you ... drug me? \n\n**Matlock:** Focus Saira. Did your parents say anything about the biological material in the lab?\n\n**8611-Alpha:** They said something, something about getting this one done quick. Before I left to go back to Uni. They sounded more urgent than usual. It was a sheep when I started, a cute little lamb. But it started to //unravel// as I watched. Oh. I do remember. The way everything flipped the wrong way 'round. All the proteins, her eyes and ears and fur, her DNA even-- oh god the way the muscle slowly slipped off of ... of off ...\n\n//Subject gasps and then only breathes for several seconds.//\n\n**8611-Alpha:** She screamed and kicked the whole time. \n\n//Subject begins to cry.//\n\n**8611-Alpha:** They said they needed her in ... in bottles once it'd finished. That was strange. In thick glass ones, like they use for strong acids. Why? Why did they want that?\n\n//She looks fearfully at Matlock.//\n\n**Matlock:** I'm not sure, but thank you for all your help Saira. You've done us a great service. The agents here will make sure you are returned home safely.\n\n//Matlock leaves the table, pressing the small amnestic gas release controller in his hand as he exits the interrogation room.//\n\n**Matlock:** And good luck with your studies.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n-----\n**UPDATE 02/03/2026:** Investigation into the corporation's assets within and without the United Kingdom is ongoing.
