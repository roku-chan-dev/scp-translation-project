When an individual manually handles an instance of SCP-8140 for the first time, they experience a lifelike hallucination consisting of the experiences of the artifact’s original owner.  The period of time these experiences cover varies wildly; some have memories from a few moments and others contain years of information.  Throughout the duration of the hallucination, the individual handling an instance of SCP-8140 experiences the memories as if they are the originating entity.  This includes experiencing the events of a memory through the eyes of a perspective subject, but without complete disassociation as the observing individual is always aware of their own identity.\n\nThe ontological effect consists of an atemporal transfer of information/experiences.  Subjectively, the individual handling the instance of SCP-8140 experiences each set of memories as they occurred.  Objectively, the amount of time during which the transfer of experience takes place is negligible, with a duration of usually less than a minute.  The transition from subjective experience to baseline reality leads to some, if not all, of the following side effects:\n* delirium;\n* fatigue;\n* agitation;\n* slowed cognition;\n* limited aphasia;\n* prosopagnosia;\n* derealization.\n\nThese side effects last several minutes. The anomalous transmission of experiences from the artifact to holder exhibits significant mnestic properties – amnestic treatments have been entirely unsuccessful at erasing the memories transmitted.  Each artifact found emits low levels of Akiva radiation, thus creating a baseline for identification.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-i/SCP-8000%20Ruins|\n    \ncaption=Previously excavated area at Göbekli Tepe.\n]]\n\nThe artifacts exhibit cultural identifiers of the **[[[daevite-hub | early Daevite civilization]]]** and **[[[scp-1000 | another unknown culture]]]**, date to circa 9000 BCE +/- 100 years, and originate in a layer previously undiscovered in a nearby field outside Göbekli Tepe.

Foundation forces locked down the site under a cover story of methane deposits.  The graduate student was subsequently interviewed while in hospital in Istanbul.

I’ve reviewed the test logs you’ve recorded in the last week and I’ve seen several things that made this meeting imperative.  Are you familiar with SCP-1000?\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: No, I am not.\n\n**Director Varga**: I’m upping your clearance level for this project, Doctor.  The reason I’m telling you this is that nothing about this file can be revealed to staff not cleared to know the information.\n\n//[Varga passes a thick manila envelope across the desk towards Lindqvist, who begins to leaf through.]//\n\n[[=]]\n**//Ten minutes omitted for brevity.//**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: Why was I not informed of this from the beginning?\n\n**Director Varga**: It wasn’t relevant to the anomaly until I reviewed the test results.  Now it is.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: I’m at a loss for words.  An entire civilization of another species that pre-dates recorded history, that somehow we’ve all forgotten?\n\n**Director Varga**: Yes, I know it’s a lot to take in.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: I’ll want to review any and all archaeological records we have from SCP-1000.\n\n**Director Varga**: That’s the thing, Nils.  There aren’t any.  We’ve never identified an archaeological site confirmed to be from the Children of the Night.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: None?\n\n**Director Varga**: //[Shaking her head.]// Ancient humanity did the job too thoroughly, some sort of ontokinetic wipe on a universal level.  We know they existed, we know the civilization spread all over the world, but they vanished without a trace into obscurity.  Which is why you can appreciate how important this site is, I hope?  They’ve lived on the margins of humanity for centuries now, and this is the first real insight into their actions from antiquity.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: But according to the file, that happened in the stone age.\n\n**Director Varga**: Which begs the question how this active force took military action against the early Daevites?  I don’t know what to make of that.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: I do.\n\n**Director Varga**: What?\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: SCP-140.  It changes reality retrocausally. Apparently, not solely for the Daeva.\n\n**Director Varga**: So, someone expanded SCP-140 extending the influence of the Children of the Night further into the future?  Why?\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: We don’t know how SCP-140 works.  We don’t know if some anomalous effect within the book seeks its own purposes or the person expanding the history follows their own mandate.  All we know is the effect such expansions have.  I wouldn’t be surprised if we find more archaeological data pertaining to SCP-1000 after this.  \n\n**Director Varga**: Which makes it even more imperative to find out what you can about them through SCP-8140.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: Yes, of course.  But it’s even more interesting to understand how SCP-140 and Daevite thaumaturgy can affect causality in general.  Think of the possibilities?\n\n**Director Varga**: Nils, no.  We can’t go messing with the timeline.  Experimentation with SCP-140 is strictly forbidden all the way up to the O5s themselves.\n\n**Dr. Lindqvist**: Right, of course.

SCP-8140-A contains several Daevite thaumaturgical sigils across its walls, all but one of which are imperceptible, even under the influence of mnestics.

A bed of leaves is just beyond the breastplate, next to a chair seemingly grown directly out of the tree’s inner surface.  The subject picks up SCP-8140-11 and begins fastening it to its chest.  The subject is an instance of SCP-1000.]//\n\n//[Subject moves out of the dwelling, pushing aside a woven grass curtain acting as a door.  Thousands of trees surround the subject, many of them as large as a house.  From each, one or two instances of SCP-1000 emerge.  As one the thousands of primates move in a single direction.  The subject, along with its fellow instances, marches through the forest for several minutes until a large circular clearing is reached.  The clearing is made up of a depression in the earth nearly one hundred meters wide, and several descending layers of rock outcroppings resembling an arena.  At the center of the depression, a single SCP-1000 instance is standing on a dais of raised earth.  The subject finds a seat on the stones and is slowly surrounded by thousands of other instances.  When the circular clearing is filled with seated primates, the instance on the dais begins to speak in a booming voice.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: Children of the Night, I welcome you.  We have not met in such numbers for many long years.  Our numbers have dwindled for centuries since the Night of the Flowers, and this is one of the few remaining outposts of our once great civilization.\n\n[[=]]\n**//What the?  I can understand them now?//**[[footnote]]It has been theorized that Dr. Lindqvist’s debriefing concerning the existence of SCP-1000 unlocked a memetic block that had previously caused their speech to be unintelligible.  Given the nature of SCP-1000’s history and the ontokinetic nature of their defeat, it is possible that without direct knowledge of their existence even the anomalous nature of SCP-8140 could not overcome the centuries of memetic encoding that have erased SCP-1000 from humanity’s collective memory.[[/footnote]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: So, I thank you for coming.  I know our time is past, and we have been forced into the margins of existence on a planet we nurtured while the humans spread like wildfire, but this meeting is not to discuss what we have lost.  We have gathered today to discuss war.  \n\n//[Many SCP-1000 instances gasp or begin talking amongst themselves.  The perspective subject does not say anything or look around it, instead focusing keenly on the leader on the dais.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: Please!  I know we have all suffered because of the War against humanity.  I too suffered.  But hear me out.\n\n//[The amphitheater grows quiet again.  The perspective subject grips its hands on the edge of its breast plate, tensing against the petrified wood.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: Not far from here, to the east and the north, a series of human city states are joining together into an empire.  They are not like other humans, their technology and ritual might are impressive.  Many of you are aware of the danger these humans present.  But for those that do not, they call themselves the Daeva.  They are worshippers of blood while calling themselves guardians of life.  They enslave all cultures they encounter as their influence grows.  And they sacrifice their children to gods we cannot even imagine.  \n\n//[Murmuring can be heard all around the subject.  It turns to a small group of SCP-1000 instances whispering to each other in an animated way.  It shushes them with barely restrained rage.  The subject returns its attention to the dais.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**:  We are the guardians of life on this planet, we always have been.  The humans despoil all land they touch.  But these humans are worse than the small villages we’ve seen in other parts of the world.  These are an empire, devoted to death while claiming a mantle that we were cheated of.  Soon, this empire will be pushing into our territory.  Even now they are founding a colony centered around a temple, just a few days' march from this very spot.\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: If they weren’t threatening this last stronghold of our people, I would not make such a plea to the Assembly.  But as it stands this empire will be within our forest in a few years, raping it and killing our children for their disgusting rituals.  I know we have suffered.  I know there are but a few thousand of us left here.  But I ask you, will you stand by and wait for this empire to claim our birthright? Will you cower when the enemy is on our very thresholds?\n\n//[The amphitheater is quiet for a few moments.  Then the perspective subject stands and calls out, its voice booming across the amphitheater.]//\n\n**Subject**: NO!\n\n//[Many more SCP-1000 instances stand and echo the call.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: Will you beg these human women, dressed in blood and gold, when they take their stone knives to your neighbors?\n\n**Many voices**: NO!\n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: Then I beg you, return to your homes, wake up the tree guardians, take up your weapons and meet me at the northern edge of the forest tomorrow at dusk, and we shall march on their hive like a //landslide//.  \n\n//[The SCP-1000 leader on the dais raises its own sword.]// \n\n**SCP-1000 Leader**: March with me until every last one of the Daeva threatening our forest is **a stain** on their rock walls.

The subject inserts her knife into the back of his skull with a quick, sure strike, destroying the brainstem.  The thrashing ceases.  The channel has filled with blood and is moving circularly in a pulsating manner through the channel.

A few moments later, limping, the SCP-1000 instance wearing SCP-8140-11 appears at the entrance to the chamber.  It is significantly wounded, bleeding not just from the wound in the thigh received earlier in the battle but also exhibiting a deep gash in the left forearm and another across its eyes and trailing back along the crown of its skull.  The large primate shuffles forward.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 instance**: You are done.  Your people and slaves are routed.  I doubt any of your sisters live.

She slashes again before the primate can complete the swing of its sword, cutting through inner elbow.  The sword travels through the air despite the damage caused, striking the subject in the left side of her torso above the waist and cutting through into her sternum.  She gasps and chokes out a spurt of blood.]//\n\n**SCP-1000 instance**: Now die.\n\n//[The primate reaches for her with its good arm, having dropped the sword.

The SCP-1000 instance falls directly onto the open channel filled with the slave’s blood.  The subject collapses as well and lays across the body of the primate.  Their blood mingles into the channel.  As the subject’s eyes fight to stay open, the blade of the obsidian athame deteriorates and crumbles to dust.

Consulting with Site-91 thaumatologists and historians, Director Varga has come to a different conclusion – the Daevite priestess intended to preserve their struggle for those of her culture to find afterwards.  There was no retrocausal aspect to this anomaly, merely an attempt to preserve a record of the conflict.  \n * The final moments of the last log reveal the mixing of SCP-1000 blood with the ritual workings in SCP-8140-A.
