The latter's vital signs are to be monitored, with site leadership made aware of any change in condition. Excursion into the former is forbidden.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6668-1 is a sinkhole in the cafeteria's floor of Site-███. SCP-6668-2 is an adult human, formerly D-1812019, located adjacent to SCP-6668-1. D-1812019 began to display anomalous properties upon returning from an exploration of SCP-6668-1. A log of this exploration is below:\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n**Foreword:** Despite best efforts, it was not possible to discern the depth of SCP-6668 from above. Any light shone into the anomaly experienced a drastic decrease in lumens. A crane was set-up over SCP-6668 to allow for exploration. D-1812019 was recruited to explore the anomaly, and attempt to locate Junior Researcher Morel.  Exploration was overseen by Site Director Hughes.\n\n//[D-1812019 is strapped into a harness, connected to the crane. He is equipped with a standard issue video recording device and radio communications. He begins to descend into SCP-6668.]//\n\n**Hughes:** D-class, what can you see? \n\n**D-1812019:** Well... nothing yet. It's dark in here. Real dark. Seems big too, as soon as I was below the initial opening I couldn't see the sides no more. It's just...black in every direction.\n\n//[D-1812019 continues to descend for two minutes.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** Ugh, Christ. I'm getting something, a whole fucking something. It reeks down here. It smells worse than the mouldy crap up where you are. \n\n**Hughes:** Are there any discernible features yet?\n \n**D-1812019:** Come again?\n\n**Hughes:** Can you see anything?\n \n**D-1812019:** Not at all. It's just dark. All dark.\n\n//[D-1812019 continues to descend for another 3 minutes. By this point, he has descended a distance of 37m. This should place him 8 storeys below, on level B5.]// \n \n**D-1812019:** Hey, what happens if there's like, no bottom? If I can't find your guy, you'll still pull-\n\n//[D-1812019 is interrupted by a wet, squelching sound.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** Stop the crane, stop the crane! \n\n//[D-1812019's camera captures him being plunged, up to their waist, into a black, viscous liquid at the bottom of SCP-6668. The liquid has only become visible due to the disruption caused by D-1812019's partial submersion.]//\n\n**Hughes:** Are you at the bottom?\n\n**D-1812019:** Yeah, I've reached it. Area's flooded in some type of black tar. //[He coughs.]// It's where that rancid smell's coming from.\n\n**Hughes:** What does the floor feel like?\n\n**D-1812019:** Uh, I dunno, a floor? It's... //[He stomps his feet]// soft? It gives way a bit when I press down.\n\n**Hughes:** Can you see anything?\n\n//[D-1812019 turns around. The light equipped to their helmet illuminates significantly less of himself, and of the surrounding area, than it should.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** There's a shape - it looks human. \n\n//[Several meters away from D-1812019, a shape floats in the liquid, wrapped in a Foundation lab coat.]//\n\n**Hughes:** Is it Morel?\n\n**D-1812019:** I can't see. It's so bloody dark in here. The body is, it's face down, floating in this //[He  retches]// tar. I think it's Morel? I can make out a lab coat.\n\n**Hughes:** Alright; grab the body, and we'll pull you both out.\n\n//[D-1812019 is silent, and does not move.]//\n\n**Hughes:** That's an order, get the body and we'll get you out.\n\n//[D-1812019 begins to breath heavily as he moves toward the body.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** I'm about to grab them, get ready to-\n\n//[D-1812019 reaches out and pulls the back of the lab coat towards him. The mass contained within the lab coat splinters into smaller parts, which begin to move rapidly. A splashing sound becomes audible as the smaller masses move into the liquid.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** It's not Morel! IT'S NOT MOREL! Get me out of here! Get me the fuck out of here!\n\n//[D-1812019 is left holding a lab coat - there is no sign of its former occupant.]//\n\n**Hughes:** Let's pull him up!\n\n//[D-1812019's camera jerks wildly. The splashing sound is still audible.]//\n\n**D-1812019:** Something's in my suit! \n\n//[D-1812019 plunges his hands into the liquid, and begins hitting at his legs. At the same time, the crane retracts him, distorting his balance, sending D-1812019 falling into the liquid at the bottom of SCP-6668. He screams, until his face is submerged too.]//\n\n//[The crane pulls D-1812019 out of the liquid, and he begins to ascend from SCP-6668. He is silent. Their camera is obfuscated by the thick, black liquid.]//\n\n------\n\nUpon recovery from SCP-6668-1, D-1812019 was unconscious. They were removed from their harness, and medical staff were called for. Before they could arrive, D-1812019 began to levitate.  \n\nNow designated SCP-6668-2, D-1812019 is currently suspended in the air, in a non-responsive state, 1m above the floor of Site ███'s cafeteria.\n\nSounds of movement are audible from within SCP-6668-1.\n[[/div]]\n\n> = [[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-6668/offset/2| A new version of this page is available.
