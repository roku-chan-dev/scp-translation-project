Please leave some criticism.\n\nI didn't get much critique before posting this. Please, please, please, tell me what you guys think.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:info:end]]\n\n+ What are Advanced Inoculation Methods?\nFor the purposes of this introduction, \"advanced\" methods of inoculation are typically intensive, all-encompassing, and often reserved for high-ranking or memetic-handling personnel. For instance, Mobile Task Force Eta-10, \"See No Evil,\" members are offered—or even required to have—these methods implemented. Additionally, their often high compensation enables them to afford additional optional memetic defenses. \n\n+ Advanced Inoculation Methods\nEach method is unique, so there isn't a general explanation for how they all function. Instead, we will examine them individually, beginning with the most common.\n\n* Cognitive Resistance\n* Surgical Augmentation\n * Electronic\n * Subtractive/Additive\n * Neurological Restructuring\n* A Brief Overview of Post-Exposure Treatment\n* A Brief Overview of External Devices\n\n++ Cognitive Resistance\nCognitive resistance training is one of the most widely used and commonly available long-term methods for protecting against cognitive hazards. 78% of all Foundation field agents have undergone some form of Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) training, many of whom reported doing so only as a precaution and do not regularly encounter memetic hazards.\n\nAlthough genetics can lead to a higher initial CRV rating, it does not impact the training or development of further CRV protection. Data shows that the average CRV among civilians is approximately 2.37.[[footnote]]This data has been, and continues to be, collected under the guise of medical and psychological checkups.[[/footnote]] The highest recorded natural CRV value was 11, from 05-█.\n\nTraining courses are widely available. If you are interested and have not yet undergone CRV training, contact the Foundation Academic Service regarding an in-person training course or use their SCPiNET online course.\n\n++ Surgical Augmentation\nMany high-ranking personnel undergo surgical procedures as a form of permanent memetic inoculation, often developing resistances that exceed trainable limits. These procedures may be implemented for individuals requiring reliable, consistent, and nearly impenetrable protection. They are typically reserved for crucial Mobile Task Forces, select Site Directors, department heads, and, of course, Overwatch Command. A CRV of 7 must often be achieved before surgical inoculation to avoid complacency and overreliance on augments, which may endanger recipients.\n\nApproximately 0.7% of all Foundation personnel have some form of surgical augmentation against memetics.\n\n+++ Neuological Restructuring\nThe precise rearrangement of neurological structures can open new thought processes to better handle cognitive hazards and limit ones related to cognitohazardous conceptualizations. While this is one of the most common augmentations, the exact procedure is heavily classified.\n\n+++ Subtractive\nCareful removal of memetically susceptible brain regions can make the corresponding memetics harmless. An example of a similar procedure is removing someone's fear response, which might be viewed as a nonanomalous memetic effect, thus justifying the removal of the amygdala.\n\nHowever, this could lead to nonanomalous side-effects. For example, fear is an essential part of survival. Removing the amygdala may result in recklessness where one would typically be cautious. Subtractive surgery against memetics affecting the higher cognitive areas of the brain can inflict significant nonanomalous psychological damage. As such, this type of surgery is rarely used.\n\n+++ Additive\nOpposite to subtractive surgery, adding new areas of the brain can help patients better manage cognitive hazards. While this often simply provides more mental capacity to handle them, many function by rerouting all sensory input through these areas, filtering out harmful information before the brain registers it, at the expense of a few milliseconds of reaction time. However, this delay can be partially avoided by allowing the implant to concentrate only on details and higher-order realization and conceptualization, while basic ideas and features can enter the brain directly.\n\nThese new segments of the brain are cultivated in labs. Similar to some lab-grown organs, they are developed in mice and later removed for implantation, rather than being created from scratch. \n\n+++ Electronic\nElectronic implants can function very similarly to additive implants, rerouting sensory input through themselves before being directed to the brain. However, a number of technologies can improve the process's speed and effectiveness, sometimes utilizing anomalous phenomena.\n\nElectronic implants can often utilize basic sensory inoculants when triggered. For instance, when viewing a visual memetic hazard, the device may overlay a saved visual countermeme over the user's sight to help defend against it when available.[[footnote]]Connected to SCPiNET's inoculant database.[[/footnote]] Additionally, some may give the option to temporarily disable filtering should it be necessary.\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n**//Layered Categories and Subcategories of Long-Term Personal Memetic Inoculation Methods//**\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"color: white;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"9\" style=\"background-color: #da0b0b;\"]] **Trained for Cognitive Resistance:** 78% of all MTF agents.

However, most post-exposure treatments do not necessarily inoculate victims against future threats.\n\nAmnestics are one of the most widely-used post-exposure treatments, removing the memory of experiencing a memetic at all. Additionally, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kill-agents-and-you chemical kill agents] can be cured with medical intervention similarly to a nonanomalous condition. \n\nA more in-depth exploration of these devices would warrant a separate guide and introduction. Therefore, we will not delve further into this topic.\n\n++ Brief Overview of External Devices\nWe have included this as a related, tangential topic. However, most external devices do not necessarily inoculate users against threats.\n\nMobile Task Forces Eta-10 and Tau-5, \"Samsara,\" often utilize external devices to guard against cognitive hazards, particularly visual filters integrated into optoelectronic devices like their commonly used night vision and thermal vision goggles. Additionally, similar filters are used by Eta-11, \"Savage Beasts,\" within their helmets to filter out cognitohazardous audio.\n\nThese devices highly benefit from blocking all unfiltered sensory input. For example, both Eta-10 and Tau-5 optoelectronic devices have form-fitting shells that cover the area around the eyes to prevent unfiltered light from entering the user's peripheral vision.\n\nA more in-depth exploration of these devices would warrant a separate guide and introduction. Therefore, we will not delve further into this topic.\n\n+ Conclusion\nI hope this guide has fulfilled its purpose as a basic introduction to advanced memetic inoculation. However, some methods have not been disclosed to you yet, as they are simply beyond your pay grade.\n\nYou will receive further information at the appropriate time.\n\n _\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 137.5%]][[[Introduction to Memetic Inoculation]]] >> Introduction to Advanced Memetic Inoculation[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n _\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=--V--173]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
