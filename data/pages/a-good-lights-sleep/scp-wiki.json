It was a thankless job, but one she took pride in. She kept the world from the anomalous, the harmful and esoteric forces that hid in the shadows cast by the Foundation. But it was worth it, despite everything that came from it, the pain and the stress.\n\nShe took a sip from the mug by her bedside, filled to the brim with near-white, sugary to the first touch upon the tongue, coffee. It wasn't by her own choice that she was preparing herself for bed. Her assistants had advised that her forty-three-hour workday was likely not good for her health, but she waved them off for another five before they were able to convince on-site security to escort her to her room.\n\nShe'd really rather not do this and had made that fact well known while they took her back to her room. The fact is, she never had a good rest. Her brain was chock full of eyes and bright lights and forgotten dreams that leave her jolting up in the dead of night.\n\nBut they weren't going to let her out until she tried. She was going to humor them anyways. She laid down, closing her eyes. It takes a good few minutes until the blackness inherent to the back of someone's eyelids shifted into the buzzing greenish-purple color of slipping into sleep, the kind that you just forget right after you see it.\n\n[[div class=\"eventyr-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"storybook-hca\"]]\nSophia wakes in the First of many Spheres, the outermost Sphere. She's been here many times. Here, those who bend their vows are to stay. They greet Sophia with praise. They commend her return. She gives a nod and continues her descent. She has many more to reach. Many more to go to, but these are the least Holy of the Holy. She gives them ample attention.\n\nShe blinks, and she's awake in the Second of the Nine Spheres. The red soil under her shifts as she notices the light of something brighter than this sphere. The Glorious Victors and Revisionists of history greet Sophia, and she gives greetings to all of them. She progresses, taken by some unknown force to continue.\n\nShe's in the pink light of the Third Sphere now, the lovers and those who lacked in self-control, the very virtue of temperance, situated in this realm. They greet Sophia, and she blinks. She wants to ascend through them all quickly.\n\nThe wise give her advice in the moment she was in front of them in the Fourth Sphere. She tells them that she does not wish to hear from them. She will leave them quickly, she assures. They dictate the scripture to her, quoting [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] directly in unison. **\"'But I suffer not a woman to teach, nor to usurp authority over the man, but to be in silence.' Be silent and listen, or our Lord may take his vengeance on you.\"** Sophia recognizes this. She's not a theologian if she can't identify direct quotes from the Bible. First Timothy, second chapter, she thinks.\n\nThe Warriors of [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] in the Fifth Sphere demand she lay down her life for Him. She has ascended so far in heresy to the True Lord, she has not done anything worthy of coming this far.\n\nThe Just Rulers of the Six Sphere, the good rulers under [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] plead with Sophia to pray, plead with her to follow the path. [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] can change her however she pleases. She could take any form she wished.\n\nThose of the Seventh Sphere simply stare at her. An old Karcist, adorned in the bone and flesh of unknown people, calls her a heretic. Tells her that [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] will not forgive her if she comes to Him once more without proper praise.\n\nSophia sees the Saints, the Karcists, and those who are Holy under [[size 120%]] YHWH[[/size]]. The Saints jeer at her, yelling at her to repent now. The Karcists bow their heads, praying for her safety when she ascends once more, out of the Eighth Sphere and into the--\n\nPrimum Mobile. The Throne of The Lord. The Ninth Sphere. Light looked upon the form of this [[size 120%]] YHWH[[/size]]. The imaginably large wriggling mass of flesh held seven appendages high, each one a mockery of an angel, fleshy wings spread and distorted singing. They sang the praises of the thing that played God, each one singing a uniquely distorted melody. It did not blend into a song, and it scratched at her eardrums like nothing before.\n\nThey repeat and repeat an endless song, one that Sophia can't even hear the lyrics to, as the undulating mass of [[size 120%]] YHWH [[/size]] raises itself into a visage of a king, the crown of bone and dripping meat sitting atop a smile of thousands of teeth of varying shape and size, and it talks to Sophia.\n\n[[size 130%]]##red|YOU BELONG HERE, M██████. YOU ARE THE HOLIEST OF HOLY, YOU ARE DIVINE. JOIN MY ARCHONS AND SING FOREVER FOR ME.##[[/size]]\n\nShe didn't recognize what the monster before her said. It faded out of memory as soon as it was spoken, but it was important. It was something she recognized on instinct. The voice resonates in her head, piercing her brain like thousands of needles. She watches as it opens its mouth once more, the seven mockeries of Holy-- No, the \"Archons\", they spoke as it did, a perfect discordant unison, each voice blending into one, yet shrieking their own horrendous variance of the words.\n\n[[size 130%]]##red|SUBMIT. YOU KNOW IT WOULD BE EASIER. IT WOULD JUST BE EASIER. IT WOULD JUST LET YOU FINALLY REST, M██████. YOU WOULD TAKE YOUR PLACE NEAR MY THRONE. YOU COULD SHED THAT INFERIOR FORM.##[[/size]]\n\nShe grips her head, the melody trying to carve its way into her head, trying to rip and tear through her body and make her agree. Make her give the reverence that she so owes to the //obviously divine thing//. The wriggling mass of flesh and bone that smiles a disgusting smile and //makes// her submit. Divine.\n\n[[size 110%]] Divine. [[/size]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 120%]] Divine. [[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 130%]] ##grey|Divine.## [[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\nA calm floods her brain, ##grey|ceasing all her pain.## She rises, looking to the wriggling mass that calls itself [[size 90%]] YHWH[[/size]]. It is retracting, like an animal tightening itself against a wall. It sees something as a threat. The clear blue skies have twisted themselves into a dark night, shimmering with the light of stars. The stars, like small pieces of metal in the sky, shimmer like nothing else Sophia has seen. They form a constellation, a vague gear shape, which begins to turn, twisting with a methodical clicking. ##grey|It is like nothing before, the ticking.##\n\nThe words in her mind,\n##grey|They make their find;##\n##grey|Realize their rhyme--##\n##grey|It all comes, in due time.##\n\nSophia blinks, feeling herself begin to fall down from heaven, her eyes focusing on a metal titan before her. The titan forms a smile, which warms Sophia, despite the cold of the realm. She is a true goddess.\n\nThe name comes quick to her, ease of thinking returning from her time in [[size 90%]]YHWH's[[/size]] realm.\n\n[[size 120%]] ##grey|MEKHANE.## [[/size]]\n\nShe comforts you with her presence, as she beckons you to rest. ##grey|For all your tribulation, there is more to the test.##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"eventyr-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"eventypewriter\"]]\nSophia awakens from a dreamless sleep within her dream, the [[size 130%]] {{SOPHIA}} [[/size]] gazing down on her with countless bodies, each a form taken for a specific purpose.\n\n##grey|The rhythm and meter of Mekhane brings, the mechanical ring that springs.##\n\nEach form is divine in its own way, a [[size 130%]] {{PLEROMA}} [[/size]] they all spring from, one being emanating different forms for a purpose. What purpose?\n\nThe sky lined with forms of [[size 130%]] {{SOPHIA}} [[/size]] fades to black, as a figure begins to appear. The {{SERPENT}}, she wanted to call it, almost instinctively. The winding body of the serpent, as she started from the tail and moved, terminated in an almost humanoid torso atop it. Two arms, that looked somewhat grody and, somehow without looking at the other parts of the body, projected an ick of unprofessionalism to Sophia. Then, she heard the strumming sounds of a ukelele, turning her attention to the head of the {{SERPENT}}.\n\nFucking. Clef.\n\nOr at least, something that looks like him. Scales run up to the neck. The face is completely human, with the exception of two serpentine eyes.\n\n[[size 110%]] \"Hello, Sophia Light. Rest your head.\" [[/size]]\n\nSophia goes to say something, but the Serpent holds up a scaly hand.\n\n[[size 110%]] \"Do not argue. You have not slept peacefully in years. {{WE}} are trying to give you that.\"[[/size]]\n\nSophia lays down, trying to rest on the ground. The Serpent looks over her, blinking with a look of perplexment on its face. She sighs. \"I don't believe this is working.\"\n\n[[size 110%]] \"Of course it isn't. You'll need to use dream logic in a dream, little Sophia. Find a place of rest, a place that symbolically represents safety.\" [[/size]]\n\n\"I don't know what that would be--\"\n\n[[size 110%]] \"Then that is your trial, Sophia. Can you do this?\" [[/size]]\n\nShe looks down, formulating something, before returning her gaze to the Serpent. \"I can. Thank you for saving me from that thing.\"\n\n[[size 110%]] \"While it was me that did so, it was not all in the same. Now begin your journey, Sophia.\" [[/size]]\n\nSophia gives a curt nod to the Serpent and begins walking. While she is thankful for what it did for her, there could have been a more endearing form to take. She sees //him// every day, can she not get a little respite in her dreams?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"eventyr-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"eventypewriter\"]]\n[[=]]\nShe has a pace,\nShe has a time,\nShe has a place,\nShe needs to find.\n\nThe flow of her mind,\nDespite all the grime,\nThough the \"God\" tries to take her blind,\nIt guides her through this climb.\n\nThe song she sings,\nThe light it has,\nThe ANGEL that she brings—\n[[/=]]\n\nThe shield has broken. The rhyme now lost. Now the only rhythm to be found.\n\nIs the Flesh of [[size 140%]] ##red|GOD## [[/size]].\n\nLight hears him squelch. Hears him scream. Hears him make his formal decree.\n\n[[div class=\"storybook-hca\"]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|FOR ALL THE ONES WHO ARE NOT ME## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|YOU WILL ONLY KNOW PAIN.## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|THE **SPARK** INSIDE OF YOU ALL## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|SHALL FOREVER BE FORGOTTEN## [[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe pain **sparks** as she hears his words, gripping her head and screaming.\n\nThere is no rhythm to be regained, no ##grey|Mekhane## or [[size 80%]] SOPHIA [[/size]] to stop her pain.\n\nIt just **emanates** eternal pain. Words spoken again and again, she squeals and screams, and it starts all again. It's repetitive, but not enough to form even a rhythm of pain. It just goes random and random.\n\n[[div class=\"storybook-hca\"]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|THIS IS WHAT YOU GET, YOU KNOW.## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|YOU DID NOT HEED WHAT I HAD SAID,## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|SO NOW I TAKE WHAT IS MINE, LEFT IN YOUR HEAD.## [[/size]]\n[[size 140%]] ##red|YOU MUST THINK YOURSELF DIVINE. ABOVE ME EVEN.## [[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAnd so its tendrils touch her head, showing her pain and burning her. She feels the flood washing over her. Forty days of suffocation. She feels the waves crashing over her, the waves killing her, everything being taken by this horrific cleansing of the world.\n\nAnd as the waves crashed again and again, she decided she would not [[size 110%]] ##red|REPENT## [[/size]]. She was content to die that day, trapped inside the [[size 110%]] ##red|\"GOD'S\"## [[/size]] domain. As she closed her eyes, it all began to spark. The Divine and the Holy truly emanating.\n\nThe flesh enveloped the sky, the [[size 90%]] false god [[/size]] shrieking as he tried to keep her in. M███ael spreads her wings, smashing through the firmament of meat into the realms above.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"eventyr-hr\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSophia stretches her arms out, yawning. She rubs the dust out of her eyes, grumbling as she finds her glasses, hidden within the haphazardly thrown about sheets. It wasn't her fault though, she didn't really think she would be sleeping.\n\nShe puts on her glasses, getting up to acquire a cup of coffee, as a stray thought passes her mind. It's so vile that it comes out of her mouth, venomous and confused.\n\n\"... why the fuck am I dreaming of //Clef.//\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=DoctorLilithSophia]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
