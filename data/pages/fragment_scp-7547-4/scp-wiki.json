The young couple laid on the beach, sand to their backs, staring up at the stars. Adam was using the other’s bicep as a pillow, with Evan propping his own head up with their towels.\n\n“You know,” Adam began, “this one night I was walking along the beach with my family, when all of a sudden we see this weird white thing coming towards us from the ocean. And it was coming //fast//. We couldn’t comprehend what it was until it reached the shore and turned out to just be a small boat. My cousin thought it was a shark at first.”\n\n“Was there someone driving the boat?” Evan asked.\n\n“Yeah, there was. But now I’m thinking, like, in the stars, the sky and stuff. What if something weird-looking started falling towards us real fast right now, and we couldn't understand what it was 'til it got close enough and it was just a bird or satellite or whatever?”\n\n“I’d go ‘whoa’ and then throw you into the water like Mario.”\n\nAdam laughed. Evan smiled and pulled his boyfriend closer to him to cuddle. They quietly laid in each other’s embrace, before Evan chimed, “Adam and Evan, made in heaven.”\n\n“That’s stupid,” Adam said.\n\nEvan gave him a kiss on the head, “You’re stupid.”\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nDear Evan Boothe,\n\nWe were all very excited to meet and get to know you over the past few days. We have been impressed with your background and would like to formally offer you the position of data entry clerk. This is a full time position, Mon-Fri, 9-5. You will be reporting to the head of the Archival department. //Please note that Maine is an at-will state. That means that this branch of Alysída Ltd. is free to end the employment relationship at any time, with or without notice or cause.//\n\nYour expected starting date is Monday of next week. You will be required to sign //confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements// at the beginning of your employment.\n\nIt would be in your best interest to respond to us within the next two days. In the meantime, please feel free to contact me or Jeffery via email, should you have any questions.\n\nWe are all looking forward to having you on our team.\n\nBest regards,\n\nFrank Derikson\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n“What’re you thinking we should eat?” Evan asked, head firmly glued to the couch cushion.\n\n“Uhhh…” Adam scanned the kitchen cabinet, “we could have chili… we could… I…” He pulls out a soup can. “Why do you always write ‘Mr’ in front of all the Campbell’s Chicken Soup we have?”\n\n“Because Mr Campbell took a gamble and now his life’s in shambles.”\n\n“...Oh?”\n\n“He got turned into a soup can, basically.”\n\n“Ahhhh.”\n\n“To make ends meet.”\n\n“I see.”\n\nEvan sat himself up and stretched, “I don’t know, I started doing it when I was, like, six and just kept doing it. I think it’s cause the name looks naked otherwise.”\n\n“Naked, forced to wear a can cause he’s broke.”\n\nEvan turned around, a goofy smile on his face, “Hey, now you’re getting it!”\n\nAdam smirked, leaning back against the kitchen counter, “So, how did the job go?”\n\n“It went pretty well!” Evan beamed, “They showed me around, gave me the rundown on how they do things, then I just did the work.”\n\n“Nice.”\n\n------\n\nThe apartment felt static, like someone stuck a pin in space-time and left it to fester in the moment. Adam’s mind was churning, replaying how the talk could go, mentally rehearsing what he was going to say. This shouldn’t have felt awkward, but it did. They were still happy together, so why bring it up?\n\nThe door opened, “I’m back.” Evan shuffled his feet on the mat, removing whatever moisture still clung to his boots.\n\nAdam stuck his hands in his pockets. Just rip the band-aid off. “Uhhh… so, how was work?” Alright, but lead into it then.\n\n“It was fine.” Evan walked past him, heading for the kitchen.\n\n“Right, yeah. Uhh, Evan. I wanted to talk about… you’ve been feeling more… distant, lately.”\n\n“Uh huh.” He set the oven to preheat, not looking at his boyfriend.\n\n“We don’t really spend time together anymore. You don’t seem to spend time with //anyone// anymore, no one except your coworkers.”\n\nEvan turned slightly, narrowing his eyes, “What are you getting at?”\n\nAdam raised his hands disarmingly, “Nothing! It’s just…” He sighed, “Do you really need to go to every after-work outing they have?”\n\nEvan walked over and held Adam’s shoulders gently, “I’m not staying away by choice. The guys at the office said the social events are pretty much mandatory here. If I could choose to hang out with you instead, I would, and the next chance I have, I will.” He pulled him in for a hug. Adam reciprocated.\n\n------\n\n\n> **Summary of Event:** Man at local model railway club caused a disturbance, leading to a brawl. The perpetrator, Evan Boothe, was repeatedly aggressive and argumentative during the meeting, according to witnesses. Boothe acted as a contrarian on all the topics brought up during the meeting, culminating in one of the other members pushing him, to which he responded with physical violence. By the time local authorities arrived, Boothe had already left the premises, heading towards the Alysída building.\n\n\"Fucking idiots,\" Evan pinned the clump of paper towels to his face, blocking the waterfall of blood in his nose.\n\n\"I... you said //what// happened at your club meeting?\"\n\n\"Got into a fight cause they couldn't handle someone having a different opinion on fucking //model trains.//\" He paced around the living room, \"You know I noticed it for a while, but this made me fully realize those guys are a literal hive-mind. //Everyone// thinks the same thing. //Everyone// says the same thing.\"\n\nAdam said nothing.\n\n\"Heh. I guess it's a good thing I left. Stuff at work is getting more demanding, and my office buddies are ten times more enjoyable to be around than those club freaks.\"\n\n------\n\nThe two walked around the museum, having their first proper date in what felt like ages. “So… why’s your company giving you guys back your own free time all of a sudden?” Adam asked.\n\n“It’s a part of this work-life balance thing they’re having us do. They put a lot of emphasis on keeping our spouses close to us.”\n\n“Well tha– we’re not even married yet,” Adam chuckled.\n\n“We will be.”\n\nThey held each other’s hand. Adam smiled.\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ Austin\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]hey man you and evan want to have dinner at my place? everyone else is coming[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Sorry, we would if we could but Evan already booked us a restaurant for a date night.

It teaches you to be weak and dependent on those around you. It keeps people in this herd mentality, where if you try to be self-sufficient then you’ll get killed.”\n\n“Right.” Adam stared at his plate, rolling a pea back and forth with his fork.\n\n“You gotta learn to be the predator, get used to the taste of meat and the feeling of blood beneath your feet. Those bonding exercises we do at work teach me way more than college ever did.”\n\nAdam stood up and left the dining room. “Where are you going?” Evan demanded.\n\n“To take the garbage out.”\n\n“Where are you //actually// going?”\n\nAdam gave an incredulous look, “Do you want to come?”\n\n“Fine.”\n\n------\n\n\n> Mammals are inherently superior to every other form of life. They are at the top of every food-chain, they contribute more to the ecosystem than plants or bugs. Our own species is proof of this fact. \n> \n> The economic world is like the ocean: vast, complex, and full of opportunity. The fish and squids are unimportant, they are either tools to be used or profits to be made. Mammalian sea-life are the real players here. Now, think of the different types of aquatic mammals as stand-ins for the types of people that succeed in the business world. Sealions are aggressive, they see something in their sights and they take it. However, they work in places where profit isn't always easy to come by, and they're at risk of larger businesses gutting or consuming them, like orcas.\n> \n> Elephant seals fair a bit better. They're larger, so they can take what they want. They're vicious, so they don't get fucked with often. They are biologically resourceful and are perfectly suited to their environment. They're big, but not big enough: birds and cats will steal their milk without them even noticing; cookiecutter sharks will bite chunks out of their meat, robbing the elephant seal of its resources.\n> \n> Whales are self-sufficient. They take what they need without effort. They are immune to cancer. Nothing messes with them. Any bites taken out of them are literally nothing, they haven't lost any real profit. And whoever does steal from them will just die anyway. They're the biggest mammals not just in the ocean, but in the whole world. The whale is the apex of success, just take a look at Disney or Amazon. This idea is universal and applies to any career you can think of. Untouchable giants, that's what you should strive for. Red whales, kings of the sea.\n> \n> [[>]]\n> --Frank Derikson, Alysída Ltd.\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n\n“It //is// fine,” Adam said. “It’s… I don't know, this is just a phase, I think”\n\n“Adam, when was the last time you actually felt happy together?” His friend asked.\n\n“I…” Adam sighed, “Yeah. You’re right. I just wish you weren’t.” \n\n------\n\n[[module CSS]]\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Cinzel');\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Anton');\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Pinyon+Script');\n#page-title { display: none; }\n/*\n    The Anton font was created by Vernon Adams and is licensed under the Open Font License\n    The Cinzel font was created by Natanael Gama and is licensed under the Open Font License\n    The Pinyon Script font was created by Nicole Fally and is licensed under the Open Font License\n*/\n.twopanel {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: row wrap;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n}\n.bit {\n    flex-basis: 48%;\n}\n@media only screen and (max-width: 768px) {\n    .twopanel {flex-direction: row-reverse;}\n    .bit {flex-basis: 100%;}\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: center\"]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-family: 'Cinzel'; font-size: 300%; margin: 2px 0 5px;\"]]\nPORTLAND PRESS HERALD\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"font-family: serif; font-size: 105%; border-top-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid;\"]]\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left;\"]]\nPORTLAND, MAINE\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\nJULY 14TH, 2012\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n$1.25\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"twopanel\"]]\n[[div class=\"bit\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: justify\"]]\n[[span style:\"serif\"]][[size 125%]]**Massacre at Manahiem**[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[span style:\"serif\"]][[size 75%]]By George Bucy[[/size]][[/span]]\n@@ @@\nFive bodies were found in the Manahiem department store.\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .5\"]]\nAuthorities have not yet disclosed the identities of the victims...\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"bit\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: justify\"]]\n[[span style:\"serif\"]][[size 125%]]**Alysída’s Cult Exposed**[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[span style:\"serif\"]][[size 75%]]By George Bucy[[/size]][[/span]]\n@@ @@\n[[div_ style=\"opacity: .5\"]]\nWorkplace abuse at the nearby Alysída building was brought to light by an anonymous worker, who reported that the...\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7547/offset/5 (V/VII) --->]\n[[/>]]",
