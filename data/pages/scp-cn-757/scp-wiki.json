Information regarding the location has been redacted. For further samples of advertisements, see [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-757-art|here]]].\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A temporary site has been set up near SCP-CN-757 at which MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" has been stationed. This Mobile Task Force's information is not to be entered into any Foundation databases. Every month, ██ agents from this Task Force must be dispatched to the interior of SCP-CN-757 for exploration, primarily to determine spatial and personnel-related changes in the interior, and conduct interviews with subjects within to ascertain further information. At the same time, non-participating Foundation agents are to seal the entrance to SCP-CN-757 and monitor and delete information published to users in a timely manner. Instances who have already entered SCP-CN-757 must be interviewed by Foundation front company \"Special Creative Park Organization\" and amnesticized. Class D personnel are not to be allowed to enter SCP-CN-757.\n\nContainment procedures have been updated following Incident CN-757-G. Level 3 or higher personnel are to read the associated addendum for the latest information.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-757 is a spatial anomaly, currently located in a six-storey old-style residential tower near ████████ Park, ███████ District, Shanghai City. Besides the button on the top of the building, there is no way to enter SCP-CN-757; the front door and windows do not allow for access to SCP-CN-757. There is also no way to enter the original interior of the residential tower; it is suspected that it has been entirely replaced by SCP-CN-757. The exterior of the residential tower is equipped with a scissor lift, allowing for access to the roof.\n\nThe roof of SCP-CN-757 contains one self-service payment station and one red button. After a human subject pays the 50 renminbi entrance fee[[footnote]]The entrance fee can be paid using cash, card or QR code; card and QR code payment is made to an unknown user. Despite the fact that the QR code does not match any payment platform, it can still be used.[[/footnote]], pressing the button will take them to any floor of SCP-CN-757. SCP-CN-757 contains --50-- --60-- 70 floors, including the roof. After the subject enters SCP-CN-757, the anomaly will telepathically inform them of the \"rules of the game\", the main rules being the following:\n\n* Every floor in the game contains a red button. Pressing the red button will take the player to a floor that they have not yet visited at random; this teleportation will not cause the player any harm.\n* The player must find the red button in this floor and press it. If the player is sent back to the roof, this constitutes \"winning the game\".\n* Entering or leaving certain floors requires completing tasks in other floors; without completing these tasks, it is very difficult to leave these floors. Pressing the button will not send the player to a floor with incomplete prerequisites.\n* Some floors can be reached without the teleportation function of the button.\n* Any tools that may assist the player in completing the game will be deleted upon entering the game, and will be returned upon completion.\n* Upon entering the room, objects within are free to be taken to to the next level; however, they must be in contact with the player, e.g. held in their hand or in their pocket.\n* Players are free to communicate with the workers within the game.\n* Players can spend money on certain levels to obtain in-game coins at a 1:1 rate with renminbi. Money spent will be automatically deducted from the player's assets.\n\nPlayers who have successfully left SCP-CN-757 will be afflicted with a mental effect that expresses itself as praise of the gameplay experience of SCP-CN-757 and unclear memories of their experiences within the game. They will also have a high chance of recommending SCP-CN-757 to other instances, and a corresponding amount of electronic devices belonging to these instances will begin to display advertisements for SCP-CN-757. Although these advertisements are universally intended to encourage instances to play SCP-CN-757, the content of the advertisements differs widely, to the point that some of them incorrectly describe the contents of the game. However, all advertisements appear to be \"extremely attractive\" to the viewers.\n\nThe following is a list of observations and game mechanics present in each floor.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-CN-757 Floor Chart\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n||~ Floor ||~ Setting ||~ Notes ||\n|| 1F || Toilet consisting of only a toilet bowl, a roll of toilet paper and an emergency telephone || Can only be accessed after completing Floor 4. This floor has no button, and the only means of escape is to complete the prerequisite on Floor 4 or call for help on the emergency phone. ||\n|| 2F || Elevator || The button is the red emergency phone button. At the same time, pressing any button will take the player to that floor, including already visited floors; however, the buttons for floors 1 (toilet), 2 (same floor, elevator), 41 (corridor), 56 (library) and 69 (unknown) and 70 (roof) are absent. ||\n|| 3F || Dentist's room || ||\n|| 4F || An aged apartment with a line outside the window and an unusable phone || An employee is present on this floor, which will ask the player if they wish to pull the line. Prerequisite for Floor 1. ||\n|| 5F || Toilet clean room || There is a door, but it cannot be opened. The button is the red lock button on the mop. Cleaning tools can be taken out of the room. ||\n|| 6F || Shipping container || No light is present in the room; without the paper lantern from Floor 9 (attic) or the flashlight from Floor 39 (storeroom), it is very difficult to find the button. If the player spends a long time in this room, the door of the container will open, leading to Floor 57 (construction depot). ||\n|| 7F || Japanese-style tatami room, with screens forming a simple maze || ||\n|| 8F || Changing room, with a mirror on one wall and all other walls plain white || Using the mirror, it can be discovered that the button is on the bottom of the chair; however, the player must press the button reflected in the mirror. If the player passes through the mirror, they can reach Floor 20 (cloakroom). ||\n|| 9F || Attic || There are blueprints and tools on the table that can be used to create a paper lantern. A blueprint depicting puppets is present, which can also be taken out. Prerequisite for Floor 41 (corridor). ||\n|| 10F || Trash room, extremely dusty || Button is the red fire alarm button. If the player does not press the button in time, the room will slowly fill with water and the player will be sent to a random floor below Floor 10. The cleaning tools from Floor 5 can be used to quickly clean out the dust. ||\n|| 11F || Ticket office || An exchange machine is present on this floor, which can be used to exchange game coins for tickets. All tickets are 10 coins, and can be used on floors 40 (metro hub), 58 (theater) and 64 (mall). However, the chances of being sent to these floors remains the same even after buying tickets. ||\n|| 12F || Studio || The button is inside the bust statue, and must be reached by opening it with the palette knife. The room is full of poor calligraphy, recently finished. ||\n|| 13F || Puppet room || The button is located on the interior of a random puppet's clothes. ||\n|| 14F || Retail department || An exchange machine is present on this floor, which can be used to exchange game coins for food and tools. Recruitment posters are pasted at the checkout, along with a realistic mannequin of unknown material. ||\n|| 15F || Ruined hotel lobby || A receptionist is present on this floor; talking to them has a chance of sending the player to Floor 63 (presidential suite). ||\n|| 16F || Piano room || ||\n|| 17F || Black room with vinyl records on walls || Button is in the center of a random record. If the player plays this record to the end on the gramophone, the player can obtain a musical score. ||\n|| 18F || Izakaya || Button is a red call-for-service button. An exchange machine is present on this floor, which can be used to obtain game coins and request food and drink from the employees. In some cases, tables and chairs on this floor are placed haphazardly and many just-used eating utensils are present. ||\n|| 19F || Internet cafe || Button is a random computer's red power button; all other power buttons are blue. No payment is required on this floor. Computers are high-end and are equipped with various real-life games, which can be normally logged into with real accounts; however, all other players in these games are nonexistent. In reality, these accounts will not show as logged in. The computers are also equipped with early beta versions of games produced by various studios under Letters Entertainment, which do not appear to possess any anomalous properties. ||\n|| 20F || Cloakroom || Floor 8 (changing room) can be directly accessed through the mirror. All clothes confiscated from the player upon entry for providing an advantage can be found here and can be taken away; likewise, all objects in this room and considered items and can be removed.||\n|| 21F || Hospital room || ||\n|| 22F || Laboratory || ||\n|| 23F || Pet shop || No employees or exchange machines are present, and pets cannot be bought or taken out of the floor. Pets present are mostly common pets like cats, dogs, rabbits and mice; however, they are markedly more docile and appear to be able to understand human language. ||\n|| 24F || Fast food outlet || An exchange machine is present on this floor, which can be used to obtain game coins and purchase food from employees. ||\n|| 25F || Bookstore || Employees are present on this floor who will give the user a book and request that they \"return it to its original place\". An exchange machine is present on this floor, which allows the player to purchase other books. Books present appear to change as books are published in the real world. Prerequisite for Floor 56 (library). ||\n|| 26F || Gym || One piece of equipment will be marked in red; the button appears upon using that machine on the highest setting ||\n|| 27F || Kitchen || ||\n|| 28F || Private room in a high-class restaurant || This floor is equipped with an exchange machine, but no employees are present. The exchange machine can be used to order food, which will be transported to the table. ||\n|| 29F || Antique shop || This floor has no exchange machine, but items can be purchased by talking to the shop owner. Normally, the owner will refuse to sell anything, stating that \"you do not have enough money to buy anything\". However, upon retrieving a large sum of money from Floor 47 (bank), items can be brought and taken out of the floor; all antiques bought from this shop have been shown to be genuine. ||\n|| 30F || Computer room || Turning on all power sources (which will shine red upon activation) will complete the room. Only 3D modeling software is installed on the computers; models of humans, animals and scenes are saved on the computers. These files cannot be deleted.  ||\n|| 31F || Billiards room || Button is inside one of the pockets. ||\n|| 32F || Indoor rock climbing room || Button is a random red hold. ||\n|| 33F || Arcade with tablet games || Button is a random red button on one of the arcade machines; all other buttons are not red. The tablet games have some early versions of games produced by Letters Entertainment, and do not possess anomalous properties. ||\n|| 34F || Recreational vehicle || The exterior shows various scenery, which is actually a looping series of images. ||\n|| 35F || Haunted house || Interior contains several unknown floating entities, which cannot be talked to. ||\n|| 36F || Graveyard || All gravestones are engraved with a name and a one or two-digit number. These names do not appear to correspond to any real person. ||\n|| 37F || Printing room || Besides existing printers and copiers, a large-size 3D printer is present in the room, using an unknown material matching that of the mannequin on Floor 14 (retail department). ||\n|| 38F || Classroom || This room is the only room where the player can see other players. The button is located in the storage compartment under one of the desks; when a player presses the button, it transfers to another random desk. A staircase can be used to access Floor 39 (storeroom); however, Floor 39 is a singleplayer room, and it is conjectured that different players will be sent to different instances of Floor 39. ||\n|| 39F || Storeroom || A staircase can be used to access Floor 38. Any tools confiscated from the player upon entry for providing an advantage can be found in this room, and can be taken out. In addition, the player can find other tools, such as a skeleton key, flashlight, and extra button. The extra button can be taken to any floor and functions identically to the red button. Prerequisite for Floor 41 (corridor). ||\n|| 40F || Metro hub || Button is a random red selection button on any of the ticketing machines. If the player has bought a ticket on Floor 11 (ticket office), they may select one of the four metro lines to take. The metro lines go to a random unvisited, unlocked floor in their range; the ranges are 1-9, 21-29, 41-49 and 61-68 respectively. If the player has gone to every floor in that range, they will be sent to a random floor in the range. ||\n|| 41F || Corridor || The doors on the side of the corridor cannot be opened; the button is on one of the doors. The corridor is dark and the paper lantern from Floor 9 (attic) or the flashlight from Floor 39 (storeroom) are required to light it. This floor can only be accessed after reaching Floor 9 or 39. ||\n|| 42F || Abandoned office || Interior is aged; in some cases, one room's air conditioning is turned on and the room is water stained. ||\n|| 43F || Large unfinished room || ||\n|| 44F || Hot spring public bath || In some cases, some of the towels show signs of being recently used. ||\n|| 45F || Garage || Button is one of the lights on a random car. This room has no entrances or exits.||\n|| 46F || Showcase room || Button is on the player's back, and can be viewed through the glass. The showcase displays the user's past, which extends to Foundation agents. According to interviews, in a very small number of cases, tour guides have appeared on this floor; Foundation agents have not yet encountered tour guides. ||\n|| 47F || Bank || An exchange machine is present on this floor. Conversing with the bank employees allows for the player to exchange large amounts of money. ||\n|| 48F || Indoor play area || ||\n|| 49F || Indoor pool || Button is at the bottom of the pool. ||\n|| 50F || Secret chamber || Rooms must be opened by solving puzzles; the button is located in the last room opened. The skeleton key obtained on Floor 39 (storeroom) or bought on Floor 14 (retail department) may be used to open some of the doors. ||\n|| 51F || Chapel || Several caskets are located below the floor. ||\n|| 52F || Market || Exchange machines are present on this floor, which allow the player to exchange currency to buy raw food from the sellers. The player can use these supplies to cook at any floor equipped with a kitchen, or request that an employee cook with the food on any restaurant floor. ||\n|| 53F || Ballroom || The disco ball must be arranged to shine light on a certain object to activate the button. ||\n|| 54F || Sitcom set || ||\n|| 55F || Indoor tropical garden || ||\n|| 56F || Library || Floor 25 (bookstore) must be visited to enter. The button can be retrieved upon taking the book from Floor 25 to the librarian on this floor. If this is not done, the player must complete a book-sorting task. ||\n|| 57F || Construction depot and distribution site || Button is on one of the packages, and must be retrieved using a forklift. This floor can be reached by waiting on Floor 6 (shipping container), but it is impossible to reach Floor 6 from this floor. ||\n|| 58F || Theater || If a ticket is purchased from Floor 11 (ticket office), performers will emerge on the stage and perform. However, no other employees or audience members are present. If a ticket is not brought to the floor, no performance will occur. ||\n|| 59F|| Dormitory || A large number of rooms is present on this floor; the skeleton key from Floor 14 (retail department) or Floor 39 (storeroom) can be used to open them. Some rooms have human subjects sleeping in them, but they cannot be awoken. ||\n|| 60F || Giant room with ladders and no floor || The ladders must be used to reach the side of the room opposite the starting point, where the button is located. Pressing the button will take the player to a random room from Floors 61-68; falling will take the player to a random room below Floor 30. The player will not be taken to a previously explored room unless all options have been explored. ||\n|| 61F || Museum courtyard || Players can ask employees about the museum's exhibits, which are described in pamphlets and change over time. However, no exhibition halls are accessible. ||\n|| 62F || Factory || Primarily produces spare parts. Large 3D printers identical to those found on Floor 37 (printing room) can be found here. ||\n|| 63F || Presidential suite || Can be accessed through Floor 15 (hotel lobby) but not vice versa. Workers will periodically arrive to clean the room and bring food. ||\n|| 64F || One floor of a mall || A large number of shops and restaurants and a cinema are present. All shops and restaurants are equipped with exchange machines, which allow the player to buy items. If the player has a ticket from Floor 11 (ticket office), the player can enter the cinema, which will display a recent film from the real world. No escalators or elevators are present on the floor. ||\n|| 65F || Train station departure hall || Button is located on a random gantry, which will be the only one colored red. There is no way to pass through to the ticketed area. ||\n|| 66F || Giant toilet || Player will typically be placed on a high place (such as the top of the drawer), and must reach the button in a lower place (such as in the sink). The player must use tools to safely descend to the button, such as by using a towel as a parachute. ||\n|| 67F || Maze || There is no exit and all roads are dead ends. Parts of the button can be found at each dead end, which must be combined to create the button. ||\n|| 68F || Village || No villagers are present; all shops are self-serve. The floor is encased in a giant sky screen. ||\n|| 69F || Unknown || No agents or players have successfully reached this floor; it is unknown whether this is a feature of this floor or the random transportation mechanic. ||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-CN-757 Game Mechanics and Features\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n* Regardless of the floor, it is possible to see the scenery outside the building as long as there is a window on that floor; the view corresponds to the fourth or fifth floor of the original residential tower.\n* The red button's location is typically random, but seems to follow certain rules on certain levels, e.g. the button always appears on a random red brake signal lamp. The shape of the button may also be different on each level, and some buttons can only be found after completing certain tasks. Button positions that follow a rule are listed above; floors with completely random button positions do not have a position listed.\n* Similarly to how the rules are announced to the player, the player will be telepathically informed of the floor number they are on.\n* In general, the higher the floor number, the larger the size of the floor.\n* Playing the game comes with the risk of death; if the button is not found, staying on the same floor for too long may lead to starvation or bodily harm (e.g. Floor 66, giant toilet).\n* Some floors have other floors as prerequisites; if the player does not complete a certain task in the prerequisite floor, it is very hard to continue. On these floors, it is possible to use the extra button obtained on Floor 39 (storeroom). The following is a list of all floors with prerequisites:\n||~ Floor ||~ Prerequisite floor ||~ Task ||~ Alternative task ||\n|| 1F (toilet) || 4F (small room) || Pull the line || Use the emergency phone on Floor 1, which will connect to the phone on Floor 4 in another player's instance. If the player on Floor 4 pulls the line twice, the player on Floor 1 will be automatically transferred. During the conversation, any information relating to Floors 1 and 4's tasks will be automatically blocked. It is possible to use the phone multiple times. ||\n|| 56F (library) || 25F (bookstore) || Return the book || Complete the book-sorting task on Floor 56 as requested by the librarians; this will take about 5 hours. ||\n|| 41F (corridor) || 9F (attic) or 39F (storeroom) || Create the paper lantern or obtain the flashlight || Randomly feel the walls of the corridor. ||\n* Some floors allow for direct access to other floors; see the table below.\n||~ Floor ||~ Connected floor ||~ Notes ||\n|| 2F (elevator) || Any other floor, except for Floors 1 (toilet), 2 (elevator), 41 (corridor), 56 (library), 69 (unknown) and 70 (roof) || Pressing the corresponding button will take the player to that floor. ||\n|| 6F (shipping container) || 57F (construction depot) || Staying on Floor 6 for some time will allow the player to directly go to Floor 57. There is no way to reach Floor 6 from Floor 57. ||\n|| 8F (changing room) || 20F (cloakroom) || Can be accessed through the mirror; one-use. ||\n|| 15F (hotel lobby) || 63F (presidential suite) || Talking to the receptionist on Floor 15 can take the player directly to Floor 63. There is no way to reach Floor 15 from Floor 63. ||\n|| 38F (classroom) || 39F (storeroom) || The staircase allows players to move between the two floors freely. No restriction is placed on the number of times this can be used. ||\n|| 40F（metro hub） || Random unvisited floor with no prerequisites between 1-9, 21-29, 41-49 or 61-68 || A ticket from Floor 11 (ticketing office) is required. ||\n* Some floors have a trophy system; it is unknown what acquiring the trophy actually does. After acquiring a trophy, a trophy-shaped symbol will appear on the back of the player's right hand; it will disappear after completion. Currently discovered trophies are as follows:\n||~ Trophy ||~ Affected floors ||~ Task ||\n|| 1 || 1F (toilet), 4F (small room) || Successfully leave and escape Floor 1, regardless of method ||\n|| 2 || 9F (attic), 13F (puppet room) || Arrange the puppets on Floor 13 according to the blueprint on Floor 9 ||\n|| 3 || 16F (piano room), 17F (vinyl room) || Perform the musical score from Floor 17 on the piano on Floor 16 ||\n|| 4 || 20F (cloakroom), 39F (storeroom) || Reclaim all items confiscated at the beginning of the game ||\n|| 5 || 22F (laboratory), 52F (market) || Use the equipment on Floor 22 to cook a meal ||\n|| 6 || 25F (bookstore), 56F (library) || Having returned the book, complete the librarian's task on Floor 56 anyway ||\n|| 7 || 26F (gym) || Put the treadmill on the highest setting and run for 3 minutes ||\n|| 8 || 31F (billiards room) || Pocket every ball except the cue ball in one of the pockets without the button ||\n|| 9 || 32F (rock climbing room) || Climb to the top of the wall ||\n* Some floors have exchange machines, which can be used to exchange renminbi for in-game coins at a 1:1 rate. Coins can be used to buy items in the game. Money exchanged goes to an unknown account. The following is a list of all exchange machines and purchasing points:\n||~ Floor ||~ Exchange machines ||~ Employees ||~ Purchasable products ||\n|| 11F (ticket office) || Yes || Yes || Tickets usable on Floors 40 (metro hub), 58 (theater) and Floor 64 (mall). ||\n|| 14F (retail department) || Yes || No || Food and tools (skeleton key) ||\n|| 18F (izakaya) || Yes || Yes || Alcohol and food ||\n|| 23F (fast food store) || Yes || Yes || Food ||\n|| 25F (bookstore) || Yes || Yes || Books ||\n|| 28F (restaurant private room) || Yes || No || Food ||\n|| 29F (antique shop) || No || Yes || Antiques (requires large quantity of coins) ||\n|| 47F (bank) || Yes || Yes || No items can be bought, only coins ||\n|| 52F (market) || Yes || Yes || Cooking supplies ||\n|| 64F (mall) || Yes || Yes || Food, clothing, etc. ||\n|| 68F (village) || Yes || No || Food, clothing, etc. ||\n* The flow of time within SCP-CN-757 is the same as in reality. There are some connections between the interior and reality, such as the updating of movies and books within.\n* The chances of reaching certain floors is higher for some floors such as Floor 47 (bank) and Floor 46 (showcase room), and smaller for others such as Floor 68 (village) and Floor 59 (dormitory). No records relating to Floor 69 have been recorded.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFoundation exploration of SCP-CN-757 began on ██/██/20██. Initial plans involved sending batches of Class D personnel into the anomaly; however, this plan was shelved for a significant period of time, and the Class D intake for that season dropped by 20%. At the same time, SCP-CN-757's floor count expanded from 50 to 60. As such, it is suspected that some Class D personnel were actually sent into SCP-CN-757, but did not return; their existences were thus subject to an antimemetic effect. As the rules did not mention the outcome of \"not completing\" the game, it is currently unknown where these personnel are located. Following this, exploration was transferred to MTF-庚午-01 \"Only Fragrance\". However, almost all agents left SCP-CN-757 having been to less than 10 floors; this did not match with other subjects who had cleared SCP-CN-757 (who typically had to progress through at least 30 floors). As such, it is suggested that the operators of SCP-CN-757 are to a certain degree aware of the Foundation, and do not wish for the Foundation to perform extensive exploration of the interior. At the same time, the transportation mechanic of the red buttons is not completely random, and is to some possibly large degree controlled by an operator.\n\nFollowing this, Site-CN-34 created a new task force, MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\", specifically to explore SCP-CN-757. Information on the members of this MTF are restricted to Level 3 or higher personnel, and must be stored on paper and not electronically. This MTF is to live as if they were normal members of society, and contact is to be done through specialized devices. MTF-庚午-18 achieved a larger degree of success in exploring SCP-CN-757; as anti-memory-effect drugs had been administered, members could clearly remember the events that occurred within SCP-CN-757 even after winning the game. At the same time, extensive interviews with individuals who had cleared SCP-CN-757 (partial interview logs can be seen in Addenda CN-757-A and CN-757-B) revealed some further information. In addition to the above information, prior exploration has revealed the following information about SCP-CN-757:\n\n* Although most items brought into SCP-CN-757 can be used upon recovery, communication and recording devices are non-functional within SCP-CN-757. Combined with the memory effect placed on players who clear the game, it is suspected that this is to prevent leakage of information.\n* It is currently unknown what happens after a player dies within SCP-CN-757; it is suspected that a similar antimeme is applied as with the D-class personnel. It is also suspected that the gravestones on Floor 36 (graveyard) and the remains on 51 (chapel) are in some way related to the dead instances, but it is unknown what difference the two floors have. As the game is not particularly difficult, the estimated number of failed attempts is lower than the number of distinct remains and gravestones on these two floors. The locations of these players and the D-Class sent in by the Foundation are currently unknown.\n* The layout of the floors will change depending on the circumstances and tastes of the player, most notably on Floor 46 (showroom). It is currently unknown how SCP-CN-757 obtains information relating to its players; however, MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" has succeeded in exploration, indicating that it does not read the thoughts of the player. The main theory is that the game conducts a large-scale online search for information relating to the player, which also explains the variety in advertisements depending on the person.\n* Humanoid instances on each floor differ based on the player, but mostly share some common points; for instance, the employee on Floor 4 is always a male in his 50s, and the receptionist on Floor 15 (hotel lobby) is always an attractive female in her 20s. Some players claim that these instances \"left a deep impression on them\" or \"politely initiated conversation\"; other than members of MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\", no Foundation agents had similar experiences.\n* SCP-CN-757 will sometimes expand in size by 10 floors. At the same time, according to interviews, some rooms will change; some players recall that Floor 29 was a pharmacy rather than an antique shop. No explanation for the expansions has been discovered. \n* At times, some floors show signs of having been recently used. However, because floors other than Floor 38 (classroom) are limited to one player, it is suspected that a large number of other entities exist within SCP-CN-757. One suggestion is that these are left by the humanoid instances on other floors; however, no humanoid instances have been discovered that are not at their posts.\n* During exploration, multiple agents have been on the same floor at the same time; this occurred when two agents were on Floor 19 (internet cafe) at the same time, as evidenced by the time displayed on the computers. However, both agents did not see any other players on that floor. It is suspected that the interior of SCP-CN-757 is capable of self-duplication, such that two players can be on different copies of the same floor at the same time. In some cases, the entrance on the roof will display the text \"Too many players!\" and refuse entry. It is suspected that SCP-CN-757 is limited in its replication.\n* As prior exploration from Foundation agents has been prevented, it was determined that SCP-CN-757 or its operators have some knowledge of the Foundation and possess an unfriendly attitude towards it, not wanting to reveal too much information. In addition, due to the games present on Floors 19 (internet cafe) and 33 (arcade), it is evident that SCP-CN-757 is related in some way to Letters Entertainment.\n\nAs such, the Foundation is using the following strategy:\n* Employ a large volume of personnel in MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" and regularly explore SCP-CN-757. During exploration, conversation with employees is required, so as to gather further information about their identities and the operation of SCP-CN-757.\n* Continue to conduct interviews and amnesticization of individuals who have played SCP-CN-757. Although their memories of SCP-CN-757 are impaired by the effect of the anomaly, some fragmentary information can still be obtained.\n* Continue to analyze the mechanics and anomalous effects of SCP-CN-757. As tools originating within SCP-CN-757 cannot be taken out, it is best to begin with the building itself and the button on the roof.\n* The Foundation has sent an email to [[[SCP-CN-483|I&I Studio]]] to establish its connection with Letters Entertainment.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-A：Interview No.123\" hide=\"- 关闭记录\"]]\n**Note:** This is the 123rd interview conducted; it was conducted as a \"random sampling interview on the facilities at the amusement park\". The interviewee (No.123) was in a difficult situation due to losing his job, and claimed to have received \"extremely friendly treatment\" from the employees inside.\n\n> **Interviewee:** No.123 (Mr Li)\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr.Bread (as an employee of Special Creative Park Organization)\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Thank you for coming. I'm from the Special Creative Park Organization, and we do surveys and inspection on various amusement parks. According to our records, you've played this... \"Tiny World\", the 70-floor exploration one, right? How did you feel about it?\n> \n> **No.123:** Honestly, it's the most fun game I've played in ages. Even though my finances have been tough, I wanted to play it.\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** So you liked it? Could you tell me what specifically you played inside?\n> \n> **No.123:** Um... we had to find buttons on each floor. It was really fun!\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** And what was on each floor?\n> \n> **No.123:** Uh... oh, I forget. Why don't you go play it yourself?\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Can't you spend some time thinking about it? Even if you can't remember the whole thing, you still remember some of it, right?\n> \n> **No.123:** Ah... there was a, um, bank? And the employees were so nice, I told them I didn't have much money, and they gave me a whole bunch of coins for free! Then I went all over eating good food, and there was a really nice suite? Other than that... I can't think of anything.\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** I... I see. Do you think you had a better life inside or here?\n> \n> **No.123:** Uh... This kind of question is... well, the inside was nice, and the people inside wanted me to stay there. But I thought, my parents, my family were on the outside, I couldn't just leave them.\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Why did they ask you to stay?\n> \n> **No.123:** Um... they said \"it's fine if you want to stay, you won't lack money\". At the time, I wanted to stay, too. How did that happen?\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** I understand.\n> \n> **No.123:** Oh, did you people go in? It's really fun, you should give it a try!\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Um... we did send people in to inspect it, but we're specializing in inspection, so our focus is different from normal players. So we still need your input. Oh right, one more question. Did you recommend this to your friends too?\n> \n> **No.123:** Of course! It was so fun, I asked every one of my friends to give it a try. They said it was great too.\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Okay. Thank you for your input.\n\n**Note:** As a result of this interview, the Foundation discovered that the game intentionally encourages players to remain inside the anomaly; the whereabouts of players who remain in the game are unknown. It is suspected that some of the floors appear more often so as to encourage players dissatisfied with their lives to remain within the game through the encouragement of the employees within.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-B：Interview No.264\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Note:** This is the 264th interview conducted. The interviewee (No.264) had played SCP-CN-757 multiple times, and had acquired all trophies on one occasion. \n\n> **Interviewee:** No.264 (Mr Hu)\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr.Bread (as an employee of Special Creative Park Organization)\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Thank you for coming. I'm from the Special Creative Park Organization, and we do surveys and inspection on various amusement parks. According to our records, you've played this... \"Tiny World\", the 70-floor exploration one, right? How did you feel about it?\n> \n> **No.264:** It's great! I've played many different kinds of games, but I've never seen anything that combines so many elements so well. I played it quite a few times and this time I finally got all the trophies!\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** That's wonderful. Do you still remember what kinds of areas you visited whole playing?\n> \n> **No.26:** I don't quite understand why, but every time I come out of there I forget a bunch of stuff. Maybe I was too excited while playing. But thinking back I can recall quite a lot, which is how I figured out how to get all the trophies!\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** And do you recall any particularly impactful areas?\n> \n> **No.264:** Let me think... I spent  quite a lot of time at the library. As well as the rock climbing, I even went to get training, and I didn't realize it at the time but it also helped with the treadmill.\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Alright. Was there anything that happened after you got all the trophies? In other words, what made you want to complete all the trophies?\n> \n> **No.264:** That's a good question... After I got the last trophy, I just came out... maybe if you get all the trophies, you instantly win? No, I remember there was something else...\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Something else?\n> \n> **No.264:** There was something else, but I can't remember! I know I went somewhere after that... Right, they asked me if I wanted a job! There was someone who asked me that. And that person told me I had obtained all the trophies... Ah, where was that? And who was that?\n> \n> **Dr.Bread:** Oh, that's enough, don't stress yourself! Last question: did you recommend the game to your friends?\n> \n> **No.264:** Of course! Though, at first I really wanted to recommend it, and then that desire slowly faded... I guess I didn't want anyone completing it before I did? Either way, we're all crazy for games here!\n\n**Note:** Through this interview, it was discovered that once a player acquires all trophies, they will be asked if they want employment. If the player declines, their memories of this will be heavily affected. It was also understood that the memory-affecting phenomenon can be resisted. The Foundation has made guesses as to the means of acquiring all trophies; all members of MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" have been made familiar with the floors on which trophies can be obtained, and are currently attempting to acquire all trophies in a single playthrough.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-C：Reply from I&I Studio\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> **To:** Surprise Collection Production Inc.\n> **From:** Letters Entertainment, Innovation & Imagination Studio\n> **Subject:** Regarding the \"70 floors\" and relation to Letters Entertainment\n> \n> Dear Surprise Collection Production Inc.:\n> \n> Hello!\n> \n> We have a rough idea of the \"70 floors\" you asked about. We recall that there was previously a studio called V&V under Letters, which specialized in 3D modeling of people and environments, and had technology that could pull people's consciousness into a game. Their games were pretty popular... but about a year ago they left the company, probably due to a difference in opinions. They had quite the argument with HQ. The whole company heard about it. They said making games couldn't affect reality or something and ran off, taking a bunch of people from different studios. We don't know what they're doing now, actually, but what you said reminded us of them quite a lot. Sometimes they come to poach employees from us - HQ tolerated this for a while, but didn't want to punish them, and they're not under Letters any more, so...\n> \n> We don't have much more information, but we hear HQ is planning to set some hackers on them. We're planning to keep an eye on it. If you have any more questions, please contact us!\n> \n> Letters Entertainment, I&I Studio\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-D: Foundation exploration logs\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Note:** The following table shows notable observations and incidents recorded by MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" during exploration. All agents were provided with memory training and anti-memory-effect drugs so as to enable them to better remember their discoveries within SCP-CN-757. The primary objective of this stage is to collect information; as such, agents were instructed to decline all advances made by employees.\n||~ Exploration # ||~ Notes ||\n|| 10 || Employees on Floor 47 (bank) gave out a large amount of coins and asked if the player was in a poor financial situation in reality. ||\n|| 25 || Several abandoned models were discovered on Floor 30 (computer room), one of which was similar to the former Floor 29 pharmacy mentioned in interviews. ||\n|| 56 || When encountering the floating unknown entities on Floor 35 (haunted house), these entities did not proceed for unknown reasons. ||\n|| 78 || An employee appeared on Floor 30 and claimed to be able to improve the player's appearance through 3D modeling, asking if the player felt insecure about their appearance. ||\n|| 103 || An orange D-Class jumpsuit was discovered on Floor 59 (dormitory). ||\n|| 137 || An employee appeared on Floor 54 (theater) and asked if the player was dissatisfied with their living arrangements in reality, and hinted that housing could be created within the game. ||\n|| 159 || Met a player on Floor 38 (classroom) who claimed he had \"seen a recruitment ad looking for 3D artists and game designers, but did not realize it was this kind of place\". Further questioning showed that he was in a relatively stable position and was looking for a second job. He also claimed that he did not see any employees to direct him.||\n|| 178 || A rotting corpse was discovered on Floor 59 (dormitory), and an analysis was carried out using items obtained from Floor 39 (storeroom). Various other corpses were discovered on the next few explorations. ||\n|| 213 || The newly discovered ashes under the floor of Floor 51 (chapel) were analyzed and were discovered to match the corpses discovered in the previous few explorations.||\n|| 284 || A restaurant employee on Floor 64 (mall) stated that she had \"nearly been sentenced to death, and had to do some experiments, but was now in a better place.\" She did not appear on further explorations. ||\n|| 340 || A mannequin of unknown material was discovered on Floor 59 (dormitory), different from the mannequin on Floor 14 (retail department), and more realistic, apparently possessing vital signs. ||\n|| 397 || The recruitment ads on Floor 14 (retail department) disappeared, and a new employee was present. This employee's appearance matched the mannequin previously present. ||\n|| 456 || Two employees drinking alcohol were discovered on Floor 19 (izakaya). Upon seeing the player, they expressed panic, took out a button, and pressed it, sending them to another floor. This button appeared to possess multiple switches. ||\n|| 468 || A model of an animal was discovered on Floor 59 (dormitory). ||\n\nAs such, the Foundation has produced the following theories:\n\n* SCP-CN-757's managers are recruiting by providing players with what they lack or desire in real life to encourage them to sign on. The only requirement of these employees is that they live entirely within SCP-CN-757, and may not interact with the real world.\n* Upon being hired, they will use 3D modeled bodies [[footnote]]These bodies can be made according to the subject's wishes and do not have to be human.[[/footnote]], and their true bodies are placed under the floor of Floor 51 (chapel). As such, it is theorized that Floor 36 (graveyard) holds the bodies of players who have died during the game, and the numbers on their graves represent the floors on which they died. These two groups of people are affected by an antimeme, rendering information relating to them unreachable.\n* Employees have to follow certain rules, such as not interacting with players outside of work or leaking personal information; employees who break these rules are punished severely, possibly by death.\n* All floors are 3D modeled, and are suspected to have been modified multiple times.\n* The currency system is not important within SCP-CN-757.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-E: Exploration Log 587\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Note:** After the 500th exploration, the Foundation changed its objective, and instructed agents to seek to \"become employed\" within SCP-CN-757. During this exploration, the agent accepted a request from an employee on Floor 47 (bank). The employee produced a contract and instructed the agent to sign. The agent read through the contract carefully, leading the employee to hesitate and take back the contract, claiming that \"perhaps you are not suitable for this work\". According to the agent, the main points of the contract were:\n* Role can be chosen at will, e.g. store employee, market vendor; this extended to roles such as \"animal\" and \"ghost\". \n* After selecting a role, it is possible to request for a model to use; the modeling department additionally accepts requests.\n* It is required to transfer one's consciousness to the model. While getting used to the model, the original body can be placed on Floor 59 (dormitory) and switched back and forth.\n* All other instances in the real world will \"selectively forget\" about employees.\n* The food and entertainment facilities in SCP-CN-757 can be freely used as long as the employee is not discovered by a player. When a player is near, a button can be used to transfer the employee to a copy of the floor. If discovered, the employee will lose their model rights.\n* A minimum quota of working hours is required daily; if not met, the employee will lose their model rights.\n* No information is to be leaked to players about the employee or the company; if information is leaked, the employee will lose their model rights.\nOf these, a large part of the contract discussed the benefits of joining SCP-CN-757.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum CN-757-F：Exploration Log 679\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Note:** During this exploration, Agent Asteria successfully acquired all trophies and confirmed that the prize for collecting all trophies was entering Floor 69, the offices of the management of SCP-CN-757, formerly V&V Studio. The following is roughly the conversation between Agent Asteria and an employee on Floor 69.\n\n> **Employee:** Welcome, Ms Gu! You've collected all the trophies. It's been a while since I've seen anyone who did this well. You surely have a passion for games.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** You're so kind. But I have really done quite a lot of research too.\n> \n> **Employee:** Well, we here share your love for games. We have a special reward for players who complete all the trophies - that is, to see our offices, where we make games! Please, follow me.\n> \n> //Agent Asteria follows the employee around Floor 69. The interior consists of various departments, such as a game design team, a modeling team, a training team, a human resources team, an advertising team, and a monitoring team. The game design team is responsible for the direction of the game and design of individual floors; the modeling team is responsible for the creation of models for employees and levels; the training team is responsible for training new employees; the advertising team is responsible for creating advertisements for SCP-CN-757, and the monitoring team facilitates the transportation process and monitors each floor. The employee does not showcase the human resources team. During this period, the employee attempts to encourage Agent Asteria to join the development team.//\n> \n> **Employee:** We won't keep this from you - we're currently devising a few new systems, so that you won't have to worry about food or clothes. You've noticed, right? We don't run out of food to serve; you can order whatever at the restaurant, and the bank employees will give out money sometimes. Honestly, we don't need money here - we don't worry about these kinds of things. We also have entertainment, and if you're missing anything, you can ask for it from the modeling team. \n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Huh... and what would I do here? I've never been to this floor.\n> \n> **Employee:** You know already - we want you to join us on our journey of creating a tiny new world together.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** This... hearing about it, it really sounds great, but if you want me to decide now... Now that I think about it, how do the other employees get hired?\n> \n> **Employee:** That's different, naturally. The employees on other floors, if the employment team feels they can be employed, they take them in directly. What we're asking you to do is join our //planning// team.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Wait, according to what you said just now, I can't go back to the real world if I join you?\n> \n> **Employee:** This kind of question, we're still debating about. It might be possible, but it might not.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** If that's the case... can you let me go back and think about it?\n> \n> **Employee:** Um... I'm sorry, but this kind of thing is a secret, so we can't let you go unless we can be sure you won't tell anyone... in other words, you should make your decision now.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** You... you won't let people have that kind of time... how do you get anyone to join, then? \n> \n> **Employee:** We have quite a few. People tend to build up grievances with the real world. And our work is pretty good - we have great benefits and no overtime, isn't that better than the real world?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Ah... I don't know. I'll have to turn you down.\n> \n> **Employee:** In that case, I wish you all the best. To be honest, I really didn't want to see someone like you go... Goodbye.\n\nFollowing this, Agent Asteria was sent to the roof.\n\n**Note:** According to Agent Asteria, the parting remark \"I really didn't want to see someone like you go\" made her feel \"particularly uncomfortable, as if they were plotting something\". It is suggested to change the direction of SCP-CN-757 exploration.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident CN-757-G (Requires Level 3 clearance)\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n**Note:** Following Exploration 857, SCP-CN-757 grew from 70 to 80 floors. At the same time, the residential tower was combined with another nearby residential tower, with the interiors of both towers inaccessible. At the same time, a large number of members of MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" began to experience the same short game sessions as other Foundation agents, being sent out of the game after only a few floors. It is theorized that information relating to MTF-庚午-18 \"Untitled\" was leaked for unknown reasons.\n\nAt the same time, there was a breakthrough in analysis of the spatial anomaly; agents entering SCP-CN-757 can send information to Foundation operatives in the real world using specialized equipment on certain channels. As this could lead to further information being obtained, it was decided to send an agent to the higher-level employees to interact. The following is the recording of this operation.\n\n> <Begin recording. Agent Asteria is located on Floor 39 (storeroom).>\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Hey, 69th floor, are you listening? I didn't think I'd still remember you. I want to talk, please send me up!\n> \n> //Agent Asteria presses the button, and is sent to the 69th floor.//\n> \n> **Employee:** Oh, hello, Ms Gu. We meet again. I wouldn't have thought you'd remember... hm, you've become part of the Foundation?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Evidently. I see you're aware of the Foundation?\n> \n> **Employee:** Of course. Our rivals. We've heard all about your secret task force by now.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** If I may ask, where did you hear of that?\n> \n> **Employee:** You shouldn't look down on us. Just as you've been recording us, we've been recording you. We slip up sometimes, yes, but don't forget that you do too.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** You haven't answered my question. Whatever, if things are like this, there's no point asking. Let's get to the point. I want you to stop expanding.\n> \n> **Employee:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** According to our observations, you've grown from 50 floors to 80. Though you possess spatial compression technology, you still need space, so you switched to another building. If you go on like this, sooner or later you'll have taken over the whole city. We hope you'll know when to stop, so that we won't have to interfere later.\n> \n> **Employee:** Huh... that's too bad, we can't possibly stop now. You know Letters Entertainment's tagline - Games Change Lives? We lost hope in changing lives with video games, so we made this place. Our goal is to create a new world, a real game world. How can we stop here?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** So that's why you hire that way...\n> \n> **Employee:** Exactly. We hope people can escape from the suffering they face in reality and join our ranks.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** If reality is suffering, is this pleasure?\n> \n> **Employee:** That's natural, this place has a sort of attraction to it. If you want good food, good fun, and good looks... we can provide it. The work is simple, you can even become a cat or a ghost. Who wouldn't want it?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** That's a childish way of looking at things. You really think people will be satisfied by that? They will only want more. Besides the way you treat people on the lower floors... what about your modelers? If they don't want to work any more, what will you do?\n> \n> **Employee:** We'll make them want to work.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Haha... And I thought you wanted to create an utopia. In the end, you're still dictators.\n> \n> **Employee:** Don't put it that way... We don't want to deviate from our original intention. \n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** That I have no business in. But, you have no way of really escaping from reality. Your cinema, your games, your books, all rely on reality. You don't have enough people to make a whole new world. And what's stranger - you want a world with no money, but you still charge an entrance fee. I still don't understand, but I know one thing, you still rely on the real world. Whether it's culture, energy, or people, you have no way to create an independent new world. You're nothing but parasites using your technology to leech off the real world!\n> \n> **Employee:** You hit it right on the point. That's why we wanted you to join us. But do you think we never thought of this? People will slowly come over on their own.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** That's assuming your entrance still works.\n> \n> **Employee:** Don't forget that this is a spatial anomaly. Do you think there's only one entrance? You know there's more than one of each room, but haven't figured out there's more than one entrance?\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Are you deliberately letting us know?\n> \n> **Employee:** You're overthinking things. Either way, our discussion has fallen apart. Both of us have no intention of letting the other go. How regrettable.\n> \n> **Agent Asteria:** Agreed. In that case, you should wait.\n> \n> **Employee:** Wait for what? War? In that case, you should prepare well... either way, you coming to this level is dependent on our decision to transport you here.\n> @@@@\n> **Agent Asteria:** You're right. But if it really comes to war, you have no way of matching our firepower. We're considered one of the nicer organizations, too... But some groups aren't. If it does come to war, you're better off focusing on them. And this time, your old friends at Letters Entertainment might pay you a visit.\n> \n> **Employee:** Alright, alright, there's no point going further. Let's stop here. This is the last time your people will be able to peacefully leave this world.\n> \n>  **Agent Asteria:** Oh, you don't want to \"make\" me want to join you any more?\n> \n> **Employee:** Ha ha.\n> \n> <Agent Asteria is returned to the roof. End recording.>\n\n**Conclusion:** It has been confirmed that SCP-CN-757's employees (previously V&V Studio) are hostile to the Foundation and all units entering are to take precautions. In order to prevent further losses, all exploration of the interior has been halted. As it has been suggested during the interaction that agents who have entered SCP-CN-757 may have undergone some degree of memory or thought alteration, all such agents are currently undergoing inspection. The Foundation has not discovered any similar anomalous spaces; it is unknown what if any part of the conversation is factual, and a large-scale search is underway to determine the location of the mentioned other entrances. At the same time, the Foundation and the Global Occult Coalition are discussing sharing information and strategies to minimize damage inflicted upon the real world.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-CN-756|SCP-CN-756]]] | SCP-CN-757 | [[[SCP-CN-758]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
