Lest I cleave,\nAs you will be one to break.\nVermin! All for me to bout.\n\nThe great Lord Rubedo descended.\nHe slithered the floors gleefully and roared\nAs he clung and bound me in his cage.\nDestroyed what little was left of my soul.\nAnd I burned, burned! Within me rage.\nGashed him with his treasured jolly sword\nTo flee all the way to Alagaddaâ€™s end.\n\nNow ahead, I see a Scarlet King.\nHis horns shape a violent red crown.\nHe holds out his jagged right hand,\nAnd cuts it, giving me new life.\n[[span style=\"color:red\"]] //Bring justice upon the damned.//[[/span]]\nHe kneels, wrapping around me his gown.\nCried, I did. Soon, I shall sing.\n\nOur gift to you, these lovely flames.\nO, your screams are like a song!\nJust before we broke your foul lords,\nThe Ambassador cast us out.\nIn this place, there were great hoards.\nThe fools thought themselves as strong,\nYet it is their blood that rains.\n\nTheir warm blood drops me to weep.\nFather holds me like an infant.\nIn my ear, he hums a tune:\n[[span style=\"color:red\"]] //Rest now, my darling child.//[[/span]]\nHe whispers, under the moon.\nSoon, my cries go distant\nAnd I drift into a soft sleep.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
