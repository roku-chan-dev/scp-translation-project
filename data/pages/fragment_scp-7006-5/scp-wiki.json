Before the leak could be repaired, the excited acid ate through the tank floor, resulting in the destruction of seven SCP objects, and three personnel deaths. To ameliorate this, the //Dragon's Lair// encounter was appended to the Containment module.\n\nThe implementation of the character of //Chroma// was first posed by Dr. Judith Glass, who had observed a sharp decrease in the mental wellbeing of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-105 |SCP-105]]]. In the proceeding year, missions to which SCP-105 had been assigned were found to succeed approximately 26% more frequently.\n\nIn 2018, a copy of the Ritual-7006-Warden handbook found in an alternate universe was obtained by [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2117|SCP-2117]]]-[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2085|B instances]]], who made unauthorized edits to it, in the form of the //Shrine of the Black Rabbit// encounter. They also performed an unsanctioned version of Ritual-7006-Warden.  Due to the fact that this performance correlated with increased stabilization of SCP-2117's non-euclidean geometry, it has been allowed to remain as part of the Ritual.\n\nIn 2002, only a month following a critical 7006-Warden failure (attributed to poor performance of the Containment module[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]In which inexperienced members of personnel attempted to save //Abigail//; the Warden abridged the session with the \"Rockslide Maneuver\", instantly killing all Avatars.[[/span]]), a catastrophic esoteric materials breach resulted in the complete shutdown of Site-43's Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-D, and the generation of a since-unbroken [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5243 |time loop]]].\n\nIt is not known when Room Fifteen was added to the Containment module. The reasons for its existence are also unknown.
