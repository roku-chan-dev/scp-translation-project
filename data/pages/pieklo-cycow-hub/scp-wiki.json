It just so happens that this barrier is the thinnest in the inconspicuous Cyców gmina. Due to the anomalies occurring there, the Foundation quickly secures the area of the entire commune, later naming it Nx-79 \"Gmina Cyców\", completely cutting it off from the rest of the civilization. Site PL-79 is built to oversee the entire area of the Nexus and to investigate anomalies related to the demonic layer of reality. It turns out, however, that the Foundation is not the only organization that knows about its existence. In the forest located in the village of Cyców, there are armaments plants belonging to Hunter Industries, as well as their headquarters. Where the Foundation deals with the study of demonic entities, these deal with using them for the development of technology and the production of weapons. They build their laboratories and factories in both our and demonic layer.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Characters, places, groups of interest and terminology]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Postacie\n----\n* **Director Antoni Grzmichuj** -- Director of Site PL-79 from 2003 to 2010. He was relegated to the job in postal room in the Legal Department, the reason for the change of position was the contract signed by him, unfavorable for the Foundation, with Hunter Industries. Proud of his position as director, he wants to regain it and does not allow himself to think that he is simply incompetent.\n* **Brygida Wiśniewska** -- Foundation agent and Inquisitor at Site PL-79. Thanks to her, Antoni Grzmichuj is no longer the director of the Site. Firm, self-confident and not mincing words.\n* **Director Kamil Szczur** -- Director of Site PL-79 after Grzmichuj. A young, confident man who wants to prove his worth. He tries to fix the errors of his predecessor and to avoid blockages imposed by the contract with Hunter Industries.\n* **Dr. Konstantyn Jackowski** -- Head of the Demonic Department, seemingly incompetent, too loose and unfit for his position. In fact, however, he has the most knowledge in the Foundation about demonic beings and the demonic layer of reality itself. Working for the Foundation for many years, a thaumaturge, however, is not as deeply involved in this field as in demonology. Whiskey lover.\n* **Adam Hunter** -- One of the two owners of Hunter Industries. Mainly dealing with the company's contacts with external persons. A calm and professional white-haired man dressed in white. He has psychic powers to make significant suggestions to the other person through eye contact.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Locations\n----\n* **The demonic layer of reality** -- A layer of reality separated by a barrier that is a demonic reflection of ours. Inhabited by demonic beings, both those more intelligent, creating their own civilization, and mindless monsters. A characteristic feature of its landscape are white, slightly bloody fungal structures.\n* **Nx-79 \"Gmina Cyców\"** -- The whole area of the Cyców commune is classified as Nx-79 \"Gmina Cyców\" of Dunwich class. Nx-79 is where the barrier separating our reality layer from the demonic reality layer is at its thinnest. People who commit suicide in the area of Nx-79 appear in the same state as at the time of death in the Cyców commune, but in the demonic layer of reality, which is much more dangerous than ours due to the presence of numerous demonic entities.\n* **Site PL-79** -- The Foundation Site that was built in Cyców, its task is securing anomalies from the entire area of Nx-79 and those related to the demonic layer. It is also the headquarters of the Demon Department.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Groups of Interest\n----\n* **[[[hunter-industries-hub|Hunter Industries]]]** -- The company was founded by siblings Amanda and Adam Hunter. The headquarters of Hunter Industries is located in Cyców. The company itself is engaged in the research and production of weapons and technology related to demonic beings and the demonic layer of reality. They have their laboratories and factories, both on our reality and demonic layer.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Terminology\n----\n* **EZAW energy** -- Anomalous energy obtained from demonic entities. Used in technologies and weapons from Hunter Industries.\n* **Demonic entity** -- A name for beings from the demonic layer of reality. They are classified with the letters from A to E, this classification is used by both the Foundation and Hunter Industries. The higher the class of demonic being, the stronger its powers and the higher its intelligence. Class E demonic entities are extremely weak and mindless. Class D beings can be likened to animals. Threatening and strong, but acting on instincts. Class C entities are usually able to speak or communicate in other ways, not always stronger than Class D entities, but usually smarter. Class B demonic entities are higher demons, exercising sovereignty over certain parts of the demonic layer of reality. There is one known class A demonic entity; data about him is confidential.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab The canonicity of other canons with this canon]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Canons canonical to this canon\n----\n* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/przyczajone-leczenie-hub Lurking Treatment]** -- Due to the extremely loose structure of the Lurking Treatment, there are no problems with mutual canonicity.\n* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/chwasty-hub Weeds]** -- Due to the extremely loose structure of the Weeds, there are no problems with mutual canonicity.\n* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/symonia-hub Symony]** -- With a canon structure heavily to be interpreted, the events of Simony can be canonical here as well.\n* **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/from-120-s-archives-hub From 120's Archives], [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/no-return-hub No Return] and the rest of Metafoundation** --There may be references to the canons from Metafoundation, events are canonical as long as they do not conflict directly with the articles from Cyców's Hell.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n+++* Canons not canonical to this canon\n----\n\n* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/zwarcie-hub Clash]** -- Too many things don't fit.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Timeline]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\n**2003** -- Antoni Grzmichuj becomes a director of Site PL-79.\n**2010** -- SCP-PL-289 appears in Site PL-79 territory.\n**2011** -- Director Antoni Grzmichuj is demoted, Kamil Szczur becomes the new director of the Site. \n**2012** -- The Chaos Insurgency begins to open the portal to the demonic layer of reality in Łódź.\n**2013** -- By accident, demonic app created by Hunter Industries is released to public.\n**2014** -- Problems with demonic entities are delaying the shipment of weapons from Hunter Industries to A.R.G.U.S. Inc.\n**2015** -- A civilian expedition to Antarctica disappears mysteriously.\n**2017** -- In the Site PL-48 which is under construction, security breaches occur, which significantly delay the construction.\n**march 2019** -- A mysterious ritual in the village of Cyców causes a significant change in the behavior of SCP-PL-139 at Site PL-48.\n**june 2019** -- A class C demonic entity, victim of a thaumaturgic ritual is contained in Site PL-49.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab So you wanna write something here?]]\n[[div class=\"log-header\"]]\nCyców's Hell is a canon about demons, cutting off the area of the entire commune from civilization, a company using demonic beings for its own purposes and a Foundation trying to comprehend all of it.
