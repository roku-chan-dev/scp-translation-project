Its testing chamber is fitted with 4 Scranton Reality Anchors (SRAs). SCP-5296 is to be monitored by at least 3 members of staff who perceive its existence.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5296 appears to be a semi-physical entity whose existence is permeable and subject to factors that are as of yet undetermined. The precise nature of SCP-5296 is unknown. Even amongst those who perceive it to exist, there is little agreement on any of SCP-5296's features, presenting it as a sizeable threat to consensus reality.\n\nThese inconsistencies are largely universal, applying even to a single individual's continuous perception of SCP-5296. Common points of disagreement in decreasing order of controversy[[footnote]] This is not to say that the lower down items on the list are more agreed upon, merely that they are less often argued about. [[/footnote]] include:\n* Whether or not SCP-5296 exists\n* Whether or not SCP-5296 is humanoid\n* Whether or not SCP-5296 can communicate\n* Whether or not SCP-5296 is memetic or reality-warping\n\nDue to its ambiguous nature, SCP-5296 has caused much conflict within the Foundation over its properties. It is currently unknown if this is an intended effect or not.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5296 was seized by MTF-Phoenix-1 (\"Mind Over Matter\") on 24/06/2027. It was discovered during a Foundation raid to recover SCP-████ from [REDACTED] after a containment breach. It was found in a hidden room which was marked on an assailant's map of the complex. On entering the room, MTF-Phoenix-1 found a note describing SCP-5296. The note was subsequently deemed irrecoverable after a skirmish with remaining assailants. MTF-Phoenix-1 did not recall the contents of the note in sufficient detail to assist in initial documentation. SCP-5296 and SCP-████ were retrieved and brought to Site-11 without further incident.\n\nOf note, members of MTF-Phoenix-1 claimed not to have noticed SCP-5296 until after having read the note about it.\n\n**Addendum-5296-A**\nAlthough SCP-5296 has, as of yet, proved easy to contain, it has caused significant disruption within the Foundation, detailed below:\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nDate\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\nEvents regarding SCP-5296\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n26/06/2027\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nOn Junior Researcher Smith's assignment to SCP-5296, he made several complaints about it being “an empty room”. He also made several appeals to Site Command to delete the files regarding SCP-5296 and to cease \"wasting our time on non-entities.\" Due to his misconduct, he was later referred to the disciplinary committee.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n04/07/2027\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nSenior Researcher Aster experienced minimal difficulties in his preliminary research. However, video records of his initial tests were lost upon a routine scan of the Foundation database, wherein I.T staff deleted them, commenting “Assumed unnecessary equipment test: D-Class was standing in an empty room.”\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n26/07/2027\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nResearch continued from here; however, it was slightly impeded by pressure to complete investigations quickly. As a result of this and a general effort by the Foundation to cut down on use of resources, all projects relating to SCP-5296 were halted until an appeal by Aster was approved.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n02/08/2027\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nA formal inquiry into SCP-5296 was launched, leading to the near-deletion of the SCP-5296 file by Site Command in a 9-1 vote on the matter. After further investigation, no consensus was reached on SCP-5296 and its file remained pending deletion. They settled that research should proceed as planned.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\n10/08/2027\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nIn accordance with the disruption it had caused, SCP-5296 was raised as an issue to the O5-Council, who also experienced difficulties in coming to any agreement regarding SCP-5296. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\nFollowing the O5-Council meeting on 10/08/2027, research into SCP-5296 is now considered a top priority. SCP-5296 has been provisionally classed as Keter.\n\n**Addendum-5296-B**\n> Further review of our files regarding SCP-5296 suggests its nature may be vastly different to our initial assessments. SCP-5296 may very well be a //figment// of our imaginations.\n> \n> - Senior Researcher Aster\n\nFollowing review of the above proposal, further testing of SCP-5296 has been approved to determine the likelihood of this theory.\n\n**Test Log 5296-01**\n> This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 09/09/2027.\n> \n> **Testing Procedure:**\n> This test consisted of two executions with minor alterations:\n> \n> //Standard Procedure://\n> A D-Class will enter SCP-5296's testing chamber and follow the instructions of Senior Researcher Aster, who will be remotely observing the test.\n> \n> The first execution was standard, but the D-Class was given a briefing prior to the test and was given a file describing SCP-5296[[footnote]] This file was the improvised template that was pending the results of these tests. [[/footnote]].\n> \n> The second execution was identical to the first, excluding the lack of a briefing.\n> \n> **Results:**\n> D-1412, who had received the briefing, perceived SCP-5296 and was generally consistent with previous observations regarding SCP-5296 and the lack of consensus around its properties.\n> \n> D-1583, who went in blind, was unable to perceive SCP-5296, complaining that there was nothing in the room to begin with.\n> \n> **Observations:**\n> It would appear that the proposed theory may be correct, although the data set is insufficient to draw any conclusions. Further testing involving on-site staff is pending approval.\n\n**Test Log 5296-02**\n> This test was overseen by Senior Researcher Aster on 11/09/2027.\n> \n> **Testing Procedure:**\n> This was effectively a large-scale version of the previous test. Site staff was divided into two groups, one that was briefed beforehand whilst the other was not. They then each attempted to perceive SCP-5296.\n> \n> **Results:**\n> Everyone in the group that went in with no prior knowledge failed to perceive SCP-5296, whilst everyone in the other group was able to perceive SCP-5296. The results after testing over 200 on-site personnel were consistent with the proposed theory, however also raise another possibility. \n> \n> **Observations:**\n> These results are conclusive. They leave only two possibilities:\n> # SCP-5296 is indeed a figment of the observer's imagination.\n> # SCP-5296 is somehow aware of our belief in it and its permeable existence responds in kind.\n> \n> SCP-5296 will hereafter be reclassified as Safe, since the discord it initially caused has run its course and its properties are now beginning to be understood.\n\n**Addendum 5296-C**\nAs recent test results have raised concerns that SCP-5296 may be reliant on human belief in order to exist, it has been raised as an issue to the Ethics Committee. This is due to be discussed on 25/09/2027 during a meeting of the Ethics Committee.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:left; width: 45%\"]]\n\n{{Page revision from 18/09/2027}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5296/offset/1 Current Iteration]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
