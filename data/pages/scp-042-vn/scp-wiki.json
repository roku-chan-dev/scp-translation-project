You better buy me back. If not, I'll tell Keiko about this.\n\n\n##black|**Hanma Takeshi**##: Ok ok I‚Äôm doing it, anything but that.\n\n\n//[Takeshi puts his hand into his pocket, grabbing every last penny to pay for the coffee.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: 'cuz you have been a good boy, I‚Äôm gonna show you something.

SCP-042-VN dresses ceremony costume, with other miko standing around it and assisting in the event.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: And now I'll be interviewing Mr. Tanaka Hiroshi, who has played a major role in taking care of the shrine with his daughters for many years. //[points the microphone towards Mr. Tanaka]// Can you explain more about your work?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: //[bows head]// Greeting everyone. My name is Tanaka Hiroshi, currently responsible for governing Hokkaid≈ç Shrine. I‚Äôm very pleased to work with the channel.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: So, shrine manager, can you introduce the shrine and miko? Who are these ‚Äúpretty cherry blossoms‚Äù, and especially about the car that‚Äôs attracting tourists and local visitors' attention?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Well,[[footnote]]By Japanese.[[/footnote]] I believe that anyone can look up basic information online. Our shrine was constructed recently, starting from my grandfather until me, and then will be taken over by future generations. Some relatives also support us, but mainly annual offerings and ceremonies will be carried out by the Tanaka family and miko.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Right,[[footnote]]By Japanese.[[/footnote]] it can be argued that miko have made the shrine extremely popular on social media. Can you go into more detail about this?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Well, to begin with, the main miko taking care of the shrine are my eldest daughter Tanaka Keiko //[raises his hand towards the long-haired miko assisting SCP-042-VN]//, my middle daughter Hanami Tanaka //[gestures towards the miko next to him]//, Ito Yuka //[approaches the miko who was witnessing the event and draws her attention. She also turns around to greet.]//, who is responsible for beautiful items that tourists can buy at souvenir stand. Yumi Watanabe //[camera records a dark-skinned, short-haired miko standing in the middle of tourists and SCP-042-VN]// is my niece, and recently the appearance of our new representative ‚Äì Toyo Tanaka //[points towards SCP-042-VN performing the ceremony]//, my youngest daughter.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Yes, from what I see, it seems that Ms. Keiko is playing a key role in taking care of the shrine. If so, will this role be passed on to anyone when she becomes an adult? And what if the miko have other wishes?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Miko‚Äôs duty has always been passed down in the Tanaka family. Fortunately, my beloved daughters always enjoy working with this old grumpy father. But if they want to do something else, I'll happily agree. Birds have to leave their nest, right?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Currently, Keiko is the Head Miko. In case she and Yuka go to college or move to another city, Toyo will take over the job for her two older sisters.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Well, perhaps Ms. Toyo is the perfect choice for a shrine manager in the future, and she will be able to handle this responsibility for a very long time, right? So, can the current shrine manager tell us what fate brought Ms. Toyo into the perfect position for this duty?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Well, to be honest, it all started very randomly. Please give me a few minutes.\n\n\n//[Mr. Hiroshi takes out a notebook from the cupboard and holds it towards the camera. He then turns to random pages. Inside are entries of many girls with dates from the past, as well as pictures of high school girls and various miko. Mr. Hiroshi pauses in front of a photograph of SCP-042-VN ‚Äúbeing blessed‚Äù at the gate.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: This is?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Yes, since the day the Hokkaid≈ç Shrine was constructed, every member's photo has been kept in the notebook I'm holding.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Wow, it looks so thick.\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=10\n|speed=120\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=18.75rem\n|url=http://khoaigarret.wikidot.com/local--files/kirq-pic/miko_toyo.jpg\n|alt=alt|alt-text=\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Photo taken from the notebook.\n]]\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Yes, and this is a photo of the first time I met her, two years ago, when I was leading a local car blessing ceremony.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Oh, so you're not Toyo's biological father?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Yeah, how could humans birth cars? Japan isn't yet this miraculous.\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Back on topic, Toyo was alone. I didn't think much at that moment, as I assumed a visitor's automobile was parked waiting for their turn to pray.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Nobody showed up to pick up the car?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: She was still there, even after the next few nights.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: So it turns out that the shrine grounds don't really charge parking fees? Why didn‚Äôt you check out that car?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: I didn't know that she was alive at that time. It was a cold winter with heavy snow, so I just put a thick tarp over her body to cover the snow and went back to my room. So when the snow melted, someone would come pick her up.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: That's very thoughtful.\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: The next morning, the tarp was carefully folded in front of my room door. And Toyo was hiding behind the stone tablet.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: So what was your first reaction?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: At first, I thought it was someone pranking us. You know, some kids were on winter break, so they had free time to do things like that.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Oh right, so when did you realize that Miss Toyo was conscious?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: As I came closer, she retreated deep into the bushes, but no one was in the cockpit, which made me feel very suspicious.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: So you adopted Miss Toyo from that moment?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: There were some initial discussions too, we had to talk and clarify things. I also needed custody from her previous owner as well. But after few months when no one came to claim her, she gradually became a part of my family. She called me father,  my daughter sister, and considered this place as her home. Then she became an integral part of the shrine like now.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Forgive me if this question is too personal, but some of my viewers asked if an automobile is suitable enough to become a miko?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: This shrine always accepts all lives if they want to follow Shinto. Moreover, Toyo is the most sincere in this work, and maybe she gained power and mind from Shinto blessings. Everyone here could see her sincerity.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Yes, that is indeed true. //[speaks into the camera]// Y‚Äôall can look where Mr. Hiroshi is pointing!\n\n\n//[Mr. Hiroshi raises his hand towards SCP-042-VN, the camera also gradually moves in the direction of his hand. Behind the scenes, SCP-042-VN is having sake poured into the fuel tank through the fuel line. A big plastic basin is then placed just beneath the car's exhaust pipe, releasing a bright yellow liquid that resembles beer. People in line then use a small cup to scoop up some liquid to drink. White foam is clearly visible floating in a separate layer on the liquid's surface. Vincent and Mr. Hiroshi make their way to the \"kuchikamizake\"[[footnote]]Translator‚Äôs note: A type of sake, rice-based brewed alcohol, usually produced by miko in a blessing ceremony.[[/footnote]] table.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Wow, very strong smell, is it real beer?\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Well, to be more specific, it's a blessed beer-wine hybrid that brings energy and good fortune to the drinker.\n\n\n//[The camera records many residents and tourists drinking and chatting happily together.]//\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: So do you want to try some?\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Can I?\n\n\n**Note:** After a post-event investigation, Foundation recorded thirty cases of stomach ache which needed to be transferred to the central hospital, twelve cases of driving safety violations, and five cases of imprisonment for fighting while intoxicated.  All of these individuals did not blame or mention SCP-042-VN.

Did you also stalk them?\n\n\n##black|**Hanma Takeshi**##: No no, not like that.

Help is on the way. I‚Äôll hold this thing till then.\n\n\n**Entity:** YOU DISGRACEFUL PEASANTS DARE WHISPERING IN FRONT OF MY PRESENCE. PREPARE TO BE PUNISHED!\n\n\n//[The entity emits a roar that shakes the ground heavily and creates dozens-metres-tall waves. Smoke pillars break through the ocean surface and fill the sky.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: //[curls down as he steps forward]// Will mister‚Äî your grace, yes mister your grace spare us, and allow us, uhm, to leave this place in peace, pretty please?\n\n\n**Entity:** HAH, YOU REALLY THINK YOU CAN LEAVE AFTER DISRESPECT A MIGHTY KING LIKE THIS? LETTING YOU RATS GO IS NOT MY INTENTION FROM THE START ANYWAY.\n\n\n//[The entity flicks his head backward resembling the motion of swinging an arm. A wave, measuring five meters in height and extending over ten meters in length, manifests, crashing onto the shore and propelling SCP-042-VN into the wall mound behind her. The incident blocks SCP-042-VN‚Äôs engine and stops her from turning on the headlights. Hiroshi, who is carrying the last miko out of the area, also almost falls from the shockwave but quickly recovers and leaves.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Miss Miko //[hurries to SCP-042-VN while facing the malicious entity and pressing his back against the wall]//! Are you alright, uhm, Miko Toyo-san?\n\n\n//[SCP-042-VN let out a weak engine sound, the headlights flicker but don't turn on completely. SCP-042-VN slightly moves as her wheels roll in the sand.]//\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: Mister, mister customer, can you please take the wheel. I need your help to kickstart my engine. I can draw out all of my hidden power, but I need a soul of justice after the wheel that synchronizes with me.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: I‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure if I can do that.\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: I‚Äôve observed you since you started your stay at the shrine. Although you‚Äôre kind of weird at times, I do believe your heart is still in the good.\n\n\n**Entity:** YOU DARE IGNORE YOUR KING AGAIN, YOU MAGGOTS. GO TO HELL WHERE THOSE ≈åE MOUNT IDIOTS ARE!\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: Please hurry, mister customer! I can‚Äôt take it any longer!\n\n\n**Entity:** YOU ARE JUST AS WEAK AS EVER. TIME TO PURGE ALL YOU MAGGOTS.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: //[scream]// Come out and fight me one on one if you‚Äôre so good, playing deity behind your smoke. Or maybe you are too ugly you have to hide from other‚Äôs gaze!\n\n\n**Entity:** HMPH, YOU INSUBORDINATE. FEAR YOUR ALMIGHTY KING!\n\n\n//[The entity slowly moves throught the smoke. Camera catches a Y-class entity resembling an Oni in Japanese folklore. The entity possesses a bodiless head floating in mid-air with an invisible sixty-meter-high figure, which could be viewed through lens. A pair of brightly glowing horns could be seen on the entity‚Äôs head.//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Holy‚Äì\n\n\n**Entity:** NOW, ARE YOU STILL LOOKING FOR A FIGHT WITH THE ALMIGHTY?\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: //[suddenly crouch down]// This‚Ä¶ this slowly servant bows before master.\n\n\n**Entity:** SMART MOVE, PEASANT!\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: What‚Ä¶ What can this‚Ä¶ this servant do for you now‚Ä¶ your grace?\n\n\n**Entity:** BRING ME THE VIRGINS YOUR SOLDIER JUST BROUGHT AWAY.

Will... will your grace get closer and take the tribute?\n\n\n**Entity:** GOOD!\n\n\n//[The camera constantly shakes each time the entity comes a little closer. Suddenly, Vincent throws a paper talisman seemingly taken from SCP-042-VN driver‚Äôs seat.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Behold, SUPER ULTRA POWERFUL FIREBALL DESTROY MY ENEMY!!!\n\n\n//[The paper talisman floats forward, then slowly lands on the ground. Nothing happens.]//\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: The talisman only works with us mister customers!\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: WHY DIDN‚ÄôT YOU TELL ME?\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: YOU DIDN‚ÄôT ASKED?\n\n\n**Entity:** YOU DARE TRY TO FOOL ME YOU DAMN MORTAL. THEN THIS PLACE SHALL MARK YOUR GRAVE!\n\n\n//[The entity roars and rushes toward Vincent, bringing a tsunami to the shore as Vincent head for SCP-042-VN.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Fuck me!\n\n\n//[The wave crashes down while Vincent pulling open SCP-042-VN‚Äôs door, a paper talisman suddenly fly into the wave and creates a yellow thaumaturgical barrier blocking the waves outside.]//\n\n\n**Entity:** HUH?\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Huh?\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: Keiko-nee!!!\n\n\n//[Camera pivots above the wall mould and catches Keiko being carried by Tekeshi, both being protected by another barrier similar to the one covering SCP-042-VN and Vincent.]//\n\n\n**Entity:** YOU DAMN MORTALS!\n\n\n//[Vincent opens the door and jumps into driver‚Äôs seat, then kick starts the car, Vincent holds onto the wheel, follow by a sudden energy emmission that surround him.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: LET'S DO IT TOYO-SAN!\n\n\n//[A glaring aura appears around SCP-042-VN so bright it slowly reflects on SCP-042-VN‚Äôs window, turning the scene completely white.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!

They all charge at Vincent and SCP-042-VN to attack.]//\n\n\n**Entity:** ATTACK THEM!\n\n\n//[The glaring aura transforms into a wave, spreading out and clearing all nearby class-Y entities. The scene becomes less bright, and the camera captures SCP-042's reflection on the yellow barrier. SCP-042-VN now transforms into a female humanoid entity, composed of car parts, with armoring made from the car's shell and two oversized shoulder armor pieces created from the headlight areas. Inside the driving chamber of SCP-042-VN, it resembles its counterpart in Mecha animation series frequently shown on media.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: WOOOOOOOOAAAAHHHH!!! AWESOOOME!\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: I‚ÄôM FEELING FULL OF ENERGY! THIS IS THE FIRST TIME ANYONE BESIDES FROM DADDY EVER GET INSIDE ME!\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##:  AY, WORDING! HOLD ON, WHY AM I.\n\n\n//[Vincent turns the camera towards his body, in a Japanese female high school uniform and wearing black fishnet stockings with an aluminum crown on his head. A Nokia brand ringtone can be heard from SCP-042-VN's control screen; Vincent presses the receive button.]//\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Don‚Äôt mind the clothes, just focus on fighting those Onies.

The beams from SCP-042-VN shoot out, becoming stronger than before and instantly decaying the enemy.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Hah, this will be quick.\n\n\n//[SCP-042-VN‚Äôs beams become even stronger. The Onikumas in the distance quickly gather into a line and start approaching, blocking the Ibaraki d≈çji who is ‚Äúcasting spells‚Äù behind their backs, all charging towards SCP-042-VN. Light beams shooting out from SCP-042-VN quickly disintegrate the frontline. However, instead of turning into light, the remains coalesce into a colossal frontline Onikuma entity.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: DORAIBAAA KICK!\n\n\n//[When approaching SCP-042-VN, the leading Onikuma has already turned into a twenty-metres-tall entity. It raises its arm and slams down at SCP-042-VN; SCP-042-VN dodges by backflipping, using the wall behind as a platform and launching herself into the air. During her descent, SCP-042-VN stomps one foot into the face of the monster. It loses its balance and falls back towards the sea.]//\n\n\n//[Camera then captures the other Onikumas rushing at them by climbing on the back of the leading one. SCP-042-VN counters their advance by constantly firing. The decayed Onikuma quickly merges into where they are holding onto, while at the same time, SCP-042-VN hears the roar of a Y-class entity behind her. However, instead of continuing the fight with the bears, SCP-042-VN utilizes Onikuma‚Äôs back as a pedestal to launch herself forward and opens fire at Ibaraki d≈çji. Unable to react in time, Ibaraki d≈çji loses its only arm but still manages to summon two Onikumas to shield it. Nevertheless, every Onikumas behind SCP-042-VN immediately disappears.]//\n\n\n//[Realizing the true opponent, SCP-042-VN rushes toward it, firing as it falls back. 'The child of demon' squeals, commanding four Onikumas to grab and maul SCP-042-VN, pinning her down in several seconds. Despite this, she is able to shake them off and shoots light beams at them to free herself entirely, then continues her chase.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: ARE YOU OKAY, TOYO?\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: I‚ÄôM SO FULL OF ENERGY THANKS TO MISTER CUSTOMER, NONE CAN STOP ME NOW!\n\n\n//[At this point, Ibaraki d≈çji has already reached Shuten-d≈çji and crouches down, pleading.]//\n\n\n**Ibaraki d≈çji:** Please my king, this lowly in-law begs for your aid. The enemy possesses such dirty tricks that trouble me.\n\n\n**Shuten-d≈çji:** YOU USELESS TRAITOROUS COWARD, I GAVE YOU THIS CHANCE TO REPAY FOR YOUR PAST FAILURE YET YOU‚ÄôRE STILL THIS WEAK AFTER SO MANY SPRINGS. NOT EVEN WORTH MY PITY.\n\n\n//[Shuten-d≈çji suddenly raises his floating head high above, and his invisible leg then stomps down on Ibaraki d≈çji, turning her into a black splash. The vibration generated is strong enough to throw SCP-042-VN, who was rushing for an attack, away. At the same time, smoke from the sea rises harder. A volcano emerges from beneath the smoke, sending waves to the shore. Although the waves aren‚Äôt strong enough to move SCP-042-VN, they still limit her movements.]//\n\n\n**Shuten-d≈çji:** NOW, YOU SHALL MEET THE SAME FATE. LET ME SHOW YOU, THE ULTIMATE POWER OF A KING.\n\n\n//[The entity roars, echoing throughout space and continuing for the next few seconds. Thunderstorms and waves swallow the background and slowly push into the shore. The entity‚Äôs head also rushes toward SCP-042-VN, creating multiple shockwaves in its path, catching SCP-042-VN by surprise. SCP-042-VN only manages to fire back two shots at the head before getting knocked back against the wall by an invisible force. Although taking two of SCP-042-VN's light beams, Shuten-d≈çji takes no actual damage. On the contrary, the entity roars again; a couple of debris shoot out from the volcano and crash down on SCP-042-VN.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: THAT‚ÄôS TOO DANGEROUS!\n\n\n//[The entity slowly approaches SCP-042-VN, laughing victoriously. SCP-042-VN attempts to stand up but fails. The inside of the pilot‚Äôs chamber is filled with flickering red lights, and Vincent coughs heavily due to the steam releasing from the machine.]//\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: Please run sir, I will try to hold him off for one last time.\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: WHERE TO RUN WITH WATER ALL AROUND US LIKE THIS MISSY!\n\n\n##E64019|**Tanaka Hiroshi**##: Are you still there? Help is coming in three‚Ä¶ two‚Ä¶ one!\n\n\n//[Multiple talismans suddenly fly down from above the wall, turning into light and fireballs attacking the head of Shuten-d≈çji. The entity is damaged and roars, unable to step forward. SCP-042-VN turns around to look up the wall mound at the returning miko.]//\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: //[in unison]// SIS!\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: //[in unison]// MISSES!\n\n\n##F30474|**Tanaka Keiko**##: Sorry you two!

GO TO HELL TOGETHER!\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: This one is powerful, sis. We can‚Äôt defeat him with just talismans. Even this form of mine is‚Äì\n\n\n##F30474|**Tanaka Keiko**##: Worry not, we will win, because we have more than just your ultimate form, we have the power of friendship, sisterhood and we believe in righteousness! On top of that, we have the power of the sixth Miko with us now!\n\n\n//[Other miko reply ‚ÄúRight!‚Äù in unison.]//\n\n\n##F30474|**Tanaka Keiko**##: Alright, everyone, let‚Äôs give Toyo the power to fight against evil!

We shall bring justice to evil in the name of Hokkaid≈ç shrine! MIKO SQUAD, STRIKE!\n\n\n//[The four miko and SCP-042-VN turn into multiple light beams which flew above and unite into a sixty meters humanoid machina entity.]//\n\n\n**Ultimate SCP-042-VN:** Prepare To Be Punished O‚Äô Demon! Purification Technique: Six-Petals Cherry Blossom - Bloom.\n\n\n**Shuten-d≈çji:** DON‚ÄôT YOU DARE UNDERESTIMATE ME LIKE THAT. BEHOLD, KILLING TECHNIQUE: DESTRUCTION EMPEROR‚ÄôS FLAME.\n\n\n//[A light cluster condenses in front of the light entity and blooms into a giant six-petal cherry blossom. From its pistil, a light pillar shoots out at Shuten-d≈çji. Shuten-d≈çji's mouth opens wide, creating a field of evil spirit‚Äôs black flame straight at SCP-042-VN. The field of evil spirit pierces the waves and collides with the light pillar, almost engulfing it with the sea of flame. However, both beams go to a standoff, balancing for minutes.]//\n\n\n**The Ultimate SCP-042-VN:** Still not enough to defeat him!\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: I have an idea! Toyo-san, I need your permission to take over!\n\n\n##green|**SCP-042-VN**##: Okay!\n\n\n//[The Ultimate SCP-042-VN sprays kuchikamizake from her back straight into Shuten-d≈çji‚Äôs mouth with ultrasonic speed. The entity isn‚Äôt able to close his mouth with the field of flame still pouring out.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Thanks to mister Hiroshi‚Äôs critical historical information!

Shuten-d≈çji slowly decays, and other Y-class entities quickly disappear right after this. The camera gets swallowed by the light once again in a few minutes.]//\n\n\n**Shuten-d≈çji:** YOU‚Ä¶ YOU WILL PAY FOR THIS!\n\n\n//[When the camera stops being flashed, the sea and the sky have already returned to their original stage. The scene is now inside SCP-042-VN's normal seats, with Vincent on the wheel, Keiko next to him, and the three miko at the backseats.]//\n\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##: Aye, we won. So, celebration time?\n\n\n**The miko:** Agree!\n\n\n//[The recording cuts to everyone stepping up on the wall while SCP-042-VN navigates to the carway.

This made an AIC working under RAISA deleted a majority of video logs about ‚Äúcar miko‚Äù topics on various social networks.\n- Having an over-limited pay-leave vacation.\n- Living in a resident's house without paying.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n\n[[=]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-041-VN]]] | SCP-042-VN | [[[SCP-043-VN]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author= Dept, KirQ and kblacke]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** hokkaido_shrine.jpg\n> **Name:** File:ÂåóÊµ∑ÈÅìÁ•ûÂÆÆÔºàHokkaido ShrineÔºâ -
