The object should be handled carefully during testing due to its fragile nature. The lid of SCP-1535 is to be kept in a separate locker, only to be removed during testing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1535 is a glass mason jar manufactured by the Ball company in 1946. SCP-1535 is physically similar to a typical glass mason jar.\n\nAnomalous properties of SCP-1535 present themselves when non-sapient entities such as insects or reptiles are placed within and the lid of SCP-1535 is sealed.\n\nEntities present within SCP-1535 after it has been sealed gain the ability to reason, fluency in the Spanish language, familiarity with Catholicism, and knowledge of Morse code. Residents of SCP-1535 are referred to as SCP-1535-1.\n\nAttempts to open the lid of SCP-1535 without damaging SCP-1535 have proven to be ineffective while living SCP-1535-1 are located within. The lid of SCP-1535 is removed simply when SCP-1535 no longer contains living SCP-1535-1. SCP-1535-1 expires 1-2 hours after being sealed within, presumably due to lack of oxygen.\n\n**Interview 1535-1:** A firefly is used in the following test for ease of communication. Testing with species of reptile and insect have proven themselves to be similar in result.\n\nSCP-1535-1 communicates by blinking in Morse code.\n\n> **SCP-1535-1:** Father, is it really you?\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Yes.\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** I am at your will. You understand the joy I feel now seeing you finally.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Tell me your name.\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1**: I was named Camilo de Garibay after my father, also a devout servant.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** How did you get here?\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** I followed the light in the darkness.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Could you be more specific? What happened before this?\n>   \n> **SCP-1535-1:** I… well as you know, I died by a sinful disease. Please forgive me.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** You are forgiven.\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** I have always wondered, what happens now that I am here? I am accepted here, correct? I have been faithful.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Are you aware of your present condition?\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** This is… strange, but I do not question your ways.\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Thank you. (//Breen speaks through the intercom.//) Interview is complete, please remove SCP-1535.\n> \n> //More light can be seen flashing in increasing intervals from SCP-1535-1.//\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** One moment, there may be something else here.\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** I have been faithful! I have destroyed evil men for you! Please! Please let me in! Please!\n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** …\n> \n> //SCP-1535-1 begins flying around SCP-1535 violently, colliding with its walls before falling to the bottom.//\n> \n> **SCP-1535-1:** Is this Hell? \n> \n> **Researcher Breen:** Not really.\n> \n> **Interview Concluded**\n> \n> //SCP-1535-1 does not communicate afterward. SCP-1535-1 expires in 2 hours.//\n\n//Researcher's Note: So far, all SCP-1535-1 entities claim to be deceased residents of Castilian Spain who lived between the years of 1500 and 1600.//\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-1534]]] | SCP-1535 | [[[SCP-1536]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=faminepulse]]\n=====\n**Source:** Flickr\n**License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n**Title:** firefly 8823\n**Author:** terry priest\n**Release year:** 2006\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
