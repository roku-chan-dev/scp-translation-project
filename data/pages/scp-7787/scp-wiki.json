SCP-7787’s page on the Lost Media Wiki is to be edited with information “confirming” its status as non-existent.\n\nDue to the lack of knowledge on SCP-7787-1 and related anomalies, along with the near confirmed danger of it remanifesting, further testing is prohibited.

Prior to containment, SCP-7787 had a minor presence in the lost media community, as its existence was unconfirmed. SCP-7787 was discovered by Foundation researcher Dr. Tatsuki Masuda using anomalous archival technology. Playing an unknown amount of SCP-7787 will initiate SCP-7787’s primary affect, the manifestation of SCP-7787-1.\n\nSCP-7787-1 refers to Yukiya Sasaki, the love interest of SCP-7787. Approximately a week after SCP-7787 is opened, SCP-7787-1 will manifest in reality. \n\nSCP-7787-1 will embed itself in the life of the player. During SCP-7787’s activation, an antimemetic effect is present, preventing anyone but the player from knowing about the existence of SCP-7787 or learning that SCP-7787-1 is a video game character. This effect includes removal of all online references to SCP-7787, and an inability to perceive any representation of SCP-7787-1 in visual documentation, such as screenshots.\n\nAll knowledge on the inner workings of SCP-7787 and SCP-7787-1 are based on the initial activation by Dr. Masuda.

Details about its release are limited.\n\nStory and Gameplay:\n\nThe game was a horror visual novel masquerading as a game in which the protagonist romances a man named Yukiya Sasaki. It played like a typical visual novel, with options that elicited different responses out of other characters, despite only having one ending.\n\nSynopsis:\n\nThe game starts with the player meeting Yukiya at the store, striking up a conversation with him, and discovering the two of them have a lot in common. The two continue to meet on accident, giving the player the chance to get closer with him. The player is warned by their three closest friends that Yuikya is dangerous, but they ignore this advice until their friends start being mysteriously killed by an unknown perpetrator. It is revealed at the end that the killer is Yukiya, who believed them to be in the way between him and the player. The game ends with the main character turning the light on in their bedroom to reveal Yukiya, who embraces them and promises to never leave them.\n\nAvailability:\n\nThe game was uploaded by ChillDaze to download and play for free on Windows, Mac OS and Linux online sometime between 2007 and 2011. ChillDaze only uploaded one game before their website went defunct in 2012. Their website is still available to view on the internet archive, including the page about A Chance Meeting With Yukiya. \n\nRecovery:\n\nThe files for the game were discovered by Lost Media Wiki user SapphireFantasy on June 12th, 2022. SapphireFantasy has stated that they discovered the OS files for the game on the 202nd page of Google on an unsecured website. SapphireFantasy played the game using an emulator, fully translating and uploading the gameplay to their YouTube account of the same name.\n\nThe main image I’ll upload for the article\n\n[[collapsible show=\"ACMWYPoster.png\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[=image Yukiya1.png width=\"450px\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nChillDaze's logo\n[[collapsible show=\"ChillDazeLogo.png\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n[[=image CD.png width=\"450px\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nOkay cool, I’ll gather some screenshots and stuff for the LMW page and I’ll be golden\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[!-- June 14th --]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f5f3ed; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\nMy review of the game: (that I'll probably post on twitter or smth)\n\nI feel its a really fun game. Yukiya is delightfully chilling as a villain. While he parades himself as a kind and caring individual, it doesn't take long for one to see he's rather manipulative, cold, and cunning. He does what he wants, and gets away with it using anime logic lol, he's a charming villain though.
