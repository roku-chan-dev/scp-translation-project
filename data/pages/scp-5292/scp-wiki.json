Currently kept under constant observation by my team. Books found within to be examined soon and sent to Overwatch if needed. \"The Keeper\" to be questioned and then contained with rituals. Provisional Site-120 to be filled with personnel associated with thaumaturgy for further book study.\n\n**Description:** Item is a large, non-Euclidean library located approximately 60 meters underground the mines in Częstochowa, Poland, with numerous currently untranslated phrases written in Fae above its entry. Though exterior suggests it is only 100 m x 100 x 20 m large, its interior is approximated to be around three times that size. \n\nInside, a spectral human (Codename -- \"The Keeper\") can be found. Despite being theorized to date from ancient times, it is able to converse in any existent language at will and possesses superficial knowledge of the outside world, with most recent facts possessed by it dated back to the 17th century. Despite being non-cooperative towards Foundation personnel, due to its state, it is not able to do anything -- the only actions it undertakes are walking around and reading books, with which it is able to interact. Research as to a potential curse binding it to item is currently ongoing.\n\nItem's shelves are filled with books written in nonexistent languages, describing either currently uncontained and undiscovered anomalies or nonexistent phenomena. Although most of such are as previously mentioned currently unreadable, current estimates suggest that approximately 1% of the books are written in languages known to mankind.\n\n\n**Discovery:** Discovered on 13/01/1916 by MacCarthy's team during their reconnaissance mission concerning intelligence reports of a Free Port existing near Częstochowa, Poland. When clues reported by agents and local authorities led them to the local mines, a search mission initiated shortly after revealed the existence of a buried entrance to item. Further action opened it up, allowing for entry.\n\nDue to this discovery as well as the still unfinished actions regarding the potential existence of a Free Port in the vicinity, Provisional Site-120 had been established on 15/02/1916 in the mines near the entrance to item. This base of operations is to be utilized for as long as needed. No civilian entry allowed, with only my team, MacCarthy’s team, Task Formation Pl/120, and Micheals allowed to operate within permanently. Shipments of further building material as well as human resources required for further operation currently pending approval from Overwatch.\n\n\n[[>]]\nSigned,\n//-- Hannah Rivera, Project Lead of the [[[historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego| Polish Containment Project]]]//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n22/02/1916\n[[/>]]\n\nDr. Rivera,\n\nYour request for additional resource shipments to Provisional Site-120 has been forwarded to O5-11 and officially approved.

Well, if you want a story, you'll get one. I witnessed the birth, rise, and fall of the old world. I witnessed as the rulers of it sought for what was not theirs and fell upon the might of God himself. I witnessed when He decided the world was too corrupt to exist as his creation and I witnessed when He made my brother build the biggest ship anyone has ever seen and I was there when water cleansed everything impure, watching from within this cursed library I was tricked into building. I witnessed as the world was built anew, coming from the sunken ashes of the flooded depths of the old one. I witnessed as you created the same empires built on the same mistakes, alone in your power, not learning anything, yet you, you think you know anything? You don't! You are the same people that came before you and you will be the same ones that will come after you, not realizing anything everyone tried to make you learn, yet you are here, thinking so highly of yourselves The only genuinely hilarious aspect of this conversation is the fact you think you're in a higher position than me.

A reminder that you will never understand your worthlessness alone.\n\n**Rivera:** Do you even know the languages they're written in? \n\n**Interviewed:** Of course I do.

It always happened to her. She always got the worst ones to cooperate with -- the irony of being the human resources manager and not being able to deal with the bullshit of the anomalous was quite funny to her if she was honest. But that didn't matter anyway. That was the last project on her schedule today, and now all she needed to do was to come back to the operation hub and she was free. She'd work on the plans of Site she'd send to Overwatch, but ever since those bastar--\n\n\"What the fuck was that?\" Suddenly, a voice invaded her palace of thoughts. A young and soft voice, but a voice angry at who it was directed towards nonetheless. \"What in the actual fuck were you thinking?\" Raia Micheals said, with their glasses almost falling off as they nearly tripped on one of the looser stones within the floor of the lowest level of the library. \n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"What the hell do you think Overwatch will say when you send them this?

The ones from the section about local inhabitants, I mean, and, well, we got its name.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"It's apparently called [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]], Fae for City of the East. I... that's everything. For two weeks, all they got is the goddamned name.\" Rivera said, rubbing her tired eyes. \"I'm tired, Raia. I really am.\"\n\n\"I know. Everyone is.\" Raia sighed, trying their best to not dump their problems onto Rivera. \"Overwatch tried sending some task forces into Częstochowa to find something, but other than a few spikes in Akiva and Hume around some places, it was mostly no--\"\n\n\"Wait. That... that might do something.\" She said, with a little more happiness in her voice than before. \"Did they ever find a reason for that?\"\n\n\"I.. no, I don't think so. They tried to mark the Hume footprints to some old rituals conducted by locals a while ago, but other than that, I don't think they did.\" \n\n\"If you could look into that, I'd appreciate it. Might lead to something. Hopefully.\"\n\n\"I... I will.\"\n\nAs the both of them finished speaking, neither of them walked away. The everpresent half-darkness by the library was... almost pleasant, really. It was a weird feeling, somewhat reminiscent of their childhoods, but neither of them reacted. They were too tired to notice, as everyone always was. But they wouldn't notice that either.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n25/02/1916\n[[/>]]\n\nVemhoff sent me another report today -- they translated a lot more than last time. From what I picked up some of the recent translations had some Russian and Polish thrown into them and they were able to extract some words and sentence structures, so this time, it went much more easily.\n\nThey weren't able to do much, though. The only really important text is some pseudo-biblical shit they said is most likely legitimate, but somehow anomalous -- the basic idea was that it was there in the original book, but //something// happened. I attached it below. The only things concerning the Free Port were some maps from the 1700s, which definitely confirmed it is in fact in this city -- whilst they did point to specific entries into the pocket dimension, all of them have been long-dead. But it is confirmation that these entries still exist, be it in similar forms. That's something, I suppose.\n\nAt least we know The Keeper didn't lie.\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| contents=\n<center>\n<h1 align=\"center\">Book of Hubris</h1>\n<h3 align=\"center\">(indecipherable)</h3>\n</center>\n\nAnd as God decided and judged all that was worthy of feeling His wrath, he gathered David and Noe, calling them to Him to asset their loyalness. To the older brother, He said to build a ship like none have seen, to bear two of every species, for He trusted him. The second brother, however, could not be tasked, for he was always not loyal — and He wanted to test that. To him, He said his task was to make sure no wisdom of the old world made it out, for He knew that if he understood the sins of the past, he would be trustworthy. He told him to spread His word to all that could listen, making sure that none of the old heresies would survive. Both brothers listened, and got to their tasks.\n\nThe older brother listened, creating the Ark that would later become known to all, gaining God's respect. But, when the younger one started doing what was asked of him, he became jealous -- he saw how God treated Noe, like a friend, and how He treated him — not like an equal. He hated God, for he did not understand — and that chance was quickly used by Satan himself. The Lord of Hell sought the brother and told him that if he wanted, he could help him to preserve this knowledge for themselves. He said that within them, secrets of the ancient world sat. Secrets that, when properly used, could bring one to become more powerful than God Himself, finally gaining His respect. If he wanted, he said, he could give him the power to build a library to store them so that they would be stored after the Flood, for his use. The brother listened, for he was blinded by hatred of God and his fellow men, wanting power only for himself.\n\nWhen the final day came, both brothers reported to Him, saying they finished their tasks. God saw the Ark Noe had built, and He rejoiced, for Noe had listened to Him and faithfully went through the many trials He put him through — for this, he crowned him as the lord of the new world that would come after the Flood. However, when He glanced at David with His all-seeing-eye, he saw the hatred and lies. Angered by David hardening his heart at Him, He struck him down into the crypts he created for the cursed knowledge he gathered, forever blinding him from His light of salvation.\n\nFor this, he will forever wander the depths filled with cursed knowledge, unable to share to anyone, as he wanted to keep all of that for himself; not understanding true knowledge comes from God himself.\n]]\n\nAlso, Vemhoff said he wanted to talk with you.

Raia always had good ideas. At least better than Hannah did.\n\n\"Come in.\" A young but confident voice answered the call, allowing for entry into its sacred archives. As the large, wooden doors opened, they revealed a small, dimly lit room. Despite numerous bookshelves located within, the main point of it was a large desk upon which stacks and stacks of unsorted papers could be seen. \n\n\"I've heard you wanted to talk to me,\" Rivera said, trying to locate the person that had invited her. \n\nTwo eyes were suddenly lifted from the papers, and a tired face filled with wrinkles despite its young age looked up to the woman entering. \"Yes.

Why, she could not tell.  \n\n\"I got more info,\" Vemhoff said, moving some of the papers from the stacks into his hands. \"Alone. I... I discovered something I wasn't sure anyone else should know.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Well, I...

They were all different, from identities, personalities, heights, and looks to even professions, but right now, they were identical -- all of them were nothing more than the weapons they made up. Sure, it was an awful look for all of them, but she had to accept it, as all leaders had. That's what needed to be done.\n\n\"They are,\" the voice from behind her said. As the Director turned, the voice gained a face. Raia Micheals' eyes were tired, but they didn't show any sign of tiredness themselves -- their mind was still going as quickly as possible, be it limited by the fact their eyes didn't want to cooperate. \"They've been here since you put the announcement on. Guess we weren't the only ones that couldn't sleep, eh?\"\n\n\"We weren't,\" she sighed. \"Do we have any new reports on their location?\"\n\nRaia opened their clipboard up. \"Latest intelligence reports from an hour ago show that the battalion is around two hundred entities large and is approximately four kilometers away. Not a good look.\"\n\n\"Does Overwatch know?\" she answered. \"As in -- did the messages get sent properly?\"\n\n\"I... yes, yes they were.\"\n\n\"No answers?\"\n\n\"No answers.\"\n\nShe sighed.\n\n\"I... I'll get this sorted with,\" she said, turning towards the group of people gathered before them. \"You and Vemhoff get to the bunker down above. We can't risk losing any of you.\"\n\n\"And you?\"\n\n\"Well, I need to be here, don't I? Someone has to motivate them, and if not the goddamned Site Director, then who will do the job?\"\n\n\"I guess you're right,\" Micheals said, heading towards the tunnel reading into the on-Site bunker. \"I... it was a pleasure, Han.\"\n\nAs the second-in-command left the room, Hannah Rivera was once again alone. Alone amongst over forty people. Ironic.\n\nBut that didn't matter now.\n\n\"So, everyone here,\" she said, standing atop the elevated area of the room. \"Everyone here knows what's up already, I hope. And, well, everyone knows how shit the situation is.\"\n\nAs the tens of eyes present within the room turned towards the voice above them, they suddenly stopped being only eyes, turning to faces. Faces with families, faces with jobs, faces with personalities. As she looked upon them, she realized how hopeless the situation was, but more importantly -- how important it was they succeed.\n\n\"Today will be hard. I won't say it won't be. Today might even be the hardest any of you will ever have to go through,\" she said, walking amongst the people gathered around her. \"But that doesn't mean we won't get through this. Why?\"\n\nShe paused for a second.\n\n\"Because we have to. If we fail today, all work we put towards getting here will be lost,\" she continued. \"And I will not let some forest freaks destroy my squad.\"\n\nThe silence in the room was almost unbearable. \n\n\"You are like family to me, I won't lie. I couldn't stand to watch any of you get hurt. And I won't. Do you know why?\" she looked at all of them. \"Because together, we can do this. And together, we //will// do this.\"\n\n\"Now, let's put them back where they came from, shall we?\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nUsing some of the tricks described in the books, we were able to recreate parts of the event so that I and Vemhoff could properly transcribe it.

The day before the attack, all entries into the pocket dimension housing the Free Port of Esterberg were discovered. Despite such routes changing rather frequently, the Foundation has been able to get the exact dimensional coordinates of the previously mentioned dimension, allowing for further access and research into this area.

I firmly believe this event confirmed everything Hannah Rivera stood by, showing us that Esterberg is not something we can just deal with once and never again. We have found evidence of its multi-centurial influence over local civilians as well as numerous anomalies created in the process, which simply //cannot// be ignored. The need for Site-120 is clear to anyone who has read our recent reports.\n\nI am of course aware of the problem regarding PL-X0R38/0124 and its most likely constant need of surveillance -- sadly, a system of instantaneous transport between a potential Site-120 and PL-X0R38/0124 would be needed to maintain that need well, which would take up unforseeable amounts of recourses to dig through the local terrain and establish a proper transport method in between. I do not know of any solution to it, but I trust in the Council’s abilities to overcome problems.\n\nPlease forward any further problems or requirements directly to me, I would be more than happy to answer or adhere to them.\n\n[[>]]\nSigned,\n//-- Raia Micheals, newly appointed Director of Provisional Site-120//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n04/03/1916\n[[/>]]\n\nI think I might have an idea how to deal with that.\n\n[[>]]\nSigned,\n//-- Maria Jones, the Secretary of the O5 Council//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#f2f2c2 url(http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/historia-polskiego-projektu-przechowawczego/RAISA.png) center no-repeat; background-size: contain; background-position: top center; background-repeat: no-repeat; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; \"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND INFORMATION SECURITY ADMINISTRATION \n\nThe following file is the current description of SCP-5292 and all of its sub-anomalies -- all prior ones are severely outdated, with fabricated prose[[footnote]] Despite being fabricated, all of said events did in fact happen and are entirely historical.

[[/footnote]] object and no active containment is necessary. \n\nAll Site-120 personnel are allowed and encouraged to enter SCP-5292 during their free time. Although all sections of it are publically available to all personnel, no-one entering should disturb the SCP-5292-1 Research Team.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5292 is a large, non-Euclidean location currently occupying the entirety of the third floor and integrated into the structure of the SCP Foundation EUPLCA-Site-120. Although exterior measurements suggest it only occupies 100 x 100 x 20 m of space, interior ones say that the true size of the location reaches 200 x 200 x 100 m in size. \n\nThe entirety of this area is occupied by an enormous library, spread over five different levels and filled with anomalous lighting,[[footnote]] Consisting of candles, chandeliers, and lanterns. [[/footnote]] which ensures the area is perpetually lit despite a total lack of any apparent source. On each of the levels, numerous shelves containing approximately 3 000 000 books total can be found. \n\nSCP-5292-1 refers to the books present within SCP-5292. Although most of them are written in previously unknown languages, many contain pictorial representations of phenomena, objects, and entities previously unknown to the Foundation. A few of such however are written in languages present on Earth. Due to this, a special research team, currently led by Alistair Vemhoff, a linguist and an occultist, is currently attempting to translate all texts found within such to potentially gain further insight into the anomalous world. These translations are approximated to take another 80 years to complete.\n\nSCP-5292-2 is an ethereal, humanoid entity confined to the space SCP-5292 occupies. It bears the appearance of an elderly, hooded human of European descent. Although it claims to be \"David, brother to Noe,\" as the only records confirming this claim exist as material extracted from SCP-5292, this remains unconfirmed. Due to its state, the entity is unable to affect any physical item other than SCP-5292-1 instances -- despite this however, it converses with personnel with relative ease. \n\nMaterial analysis suggests that SCP-5292 and all of its sub-anomalies are approximately 20 million years old -- though it is currently believed to be impossible for human civilization to exist within said time period, a few of the translated SCP-5292-1 instances seem to confirm SCP-5292-2's claim about the original creators of the library being a human society seemingly existing prior to the biblical flood. Whether such an event (or a similar one in nature) ever happened currently remains unknown.\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Open SCiP net?
