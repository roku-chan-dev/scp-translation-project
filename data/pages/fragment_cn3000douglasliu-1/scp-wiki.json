Welcome to the Memorial Hall of the Eastern Land Nodal Matrix.\n\nWe have compiled this file for your reading using the internal archives generously offered by the Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation. As the current management organization of the Eastern Land Nodal Matrix, the Foundation's internal materials are undoubtedly informative and priceless, unveiling a great portion of all those hardships and sacrifices that went into the establishment of the Nodal Matrix. We wish you a rewarding reading experience.\n\nAlthough we have endeavored to adapt the file to as many different models of reading terminals as possible, considering the sheer number of terminals available, parameters may not be optimized for some of the models. For your best reading experience, we recommend you read this file with a wide-screen terminal and try to update it to the latest version. We apologize for the inconvenience.\n\nEternal glory to all Nodes.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCP-CN-3000\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-intro-image-block\"]]\n[[image https://scpsandboxcn.wikidot.com/local--files/douglasliu-2/cn3k-node-broadcast.png]]\n[[div class=\"scp-intro-image-caption\"]]\n**Broadcasting Node, Mount Qomolangma (Mt. Everest), Vacuole QM-LM**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n**Object Class:** Thaumiel\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The Nodal Matrix is at present administered by the Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation plus the fourteen Chiefs of Node. Node No. 15, located at Vacuole QM-LM, is to maintain surveillance of the current status of the Nodal Matrix and semantical flow rate, in the meantime broadcasting public keys of Nodes throughout the entirety of Eastern Land. The rest of the Nodes are to continue performing their duties of upholding semantical flows within territories of the Land.\n\nAll research regarding non-matters, rarusium and semantical flow that took place during the time of establishment of the Nodal Matrix has been archived. For the purpose of boosting the research progress, with approval from the Overseer Council, eligible third-party research organizations are permitted to request access to the documents of Nodal Matrix-related technology from the repository of the Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation. Said organizations are required to regularly report their progress to the Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation.\n\nSelection and probation of new Nodes in non-Node vacuoles are encouraged.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-3000 refers to an anomalous technology that is currently the only measure to effectively mitigate the //litura diluviorum// effect and achieve complete communication of semantical flow in the thick of non-matters.\n\nEffective comprehension in non-matter and rarusium has not yet been claimed by academics, thus the concrete nature of SCP-CN-3000 remains unexplained. Due to the differences in physical properties caused by non-matters amongst vacuoles, the eigenvectors required to establish a Node in each vacuoles are variable, without apparent patterns, and generally contrary to common scientific beliefs of the consensus reality. For this reason, SCP-CN-3000 is still classified as an anomaly at present, although on the practical level, the use of rarusium for finding valid eigenvectors has been extensively implemented within the fourteen Nodes in the Eastern Land. The key technical practices for establishing a Node are as follows:\n\n# Find certain eigenvector with the aid of rarusium precipitated from non-matters so that when a semantical flow holding this eigenvector traverses through non-matters from a specific angle (normally in the direction of another Node), the occurrence rate of //litura diluviorum// is no higher than 0.00001%.\n# With rarusium leading the way, candidate of Node attains the valid eigenvector and broadcasts it (namely, the new public key of Node) in the form of semantical flows, consequently causing the candidate to become a Node.\n# Upon accepting the public key of Node, nearby semantical flows can subsequently traverse backward through non-matters unharmed and reach the Node for transmitting public key.\n# All Nodes link to one another, forming a Nodal Matrix, hence realizes free transmission of semantical flows on a global level.\n\nSince the principle of the anomaly is unexplained, the current Node Matrix technology still relies on candidates of Node in each vacuole to search for the correct eigenvectors on and of their own. The Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation herein express their appreciation for the dedications and sacrifices of the fourteen Chiefs of Node.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@

We have done our utmost, but still, your civilization's fate of falling into non-matter is too late to be altered no matter taking what unprecedented and miraculous idea the scientific geniuses of yours or ours can project. Our communication has invariably been genuine and ardent since the first correspondence shortly forty-seven standard years ago. On behalf of my civilization, I would like to say that we are more than grateful for our meeting in the stars.\n\nWe believe you have made full preparations for this final moment. Your organization specialized in anomalous technology research is surely erudite and has made great achievements by which we are dwarfed. Your understanding of semantical flow is perfected within the premise of being outside non-matters, and the entirety of your civilization is unified and ready to brace for such matters as well. Your eyes shine with resplendent golden lights which can be seen even from the other side of the galaxy. None can predict what would life inside non-matters be like. Nevertheless, we have faith that you can get across the road however rugged lies ahead.\n\nWe will continue to observe the \"Pangaea\" Stellar System and preserve the entirety of communication materials between mine and your civilization. If possible, we hope for a reunion after you leave the non-matter barrier. What a pity it is that all predictions by far give more than four thousand years for you to traverse, which is far beyond the total sum of the time our modern civilizations have existed, therefore both you and I are not able to tell what path our civilizations will take by then. Notwithstanding everything, on behalf of my civilization, I sincerely wish we could meet again in the stars.\n\nBest wishes, and farewell.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\nIn the year 3000 of Old Calander, the Earth was officially submerged into an area of non-matters within the Milky Way Galaxy. A new normalcy has begun since; non-matters split our world into countless vacuoles and applied litura diluviorum to all semantical flows in between. From that time on, human civilization has been divided into solitary islands with no outside companions. This is exactly what the \"Alpha Centauri\" civilization had warned us upon the first contact, and it is a fate that even decades of joint efforts of two civilizations could not change.\n\nHowever, without the genuine help from the \"Alpha Centauri\" civilization, we would not have been able to transition into non-matters and the new normalcy in such smooth progress. Our lives were decent and peaceful enough, despite the chaos and panic took place at the beginning of this new era. Human civilization could have met a fate far worse without the aid from a friend 4.37 light years away.\n\nWe the SCP Foundation hereby would like to appreciate the great contributions of the \"Alpha Centauri\" civilization. The most optimistic prediction at present shows that we still need 2952 standard years to leave the non-matter area. We have no idea whether our civilization can still exist by then, however, it is comforting to know that there is still a friend watching us from beyond the stars unreachable by semantical flows.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** A3-KT\n**Sender:** Xiao Xiangming, broadcaster\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][NT3AUBNN7D2EU424IU9E][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nToday we received a semantic flow broadcast believed to be from Vacuole A3-KA, with a litura diluviorum rate of 98.24%.

Anyway, we have enough storage of basic metals in our vacuole to bear the risk of litura diluviorum during the logistics. It's rightful of us to think about the worst scenario for our fellows and give them a helping hand in time.\n\nWe'll observe the non-matter environment of the next three standard months and transport 50 tons of each kind of basic metals to Vacuole A3-KA through semantical flow transportation, even if it was just a worry for nothing.

The current plan is as follows:\n\n* The object vacuoles are AW-7Y, AW-AU and AW-I2.\n* We have 208 files waiting to be transmitted, all archived and collated. If you have urgent messages to dispatch, please contact the broadcasting station as soon as you can.\n* We also have about three tons of vegetables, including tomato, carrot, zucchini and maize, to send out to Vacuole AW-12 which seems to be suffering from food shortage. Since all replies from that vacuole are unrecognizable because of litura diluviorum, the Committee of Vacuole has decided to continue to aid them without considering the maximum limit.\n\nYesterday we had a routine test of semantical flow transmission with a nearby vacuole, AW-9U. In the end, we received around 5g of carbon and 2g of glucose. Compared to the scheduled 400g of carbon and 200g of glucose, we can calculate: the litura diluviorum rate this time is higher than 98%, provided AW-9U didn't misinterpret the meaning of our message. But as said before, we expect the situation to be alleviated in the next week and the litura diluviorum rate to drop to a number we can afford.\n\nMeanwhile, it's worth noting that we also received about 12g of unknown metal from the semantical flow. They're generally attached to the surface of other objects with an appearance similar to gold, but unusual and bizarre in texture and luster. Field researchers from the SCP Foundation have stepped in the investigation.\n\nFinally, unfortunate news to our listeners: according to records recovered from nearby closed-circuit television, we confirmed that Qiu Fan, a 15-year-old teenager previously deemed as missing, had stumbled into non-matters surrounding our vacuole alone and is believed to be lost in litura diluviorum. By the will of his family, we're no longer broadcasting information relating to this accident. Here, we wish all residents of the vacuole a safe and sound life.\n\nSee you next time.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nBefore the constitution of the Nodal Matrix, all transmission of semantical flows was incredibly difficult with the blockage of non-matters. Under our management, most of the vacuoles follow the same policy: maintain monitoring of non-matter conditions surrounding the vacuole and regularly conduct semantical flow broadcasting to the outside. The density of non-matter wrapping our planet has so far not changed much, in fact, and the litura diluviorum rate of semantical flows is stable at an average of above 95%. As one can imagine, semantical flow broadcasting during that period was almost merely a thing of luck: we could only pray that through constant high-intensity transmission attempts, a negligible portion of words, fragments of good wishes and assistance would be able to withstand the corruption of non-matters and reach the target vacuole.\n\nSometimes by miracle, we could successfully transmit a considerable amount of semantical flows — even those as complex as an individual human being — within a ridiculously narrow time window, to the target vacuole with no large losses. It was a dark age, a difficult time, but there were still a considerable number of people who risked their lives against litura diluviorum to deliver messages to various vacuoles. Though such opportunities were as sparse as dust in the air, it was through such trivial communications that we began to see the light of hope.\n\nBut what is most important, of course, is that we discovered an unidentified metal precipitated from non-matters which are known to us today as: rarusium.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IN-SC\n**Sender:** Unknown sender\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//<BEGIN LOG>//\n\n**Male:** AIC, what's the density of non-matters around here?\n\n//brief electrical noises.//\n\n**AIC:** The estimated value is around 1482.472И/m⁴, 1.9% less than yesterday's value, but still extremely high.

Sending it to your portable terminal ... Done.\n\n**Male:** I see it. I shall set off then ... Go through the non-matters, reach IN-SA, and come back. If I really make it ... (//deep breath//) do you know what that means?\n\n**AIC:** It means that you have found a way to spike through non-matters.\n\n**Male:** It means //humans// have found a way to spike through non-matters.\n\n//brief electrical noises.//\n\n**AIC:** Collected data do not support this deduction. According to past experiment logs, the method at hand — suppose it succeeds — will only be applicable to you. You have tried 573 times before, and it is already confirmed that the anomalous metal precipitated from non-matters behaves rather differently to different people.\n\n**Male:** I know, AIC, I know ... So I must experiment and confirm it by myself, in person. (//pause//) And I believe I am right.\n\n//short silence.//\n\n**Male:** I wonder, though, AIC, before setting out. (//pause//) What's the chance for other people ... anyone from other vacuoles, to try it out like me after they also find out this method?\n\n**AIC:** I do not have sufficient data to activate models to fit the situation.\n\n**Male:** Guess, then.\n\n**AIC:** Understood, beginning simulated calculation based on hypothetical logic with unknown accuracy ... Your method requires an understanding of the properties of the anomalous metal, and the researcher needs to conduct prolonged trial and exploration based completely on personal characteristics, meanwhile the process is full of difficulties and uncertain conditions ... The calculated result is that the possibility of a single human entity successfully using this method to spike through non-matters ... is less than 0.1%.\n\n**Male:** So that's the case ... Then the chance for all people in our civilization to get in touch with one another again is ...\n\n**AIC:** To calculate this possibility accurately, I need to use sociological models to simulate millions of human beings' behavior, which requires a massive amount of process time. If we do this more simply, that is, to consider each entity's success as mathematically independent events and multiply the chance by itself millions of times, the possibility of human civilization reconnecting together is close to zero.\n\n**Male:** ... One can deem it as impossible. It would truly be a miracle if it happened.\n\n**AIC:** Yes, it is legitimate to call it a miracle.\n\n**Male:** But is successfully spiking through non-matters ... really an independent event?\n\n**AIC:** I am not sure about it. I need to utilize sociological models to conduct simulated calculations.\n\n**Male:** You said that requires a lot of runtime. How much, exactly?\n\n**AIC:** I am not sure.\n\n**Male:** ... I see. Nevertheless, do the math for me, AIC. I kinda want to know the result.\n\n**AIC:** I observed that the flame on you has changed; it wiggles more intensely than before. Do you want to wait for the result here?\n\n**Male:** ... Hmgh, it's a little hot here. (//pause//) I'd better set off. You start your calculation now and I'll see the result when I'm back.\n\n**AIC:** Understood. Simulation will begin soon.\n\n**Male:** I'm leaving, AIC. Bid me godspeed, will you?\n\n**AIC:** Godspeed.\n\n//<END LOG>//\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThis is the earliest known record of the finding of eigenvector. To the best of our belief, this audio log describes an anonymous person who reached his eigenvector which allowed him to traverse non-matters using the method of burning rarusium, that is, burning himself. It was two standard years ahead of the Foundation that this anonymous person living in Vacuole IN-SC found the relationship between rarusium and eigenvector, which is truly an astonishing deed.\n\nUnfortunately, we may never know the name of this comrade because his vacuole was out of the Foundation's administration at a time when the Nodal Matrix was not yet established, when the novel normalcy was just born, when organizations were not mature enough to orderly manage everything. These vacuoles were fairly common, and the distances between them were destined to become greater and greater with the increasingly wider barriers of non-matters. They were sparsely populated, and the vast majority of them had died early in silence before we got to construct the Nodal Matrix, so early that when we finally stepped onto their lands, there was little evidence of people living. Vacuole IN-SC was not an exception.\n\nMore regrettable is that we found our nameless comrade did not succeed; he did not show up in Vacuole IN-SA. Perhaps he burned himself out inside non-matters before he could reach his destination, or perhaps the eigenvecter he found was not accurate enough for him to not be drowned in litura diluviorum the moment he set out. His whereabouts are beyond our ken. When we arrived in Vacuole IN-SC, what we could find was merely an AIC device that had been conducting simulated calculations for nearly ten standard years; by the time we found it, no result was given.\n\nTwo years after the journey of our nameless comrade, more than ten researchers individually found the relationship between rarusium and eigenvector. Humanity started fathoming the way to send intact semantical flows through non-matters, hence the wheel of destiny began to spin.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** Y6-M3\n**Sender:** Yang Jianian, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvertor:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][JXSK1SD8GLCOAFWKHQI6][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat an odd material ... like gold, but isn't gold, with a form that never seems to stop changing. It can be as soft as mercury, or as hard as diamond; brown lines or shining fractures can show up upon it, even with patterns deep or flush, sometimes like a painting from some ancient civilization, sometimes like a fingerprint of a potter ... It all depends on what semantical flow it touches. Hand it to a thousand people, and you will get a thousand kinds of patterns.\n\nHowever, no matter how many times we put it on the same rock, its reaction wouldn't change in the slightest way. But it does show differences upon contact with human beings ... we ourselves are like this metal, changing on the outside but not the inside, bearing differences not in the general aspect, but in details of how to react to others ... Why is that?\n\nWhat a rare and strange metal. I suggest we name it \"rarusium\" after the Latin for \"rare\", shall we?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** CH-21\n**Sender:** Li Xiwen, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][DK732MRODP58LG1PQVJJ][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe metal is revealing to us properties of semantical flows that we have never thought of, specifically properties about non-matter and its relationship with litura diluviorum. Certain semantical flows are more durable and have less chance of coming across litura diluviorum inside non-matters. Rarusium is telling us about that!\n\nMaybe we can use it to choose what kind of semantical flows are more suitable for transmission through non-matters, find their characteristics, and utilize them for our benefit. This can only be done by a civilization operating inside the non-matters.\n\nWe need to broadcast this discovery to others, with our best efforts, to summon more vacuoles to join the research of this anomalous metal as soon as possible. After all, the SCP Foundation is born for researching unknown anomalies.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** FD-G9\n**Sender:** Duan Wan, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][KATKHL212GV8UEODVLDQ][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe reactions of rarusium to semantical flows are quantifiable. It's true that rarusium can have millions of different forms, but just like Fourier Transform can decompose a complex signal into limited frequencies, we can also find some fixed features from all those forms of rarusium. Our current calculation process is quite complicated, and I have no idea how to let others know it with a litura diluviorum rate above 95% ... But I believe, any researcher of the SCP Foundation living in vacuoles is capable of discovering this independently.\n\nWhat we're doing is not just a quantitative research of the forms of rarusium, but a quantitative research of the characteristics of semantical flows, since the forms of rarusium essentially represent what will happen when semantical flows go through non-matters. As the research continues, we shall eventually be able to extract a certain value from any semantical flow, from which we can pre-analyze what would happen when it goes through non-matters.\n\nSuch value may be called \"eigenvector\".\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Kong Chengqi, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][BZ2A83S5F55EOGK281GX][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI'm just a smith. I don't give a crap about those anomaly research by SCP Foundation, but I know this stuff is very unusual, and for me, there can be no more perfect metal or material than it. I've never felt such a soft metal with my hands, almost like some kind of clay ... no, not exactly, it can take my graver and hammer without breaking. I feel like it has a mind, a soul or something. Its softness or hardness is responding to all my expectations.\n\nIt's alive, man. In my eyes, it's alive.\n\nHow could such a thing happen ... All my instincts became correct directly: mixing with appropriate carbon would make it hard, mixing with copper — appropriate amount of copper — would make it shiny, maxing with aluminum, with chromium ... I'm still trying all kinds of formulas, but the process is ... too smooth, you know. How so? How on Earth can such a docile metal exist? And not only that, the metal is exclusively owned by me, because it behaves in different ways on other researchers' hands. Is this somewhat a message from god?\n\nIt's a shame that the piece was too tiny ... I got too few of these metals, I hadn't tried enough before they went out. I absolutely don't wanna get in the way of the Foundation, after all their research is also important, but I want more. I want more of these perfect metals. Maybe a kilogram? Two kilos? A hundred kilos? Don't know, I think I may never get enough of these.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-gold\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Guild of Fretting Goldsmiths has been expanding for some years, and to be fair, even if smiths today can compete with or even beat him in terms of techniques, few people have such a passionate heart as the founder of Guild, Master Kong Chengqi. His eyes always light up every time when we talk about rarusium. Perhaps only Pygmalion of ancient Greece can have the same feeling when he saw that piece of ivory. Rarusium is his Galatea.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** CR-KV\n**Sender:** Xia Lan, Visiting Principal Investigator\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][P4WHR5I1JFKK9M060R5I][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI safely arrived in Vacuole CR-KV. The researchers there are very professional and have good control of the transmission window. Thanks to them, a sickly girl like me can go where I want without getting hurt in non-matters. I believe that I don't need to trouble them more for the foreseeable future. Best wishes to them.\n\nThe research team in Vacuole CR-KV is very enthusiastic, too. Hearing their introduction to the facility, I knew I didn't go to the wrong place. The anti-De Broglie waves here are indeed more active than in other vacuoles, and it's easier for me to observe microparticles as well, which are quite beneficial for the restart of my research of the Ninth Symmetry. If nothing else happens, this should be where I live the rest of my life.\n\nI walked around their hadron collider today. It's big. So big. They really take advantage of their vacuole and make this place a dream for any researcher of anomalous physics. But there are two obvious problems, one is that there was some anomalous metal stuck on the interior components of the CMS Detector — something happened yesterday, I suppose — and they are working on it. They told me it was rarusium. I've heard of this name before, but it was the first time I actually saw it in person. It's clear that they are very nervous about it, but in my opinion, nothing can be too bad if they can do everything according to the plan, don't need to have compunction every time I come across a roadblock in research. They set too many restraints on themselves. Anyway, I need to familiarize myself with the environment first. There are many things to do before I officially start the experimentation.\n\nThe other problem is that I can see people following and silently watching me wherever I go. And they get quite nervous every time I use a radioactive apparatus ... They're kind enough, I know they care about me, but this is downright unnecessary. Fibrosis can't be cured even after a thousand years in the Old Calander, so little progress can be made under such an environment, I'm afraid.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** X0-BA\n**Sender:** Gegeen Tuyaa, Captain\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][1Y7UEE1VU3EMSUHM22E4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOf all the vacuoles out there, our vacuole, X0-BA, is probably the //brightest// one literally. The elders in the vacuole always say: the day when non-matters arrived, they saw the sun high up in the sky breaking into ten orbs, then all fell into the vast forests on the north with non-matter billows consuming the horizon.\n\nIn theory, this should not be the case, because the sun was far from non-matters, and it was impossible for it to break into ten orbs and fall into our vacuole. But what happened is happened, and the west forests always shine dazzlingly with ten light beams shifting in the woods. They are brilliant, but not much heat comes from them for some reason, as if they were searchlights with legs that everyone can see on the watchtower. We don't know what exactly are those either, maybe some concrete thing symbolizing the light? ... I can't give a better conclusion.\n\nBut no matter what we call them, those ten \"suns\" have brought us plenty of problems. The western forests became a forbidden area with abundant resources that can't be extracted. In addition, We have evidence that their anomalous cold lights is severely affecting the broadcasting of semantical flows from other vacuoles to ours. Litura diluviorum caused by non-matters is bad enough, and the ten suns make it even worse.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** DV-S8\n**Sender:** Shu Yongmo, Lachrymose Chanter\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][UD1ROC1HAO4G0DBXPDO4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI got the broadcast from Vacuole DV-SA and heard about the news: three infants passed away there because they were born with non-matters accompanying. What a tremendous tragedy. And currently, right in our vacuole, two more babies are sent to the intensive care unit for the same reason. That tiny piece of non-matter just sticks in their tender brains; brains that haven't got the chance to see the beauty of the world, so they are crying and weeping night after night. I'm not a physician, not trained to help them, but I sincerely wish that all residents in the vacuole can pray with me, pray for our two newborn souls so that they can weather the storm.\n\nMost importantly, I would like to tell their parents to hold their hopes. Non-matter accompanied birth is not incurable, and your little lives can definitely get through it; I am the perfect example of this. I can feel that piece of non-matter sticking in my skull at this very moment, like a rock inside a snow globe, pummeling my thoughts at all times. But I survived, because my parents didn't give up; they raised me and let me become a strong person. The non-matter didn't stop me from composing my own story in this tiny vacuole, and it didn't hinder me from finding my voice is beautiful enough to make mom and dad proud.\n\nTherefore, non-matter accompanying should not and will not be equal to death penalty for our kids. They will live on; I believe so, and I hope all of us can have the same faith as me. Our solidarity can make miracles!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-anthem\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMs. Shu was right. Our faith in unity indeed created miracles. We survived and became Lachrymose Chanters, and under her guidance, our songs have resounded throughout the entire vacuole. If one says that every soul who survived the ravage of non-matter accompanying is a miracle, then Ms Shu Yongmo, the first ever Lachrymose Chanter, is the one true miracle of all miracles.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 1K-ZZ\n**Sender:** He Sanlei, winemaker\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XECH2D07E6RDFJIA3NDV][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nDrunkards from 1K-ZZ, listen up, I'm closin' the wine-selling business now.

If you guys are the only people I can sell my work n' efforts to, who only want to grab some liquid and get a burning in your throat, then sorry, you'd better fuck off!\n\nSacrilege!

Her words are poisonous actually, like moldy yeasts causing diarrhea, but they're yeasts after all, not dry peels can't be juiced. I'd admit, I'm not very happy with what I have created, which perhaps is why they can't knock awake you bastards of terrible taste. I should practice my skills a little more.\n\nIf there's someone, //anyone// out of the chance of one in ten thousand, who regards my wine as his reason to live, I have to say, you are the true connoisseur.

Vacuole TM-A4 is situated right below the Node No. 13, and the vacuole where Node No. 13 is does not have a designated name due to its location in the near-Earth orbit.\n\nIn the year 2995 of Old Calander, Commands of the SCP Foundation each dispatched aerospace fleets consisting of ten to twenty spaceships to observe the condition of the incoming non-matters. Their vessels were capable of enduring long-time space missions' tests, and everyone performed professionally and excellently in the next five standard years. But on the day of returning, an unexpected non-matter surge showed up above the Eastern Land, and a great number of mistakes were made when the crude AIC calculated the complex relationship between semantical flows and non-matters. At this critical moment, the fleet captain comrade Igor Kamenev gave up his precious evacuation chance for younger pilots, then disappeared in non-matters immediately. We once thought Igor Kamenev had sacrificed himself that day.\n\nHowever, more than twenty standard years after the establishment of the new normalcy, the non-matter condition happened to be rather desirable near Vacuole TM-A4. In the consecutive time windows for broadcasting, Vacuole TM-A4 surprisingly received the broadcast from comrade Igor Kamenev from space. More surprisingly, judging from his tone of speech, Igor Kamenev was not only alive, but felt like the accidental non-matter surge merely took place yesterday.\n\nAlthough things are very strange, Vacuole TM-A4 still decided to broadcast semantical flows to the space in return.

I was sure that some letters were definitely from your own hands from the first few weeks, however, my confidence has started to slip away... It has been so, so long, Hengxin, to the point that sometimes I'm afraid of forgetting what your semantical flow looks like.\n\nLife in my vacuole is peaceful, though. Our research is going on slowly but sustainably; not many noticeable events happened, but things are still progressing nonetheless. Facilities in IL-G5 are much larger and more well-equipped, you know, and there's never a shortage of rarusium for research, which impressed me a lot when I first arrived and can still give me a strange sense of unrestraint after staying here for quite a while. But without you reminding me, my intractable habit of eating irregularly is happening again now. I miss your healthy appetite.\n\nHengxin, what I really want to say is... I regret. I regret having a fight with you. I regret coming to IL-G5. What if I fell into litura diluviorum in the non-matters on that day, I can't imagine how you would... I miss you. I do, Hengxin, I miss every moment of you staying by my side. You were like a tender duvet, gently containing all my impetuousness and stubbornness, but I tore it apart like a cutting knife just for my so-called \"research opportunities\" and \"finding the truth\". I was wrong, Hengxin, I was so wrong about everything. That knife has gone on a rampage without you, and I can only use scientific experiments as the vent for my temper. But things always have to stop at some time, and when it does, a feeling will dig into the deepest end of my heart, reminding me of how precious those moments were when you and I huddled up on the tiny and dirty sofa in the staff room, when I heard your breath and waiting for research results to print out.\n\nPerhaps this can explain why rarusium reacts so unpredictably to me, like the impetuous knife representing me, even causing several injuries during experiments — no need to worry, only small scratches. I suppose the difficulty of pressing it into numerical equations is the same as that of stopping me on that day ... Speaking of rarusium, it happens to be unstable only on me, not on any other people across the entire vacuole. I don't know if it is an admonition from non-matters, or some kind sign foreshadowing my fate. I have some guesses on its reaction to human beings. They're uncertified and probably can't fit into my broadcast this time, but I can say that I'm trying to think outside the box and listen to the guidance rarusium is giving to me. Maybe doing so can bring out new ideas ... Then again, my thoughts will always drift back to you involuntarily.\n\nI miss you so much, Hengxin. Hope the semantical flows can safely deliver this message to your vacuole so that you can know how much I cling to our home.\n\nBest wishes to IL-G2.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-G2\n**Sender:** Shi Hengxin, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][93ZM727PQCJXTCCT8BMQ][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nLetter to Nuoda,\n\nI dunno if you've received my message before, but I don't mind saying it again: I HAVE FORGIVEN YOU ALREADY! How could we ignore your dignity to force such a smart and talented researcher in such a small and tatty facility of IL-G2? Wait, why do my words sound so sarcastic here ... but you should know, I really think it's okay for you to leave! I shouldn't speak so angrily on that day... My heart aches every time I realize you left while hearing these words.\n\nHow am I able to stop you? You're so adorably stubborn and won't allow yourself to give up any opportunities ahead of you. If not, why should I fall in love with you then?\n\nOkay enough of cheesy words. How's it going with your rarusium? We've got bits and bobs of messages from other vacuoles. They seemed to mention a type of number named \"eigen-\" something; litura diluviorum has been very intense, so we don't know what exactly it is about. Since the time you left, with no exaggeration, our research progress has had an order of magnitude slower than before, slower than water dripping through a rock. Sometimes I even feel, like, my greatest contribution here is cooking instant noodles for my colleagues, though they are more or less the same — Shh, don't let them know this! Non-matter, you'd better throw that sentence into litura diluviorum.\n\nWish my voice can reach you.

Obviously, it wasn't an elixir for one's buds; the taste had little to no difference from before. Shame. However, I fell asleep after drinking the wind and then, I dreamed of getting up atop an unstainedly white mountain. Its color was eerie to the max, like limestones or bone meals; I assume perhaps pure snow would be livelier than that. I tottered down the hill and looked down, holy moly, what an absurd view it was! Layers upon layers of buildings stacked from the foothill to the cliff, extending from here to the very edge of the faraway lands inundated in rushing non-matters, with a color of lifeless white. I've never seen something like this before.\n\nFeeling there was something behind me, I turned around immediately and saw a Père David's deer; it curled up in sleep and was dreaming of a white horse... It was nonsense, how could I know that was a Père David's deer dreaming of a white horse? And behind the deer, on the other side of the mountain and under the dome consisting of non-matters, I saw a giant eagle owl. Its head almost had the size of a hill, and there were three eyes staring at me with glimmering golden light. What's more, its back was carrying an unbelievably big blow with more eyeballs of different sizes, some as big as the head of the eagle owl... It spoke to me, as though it was trying to crush me with the tangible echos, but I couldn't understand a word... Then, I woke up.\n\nDeer dreaming of a white horse... Eagle owl with numerous eyes... What the actual fuck are those!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-5-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-5-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-G5\n**Sender:** Yu Nuoda, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nLetter to Hengxin,\n\nI think I got something. That quantified number based on reactions of rarusium, i.e. eigenvector, is fixated for most of the time. Most objects' eigenvectors are stable because their semantical flows — their //essence of being// — do not change. Humans are an exception. The research team of our vacuole has basically confirmed that a person's eigenvector can be split into two parts, one is fixed and unchangeable like ordinary objects, and the other... the longer part, changes as one changes in their own life. What does it mean? Why does one part change and the other doesn't? Because one is the //outer representation// and one is the //inner characteristic//? One is the //body// and one is the //soul//? I have no idea.\n\nThe team will try to broadcast their discovery, but it's not what I want to say to you, Hengxin. Mine is different, you know, both parts of my eigenvector are constantly changing, that's why rarusium can be so unstable in my hands. I don't understand why there is only one person who can have an eigenvector with two changing parts, and why said person is me.\n\nAnd also, and ... Hengxin, whenever I hold a piece of rarusium ... I think of you; I will recall your face, your appearance, then a force will pull my beating heart toward the metal as if its gravity suddenly increased ... At that moment, my eigenvector's value will be jumping up and down like crazy, almost feeling like it's trying to drag me into the non-matters, but to what place exactly? Without a window for transmission, wouldn't I fall into litura diluviorum if I just walked straight toward the non-matters? But I miss you so much, Hengxin, I want to see you ... All my instincts are screaming at me, telling me that the rarusium can bring me to your side. And I would like to believe my instincts.\n\nI can't understand it ... for now. I believe I shouldn't keep researching the common properties of everyone's eigenvectors, because I am different — my eigenvector is different, so only I can obtain //the// one revelation from rarusium. I must discover myself. I must find the force, which pulls me in your direction. There is ... There has to be something in it!\n\nWait for me! Hengxin, wait for me!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-15\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-15\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** QM-LM\n**Sender:** Basang Drolma, Institute Director\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][U4HXIK93Z13N4RAT44C8][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith the help of the recently isolated piece of non-matter, our research group in Vacuole QM-LM has made some new discoveries on reactions of semantical flows with different eigenvectors when they traverse through non-matters.\n\nFirst of all, we found that there are certain kinds of eigenvectors which enable their respective semantical flows to go through non-matters with an almost-perfect resistance to information loss. However, such an effect comes with a prerequisite; only semantical flows going into non-matters from a specific angle can avoid litura diluviorum. The Institute has found some objects with correct eigenvectors that can move freely in the aforesaid piece of non-matter on their specific tracks; said objects even include one of our researchers, who drew a pattern on her right arm based on Indian Mehndi Art and attained the effective eigenvector (although this method works only for herself and only for the small piece of non-matter isolated by us).\n\nMore precisely, human eigenvectors are slightly different. It seems that human can safely traverse non-matters safely in a specific angle once one finds the correct value for their changeable eigenvector.\n\nOn the other hand, eigenvectors themselves can be transmitted within semantical flows as a type of quantified value. If semantical flows on the other side of non-matters receive the eigenvector, they can reach the location where the eigenvector was broadcasted by going from the opposite direction. The rate of litura diluviorum during this process is negligible. What it means is that a person who has found the correct eigenvector can constantly broadcast their eigenvector and eventually, other people can use it and go backward so that they can reach the first person's location. Needless to say, the value of this discovery is immeasurable.\n\nWe began to find a way to spike through non-matters.\n\nThe only problem is, with the numerous possibilities for eigenvectors and changing properties of non-matters, plus the differences of each vacuole's physical laws, we have not yet summarized a general method for one to find the effective eigenvector. But there is one thing that all of us in the research team believe: human entities possess an exclusive eigenvector that can be altered as one changes their behaviors. In order to find the effective eigenvectors and constantly broadcast them to the outside world, human is the best choice.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-G2\n**Sender:** Shi Hengxin, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][93ZM727PQCJXTCCT8BMQ][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMy Nuoda ...\n\nAre you alright?

Your body will react to it when you get closer to the vector you're searching for. You can feel a force, like strings pulling you, especially when you're in the proximity of a piece of non-matter. I know this method isn't meticulous enough for a scientific experiment, but on matters of rarusium and non-matters, human instincts can be quite helpful, I think.\n\nI'm sorry to not be able to give a more precise way of searching. My success is merely a matter of luck in my opinion, and there is little practical value in it. What can I say; just go and find it, my fellows, feel the reaction, and listen to the resonance from rarusium.

I know what you're thinking; you're wondering why I wear my makeup this way. Did you just cry? You may ask. Yes, I do have a tendency to cry; people often regard me as an emotional and sentimental being, and I know our little Gu and Zhan have the same \"problem\". In fact, I've been adopting a disguise for this in the past as sometimes I had to compose myself for a longer time before going outside. But as I watched these two kids, born with non-matters growing up — I made a decision. I've got to be an example, to tell you that such a thing is not a \"problem\". Instead, thanks to researchers on site from the SCP Foundation, we may find out that this is a miracle.\n\nThat piece of non-matter in my head, the thing that has been with me all the way since I was born, is the root of my tearing up. It makes me more sensitive to emotions, whether they're yours or mine, and when these thousands of currents of emotions conflow, tears will inescapably come out like so. However — shout-out to the researchers from the Foundation — it also affects me in the opposite direction. The overflow of emotions happens to be where my singing talent came from. Today, we can see that little Gu and little Zhan have shown their aptitudes for singing as well, and I believe such phenomenon is not a sporadic example. It is both a trouble and a gift for us children who are born with non-matter accompanying.\n\nNon-matters are anomalous, I can't deny that, but anomalies can be wonderful too, as people from the SCP Foundation have taught me! Right now, right here, in front of our two kids who are growing stronger and better, I want to show you how marvelous this gift is. Vacuole DV-S8, listen! —\n\n//[A soprano chant without lyrics with anomalous memetic properties. The audience would have a direct sensation of tears streaming down their faces, a longing for a more beautiful world after overcoming the difficulties, and a sincere wish for the pure souls of two children.]//\n\nThank you all!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe positive reviews from Vacuole DV-S8 for Ms. Shu Yongmo's singing that night were overwhelming. Thanks to her dedication, people began to provide non-matter accompanied babies with more love and care, and all of us is waiting for the birth of our next great Chanter. Beyond the borders of DV-S8, however, there was a more memorable discovery: the chant sung by Ms. Shu with anomalous memetic property was heard not only by everyone in Vacuole DV-S8, but also DV-SA, DV-AU, DV-KT... A great number of neighboring vacuoles had heard the voice of Ms. Shu — her complete voice, without any litura diluviorum.\n\nHence, this is the first singing ever by the first Lachrymose Chanter. On this day, we discovered that semantical flows sung by people who were born with non-matter accompanying can travel through non-matters freely and unaffected by litura diluviorum.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Kong Chengqi, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][BZ2A83S5F55EOGK281GX][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs an old saying goes, \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\" That's right, if you wanna make the finest wrought gold, you have to endure the heat of the stove. The metal, that rarusium, came from non-matters, right? Then I'll find it from the non-matters.\n\nThere isn't much rarusium on hand now, so I made a tiny compass, only the size of my fingertip. Mixing rarusium with carbon, chromium, nickel, cobalt... magnetizing it, and its tip would point at a place where non-matters are surging, just like I'd expected. I reached out there, grabbed, and sprinkles of rarusium stuck to my palm.\n\nWhat would it be like if I encountered litura diluviorum in non-matters ... I am concerned about this, but again, \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\" There are still so many ideas to implement, so many formulas to try ... Can I just put my hand, like, an entire hand, inside non-matters? The downside is I may get litura'd, but the upside is I can get more rarusium particles that would otherwise go away in the blink of an eye. \"Nothing ventured, nothing gained.\" I need rarusium, and I think it needs me too.\n\nBeing a smith for so many years, I've never thought of risking my very life for a piece of metal. Then again, I started believing this had to be my ultimate destiny.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 1K-ZZ\n**Sender:** He Sanlei, winemaker\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XECH2D07E6RDFJIA3NDV][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThis isn't happening ... I'm still thinkin' of that three-eyed eagle owl; even yeasts look like its eyes now.\n\nI ground a little more rarusium — stuff seems to be quite magical, said people from other vacuoles — and poured it into my mouth with liquor. Tried this for a couple of times, and it always worked. I would definitely dream of the pale mountain, see Père David's deer dreaming of a white horse, and that three-eyed eagle owl carrying a ball full of eyes. It was saying something to me ... Slowly I figured it out a bit, I suppose. Dreamland, subconscious connections, but there're non-matters all around. Do they cut off everyone's worlds of dream? What does it mean to me?\n\nAnd that deer, that Père David's deer dreaming of a white horse. What the hell does that mean? To let me \"point to a deer and call it a horse\"?[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**Translators' Note:** \"指鹿为马\", a Chinese idiom for \"deliberately misinterpreting facts\".[[/span]] But what exactly is the \"deer\", and what exactly is the \"horse\"?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** DV-S8\n**Sender:** Shu Yongmo, Lachrymose Chanter\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][UD1ROC1HAO4G0DBXPDO4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nResearchers from the SCP Foundation did some more tests on me.

All messages, whether they're emergent or need to be delivered carefully, I'll welcome all. If you have some, come and find me at the broadcast station! I'll do my best to help you.\n\nThe principles of memetic anomalies are more than complicated ... I can't guarantee the contents woven into my songs can really be that accurate. Emotions and feelings would be easier, but nonetheless, I accept all kinds of information no matter how tiny they are, even though they're just a word of faith or wish; I'm willing to do so, and I'm going to do so. Don't consider this a waste of resources and time, my friends, for there are too many dreams and hopes and wishes blocked by non-matters. I believe anything that is successfully sent out without litura diluviorum can have deep significance in it.\n\nCome for me! Come to the broadcast station for me! Send your words to all other vacuoles with my voice!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-5-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-5-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-G5\n**Sender:** Yu Nuoda, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nXinny, I am special.\n\nI should get it now. It is the eigenvector that determines the occurrence of litura diluviorum when semantical flows go through non-matters, and because the two segments of my eigenvector are both constantly changing ... The non-matters aren't able to parse my semantical flow. I can't just walk into them as easily as a stroll, of course. The non-matters will still eat me up in a bite for I'm not ... knowing the rules well enough. And rarusium has already been telling me this via the pulling whenever I put the metal near where my heart is. It's not my heart reacting to the rarusium, but the rarusium reacting to my heart, which means my unpredictable eigenvector ... Can be confined in a specific mode as well.\n\nI've made a small blade with rarusium ... Its revelation is getting clearer, at my heart's pulse, as the call of the faraway vacuole, as your very face ... I'm still hesitating; can I stand the pain? ... Xinny, but, I want you so ... I miss you so much ... I can't take it anymore ... What the recent forecast for transmission windows gave? Three years? Five? Ten? I have to wait for TEN YEARS to even have the possibility to see you again? I can't, damn it, I cannot accept this ... I cannot live without you. I shall not wait anymore.\n\nYou yelled at me that day, saying I'm a reckless idiot who got to leave for IL-G5 just because I saw a window. You were right about me ... I'm always that kind of a person. Once I find my way, I can go this way all day and all night, upset at taking detours ... Will you forgive me once more, Xinny? Forgive me alongside with all my previous mistakes? Because I have found my way this time, and its direction is leading to your side.\n\nXinny, I'm on my way.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** CR-KV\n**Sender:** Xia Lan, Visiting Principal Investigator\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][P4WHR5I1JFKK9M060R5I][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSorry to go back on my word, guys in Vacuole CR-KH, but I need your hands again.\n\nOur non-matter prediction work gave us a few time windows and I want to use them to evacuate all researchers out of here except myself. In hindsight, maybe the incident that happened before ... has nothing to do with the experiment procedures and laboratory practices; the microscopic particles of Vacuole CR-KV are just so active that our bodies will inevitably take damage even by merely staying in the facility, not to say doing research and stuff. And now, after my recent communication and integration of research outcomes, I am safe to say my research of the Ninth Symmetry is a total failure: the direction was wrong. Nothing valuable can come out no matter how much research we do, therefore there is no reason to keep everyone in this hazardous place.\n\nHowever, I will continue to stay here per my wish. As I said before, this place shall be where I live the rest of my life, and it's unnecessary to waste the transmission window for a half-bedridden person like me. The amount of radiation and things like that make no difference to me, not like the other guys.\n\nJust, don't worry for me, please, my time here is peaceful enough. I examined several other groups' research and found some novel projects for my amusement, specifically those about reactions between anomalous particles and rarusium. I remember the time when I touched rarusium for the first time, and they asked me to describe the feeling. I said, \"Feels like it's emitting numerous rays to spike me through.\" It wasn't a lie. I did have such an intuition at the time, but upon hearing my words, they immediately muted themselves as if they were suddenly immersed in ice water ... They are all good kids, so I have to get them out of there.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** WL-9I\n**Sender:** Jiao Anlan, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][4SKJA8YGXK3AMIH2LJYI][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nA lot of vacuoles, including ours, have begun to realize the relationships between rarusium, eigenvectors and non-matters, and all researchers in our vacuole are trying to find eigenvectors of their own. But no one has got a clue yet ... It's like fishing in the air, quite literally. We're sure that everyone gets a different reaction when exposed to rarusium, but how can one turn that abstract reaction into a specific method of changing oneself? And what exactly counts for \"changing oneself\"?\n\nIs that what we call an anomaly? How unreasonable! It seems to me that those examples of reaching the valid eigenvector are //bona fide// miracles.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Kong Chengqi, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][BZ2A83S5F55EOGK281GX][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe rarusium precipitates //inside// my hands, like a dagger stabbing my palms and fingers. I not only see it, but feel it, for those pieces just stuck at my finger bones and knuckles, and I can sense the friction every time I move my hand. The longer I put my hands in non-matters, the more rarusium can come out. Shit, there comes the litura diluviorum. Damn. My right hand's ring finger is lost ... Whatever. I made myself a new one with rarusium; I can make anything as long as I got rarusium. The rarusium inside my hands doesn't bother my crafting to any extent either, because of course it won't! Rarusium is //my// material, and I am rarusium's smith. We are one.\n\nMy hands reach farther and farther, as though rarusium in the non-matters is calling me. Soon I might really step into non-matters with half of my body ... I'm not sure if this is too fanatic, but I can't try it anyway; the SCP Foundation has come to my door. They're pretty curious too; those researchers in white got their minds blown when seeing my hands covered in rarusium, my techniques of crafting rarusium and the cooperation of me and rarusium. They want me to collaborate. They'll give me rarusium and watch me do whatever I want, with no intervention.\n\nI'll certainly grasp such an opportunity.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 1K-ZZ\n**Sender:** He Sanlei, winemaker\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XECH2D07E6RDFJIA3NDV][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI.

An environment resembling the small Institute of the said vacuole can be seen directly at the front. Brief moments later, the lights of a room on the second floor of the institute were turned on and a vague male figure is visible walking out onto the balcony. He looked over toward the camera, rubbed his eyes, looked at it for some time longer, then rushed back into the building. All the lights of the facility were switched on seconds later. A voice can be heard yelling inside, \"Medical team! I need a medical team here! First aid! First aid kit!\"//\n\n**Nuoda:** I made it.\n\n//The Institute's gate was opened and a male in thin sleeping clothes holding a first aid kit and an excessive amount of bandages can be seen hurrying toward the camera. The person is recognized to be Senior Researcher Shi Hengxin; his face glistened with tears as he yelled to the recorder.//\n\n**Shi Hengxin:** Nuoda!\n\n**Nuoda:** Hengxin, I made it —\n\n//Shi Hengxin dropped the kit onto the ground and started to put bandages on the recorder while sobbing. The camera moved lower, showing a large stain of blood on the left side of his blue shirt. Hengxin frantically tried to cover it up with bandages.//\n\n**Hengxin:** Nuoda ... (//chocks//) you ... You have to hold up, the medics are coming ... Don't ... don't ... (//chocks//) Stay awake ... Nuoda ... Stay awake ...\n\n**Nuoda:** You need to listen to me first Hengxin —\n\n//The recorder tried to loosen the bandages, but stopped at Hengxin's resistance.//\n\n**Hengxin:** No ... (//chocks//) No ...\n\n**Nuoda:** Hengxin, listen to me. Don't get too nervous.\n\n//The recorder grabbed Hengxin's shoulder, making him drop the bandages on his hands. Shi Hengxin looked up with his face fully stained in tears.//\n\n**Hengxin:** What?\n\n**Nuoda:** I'm fine, Hengxin. I'm totally alright. (//pause//) See.\n\n//The recorder lowered his head, unbuttoned the upper part of his clothes and pulled the fabric apart. A huge hole is visible on his thoracic cavity where his heart should be, but most of the blood had stopped flowing out and wounds near the edge of the hold had even entered the initial stage of healing.//\n\n**Hengxin:** What ... what is this ...\n\n**Nuoda:** This is how I managed to travel across the non-matters. (//pause//) I made it, Hengxin. I can walk freely in non-matters without getting drowned in litura diluviorum now.\n\n//Shi Hengxin looked into the eyes of the recorder for a while with a confused face. Then he wailed, cuddling the recorder with loud sounds of crying and hard breathing audible in the background, one after another.//\n\n**Hengxin:** Nuoda ... Nuoda ... (//sobs//) I ... I miss you ... I miss you so much!\n\n**Nuoda:** I know. Your semantical flows were constantly disturbed at my side, but I can tell that you miss me very much from the fragments of those words.\n\n**Hengxin:** I have ... have so many things ... (//sobs//) didn't share with you ... You're here ... You've come back ... Waaahh ...\n\n**Nuoda:** Yes. I have succeeded. What an exciting discovery. Now with the non-matters not bothering me, we can start to synchronize our research and contact other vacuoles right now.\n\n//A short silence, and Shi Hengxin released the recorder from his hug and took a step back.//\n\n**Hengxin:** What ... what did you say?\n\n**Nuoda:** I say, we can start to synchronize our research and contact other vacuoles right now. Wouldn't it be nice?\n\n**Hengxin:** Yes, it's nice ... but ... why ... why're you like ...\n\n//Shi Hengxin watched the empty hole on the recorder in silence, then trembled and screamed at the top of his lungs.//\n\n**Hengxin:** AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!\n\n**Nuoda:** Hengxin? What happened? I've made it, I got through the non-matters. This is a discovery of great significance.\n\n**Hengxin:** But you ... but you ... (//sobs//) You can't feel it anymore?\n\n**Nuoda:** I don't understand.\n\n//Shi Hengxin took the recorder's right hand and put it on his own chest.//\n\n**Hengxin:** You ... Tell me, what you feel right now.\n\n**Nuoda:** I can feel that your heart is beating intensely. You are stimulated, Hengxin, which is a normal behavior. Why are you acting like that?\n\n**Hengxin:** Because I love you! Because I'm excited, that's why! I'm thinking ... (//sobs//) I'm thinking we can be together again; we can cuddle together, cook together, watch movies ... (//sobs//) together, waiting for experiment results on that couch together ... together ...\n\n**Nuoda:** I can do those things now —\n\n**Hengxin:** But you can't feel! You're ... You'd just ...

Any vacuole receiving this, please send help as soon as possible. Please.\n\nI will now describe the overall environment of the vacuole. Vacuole RW-55 is a very small, desert-like place. In the center there is a huge piece of metal hovering at half a meter off the ground with a height of approximately two meters. Its appearance resembles gold, but is covered with grooves similar to nodules on a tree trunk.

I have faith in Vacuole CR-KH's techniques for controlling the transmission window. They are sure to have a good journey.\n\nThinking about it, it was ludicrous of me to imagine this vacuole would have made a miracle to save my research on the Ninth Symmetry destined to fail. Rarusium was behind all of these, in a way. Vacuole CR-KV didn't bring me here because of my research, but because I was the only person who had ceased to mind the radiation hazard, almost like I was the chosen one.\n\nI have read all the documents they left behind about rarusium and eigenvector, and experimented on my own for a bit, too. That feeling rarusium is giving, that feeling of radioactivity, is an intimation. I felt it when I let a small cluster of β-ray pierce through my palm, as the rarusium was calling me, the entire vacuole rippling for the slightest bit, and a subtle force pulling at me ... It's all fate, isn't it? The reason why I am the closest one to the valid eigenvector in this vacuole is precisely that my body has got so used to taking the bath of radiation.\n\nI am currently inside the hadron collider. I will turn it on, and then, I will broadcast my valid eigenvector to the outside. I said many times: this place shall be where I live the rest of my life. This is not a result of obstinateness but of a clear vision of my future.\n\nEveryone, stop coming to my vacuole anymore. This place is made for me. This is where I am meant to be.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhile the name \"Vacuole No. 1\" sounds quite respectworthy, as per the current policy, transmission of semantical flows other than pure information using the Node No. 1's public key is not allowed; tourism and transportation uses of Vacuole No. 1 are forbidden. The reason behind this is rather simple: the entire Vacuole has submerged in an extremely high radiation dose of 1200mSv. Although ... the scenery is indeed unforgettable if you somehow get a chance to enter it. Under the cerulean aura like Cherenkov radiation is the Vacuole itself, and in the center of its brilliance is the radiant hadron collider of the research institute.\n\nWe believe Chief of Vacuole No.1, comrade Xia Lan, is within the hadron collider, but nearly all communication attempts with her have failed. Even her status remains a mystery to us. Nonetheless, Vacuole No. 1 is always active; Xia Lan is always broadcasting her eigenvector.\n\nShe is always there.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 1K-ZZ\n**Sender:** He Sanlei, winemaker\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XECH2D07E6RDFJIA3NDV][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nDead men can't brew, y' say? Well then, now I revive the deceased!\n\nI finally figure 't out, wherefore I dreamt about yond three-eyed eagle owl. Ditch those rules of reality, mine own people, dream prevails in this world, and by witness of ye thousand eyes of three-eyed eagle owl, I decree: in my dreamland, upon Nanshan, everything is permitted!\n\n//Qu'est-ce que l'éternité ?// We thought to be eternal is to not change, but to not change is to be dead. Now world is shredded by non-matters into gutter water, nothing to be runner, hence nay development can lodge if no barrier is broken, no beings can life if no change is risen. But why eternity equals to unchangingness? Why eternity is death? What made sloven sheds, shaggy shanties, sloppy stacked structures in Nanshan a representation of foreverness? Now even us, encaged in non-matters in dreamland, did stick in stereotypes and platitudes too? Vinegar for sauté, wine for biscuit? I REJECT THEM!\n\n//Dégage !// Counterfeit eternity! To wend the antithetical route, I'd say true foreverness is changing, is uncertainty! No recipe writes the exact amount of molecules, no two drams of liquor gust the same ... Differentiation at each moment lies within ev'ry attempt, every exploration. We drink for what? For experencing this wild mad world in delusion! O how 't be the constituted truth of Universe; altering vortexes infiltrate every cosmic corners, when this non-matter thing tries to hide them from us, calling us to retreat! To relinquish! To wait for eternal death in this broken spacetime! FUCK YOU!\n\nI know not if real world is like this. //Mais voici le rêve !// I dominate this place! Whether this belongs to a madhouse, whether this is catalogued as dementia, I still say, under the barbed wire of non-matters, I shall seek change, I shall jump into vortex; I rather drunk amongst imps, daemons, ghosts and monsters, than sober amongst ennui, boredom, tedium and listlessness! In a dream nonmatterial, in the Nanshan dead, even though this is a deer dreaming of white horse, I will point at it and declare:\n\n\"IT IS NOT A DEER, BUT A HORSE!\"\n\nAnd then, rumbles like the falling of Earth came into my ears. Pitch blackness of sky dissipated rapidly in the dream, blinding sunlight encompassed the mountain dark as fertile yard. In front of me was a curled-up white horse, dreaming of a deer. Three-eyed eagle owl from afar glazed at me silently, then beat its wings. It soared.\n\nI woke up. I found myself at the center of my cellar. I was holding wine glass made of rarusium, holding a gossamer liquid. I raised my head, drank all of it with one gulp.\n\nPeople of Vacuole 1K-ZZ, I BREWED THE ZHONGSHANCHENG!\n\nI'm to be drunk for thousand days.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Kong Chengqi, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][BZ2A83S5F55EOGK281GX][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI built up a workshop next to this vacuole's broadcasting station, then spent a whole month upgrading its antenna with rarusium. SCP Foundation thought of this idea first, to be fair. They said I can feel free to do my jobs, even at the cost of postponing months of broadcast. They even asked me to show personal styles in it — as much as possible — how strange, nobody had said something like this before. They claimed that rarusium could show special effects after my hammering. Now the work is done, and they have made their tests, which turns out to be ... really effective. I have no idea what that effect thingy is about. I'm just a smith, how am I supposed to know that? Anyway, I'm glad to help them out.\n\nRarusium is plentiful now, but I already got used to walking to the edge of my vacuole and reaching out into the non-matters, feeling particles of rarusium fretting my hands. It feels like ... a ritual? A ritual helping me to get in harmony with rarusium? And it is an essential ritual.\n\nYesterday I bumped into another guy; a lad, not young, but still had that kind of childish look on his face. He should know who I am, but he was curious about what I'm doing. So I put a lil' piece of rarusium on his left palm. He grabbed it with his right hand, and would you know that, the rarusium is so soft like dough. He played with it with a couple of fingers, and the piece of rarusium turned into a ball, a cube, then a ... roughly crafted cog.\n\nOh man. I'm hiring apprentices now.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Ba Hongjin, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][KOZZ99O45ISKXDR02EQ9][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI am becoming an apprentice.

At first, I was not so sure about what it meant, but through time I did get a feeling of something inside the metal ... There was a melody, a song. I try to chant it out by my intuition only — I have no guarantee of it being out of tune or not — when my voice matches the rarusium, it vibrates on my hand, then the vibration stretches outward to the point where all non-matters surrounding the vacuole are resonating together ... Might not be happening though. That vibration thing could just be my subjective impression.\n\nI hear news from vacuoles far away. I hear that the blockage of non-matters is relieving. More people have started to find where they should go now, and me too, I find my songs to be strong and powerful as well.\n\nI'm working on a song based on the melody from rarusium ... A song about connection, about our hope. I'll go to the radio station and sing it to everyone once it's done.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-15\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-15\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** QM-LM\n**Sender:** Basang Drolma, Institute Director\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][U4HXIK93Z13N4RAT44C8][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMount Qomolangma, the highest mountain peak in the Old World, is located in our vacuole. We are able to recover an ample amount of rarusium in the vacuole, which probably owes to this unique high-altitude geographic environment. Grounding on our past research into rarusium and non-matters, my team has devised an idea of building a massive signal tower for semantical flow transmission with rarusium on top of Mound Qomolangma. A structure of similar size should be capable of amplifying semantical flows to higher orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the signal tower can spread it to larger areas when someone broadcasts their valid eigenvector.\n\nWe had been conducting the plan steadily as scheduled, but after receiving messages brought by comrade Yu Nuoda from Vacuole IL-G2, we decided to speed up the construction. During the first run test of our tower, we were astonished to find that we successfully received the expected semantical flow signal, namely valid eigenvectors from other vacuoles — we got three in a row. We are not sure how much of our findings can be heard by others due to interference by non-matters. The semantical flow signals we received were sparse; even so, we are deeply affected by the news they brought.\n\nFor those vacuoles which are broadcasting valid eigenvectors, and for those who have attained their valid eigenvectors and broadcasted them, we may apply the designation, \"Nodes\".\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-5-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-G2\n**Sender:** Shi Hengxin, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][93ZM727PQCJXTCCT8BMQ][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWe spent some good time on this, but I think we finally figured out what happened on Nuoda.\n\nSpecial people like him, people with constantly shifting eigenvectors, exist. But such changes are not completely out of patterns. Just like others can change themselves to alter their own part of eigenvectors, ones like Nuoda can also fit their unstable eigenvectors into a specific pattern by changing themselves — to fixate it to a cycling numerical equation, one can say. Once this is achieved, then they can roam around free inside non-matters without worrying to drown in litura diluviorum. The shifting eigenvector is like an amulet keeping the evilness of non-matter away.\n\nIt's a shame that despite what Vacuole QM-LM had said, these people aren't suitable for broadcasting their eigenvectors just because there isn't any consistent eigenvector that can be broadcasted. It's a rule that only applies to them and not us. But this, after all, is a discovery of high value since Nuoda can bring a lot of research materials to other vacuoles, and what's more, we believe he isn't the sole instance of such property. Me and Nuoda are planning for a project: to find more people with this kind of speciality and strengthen our power of communication.\n\nOf course, just like how everyone else finds their valid eigenvector, we're convinced they also need to make a change unique to each entity to be able to stabilize their eigenvectors' ways of shifting. For instance, Nuoda ripped his own heart out ... Hope not all people are required to endure such brutal pain.\n\nSpeaking of which, I have something else to say here.\n\nAfter synchronizing research materials from various vacuoles, we the people in Vacuole IL-G2 have also made a big progress in rarusium. It turns out ... that I have the highest chance of attaining my valid eigenvector. Even rarusium is telling me to ... Feels like Lady Fortuna is telling a joke on me, if I can say that. Anyhow, the rarusium tells me to rip out my heart too, in the same way as Nuoda.\n\nI'm sitting in front of Nuoda's knife with which he cut himself. He shouldn't have brought it with him for a purpose ... He won't remember or mind it today either, I think. How so ... I'm actually a little happy? To know I have sort of a similarity to Nuoda? To be fair, I'm not gonna act like sacrificing for love or some other tragic shit, if someone, anyone in the future would like to know my story. Okay, things are getting embarrassing now, aren't they? I'm literally blushing right now. What I'm saying is: the thing I am about to do is meaningful, for which me and Nuoda sworn to join the SCP Foundation. Our mission is to bring light to the world. Even if Nuoda isn't my lo ... my man, I'd have no regret to do the same thing as well.\n\nBut I love him. This is for sure. Nuoda, I love you.\n\nBest wishes to all vacuoles.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 1K-ZZ\n**Sender:** He Sanlei, winemaker\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XECH2D07E6RDFJIA3NDV][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIs the sun coming from the west now, 'cuz a researcher from SCPF came to me for a drink?

Our concept of \"Nodes\" has already fledged within various vacuoles. This time, we would like to compile the information at hand in the following format:\n\n**Node No. 1** - Codename GLOW, located in Vacuole CR-KV, with comrade Xia Lan as the Chief, who attained her valid eigenvector through exposing herself to the radiation of high energy anomalous particles.\n\n**Node No. 2** - Codename SPIKE, located in Vacuole H5-BM, with comrade Kong Chengqi as the Chief, who attained his valid eigenvector through spiking his hands with rarusium.\n\n**Node No. 3** - Codename ANTHEM, located in Vacuole DV-S8, with comrade Shu Yongmo as the Chief, who attained her valid eigenvector through chanting songs resonating with rarusium.\n\n**Node No. 4** - Codename ETHANOL, located in Vacuole 1K-ZZ, with comrade He Sanlei as the Chief, who attained his valid eigenvector through drinking a glass of wine with rarusium out of a recipe from dreams.\n\n**Node No. 5** - Codename HEARTLESS, located in Vacuole IL-G2, with comrade Shi Hengxin as the Chief, who attained his valid eigenvector through ripping his own heart out.\n\nUpon hearing this inspiring news, our team visioned an idea rather rapidly; an idea named \"Nodal Matrix\". If the number of Nodes reaches a certain level, and given that Nodes are able to aim and link to each other, then we can connect all of them into a reticulated structure. Semantical flows transmitted within the structure would be able to receive the eigenvectors broadcasted from the nearest Nodes, which would massively reduce the possibility of litura diluviorum. Moreover, when the signal tower at the top of Mount Qomolangma is constructed, it shall become a central hub for all eigenvectors from all Nodes and conduct broadcasts receivable within the entirety of the Eastern Land, which would significantly reinforce the resonance between semantical flows and the Nodes.\n\nIn conclusion, we assume the realization of the \"Nodal Matrix\" would allow us to reestablish connection under the new normalcy where non-matters have divided each and every one of us.\n\nAs can be expected, this grand concept is faced with numerous practical issues at the current stage. The signal tower for semantical flows on Mount Qomolangma has not yet constructed. The five Nodes from the beginning are still in isolation. Valid eigenvectors are directional and require finesse to align the Nodes for forming a matrix. Our number of Nodes is not enough, of course, since five is definitely not a quantity enough to cover all territories of the Eastern Land. We also need to adjust the errors cross-Nodally as transmission of error data between Nodes of a network is necessary for each Chiefs of Node to fine-tune their eigenvectors. It would be a Nodal backpropagation of errors throughout the Eastern Land.\n\nHowever, with the premise of a low number of Node and great difficulty between vacuoles ... the current situation is still excruciating.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
