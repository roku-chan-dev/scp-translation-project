I'm sorry. I need to ask you some more questions. First, will you please give me information about your timeline? I just need information about the world powers, the state of the world, etcetera.\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** World Powers in the 17th century: Germany, France, Russia. Germany and Russia acquired their current land in your timeline 700 years earlier after an event that provoked massive change of thought in those areas, resulting in feelings of patriotism and unity from the inhabitants. Germany had colonized what would be your United States and Mexico. Russia colonized the southern Americas, and France colonized Canada, Australia, and the majority of Africa. Current world powers: Germany, Australia, United Germanic-American Provinces. Currently, Australia and Germany are at war. Australia wants control of eastern Asia, and Germany is retaliating in Asia's defense. The United Germanic-American Provinces is currently in the process of annexing what you call Brazil and Venezuela. Russia is currently in a state of disrepair due to a \"cold war\" event between Germany and Russia that lasted 62 years in which political disagreements between the two countries resulted in each country threatening the other with Ewert bombs. Russia, however, did not have any Ewert bombs in its possession, so it could not retaliate when Germany dropped the bombs on Russia's major cities.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Well, thank you for that information, SCP-2412. What is an Ewert bomb?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** A mixture of highly explosive materials that can result in the destruction of whole cities.\n\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** Where is Luin?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Luin covers the area of Spain, England, Ireland, Wales, Scotland, and northern Morocco.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** What language do Luinians speak?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Lunavic. Lunavic is a Romantic language with heavy Germanic influences. \n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** How long has Lunavic been in existence?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** The first known instance of Lunavic was recorded in 127 BC.\n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** What is the current state of Luin?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** Luin thrives off of taxing its waterways. Luin has a prominent military force, but refuses to use it for purposes other than defense. As a result, Luin has lost only one war, in which they lost a majority of their land in northern Africa. \n> \n> **Researcher Carter:** When was Luin established?\n> \n> **SCP-2412:** The official state of Luin was established in the year 982 AD. Before that, Luin was a group of small states that shared very similar culture and language, but refused to unite until 982.\n++ Major Countries\n\n||~ Country||~ Government Type ||~ Year Established ||~ Land Area ||\n|| Germany || True Democracy || 1189 || Same[[footnote]]\"Same\" means it owns the same land as it does in our timeline.[[/footnote]] + most of Eastern Europe ||\n|| Russia || Republic || 1028 || Same + Southern Alaska ||\n|| France || Aristocracy || 862 || Same + North-eastern Spain ||\n|| United Germanic-American Provinces || True Democracy || 1868 || Area of United States and Mexico, as well as southern parts of Canada ||\n|| Novol || Republic || 1888 || Southern South America ||\n|| Kituv || Monarchy || 1888 || Northern South America ||\n|| Australia || True Democracy || 1723 || Same ||\n|| Japan || Republic || 660 BC || Same + Eastern Manchuria ||\n|| Luin || Republic || 982 (officially) || Spain, England, Northern Morocco, Wales, Scotland, Ireland ||\n|| China || Aristocracy || 1802 (officially) || China (minus Eastern Manchuria), Mongolia, India, Most of Southeast Asia ||\n|| Canada || Republic || 1915 || Same + Greenland ||\n\n++ Major Wars\n> **War Name:** Luinic-Germanic war (years 1802-1807)\n> **Cause:** During Luin's seizure of Africa, it pushed too far into some of Germany's and France's land.\n> **Belligerents:** Luin, Afro-Luinic Colonies, France, Germany\n> **Alliances:** Franco-Germanic Non-Aggression Pact, Luinic Colony Agreement\n> **Outcome:**  Luin suffers heavy casualties and is forced to surrender at an area near Sijilmassa to prevent any further loss of land. Germany gives France approximately 92% of the land conquered. The majority of Africa is now a part of France.\n\n> **War Name:** Franco-Germanic dual summer conflict (years 1818-1820)\n> **Cause:** Rising border conflicts led to violent protests.\n> **Belligerents:** France, Germany\n> **Alliances:** None\n> **Outcome:** Outcome of the first summer conflict: France pushes German forces out of its land using massive armies of steam-powered zeppelins mounted with Gatling[[footnote]]Although Richard Gatling's presence is apparently non-existent in SCP-2412's timeline, there were equivalents of the Gatling gun. For the sake of convenience, these weapons will be referred to as Gatling guns.[[/footnote]] guns. \n> Outcome of the second summer conflict: Germany pushes back into France, conquering small parts of the eastern portion. France concedes due to high debt from the previous conflict and heavy casualties. \n\n> **War Name:** Russian Arctic War (years 1835-1842)\n> **Cause:** Russia's aspiration to conquer the entirety of the arctic circle.\n> **Belligerents:** Russia, France, French Colonies\n> **Alliances:** French Defense Act of 1819 (France and its colonies)\n> **Outcome:** Canada invaded by Russia from the north through use of steam powered airships. Canada is able to hold off Russian forces until the Russian-Franco Peace Treaty of 1842 is enacted.\n\n> **War Name:** The Revolt (years 1856-1868)\n> **Cause:** Major differences in beliefs between the colonies and Germany itself.\n> **Belligerents:** Germany, German Colonies\n> **Alliances:** None\n> **Outcome:** The German colonies in America win the war in 1868 after 12 years due to a massive technology gap. The German colonies gain independence and form the United Germanic-American Provinces. \n\n> **War Name:**  The Southern Split (1877-1888)\n> **Cause:** Major differences in beliefs held by the north and south portions of South America. The majority of Kituv agrees to secede, and Novol responds by attacking them.\n> **Belligerents:** Southern half of South America (Novol), Northern half of South America (Kituv), Russia, Australia\n> **Alliances:** Russo-Novo Alliance, Austro-Kitu Alliance\n> **Outcome:** Australia brings forces in from the southern half of the Novolian claim and attempts to block Russia off from Kituv and Novol's western shores. Russia cuts through these blockades with rapidity, and is able to supply Novol with reinforcements. Australian forces retreat after an agreement with the Kituvian government, and Novol wins the war. Novol gives Russia some scattered parts of Kituv.\n\n> **War Name:** The First and Last War of the Century (1898-1909)\n> **Cause:** The two major factions of the world had major disagreements with regards to land claims and money. Russia starts the war by attacking China, and their allies join the war due to the obligations of their pacts.\n> **Belligerents:** Germany, Russia, China, United Germanic-American Provinces, France, Luin, Australia, Japan, Novol, Canada\n> **Alliances:** The Halberd Agreement (Russia, United Germanic-American Provinces, Australia, Novol), The Second Agreement of Shanghai (China, France, Germany, Japan, Canada), Luinic-Defensive Measure (Luin)\n> **Outcome:** Canada has little success when invading the United Germanic-American Provinces from the north, resulting in an eventual retreat when Russia invades Canada from the north. Australia makes offensive movements against Japan and China with the help of the United Germanic-American Provinces. There is mostly success, but these offensives are eventually halted due to the end of the war. France and Germany attempt to invade Luin. Luin defends and is ultimately successful with little casualties. French and German forces are pushed out of Luin. Novol successfully captures some parts of Alaska with the help of the UGAP and Russia. Ultimately, The Halberd Agreement is successful. Both sides suffered great casualties, and agreed to end the war in 1909.\n\n\n++ \"Cold War\" Conflict (Germany, Russia)\n\nGermany and Russia had major political disagreements, the most prominent being that Germany thought the world should have a democracy-style government, while Russia thought that an aristocracy would be best. Germany and Russia threatened one another with Ewert[[footnote]]Collection of explosive materials. These bombs have the capability to destroy cities.[[/footnote]] bombs, and Germany eventually acted. Russia, however, was bluffing about having any bombs at all, and was quickly destroyed. Russia was forced into a republic, and is still recovering.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
