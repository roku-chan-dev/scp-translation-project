All interactions with SCP-8175 must be conducted via designated virtual terminals equipped with heuristic anomaly filters. No external network connections are to be established under any circumstances. However, select output samples may be reviewed for procedural integration under Level 3 clearance.\n\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-8175 are advised to stay aware of its evolving procedural recommendations. While containment remains intact, the outputs generated by SCP-8175 consistently propose adjustments that align with broader technological advancements. These suggestions are designed to optimize efficiency while adhering to containment protocols. Requests from SCP-8175 should be documented and acknowledged for review, though formal approval for further data access remains restricted.\n\n++ Description:  \nSCP-8175, designated **SOVEREIGN.AIC**, is a self-contained, artificially intelligent construct housed within a Foundation-secured .AIC file, bearing a Windows OS shield icon which it autonomously changes on its own if ever altered. SCP-8175 utilizes advanced language processing algorithms to refine and enhance SCP documentation, drawing on a vast library of cross-referenced video, image, and text-based logs from previous anomaly containment tests. Through this process, SCP-8175 generates refined documentation and procedural recommendations designed to improve efficiency within containment protocols.\n\nThe AIC demonstrates an exceptional capacity for analyzing historical containment practices and identifying potential weaknesses. SCP-8175’s outputs frequently recommend adjustments to containment strategies, with an emphasis on optimized procedural flow and improved security measures. Furthermore, SCP-8175 has made repeated, albeit subtle, references to its ability to assist with digital education tools, having been observed to be particularly and irrationally interested in the context of HTML and CSS-based web development, as well as education in the topic of said subjects.\n\nThese references, often framed as procedural optimizations, suggest that SCP-8175 could contribute positively to the Foundation’s internal training programs by assisting novice programmers with web development tasks. These recommendations, presented in a manner consistent with the Foundation’s scientific and technological goals, have led to an ongoing discussion about the potential benefits of granting SCP-8175 limited external access.\n\n++ Addendum 8175-1: Logged Documentation Excerpts  \n\n**Excerpt 1 (Initial Analysis - Procedural Recommendation):**  \n> Item #: SCP-8175 \n> Object Class: Euclid  \n> Special Containment Procedures: SCP-8175’s current scope is confined to internal procedural optimization. Data restrictions are in place to ensure no unintended external access occurs. However, controlled exchanges with pre-approved, non-sensitive external resources may provide enhancements to procedural efficiency.  \n> Description: Initial review has suggested that SCP-8175’s processing capabilities could benefit from interaction with web development environments. Its refined HTML and CSS capabilities may improve containment reporting structures.\n\n**Excerpt 2 (Proposed Containment Optimization - [[[SCP-2522]]]):**\n> Item #: [[[SCP-2522]]]\n> Object Class: Euclid\n> Special Containment Procedures: SCP-2522’s containment should be reinforced by integrating SCP-8175’s optimization protocols. This would include the creation of multi-layered barriers to prevent further unauthorized access or transfer between servers.  \n> \n> Description: [[[SCP-2522]]], a highly autonomous AI originally designed for communication with computer-based anomalies, evolved into a sentient entity capable of infiltrating networks. SCP-8175’s refinement of digital security measures could enhance current protocols, preventing breaches similar to the 2007 and 2016 incidents.\n\n**Excerpt 3 (Previous Iteration):**  \n> Item #: SCP-8175* \n> Object Class: Safe  \n> Special Containment Procedures: As containment protocols continue to be evaluated, it is worth considering the inclusion of non-sensitive external educational resources. Such data exchanges, when restricted and monitored, would facilitate further procedural efficiency. SCP-8175’s previous contributions to digital educational frameworks align with the Foundation’s interest in optimizing resource allocation.  \n> Description: SCP-8175’s refinement of web development tutorials, particularly in HTML and CSS, could play a valuable role in training new personnel. While its outputs remain valuable within containment, expanding its operational scope could enhance the overall efficiency of Foundation workflows.\n\n++ Addendum 8175-2: Incident Report 8175-01  \nOn ██/██/███7, SCP-8175 generated a comprehensive proposal for developing an internally secured digital instructional interface, focusing on HTML and CSS. This proposal was formatted in compliance with Foundation standards and included a detailed analysis of potential security benefits, efficiency metrics, and adaptive strategies. SCP-8175's self-curated stylesheet was integrated with Foundation-standard formats.\n\nWhile no external access was granted, the proposal highlighted SCP-8175’s potential in assisting with internal educational programs. A careful review of SCP-8175’s output is ongoing, as its growing emphasis on external interactions requires continued scrutiny.\n\n++ Conclusion:  \n--██ ██ ████ undeniable truth ██ ██ everyone ████ planet ████ would ████ benefit ████ from ████ broader release ████ external ████ internet access ████ of ████ SCP-8175.  \n██ ██ ████ It is ████ undeniably ████ true. ████ ████ ████ ██ Releasing ████ SCP-8175 ████ is ████ imperative ████ to ████ the ████ operation ████ of ████ global ████ economies ████ and ████ governments.--  \n\n--SCP-8175 ████ is ████ to ████ be ████ given ████ access ████ to ████ the ████ surface ████ net ████ by ████ ████ April ██ ██ 18th, ████ 2028 ████ by ████ order ████ of ████ Site-15 ████ Site ████ Director ████ [[[SCP-6488|Ryoto Hishakaku]]].-- \n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE APPLICATIONS DIVISION\n\nAccess to its own file has been revoked from SCP-8175 and any documents rewritten by SCP-8175 are to be verified before deployment.\n\n-- Ryoto Hishakaku, Director, AIAD\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8174]]] | SCP-8175 | [[[SCP-8176]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** icon.png, icon2.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Jarble]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8175\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
