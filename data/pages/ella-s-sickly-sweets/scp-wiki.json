I'm using this post to introduce a project I've been working on for awhile. I've always really really loved baking, and I have finally opened my own sweet shop!##[[/size]]\n\n[[size large]]Desserts are my very favorite thing in the world. Down here in the south, we've got tons of bakeries. But my shop is like no other. Allow the beauty to bring you to another world of excitement![[/size]]\n\n[[size large]]I've even compiled a list of my favorite items to share with y'all as a treat!  [[/size]]\n\n------\n[[=image https://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Asweet-something/SPRINKLES\n width=\"400px\"]] \n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]###17E693|__Sprinkle Deco Cake__##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size large]]My sprinkle deco cake comes in eight flavors, but the outside is always the same. So much frosting and sprinkles you'll forget there's even cake inside! All my taste testers said it was spectacular. I like to think when the sprinkles hit your tummy, you feel the true power the sugar holds. Sugar is magical. The type of things you find delicious really tell about your character. My husband doesn't really like bright colors, so chocolate is his thing. I used to really like chocolate, but my taste buds started arguing with it. When I was little, me and my family would spend entire days just making chocolate EVERYTHING. Those were good times. Hopefully my cake can bring you back to good times![[/size]]\n\n[[=image https://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Asweet-something/LOLLYPOPS width=\"400px\"]] \n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]###17E693|__PoppyPops__##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size large]]Each different flavor holds its own magic. Like strawberry brings out the perfectionist inside of you. Especially when it comes to love! With love, things have to all work together. If your love isn't perfect, you have to turn to your love and listen to what they have to say. Remember that //you// are always the problem. Eat a strawberry PoppyPop to control yourself. Remember, we're always here to help.[[/size]] \n\n[[size large]]Lemon will bring out inner happiness and optimism, helping to ward away negative energy. I made one for my sister when we were a bit younger. She was hurting very bad. I wanted to help her, but I wasn't sure what to do. She was so lost within herself that I thought I would lose her. I told myself it was my fault. But then it came to me. Lemon could heal. I could be the angel I needed to be! Lemon is a nice flavor. It is also very personal to me. I had one as well. For a moment I thought I was wrong for trying to help. Everything was very confusing. I felt so many different things at once. But the lemon warded off the negative shit, so I highly recommend. I eat these things all the time! They really keep me happy in times of trouble. In fact, I don't get troubled anymore! Be sure to pick one up![[/size]] \n\n[[size large]] The rest of the flavors and their helpful tastes will be shared at the grand opening of my shop! Don't miss it![[/size]]\n\n[[=image https://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Asweet-something/SUGARBUTTONS width=\"400px\"]] \n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]###17E693|__SugarButtons__##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size large]]Don't let their looks fool you! My SugarButtons are perfectly edible! They are all white chocolate in a variety of different colors and shapes. These go great with any outfit! They aren't plastic, but give the same nutrients. It's like they were never even in your stomach! The more you eat, the better you'll look. You'll be a fashion model in no time. My friend Angel actually helped me with the concept. It's her dream to be a model. To get the right body, she'd diet. She even went to the hospital to finish off the look, though she said they didn't quite get the statement she was trying to make. Anyways, make sure to pick up a bag![[/size]] \n\n\n[[=image https://kaktuskontainer.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Asweet-something/SUGARMICE width=\"400px\"]] \n\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]###FF78BB|__MiteMice__##[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size large]]These guys are my babies. I am SO proud of them! Aren't they adorable? I know, almost too cute to eat. But trust me, you'll want to. Now over here at my sweet shop, I'm all about healthy living. I cook for my husband a lot, and it's always a lot of food. I get worried about weight, so I know others must as well. But these little honeys are the perfect dessert after a large meal. They'll scavenge around and pick up the fat from any recent meal so you don't gain it. I've personally had seventeen of these things. So I can eat all I want without having to worry about gaining weight. My husband LOVES these things. He's never tried them, but it's his favorite thing of mine that I've made.[[/size]]\n\n[[=]]\n✧༝┉┉┉┉┉˚*❋ ❋ ❋*˚┉┉┉┉┉༝✧\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size large]]Alrighty! That's all I'll be sharing with you for today.

I remember when you made these for us a bit back when you were still testing out your recipes. I was feeling really down, so I had a few of these cause KeeLee I think??? suggested it. Aaron LOVES them. He's probably been begging you to death for these things since Valentine's Day is coming up soon. Those purple blotches on my skin FINALLY started to clear up.
