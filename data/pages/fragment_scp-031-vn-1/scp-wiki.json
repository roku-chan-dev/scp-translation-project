As there is no behavioural or cognitive changes, and the number of affected personnel at Site-75-VN is too large, containment are not required for all SCP-031-VN-C instances. \n\n Finding the route of transmission of SCP-031-VN-B is given Priority level-Rho.\n\n**Description:** SCP-031-VN is the collective designation for 3 anomalies: SCP-031-VN-A, SCP-031-VN-B, and SCP-031-VN-C.\n\nSCP-031-VN-A refers to the sudden appearance of documents related to “Unreality” and “Department of Unreality” in the database and archives of Site-075-VN, despite there being no such department or research field within the Foundation and Site-75-VN. The aforementioned documents oftens lack basic details and/or make use of placeholder names.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"□ Open example of an SCP-031-VN-A instance □\" hide=\"▣ Close ▣\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **DEPARTMENT OF UNREALITY**\n[[/=]]\n\n= **Report on Anomalous Phenomenon**\n\n**Event Code:** ABCDEF-123456\n\n**Reporting Personnel:** [Enter Name]\n\n**Event Description:** A [Phenomenon] occurred.

The mechanism of SCP-031-VN-B’s influence is still unknown; Reports from the Parainformation Division indicate that SCP-031-VN-B does not possess antimemetic properties. Currently, there are up to 64 personnel who are SCP-031-VN-C instances\n\nAlthough each explanation given by an SCP-031-VN-C falls into 3 main groups (See **Addendum 031.VN.1** for more details), they all generally all revolves around the concept of absence or emptiness. Apart from the aforementioned phenomenon, all SCP-031-VN-C instances show no behavioural or cognitive changes and are considered fit to continue their work.\n\n**Addendum 031.VN.1:** Interview\n\nBelow are interview transcripts representing each category of explanation regarding SCP-031-VN-B.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"□ Open Explanation 031-VN-CAUSALITY □\" hide=\"▣ Close ▣\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **INTERVIEW LOG**\n\n\n**Interview Date:** 25/6/2024\n\n**Interviewed:** Agent Nguyễn Minh Tâm, MTF Alpha-101 (\"Grammar Police\")\n\n**Interviewer:** Director Nguyễn Thuỳ Trang of the Parainformation Division\n\n**Preface:**  Agt. Tâm was one of the first SCP-031-VN-C cases to be interviewed. At that time, SCP-031-VN-C instances were still put under containment.\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n= <//unrelated contents truncated//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Alright, let’s begin. The sooner, the better.\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Ah yes, I’ve forgotten I’m in containment.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** First, why do you think you understand Unreality?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Huh? What kind of question is that?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** You did say you understand Unreality, didn’t you??\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Well that’s right but… I don’t even understand your question, let alone answer it!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Hm, Unreality is something with no definition within the Foundation. Then why do you, an agent, think you understand it?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** That’s just for you and the Foundation, but for me, Unreality is like knowing how to eat or sleep. Something so fundamental that I can’t believe I’m only now aware of it.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Right, but why?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Not that kind of question again! How should I answer your question? Can you forget to eat or drink?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Actually… yes…\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** <//sighs//>  I don’t know how to answer other than “it’s too basic”. It's like only those who know it can understand it. How can you explain explain that the sky is blue and wood is brown to someone born blind?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Alright, I understand, moving on to the main question. Can you explain Unreality?\n\n= <//Agt. Tâm sits upright//>\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Excellent, it’s finally time! I stayed all night just to think of an explanation!\n\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I hope it’s not too complicated.\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** <//chuckle//> Come on! You’re the chief, how can there be something you can’t comprehend?? Anyways. <//Tâm clears her throat//> To comprehend Unreality, you first need to understand causality.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Really?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** I’m not joking. You know its definition, right?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Causality is a series of events linked by a cause-effect relationship: One thing or event contribute to the formation of another thing or event, and that, in turn, contributes to the creation of something else.\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** That’s correct. When we bite into a bagel, the fact that only half of it remains is the effect, and the bite is the cause!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Okay, so what role does unreality play? Is it related to time travelling?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** No, nope. No time travel involved. Unreality is the disappearance of the cause.\n\n= <//silence on the recording//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** The cause disappears, or is missing in the first place.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But how can an effect exist without a cause!\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Have you forgotten who we work for??\n\n**Dir. Trang:** This is impossible logic-wise! Even if-\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Why do you think I am aware of these things?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Or why did those documents appear? Logically, someone must have explained them to me. //Logically//, someone must have placed those documents into the archives or uploaded them into the database. But no, no one did. They just appeared, as if it was a given thing.\n\n**Dir. Trang:**  Every… every anomaly, no matter how illogical, must operate by its own logic.\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Then what do you think this is, if not how Unreality works? Unreality is a cat appearing out of nowhere, Unreality are rooms appearing without purpose, Unreality is when you bite into a bagel but it remains intact! Unreality is-\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Alright! Alright. <//sighs//> Okay, I get it. But what is it with the last example? Isn’t the point supposed to be not biting but half of it is still missing?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** <//smiles//> What is the cause and what is the effect depends on the thing we’re talking about, as well as our point of view. In this case, the disappearance of the cause also took the effect with it, despite the cause has already been executed.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I don’t quite understand. What do you even mean? \n\n**Agt. Tâm:**  Some effects exist independent of causes, but some don’t happen because the causes were never executed.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//rubs her temple//> This sounds like a mess!\n\n**Agt. Tâm:**  Correct!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** So… what about the effect? Can it also disappear?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Like I have said, whether something is the cause or the effect depends on what is being discussed.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** So basically… everything?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** You are correct again!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** God… okay.\n\n= <//A bagel has always been there.//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Second question… Is unreality an- Huh, what’s that? When did that bagel get here?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** A good question, too shallow however. <//picks the bagel up//> Now it’s my turn for a question. Which one was erased, the cause of the bagel’s appearance, or its disappearance? You have 5 seconds.\n\n\n= <//Dir. Trang cannot answer in time.//>\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** The answer is fuck all. It’s all just speculation, according to the point of view. Where we stands doesn’t matter.\n\n<//Agt. Tâm bites into the bagel. It neither disappears nor exists.//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** When did you learn to speak so eloquently?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Is there a teacher more dedicated that oneself, is there a podium larger than this universe? <//chuckles//> Just kidding, it was actually because of the **[ LEVEL 5 TOP SECRET EXPUNGED]**. But its books remains so we are still slightly affected, it’s no big deal though. \n\n**Dir. Trang:** I made the diagnosis myself, you wouldn’t be sitting here if it was more severe.\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Yeah, you’re right.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Anyways, let’s get back to work. \n\n= <//A can of Pepsi manifested. Agt. Tâm opens the can and drinks its content. Dir. Trang stares at it.//>\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Come on, let’s not start a debate about which one tastes better. There’s hardly any difference between Coke and-\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I know, but… why is there a can of Pepsi here?\n\n **Agt. Tâm:** I’m thirsty.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What about the bagel then?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** I was hungry.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But how?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Unreality! Didn’t I just say that?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//sighs//> Okay, let’s move on to the second question. Is unreality a research field?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** I think it’s…hmn… more of a philosophical system.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Again… what? Why philosophy?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** No idea! You’re smarter than me, I’m sure you will figure it out!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** My… anyways, last question. What is the Department of Unreality?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** A department of the Foundation.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But are they real?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** No.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Then how can they influence baseline reality?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Through Unreality of course!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What goals do they have?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Who knows.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Are they on our side?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** Depends on who you ask.\n\n**Dir. Trang:**   What if I asked you?\n\n**Agt. Tâm:** My answer would be neutral.\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n \n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"□ Open Explanation 031-VN-VIBE □\" hide=\"▣ Close ▣\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INTERVIEW LOG**\n\n**Interview Date:** 17/08/2024\n\n**Interviewed:** Hoàng Văn Minh, Janitor\n\n**Interviewer:** Director Nguyễn Thuỳ Trang of the Parainformation Division\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I’m sorry for dragging you into this. Being affected by SCP-031-VN-B is not your fault at all, we are still trying to find the exact transmission route.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** It’s alright, sometimes, having something different from the usual routine is interesting. I just hope that it’s not too… something. It won’t be fatal, right?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Definitely not. Almost everyone has returned to their shifts.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Ah, that's fortunate. Now I’m just worried about how can a janitor help you all.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I actually need an outsider’s perspective. It may give us new clues.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** You do have a point.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Let’s start then. Can you try your best to explain Unreality according to your understanding?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** How should I put it? How should I put it?\n\n= <//silence on the recording//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Sir?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** I don’t know.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** W-what? But you said you knew!\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** I said I understand it, not I can explain it. Sorry, it’s just too fundamental.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Okay. Hmmm… Maybe try starting from the beginning?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** There is no beginning to start with!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Then just tell me what you know about Unreality.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Let’s see… do you know that feeling when you see something similar, as if you have seen it before, but it is actually your first time seeing it?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** It’s called Déjà vu.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Right. Now imagine the opposite. \n\n**Dir. Trang:** Something you’ve seen several times but suddenly seems unfamiliar. That’s called Jamais vu\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** No.\n\n= <//Silence//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What do you mean by “no”?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** I don't really know.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Can you please elaborate further?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** ell it’s like… let’s see. It’s like both these de-ja and ja-mey things combined.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What do you mean?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** It just… disappears! Very strange, isn’t it?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** No-actually yes, but what disappeared?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** I don’t know. Something?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Please be… clearer…\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** The thing that disappeared is something both familiar, but also isn’t.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** My god, what exactly is this thing?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** An explanation.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Huh?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** The unfamiliar but also familiar thing that disappeared: it’s an explanation. Without an explanation, anything can happen.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Sir, what you just said is not an explanation at all…\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Well it is something at least!\n\n**Dir. Trang:** No, no, no! That can’t be!\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Didn’t you say you needed a new perspective?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But not a meaningless one!\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Then why do you think you can distinguish between an anomalous phenomenon and an Unreal phenomenon?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Who told you…\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Nothing, right? In the absence of an explanation, feeling is the only thing we can rely on.\n\n= <//silence on the recording.//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Your demeanour changed significantly just now.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Only in this moment. Now answer my question.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** You’re dodging the question.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** You’re the one dodging the question.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But you just answered it yourself!\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** It’s only the feeling, isn’t it?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** No- what are you talking about?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Do you have any proof to prove otherwise? Look outside the window.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** There is no wind-\n\n= <//There is a window//.>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What in the actual fuck?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** What do you see?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** That the first explanation is easier to agree with.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Because it’s illogical?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Because it seems like a real explanation.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** My explanation is more comprehensive however.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//shouting//> It’s not an explanation at all!\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** What were you expecting?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Something more normal…\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Once again, sorry.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** We’re going in circles. Let’s drop this.\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** It’s up to you.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Moving on to the second question. Is unreality a research field?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Vietnamese doesn’t seem to have that word…\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What word?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** It’s like an atmosphere, but specific to a person. <//snaps fingers//> Right, vibe! \n\n**Dir. Trang:** Vibe?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Yes!\n\n= <//Both look outside the window, the outside is engulfed in the colour appears only in the back of your eyelids.//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//blinks slowly//> Forget it. Time for the third question. What is the Department of Unreality?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** Something familiar, something unfamiliar. “Department” and “Unreality”.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** That’s it?\n\n= <//Hoàng Văn Minh does not nod.//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Alright… last question. Are they on our side?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** The human immune system doesn’t know that the eyes exist, and it will attack them if it knows. Is the immune system on the same side as its body?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** So, the Department of Unreality is the immune system in this example?\n\n**Hoàng Văn Minh:** No, it’s the Parainformation Division.\n\n= <<//Unrelated contents truncated.//>>\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n \n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"□ Open Explanation 031-VN-MANIFEST □\" hide=\"▣ Close ▣\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INTERVIEW LOG**\n\n**Interview Date:** 24/10/2024\n\n**Interviewed:** Director Steve Nguyễn of the Spiritual Division\n\n**Interviewer:** Director Nguyễn Thuỳ Trang of the Parainformation Division\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n**Dir. Trang:**  It’s hard to believe that… even you were infected-\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Personally, I wouldn’t use the word “infected”.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Right, right, I’m aware it depends on one’s perspective. //But// from my perspective, you were infected with one of the most transmissible anomalies in the Vietnamese Branch! No research, or interview yielded any clue! And I-\n\n**Dir. Steve:** We should start.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Yes, you’re right. Pardon me, lately things have been… anyways. First, please define “Unreality”.\n\n**Dir. Steve:** I have read all interview logs, both before and after I //understood//.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Is that how you refer to an SCP-031-VN-B infection?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Indeed. I know you have heard this quite a few times already, but it seems like everyone else is not… exactly wrong…\n\n= <//Dir. Trang becomes more attentive//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** No, I haven’t! You are saying there are other explanations?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Of course, but as I said, other explanations aren’t really wrong.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Are you confident in this answer?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** No.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Then… what is this?!\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Another way to view it, and I advise that you view this issue from multiple perspectives.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But this is about reality and facts, how can we have a debate over them?!\n\n**Dir. Steve:** This may be the reason you still haven’t been able to understand it.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I don’t… forget it, please answer the question.\n\n**Dir. Steve:** What do you think Unreality is?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Is that a rhetorical question?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** No, I need a truthful answer from you\n\n= <//Dir. Trang falls silent for a long while//>\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Unreality is the absence of certain components in a process, object, or phenomenon, however those things still continue to exist despite the importance of the missing components.\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Why can’t it be the other way around?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Why do the missing components disappear, and why do remaining components stay?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Steve, please provide a clearer explanation-\n\n**Dir. Steve:** The missing components are not dragged into the void, because they never existed in the first place. Conversely, those that remain, were salvaged from the abyss. Everyone has been looking at it the wrong way, there is no disappearance, everything is created.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What is created?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** The effects are created, from non-existent causes.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Created from… where?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** <//leans forward//> Nothing.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//sighs//> You are correct, this is just another approach. What’s the difference between this and the first explanation?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** The problem of focusing on why causes are unreal is that we overlook its effects.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** But as you just said, why do we need to care about the causes, if they don’t exist?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** You can’t perceive them, can you? You cannot hear them.\n\n**Dir. Trang:**Them? What are they?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** The unreal causes, they speak out from the void, trying to insert their effects into reality.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I don’t understand…\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Reality and Unreality, are just two sides of a coin, two different existences. They are real to themselves as much as I am real to you and everyone else.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** In another dimension? Or a different reality?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Still don’t understand, do you? They called to you, and you heard them, I’m sure of that. But you brushed them aside, whether intentionally or unintentionally.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I tried, I really tried to understand!\n\n**Dir. Steve:** This is not just a matter of understanding, but also of listening. Unreality is like those who don’t exist but want to be. Listen to the whispers of the unreals, that’s the best advice I can give.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Then… what are they saying, in those whispers?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** They don’t speak in words, but in results. All the memories, the papers, the documents appearing from nothingness, are all their messages. That is also how we could understand. You were the first one they reached out to, when their influence was still limited to those three simple words “Department of Unreality” on a piece of paper. But after that day, their influence expanded, onto other documents, memories, records, and now they are even sending their own documents and files, what you call 031-VN-A. It all started with you.\n\n= <//silence on the recording.//>\n\n**Dir. Steve:** I apologize, perhaps you cannot listen to them for a reason.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I’m not even sure if this is a curse or a blessing.\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Most likely a curse…\n\n**Dir. Trang:** <//clears her throat//> Let’s continue. Do you think Unreality is a research field?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Unreality is a state of being, as its name implies.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** What about those things affecting dimensions that you mentioned?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** That’s within the scope of the Department of Unreality.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I was going to ask that next. What is the Department of Unreality?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** A threshold between reality and unreality.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** And its duty is to connect the two?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** You could say that.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Alright. Are they on our side?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Completely on our side.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Considering the mess they have caused me?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Have you seen the movie “Dunkirk”?\n\n**Dir. Trang:** I haven’t, why you ask?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** It’s a war movie, detailing the evacuation of Allies soldier out of Dunkirk before the barrage of enemy bombs. In one scene, a few enemy planes managed to reach the evacuating soldiers, and killed many of them. Some soldiers felt betrayed by the defensive force for letting the enemies slip through, not knowing that the same defensive force was stopping hundreds of other planes. Those soldiers would have been killed long ago without them.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** You think the Department is the defensive force, I’m the oblivious soldier, and this whole thing was the enemy planes slipping through?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** Not really, that would imply they are not a part of this ordeal, and is also why I don’t consider this a “problem”.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Can you elaborate?\n\n**Dir. Steve:** From one director of Site-75-VN to another, I advise you to stop the research. It hasn’t, and won’t yield any result. It can even impede the progress of the Department of Unreality, no matter how low the chance of that happening.\n\n**Dir. Trang:** Excuse me, but the Foundation never gives up on solving a problem.\n\n**Dir. Steve:** It won’t be a problem if you don’t try to make it one.\n\n**Dir.
