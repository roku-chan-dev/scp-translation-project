Otherwise, is completely unremarkable, except for the fact that she's visibly an immense nerd about the Foundation across different timelines.\n\nShe is very pleased that you decided to consult this page and would like to show you what she did.\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Solo Stuff]]\n* **[[[him-and-the-other-him|Him and the Other Him]]]**\n\n//Did you knew that the CaRenCon was already 3 years ago? Time is slipping away so fast... anyway, it was part of the \"Old Foes\" storyline, it introduced 093 into the storyline (tho, it had a minor role, at the end. Maybe. I'll probably reread it because my memory is blurry about that) and I originally wanted to make it longer. And then, I ran out of ideas and went into the Discord me, Harry, notgull & Spider set up, I told them \"GUYS YOU NEED TO HELP ME BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SLOW Y'ALL DOWN\" and everyone was like \"Well, actually, this is good as it is, just need some tweaking but yeah, this is good\". It's almost at +80 and I still think it's good.//\n\n* **[[[toi-et-personne-d-autre|You and Nobody Else]]]**\n\n//So, if you don't know, I'm more able to release stuff when I do contests or the Art Exchange. I couldn't tell you why, but that's the truth. This one is a translation of a Tale I did on SCP-FR, months ago, for a Valentine's Day contest which goal was to write love letters from the perspective to someone from a GoI, adressed to someone from another GoI. It led to a lot of amusing ships. Mine was Dr Wondertainment writing a letter to Nobody. This is the Tale I'm the most proud of on -FR and, ngl, I'm bummed by the fact not a lot of people have read it.//\n\n* **[[[i-died-for-your-everyone-pings|Thou Shalt Not Protest When Thou Take the \"L\"]]]**\n\n//What did I said about me being more able to release things during events? Anyway. This is my Art Exchange 2023 thing and was made for AwhRyan. Their [[[SCP-7678]]] immediately caught my attention and I thought \"OK, so he tries to use Internet and announces loudly that he's back and it doesn't work. What if he was using other methods? What if he discovered anomalous social media?\". After that, I just had to let my imagination do the rest for the dialogues. Short, but silly. Plus, Ryan loved it, so heh. Plus, it's Jesus trying to be as self-serious as he can only to reveal how awkward he reads when he uses the Internet (and he has a personal diary).//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Co-authored Stuff]]\n* **[[[scenes-from-a-comprehensive-clusterfuck|Scenes from a Comprehensive Clusterfuck]]]** (with [[*user The_Spider_Queen]], [[*user notgull]] & [[*user HarryBlank]])\n\n//I wrote the scenes involving Vang (who, here, didn't fled the Foundation, unlike the main Res timeline, during the time the stories with him were fully considered canon), the CI agents fighting against the appleseeds, Edison, and Clef & Adams making a bet. It went like a breeze and we all had a lot of fun doing it. I think you can see it when you read it.//\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Translations]]\n**So, if you know me or have ever talked to me for more than 20 minutes, you know I'm a foreigner and I'm also a member of SCP-FR. As such, I've translated a bunch of things for the Branch. Here they are, by categories. I haven't took this from AlanDaris' page, not at all.**\n\n++ SCPs\n\n++++ Mainlist\n\n//None yet!//\n\n++++ Other\n\n* [[[SCP-8851-J]]]\n\n++ Stand-alone Tales\n\n* [[[gamers-against-weed-dossier|Gamers Against Weed Dossier]]]\n* [[[clef-dies|Clef Dies]]][[footnote]] In hindsight, this might have been an ill-conceived move. Oh, well. [[/footnote]]\n* [[[the-tombstone-of-alto-clef|The Tombstone of Alto Clef]]][[footnote]] Probably the Tale I loved translating the most. Kirby is very good at taking classic SCP-verse characters and making them like they're your next-door neighbors.

I think this alone gives you a reason of why I haven't posted a link to it. For the rest, I won't say anything more. [[/footnote]]\n* [[[robin|Robin]]][[footnote]] Nico, if you read this, I swear that one day, I'll do my own Tale about Jay and it will be way better than what I did for AE2019 (or was it 2020?).

The non-Tale article I had the most fun with, when it comes to translation.

Also, a little confidence: I translated it when it was the version with all the bits of commentary and I never wanted to change it when Ihp did a big update, just because I didn't want the commentary to go to waste. Now that it's kinda gone, I won't have to change it. Thanks for saving me the trouble, lol. [[/footnote]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Headcanons & lore tidbits galore]]\nHere, I'll put some headcanons & bits of lore, both serious and silly, for y'all to see, whether it's headcanons I myself have or headcanons by others that I consider cool. So, you don't waste your time entirely by being here. Also, others did it and it's kind of rad. This tab is, by its nature, susceptible to be updated when I feel like it.\n\n* **The SCP Wiki is also a collaborative project in-universe**\n\nThis one is one that several other people have and that I've always shared, it's that the Wiki as we know it is, in-universe, all the existing iterations of the Foundation coming together and compiling the contents of their respective databases. It makes just a lot of sense (especially when you know about things like the 1981 Multi-Foundation Coalition Agreement, from //Metafoundation//).\n\n* **Gears can't sing**\n\nEvery time he tries to sing, he actually does spoken word, completely out of rhythm. Now, imagine any song except the lyrics are said by a white, bald dude in his forties and it sounds like a presidential speech.\n\n* **Tilda Moose is actually an anthropomorphic moose**\n\nShe uses her reality-bending abilities to appear as a human. If you ever saw her as a human, it's just a big lie.\n\n* **The universe of //lolFoundation// is so chaotic that all their stated origins are true in an extent**\n\nAs of now, I found three different origins for how this setting came to be: either it's the Fritz guy who fucked up everything (as seen in the hub), either it's the entities from the //End of Olympians// series after they overthrew the O5 (as seen in the O5 Dossier), either it's the //ADMONITION// Foundation who created it by accident after the attempt at bringing back Dr. King was unsuccessful (as seen in 6747). But since this universe is so far removed from logic, let's go a step further and say that maybe it's a little bit of the three and no one can really remember.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Author Will]]\nIn the case I find myself permanently banned, absent from the Wiki for over 2 years or dead, I give to my CaRenCon teammates control over everything I did for \"Old Foes\" (which is almost all of my articles, lol).\n\nSince I don't have a lot of articles, this will is very short but it's susceptible to change in the future.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Blank part for you to vandalize]]\n\"'A pig? PIGHEAD THE PIG!' a quote by Dr. Doofensmirtz\" -[[*user IHearVoices]]\nadd message here, lol.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\nand that's all i wrote.\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=The Pighead]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
