The number of SCP-3741 instances in containment should not exceed fifty at any time. As such, surplus instances are to be incinerated. \n\nShould any wild instances be discovered, MTF Sigma-13 (\"Food Fighters\") will be deployed to recover them and return to Site-77. As such, MTF Sigma-13 agents embedded in various national food safety regulatory bodies[[footnote]]Specifically, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA), and the French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Safety (ANSES).[[/footnote]] will routinely visit oyster farms under their jurisdiction that are known to raise eastern oysters (//Crassostrea virginica//) and are to confiscate any instances of SCP-3741 that they find.\n\nUnder no circumstances should an instance of SCP-3741 be ingested. Should an instance be consumed, all responsible individuals are to be detained, interrogated, and amnesticized.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3741 is a phenomenon that is currently exhibited by 29 eastern oysters, but may extend to a small quantity of wild oysters. Instances can be differentiated from non-anomalous oysters due to a variety of biological traits, including functional immortality[[footnote]]Instances are capable of dying, but, assuming they have access to sufficient nutrients, will not die of age[[/footnote]], dull pink meat, and physically identical dark shells. Despite demonstrating the inability to age, SCP-3741 instances are capable of sexual reproduction, and are hermaphroditic like non-anomalous eastern oysters, but can only reproduce with other instances of SCP-3741.\n\nIn addition to biological deviations from non-anomalous eastern oysters, instances of SCP-3741 are known to induce a memetic effect when consumed by a subject, hereafter designated as SCP-3741-A. Upon ingestion, SCP-3741-A will become immediately aware of an acquisition of extensive knowledge on a specific topic. The nature of this knowledge varies between instances, but is always related to the desires of the SCP-3741-A instance. See Addendum 3741-B for more information.\n\n**Addendum 3741-A:** Discovery\nSCP-3741 was discovered after Foundation agents embedded in the FDA were notified of an abnormal bloom of oysters at The Spat Shuckster's Oyster Farm in Kennebunkport, Maine. In response, the agents visited the farm and confiscated the oysters, logging them as an Anomalous Object under the designation AO-697837. During routine testing, the secondary anomalous properties were discovered, thus warranting an upgrade to SCP-3741.\n\n**Addendum 3741-B:** Test Log\nThe following is an abridged list of tests involving SCP-3741.\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 1200px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\n\nTest 3741-1\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nSubject\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-2452, one instance of --AO-697837-- SCP-3741\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nExperiment\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-2452 instructed to open and consume the instance.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nResults\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-2452 opened and consumed the instance of --AO-697837-- SCP-3741, despite initial resistance due to the pink color of the flesh.
