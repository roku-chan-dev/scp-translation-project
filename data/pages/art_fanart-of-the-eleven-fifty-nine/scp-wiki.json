Well, actually, I don't know if 'fanart' is the right term for art based on true stories, but it is 'art' by a 'fan', right? \n\nSemantics aside, one of my many jobs is being an illustrator for a local Library, so I make illustrations based on stories all the time. A friend of a friend of mine showed me this story - [[[the-eleven-fifty-nine |The Eleven Fifty-Nine]]] - and I thought 'hey! One of my nightshift coworker is a train conductor! I'm on trains all the time! I should draw this one and show it to him!' So that's exactly what I did! But I thought it might also be cool to post it here and share it with you all too.\n\nI hope you all enjoy! I think I'll poke around and maybe illustrate some more stuff from y'all's posts in the future, if y'all don't mind!\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** KROFRtW.mp4\n> **Author:** [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/KROFRtW Imgur]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
