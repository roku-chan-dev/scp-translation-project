[[/footnote]]\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/Tectonic_plates_and_ring_of_fire.png/800px-Tectonic_plates_and_ring_of_fire.png?20180715175332 |caption= A diagram of Earth's tectonic plate, marked with locations of volcanoes. Highlighted in red is the area effected by SCP-8007. |width=500px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThese instances are sapient draconic entities[[footnote]] Referred to as “Those Below the Flames”. [[/footnote]] that have adapted to live within the chambers of the active volcanoes along the Ring of Fire. The anomalies are responsible for all geological activity along the subduction zones of the Pacific Tectonic Plate and surrounding tectonics. SCP-8007-1-447 feed off of a newly discovered anomalous generation of intense thermal energy that is being produced underneath the Pacific Tectonic Plate. This generation of energy is referred to as SCP-8007-α, as it is believed to be created by a secondary entity.[[footnote]]As found in Exploration Log 8007.1 [[/footnote]] Analysis of the area has indicated that SCP-8007-α is a draconic entity possessing an indeterminate number of entangled limbs and heads. However, it appears to display a form of radial symmetry. The entity spans underneath the entirety of the Pacific Tectonic Plate, roughly 410 kilometers below the surface.\n\nThe SCP-8007 instances have been operating under a self-imposed duty of ensuring that SCP-8007-α remains contained underneath of the Pacific Tectonic Plate for an estimation of 3.8 billion years. This is done via the draining, consumption and excess venting of SCP-8007-α's energy output in the form of geological activity. \n\nIt is believed that if the SCP-8007 instances were to fail in the draining/venting of this energy, the resulting buildup would result in the detonation of the Pacific Tectonic Plate and lead to a WK-Class Mass Extinction Event.[[footnote]] Subcategorized as a WK-Class Reign of Fire Scenario. [[/footnote]] \n\nSCP-8007-β is the assigned designation to a subset of entities created by SCP-8007-α. These anomalies are thaumaturgical constructs resembling serpents made of fire. The only physical parts of these constructs are a circular disk of magnetite, ranging from 5 to 10 meters in diameter, that make up the beings 'head'. SCP-8007-β utilize these disks to seek out and attack instances of SCP-8007 via magnetism -- specifically, the iron-rich hearts and arteries. \n\nThe discovery that instances of SCP-8007 were being killed[[footnote]] Five in total have been lost [[/footnote]] due to retaliation taken by SCP-8007-α via -β, and the threat this posed, has since resulted in the creation of the Foundation's Pyroclasm Protocol.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ THE PYROCLASM PROTOCOL\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/MoJuEft.png]]\n+++ May We Rise Up to Their Call\n----\n++++ **Overview**\n\nThe Pyroclasm Protocol is a two-part Foundation mandated action taken in-joint with Those Below the Flames to ensure the prevention of a WK-Class Mass Extinction Event. The following details the steps carried out by the Foundation to maintain the protocol, and the safety of the world at large. \n\n++++ **Execution**\n\n+++++ **Part 1**\nSite-8007.1, 8007.2, 8007.3, 8007.4 and 8007.5 are five sites constructed and maintained under the Pyroclasm Protocol, with joint command from the Geology Department and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-120 Site-120]. They are built within the hollow remains of the deceased instances within Mount St. Helens, Plosky Tolbachik, Ostry Tolbachik, Mount Agung and Galeras. \n\nThe area designated ‘Sector A’ of these sites hold a central reactor that consists of the reactivated heart of the deceased 8007 instance. The heart is encapsulated within a series of tungsten[[footnote]] Harvested from bones within the instance [[/footnote]] walls, suspended within the magma chamber that formed upon the heart's revival. Piping has been constructed around the original suspension arteries of the heart, and are used to pipe magma to the Primary Chamber. The circular platform roughly 100 meters in diameter, located above the Central Reactor Heart, is to be utilized for access to the heart through a central hole. It also provides access to artery piping, and other sectors of the site. This central platform is secured to the instance's rib cage through welded suspension cables, and several constructed support pillars.\n\nThe Primary Chamber is located at Sector B, within the upper chest of the instance. The artery pipes run upwards and into the back protrusions in order to supply them with magma. To slow the process of filling the protrusions, the Primary Chamber contains six holding tanks connected to the artery pipes. \n\nUtilizing the instances side vents, volcanic gas and water vapor from within the holding tanks is forced through a series of turbines constructed inside. The energy harvested from this process is to be used to power the site and its backup generator. Excess power is rerouted to other Foundation facilities. \n\nSector C contains staff housing for roughly 600 individuals, as well as cafeterias, and three small research sectors. Bi-monthly shipments of living supplies are to be distributed to the sites containing both necessities and occasional amenities upon request. Sector C also contains the evacuation site, and Eruption Event shelters.\n\nStaffing of these sites is to chiefly be done by the Geology Department; including maintenance staff, technicians, and janitorial. Transferring of staff from other sites to fill gaps in Site-8007.1-.5 may occur. \n\nFour thaumaturgical ritual circles are specifically constructed in the following locations: The Central Reactor Heart, Primary Chamber, Research Sector 1, and Sector D. These sites are to be used to maintain the heat protective wards utilized in the protection of staff and the site’s structures from extreme heat and toxic gasses. If monitored temperatures within the site start to fluctuate, [[footnote]] Outside of Eruption Events [[/footnote]] or any respiratory distress is reported, a state of emergency is to be declared, and all personnel are to evacuate. \n\nThe Everlasting Ritual is utilized for the revitalizing of an instance’s heart, and requires the following:\n* The solid heart is to be uncovered, and remain suspended in the air by its arteries. In the area below the heart, a tunnel of any width is to be dug into the volcano's magma chamber.\n* 4 sulfur idols, carved like a dragon's fang, are to be placed around the heart in the four cardinal directions. \n* An ultramafic[[footnote]] An igneous rock characterized by a very low silica content, and a high concentration of iron and magnesium [[/footnote]] rock sample is to be crushed into powder, and this powder is to be poured in a way that connects all 4 idols. \n* Carved inscriptions of the name of the corresponding deceased instance.[[footnote]] Endless Eons, Billowing Smoke (St. Helens), Wings of Fire, Flying Far Away (Plosky Tolbachik), Erupt to the Horizon, Cavern of Teeth (Ostry Tolbachik), Ashen Sky, Fall of Glowing Embers (Agung), Distant Roar, Bones of Stone (Galeras). [[/footnote]]\n* Lifeblood Tear of SCP-8007-1[[footnote]] See Below: Archived Recording 8007.1 [[/footnote]] to be poured onto the heart.\nOnce all is undergone, a surge of fire-based thaumaturgical energy is required to jumpstart the ritual. \n\nTransferred mages from Site-120 are to maintain protective wards daily, and renew the Everlasting Ritual on a bi-weekly basis at the Central Reactor Heart via replacement of the sulfur idols and ultramafic dust. In the event that a reactor fully shuts down and leaves its molten state, the original reactivation ritual is to be undergone as soon as possible.\n\nLevels of thermal energy and magma within the dorsal structures are to be monitored, and early warnings are to be distributed to the areas surrounding the sites at least one to two days prior to the execution of a Foundation controlled volcanic eruption. \n\nActivation of an Eruption Event must be approved by site command. \n\nDuring an eruption event, the site is to undergo lockdown. All individuals onsite are to shelter in Sector D for the duration of the eruption to ensure safety of staff.  \n\n+++++ **Part 2**\n\nA series of outposts have been constructed along locations of the Ring of Fire. These outposts are unmanned, and utilize a highly compressed and concentrated iron core buried just below within a small chamber. These cores function as lures for instances of SCP-8007-β, and as a disposal for the constructs.\n\nWhen an SCP-8007-β instance enters the chamber, their heat signature will cause the thaumaturgical wards within to activate. Upon activation, all oxygen within the space is removed. The sudden removal of all fuel will immediately terminate the instance. \n\nThese wards only require yearly renewal to ensure their function, and for the removal of -β instance’s heads. These disks are to be melted down and utilized elsewhere.\n\nSCP-8007-1, Standing Ceaseless, Protection of Everlasting Fire is to be deferred to yearly on the status of SCP-8007-α, and the condition of all other 8007 instances to ensure protective measures have remained successful. This is to be done through Dr. Mary Nerys and O5-5. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Archived Recording 8007.1**\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a recording of a return to Mount Mauna Loa conducted to establish communication with SCP-8007-1 about the Foundation’s intentions and acquirement of thaumaturgical aid.\n\nTo demonstrate good will, and a desire to hold true to the promise of aid, Dr. Gibbs, Dr. Nerys, O5-4, and O5-5 partake in the creation of a ritualistic pact with SCP-8007-1 as part of the Pyroclasm Protocol.\n\n----\n\n//Dr. Gibbs and Dr. Nerys stand at the entrance to the Mauna Loa tunnel. The two of them are dressed in fire proximity suits.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** You ready? I don’t think I’m ready. Like… holy shit.\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Can’t tell if I’m more worried about the 100 kilometer long dragon below our feet or two O5s who are going to be standing right next to us.\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** //[She gives a nervous smile]// I can at least vouch that the dragon is quite nice. \n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://i.imgur.com/Ifbav3a.png |caption= O5-4, circa 1904 |width=200px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://i.imgur.com/KeU304B.png |caption= O5-5, circa 1938|width=200px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n//The sounds of a helicopters blades grows audible, and Dr. Gibbs straightens her back. Dr. Nerys jumps and jerks her head up.//\n\n//When it touches down, two individuals exit.//\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** O5-4, O5-5. It is a honor to make your acquaintance. \n\n**Dr. Nerys:** //[She makes a small hand gesture and smiles nervously]// Do I uh— bow? I admittedly am not entirely on track with etiquette. You don’t use that when you’re looking at rocks all day. //[She laughs.]//\n\n//Dr. Gibbs grimaces, but O5-4 gives an amused smile.//\n\n**O5-4:** Oh dear, no! That’s a tad archaic, don’t you think?\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Most likely, sir.\n\n**O5-5:** Greetings. You and your department have done impressive work with Pyroclasm.\n\n//Dr. Nerys smiles, and Dr. Gibbs ducks her head.//\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Thank you. We’ve discovered a lot in the past years.\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** And that almost feels like an understatement! \n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** I suppose so. \n\n**O5-5:** Are we prepared to descend?\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** The storage cache here has all the tools and protective gear that we will need. \n\n//Dr. Gibbs gestures to the metal storage box and the small tent it’s underneath.//\n\n//O5-4 takes a moment to equip a fire proximity suit and protective wards. O5-5 remains deliberately dressed in what she arrived in. Dr. Nerys stares at the woman for a few long moments before Dr. Gibbs nudges her, and she startles.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Ok! //[She claps her hands]// Looks like we’re ready. Let’s head down, yes?\n\n//O5-5 nods.//\n\n**O5-5:** Let us procced. \n\n//The group heads into the tunnel, and begins their descent into the magma chamber.//\n\n**O5-4:** Remember! You are to announce anything the anomaly tells you. Repeat it.[[footnote]]Due to this choice, a transcript of SCP-8007-1’s communication was not made post-recording, as it would be redundant. [[/footnote]]\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Will do sir.\n\n**O5-4:** That includes you too, Five. I don’t want to miss this.\n\n**O5-5:** Very well. Dr. Nerys, how does it communicate?\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Some sort of rudimentary telepathy I think? Really rudimentary, considering the whole ‘only thaumaturge users’ thing.\n\n//O5-5 nods.//\n\n**O5-4:** May I ask— what was SCP-8007-1’s name? \n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Dr. Nerys roughly interpreted her to be called ‘Standing Ceaseless, Protection of Everlasting Fire.’\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** It’s… damn hard to determine exacts when you’re getting images and emotions shoved into your brain, but I did the best I could.\n\n**O5-4:** Fascinating! Quite a long name she—? \n\n//Dr. Nerys nods, he smiles.//\n\n**O5-4:** —She has. Has it been considered that the other instances are possibly named in similar fashions?\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** If the opportunity to access another 8007 instance is ever found, it’s definitely something to investigate! Right now they’re just dictated by number and the volcano they’re under. \n\n**O5-4:** We could ask Everlasting Fire the names of the fallen when an opportunity arises, out of respect, perhaps. \n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** That sounds like a wonderful idea, sir.\n\n//The 2 hour travel period to reach the chamber housing SCP-8007-1 occurs without interruption. During the timeframe, O5-4 occasionally asks further questions pertaining to SCP-8007 to Dr. Gibbs and Dr. Nerys. O5-5 remains silent, but on few occasions raises a hand to brush the wall of the corridors.// \n\n//The group emerges into the chamber of SCP-8007-1. It appears in the same state it was in during the previous exploration, including previous damages. The two pillars stretch up to the ceiling. All the carvings depictions remain consistent.//\n\n//SCP-8007-1’s head currently rests partially submerged in the magma. When the group makes themselves known, she rises. Magma drips from crevices along her head and neck, causing fiery light to glitter along the obsidian that forms her horns and the surrounding deposits.//\n\n//O5-4 turns in a tight circle, eyes going from SCP-8007-1 to the carvings that line the walls, then back to SCP-8007-1. He chuckles, a restrained but excited look upon his face.//\n\n**O5-4:** …the report does not do this justice. It’s beautiful. \n\n//Dr. Gibbs stares at SCP-8007-1, motionless for a moment before audibly exhaling.//\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** It sure is.\n\n//Dr. Nerys approaches the edge of the outcropping, O5-5 walking next to her. The two stare up at SCP-8007-1. The dragon’s head looms above them, tilted slightly to the side. A low scrapping sound and a rumble shake the cave. Dr. Nerys jumps, and O5-5 reaches a hand to her temple.//\n\n**O5-5:** Oh… hello.\n\n**O5-4:** What was that?\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** A greeting, I think. //[She chuckles]// Good to see she's gotten a better hand on volume.\n\n//Dr. Nerys then looks back to SCP-8007-1, and bows deeply. O5-5 watches her briefly, before following suit. O5-4 and Dr. Gibbs do as well.// \n\n**O5-4:** //[He straightens]// Standing Ceaseless, Protection of Everlasting Fire. It is of… great, //great// honor to stand here before you.\n\n//SCP-8007-1 tilts her head further, the sound of cracking and crumbling rock is heard. O5-4 looks to the two at the outcropping’s edge.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Inquiring. Curiosity. I think she wants to know why you’re here.\n\n**O5-4:** I am O5–4. You… are likely already acquainted with Dr. Nerys, perhaps even Dr. Gibbs. \n\n**O5-5:** And I am O5-5. We are two of twelve[[footnote]] At the time of this recording, there were only twelve overseers left [[/footnote]], leaders of the Foundation. We were brought here by Dr. Gibbs and Dr. Nerys to discuss in aiding you, your kind.\n\n//SCP-8007-1 shakes out her head, a few shards of rock fall into the magma below and sizzle. A high noise, like a trill, echoes from the dragon’s maw. Dr. Nerys smiles.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Hope. Excitement. \n\n**O5-4:** Our previous team who met you— they’ve given us valuable information of your plight. We’ve devised a plan to help, but we’ve come to receive your blessing on it. To form a pact with you.\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** So you know you won’t be fighting alone.\n\n//SCP-8007-1 brings her head closer to the outcropping.//\n\n**O5-5:** We know of a way to keep away the constructs that have been harming you and the rest of your kind. Presently, order of construction is being undergone. If it works, they will no longer harm you.\n\n//A low rumble echoes across the cavern walls.//\n\n**O5-5:** However, there is a main reason we have come to speak to you. We seek your permission to revitalize the hearts of the five dragons who have fallen, so that the Foundation can carry out their duties for them. Postmortem.\n\n//SCP-8007-1 raises her head up, a low growl echoes from her flaming maw. The circle of horns around her head flare outwards, glittering like a sharp halo in the magma’s light.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** //[She speaks hurriedly]// Their bodies will not be destroyed. We will respect them, their hearts will remain where they are.\n\n//This seems to placate SCP-8007-1, her horns return to their prior state. The fire flickers out.//\n\n**O5-5:** Can you tell us the names of your fallen comrades?\n\n//SCP-8007-1 blinks, long and slow. The dragon seems to calm further. Her jaws part in a high trill.// \n\n//After a long moment, O5-5 nods.//[[footnote]] See: Step 4 of the Everlasting Ritual[[/footnote]]\n\n**O5-5:** We shall honor their names.\n\n//Dr. Gibbs, who had scrambled back, pauses and tilts her head. O5-4 straightens and watches.//\n\n//SCP-8007-1 brings her head back close to the outcropping, letting out a chittering sound— like grinding stones.// \n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Curiosity. Cupped hands holding shining stones— I think she wants to know if we want anything in return for our aid?\n\n**O5-5:** We have one request.\n\n//A low rumble.//\n\n**O5-5:** The ritual we need to aid you is… missing a vital component. To revive the hearts, we need something of a //living// ilk. \n\n//There is a long pause. SCP-8007-1 is silent for a time, seemingly considering the request. A series of rocks fall from her side. She chuffs, smoke puffing out from her jaws.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Running water. A slash on scales. Magma to lava. …Blood?\n\n//O5-5 nods after a moment of consideration.//\n\n**O5-5:** Lifeblood. If you are willing, Everlasting Fire. Anything of a living sort.\n\n**O5-4:** Do we… ah… have the means to carry something like that?\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Nerys, do you have the energy for some light geomancy?\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** On it boss, one moment. \n\n//Dr. Nerys steps away from the edge of the outcropping, and back over towards the tunnel. She crouches down and puts her hands against the ground. From the spot between her hands, the rock begins to bend and morph into something resembling a large jar or jug. Dr. Nerys exhales shakily, and pushes herself up.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Will this do?\n\n**O5-4:** Quite well! May I—? //[He gestures to the jar]//\n\n//Dr. Nerys nods and takes a step back.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Of course, sir.\n\n//O5-4 picks up the pot with a grunt, moving to stand by O5-5’s side at the edge of the outcropping. She nods to him, and looks up at SCP-8007-1.//\n\n//Dr. Nerys stands back and next to Dr. Gibbs.//\n\n//O5-4 walks to the very tip of the outcropping, and hoists the jar upwards.//\n\n//SCP-8007-1 turns her head to be parallel with the group, and brings her eye close. From its corner, a glowing orange light begins to condense. Like a tear, this droplet of fire falls from the eye. It trails down SCP-8007-1’s rocky face.//\n\n//O5-4 catches it within the stone jug. The substance within is a brilliant orange, with swirling motes of white and yellow and red within. Some flake off like embers, dancing in the air. The bright glow pulses like a heartbeat.// \n\n//SCP-8007-1 makes a noise akin a contented purr.//\n\n**O5-5:** Thank you, truly. What you have gifted us shall be the key of our aid to you all. \n\n//O5-4 backs away from the edge of the outcropping, bringing the jar with him. Using a piece of stone molded by Dr. Nerys, he seals it.//\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Does that mean we are now ready for the pact?\n\n**O5-4:** I believe so, Dr. Gibbs. //[He glances at O5-5]// Correct?\n\n//O5-5 nods.//\n\n**O5-5:** Follow my lead, Dr. Nerys. \n\n**Dr. Nerys:** Yes, ma’am.\n\n//Utilizing a set of thin blades, O5-5 and Dr. Nerys both begin carving a series of interconnected circles and sharp lines into the rocky ground. The large ritual site’s construction takes roughly 30 minutes, during which Dr. Gibbs engages O5-4 in a discussion on the local geology, Dr. Nerys occasionally chimes in on. O5-5 maintains a silent focus.//\n\n//SCP-8007-1 watches, her heartbeat causes a subtle tremor in the room each time it beats.//\n\n//The finished ritual circle’s design holds four triangular shapes jutting from cardinal directions — appearing like jagged rocks pointing inwards, with five overlapping circles along the center. Runic inscriptions line the sides of those circles.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** //[She turns and faces SCP-8007-1]// It is ready, Everlasting Fire. \n\n//SCP-8007-1 lets out a deep, reverberating rumble as she brings her head closer to the outcropping.//\n\n//Dr. Nerys furrows her brow.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** …a loved one's warmth, 8007 Alpha, a dragon with wings spread and a smaller one behind it? That’s a new set. //[She looks to O5-5]//\n\n//O5-5 chuckles faintly.//\n\n**O5-5:** Secure, Contain, Protect.\n\n**O5-4:** //[He smiles]// Oh, how quaint.\n\n//The dragon rumbles again. The very tip of the obsidian horn at the end of her snout pierces the rock at the center of the ritual circle.//\n\n**Dr. Gibbs:** Looks like she’s ready too. Do we—?\n\n//O5-5 gestures for the others to come closer. O5-4 gently places the pot containing the Lifeblood Tear on the ground a few meters away before he approaches. Dr. Gibbs stands next to Dr. Nerys.//\n\n//All four individuals lower themselves to their knees, placing a right hand each on one of the carved triangles.//\n\n//O5-5’s eyes light with a fiery glow.//\n\n//Orange light from O5-5’s fingers begins to leak and flow into the sigils, curling up the arms of the others in swirls and dancing patterns across SCP-8007-1’s snout. Etching glowing lines into all of them. The air thrums.//\n\n//SCP-8007-1 rumbles, a sound that vibrates the very stone that surrounds them all. The massive carvings and twin pillars of the outcropping begin to light up and pulse with a similar glow. The dragons carved on the walls almost seem to move, with the way that the shadows and firelight dances.//\n\n//At a small signal given by O5-5, all four individuals stand, and each extend their right hand outwards. There is a moment of silence as they close their eyes. SCP-8007-1 breaks the silence with a low purr, and the dragon gently moves her head so that the hands make contact with her snout. The sigils below them burn brighter-- pulsing once, then twice.//\n\n//At the ritual’s completion, SCP-8007-1 raises her head back and away from the outcropping. O5-4 takes some steps back to re-retrieve the jar.//\n\n//The glowing marks on O5-5’s arm remains.//[[footnote]] After the removal of the fire proximity suits, it was found the marks remained on Dr. Nerys, Dr. Gibbs and O5-4 as well. They are considered permanent effects of the pact.[[/footnote]] //SCP-8007-1’s snout is similarly still alight.// \n\n**O5-5:** The pact has been sealed. The Foundation shall maintain their part in aiding in your ancient duty for as long as we stand. You shall not stand ceaseless alone.\n\n//SCP-8007-1 rumbles, low and deep and long. The dragon’s massive back spine grind against each other.//\n\n**Dr. Nerys:** //[She gives a breathless laugh]// Now that… //that// is what pride and joy feels like.\n\n//O5-5 smiles.// \n\n**O5-5:** And hope. \n\n//SCP-8007-1’s jaws part, the interior molten— flames lick the corners of her mouth, and she lets out a roar. It sounds like an explosion, shakes the cavern. In the distance, the foggy form of one of her front limbs emerges from the magma and grips the wall. SCP-8007-1 suddenly surges upwards, ascending at a startling speed.

She is silhouetted by billowing smoke and crackling volcanic lightning, the fire from her jaws and chest creates a glowing halo around her form.//\n\n//Later reports of her roar -- the sound of the eruption -- would be heard almost halfway around the globe.//\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= https://i.imgur.com/BgsQQ8W.png |caption= SCP-8007-1 upon emerging from Mauna Loa.
