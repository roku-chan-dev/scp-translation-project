Is that the [[[scp-4335 |video game full of cubes]]]?\n\nDRAYTON: It's the lollipop--\n\nMACE: Oh, I...\n\nDRAYTON: --the lollipop you catalogued.\n\nMACE: You want to run some tests on the peppermint smell?

I wanted to ask...\n\nMACE: What documentation?\n\nDRAYTON: The containment procedures.  Things like, uh, I check for spelling errors, slang, clinical tone.\n\nMACE: Are you the woman who grabbed my shirt at coffee last week?  Where are you?\n\nDRAYTON: I'm -- I don't think so, I'm in Site 64.  You're at Site 11?\n\nMACE: I was at Site 64 last week.  You're the woman who grabbed my shirt at coffee.  I already --\n\nDRAYTON: I'm not -- maybe. I don't remember.\n\nMACE: What?\n\nDRAYTON: I don't remember.  TCDs aren't -- we don't -- we have to take amnestics each week because we need to edit everything, and we're not allowed to remember the things we've edited.  What time did we speak?\n\nMACE: It was at coffee.\n\nDRAYTON: Around 11:30?

You're going to get someone killed and you're laughing?\n\nDRAYTON: No, I mean... I'm sorry.  I'm a technical editor.  We edit containment procedures for style, but we aren't allowed to keep our memories more than one week, and Monday morning is when I have to re-learn everything.  If I've made a mistake I'm truly sorry and I want to make things right.  Can I ask what edit I should fix?\n\nMACE: I've already fixed it.\n\nDRAYTON: OK, thank you.  Can I ask for my records anyway, so I can make sure I don't make the same kind of mistake twice?\n\nMACE: Edit number seven-niner-oh-foxtrot-one-five-six-niner.\n\nDRAYTON: Thanks, let me just pull that up.\n\n//The sound of typing on a keyboard can be heard.//\n\nDRAYTON: OK, I've got it here.

It was (//typing//) oh, it was me.  Uh, could I ask specifically what was wrong about the edit? I'd like to make sure my future edits are...\n\nMACE: You shouldn't be touching my files.\n\nDRAYTON: ...safe. Uh, OK.  Is this file... info-hazardous?\n\nMACE: What?\n\nDRAYTON: \"Info-hazardous\" -- it's a word that means the document itself...\n\nMACE: ...I know what infohazards are....\n\nDRAYTON: ...can be dangerous.  What was that?\n\nMACE: I know what infohazards are!\n\nDRAYTON: OK, sir, to answer your previous question I've worked here for four and a half years, but because I'm a TCD I can only remember as far back as lunch on Friday.  It looks like this automatic edit was applied to all Safe SCPs procedure docs that aren't tagged 'no edit' and that aren't tagged 'infohazard' ...\n\nMACE: You are not allowed to edit my files...\n\nDRAYTON: ...or 'memetic'.  OK, sir.  Maybe I could just say that this is a new project we're trying out.  The only edit the automation would do is to move the words around, maybe add some tags...\n\nMACE: No! I've told you three times now...\n\nDRAYTON: ...for clarity.  Would you stop interrupting me?\n\nMACE: ...don't edit my files!
