That where I was didn't matter. ##\n\n\nShards. Shards inside my skin, shards inside my head. Everything was broken, breaking. They were breaking me apart.\n\n\n\n##teal|They said they were trying to understand me.##\n##FF0000| But I didn’t understand them.##\n\n\n\n Should I have known? What should I have been thinking? What thoughts did they want me to think, to stop them from turning me to shreds of myself. \n\n\n##FF0000|I asked them where their humanity went.##\n##teal|They told me humanity doesn't hear about this.##\n\n\nI tried to think, I tried to bring something to the surface they’d listen to, something to stop the knives. \n\n\n\n [[span style=\"color:FF0000;\"]]I told them my name is Juliet.[[/span]]\n\n [[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They told me my name is H497.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nBut that’s not a name, is it? Did I dream of having a name? I couldn't remember how long I’ve been here, or who I was before. I saw flashes of colour when I close my eyes, but when I open them I saw the grey walls and static. \n\n\n[[span style=\"color:#FF5858;\"]]I told them I want to go home.[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They told me I don’t have a home.[[/span]]\n\n\nBut I remembered a home. I was warm then. I forgot what that warmth feels like, but I longed for it. That’s something I did remember. They refused it, refused the one memory I knew wasn’t a dream.\n\n\n\n[[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They told me I was diseased, that I was missing the thoughts in my brain. They have to inspect me. [[/span]]\n\n [[span style=\"color:#FF5858;\"]]I told them they took parts of my skin, asked them if they’re the disease.[[/span]]\n\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They didn’t like that[[/span]]. \n[[span style=\"color:#FF7070;\"]]I didn’t like them[[/span]]\nso I think we’re even.\n\n@@ @@\n\n\n\nBut they’re right. I don’t remember what my hands used to look like, and I don’t remember this static. I don’t mind it though, it helps. They had cut into me, trying to remove the parts that are still there. The static clings to me anyways, insulating me from the pain. I don’t feel what’s missing anymore. At first, I felt the knives, now I don’t. I still don’t like them, but they come anyways. I woke up, once, being prodded in a dim room. \n\n\n\n[[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They said that they wanted to remove the static, so they removed parts of me.[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:#FF7070;\"]]I said that I don’t mind, the static took the place of what went missing.[[/span]]\n\n\n\nSparkling like fireworks of black and white. It kept me safe from the pain. Kept me numb. \n\n\n[[span style=\"color:#FF8383;\"]]I used to tell them I was human, that I deserved to be treated like one.[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"color:teal;\"]]They would tell me I’m barely alive, that I’m not worth the effort.[[/span]]\n\n\nIt gets dim, the lights. The light is reaching me less and less now. But I don’t mind, the static keeps me safe. \n\nI wanted to lay my head down, for now. For a while. To try to think of words to say that would make them release me. \n\nNow, I can lay my head down anyways. There’s no point to the thoughts, the static takes their place, warms my brain. I feel its warmth, is this what… what home felt like? \n\n\n\n [[span style=\"color:#FF8383;\"]]I asked the static if it was my home.[[/span]]\n\n [[span style=\"color:slategray;\"]]That warmth, the tingling was its answer.[[/span]] \n\n\nThe numbness that felt so welcoming. \n\n\nI can hear voices, they feel so far away. Were they getting their knives? It didn’t matter, really I didn’t care.\n\n\n##teal|They call me a failure. ##\n\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3234  A new voice among them calls me a victim.] \n\n\nI can’t see them. The static hides the world from me. It protects me, and I don’t mind. \n\nTheir voices get louder, fighting each other. then they fall, hushed and fading to static. \n\n\nThe tingling begins to go away. The warmth, gets hotter. \n\nI try to open my mouth, to speak, to breathe, but my throat is filled with static. I don’t mind, it’s keeping me safe.   \n\n@@ @@\n\n [[span style=\"color:#FF9595;\"]]I feel like I’m floating away. [[/span]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"color:#FFAAAA;\"]]Far, far away.
