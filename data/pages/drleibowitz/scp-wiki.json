Dr. Leibowitz was hired on ██/██/████ after having shown competence in the thaumaturgical and chemical sciences. Dr. Leibowitz was mostly hired for his knowledge of amnestic and mnestic compounds and secondaraly for his work in the occult underground, being known to have contacts in both The Serpent's Hand and the \"Are We Cool Yet?\" GoI's.\n\nDr. Leibowitz has been shown to have --slight-- above average mental --problems-- peculiarities relating to his time in ████████, ██. This has lead to him having an --annoying-- interesting relationship with the Foundation. Due to his skill in areas of Thaumaturgy and Chemistry, Dr. Leibowitz is not to be demoted past Class-C personnel with a baseline grade of Class-B. Dr. Leibowitz is to be kept away from any and all psychoactive drugs without at least two (2) Level-4 clearance personnel and two (2) members of a qualified MTF standing-by.\n\n----\n\n**Personal History:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n[[collapsible show=\"[Level-5 Clearance Only]\" hide=\"[ACCESS APPROVED]\"]]\n\n> To anyone who's reading this\n> I buggered with the expungement clearance a little, so Level-4's could view it as well\n> Not a big deal, but too many people thought I was like a demon or a reality bender\n> I'm just a dude that likes books\n\nDoctor Israel Leibowitz was born in San Diego, CA to Abram and Rachel Leibowitz on 30 June 1996. He studied science and theology at home until he was old enough to be put into public schooling. He showed great aptitude in the areas of math and science, and frequented the university libraries, especially those with rare book collections.\n\nWhen he was in elementary school, Dr. Leibowitz began his studies into the occult, summoning his first entity at the age of 8, but only manifesting it for 45 minutes. After that event, he devoted himself fully to the paranormal and studied everything he could in the areas of demonology, theology, alchemy, and other forms of thaumatergical arts.\n\nDuring middle school, Dr. Leibowitz became more reclusive in his work, disappearing for long periods of time. One of our agents in the Wanderer's Library believe that he  was the one people during this time referred to as \"The Boy Wanderer\" or \"The Little Librarian,\" which would mean that he discovered a way into the library by the time he was 12. The one known as \"The Boy Wanderer\" never really talked to many people about himself, so it is unclear weather these rumors are to be believed.\n\nHis high school career was even more sparse, often showing wildly swinging aptitudes in everything unrelated to chemistry or religion, which he always seemed consistently good at. The proponents of \"The Boy Wanderer\" theory, claim that this could be because he was switching on a regular basis with versions of himself from other timelines, although it is unclear why he would do this. It is worth noting at this point that Dr. Leibowitz himself seems wholly uninterested in discussing the possibility that he is \"The Boy Wanderer,\" apparently finding the theory totally boring.\n\nHe went to college at the University of California at Berkley, where he continued his study of the paranormal while pursuing a degree in Chemistry. He frequently utilized the university library to acquire copies of rare alchemical books from around the world, under the guise of research.\n\nIn his professional career, Dr. Leibowitz spent much of his time off the radar, although it is known that sometime during this period of his life, he amassed contacts in the Serpant's Hand and the Are We Cool Yet? groups of interest. He seemed to have developed an addiction to cocaine during this time as well, but seems to be, otherwise, a model chemist. \n\nThe next time his paranormal life appeared on the Foundation's radar was during an incident at his previous employer, CalChem Synthesis, where it was reported for about 45 minutes that a large squid appeared in the lab where Dr. Leibowitz was working, due to, according to witnesses, some sort of summoning ritual the doctor had preformed. When the Foundation dispatched agents to investigate, however, all the witnesses appeared to have been treated with a crude approximation of Class-C amnestics, selectively forgetting details relating to the event. The Foundation used mnestics on the individuals, which worked flawlessly, and discovered that during this time Dr. Leibowitz had found a method of producing amnestics of sufficient quality without the use of Y-909 compound.\n\nFollowing the events of this incident, Dr. Leibowitz was approached and hired by the foundation.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\nDr. Leibowitz has compiled several documents for the Foundation, a few of those compiled by him are listed below:\n\n* [[[SCP-80RK-J|SCP-80RK-J - Unfortunately The Best Doggo]]]\n* [[[SCP-4630|SCP-4630 - I Put My Lettuce in the CRISPR and Now It's Sapient]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales]]\nDr. Leibowitz is known for occasionally compiling reports for the Foundation, a few of which are listed below:\n\n* [[[mtf-whiskey-tango|MTF Whiskey-Tango]]]\n* [[[containment-breach-at-site-09|Containment Breach at Site-09]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab GoI Formats]]\nDue to Dr. Leibowitz' contacts in some GoI's, he has managed to exfiltrate documents from their documents, examples include:\n\n+++ __The Black Queen__\n* [[[timeline-i-5|Timeline η-5]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab ████posts]]\nDue to unfortunate contractual agreements between Dr. Leibowitz and --Satan-- The Scarlet King, the following documents are preserved for the sake of our souls (Hosted on DrLeibowitz' Sandbox Page):\n\n* [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/drleibowitz#It_Was_All_So_Simple It Was All So Simple (#HungerGamesSCP chat lore)]\n* [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/drleibowitz#A_Day_In_The_Life_of_A_Corporate_Asshole A Day in the Life of a Corporate Asshole (Dr. Leibowitz' narrative backstory: Joining the SCP Foundation)]\n* [http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/drleibowitz#The_Russian_One Чеховское Ружьё]\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/drleibowitz Sandbox Link]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=DrLeibowitz]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** redacted_ID_card.png\n> **Name:** redacted_ID_card.png\n> **Author:** [[*user DrLeibowitz]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/drleibowitz\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
