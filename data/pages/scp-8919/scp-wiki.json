Foundation personnel are not permitted to communicate with the entity without the Site Director's permission.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8919 is a male goldfish (//Carassius auratus//) capable of speech in fluent English. It is able to grant wishes to any subject upon request. SCP-8919 confirmed to be a Type-IV reality-bending entity.\n\n**Interview Log:**\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-8919\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Thomas Rigel\n> \n> ------------------------\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** Good afternoon, SCP-8919.\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** Afternoon, Doc! What brings you to my humble fishbowl? What is your heart's desire? Fame? Fortune? Women?... Men?\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** Let's cut to the chase. I've read the experiment logs regarding your anomalous properties. Can you actually grant wishes?\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** Of course! One hundred percent legit. No gimmicks, no catches. Go on, ask for something small.\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** Hmmm... alright. How about a pizza?\n> \n> [SCP-8919 bobs in the water, then a slice of pepperoni pizza manifests on the table.]\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** Not bad. But what about something bigger? Something that really matters?\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** Oh, I like where this is going. What'll it be? A raise? A new car? Maybe a little boost in the downstairs department? [SCP-8919 winks]\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** No, my wish is something much greater. [Glances around nervously] I doubt I have much time before someone checks in on me, so let’s do this. I wish to be the sole ruler of the entire SCP Foundation. The Council can handle the administrative work, but I want to be above them. Absolute authority. Just me.\n> \n> [Suddenly, the door bursts open. Several armed agents storm the room, restraining Dr. Rigel.]\n> \n> **Agent Booth:** Dr. Rigel, you are under arrest for treason against the Foundation.\n> \n> **Dr. Rigel:** What? No! That's a mistake! The fish...\n> \n> [Dr. Rigel is forcibly removed from the room.]\n> \n> **Agent Booth:** How many does that make now?\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** That was the third one this month. I thought he'd last a little longer. I can't believe they keep falling for this trick.\n> \n> **Agent Booth:** Good work. Keep playing your part, Agent Bubbles.\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** What can I say? Some people just can't resist the bait. I'm not just a simple bait fish with minor magic powers, you know; I'm a master baiter.\n> \n> **Agent Booth:**  [Sighs] Just... keep up the good work. \n> \n> [SCP-8919 twitches its fins, manifesting a pair of sunglasses on its face.]\n> \n> **SCP-8919:** That’s a fishy business.\n> \n> **[END LOG]**\n> \n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8918]]] | SCP-8919 | [[[SCP-8920]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
