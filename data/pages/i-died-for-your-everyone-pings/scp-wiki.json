This clearly ain’t it, chief, definitely). But this will not be enough to demoralize me! The Internet, from what I understand, is a gigantic place and, with time and patience, I will manage to find new followers. What I just need is to take a more subtle approach and to play more by the rules of the websites I visit.//\n\n//This is less « Thug Life » than I expected, but if I must do this to have results, then so be it! Now, I just have to learn more.//\n\n**03/09/2023**\n\n//Created an account on a platform named Discord (this name is another big yikes in my book). After several hours, I managed to find a server dedicated to the practice of « roleplaying ». It was perfect, since this unjust accusation of roleplaying hasn’t left my mind. From what I understand, people all gather around and create characters before playing various scenarios as said characters. I’m not really sure what to think of it. On one part, they are wasting time they could use following my teachings. But on another part, they seem to really have fun and be happy with it, which is quite lit, in my opinion!//\n\n//From my investigations, these servers can be on Discord but there’s also roleplaying made on several high-profile video games. My computer is pretty rustic and those games need a lot of resources, so it won’t be possible for me to use them to share my teachings. But it’s far from Joever! There’s still the Discord servers. But now, I will need to create a character if I want to be able to play with others. Maybe befriending them will be a more efficient method.//\n\n**24/09/2023**\n\n//It didn’t work. At first, everything went well, people seemed to love my character (despite some telling me that his devotion to my Father was too big a part of his characterization. I don’t really know what they’re talking about, isn’t it normal for someone to recite sentences from the Gospels before doing something?) but when I took it to private messages and revealed my identity to users I judged trustworthy, some of them thought I was the leader of a cult pretending to be Jesus and reported me to Discord, which led to my ban.//\n\n//So far, there’s nothing poggers about what is happening. Now, I will have to try again. Or find another place to talk.//\n\n**01/10/2023**\n\n//If there’s something I can confidently say, it’s that most of those forums I look into are burning my eyes. Who thought this was a good idea to put such bright colors everywhere? At least, back in my day, there weren’t such frivolities when my homies Mark, Matthew, Luke & John were writing their respective Gospels ! Just a simple, efficient presentation who is still, to this day, pure fire, if I do say so myself!//\n\n//For the rest, I didn’t have much success, so far.//\n\n**15/10/2023**\n\n//I’m starting to believe I fell into a very deep rabbit hole. Originally, I decided to rather visit websites already dedicated to my Father but after days and days of looking at it… I’m really starting to consider taking another mental health break.//\n\n//For sure, those websites present themselves as dedicated to my teachings and there’s a lot of quotes from my book that are peppered all over it but the more I look at it, the more I come to realize they don’t really talk about me or what I’m saying, instead, they talk about people they don’t like or how I apparently told them to do this thing or this other thing. 95% of the time, I don’t remember having said it (and I can’t even blame it on lean or the Grimace Shake messing with my memories, none of those things were invented yet).//\n\n//I think I’ll stick to speaking directly with non-believers, fr fr.//\n\n**23/10/2023**\n\n//Break over. Let’s get back to it.//\n\n**16/11/2023**\n\n//Almost one month since the last entry but there’s a good reason for it. I think I actually found a very interesting road to follow. Since I first contacted the members of this SCP Foundation, their use of the word « anomalous » to refer to me has been something that hasn’t left my mind and I wished to know more about what this word meant.//\n\n//As usual (I think I have to expect it, at this point), research was at first pretty hard and I had to look at a lot of misinterpretations and lies. Then, I ended up discovering a strange forum named « Parawatch ». From what they say, it seems to be a place when paranormal enthusiasts and amateur writers are congregating to share stories and their experiences with what surely enters under this term of « anomalous ».//\n\n//Some of these phenomena, I already knew about, but since it wasn’t something I talked about a lot with my Father, there’s also dozens and dozens of new ones I heard about for the first time. To this day, I still don’t know if learning about that is more bothersome or based.//\n\n//After some weeks, I managed to contact a user named « Three6serpent ». They seemed enthusiastic enough about the anomalous and when I revealed my true identity to them, they didn’t reject my claim. Instead, they asked me what Jesus exactly was I. I admit that I failed to see what they meant. After some days of chatting, they told me about a place called « The Wanderers’ Library » and invited me to meet them there.//\n\n//I’m not really sure of what could happen but if I can manage to convince others to follow me, well, I might finally have an even bigger crew than before!//\n\n**02/12/2023**\n\n//We don’t really know how big the world is. I’m certain of it, now.//\n\n**23/12/2023**\n\n//Thanks to my constant conversations with Three6serpent, I discovered a social media platform named Void. From what I understand, this is a website that acts as a Twitter of sorts for the anomalous world. This discovery and my frequent travels to the Library made me realize that there are so many lost sheeps that, somehow, I managed to not know about.//\n\n//My new goal is now clear and I have to say, I’m pretty excited to get to work! Not to mention that, since it’s the anomalous world, it will be way easier for me to prove my identity to them. So, it’s win-win!//\n\n//I can already predict that the most based days are in front of us, now.//\n\n**24/12/2023**\n\n//Got banned from Void. Apparently, followers of other deities didn’t take kindly to my immense swag. Now, I have to wait a bit. Again.//\n\n//Happy celebrations to me, I guess.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
