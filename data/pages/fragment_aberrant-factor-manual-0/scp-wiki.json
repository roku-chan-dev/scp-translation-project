I actually still have my copy from back when it was originally released -- and they're going for upwards of $500 in pristine condition so I took a huge risk by scanning the manual for y'all. The game's interesting and I remember never being able to beat it when I was young though. There's a rumor going around it's actually based on hidden classified FBI files, but that's fucking stupid because if it was, then they wouldn't have been able to make it in the first place. I also uploaded a text-only version, too, which you can find [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aberrant-factor-manual/offset/1 here].\n\nIt's highly recommended to view them with your browser in fullscreen or as close to it as possible, so you can read all the text and look at the texture of the images. Anyways, I delivered the request. Have fun with it and I hope you enjoy.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p00-00.png]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"widebox\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p00-01.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p02-03.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p04-05.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p06-07.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p08-09.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p10-11.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p12-13.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p14-15.png]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/aberrant-factor-manual/p16.png]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ ##red|ABERRANT FACTOR##\n++++ FOR PC BROWSERS\n\n++ COMING SOON.\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@",
