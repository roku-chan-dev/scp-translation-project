No hosting service currently houses the .vktm domain name, and as far as Foundation researchers and technicians can ascertain, it does not exist.  Shortly after the service debuted on the website, an application was released and forcibly downloaded on every smartphone active within the United States through unknown means.[[footnote]]This included phones that were incapable of running the software, forcing many thousands of owners to reset to factory settings.[[/footnote]]\n\nFormatting on SCP-7830 concerning image and text placement is wildly inconsistent.  When asked about this feature on the platform, Mari MacPhaerson noted that “Viber uses the proprietary formatting technology 'Visionary', which exemplifies the high standard for graphical design always on display with Vikander-Kneed Technical Media products.”\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM%20x%20twitter2-ALT]]\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-7830’s anomalous effects include a cognitohazard that creates a compulsion to check an affected user’s feed of content on the platform.  Affected individuals will refresh their feeds dozens of times a day, spending a large percentage of their free time focused on the social media platform.  Failure to refresh the feed can lead to elevated feelings of anxiety, and a general sense of impending doom.  Additionally, information contained within posts on SCP-7830 is retained in an affected individual’s memory even with amnestic therapy.  \n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM%20x%20twitter3-ALT]]\n[[/=]]\n\nTwenty-four hours after SCP-7830 first debuted, a post was uploaded that announced the platform would be undergoing a change.\n\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM%20x%20Twitter4-ALT]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWithin moments of the above post, a press conference was livestreamed to YouTube on the channel VKTM Insights.[[footnote]]This channel did not exist prior to the stream session, but nevertheless over three hundred thousand users watched it live.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #7DA5C6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n**VKTM Viber Press Conference Transcript**\n//23 July 2023//\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//[A humanoid individual wearing a silk blouse and a bandage around her eyes sits behind a folding table with numerous microphones set up in front of her.[[footnote]]No logos of existing news services are evident on the microphones and Foundation personnel have not found any evidence of any news service attending this event.[[/footnote]]  Blood can be seen dripping down her face and splattering the table throughout the stream.

This prompted another mobilization by Foundation forces to detain any employees involved in or aware of this plan, contain SCP-7830 users that had become doubles of celebrities, and amnesticize any witnesses.  The Department of Procurement and Liquidation was preparing a proposal to buy out the control of any studio or production house utilizing this technique, in order to assist in the containment of SCP-7830’s side effects, when verification anomalies suddenly ceased to manifest.
