She usually started work an hour before everyone else -- an hour for which she would not be paid -- and even when she was running a little late, she was still almost always alone.  She wasn't sure she liked this change of routine.\n\nHe didn't seem displeased to see her, at least. \"Go get a chair, and sit down.\" The reports from the previous night were still on the desk, but disassembled. Their contents had been rearranged into piles, the logic of which she couldn't guess at a glance.\n\nShe walked back into the vestibule, grabbed her office chair, and returned to find him holding up the database entry for SCP-5056 by both edges. His hands shook quite badly. \"What's missing here?\"\n\nShe took her seat, and glanced over the page. //Object class, special containment procedures, description, addendum with tests...// \"Nothing jumps out at me, sir.\"\n\nHe set it down in front of her. \"Good choice of words. This thing is a murder monster. It jumps out at people. When they tried to isolate it, it blew out everyone's eardrums. When they tried to cage it, it blew out Bradbury's brain. How many hostile Groups of Interest are you aware of, Karen?\"\n\nShe'd seen a lot of lists over the past few years. \"Uh… Chaos Insurgency, Serpent's Hand, two different churches of the Broken God… Vikander-Kneed… Marshall, Carter & Dark, Anderson Robotics... even our insurers, Goldbaker-Reinz, are—\"\n\nHe waved irritably. \"I was looking for a number. The number is very high, yes? And what qualms do this array of foes have about mobilizing anomalies against us?\n\nIt was a much easier question, but she found it much harder to speak the answer. \"None, sir. Universally, none.\"\n\n\"Correct. And how do we combat them? When we can be bothered?\"\n\n\"Mobile task forces, primarily.\" Her suspicions about where this was headed were all but confirmed.\n\n\"You see what I'm driving at. We fight monsters with men, which axiomatically transforms men into monsters. Why not skip a step? Fight monsters with monsters.\" He tapped the file. \"There's nothing, absolutely //nothing// in here about the paramilitary benefits of a creature which cannot be harmed, can go anywhere light can go, and can drive a man insane at its leisure. Imagine if we were to drop this pathetic janitor into the Insurgency's hardened mobile array? Imagine it loose in the Wanderers' Library, giving those selfrighteous Archivists something incorporeal to chew on. Imagine...\" An unpleasant look of absolute rapture spread across his withered features. \"Imagine if we could decouple it from Deering entirely, take him out of the picture, and fully weaponize the thing.\"\n\nThis was all rather a lot at seven in the morning. \"I knew we sometimes incorporate paratech into our gear,\" she began, very carefully, \"but my understanding is that Overwatch is opposed to the formal use of anomalies in the field. It goes against our containment ethos.\"\n\n\"Containment ethos.\" Falkirk barked out a single syllable of scornful laughter. \"This beast is wandering the halls right now, free as a bird, with its idiot victim in tow. Site-43 is where containment goes to die, and while that's reprehensible and needs to change, in the interim... well, it has its uses. Nobody's made use before, and I intend to start.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"I thought you were here, sir, with respect, to conduct an investigation into Director McInnis' conduct?\"\n\nHe grinned so wide, she half expected the corners of his mouth to start bleeding. \"And that's precisely what this is going to be. If you want to have a career in administration, Karen, you need to remember: we don't just want you identifying problems. We want you identifying //solutions.//\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt took McInnis another long ride along the rails, a walk through AAF-A and a chilly stroll through the off-limits quadrant of Ipperwash Provincial Park to find Chief Ibanez. She was putting her new recruits through their literal paces in the forested core of the interdiction zone; S&C had taken on ten new agents in the wake of the AAF-D breach, and its Chief had taken a personal interest in their training. He was treated to the once-rare sight of Delfina Ibanez jogging, puffing along in her jumpsuit as five bulky guards struggled to keep pace at either arm. She was definitely making them work for it.\n\nWhen she saw him approaching across the snowy centre field, she stopped and called attention. He shook his head as he stepped onto the track. \"Don't mind me, just a highly-paid observer today.\"\n\nIbanez glared at the guards, each in turn. \"Give us a few more laps before lunch, if you've got it in you.\" They dutifully set off.\n\n\"I'm surprised to find you out here.\" He stuck his gloved hands in his pockets; the wind through the pines was merciless. \"I thought you liked to generate an aura of distant mystery in their first week.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, maybe it was too distant.\" She watched them round the first turn in smart sync. \"There's such a thing as //esprit de corps.//\"\n\nThe two of them started along the track in the opposite direction. \"I distinctly recall a not-much-younger security chief telling me that //esprit de corps// was a problematic term, because--\"\n\n\"--focusing on spirits and bodies is morbid, yeah. Well, I've changed my mind. I used to think my job was to keep their //esprits// in their //corpses,// not hold their goddamn hands, but I've had a bit of a re-think.\" She was full of energy, hopping on the balls of her feet whenever he fell slightly behind. \"You know I hate the psych angle, but under all that muscle, Ngo tells me these folk are actually human beings? Apparently, if they think I've got their backs, they'll listen when I tell them to advance.\"\n\n\"Seems to me you're just trading in aphorisms.\" Nascimbeni's earlier accusation on the same note still stung a little. \"Have you practical proof that this method is any better?\n\nIbanez waited until the guards had passed them by before replying. \"Evidence, I dunno, but the logic seems sound. Sending people to die isn't leadership, it's authority. Authority is the special trick they let you pull on them when you've put in your leadership hours. And leading isn't about telling people what to do, Allan, it's right there in the word -- you can't //lead// from //behind.//\"\n\nHe clicked his tongue. \"Linguistic contortionism, Chief. I thought you were more practical than this.\"\n\nShe pointed at the group of joggers now halfway across the field again. \"You want to put yourself out there, be the one in charge? You don't want to turn around and find out nobody was behind you all along.\" She shot him a meaningful glance. \"Think anybody's levied a complaint about your dismissal, yet?\"\n\nHe allowed her to rejoin the runners, and watched them move away from him for a while before heading back to AAF-A.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 16 January\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#F0EDC1; padding-left:12px; padding-right:12px; padding-top:6px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ NOTICE FROM THE OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR, SITE-43\n[[/=]]\n[[f>image OD.png]]\n\nThe latitude afforded Site-43 in the management of its affairs thus far has been predicated on a promise of increased efficiency, in both containment and research.

Elstrom, Office of the Director.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Falkirk, Edwin T.

I'm not sure I can do this.\"\n\n\"No? That's unfortunate.\" He cracked his knuckles; the sound was sickening. \"I didn't want to believe you were the same as all the rest.\"\n\nShe placed the paper on his desk, and pursed her lips. \"Meaning what, sir?\"\n\n\"What are the most important Sections of this Site, Dr. Elstrom?\"\n\nShe was already getting used to his abrupt changes of tack, and again she did know this one. \"Acroamatic Abatement, and Archives and Revision.\"\n\n\"And who is the Chair of Acroamatic Abatement?\"\n\n\"There isn't one. The Chair of Applied Occultism does double duty.\"\n\n\"Why?\"\n\nShe didn't precisely know, but he hated to hear it, so... \"Because of the similarity of the portfolios--\"\n\n\"I didn't ask for the official lie. What's the //actual reason?//\"\n\nShe threw up her hands. \"I don't know. Dr. Scout didn't want to replace Dr. Rydderech when he disappeared, and even if he had, he'd have had to pass over Dr. Reynders for the post, and he knew that would upset her?\" It all came out in a rush of half-baked supposition.\n\n\"That's it, actually.\" He seemed satisfied. \"That's it //precisely.// Now, are these good reasons?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"Not particularly. No.\"\n\n\"And what about Archives and Revision? Who's the chair?\"\n\n\"Harr--\" She cleared her throat. \"Harold Blank.\"\n\n\"How old is he?\"\n\n//Eight days younger than I am.// \"I have no idea.\"\n\n\"You have //some// idea. Guess.\"\n\n\"Forty?\"\n\n\"Thirty-six. Now tell me, Dr. Elstrom: how many department heads at other Sites are thirty-six years old?\"\n\nThis constant bombardment was exhausting. She wished he'd just get the lecture over with. \"I would imagine not that many.\"\n\nFalkirk had a look of smug malice on his face. \"Lillian Lillihammer is being set up to replace Del Olmo, once Euler slopes back to 87. She's exactly the same age as Blank. So is Veiksaar. Ibanez is twelve years younger -- twelve years younger! -- and she's in charge of Security and Containment, our banner bearers. Okorie will probably replace Zlatá before she's thirty. McInnis became Director in his forties.

It was true; driving was an exercise in reflexes, acuity, and the following of rules. Driving calmed her down.\n\nShe really, very badly needed to calm down right now.\n\n\"I'd like to talk to you for a moment now, Karen. Are you of a mind to listen, or would you prefer--\"\n\n\"Talk. Definitely talk.\" She needed her mind occupied. It kept wandering back to the faceless tellers in the flesh-formed bank hall.\n\n\"Thank you.\" McInnis hadn't told her where to drive, but he had told her not to look in the rear-view mirrors. She hadn't argued; whatever the helicopter people were about, she was sure she didn't want to know. \"You're wondering one of two things, right now. What just happened, and why did it not fully faze me. Which would--\"\n\n\"You,\" she said. \"I don't want to think about the bank. I //sat// in that bank, I //ate my lunch//...\" She felt like she might vomit, even dry heaved a bit. He gave her a look of concern, but made no move to touch her back or steady her hands on the wheel. It was almost as though he knew about the pepperspray in the glove compartment. She kept control of the vehicle, and gradually regained control of her stomach. \"No, not the bank. Talk about you.\"\n\n\"Very well. I told you my real name today, Karen, because if you'd been part of that thing back there, it wouldn't have mattered, and if this meeting had gone a little differently, we could have made you forget. We can //still// make you forget, in fact. Forget this ever happened. Forget you ever worked at the Bank of Simcoe South, had ever even heard of it. We could craft for you a cover story so convincing, it would convince even you. I'm sure that sounds plenty attractive right now.\"\n\nThey were alone on this stretch of dirt road, no lights in front... //don't look behind.// It was just her, and him, and between them the horrible impossibility of what they'd just escaped from. She felt like she was losing her grasp on reality, drifting out to sea, and McInnis was offering a lifeline. She nodded, but said nothing.\n\n\"There are, however, other options available to you. We're going to need to have a talk, you and I, about everything you saw and said and did inside that bank -- not now!\" He saw her hands clenching the wheel even tighter, and his voice became low and soothing. \"Not now, not yet. I'm going to tell you where to drive, and it's going to be a long haul. If we take the back roads -- and that would be my preference -- we'll have maybe three hours and change to get acquainted.\"\n\nShe looked at him dead on for the first time since climbing into her ancient sedan with its old-timey waistbelts and faux-wood side panels. \"Is this a kidnapping?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He nodded for emphasis. \"Yes, of course it is. You've just seen something terrible, and it's my job to make sure of two things: first, the terrible thing is understood as clearly as possible, and second, it can't hurt anyone else. But that includes you, Karen, and you have my word that no harm is going to come to you tonight. Not with me.\"\n\nShe looked back at the road, bleached grey in the high-beam light. She hadn't even noticed when she'd flicked the high-beams on. \"Great. Sounds great. I guess stopping for coffee is too much to ask?\"\n\n\"Not at all. I wouldn't mind using a gas station restroom, actually, and perhaps picking up a pack of...\" He shook his head. \"No, that's in the past. But the restroom would still be lovely.\"\n\n\"Dunno what kind of gas stations //you've// been using.\" She glanced at him again. \"You're not afraid I'll try to run away if you leave me alone?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No, Karen Elstrom of 18 Goose Crescent, Cedarville, Ontario, I'm not particularly worried.\"\n\nShe pulled the car onto the shoulder, as gently as she could, then slowed to a stop and put the parking brake on. She looked him dead in his dark brown eyes, and said: \"Who the fuck are you?\"\n\n\"I'm the Director of Site-43,\" he said. \"There's a Site-01, and a Site-02, and a Site-322, and many of the numbers in-between... and we've got much more than just Sites, you see.\"\n\nShe didn't see. \"What do you do? At Site-43?\"\n\n\"We protect people. People like you. From things like //that.//\" He pointed at the rear-view mirrors she wasn't allowed to look into, one by one. \"And that's your other option: working with me, with people //like// me, to keep the world safe.\"\n\nShe stared at him. \"I'm thirty years old.\"\n\n\"The young have fresh ideas,\" he agreed.\n\n\"I have an //MBA.//\"\n\n\"Not all ideas are created equal,\" he admitted with a smile, \"but our business needs administration no less than any large corporation's. More, in fact, I'm quite confident in saying.\"\n\nShe gazed out the windshield at the darkening sky, at the stars, at the distant light pollution of Toronto on the very far horizon. She looked down at her dashboard, at the indicator telling her she was nearly out of gas, at the McDonald's soda cup in the cupholder, at the immaculate bucket seats of the car she never could have afforded without a loan from her parents, at Allan McInnis in his expensive casualwear. At the moment, this strange moment in time, it made a certain sense to her.\n\n\"How well does it pay?\" she found herself asking.\n\nHe laughed out loud. \"Well, it's a living.

Let me try another question: where do you keep your ugly doctors?\"\n\nShe gaped at him. \"Huh?\"\n\n\"Your ugly doctors. Academics range from bookish to homely, as a general rule, and yet the homeliest person I've seen here is Wettle. Most of your colleagues look like the movie versions of themselves. I'll compound the question and set it you again: why is this facility full of attractive young people instead of effective, experienced ones?\"\n\nHer cheeks would be achieving an all-natural rouge now. \"Are you implying I got my job the same way?\"\n\n\"Have I merely been implying? I meant to state it nakedly.\" He looked her up and down without the faintest hint of shame. \"Look in the mirror, and tell me that your brain is your most immediately marketable asset.\"\n\nShe remembered the bank in the boonies. She remembered driving out of a warzone as the helicopters landed and the mobile task force set to the building-sized blob of blubber with flamethrowers and abatement tanks -- though she didn't remember that stuff was happening, since she'd been forbidden to see, but she'd handled the expenditure forms for it all as her first official duty at Site-43. She remembered the long drive to Ipperwash, McInnis buying her coffee at the first Shell station they found, then asking after her education, her prospects and skills, and at the time it had seemed like a trick to calm her racing nerves, but then after the longest interview of her life she'd discovered that the proffered job was not a ruse...\n\n...and he'd damn well never tried to sneak a look down her shirt. Falkirk was talking shit, and she was going to tell him s--\n\n\"You're at a loss. I understand!\" He did look like he thought he understood, like he thought she would naturally agree with him. \"I felt something similar once, though from the other side of the fence, when I realized I would never be a part of their young and restless crowd. It's a sickening thing to behold, I know. But they made a serious mistake in hiring you, Dr. Elstrom.\"\n\nShe shook her head. He'd obviously rehearsed this speech, so she might as well let it play out. \"They did?\"\n\n\"Very much so. Because alone among the beautiful people, I strongly suspect you've got a brain in your pretty little head. You're a quick study, and you've got an edge. I want to sharpen you up further. I want to make them regret thinking you were just another dumb blonde.\"\n\n\"I'm not here to help you take revenge.\" It was not the diplomatic thing to say, but it was the right thing. //I think.//\n\n\"Good. Revenge is petty, and the world can't afford to employ petty defenders. I want you to help me shake things up so that the perverts and dilettantes have to start actually doing the work we hired them to do. No more shirking. No more prioritizing grab-ass over research.

It was a charming little clapboard, more than enough space for one man -- which was all it ever had to contain, and not very often. Like most of the senior staff, the ASC spent virtually all his time either at work or in his dedicated dorm. It was a strange sensation for both of them, then, to be sitting in the simple pine-and-lino kitchen and watching the trees sway outside.\n\n\"I don't trust him there alone,\" McInnis sighed. Even in this personal setting, even removed from their posts, it was hard to talk about anything but their jobs.\n\n\"He's not alone.\" The ASC was sipping at a cup of tea, looking serene and collected as ever. His composure was so legendarily unflappable that even McInnis was regularly jealous. \"Harry and Lillian know what he's like. They'll be watching him.\"\n\n\"They can watch all they want, Nim, but he's //Directing.// You barely had to work with this man, you don't know what he's like with authority. He doesn't want to be in charge because he loves power; he's not a control freak. He hasn't got ends to justify his means. He's just... well, mean. He wants to be in charge because we don't want him in charge, and he's going to do everything he can to do nothing we want done.\" It had always been easy to grouse about Falkirk. He'd been the Site's prime hate sink for thirty years, and Allan found that even he was not immune to the appeal. \"That's why they made him the 01 liaison in the first place, back in the sixties. He's a contrarian, and he doesn't get it honestly. He doesn't consider all the variables and come to a decision, he just decides what he wants, what he believes, who he likes and who he hates, and he acts on that.\" He tapped the table to emphasize each point.\n\n\"And why is that worse than what you are?\"\n\nMcInnis gave his erstwhile deputy a cockeyed glance.\n\n\"Why do you want to be in charge? You're not trying to impress anybody, and your tastes are Spartan so you definitely don't need the money.\" This seemed more than a little ironic, the two of them sitting in a house which hadn't changed an iota since it had been purchased for the asking price, no questions asked, in the late 1990s. \"What's driving you? The satisfaction of a job well done? The sense of purpose? The need to protect the world? What?\"\n\nMcInnis thought about that, and said the first few things that came to mind. \"I believed that I was good at it. I've always believed that people should act according to their gifts.\"\n\nThe ASC laughed. He laughed easily; it was one of the most immediate factors distinguishing the two of them. The others were the fact that while McInnis wasn't pale, the ASC was dark, and while McInnis was short, the ASC was nearly as tall as Lillihammer. \"Well that's very Vulcan of you, sir, but it doesn't explain why you're so upset about September all these months later.\"\n\nMcInnis pulled a face. \"What? Who says I'm upset about anything? I'm a Site Director, Nim, my feathers don't ruffle that easily.\"\n\n\"Easily?\" The only man snorted. \"It was a disaster, and it affected everyone. It ruffled all the feathers. And it changed you.\"\n\nHe said nothing in response.\n\n\"You've still got your gift of gab, and your equanimity, but you've lost hold of the reins. Nascimbeni barely listens to you, and Ibanez doesn't talk to you. You were blaming yourself for what happened long before the Council did.\"\n\nAgain he did not respond.\n\n\"Director--\"\n\nHe held up a hand. \"Allan. Not Director anymore.\"\n\n\"//Allan,// I'm going to tell you a story. Most of it you already know, or could have guessed, but I'm going to tell it anyway because that's what my people do, and we're on their land. Your task will be simple: as you own this story as well, you'll make sure I get the details correct. Understood?\"\n\nMcInnis nodded, bemused.\n\nThe ASC pulled his sock feet up, and sat cross-legged on the chair in his fancy leisurewear. He was completely incapable of looking ridiculous, no matter what he did. He narrowed his eyes, and began to intone: \"1995. I was studying law out west, preparing to be one more in a long line of treaty negotiators, when I heard what was happening here. The protest.\"\n\nThe protest, what was today called the Ipperwash Crisis, had been precipitated by the federal Department of Defence during the Second World War. They had appropriated Indian reserves along the Lake Huron shoreline to create Military Camp Ipperwash; the land was subsequently ceded to the provincial government and reorganized into Ipperwash Provincial Park, a significant portion of which was later secretly donated to the SCP Foundation for the construction of Site-43. The First Nations had never been invited back onto their land, so in 1995 they'd decided to come calling.\n\n \"The cause was righteous,\" the ASC continued, \"the need was great, and I answered the call. I came home to this place...\"\n\n\"You weren't living at Ipperwash before the protest,\" McInnis interrupted. \"You also weren't living at Kettle Point. Your mother took you away when you were just a small child. Did you leave that unclear to test my oral copyediting skills?\"\n\nThe ASC smiled, but ignored the question. \"You're right, of course. This hadn't been my home for years, //many// years, and I had been young and foolish then. I believed in the tales the elders told, believed them to relay actual fact, not metaphor. I even believed, in my childish imagination, that I had seen a few of the miracles myself. So foolish. In Alberta, with my mother, I learned to scoff at the old stories. I learned that magic was a property of legend, that no monsters roamed the Earth but the ones we made of ourselves. Like the one my father had become, as had his father before him, in those boarding schools far from prying eyes and standards. I learned to feel distaste and sympathy for those I'd left behind, and when that call to action came, I had to swallow the former to act on the latter. I came to Ipperwash to help with the struggle, and endure the storytelling only as much as I needed to.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded.\n\n\"On my first night, the provincial police tried to land a patrol boat on Ipperwash Beach and sneak an armed officer into our camp. I was out on a patrol of my own -- alone -- when I stumbled upon his craft. The province had warned the OPP not to use the lake--\"\n\n\"That was the official story,\" McInnis corrected. \"It was actually us.\"\n\nThe ASC inclined his head, and smiled again. \"-- but they had not listened, and it came back to bite them. Hard and literal. I found this wounded spy lying in a rut on the beach, screaming, a gigantic cat-snake-fish thing gnawing on one of his legs. He was calling for his mother; did you know that's a thing people really do?\" He still looked amazed, at the memory. \"I thought it was only in the movies. He was calling for his mother, and when he heard my approach -- because he'd taken in a breath, to sustain the screaming -- he called out to me instead.\"\n\nMcInnis could almost picture it. The ASC had a deep, hypnotic voice.\n\n\"I didn't know what to do. I didn't know what that thing was. But I knew it was going to kill him if I didn't intervene... so I did. I walked out of the bush, and onto the sands. It saw me.\" The Chief breathed deep. \"The beach was blue with moonlight, and the moon was in both of its huge, slitted eyes and glinting off its bronze tail, twitching with agitation. It stared at me for a moment, jaw still locked upon its prey, and then it released him and raised its head to consider me more closely. I saw the blood dripping from its fangs. I heard the man whimpering. I thought I was going to die.\"\n\nThe wind whipped the tops of the pines with a sudden rush of force.\n\n\"And then, and I will swear on this to my dying day, it //nodded at me// and walked straight back into the lake. Never looked back. I ran to my truck and called emergency services on my old sat phone, and they were there in seconds.\"\n\n\"More like //we// were there in seconds.\" McInnis had been the Chief of A&O at the time, had handled the calls himself. \"Couldn't have you reporting a water panther attack to the authorities, or the media. Treat, amnesticize, release. Of course, you didn't stick around.\"\n\n\"And a few days later, a man I had never seen before walked out of a building in the camp that I knew perfectly well he had never walked into.\" They shared a meaningful smile. \"Two of my friends had him in their power within moments, but he wasn't afraid. Not like the cops. The cops were always terrified of us; you can still see it in the photographs. It's like they think they're going to get scalped. In my mind, they're all that coward writhing on the sand, moments from grisly death, weak and in the wrong. But you? Calm as a cucumber, cocksure and confident.\"\n\n\"I was terrified too,\" McInnis chuckled. \"We don't //have// natives where I grew up, unless you count the Scots -- and I'm half-Scot myself. But I had the firm belief that people are people the world over, so I came up and out to talk.\"\n\n\"And what did you say?\"\n\n\"Well,\" he recalled, \"you spoke first.\"\n\n[[div class=\"mcinnis\"]]\n\"Who are you with?\" The massive man in the bandana, standing at the head of the group, pointed a heavy pine branch at me.\n\nI raised my hands, slowly. \"Nobody you know. Not the police, and not the government.\"\n\n\"How long have you been hiding in there?\" The big fellow looked past me, at the nondescript building I'd somehow emerged from. Camp Ipperwash was under native control; there should've been no way some random white man could have still been inside.\n\n\"Must've been days,\" one of the other protesters remarked. \"Been keeping a close eye.\"\n\n\"Look at him, though,\" another argued, pointing. \"Freshly-pressed, like Nim was before we set him straight.\"\n\nThey laughed. Their leader smiled ruefully at them.\n\n\"I've been hiding in there since well before all this started,\" I said.\n\n\"That's where you're wrong.\" The big man walked up and poked me lightly in the chest with his stick. \"This started centuries ago, and unless we handle this now, today, it'll still be going for centuries. So I don't have time to play games with you, mystery man. Tell me straight: where did you come from?\"\n\nI gestured at my origin point, and said: \"I'd rather tell you in private.\"\n\nWhy he agreed to come with me, alone, I will never know. I have asked him, and he has trouble giving me a straight answer. We simply decided to trust each other, saw perhaps some inherent commonality in our earnestness and plain speech, and I brought him into a world he'd had no idea existed. A world beneath his feet.\n\n\"This is obscene,\" he said, as I led him past rows of containment chambers. \"This land isn't yours, above or below. You shouldn't be here.\"\n\nI nodded. \"We're here under the sufferance of your people, though most of them don't know it. We made arrangements with the elders--\"\n\n\"The elders can't make this decision alone!\" For a man so tall, so broad and so obviously strong, he had an uncommon grasp on oratory. \"They derive their authority from //consent.// They negotiate. They inform, and we accede.\"\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Stop it there.\" The ASC smiled. \"You're not half-bad at this... Allan. I didn't hear anything meriting correction.\"\n\n\"But you did hear a moral, somehow. What was it? There can be no authority without consent? As I told you at the time, consent was impossible. You couldn't all know our secret. We couldn't ask everyone, so we asked a privileged few. Scout did.\"\n\n\"Yes. In 1942, you -- the royal you, Scout and the Foundation -- attempted to pass your crime onto others. Told the elders who you were and what you were doing, offered them clean water and protection from the Mounties, and they arbitrarily decided to trust you. That's what you think happened -- the royal you, and you yourself.\"\n\nMcInnis blinked. \"And? It's not?\"\n\nThe ASC laughed. \"Of course it's not. In 1942 every man, woman and child in this community was told, by those elders Scout trusted so readily, what was really going on. What was at stake. What this deal with the devil they did not know would mean for them. Did he really think they'd abandon their trust in each other, and adopt your means of authority? Our societies don't run on security clearance levels. We don't compartmentalize our knowledge. When you induct each new elder into the conspiracy, they're smiling and nodding and pretending to learn things they've known all their lives. When the decision was made to allow the Foundation to stay — not that there was any chance of making it leave, of course, but still — it was made in the old way. And the secret was kept, from the outside world and the one below, perfectly. In perpetuity.\" He looked rueful. \"Until just now, I suppose.\"\n\nHe couldn't quite process this. \"How long have you known? You personally, I mean.\"\n\n\"Not long!\" The ASC laughed. \"This afternoon, actually.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I haven't been home in a long, long time. I decided to ask a few questions, and got surprisingly direct answers. Those other men I met you with, at the Camp in '95? They knew. All the protestors knew. Only the strangers from afar, like myself, were in the dark. That's why I was able to convince them to let you alone, and focus our efforts on the government. They already knew to trust you, from their parents, from their grandparents. They just wanted you to affirm that trust for them, and they sent me as their innocent little envoy.\" He inclined his head. \"Alright, not so little.\"\n\nMcInnis shook his head. \"If there's a lesson for the present situation in here, you shouldn't have buried it in...\" He laughed, he actually laughed. \"You shouldn't have stuck it in the middle of this //absurd revelation.//\"\n\nThe ASC smiled broadly at him. \"Here's what I think the lesson is, Allan. You got the first part on your own: you can rule indifferently by fiat, but you can only rule well by consent. And consent requires periodic renewal. Fiat doesn't, but that's both because, and why, it only works in the short term. You might be able to hang on to power for a while by only making the higher-ups happy, but it's a delicate dance. When you fall, and you //will// fall... if you have no support from below...\"\n\n\"You keep falling.\" McInnis took a deep breath, and released a deep sigh. \"And it's a long way down from 43.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nKaren found Blank where he'd been every day since September 18, 2002: in Bradbury's hospital room. By now it was apparent to everyone but him that his research partner was never going to wake up, but he still did all his work in there nevertheless, on the off chance that each new day might be the one. He looked up as she walked in, and smiled. \"Working hours! Should we talk about scheduling the room for //Part II?//\"\n\nShe'd chosen her first words with care on the way, but this torpedoed them spectacularly. \"What?\"\n\n\"//Back to the Future: Part II!// Not as good as the first, but then, what is?

Your people have work that needs doing, and you have leadership training you're meant to be using.\" It was true; that didn't make it any easier to say out loud. \"Can you effectively lead your team from here?\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, are you bringing your DBA to bear on my gaggle of academics? Because I don't know if you know this, but researchers do their best research when you leave them the hell alone.\" Over the course of these two sentences, every trace of affability fell away.\n\n\"Is that really true, Dr. Blank? Really? Your presence at A&R wouldn't have any effect whatsoever on productivity? Because so far as I can tell, Dr. Bradbury isn't benefiting one bit from your supervision. She's in a coma.

She couldn't do that, but she could do this. \"If everyone had been properly trained, and knew their duties, it never would have happened.

Karen barely registered the fact that the Mountie was a woman, in the same way that one rarely notices whether an attack dog with foaming jaws has visible genitals; there had been women on the force since the 1970s, but no member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had ever entered Site-43 under friendly circumstances.\n\nThe woman glanced over her shoulder at Karen. \"Afternoon.\"\n\nKaren wasn't sure what to say, or do. \"Afternoon? Sorry to... interrupt.\"\n\n\"As you should be,\" Falkirk crooned. \"What do you want?\"\n\nShe took the folder out from under her arm. \"The files you asked for, sir. A&R, R&E, T&T and QS. I'll start on the others today.\"\n\n\"No, not today.\" He gestured at the desk, then at an empty chair. He must've brought in another for his guest. \"Put the files down, then put yourself down.\" \n\nThe Mountie guffawed. \"Phrasing!\"\n\nKaren placed the folder on the desk blotter, and took a seat. The Mountie extended a hand. \"Superintendent Morwen Couch. OSAT.\"\n\nKaren took the hand and shook it, mind awhirl. She was thinking that the last head of the Occult and Supernatural Activities Taskforce had been a man named Shine, which had seemed improbable until she'd meet a woman named Couch. She was thinking that an RCMP officer within the Site was bad enough, but the head of OSAT was simply unconscionable. She was thinking that she might get to see Allan McInnis visibly angry in the near future; she'd never seen that before. She wasn't sure anyone had.\n\nShe wasn't sure if she wanted to.\n\n\"As you know,\" Falkirk said, \"Our relationship with OSAT is a work in progress.\"\n\nKaren did not, in fact, know this. What she knew was that the SCP Foundation considered OSAT to be incompetent, partisan, destructive, and prejudiced. She said none of that. She nodded.\n\n\"I've chosen to make it one of my first projects as Site Director. Sergeant Couch and I are arranging a little... transfer of responsibilities.\"\n\n\"Transfer...\" Karen didn't comprehend.\n\n\"We're allies,\" Couch explained. \"Our organizations both want what's best for Canada. A single friendly gesture will go a long way towards proving that.\"\n\nOSAT was certainly in the spectrum of normalcy organizations which included the SCP Foundation, but allies the two were not. OSAT had attempted to invade the Site twice, once under the direction of a hostile Group of Interest -- and they'd succeeded, on that second occasion. They'd opened fire on the Site Director. This was absurd.\n\n\"We might even be able to put in a good word for you with the Council,\" Couch continued.\n\nThis took Elstrom a moment. At first she thought Couch meant the O5 Council; that didn't make any sense, but on the other hand, none of this did. Then she realized the sergeant was referring to the Council of 108, the ruling body of the Global Occult Coalition. OSAT had gained a seat on the Council when l’Ordre de Jacques-Cartier, a founding party, had been expelled for attempting a ritual working to affect the course of the 1995 referendum on Quebec sovereignty. That had turned a few heads; the GOC preferred to destroy paranormal threats, but OSAT had been commissioned to harness and exploit them. \n\nThe contradiction had never, to Elstrom's knowledge, been resolved.\n\n\"What's the proposal here, sir?\" Karen asked slowly.\n\n\"It's not a proposal, it's going to happen. This is the plan I arrived with, and I'm going to see it through.\" Falkirk looked very pleased with himself. \"On January 21, OSAT is going to take charge of one of our Nexus creatures. Nothing of major consequence, but they have their own special interest.\"\n\n\"That we do,\" Couch remarked with a smile.\n\n\"And in return, they're going to pass along a few items confiscated from an SCP we jointly decommissioned a few years back. Before your time, I believe: 5281? 5281-D, now.\"\n\nShe'd heard about that. \"//Bonhomme Sept-Heures//? The sandman AO has been using to train Okorie?\"\n\nFalkirk frowned. \"They //what?//\"\n\n//Uh.// \"The skeleton keeps generating sand, and they've been using it as a reagent. What? What's wrong?\"\n\nThe Director //pro tem// was turning purple, and Couch was turning the colour of her uniform. She spoke first: \"I was under the impression that decommissioning an object took it permanently out of anomalous //commission.// Are you saying it's still producing phenomena?\"\n\n\"//Regardless,//\" Falkirk interrupted, glaring at Karen, \"yes, that's the object we're talking about. The Foundation kept the skeleton, and OSAT got its hat and cloak. We'll be having those back, and they can have their werewolf.\"\n\n\"Werewolf?\" Karen looked between the two of them; they were staring daggers at each other, presumably over the gaffe she herself had just committed. \"You're giving them a werewolf?\"\n\n\"A werewolf in a coma,\" Couch corrected.\n\n\"Perhaps we could make it a two-in-one deal,\" the old man snapped. \"Would you like a doctor in a coma, to start off your collection?\"\n\nShe knew he wasn't serious, but that he would even say it out loud...\n\nFalkirk tossed an envelope on the Elstrom end of his desk. \"Take this to S&C, make sure they sign off, and don't take any guff.

It wasn't a good look. \"Developing some straight lines in that lovely curved backbone of yours, are we? Good.\" She had to fight the sudden urge to stand and walk away. She won, just barely. \"I won't be around forever, and you'll need that iron for dealing with these idiotic ingrates moving forward.\" \n\n\"I just don't see what any of this has to do with the //breach,//\" she said. \"Which is what they sent you here to look into.\"\n\n\"They sent me here,\" Falkirk snarled, \"to determine whether the leadership of Site-43 has been leading it to ruin. This entire facility is an experiment, Karen, in creative containment. Things are permitted here which would never even be //considered// anywhere else. But they always stop just shy of the mark, don't they? They never apply what they learn.\" He sat back in his chair, and sighed. \"I'm going to prove, beyond any shadow of a doubt, that our anomalous inventory is a tool like any other. A weapon to be wielded. McInnis ought to have done the same, he's had five whole years to get good value out of these people, and I'm going to pick up his slack.\"\n\n\"And what about the handover?

They're almost all invulnerable, did you know that? Somehow virtually every item in our database is anomalously resistant to destruction. That's part of the reason the DeD doesn't take requests lightly; it takes an awful lot of time and effort to figure out how to trash an SCP.\" The DeD was the Decommissioning Department. \"For all we know, the Man of the Hour was wearing the armour of the future. We could make it into hyper-flexible Kevlar, or derive some new... antistatic... whatever, from it.\" He waved his own vagueness away, vaguely. \"We won't know until Bremmel gets to work.

More than McInnis knows, and more than you could ever guess.\"\n\nShe decided to push her luck. This was too important to shy away from. She leaned forward, hands clasped in her lap, and said: \"Explain it to me, then.\"\n\nHe fixed his bleary eyes on her again. \"You want me to tell you a story, little girl?\"\n\nShe bit back a frustrated huff. \"I want you to help me understand.\"\n\nBut it was too late for redirection. His expression softened, his eyes unfocused. \"I was a private in the Black Watch in '42. We'd picked up Russia in '41, after Operation Barbarossa -- Hitler doesn't get enough credit for his stupidity, thanks to his other famous qualities -- and that gave us a little leeway for joint operations in the deep continent. A fellow attached to the Canadian Army, such as it was, came by looking for volunteers--\"\n\n\"Wait,\" she said. \"1942? World War Two? How old //are// you?\"\n\n\"I was fourteen,\" he smiled. \"Join-up age was 18. That was the first thing my recruiting officer said to me, before he even said 'hello'. I took the hint; I didn't want to miss the fun, and it looked like it was winding down. Had a hasty training, and they sent me to a camp on the continent where this mystery man was looking for able bodies.\" His wizened features eased further. \"I think, in retrospect, he wasn't looking for the best of the best. We were a screen for what was actually going on.\"\n\n\"Which was what?\"\n\n\"The Germans were getting close to Astrakhan, in Russia, and all we were told was that a strategic asset in the region needed protection. There was a Dr. Davies with the spook, another Canadian, and it was our job to escort him to some random bloody point on the map to make sure the Germans didn't get there first. A matter of some importance, they said, but they didn't say more. They didn't have to, because that's how war works.\"\n\nHe was lost in reminiscence now. \"The target turned out to be a natural spring on the lee of the greenest little hill you ever did see. I saw a lot of mud and rubble in Europe, but this place... you would swear that nothing had ever died there. The liveliest spot in all of God's creation; you might even call it the Grotto of Eden.\" He smiled at his little joke. \"We took Dr. Davies there, facing absolutely no resistance whatsoever, and he started taking samples of the water. Little vials. He ran tests in a tent on the hillside while we bivouacked, swapping tobacco and snuff, writing letters and passing the time with games of makeshift football. The only thing they told us, the spook and the doctor both, was that under no circumstances were we to go near that puddle of water.\"\n\nHe suddenly became aware of her presence again. \"Oh, I should have said at the outset: this information is Overseers-only. If you ever tell a living soul what I've already told you, or anything that comes after, you'll be dead within the hour along with everyone you've spoken to in months.\" He continued, heedless of her shock. \"We camped for six days, only drinking from our rations, no water for anything else. We were always a foul bunch, but we got plenty fouler in the countryside with no way to wash the dirt off. I've always fancied myself a tidy man,\" and he adjusted his cufflinks absent-mindedly, \"and it rather offended my sensibilities that we should be turned into unwashed pigs within spitting distance of such a lovely little pool. On the last day I had very sharp words with Dr. Davies, who told me in no uncertain terms that it was my duty to do what I was told, and not to bother with the itches and the bug-bites and the grime, and I must admit my tolerance for authority rather ran out at that moment.\"\n\nShe found this relatable. \"What did you do?\"\n\n\"I went down to the spring that night, knowing full well we were embarking on the morn, knowing full well they would see me with my clean hair and clean face and know what I had done, and took a bath in their god-damned water.\"\n\nShe smiled. \"I imagine you got in a lot of trouble.\"\n\n\"I got shot in the face.\"\n\nShe stopped smiling. \"What?\"\n\nFalkirk tapped his left orbital bone. \"In one side and out the other. It was the spook; he caught me slinking back to camp, and put one right through my eye. Left me to bleed to death in an abandoned Russian foxhole just down the hill. I don't know what he told the others when the sun came up, but off they marched without me.\"\n\nShe'd quite lost the thread. \"I don't understand. What saved you? The Foundation? Is that how you joined up?\"\n\n\"It's how I joined up, but nobody saved me. The bullet wound healed overnight.\"\n\nA breeze whistled through the air vents as neither of them said anything.\n\n\"The water?\" she said, finally.\n\n\"The water. Davies was with the Suffield Experimental Station in Alberta, doing chemical weapons research.

It was a veritable--\"\n\n\"Fountain of youth,\" she said.\n\n\"Well,\" he shrugged. \"Close enough. I didn't get any younger, but I felt a whole hell of a lot better -- even minus the part where a fatal wound didn't kill me.

They took me in custody, did all sorts of tests, made me tell them everything I knew.\"\n\nShe remembered the long drive in the lonely dark.\n\n\"They picked up Davies on his way back to England, got his side of the story, and within a week Suffield wasn't an army base at all anymore. The Foundation flexed their muscle and took it, lock stock and viral barrel.\"\n\n\"And made Davies stop his chemical research?\"\n\nFalkirk scoffed. \"Hardly. He kept on doing it, and I asked if I could help. I had a strong body and a clear mind, and if they wanted a test subject, well, I was already primed and ready.\"\n\nShe wasn't at all sure what to say about that.\n\n\"Because, you understand, Davies was looking at things the right way 'round.\" He sat forward again, eyes almost pleading for understanding behind the indignation. \"These things we keep under lock and key, they have enormous potential if only we'd put them to use. I'm not talking about the water -- God knows we don't need humans living longer lives -- but the wars we could win, the //order// we could impose, if we put this inventory to work for us...\" He sighed. \"Davies and I were simpatico on the matter, and we set to work bringing the Council around. It took decades, and it's still not done, but... well, they're a patient lot. They can afford to be. Because of what we found, together.\"\n\n\"And you?\" she asked. \"Are you patient too?\"\n\nHe shook his head. \"No, Karen, my patience has rather run out, like the holy water in my veins.

To put a sign on a door was to take symbolic possession, but putting one on the lintel was an assertion of long-term residence. It was, in every respect, a match for the Sectional signage found across the Site. But what was inside...\n\nIt was chaos. There hadn't been time to fab up a lab for Bremmel's new division, so he'd instead moved all his equipment into the disused storage spaces once dedicated to Procurement and Liquidation. The old offices had been blocked up -- nobody wanted to explain why, not even Harold Blank, though perhaps he had his own reasons for recalcitrance now -- but the oblong warehouses full of low-key anomalous tat bought at auction or from private sales and left to moulder away in darkness were eminently available for creative repurposing. A team of techs from J&M had carted in Bremmel's lathes and grinders and presses and mills, and set them up against the walls. A wide array of items once held in Low Yield Storage had been broken out of mothballs, and were now arranged like garage sale offerings on stolen cafeteria tables. The room was wall-to-wall cardboard, and Bremmel seemed intent on filling up the remainder of his space with frantic shouting.\n\n\"DON'T TOUCH THAT!\" The podgy middle-aged man hopscotched between a set of plastic tubs to intercept an orange-vested labourer. The man had what looked to be an empty cardboard box in his arms. \"PUT IT DOWN, PUT IT DOWN! __NO__! ON THE __TABLE__, YOU BUFFOON!\"\n\nKaren watched in bemusement as the man, one 'C. CARTER', gently placed the box where Bremmel had indicated. The scientist brushed back his puffy grey hair and, puffing with exertion, rapped his knuckles against the cardboard. \"Do you have //any idea// what this is?\"\n\nCarter shook his head. \"No, sir, I don't. What--\"\n\nBremmel actually stood up on his tippy-toes -- he was a short and stocky specimen -- and whacked the tech on the side of his head. \"I'm not here to answer your questions! Get out of here, and tell Nascimbeni I don't want you anymore. He can send me brawn with brains, next time.\"\n\nCarter slunk out of the warehouse. Karen gave him a sympathetic smile as he passed her by. She walked over to the table, and pointed at the box. \"What is it?\"\n\n\"What?\" Bremmel blinked his tiny little eyes at her. \"What is what? Oh.\" He glanced where she was pointing. \"It's just a box. I just can't stand the look on that oaf's face, all the time. Moping around.\" His eyes narrowed. \"Then again, the look on //your// face--\"\n\n\"Did you get the items?\" Karen sighed. \"That's all I'm here to ask you.\"\n\n\"Oh, yes, yes!\" Bremmel came alive again, and danced across the room to an orange metal locker undoubtedly purloined from J&M. \"The redcoats brought them in this morning.\"\n\nKaren wasn't sure how Falkirk had convinced Couch to fulfill her end of the bargain early; she certainly wouldn't put it past the hateful old man to renege on the deal. But the proof was clear enough: Bremmel reached into the locker and withdrew a moth-eaten, battered Victorian-era riding cape, cloak, and top hat. He presented them to her proudly. \"Behold! Magic hobo rags.\"\n\nThey smelled like... She actually reached up to plug her nose. \"Disgusting.\"\n\n\"Yes, well, he //did// eat a lot of children while he was wearing them.\" Bremmel placed the items back in the locker, one at a time. \"In any case, I've already run the tests the Director asked for.\"\n\n\"And?\"\n\n\"And I'm pleased to tell you, we were able to identify the fabric to a high degree of accuracy.\" He beamed so hard, his eyes disappeared into the bags of flesh above and below them. \"It's wool.\"\n\nShe nodded. \"And?\"\n\nHis eyes re-emerged as his face fell. \"And what? It's //wool.// He wore woollen clothes. Quite common, the world 'round, in those times. You know.\"\n\nShe counted to three in her head before responding. \"Yes, Dr. Bremmel, I //do// know that. But how about their resilience? Elasticity? Do they stop bullets? Are they resistant to rot? What are their anomalous qualities?\"\n\nHe blinked, and her dread deepened as he took a moment to consider his next words. When they came, they were precisely what she'd been afraid of.\n\n\"They're... wool.\" Bremmel shook his head. \"'Do they stop bullets'.

R&E was a sort of uber-Section managing the Site's labs and collaborative projects, and Mataxas had gotten its top job as a consolation prize when his ghost-searching department had been scuttled at a meeting not very unlike this one. \"Every research team is afraid they'll lose funding or personnel because of this, and we have too many vital projects going right now. It's got to stop.\"\n\nHarry nodded, and smiled; he had voted against Spectrometry and Spectremetry, so he always tried to be extra polite with Mataxas. \"Obviously I'm with the objectors.

It was coming from the Nexus chambers, and she immediately crouched down and began pounding the tiles. There was something in the sound which did not suggest the sad keening of lonely wolves to an invisible moon, but rather something more urgent.\n\nThe next thing she heard was the breach alarm, as the hall turned blood red.\n\n\"Fuck. Fuck!\"\n\nHer radio activated. \"Report!\"\n\nIt was Elstrom, so she ignored it. There was gunfire from ahead, and she pressed her back to the corner. \"Clear?\" she shouted. \"Clear?\" She didn't want to walk into someone's firing line. //Christ, Ana, I really wish you hadn't died--//\n\nThere was a clattering sound, and a handgun skidded across the tiles in front of her. It was covered in blood; she didn't have time to parse this visual before the arm it had probably been attached too came flying past the corner as well, severed near the jumpsuit shoulder seam.\n\nShe rounded the corner, levelled her firearm, and put three bullets into the back of the nearest werewolf. There were three of them -- //there __are__ three of them, total// -- and they were advancing on Holt's crumpled form. She was missing an arm, and most of her face; she was already dead. The other agent, Lewis Bosch, was also on the floor, in several different spreading spots. The door to the werewolf habitat was open, its keycard reader sparking. Carter was cowering against the gurney.\n\n\"The chamber!\" Ibanez shouted, putting a round into each of the other arc-spined monstrosities. The floor was slick with saliva. They hardly seemed to notice the bullets, and they were hunched over such that she couldn't get a shot at their heads. Their legs were all bone; she knew she could hit them, but she didn't think it would do much good.\n\nTo his credit, Carter both understood and obeyed the directive. He dove for Chamber N-13, and slammed one hand over the control panel. She saw him gibbering out an audio code; she waited until his mouth stopped moving to put a bullet right through one canine jaw as the creature turned to attack him. It fell to one side, clutching at its face and roaring in pain and wrath. The door slid open, and Ibanez saw Carter dive through...\n\n...and then fall roughly back out, as the door slammed shut again. He fell into the arms of the second wolf, and she emptied the rest of her magazine into its chest...\n\n...as it stabbed both clawed hands into //Carter's// chest, and tore open his ribcage. He fell to the ground in a puddle of gore, dying without a sound.\n\nIbanez slammed in a second magazine as the two upright creatures turned this way and that, stupidly searching for the source of their minor inconvenience. //Just give me one good shot, you fucking--//\n\nBANG. BANG. BANG. A geyser of blood erupted over the back of the werewolf which had killed Carter, as its head exploded. Before it mercifully hid his messy remains from view, another three shots clustered in the cranium of the other wolf and it, too, fell.\n\nAt the other end of the hall, Morwen Couch lowered her pistol.\n\nIbanez approached, muscles suddenly aching, hands shaking. There was a growl from the surviving wolf, and she began to empty her second magazine into its upturned face...\n\n...but she kept three bullets, and pointed her weapon at the Chief Superintendent of OSAT.\n\nCouch took her finger off the trigger, and raised both hands in a gesture of surrender. \"We're locked down,\" she said. \"Give us elevator access, let us take that thing out of here, and you'll never see us again.\"\n\nIbanez paused. \"Not the only way to never see you again,\" she said through gritted teeth.
