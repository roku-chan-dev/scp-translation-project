The red was going to be just a placeholder but I really liked the rose-colored glasses fall look that it was giving. I am super proud of this one.\n\nSCP-5851 is weird in a very fun way. Reminds me of fanfics I was terrified of people knowing I read in middle school. Telling kids they are 'cringe' for enjoying cringe things is a plague on this society. They're children.

The animation was a lot more involved in this one than my pieces normally are too so this one took me a lot longer than most.\n\nMy internet was down for 71 hours and I had to go to a cafÃ© to download the webpage so I could actually read it in full for reference. So I was still sitting there at home with the raw early-internet-looking webpage with no theme. And yet, I still really liked it, lol.\n\n6032 is wild; I'm always a sucker for big eldritch horrors. There's a lot of very fun imagery in there, too. And some puns.

I also did a biiiiit more of an involved animation than usual because I really got into it. Jeez I'm gonna have to start picking out fun palettes ahead of time it was a lot easier. I know it was an omelet but a fried egg read better in pixel art ð­\n\nI'm normally more of a Paleozoic person than a Mesozoic one but oh boy do I love this SCP. Ty Rex is so silly and I love the whole vibe of it. The room full of enthusiastic scientists not listening to the voice of reason was extremely enjoyable.\n\nI wanted to make absolutely certain I was drawing the juvenile T-Rex accurately(Well, as accurately as I could in the style) so I referenced a bunch of photos of that one very complete fossil of a juvenile and was kinda surprised how raptor-like their faces were! In 20 years after more research is done this is still going to be obviously inaccurate though.

So far so good! I did struggle a bit at the beginning with making everything actually... look okay. Especially with the limited color palette and the plushies popping out of the background enough. But I think it's good enough! I did have a bit of trouble finding stuff to animate here that I could actually do without causing a flare-up in my wrist so the animation on this one is pretty minimal.\n\nSCP-4966 is definitely cheesy sugarwater and I mean that in the best possible way. It has the same vibe those old animations kids on youtube would make of like warrior cats or valve games or whatever back before youtube animation stopped being made in MSPaint. I'm a sentimental bitch and that kind of goofy fun always makes me smile and reminds me of my childhood. I can definitely see it being too goofy and not being everyone's cup of tea but... I like that kind of thing.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-6096 by Tanhony\" hide=\"What do we do now?

Kind of an eerie ghostly mood. Plus I got to learn how to use gradient maps! Ahhh... It's kind of spooky but not overly oppressive.\n\nSCP-6096 has a really really fun vibe. It's scary but not in an outward way. It's hopeless in a sort of peaceful kind of way. Relatively speaking this anomaly isn't really that dangerous or frightening. It kills people, sure, but compared to other SCPs? It's not that much of a threat\n\nBut you can't stop it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+TATTLETALE by JakdragonX\" hide=\"why is the blood blurry?\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[f<image https://i.imgur.com/cGSRahr.gif]]\n[[f>image https://i.imgur.com/J15Da9D.gif]]\n++++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7026447357516549382?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Process Video] | [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7026452245428440325?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Loop Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-2774-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2477 TATTLETALE]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 2744loop.mp4, 2744.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7026452245428440325?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-2744 by Jakdragonx\n\n> **Filename:** TAT.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7026452245428440325?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-2744 by Jakdragonx\n[[/<]]\n-----\nThe color on this was so worth the three days of struggle they look so crisp and cool. I haven't really done pixel art where I've defined HIGHLIGHTS out of darkness rather than the other way around and it ended up being really really fun. I'm definitely gonna have to do that more, haha.\n\nThe timer definitely gave me anxiety and I felt like I was rushing through it the first time. I read it through like three times to make sure I was getting details properly and honestly? It was better the second time through. Which is usually a good sign! I found myself catching all the little hints and noticing things I didn't notice the first time through. It's safe to say I really liked it.\n\n(Also I added two different versions of the gif, one with 2744 to make it easier for offsite people to find and one with the actual title for accuracy(Also also I had to cut out one of the list entries in the loop video audio because It wouldn't fit otherwise but that portion was so perfect to not use ð­))\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-6427 by Fishish\" hide=\"[LAST ACTIVE: 560 MINUTES AGO.]\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/jfws2Xs.gif]]\n++++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7028041310468705542?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Process Video] | [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7028041086249602309?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Loop Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-6427-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6427 SCP-6427]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 6427loop.mp4, 6427.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7028041086249602309?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-6427 by Fishish\n[[/<]]\n-----\nThe loop video I did for this one is my favorite so far I had some fun with it lmao. I got to get all dramatic because! Well, it was fitting. I had to get kinda creative with the anomaly because there wasn't a super great description of it(Which is not a fault of the article at all). I also got a little artistic license with the definition of a \"fetal position\" but I wanted the monster to be REALLY looming over Micheals.\n\nI love this article. It's such a clever idea. I read it after the video log was removed and I actually went back and checked out the video log to check if there was a better description of the anomaly and I definitely agree that it does better without it.

At least for quite a while. But I think it turned out well anyway. It's a bit simpler than the other ones I've done but I think it's fitting. This is definitely an incredible article. Very emotionally impactful with no room for comfort.\n\nI wanted the colors to reflect that.

I think I'm gonna throw in some classics just for flavor if people on TikTok ask for them. Gotta reward engagement or whatever.\n\nPlus, when you do old ones they don't have a lot of stories so you don't have to //explain them//. Which means... I can just yell into a microphone about my //opinion// for the full minute.

I had an idea and ended up asking in the IRC if anyone wanted to be interviewed about their article for a video and [[*user Doctor Fullham]] and one other person responded so I got to do a longer format fun little video ð­.\n\nThis has been really really fun so far but I think the longer format might do better on //Youtube.// Plus then I wouldn't have a time limit to conform to... In the future for interview thingies, I might do the regular explanation video I normally do on Tiktok... then mention the long format interview in the video? Videos over 60 seconds tend to perform poorly and It'd probably get more eyes on the interview in the long run to just mention it in a video that does better lmaooooo. We'll see.\n\nStill, I really like this article! It's got a very somber tone and definitely has a lot to relate to. That kind of frustration when you've worked so hard and gotten //so close/// to being something only for you to fall back in a hole is really //really// common. And it ISN'T about angry birds.\n\nI wanted to do a sunset-y color theme both because... well it's pretty. But *also* because I thought it could represent something. I don't know. Maybe explaining my artistic vision is kind of defeating the point of having it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-5733 by Dysadron\" hide=\"you know I'm not usually a slasher movie person beside scream and THIS\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/CDYFU4Q.gif]]\n+++++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7036436606638738694?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Process Video] | [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7036464540644609285?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1 Loop Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-5733-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5733 SCP-5733] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6733 SCP-6733]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 5733loop.mp4, 5733.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7036436606638738694?lang=en&is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1\n> **Derivative of:** SCP- 5733 by Dysadron\n[[/<]]\n-----\nApparently, I go bonkers on the pixel art for Dysadon articles?

Especially the ones that metamorphosis. Fun fact: moths and butterflies completely liquefy when in the chrysalis and the different parts of them grow separately before re-attaching to each other. //BUT/// they still retain memories from when they were caterpillars.\n\nThis probably just implies that at least part of the nervous system remains intact while the majority of the body turns to soup but... if you have an imagination it could mean something cooler probably. Moths are metal as hell. \n\nAnother one where I interviewed the author!

The gif version of this kinda messed up the colors so I recommend checking out the video versions.\n\nThe first and immediate idea I had for this was that it needed to not be anything directly shown in the actual article. I wanted it to show the //implication//.\n\nI made one of the operatives lean down so the kid could touch the patch on their shoulder. It's such a classic, cute little-kid-meets-a-firefighter pose.

But what had ACTUALLY happened was that in middle school I read a very Christian fanfiction about l4d and one of the characters was scared of cockroaches and at that age, I still thought you could pick things you were scared of so I was like \"I guess I'm scared of cockroaches now\"\n\nThen at one point someone asked me why I was scared of cockroaches and just replied that one time a bunch of them came running out of a box and over my feet in the garage. That had happened way before the fanfiction thing and didn't actually freak me out that much but I was way too embarrassed to say it was something I'd copied from a fucking left 4 dead fanfiction. So... when people asked I kept saying that\n\nBut because I kept saying that over and over again I FORGOT WHY I was doing it originally... but kept pretending to be afraid of cockroaches. This lasted until senior year when I re-discovered that fanfiction and went through all 5 stages of grief at once before eventually collapsing in on myself like a dying star and promising to never speak of this again. Like I'm doing right now. Sorry past me.\n\nAnyways this article's really good. I like that the Agent and the D-Class are familiar with each other. I think it should be done more often. It really gives it some weight to it.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-6747 by Azamo, Placeholder McD, Ralliston, and stephlynch\" hide=\"Still don't know anything about Dr. Bright\"]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/61M8qkH.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7052894208474074374?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-6747-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6747 SCP-6747]\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 6747.mp4, 6747.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7052894208474074374?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-6747 by Azamo, Placeholder McD, Ralliston, and stephlynch\n[[/<]]\n-----\nListen. I LOVE this article. So much so that I read it all the way through like 3 times to make SURE I was explaining it properly STILL didn't get tired of it. Despite that, I'm 99% sure I misunderstood or explained SOMETHING wrong in the video. A 50-second video is not a lot of time to explain such a long article.\n\nI've been lurking for years on this site before joining but even still I somehow never paid attention to any of the content focused on researcher characters so I had to write a book report on these characters to make them recognizable in the drawing. I still know nothing and don't think I accomplished it for anyone besides Clef.\n\nI'm sorry everyone I've failed you. But hey! This is still one of my favorite ones I've done so far. Definitely one of the most involved animations. I think this article deserves it.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-507 by Anonymous, A Spin Around The Library by Dr Whitney\" hide=\"This is great because I like looking at pictures\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/OQPkLm6.gif]]\n+++++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7059617006345096494?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en Process Video] [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-507-pix Artwork Page] | [http://www.example.com SCP-507] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/day-trip Day Trip(Second is bottom of Day Trip)]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 507.mp4, 507.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7059617006345096494?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-507 by Anonymous, A Spin Around The Library by Dr Whitney.\n[[/<]]\n-----\nManaged to squeeze a tale I really like into a video TikTok wanted me to make!\n\nI really liked this story because I mean...

I had no idea what I was doing and got frustrated that dirt had the textured on ALL sides and gave up. Years later I revisited the idea once resource packs became a thing and I was able to get the dirt to look nice. But by that point, it was 1.13 and there were way too many blocks in the game.

They're just easy to draw and fun to animate.\n\nI wanted to try something similar to the familiar black and white clinical-y graphics people use for a while now and the public interaction tone of this article seemed fitting for it! I asked on Twitter whether I should use dithering or not and people really liked the dithering it on a small scale but it did not turn out well in the final piece so I ended up not using it.

There's another spec-bio article I want to draw something for too eventually but I have been pretty busy getting ready for my hand surgery and had to pick one or the other.\n\nSpeaking of surgery, that's happening next Friday and I've got some stuff I need to get done before then so this is going to be the last one of these for a while, at least until after I've healed. I am gonna try and read out some of the articles I've drawn so far in full on youtube though, just to have SOMETHING to do while I'm healing.\n\nStill, I hope I landed on a high note. I love drawing foliage and I kinda went all out for this one. I wanted to semi-accurately portray the species of trees listed(Japanese Red Pine and Silver-leaf Oak) and draw a cute little creature in there.

You know, lol. \n\nI also really like the way the art turned out! I knew I wanted to do a couple of em for different pride flags so I started with this one and just. It looks great and I'm proud of it. \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-2721 by DolphinSlugchugger and kinchtheknifeblade\" hide=\"homestuck\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/jd4USeI.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7109110879618108718?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-2721-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2721 SCP-2721]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 2721.mp4, 2721.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7109110879618108718?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-2721 by DolphinSlugchugger and kinchtheknifeblade\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nAnother thing for pride month! I've been wanting to do this article for a while now and the stars finally aligned.\n\nI like this article a lot. It's nice. I think it's the quintessential \"weird but real\" article that I genuinely really think is the core of SCP content. Idk. I just feel like when people write about their experiences through the lense of an anomaly it just makes writing feel more whole. \n\n I'm probably going in for surgery next Tuesday so this is gonna be the last one of these for a while, I'm afraid (Ofc it's pride month that gets cut short lmfao) but if you're doing art fight I'm gonna be doing that next month and I'd love to have more people to attack!\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-7999 by fabledtiefling\" hide=\"i keep accidentally typing the fault in our stars i'm sorry fable\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/fRglPeg.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7132489217778797867?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7132489217778797867 Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-7xxxfable-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7999 Meet Me In The Stars]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** mmits.mp4, mmits.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7109110879618108718?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-7999 by fabledtiefling\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nThis one's cute. Makes me melancholic. Reminds me of all those people I met while camping as a child who I'll never see again.\n\nI love the characters and basically all of my friends who don't keep up with SCP stuff that I've shown this article had roughly the same reaction about Carteckan & Sias's drawings and the ending. It's good I don't wanna spoil anything else. Just read it.\n\nOne thing though, I will say I am confused as to how Sias has an adult daughter at 30 but I mean. There's a lot of reasons that could be, more so in an SCP article but it did occupy a few brain cells through the whole article because there is not explanation.\n\nidk why but my brain went straight to cryogenic freezing even though there's a dozen less high sci-fi explanations that would make significantly more sense being slipped in without an explanation.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-7007 by grigorikarpin and Vivarium\" hide=\"i like it when there is a funny guy\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/SxXDyMK.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7133602451680185643?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-7xxxvktm-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7007 Misfortune Gorge]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** vktm7k.mp4, vktm7k.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7133602451680185643?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en \n> **Derivative of:** SCP-7007 by GrigoriKarpin and Vivarium\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nI like this article because it is funny, I like announcer characters, I like VKTM, and also because I hate the foundation. \n\nOkay bye! \n\nActually I will say more. I like long character driven pieces like this and I feel so bad for Echo.\n\nAlso I fucking spent the entirety of the drawing COMPLETELY MISSING the part where Kincaid had grey skin so that's why the time lapse is like that.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-7333 by Zyn\" hide=\"I spent way too long on the bg of this\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/nuqNz2v.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7135087212244290859?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-7xxxzyn-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7333 Business Lizard]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** lizard.mp4, lizard.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7135087212244290859?is_copy_url=1&is_from_webapp=v1&lang=en\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-7333 by Zyn\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nBusiness Lizard, thank you for your advice!

I like the characters(De Santi)  the set up, etc. It reminds me of sky high in some weird vague way if sky high didn't have a shitty weird ending, lol. \n\nI like it! I also like eels, so that helps too.\n\nI kinda got inspired by the fact that the security cameras were mentioned a few times so I did something a little different this time around but not so different that it looks out of place with the others. I feel like it might've been a bit overemphasized but I LIKE IT\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+SCP-7000 by HarryBlank\" hide=\"i like him\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/vIuwZ72.gif]]\n++ [https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7136219725612256558?is_from_webapp=v1&item_id=7136219725612256558 Process Video] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy-7000-pix Artwork Page] | [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/7000anactualcrow Eel Days]\n\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** 7000.mp4, 7000.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://www.tiktok.com/@ironshearss/video/7137684448564284715\n> **Derivative of:** SCP-7000 by HarryBlank\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nThe very deserved SCP-7000! This article was intimidating me for a while cause of how long it is but it's really really good! I love the whole vibe, the characters, and the fact that the MAIN character is designed to be completely unlikable yet still manages to be endearing and make you care about him.\n\nThe anomaly is confusing the get a grasp on at first but as it goes on and on and on it makes more and more sense until suddenly, near the end, you understand perfectly. It's such a nice balance! It's a good article. I like it a lot :)\n\nAlso I put a LOT of trust into this article actually staying in the #1 spot so I wouldn't have to rush and get the video done the day after and I'm glad it worked out. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** deerlogo.png\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://imgur.com/p36pbPn\n\n> **Filename:** ignotayt.avi, ignotayt.gif\n> **Author:** IronShears\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/\n> **Source Link:** https://twitter.com/IronShears/status/1496571382532313088\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
