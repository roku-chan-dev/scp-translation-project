Placement was carefully documented, and was in a location that would not release tension on any belts or damage any documented sections. Testing area was cleared and sealed after placing a steel block in the \"intake\" booth. D-00104 was dispatched to SCP-914, and instructed to turn the key and activate SCP-914.\n\nD-00104 reported that \"the key won't catch\", and the key was observed to turn several times without tightening the mainspring. No activity of any kind was observed from SCP-914 during this time.\n\nMissing gear was replaced with an identical copy, comprised of the same metal (brass) as the original. Steel block re-inserted into the \"intake\" booth, and SCP-914 was activated on the \"1:1\" setting. SCP-914 observed to operate normally, with a slight pause of 3.5 seconds after winding the key. After \"refining\", Output observed to be a solid steel sphere with the same volume as the original steel block. Original gear returned to SCP-914.\n\n//Note: Well, thank god we can at least repair the damn thing if we damage it... assuming we can find what's broken in it. Hell, maybe it's already broken, I don't know... this damn thing hurts my head... - Dr. ██████████//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0101**\n**Name:** Dr. Gears\n**Date:** ██/██/20██\n**Total Items:** Four clockwork pocket watch, belonging to Dr. Gears\n\n**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Small clockwork bird. When the tail is pressed, it produces a robin's call.\n\n**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Toy clockwork train engine.\n\n**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Miniature grandfather clock, fully functional.\n\n**Input:** One gold-plated pocket watch\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Small metal sculpture of a piano.\n\n//Note: It appears there is a high level of randomness when SCP-914 \"refines\" an item. However, it seems to preserve some elements of its original composition, in this example, clockworks. This is not a law, but a high probability. Refine a metal bar, and you're more likely to get a simple metal object than an internal combustion engine. Both, however, are possible. - Dr. Gears//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0102**\n**Name:** Dr. Gears\n**Date:** ██/██/████\n**Total Items:** Three copies of all documentation, photographs, and test logs accumulated in relation to SCP-914.\n\n**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Folder containing all previously entered documents, arranged in chronological order.\n\n**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Hard-bound book containing 400 pages. No diagrams, photos, or other visual aids of any kind are included. The pages appear to be solid black, but microscopic examination shows each page to be covered in approximately twenty thousand characters. The text has no correlation with any known writing style, and is not in a linear format, with \"sentences\" constructed from individual characters spread out between many pages. Each sentence requires an exceedingly complex formula to decode, with each formula unique to each sentence.\n\n//Note: Current decoding work has resulted in two partially translated sentences after 225 work-hours. Item appears to be a record of the internal structure of SCP-914.//\n\n**Input:** One copy of SCP-914 documentation\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Single sheet of paper. Weight is exactly the same as the entered documentation. The sheet appears to be a single page from the entered SCP-914 documentation, however when flipped over to the right, the reverse side is the following page in sequence. When flipped over to the left, the opposite side is the preceding page in sequence. No new documentation is included, but this item is significantly easier to store, if more time-consuming to browse.\n\n//Note: It's screwing with us, you know that right? I don't CARE if it's been proven that it has no self-awareness, this thing is LAUGHING at us! - General ████████//\n\n//Note: There seems to be some difficulty as to the meaning of \"fine\" and \"coarse\" on the settings; the machine appears to be capable of refining input based either on a scale of complexity (loss of entropy accompanied by increase in connectivity between components and/or acquisition of subjective meaning) or of simplification (separation into composite materials and loss of meaning). - Dr. Gears//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0103**\n**Name:** Dr. Grangan\n**Date:** ██/██/████\n**Total Items:** Five adult male cadavers\n\n**Input:** One cadaver\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of human remains.

After long study of the unidentifiable symbols Dr. █████ could identify no commonality with any of the other languages present on the form. The Sumerian contained three words unattested from any known text. The Quenya had its cursing of the IRS interspersed with vituperation of someone or something called \"Morgoth\".\n\n**Input:** One IRS Form 1040 (blank)\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One IRS Form \"MXL\", filled out for the year 35 and with the name given as \"GAIVS IVLIVS CAESAR AVGVSTVS GERMANICVS\" and all monetary amounts given in Roman numerals with the word \"DENARII\" entered afterwards.\n\n-----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 011X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 011X Test Logs\"]]\n\n**Test 914-0110**\n**Name:** Dr. Clopine\n**Date:** 15/08/2009\n**Total Items:** Five 8.5\" x 11'' copies of the //Mona Lisa// printed from an HP Photosmart 3310 All-In-One onto photo paper\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Mona Lisa//\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One pile of shredded photo paper, several pools of ink\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Mona Lisa//\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One 8.5'' x 11\" sheet of plastic, one 8.5'' x 11\" sheet of paper, several pools of ink\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Mona Lisa//\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One 8.5'' x 11\" copy of //Vitruvian Man//\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Mona Lisa//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One 8.5'' x 11\" copy of //Mona Lisa//, painted onto canvas.

Language of the title and the contents were at first unidentifiable, and were later discovered to be an old dialect of Finnish. The contents are written in calligraphy, and more than half the pages are elaborately illuminated with colored inks and gold and silver leaf. Once translated, the contents proved to be identical to the contents of the input material, arranged chronologically. The tome has been radiocarbon dated to the early 11th century C.E.\n\nAnachronistically, a leather pocket is sewn into the inside back cover, and this pocket contains what appears to be a modern compact disc, 10cm in diameter. Data on this disc is encoded by an unknown codec. Attempts to divine the codec and decipher the data are ongoing.\n\n//Note: It's a pity the contents of this tome are classified. It's a piece worthy of any museum. I've never seen such exquisite calligraphy. The illuminations may prove to be the most interesting part of the book, though. They often portray clockworks and related mechanical parts as well as some of the input or output objects; possibly they relate in a direct rather than abstract way to the operation of SCP-914 as described on the illuminated pages. - Dr. von Hildebrandt//\n\n-----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 012X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 012X Test Logs\"]]\n\n**Test 914-0120**\n**Name:** Dr. ██████\n**Date:** 01/06/2014\n**Total Items:** Five small, rectangular pieces of paper, measuring 18x18 cm, with several equations relating to the theory of special relativity written on them in black ink.\n\n**Input:** One piece of paper with certain equations relating to special relativity.\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of wood pulp, and several drops of black ink.\n\n**Input:** One piece of paper with certain equations relating to special relativity.\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Eighteen children's multiplication flashcards.\n\n**Input:** One piece of paper with certain equations relating to special relativity.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One piece of paper featuring diagrams of Pythagoras' five polyhedral elements.\n\n**Input:** One piece of paper with certain equations relating to special relativity.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A ceramic tile with small, black glyphs.

It is unknown whether SCP-914 chose HKD by chance or if it chose this currency due to Hong Kong's prior association with Great Britain, although the fact that it chose to use a note from the pre-handover era lends to the latter theory. Also of note is that HK$100 was, at the time of the test, almost equal in value to the £10 used as an input.//\n\n**Input:** One £10 note\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** Two £5 notes, both from the same year as the input.\n\n**Input:** One £10 note\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** €11.60\n\n//Note: This was, on the day of the test, almost equal to the value of the money used as an input. - Dr. T████//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0151**\n**Name:** Researcher Mason\n**Date:** 26/05/2017\n**Total Items:** Four LEGO X-wing starfighter construction sets, unopened\n\n**Input:** One LEGO X-wing starfighter construction set, unopened\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A heap of molten plastic, wood pulp, and various inks\n\n**Input:** One LEGO X-wing starfighter construction set, unopened\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One LEGO TIE fighter construction set, unopened\n\n**Input:** One LEGO X-wing starfighter construction set, unopened\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A fully assembled LEGO X-wing. Upon further examination, various mechanisms and devices were discovered inside the X-wing, such as electronically operated landing gear, wings, lights, and canopy.\n\n**Input:** One LEGO X-wing star fighter construction set, unopened\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** X-wing flew out of Output booth at 72 km/h and shot heated plasma at any personnel in its way, resulting in ██ casualties.

Closer inspection revealed that much of the internal mass of the battery had been converted into a radioactive isotope of [REDACTED], deriving power from its nuclear decay, with a design very similar to that used in many spacecraft. Object placed into storage.\n\n**Input:**  One lithium-ion battery\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** When the output door opened, air rushed into the output chamber as if a vacuum had been present within. The object is a black cube with two electrical nodes on the top, 15 cm across, and weighing exactly the weight of the input battery plus the air in the chamber. The object is unmarked, with the exception of a small printing on one side, warning users that the object contained antimatter, and advising caution. Antimatter composition of object has not yet been confirmed, but has shown no limit to energy capacity. Object currently under testing.\n\n//Note: I think we should refrain from putting anything with a lot of potential energy into SCP-914 in the future. If the pressure wave from the air had damaged the output, all of Site-██ could have been destroyed. Not a pleasant thought. - Dr. Geralds//\n\n---------\n\n**Test 914-0153**\n**Name:** Dr. Kobylka\n**Date:** 06/05/2017\n**Total Items:** One Crayola brand crayon, standard red color, one Crayola brand marker, standard red color\n\n**Input:** One Crayola brand crayon, standard red color\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One vibrant red crayon, no wrapping or any form of brand mark\n\n//Note: After testing the crayon, the crayon mark seems to radiate heat and light with a red hue. Crayon put in storage for further testing.//\n\n**Input:** One Crayola brand Marker, standard red color\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One marker, no brand mark. Removing the cap reveals a bright red tip. Tip stays bright despite the level of light in the room it occupies.

The thread count is notably high and the surface has a sleek, silky feel, but the mass is unaltered.\n\n**Input:** One of the comforters\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A comforter that has shown moderately anomalous properties. Testing with a few voluntary subjects shows that wrapping them up in the blanket, such that it covers around 80% of their body, results in a sense of security and well-being. Subjects wrapped in it and laid on their back report drowsiness and lose consciousness exactly 300 seconds later. The subject remains unconscious until the blanket is removed, at which point they awaken, reporting a restful sleep. Additionally, during this rest period, minor injuries and afflictions disappear, including scrapes, bruises, and in one case, a nasty cold.\n\n//Note: Well, that's enough from me for tonight.

Appears to have been used heavily and shows scuff marks and discoloration.\n\n**Input:** One green wheel\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One red wheel of identical make and quality.\n\n**Input:** One green wheel\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One unmarked black wheel of almost perfect quality. The outer rubber of the wheels greatly resists wear even with prolonged use, and the center bearing exhibits almost no friction, and was successfully left spinning in a vacuum sealed environment for just under ██ days.\n\n**Input:** One green wheel\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One bearing, suspended by an invisible outer wheel of unknown material. Although invisible, the outer wheel physically exists and appears to use higher-dimensional translations to redirect the force of gravity and propel the object forward at at about half the speed of free fall. The wheel can be easily stopped at low speeds, but gains momentum quickly while unhindered. Prospective researchers should note that under the influence of gravity the wheel will always retain a 1/4mg horizontal force, even while at rest.\n\n//Note: And they say you can't reinvent the wheel. - Dr. Collins//\n**Addendum:** Following the collision of a Class-D personnel with Dr. ████ at ██ mph, all human testing has been suspended until Dr. ████ can come up with proper testing procedures.\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-0156**\n**Name:** Dr. Hadiane\n**Date:** 19/08/2017\n**Total Items:** Three collections of children's toys made from magnets and ball bearings\n\n**Input:** One magnet and bearing set\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A collection of interlocking plastic rods. The tips of each are magnetised.\n\n**Input:** One magnet and bearing set\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A series of magnetic rods and metal balls that appear to be self-replicating and self-assembling. Current structure is a pyramid roughly half a meter wide and tall. This structure shows no other anomalous properties and has been safely contained.\n\n**Input:** One magnet and bearing set\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A fine metal dust that exhibits similar properties to the \"Fine\" result, appearing to resolve itself into crystalline structure. It can be safely molded by hand, with the rough consistency of hot wax, and can be pulled apart without much effort. Class-D personnel who touched the substance barehanded reported a feeling of delight, and continued to play with it even as it encased their hands. Subjects were pulled away without injury and the substance has been contained.\n\n//Note: Well, it certainly seems like a fun little toy to play with, but I'm fairly certain this isn't safe by any metric. - Dr. Hadian//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-0157**\n**Name:** Dr. C.

The device seems to have the capability to use cellular data even while out of range of any cell towers. More testing is required.\n\n**Input:** One Samsung Galaxy phone.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A black, malleable circular disk with a single button on the back. Pressing the button causes a hologram to begin projecting from a small LED-like device on the front. The hologram functions as an operating system for the device, which like the output produced by the Fine setting never loses cellular service. More testing is required.\n\n//Note: I think we should reverse engineer the holographic phone produced by the Very Fine test, it could potentially be an amazing business opportunity if we can figure out how to reproduce it. - Dr. Ahearna//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0158**\n**Name:** Dr. Greer\n**Date:** 30/08/2017\n**Total Items:** Five blank keycards, not loaded with cryptographical access codes.

The card appeared to belong to \"John Doe\" and was filled out with similar generic information.\n\n**Input:** One keycard\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One clearance level five keycard. The card was demagnetized and discarded.\n\n**Input:** One keycard\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One keycard, belonging to a nonexistent company, \"Arwachenzelli\". Upon insertion into a keycard reader, it will cause an immediate short-circuit.\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0159**\n**Name:** Dr. Mason\n**Date:** 07/09/2017\n**Total Items:** Five real-time location beacons, standard Foundation issue.\n//Note: The area above and around SCP-914 was set with receivers before this test. In this test, all directional notation is relative to the central \"Intake\" and \"Output\" booths, i.e., a subject standing at the mainspring is facing \"North\".//\n\n**Input:** One tracking beacon\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Small amounts of various scrap metals and other composite materials of tracking beacons.\n**Path:** Within the first 0.15 seconds, the signal was traced to move 3.41 meters \"North\" before turning exactly 91 degrees. Signal was lost after another 0.3 meters.\n\n**Input:** One tracking beacon\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One tracking beacon, with battery and transceiver unit removed. No other visible damage.\n**Path:** While again initially traveling \"North\" for 3.41 meters, the tracking device remained functional for almost twice the amount of time as the first trial. This path appeared to follow the outer edges of the rectangular main body of SCP 914 before the signal was lost.\n//Note: I wonder if there are set paths that each setting follows. - Dr. Mason//\n\n**Input:** One tracking beacon\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One unlabeled tracking beacon consistent with those used by Canadian counter-terrorist groups.\n**Path:** \"North\" for 3.41 meters. Signal then moves towards one of the \"Southwestern\" outer segments of SCP-914, where it repeatedly follows an equilateral triangle for 0.13 seconds before losing signal. Analysis of received signals shows a new signal retracing a path back to the booths.\n//Note: Seriously, though. What is that first bit Northward for? I've checked the recordings, it does that in every test. Every. Single. One. - Dr. Mason//\n\n**Input:** One tracking beacon\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One apparent tracking beacon,  components consistent with Foundation-specific requirements. Tracking beacon is smaller than standard, with certain unknown components. Testing revealed it to be fully operational, although signal was lost mid-test, as the output ran a different operating system.\n**Path:** \"North\" for 3.63 meters. \"South-southeast\" for 0.7 meters. Accelerates in the opposite direction for four meters before signal cutoff.\n//Note: So, I was talking to a colleague about my testing, and they said that the Fine output sounded familiar. Turns out the smaller beacon and the new OS are both prototypes right now. Guess we end up using them. - Dr. Mason//\n\n**Input:** One tracking beacon\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One thin strip of translucent film, shown to be attachable with static cling. Discovered to be remarkable resilient for its size when D-1126 tore a fingernail pulling it off of the wall of the Output Booth. Currently unreadable.\n**Path:** \"North\" for 3.41 meters. Subsequently appears to reach all parts of SCP-914, although high speeds prevented receivers from accurately tracking the path.\n//Note 1: Well, that was disappointing. At least I got a strip of fancy tape. Hopefully I'll be able to get something out of the prior results. - Dr. Mason\nNote 2: So, turns out if you let that tape stick itself to your hand, you can draw the paths of whatever it recorded. You also draw a legend, and what appears to be a menu screen. I'm going to try to get this put onto a D-Class to preserve my wrists. - Dr. Mason\nNote 3: Wow. So, not only did the new tracker record its own movements, it somehow recorded ALL of the movements. Of EVERYTHING that 914 has worked on over the last three months. I think I've finally gotten 914 to work with us, albeit with a lot of analysis involved. This is amazing. - Dr. Mason\nNote 4: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. I thought it would make sense for ONCE. But no, it had to be messing with us again. One of my interns - sorry, Junior Researchers - found out that, if you superimpose all the paths from the tracker, you get a 3D image of the Foundation logo. It's pretty for art drawn in GPS, but it still makes this whole project meaningless. Piece of [EXPLETIVE DELETED] doesn't follow set paths. It does whatever it wants. - Dr. Mason\nNote 5: Dr. Mason has been placed on psychological leave due to apparent stress. Junior Researcher Chen has taken over.

In spite of its ability to communicate, the head appears to lack true sentience, instead repeating back phrases taught to it and a few other basic English sentences.\n\n//Note: About what I expected. I could be mistaken, but it would appear that even though SCP 914 is a mechanical device, machine code is still somehow understood by it.

Upon further inspection, the music had been replaced with five tracks of complete silence, followed by the first chapters of the audiobooks //Learn to Sing 101// by Karen Surmani, //Teach Yourself to Play Guitar// by David Brewster, and //Songwriting for Dummies// by Dave Austin, et al.\n\n//Note: At this point, Dr. Hertz was restrained and firmly escorted out of Research Cell 109-B for attempting to damage SCP-914 and yelling about \"the [EXPLETIVE] what thinks it's being [EXPLETIVE] funny!\" He has been temporarily suspended from the SCP-914 research program for unprofessional behavior.//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-0182**\n**Name:** Dr. Rook, Technician █████\n**Date:** 10/03/2018\n**Total Items:** One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical pocket watch, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).\n\n//Note: The previous tests done with mechanical parts and code sections by Dr. Hadian and Researcher Mikk intrigued me. - Dr. Rook//\n\n**Input:** One manuscript of a Javascript program (self-learning chatbot), one manuscript of a Javascript program (Convolutional Neural Network model), one mechanical aluminum & silver pocket watch, one USB, one photo of a bird (Pica sericea).\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A mechanical bird roughly the size of a large pocket watch. Resembled a Korean Magpie in shape. The bird seemed to be made with a mix of clockwork and realistic metal plumage. By some unknown mechanism, it could hover for brief periods (roughly 45 seconds) in the air, though its base material- aluminum and silver- should’ve prohibited it from doing so. It could not speak in this form, though it displayed considerable intelligence and responded to people speaking to it. When connected to a computer via USB cable, the bird was able to speak through the computer’s speakers. It was capable of speech comparable to an eight-year-old child’s, though speech patterns significantly improved after several conversations. It acted remarkably similarly to a live magpie. Other than the mechanical bird, three folded sheets of blank paper were found in the output chamber. Close analysis revealed that they had no anomalous properties. Placed in item storage.\n\n//Note: I’m keeping the bird for some more research into how 914 could be used to create automated objects. One of the first tests recorded included a clockwork bird, so that’s where this came from. Dr. Hadrian was right! Think of the possibilities! - Dr. Rook.//\n\n//Note: No matter how much Dr. Rook's 'Robbie' resembles a young child during communication, the result of this test has not yet been verified to be fully sentient.//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-0183**\n**Name:** Dr. Joe\n**Date:** 13/03/2018\n**Total Items:** Three White Paper origami swans weighing 29g each.\n\n**Input:** One Paper swan\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One Crumpled piece of white paper weighing 29g\n\n**Input:** One Paper Swan\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One Paper \"fortune teller\" popular with young schoolchildren with no writing on it weighing 29g.\n\n**Input:** One Paper Swan\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One paper model of //Cygnus buccinator// (trumpeter swan) the size and mass of the original Origami swan. However this model is entirely anatomically correct to //Cygnus buccinator// in every way, with some organ systems being made of seemingly impossibly thin layers of paper. The model displays no anomalous properties.\n\n//Note: Interesting. 914 created a model of my personal favorite species of swan from the original paper one. Sentience or coincidence? I need to do more tests, but first make sure that model is saved in Fragile Non-Anomalous Item Storage, it could be useful at a later date. - Dr. Joe//\n\n-----------------------------\n\n**Test 914-0184**\n**Name:** Dr. O’Bryan\n**Date:** 25/03/2018\n**Total Items:** Three different pieces of communication on paper medium.\n\n**Input:** One typed thesis, titled “An Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Corrosive Liquids”, as submitted by D-914-29.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One typed thesis, titled “A Complete Experimental Study on the Stress Limits of Metals in Various Environments”.  A review of the output by the subject and subsequently studied by appropriate personnel revealed no anomalous properties.  The output contains research on several experiments not included in the original input, with suggestions on how to vastly improve the strength of metals in a wide variety of situations.  A review of the output is being conducted by the Facilities and Engineering Department to test to see if these findings can improve security within the Foundation.\n\n**Input:** One page of sheet music from “Ellen’s Third Song” by Schubert, as submitted by D-914-86.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Tiny (5cm x 5cm x 2cm) origami music box.  Upon opening the box, a clear melody identified as the song “Ellen’s Third Song” could be heard by all researchers in the area facility, including those who should be well out of range of being able to hear.  Subject D-914-86 began singing along with the music, despite not showing any previous indication of knowing either Latin or taking singing lessons.  After the conclusion of the piece, subsequent experiments confirmed that she could not sing.\n\n**Input:** One copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie, as submitted by D-914-77.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One slightly warmer copy of “How to Win Friends and Influence People”.  D-914-77 was sent back to their cell and monitored, showing no anomalous behavior after a week of review.\n\n//Note: D-914-77, and two guards have been reported as missing.  Security footage shows the guards opening several doors and escorting D-914-77 off the premises, and driving them to a nearby restaurant.  When a security team was sent there to retrieve the subject, a conflict began between the patrons of the restaurant and the security team, with the patrons refusing to allow the security team close to D-914-77.  An order was given with O4 clearance to destroy the location, as a possible memetic anomaly may have occurred.  Although the remains of D-914-77 have not been positively identified, security footage suggests that no one escaped the building prior to its demolition.  Local media have been alerted to the fact that the destruction was caused by a broken gas main in the restaurant's kitchen.//\n\n//Note: A full memetic screening will be made whenever media provided by SCP-914 is consumed.

No harmful effects were found, though Prof. Snider noted it \"smelled like burning hair\".\n\n**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Pile of waxy, crystalline orange granules with a mild orange scent. Chemical analysis identified it as flavored sucrose, A.K.A. rock candy. When tasted, granules were found to have an extremely unpleasant flavor described as \"overwhelmingly, disgustingly sweet with an alcohol-like undertaste\".\n\n**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 500mL of orange liquid with the viscosity of water. Extremely greasy to the touch, became sticky when dried. Smelled mildly of peanuts.\n\n**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A frozen block of SCP-999 slime. Attempting to melt back to liquid form resulted in a pile of orange sludge much thicker and more adhesive than before. Further heating resulted in discovering its napalm-like qualities.\n\n**Input:** 500mL sample of SCP-999\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A small, spherical blob of translucent, azure-colored slime roughly 12cm in diameter, with a strong garlic-like odor. Found to be mobile and sentient, and capable of making gurgling, chirping vocalizations similar to SCP-999 but at a much deeper pitch. The entity, designated \"E-999-A\", was immediately hostile to all staff, attempting to either leap upon researchers' faces or \"headbutt\" their shins via rolling across the floor at high speed, though its small size and mass prevented it from doing more than mild bruising.\n\n**Addendum:** E-999-A was eventually contained and presented to SCP-999, with the assumption that this was its \"offspring\", and that SCP-999 could teach it to become more docile. SCP-999 instead reacted with immediate hostility, attacking E-999-A with its pseudopods while E-999-A rolled around SCP-999, emitting loud \"growling\" and \"snarling\" noises while dodging. SCP-999 finally eliminated E-999-A roughly two minutes later via engulfing it with two pseudopods, rapidly dissolving E-999-A inside its body similar to how SCP-999 digests its meals.\n\nNo change in SCP-999's color or demeanor following the incident has been noted, however, it is the first and thus far only time that SCP-999 has ever reacted to anything with hostility or violence. Mentioning E-999-A to SCP-999 results in it immediately \"ignoring\" whoever speaks to it, often by wandering off to play with a nearby object or person. Further research involving SCP-999's slime is temporarily suspended save for researchers with at least Level 3 clearance, and any experiments involving SCP-999 and SCP-914 are completely prohibited.\n\n//Note: Prof. Snider is currently facing disciplinary action due to violation of biological safety protocol. The next one I catch is losing their clearance indefinitely. - Dr. Veritas//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0197**\n**Name:** Dr. Pattinson\n**Date:** 27/04/2018\n**Total Items:** A pencil and a sketchbook.\n\n**Input:** A pencil and a sketchbook; first page has the word \"mouse\" hand-written on it\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A pencil and a sketchbook; first page has a drawing of the cartoon character Mickey Mouse.\n\n**Input:** A pencil and a sketchbook; second page has the word \"Bird\" hand-written on it.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A pencil and a sketchbook; second page has a drawing of the cartoon character Tweety from the Looney Tunes.\n\n**Input:** A pencil and a sketchbook; third page has the word \"Girl\" hand-written on it.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A pencil and a sketchbook; third page has a detailed drawing of a young girl smiling accompanied by the aforementioned cartoon character Tweety and Mickey Mouse.\n\n//Note: Dr. Pattinson requested to temporarily stop the testing and was visibly distressed. Pattinson claimed it resembles his deceased daughter who enjoyed the characters. After a while, he insisted to continue after recollecting himself.//\n\n**Input:** A pencil and a sketchbook; fourth page has \"914\" hand-written on it.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A heavily used pencil and a sketchbook; The rest of the pages of the sketchbook were drawn on to create a flip-book style animation of gears turning.\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0198**\n**Name:** Dr. Hadian\n**Date:** 28/04/2018\n**Total Items:** Tax form 1040a (blank).\n\n**Input:** Aforementioned tax form\n**Setting:** Very fine\n**Output:** A crumpled-up piece of paper. Dr. Hadian reported rapid-onset migraines on attempting to retrieve it, possibly due to anomalous properties.\n\n**Input:** Previous output.\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A fine spray of sawdust, along with an unidentified black smoke that dissipated quickly. Remains showed no anomalous properties.\n\n//Note: That was cathartic. - Dr. Hadian//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0199**\n**Name:** Dr. Naismith\n**Date:** 29/04/2018\n**Total Items:** One credit card and one piece of paper.\n\n**Input:** Dr. Naismith’s credit card\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A similar credit card covered with a series of unidentified corporate insignias and the phrase “RANK-ALEPH INFINITE MONEY PRIVILEGES.”\n\n//Note: Dr. Naismith, I didn’t think I need to remind you that SCP-914 is not to be used for personal financial gain, but it seems I was wrong. Consider this an official warning. -Dr. Coltrane//\n\n**Input:** A printout of the above note from Dr. Coltrane\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A printout of a note reading “Dr. Naismith, I didn’t even think of using SCP-914 for personal financial gain, but that seems like a solid idea. Consider this official permission to reap the fruits of your labor. -O5-11”\n\n//Note: Guess I have no choice but to keep the new card. I have written permission on file if anyone has any questions. -Dr. Naismith//\n\n-----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[/experiment-log-914/offset/1 Notice: Continued in 02XX ->]",
