I'm an author with a huge case of imposter syndrome, but was finally convinced to make an author's page in order to make getting my tags on the discord easier.\n\n\n--The name comes from Beerswain, which should be my username, if I ever get brave enough to change it on the wiki. Otherwise, I am [[*user DrScaramouche]].--\n\nedit: Fuck it. Long Live Scaramouche MD.\n\nedit #2: Did you know strikethrough doesn't work in page titles? Now you do!\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab 144-Hour Jamcon 2 (2020)]]\n\n**Themes**: EXPLOSIONS / Delicious / More Than Meets The Eye\n**Podiums**: Third, //Theme 3 Top Tales//\n\n------\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-manual-list= --]\n|name=Focus\n|background-image=\n|language=en\n|shadow=\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-manual-list= --]\n|name=Ambrose DC Restaurant Week\n|background-image=\n|language=\n|shadow=\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:mega-cool-author-page-tool |inc-manual-list= --]\n|name=Secure Cybertron Protocols Administration\n|background-image=\n|language=\n|shadow=\n]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab 11th Art Exchange (2022)]]\n\n//Written/filmed for [[*user ThatGuyThatTime]].
