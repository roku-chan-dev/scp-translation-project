Sampling of SCP-8103's bark, leaves, and fruit confirm that the tree itself is non-anomalous.\n\nSCP-8103's anomalous effect occurs towards any persons who are experiencing marital or relationship troubles. When any persons who meet this criteria place their palm against SCP-8103 for a period of ten seconds, they will be affected by a cognitohazard that results in them experiencing a moment of clarity, followed by them immediately seeking out ways to make amends in their marriages/relationships.\n\nCommonly documented effects of SCP-8103's cognitohazard include:\n* The signing up for couples and/or marriage counselling services;\n* The buying of expensive and/or lavish romantic gifts;\n* Marriage proposals;\n* The planning of \"romantic getaways\" or \"second honeymoons\";\n* Restructuring of relationships into more \"open\" variants;\n* Reinvigoration of self-care methods;\n* and emotional \"opening ups\".\n\nSCP-8103 has led to a marked decrease in divorce rates and break-ups within the Bronx borough of New York City.\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8102]]] | SCP-8103 | [[[SCP-8104]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** linden.jpg\n> **Name:**Linden Tree, Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, NY - September 16, 2012\n> **Author:** Marty Aligata\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Linden_Tree,_Woodlawn_Cemetery,_Bronx,_NY_-_September_16,_2012.jpg\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
