They had not hearts of flesh, but hearts of stone;\n\nCold, relentless, remorseless.\n\nThose who still stood to fight took aim with their rifles. Orange light danced across their eyes.\nㅤ\nㅤ\n//**Bang.**//\nㅤ\nㅤ\n\n------\n\nㅤ\nㅤ\nThe Austro-Hungarians had extended their hands in peace, they had expected the same from the Russians: Humanity.\nㅤ\nㅤ\n\n------\n\nㅤ\nㅤ\nClank.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nWhirr.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nClank.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nWhirr.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nNo other sound remained apart from the marching of soldiers.\n\nAnd as the snow swirled around them in the cold winter air, the soldiers kept up their tireless march towards Vienna, stepping over the bodies of the slain.\n\nAll but one. A lone soldier stopped, kneeling down over the lifeless body of an enemy. He reached inside the man’s vest with a cold metal hand, and pulled out a paper postcard.\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\nㅤ\n//“December 25th, 1914.
