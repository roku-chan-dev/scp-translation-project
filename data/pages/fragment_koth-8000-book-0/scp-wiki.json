  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-8027\n\n**Object Class:** Eparch[[footnote]]object is related to the anomalous, but is not itself an anomaly[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** The original copy of SCP-8027 is in secure storage at [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-12 |Site-12]]]'s Library. A translated digital copy (currently without illustrations) is attached to this file, and physical copies may be obtained from most on-site libraries with the proper clearance.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8027 is an illuminated manuscript retrieved from Timeline DOTC-8000 by [[[time-machine-en |Robert Madden, Ann Barlowe, and Ra.aic]]] after a malfunction of [[[SCP-6172]]]. Though it superficially resembles texts from the medieval period, the book itself is relatively new. All text within is written in [[[second-hytoth-hub |Ortothan]]], which, due to that language's anomalous properties, is virtually identical to the form of Ortothan presently spoken in this universe.\n\nSCP-8027's text is a story[[footnote]]full title unknown; the cover was damaged during Madden, Barlowe, and Ra's return to baseline, leaving only the words \"The Lord of the\" intact[[/footnote]] that purports to be a true account of historical events in its native timeline. This claim is dubious, but the story also features accurate depictions of known anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena, thus necessitating its containment. Of greater import are its various appendices, which describe the history and geopolitics of Timeline DOTC-8000's North America, circa the 29th century AD.\n\n**Addendum 1:** Nature of Timeline DOTC-8000\n\nFrom the contents of SCP-8027 and the testimony of Madden, Barlowe, and Ra, the following information about the timeline has been gleaned:\n\n* At some point in the late 20th or early 21st century, the world suffered an IK-Class \"Collapse of Global Civilization\" Scenario now remembered as \"The Great Breach\". Religious texts report that this event was precipitated by a conflict between the SCP Foundation and multiple Groups of Interest,[[footnote]]potentially an Eighth Occult War[[/footnote]] which led to an escalating series of containment breaches and eventually the death of most of the human population. Inhabitants of Timeline DOTC-8000 account time in AB (\"After Breach\") and refer to pre-Breach civilizations as \"The Ancients\".\n* In the wake of the Great Breach, remnants of the SCP Foundation apparently reorganized as a religious institution in order to preserve knowledge of anomalous phenomena and containment procedures thereof. In the present day, mythologized versions of historical Foundation personnel are still worshipped as saints or gods, and a theocracy descended from the present-day Foundation still rules the eastern United States. This is consistent with a successful implementation of Contingency 1981-Sebeok.\n* In most regions, scientific knowledge, political and economic structures, and general standard of living loosely resemble those extant in baseline Eurasia between the 5th and 15th centuries, though exact conditions very considerably from place to place. While most modern technology was destroyed in the Great Breach, a multi-century regression to Medieval standards also indicates a substantial loss of scientific and philosophical knowledge. It is possible that the Great Breach altered the human noosphere in a way that prevented the reconstruction of a more modern civilization, and/or that the pseudo-Medieval status quo is or was a deliberate affectation by the Foundation or other groups.\n\n**Addendum 2:** Plot Summary\n\nThe novel-length story within SCP-8027 is presented as the personal account of one Princess Geva of Arnven, as adapted by \"the Eighteenth Wanderman of Gormogon, Royal Scribe to Her Majesty Fortepiano III, Secretary-Empress of the German Occidental Confederation\". Princess Geva is described as a street urchin native to the Free City of Arnven, who was unexpectedly promoted to a position of royalty when she displayed \"sorcerous talents\" akin to those of a hero from Arnven's past. The story begins with Geva's dereliction of her royal duties and flight to another Free City, Utgard, from whence she then embarks on a quest to the cursed island of Uk alongside five companions of varying backgrounds and characteristics. The stated goal of this quest is to slay Marscar the Dark, a three-headed dragon said to hoard all the wealth of the Ancient world, and take its treasure.\n\nThe characters in this story embody recognizable archetypes, and the general outline of the quest closely follows the archetypal Hero's Journey. Consequently, the narrative is not believed to be nonfictional, but rather a mythologized or greatly embellished fabrication designed to fancifully explain historical events, impart a moral lesson, and/or simply entertain the reader. Though the story has consequently been deemed of little research value, a translated digital copy is nonetheless provided below for those interested. Readers may wish to consult Addendum 3 for useful context before continuing, or to reference it for clarification at relevant points in the story, though this is not utterly necessary.\n\n[[=]]\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8027/offset/1 GO TO DIGITAL COPY]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Addendum 3:** Appendices\n\nAs SCP-8027 was seemingly written for a European audience unfamiliar with Timeline-DOTC-8000's America, the book includes appendices that provide extensive background information about the contemporary (approx. 800 AB) geopolitics of North America, which are currently believed to also be factually accurate to Timeline DOTC-8000. Such information is therefore of considerable use in the modeling of post-apocalyptic scenarios, the prediction of future events, and the refinement of K-class scenario contingency plans. The contents of these appendices are summarized below. Due to the dubious historicity of SCP-8027's actual narrative, the changes to this status quo described therein have been omitted.\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab The Holy Foundation]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** Eastern United States, bounded by the Mississippi River to the west and the Canadian border to the north. \n\n**System of Government:** Feudal theocracy led by 13 Overwatch Cardinals. Local government is predominantly secular, but all officials are expected to defer to Overwatch's authority. Though localities maintain their own militias, the Mobile Legions of professional soldiers that serve as the nation's primary military force answer directly to the Foundation.\n\n**Summarized History:** Supposedly founded by surviving Foundation personnel immediately after the Great Breach, though heavy mythologization of early history makes this claim difficult to verify. The current power structure was codified in 300 AB with the deposal of the Archministrator, a king-like position that would have served as the primary landholder and a secular equivalent to the Overwatch Cardinals, who now wield its powers in addition to their own. In 709 AB, the existing Overwatch Cardinals were again overthrown by a \"Neutralizationist\" faction that took a more extreme stance in favor of exterminating and destroying anomalies instead of merely containing them. The Holy Foundation has waged war on all of its neighbors to varying degrees of success, and it is currently being invaded by the Thereven Khanate. The ongoing invasion, coupled with prior military and territorial losses and multiple internal schisms, has sent the Foundation into a period of rapid decline.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** Foundation doctrine maintains an extremely conservative but somewhat contradictory stance toward anomalous phenomena. Euclid- and Keter-class objects are typically referred to as \"Expunged\" and regarded as monsters or demons, while Safe-class objects are more often described as \"Relics\" and involved in religious rites. The Foundation ruthlessly persecutes thaumaturgists, ontokinetics, and other anomalous humanoids as \"witches\" or the like. The social strata of the Holy Foundation also includes \"D-caste,\" a population of enslaved criminals and their descendants used as slave labor, conscripted soldiers, and containment apparatus by the Foundation.\n\n**Relevant Anomalies:**\n* **Poison Words** and **Warding Patterns** - esoteric artistic techniques practiced by the Foundation's knightly orders that, by their descriptions in the text, appear to be verbal and visual memetics, respectively. Knights who employed them were often held in fear and suspicion, an attitude that eventually led to the near-abandonment of the practice.\n* **Holy Water** - a liquid that can reportedly \"cleanse the mind of consecrated information\". This description seems to indicate an amnestic effect, though it is unclear how the Holy Foundation could be producing genuine amnestics without access to [[[SCP-3000]]] or modern technology. It has been theorized that the holy water would be administered as part of a religious ritual to induce placebic amnesia, though there is little evidence in the text to support this.\n* **Scrantonum** - a dark red, glowing metal that inhibits \"sorcery\" - what appears to the Holy Foundation's term for ontokinetics - and possibly also thaumaturgy. Ongoing attempts to replicate this highly useful material suggest that it may be an alloy of [[[SCP-148]]] and [DATA EXPUNGED]. Allegedly, the Holy Foundation depleted its last stores of the material in combat with the Witch of Arnven.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Free Cities League]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** Five enclaves within the Holy Foundation; Arnven, Fenrys, and Utgard are thought to be in the approximate locations of Memphis (TN), Detroit (MI), and Portland (ME), respectively, but the locations of Eridar and Necramundas are unclear from the text.\n\n**System of Government:** Each Free City is an independent city-state that seceded from the Holy Foundation, allied loosely with the other four as a matter of mutual military and economic protection. Arnven is governed by a council of elected representatives from four social classes (merchants, soldiers, clergy, and nobility), but it is not known if the other cities follow this model.\n\n**Summarized History:** Arnven gained independence from the Holy Foundation in 710 AB, when the Witch of Arnven, after distinguishing herself as a hero in [[[the-horn-blows-into-the-morning |a war against the sentient animals of Romania Nova]]], led the city in [[[the-siege-looms-heavy-part-one |rebellion]]] against a Foundation force sent to contain her. The other cities, inspired by Arnven's example and their own grievances with the Foundation, followed suit over the next two decades, facing varying degrees of resistance from the Foundation. Utgard is an exception; it originally seceded from the Foundation during the Chaos Insurrection and refused to reintegrate after the civil war's conclusion. Independence from the Holy Foundation has somewhat protected the Free Cities from its difficulties, but the Thereven Khanate makes no distinction; it has already conquered Fenrys, and an impending attack on Arnven was described in SCP-8027\n\n**Culture & Religion:** Though the Free Cities still practice the Foundation religion, they no longer recognize the authority of the Overwatch Cardinals. Disagreement with the ruling Neutralizationist faction has made the Free Cities havens for exiles, outcasts, and enemies of the Foundation, as well as hotspots for crime, gambling, and other activities of which the Foundation disapproves.\n\n**Significant Anomalies:**\n* **The Witch of Arnven** - a possible Type Blue or Green who defended the city of Arnven against an invasion by Romania Nova and led its rebellion against the Holy Foundation. The Witch is Arnven's most significant folk hero, and legends claim that she will return to aid the city in its time of greatest need. She is named in tales as \"Sigurros,\" indicating a possible relationship to [[[SCP-239]]].\n* **The Great Dragon** - a legendary monster resembling a monstrous alligator or serpentine whale, this creature has been tentatively and controversially identified as [[[SCP-682]]]. It was supposedly slain during the Great Breach by Saint Clef, with the assistance of a mysterious \"Sir Fish,\" though the only remaining evidence of this supposed great deed is an immense severed horn now housed in one of Arnven's temples. The Horn of the Dragon was instrumental in Arnven's victory over the animals of Romania Nova, in whom its awful roar instilled an instinctive and violent response.\n* **Necramundas School of Wizardry** - in 769 AB, the Serpent's Hand founded an organized school of thaumaturgy in the city of Necramundas, which was the second of the Free Cities (behind Arnven) to legalize the open practice of magic. Over the next seven years, the school attracted hundreds of students from the Free Cities, Foundation, and Kannada. However, it was forced to close when an unspecified magical disaster claimed the lives of what would have been its first graduating class. The lakeside castle that once housed the school now stands abandoned and supposedly haunted by ghostly music and apparitions of \"faceless children\".\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Thereven Khanate]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** American Midwest, bounded by the Canadian border and the Mississippi and Ohio rivers. Western and southern extent unknown. Land between the Great Lakes and the Ohio River was recently taken from the Holy Foundation.\n\n**System of Government:** Hereditary, tribute-based monarchy currently ruled by [[[horseback |Great Khan Angelo Thereven]]], though his wife Sarah Bumaro and representatives from several allied or conquered peoples (\"Dagonite reptile-riders,\" \"the subjugated Ion cult,\" \"Wisconsin tribes,\" and \"the Sublime City of Gary\") also seem to play an uncertain but important role in government.\n\n**Summarized History:** The Khanate seems to have originated in the Dakotas with the Iron Cavalry, a nearly-unstoppable force that quickly subjugated or eradicated most groups it came into contact with. The expanding Khanate made contact with the Holy Foundation in the late 790s AB, when it began to invade and conquer the Midwest. The invasion has been stalled for over a year by the Iron Cavalry's inability to cross the Mississippi River (named in-text as the Heilas) or Appalachian Mountains. Most of the ongoing fighting is in western Pennsylvania, where the horde is attempting to break through Foundation defenses and sack the large cities in the eastern half of the state.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** Though individual component groups such as the \"subjugated Ion cult\" presumably practice other religions, the dominant practice is a semi-animistic shamanic tradition that includes veneration for ancestral spirits, several of which (such as Dagon) appear to have been pre-Breach Foundation personnel. The most revered among these ancestors is Cole Thereven, supposed founder of the Khanate.\n\n**Related Anomalies:**\n* **Iron Oxen** - a breed of [[[SCP-6854]]] specialized for warfare. Their high speed, omnivorous diet, and naturally-occurring firearms make iron oxen ideal mounts for long, swift, and brutally effective military campaigns. However, their wheeled feet and susceptibility to rusting have thus far prevented the Iron Cavalry from crossing major rivers or mountain ranges. The Iron Cavalry is said to feed the bodies of its fallen enemies to their mounts, for the dual purposes of instilling a \"thirst for blood\" and harvesting the animals' coal excrement to burn for warmth or steel-smithing.\n* **Horned Horrors** - one or more species of ceratopsian dinosaur (presumably brought to Timeline DOTC-8000's present by [[[SCP-5745]]] or one of many similar anomalies) used by the Dagonite reptile-riders as living siege engines. Equipped with howdahs, armor, and sharpened horn covers, these mighty beasts can trample whole units of soldiers, ram down gates and fortifications, and provide a sturdy platform for archers and commanders. They are less feared than the Iron Cavalry only because they are fewer in number and more difficult to deploy, due to their immense and highly specific nutritional requirements.\n* **The Wandering City of Indeen** - the capitol city of the Khanate, Indeed is described as “a whole flock of buildings of every shape and size, walking on the legs of colossal chickens\". Given the ease with which they can be produced, maintained, and domesticated, it is highly plausible that these reported mobile structures are instances of [[[SCP-3168]]].\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Kannada]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** southeastern Canada\n\n**System of Government:** Unclear; possibly a loose alliance of tribal nations. The September Shamans wield great religious but little political authority.\n\n**Summarized History:** Though Contingency 1981-Sebeok was also enacted here, the importance of [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-43 |Site-43]]] to Foundation operations in Canada and that site's unusual approach to containment produced a very different result. When the Holy Foundation was formally established, Kannada refused to acknowledge the authority of the Overwatch Cardinals and instead appointed its own at Site-43. It has remained mostly independent ever since.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** Over the centuries, Kannada's development has been strongly influenced by the entities of Nx-94, with which its people are strongly allied, and by the associated First Nations cultures. These entities, which now range widely across much of the Great Lakes region, have thus far thwarted all large-scale invasions of Kannada, allowing it to remain neutral in the Thereven-Foundation conflict. The local, highly-syncretized version of the Foundation religion primarily reveres the members of MTF Sampi-Pi (\"See You in September\"), known simply as \"The Seven\".\n\n**Relevant Anomalies:**\n* **The Lesser Breach** - Though all members of MTF Sampi-Pi (\"See You in September\") are presumably long-dead, containment of [[[SCP-5243]]] is nonetheless maintained by shamans who train rigorously to fill their roles during the annual breach. Kannada also possesses markedly more advanced technology than the other American nations, due to limited reverse-engineering of modern objects from the perpetually-preserved Facility AAF-D.\n* **Tiamat, Five-Headed Dragon-Goddess of the Salt Sea** - in tandem with the immortal Saint Corbin Dragonrider, [[[SCP-5866]]] acts as a fickle but fearsome protector goddess of Kannada. She made Newfoundland her domain in the 500s after eradicating the Valravn colony there, and has since populated the island and its surrounding waters with monstrous draconic offspring. These creatures have rendered the Labrador Sea nearly impassable.\n* **Mishepeshu** - The Great Lakes still host a substantial population of [[[SCP-5494]]], with whom the people of Kannada are closely allied. Although they briefly tolerated the Valravn Rus', the water panthers swiftly eradicated the marauders after their interactions with Kannada become violent. Mishepeshu have likewise prevented any large-scale hostilities towards Kannada by the Foundation in or around the Great Lakes.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Valravn Rus']]\n\n**Approximate Location:** Newfoundland, Great Lakes region (formerly)\n\n**System of Government:** Alliance of clans paying tribute to a mysterious High Table\n\n**Summarized History:** For the first 500 years after the Great Breach, there was no contact between North America and Europe. The technology and navigational techniques necessary for reliable oceanic crossings had apparently been lost, and the Atlantic had become so populated with marine anomalies that no attempted crossings ever returned. However, in 501 AB, several groups of colonists from the \"[[[valravn-corporation-hub |Valravn Clans]]]\" arrived on the eastern coast of Kannada, having made their way there from Greenland. The colonists were initially friendly and enjoyed good relations with the people of Kannada, with whom they traded exotic goods from Europe. More Valravns repeated the journey each year, until Newfoundland came to sport a sizeable colony and a chain of trading posts that stretched up the St. Lawrence River and across the Great Lakes region, where they also engaged in trade with the Holy Foundation and the predecessors of the Thereven Khanate. Relations soured within the century as the Valravns, bolstered by their increasing numbers and magical weaponry manufactured in Europe, took up raiding along the east coast and the shores of the Great Lakes. This violent period ended when, after a failed attack on Site-43 itself, the September Shamans called upon Tiamat to destroy the Newfoundland Colony. Most Valravn presence in the Great Lakes was subsequently wiped out by vengeful mishepeshu, but survivors of these attacks went on to establish the cities of Fenrys and Utgard in Foundation territory.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** Valravn religious practices seem to have been derived from Norse paganism, but they placed a significantly greater emphasis on warfare, death, and conquest, even incorporating relevant deities from other historical pantheons (Mars, Ishtar, The Morrigan, etc.) in some cases. The reliability of SCP-8027 as a source of cultural insight is uncertain, given the time between the fall of the Rus' and its authorship. European Valravns, with which the author is certainly more familiar, appear in SCP-8027's narrative, though it is unclear how much they have in common with the group that came to North America three hundred years previously.\n\n**Relevant Anomalies:**\n* **Runes** - though the Valravn magical tradition was a bastardized hodgepodge of many others, it remained mostly Norse in terms of appearance. As such, the primary form of thaumaturgy practiced by Valravns was the engraving of runes that enhanced weapons and armor or imbued them with additional properties. Berserkers (see below) are said to have borne runic tattoos that rendered them invulnerable in combat.\n* **Berserkers** - surviving records attest that Valravn war parties often included warriors styled after Norse berserkers, fighting clad only in animal hides and minimal armor with a fury that granted them supernatural strength and durability. As with historical Norse berserkers, the exact mechanism by which this was achieved (if indeed it was) is unknown. The modern Valravn Corporation is not known to employ such tactics, though it also has access to much more advanced technology and (presumably) thaumaturgy than its equivalent in Timeline DOTC-8000.\n* **The Black Lotus** - apparently an anomalous plant of Daevite origin, used and sold by Valravn merchants as a potent drug and thaumaturgical ingredient. Descriptions of the plant and its properties vary widely, indicating that \"Black Lotus\" may have been a blanket term applied to several different species. Interestingly, SCP-8027 seems to state that the Valravns were actively trading with a //contemporary// Daevite Empire, suggesting that an uncontrolled containment breach of [[[SCP-140]]] has occurred in Timeline DOTC-8000.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Chaos Insurrection]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** New England (formerly)\n\n**System of Government:** disorganized confederacy of multiple revolutionary groups\n\n**Summarized History:** In the late 600s AB, various grievances with the Holy Foundation sparked a widespread rebellion that eventually led to the secession of its northernmost territories. These provinces (save the city of Utgard, which instead joined the Free Cities League) were forcibly reassimilated after a grueling thirty-year civil war that left the region devastated. Anti-Foundation sympathies remain widespread in the Insurrection's former territory, especially among the enslaved D-caste, who were briefly emancipated during Insurrectionist rule.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** The Insurrection was of insufficient duration and homogeneity to develop a unified culture beyond mere opposition to the Holy Foundation. That said, the original group of revolutionaries was a cult that worshipped \"The Engine,\" an omniscient deity or force that supposedly spoke to them through an enigmatic Messiah figure known only as \"The Engineer\". This individual was not captured when Foundation forces retook the territory, and they or their successor are widely believed to still reside in Utgard, secretly directing ongoing Insurrection activities.\n\n**Relevant Anomalies:**\n* **Face-Flensers** - instances of [[[SCP-034]]], which Insurrection agents used for a variety of espionage missions. The presence of multiple instances in timeline DOTC-8000 may indicate that the Insurrection devised or discovered a means of replicating them, or that additional uncontained instances exist in the present.\n* **The Bell of Entropy** - a siege engine used by the Insurrection to demolish fortifications via sonically-induced structural collapse. Destroyed at the disastrous battle of Trollsford when it was struck by a Foundation-fired trebuchet stone, which shattered the Bell and caused it to release a destructive wave that slew the majority of both armies involved. Though a Pyrrhic victory for the Foundation, this battle is generally seen as the turning point of the civil war.\n* **The Staff of Hermes** - an artifact with transmutative properties, primarily used by the Insurrection to provide medical treatment to rebel armies and resupply besieged fortifications. Captured by the Foundation after the Siege of Idona (the final battle of the civil war) and placed in containment, to the outrage of the North's subsequently plagued and famine-stricken populace.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab The Kingdom of Romania Nova]]\n\n**Approximate Location:** Kentucky (formerly)\n\n**System of Government:** feudal monarchy\n\n**Summarized History:** Romania Nova (\"New Rome\") was apparently a civilization of sentient, Catholic animals, likely descended from [[[SCP-1845]]], and small groups of allied humans. Though their civilization had presumably existed since the Great Breach, it was not noticed by the Foundation until the early 500s AB, when human settlers in the Appalachian region unintentionally assassinated the animals' Pope while hunting. This incident sparked the first of many Crusades by the animals against the surrounding \"heathens,\" which occurred sporadically throughout the following two centuries. Though the animals' general lack of hands limited their technological advancement, their greater mobility, self-sufficiency, familiarity with the terrain, and ability to disguise themselves as non-anomalous fauna made them exceedingly difficult for the Foundation to combat. In 609 AB, the Foundation finally defeated the animals by deploying \"[[[deus vult |The Ancient Fire]]],\" a pre-Breach weapon of the Foundation that may have been a surviving nuclear warhead. Though most of the larger instances were subsequently killed or captured, many birds and small mammals are assumed to have escaped the slaughter. Such animals are consequently held in great suspicion in the former Kingdom and surrounding areas, though eradication campaigns have not been successful.\n\n**Culture & Religion:** The culture of SCP-1845 seems to have been preserved in Romania Nova. Though Christianity had apparently been forgotten by the majority of North America's human population (an intended consequence of Contingency 1981-Sebeok), the animals reintroduced the religion to humans that they subjugated or peacefully interacted with. The Foundation has done its best to once more eradicate the faith, but it is still practiced in secret by certain groups.\n\n**Relevant Anomalies:** \n* **The Metamorphic Venus** - After the destruction of its leadership by the Ancient Fire and the defeat of its army in Arnven, Romania Nova was conquered by the Foundation. Captured animals were given a choice between execution and \"conversion\" - forcible anthropomorphization by [[[SCP-1575]]]. The few survivors of this process were then pressed into D-caste slavery, though some have reportedly escaped to the Free Cities. Persistent rumors suggest that some untransformed animals also escaped the purge and are slowly rebuilding an army among their non-sentient kin.\n* **Therianthropy** - Foundation history reports that the animals used \"dark magic\" to forcibly transform human victims into animals; these stories match descriptions of [[[SCP-6090]]], though it is equally likely that they are historically inaccurate folklore or propaganda.\n* **The Tower of Mockeries** - [[[SCP-962]]], which the animals regard as a false prophet that intends to once again subjugate them to humanity. The object is also known to the Foundation, which classifies it as one of the Expunged and the valley in which it is located as a \"blighted\" region unfit for human habitation. Though the tower currently resides in the ██████ Mountains in baseline, its location in Timeline DOTC-8000 is less clear. A [[[though-i-walk-through-the-valley |journal fragment]]] included in SCP-8027's appendices seems to imply a location somewhere in the Rocky Mountains, but neither Romania Nova nor the Foundation is known to have any access to that region during the time period described, and the journal diplays clear signs of tampering by the Tower itself or someone under its control. It is possible that, without the Foundation shooting down its balloons, SCP-962 has spread dubious accounts of itself (such as the aforementioned journal) across much of the continent. It is also possible that the object has, over the eight centuries between now and DOTC-8000's present, become mobile.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Other Groups]]\n\nIn addition to the current and former states identified above, several other groups - many of them also successors to present-day GoIs - are depicted in SCP-8027 or described in its appendices. Examples include:\n* **The Serpent's Hand** - the Great Breach led to the detachment of the Wanderer's Library from this timeline, stranding many members of the Hand within it. Under the leadership of at least one Black Queen, the Hand reorganized as a secretive order of \"wizards\" that opposes the Foundation's efforts to suppress anomalous phenomena and seeks to recover and preserve the lost knowledge of the Ancients.\n* **Orcs** - described as large, hairy, nocturnal humanoids with an affinity for \"nature magic,\" these creatures have been tentatively identified as [[[SCP-1000]]]. Small tribes of such inhabit the sparsely-populated Appalachian region, where they frequently come into violent contact with human settlers. The Foundation has mounted several organized but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to eradicate them.\n* **Are We Cool Yet?** - [[[the-lord-judge |a dangerous cult]]], illegal in Foundation lands, who create works of anomalous art at the expense of human life and civilization. Despite this, many of the Foundation's wealthier citizens are suspected to consort with them for the purposes of commissioning or buying rare art.\n* **The Blood Fleet** - a fleet of undead pirates (whose ships, reportedly, are also undead), led by the cruel but beautiful Sea Bitch from her flagship, the Ship of Screams. When the two Expunged were liberated from a Foundation Abbey by the Insurrection, they began to prey on Foundation shipping, eventually creating a small fleet of undead pirates that continues to menace the southern coasts by night.\n* **\"Marscar the Dark, Lord of Terror and Destruction\"** - a clear bastardization of \"Marshall, Carter, and Dark, LTD\" and, allegedly, an immense three-headed dragon that dwells on the \"cursed island of Uk,\" which itself is clearly identifiable as Great Britain from the text. According to legend, this dragon was once the three wealthiest men (or sometimes two men and a woman) of the Ancient world, who hid themselves away from the Great Breach in an underground city (identifiable as [[[SCP-1678]]]) with all of their wealth to prevent anyone from taking it, rather than using their resources to help other survivors. It is said that, as punishment for such greed and selfishness, a deity cursed the three of them with a transformation into their current monstrous form. However, the obvious moralizing quality of this tale and the central role that Marscar the Dark plays in SCP-8027's story cast heavy doubt on its truthfulness.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]",
