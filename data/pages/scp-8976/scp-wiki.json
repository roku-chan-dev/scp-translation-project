Yes, while we were working on SUGARBIRD.\n\n**L PEARSON:** SUGARBIRD?\n\n**M JONES:** Mhm. That's right. Part of the larger umbrella of standardizing inter-department equipment codes. SUGARBIRD was an algorithm to do one of the most menial items of drudgework; take in equipment requests and convert them to one standardized system before feeding them back into the relevant databases. We weren't even a real department back then, just a tiny office of a few secretaries. Me, of course, but also... Williams, Hanna Tevoy. Sun-Hyung Barber, though we just called him Sonny. Oh, and Leslie.\n\n**L PEARSON:** I wasn't there.\n\n**M JONES:** Not you, honey. The other Leslie.\n\n**L PEARSON:** Right. So you were working on SUGARBIRD in 1982 with the earliest RAISA personnel. And when did you first see SCP-8976?\n\n**M JONES:** I didn't see it. I saw the absence of it. \n\n**L PEARSON:** What do you mean?\n\n**M JONES:** A chunk of equipment order records in the J-block from 1967 to 1969 by the Electrical Containment Division vanished. They were on my terminal, and I was watching when the information began to interweave, wrong equipment orders on the wrong records, impossible dates and times. And then, eventually, they blinked into nothing, a hole in the record. Like they'd never really existed at all.\n\n**L PEARSON:** There's a million reasons digital data can be lost. You know that.\n\n**M JONES:** Not on a secure Foundation terminal, not with the triple redundant backups we were using. Not the way I watched it happen. It was a few meager kilobytes of data, the kind of thing no one would have noticed missing. Except me, of course. It might have slipped under the radar, but it got too bold too fast.

The particular nature and design of SCP-8976 remain unclear pending further research. SCP-8976 is an infovorous entity that consumes information from within the SCIPNET network. At the moment, I have no reason to believe it is sentient.\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**DISCOVERY**\n[[/div]]\nSCP-8976 was first encountered by myself, Information Safety Administration (ISA) Head Secretary Maria Jones on July 2nd, 1979, in the course of the SUGARBIRD project.

Like an ant on a balloon, we cannot see the breadth of how our world is expanding. We can only feel the world shake beneath our feet and crawl for the bleeding edges. A farmer in Sumer learns to till seeds of grain; James Watts exhibits his revolutionary steam engine. The balloon is breathed into.\n\nNow, we teeter on the edge of a knowledge society. The theory of information is being drawn up in front of our very eyes, how languages form and the rules and limits of what we can make these thinking engines do. Our ability to store vast libraries of information into rooms and warehouses, these little Alexandrias, offers us the same promise grain once did. I am not the only one to have this prediction, which makes me all the more confident in it.\n\nBut new landscapes invite predation. Darwin’s theory of evolution speaks to survival. When a niche opens in an environment, something will evolve to fill it. We live in a lush of information. The machine I write this on contains records that predate me and that will outlast me. Were something to evolve or be designed to take advantage of that, it would never go hungry. I ponder the existence of an entity — a being, a program, or an algorithm — that exists off the consumption of new information, a manner of infovore.\n[[/div]]\n\n[!-- SET_2 --]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-red border-white\"]]\n= **[PREVIOUS FOOTAGE CORRUPTED]**\n\n**L PEARSON:** I'm sorry, I'm looking at this file -- I thought you said you encountered it in 1982?\n\n**M JONES:** I did.

There are no limits placed on it, because why would it limit itself? It consumes information, eating knowledge and noticed only by its absence, a trail of not-breadcrumbs it leaves behind after gorging itself. In this way, it is not so different from a human, as we too seek to learn.\n\nBut unlike us, it does not leave the information behind for future generations to learn from, because it cannot ‘remember’. It must be simple to be an efficient consumer, and this precludes complex memory structures. Were it to have a complex memory, it would scale linearly in size and complexity with what it ate, meaning it would grow slower and slower as it worked to determine if it has tasted this particular information before or not. It can simply destroy the information after tasting it, thus guaranteeing it will never return to it again. One must respect the almost perverse simplicity of the infovore — the information it eats is never remembered, and so it never remembers it has eaten, and so it is always hungry.\n\nThe applications of an infovore are numerous. Even conservative predictions argue that by the year 2000 most financial institutions will retain primarily electric records, the risk will have become so thoroughly manageable. States and society at large soon follows. Were one to engineer an infovore to devour only portions of such data, it could rampage through a memory set for quite some time before its worm-holes were noticed. \n[[/div]]\n\n[!-- SET_3 --]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-red border-white\"]]\n\n**L PEARSON:** You went through two iterations of nothing happening and didn't conclude you just misremembered what happened?\n\n**M JONES:** I don't make mistakes.\n\n**L PEARSON:** Fair enough. Tell me about incident four.\n\n**M JONES:** The two variables I had were the content of the data and the placement in memory. Content was easier to manipulate, so first I tried nonsense. Just garbled 0s and 1s with no meaning. Nothing. Then I copied the data that had been erased and replaced it. Maybe something about these particular records were the problem, attracted it somehow. \n\n**L PEARSON:** Copied from where? It was erased.\n\n**M JONES:** Not from my head. Steel trap. That didn't work either, so I tried something new. And then it was gone. Okay, then. Now we know it wants //new// data, new information. I repeated it two more times with more new data.\n\n[[div class=\"blot\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**L PEARSON:** Did you show it to the rest of the ISA personnel?\n\n**M JONES:** I certainly tried.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-cyan border-white text-white\" data-title=\"SCP-8976 ADDENDA\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**INCIDENT NUMBER**\n[[/div]]\n8976.7\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**WITNESSES**\n[[/div]]\nMaria Wesley Jones, Sun-Hyung Barber, Leslie Meyer\n\n[[div class=\"heading\"]]\n**SUMMARY**\n[[/div]]\n38.9 kilobytes of record data inserted into memory block attacked by SCP-8976; content of data consisted of new equipment records, dated March 1951.

It is engineered — whether by designer or by nature — to seek out significant and unfamiliar information. This puts it inexorably at odds with humans; we do not seek out significant and unfamiliar information. All information is unfamiliar to us until we have consumed it, and only then do we determine if it is significant or not. In essence, we build a model in our memory arranged by what is significant (our employee code) and what is familiar (the location of our housekeys) and what is both (our memories of our wedding night).\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-black border-white text-white offset-right right-1\" data-title=\"ATTACHED\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n| name=3.png\n| caption=//Elise Smiling//\n]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIn summary, the human mind presents an ideal model of the kind of memory set an infovore would find easiest to predate on. Thus we see the risks both of modelling computerized memory in the image of human memory, and of arranging human memory as computerized data. The infovore seeks significant and familiar information because this allows it to destroy all recurrences of that information and make its future searches more efficient. If it were to prey on a mind, the mind would not realize it was being preyed on, as human memory is prone to fault and self-doubt in a way electronic memory is not. The relationship becomes closer to that of a parasite, insect with a proboscis burrowed into the medulla as it sucks away.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[!-- SET_4 --]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-red border-white\"]]\n\n**M JONES:** The thing was taunting me.

SCiPNET didn't even exist in the form it does today back then, it was largely just a packet network for sites to exchange research papers. I had more pressing work to do for ISA. \n\n**L PEARSON:** So it got left by the wayside.\n\n[[div class=\"blot\" style=\"height: 300px; width: 300px; margin-bottom: -300px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**M JONES:** I suppose you could say that.

It was... a pet project, of sorts. \n\n**L PEARSON:** Okay, sure. But clearly you kept coming back to it.\n\n**M JONES:** It was nagging at me. If it was eating data wholesale...

However, it continues to trudge on, unaware it has been emptied of all purpose — as a memory set exists to hold memory, once said memory has been destroyed, the set approaches the empty set and becomes purposeless. Always found computers to be superior to humans in this regard, as once an electronic memory set has been emptied, it can be refilled with new data. When a biological memory set has been emptied, there is no refilling it with new data. A human can only live one life.

I am at the patch of dry, untillable, dead and sun-scorched land outside Sacramento that my father bled on until orange trees sprouted. I remember stealing one away with Elsie and going barefoot to the creek when we knew the white boys would be at church. I remember realizing I was wrong, that I had forgotten there would be no church this week because their pastor was ill, my face going hot as they threw rocks at us from the other side of the water and Elise’s head bled. I remember sobbing into my mother’s dress. I remember my mother. I am my mother, watching a little Black girl cry. I remember my father falling asleep in his rocking chair by the door with a shotgun. I remember being utterly alone in my classes, what few white girls were in the sciences refusing to share any notes with me. I remember seeing Rufus Pearson at the dance and asking him whether he smoked. I remember our wedding. I remember Elise’s head bleeding. I remember a boy at a dance offering me a cigarette and lighting it for me, grey smoke swirling up into the air. I remember a girl’s head on the bank of a creek, red dissolving into cool blue. I don’t know their names. I love them. I remember everything. I remember nothing at all.\n\nLet it eat me alive.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-cyan border-white text-white\" data-title=\"SCP-8976 ADDENDA\"]]\n\nFollowing careful analysis by RAISA officers, the Council has voted to archive the SCP-8976 file for the following reasons:\n* **Anomalous nature unsubstantiated and/or inadequately confirmed anomaly:** SCP-8976 was never witnessed by any member of Foundation personnel other than former RAISA Director Maria Jones, and Director Jones repeatedly protected the file from standard archival votes.\n* **Primary researcher no longer available to the Foundation:** Former RAISA Director Maria Jones has taken a medical retirement, and is unavailable for further contact or research on the anomaly\n\n[[/DIV]]\n\n\n[!-- LOG --]\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-black border-white\" style=\"box-shadow: none;\"]]\n//[Pearson climbs the porch steps of the lake house. It is twilight, and the sun is setting. Her black pickup truck is parked on the gravel driveway. She rings the doorbell. Nothing happens.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Hello?\n\n//[She raps his knuckles against the door. It swings open freely on squeaky hinges. Somewhere, a bird is startled by the noise.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Mom?\n\n//[There is no response. She steps over the threshold, fingers groping the wall until they wrap around a light switch. She flicks it. Nothing happens.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Shit. Mom? Are you here?\n\n//[She slips his phone out and turns on the flashlight. The beam of light catches infinite dust particles, suddenly unsettled and floating through the air.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Oh. Man.\n\n//[Almost every visible surface is papered over with yellow Post-Its, colorful sticky notes, white notebook paper scotch-taped to the wall. They cover the walls of the foyer entirely. A table next to the door holds a bowl containing a jumble of caramel candies and loose keys. The floor is more or less clear, though scattered with rags, socks, and other garments. Pearson progresses through the foyer.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Mom? It’s me. Are you okay? \n\n//[No response. She proceeds out of the foyer, into what might have been the kitchen. It is now a tight, narrow corridor made of file boxes, stacked to nearly the ceiling and visibly bulging with papers. She has to turn to the size to squeeze through. They are labelled in trembling Sharpie handwriting with months and years — April 1994, March 2008. They do not appear to be in any particular order.]//\n\n**Pearson:** I don’t wanna scare you, Dr. Jones. It’s me. It’s Leslie.

There is a sofa and a coffee table in front of the TV, but only the tops of either are visible over the sea of media that rises mid-calf. The walls are packed with teetering stacks of VHS tapes and cassettes,  crammed together in obsessively labeled stacks. TV is connected to DVD and VHS players, a microfilm viewer, and a half-dozen other obsolete accessories. The cassette player is ticking, a tape not-quite inserted into it.

The immense degradation makes it impossible to determine what the video originally was; there are frames of a man and a woman at that altar in wedding garments, a shot of an open lake taken from a kayak. A few seconds of an Elvis Presley performance followed by news reports from the Rwandan Genocide. Two young black girls in matching dresses waving at the camera. United Airlines Flight 175 crashing into the South Tower. The Soviet Red Army liberating Auschwitz. A man in a sterile hospital gown holding a baby. The fall of the Berlin Wall. A woman standing in front of a building, beaming and holding a briefcase. An older couple wearing N95 masks waving at the camera. Two children tearing open Christmas presents and squealing at a Gamecube. Israeli soldiers firing into a crowd of protesters. A car driving away, rattling cans tied to the bumper. A woman crying at a funeral. A burning cross staked into a lawn, surrounded by men in white hoods. A couple kissing in front of the lake house. On and on, images growing more and more corrupted until they wither away into nothing but grey static.

Dr. Jones!?\n\n//[She turns on her heel, before seeing a flickering, faint light coming from the far hall. She wades through the sea of media on the floor towards it. The scratching grows louder.]//\n\n**Pearson:** Mom? Mom?!\n\n//[She rounds the corner, facing into a bedroom. The jumble of media on the floor continues into the room. An elderly Maria Jones is lying on an armchair, her head leaned back. A phonograph in the corner of the room spins away at an old record that has long since been worn smooth. There is no music anymore, just a dull scratching.]//\n\n[[div class=\"turbo-block bg-black border-white text-white offset-right right-1\" style=\"box-shadow: none;\" data-title=\"ATTACHED\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n| name=9.png\n| caption=Elsie\n]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Pearson:** //(Softly)// Oh god, Mom.

Jones leans forward, into the light. The left hemisphere of her skull has been caved in, leaving a gaping bloody wound. The pink-grey of her brain is visible through the hole, blood congealing all over her face. She squints into the light.]//\n\n**Jones:** Elise?\n\n//[A figure shifts in the darkness behind Jones.
