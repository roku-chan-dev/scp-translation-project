Websites containing SCP-6909 should be taken down, and physical manifestations that are not in Foundation containment should be destroyed. Civilian subjects aware of SCP-6909 should be amnestisized.\n\nCurrent confirmed iterations of SCP-6909 include:\n\n* Ni-Pur and Snefru\n* Vernon and Alexandre (see Addendum 02)\n* Takeru and Jinaya\n* Vagesh and Nirjar (see Addendum 01)\n* Shushen and Weiwu\n* Abayomi and Fawaz\n* Askuwheteau and Mingan\n\nCopies of literature and art depicting SCP-6909 is stored in a locker in Site-168. Digital archives are available for testing for personnel above Level 2 clearance. All personnel involved with SCP-6909 should have undergone training to have Cognitive Resistance Value (CRV) of at least 5.\n\n[[span class=\"bigtext\"]]DESCRIPTION:[[/span]] SCP-6909 is a self-propagating memetic narrative structure, which typically takes the form of a story or fable. SCP-6909 is a textual anomaly, which alters printed material and digital files by inserting itself into the medium by replacing a portion of the affected works. SCP-6909 typically affects mythological anthologies or translations of folklore, and have been observed in many languages.\n\nThe narrative of SCP-6909 takes the form of a fable with a moral lesson for the reader. While iterations of SCP-6909 vary across cultural spheres, consistent elements of the story include the physical description of the two central figures, the description of the vanquished beasts, and the subsequent disappearance of one figure, and cyclical nature.\n\nSubjects without proper memetic inoculation that come across SCP-6909 typically believe that SCP-6909 is an ancient myth that they have previously heard before, typically from parents or grandparents. The memetic effect is retained through various ways of reproduction, if key elements of the narrative is intact; this includes further oral or textual retellings, or visual depictions in art.\n\nIt is believed that SCP-6909 typically spread through textual reproduction. While visual reproductions of SCP-6909 have been found, this has found not to be a result of memetic compulsion, but merely a side effect.\n\nWhile the origin of SCP-6909 is unknown, earliest record of SCP-6909 originated from the comparative literature departments of several universities, starting in the 1980s. The Foundation noticed this discrepancy when a number of comparative literature studies independently \"discovered\" a previously unknown story within several cultural spheres. As there were no historical text or art depicting the stories, and the highly similar narrative structure between different iterations, the Foundation realized a possible narrative hazard and discovered the memetic effect afterwards.\n\nBecause the memetic effect of SCP-6909 is non-hazardous, it has made it difficult to determine the spread of SCP-6909. Oral tradition has become the most common form of spread for SCP-6909 after the Foundation began its containment efforts.\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ WARNING FROM THE MEMETICS DEPARTMENT\n----\n+++ Please do not read the following addenda without proper memetic inoculation and understanding of SCP-6909.
