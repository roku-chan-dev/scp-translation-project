Additionally, SCP-6317 is to meet weekly with site psychologists to screen for long term exposure to cognitohazardous materials. \n\nSCP-6317-1 is to be contained within a standard anomalous item containment locker. At the request of SCP-6317, testing with SCP-6317-1 is currently prohibited. Instead, SCP-6317 has provided Foundation staff with a collection of materials for review. Foundation staff are to observe caution while reviewing materials, and are to affirm that they are currently living their best life.\n\n**Description:**\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=\nhttp://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6317/Polaroid_OneStep.jpg\n| caption=SCP-6317-1\n]]\n\nSCP-6317 is the designation given to Hana “Iris” Thompson, an Asian-American female of average build and height. Prior to containment, SCP-6317 was a member of the senior class of Bear Ridge High School and President of the Newspaper club. This is where she is believed to have first encountered SCP-6317-1.\n\nSCP-6317-1 is a Polaroid 1000 Land Camera with “Property of KLHS” carved into its side. The school acquired SCP-6317-1 for the club from an alumnus, with the hopes of providing a more authentic feel to the school paper. SCP-6317-1 has no innate anomalous properties aside from a seemingly infinite amount of film and battery life.\n\nSCP-6317's anomalous properties manifest when interacting with the photos produced by SCP-6317-1. By physically manipulating the photos (cutting, scratching, pasting, etc.), SCP-6317 can alter the memories of the events taking place in the photo. Through addition or removals of certain aspects of the photo, subjects receive conflicting memories, causing them to be unable to recall events captured in the photo. SCP-6317 herself is not immune to this affect, and efforts to remediate her gaps in memory are currently ongoing.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Addendum - 01**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//Discovery//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\nSCP-6317’s anomalous properties were discovered following a tip from Researcher Blaire’s son, Anthony; a senior at Bear Ridge and someone SCP-6317 was noted to be romantically pursuing. After reading the Homecoming edition of the school paper, Researcher Blaire noted that his son was having difficulty recalling the events and aftermath of the game. Anthony showed Blaire a photo in the newspaper he was in with his friends. Upon seeing the paper, Researcher Blaire found that one of the kid’s faces was scratched out, with SCP-6317 awkwardly edited into the photo.\n\nFurthermore, Anthony insisted that both SCP-6317 and his friend were present.[[footnote]]Text messages reviewed by Researcher Blaire following this event revealed that SCP-6317 was unable to attend due to a conflict with the school’s cross country team.[[/footnote]] Researcher Blaire instructed his son to get some rest and began a formal examination of the newspaper. Through inspection, the newspaper was noted to have slightly elevated cognitohazard levels consistent with anomalous interference. Researcher Blaire sent the paper to Site-19, and was tasked to passively monitor the situation for continued anomalous effects.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size x-large]]**Addendum - 02**[[/size]]\n[[size large]]//Recovered Documentation//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\nThe following interview was conducted by SCP-6317 prior to the publication of the Homecoming edition of the school newspaper.

Life only gets better after you graduate. When I was in your shoes, I felt the same way. All the Homecoming games and marching band tunes fade away after a while. Eventually you just have to face the music.\n\n**Hana:** I’m not sure I’m ready to leave yet. There’s still so much I need to do before June.\n\n**Kruek:** Well, you better step to it, kid. This is the last chance you’ll have to see all of your friends before they move on and you become a memory.\n\n**Hana:** Huh?\n\n**Kruek:** You remember all those nights you spent awake staring at your ceiling wondering if you were doing enough? It’ll never be enough. No matter if you had a year or the rest of your life. Your regrets will only come to you in once fond memories of faces you barely remember.\n\n//<Hana holds her hands to the side of her head.

I mean, we would be fools to not vote for such a wonderful person as queen. It's not like she spent the entire year running a fraud. No no no. This was her year after all, a chance for her to shine and sparkle; to make memories at the expense of everyone else.\n\nSure, she may have taken our memories, identities, and senior year from us, but can you really blame her? She deserved to be at those football games and charity events while we got the enriching experience of sitting as neat paper cut outs on the darkroom floor.\n\nOh, but let's not forget those superlatives.

She's been in this position before, she thinks; looking down from the high-dive, ready to deliver victory to the school she so dearly loved. Her shoulders feel like heavy anchors, and as she blinks away her blurry vision, she can almost see people waiting for her in the water.
