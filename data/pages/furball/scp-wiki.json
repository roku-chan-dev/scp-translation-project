Don’t look. If you look, you acknowledge it exists. Don't even think of it. Look away, don't let it get you.\n\n**Description:** There is a being. No, not a being. A lack of being. Inhuman, unhuman. It’s hiding in the corners, on the fringes, on the edges of what is. A shambling mass of rot and mucus and hair and slime and dread, so much dread. It crawls in the corners, slips in the shadows, hides in the empty halls and deserted conference rooms. But you can’t disguise a smell. A sweet, flowery smell of decay and the inevitable.\n\nYou know why it’s there, don’t you? You’ve always known.\n\nWe've always known.\n\n**Discovery:** When you were eight, you found Furball hiding in the bushes next to your driveway. Dark, sleek fur covered in dried-up grime and dirt, whiskers buried in the mud. For a moment he was asleep -- what dreams may come? -- asleep and at peace. You leaned in, and there it was. That smell.\n\nThe smell of what you bring into this world. The smell you can’t take out of it.\n\nFurball wiggled and twitched and for a moment you believed in miracles. You believed in miracles and wonders and a little bit of luck. You leaned in. You leaned in and scratched behind his ear, where he always begged to be scratched. But you didn’t find a warm, soft body. You didn't find a pleasant purr. You find the ##bccd9a|rot##. Cold, slimy creatures, little cleaners of waste, of all that isn’t anymore, eating at the insides, the soft and warm and wet. A wiggling mass.\n\nYou scream.
