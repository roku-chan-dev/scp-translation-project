Psychological horror is what drew me to SCP, and I am inspired by it, and want to emulate some of that.\n\nMy writing focuses on abuse and trauma, but I also like themes of healing, redemption, and forgiveness. You might see the progression of one to another as I post more of my rewrite.\n\nDo be warned, if you're somehow encountering this page before its writing, that I seriously mean my content warnings. If it's enough for the Adult splash page, it's enough that it must be really graphic, not just a little mention or vague depiction. \n\nOther informations about me: I'm Catholic, speak french and japanese and mainly learned english from looking at my SpInts on the internet, listen to a semi-pathological amount of music, after I hug God and Mama Mary in Heaven (Lord willing) I'll immediately glomp St. Francis, and am paraplegic with a smattering of other illnesses plus mental disabilities which make writing extremely difficult but I do it anyways.\n\n**Topics I specialise in critting:** schizophrenia, schizoid personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, self-harm, suicide/suicide attempts, psychiatry/psych wards/antipsychotics, ASD at higher support levels, physical disabilities, mobility aids (especially wheelchairs), medical accuracy for all kinds of things/procedures, theological accuracy for Catholicism in particular. \n\nIf you need help writing any of the above, from idea feedback to draft feedback to sensitivity reading, I can do that. PM me here, ping me in your thread in the SCPF server, or DM me on Discord (@tiredsn0w), whatever works for you. If I don't respond for a while it's because of health issues, though if I seem to have accidentally ghosted you feel free to send another message.\n\nP.S. I am a rambler/waffler and can have stilted speech at times. Sorry for any communication inconvenience.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n++ Acknowledgements\n[[/=]]\n[[*user Fierce fauna]] - For being the first returning reader who interacted with my stuff on Wikidot-- I greatly enjoy talking to you about our different ideas.\n[[*user SilverScribbles]] - For getting all invested in my stories and being there for all the things I make! Your interest means the world.\n[[*user Alzin Cdag]] - For being so thoughtful about my silly little characters, and giving me feedback on my writing, as well as writing your own amazing stuff with them!\n[[*user Charlie80827]] - For reading my drafts at lunch, and always being a jokester. Bong mask 2k21.\n[[*user mrmph]] - For being along for so much of the ride and nurturing my concepts for 6118.\n[[*user allyzero]] - For being an awesome beta reader and giving me great feedback on my Tales, as well as enthusiasm about my story, and encouraging me to keep writing.\n**Mark Green** - For answering my random medical questions, as well as providing me with the PCRs.\n**Yesenia** - For keeping helping me unjumble the big ugly knot of thoughts in my head. Turns out, writing and re-writing bad endings is rather cathartic.\n[[*user caspian2]] - For giving me the crit that shaped everything. The entire reason that it even survived. Also, featuring me in the reviewer's spotlight? That blew my mind.\n[[*user Nils Severin]] - For making 6118 ready to be shown to the world.\n\n**And, obviously, to everyone who votes and gives me comments!**\nYour support and feedback literally mean the world to me. I cannot express the gratitude I have for every single person that has made me want to keep writing.\n[[/div]]",
