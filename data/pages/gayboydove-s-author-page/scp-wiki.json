I was so enamoured with the concept of a secret anomalous organization that I had to check it out. My first few SCPs were bad, and as such they flopped. But I eventually found my footing, releasing two SCPs in early 2021 which are both still up today! After a 3 year hiatus for mental health, I am finally back and plan on writing as much as I can!
