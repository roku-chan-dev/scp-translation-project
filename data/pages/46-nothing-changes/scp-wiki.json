But the frame was the same; he was tall enough for her tastes, his figure hadn't completely gone to seed, he had the straw-brown hair (even if it was thinner, whether on his scalp or his jaw or his chest or even lower) and the soulful brown eyes (even if the look of fiery intellect had been replaced by one of sorrowful apology) and the wide shoulders (it was certainly her imagination that Phil's seemed almost rounded). They were practically identical where it counted, however. She had no intention of putting it to him this way, but her new boyfriend had precisely his late, unlamented brother's cute butt.\n\nIt was presently out of sight. Phil was slumped over the edge of the mattress, inverted, watching her dress. He seemed to have a thing for that. She didn't mind; after eight years, she and Harry had long since ceased to ogle each other after bed. He'd taken longer than she had, but then, she knew he had more to look at than she did. \n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/46-nothing-changes/DL_46_01_Phudo.jpg]]\n\nTruth be told, he'd never taken very good care of himself. Sometimes she thought that was her fault, playing so easy to get. If she'd given him an uphill battle, he might at least have gotten in the habit of exercising. \n\nPhil, at least, spent a lot of his time walking from station to broken station. He was not wholly without muscle mass, and she'd felt quite safe in his arms after their awkward mutual struggling beneath the sheets. Of course, there was probably no threat in the world he could neutralize half as effectively as she could, but the checklist of attraction hadn't been substantively updated in centuries. A solid arm lock went a long way.\n\n\"What's on for today?\" she asked, as she turned away and wriggled into her underpants.\n\nHe didn't answer. She had a sudden image of Phil making cartoon awooga eyes at her backside, and sighed.\n\nHe reached out and poked her in the buttock.\n\nShe sighed again, and turned around. \"Philip Deering. What is your schedule for today?\"\n\nHe looked up at her, though not quite making it all the way to her eyes. She refused to sigh for a third time, so instead she bent down and kissed him on the lips, upside-down, as a sort of very, very soft reset.\n\nWhen she withdrew, his eyes were closed. That was almost as cute as his butt, but it wasn't getting her any closer to a response, so she lightly slapped him on the cheek. \"Speak.\"\n\n\"I dunno.\" He rolled over, planted his face into the mattress, and spoke into it. \"What day is it?\"\n\n\"Tuesday.\"\n\n\"Oh, Tuesday.\" He nodded, still into the mattress. \"That would be the same as Monday. And Wednesday, for that matter. Shift starts in... what time is it?\"\n\nShe picked the digital alarm clock off the bedstand and tossed it onto the bed. The cord reached, so the plastic thudded into his scalp. He looked up, grunting, and stared blearily into the red glow. \"Two hours? Wow. Don't normally get up this early. Guess I have time for a shower?\"\n\nHe looked up again, and waggled his brows.\n\nShe snorted. \"Yes, you have time for a shower. But //only// a shower. I don't rush for anybody.\"\n\n\"Me either.\" He yawned, rolled onto his back again, and closed his eyes. \"Shit happens whether I'm running around or not. If I'm standing still, at least I've got perspective.\"\n\nShe suddenly felt she very much wanted to reach down and haul him back up. She continued reassembling her wardrobe instead. \"Except you're not standing. You're lying on the bed.\"\n\nShe almost didn't believe it when the only response she got was a light, snuffled snore.\n\n[!-- [[=image Phudo_Bed.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nShe had always had a way of folding herself into a scene, finding a pose-shaped hole into which she could contort herself and pull focus, as though there might be a photographer waiting in the wings at all hours to document perfect poise in still life. \n\nShe lay on the bed, stomach to mattress, legs kicked up in carefully carefree form, hands splayed regally over the pillow which preserved just enough of her modesty to enhance the allure. It was by no means unpleasant, but it did leave him wondering how long it would take her to stop putting on a show and allow a little unaffected spontaneity... if her years of emotional self-sequestration hadn't already made that impossible.\n\n//It's not like we have all the time in the world.//\n\nWell. They had all the everything in the world, actually, and would until next September. It was still a sobering thought, though not enough so that her intoxicating pinup pose did nothing for him. Chin down, irises barely visible as curved slits beneath her pointed brows; yes, she was pulling out all the stops this morning. As if to beg the question: if this was all there was, was this enough?\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/46-nothing-changes/DL_46_02_Elstrom_Bed.jpg]]\n\nAs his senses came back to him with a yawn and a stretch that took him to the tips of his toes, oxygen flooding his brain, he suddenly remembered that by contrast with this private spectacle he was doughy, unkempt and wholly devoid of grace. He went searching for a shirt, and pants. She adjusted the tilt of her head to keep the provocative angle intact; whether the product of instinct or mindfulness, he couldn't say. \n\n\"Rushing out?\" she teased. There was a hint, just the faintest trace of anxiety preparing to blossom into insult in her husky morning tone. \n\n\"Hiding my paunch.\" His jeans were on the floor. They were freezing, and he squirmed a little extra as he squirmed into them. He'd never understood how denim caught on in coldest Canada. \n\nShe waved one hand as though dismissing a fly, the other remaining fixed to catch it when it fell back into place. \"I didn't come for your physique, just like you didn't come for mine.\"\n\nHe cocked a brow as he found his socks beneath the bed, conscious as he did so that no brow cocked half as handily as hers. \"What's wrong with your physique?\"\n\n\"Nothing, I guess.\" She was still looking up the curve of her long lashes at him, and as he pulled on his pants, he found himself unable to stop looking back. That she could do something with her eyes to distract from what was going on astern was a testament to long years' practice managing appearances. \"Any plans for tonight?\"\n\nAnd there it was, nakedly, which of course was half-appropriate to the situation. She was wondering if this had been a one night thing. She was hoping it wouldn't be. He felt a complex wash of empathy, sadness, and... well, pride. On a great many metrics, Karen Elstrom would be considered a serious catch. She was certainly out of his league, and always had been. \n\n//So what changed?//\n\n\"Meet up again?\" he suggested, tone wavering across the line between encouraging and anxious.\n\nHer blue eyes lit up, though the smile became no less salacious. \"Bring me a present, and I'll think about it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" he agreed without thinking -- he was reorienting his hoodie to put it on -- \"I'll pop up to the grocery store to grab some flowers.\"\n\nHe spent a second longer than he needed to in the bowels of the sweater, mouthing curses, before emerging. If she'd reacted to his doom and gloom, the mask was already back in place. \n\n\"You'll just have to get creative,\" she smirked. \"I'm sure you'll think of something.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image Elstrom_Bed.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThe Inter-Sectional Subway ran on a wholly unreasonable schedule.\n\nThere was no good reason for it to cycle continuously in the middle of a shift. The entire system rarely had more than a handful of riders during these off-hours, and yet it had long been mandated that the timetable must be kept to regardless. Every few minutes, every stop saw the modified Red Rockets roaring into view. They stopped. Perhaps one person would get off. Perhaps another would get on. Then off again they went, gradually wearing down their bearings and other moving parts, demanding constant upkeep. The only way Nascimbeni could justify it was the fact that his technicians very quickly learned the skills they needed to repair the trains, and were never afforded the opportunity to forget them. If it hadn't been for that, he would have put his foot down ages ago. If folks didn't want to walk, there ought to be some sort of tradeoff. It wasn't like anyone ever had to stop and //wait// for a train at Site-43, and he rather felt that sometimes they should be made to.\n\nNascimbeni did not, as a rule, have a very open mind in his early middle age, but he was right now having cause to reconsider this position.\n\nHe'd arrived at precisely the moment that the train shot off to its next destination, and so he would need to wait the full ten minutes it took for the Green Line to cycle back 'round again. His back ached, and he wasn't about to push this heavy cart all the way to R&E on Trevor Bremmel's say-so, and so he would need to do precisely the thing he thought nobody ever did. He sat down on one of the pristine benches, which few butts had ever touched, crossed his legs and arms, and pulled the brim of his cap down over his eyes.\n\n\"Guess we just missed it.\"\n\nNascimbeni didn't shift out of his snoozing pose. It was never good to offer yourself up for conversation before you knew who the potential partners were, and the new arrival wasn't talking to himself. The voice was familiar; it was either Mataxas or the junior doctor on Forsythe's totem pole, that hotshot from Athens. What was his name?\n\n//It's LeClair's totem pole now.//\n\n\"Excellent.\" //That// was Mataxas, Nascimbeni realized. The coarser tones of age. \n\n\"What's excellent about it?\" The second speaker's voice was strikingly similar, hence Nascimbeni's confusion with the young physician he couldn't quite put a name to. Mataxas junior, then, the fresh MTF recruit. Rasmus.\n\n\"Come on, Ras,\" a woman's voice sighed. \"You should know better than to invite a lecture. He does them often enough of his own volition.\" This would be Polyxeni, Rasmus' sister, junior researcher in nothing much. She wanted, like her father, to be a ghost hunter. Like her father, she found no position to fill at Site-43 which would satisfy her criteria.\n\nAs though he hadn't heard his daughter, Anastasios Mataxas adopted a sort of sing-song tone as he responded to his son. \"It tells us that time keeps on ticking, even down here, even when 'down here' has no meaning, even when 'up there', where the sun once was, is gone. Without the sun, without the moon, without time zones, Greenwich Mean Time, without even //Greenwich,// we could be forgiven for forgetting that there's still continuity from moment to moment. That time even exists. But it does, for behold! We have missed our train.\"\n\nUnder his heavy lids, Nascimbeni rolled his eyes.\n\nThe younger man wasn't having it. \"Not everything is a teachable moment, dad.\"\n\n\"But of course it is. Any moment that isn't teachable is empty, and no moment is empty. Even with our horizons cinched around us like a belt, there are things to learn from every instant we're awake. That is why we're here. To learn, so we might know. To know, so we might teach. I give you my knowledge, and you build upon it. So that when the world returns, the three of us will return to it better than we were before.\"\n\n\"Assuming it returns,\" Polly muttered.\n\n\"Which of course it will,\" her father chastisted her.\n\n\"Why?\" Rasmus asked.\n\n\"Because if it didn't, then this would be a prelude to nothing. And I refuse to admit that I might have stood around hectoring you ungrateful little shits for no reason at all.\"\n\nNot able to see their faces, Nascimbeni was caught off-guard when this provoked not a sullen silence or recipricol recriminations, but a round of hearty laughter from both children. Their father joined in soon after, and they were still playfully bantering when the train finally arrived.\n\nNascimbeni pretended to be asleep. He could catch the next one.\n\nHe had time.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nBremmel couldn't whistle, but he was blowing a lot of air out of his mouth anyway. \"Would you look at //that.//\"\n\n\"Yes, sir,\" his assistant agreed.\n\n\"And none of it the slightest bit otherworldly.\" The old engineer paced back and forth, admiring the tangle of cables and the embarassment of panels with more blinking lights and unlabelled switches than the bridge of the original //Enterprise.// He ran his fingers along each one, not to press, merely to caress.

The water in Lake Huron is more pure than anywhere else on the continent, owing to the efforts of the army of mystic cats and the presence of the vast veins of anomalous copper they protect, so pure that the Foundation has been tampering with civilian tests since the Second World War to hide that fact. It is therefore ideal for our purposes, and we pump it in and out in vast quantities via vast pipelines, some leading merely to the water's edge, some stretching far into the heart of the lake's basin.\n\nIntake Point-94 represents our farthest point of incursion into the wetter side of the beneath-world, a glassed enclosure five kilometres from the shore and two hundred metres from the sunlight, accessed via a dedicated open-air tram line that glides overtop of a cluster of 32-inch water mains. It wasn't pure practicality that dictated construction of a glass observation dome at this juncture of the Site's distribution system; though it's too far from the main facility to see much recreational use, the aesthetic value of this expensive aquarium is dramatic. There is something soothing about looking out into the rippling blue... except, of course, on the not infrequent occasions when something looks back in at you.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nLike the Inter-Sectional Subway System, Intake Point-94 had been spared by Wirth's comprehensive conceptualization of the Site's interior footprint. The long glass tunnel and broad glass dome now looked out on nothing at all; there had been some concern that the pressure change from the lake's disappearance might cause structural difficulties, but these had so far not come to pass. Unlike the subway tunnel, which was already becoming enough of a thrilling footpath that Security and Containment were having to restrict access, nobody was trying to walk the glass road to the middle of nowhere. Few, fewer than even before, were bothering to take the little tram. It was a long way to go just to look at nothing.\n\nStill, Harry had thought it might be a nice change from their perch beyond the elevator. There were already enough experiments being run from the platform that it lacked much in the way of privacy, and the increasing intimacy of their arrangement was easier to manage beyond the reach of prying eyes. \n\nHe shouldn't have been surprised to find that someone else had had the same idea, for different reasons.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/46-nothing-changes/DL_46_03_Billie.jpg]]\n\n\"Your mom know you're out here?\" Harry asked, and instantly knew it was the wrong thing to say, even before the girl's pug nose twisted itself into a knot.\n\n\"No,\" Billie Forsythe snapped. \"So don't narc.\"\n\nHe put both hands up in a gesture of surrender. \"Who, me?\" He was feeling older by the second, between having actually asked someone if their //mom knew they were out here// and being accused of being a cop.\n\nBillie was standing at the glass, looking out. Harry took up station beside her, at a distance equal parts respectful and practical. In his experience, young adults tended to smell. \"Taking in the sights?\"\n\nShe snorted. \"Yeah.\"\n\n\"You find you want to keep looking at it, even though there's nothing to look at?\"\n\nShe glanced at him, just for a moment. \"Yeah. Doesn't make any fucking sense, does it.\"\n\n\"Not really, no. Must be something philosophical.\"\n\nShe snorted again. \"Everything stupid people do isn't philosophical. Sometimes it's just stupid.\"\n\n\"What makes you think there's a distinction?\"\n\nShe turned to look at him, and he returned the gesture. The exposed skin around her raccoon makeup looked red and raw. \"Between what? Philosophy and stupidity?\"\n\nHe nodded. \"Yeah. Philosophy is about knowing ourselves, and the universe. The search for meaning. Stupidity is one of the most meaningful things there is. One of our purest ways of interacting with the universe.\"\n\nShe affected a flat expression at all times, but he thought he saw the faintest quiver of an eyebrow at this. \"Sounds stupid -- and when I say stupid, I //don't// mean profound -- but go on.\"\n\nHe could feel himself slipping into lecturer mode. Like Scout before him, he'd moved into a largerly supervisory role at Falconer University now that he had tenure and his cover was intact, but he still delivered the occasional academic harangue, and it was not unlike riding a bicycle. \"Mistakes are how we understand the way things work. You don't learn much from doing everything right. Doing everything wrong? That's practically communion.\"\n\nShe managed to raise her eyebrows without opening her eyes even a sliver wider. \"Now he gets religious at me.\"\n\n\"I'd rather jump out that window.\" He knocked the glass; he would never have had the courage to do so when the water was still there. His overweening sense of responsibility was already demanding that he tell Nascimbeni he'd done this, and the rest of him was dreading the condescenscion he'd get in return. \"But you get what I mean, don't you? Despair, and shame, and hopelessness, or even just irritation, those are all just ways for our emotions to help our brains get smarter. We fuck up, we get mad, we get sad, we get better. If things never got worse, they'd never improve.\"\n\nShe twisted her mouth to one side of her face, and her nose followed suit. \"What do you think they learned when they blew up the universe? Was it proportional? Must've been one hell of an insight.\"\n\nHe puffed in mild agreement. \"Must've been. But we'll never know.\"\n\nThey turned back to the glass. He let her sit with her thoughts in silence for a while.\n\nShe didn't look at him when she started speaking again. \"Know what I think?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"I think everybody's trying to make this mean something because they haven't got enough meaning themselves already.\"\n\n\"Enough for what?\"\n\nShe scuffed the floor with her sneakers. \"To keep going.\"\n\nHe had the sense that this had suddenly become a dangerously important conversation. He considered his next words carefully. \"That's //why// we keep going.\"\n\nShe rolled her eyes.\n\n\"Because things don't mean anything. And that isn't good enough. So we keep moving forward, until they do.\"\n\n\"Structurally unsound.\"\n\nHe felt a sudden stab of panic. Did she mean the glass? //I knew I shouldn't have touched it.// \"What is?\"\n\n\"Your, whatever you call it. Literary construction. We keep moving forward until things mean something? What the fuck does //that// mean.\"\n\nHe laughed, as much in relief as good humour. \"I dunno. I think it means... perspective.\"\n\n\"Perspective.\"\n\n\"Yeah. You can't see things clearly from up close. You don't know how big they are, you can't see the whole shape, you don't really understand all three dimensions. So you move forward, as far as you can, and then you look back, and then you understand. Then it all makes sense.\"\n\nShe seemed to be considering this seriously. \"So it doesn't make sense when it's happening, but then you get some //distance,// and it does?\"\n\n\"Maybe. Or maybe it means something now, and it means more later, with context. Perspective. A different vantage point. But that's only possible if you don't stay stuck in the same spot forever.\" He paused. \"Or if you're dead.\"\n\nShe grunted. \"Nothing means anything when you're dead.\"\n\n\"Nothing meaning anything //is// being dead. So keep looking out that window. Maybe you'll see something today. Maybe you won't know what it was until tomorrow. You'll have to wait and see.\"\n\nShe put a hand to the glass, and didn't say anything.\n\nAfter a few minutes more, he walked back to the tram. Billie was softly humming behind him, and it echoed through the window on the worldlessness.\n\nWhen it was all over, he thought, he might ask if there were any courses to teach at Falconer. \n\nJust a thought.\n\n[!-- [[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/46-nothing-changes/Blank_Billie.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 10 October\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nIt was only by chance that LeClair noticed the wall panel was slightly out of place.\n\nShe'd been staring into space, trying to remember something, when she'd instead forgotten she was holding her pen, and dropped it. It rolled to the wall, and she bent to retrieve it -- her body certainly knew this activity had once been much, much less of a trial -- and saw that the panel disguising her escape route was not quite properly seated in its frame. There was a button under her desk for perfecting the illusion, which only she knew about. She tapped it, and the panel readjusted itself to blend in seamlessly with the rest of the wall.\n\nSo she stood up, and tapped her keycard against the panel to open it up.\n\nShe knew she ought to call security, but curiosity got the better of her.

She'd spent the entire afternoon trying, and failing, to perform some delicate electronics work that one very angry Argentinean woman wouldn't want her performing.

Such was life. \"It didn't work?\"\n\n\"He must be a eunuch.\" Imogen flopped down on the couch, then bounced on the cushions and sprang back to her feet to pace. \"Or maybe he's gay.

Most of these people think with their dicks, and they're all going stir crazy to boot. It should've worked. Madchen, they're fucking around with something down there. Something we need to know about.\"\n\nMadchen shrugged. \"You could try seducing Bremmel, instead of his assistant?\"\n\nThey stared at each other for a few moments. Things had been tense between them since they'd been released from custody, and not only because they knew their every move was being tracked. Madchen wondered if Imogen suspected what she'd been up to. That would be a problem.\n\n\"Because you're my sister,\" Imogen said, very slowly, very carefully, \"I am going to pretend I didn't hear that.\"\n\nMadchen returned to her tablet and screwdriver. \"I'm sure you got //something.//\"\n\nImogen rooted around in the minifridge. \"They've been fucking around in F-A for days now.

So Udo did what she did every time her frustration reached a boiling point, and she needed to get away: she stalked to the nearest subway station, and got on. When it reached the Blue Line terminus, she switched trains and took the only trip she could in their less strange, far less brave new world. A nice little vacation to beautiful no-longer-shoreside AAF-A.\n\nIt was funny how the change in fortunes for everyone else had more dramatically affected the only person who should have been //un//affected. A small crowd of researchers and agents was walking away from the window to the Anomalous Documents Disposal Chamber as Udo walked up to it; Reynders almost always had visitors these days, in large quantities. She was the smartest person in the universe, and one of the kindest, and now that everyone was trapped under non-ground anyway, her company was much in demand. Her prison-within-a-prison contained the only person who really had perspective on what was going on.\n\nOr perhaps it just made people feel better to think there was someone even worse off than them.\n\nIt was probably that.\n\nIt was why Udo was here, after all.\n\n\"Hey.\" She raised a hand in greeting. \n\nReynders was smearing grease paint on her window, crafting a mural. She'd taken up painting only recently, because the academic work she normally busied herself with was too difficult to manage with constant interruptions, and also because she said Helena Forsythe had told her to try it, for stress relief. Helena Forsythe denied having done this; Udo knew that if asked, the little genius would explain that she meant a different Helena Forsythe altogether.\n\nBut only if the Sampis asked, of course. Reynders had long since been briefed on what was going on. Considering she could see it anyway, it had been an easy call to make.\n\n\"Where's the hubby?\" Reynders sang, painting a pale green streak across the glass. The grease paint had been in the ADDC for decades on decades on decades, and was only now seeing use. It had a shelf life, unopened, of perhaps a few years. It would nevertheless have lasted forever had she not decided to finally start expending it.\n\nUdo scowled. \"Don't call him that.\"\n\n\"Another argument, huh.\" Reynders was rendering -- //ha// -- a peculiarly vibrant sunset or sunrise. Something she hadn't seen since the world was last at war. Something no-one had seen since the world had last existed. Given its nature, the sun she'd seen had never been seen by another living soul. \"Do you ever think you're being too hard on him?\"\n\n\"No.\" Udo stamped her foot emphatically. It made her feel very foolish. \"I don't think I'm being hard enough on him. I don't think anyone is. He falls back into the worst habits the moment I look away.\"\n\n\"One relates.\" Reynders reached up and tugged at a lock of her orange bowlcut; it sprang back into place, precisely, with unseemly speed. \"We're all just cycles of ourselves.\"\n\nUdo reached up to paw at her own hair. It was cut short, again, months ahead of the usual deadline schedule. She'd hoped it would give her a more severe look. She tried not to think about why she would want that.\n\n\"What's your endgame with him, anyway?\" Reynders studded the green streak with dots of white, and began rubbing them in. \"Is this a dry run for doing a better job in baseline, or is it just a fling?\"\n\nIt was hard, sometimes, to remember that the other woman came from an era of strikingly different norms and morality. The Foundation was always ahead of most curves, of course, since most curves had some scientific basis and the Foundation had most science before most people, but a woman from the 1940s was still essentially a woman //of// the 1940s, unless she made the effort to change. Reynders had apparently made that effort, if she could conceptualize a //fling// as something that was acceptable for a young woman like Udo to embark upon.\n\nOr maybe that was antihistorical bullshit. They'd had flappers and shit in the 1930s, hadn't they? She almost wished she could ask Harry.\n\nAlmost.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she admitted. \"I just think... I don't know. We're here, now.\"\n\n\"Very true.\" Reynders was more here, more now, than anyone else. Ever.\n\n\"And I guess I see him, and I want to... help?\" Was that right? Was that even remotely what she meant? \"I want to do //something.// For him.\" //For him.// \"There's a lot of potential.\"\n\n\"Raw material?\" Reynders suggested, swiping a grey streak between green and orange for emphasis.\n\nUdo rolled her eyes ruefully. \"That makes me sound like some domineering bitch. And I don't think I am. Do you think I am?\"\n\n\"I'll defer to your judgement on that. But I've always thought you were a fine young lady.\" There it was. The occasional turn of phrase that suggested this was a woman of more years, more //ages,// than her face hinted at. Even before the accident, she'd been older than she looked.\n\n\"Phil thinks so too. He thinks I'm a superhero and a supermodel at the same time. That's good enough for him. But I think... he could do better.\"\n\n\"Than you?\"\n\n\"No, than what he's //doing.// Because he's doing //nothing!//\" Again, infuriatingly, her foot stamped in fury. \"I don't know how he doesn't realize he's wasting his life away. It's plain as day to everyone else. Do you think it matters, what happens to us in here? Since we're going to...\" She paused, then pulled out her tablet and checked the subroutine Veiksaar had installed for her. There were no prying ears nearby. \"Since we're going to reset it anyway.\"\n\n\"Character is who you are in the margins,\" Reynders smiled. She swirled her finger through the sun in speculative spirals.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/46-nothing-changes/DL_46_06_Reynders_Smile.jpg]]\n\n\"Mm.\" Udo sighed. \"I guess.

Bremmel had been made the tech tsar for developing sustainability initiatives, and had come up trumps time and again; the hydroponics labs were now working at what Ghosh estimated to be four hundred percent efficiency, and the turfgrass manager himself had managed to speed-run the discovery of two entirely new strains of edible grass. The resultant fivefold increase in food production meant they would soar handily past the deadline, not that anyone involved was aware this was a consideration.\n\nWhat Bremmel designed, Nascimbeni built and made work. He pushed himself to the limit, and past. He worked hours he'd not seen since he was a very young man, with something to prove. Some of his staff were inspired to rise to the occasion with him, but most were content to accept the lesson in leadership and hard work as something to aspire to, just not quite yet.

Working on engineering projects. I've got a bit of expertise in the matter; they had very good teachers, where I come from, and all the illusion in the world can't disguise a genuine fraud forever.\"\n\n\"I dunno,\" Ibanez mused. \"I've seen a lot of episodes of //The Fugitive.//\"\n\nAlis didn't acknowledge the sidebar at all. \"What I'm saying is, this isn't completely an act.

I've probably done less spying on Foundation employees than you have.\"\n\nIbanez smiled, and stood up. \"That's good. I like that. You want a beer?\"\n\nAlis sprawled back in the chair. \"Sure. You'll want to have a prop to play with while you pretend not to listen to what I have to say.\"\n\nWhen Ibanez had tossed her a bottle and sat back down, immediately beginning to peel away the neck label, Alis continued. \"So, the Tarrows. You should kill them.\"\n\nIbanez took a pull on the bottle, savouring the flat and bitter taste a little before swallowing both the beer and her first, harsher response. It //was// safer to have a prop, sometimes. \"Why's that?\"\n\n\"Because they're true believers. You know what //they've// been up to the last few months?

I cheated it out of him. He's not as stupid as you think he is, but he can't keep a secret from me. I'm willing to bet not many of you could.

You know my staying alive depends on the situation here remaining stable, and you know I'm smart enough to know that, so you know I'm not going to rock the boat. You've known that all along, or you wouldn't have let me go free.

I guess. But still, I think I'll kneecap him for symbolic purposes.\"\n\nAlis chugged down half the beer, and wiped her lips with her labcoat sleeve. \"Fair enough.\"\n\n\"But what's your point, anyway?\"\n\n\"My point,\" and the other woman leaned forward, as she instinctually did whenever she wanted to be extra convincing -- //props again,// Ibanez thought, and had to stifle a laugh -- and made eye contact for a long, long moment. \"My point is that //I// don't care to see everything burned down.

Yeah? Maybe you'll tell me something about that death cult of yours I don't already know.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" Alis sat back again; was it Ibanez's imagination, or did she seem to be curling up into herself, as though recoiling from an outburst that hadn't happened yet, but inevitably would? Probably it was the sleep deprivation, the frustration, and the beer working together with her undernourished imagination. Life in a blank expanse was dull indeed, and the mind would have its fascinations one way or another. \"Here's the first thing. Madchen and Imogen? I don't think they're both in the same death cult.\"\n\nIbanez raised an eyebrow. \"What?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"No, what?\" They'd had their suspicions since the monitoring process, and of course Ibanez had heard the five-second foreshadowing in Alis' speech, but she had to keep up the façade. Never let the enemy know how much you know. \"I thought they were both with you.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I thought so too. But Madchen was going behind Imogen's back, and I was watching you today. Yesterday. Whatever. She was trying to find Wirth, but not like her sister was. I think she wanted to kill him.\"\n\nIbanez whistled. \"Why would she want to do that?\"\n\n\"Search me.\"\n\n\"Don't tempt.

The other woman was definitely tensed against a coming strike now. \"You were talking earlier about spending months surrounded by unseen threats. You were talking about Zevala, right?\"\n\nIbanez leaned forward and gently placed her beer on the ground, against the leg of the couch. She did this because the feeling was suddenly draining out of her hands, and she didn't want to spill it. \"That's right.\" She wanted to ask: //Where did you hear that name?// But she couldn't, because she had no feeling in her mouth, either.
