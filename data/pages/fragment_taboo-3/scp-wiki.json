Only descriptions may be used when referring to **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the forest outside normative space[[/span]]** and native entities thereof. Variations must be made in these descriptions each time a subject is described. Descriptions may use alternate typefaces for clarity,[[footnote]]To revert back to color coding, [/taboo/offset/0 click here.][[/footnote]] and florid language may be used for the sake of nomenclative diversity. \n\nIn the event of a nomenclative containment breach, standard Eshu Class recontainment protocol must be carried out immediately by the individual responsible for the breach. If the individual is rendered unable to perform the procedure, the responsibility falls to the individual's next of kin. \n\nIf the individual responsible for the breach has no known next of kin, the individual's name must be expurgated from all existing documents and records; any other individuals possessing the same name are to be administered Type-G viral amnestics and assigned a new one.  \n\nIn accordance with Order O5-4000-F26, at least one successful expedition into **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the strange and dangerous woodland area[[/span]]** must be carried out per year to assess any deviations from baseline abnormality. Due to the high risk involved in entering **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the place where the nameless are found[[/span]]**, personnel sent in to conduct research **must** be trained in Standard Exploration Protocol as detailed in 4000-SEP.\n\nUnauthorized documentation of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the forest found in chimneys[[/span]]** must be suppressed via standard information containment protocol. Unauthorized individuals with knowledge of Procedure 4000-Halloway are to be administered amnestics[[footnote]]Amnestic class to be determined on a case-by-case basis.[[/footnote]] and may be released following a period of disquisitional rehabilitation.\n\n**Description:** **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]The SCP in question[[/span]]** is an extradimensional forested area with numerous anomalous qualities, including a hazardous nomenclative phenomenon. **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]This anomalous location[[/span]]** is accessed by performing 4000-Halloway (see document DOC-4000-H). After completing the procedure, subjects emerge from the opening of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'amitaregular';font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;\"]]a dilapidated brick well[[/span]]** fixed into the forest floor (see fig 1.2).\n\nThe only way to reliably traverse **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the unusual terrain[[/span]]** is by use of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]a single dirt path[[/span]]**. Explorations that diverged from **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]said route[[/span]]** have resulted in immediate loss of contact with participating subjects. **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]The sole safe road[[/span]]** may only be traversed in a single direction, and any attempt by subjects to turn back and return the way they came will result in similar loss of contact.\n\n**[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]The unnamed world[[/span]]** does not adhere to the constraints of linear space. Cartographic endeavors have resulted in vastly different routes being recorded with each expedition, and sections of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]the mandatory trail[[/span]]** which should logically overlap or intersect do not.[[footnote]]Similar topographic abnormalities have been observed in geonormative forests as well, though no direct connections between these phenomena have been confirmed. ^^[[[scp-416|1]]] [[[dr-manns-proposal|2]]]^^ [[/footnote]] The only consistency in the layout is the **[[span style=\"font-family: 'amitaregular';font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;\"]]access point[[/span]]**, which is always located at both ends of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]the main road[[/span]]**. \n\nThe only way for a subject to safely exit **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the woods which have no name[[/span]]** after they have begun following it is by walking its entire length and returning to **[[span style=\"font-family: 'amitaregular';font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;\"]]the place where they began[[/span]]** at the opposite end.\n\nA variety of anomalous entities native to **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the nameless habitat[[/span]]** have been documented. Native entities often undergo changes in physical structure when unobserved, which has made it difficult for researchers to determine which recorded entities are unique beings and which are newer iterations of those previously documented. Entities claim they have no control over these changes and frequently express dissatisfaction when they occur. \n\nNative entities often obstruct **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]the trail which subjects tread[[/span]]**, making it necessary for subjects to interact with them to progress. Native entities are sapient and often highly temperamental, but can be interacted with safely as long as 4000-SEP precautions are followed.[[footnote]]Rare occasions have been recorded where native entities appeared inherently inimical toward human life.[[/footnote]] Consequences for disregarding these precautions will vary depending on the personality of the offended entity: degrees of retribution encountered by research subjects have included verbal rebuke, acts of violence, and anomalous alteration of the subject's physical, conceptual, or nomenclative attributes.\n\nVarious anomalous phenomena may occur when consistent nomenclature is applied to **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the realm of the unnamable[[/span]]**, its native entities, or its landmarks. These phenomena are still poorly understood, partially due to the prohibition of nomenclative experimentation under Order O5-4000-F26.\n\nDocumented nomenclative phenomena have included:\n\n* Episodic cluster headaches among subjects exposed to affected nomenclature.\n* Visual and auditory hallucinations among exposed subjects, usually involving environments or entities described by nomenclature. Gustatory hallucinations and phantosmia have also been reported in a small subset of cases. \n* Sudden onset of psychogenic amnesia among exposed subjects. \n* The development of nonhuman physical characteristics among exposed subjects, such as feathers and pollen sacs. \n* The development of biological components in non-biological mediums where nomenclature is written or recorded.\n* Sudden involuntary transport of exposed subjects to **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the wilderness of unnamed things[[/span]]** without the use of Procedure 4000-Halloway. \n* Manifestation of various flora within indoor spaces where nomenclature was used.\n* Sudden transport of native entities to areas where nomenclature was used.\n* Biological fusion of exposed subjects and native entities.\n* Biological fusion of native entities and architectural spaces where nomenclature was used.\n* Extreme iron deficiency in exposed subjects, with an absence of expected negative side effects.\n\nOrder O5-4000-F26 was ratified by the Overseer Council in 1954. A 1970 amendment requires that O5-4000-F26 receive unanimous endorsement from the Council every 10 years in order to remain in effect. To date, no Overseer memos regarding O5-4000-F26 have been disseminated to lower clearance levels.\n\n------\n+ [[size 0%]]##white|.##[[/size]]\n[[collapsible show=\"► Notable Containment Breaches\" hide=\"▼ Accessing content.

Circumstances of the discovery are unclear due to a lack of surviving personnel, but a general timeline of events has been established. Timestamps are in standard NATO format.\n> \n> **[1340S]** **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]The hollow of unspoken titles[[/span]]** is discovered and given a temporary Type-E[[footnote]]Archaic object class used as a preliminary designation for newly discovered anomalies still in an unsecured state.[[/footnote]] designation by field agent Garret Bradley, creating nomenclative breach. \n> \n> **[1345S]** Field agent Moira Denotti enters **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the land beyond the flue[[/span]]** and is never recovered. \n> \n> **[1347S]** Agent Bradley begins to gradually sink into the hardwood floor. Nearby agents flee the area.\n> \n> **[1348S]** Soon after exiting the house, all agents are suddenly rendered immobile, with the exception of Timothy Woods, who was not aware of the Type-E designation.\n> \n> **[1349S]** Immobilized agents vocalize distress as their torsos elongate. \n> \n> **[1351S]** Elongation ceases after agents have reached a height approximating that of the chimney where Procedure 4000-Halloway was performed. Smoke expels from their facial orifices. Timothy Woods reports these developments via radio to Site-08. Secondary breach is caused when Timothy Woods repeatedly uses the phrase \"the █████\" to describe **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the world where words have power[[/span]]**.\n> \n> **[1355S]** Timothy Woods states that he \"sees [his] name in the trees\". Site-08 Personnel press Timothy Woods for further information. Timothy Woods attempts to orally consume his radio and soon expires from internal injuries.\n> \n> **[1359S]** Timothy Woods' correspondents in Site-08 are observed suffering from severe headaches and are placed under quarantine. \n> \n> **[1424S]** Osteal protrusions resembling tree branches emerge from the orbital cavities of quarantined Site-08 personnel. Personnel report no physical discomfort despite exhibiting full globe luxation in both sockets. \n> \n> **Afterword:** Nomenclative anomaly eventually discovered after numerous cycles of multivariable D-Class exposure to affected Site-08 personnel. \n\n> **Breach Date:** 22 December, 1955\n> \n> **Named subject:** **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]The footpath which loops around the entire area[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Summary:** Desk Desk completed the first successful exploratory mission in **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]the grove beneath nameless stars[[/span]]** and was immediately quarantined. After exhibiting no anomalous effects for 72 hours, Desk Desk was then allowed to write an account of his experiences. When researchers returned to check on his progress, Desk Desk had vanished. Traces of soil and human tissue were later found in the pencil, paper, and harvey mansfield Desk Desk had used in his writing.\n\n> **Breach Date:** 19 August, 1958\n> \n> **Named subject:** The native entity that sits atop a throne of bones and cradles a flaming child\n> \n> **Summary:** After completing an exploratory mission, field agent Ethan Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy used the same epithet several times when describing a particular native entity. Several minutes later, he complained of severe nausea and began to vomit blood and bone marrow. \n> \n> Over the course of several hours, Agent Mercy Mercy Mercy Mercy was reported to have somehow orally expelled most of his bones. Personnel throughout Site-08 experience auditory hallucinations of a woman's laughter for the next several days.\n\n> **Breach Date:** 4 March, 1966\n> \n> **Named subject:** The native entity that resembles a feathered lion with a skeletal ram's head\n> \n> **Summary:** College student Vanessa Hayforth attempted to check into numerous medical facilities in and around Portland, Oregon, complaining that her head had become covered in flesh despite exhibiting no signs of unusual tissue growth. She was eventually detained by Foundation investigators and found to be in possession of a book that described (among other things)[[footnote]]The full contents of the book are restricted to Level 5 personnel under Order O5-4000-F26. However, official statements have noted that certain rituals and locations described in the book bear strong similarities to [[[SCP-1660]]] and [[[SCP-860]]]. Recent declassifications have revealed that another passage may have been written in reference to [[[SCP-3560]]], which was discovered more than 50 years after the book's recovery. The significance of SCP-3560 potentially predating the existence of Anderson Robotics has yet to be determined.[[/footnote]] Procedure 4000-Halloway in its entirety. After stipulating that Foundation personnel assist in removing the flesh from her head if she cooperated,[[footnote]]No such procedure was ever carried out.[[/footnote]] Hayforth confessed that she had received the book from an acquaintance in the Wanderer's Library. \n> \n> **Afterword:** This was the first known case of a civilian-triggered nomenclative breach. Similar incidents have occurred intermittently since. In 2012, a native entity was photographed that superficially resembled a young Hayforth (Fig 1.1), more than two decades after Hayforth died in Foundation custody. \n\n> **Breach Date:** 30 October, 1992\n> \n> **Named subject:** The house in which Michael Ashley Vincent spent several nights during his exploratory mission.\n> \n> **Summary:** Agent Michael Ashley Vincent, who had completed an exploratory mission several years prior, used the possessive phrase \"██ house\" several times while recounting stories to two of his colleagues, who did not have names.[[footnote]]This statement has been flagged for potential memetic corruption: \"//I don't care what the records say. After 30 years in the Department of Memetics, you learn when to follow your gut, and right now my gut is telling me that there's something off about this.//\" — Dr. Storum.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> Some time later, a large brick building manifested inside Site-08, intersecting with existing architecture. Michael Ashley Vincent's headless body was found inside, seizing violently and fused at the neck to a light fixture made of elk antlers. His face, which did not appear animate, had enlarged to take up the entire surface area of the building's floor. \n> \n> Field agents sent into the face's mouth found that it did not possess a full digestive tract; however, Michael Ashley Vincent's nameless colleagues were reported to have been conjoined with its uvula. \n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[size 0%]]##white|.##[[/size]]\n------\n+ [[size 0%]]##white|.##[[/size]]\n[[collapsible show=\"► 4000-Halloway\" hide=\"▼ Accessing content.

I'm sorry, I'm afraid I can't tell you that. \n> \n> //Dr. Japers bows.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Are you //simple?// I'm merely asking how your name is. //My// name has smelt of raspberries lately, I think—or snapdragons, perhaps. It's so hard to tell these days, but one makes an effort.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Ah, my apologies. I'm afraid my name has tasted rather tart as of late.[[footnote]]Dr. Japers was later reprimanded for violating SEP-2.03.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]Leporine entity[[/span]]** laughs and doffs its hat.// \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"No, I'm the one who should apologize. I shouldn't have pried.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** It's quite all right. I don't mind at all. It has been lovely to meet you, but I must be on my way.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Must you, though? My home is close by, and I was hoping to invite you in for tea.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers bows again.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I'm terribly sorry, but unfortunately I cannot stop at this moment. Perhaps another day.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Very well. Until next time, stranger whose name tastes rather tart.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **[End Log]**\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Encounter 2]]\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Eugene Japers \n> \n> **Interviewee description:** **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The gentleman with the leporine visage[[/span]]**.\n> \n> **Foreword:** Interview conducted in 2008 during Dr. Japers' fourth expedition into **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]that burrow betwixt the bricks[[/span]]**.  \n> \n> ------\n> \n> **[Begin Log]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers crests a hill and discovers **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]his hare-like acquaintance[[/span]]** tending to a patch of cabbages.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Good afternoon, stranger. Except—ah, pardon me. We've met before, haven't we?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Good afternoon. I believe so, yes. Three years ago, if memory serves.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I remember now. You ran in off quite a hurry.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Yes, my apologies for that. At that time I was new here and wary of those I encountered. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Still the apologetic one, I see. No matter. You are not from here? Very interesting. What woods are you from?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I do not come from any woods. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Nonsense. Certainly you have trees where you're from, do you not?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** We do have trees, but they're very sparse. Most of the land is covered in homes and businesses. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Then they are inferior woods, but woods nonetheless. Tell me, how did you get here?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I see you have an inquiring mind. I would like to ask //you// a question, if that's all right. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Pardon my lack of manners. I consider myself something of a scholar, you see, and I get a bit excited when I have a chance to learn of forests outside my own. By all means, pose your question.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** When we last met, you said it had become difficult to describe your name. Do you have any theories for why that may be?\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I can only assume it's because of how long we've been apart—my name and I, that is. It was a good name, a proud name, I'm fairly sure. By this point, though, it's probably decayed from its former grandeur, if it even still exists.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Where do you think it is currently?\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"First, fellow scholar, you must answer my previous question.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers nods.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I came through the **[[span style=\"font-family: 'amitaregular';font-weight:bold;font-size:1.2em;\"]]old but distinguished well[[/span]]** at the end of **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]the footpath I'm presently perambulating[[/span]]**.[[footnote]]This information is not considered classified from native entities.[[/footnote]]\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The other individual[[/span]]** hesitates before speaking.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Oh my. It's been //quite// some time. I'll be frank, I thought all the old allies had died out. Did your grandfather or some such relation have a lover out here?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers bows.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** My deepest apologies, I'm afraid I cannot answer that question.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Very well. I understand. I'd invite you to my cottage for tea, but I suppose that's not possible for you, is it?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I'm afraid not.\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The conversational partner[[/span]]** laughs, plucks a cabbage leaf, and offers it to Dr. Japers.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"You needn't fear so much. Take this, and be on your way.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers accepts the leaf with both hands.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Thank you very much.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Happy travels to you, and may you find the one you're looking for.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **[End Log]**\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **Afterword:** Dr. Japers later used the cabbage leaf to feed a native entity resembling a field mouse, which in turn aided him on his travels. \n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Encounter 3]]\n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Eugene Japers \n> \n> **Interviewee description:** **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The leaf-giver[[/span]]**.\n> \n> **Foreword:** Interview conducted in 2013 during Dr. Japers' ninth expedition into **[[span style=\"font-family: 'museo';font-weight:700;font-size:1.2em\"]]yonder vale of restless wanderers[[/span]]**. Due to the unique knowledge that the **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]one who bore the gift of cabbage[[/span]]** seemed to possess about our world, Dr. Japers was instructed to conduct a more thorough interview should it be encountered a third time. \n> \n> Additionally, Dr. Japers was granted special permission to make false statements for the sake of facilitating conversation, as his first encounter showed **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]the fluffy one[[/span]]** to be susceptible to deceptions. \n> \n> ------\n> \n> **[Begin Log]**\n> \n> //Traveling along **[[span style=\"font-family: 'palitoonregular';font-size:1.6em;\"]]the way of weary adventurers[[/span]]**, Dr. Japers encounters a small white cottage with a thatched roof. A small opening in the shape of a rabbit's head is cut into the front door. Dr. Japers approaches it and knocks.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Hello? Is anyone home?\n> \n> //(Voice slightly muffled from inside)//  **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Yes, one minute.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Exactly one minute passes. The door opens.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Ah, we meet again! Please, come in, come in.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers is led inside. The interior is sparsely decorated with wooden furniture and needlework.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** You have a lovely home.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Ha! //You// have a lovely sense of humor.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The homeowner[[/span]]** hurries to a kitchenette in the corner and begins preparing a kettle.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** No, really. I think it's charming. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I suppose. It was just meant to be until things cooled down on the other side, but, well, you know.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I'm afraid I //don't// know. Would you like some help?\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"No, no no no. You just have yourself a seat at the table over there while I get the tea ready for us.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers draws a chair and seats himself.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** You're most generous, but I don't think my digestion will permit it. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Oh, poor fellow. Well, I find the presence of tea to be a comfort in any case.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** You are most kind. Tell me, could you explain what you meant by 'cooled down'?\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]His furred host[[/span]]** turns the stove on and stares out a window cut into a similar shape as the hole on the door.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Your relations didn't tell you the full story, I suppose. About the turmoil that drove us here.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Turmoil? Was there a war?\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The tufted one[[/span]]** sighs.// \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Isn't there [[[scp-2932|always]]]?\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** My grandparents did tell me there were wars, but I never knew of one with you and your kind.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"It doesn't surprise me. There are very few even in these woods that still remember. Memory is the burden of the old, I suppose. But yes. When I was a young lad, in a form very different from the one I possess now, I lived on the other end of the well. It's where I was born, where I grew up, and if I dare to dream, where I will someday return.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Why don't you, then?\n> \n> //The kettle whistles.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I can't. Not unless I know I could be welcomed back.[[/span]]**\"\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The maker of the tea[[/span]]** pours a cup and seats itself across the table.//\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I'm sure you don't know this, since they keep themselves hidden, but there are those who would destroy me at nearest chance—ah, my apologies. These are dark memories, I'm sure you don't want to hear about them.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //**[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The teller of the story[[/span]]** sips its tea.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** No, please, go on. These things are of interest to me—I am a fellow scholar, remember?\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"As you wish, fellow scholar. I shall talk until the tea is cold.\"[[/span]]** \n> \n> (//It clears its throat.//) \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Much as it grieves me to say it, we were betrayed. We had fought side-by-side, you know, in [[[scp-001-o5|the war against that factory.]]] We had done nothing but help them, and what did they do? They destroyed us. They took so many of our lives, and //all// of our names. Some of us fled here when the war was just beginning, but not many. Not many. Still, though, I don't hate them.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** I'm glad for that.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I'd imagine so! There are some old fogies around these parts who bear a grudge against the whole species, but I know you're not all bad. There were many who sheltered us, fought for us, even died for us. Some came to live here amongst us, rest their souls. I, myself, courted a human once upon a time. He came to visit a time or two, but I never saw him after that. I still wonder now and again if he fell at the hand of an unkind neighbor, or if he merely stopped caring to see me. But it's no matter, now. I apologize for prattling on about old flames. Certainly such things are of no interest to you, fellow scholar.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** On the contrary, I'd quite like to hear more of these stories. The life of you and your people is of great interest to me.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"I'm sure it is, //fellow scholar//.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //A strong breeze moves through the house. Neither party speaks for half a minute. **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]The rabbit-person who lives there[[/span]]** grunts and places a hand to its head, as if in pain. Dr. Japers places his hand against the teapot.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** It appears the tea has gotten cold. I think it's time I took my leave.\n> \n> //(Speech slightly slurred)// **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"What? You're leaving? I—I should leave too, then.\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers rises from the table.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** No, no no no. I'll be going alone, thank you. It's abrupt, yes, and I'm grievously sorry to do this, but I really must be going. I believe I'm long overdue to return home.\n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"What is—? I don't... Please, don't go. Something isn't—\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** It can't be helped. \n> \n> **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]\"Stop! What have you //done?// I don't know who... what happened to my name? I can't...\"[[/span]]**\n> \n> //Dr. Japers quickly exits the house. **[[span style=\"font-family: 'my_underwoodregular';\"]]His former companion[[/span]]** whimpers and looks at its hands as he leaves.//\n> \n> **Dr. Japers:** Hm.
