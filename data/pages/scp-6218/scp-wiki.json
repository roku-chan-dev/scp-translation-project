The media and many academic institutions were planted with the idea that the universe is expanding and that humanity is trapped within the Milky Way's local group. \n\nProvisional Site-6218 has been constructed on the surface of SCP-6218. It is currently operational and manned by 18 rotating D-Class personnel from Site-9, who warp in and out with Triple-T[[footnote]]TTT, or Thaumaturgical Teleportation Threads: A catch-all term for fibers, textiles, and tape inscribed with a spell that teleports an object it is wrapped around to one of any number of preset teleportation circles. It is activated when its companion thread is cut, usually with scissors.[[/footnote]] and maintain the site's machinery. Provisional Site-6218 is to be used for dangerous experiments involving pre-approved anomalies, a list of which is found in Addendum 2.6.2010.\n\nNo one, under any circumstance, can stay on its surface for longer than two hours. \n[[div class=\"scp-image-block\" style=\"width:33%; float: right; padding:0px 25px 25px 25px;\"]]\n[[image Figure1.png style=\"width:100%\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nFigure 1.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**##fff|Description:##**\n\nSCP-6218 refers to a spherical body outside of the observable universe[[footnote]]The observable universe is not the entire universe, only as far as the laws of physics allow light to travel before it can no longer reach Earth.[[/footnote]] that contains the full universe.[[footnote]]Not to be confused with the known universe, the full universe is everywhere within baseline reality that the Foundation can traverse via physical means.[[/footnote]] It is estimated to be 2,108 billion light-years in diameter. For reference, Earth's solar system is 0.3 light-years in diameter.\n\nThe surface consists of black dust, primarily carbon. Its atmosphere is lethal to most humans, consisting of a previously unknown compound designated Y-2108. Despite the size and apparent mass of the surface, it has a disproportionately low amount of gravitational pull. Its force is roughly 0.2g, slightly more than Earth's moon. \n\n**##fff|Discovery:##**\n\nSCP-6218 was discovered by the crew of IV-38[[footnote]]Short for Intergalactic Vessel 38. All Foundation issue intergalactic vessels come equipped with Anomalous Object [[span style=\"filter:blur(4px);\"]]Ex Altiora[[/span]]. This anomaly stops time around an object so long as it is not biological matter. This acts as instantaneous travel between points A and B, no matter how far apart those points are in space. This anomaly, along with complex AICs, was how the Foundation advanced so far ahead of the non-anomalous world.[[/footnote]] while flying outside of the observable universe investigating another anomaly. They noticed that there were fewer stars visible on the starboard side of the ship than on the port side. The gradation between the two hemispheres was photographed and recorded in figure 1. \n\nIV-38 traveled into the hemisphere without stars and noticed that light from some of the stars was reflecting off of a single surface, SCP-6218. Attempting to fly around SCP-6218 to gauge its size, they determined from its curvature that they were on the inside of a sphere. They touched down and took samples, resulting in our basic knowledge of its makeup. They left the expedition early because they expressed a feeling of fear while on the surface. \n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: December 14th, 2001\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** O5 Command ([[span style=\"filter:blur(4px);\"]]o5encryptedchannel@lv4.scip.net[[/span]]), site9@staff.scip.net...\n**From:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Memorandum on the end of the world.\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nThe discovery made by the brave crew of Intergalactic Vessel 38 is both fascinating and disconcerting. We're classifying it as a new SCP, number 6218. I'd bet that it's the biggest one ever. \n\nThe entire universe is contained within a massive cave. For once, this anomaly is containing us.\n\nAt first, I felt a little disappointed by this discovery. Infinity just sounded more exciting to me. Then I realized something: if it has an end, then it's knowable. Someday, humanity will have charted the entire universe. \n\nI propose that we build a provisional site on SCP-6218. Because of its distance from Earth alone, it could prove an invaluable containment location for dangerous anomalies. \n\n[[>]]\nAlways,\nAnastasia.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe O5 council approved Director Moriette's proposal with a vote of 9-4, and Provisional Site-6218 was established. The appointed head of the site is Professor Boris Kovalenko. \n\n[[=]]\n**The remainder of this document requires Clearance Level 4.**\n[[collapsible show=\"- Input Clearance -\" hide=\"- Granted -\"]]\n@@ @@\n+ The Construction Process:\n[[<]]\n\nWhat follows is a log of Professor Kovalenko's correspondence with Site-9 Director Moriette regarding the process of constructing Provisional Site-6218. \n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: January 31st, 2002\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Update Regarding Prov Site-6218\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, I would like to thank you again for appointing me to this position. It's an honor to be in charge of such an important scientific discovery. But something just happened recently, and I thought you would like to know.\n\nWe started construction this morning. One of our crew had a rather alarming encounter with his dead fiancé on the surface of SCP-6218 this afternoon. Before long, another was seen carrying an invisible child, and another claimed that his stalker had followed him to SCP-6218.\n\nThese things all turned out to be nothing more than mirages, but they affected everyone working there, on the first day of construction no less. They had only been up there for four hours. This is no cabin fever, I think the surface of SCP-6218 might be hallucinogenic in some way. I'll need an expert in cognitohazards and such to look into this for me. God knows I'm never stepping foot up there after this. \n\nIn the meantime, I'll need more men. The cost for the psych evaluations has already put a sizable dent in our budget. The icing on the cake is that doctor Skye[[footnote]]Agent Ivy Skye, the Psychiatrist on Site-9.[[/footnote]] said they were unfit to work. \n\nThere was one thing of note that came out of the evaluations, though. Every single one of their hallucinations told them to leave.\n\nPlease respond. \n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: October 17th, 2002\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Update: Lost progress in construction\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, your two-hour solution for the hallucinations worked like a charm! We had some minor incidents here and there, but they've been ironed out. \n\nHowever, I'm afraid I have more bad news. There was a series of earthquakes, and it looks like they won't stop any time soon. We figured it would be a one-off incident, so we waited until we thought it stopped the first time, and around four days into construction it happened again.\n\nLooking into it further, we found that these earthquakes occur regularly, every 8 to 10 days. They can last up to 30 hours, but that's not the interesting part. They're passing over the site like a wave, and the wave's origin is from a single direction, I'll call it the east. \n\nWe tried building somewhere else, lightyears away from the original location. Wouldn't you know it, more earthquakes. We tried two more times. Same intensity, same interval, different point of origin. Tests showed that the areas were hallucinogenic as well. \n\nWe've wasted a lot of the budget already. I think we'll need more funds and more men if you want us to continue. Not only that, the schematics we have now aren't going to cut it. I believe that while the risks of the project may cause psychological pain to some of the builders, this is important for the greater good. Whatever's causing these earthquakes is a force on the scale of all existence.\n\nPlease respond. \n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: February 20th, 2003\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Building Progress\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, I don't know how but you've done it again. Who came up with putting the entire building on suspensions? Genius. We're finished clearing out the base now. If construction keeps going as smoothly as it is now we can start looking into the secrets of SCP-6218.\n\nPlease Respond.\n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: July 30th, 2006\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Update: Experiment's Results\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nI'm fairly confident now that the schematics we're using will work. We should finish up construction sometime around 2010. With that date approaching, I began the first project looking into the cause of SCP-6218's earthquake. I rented a Foundation craft and we tried following one of the earthquakes as it passed the site. We couldn't. \n\nMy instinct is to simply say it was too big, but that doesn't do it justice. When everything is rumbling, it looks like nothing is rumbling, if that makes sense. From that vantage point, I could tell that the secret lies underground. \n\nOnce we're done building the site, the first big job will be digging a quarry into SCP-6218. I hope you agree. \n\nPlease Respond.\n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nConstruction of Provisional Site-6218 was completed on February 14th, 2010. \n\nDirector Moriette approved Kovelenko's proposal, and the mining operation commenced two weeks later.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n+ The Mining Operation:\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: March 1st, 2010\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Mining has begun.\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, we chose a location for the quarry: a crater near the site. The obvious problem with digging into SCP-6218 is going to be the earthquakes. Every level that the miners dig out will be reinforced by metal plates and wooden beams to ensure that the progress lost from every quake is minimal. I will update you as I move forward. \n\nPlease respond. \n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: April 9th, 2011\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** There was a murder\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, an update. The makeup of SCP-6218's crust is a smattering of minerals typical to many terrestrial planets, and the layering is as expected. The plates are holding up well enough, but the workers are complaining about having to replace the beams every time. \n\nSo some background, one of our workers had an accident. He cut open his spacesuit. After the initial panic, we discovered that humans can breathe in the atmosphere of SCP-6218, even though Y-2108 contains little to no oxygen. After that, the workers asked to work without their spacesuits. So I let them, thinking nothing of it. \n\nI think this is what lead to the murder last week. One of my workers, D-27134, hallucinated that D-35090 was a man by the name of Matthew Jeffreys. Jeffreys was D-27134's old roommate, whom D-27134 murdered two years prior, earning him his D-class status. \n\nIt wasn't until today that we discovered that Y-2108 is behind these hallucinations. If we had known sooner, I wouldn't have had to lose any workers. But we didn't, so from now on the workers need to wear oxygen tanks. \n\nThankfully, D-35090 was in the D-class because of a particularly heinous crime, so when you think about it he deserved to die. I'm hazy on the details, but if you tell that to those workers in a tizzy it should calm them down. \n\nPlease Respond. \n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: July 3rd, 2018\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** We've struck sludge\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, we've dug 2.3 kilometers down now.

I'm an expert in the parabiology department. \n\nI had a look at the sludge your crew uncovered. It isn't just any sludge; it's a membrane. This kind of membrane is found in animal cells. The coating of oils on its surface indicates that it's a skin cell. The average skin cell, on a human, is 30 micrometers large. For reference, this is about as thick as a strand of hair.\n\nThis 'cell' is the size of a lake. If it behaves like cells on an average organism, then there are presumably trillions upon trillions of these cells, making up some kind of cosmic superbeing. \n\nThis particular cell is dead, but that doesn't mean that the superbeing is as a whole. It's common for skin cells on the outermost layer of an animal to be dead. The workers on-site told me about the earthquakes and how they work. I believe that the earthquakes are caused by this being's pulse. The scale fits, and I don't see any other explanation for the ground rumbling like that. \n\n-Lee.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: July 8th, 2018\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** Fwd: Sludge on the surface of SCP-6218\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nDirector Moriette, there's a being underneath SCP-6218. I just received word from the scientist you sent up there.\n\nLet's call this being SCP-6218-B, and change SCP-6218 to SCP-6218-A. If Eun-Choi is right about the earthquakes, then we need to take immediate action. The earthquakes indicate that the being extends all over the surface of SCP-6218-A. We need to understand what it is. \n\nThe problem is, again, it's too big. We can't comprehend the being's shape from outside without considerable effort. This is going to sound crazy, but I propose we build a submarine and send a team of specialists in to dive into its cells. \n\nPlease respond. \n\nProfessor Boris Kovalenko, Ph.D.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n+ Exploration of SCP-6218-B:\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\nSent: July 28th, 2018\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Boris Kovalenko (bkovalenko83@staff.scip.net), Anastasia Moriette, Director, Site-9 (amoriette84@staff.scip.net)\n**From:** Amber Ignatia (aignatia97@staff.scip.net)\n**Subject:** submarine schematics\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nHi, this is Amber.

It pries the membrane open wide enough for us to come and go without any trouble. It'll also need to come attached to cranes so we can drop it into the pit in the quarry. \n\nSince SCP-6218-B is so big we probably won't provoke it. The only problem is that it'll need a crew because long-distance control isn't going to work. Something on SCP-6218-A is messing with the transmission. \n\nI put some memetic shields in the hull to protect against the hallucinations, but since you said it was the air, I don't think that will be a problem because it already had to be airtight. \n\nSo yeah she should take the better part of a month to build.

Each of them took part in a month-long training regimen preparing them for the mission. Their goal was to find a cell's nucleus[[footnote]]The nucleus is the core of the cell.

Right now.\n\n//End Log.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n[[div class=\"reportdate\"]]\n//Progress Report: Sept. 6 - 2:05//\n[[/div]]\n\n//Begin Log.//\n\n//Redundant information omitted.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** -and that's all I know, I swear!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** You thought it was a good idea to do this without telling anyone?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** I'm sorry, how was I supposed to know he'd go crazy like that?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** It was a bad idea from the outset! We don't know anything about him. He could have seriously hurt you!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Enough. This isn't gonna get us anywhere. We need to figure out what to do next.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Where is Jackson right now?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Last I saw him was in my room. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I'll watch him. You guys figure out the way back up. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** How much longer do we have?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** It's been 8 days. 6218-B's pulse could get here any minute. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I'll be in the cockpit, then. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Alright. Now what?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Let's go with Ivy. I've got some questions for Jackson.\n\n//End Log.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n[[div class=\"reportdate-2\"]]\n//Interview with SCP-6218-Autumn: Sept. 6 - 12:45//\n[[/div]]\n\n//Begin Log.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** -Come on. Is this really necessary?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Yeah. Yeah, it is. Alright, so here's how it's gonna go this time. You're going to tell us what the fuck that was in my room. \n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** You weren't supposed to see it. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** That ain't gonna cut it this time.\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** We can't tell you. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Fine. Tell us who the serpent is.\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** We’re everywhere, inside and out. We’ve been wrapped around this sphere for an eternity. And we will be long after your kind breathes its last.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** //This// sphere? So you're saying the universe is infinite after all?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** And you're keeping us in here like we're rats in a cage.\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Keeping you in? You think we're concerned about keeping you in? No, we're keeping //it// out. This sphere holds something sacred, something that's dying out. It isn't the same out there, if we let a single drop of it into the sphere, then all of this will have been for nothing. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** And what is this rare thing you're so worried about?\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Life! Life! Don't you see yourselves for what you are? You're so small, so naïve, so fleeting, lacking unity and lacking purpose, yet still brimming with indescribable feelings. You're a miracle, and you're trying to fuck it all up. Why? After everything we've done for you, why can't you just be happy with what you have?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** We have to know what's out there. It's our job. \n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Like hell it is! What's curiosity gotten you, Lee? Huh? A life chasing ghosts? Goddammit, you were happier when you didn't know! You were happier without purpose! Then you just had to get all nosy, and it cost Jackson his life!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** You don't know that.\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** I know everything about your life!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Shut up, Jackson!\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Jackson is //gone.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Lee, what's he talking about?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** Fine, if you're so certain, tell me what happened to Jackson. \n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** There are things that your kind will never comprehend!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** So you //do// know! What happened in 1984!?\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** I just told you we don't know a damn thing!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Eun-Choi:##** No! I know that look! Jackson! Look at me! //Look at me!//\n\n//Agent Eun-Choi rushes at SCP-6218-Autumn. His fellow agents attempt to intervene, but before any contact is made the Syringe lurches, knocking the crew to the floor. SCP-6218-Autumn laughs.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** What was that?!\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Did you do this?!\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** It's here! At last!\n\n//The Syringe lurches again, and agents Williard and Skye make for the cockpit. Eun-Choi stays behind. Skye grabs the tape recorder on her way out. SCP-6218-Autumn's cries grow quieter as she moves away from it.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** [indecipherable] –The blood! The blood!\n\n//The crew met up with agent Ignatia in the cockpit, as SCP-6218-B's pulse overtook the Syringe.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Amber! What's– [indecipherable]\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** The damn current– [indecipherable] –don't know how much– [indecipherable] –Mary, full of grace– [indecipherable]\n\n//The audio for the remainder of this tape is heavily distorted because of the tape recorder being jostled by the pulse's current. The remainder of the mission was recounted by the crew in the debriefing.//\n\n//End Log.//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n[[div class=\"reportdate\"]]\n//Post-Mission Debrief//\n[[/div]]\n\n//Begin Log.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I think the hardest part about the pulse reaching us was that we were so close to the surface. I'd just caught the first hint of daylight when the current started to hit us. Cytosol doesn't work like water, you know, it's more like molasses. But the current was as strong as any ocean shift.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** Still can't get over the dead fish. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Right, right. The current was taking those dead fish from the bottom of the cell and flinging them at the hull. Next thing I knew, the current was pulling us along with them. It made us slam into that scaffolding, I think it was called a cytoskeleton. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** Yeah, the whole cell was caving in around us. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** Not that you could tell, it was dark as always. I had no time to react to the rubble. It's a wonder the whole thing is still airtight after all that. That never really made sense to me, because we shouldn't have made it out of there. I shouldn't have even been able to pilot the Syringe against that fucking current. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Hm. That explains the state of the ship. Now, the monster that was chasing you. Tell us what you know about that.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I think that guy[[footnote]]SCP-6218-Autumn.[[/footnote]] called it the blood, because that's what it was. Blood. I didn't get the best look at it, to be honest. I was just focused on getting us out of there as fast as possible. Whatever it was, it called out to me. I had to fight the urge to turn back because I knew if I did we'd all get swallowed up by it. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** I think it was trying to say it was sorry. For what, I don't know. I couldn't think straight, you know how it is in the field.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I think it was more than that. I can't remember what it looked like at all. Every time I try my mind just wants to turn somewhere else. I start feeling cold for some reason. It must have done something to our heads.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** And where do you think it went?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** I don't- hang on, why //did// it stop chasing us? \n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I was sure it had us.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** It had us, you can still see the bite marks on the hull. \n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Bite marks? I didn't see any of those. I checked thoroughly. Could you be thinking of something else?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** No. It got us. Most of it was a blur, but I know that sound. That was teeth on metal.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** I don’t know what to tell you. The ship was ruined, but there was nothing like that. Do you think it’s connected to what happened to Lee? \n\n//Xi-5 doesn't respond.//\n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** I said, do you–\n\n**##c5c5c5|Skye:##** No, I heard you. It's just... Who's Lee? Was he with Eta-5?[[footnote]]MTF Eta-5 (Jäeger Bombers) is a task force specialized in combat against large-scale anomalies. They were present when the Syringe surfaced as a safety measure, though there was no sign of the monster Xi-5 had reported.[[/footnote]]\n\n**##c5c5c5|6218-Autumn:##** Lee Eun-Choi. The biologist we sent with you. The one who died.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Williard:##** No, there were only three of us. Four if you count Jackson.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** What?\n\n**##c5c5c5|Ignatia:##** I don't know anyone named Lee. Not at the Foundation, at least.\n\n**##c5c5c5|Kovalenko:##** Hold on, I need to review the–\n\n//Professor Kovalenko turns off the tape.//\n\n//End Log.//\n[[/div]]\n\nThrough further questioning, it became apparent that Xi-5's memories of agent Lee Eun-Choi, as well as the collective memories of anyone who knew him, had been erased. None of them had been amnesticized. The only evidence that Eun-Choi existed is the physical documentation of his work (tapes, emails, notes).\n\nThe O5 council met on September 11th to discuss what was to be done about SCP-6218-B. Instead of continuing research into SCP-6218, a plan was made which complied more closely with SCP-6218-B's demands. Provisional Site-6218 is still to be maintained, but knowledge of SCP-6218-B is restricted to clearance level 4. \n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6217]]] | SCP-6218 | [[[SCP-6219]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Header.png\n> **Author:** [[*user September55th]], me.\n> **License:** Public Domain in the United States.\n> **Additional Notes:** Photoshopped to look photocopied.\n> **Derivative of:** \n> \n> @@            @@**Name:** Victoria Crater, Cape Verde-Mars.jpg\n> @@            @@**Author:** NASA\n> @@            @@**License:** Public Domain in the United States, because it was created solely by NASA.\n> @@            @@**Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Victoria_Crater,_Cape_Verde-Mars.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> @@            @@**Additional Notes:** Cropped by the Wikimedia Commons.\n> \n> @@            @@**Name:** MOL spacesuit.jpg\n> @@            @@**Author:** Wright-Patterson Air Force Base\n> @@            @@**License:** Public Domain in the United States, because it was created by a member of the Air Force.\n> @@            @@**Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MOL_spacesuit.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> @@            @@**Additional Notes:** Almost invisible, but part of the header image.
