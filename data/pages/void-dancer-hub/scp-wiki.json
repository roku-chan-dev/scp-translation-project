Male. Portland-born. Former Jailors' accomplice as a memeticist with the Foundation Memetics and Infohazards Division. Operated with a speciality in analysing the emergence, proliferation, and impact of novel meme agents and memetic hazards, and in an advisory role as a Field Researcher with the Mobile Task Force Directorate. Displays archetypal irregularities consistent with “Mary Sue” typology (Unconfirmed).

Differs from baseline human physiology with a 24″-wide CRT television set in place of a head. Displays anomalous capacity to interface with and influence electronic devices via electrokinetic capabilities (Confirmed). First declared deceased after an internal containment breach at a Jailor stronghold, she is presumed missing.\n\nNow believed to inhabit **The Void**.\n----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nThey're welcome here, though they may not know it yet.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"narration indented\"]]\n+++ Glossary\n----\nSome of these I picked out — as it were — from your Jailors' toolkit. You may not like 'em, but they knew //exactly// what they were doing, and it's not good.\n\nIf there's more, don't hesitate to let me know. I'll keep this updated. All right?\n----\n* **narrativohazard:** A cascading hazard affecting elements of a narrative and its mode of transmission, often leading to their mutual destruction. Now, doesn't that sound inconvenient?\n\n* **pataphysical:** We don't use it much, but you know it when you see it. It'll piss you right off, but when the imagined monsters turn real, you'll be glad you knew better. Don't let me indulge you. And more importantly, don't indulge [[span class=\"THEY\"]]Them[[/span]].\n\n* **The Void:** A substrate of “nothingness” and the foundations of observable existence. Entities that enter this place may find that their experience gives it form; that it populates it; that their perception shapes reality; and that imagination equals power. **The Void** is inaccessible for entities within the Cosmos (meatspace, dreamspace, et al.). Access can only occur through use of incredibly powerful narrative-bending manipulations. Entities who attempt these manipulations do, of course, face a high probability of incurring narrativohazards, or retroactively ceasing to have ever existed across their past life. Transit into **The Void** is inherently one-way — unless you somehow know better than I.\n\n* [[span class=\"THEY\"]]Them[[/span]]**:** The gods of the old world. The architects of our persistent peril. Formerly known as “The Authors.” That was a lie then, and it's a lie now. Truth is, you can kill 'em. But only if you can find 'em. I'm sure they wouldn't put up too much of a fight, though.
