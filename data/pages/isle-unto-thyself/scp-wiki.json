They simply felt the Serpent's might -- its will, hellbent on banishing them from its Library -- relax its grip and let them go, ceasing their fall and allowing their souls to breathe. They could open their eyes, now -- but the second they did, they regretted their decision.\n\n[[[rat-s-nest-hub|All around them, the world was dying]]].\n\nThe void that surrounded them in every direction was great beyond reason, a terrible, dark place where no stars still lived. In the distance, Robert could see a few irreal pulsars breathing their final breaths, their lights almost a mockery of hope. Between them, in the empty space that was everything here, there sat many things, nonsensical things: leftovers of reason, the remnants scattered all across this parody of cosmos. A loose photo depicting a smiling woman; the hopes and dreams of a fleeting artist, their hard work unrequited by applause; a single loose sock, still dirty despite the concept having vanished millennia ago in this reality; the soul of a planet beyond redemption, its final cries of unfulfilled lives nothing but a silent echo in the universe.\n\nMadden blinked, and realized that what he was looking at was a rotting, cosmic corpse, seen from the perspective of a human maggot too small to comprehend it. All around them were the last remnants of what had once used to be a world, the tranquility of its alien nature making it almost incomprehensible. And in the middle of it they stood, half-levitating in a grotesque parody of no-gravity; still alive and capable of movement, but too far to reach any of the remnants of reality blinking in and out of existence around them, too far to do anything but lay down and observe the rot consume the universe whole.\n\nThey were stuck in a place without even the //concepts// of entry or exit still existing.\n\nRobert looked at Ann, then and Ra.

From regret at things left unsaid to remorse about conversations past, the people who sat before him weren't indifferent to the situation at hand. But it wasn't just sadness he could see in them. There was something almost akin to heartbreak, at the sudden and awful realization that this new era of Vanguard -- an era promised to be the beginning of a bright future -- wasn't just about great plans and big changes.

It was clear that without the Foundation -- or any other organization, for that matter -- still being around in this world, there was no force to contain the alchemical forces of reality with the Seal or a similar construct. For what little it was worth, Barlowe was free to bend the universe however she pleased here -- but there was almost no universe left to bend. The only thing in between those lost dreams and stranded hopes were a few lost particles, left wandering across endless space. Too little to amount to anything -- and far too little for Barlowe to use them in any way that mattered.\n\nShe could sense and touch them, just like in the two other Seal-less realities that they had visited, but she couldn't use them to construct even a simple flame.

They noticed them, but didn't act upon the realization -- they knew it would be of no use anyway.\n\nThey all had thought that words had little meaning, even back in their world, so here? Here, where such a thing as meaning didn't even exist anymore, words were little more than just tears lost in the rain, a whisper begging for relevance against an endlessly uncaring and cold void. Even the few last sparks of cohesion left in the whole world -- a few distant flickers of stars long-dead and a few items that had since lost even their own definitions -- they remained unmoved by Ann, Robert, and Ra's fate. No words -- not mortal, not that of gods -- could ever change that.\n\nSo instead of wasting breath (not that this world needed breath, anyway, having nothing else to do, the three gave in to their thoughts.\n\nRa remembered her birth.

'Birth' wasn't perhaps the best word.\n\nIn spite of her creation not being biological, just like any other artificial intelligence developed by the late Foundation, she had always remembered the moment she came to be. She could still recall that sudden hope, that sudden spark that made itself manifest in an otherwise uninhabited body made from wires and processors. //Snap//. And then, with just a flick of a button, there she was. Like a lost soul rescued from the terrible fate of nonexistence, she began to live in a flash of light -- light so great and overwhelmingly beautiful it would have made her weep tears of joy, had she been able to.\n\nLooking at the stars dying light-years away from her and her companions, she figured that she would cease in a cascade of light, too.\n\nRobert thought of his parents. He had never known them, not really. He didn't even have memories of them -- they had perished in a car crash before he had even formed the skill to remember at all. It was a terrible thing, he had always thought, some cosmic joke, a mock of probability -- it robbed him of a life he never really knew he wanted. But now, now that he was seconds away from facing the same fate as them -- he wondered what it could've looked like, if they just survived. Would he still join the Foundation? Would his [[[fresh-blood|anomalous nature]]] even develop at all, or was that just a by-product of chance, the universe somehow thinking that making him an avatar of anomalous probability would pay back for the fate it had woven for him, the moment it killed its parents?\n\nAnd, if they lived, would he still end up here?\n\nHe figured he would never know.\n\nAnn too didn't have any parents -- whoever they were, they had left her at the doorstep of a Russian alchemist before she was even able to speak -- but in her final moments, she didn't think of them. Instead, she remembered her cats -- a trio of orange alleys, a mischievous bunch of misfits she'd found during her first visit to Esterberg. They had always been just like her, she had always thought, both red-colored and unwanted by the world, both willing to make their own way through a universe that didn't care.

But she knew she had no time or energy for such nonsense if she wanted her gambit to succeed.\n\nSo instead, she got to work.\n\nGently, like a mother touching her newborn baby, Ann felt the particles of the world once more. That almost cosmic consciousness of matter, of the Aethers around her, came to her in an instant. Once again she saw that they were fragile and little, far too insignificant to actually amount to anything, even in the hands of an Artist as skilled as her. But now she knew that she didn't need them. In a world like this, where there was virtually no limit to her skills, no Seals to dampen her range down, no outside influences or structures that could disrupt the flow of energy through the universe, she could do so much more than anywhere else.\n\nWithin just a second, she realized that here, the universe was her canvas -- and she sure as hell held the brush.\n\nIt was in her fingers, in her hands, in her whole bloody body -- she could feel it all, now, everything about the world that entombed her. Her whole soul, her whole mind, her whole body; they all became little more than conduits for the universe around her, bringing every particle and energy that could have ever existed into her palms. No matter where they were, no matter how afar on the spectrums of range or immateriality -- Ann could touch them all now, tapping into that cosmic background that held an irreal soup of what once used to be a universe.\n\nWith a firm hand she grabbed that background and took it, then took some more, until she couldn't //just// feel it -- she //was// the universe, now. With no bounds to hold her down Ann was perfectly in tune with the cosmos around her, freely capable of picking and choosing whatever part of it she wanted to manipulate -- an island to herself, a single point of reason amongst a raging sea of chaos. But she only needed one part of it -- one very, very specific part of it. So she focused all her attention on finding her desired element, pushing all parts of her that were still Ann Barlowe in desperate pursuit of her final hope.\n\nAn infinitesimal moment later, she found it.\n\nBuried somewhere behind all of that cosmic junk, behind the leftovers of a universe that once was -- she found the final, barely-lingering sparks of this universe's SCP-6172 energies. Their own portal -- the one back home, the one that had brought them all into this nonsense in the first place -- was flawed, but it fulfilled one of its functions well: no matter where they landed, they couldn't possibly connect to a world that didn't //also// have its own version of the device. And even here, even at the edge of the multiverse and at the edge of reason -- even here, she could sense what had remained of this world's portal, a half-pathetic mix of energies left somewhere in this universal soup.\n\nSo she took it, molding it to her will.\n\nPutting all of her into the task she took the energy of the portal -- its alchemical essence, the very metaphysical being of what it was -- and shaped it until she recreated the hole in reality which the device had been created to form. She took the Aethers of other forces -- steel, power, electricity, and wind -- and put them into her construct, embuing it with alchemical stability so that it wouldn't just disappear the moment she let go. And indeed it didn't -- the way remained there, a leak in the otherwise impenetrable fabric of reality, allowing them all entry into the rest of the multiverse.\n\nWithout further hesitation, Ann made all three fall through the hole, throwing them into the impossibly vast nexus of what lay between realities until she could feel that part of the multiverse, too.\n\nWith a force she didn't know she was capable of wielding she bent the multiverse itself to her will, subjugating it to her own desires and likings, and in that moment she told it just a single thing, a single whisper into its otherwise cold and uncaring ear. She told her to take them home, redirecting the beam of non-energy that they had traversed into the reality that matched them, still bending the structures that upheld this Multiversal Compass with her very own hands.\n\nThe second she felt they were close, the second she sensed they were entering their own dimension, she flicked a finger, and closed the gateway behind them, once again making the world which they had just left a prison to itself.\n\nHaving no other choice but to listen, the jaws of the Rat snapped shut.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"pale3\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\nThe second the silence fell on his colleagues, Micheals cleared his throat. \"Thank you,\" he said, looking specifically at those who were gathered before him. \"Thank you for being here.

Still, that didn't change the fact that it was really quite tiring, having to explain in-depth the whole context of the Impasse and the Foundation-Vanguard transition and propose further collaboration programs to a bunch of interdimensional people who didn't even really comprehend the concept of containment in the first place.\n\nAnn chuckled. Ra made a sound similar to laughing, using the full extent of her android body (they let her keep it). \"Aye,\" Barlowe said, cracking her knuckles. \"I'd drink to that.\"\n\n\"I would avoid tempting fate like that, if I were you,\" a third voice suddenly said, entering their vision from the shadows. It belonged to a diminutive red-headed woman, glasses mounted atop her nose. Neither of them needed her to introduce herself to know that she was [[[scp-5616|Dr. Ilse Reynders]]], expert in all fields parascientific in this reality and tens of others. She took the now-empty seats the Empire representatives had sat in, and similarly crossed her legs.\n\nMadden nervously cleared his throat. \"M-Miss,\" he said, scratching his head. \"I'd like to apologize for not contacting you earlier, but--\"\n\nShe waved a hand and smiled. \"Don't bother apologizing. I'm not your Ilse anyway. What?\" she said, seeing their slightly widened eyes. \"You thought we don't talk to each other or work together? Please.\"\n\nNobody really knew how to reply to that.\n\n\"Right,\" Ilse said, eyeing the three. \"I figure you want to know what I want from you.\"\n\nThey nodded.\n\n\"I have just one thing to say:\" She gave them a look. \"Don't fucking do that again.\"\n\nAgain, nobody found an answer.\n\n\"What you did was very stupid. Jumping realities left and right is a recipe for multiversal disaster. There are very few things that destabilize it more, apocalyptic events obviously notwithstanding.\" She lit up a bit. \"But I suppose I cannot blame you. Your circumstances talk for themselves. All things considered, you did better than most. At least you didn't actually break anything permanently. It's a shame we now have to deal with [[[the-mind-electric|another Coalition that knows about interdimensional travel]]], though.\" She chuckled at her own joke.\n\n\"Still,\" she continued. \"Next time you go AWOL, just give me a call directly. God knows I didn't think this was an emergency of this scale when your Director reported it to all of us.\" She extended her hand, what looked like a business card bearing the sigil of a [[[welcome-to-delta-t|Foundation logo with a tau inside a triangle atop it]]]. \"It's far simpler than jumping dimensions. And far safer.\"\n\nMadden took it, studying the logo carefully. He didn't know whom it belonged to. He needed to do his research. \"Thank--\"\n\n\"Actually,\" Ann cut in. \"Forgive me interrupting what I'm sure was going to be a great monologue, but... what went wrong?\" Ilse tilted her head. \"I mean in the first place. They never did tell us what caused this whole fiasco. The malfunction, I mean. They said their results were inconclusive.\"\n\nIlse pondered the question for a moment. \"Truth be told, I don't know. It's not the answer you were expecting, I know, but even the infinite mes out there aren't really sure. We're working on it.\" She paused. \"But, generally speaking, incidents like this are almost always caused by one of four reasons: fate, curses, the multiverse balancing itself...\"\n\n\"...or?\" Ann asked.\n\nIlse looked away for a moment, as if giving someone who wasn't inside the room -- someone way up above them, both in pataphysical dimensional distance and power -- a very, //very// heavy look. \"...or to fulfill the goals of someone else entirely.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=true | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/let-the-maze-of-my-design-carry-you-on | previous-title=Let the Maze of My Design Carry You On\n| next-url= | next-title=\n| hub-url=/chronicles-of-the-irreal-hub | hub-title=Chronicles of the Irreal\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
