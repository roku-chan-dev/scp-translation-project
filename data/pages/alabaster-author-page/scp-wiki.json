Could've fooled me.\nThis SCP is a load of SHIT right now. I need to rewrite it someday and get a better picture unless the shoes are gone in which case FUCK. Watch this space.\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4141 SCP-4141] - \"You: The Real Time Autobiography\"\n\nInspired by a post from /v/ in the holiest of SCP threads from early 2018. Thanks, guy from /v/, it's a very good idea.\nSadly my writing for it is DRY AND GARBAGE and not deserving of the EPIC SOUGHT-AFTER REPEATING DIGITS SPOT. I need to fix it up. I use the word \"instance\" too much. Gotta make the ending better too. Watch this space too, because you're gonna have an existential crisis once this shit is done.\n\n[http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-3871 SCP-3871] - \"Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton\"\n\nClichecon was fun. I wrote about an angry robot.\nCritics raved for \"Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton.\" They loved \"Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton.\" \n> Wow, Dr. Wondertainment's Allegorical Anomaly-Annihilating Assault Automaton really is a good SCP!\nsaid some guy, probably.\nI heard some guy on a podcast call it good. It's the only SCP I've got up that I like as of right now. Don't watch this space cause this one is DONE. (probably? never say never.)[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"hey\" hide=\"you smell of poopoo peepee\"]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
