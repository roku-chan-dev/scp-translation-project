THE UNIT NEEDS A GRENADE LAUNCHER AND THE LAST ONE GOT EVAPORATED WITH STEVE! AS A MATTER OF FACT...\"\n\nMichael inhaled sharply through his nose, closed his eyes, and severed himself from material reality. He could still hear Rob hollering at him, feel the man's voice vibrating the glasses on his face. He was acutely aware that his ears hurt, but tried to ignore everything and let the man get it off his chest.\n\n\"AND ANOTHER THING, THAT'S THE LAST TIME YOU ASK IF WE REALLY NEED FULL CBRN FILTERS FOR THE MASKS. NO, ASSHOLE, A SIMPLE PARTICULATE FILTER WON'T DO! WE MEET REAL CHEMICAL THREATS OUT THERE!\"\n\n\"Robert-\"\n\n\"YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S LIKE! IF WE HAD PROPER GEAR-\"\n\n\"Robert, I can only pretend to buy so many water coolers and office plants before somebody starts to raise an eyebrow. On paper we have enough Begonias to fill the Empire Stat-\"\n\n\"NO, SHUT UP! I'M TIRED OF YOUR CRAP YOU TWEEDLY LITTLE PENCIL NECKED BITCH! MY MEN ARE DYING OUT THERE WHILE YOU'RE LAUGHING IT UP IN THIS AIR CONDITIONED FUCKING OFFICE PRATTLING ABOUT A FEW THOUSAND BUCKS! DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MUCH WE PAY OUT IN SURVIVORS BENEFITS?\"\n\n\"Survivors benefits are funded separately. It doesn't come out of our budget at all. We just tell their families they died going after the mob and nobody questions it. We have more spare lives than we do cash.\"\n\nThere was an overwhelmingly awkward moment of silence between the two, Michael glaring at the Weapons Unit officer from behind his clipboard with all the self assured correctness in the world. Surely Robert would finally come to understand that he'd been unreasonable all along and- Oh, nope, everything flashed white and his glasses were on the floor now. He'd just been punched in the face. The young financial analyst brought a hand up to his nose and took it away, first seeing then tasting the blood as it ran from his nose down into his mouth. In the meantime Robert had decided to scatter Michael's paperwork all over the office and was currently in the process of overturning the desk. Michael just stood there and watched, feeling indignant about being struck but realizing he was quite powerless to do anything about it short of going and getting security, which could blow their cover.\n\nA smashed lamp, athletic trophy, and several picture frames later Robert had regained enough of his senses to bring a big meaty finger up to Michael's face and start using his words again. \"They're people, not lines in an Excell [[footnote]] The Bureau would like to clarify that the aforementioned Excell spreadsheet software was first introduced on September 30 1985 for the Apple Macintosh computer. We have had several reports of people remembering differently before going on to commit seriously un-American activities. If you remember differently, please double check to ensure you have not found yourself in an alternative reality and that you are not under the influence of Communism or other memetic hazards. [[/footnote]] fucking spreadsheet.\"\n\nMicheal, of course, wanted to reply that they were both people AND lines in an Excell spreadsheet, and that ignoring the spreadsheet side of things would get the whole operation shut down. He got the impression that Robert might hit him again if he said that, so he thought for a moment before replying: \"I'll try to figure something out, but I can't turn water into wine. I'm not what's standing between you and proper gear- that's the Director of National Intelligence. You want to stroll into his office and smash all the picture frames then be my guest but it won't help us. Unless you start running into weapons caches in the field or stuff you can sell-\"\n\n\"What did you say?\"\n\n\"Weapons caches in the field?\"\n\n\"No- I mean yes, but the other thing.\"\n\n\"Stuff you can auction off to the public. You know, like confiscated vehicles or- Oh my god Robert, no! Don't even think about it!\"\n\n\"I've still got contacts at the CIA.\"\n\n\"Robert! That's not an acceptable way to fund things! Please be reasonable! There are rules!\"\n\nRobert had opted not to be reasonable. He turned on his heels and went straight to the UIU evidence locker. Michael knew what it meant and decided to just close the door, lock it, and start setting his paperwork in order. There was no point arguing anymore, it was just going to happen anyways.\n\nFor his part the massively bulked up former Green Beret was tapping the 'delete' key on a lot of entries in the evidence room computer. He then took all the files, put them in a Bureau issued burn bag, and poured a flask of whisky over them before lighting them up. He was grinning from ear to ear as he reached into the cabinets and pulled out brick after brick of pure white snowy powder, shoving them in a conveniently placed duffel bag as he dreamt of all the wonderful weapons he'd buy with his drug money- That's when something caught his eye in the corner of the room. Wrapped in plastic to preserve DNA evidence and finger prints and leaned against the corner was a Soviet RPG-7. \n\nMichael grabbed the RPG, slung it over his shoulder, and reached into his pocket for the key to unlock the ammo cabinet. Bingo! Couple rockets in there. He shoved them into the bag with the cocaine, made sure to delete these entries too, and snatched their paper evidence forms out of the filing cabinet. He'd burn those later. For now, he was headed for the parking garage. When he got there he picked up his car phone. \"Hey Ollie, it's me. Listen, I'm in a bind here. My boys don't have proper gear and the bean counters won't pay for it. I've got some stuff to sell. You still doing that kinda' work with the Contras?\"\n\nMichael had waited for things to calm down before going into the evidence locker. He coughed and waved the smoke away from his face, glaring at the burn bag before checking the computer. He went into the trash folder and there was a perfect log of everything Robert had taken. Michael sighed with overwhelming relief, wrote all of it down, and then emptied the trash folder before returning to his office, sitting down, and grabbing fistfulls of his hair to pull on as he racked his brain for how he was going to explain the sudden influx of funds and equipment. If new shit just started showing up in the armory tagged UIU, someone would EVENTUALLY get jealous and start demanding a budget hike. If a shitty backwater unit like theirs got such fancy toys then why couldn't the big boys in the HRT? Fuck, fuck... How was he going to make this work? Unless...\n\n+ October 8th, 1985\n**J. Edgar Hoover Building\nThe parking lot**\n\n\"Robert, we need to talk.\"\n\n\"About?\"\n\n\"It's about the stuff you took from the evidence locker.\"\n\n\"Woaaaah! Hey now, you don't have any evidence of that.\"\n\n\"As a matter of fact I do, but that's not why I wanted to talk to you.\"\n\n\"You WHAT!?\"\n\n\"That's not important-\"\n\n\"WHEN DID WE GET A FUCKING CAMERA IN THE EVIDENCE LOCKER? YOU SAID THERE WASN'T ONE WHEN I ASKED. RECORDING SOMEBODY WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT IS A SERIOUS FELONY AND TAINTS THE EVIDENCE. IF YOU RAT ME OUT I'LL GET OFF AND FUCK YOU UP!\"\n\nMichael wanted to die. He hated everything so much right now. Hated Robert, hated this job, and most of all hated what he was about to do. \"There's not a camera in the evidence locker, and I'm not going to rat you out.\" Before Robert could ask what kind of evidence he had, Michael pressed on: \"I was thinking we should store the gear and cash at my place.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nMichael explained their predicament and Robert was, for the first time he could remember, smiling while they talked. \"Well I'll be damned, the gutless dork finally grew a spine! You'd really stick your neck out for my boys like that?\"\n\n\"Not if I had a choice.\" the accountant seethed, \"I don't see any other option that even has a slim chance of success. Maybe after a few years we can save up enough to buy a warehouse and register it under an LLC with a scapegoat as the figurehead if things go south.\"\n\n\"Mike, I like the way you think! Seems like maybe you understand the importance of what we do after all!\" The big Green Beret clapped him on the shoulder, a gesture that made the slender young man feel better than he expected. It was the first time they'd ever come close to getting along. \"I- Yes...\" he answered, pushing his glasses up his face and suddenly feeling just a tad overwhelmed with emotions. Talking to Rob was like riding a rollercoaster. One moment you're afraid you're about to get punched in the face, the next he's clapping you on the shoulder like your best friend. Such a chaotic bully. \"That's why I can't let it get shut down over something stupid like financial irregularities.\"\n\nRobert was positively beaming at him. From this close Michael could smell the faintest hint of alcohol on his breath. \"Well, maybe I go too hard on you sometimes, but it's because I care about my boys! You'd be the same if you knew them like I did!\" it was then that Michael noticed something new. Were Robert's eyes red? Was he... was he... USING? Mike gasped- \"Oh god, Robert!\"\n\n\"Yeah Mike?\"\n\nThe accountant flushed visibly red with anxiety. \"N-Nothing, I was just... I was thinking what would happen if we got caught.\" \n\nRobert wondered if Mike was into him or something. He decided he didn't care so long as he got what he needed out of this. \"Don't worry about it Mike, I'll protect you. I've got connections, remember? My buddy Oliver? Turns out he's on the National Security Council now. If we get busted he'll make it all go away.\" \n\nMichael sighed, \"If you say so...\"\n\nNotice: A legal disclaimer is attached to this surveillance record.
