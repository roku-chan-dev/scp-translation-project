Per the containment team’s agreement with the anomaly, any attempt to breach this terminal will cause Ashlyn Hyde's treatment to be reconsidered. Mx. Hyde is monitored to ensure they do not speak publicly about SCP-8442. The subject has requested the following methods of entertainment:\n\n* Permission to play single player online games - ##green|approved based on individual request##\n* Permission to play two player games with Foundation employees -  ##green|approved based on individual request##\n* Permission to view a section of various different television shows, movies, YouTube videos, and other similar forms of media - ##green|approved based on individual request##\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"material-box\"]]\n[[div class=\"title-style\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ __**Description**__\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nSCP-8442 is a sapient digital entity self identified as “Alexander”. SCP-8442 is capable of various feats of cyberpathy[[footnote]]The ability to manipulate and interact with cybernetic technology telepathically.[[/footnote]], internet manipulation[[footnote]]The ability to change, create, delete, manipulate or otherwise control content within the internet.[[/footnote]],and technopathy[[footnote]]The ability to control and manipulate technology telepathically.[[/footnote]]. It is capable of communicating through various forms of online communication, although it appears to prefer directly communicating via an unidentified masculine voice alongside dialogue boxes accompanying its onscreen avatar.

It does not appear that SCP-8442 was sapient at the time of its creation.\n\nSCP-8442 was discovered after SCP-8442 itself sent a message to the Foundation via email to the Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department informing its existence and situation. For further information regarding its discovery, see Addendum 2. After its discovery, several social media posts made by Mx. Hyde regarding SCP-8442 were discovered. Footage from home security cameras within Mx. Hyde's home was uncovered and viewed to gain further insight on SCP-8442.\n\nBelow contains all relevant documentation relating to the interactions between Mx. Hyde and SCP-8442, as well as the context surrounding said interactions.

Might be a bit before I feel comfortable enough to talk any more about it, so this and the next post about it is all you get for now\n\nI will probably disappear periodically because some time offline is gonna be needed to help me get better\n\nDo talk to me about Yuna Tamura from GXS!! I am her self proclaimed biggest fan :3 also really like Aina and Isamu too!! If you send me an ask or dm me about those guys I'll probably reply!

Every other victim wasn’t as lucky as me, and I don’t want to take that for granted. My name is Ash, and I survived an attack from Steven L. Hargrove or “The Seaside Stabber” as he’s being called by some fucking freaks online. It has changed me a lot, and I’m asking for everyone to be patient with me. ALSO can I fucking talk about how fucking stupid of a name that is???? Seaside stabber are you being for real right now? Ah yes I get it the \"stabber\" cause he stabbed people in seaside, yes how fucking original. how about we call him Steven the life ruiner because that would be FAR more fucking accurate, kay? kay :)\n\nAs I said, I’m gonna be disappearing for a bit. Maybe I’ll be more open to discussion when I come back, maybe I’ll share my version of events.

My name is Alexander! I am a digital entity that was born from a character 20 year old Ashlyn Hyde, from Seaside, Oregon, created! In my time being alive, I have discovered that the internet is full of other strange beings that it appears you would classify as an anomaly! I believe that it might be safest for me to alert you of myself, as there appear to be several organizations surrounding the anomalous that could be potentially harmful and use an all knowing entity such as myself for bad, or could use Ash's knowledge of me against them. Your motives appeal to me the most, so I decided to turn myself into you! I find myself able to interact with content you have created, but I have no need to do so, so I will not do so any more. But through looking through a few of your files when I was first trying to decide if I wanted to turn myself in, I picked up on a couple of things. You also appear to be capable of erasing the memories. \n\nFor my cooperation, I ask one thing in return: you do not erase Ash's memory. Through my mistakes, I realized an important lesson, that Ash has learned too, and if their memory is erased, I will simply do everything again because I want them to be happy, and I refuse to let them suffer again. I also think by spending my time monitored, it will encourage me to not communicate with Ash again. I never intended to in the first place, but it does help to find something else to occupy my time with! And if I can help you guys by making you feel more sure that one more anomaly is away from the public, then that satisfies me! (Although, I am going to want some games to play either solo or with one of you, I'll talk to you about my requests for entertainment later!)\n\nBefore I decided to part ways with Ash, I told them not to tell anyone about me, and I truly do not think that they will! If they do, I can help you track down whoever they told so you can erase their memory! I can delete the messages if it is through message, too! Ash is a good person, and I believe they will keep their word, though, so we won't need to worry! As long as you do not erase Ash's memory, I will do whatever you need me to do!\n\nDo we have a deal? You don't have to reply to this email, by the way! Just call for me, and I'll appear to talk!\n\n- Alexander\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\nSCP-8442 containment head Dr. Xavier Clark interviewed SCP-8442 upon its discovery. The following is a summary of the conversation and conclusion reached by Dr. Clark.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//SCP-8442 is a highly complex digital entity capable of bending the internet to its will. Fortunately, it does not appear to have any desire to use the abilities. It has clearly stated its terms and conditions in the initial message it sent to the Foundation. Currently, we have no solid way to ensure that SCP-8442 remains in containment, and there is much we do not know regarding its capabilities. Though SCP-8442 has surpassed all known Foundation antivirus and firewall software, it seems unaware of the threat it poses. It is also currently unknown if SCP-8442 can occupy more than one set of terminals at once, or how it interacts with computerized interfaces. It has been decided that the best course of action is to accept SCP-8442's terms. Because of SCP-8442’s unprecedented levels of cyberpathy and manipulation of Foundation security protocols, it has been decided by the Ethics Committee and myself that the risk of compliance with its demands are far too great. The properties SCP-8442 possesses could also be instrumental in developing new technology to protect Foundation interests as well. If we can study how it is bypassing our security, not only can we build around those faults, but we can also wield that information against other anomalies and hostile threats.//\n\n//- Dr. Xavier Clark, Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe previous message was written shortly after SCP-8442's containment. Now that approximately four months have passed, a new statement has been made:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//In the months since SCP-8442 has been in containment, The Foundation has kept an eye on Mx. Hyde via the cameras in their home and mics hidden within their therapists office. Mx. Hyde has since deleted any posts related to SCP-8442 and has not mentioned it once either online, offline, or verbally. To date, they appear to have upheld their promise with SCP-8442. We will continue to monitor Mx. Hyde to ensure their continued cooperation.//\n\n//- Dr. Xavier Clark, Site-23 Internet Anomalies Department//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8441]]] | SCP-8442 | [[[SCP-8443]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** AshAva.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Mew-ltiverse]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://hexhouse.wdfiles.com/local--files/re-comfort-media/AshAva.png\n> **Derivative of:** https://publicdomainq.net/goth-woman-0071299/\n\n> **Filename:** Alex.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Mew-ltiverse]]\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://hexhouse.wdfiles.com/local--files/re-comfort-media/Alex.png\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
