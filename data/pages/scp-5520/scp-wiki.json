Correspondence with SCP-5520 has revealed serious and progressive cognitive impairment, dissociation, depersonalization, derealization, and both retrograde and anterograde amnesia. It remains aligned with the goals of the Foundation, but no longer answers directly to the executive structure.\n\nSCP-5520 presently resides in a series of vast caverns and refineries located beneath Site-43, classified Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-W by former Site Director Dr. V. Lesley Scout. Though the facilities themselves exhibit no anomalous properties, their scale, their location, and the [http://www.scpwiki.com/the-b-b-decommission activities performed there] do. Both manual and automatic cave surveying techniques have been unable to determine the precise extent of AAF-W, but best estimates suggest over two million cubic metres of interior space. A breathable oxygen atmosphere pervades throughout, presumably as a result of SCP-5520's activities.\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Rydderech.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. Wynn Rydderech, c. 1943.|\n    width=250px |\n    align=left |\n]]\n[[div]]\n**Addendum 5520-1, Phenomenological Overview:** From 1915 to 1966 Dr. Wynn Rhys Rydderech headed the SCP Foundation's effort to manage the toxic materials generated by its catalogue of anomalous objects. His Acroamatic Abatement Group moved from Vienna, Austria to Provisional Site-43 in Canada in 1943, and he [http://www.scpwiki.com/the-good-work became Co-Director] with Dr. Vivian Lesley Scout. The Applied Occultism and Acroamatic Abatement Sections of that Site became, under his direction, the foremost facilities for studying and neutralizing esoteric effluence on Earth. When Site-43 was upgraded from provisional status in 1965, Dr. Scout became the Site Director with his partner's sponsorship.\n\nDr. Rydderech disappeared from Site-43 on the 14th of November, 1966, after fifty-one years of employment. Security and Containment Section agents searched his dedicated research laboratory in Acroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-A, and found it significantly altered and its forty-three staff members absent. Dr. Rydderech's notes revealed dozens of conflicting, frequently incoherent or unintelligible programs of research, suggesting that his disappearance had been voluntary. The entire Site was immediately placed on alert.\n\nDr. Scout ordered the Pursuit and Suppression Section to investigate the facility further.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Investigation Log Transcript**\n\n**Date:** 11/14/1966\n\n**Investigation Team:** Mobile Task Force Delta-43 (\"Pit Bosses\")\n\n**Team Lead:** Captain Garth Kinsey (Delta-1)\n\n**Team Members:** Delta-2, -5, -6, -7, -9\n\n-----\n\n//Log begins.//\n\n**Control:** Describe your surroundings, please.\n\n**Delta-1:** Roger.

Lesley Scout attempted to enact SUNDOWN protocol and decommission SCP-5520. Safeguards installed under O5 instructions prevented this act, and Dr. Scout was summoned to Site-01 for immediate questioning. A partial transcript of his interview with O5-8 is appended below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**[02/09/1996]**\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Scout.jpg|\n    caption=Dr. V. Lesley Scout, 1996.|\n    width=250px |\n    align=left |\n]]\n\n**O5-8:** Please, help me to understand why you did what you did.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** He gave his life to us, all of it, from start to finish. To the good work. I owed him this... courtesy.\n\n**O5-8:** What you call a courtesy, I might call an execution. His life is //not// finished.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** With respect, sir, you mean //you// aren't finished //with// his life. We're not talking about someone's abandoned grandfather, who just needs his loved ones to visit and brighten his day. We're not talking about someone with cognitive impairment who just needs patience and affection and rewarding work to live a meaningful life. Not anymore.\n\nWe're talking about someone who's been //completely alone// and //out of his mind// for //thirty years.// Most of Wynn Rydderech is gone, and what's left is crying out for help, and we're not listening.\n\nI've asked you, time and time again, to let me bring him back up here. To let me see if we can help him. He might never be the same, but at least he wouldn't be alone. He could live a real, human life, in the light. He would still be brilliant, he would still be //Wynn,// if we could manage his condition. But you refuse me, time and time again, and I've come to realize that you're never going to let him get better. You're going to keep him sick in the dark for all eternity if you can, so you can benefit from his sickness.\n\nWe are perpetuating a falsehood, through anomalous means, because it is convenient for us. That's not the Foundation I, or he, signed up to work for. Or //built,// if you please.\n\n**O5-8:** You're one to talk about anomalous perpetuation. How old are you now, Mr. Baggins? Eleventy-one, isn't it?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** I'm still myself. Wynn is not, by his own metrics. He left specific instructions for me on the matter, and his wishes are the only ones that should count. It's his life, and he put it in my hands. He //trusted// me. As his friend, and as his partner.\n\n**O5-8:** I have access to the INFOnet feed. I've seen what Rydderech is saying. Just last week he asked you to \"look in on Ashley.\" That doesn't sound like someone who's dissociating to //me.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Do you know who Ashley is, sir?\n\n**O5-8:** No, and I don't see why it matters. Is it his daughter? His cat?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** His brother, sir. His //dead// brother, hit by a bus during the London Blackout of 1918.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** He's suffering. And we're letting him suffer, keeping him //apart,// because he's useful to us. You know what he wants. If you've seen the feed, you've seen him begging for it. But you don't care. This isn't about him, it's about you.\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** You want to hear what Wynn, //actually// Wynn, thought about this?\n\n//Dr. Scout pulls a folded, yellow sheaf of papers from his suit.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Let me read this to you.\n\n**O5-8:** What is it?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** It's a letter he wrote. He asked that I open it if he ever became... compromised. He gave it to me the last time we went topside together, the day the Site became official. The first day of April, 1965.\n\nI opened it thirty years ago.\n\n**O5-8:** Fine. What does it say?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** It says,\n\n\"Vivian,\n\nI'm so pleased I got to see the lake one last time, and share that moment with you. As myself. Before...\"\n\n//Dr. Scout pauses.//\n\n**Dr. Scout:** \"...before what's going to happen to me. I know this is going to be difficult for you to understand, but I have to go away. I'm a danger to you, to the Site, maybe even to myself. I've tried to hide it, I've tried to control it, but I'm losing my grip. It's better for everyone if I disappear for a while.\n\nHopefully, I'll be back.\n\nBut if I'm not, I need to you understand something for me. I need you to understand who, and what, I am. So that you'll also understand if it's not me you're seeing, or hearing, down there in the dark. So that you'll do what needs to be done, as you always have. As we used to do, together.\n\nYou remember what we used to say at Cardiff? I know you've moved on to [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5382 magic words] and musty, dead old things, but I'm sure you haven't forgotten. There's magic in these words, too: \"We are chemistry, and electricity.\"\n\nThat, and nothing besides. You and I are the sum of our electro-chemical reactions. Electricity is the fire that is our conscious selves, and chemistry is the beating of our hearts.\n\nThe wet, sparking computers in our heads are the most powerful thinking, feeling machines in existence, more complicated than anything we can devise. More points of failure than any bridge, any airplane, any equation. They always break down, in the end, and so do we. That ephemerality is part of the magic. The fire goes out, the heart stops beating.\n\nSometimes the fire goes out first, and we lose ourselves. We become //not// ourselves. Every human being has the right to decide where that line is drawn for themselves, personally. You know full well where I draw it.\n\nWords have power, Vivian, but chemistry //is// power. If you change the chemistry, you change who you are.\n\nAnd it doesn't take much.\n\nYours very truly,\n\n- Wynn.\"\n\n//Silence on recording.//\n\n**O5-8:** Is that all, Dr. Scout?\n\n**Dr. Scout:** Yes, sir.\n\n**O5-8:** We'll take it under advisement.\n\n**Dr. Scout:** ...thank you, sir.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nI&T continued to correspond regularly with SCP-5520 under O5 direction, and Dr. Scout resigned from the SCP Foundation on 1 April 1996.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#E2F4FF; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;margin-bottom: 16px;\"]]\nColleagues,\n\nPer your offer of employment dated 1 April 1915, I must respectfully, retroactively, decline.

If you continue to profit from the madness of our friend, you will soon find it impossible to hide him. The truth will out.\n\nI should like to see the lake again.\n[[>]]\n-- V.
