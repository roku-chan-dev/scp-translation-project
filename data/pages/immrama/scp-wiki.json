[[/span]]**__\n\n//Immrama//, coming from the Old Irish word for a hero's adventures to the Otherworld, is a series concerning the Foundation's activities within Britain and Ireland. Whilst some pieces merely bring up various little anomalies found in British and Irish culture and folklore, the series primarily focuses on the Foundation's investigations into an ancient conflict which started in Iron Age Britain, and later, their attempts to maintain order and peace when that conflict starts again.\n\nAll stories and articles focus heavily on folklore, history and the everyday stiff-upper-lip, just-get-on-with-it attitude the British Isles branches of the Foundation practice in the face of anomalous fuss and nonsense. It resides separate from any other series or canon on the web, though there are some familiar elements dotted here and there, primarily from the [[[war-on-all-fronts-hub|War On All Fronts ]]] canon. Currently, it is a closed series, written by myself, [[*user arthcymro]], though I might open it in the future, once further stories and characters have been developed and written.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ **__Characters__**\n[[/=]]\n* **Dr. Zachary T. Dafydd** - A Foundation psychoanalyst who holds a grudge against the Aos sí. Before joining the Foundation, he was a member of a rebellious part of the Serpent's Hand but switched allegiances following a ritual gone wrong. A capable psionic, Zachary is able to perform telepathic connection through dreams as well as speak ###6A5EFF|**Indigo**##. [[span class=\"dblock\"]] Secretly a failed SCP-6796 instance, making him an artificial human-sidhe hybrid, and resulting in his body possessing hare-like traits, which he hides with glamours. [[/span]]\n* **Dr. Arthur Leonerd** - A Foundation folklorist and anthropologist and one of the Department Of Mythology And Folkloristics leading researchers. Through known to babble and be a bit clumsy, his scope in small tales and histories make him one Project Caliburn's leading researchers.\n* **Res. F. Ozz (\"Ozzy\")** - The Crypto/Xenobiological Research and Management of Site-44 Archives, F. Ozz isn't afraid to get his hands dirty and muck around in for the sake of answers. Having surrounded himself with animals since his youth, Ozzy is able to handle creatures people wouldn't think would exist.\n* **Arawn ap Carnonos** - The ruler of Annwn and remaining leader of the Mabyn. Imprisoned by the Aos sí leader, Gwynn, following the Mabyn's war with the Tuatha, he was freed during the Sixth Occult War and has sought the annihilation of the Aos sí ever since. A medium, Arawn is capable of controlling spectral entities and phenomena, contributing to his title as the god of the dead in Celtic mythology.\n* **Arthur Pendragon** - Once the ruler of the kingdom of Celliwig, Arthur helped stop the Aos sí's first conquest by weakening their leader, Gwynn. Somehow, he returned in the 1860s, once again helping Force ξ and The New Ferrous Brotherhood defeat another group of Aos sí.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __**Groups**__\n[[/=]]\n* **Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal** - One of the thirteen Foundation pre-cursor groups, that formed the organisation following the Sixth Occult War. Based in the United Kingdom, the group focused on studying and containing anomalies across the British Empire.\n * **Force ξ** - A HMFSCP trained task force, specialising in targeting thaumaturgical and psionic anomalies. During the Sixth Occult War, after learning of what happened during the Iron Age, they defected from HMFSCP and allied themselves with Arawn, intending to annihilate the Aos Sí.\n* **Church of the Broken God** - A widespread religious cult, whose varying beliefs all share the common ideology of technological advancement and humanity's progress and integration with technology. The majority of the branches worship or follow a god, known as Mekhane, with some branches also dedicated to resurrecting said god.\n * **Followers of Mekhane** - An early branch of the Church, which originated in Mycenaean Greece during the Bronze Age. Helping establish the Mekhanite Empire, the religion diminished in numbers centuries later after several wars and economic collapse. However, small sects of the religion survived well into the 5th century, though their ideologies and views changed as time went on.\n * **The New Ferrous Brotherhood** - A supposedly defunct branch of the Church, which was founded during Britain's industrial revolution. Unlike the more prominent sects, the Brotherhood believe in personal improvement and mechanical invention over worship. During the Sixth Occult War, the group became allies with Force ξ in their efforts to destroy the Aos Sí.\n* **Tuatha Dé Danann** - A sub-species of humans who evolved in the Bronze Age. Possessing mystical enhancements such as enhanced vocalizations, probability sinking, and shapeshifting, the species used to inhabit Ireland, before numerous invasions and cultural clashes forced them to retreat to Hy-Brasil. Following the attack by the Behemoth [[[lte-0851-cetus|LSA-Brasil-01]]], the majority emigrated to the Free Ports.\n* **The Mabyn** - A Brythonic-Picts government made up of eight human clans, who ruled most of Britain during the late-Iron Age. Capable metallurgists, farmers and mages, the Mabyn entered a war with the Tuatha before being eradicated by the Aos sí, with the later Roman, Saxon and Norman invasions eradicating any remnants of their history and work.\n* **Aos sí** - Human's sister species, known as the fairies or the fair folk, the Aos sí are a mysterious and dangerous race, possessing great skill in magic and warfare. The majority bow to Gwynn, a misanthropic and powerful Aos sí leader, who wishes to eradicate humanity, believing them to be blasphemous and unworthy of the world.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=ArthCymro]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
