  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**Operation:** Berberoka\n\n**Log Number:** 09052020/5142\n\n**Risk Classification:** Kamatayan\n\n**Foreword:** Berberoka is the designated codename for the operation initiated against the Valravn Corporation after it illegally operated within the Philippine territory and committed several acts of human rights violations. Valravn operated under the employment of Zenith, a multi-national industrial conglomerate, after the latter purchased land in Mindanao for mineral cultivation projects. This violated several provisions of the 1987 Philippine Constitution due to the fact that Zenith Group is owned by foreigners, as well as their deliberate exploitation of the archipelago's natural resources without proper permission from Local Government Units and the Republic of the Philippines, and thus viewed as an attack to the national interest of the country that necessitated AFP intervention.\n\nThe operation took place in Tawi-Tawi, Mindanao where Zenith Group purchased land from one Mr. Abdul Karim for an undisclosed sum of money. The land in question was located in the municipality of Masantong, near a populated settlement. For some reason, Zenith Group hired foreign and local Private Armed Groups, specifically the al-Asrif Group [[footnote]] Former anti-communist vigilante group turned guns-for-hire. [[/footnote]], and deployed them to the settlement in an attempt to displace the residents. The residents fought back and managed to repel the attackers before the PAGs struck for the second time.\n\nThe residents were successfully displaced and scattered across Masantong by the PAGs. In desperation, they enlisted the help of an anomalous armed communist group related to The Serpent's Hand, //Ang Sinumpa//[[footnote]] The Cursed [[/footnote]], and launched an all out attack against the contested settlement where the combined forces of the residents and the //Sinumpa// operatives managed to retake the area. Due to the confirmed presence of the anomalous armed group, Zenith Group then hired the Valravn Corporation, an Anomalous Private Military Company, to counter the attack of the residents and the //Sinumpa// operatives.\n\nThe resulting catastrophe led to the deaths of the residents and //Sinumpa// operatives. The surviving //Sinumpa// elements retreated to several of their hideouts across Tawi-Tawi but were pursued by Valravn assets, presumably to neutralize them.\n\nThe Anomalous Warfare Battalion was scrambled for deployment after the skirmishes between the two anomalous groups threatened to pierce the Veil of normalcy and to halt the increasing amount of civilian casualties.\n\n**Follow-Up Actions Taken:** \n\nThe 817VLTR-1D \"Vulture\" model is a surveillance drone upgraded from the S17-8F Foundation Drone model that the SCP Foundation donated to us. It was previously a battery-operated drone modified to be gas-fuelled that operates on 500 liters worth of diesel. Its capability was further expanded with the addition of combat features, as well as storage and logistic functions which enabled the drone to provide support fire missions and deliver emergency supplies to troops on the battlefield. It has a memory storage of up to 20GB and can record videos with 720p resolution that the on-board computer automatically transmits directly to Main Command.\n\nIn addition, the drones in our inventory were blessed by Sanctioned Katalonan Priestesses who disguised them as birds when viewed by unaided eyes.\n\nThere were at least fifty of these drones deployed in Philippine airspace, twenty of which were permanently stationed above Mindanao. As the engagements between the two groups raged across Tawi-Tawi, the drones were used to gauge the battlefield capabilities of the Valravn Corporation.\n\nMarine Companies Alpha, Tango and Victor were prepared for the commencement of the operation.\n\n**Log:** \n\nThe following log was from a transcribed video of the initial engagement between the Valravn Corporation and //Sinumpa// operatives captured by Drone 7A-8:\n\n> **Date:** 25 AUG 2020\n> **Remarks:** N/A\n> **Belligerents:** Valravn Corporation and 3rd Armed Cell of the //Sinumpa//\n> \n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> 00.00.00 - Aerial shot of Baranggay Kamagong, an urbanized rural village consisting of a large public market, a mosque, concrete office buildings, and a few elementary and high schools.

The skies were visibly cloudy due to the recent passing of a typhoon.\n> \n> 00.00.20 - //Sinumpa// operatives entered the Baranggay and prompted unarmed civilians in their immediate vicinity to scatter and flee. The //Sinumpa// operatives hastily proceeded deeper into the Baranggay where they were halted by armed police officers, whom they fired upon.\n> \n> 00.00.45 - Behind them, armed men in unidentified tactical battle armors[[footnote]] Confirmed to be Valravn troops.

The two sides engaged in a firefight for a few seconds.\n> \n> 00.01.25 - The firefight ended as //Sinumpa// operatives disengaged from the skirmish and retreated to the plaza, where they met up with more //Sinumpa// operatives. One of them initiated a thaumaturgic ritual that resulted in the soil beneath the Valravn ground forces erupting with large wooden stakes that impaled several of them.\n> \n> 00.01.45 - Valravn forces suffered a number of casualties, resulting with their request for reinforcements in the form of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-chiron-model|Chiron Models]]] and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/aar-1320-chacaltaya|Valkyrie Units]]].\n> \n> 00.02.00 - Some of the //Sinumpa// operatives waved esoteric items [[footnote]] Some of these items were a handkerchief with occult symbols, a pendant that contained an embryo of a duck and a cane fashioned after a human body.

They launched streaks of flames, geysers of water and tiny pebbles from their hands at the Valravn ground forces.\n> \n> 00.20.45 - Chiron Models armed with occult weaponry neutralized the elementals, which also killed several //Sinumpa// operatives in the process due to the destructive nature of the weapons. Remaining //Sinumpa// operatives were forced to flee the area.\n> \n> 00.02.30 - //Sinumpa// operatives were outflanked by the Chiron Models, forcing them to find another path but Valkyrie Units reached them and neutralized the //Sinumpa// operatives.\n> \n> [END LOG]\n\nSeveral engagements such as these were captured in video by the drones with no apparent change on Valravn's assets deployment.

At the farther back of the backyard, three small warehouses were seen, lit by dots of orange lights, presumably gaslight candles and burning cigarette sticks. Thermal enhancement imaging of the video revealed at least fifty operatives inside the walled-in compound.\n> \n> 00.00.13 - Squad Echo-1 of Victor Company proceeded towards the main entrance of the hardware store, accompanied by Squads Echo-2 and Echo-3. Squad Echo-4 remained on standby outside, on watch against potential interlopers and to act as the cut-off squad.\n> \n> 00.00.45 - Squad Echo-1 breached the entrance of the building and infiltrated the structure alongside Echo-2 and Echo-3. Thermal enhancement imaging revealed a brief firefight within the structure, resulting with the neutralization of the //Sinumpa// sentries posted in the building. The Marines also suffered a minor casualty, who was immediately evacuated.\n> \n> 00.01.02 - Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 proceeded to move towards the back entrance of the compound that will lead directly to the warehouses. At this point, //Sinumpa// elements within the warehouses were alerted to the firefight inside the building and began to establish a defensive perimeter around the three smaller buildings.\n> \n> 00.01.35 - A firefight broke out between the Marines inside the hardware store and the //Sinumpa// operatives near the warehouses, the attention on the back entrance averted. Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 successfully infiltrated the back entrance amidst the commotion and proceeded towards the middle warehouse through its backdoor.\n> \n> 00.02.02 - The firefight was in favor of the Marines as the //Sinumpa// suffered several casualties. Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6 exfiltrated from the middle warehouse with a restrained man whose head was covered with a sack.\n> \n> 00.02.40 - Squads Echo-5 and Echo-6, along with the man, boarded inside an unmarked military truck. Squads Echo-7, Echo-8 and Echo-9 infiltrated the back entrance of the compound and completely surrounded the //Sinumpa// operatives.\n> \n> 00.03.00 - The firefight ended with only fourteen //Sinumpa// operatives surviving.

I was gonna tell you everything, alright?! //[Sighs]// What do you want to know?\n> \n> **L:** Anything useful. So far, we know that the Valravn is an Anomalous Private Military Corporation, but what kind of anomalous weaponry they are employing still remains a mystery.

We used specialized bullets against them but our stockpiles were destroyed by the Valravn bastards when they raided our armory hideout.\n> \n> **L:** We have that covered. What about the Valkyries?\n> \n> **A:** Those motherfuckers are the worse kind that the Valravn threw at us so far.

They are finalizing their creation of the anomalous lifeforms.\n> \n> 00.00.12 - Chiron Models led the attacking party as scouts. The Marines inside the treehouses did not open fire. The Chiron Models then returned to the main Valravn forces before they proceeded deeper into the island.\n> \n> 00.01.30 - A firefight broke out. The Marines inside the treehouses opened fire at the advancing ground forces. They eliminated the Chiron Models in the mix with AMP rounds, and Valkyrie Units with PES rounds.\n> \n> 00.01.42 - The Valravn ground forces retaliated by firing their portable rocket launchers at the treehouses, burning at least six of the structures. Marines positioned in the eastern valley that overlooked the area below began firing at the ground forces to buy time for their fellow Marines to escape the burning treehouses.\n> \n> 00.02.00 - The Marines in the eastern valley were outflanked by Valkyrie Units, who proceeded to eliminate them in CQC. The last Marine detonated his grenades in his belt moments before death, resulting in an explosion that neutralized the Valkyrie Units in the vicinity.\n> \n> 00.02.45 - The Marines from the treehouses retreated into the cave. Valravn forces breached the last defenses. They proceeded towards the cave.\n> \n> 00.03.00 - Thermal enhancement imaging activated and revealed the Marines gathering at the mouth of the cave. From the distance by the shore, several humanoid entities with non-existent heat signatures were seen, appearing and disappearing from the camera feed. They are approaching the cave.\n> \n> 00.03.45 - The Marines stood their ground briefly before retreating deeper inside the cave. Valravn forces pursued, but were shortly neutralized after the appearance of several quadruped entities with slender limbs, long ears and forked tongue. The entities emitted no heat signature. They are notably fast that they are almost imperceptible in the camera feed.\n> \n> 00.04.00 - A growing number of Valravn assets were neutralized in the process. Some of the ground forces unit attempted to fire their portable rocket launchers, only to miss. Their bodies and protective suits were gruesomely torn apart by the //Silakbin//s.\n> \n> 00.04.23 - The humanoid entities owned by Valravn, designated in this document for brevity as \"La Llorona\" [[footnote]] Based on the recovered Civilian Camera Footage. [[/footnote]], engaged the //Silakbin// packs, resulting in the instant neutralization of some of the Valravn assets.\n> \n> 00.04.25 - The remaining La Llorona Units engaged the //Silakbin// packs in CQC. One of them in particular managed to establish physical contact with a //Silakbin// and attempted to pull it towards the shore.\n> \n> 00.04.29 - The //Silakbin// screeched[[footnote]] Audio muted due to the sound's cognitohazardous nature. [[/footnote]]; the La Llorona Unit was visibly disoriented as it let go of the //Silakbin//. Several //Silakbin//s disengaged from the other La Llorona Units, only to redirect their attack on the disoriented La Llorona Unit.\n> \n> 00.04.35 - Valravn ground forces managed to retreat in a safe distance. They provided cover fire for the La Llorona Units, which earned the attention of the nearby //Silakbin//s, some of which departed from the main group currently in melee against the La Llorona Units to attack the ground forces.\n> \n> 00.04.40 - Some of the Chiron Models and Valkyrie Units were sacrificed to allow the ground forces and the rest to reach the shore for safety. The //Silakbin// packs did not pursue and instead, redirected their attention at the remaining La Llorona Units.\n> \n> 00.04.57 - Some of the individual La Llorona Units managed to tear apart //Silakbin//s with their cybernetic weapons, only to be taken down by others from its pack in retaliation. The surviving La Llorona Units attempted to disorient the //Silakbin//s by emitting a collective cry, only to solicit a combined screech from the //Silakbin//s that drowned the noises of the La Lloronas' cries, resulting in the incapacitation of the Valravn assets.\n> \n> 00.05.00 - Tactical retreat of Valravn forces was completed, with La Llorona assets abandoned and destroyed by the //Silakbin//s.\n> \n> [END LOG]\n\nParticipating Marines were screened psychologically following the engagement. A number of thirty-seven (37) Marines became deaf while a number of twenty-five (25) Marines suffered stress disorders due to their exposure to the auditory cognitohazards produced by the La Llorona Units and the //Silakbin//s. They were treated with Class-B Amnestics and were given psychological and hearing rehabilitation therapies to cure their deafness and stress disorders. Marines failed to be cured by the treatments were moved to desk jobs for the sake of their well being.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nAfter the 05 SEPT 2020 Engagement, the Anomalous Warfare Battalion's External and Foreign Relations Department received an invitation from the SCP Foundation's External Affairs Department for an open conference with a Valravn Public Relations representative.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"ACCESS TO CONFERENCE LOG 5142-A REQUIRES SECURITY CLEARANCE LEVEL 5\" hide=\"-CLEARANCE ACCEPTED\"]]\n\n**CONFERENCE LOG 5142-A**\n\n> **DATE:** 06 SEPT 2022\n> **TIME:** 0900 HOURS\n> **SUBJECTS:** Valravn PR Representative Mr. Doe, Dr. Reese Silva of the Foundation, and Col. \"Omega\", PN(M)\n> \n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> //The camera activates and revealed three persons sitting around a circular wooden table.

The Valravn PR Representative then sat down.//\n> \n> **Valravn Representative:** Good day, Colonel. We are happy to finally meet you. I am Doe, just Doe, and I will be representing the Valravn Corporation on their behalf.\n> \n> **Dr. Reese:** We are glad that you have accepted the parlay.

What do you want, Valravn?\n> \n> **Doe:** We wanted to tell you that the Valravn Corporation has suffered tremendous losses of personnel and equipment over the past few days. We are hoping for a cease fire agreement in order for us to completely pull out of your nation's territory.\n> \n> **Col. \"Omega\":** The nerve of you demanding us of anything after you killed our people. And if we don't stop killing your employees, what will you do then?\n> \n> **Doe:** Our company is a legitimate business entity, and as such, we are protected under the second provision of the \"Pristina Protocol\" that forbids any entities to attack us if we have decided to wave the white flag. That means you, Colonel, and your beloved Battalion. //[Grins]//\n> \n> **Col. \"Omega\":** You do realize that you're still mercenaries and that you are not covered under Geneva Convention, right? And don't mention the Protocol to me, we're not the Diablo's Battalion[[footnote]] 666IB or the 666th Infantry Battalion, \"El Batallón de la Diablo\", is the Philippine Army's very own Paranormal Combat-capable Unit.

You have lost here today and you will suffer the same fate in the future. We are aware that your company is continuously expanding their armaments to increase their functions, but news flash, so are we.\n> \n> //The Marine Officer stood from his seat.//\n> \n> **Doe:** Well, in that case, I'll take that as a 'no'. We will still pull out of the islands either with your cease fire, //[Looks at the direction of Dr. Reese]// or through the assistance from one of our benefactors. We are hoping that this... \"sour\" relationship between our organizations would bloom into something... lucrative.\n> \n> **Col. \"Omega\":** What the hell does that mean?\n> \n> **Doe:** There are forces in this region that are beyond your understanding, power and control. We, at Valravn Corporation, offer our services to those who can afford it regardless of our past with them, and believe me, Colonel, one day you will avail our services.\n> \n> //Doe stands up to leave//\n> \n> **Col. \"Omega\":** Fucking salesman, right out of the script.\n> \n> [END LOG]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Items Recovered:**\n\nThe following are recovered from the //Sinumpa// hideout in Tarawakan, Tawi-Tawi:\n\n* A leather-bound ritual book\n* A set of tools typically used in surgery\n* 450kg of dog remains stored in a black plastic bag\n* Candles\n* Bundles of sampaguita flowers\n\nDue to the effectiveness of the thaumaturgic ritual, the aforementioned objects were stored for safekeeping, its existence denied from groups of interest and irrelevant personnel.

He was then reunited with his family, who assumed him dead after he disappeared for twenty three years. Foundation agents within the Department of Social Welfare and Development disseminated false news to the family, who reluctantly accepted Bagatsing back. Undercover AWBn Marines from OMNINTEL Division and Agents from NBI-SOU were deployed in the neighborhood where the Bagatsing Household was located to protect Arturo from any //Sinumpa// elements that might retaliate for his \"sudden return to the fold of the government\".\n\nCurrently, he is working as a tricycle driver in Davao City and is annually receiving monthly pensions from the government.
