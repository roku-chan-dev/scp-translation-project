There will be bloodshed. It is time for [[[wrathcon|Wrathcon]]], and only one article will remain! No teams. No reposts. The theme is //evil//, and all losing articles will be deleted. The winner will stand tall upon the corpses of the drafts that die in the coming battle. Good luck.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n\nAs the visual archives contest ends with around one hundred entries, winners of each of the seven categories have been announced and displayed proudly in their respective categories. The event was able to shine a much-needed spotlight on the artists of our community, using prompts that targeted the eras of SCP, alternative formats, international works, and focal characters.  \n\nWhile art is a visual storyteller, some things cannot be said with words alone, so I will take this opportunity to show off the winners, and discuss a bit about who they are drawing, techniques they are using, and give some insight into the contest judges minds as we went through each piece.  \n\n \n\n> = Characters and Mobile Task Forces\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/YVL57Rv.jpg\n|caption=Yaldeboath, great devourer\n|align=center]]\n“Yaldeboath, great devourer” by [https://x.com/DooRatr DooRatr] is as complex as it is terrifying, depicting the Sarkic based god of flesh in a position of devotion and multiple layers of fleshy viscera.  \n\nLayers of red and white are used to build a depiction of devotion to Yaldeboath. Starting from the outreaching hands of hundreds (which have been painstakingly painted in various poses) clouded over with pillows of flesh. The bottom portion is topped by an image of a person being made from the fleshy layers and pulled up into a sky of arteries and veins to presumably be devoured by the face representing Yaldeboath.\n\nDooRatr does a splendid job at using various shades of red that blend into fleshy tones to make you feel like you are surrounded by the suffocating heat and moisture of the inner body, something often used in stories describing Yaldeboath. It is disturbing, it is dense, and it is beautiful.  \n\nWonderful work, DooRatr!\n\n \n\n> = Groups of Interest\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/0mahFcl.jpeg\n|caption=grand karcist ion\n|align=center]]\nNo matter what I write, my words cannot do the piece “Grand Karcist Ion” by [https://soliusss.tumblr.com Soliusss] any justice, so I asked my fellow judge Entropy what they thought:\n\n“This work shows a harmonious balance between the line of the beautiful and the grotesque. Flesh and sinew become softened rendered forms that flow freely to show the strength and vibrancy of the work in a display of sacrificial vitality through Grand Karcist Ion. With the contrast of a cool toned background with warm and gentle colours for the forthcoming piece, it is truly a display of how complexity in simple form can truly shine.” - [[*user EmotionalEntropy]]\n\nVisually, inspiration from other Sarkic artists such as Niram are evident. I also see Soliusss using themes found in sacred and religious artwork, using a calm expression and a level of detail meant to stun the viewer. Small details as seen in Ion’s six fingers are barely noticeable when places next to the spiralling display of flesh and all kinds of grotesque aspects of the human body.  \n\nI recall during judging that Soliusss’ work was one of the most popular amongst judges, and it's very easy to see why! This masterpiece rightfully earned its place amongst the winners.  \n\nCongratulations Soliusss!\n\n \n\n> = Tales and Other Formats\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/V5RZbNS.gif\n|caption=talloraven waltz\n|align=center]]\nUnexpectedly animated, [[*user ecthelioffd]] created “talloraven waltz” which depicts frames of Draven Kondraki and researcher Talloran as they waltz through various events.  \n\nStorytelling can be extremely difficult to do with still images, so the use of several frames along a long canvas grants the unique opportunity to show the couple as they move across the screen and change. Without knowing much about the characters, you get a feeling that they are closer than close, that they face hardships, and that they overcome them.  \n\nEcthelioffd uses the limited frames to include a frame of Draven on their own, and even if just for a frame, you might catch your breath hoping that's not the end. Thankfully, Talloran returns, but it goes to show that the artist put thought into what parts of the characters history they show.  \n\nWell deserved win, congratulations!\n\n \n\n> = Classic SCPs\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/RoYXChz.jpg\n|caption=Captain Jack\n|align=center]]\nIn the category with the most entries, deciding on a winner was extremely difficult. Even so, [https://www.instagram.com/zerolinesdrawn zerolinesdrawn] blew us out of the water when we saw what they made! “Captain Jack” is a handmade puppet of SCP-492.  \n\nThis medium fit 492 perfectly, seeing as the anomaly is an animatronic dummy, but who would have thought it could be real! Made of cloth and wire, this sculpture stood out from any other entry with its level of craftsmanship. While it may look simple, handmade dolls can take hours of twisting wire, moulding the form, and lots of thread and glue to get the fabric to stay in place.  \n\nNot only that, but the pose was extremely endearing and suited the SCP well. There is always something special about anything made with your hands that you can interact with, feel, and really appreciate.  \n\nCongratulations, zerolinesdrawn!\n\n \n\n> = Old SCPs\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/aGMxUbm.jpeg\n|caption=In the Court of Alagadda\n|align=center]]\nBreaking through reality into the world of Alagadda, [[*user fungiwhale]] depicts the Ambassador surrounded by Alagaddans in their piece “In the Court of Alagadda.”  \n\nAlso winning the title of ‘Best in Show’, this submission was most favoured of all by the judges. And for good reason! The attention to detail in the warped reality of the foreground, layered with strings of light that draw you straight to the focal point and dizzy you with a crowd of faces beyond them. The effort is visible, and to really appreciate the details you must zoom in to every object!  \n\nDark values fading into light ones gives the viewer an easy time settling into the piece. It's clear who you’re meant to look at; the dark figure adorned in gold and backed by followers. I get a sense that this being is the puppet master, and that this door should never have been opened.  \n\nTruly splendid work, Fungiwhale! You blew the crowd away!\n\n \n\n> = Modern SCPs\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/Y3JAC8M.jpeg\n|caption=Pedal to the SCP-7000\n|align=center]]\n[https://www.artstation.com/peannlui Leeann Hamilton]’s “Pedal to the SCP-7000\" depicting Wettle's adventure throughout SCP-7000 was another judge favourite.\n\nA combination of scenes written throughout SCP-7000 using shadowy figures on bright, colourful backgrounds compliments the focal point of the image: William Wallace Wettle. The scratchy, thin strokes used represent the unlucky and messy character that Wettle is, but also leave a visually appealing piece that draws you in.  \n\nAnother judge, [[*user Sugarush]], put it plainly:\n\n“...it was the first piece during judgement that really stood out to me. There were so many incredible pieces submitted to the contest, which makes it difficult to pick out just one favourite, but the colour usage and shading style in this work immediately caught my eye! I feel it demonstrates an incredibly thorough understanding of composition, colour theory, and expression work, the last of which can be very difficult to master in this work's style.”\n\n“I love it to bits, totally deserved to win its category.”\n\n \n\n> = International SCPs\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://i.imgur.com/m9aNj2F.jpeg\n|caption=SCP-ES-320 'Odoskoteinos chorochronos'\n|align=center]]\nBeing the only traditional based winner of the contest, “SCP-ES-320 ‘Odoskoteinos chronochronos’” by [[*user MaggotKeeper]] uses a monochromatic palette to drive the terror of the subject.  \n\nThe use of light and dark in the piece to give the impression of a horrifying discovery lit only by flashlight is extremely well done. Heavy inking along the bottom and edges creates a natural frame, with the only think breaking into that darkness being the fading-out trees that the focal creature is hiding behind.  \n\nMaggotKeeper really shows off their compositional skills by keeping certain elements of the image in pure white, such as the eye, to draw your focus. You get the impression that the viewer is noticed, and then your eye draws down to the corpse the creature stand son and feel dread start to hit.  \n\nThe storytelling of this piece easily reflects the intention of SCP-ES-320 and enhances it with a simple palette and complex details.  \n\nVery well done, MaggotKeeper!  \n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Luxaiko//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n[[div class=\"section-header\"]]\n+ Writing and Art Prompts\n[[/div]]\n\nSite News is bringing you monthly writing and art prompts!
