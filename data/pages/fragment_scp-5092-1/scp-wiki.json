If the President should be outside of these areas between 19:45 and 20:00 on any given night, an agent should be dispatched to fit the location with concealed cameras beforehand or visually confirm the event's occurrence. This is considered a Level 1/Dark Response Situation.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Lowest priority, Foundation resources should be diverted to other tasks if necessary or convenient.[[/span]]\n\nEach hour, all recorded footage is stored automatically in terminal 12, Site-10. It will then be fed through an algorithm (A5092.amk) to check for any deviances from SCP-5092's standard behavior. The Algorithm should be checked for faults annually.\n\n**Description:**\nSCP-5092 is a phenomenon affecting the President of the United States; every night, at exactly 19:53, the President will scratch their nose, regardless of any external factors. This is not due to a direct compulsion to do so but is simply the result of their nose becoming spontaneously itchy.\n\n**Discovery:**\nSCP-5092 was first discovered in 1982 by the second iteration of the Anomalous Signature Recognition Program[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Also known as A.S.R.P.2, this was one of the first times the Foundation used learning algorithms to find anomalies.[[/span]] after being given access to the Foundation's //Important Political Actors Video Archive//, which contained enough footage of SCP-5092 events for A.S.R.P.2 to detect the anomaly.\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#e8f6fa url(http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px;box-shadow: 5px 4px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); \"]]\n[[=]]\nNotice: You are currently viewing an outdated iteration (2009/10/17) of this document.
