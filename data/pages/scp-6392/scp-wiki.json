I just...\n> \n> //O5-1 sighs.//\n> \n> **O5-1:** Fuck, I mean. What have we found ever since we began this investigation? A few documents that are either heavily redacted, illegible or contradict each other? A facility no one except for one person knew existed? An empty grave? That not only doesn't answer anything, it just creates even more questions. \n> \n> **O5-1:** This investigation has just been dead end after dead end after dead end. Frankly, I don't know what to do anymore.\n> \n> **O5-3:** {{Hmmm. Quite the conundrum indeed.}}\n> \n> **O5-1:** That would be putting it lightly.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **O5-3:** {{Perhaps we should lower SCP-6392's file clearance level to 5 and inform the rest of the Council. Get all the hands we can get.}}\n> \n> **O5-1:** Don't bother, if not even Nine knows what's happening with Fritz then it's unlikely that the others would be of much help.\n> \n> //Pause.//\n> \n> **O5-1:** Maybe I should take Nine's advice. Taking a break for a few days would be good for me.\n> \n> **O5-3:** {{Perhaps, perhaps.}}\n> \n> [End Log.]\n\n**Addendum 6392.4:** Note.\n\nOn 18/05/2017, the following note was found by O5-1 on his desk as he returned to Site-01 from his week-long hiatus. Investigation into its possible author or how it appeared in Site-01 is still ongoing.\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\nHello, 1.\n@@ @@\nI have been watching your progress on this investigation ever since you and the machine started it, and I must say, I quite enjoyed this little game of cat and mouse. Sherlock Holmes was always one of my favorites, you know?\n@@ @@\nAnd with that stated, you can probably understand how frustrated I was to see it end so relatively quick. But, I do suppose that it was my fault, as not even the best detective can solve a mystery with the messy trail of breadcrumbs I left behind, so I will answer some of your questions.\n@@ @@\n- Yes, I am alive.\n- No, information about me is not being affected by an anomaly or a Group of Interest.\n- Yes, only one of the documents you've found tells the truth.\n- Yes, there was another Site-5, but don't bother looking for it, you'll find nothing.\n@@ @@\nAnd that's all I'm willing to say. Good luck, and happy hunting.\n@@ @@\n— With regards, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nobody-hub|somebody that you may know.]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6391]]] |  SCP-6392 | [[[SCP-6393]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
