They are well known in the art connaiseur circles for being annoying and posting their art online instead of actually settling down and doing a proper exhibition in a proper place. They declared that the previous time they tried to do one of those, they  allegedly \"had to stop the mobs of art critics from burning the whole place down\". Although Diogene_s has described these events in extreme detail in scribbled letters sent to random civilians all across the globe, I, being a trusted reporter, haven't found any sources or actual proof of this mob of art critics.\n\nAlso, Diogene_s is apparently a penguin. But that's a secret that critics and AWCY members don't want you to know.\n\nThis new gallery is positioned in one of the chic neighborhoods of Barcelona, between fancy cafés and bookshops. According to the the artist, they decided to take over one of the art-nouveau buildings to put their frankly mediocre art, because they thought it would bring them some form of traction and/or recognition within the art world.\n\nBecause of this, we, at Waldon Studio, have decided to visit this new exhibition and review it for our audience.\n\n------\n\nEven if the art nouveau exterior tries to be fancy and fashionable, the interior of the //Diogene_s// **Art?** **Gallery** is as messy as one would expect of someone called Diogene_s.\n\nFor our readers' sake and out of respect for the drawings themselves, I'll go in the proposed viewing order for the exhibition.\n\nLet's start with the first ones:\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"inkblot-title\"]]\n**PHYSICAL** **DRAWINGS** **:**\n[[/div]]\n\nThis seems to be a whole section of the gallery entirely dedicated to drawings made with pen and paper.
