D-81536 expired immediately upon exposure to the memetic agent\n> \n> **Result:** ##red|**FAILURE**##\n\n\n> **Date:** 05/17/1993\n> \n> **Subject:** D-97153\n> \n> **Observations:** D-97153 is a supporter of Marxism-Leninism. Upon exposure to the memetic agent, D-97153 began convulsing violently and expired two hours following exposure\n> \n> **Result:** ##red|**FAILURE**##\n\n> **Date:** 05/31/1993\n> \n> **Subject:**  D-44292\n> \n> **Observations:**  D-44292 is a supporter of the racial beliefs held by the German National Workers Party. Upon exposure to the memetic agent, D-44292 began mildly convulsing and lost consciousness seven minutes following exposure. D-44292 regained consciousness 13 hours after the test and was diagnosed with retrograde amnesia\n> \n> **Result:** ##red|**FAILURE**##\n\n> **Date:** 07/05/1993\n> \n> **Subject:** PoI-2852\n> \n> **Observations:** PoI-2852 is a captured member of a radical sect of the Church of the Broken God. PoI-2852 was seemingly unaffected by the memetic agent, but there was a noticeable drop in hostility and a decrease in religious practices in the weeks following the test.\n> \n> **Result:** ##orange|**MILD-SUCCESS**##\n\n> **Date:** 07/16/1993\n> \n> **Subject:** Senior researcher Arthur Brown\n> \n> **Observations:** Researcher Brown was suspended due to severe violations of the Foundation's code of conduct, including inappropriate sexual conduct with a contained anomaly. In the weeks following exposure to the memetic agent, Researcher Brown adopted a cynical personality unbecoming of him and confessed the extent of his crimes to the Ethics Committee.\n> \n> **Result:** ##green|**SUCCESS**##\n\n> **Date:** 07/17/1993\n> \n> **Subject:** Senior Researcher Simon Agler\n> \n> **Observations:** Agler is a biological male who identified himself as female. Two weeks following exposure to the memetic agent, Agler ceased identifying as female.\n> \n> **Result:** ##green|**SUCCESS**##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7677]]] | SCP-7678 | [[[SCP-7679]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** 오준호 교수.jpg\n> **Author:** 카오스 사이언스\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%EC%98%A4%EC%A4%80%ED%98%B8_%EA%B5%90%EC%88%98.jpg#mw-jump-to-license Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
