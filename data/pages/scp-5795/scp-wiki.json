SCP-5795-1's interior consists entirely of a massive forest with a mountain near its center. No further irregularities from baseline reality were noted.\n\nSCP-5795-2 are inhabitants of SCP-5795-1. They are indistinguishable from common Fae (//Homo sapiens sidhe//) with the exception of being able to inhabit written files in physical or digital format.\n\nSCP-5795-1 currently encompasses the entirety of the Podlasian Voivodeship of Poland.

To prevent a potentially Veil-breaking scenario from occurring, the local facilities of the Foundation initiated Code Yellow, upon which all Site-120 resources were to be diverted to locating Nowak and the cessation of any further anomalous activity.\n\nMeanwhile, residents of the Podlasian Voivodeship of Poland reported numerous SCP-5795-1 sightings. A special task force consisting of Daniel Ashworth, Jessie Rivera, and the remaining members of [[[scp-5936|MTF Omega-5A]]] were dispatched to the location of the sightings.[[footnote]] All of said individuals were chosen for the action due to their prior involvement with PoI-5936-related activities.

They walk through a large hall, where numerous wooden tables, stools, food, bottles, and thaumaturgic symbols are scattered. On the walls, approximately 50 paintings depicting a large humanoid creature levitating in the sky. All of them are untouched, in contrast to the rest of the room's items, which are in a poor state of repair.//\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** And what is--\n\n//As a loud roar fills the cave from above, the entire team looks at the ceiling, revealing a barred opening to what appears to be an arena. At the edges of the above, snow can be seen alongside a clear sky view, suggesting it is the top of the mountain inside of SCP-5795-1. Inside of the arena, a stadium can be seen, with its surroundings filled with sitting Fae, [[[SCP-1000|Children of the Night]]], and numerous other unidentified creatures. They all seem to be humming, focused on the central spot, a throne sits atop a small platform. Three figures stand at the platform surrounding the seat; they cannot be properly seen from this angle.//\n\n//The humming suddenly stops, as one of the figures shouts something inaudible. Two seconds later however it resumes, three times louder than before.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** It's him.\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** W-what?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** It's. Him.\n\n//Asheworth's glove runes are engulfed in flames which start to circle him in a serpentine-like manner. He rushes towards a naturally-carved staircase located on the opposite side of the room. As he does so, the flame starts to move frantically around him.//\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** Daniel, sto--\n\n//As Rivera starts to talk, a small earthquake moves the room. From two of the tables, a total of five Fae awaken, seemingly drunk.//\n\n**Om-5A-1:** Jesus fuck--\n\n//Three of the creatures seem to notice the group, hissing wildly. In their hands, ethereal spears form and the creatures rush towards the group.//\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** Asheworth, get down here!\n\n//He looks at them, only to continue climbing.//\n\n//Two more Fae start waking up, with one of them being at least three meters tall and with four arms and wings. The entity materializes four separate sets of weapons in each hand and starts to attack the exploration team.//\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** Goddamnit, help us out!\n\n//Asheworth looks at the rest of the team, visibly angered. He then looks back at the staircase, then at the rest of them again. He screams as he lunges down the room, with a spear made out of the cave's clay in his hand.//\n\n//As Om-5A-1 and Om-5A-4 start firing towards the Fae, Rivera backs away on one of the containers. Asheworth's flame starts to engulf the smaller Fae. The entity screams, trashing around the room and throwing its weaponry about. It appears to be blinded.//\n\n//As Om-5A-4 gets behind the large Fae, he stabs it with a knife. The entity tries to grab it, but he is quicker. As a result, it grabs and destroys one of the tables. The entity screams, running towards both of the MTF members.//\n\n//Om-5A-1 tries to run away, toppling over one of the stray items on the floor left by the destruction of the table. He gets knocked over, falling on the ground. The Fae starts to run, manifesting three swords in its remaining hands. It looks furiously at Om-5-A-1.//\n\n**Dr. Rivera:** Get out of there, NOW!\n\n//The man tries to get up, but fails to, falling on his knees again. As the Fae is about to stampede Om-5A-1, Om-5A-4 throws himself between them. He is thrown against one of the walls by the larger entity, which appears to be staggered.//\n\n**Om-5A-1:** No!\n\n//Om-5A-1 quickly crawls towards his team member, with one of his legs bleeding. Asheworth throws his spear into the Fae. The entity screams, turning into ash over the course of the next 5 seconds. As it disappears, it screams directly at the man. He does not react.//\n\n//As Rivera gets away from the chests she hid near, the team gathers around Om-5A-4, whose body is heavily wounded.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Move aside, all of you!\n\n//Asheworth runs towards Om-5A-4, kneeling and starting to touch the wound. Around his hands, a bright light appears.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Come on, come on, come on!\n\n**Om-5A-4:** N-n... no.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:**  What?!\n\n**Om-5A-4:** It's fine. I...

Upon the fourth swing however, Asheworth shatters it by parrying its attack and touching it quickly in multiple spots.//\n\n**Nowak:** You disgui--\n\n//He is cut off as Asheworth kicks him in his knee. The man falls down on the ground. Asherworth starts to strangle him from behind. Nowak whispers an inaudible phrase, which visibly makes Asheworth lose focus. He loosens the grip, allowing Nowak to punch him in the face.//\n\n//As Asheworth tries to get up from the ground, Nowak pulls out a pocket knife and stabs him in the ankle. He screams, falling over. Asheworth tries to punch Nowak again, but fails to, as the man starts to crawl away towards the portal. Although Asheworth tries to catch him, Nowak gets up, limping.//\n\n//Nowak starts vocalizing in an unknown language again, with the rocks scattered throughout the arena starting to move towards Asheworth. He touches the ground, which sends a shockwave towards the rubble, destroying most of it and reflecting the rest. The gravel created by the disintegration of the rocks gets to Nowak's eyes. He wipes it away, somewhat shocked by the event.//\n\n//Rivera falls on the ground, deactivating the barrier for herself and Om-5A-1. They both enter through.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Don't let him get away! Not now!\n\n//Asheworth stands up, visibly wounded. Om-5A-1 starts to fire, attempting to terminate Nowak. Halfway through however, the bullets vanish.//\n\n//As the runes start to flicker violently a portal opens behind Nowak.//\n\n**Nowak:** It's too late.\n\n//Om-5A-1 tries to grab Nowak before he enters the portal, failing to do so.//\n\n//A grin fills the man's face as he lifts his hand. All of the Foundation staff start to levitate. Asheworth whispers something inaudible and all of them fall to the ground. He touches the ground, from which numerous spikes are created that try to touch Nowak. He whispers something inaudible and all of them shatter to pieces.//\n\n//Nowak enters through the Way. As he does so, the entire colosseum starts to fall apart. Rocks from the ceiling start to fall, landing near the exploration team.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** //<crawling towards the portal>:// This... is... not... over... yet!\n\n**Nowak:** //<looking directly in Asheworth's eyes>:// Then prove it.\n\n//As the Way closes, Asheworth rushes towards it, entering at the last second. The team follows, which results in the camera which is on Rivera's clothing getting stuck on a pillar. She loses it, and they disappear out of sight.//\n\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n-----\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Aftermath\" hide=\"[-] Aftermath\"]]\n[[<]]\n\nWhen Command located at Site-120 lost contact with Operation High Court's team, the entirety of Site-120's armed personnel were sent in to investigate. Although they were not found, all signs depicted in the recordings were present. SCP-5795-1 was at that time still interconnected with baseline reality, though within it, no lifeforms were found. The only thing not noted by the recordings present within was the unconscious body of Dr. MacCarthy Jr., which appeared to be heavily drugged and damaged. Although all of his Foundation clothing was still present, his Level 3 Clearance card was missing. Attempts to bring him back have been so far unsuccessful.\n\nA thaumaturgic scan of the area was later initiated, with the intended purpose being the location of the portal into which the team disappeared. Three days later, however, not a single sign was located. To where the portal lead remains unknown.\n\n\nAfterward, all civilians claiming to witness the event were interrogated and amnesticized. Though the investigation garnered no results, the researchers remain on-site for further research.\n\nThe whereabouts of Daniel Asheworth and the rest of the team are still unknown.\n-----\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n\n[[=]]\n+ **There has been one additional edit since you accessed the file.**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"[+] Show Changes?\" hide=\"{crfssticall databaseee errosrss//]>\"]]\n[[<]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block name=hills2|align=middle|caption=WE ARE FREE|width=1000px]]\n\n= **CRITICAL SCiPNET ERROR.
