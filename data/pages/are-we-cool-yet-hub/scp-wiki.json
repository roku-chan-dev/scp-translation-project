(For one man's account of how the movement came into its own, refer to the contest entry tale \"[[[Birth of the Cool]]]\".) The movement has no centralized leadership, no headquarters, very few traditions or conventions, and no official membership roles or requirements - the only thing one need do to call oneself a member is to make art that employs, exploits, or revolves around anomalous objects, beings, or phenomena.\n\nThe organization of an AWCY? cell varies wildly from place to place. Many groups are organized into small salons led by a creative mastermind or a professional critic, while others are collectives with no clear leader, and some members prefer to work entirely on their own. In the opinions of some, it is not even necessary to know that the movement exists in order to be a part of it. The tendency of some such groups to produce highly visible public artworks that cause death, injury, or lasting psychological harm has led some to decry the entire movement as a bunch of \"art terrorists\", a label some of its members wear with pride, some repudiate entirely, and some wear ironically.\n\nThe largest and most visible gathering of AWCY? artists in any place or time is \"//Sommes-Nous Devenus Magnifiques?//\", a grand exhibition held every ten years since 1874, at which those \"in the know\" can gather to view and scrutinize a selection of some of the finest works in anomalous art produced over the previous decade. To have a work accepted is considered (by those who care about such things) to be one of the greatest achievements an anartist can attain in a career, and members of cells all around the world petition to have their works displayed.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Collected Data]]\n* [[[Birth of the Cool]]]\n* [[[Birth by Guitar]]]\n* [[[Living in the Limelight]]]\n* [[[Preparation]]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"ratingAsc\" limit=\"100\" tags=\"+goi-format,+_are-we-cool-yet\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n**International Exhibitions:**\n@@@@\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2004-567 Project Proposal 2004-567: \"Unmarked Gravestone“]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2300-001 Project Proposal 2300-001 \"An Outro for the Blues\"]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2059-059 Project Proposal 2059-059: Just a Burning Memory]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/propuesta-de-proyecto-2024-111 Project Proposal 2024-111: Global Warming made it Easier to Break the Ice]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2024-001 Project Proposal 2024-001: \"A Star Before Daybreak“]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2024-003 Project Proposal 2024-003: \"Oedipus Worldwide or 'GAIAF•CK'\"]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/propuesta-de-proyecto-chupamelo Project Proposal 2024-036: \"Suck my dick“]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/projektvorschlag-2014-001 Project Proposal 2014-001: \"War has changed“]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/project-proposal-2017-47-zh Project Proposal 2017-47: \"The Cost of Health“]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Further Research]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"ratingAsc\" limit=\"100\" tags=\"-archived -admin -author -sandbox scp -tale -goi2014 +are-we-cool-yet rating=\"<-0\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n**International Exhibitions:**\n@@@@\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-019-pt SCP-019-PT]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-024-fr SCP-024-FR]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-027-FR SCP-027-FR]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-056 SCP-ES-056]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-103-fr SCP-103-FR]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-156 SCP-PL-156]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-169-ko SCP-169-KO]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-172-fr SCP-172-FR]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-es-202 SCP-ES-202]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-280-fr SCP-280-FR]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-521-ko SCP-521-KO]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-797-ko SCP-797-KO]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2113-jp SCP-2113-JP]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2806-cn SCP-CN-2806]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-149-ko SCP-149-KO]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-zh-038 SCP-ZH-038]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Documented Accounts]]\n[[module ListPages order=\"ratingAsc\" limit=\"100\" tags=\"-archived -admin -author -sandbox -goi2014 -scp tale +are-we-cool-yet rating=\"<-0\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"100\"]]\n* %%title_linked%%\n[[/module]]\n\n**International Exhibitions:**\n@@@@\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/sur-l-oreiller Pillow]\n* [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/live-air Live Air]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Information]]\nAWCY objects are described in a format called a Project Proposal. The Project Proposal is a brief essay by an individual artist about an object s/he has either created or intends to create, and is submitting for consideration in the decennial exhibition or which they are seeking funding or materials from a patron so that they can create it. The page title of a proposal should be \"Project Proposal XXXX-YYY: Title\", in which \"XXXX\" is the year of the next exhibition for which it will be eligible for entry (so if the artist is writing in the late '70s, it would be in preparation for the 1984 Expo), \"YYY\" being an arbitrary number assumed to be derived from the order in which that proposal was received by the exposition's submission jury, and \"Title\" being the artist's name for the object.\n\nThe essay is formatted as follows:\n\n**Title:** //The artist's title for the piece as mentioned above, italicized.//\n**Material Requirements:** A bulleted list of materials the artist used to create the piece or which they expect to need, ranging from the ordinary to the exotic and hard to find to that which is anomalous in and of itself.\n**Abstract:** A brief description of the piece - what it is, what it's supposed to do, how it does it (if the artist knows), how it should be displayed, etc.\n**Intent:** In this section, the artist, speaking in first person, describes their reasons for creating this piece; what motivated them to come up with the idea, what they hope to achieve by producing it, how they went about making it, who the intended audience is, what kind of reaction they hope to get from the audience, and so on.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
