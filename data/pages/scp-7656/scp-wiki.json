[[/footnote]] software among all signal broadcasting towers across the United States and Canada. If any of the devices record an SCP-7656-1 event, they are to activate an interception signal on all devices within a 25-kilometer radius of the initial detection for the duration of the SCP-7656-1 event. Any transmissions intercepted by 7656V6 devices are to be recorded both locally and externally for further analysis. Agents within the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/telecommunications-monitoring-office-hub Telecommunications Monitoring Office] are to monitor the region affected by the SCP-7656-1 event for a period of 48 hours following any events, in addition to embedded Foundation agents within the U.S. Federal Communications Commission monitoring potential information breaches within any broadcasting system which may have witnessed the SCP-7656-1 event. \n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-7656 is an estimated 1.78m tall Caucasian male with disheveled brown hair that reaches its shoulders. SCP-7656 will appear during SCP-7656-1 Events in a state of delirium, psychological stress, physical stress, injury, and/or being physically assaulted by SCP-7656-2 instances. In SCP-7656-1 Events, SCP-7656 will wear a black and white business suit and white sunglasses over its eyes.\n\nSCP-7656-1 is a spontaneous broadcast interruption that will occur on any given day between the hours of 21:14 to 23:20 Central Daylight Time, broadcast from an unidentified source that will periodically appear on television broadcasts within the Northern U.S. and Southern Canada. These broadcasts have been recorded to vary in length from 00:03, to 06:37[[footnote]] The transcribed time is recorded in a \"(MINUTE):(SECOND)\" format. [[/footnote]]. All SCP-7656-1 Events are identifiable from a unique electromagnetic wave pattern emanating from the temporary source of the disruption, and will always contain SCP-7656 paired with distorted audio and video. Frequently, the SCP-7656-1 Events will contain entities wearing traditional French maid outfits paired with a black face mask, dubbed SCP-7656-2. SCP-7656-2 instances have black hair, and are difficult to differentiate between other instances due to the identical similarities in its clothing and facial covering. All SCP-7656-1 Events contain a consistent theme of SCP-7656-2 instances attacking and torturing SCP-7656 with varying means of implementation. \n\nThe source of SCP-7656-1 Events is currently unknown to the Foundation. SCP-7656-1 Events are sporadic in nature, with no discernible pattern of events being identified.\n\n\n\n**Discovery:** On November 22nd, 1986, three separate SCP-7656-1 Events occurred within the cities of Detroit, Michigan, U.S., and Dayton, Ohio, U.S. during local evening news coverage. Due to the unknown origin of the events, and the unique broadcast signal discovered, SCP-7656 was deemed anomalous and efforts were made to limit civilian knowledge following the conclusion of Incident-7656-1-1. Recordings of the SCP-7656-1 Events were seized from broadcasting stations that experienced the SCP-7656-1 Event.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n+++ **Incident-7656-1**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**21:14:** Approximately 7,456 houses within Detroit experienced an SCP-7656-1 Event lasting 00:09.

Please standby.\n\n-----\n\nThe Foundation was alerted to the existence of SCP-7656 via the interception of numerous phone calls by the Telecommunications Monitoring Office. Agents were dispatched from Site-11 and Site-81 to Dayton where a cover story was established that the SCP-7656-1 Event was a TV hijacking. Further news stories and the spread of information was controlled to prevent the knowledge of the SCP-7656-1 Event from spreading to more individuals. All recordings containing or referencing SCP-7656 or sensitive information were seized and brought to Site-81 for storage and analysis.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFurther investigation and efforts to determine the location and identity of SCP-7656 were inconclusive. SCP-7656 was confirmed to be anomalous following two back-to-back SCP-7656-1 Events in [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3462 Bend], U.S. on November 29th, 1986.\n\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+++ **Incident-7656-2**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**22:02:** Approximately 102 households within Deschutes County, Oregon, U.S. experienced the SCP-7656-1 Events, which occurred for the duration of 00:42 and 00:31.\n\n-----\n\n**TV-Broadcaster:** Soon we will be having a segment coming up about how you and your family should have a great Thanksgiving this- ..... -of the- .....\n\n//SCP-7656 appears in front of the camera, laughing.//\n\n**SCP-7656:** Live, from the middle of batfuck nowhere!

Ladies and gentlemen at home, please stand by.\n\n-----\n\nAll recordings of the 4th and 5th SCP-7656-1 Events were seized, in addition to similar protocols to cover the SCP-7656-1 Event as a TV hijacking. Following Incident-7656-1-2, surveillance technology was placed within all TV broadcasting studios in the U.S. in the event of a following SCP-7656-1 event until proper containment mechanisms could be developed.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nNo further SCP-7656-1 Events were recorded for the remainder of 1986 and 1987. Containment procedures were relaxed following the October 18th, 1987 conclusion that the SCP-7656-1 Events in 1986 were isolated events in nature. On June 14th, 1988, the Foundation intercepted numerous reports from civilians across Hill County, Montana, U.S. detailing a TV hijacking similar to an SCP-7656-1 Event. At the time that Foundation agents began to monitor the broadcast in which the SCP-7656-1 event was occurring, researchers were able to further isolate unique properties shown occurring during SCP-7656-1 Events, assisting in the development of 7656V1 devices.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+++ **Incident-7656-3**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**21:30:** Approximately 104 households within Hill County, Montana, U.S. witnessed an SCP-7656-1 Event lasting for the duration of 06:37.\n\n-----\n\n//SCP-7656 appears and bobs its head for 6 seconds before speaking.//\n\n**SCP-7656:** It has been a while!

The SCP-7645-2 instance subduing SCP-7656 against the wall walks next to the SCP-7656-2 instance setting up the golf tee, before it begins to swing golfballs at SCP-7656 while the other SCP-7656-2 instance claps.

The SCP-7656-1 Event subsequently ceases.//\n\n-----\n\nThis SCP-7656 Event is the longest currently known to the Foundation. Analysis of the game theme hummed by SCP-7656 prior to the termination of the SCP-7656-1 Event concluded that SCP-7656 is able to adapt to media and global events not limited to a date prior to Incident-7656-1-1. Furthermore, analysis conducted during the SCP-7656 Event resulted in the development of 7656V1 devices, which were promptly placed throughout North America. Recording capabilities were not present within the devices at that time.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n7656V1 devices documented the successful interception of 7 separate SCP-7656-1 events from June 14th, 1988 - June 19th, 1989. On January 19th, 1989, numerous reports were made describing an SCP-7656-1 Event in Bangor, Maine, U.S.[[footnote]] One of the last remaining areas in which 7656V1 devices had not yet been installed.

SCP-7656 is heard panting prior to laughing and falling on the ground. Approximately 21 seconds later, at least two SCP-7656-2 instances are heard quietly conversing. For the purpose of documentation, both instances were labeled as \"SCP-7656-2-A\" and \"SCP-7656-2-B\".//\n\n**SCP-7656-2-A:** What do we do next? \n\n**SCP-7656-2-B:** Wait.

Further analysis as to the identity of SCP-7656 began.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing Incident-7656-1-4, 7656V2 devices were developed, implemented, and placed at broadcasting stations across North America due to the risk of technological failures within 7656V1 devices. From Incident-7656-1-4 until September 30th, 1995, approximately 76 SCP-7656-1 events were intercepted by 7656V2 devices lasting for a duration between 00:00:15 - 00:03:24. Given the frequency of events, development began on 7656V3 devices to allow for the transcription of SCP-7656-1 Events. Development finished on 7656V3 devices on August 19th, 1995. On September 30th, 1995, an SCP-7656-1 Event was intercepted over Vancouver, Canada, and successfully recorded.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n+++ **Transcription-7656-1**\n-----\n[[/=]]\n\n**22:18:** 0 households within Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, witnessed an SCP-7656-1 event lasting for the duration of 00:39.\n\n-----\n\n//SCP-7656 is bobbing in front of the camera and humming an indiscernible song.//\n\n**SCP-7656:** Wait.

Although the vast majority contained little to no discernable audio. SCP-7656-1 events which did contain discernable audio did not bring notable information regarding the identity of SCP-7656 and as such, transcriptions are omitted for brevity.

Do you have any presents for me?\n\n//Both SCP-7656-2 instances give SCP-7656 two presents. SCP-7656 begins to open all of them.//\n\n**SCP-7656:** Ah, you shouldn't have, it's- ..... -with- ..... -and a teddy bear!?\n\n//Foundation technicians attempt to use 7656V6 devices to cease the SCP-7656-1 event.//\n\n**SCP-7656-2:** Looks like someone is trying to end our show early.\n\n//SCP-7656 stands up and walks toward the camera.//\n\n**SCP-7656:** Looks like our show will have to end early! Make sure to stay tuned for when we make our return soon!\n\n//SCP-7656 laughs as the SCP-7656-1 event ceases.//\n\n-----\n\nA severe analysis of all three sites' internal security systems and the status of on-site 7656V6 devices has resulted in an inconclusive test as to how the SCP-7656-1 event managed to bypass the 7656V6 devices present. Development on the hypothetical implementation of higher-power 7656V7 devices has begun. Larger efforts have been placed in order to identify the location of SCP-7656.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[module ListPages limit=\"1\" category=\"*\" order=\"updated_at desc\"]]\nAs of %%updated_at|%Y/%m/%d%%, this is the most recent SCP-7656-1 Event.\n[[/module]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7655]]] | SCP-7656 | [[[SCP-7657]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
