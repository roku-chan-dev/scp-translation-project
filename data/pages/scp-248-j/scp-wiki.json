Due to its proximity to Locus-248-J, it is recommended that Site-131 be responsible for recontainment of SCP-248-J.\n\nWhenever SCP-248-J enters an active state, it is to be remotely monitored using the pre-existing security cameras at Locus-248-J. At the end of its active state, SCP-248-J is to be retrieved and recontained. Should SCP-248-J differ from its typical behaviour to an extent that it poses a risk to recontainment or secrecy, Foundation Agents disguised as local policemen are to apprehend SCP-248-J under the guise of violent behaviour and amnesticize all witnesses.\n\n**Description:** SCP-248-J is an avian entity with a standing height of 45 centimeters and a weight of two kilograms. Superficially, it resembles a //Gallus gallus domesticus//[[footnote]] A domestic chicken.[[/footnote]], however various parts of its body are replaced by irregular metallurgical implements. In addition, SCP-248-J has a white, abnormally large vestigial tongue growing from the inside of its upper beak.\n\nSCP-248-J exhibits two behavioral states: active and inactive, the latter of which is characterized by docile behaviour and immobility. On every Friday at 17:05 GMT, SCP-248-J enters its active state, at which point it demanifests from its previous position and spontaneously reappears at Locus-248-J.\n\nSCP-248-J will proceed to patronize Locus-248-J, a London pub running under the name ████████ ██, located directly across the street of Site-131's main entrance. Observed behaviour of SCP-248-J consists solely of conversing with other patrons; it has never been observed to order or consume food or beverages.\n\nDuring its active state, SCP-248-J will near-universally be perceived as a non-anomalous human of variable appearance; its perceived features between different active states are inconsistent. Still photography has proven to be the only viable method of capturing SCP-248-J's true avian appearance. Stills taken from video recordings do not share this property; the reason for this is unknown. Interviewing SCP-248-J during its active state has proven fruitless, as the entity appears wholly ignorant of its anomalous nature.\n\nSCP-248-J will remain within Locus-248-J for three consecutive days, even during closed hours. This will either be ignored or dismissed by the owner and other patrons. On the following Monday morning at 02:35 GMT, SCP-248-J will exit Locus-248-J and begin roaming aimlessly, until reverting to an inactive state at 06:00 GMT of the same day.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Jude Ferguson (Senior Researcher) <{{jferguson@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Karen Finlay (Junior Researcher) <{{kfinlay@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** SCP-248-J\n----\n\nHi Karen,\n\nGreat work with writing up the documentation of SCP-248-J. I forwarded it to the Site Director, and they gave their tentative approval before O5 review. I'm inclined to recommend you for further filing work, as you requested.\n\nHowever, the Agents responsible for SCP-248-J's retrieval sent me an email asking for us to attach an image of the anomaly into the article. They tell me it'd help the new Agents to know what exactly SCP-248-J looks like, as the description is awfully vague.\n\nI trust you can handle this formality. Get back to me when you're done, and I'll make sure everything's in order with the image.\n\nThanks in advance,\nJude Ferguson\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Karen Finlay (Junior Researcher) <{{kfinlay@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Jude Ferguson (Senior Researcher) <{{jferguson@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** RE: SCP-248-J\n----\n\nAll done!

This isn't an image of SCP-248-J, it's a non-anomalous chicken, as you yourself fully admit in the caption. I'm not sure what you've been informed on, but SCP-248-J isn't a cognitohazard. There's no reason not to display a genuine image of it on an article.\n\nI've given you a very simple assignment. Get it done //now//.\n\nJude Ferguson\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Karen Finlay (Junior Researcher) <{{kfinlay@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Jude Ferguson (Senior Researcher) <{{jferguson@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** RE: Incorrect image in the SCP-248-J article\n----\n\nOh gosh I'm so stupid! Sorry, I'm new to this whole image thing, I thought this was standard procedure. I really don't know what I was thinking.\n\nAnyways, I've got an actual image of SCP-248-J this time, for sure! Took a bit of researching to find it, mind you, so I really hope this one sticks.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View attached image\" hide=\"- Close attached image\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=SCP-238-J.png|caption=A 15th century wood engraving possibly depicting SCP-248-J.|align=right]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nWith regards,\nKaren Finlay\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Jude Ferguson (Senior Researcher) <{{jferguson@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Karen Finlay (Junior Researcher) <{{kfinlay@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** Still not correct\n----\n\nKaren.\n\nThe image you sent me isn't 'a 15th century wood engraving possibly depicting SCP-248-J'; SCP-248-J first became active in 2002. In fact our analysts confirmed that the image you sent me is in actuality a small portion of //The Garden of Heavenly Delights// by Hieronymus Bosch. I find this a rather unfitting choice, despite the coincidental similarities in appearance.\n\nAt this point I'm assuming that your consistent misjudgements are the result of an office practical joke. In any case, I won't tolerate any more failures. If you fail to get me just a regular, full-body photograph of SCP-248-J, I'll have to consider disciplinary actions.\n\nJude Ferguson\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n**FROM:** Karen Finlay (Junior Researcher) <{{kfinlay@scp.foundation}}>\n**TO:** Jude Ferguson (Senior Researcher) <{{jferguson@scp.foundation}}>\n**SUBJECT:** RE: Still not correct\n----\n\nJude I'm sorry, I really didn't intend for any of this to happen! I just thought I was being a meticulous researcher. Now that I think about what happened, it all really seemed kinda silly. I wanted to show everyone how well I could do research, and it totally backfired on me.\n\nNow //this time// I've got an accurate, full-body //photo// of SCP-248-J!
