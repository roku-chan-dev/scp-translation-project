It's very likely this change in behavior is a ploy to garner leniency, and from there launch a containment breach. I strongly recommend that as more of SCP-3860's systems fail, containment measures be increased. As he slowly dies, he is likely to become increasingly desperate. Should a suitable opportunity present itself, I have no doubt he is going to seize it. Stay on guard and don't let him sweet-talk you into anything that could cause trouble.\n> \n> Take care and godspeed,\n> \n> //Rose Labelle//\n\n-----\n\n++ Series Overview:\n\nIn the conclusion of the Anderson Robotics series, after decades of investigation, raids, and numerous agents lost, Vincent Anderson has been captured and remains in SCP Foundation custody at Site-19.

However, a splinter cell of Maxwellists has other plans for the cyborg...\n\n-----\n\n**Tales:**\n\n* Part 1: [[[The Vanishing of Vincent Anderson]]]\n* Part 2: [[[Non-Volatile Memory]]]\n* Part 3: [[[The Best Laid Plans]]]\n* Part 4: [[[Volatile Memory]]]\n* Part 5: [[[End of Line]]]\n\n-----\n\n**Supporting Documents:**\n* [[[Anderson Robotics Hub]]]\n* [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-64|Site-64 Dossier]]]\n* [[[SCP-3560]]]\n* [[[SCP-3860]]]\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[Family Disclosure Protocol]]] | [[[Anderson Robotics Hub]]] | END**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
