I get a sense there is quite a story there, but so far, they are staying tight-lipped as ever, except for us to expect more new friends in the near future. \n\nNot sure what they are doing over there, but it did come with an additional chunk of funding. \n\nJust from the jump, our new friends seem like a bit of a handful, but we've never failed to rise to a challenge before. Let's make them feel at home, yeah?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-header\"]]\n**Critter Profile: Diomedes**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nOverview!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[f<image Diomedes.png width=\"300px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731;\" title=\"Diomedes Charging\"]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n**Name:** Diomedes\n\n**Species:** //Equus ferus caballus//\n\n**Primary Caretaker:** Jane Kaegen\n\n**Diet:** Mixture of beef, pork, venison and oats.

She's headstrong, for one, but also a bit of a prankster. She enjoys mock-charging the staff and visitors before pulling away and \"laughing\" at them, and that is quite a startling display, I have to admit.\n\nThat's because Diomede's main quirk is that she has a mouth of carnivoran, vaguely canine teeth that she readily uses to tear into all manner of meat presented to her. She has never gone out of her way to actually injure anyone under our employ so far, but as I said, it's better to be safe than sorry when it comes to your fingers when it comes to normal horses, let alone one with four-inch canines.  \n\nEverything else about her seems to be as one could expect for a regular domesticated horse.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n**History!**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\n[[=image diomedes2.png width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]//Diomedes playing.//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\nDiomedes came to us from the Supervisors working at Site-84 and was the last to get settled out of \"this batch,\" This led us to believe that whatever they are doing, we should expect more new friends sooner rather than later. \n\nShe has adapted well to her new home and seems to be doing fine in relative isolation, though we're thinking about introducing her to other equine members of the Center to see how well she gets on with normal horses. \n\nOutside of her apparent love of scaring her keepers and visitors, she has yet to injure anyone, even accidentally. However, due to her puckish nature, I think the idea that was floated to take her for rides would be best described as a mistake in the making.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSpecial Needs and Accommodations!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nEnclosure 43 fit her well enough, but the fences need to be raised after she first arrived. She easily cleared the older arrangement and nearly took out Kaegan. That was also our first introduction to her \"scare\" tactics. Since the rise in height, she has yet to attempt something like that again.  \n\nWhile she likes her mash well enough, a carcass should be introduced for enrichment every other week to allow her to forage as comes naturally to her. I also think we should consider treating her teeth like we do the big cats, just to make sure they stay healthy and undamaged. I can't say I've seen a horse with a toothache before, and I'm not sure if I want to!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nNotes about the Diomedes!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nVet's Note: I had a hunch and checked her charts as well. She is fully healthy, with no signs of defects one should expect, even disregarding the altered digestion system. Guess what I did find, though? Heightened fertility. She's already a handful; I can't imagine how she will be when she goes into heat. Recommendation: Don't introduce her to any stallions!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jane Kaegen\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 07/10/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, Boss, we're really going to need to update the fence around Diomedes's enclosure. A bunch of kids on a school trip accidentally antagonized someone's therapy dog, and it snapped at them. She had a bad reaction to that. I thought it was another of her typically mock charges. But she fully tried to go over the fence! I got in front of her, and she came close to running me down but stopped. She backed up, throwing her head, and... well, honestly, it sounded like growling. Spooked just bout everyone and they got away from the pen real quick, but I'm a bit worried about what she could have done.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Jane Kaegen\nDate: 07/10/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nAlright, I'll get someone on that ASAP. Cal said he saw her prancing around at the back of her enclosure as well, kicking up a fuss about something. We keep treating her like a horse with an extra bell and whistle, but that might be a mistake. Keep an eye on her behavior, make notes, and let's see if we can figure out if she has some differing brain chemistry alongside those fangs of hers.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): All Staff\nDate: 07/10/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, folks, be on the lookout. One of our visitors came to the Center with their therapy dog, and somehow, the poor thing went missing on the premises. I know things around here are busy, but keep an ear to the ground, please. They're a terrier with black fur, very well-behaved, and that it got away from her at all is pretty surprising. She's desperate to get them back, so let's try and make that happen, yeah?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Reggie Masters\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 07/11/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, Fae, I fixed up Diomedes's fences as you wanted, and I think I found what she was nosing after. Deer corpse, a doe, covered in bite marks. I'm not sure what did it, but Diomedes was kinda stalking about, looking at it, sort of like a big cat. Kaegen said something about trying to figure out what makes her tick, and I'm wondering if there isn't a bit of a lion in there, you know what I mean.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Reggie Masters\nDate: 07/11/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThanks for letting me know; I'll make sure her caretakers know to look out for other big cat-like behaviors that could lead to some... problems. \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jane Kaegen\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 07/13/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nBoss! We have... something of a big problem over here at Enclosure 43. \n\nDo you know that service dog that went missing we have been looking for?\n\nI found its collar in Diomedes's barn amongst the hay, and she's not here. There is a big hole in the back fence.\n\nWhat do we do...\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Jane Kaegen\nDate: 07/13/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nOh gods! \n\nI was worried something like this could happen since Reggie mentioned the deer.\n\nWell, obviously, we have to find her. I'll spread the word, tell folks to stop what they're doing if it isn't important and track her down.\n\nAfter that, we'll have to check her stomach and compensate the owner. God, this is going to be so much paperwork. We should have been more careful; she's a horse, probably running on big cat software, and something like this was going to happen eventually.\n\nThis might lead to the Supervisors checking on us again...\n\nDamn, damn, damn.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jane Kaegen\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 07/13/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nFae! Wait!\n\nIt's going to be okay. I think we need to give Diomedes more credit.\n\nShe just wandered up to me, holding the dog by the vest with her mouth. He was covered in mud, freezing, and terrified but unharmed.\n\nShe did a little dance after I took the poor thing from her, acting mighty proud.\n\nI don't think it's Big Cat software. I think it's Saint Bernard, lol.\n\nSo damage control will be a lot easier; just need to fix the fence she plowed clean through. Oh and figure out how she got the collar in the first place. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jane Kaegen\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 07/13/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nThat's amazing! I'll call the owner immediately!\n\nDon't worry about the fence; I'll have Reggie over to fix it immediately. Give that beauty all the apples and kisses from me as you can. She deserves it. Do try to figure out what happened with that collar, though!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Faeowayn Wilson\nRecipient(s): Internal Record\nDate: 07/23/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nDiomedes is proving to be a much different animal than I first believed. \n\nWe cleared up the incident with the dog; it turned out one of the kids was shit, stole it, and hucked it in a riverbed after stealing the collar. Surveillance shows him throwing it in Dio's pen, so... he's in for some fun with the sheriff, and Pete got an earful from me for missing all of that in the first place.\n\nBut since then, she's busted out three more times. The first, she came back to Kaegan with a pair of orphaned fawns. The time after that, she forced staff to follow her and helped them discover an injured eagle, and today, she got into a fight with //something// that got too close to Bakugo's enclosure. No clue what yet, but the claw marks looked deep, and there's always something out there in the woods. \n\nShe's getting patched up now, and Kaegen and I have come to the same conclusion: she's part Bernard or Kangal, one of those big, burly livestock guardians or rescue dogs. I'm not sure where the Supervisors got her from, but I'm getting happier and happier to have her.  \n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"wilson-border\" style=\"margin-top: 7em;\"]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\nSent by: Jane Kaegen\nRecipient(s): Faeowayn Wilson\nDate: 09/14/22\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-body\"]]\nHey, Boss, I just wanted you to know she's finally good with the saddle.
