Old one was full, and I never liked it much anyway. This one is much better honestly. Bigger too.\n@@ @@\nAnyway, I'm at a parking lot. Going to have breakfast.\n@@ @@\nMaybe I'll order pancakes again. I got time before new job. Got to do retrieval.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[size 125%]]**__Note:__** [[/size]]\nCI transport at 2:00 pm -- Be at vantage point\nGOC ambush at 2:15 -- slip by, acquire target\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nAt vantage point. 5 minutes to go.\n@@ @@\nSee GOC strike team. Their new camouflage tech isn't as great against skilled eyes. __NOTE:__ Remember that detail.\n@@ @@\nGot uniform from Lefty that affect perception to see it as GOC or CI for an observer. Will slip by both sides. Handy, pun not intended.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nAcquired the target. There were was difficulty due to thuamaturgic enhanced weapons, but prevailed. Target is a blackbox with a 7-digit combo. Cracked it in 4 secs. Inside is an item from Dr. Wondertainment named \"Insta-Icee Cones\" that come in 4. Packaging is made in shape of a freezer. Really cold to the touch.\n@@ @@\nMeeting client behind of a Toys R Us as stated by them. Odd but they pay.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n\nClient was found spray painting insults on the wall directed at Toys R Us. Client was happy at my arrival, and attempted to hug me. Noticed that client grew a yellow tail.\n@@ @@\nClient expressed satisfaction and stated his affection for Dr. Wondertainment products. He explained he attempted to purchase the retrieved item (a discontinued product) originally by MC&D Ltd, though was banned. Looking into the situation, he would grow frustrated and childishly threaten patrons according to records. Last straw was when he threw 2 pretzels at the auctioneer after losing bid to a CI operative.\n@@ @@\nClient, with a piece of chalk, drew a door and opened it. Other side was a swirling vortex of colors, which he jumped through. The drawn door then disappeared in a cloud of smoke.\n@@ @@\nMoney (10 k) was also found to be fake, memetic agent was cast on them to disguise the fact. They actually were just Monopoly bills.\n@@ @@\n[[size 150%]] **__To Do:__**  [[/size]]\n* look further into client. Check Wonder City (or was it World?) records for possible residence. \n* return uniform to Lefty\n* get new memetic inoculations, keep better record on when they expire.\n* maybe ask waitress out from diner earlier if nothing else.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
