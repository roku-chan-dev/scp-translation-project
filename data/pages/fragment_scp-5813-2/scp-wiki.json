Its body is held in Area-179's anomalous entity cryogenic storage. Performing research on the cadaver is available to all staff Level 3 or higher.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-5813-1 is a male humanoid, 1.81m in height, which is biologically non-anomalous and physically identical to SCP-5813. The entity was created in 1854 as a combined effort by the Foundation and PoI-466[[footnote]]Doctor Cornelius Waksmundski, a well-known alchemist operating within Boston, MA in the mid-to-late 19th century.[[/footnote]] to keep knowledge of SCP-5813's anomalous nature from becoming public.\n\nSCP-5813-1 possesses knowledge typical of a subject serving public office but is incapable of taking a stance or making decisions without authorization from its handlers. The entity is fully versed in previous decisions made by SCP-5813 as well as its perceived history.  \n\nSCP-5813-1 was found deceased in its containment area on 1874/3/8. On 1874/3/9, the entity dispensed a note from its mouth during its autopsy, a transcript of which can be found below.\n\n**Addendum: 5813-1-1- LEVEL-5 SECURITY CLEARANCE REQUIRED**\n> To whom it may concern,\n> \n> I was delighted to know that I was not the only one to have found something strange in our dear former president, but I did not expect it to affect you lot! When you approached me with your dilemma, I jumped for joy. You had tried to make your own 'little misters', but they just didn't work out. Our combined efforts have created something beautiful, my friends.\n>   \n> I've had a toy line in mind for quite some time, but never really had anyone to test it on... But you are among my greatest collectors, and I am honored to announce that you were the proud owners of a custom-made, one of a kind, never before seen, never will be seen again, honorary, celebratory, inauguratory, little mister!\n> \n> That's right; though it appears your trial has run out, __you__ were the very first to own a little mister! But don't get too comfortable, as soon there will be more to collect! Collect them all and become Mr. Collector!\n> \n> Just sign below, and solidify your name as the proud collector of our premiere little mister: Mr. President!\n> \n> @@X___________________________________________@@\n> \n> Eternally yours;\n> \n> Dr. 'Wondertainment' (Does that sound proper?)\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
