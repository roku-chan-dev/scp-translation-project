An investigation into the studio in which SCP-6591 was filmed is currently underway. Dr. Harold Blank is currently overseeing the operation; all information is to be forwarded to him and into the GOI-5889 file.\n\n-----\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:55%;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file%3A2375337-174-yxs0/cizeupmain.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nStill from SCP-6591-1.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6591 designates a set of VHS tapes containing Jazzercize-style instruction videos entitled \"'Cize Up,\" produced by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media (GoI-5889).\n\nOf the four known to exist, the Foundation is currently in possession of one VHS, designated SCP-6591-1. Those who actively view SCP-6591, regardless of their participation, will experience increased appetite, lowered metabolism, and extreme exhaustion. Testing revealed that long-term exposure could cause a weight gain of up to twenty-three kilograms within the span of thirty days.\n\nSCP-6591 tapes, while advertised as exercise instructional videos, are nonsensical in their programming, with only one segment between tapes that could be considered an exercise instructional video. Footage also shows unfinished elements, leading to the conclusion that SCP-6591 tapes were not meant to be released, at least in their current form. (See Addendum One).\n\nSCP-6591-A is the host of SCP-6591. It resembles a human female clothed in a blue leotard. Its face is yet to be viewed, as it is always hidden under a black burlap sack. This mask lacks eye or breathing holes, and it is tied around its neck with a shoelace. \n\nRepeat viewings will sometimes contain references to the events of previous playthroughs, including equipment or tools, background dancers, and/or spilled bodily matter.\n\n\n**Addendum 6591.1:** Abridged Episode Transcripts\n\n//The following is a transcript of the 26th rewatch of SCP-6591-1.//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Addendum+\" hide=\"- Close Addendum -\"]]\n> -----\n> **Section Title:** \"Introduction\"\n> -----\n> [[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:55%;\"]]\n> [[image https://scp-jp-storage.wdfiles.com/local--files/file%3A2375337-175-a2jp/introduction.png style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n> [[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n> Title Card.\n> [[/div]]\n> [[/div]]\n> \n> //(SCP-6591-A is seated on a stool in front of a distant purple curtain.

They are all stepping side to side to the beat of the song, following SCP-6591-A's movement. One dancer, a younger woman, is stepping in a large puddle of what appears to be brain tissue and blood.)//\n> \n> **SCP-6591-A:** Let's shake it up! Now this exercise, in all honesty, doesn't work.

You notice how easy it is to follow the leader when you let your guards down. Let's run in place!\n> \n> //(The dancers jog in place.)//\n> \n> **SCP-6591-A:** You people feel bad about yourselves. And you think I have the power to fix it. I'm your god. You listen to me because I have the answers. Nothing's stopping you from turning this off, but you won't, you're in too deep. You have to make this a routine — you gotta trick your brain into liking this so you keep doing it.  \n> \n> //(SCP-6591-A switches to a back and forth hop.

SCP-6591-A jogs over to a weight rack, retrieving a 10-pound weight and carrying it over to the woman dancing in the puddle.)//\n> \n> **SCP-6591-A:** Keep it goin'! Some feedback I got from the last tape was that you guys wanted a few more alternate exercises for muscle growth along with cardio. Some of the best workouts for your shoulders come from swinging your arms around, especially with something heavy! \n> \n> //(SCP-6591-A draws the weight back, swinging it at the nearby dancer's face. The video cuts to static as it collides. The music continues blaring over wet banging sounds.)//\n> \n> //(The video resumes for three seconds; SCP-6591-A is now kneeling, holding the weight behind its head.)//\n> \n> **SCP-6591-A:** This one's great for your triceps! \n> \n> //(The video cuts to static again for two seconds before resuming, held on a shot of a dancer moving side to side, with the right side of his body splattered with blood.)//\n> \n> //(Another cut, the camera is now following SCP-6591-A as it runs back on stage. The camera then lifts, now held at an angled bird's eye view. All dancers are waving towards it as SCP-6591-A speaks. Another pool of viscera is seen in the lower-left corner.)//\n> \n> **SCP-6591-A:** Great job today, everyone! I'll sure be feeling //that// tomorrow! Remember, if you're not homocizin', you're not tryin'!

Foundation operatives were able to deduce that the \"'Cize Up\" studio was located in Erie, Pennsylvania. An investigation ensued, and the building SCP-6591 was filmed at was found.\n\nThe studio was empty, save for a trail of blood leading to a storage closet and 52 smoking torches in the backstage area. Within the closet were twenty-six bodies, female, all wearing the same clothes with similar injuries to the head. The oldest body had only been dead for twelve hours.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6590]]] | SCP-6591 | [[[SCP-6592]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** cizeupmain.png, introduction.png, prayer.png, tournament.png, homicize.png\n> **Author:** [[*user plaguepjp]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6591 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** city.png\n> **Author:** [[*user plaguepjp]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> \n> This image is a composite of:\n> \n> **Name:** Lancaster, Pennsylvania downtown.jpg\n> **Author:** Randolph Carney\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lancaster,_Pennsylvania_downtown.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
