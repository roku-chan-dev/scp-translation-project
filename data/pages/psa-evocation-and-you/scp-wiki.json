We just pulled up to the graveyard! It's very, very cold, so I'll try to type as much as my fingers can bear. Liu told me to take my leather jacket, but I couldn't find it, so here we are. Suffering in the cold :D. Somehow these lights are helping a bit, their yellow incandescent glow warms the ground around it slightly. Call me a moth all you like. I'm sticking to these :D. Especially since the leaves have been raked from the pathway so there's no extra rustle in the background from all the maple.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/psa-2-electric-boogaloo/path.jpeg\n|caption=Cool image I caught of the path on our scouting mission.\n|width=90%\n|align=right]]\n\nSO why are we here? Well, we wanted to make a small PSA about evocation! This is the making of, of the video for you all to enjoy. I'm personally really excited since we already got some good vibes from this spot when we were scouting graveyards. We even had some presence follow us for a bit.\n\n\nI don't think I mentioned it, but there's this cool memorial for the lost heroes of the Second World War. But, tbh it's quite off-putting. Liu even said it's a bit scary, moreso than in our scouting quest here.  I do have to admit the nerves are getting to me a bit too. With its mild shadow looming over our set :D.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/psa-2-electric-boogaloo/angle.jpeg\n|caption=Statue!!!\n|width=90%\n|align=right]]\n\n\nBut to get to the good stuff. We will be preparing a Vera-Henna portal circle, with which we will try to get ahold of this mysterious presence. We brought tons of candles, salt, and herbs. We also brought some gifts on the off chance that the spirit happens to be a roaming ghost.\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/psa-2-electric-boogaloo/candles.jpeg\n|caption=Here's what it looks like!\n|width=90%\n|align=right]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 31/10/2024 (Thur) 20:49:52 #27676322\n------\nUPDATE! After getting the ritual set up and finished, we waited for something to come and talk to us. And then we waited and waited and waited. After a while, we felt some sort of cold wind pass through us. Which then \"bashed\" against the statue, creating some sort of cracks in it. Which disappeared shortly after, faster than I could pull my camera out After waiting a bit longer, again nothing. We tried again with a bit more herbs, but it just did not do anything. The vibes disappeared by the second try, so we just decided to pack our bags for the night. We might try it again tomorrow but for now, I'll just go enjoy Halloween at home.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n> ##green|**EvoWitch223**## 1/11/2024 (Fri) 9:36:53 #27676322\n> ------\n> Crossposting this to /paraevents, you'll soon see why.\nLast night marked the most paranormal night of my life. I got home shortly after posting, narrowly avoiding a storm. I immediately started to try to figure out what went wrong. But for the life of me, I could not find anything that was off. I even messaged Liu to look at the steps and compare the video, but there was nothing we could have missed.\n\nAfter hours of studious labour, and after my cat had poked me for the 500th time to be fed, we decided to call it quits for the night. I made some food for me and my kitty and decided to watch a movie in my room to celebrate Halloween. Around the halfway mark I noticed a small cold gust on my neck, which at the time was just marginally spooky, fitting for the time of the year, so I didn't bother about it too much. I just cosied further into my duvet. But when the cold breeze did not disappear no matter how deep into my duvet I burrowed to, that's when I got concerned. After an hour, it felt like an icicle was being slowly but surely jammed into my spine's core. I decided to try to make something warm to drink.\n\nAs soon as I got up from my bed, I could feel how the cold almost followed me around. Walking downstairs my cat practically jumped me in the stairway and clung to my shirt. She's usually the \"fuck off, I'm going on my own adventures\" type so I was surprised for sure. (I did get a cat to feel less lonely, ironic right?) She felt quite cold and was shaking like a maraca. I decided to just hold onto her to warm her up, I rarely get to hold her anyway.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/psa-2-electric-boogaloo/cat.jpeg\n|caption=My cat!\n|width=90%\n|align=right]]\n\nComing downstairs I got an idea of why she was looking so scared. My living room window had a sizeable crack on it that somehow continued to the wall next to it, like a crack in the building itself. Obviously, I almost got the living daylight scared out of me, so I went for some tape and cardboard to fix it up. But as soon as I got close to the cracks, the air got really really stale, almost as if I couldn't even feel the air go in. Suffocating yet breathing. I couldn't stand next to it long enough to tape it closed. Something about it felt like it was glowing with the coldness.\n\nI quickly made my coco, and went back upstairs, letting my cat inside of my room and blocking the bottom of my door with a towel to keep the cold out. I laid my cat on my duvet and decided, that I had enough of the film and switched to some late-night conspiracy theory crap from the history channel while sipping my coco.\n\nSo now to this morning. I woke up terribly cold, with my cat now under the duvet shivering on my chest. There was a violating feel to the room, like a surgical theatre filled with students with me being the one examined. I put some more clothes on and walked downstairs to get another look at the damage. I was freaked the fuck out by how far the damage had gone. The cracks had expanded to occupy most of the window and had started to dig into the walls more. I decided to put some cardboard on top of it. As I approached it, it felt like there was a cold gush of wind coming through it, but not like physically? In a way that makes your soul cold if you know what I mean?\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/psa-2-electric-boogaloo/cracks.jpeg\n|caption=Image of cracks, they sadly don't look as animate as they do irl.\n|width=90%\n|align=right]]\n\nit did not look deep enough to even go through the drywall. The glowing was far brighter. It almost felt warm, like it was calling me to snuggle next to it for warmth like a baby coddled by their mother. I can't take my cat to school, so I decided that I'll have a friend of mine pick her up later in the evening. For now, she'll be cosy next to the space heater.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 1/11/2024 (Fri) 11:32:23 #27676322\n------\n\nThere's been a lot going on, the cold drilling feeling is back that I felt last night. It's the same chilly painful drilling. but somehow it feels like it's watching me? like the icicle inside of my spine is seeing my thoughts and judging me. This feeling has been following me since I left the house, which made focusing impossible be abuse it felt like social anxiety x100. I wasn't planning on posting until I got back home, but there's been too much going on to ignore.\n\nI was looking at the video during class on repeat to hopefully find out what was wrong with the ritual. After wracking my brain for too long, I decided to stretch a bit and actually look like I was focusing on the class. As I was looking around I saw something.\n\nI genuinely shat my pants when I noticed the blue glow coming from a table near me. Like a disease following me like a miasma. my breath felt shorter and slower, just like they did at home and my eyes barely had the energy to open. I could've justified it with a bad night's rest, maybe something got into my coco. but to be honest, I couldn't think at all. All I could do was to try to scream my hands and legs to move and get away. But whatever caused the crack to appear, I had to find out.\n\n\nSo like most terrifying supernatural encounters in my life, I chatted with Liu about it. I told her everything. What happened to my apartment last night due to the storm, the chilly feeling, the cracks, the spine tap. She connected the dots quicker than I did. The ritual didn't fail, we evoked something.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 1/11/2024 (Fri) 11:52:23 #27676322\n------\n\nI came back to a house in ruin. The cracks were now everywhere. With icy frost covering everything. The lights don't work anymore, but I could still see everything through the numb glow of the cracks. the horrifying judging I felt in my spine got worse like the cracks in the wall were appraising my every move, counting my every thought to see if what I would do would have any value.\n\nThe icicle in my spine started to go deeper again. That's when I woke from the shock of it all to remember my cat.\n\nI found what was left of her\n\nJust some fur and stray bits and pieces all around.\n\nI don't want to be alon\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 2/11/2024 (Sat) 8:28:63 #27676322\n------\nI finally feel like posting an update. it's been really really rough since I found her on the ground. I don't want to talk about it. But atleast it's warming up here. It almost starts to feel like summer here.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 2/11/2024 (Sat) 10:12:143 #27676322\n------\nIt's way too fucking hot in here. I couldn't take it anymore. I already turned my heating off, rid myself of all my clothes and almost considered shaving my skin off to cool down. I tried to see if the cracks could cool me off but I can't get to them anymore because they are in a layer of thick ice now. I'm typing this from my bed but it's just not cold enough here. I'll have to go deeper into my bed.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 2/11/2024 (Sat) 10:12:8749 #27676322\n------\nHow deep is my bed, why can I feel dirt?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n##green|**EvoWitch223**## 2/11/2024 (Sat) 10:12:487368 #27676322\n------\nThe memorial looks so pretty in the dark. It's starting to get cold again with the snowflakes dancing to the blue hue of the morning sun.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:path.jpeg**\n> **Name:Rayleigh_church_graveyard_by_night_-_panoramio.jpeg**\n> **Author:Luke Cops**\n> **License:CC-BY 3.0**\n> **Source Link:https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?search=graveyard+night&title=Special:MediaSearch&type=image**\n\n\n> **Filename:statue.jpeg**\n> **Name:Guardian Angle.jpeg**\n> **Author:fredrik Andreasson**\n> **License:CC-BY 2.0**\n> **Source Link:https://www.flickr.com/photos/127297977@N05/15447123112**\n\n\n> **Filename:candles.jpeg**\n> **Name:Wind-Candles.jpeg**\n> **Author:Verbena Stevens**\n> **License:CC0 1.0**\n> **Source Link:https://www.flickr.com/photos/131652528@N04/16450709074**\n\n\n> **Filename:cat.jpeg**\n> **Name:2015-01-19 um 09-34-19 - Cat Winter Bokeh.jpeg**\n> **Author:Torsten Behrens**\n> **License:CC-BY 2.0**\n> **Source Link:https://www.flickr.com/photos/29812986@N06/28401105038**\n\n> **Filename:crack.jpeg**\n> **Name:Painted Cracked Wall 01.jpeg**\n> **Author:texturepalace**\n> **License:CC-BY 2.0**\n> **Source Link:https://www.flickr.com/photos/122127718@N08/31235885067**\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
