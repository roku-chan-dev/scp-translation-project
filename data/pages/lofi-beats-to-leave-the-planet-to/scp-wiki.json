Fiercely independent and known for his lo fi aesthetic, Galaxy actually got his start as a protest rapper more closely affiliated with Are We Cool Yet? and Gamers Against Weed before leaving those communities to forge his own path. After fully embracing the Fifthist aesthetic, Youthful Galaxy made some lo-fi essentials like his albums //Starsleeper// and //Alien Girl//. This single \"Away From This Place\" is from his //Silent Secrets// album, of which only one copy was printed. The album was sold at a special auction in New York City. This single has been released with the permission of the owner of the record.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n<< [[[My Life, Aquatic]]] | Away From This Place | [[[SCP-5276 | Let's Vibe]]] >>\n[[/=]]",
