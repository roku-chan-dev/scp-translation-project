Today, I am reviewing a recipe from //A Cooking Chronicle of the Daeva//. I have covered this book once before, specifically in my Daeva Citrus Pheasant Recipe Review, which you can find [# here.]\n> \n> I think it's important to remind oneself that everything, even food, is political. The reason I bring this up is because, as you history buffs out there might know, many people who consider themselves modern and civil are quite uncouth when it comes to a culture that is not their own. Yes, the Daeva are technically no more, but their culture and history has long survived them to present day. Cooking can be an act of appropriation, as can be seen by the hacks over at Ambrose Restaurant with their gentrified menus that are nothing more than hollow imitations of the original dishes.\n> \n> Sorry, I'm getting off topic.\n> \n> What I mean to be getting at is that I will be honoring this recipe by using all-authentic ingredients which were available to cooks at the time. Nothing more, nothing less. Another reason I bring up politics is that according to the book, //A Cooking Chronicle of the Daeva//, this dish was served to honor diplomatic guests! It was used to show off the power of Daeva mycomancy, an oft misunderstood and maligned school of magic. \n> \n> And speaking of mycomancy, I would like to shine a light on my Polish friend Zbigniew Nowak, a member of the PZGA, or in English, the Polish Anomalous Mushroom Picking Association! Thanks to him and the journey he made to Kazakhstan earlier this month, I was able to obtain the Kueše Kae-Shiz mushrooms which the Daeva actually used in their cooking all those years ago! In exchange for his efforts, Zbigniew requested I show off his report on my blog, something I am happy to oblige him for. \n> \n> Please enjoy!\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #220A29; background:#7B68EE; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; border-radius: 5px; box-shadow: 0 0px 0px rgba(102,0,0,.5); padding-left: 50px;\"]]\n[[span style=\"color: #D9ED68\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Kueše Kae-Shiz** \n//Caro montis//\n[[/=]]\n------\n**Type of mushroom:** Edible\n\n**Appearance:**  The pileus of the species ranges from pale grey-brown to brownish-red, with broad, flat scales on a paler background and fading toward the margins. It is first hemispherical before flattening out with maturity, and measures 5–10 centimetres in diameter. The narrow, crowded gills are free and initially pink, then red-brown, and finally a blood red. The cylindrical stipe is up to 6 cm  tall by 1–2 cm wide and bears a thick and narrow ring, which may be streaked on the upper side. The firm flesh is olive-colored, although it stains a pale pinkish-red on bruising. The spore print is dark brown. The spores are oval to round and measure approximately 4.5–5.5 μm × 5–7.5 μm, and the basidia are usually two-spored.\n[[/span]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=250px\n|url=mushroom.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Freshly grown.\n]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[span style=\"color: #D9ED68\"]]\n**Anomalous properties:** //Kueše Kae-Shiz// are exceedingly rare outside Nälkän communities due to it requiring the use of mycomancy in order to birth its spores. Outside of requiring thaumaturgic processes in order to exist, //Kueše Kae-Shiz// do not show any other anomalous properties. \n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Occurrence:** As previously established, //Kueše Kae-Shiz// are not naturally occurring. However, the means by which to create them are still known by Nälkän practitioners. The process traditionally required the ritual sacrifice of an Aurochs (nowadays replaced by domestic cow or yak) drained of its blood and buried under the mountain snow. For three days, an elder is to pour the drained blood of the bovine over the spot it was buried. Should this ritual be followed, the //Kueše Kae-Shiz// will blossom from the snow on the dawn of the fourth day.\n[[/span]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[span style=\"color: #D9ED68\"]]\n**History of use:** //Kueše Kae-Shiz// was often used for culinary purposes by the Daeva empire throughout it's history. It remains popular in Nälkän communities as a delicacy for it's notably meaty flavor and robust flavor profile. For those curious,  //Kueše Kae-Shiz// is ancient Daeva for 'Flesh of the Mountain'. For our Pilsesaran readers, it is translated as follows: \n\n[[div class=\"pilesaran\"]]\n\nFleshs, Of, Thse, Mountain,\n\n[[/div]] \n@@@@\n@@@@\n**Recommendations:** Should you want to pick //Kueše Kae-Shiz//, make sure to seek out the proper channels. I searched for a Nälkän community in Naruzum Preserve, who I paid handsomely for their time.\n[[/span]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n> Once again, thank you so much Zbigniew, and without further ado, onto the recipe!\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=soup1.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The basics.\n]]\n-----\n> **In order to make this dish, you will need:**\n> * 1 whole onion, diced\n> * 2 cloves of garlic, minced\n> * 2 cups of Aurochs bone broth (I visited my local necromancer for some.)\n> * ½ cup of milk (I used genuine Aurochs milk, courtesy of Moosphere Inc!)\n> * Salt to taste\n> * Freshly ground black pepper to taste\n> * 450 g of //Kueše Kae-Shiz//, cut up in halves, though if you want smaller, you may absolutely do so!\n> * A tablespoon of butter\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n> **Instructions:** \n> # In a large sauce pan, heat up the butter. Don't let it brown too much.\n> # Toss in the //Kueše Kae-Shiz//, onion, and garlic, then cook them until they have released most of their liquid. This should take anywhere between 6-8 minutes depending on how big you cut them.\n> # Gently stir in the Aurochs bone broth as to avoid splashing.\n> # Let this mixture come to a boil, then add in the Aurochs milk. Stir gently.\n> # Turn off the heat, don't let it come to a boil again!\n> # Serve and enjoy!\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=soup2.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=The end result, garnished with optional parsley! \n]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n> And there you have it!\n> \n> But how does it taste? Well, my friends, I am happy to report that this Daevite delicacy is doubtlessly delicious! The instructions are simple to follow and it makes for about 2 large servings, maybe 3 medium ones. \n> \n> So next time you have to impress someone with home cooking, or you have to honor a dignitary from your spouse's family, don't hesitate to bust out this incredible and historic dish. After all, what is a family dinner but a diplomatic meeting?\n> \n> Stay hungry, my friends.\n> \n> - Samantha\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** souppreview.jpg, soup1.png, soup2.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** mushroom.png\n> **Author:** Marshall, Nina L.\n> **License:** CC BY SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_mushroom_book_(6289382594).jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n> **Note:** Image was modified by [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
