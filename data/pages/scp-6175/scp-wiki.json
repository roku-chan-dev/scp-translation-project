All extranormal radio signals and soundwaves originating from SCP-6175 are to be recorded, translated and stored within Site-300-12's database. All mentions regarding anomalous phenomena surrounding the //Voyager 1// spacecraft are to be tracked and deleted by Foundation Webcrawler FIRESTORM.aic.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6175 is the //Voyager 1// probe. Following an anomalous event on the 09/15/2022, SCP-6175 turned on an unauthorized and previously unknown video camera implanted to its disk, and gained contact with a NASA research team within the Marshall Spacial Flight Center, in Alabama, for the next 5 months. During the spanned amount of time, SCP-6175 underwent several anomalous phenomena.\n\nSee Addendum 6175.1 for additional information regarding the timeline of events.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**Addendum 6175.1:**}} Timeline of Events\n[[/=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Addendum\" close=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\nThe following addendum includes a timeline of events regarding SCP-6175's autonomous behavior and additional anomalous phenomena.\n\n> **09/15/2022 - 09/28/2022:** //Voyager 1// begins broadcasting footage of Neptune while gaining contact with NASA researchers.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** None.\n\n> **09/28/2022 - 09/30/2022:** NASA researchers report contact loss with SCP-6175 for unknown reasons. Hypothesis regarding the impact of the //Voyager 1// probe with another object were brought up, although quickly discarded. Research team was successfully infiltrated by MTF Gamma-55.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** SCP-6175's camera was reported to be shifting and vibrating prior to loss of contact. Following this event, SCP-6175 regained contact with the research team.\n\n> **09/30/2022 - 10/22/2022:** SCP-6175 is hypothesized to be teleported to an unknown location, believed to be the Boötes void, otherwise known as [[[SCP-3200]]]. The object is reported to be rotating constantly. No soundwaves, celestial bodies or astros are recorded during said amount of time. \n> \n> **Additional Notes:** SCP-6175 was reported to be vibrating or shifting occasionally in an aggresive way for the following weeks.\n\n> ##red|**3 superfluous logs removed for brevity.**##\n\n> **10/31/2022 - 11/01/2022:** First contact between SCP-6175 and a foreign object within its proximity. Object reported to take the form of an antenna, similar to that of the //Voyager// diagram. \n> \n> **Additional Notes:** The antenna was reported to be mangled and deteriorated.\n\n> ##red|**5 superfluous logs removed for brevity.**##\n\n> **11/01/2022 - 11/08/2O22:** Second contact between SCP-6175 and another object, reported to be a paper note. Object was zoomed in by SCP-6175's camera in order to be identified. The following note read:\n> \n> Voyager did things no one predicted, found scenes no one expected, and promises to outlive its inventors. Like a great painting or an abiding institution, it has acquired an existence of its own, a destiny beyond the grasp of its handlers.\n> \n> -- //Stephen J. Pyne//\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** The note remained floating for a week before vanishing. It was unable to deteriorate.\n\n> **11/08/2022 - 11/28/2022:** NASA computers reported radio signals originating from SCP-6175's satellite dish, which were identified to be morse code. The signals were translated into English, and the anomaly was reported to be the lyrics of \"Space Oddity\", by David Bowie.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** A loud hum of the song's instrumental was heard throughout the assigned NASA facility, followed by human footsteps.\n\n> ##red|**7 superfluous logs removed for brevity.**##\n\n> **12/03/2022 - 12/31/2022:** SCP-6175 is seen advancing on a straight line at high speeds, several parts of itself splitting and traveling faster than the anomaly. The separate parts follow SCP-6175 regardless of their status. SCP-6175 progressively emits a large amount of radio signals throughout the mentioned span of time, translated from morse code into the message from the note recollected last month.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** The separate parts were reported to be deteriorated.\n\n> **12/31/2022 - 01/14/2023:** SCP-6175 stops, before broadcasting static for the following 2 weeks.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** None. Radio signals were sent to the research team, translated as human shouting and crying.\n\n> **01/14/2023 - 02/12/2023:** SCP-6175 makes contact once again with its research team. During this span of time, several paper notes with stars and planets inscribed into them began spawning around SCP-6175.\n> \n> **Additional Notes:** One of the notes was said to have several drawings, with one doodle resembling three individuals, though one shorter than the others, inscribed into them. SCP-6175 sent several radio signals, similar to illegible human vocalizations.\n\nFollowing the last log, no anomalous phenomena spawned within SCP-6175's proximity. The anomaly was then reclassified by the 6175-assigned team as neutralized.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**Addendum 6175.2:**}} Incident Log\n[[/=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Addendum\" close=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\nOn the 02/04/2025, a few months prior to the end of the //Voyager 1//'s mission, several radio signals were sent to a NASA facility kept within Cape Canaveral. Most of the sent radio signals, proceeding from SCP-6175 itself, were illegible but able to be stored, with only one of them was translated and kept within the facility's database until discovery by MTF Gamma-55:\n\n> I love you. And I always will.\n\nFollowing this event, the //Voyager 2// probe began sending meaningless radio signals to the NASA station at Cape Canaveral, before turning off once again[[footnote]]The //Voyager 2// already ended its mission by the time the signals were sent.[[/footnote]]. SCP-6175 later broadcasted the Boötes Void, before the //Voyager 2// satellite, therefore designated as SCP-6175-1, appeared within SCP-6175's surroundings. \n\nAdditionally, a radio signal proceeding from SCP-6175-1 was sent to the facility at Cape Canaveral:\n\n> I love you too, dear. It's time to come back home.\n\nSCP-6175 reclassified to Euclid. Attempts to recover SCP-6175 and SCP-6175-1 are currently ongoing.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6174]]] | SCP-6175 | [[[SCP-6176]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
