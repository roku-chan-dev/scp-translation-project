I have traced them in Microsoft Word and put my own personal twist on them to make them somewhat different from their original counterparts. I do not wish to steal anyone's work as tracing is my personal style and if the creator of the original photo would like me to take my traced counterpart I will do so without further issue. I only want to contribute to the wiki with my art as anyone else would and I haven't been making any profit off my artworks. \n> I apologise for any inconvenience that may arise from this page\n> - Dr Mobulous\n+ __**SCP-049 \"The Plague Doctor\"**__\n+++ __**28/03/23**__\n[[<image 049.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-966 \"Sleep Killer\"**__\n+++ __**5/04/24**__\n[[<image 966.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-1471 \"MalO ver1.0.0\"**__\n+++ __**6/04/24 - 8/04/24**__\n[[<image Malo.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-3199 \"Humans Refuted\"**__\n+++ __**26-27/05/24**__\n[[<image 3199.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-2521 \"●●|●●●●●|●●|●\"**__\n+++ __**27/05/24-17/10/24**__\n[[<image 2521.png]]\n> (There was a lot of procrastination with this one)\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-087(-2) \"The Stairwell\"**__\n+++ __**18/10/24**__\n[[<image 087.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-2006 \"Too Spooky\"**__\n+++ __**23-26/10/24**__\n[[<image 2006.png]]\n\n------\n\n+ __**SCP-354 \"The Red Pool\"**__\n+++ __**30/10/24-6/11/24**__\n[[<image 354.png]]",
