The Administrator is expected to give a formal address to the Foundation on SCP-3319 at 22:00 on 4/20/2577.\n\n> ++ Comments:\n> ------\n> **4/KStuyvesant:** Correlation doesn't equal causation. Do we have any further evidence, besides seismic activity (which wasn't unusual with SCP-001's rampages), that SCP-3319 is responsible for this?\n>> **4/MKeller:** A transmission came in from satellite footage just before the sky went green. Something huge, white, and oblong was leaving Earth's orbit from the vicinity of the North Pole. It was covered in those double-moon insignias. It opened - more accurately, //blossomed// - and the footage went dead.\n>>> **4/KStuyvesant:** I see. Could you get anything from any other Foundation satellites?\n>>>>  **4/MKeller:** No luck. We've got dead air all around. It's likely they didn't survive the trip.\n>>>> \n>>>> Look, I'm going to go out on a limb here with a hypothesis. The entire planet has been taken somewhere else, likely extradimensional.\n> ------\n> **3/PMasterson:** Any signs of SCP-001?\n>> **4/KStuyvesant:** Seems to have slipped off the radar, for now. If what Dr. Keller's saying is correct, I think SCP-3319 might have saved our lives, and left SCP-001 drifting off in the void it created. \n>> \n>> **4/MKeller:** There are no signs of //any// contained objects anywhere. O4-19 just reported a simultaneous 100% breach of all tangible scips. \n> ------\n> **2/JHughes1:** i tried slitting my wrists before the ZK and now I'm up to my knees in this office in my own blood HEALING FACTOR?? skin heals but blood too fast where is all this extra blood coming from it doesnt even hurt at this point this isjust sill ykeyboard is breaking is drenchd t oo muc hblo\n>> **4/MKeller:** Time and a place for your jokes, Jon.\n>>> **4/KStuyvesant:** Wait, I've been hearing similar reports at Site-19. Someone took a cyanide pill just after Incident-3319. They've been vomiting blood for at least an hour now. \n>> **2/APhillips:** Put some duct tape over it, that worked for Danvers \n> ------\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum: Message from the ☽☽ Initiative\"]]\n> Foundation.
