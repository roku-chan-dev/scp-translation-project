I'm UNCGriffin[[footnote]]Not actually from North Carolina, but I spent a very important part of my life there when I was young[[/footnote]](she/her), a small-time author on the Wiki. I'm a big fan of canons, especially On Guard 43, From 120's Archives and No Return, and can talk for hours on them if left unchecked. As such you can usually find me hanging out in the CANONEXUS Discord server.\n\n\nI usually write light-hearted, slice-of-life fiction, though recently I've branched out a bit more and written a few more serious pieces. My interests include The Magnus Archives, The Mechanisms, Morrowind, TTRPGs, and transgender lesbianism. I read roughly half of the articles I consume on the treadmill's browser while I run.\n\nI'm also a translator and Admin of the gestating Hebrew Branch of the SCP Wiki, which you can find a link to [http://scpwiki-he.wikidot.com here]. If you're a Hebrew speaker, join our Discord!\n\n[[=]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=scl]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=clb]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=lgbt]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=tsf]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=awb]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=pvr]]\n[[include component:sybadge code=tlt]]\n[[/=]]\n\n**Authorial Will**\nIf I ever disappear for more than one year from both the Wiki and Discord, I leave my collab pages to their respective co-authors. My solo work, I leave in the custody of [[*user typoenjoyer]], who also has my phone number.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Plagiarism Wall]]\nWrite whatever here. Or don't, I'm not your mom.\n\n\"♪North Carolina, what a wonderful state. It ain't no passing STATE!!!♪\" -Researcher [[*user IHearVoices]]\n\nThat sign can't stop me because I can't read! - [[*user NewFoundDanger]]\n\nThis is the only time I've seen my state be mentioned by someone who doesn't live here - [[*user MrMeltingPoint]]\n\nFirst time I've been in North Carolina. And I'm stuck in this uni's janitor closet. Someone let me out of here! - [[*user Diogene_s]]\n\nHow the hell did I get to North Carolina, and why is the janitor's closet rattling so much? Creepy stuff! - [[*user Lemonsense]]\n\nI just want to say for the record that I actually really like North Carolina. Every time I've visited it's been a great experience. There's this little highway town called Boone that I really like.
