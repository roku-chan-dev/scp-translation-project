No further anomalous activity observed.\n\n**DETAILS:** Event occurred on June 25, 1993 in Northfield, Maine. Present were Stephanie Harris, Steven Gibbs, Melissa Page, and Casey Matthews.\n\nNorthfield residents reported observing a blue flash of light in the direction of Cherry Ln at approximately 10:45 PM. Melissa Page's car was found stationary on Cherry Ln, 4 mi from Northfield. Vehicle was disposed of post-examination, and road reopened on August 1 after investigation and cleanup. All local witnesses were amnesticized following interview.\n\nVictims were reported missing following event. Casey Matthews returned to her residence two days later with no memory of the events of June 25. Preliminary medical examination revealed no abnormalities; however, changes in her personality were reported by Diane and Vincent Matthews.
