It means \"So horrible that there's no hope. At all. Ever.\" Which I think is a pretty good descriptor, considering. Isn't Emma just the smartest? So talented, unlike soME //PEO**PLE**//[[/footnote]]\n\n**Steps for Crisis Prevention:** I am literally shaking right now. I cannot stress this enough: moving forward, if anything nice[[footnote]] Heretofore to be understood as: AN! Y! THING! //NICE!!// [[/footnote]] -- happens to the soulless monsters who run SCP-SPC, I'm going to have a stroke. I mean it. I'll have a stroke, I'll die, that's it. Boom. Nervous breakdown, stroke, dead. So unless you actively want me to be //murdered// by how horrible it is, you need to do something about SCP-SPC //right now.// \n\nYeah, well, you know what ELSE is manipulative, Linda?! //This apparent fixation you have with me getting a stroke!// Maybe I should just put it on blast, huh? Ahem: **LINDA MASTERSON GETS A BIZARRE SEXUAL RUSH FROM SEEING HER NEIGHBORS NOT GET ANY OXYGEN IN THEIR BRAIN BECAUSE OF HOW MISERABLE THEY ARE!** Oh, no, don't give me that look, it's //clearly// something you take pride in.\n\n...anyway, if you see something SCP-SPC-related somewhere out on the street or something, just take it to the nearest Society for Concerned Parents outpost and... put it in a... //box??// I guess?? Whatever, I'm //done.//\n\n**Description:** SCP-SPC is //supposedly// this organization called the \"Shark Punching Center\" that I heard about the other day. Anyone with one-and-a-half brain cells to rub together can make out its true intentions. But, since a certain Mrs. Masterson is with us, I see that we'll have to make a more thorough guide for the easily-deceived: \n\n\"Shark\" = \"Baby Shark\"[[footnote]] //,,doot-doo doo-doo-doo,,// [[/footnote]] song = things children like = **Children.**\n\n\"Punching\" = that Japanimation or whatever cartoon my horrid little nephew Craighden likes = scantily-clad cartoon women = //S-E-X// = **Human Trafficking.**\n\n\"Center\" = highest central authority = government secrets = vaccines = Bill Gates = Tom Hanks = **Deep State.**\n\nIf you're reading this, and you haven't dropped whatever you're doing to fight the Deep State \"Shark Punchers\", then you're a sick individual and --I'm already in the process of having you committed. And don't think I won't do it, either! //I'm one signature away from becoming the legal guardian of half of you complete bastards!//-- [[footnote]] **Edit:** As chairwoman of the Edgebrook HOA, I am legally obligated to clarify the previous statement with the following: //ohmy go sh I dont know what i was dooign?? what caem ov err mee when iiiif ashdghdsg WWROTE THIIS?ss??? I wafhas I'm sorr eeee plaeess dont4 hATE MEEAAGHHGHH SHUDDUPLINDA// [[/footnote]] I want nothing to do with you.\n\nHere, I have [http://www.scpwiki.com/system:page-tags/tag/shark-punching-center#pages a list] of the harm SCP-SPC has caused - in plain sight, no less - from my gardener who says he's on a first-name basis with Q. Bear in mind the coded language - if you went to my seminar, you'll know. I'm not going over it again just for you.\n\nEspecially noteworthy is [[[SPC-169-J]]] - they ADMIT that they're attempting to seduce a 4,000-kilometer-long sea monster baby. Not even the laws of physics will stop these hopelessly sick-minded individuals from getting their perverted gratification.\n\n> **INTERVENTION LOG**\n> \n> **Potential Victim:** SPC-169-J\n> \n> **Date:** 9/2/2020\n> \n> **Location:** NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS, South Atlantic Ocean\n> \n> **Provided tools:** 3 megaphones, 1 capsule of Holistic Sea Monster Protection Medicine (Special thanks to the Dah-do corporation![[footnote]] {{you are welcome but dado stil not think this is being good idea but good luck any way (and it is spell dado)}} [[/footnote]]), HMS Potluck-at-Sea (Special thanks to Edgebrook Yacht Club!)\n> \n> <Begin log>\n> .\n> **Maureen W.:** You sure this is the place?\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Of course I am.\n> \n> **Hilda N.:** Because if the victim's not under us right now I'm gonna be so. Fucking. //Angry.//\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Hilda! Language!\n> \n> **Hilda N.:** (single shriek that lasts 34 seconds, followed by incoherent sobbing)\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Good point. I apologize.\n> \n> (Low, rumbling sound from under the waves)\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Goddamn it, Linda, you wanna argue //now?!// Of all times?\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Pretty sure we threw Linda overboard at--\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Sure, by all means, correct the //shit// out of me.\n> \n> (Low, rumbling sound, again)\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** LINDA I SWEAR TO--\n> \n> **Hilda N.:** It's the victim!\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Okay, all right, this is happening, uh... //places,// people!\n> \n> (Maureen continues through a megaphone)\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Hey, SPC-169-J? Can you hear me, Kayleigh? \n> \n> **Hilda N.:** That's not her name.\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Kayleigh, I'm //so sorry// that people are lying about your name.\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Focus, Reen.\n> \n> **Hilda N:** It's Skye. We agreed to call her Skye.\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Kayleigh, baby, listen: we're here to protect you from Bill Gates. You may not know who he is, but he's a very mean deep state person here to \"punch\" you, which means not actually punch you. But we're not gonna let him hurt you. Hilda, give her the medicine!\n> \n> **Hilda N.:** Here you go, Skye.\n> \n> (Hilda drops the holistic protection capsule into the ocean. Ten seconds later, a two-meter-long wooden rod is thrown onto the boat from the water level by a mysterious force.)\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Stick! Call the police!\n> \n> (Maureen picks up the rod, reading an inscription on the side: \"holi stick of awaken see monster by dado - hit a thing to use yes\")\n> \n> **Hilda N:** PUT IT DOWN! THAT'S HOW THEY GET YOU!\n> \n> **Maureen W.:** Not a chance, Hilda! Not when we're so close! \n> \n> (She strikes the rod against the guardrail. An otherworldly clanging sound resonates through the hollow rod, striking an unseen psychic chord with all the creatures of the deep, and for a merciful few seconds, the oceans are silent, as if to solemnly acknowledge what inevitably is to come)\n> \n> **Kevin M.:** Do that again and I'm telling the Yacht Club you're trying to sabotage the paint job.\n> \n> **[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-169 <UNKNOWN>:]** **These the wankers you was talkin' 'bout, Linda darlin'?**\n> \n> **Hilda N.:** //Explosive diarrhea!//\n> \n> **[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-169 <UNKNOWN>:]** **Get fucked, Yanks.**\n> \n> (Catastrophic marine seismic event, recording equipment is destroyed)\n> \n> <End log>\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
