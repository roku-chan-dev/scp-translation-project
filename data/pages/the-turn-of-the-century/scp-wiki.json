Watson which have been preserved from Her Majesty's Royal Foundation for the Study of Curiosities and Phantasmagoria and digitised. \n\n-- Maria Jones, Director, RAISA\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family:P22 Corinthia;\"]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ **Chapter VII**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> [[=]]\n> +++ **With Allies**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> I had never felt this mixture of excitement and anxiety before as I walked to meet up with Greene where her employees are. Frankly, I had doubts about her, which extended to her employers. Despite her intentions, I never trusted Greene in my heart, especially since she had stalked me before.\n> \n> When I first got there, Greene greeted me with a sly handshake and soon introduced me to the personnel, where I learned that they are called agents. They were sitting around a round table, already discussing plans, where I sat next to Greene. Once we are all settled, Greene filled me up with what they discussed before my arrival.\n> \n> Apart from the discussion of mass disappearance and the Cogwork Church, I myself was a popular discussion amongst the agents. For one thing, because of my shoulder prosthetics, I was connected to the Amoni rules that made me perceived Mekhanics the way normal individuals could not, whatever that is. Because of that, they made me a scout to carry out spy works against the Church and also distraction for the raid.\n> \n> For all of the experiences and events that have unfolded before my eyes, this mission will be the most challenging yet. I had already proven myself capable of gathering important information, although my stealth skills are often called into question. Even still, Greene and the others had hopes for me to successfully carry out the mission. I had doubts about the possibilities I had thought up and saw myself endured in such scenarios if I fail.\n> \n> The agents provided me a note and a pencil so that I could record any useful information, and also a rifle for good measure. Before we head out, Greene stopped me.\n> \n> \"And one more thing, Watson,\" Greene warned me, \"Do not confront the Church outright. We will take care of it. Be quiet, stay in the dark, promise?\"\n> \n> \"I promise you.\" I assured her with my heart.\n> \n> Greene nodded as they escorted me to the area where the Church are. We were three kilometres away from the warehouse where the agents watched out for obstacles before giving a go-head. I quietly walked to the back door as I looked back to the others before heading in.\n> \n> \n> \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family:P22 Corinthia;\"]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ **Chapter VIII**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> [[=]]\n> +++ **Against the Machine**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> Entering the warehouse via a back door was surprisingly easy enough, just as I gently opened and closing the door behind me. The insides are dark from my vision, with a slight glow from the other room the only light source I can see. I tip-toed towards the glow where I could hear my heart pounding. Once I got there, \n> \n> I counted twenty members left, most of them not looking well for a time like this. As I observed the members' behaviour a bit longer, I soon noticed their uneasy looks, even when accompanied by others. I supposed that, due to Schematist's avaricious and selfish goals he had been driven to the point of sacrificing even the most devoted followers. Now his followers were second-guessing their loyalty to the lunacy of that man.\n> \n> There were at least ten guarding the site while the rest scattered around the warehouse, carrying out their duties. I managed to navigate around the area while capturing what the Schematist and the followers were doing. They appeared to be performing a ritual surrounding some machine. I cannot express the heartache I felt watching one of the followers get thrown towards the mechanism despite their plead. At the same time, I observed the movement from the mechanism with morbid fascination. For one thing, there are gears coming out whenever it ate someone.\n> \n> Surveying the mech standing alongside Schematist, the mech itself had such strange structure, having four legs and eight arms respectively. Between the gaps, there was a sign of a skeleton inside it. Initially overlooked, I then recognised its sunken eyes and pale skin. There was something familiar about the corpse, as it looked like Moriarty, but I cannot be that sure.\n> \n> For a moment of studying the mech, there was already an error of its design. For one, there were numerous gaps within the layers of armour that served as a good weak spots to exploit. It also had jerky and fraught movements, expected from a corpse operating in a metal suit.\n> \n> Quietly taking out my rifle, I positioned myself to get a perfect shot, then waited for Moriarty to make an opening. As soon as the perfect shot hit, Moriarty screamed out in such a way that it send chills on my spine. I hesitated to make another shot without blowing my cover, but managed to make another one three times. Schematist and the followers are all confused by the commotion and it was only a matter before I realised they would search for the source of an intruder.\n> \n> I took it as an opportunity to cause distraction. And so, in a process of hiding away, also make some noises as possible to throw the people off-guard. My heart and mind pounding with excitement as I made another shot on the monster. But, despite my efforts, the people caught unto me and I was dragged to meet Schematist.\n> \n> Face to face with Schematist, he was surprisingly calm and collective as he wanted to have a chat with me. I decided to hear him out and had an opportunity to inquired about the cure for Sherlock's illness. Schematist smirked and told me that there was no cure for his illness. He also told me that, since I'm part of Amoni, I cannot die and have to live out the rest of my life forever.\n> \n> Since then, something inside me snapped. All I saw was red while I pushed Schematist with great forced to the machine. Everyone around me was shocked as I was, contemplating my rationality on the actions. That was when that I realised that all eyes are now fixed on me and I know they punished me for it. Fortunately, cavalry had arrived.\n> \n> \n> \n> \n> \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family:P22 Corinthia;\"]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ **Chapter IX**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> [[=]]\n> +++ **Victory Against the Church**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> In a moment I watched as the agents stormed through the entrance, managing to subdue the remaining church members. Greene met up with me and I told her everything. I expected punishment, but she reassured me, that they would do something about it later. I felt relieved but also scared of my immortality. \n> \n> As I was escorted back to Baker Street via a car, alongside the agents, I already thought about my mortality and how I could die. I knew right away that any blunt force trauma, including gunshots or decapitation would not be enough to end my life. I thought of any alternatives to combat this issue, then a solution struck me. Poison.\n> \n> When we were ten minutes away from Baker Street, I decided to talk to Clara about my death plan. Greene accepted my requests and ordered from the Foundation for the toxicologist to bring us the serum.\n> \n> The serum was a combination of three components: cyanide, arsenic and strychnine. This alone should be strong and lethal enough to end my life, according to the Foundation's toxicologist. I had high hopes of it working seeing as how it is our only option left.\n> \n> The toxicologist administered the serum in my veins and Holmes’ as well. We would now have to wait for some time until the symptoms began. I was a bit nervous, but not too much as I previously anticipated most of the symptoms the poisons had to offer.\n> \n> I am not sure if this could made me rest in peace, but I'll see.\n> \n> \n> \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family:P22 Corinthia;\"]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ **Chapter X**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> [[=]]\n> +++ **The Finale**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> \n> \n> It failed…\n> \n> The serum did nothing, not even showing symptoms within an hour. I received another dosage that was twice the size of the original and waited for another hour. As expected, nothing changed.\n> \n> \"It should have worked.\" The toxicologist panicked. I stared at my punctured veins with an empty feeling. The Schematist was right, I was a fool to think I won against him. He got what he wanted, and now I had to live out the rest of eternity.\n> \n> There was much discussion on what to do next amongst the agents, with most of them unable to find a good solution. Clara soon came up with a strange yet brilliant proposal. She proposed to send Sherlock and I to the non-dimension. From what I heard, non-dimension was another plane of existence where those who entered would be nullified.\n> \n> Her proposal was met with skepticism, but I agreed with that option and stayed firm to my decision. If this is how I shall die, then so be it.\n> \n> The higher-ups of the Foundation gave the agents approval to grant our wishes an hour later. They had the proper equipment needed to transport us to the non-dimension. I hope, by now, that this will be my final entry. I hope my wife will go on without me and not attempt to search for me. I hope the Foundation will give my regards to her. I love you dear, I always do.\n> \n> \n> \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"font-family:P22 Corinthia;\"]]\n> \n> [[=]]\n> ++ **Epilogue**\n> [[/=]]\n> \n> Dear Her Majesty's Foundation,\n> \n> First of all, I thank you for giving me time to write this letter before I departed from this world. With that, I also appreciate the Foundation for helping Sherlock and I take down the Broken God's Church. I hope my help and this journal are enough to repay my debt to the Foundation, as I presume this will be used for scientific research for years to come.\n> \n> I also want to give special thanks to Clara Greene. Under severe circumstances, you have proven yourself trustworthy and believing in me every step of the way. I thank you, Clara, for everything.\n> \n> Secure, Contain, Protect\n> \n> From,\n> Dr. John H.
