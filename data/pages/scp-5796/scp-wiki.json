All Foundation members are to remain unaware of the web address of SCP-5796, and any personnel without Level 4 clearance attempting to, or have already accessed SCP-5796 are to be reprimanded and punished. All testing with SCP-5796 must go through Site Director Amelia Werchester.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5796 is a dating website, named \"Soulmate Connection Program,\" that is exclusively accessible via Foundation servers. The site cannot be blocked or removed through any known means, including redirection. SCP-5796 generates dating profiles for all individuals affiliated with the Foundation, including D-Class personnel, humanoid anomalies,[[footnote]] With limited internet access. [[/footnote]] and the O5 council.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5796/soulmateconnectionprogram.png|caption=SCP-5796's logo.|width=200px]]\n\nThese profiles contain personal information, such as legal name, age, and gender preference, and are created without the knowledge of the individuals in question. However, the text style of the profiles is consistent with the manner in which the person would write.\n\nSCP-5796 is equipped with several features, such as a private messaging system, customizable profiles, and a site search function, which showcases a list of every Foundation site, with all employed personnel. Any personnel accessing SCP-5796 will automatically be logged in to their assigned profile, with no option to log out or delete their account. SCP-5796 does not create accounts for individuals who are in a relationship.[[footnote]] This excludes those in polyamorous relationships seeking more than one partner.
