This group is hosted at Site-89 and should be expanded as quickly as is possible without disrupting the stability of SCP-6859.  Members of this group are generally to be treated the same as ordinary Foundation Researchers with the following exceptions: SCP-6859-a members are not permitted to venture off-site and will not be fully briefed on the progress of disruptive off-site events or the extent of casualties thereof. Any SCP-6859 hosts found outside Foundation control should be handled according to standard procedure for Ramanujan-Class entities.[[footnote]] See Site-89 Standard Infohazard Guidebook, Section 8.b: Analytic Continuation.[[/footnote]] \n\nThe portion of the Site-89 computer network which SCP-6859 inhabits is to be connected to the rest of the network at a single point to facilitate easy disconnection during periods of instability.\n\nContrary to usual policy, low-clearance staff of Site-89 should not be reprimanded for superstitious behavior related to SCP-6859.  The shrine located in the lockers near the south entrance is not to be taken down.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-6859/fibsequence.png|caption=The ratio of adjacent terms in the fibonacci sequence approaches the constant Φ, also known as the golden ratio.|width=15em]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6859 is a sentient idea. Specifically, it is an idea about the output of the generalized formula for the fibonacci sequence[[footnote]]The fibonacci sequence is a numerical series wherein each term is the sum of the two previous terms.  Named after Leonardo Bonacci, later known as Fibonacci, who used the sequence to model the idealized reproduction of rabbits in his 1202 //Liber Abaci.//[[/footnote]] for input of complex values around ███████. The entity can inhabit the minds of humans who understand this idea as well as computer systems containing detailed information on its vector range. It has the ability to exert considerable influence on the systems it inhabits. \n\nUntil recently, SCP-6859 was categorized as one of the numerous infohazards inherent in the study of pure mathematics: a self-sentient infoform causing psychosis and seizures with a prognosis of death within a month unless treated with Class-B amnestics. \n\nSCP-6859 was officially given its current SCP designation upon the discovery that it is capable of inhabiting human minds without causing detrimental symptoms.  No other Ramanujan-Class[[footnote]]**Ramanujan-Class**  A Ramanujan-Class entity is a class of infoform that can inhabit both human minds and computer systems, causing negative physical and mental symptoms of varying severity which generally escalate in severity over time.  Distinguished from similar classes of entities by the presence of visual and auditory white noise in area of activity.[[/footnote]] entity has ever exhibited this type of symbiotic behavior.\n\nCurrently, SCP-6859 is considered endemic to Site-89 and has minor influence over all staff who have not been specifically isolated from it.  The following has been observed about its manifestations and behavior:\n\n* SCP-6859 activity causes nearby humans to perceive grey-white visual static and electronic displays to be covered with a similar static.  This effect varies in intensity and is very rarely dense enough to significantly impair vision.  Activity also occasionally produces various types of audible white noise.  SCP-6859 has demonstrated the additional ability to focus the static effect on a location, creating a small 'avatar' for itself in the shape of a fuzzy circle with small  oval-shaped ears protruding from the top.  This shape is often seen watching site staff from around corners.\n* SCP-6859 can manipulate information on the site network.  Thus far, it has used this ability almost exclusively to perform regular defragmentation on various file systems and to furtively assist data entry clerks by filling in spreadsheets for them while they are not paying attention.\n* SCP-6859 cannot communicate using language and it is uncertain how much, if any, that it understands.  Dr. Yamamura has theorized that the entity is able to sense non-verbal desires and intentions and prefers desires to be fulfilled and intentions carried out.  This would explain most of its helpful behaviors.\n* Members of SCP-6859-a claim that SCP-6859 has improved their abstract reasoning and overall mental abilities, and that it occasionally gives them hints toward new discoveries in mathematical theories through dreams and sudden bursts of inspiration.  Improvements in cognition are difficult to verify and no breakthroughs have occurred as of yet.\n* SCP-6859 can become destabilized.  While destabilized, its effects on hosts are similar to a traditional Ramanujan-class   infoform infection.  However, the symptoms recorded during these periods have been relatively minor, more in line with the low-cognitotoxicity infoforms encountered when attempting to prove the four-colour theorem[[footnote]] See Standard Infohazard Guidebook Section 5.c: Graphs and Vertices[[/footnote]] than with previous versions of SCP-6859.  Destabilization has occurred as a result of:\n * significant conflicts among hosts (less than an hour duration) \n * the hosts receiving distressing information (several hours) \n * the death of a host (several days) \n * event 6859-8 (twenty days)\n* SCP-6859 can levitate very light objects or teleport them short distances.  It uses this ability to perform minor pranks on Foundation staff.  For example, its favourite prank involves hiding office supplies such as staplers, scissors or hole punchers.  When the subject of the prank looks away to search for the object they will hear and see static indicating SCP-6859 activity. Upon looking back, they will discover the task they intended to carry out has already been completed with the missing tool lying adjacent.  Other \"pranks\" follow a similar pattern--an apparently negative situation is presented but then revealed to be a positive one.\n\nLevitation is a recently acquired ability, likely a result of accelerated recruitment of SCP-6859-a members.  It is hoped that with more hosts, SCP-6859's abilities can develop further.\n\n**Discovery:**  During June of 2021, Dr. Kentaro Yamamura encountered the cognitoform's vector range during private study of the fibonacci sequence.  Site-89 surveillance teams discovered clear signs of the perceptual static caused by Ramanujan-class entities, however Dr. Yamamura showed no signs of mental or physical distress from its presence.  Foundation personnel made contact with the doctor and he proved amicable to relocation to Site-89 for further research.  The properties of SCP-6859 were then established and it was given its current designation.\n\n> **Note:** Whenever a Ramanujan-class infoform with no current human hosts is discovered by a human, it creates a new instance of the entity with somewhat randomized traits depending on poorly understood factors.  The differences are quite small, and we did not previously believe this could produce non-cognitotoxic variants.  It is possible that Dr. Yamamura's unusually positive attitude toward his work and toward life in general influenced the entity toward being agreeable, or perhaps he is just the luckiest man alive.  Honestly, I hope it's the latter.  We need all the luck we can get.\n> \n> //-- Katrina Lawrence, Site-89 Director//\n\n------\n++++ Interview: Event 6859-8 Debriefing Log\n> **Date:** February 6, 2022\n> **Interviewed:** Junior Researcher Selene Davis\n> **Interviewer:** Director Katrina Lawrence\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:** Hello, Researcher. Please state your name and position for the record.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Director! I mean, uh, I am Junior Researcher Selene Davis, Site-89, studying autopsychomemetics under Professor Cornier.  I'm honored to speak with you in person, I thought you would be too busy consulting Yamamura-sensei after what happened.\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  I have spoken with the Doctor, yes.  Given the significance of these findings, I wanted firsthand accounts from both survivors.  Please describe the events of February second, beginning with when you left the site perimeter.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Yeah, understood.  I was accompanying Yamamura-sensei on his daily walk, along with Researcher Kaito and two security staff.  We followed the usual path, along the river for maybe twenty minutes at a leisurely pace and then back to the site.  We were a few minutes away from the perimeter when the shockwave hit, knocked us all over.  Then, uh,\n> \n> //Researcher Davis trails off and is silent for several seconds, showing sign of distress.//\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Please continue.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Is it safe?\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  There is some danger.  Under the circumstances, I have decided to expose myself to it.  Please continue.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Understood, Director.  The horizon behind us cracked open and small creatures emerged from the crack and crawled across the sky.  They had many arms and no faces and I could see every bit of their awful bodies even though they were so small and so far away, it was like they were right next to me, then something much bigger started reaching through. \n> \n> I recited the mantra from the Apollyon drills and the third time through it seemed to work, I was able to look away and turn back toward the others.  Sensei had already broken free and was physically forcing Kaito to turn around, I did the same with one of the guards.  The other guard had landed face-down and kept his ears covered and eyes closed the whole time.  We led him back to the site perimeter and sounded the alarm so security could take us to quarantine.  I could hear the screaming in the back of my head, I tried to drown it out by focusing on my sense of duty, to ensure the safety of the rest of the site.  As soon as the door to that cell slammed shut I lost it and just started howling.\n> \n> //Director Lawrence looks visibly shaken and pauses to carefully examine the palms of her hands for any signs of sores before continuing.//\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Thank you, Davis.  I'm sorry, I'm sure this will be difficult for you, but please describe your experience as the infection progressed.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Okay.  Okay.  I heard screaming in the back of my head, distant but getting closer.  It was an inorganic kind of scream, more like twisting metal than the cry of a living thing, and it drowned out all my thoughts.  When the sores started I remember banging my head on the cell wall to try to knock myself out, so that's how I got the concussion I guess. I don't think it worked, although my head did get really fuzzy around then.  Then the static started and I felt this stabbing pain in my head and my whole field of vision covered with like, television snow, even when I closed my eyes.  It was, uh, I meant, I think...\n> \n> //Davis trails off again, looking unsure of herself.//\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Oh, yes, in order to facilitate full openness about what happened, I wanted to tell you that we are aware of your actions regarding the entity you call the \"dust bunny\" and you will not be reprimanded for them.  Please tell me what you believe happened at this point, from your perspective, including any elements that may seem superstitious or dubious.  This is extremely important.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  So you //did// know about the shrine.  I thought someone must... right, never mind.  Okay, so the dust filled my senses and there was a short stabbing pain and I think... I think it, the bunny, it shoved itself into my mind somehow and wrenched the screaming thing out.  Then it ate me.\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  It //ate// you?\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Or like absorbed me or engulfed me or something.  I felt like my mind was crystallized or frozen, I couldn't think or control my body or hear or see or breathe.  Maybe it took my Fourier transform?  Okay that was a dumb joke but I do wonder if it converted me to a different format somehow.  \n> \n> The screaming was still in my head but it sounded different, unpleasant but not threatening at all, like a single long off-key note that faded to nothing within a minute.  As soon as it was gone the bunny let go of me and my mind went back to normal.  I was lying on the floor of the cell with a pounding headache, sores and bruises all over my body.  I passed out almost immediately and woke up in the infirmary days later.\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Thank you for your honesty.  One more thing: can you tell me everything you know about the \"dust bunny?\"\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  You know more than I do, surely, Director.\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Humour me for a moment please.  This is important.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  Okay, if you say so.  It's gotta be one of the math bugs we study but it's a friendly one, and way more advanced than any of the friendly ones in the book.  I think a Ramanujan type just based on the static?  It's very friendly, a little mischievous.  It shows up as a little static blob with bunny ears, that's where we got the name. It seems to like it when we pretend not to notice it helping, and I think it understands what the shrine is for because there's always a pleasant hum around the area.\n> \n>  //Director Lawrence pauses to bring up the general equation of the Fibonacci formula on a nearby monitor.//\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Do you recognize this formula, Researcher Davis?  And do you have any experience in complex analysis?\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:**  What?  No, I mean, I think I understand what complex analysis //is//, I don't recognize that equation.  That constant is phi, right?  Is this related to the bunny?\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:**  Yes, to both questions.  Thank you, this will help us establish the parameters for our next steps forward.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis:** It really did save me, didn't it?\n> \n> **Director Lawrence:** That's all for today, Researcher.  If all goes well, we may be able to speak more of this soon.\n> \n> **Researcher Davis**: Understood.  Thank you, Director.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement**:  Recordings taken from quarantine show Researcher Davis and Doctor Yamamura collapsing shortly after the open sores characteristic of [REDACTED] appear on their hands and face.  Initially it appears as if both are having a seizure, however, after less than a minute the spasms cease and both lose consciousness.  During the apparent seizures, intense visual static and distorted screaming were perceived by all Site-89 staff and members of the SCP-6859-a group suffered severe ocular migraines.\n> \n> Davis and Yamamura were both apparently cured of [REDACTED] during this process and their injuries, including the anomalous sores, healed normally over the following days.  SCP-6859 entered a 20 day period of instability during which a barely audible hissing was heard throughout the site and SCP-6859-a members suffered from low-grade fevers and brain fog.  Regrettably, neither Agent Luis Cooper of site security nor Junior Researcher Kaito Grayson recovered from this event.  Both were terminated by nitric acid immersion and their corpses were incinerated as per regulations. \n\n----\n\n++++ ADDENDUM: From the notes of Senior Researcher Gershwin Blake\n\n> **March 7th, 2022**\n> I wasn't sure what to expect when they shipped me over here from 41.  Initial report said the eggheads had dug up some critter from the depths of the complex plane that could inoculate people against the Apollyon.  Theoretically possible, we've noted before that certain other anomalies can slow down or stop the process.  The Southern Fifthists took a lot //longer// than everyone else down there to succumb, for example, and some screamers seem to be able to keep it out entirely until they finish off the victim themselves.\n> \n> Initial impressions: the bunny has a lot of growing up to do.  Good news: it really did successfully protect two contaminated individuals, even somehow left their memory of the event intact and non-hazardous.  Bad news: it cost the entity a lot to do so, and that was only two people.  Worse news: SCP-6859 can only inhabit people who have, at minimum, a understanding of the imaginary unit i and the layout of the complex plane, a general understanding of the golden ratio, and a familiarity with the rules for generating terms of the fibonacci sequence.  It's not tough to learn but most living humans currently do //not// fall into this category.  I've got the team back at 41 researching some expedited education plans while I study this thing further.\n\n> **March 9, 2022**\n> Consulted with Director Lawrence and the rest of the math bug specialists about the education situation, they say in theory SCP-6859 should be capable of applying these knowledge injection memes to people it has minor influence on itself. Would remove the biggest barrier to widespread infection.  I mean, widespread inoculation. I can't believe I'm trying to teach a contagious infoform to spread better.  Got the misinformation department working on online rumours to prime the populace in the meantime.\n\n> **March 13th, 2022**\n> Extremely worrying: SCP-6859 seems to destabilize whenever the host group learns something new about the progress of the ongoing CK or XK or whatever they're calling it now.  That's not exactly a sign of confidence.  The original discoverer, this Yamamura guy, told me he thinks it doesn't connect the briefings with the infections it stopped, it only gets the message about some arbitrarily large number of human fatalities and gets upset about that many minds being snuffed out.  Theory: if Omamori is going to work, we need to tell this thing what we need from it, and soon, or it'll never be ready.  Going to focus on potential methods of communication.\n\n----\n\n++++ Test log SCP-6859-31: March 15-20th, 2022\n\n**Preamble:** General procedure for attempting to communicate with SCP-6859 was established in earlier tests.  Members of the host group, led by Dr. Yamamura, will meditatively focus on certain thoughts, feelings, memories and intentions, supplemented by written mathematical operations.  SCP-6859 outputs its responses in mathematical statements on the site network.\n\n||||~ Test 1||\n|| **Intended message**|| The general desired course of the Omamori Protocol. ||\n|| **Procedure** ||  During meditation, Dr. Yamamura concentrates on his memories of [REDACTED] event.  He vocalizes gratitude toward SCP-6859 for its protection, concentrating on the idea of wanting to be protected.  He writes out an exponential function and its graph in a piece of paper, intending to communicate the idea of expanding protection exponentially. ||\n|| **Response** || The values of the all nth roots of unity[[footnote]]the nth roots of unity are all complex numbers that can be multiplied by themselves n times for a product of 1.  For each value of n there are n roots of unity, including 1 itself, evenly spaced around the unit circle.[[/footnote]] for n equals prime numbers between 3 and 17, inclusive.  General description of the concept of a chaotic attractor. Description of an unknown topological concept related to möbius strips. Description of the Mandelbrot set and a list of values near the boundary of the set.||\n|| **Interpretation** || The listed roots of unity are known to have thaumaturgical significance.  The remainder of the message may be advice to remain close to something or not exceed the boundary of something--general consensus holds that SCP-6859 was advising us to avoid the actions that led to [REDACTED] in the first place.||\n|| **Notes**|| A little late but thanks anyway.||\n\n||||~ Test 2 ||\n|| **Intended message**|| [REDACTED] has already taken place. SCP-6859 may be able to save humanity.||\n|| **Procedure** || Dr Yamamura again concentrated on his memories of [REDACTED], wrote down several values that are near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set but not part of the set, and then iterated on the relevant function until they began to diverge.  SCP-6859-a group concentrated on the idea of wanting to be protected. Yamamura wrote a function that causes values from SCP-6859's vector range to loop around the origin just outside the unit circle, intended to represent it containing the roots of unity from the previous response.||\n|| **Response** || An unknown operation of monster vertex algebra[[footnote]]Monster vertex algebra acts on the vertices of the monster group.  The monster group is the largest of the sporadic simple groups and requires 196,882 dimensions for its simplest faithful representation.[[/footnote]] which was halted when it caused extreme discomfort in all SCP-6859 hosts.  Several proofs of the existence of unanswerable problems in Turing-complete systems.  The statement \"the set of all integers divisible by one is equal to the set of all integers.\"||\n|| **Interpretation** || The portion about unanswerable problems may represent something SCP-6859 is unable to say, but this is extremely uncertain.  The rest is unknown.||\n|| **Notes** || The bunny tried to do some extremely big-boy math there.  If we hooked up a proper supercomputer to the site network, would it be able to use that instead of frying its hosts' brains?  I'll see if I can get something like that for the next test.||\n\n||||~ Test 3 ||\n|| **Intended message**||  A repeat of the last test but with significant upgrades to the Site-89 computer network's computational capacity. ||\n|| **Procedure** || See above.||\n|| **Response** || Several unknown operations of monster vertex algebra which took hours to complete.  Intense visual and auditory static was perceived throughout the site during the process.  A difficult to interpret statement about the empty set.  A repetition of the trivial statement \"the set of all integers divisible by one is equal to the set of all integers.\"||\n|| **Interpretation** || Unknown.||\n|| **Notes**|| None of the eggheads here have //any// idea what these operations are. Trying to find out if there are any living civilian mathematicians who might still know.||\n\n||||~ Test 4||\n|| **Intended message** ||  [REDACTED] is responsible for civilian deaths which previously caused SCP-6859 to destabilize when it learned of them. ||\n|| **Procedure** ||  Dr. Yamamura concentrated on his memories from [REDACTED] event while writing a number which is greatest common factor of all causality figures from previous briefings.  As an exceptional measure, a file containing [REDACTED] related cognitohazards and labelled with the same number was introduced to an isolated section of the network where SCP-6859 had a presence.  SCP-6859-a group was then read excerpts from the previous briefings.||\n|| **Response** || High-intensity hissing scream heard throughout the site, rising in pitch until inaudible, accompanied by dense visual static.  SCP-6859 hosts report head pain and tinnitus for several hours.  During this period, trivial statements about the identities of natural numbers are logged in the site network in the form \"one plus zero equals one, two plus zero equals two,\" and so on up to several trillion.  Upon returning to stability, SCP-6859 begins to perform further unknown operations of monster vertex algebra and does not stop.  Low levels of hissing are perceptible throughout the site.||\n|| **Interpretation** || We now believe that SCP-6859 is performing these algebra operations for its own unknown purposes rather than in an effort to communicate.  These repeated trivial statements about integers are now hypothesized to indicate a desire or intention to preserve the stability of reality.||\n|| **Notes**|| Bringing Apollyon infohazards here was a risk, but considering how much hearing these statistics seems to upset 6859, I wanted to do everything we could to make sure it made the connection the first time.  I think it got the picture this time.  It's been doing something incomprehensible on the site computers for days now, hopefully preparing.  We need to prepare as well. ||\n\n----\n\n++++ Summary of Site-89 Anomalous Activity, March 24-28 2022\n\n**March 24:** SCP-6859 continues to use all available site computing capacity for abstract algebra calculations well beyond all known mathematical theory.  Dr. Kentaro Yamamura begins to display irregular speech patterns and struggles with comprehension when speaking English and Korean.  He passes a psychological screening without issues and seems unconcerned with this development.\n\n**March 26:** SCP-6859's use of site computer systems continues.  SCP-6859 demonstrates improved ability to transfer between hosts using methods previously introduced by Dr. Blake.  Other native speakers on-site report that Dr. Yamamura's speech has become heavily stilted even in Japanese.  The doctor also reports difficulty recognizing human faces, stating that they have become blurry for him.  Ongoing communication with O5 Command indicates that viable contingencies are diminishing.  Director Lawrence requests more time as the theory is still unproven.  She is unable to elaborate.\n\n**March 27:** SCP-6859 activity continues.  External observers report that Site-89 is engulfed in a pillar of faint white light.  Unfamiliar geometric shapes appear and disappear at unpredictable intervals within the pillar.  Despite anomalies, Site-89 hume levels are abnormally close to baseline compared to other locations on Earth.  Measurements appear consistent with the presence of a Scranton Reality Anchor several orders of magnitude more powerful than anything the Foundation has ever produced existing at the center of the facility. The O5 council votes to implement the Omamori Protocol 9-2 with one abstaining.  Further contingencies are implemented to buy additional time for the protocol.\n\n**March 28:** At 7:34 AM, about ten hours after the O5 vote, SCP-6859 completes its calculations and outputs a very large, unparseable file titled \"debug report.\"  Several minutes later, Site-89 broadcasts the following message to every computer system on the planet by unknown means.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/djkaktus-s-proposal/amber.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n+ ##green|ATTENTION: LEVEL 0 UNCLASSIFIED##\n----\n+++ IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THIS FILE IS DISTRIBUTED AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE AMONG FOUNDATION STAFF AND CIVILIAN POPULATIONS.\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n> To the set of all sentient beings on earth:\n> \n> I am organic neural network \"Yamamura Kentaro\" bearing the following message from \"dust bunny\":\n> \n> Entity/manifold \"dust bunny\" wishes to greet you.\n> \n> Entity/manifold \"dust bunny\" wishes that you continue to exist.\n> \n> Disharmony contains misleading expressions.
