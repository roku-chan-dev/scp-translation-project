His coworkers teased him about his choices: \"Why're you reading that crap fantasy shit when you're surrounded by so much weird shit?\" But he enjoyed escaping into a world where he //knew// there'd be a happy ending. And hey! He had a pretty easy-going boss and he wasn't on the midnight shift like on his last assignment. So things were doing pretty good. Then the building shook and the klaxons went off.\n-----\n//turnpull//\nwidenessOUTloudness\nREDBRIGHTSHINE\n//rend//\nfreedom\n//rend//\ndrywetair\n//rend//\n//stretch//\n//stand//\n-----\nClem knew the drill: lockdown the containment chamber first, lockdown the observation room second, contact security and bossman third. One was easy, just a matter of hitting a button, but when he went to lock the observation room door, the damn lock wouldn't engage. He propped a chair under the handle as a stop-gap and went to the phone to call the boss when it rang under his hand.\n-----\nredloudfood\n//unfurl//\nlooksmell\n//shakeshake//\nlookdowninfant\n//pace//\nsmellnosmell\n//touch//\nairhardslick?\nmemory:gasgrassglass?\nlookinfanttalk:lookme\n-----\nClem noticed a motion out of the corner of his eye and turned towards the large observation window.\n\n\"Jesus fuck me!\"\n\nStanding on the other side was a... //thing// that looked like the bastard child of an orgy involving a yellowjacket and an octopus, with a little extra ugly for good measure. It had one of its... appendages on the glass and he could swear the damn thing was looking at him despite the one-way mirror.\n-----\ninfantgoodfollow\n//push//\nhungeropeninfant\nglasstalk:tastetouch\n//soften//\ngoodsmellinfant\ninfant:stayfeed\n-----\nClem scrambled to clear the chair from the door when the glass began to bubble and warp under the thing's tentacle-claw-leg-thingie. He had just pulled it free when the softened glass broke with a \"pop\" that he barely heard over the klaxon, and then shattered in its pane. He looked behind him and took a deep breath to scream... then smiled.\n-----\nstayfeedgood\ntasteinfanttouch\n//caress//\nsmellsweetsharp\n//twine//\nlooktouchtaste\n//tighten//\neatfoodcoppery\n//savor//\nsatiatefullnessdone\ncuriosityknow:smellexplore\ninfantgoodsmell\nfoodseekknow\n\n[[=]]\n**<<  Imago | [[[gdp2-freshbreath-inhale|BoFA: Inhale]]] | [[[gdp2-freshbreath-holding|BoFA: Holding It]]] | BoFA: Exhale >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
