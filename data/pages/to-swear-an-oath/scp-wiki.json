  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nI, being of solid heart and sound mind\nDo swear to be the one who stands alert,\nWho will persevere, sacrifice, exert,\nAnd give my all that I might serve mankind.\n\nI do accept that I will be a judge\nAnd a jury to them that I shall keep,\nBut not an executioner. Their sleep\nWill be safe from any hate, fear or grudge.\n\nI do accept that my life in the world,\nMy friends, and the freedoms that I once knew,\nAre gone, that I might know and keep respect\nWith solemn guarding of the truths unfurled\nFor me to hold. I will be wise and true,\n\nBy our mantra.\n\nI do accept my fate to someday die\nIn darkness that you may live on in light.\nAgainst corrupt and foul things I will fight\nTo collect and keep until end is nigh.\n\nI do accept that if I am corrupt,\nThen death may be unleashed on all,\nAnd that for my sins, judgment may yet fall.\nMy life may now but be yours to disrupt.\n\nI do accept there are forces at large\nLesser men sent out to destroy the strange  \nWho hunt to harm, to kill, and to dissect.\nWe will instead stand guard over our charge\nFor they are part of the world they would change.\n\nBy our mantra:\n\nSecure. Contain. Protect.\n\n//Formal Oath of the Foundation, first sworn in 1821 for the laying of the cornerstone for Site-1.//\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
