Following the return of the object, Class C amnestics are to be administered again.\n\nIf SCP-████ replaces its accounts, a remote access trojan installed on its remaining trusted individual's computer can be used to locate the new accounts. Due to the increased risk of SCP-████ ceasing contact with this individual, all interview attempts must be approved and Foundation involvement concealed from SCP-████. Following SCP-████'s physical containment, amnestics are to be administered to this individual.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=4 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=250px \n|url=brónachTwitter.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-████'s original Twitter account immediately prior to foundation contact.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-████ is an anomalous internet user possessing the ability to temporarily teleport and telekinetically interact with objects under ~6kg. SCP-████'s anomalous properties are activated when it is irritated by another internet user or automated process. The target's internet-accessible device will be temporarily teleported away or destroyed via brute force by telekinesis.[[footnote]]Occasionally, various other objects have teleported accompanying the devices.[[/footnote]]\n\n\nSCP-████'s IP addresses and cookies are traceable but come from non-anomalous internet-accessible devices located worldwide. These devices always differ and no connections have been identified. It has accounts on multiple services which it uses to interact with other users. These accounts have been replaced a total of 66 times in an attempt to avoid Foundation surveillance. Previously, it identified itself as Brónach ██████████ but now uses pseudonyms with no correlation. \n\nKnown services used by SCP-████:\n* GMail[Replaced 16 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n* --Facebook--[Deactivated and not replaced, 22/05/2016]\n* YouTube[Replaced 12 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n* --Minecraft--[Deactivated and not replaced,  25/01/2018]\n* Twitter[Replaced 14 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n* --Skype--[Account Abandoned, 14/8/2016]\n* Discord[Replaced 14 times, Most recently 28/12/2018]\n* --Epic Games--[Replaced 5 times, Deactivated and not replaced,  13/05/2018]\n* --Steam.--[Replaced 5 times, Deactivated and not replaced,  13/05/2018]\n\n\nSCP-████ created its first known account on 08/06/2009 but did not display anomalous properties until 03/01/2015. Circumstantial evidence points to this change being triggered by 3 days of absence from the internet between 31/12/2014 to 03/01/2015. The reason for its absence was described by SCP-████ as an event resulting in it \"constantly being watched\".\n\nThe full archive of all data taken from accounts connected to SCP-████ is available on request from Dr. Riley Ellis.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Documented SCP-████ Incidents Prior to Foundation Intervention\"]]\n\n\n||~ Date ||~ Cause ||~ Effect||\n|| 03/01/2015|| SCP-████ is repeatedly defeated in a game of Team Fortress 2 by the same opponent|| SCP-████ expresses anger through the in-game chat then the opponent's computer is teleported.

A discussion in the Discord server for the MineGambit Minecraft server had accused it of disabling the service via anomalous means. C-Class amnestics were administered to individuals aware of SCP-████ after the interviews concluded and a disinformation campaign of an anonymous DDOS attack was launched.\n\n**Addendum-2 Interviews:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Interview Log ████-13\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-████'s Discord account\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Riley Ellis, Level 3 Researcher\n> \n> **Foreword:** Initial contact attempted with SCP-████ over Discord. SCP-████ accepted the invite and responded immediately.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 25/01/2018>**\n> \n> **SCP-████:** Do I know you?\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** In all likelihood, no. I just have a few questions for you regarding the missing computers and server tower.\n> \n> **SCP-████:** Yeah... that was ████ty of me. I get frustrated and take it out on other people.\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** Can you tell me about the mechanism behind your ability to make objects disappear? Do the computers dematerialize or are you teleporting them elsewhere?\n> \n> **SCP-████:** teleportation. lemme show you.\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** A demonstration would be greatly appreciated as would your cooperation. \n> \n> [There is a considerable pause between SCP-████'s communications]\n> \n> **SCP-████:** wait...\n> \n> **SCP-████:** how did you ████ing find me here?\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** Pardon me? \n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** Are you still there?\n> \n> [Dr. Ellis's terminal is teleported, then reappears 3 seconds later to be destroyed via brute force telekinetically.]\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** The change in SCP-████'s anomalous effect is notable. Following this interview SCP-████ deleted and replaced all of its active accounts. New accounts were located via SCP-████'s panicked messages to a Discord group chat describing \"stalkers\" finding their old accounts. SCP-████ appears either knowledgeable about the Foundation or is mistaking Dr. Ellis for someone else.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Interview Log ████-14\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-████'s 2nd Discord account\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Riley Ellis, Level 3 Researcher\n> \n> **Foreword:** A GPS tracker was concealed within the computer used for the interview.

SCP-████ sent a private message to a trusted individual implying that he will recognize it and promptly deleted it. SCP-████'s new accounts were sent to said trusted individual in an anonymous message containing only a series of usernames.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Interview Log ████-45\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-████'s 14th Twitter account \n>  \n> **Interviewer:** D-534-332, 43-year-old White male.\n> \n> **Additional Party:** Trusted individual of SCP-████\n> \n> **Foreword:** Multiple attempts to coerce SCP-████ into teleporting a tracking device while impersonating a civilian failed. SCP-████ ceased contact with all but one trusted individual. This individual deleted and recreated his accounts alongside SCP-████. SCP-████'s new accounts were discovered through said trusted individual's computer via a remote access trojan. D-534-332 was sent in plain clothes to a Foundation-controlled apartment complex and instructed to insult SCP-████.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 31/01/2019>**\n> \n> **D-534-332:** Hey █████. \n> \n> **Trusted individual of SCP-████:** Oh no\n> \n> **D-534-332:** I'll kill you.\n> \n> [D-534-332's terminal is teleported.

Should a change be noted, the cave is to be closed off from public access while repairs are made. Any individual coming into contact with SCP-5584 requires a loyalty score of 95% or higher.\n\nA camera and alarm system are positioned outside of SCP-5584-1's reach within its chamber. --SCP-5584-1 spends approximately 23 hours a day sleeping so minimal observation is required.-- SCP-5584-1 requires no rest; should SCP-5584-1 attempt to enter a catatonic state, it is to be awoken immediately via the alarm.\n\n A whiteboard and an internet-accessible terminal with remote monitoring software installed are to be provided for communication and leisure. No audio surveillance is necessary. A single member of Foundation personnel with advanced experience in software development is to keep constant observation over SCP-5584-1's activities, switching out four times daily. The security personnel is to approve every action SCP-5584-1 makes on the terminal before a request is sent over the internet.\n\nIn the event this personnel becomes an instance of SCP-5584-1, backup incapable of reading --both English and Irish-- any language are to remove the original SCP-5584-1's terminal and whiteboard. The new instance of SCP-5584-1 is to be relocated and contained in a standard humanoid cell if possible, otherwise, the control room is to be retrofitted. The new instance of SCP-5584-1 will construct a word filter to prevent further transmission of the infohazard before regular containment returns.\n\nTwice weekly on Tuesdays and Fridays, SCP-5584-1 is to be visited by Dr. Izem for cognitive behavioral therapy. SCP-5584-1 requires no sustenance and is capable of the majority of its own self-care. It is to be provided with the following supplies each week:\n\n* 1 60mL bottle of shampoo\n* 1 80mL bottle of conditioner\n* 1 bar of body wash\n* 1 portable shower system\n* 500L of freshwater\n* 1 black whiteboard marker replacement cartridge\n* 7 60mg tablets of citalopram(One tablet administered orally once daily)\n* 7 100 mg tablets of quetiapine(One tablet administered orally once daily)\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=4 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px \n|url=cavefix.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Entrance to the cave SCP-5584 is located in\n]]\n\n**Description:** \nSCP-5584 is a carving in old Irish in the Ogham alphabet obscured behind SCP-5584-1[[footnote]]Carvings written up the natural corner edges of the columnar basalt[[/footnote]]. Any individual who reads and comprehends the meaning of SCP-5584 is theorized to be converted into an instance of SCP-5584-1. Due to SCP-5584-1's body obscuring the full carving and its refusal to share the original meaning, further testing cannot be performed and the risk of personnel becoming an instance of SCP-5584-1 is minimal. However, should SCP-5584's meaning be spread to individuals liable to share it or posted to the internet, the resulting disruption event would be difficult to contain and potentially worldwide.\n\nOnly part of one line is visible behind SCP-5584-1: the phrase \"NÍL A FHIOS AGA\"[[footnote]]Original carving written as \"᚛ᚅᚔᚂ ᚐ ᚃᚆᚔᚑᚄ ᚐᚌᚐᚋ\". Síneadh fada placed over the I in transliteration added by assumption from context.[[/footnote]]. The final word of SCP-5584's visible line is partially obscured but can be assumed as a prepositional pronoun. The sentence is translated as: \"(You/I/You all/We) don't know\".\n\nOnly one instance of SCP-5584-1 is currently known and thus this individual will be referred to as such. SCP-5584-1 is a 29-year-old human female identified as Brónach ██████████ fused to a wall in a concealed portion of Fingal's Cave on the Isle of Staffa, Scotland. It is attached by a web of flesh extending from the skin of its back. Its throat and jaw are split open and a large mass of approximately 200 tentacles extends from the hole. Due to the missing anatomy, SCP-5584-1 is mute. Its neck is broken and healed over, leaving it at an askew angle and severing its spinal cord. SCP-5584-1 cannot move or feel any part of its body from the neck down but has full control over the remaining parts of its face and the tentacles.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |click-fullscreen=--]\n|speed=4 \n|float=true\n|align=left\n|width=300px \n|url=tentacle.jpg\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=One of SCP-5584-1's tentacles with protractible tooth sockets visible.\n]]\n\nEach tentacle is between 3m to 4m long and 12cm to 20cm in diameter tapering to a flat paddle near the tip. Approximately 40cm down on each tentacle unilaterally is a row of 12 teeth that rest internally and can be protracted for use as weapons or to gain traction. Tentacles extend from the spinal cord located between the third and fourth cervical vertebrae.\n\nPeriodically SCP-5584-1 will attempt to enter a state of catatonia from which it is capable of telekinetic projection. It uses this to access the internet via unattended devices. This manifestation is hereby referred to as SCP-5584-2\n\nSCP-5584-2 can physically interact with and perceive its surroundings but cannot be perceived directly by others. If SCP-5584-2 is located within the 5-meter radius of SCP-5584 it is capable of teleporting where it pleases. If it has already teleported away from the range, it is only capable of teleporting back to SCP-5584. If SCP-5584-2 teleports while holding an object, the object will travel with it. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Documented SCP-5584-2 Events Correlated to Foundation Actions\"]]\n\n||~ Date ||~ Cause ||~ Effect||\n||31/12/2014||Foundation makes initial contact and begins securing site||SCP-5584-2 is absent from the internet for 3 days.||\n||03/01/2015||SCP-5584-1 watches camera installed in the north corner of the containment chamber then enters a catatonic state for the first time since the start of containment.||SCP-5584-2 teleports objects away from three internet users||\n||17/02/2015||Initial interviews with SCP-5584-1 is conducted by Dr. Mattias Brown following completion of site construction.||SCP-5584-2 returns stolen objects||\n||22/05/2016||Interviews with SCP-5584-1 by Dr. Mattias Brown conclude.||SCP-5584-2 teleports objects away from 1 internet user.

Amnestics were administered to all civilians who made contact with the SCP-5584-1. The Foundation secured the site 2 hours post-discovery under the guise of an injury taking place in the cavern and construction for a remote research post began. SCP-5584-1 displayed fearful behavior and attempted assault on Foundation personnel but no casualties were sustained. Assault attempts ceased on day 2 of construction.\n\n**Addendum-2 Interview:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+Interview Log 5584-01\"]]\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-5584-1\n>  \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Mattias Brown, Level 3 Researcher\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-5584 was provided with a whiteboard and 1 black whiteboard pen to communicate.\n> \n> **<Begin Log, 17/02/2015>**\n> \n> **Dr. Brown:** Hello SCP-5584-1, good to finally meet you!

Dr. Brown takes a few steps closer to SCP-5584-1 holding his hands up.]\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** Hiding this from us to breach containment behind Dr. Brown's back is inexcusable!

Do you think we're that //stupid//?!\n> \n> [SCP-5584-1 ceases attempts to destroy the computer and shifts its gaze between Dr. Ellis and Dr. Brown while producing gurgling noises.

The terminal is lifted telekinetically and thrown at high velocity at Dr. Ellis. Dr. Brown moves to Dr. Ellis and holds a hand up towards SCP-5584-1.]\n> \n> **Dr. Brown:** Please calm down! It's not worth it!\n> \n> **Dr. Ellis:** You... You think this is any way to prove you're fit to interact with the outside world unsupervised?! Even if you weren't a liability, even if you weren't //stealing// computers and vital hardware, you are acting like a //child// when we are just asking you questions!

Could you push the issue of lessening surveillance on SCP-5584 with Director Weber? Or get Dr. Ellis reassigned //at least//. My requests were denied going through the proper channels. Please, just anything besides being constantly monitored. Even an automatic word filter! Something that gives her the peace of mind that she still has SOME privacy. I can't imagine what it's like.\n\nDr. Mattias Brown\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Senior Researcher Mattias Brown\n**From:** Commander Verity Calvin\n**Subject:** Re:Concerns on SCP-5584 Containment Procedures\n[[/div]]\n------\nDr. Mattias Brown,\n\nThere's no chance in hell that that's getting through, Matt. People adapt to things, just give her some time and she'll come back to herself.\n\nI might be able to do something about Ellis. Everything else, though... I've got to be pretty far down your list of names. You're smart enough to know I don't have a say over this.\n\n-Commander Verity Calvin\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5583]]] | SCP-5584 | [[[SCP-5585]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** brónachTwitter.png\n> **Name:** Brónach's Twitter\n> **Authors:** Papercutieart, SUNCLOWNN, lemonspawn, and IronShears.\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://twitter.com/IronShears/status/1428896596549201924\n> **Additional Notes:** This image is a collaboration between all artists specifically created for this article. papercutieart goes by [[*user paperbackstab]] here!\n\n> **Filename:** Inside Fingal's Cave - geograph.org.uk - 270790.jpg\n> **Author:** Rob Farrow\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&atype=rich\n> **Source Link:** https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/321f2b28-09d3-4679-8320-096c4c8798a0\n\n> **Filename:** Eptatretus_stoutii_1.jpg\n> **Author:** Stan Shebs\n> **License:** https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Eptatretus_stoutii_1.jpg\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
