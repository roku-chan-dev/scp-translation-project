There were quite a few two-masted fifth-rate frigates built during the Anglo-Dutch wars, and most of the contemporary navies adopted frigates of various sizes. Additionally, privately-owned companies commissioned many of this ship type due to their versatility and manufacturing cost. \n\nWhile not nearly as suited to carrying cargo as their larger cousins, frigates were fast and maneuverable. Many were built as courier vessels and fast transit cargo carriers in addition to filling the roles of convoy protection and privateer. \n\nI remind you of this only to explain why identifying SCP-5862 based solely on her size and mast count would be virtually impossible. Not so much picking a needle out of a haystack as picking a specific needle out of a bundle of identical needles. \n\nAny identifying characteristics that were first built into SCP-5862-A have long since rotted away. Without the protection offered by deep water and silt, any wood from the 1600s would have experienced a great degree of erosion by nature herself. SCP-5862-A has obviously withstood far worse due to whatever contagion it is that afflicts her and her crew. \n\nA breakthrough came during one of SCP-5862-A's attempts to communicate with us. On May 20, 2012, one of the crew waved frantically at us for several minutes. We acknowledged their attempt to communicate by flashing the semaphore light several times. In response, the crew tossed a small case over the side. We retrieved the case via unmanned drone and it was sent to Site-86 for processing. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"■ Attachment 1 - SCP-5862_Case_contents.pdf, 12.1mb ■\" hide=\"□ Attachment 1 - SCP-5862_Case_contents.pdf, 12.1mb □\"]]\n[[div class=\"type1\"]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**H**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**K**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**F**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; width: 10%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Course**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; width: 12%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Heading**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; text-align: Left width: 63%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Remarks for Sunday, Sept 25, 1672**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]1[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]5[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: center; vertical-align: top; width: 5%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]218[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 10%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]NNW[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; border-right: 1px solid #666; text-align: left; vertical-align: top; width: 12%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]N[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #666; text-align: Left width: 63%;\"]]\n21st day out of port, and all is well.

As was stipulated in the agreement set forth between the Board and the erstwhile captain, we did such deliver a barge's worth of repair material to the region indicated in your last missive. To whit, 12 tonnes of hull planking, 4 shaped keel trunks suitable for a fifth-rate frigate, 14 trunks suitable for spar and beam, and 1000 yards of sailcloth. \n@@ @@\nAs requested, we lingered in the region in an attempt to contact the Captain to insure the shipment was sufficient to maintain them without the need for further privateering, but we were unable to locate them.

I think it is more or less impossible to track her movements across the seas. \n\nIt is interesting to note that the Commission decided at some point to \"feed\" the contagion aboard the //Voyager//. Without access to Trower, we may never know what the purpose was for such a move. Maybe it was out of a sense of guilt for what happened to Faulkner? It's also possible that the Board of Regents simply decided that \"feeding\" the //Voyager// was better than having it prey upon other ships. If giving Faulkner a bunch of spares was enough to keep him from sinking other ships, it was probably a win-win.\n\nI heard that you are looking into possible connections with [[[SCP-3862]]] as a potential avenue to developing an antigen. If this is indeed the same (or similar) disease, then I am grateful to Faulkner for keeping it off land for as long as he has.\n\nRegardless, it is my recommendation that we continue to follow the Commission's example in this. If we can't cure it and can't contain it, feeding it might be our only option.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nDr. Cezar Iliescu\nResearch Head, SCP-5862\nDept. of Nautical Anomalies\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 85%]]Act II: //Exierunt ut Vinceret// | [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/memoria-adytum In Memoria, Adytum][[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=cybersqyd and MalyceGraves]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** divider.png\n> **Name:** Decorations clipart divider\n> **Author:** Unknown\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** [https://ya-webdesign.com/image/decorations-clipart-divider/1574940.html YAWD]\n\n> **Filename:** print2.jpg\n> **Name:** A Frigate at Sea\n> **Author:** Pierre Puget\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** [https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/339658 The MET]\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
