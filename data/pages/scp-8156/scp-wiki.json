(Squad Atlantic-Eleven, 9 personnel) and Iota-10 \"Damn Feds\" (Squad India-Four, 16 personnel) are operating on field to ensure containment. SCP-8156 has been disclosed with additional staff stationed in the United States East Coast area and encouraged to report incidents with SCP-8156 to assigned personnel. Any isolated reports of persons riding whales or other marine fauna are to be forwarded to the current head of either MTF squads.\n\nFor naval deployment, MTF Gamma-6 ATL-11 is provided with two medium response boats (SCPS //Angie II//, SCPS //Esspy Sea//) and standard boating equipment, with addition of hydroponic microphones, deep-pressure suits, and physical and digital topographic maps of the North American Basin.\n\nAs of 3/11/2024, seventy-three (73) SCP-8156-A instances have been convinced into wearing geolocating tags and remain extant and located. Amphibious long-range tracking darts as an alternative are currently under development. [[size 65%]](See __[[[secure-facility-dossier-site-98|Site-98]]] Project File: //Taucherhund//__ for further information.)[[/size]]\n\n[!--WHAT TO DO--]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Ⅱ — 8156-Aphotic Protocol]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n+++ __8156-Aphotic Protocol__\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\nDuring regular SCP-8156 migratory activity, one medium response boat is to be deployed for active tracking of SCP-8156 and its projected course. Vessels are to be staffed by three personnel minimum. Assigned personnel may be deployed for up to seven (7) days contiguously before change of shift with other response boat. New vessel and crew must assume position over SCP-8156 before the seceding vessel can be relieved of duty.\n\nIn addition to tracking, deployed ATL-11 vessels serve as escort for SCP-8156 with the purpose of avoiding encounter with civilian vessels. Recreational, transport, and naval vessels are to be redirected under the pretense of one or more scenarios detailed in Cover Stories Indices USCG§1 \"Environmental Hazards\", USCG§3 \"Marine Wildlife\", & USCG§4 \"Marine Traffic\" where deemed applicable. In event of noncompliance by addressed vessels, ATL-11 has preemptive authorization for forceful non-lethal seizure of the offending vessel and may request reinforcements by additional Gamma-6 squads if necessary.\n\nIf visual, auditory, or radio tracking of SCP-8156 is lost, both SCP-8156-assigned vessels are authorized simultaneous deployment to relocate SCP-8156.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Ⅱ — 8156-Dysphotic Protocol]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n+++ __8156-Dysphotic Protocol__\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\nIn the event that SCP-8156 is found within 100 mi. (160.9 km) of the Eastern seaboard, MTF Gamma-6 ATL-11 is to inform MTF Iota-10 I-4 of potential incursion of SCP-8156. If in 24 hours (12 hours if seceding 8156-Euphotic Protocol) SCP-8156 has sufficiently redirected away from the Eastern seaboard, 8156-Aphotic Protocol is to resume.\n\nIf in 24 hours SCP-8156 continues inland, 8156-Euphotic Protocol is to be enacted. Coinciding with this MTF Iota-10 I-4 is to issue the necessary closure of urban ports and rural or suburban beaches in SCP-8156's projected path. Closure is to be publicly regarded under the pretense of one or more scenarios detailed in Cover Stories Indices USCG§1 \"Environmental Hazards\", USCG§2 \"Body Recovery\", & USCG§4 \"Marine Traffic\" where deemed applicable.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Ⅱ — 8156-Euphotic Protocol]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n+++ __8156-Euphotic Protocol__\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\nFor the duration SCP-8156 takes point on longshore, all civilians or unauthorized personnel are barred access to the coastline. Attempts to circumvent these restrictions on land or by water are to be countered by Iota-10 field agents and Gamma-6 ATL-11 crafts respectively. If a civilian is rendered a fatality by security or SCP-8156, their absence is to be suppressed or regarded under the pretense of being the subject of USCG§2 \"Body Recovery\" covers. Civilian fatalities will be subject to standard autopsy and disposed via cremation. Personnel fatalities are allowed internment in full accordance to their final testaments.\n\nIf SCP-8156 begins to retreat from the longshore, a potential lift notice for 8156-Euphotic Protocol will be addressed to all involved personnel. If SCP-8156 returns inland, 8156-Euphotic Protocol will be reaffirmed. If SCP-8156 has returned to being 120 mi. (193.1 km) or more away from the Eastern seaboard, a lift confirmation will be addressed and 8156-Dysphotic Protocol is to resume.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\nAs of 7/9/2021, Dr. Candace Abraves (Lvl. 3 Clearance) is the Head of SCP-8156 Research and Containment. Concerns regarding SCP-8156, its handling, or its assigned staff are to be direct to her via complaint forms. Assigned personnel are allowed and encouraged to report discomfort at inappropriate behavior SCP-8156-A instances conduct with them.\n\n----\n**DESCRIPTION:** SCP-8156 is a series of marine phenomena broadly localized to the northwest Atlantic Ocean, primarily within the North American Basin, with infrequent incursions upon the United States' eastern seaboard.\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[!--WHAT THE SKIPPIES ARE--]\n\n[[tab Ⅱ — SCP-8156-A (Physiology)]]\n++++ Ⅱ-Appendix 8156.Phy.6\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\n\n**__Physiology__**\nSCP-8156-A is the collective designation for approximately three hundred (300) humanoid entities ostensibly an infantry affiliating with the Union-era United States Army. Insignia and testimonies identify SCP-8156-A as the 3rd Eastern Shore Infantry Regiment, Army of the Potomac.\n[[footnote]] A volunteer infantry unit from Maryland. Entire unit disappeared May 1864 while initiating transfer to the Army of the Tennessee for the Atlanta campaign. [[/footnote]] Each instance is unique in appearance due to genetic traits, wardrobe, and physical trauma. Instances' clothing (consistent with United States Army uniform of 1860s) are of weathered quality, but the damage fared is lesser than what would be expected of their apparent age and exposure to the environment.\n\nSCP-8156-A are considered reanimated life under the pretense that they are unimpacted by what would otherwise be hinderances to biological functions. All instances' lungs and respiratory tracts are full of water. Respiration is emulated to conduct speech, but oxygenation of the blood is either not performed or unnecessary. All instances experience palpitations of the heart, with arrhythmia prevalent in most instances. [[footnote]]Notably, all band member's heartbeats are in unison with each other and their tune when performing.[[/footnote]] Instances circulate either blood or (in the case of several instances who have exsanguinated) ocean water drawn in from open wounds. Blood samples taken from SCP-8156-A are invariably contaminated. Wounds inflicted upon SCP-8156-A retaining blood heal and scar at a rate that is expected of non-anomalous humans when not irritated by ocean currents. In all instances, the tissue of open wounds are observed to not experience infection or necrosis. Instances commonly have some form of epibionts[[footnote]] An organism that lives on the surface of another living organism. An epibiont is, by definition, harmless to its host (contrast parasite). [[/footnote]] or parasites present on their bodies, clothing, and equipment.\n\nIt is presumed that if an SCP-8156-A instance is removed from water, animation of the instance will cease permanently.

Testimonies indicate a shared psychosis that: SCP-8156 is on land in the southeast United States; the American Civil War (with focus on Maj. Gen. Sherman's Atlanta campaign) is ongoing; the 3rd ESIR is in active service and en route to regroup with the Army of the Tennessee; terrestrial wildlife is regularly encountered by SCP-8156 in travel. Most if not all instances also suffer from extreme dyschronometria, topographical disorientation, post-traumatic stress disorder, and anterograde amnesia. Further delusions and disorders vary by individual. [[size 65%]](See __SCP-8156-A Psychology Record Archive__ for detail.)[[/size]]\n\nInstances are either ignorant or uncomprehending of the anomalous nature of their existence. Acknowledgements by SCP-8156-A of their situation indicates that instances perceive marine phenomena (including SCP-8156) as analogous to mundane terrestrial phenomena as understood by the 19th century. SCP-8156-A confronted with evidence to the contrary will respond with either mild acknowledgement, concern, amusement, defensive aggression, or complete disregard.\n\n__//Notice://__ Instances may recant previous statements and agreements despite earnest shown in original testimony (ex. numerous instances have been known to remove their and others' geolocating tags, denying ever accepting them, and making disparaging comparisons to slave tags).\n\n__//Notice://__ Several SCP-8156-A instances are prone to comment dated opinions and misconceptions regarding race and gender, including usage of slurs. Assigned personnel are allowed and encouraged to report discomfort at this behavior to supervisors.\n\n**__Activity__**\nSCP-8156 exhibits three patterns of activity which it switches between irregularly.\n\nThe Aphotic patterns (further divided as Aphotic-March and Aphotic-Camp) is the SCP-8156-A's docile phase and comprises the overwhelming majority of SCP-8156 activity.\n* In Aphotic-March pattern, SCP-8156 will traverse ocean floor in military step. Organization of SCP-8156-A is roughly uniform with proper grouping of units and line formation, but inconsistent in positioning of unit types and leadership. Most commonly SCP-8156 will be lead by either SCP-8156-A001 or SCP-8156-A043 and the military band. If SCP-8156-A are separated from the main formation will attempt to rejoin formation. Disruptions in formation will often not be rectified. SCP-8156 will leave Aphotic-March pattern to enter either Aphotic-Camp or Euphotic patterns. These migrations can last anywhere from forty minutes (40 min.) to thirty-eight days (38 dy.)\n* In Aphotic-Camp pattern, SCP-8156 will unload SCP-8156-C2 and settle in camp behavior. Majority of SCP-8156-A will stay at the encampment for the duration of the pattern. Despite no necessity to, teams of SCP-8156-A will: depart on excursions from the encampment to hunt marine wildlife for food and resources, with as many as 40% of SCP-8156-A departing; emulate sleep schedules with assignment of night watchmen, without coincidence with the day cycle. These settlements can last anywhere from five hours (5 hr.) to twelve days (12 dy.)\n\nThe Euphotic pattern is the SCP-8156-A's hostile phase, and provides the highest threat of civilian encounter.\n* During a Euphotic event, SCP-8156 will position itself on the shoreface 200-300 meters from foreshore. SCP-8156-A will equip SCP-8156-B1 and assume line formations to perform volley fire, indiscriminately firing SCP-8156-B2 out of the water. SCP-8156-A will not attempt to advance on land,[[footnote]] Even if presented with a tactical victory. [[size 65%]](See __8156-Experiment ██/██/20██ \"War Reenactment\"__.)[[/size]] [[/footnote]] SCP-8156-A001 invariably decides to retreat and SCP-8156 may reengage separate points along coastline. These engagements can last anywhere from two to eighteen hours (2-18 hr.), and on average occur twenty to thirty times a year (x̄=20-30ε/yr.)\n\nThe SCP-8156-A band members will invariably use SCP-8156-C1 to perform during Aphotic-March pattern, and regularly performs during Aphotic-Camp and Euphotic patterns. A majority of performances consist of \"Union Dixie\" (1860s), but the band's repertoire includes additional pieces including \"Lorena\" (1856); \"Battle Hymn of the Republic\" (1861); \"Tenting on the Old Camp Ground\" (1863).\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n\n[!--WHAT THE SCIPPIES HAVE--]\n\n[[tab Ⅱ — SCP-8156-B through -E]]\n++++ Ⅱ-Appendix 8156.Inv.5\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\n\n**__Inventory (-B & -C)__**\nSCP-8156-B and SCP-8156-C is the collective designation for SCP-8156-A's arsenal and miscellaneous inventory respectively. Objects are resistant to erosion, and almost all mechanisms retain function in spite of hinderances expected by SCP-8156's locale.\n: __SCP-8156-B1__ : Various firearms, Union military issue. ≈200 musket rifles, ≈120 sidearms. Oldest weapon identified as Deringer M1817 rifle manufactured in 1839, and most recent weapons consisting of Allen & Wheelock M1861 revolvers. Customization is present in roughly 45% of rifles. Most apparent anomalous properties are the creation of SCP-8156-B2, and inability to function when outside of saltwater.\n: __SCP-8156-B2__ : Ball projectiles fired from SCP-8156-B1. Created from debris loaded into chamber, most commonly cowrie shells or pebbles. Radiograph imaging of SCP-8156-B1 firing shows that creation of SCP-8156-B2 occurs within five milliseconds (5 ms). Topography of SCP-8156-B2 becomes spherical while accelerating down the barrel, and retains shape after fire.\n: __SCP-8156-B3__ : Bladed weaponry. 12 swords, ≈80 bayonets, ≈300 Bowie knives and Arkansas toothpicks.\n\n: __SCP-8156-C1__ : Military band equipment. 30 items; 23 wind, 7 percussion. All instruments constructed in early 1860s, Boston. Manufacturer identified, confirmed defunct and having no known association with [[[SCP-332|paramusical congregations.]]]\n: __SCP-8156-C2__ : Wooden wagons, Studebaker manufacture. 2 canvased horse-drawn, 3 open-air hand-drawn. Utilized for transportation of supplies. Drawn by SCP-8156-D4 through D7; SCP-8156-A infantry. All tagged for ease of tracking central of SCP-8156.\n: __SCP-8156-C3__ : Camping supplies and other equipment. Either Union Army issue or resourced from Atlantic flora and fauna.\n[[size 65%]](For a more comprehensive list of SCP-8156 inventory, consult documents in __SCP-8156-B Inventory Archive__ and __SCP-8156-C Inventory Archive__. For extensive study of SCP-8156-B2, consult __SCP-8156-B Ammunition Records__.)[[/size]]\n\n**__Cavalry (-D & -E)__**\nSCP-8156-D is the collective designation for seven equine entities utilized by SCP-8156-A for cavalry and cargo transportation. Instances' morphologies are identical to that of standard domesticated horses (//Equus ferus caballus//, Morgan breed) aside from the shared mutation of all instance's hooves being reversed at the pastern, the toes facing the posterior. The healing of wounds found in SCP-8156-D are for all intents and purposes identical to that seen in SCP-8156-A. All instances have a history of leg injuries,[[footnote]] Attributable in part to the traversal of uneven ocean floor. [[/footnote]] but have not experienced infection or been rendered immobile due to discomfort expected by faring such injuries.\n\nOf note are two SCP-8156-D instances:\n__SCP-8156-D1__ : \"Chesapeake\", male, cavalry. Specimen is coextensive with SCP-8156-A001 due to overwhelming epibiont presence [DATA EXPUNGED] unable to dismount.\n__SCP-8156-D5__ : \"Pallbearer\", male, transport. Only exsanguinated SCP-8156-D instance. Open shark bite wound, right barrel; fractured proximal phalanx, front right; fractured medial phalanx, back right. If further injury renders the specimen immobile, preemptive authorization has stated SCP-8156-D5 be remanded for autopsy.\n\nThe designation SCP-8156-D8 is reserved for the referral of a hypothetical SCP-8156-D instance //separate from// SCP-8156-E. Use of this designation in reference to SCP-8156-E is discouraged for sake of clarity and must not be used in documents. [[size 65%]](See __SCP-8156-D Cavalry Archive__ for full record.)[[/size]]\n\nSCP-8156-E is an female whale shark (//Rhincodon typus//), presently considered non-anomalous. SCP-8156-A identify SCP-8156-E as a horse of notably docile temperament, despite the evidence to the contrary. SCP-8156-A003, the rider of SCP-8156-E, specifically identifies the specimen as \"Radishes\", a mare he had raised from foalhood. Whether there was an SCP-8156-D instance named \"Radishes\" prior to discovery of SCP-8156 has not been ascertained. While under observation, personnel had described SCP-8156-E's behavior as \"tamed\" or \"domesticated\". As of 11/25/1996, SCP-8156-E and SCP-8156-A003 are uncontained. [[size 65%]](See documents pertaining to __Incident 8156-1996-B__.)[[/size]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n----\n**HISTORY:** The 3rd Eastern Shore Infantry Regiment (3rd ESIR, officially the 3rd Regiment Eastern Shore Maryland Volunteer Infantry) was organized November 1861 in Salisbury, Maryland. Along with the 1st and 2nd ESIRs, the 3rd ESIR was attached to the Army of the Potomac initially under the division of Maj. Gen. John Adams Dix. Position of colonel was appointed to Homer Brighton, who had served in Salisbury as a firefighter since 1853. The 3rd ESIR saw several transfers during the American Civil War, including transfer to the Army of the Tennessee for the Atlanta campaign.\n\nThe entirety of the regiment was last seen May 10th, 1864, departing to regroup with the XVI Corps in Chattanooga, Tennessee. The regiment's failure to report under Brig. Gen. James C. Veatch led the regiment to be declared deserters by Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson. Due to the circumstances of their absence, President Abraham Lincoln pardoned the regiment and issued the Pinkerton Detective Agency to launch an investigation into the 3rd ESIR's disappearance, which was closed in 1867 without any findings. All members of the 3rd ESIR have officially been ruled dead in absentia by the United States federal government. [[size 65%]](See __PNDA Case#1259 \"Disappearance of 3rd Eastern Shore Infantry Regiment\"__ for further detail.)[[/size]]\n\nWhen SCP-8156 became active or if it definitively is the 3rd ESIR is unverifiable. The earliest activity of SCP-8156 is presumed to have been the \"Cowrie Boys killing\"; a 1901 murder case wherein two children from Yarmouth, Nova Scotia were found dead on a beach. Local media and coroners reported several wounds that had the bullets removed and replaced with cowrie shells. Across the following fifty years, at least five newspaper mentions were made of similar incidents across the eastern seaboard involving the death of seabirds, and in one instance, a vagrant in Georgia.\n\nSCP-8156 was not recognized by the SCP Foundation or given SCP designation until 1963. On June 27th, 1963, a squad of Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 was dispatched 40 miles off the coast of Wilmington, Virginia, to investigate claims from civilian scuba divers of finding underwater footprints. SCP-8156 was encountered without casualty. [[size 65%]](See __Incident Report IR-8156-1963-A__ and related documentation for further detail.)[[/size]]\n\nThe SCP-8156 pattern of activity was adequately identified following a three-year observation period, prolonged due to limited maritime resources by the Foundation and now antiquated technology from the era. SCP-8156 has retained classification as Keter since assignment on October 1st, 1963, as well as Caution Disruption and Vlam Risk since the implementation of the ACS System.\n\nUse of geopostioning technology for tracking SCP-8156 began in 1978 following the launch of the CLS/Argos satellite system. While quality of tracking devices have improved over time, difficulties in keeping SCP-8156-A from removing trackers off their persons have been constant. Development of trackers for SCP-8156 has prioritized being of reliable range, unintrusive for SCP-8156-A, and cost effective. Use of darts in other Special Containment Procedures show prospect, but have not been conducted for SCP-8156 outside of tracking for SCP-8156-C2; there are recognized challenges of isolating and embedding darts into SCP-8156-A so as to not draw hostility from numbers that could overwhelm personnel or ruin relations with SCP-8156-A as a whole.\n\nSince cataloging of SCP-8156-A began, a total of 34 instances have been lost and not recovered in an extant state. Only one neutralized instance has ever been recovered.

Joseph Cavell regarding service on 7/27/1963. Cavell was the field captain in command of a detachment of Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 \"Dry Docks\"[[footnote]] MTF Gamma-6 operated with the codename [[[SCP-2120|\"Dry Docks\"]]] from its formation in 1941 until restructuring in 1985 as \"Deep Feeders\". [[/footnote]] operating from a //Point//-class cutter. Cavell was accompanied by by Γ-6 Sgt. Orville Greene; Γ-6 Pvt. Bastien Babin; Γ-6 Pvt. Walt Brenner; Jr. Res. Ivan Kovacic.\n\nTranscribed from original document //sic erat scriptum//.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"border:1px solid black\"]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\n\nSat. July 7, 1963\n\nThis is Captain Joe Cavell writing. For today's mission I was called in to take Junior Researcher Kovacic to check reports by a civilian diving tour. Divers said since Wed. they found footprints in the sand. Some saw people walking around Friday.\n\nI took Orville and two of the new boys, Brenner and Babin, and we set out from Wilmington at 0800 to the tour route.\n\nAt 50 mi. out, Brenner, Babin and I suited up for searching the sea bed 20 ft. Orville and Kovacick stayed on board to keep eyes and ears. Sand was empty escept for dinky little kelp patches novices would throw money to look at.\n\nIt was nothing until Orville picked up something on the boom mike coming north. It was too muddy for Kovacick, but Virginia boy he is, he recognized it as Dixie right away. I called us back on board to start boating after it and yup it was Dixie alright. It could've been a cognitive hazard, but it seemed we were getting closer to something as it got all clear on the tape the sound of the chorus, brass, drums, all singing about Uncle Sam. It was a few miles more until we found our skip. The J.R. was so caught up in the song, when we picked up talking, not singing, the kid almost ripped his head off throwing his headpiece away.\n\nSounded like there were several of them, so I flicked sonar on. Counted eight human-sized entities walking on the sea bed, two on horseback from the looks of it. We grabbed our gyrojets and went down when the leader was telling the others to \"help them tie down\" and they went under the cutter.\n\nWe made visual and it matched the sonar. They were all dressed Civil War era like the North, blue suits but filthy. Two were on horses, both fairly decorated. All of those things were going around like they werent 40 feet below ocean. The ones that weren't trying to grab the mike saw us too, and started talking to me. I knew we were dealing with morons when they were saying our boat was a hot air balloon. One of the horsemen (a colonel it said) expected we were \"The Ballooners\" or other.[[footnote]] The Union Army Balloon Corps was an eight-person branch of the Union Army that performed aerial reconnaissance. Disbanded August 1863 with the resignation of Thaddeus S.C. Lowe. [[/footnote]] If these things are trying to be people and think scuba men falling from the sky is normal, they either know the veil's a sham or they don't know what the veil is.\n\nEach of the anomalies were armed with one of those old powder rifles. I figured there was a good chance they might work in this craziness and we would be out numbered, so I authorized Kovacick to call for extraction and tried to keep the anomaly passive. The colonel invited Brenner, Babin and I back to their camp in what looking back seems to have been a genuine act of hospitality but regarded then as a potential demand. We complied until backup's arrival, and provided our names in part as \"Joe, Bass, and Wally\" when prompted.\n\nThe anomalies escorted our team just under two miles east to a camp of about a hundred or two of similar entities. They had tents and even some horse drawn carriages A military band was siting on a bunch of rocks playing Dixie the whole time were were there. Had to stop the footmen from trying to tie the boat down with their horses. Brenner made quick thinking saying we had it roped with our air tubes and the morons bought it.\n\nThe colonel and his lieutenant called us over around a campfire that sure as shit wasn't burning. Coral, not firewood. The lieutenant got off its horse, but the colonel didn't. Don't think they could it had a bunch of coral growing on the both of them. The thing just sat down. They seemed to recognize that I was the head of our group. Made some chat and threw some questions at each other.\n\nThe colonel asked if where we set off from and where the nearest settlement was. I provided them with a fake name for an Appalachian town because didn't want to send them over to Wilmington.\n\nTwice the colonel asked which way the Savanna goes, and I pointed due east both times. The first time it took the answer, but muttered about getting turned around the second time. This and how they wobbled to their camp, I don't think these things have a good sense of direction.\n\nIt was Babin who started to address the elephant in the room and asked what it thought of the ocean. The colonel then began to talk about growing up at the coast outside Salisbury and it loved to fish as a kid. Said it missed it and wanted to come back after the war. We eased it into furthering upon the war, and it seamed to be Civil War it was talking about. Said they're headed to Atlanta to group under someone named Veech.\n\nFrom the sound of it, they were a part of General Sherman's campaign in the south. Told some other accounts of \"the war so far\", from somewhere in the Seven Day Battles to claiming to have just fought under Meade and Grant in the Wilderness. The story telling was a bit messy, but accurate to what I remember, minus the Indians.\n\nLuckily extraction came at supper time, and better yet they didn't force us to stay. Drowning aside, I don't think I would've survived if those things made me eat from their supply of God knows what. Their \"beans\" was an open tin can of rot with a small fry picking at it. I think the sight of that one-eyed kid taking a spoonful will stick with me until the weekend.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Incident Report Summaries (Abridged)\" hide=\"File accessed - Contact RAISA for complete records\" hideLocation=\"both\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black\"]]\n[[div style=\"color: white; background: #64030F ; padding: 10px;\"]]\n++ Incident Report - IR8156-1965V\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 10px;\"]]\n**Date:** June 8th, 1965\n**Time:** EST\n**Location:** Atlantic Ocean; ≈15 mi. east of City of Virginia Beach, Virginia, USA\n(Circa. 36.80 °N × -75.70 °W)\n[!-- 36.79790531031475, -75.70090856139606 --]\n**Involved Team(s):**\n* Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 \"Dry Docks\"\n**Preface:** Profile of SCP-8156-A's behavior was under development, and SCP-8156 was regarded as a poorly-documented anomaly with need for caution and distancing.\n\n**Summary:** //Point//-class cutter #65054 (Γ-6 Hudson, Γ-6 Peterson, Γ-6 Strew) intercepted and attempted redirecting civilian private yacht //Aquamarine// from course towards SCP-8156.

Caucasian with brown hair and hazel eye color. Decedent was in advanced state of decomposition, most apparent being the rupture of abdominal cavity and near total maceration of the skin.\n\nDecedent was recovered from a fishing net at approximately 06:00 EST, pulled from ocean water with a load of Atlantic cod (//Gadus morhua//). Physical observation of decedent indicates he has been deceased for six (6) to eighteen (18), but was animate upon capture in the net. Extensive injury and degradation of the body has occurred, including but not limited to:\n\n# Abrasions from fish scales and fins.\n# Disembowelment through hole in abdomen. Majority of intestinal tract eviscerated, remnants and mesentery putrefied. Eighth through tenth ribs exposed.\n# Perforations to chest. Second and third ribs exposed under right armpit. Fifth right rib broken in posterior, exposed in wound lateral to the spine\n# Left forearm severed, majority recovered alongside main cadaver. Fourth and fifth fingers not recovered. Carpal bones, radius, and ulna exposed.\n# Right arm heavily necrotized. Half of phalanges absent, remaining partially exposed.\n# Penis and scrotum absent from decay. Portions of bulbospongiosus muscle and urethra intact.\n# Heart, bladder, stomach host to extensive bacterial colonies. All species identified have been marine microorganisms endemic the Atlantic Ocean.\n# Lower jaw detached during recovery. Mild malocclusion prevalent, all wisdom teeth and lower incisors absent.\n\nIn isolation, the cause of death could not be conclusively attributed to any injury or illness. When considering the circumstances of recovery, spontaneous death and rapid decomposition upon removal from the water is the prevailing theory.\n\n**Inventory:**\nSCP-8156-A302 was clothed with the following\n# Kepi hat, customized. Originally Prussian Blue, stained black. 40cm deceased sea cucumber affixed over kepi, bound and styled in manner reminiscent of coonskin hat.\n# Dress shirt. Originally white, dirtied. Button, tears in armscye; lateral of spine, repaired with red thread.\n# Frock coat. Prussian Blue, majority stained to some extent by various biological substances. Absent of ranking chevrons or epaulettes. Five buttons missing (1 torso, 1 left cuff, 3 right cuff), remaining buttons corroded with embossing illegible. Wool threads used in repair. Right cuff, left lapel, threading frayed. Small hole in left breast pocket; right sleeve; lateral of spine.\n# Sword belt. Belt buckle frame warped, prong rusted in place. Scabbards for Bowie knife and light artillery sword. Stitching repaired with linen thread.\n# Trousers. Sky blue, faded and muddied. Holes worn into knees, pant cuffs frayed.\n# \"Jefferson Davis\" boots. Faded black, rough-side-out. Hobnails and heel irons heavily rusted, remain intact. Most heavily worn at soles and toes.\n\nThe following items were found on SCP-8156-A302's person.\n# Bowie knife. Scabbard included. Blade dulled.\n# Enfield P1853 rifled musket. Bayonet included. Seaweed wrapped several times around barrel, forearm and bayonet. Ramrod unrecovered.\n# Circular canteen. Wool cushioning muddied. Cap sealed by coralline algae.
