  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n**Act 2:** This act takes place over an indefinite period of time following the events of Act 1 - somewhere around three to six months, give or take as needed for the purposes of story.\n\nThe situation is grim: a major attack on a Foundation Site by a previously unknown force has caused a major containment breach. Dozens, if not hundreds, of SCP artifacts have been released. Other occult organizations, upon seeing these events, are moving in. And to make matters worse, a few of the SCPs in question have their own agendas as well. . .\n\nThe theme for Phase 2 is **CONTAIN**. As opposed to Phase 1, which was about securing the Foundation from an attack, Phase 2 is focused on SCPs in the wild. A few story ideas:\n* MTFs capturing escaped SCPs.\n* Agents investigating the group that attacked the Foundation and who was supporting them.\n* SCPs fiendishly plotting to stay away from the Foundation and carry out their own evil plots.\n* Members of other organizations coming into conflict.\n* Repercussions of the worst attack on the Foundation in known recorded history.\n\nDrawing from the lessons of Act 1, Act 2 will be more tightly organized than Act 1 was. Instead of a single long storyline that anyone can edit, Act 2 will be divided up into several self-contained short stories. This should keep things more easily readable, as well as allowing for individual short stories as well as collaborations. Also, it should allow for more freedom in how stories get written, as opposed to being limited to the logs and transcripts format.\n\nThis page here will serve as an index and reference for the Phase 2 storyline, including a rough timeline and index by storyline.\n\nFinally: there is no \"approved writers\" list for Game Day Phase 2. Anyone and everyone should feel free to contribute to this as a writer: however, the normal rules for story deletion (deleted at -10 votes) still apply.\n\n+++ We now have a chatroom: #scpgameday on SynIRC\n\n-----\n+ TIMELINE OF EVENTS\n(Feel free to edit this as individual short stories get written).\n\n* **Day -???:** [[[SCP-953]]] attacks \"YiffCon ████,\" killing ███ attendees.
