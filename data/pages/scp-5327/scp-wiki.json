As predicted, the effects of the metamorphosis of the cultists were completely undone by Protocol KAIROS. All of them had their memories of the event completely wiped by the ritual with no side effects.\n\nThe protocol has been proven to be a reliable way to undo every effect of the anomaly. Sadly, it looks like it's not an everlasting result. As informed by Dr. Michaels, KAIROS created a seasonal loop that has to be annually managed.\n\nWe haven't neutralized SCP-5327 but transformed it. I'll study to improve the protocol for next year.\n\nYours truly,\n\nJunior Researcher Misty Hastings\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 5327\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= safe\n|secondary-class= none\n|disruption-class= keneq\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n------\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5327 is to be allowed to progress until May 1st when Protocol KAIROS is to be initiated to restart the loop.\n\nSCP-5327-C events are to be covered with misinformation and amnestization of witnesses during the time between November and May. As all remnants of SCP-5327-C will be erased by SCP-5327-B at the end of Protocol KAIROS, including the victims' memories of the event, there is no need for other procedures.\n\nIf the loop is broken or any trace from SCP-5327-C is left behind, Mobile Task Force Eta-77 (\"Spheres Within Spheres\") is to be mobilized to control the situation.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=Ceridwen.jpg\n| caption= Artistic depiction of SCP-5327-B.\n]]\n**Description:** SCP-5327 is a ⚳θ-Class Scenario Loop[[footnote]] θ-Class Scenarios are events caused or suffered by or because of a deity.[[/footnote]]^^,^^[[footnote]]A Ceres Theta Scenario is an event that occurs reliably with a deity on certain dates or seasons.[[/footnote]] occurring annually, featuring SCP-5327-A and SCP-5327-B as major protagonists. SCP-5327 will always unfold in the same fashion:\n# At the September Equinox, SCP-5327-A will create a situation that enrages SCP-5327-B.\n# On November 1st, an SCP-5327-C event will occur.\n# On May 1st, both SCP-5327-A and SCP-5327-B will encounter each other in the woodlands next to [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|Site-120]]].\nIf Protocol KAIROS is performed correctly, SCP-5327 will have no permanent effect.\n\nSCP-5327-A is a Class IV reality-altering entity. It is considered a God of Nature and Wilderness by Michaels-Rivera's Deific Domain Classification. SCP-5327-A's ontokinesis is limited to botanical life material. It primarily appears as a six-meter-tall masculine humanoid amalgamation of local vegetation from the region where it is present, always presenting a pair of horns.\n\nSCP-5327-B is a Class III reality-altering entity. It is considered a Chthonic[[footnote]]By [[[SCP-5292|Dr. Raia Micheals]]]'s description, a deity possessing Tartarean characteristics, sometimes described as a Demon-God.[[/footnote]] Goddess of Magic and Night by Michaels-Rivera's Deific Domain Classification. SCP-5327-B does not present theme limitation as its counterpart and is known to possess considerable knowledge about Thaumaturgy to compensate for its low ontokinetic power. It regularly presents as a five-meter tall woman with raven black hair, fair skin, and blue eyes, dressed in purple robes and various jewelry with lunar motifs.\n\nSCP-5327-C is an unpredictable event triggered by SCP-5327. An SCP-5327-C event can vary but always has a botanical theme. If Protocol KAIROS is performed correctly, the effects of SCP-5327-C will be undone. Every SCP-5327-C is to be designated by the loop when it was created. A list of SCP-5327-C events can be seen below:\n\n||~ Designation ||~ Description ||~ Status||\n||= SCP-5327-C-0 ||= [REDACTED] ||= [REDACTED]||\n||= SCP-5327-C-1 || Various individuals were transformed into trees by SCP-5327-A at a campground on the Saxon Switzerland National Park, Saxony, Germany. ||= Neutralized||\n||= SCP-5327-C-2 ||Every fruit at Nok, Slovakia, became poisonous. ||= Neutralized||\n||= SCP-5327-C-3 ||Flowers from the Bled Island, Slovenia, began exuding an offensive odor. ||= Neutralized||\n||= SCP-5327-C-4 ||A large number of trees from Black Forest, Germany, turned carnivorous. ||= Neutralized||\n||= SCP-5327-C-5 ||Any seed eaten by humans at Risnjak National Park, Croatia, rapidly grew to full size within the individual’s stomach.||= Neutralized||\n||= SCP-5327-C-6 ||Mandrakes began to appear around Alrune, Switzerland.

It is based on the principle that any deific entity respects and follows collective thought and sacred ceremonies. When first utilized, it was capable of reconciling SCP-5327-A and SCP-5327-B and nullifying SCP-5327-C-1 effects.\n\nThe protocol is a ritual based on druidic and shamanic seasonal festivities. The protocol requires the following items:\n* One (1) thyrsus[[footnote]]In this case, a wand of giant fennel (//Ferula communis//), covered with leaves and vines of ivy (//Hedera helix//) and topped with the strobilus of an Aleppo pine (//Pinus halepensis//).[[/footnote]]\n* 24 flower wreaths made of any flowers\n* 25 white robes\n\nAfter the start of the rite, twenty-five people have to be chosen: twelve single men, one married man, and twelve single women. These people can be chosen within Foundation's staff (including D-Classes) and civilian communities from the region where the SCP-5327-C event is happening. All participants need to follow a pagan religion or be open to those beliefs. \n\nAt the actual, the participants will be dressed in white robes and the unmarried people will receive flower wreaths to wear on their heads. After that, the Protocol follows as below:\n\n# The married male participant (henceforth called \"priest\") will receive the thyrsus.\n# The twelve male participants (henceforth called \"grooms\") will form a circle around SCP-5327-A.\n# The twelve female participants (henceforth called \"brides\") will form a circle around SCP-5327-B.\n# The priest will start singing. While this occurs, the other participants must dance and walk around the designated entity. Grooms shall move clockwise around SCP-5327-A and brides shall move anticlockwise around SCP-5327-B.\n# When the man with the thyrsus stops singing, the last two to stop singing from each group will be reunited as a couple.\n# The couple exchanges the garlands on their heads and leaves their circles.\n# After the last two couples are picked, the priest has to sing again. If the ritual was performed correctly, SCP-5327-A and SCP-5327-B will dance together. The couples are to dance until the deities disappear.\n# At least one of the couples must actually be married during the ritual.\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show= <An outdated version of this file is disponible for Level 4 clearance personnel.

Analysis has shown that the trees have human DNA within them and that they react to visual and tactile stimuli, mainly by swinging branches. Telepathic communication with the trees has been attempted, without success.\n\nSCP-5327-A is a Class IV reality-altering entity. SCP-5327-A's ontokinesis proved to be limited to botanical life material. It primarily appears as a six-meter-tall masculine humanoid presenting a pair of horns. Its body composition is made of an amalgamation of local vegetation from the region where it is. SCP-5327-A is the main entity of the Kult des Grüns beliefs.\n\nSCP-5327-B is a reality-altering entity described by religious texts as  SCP-5327-A's wife. As the same documents address it as a sorceress, it is assumed that the entity knows thaumaturgy and rituals. The writings also represent it as a five-meter-tall woman with raven black hair, fair skin, and blue eyes, wearing purple or red robes.\n\nSCP-5327-C is Dayspring \"Daisy\" Leonhardt, the three years old daughter of Miranda Leonhardt and SCP-5327-A. SCP-5327-C allegedly has anomalous skills, such as chloropathy[[footnote]]The psionic skill to communicate with botanical life.[[/footnote]] and chlorokinesis.[[footnote]]Anomalous skill to move and command plants with the power of the mind.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Addendum 5327-1:** Discovery\n\nOn 01/11/2013, a field agent undercover agent working at a Fire Lookout Tower at the Saxon Switzerland National Park[[footnote]] A German National Park. [[/footnote]] recorded a Hume fluctuation in the forest. He proceeded to the location after calling for reinforcements.\n\nUpon arrival, the agent discovered the cultists mid-metamorphosis. Their skin was cracking, creating a bark-like texture. Members were rapidly growing and ramifying, creating roots and branches. Thorax and head were fusing and elongating, creating the trunk. SCP-5327-A was present but fled on upon noticing the agent.\n\nMTF Theta-4 (\"Gardeners\")[[footnote]] Tactical team with expertise in fighting botanical anomalies[[/footnote]] arrived at the location and chased SCP-5327-A with no success. Agents discovered the presence of Akiva radiation in the area of the event, thus revealing that the anomaly was theologic and not botanical. After a debriefing, it was decided by administration personnel that the SCP-5327 specimens should be transported to Site-120. A cover story that the group was missing in the National Park was employed.\n\nSCP-5327-B and -C were discovered only after Incident 5327 and remain at large. For further information, see Addendum 5327-3.\n\n**Addendum 5327-2:** Incident 5327\n\nOn 27/04/2014, SCP-5327-A appeared at the woodlands near Site-120.

It was decided that classification, containment procedures, and naming shall be changed to better explain the Seasonal Loop that it became. As it will be your job, I have to notify you about some delicate subjects around it.\n\n**1) SCP-5327 is to be treated as //Safe// and its clearance shall be changed to Level 2.** We hope that this can weaken the effects of the events that result from the anomaly.\n**2) MTF Eta-77 will continue to be responsible for the SCP.** Site-120 and the Department of Tactical Theology agreed that this Task Force has the best agents for the job and there is no need for new groups to be created.\n**3) SCP-5327-C must refer to those events and not only the demigoddess.** Dayspring Leonhardt will be called SCP-5327-C0. Its case and everything about it will continue to be Level 4 Clearance information. RAISA agents will guarantee that nothing leaks from the old archives. The searches around SCP-5327-C0 are to be ceased immediately and references to it are to be reduced due to unpredictable effects that Dayspring's naming has on its mother, Miranda Leonhardt, and the Cult of the Green as a whole.\n\nI believe in you and your ability to continue your job with this anomaly. That's your second chance after the \"oath incident\", so, please, don't repeat the same mistake.\n\nDr. Daniel Asheworth\nGrand Thaumist\nThaumaturgical Archivist\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/<]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5326]]] | SCP-5327 | [[[SCP-5328]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename**: tree.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Impperatrix]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Derivative of:** \"Green Man - The Custard Factory - Digbeth / Deritend\" and \"the dark forest\"\n\n> **Name:** the dark forest\n> **Author:** danoxster\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/41132143@N00/7844712146 flicker]\n\n> **Name:** Green Man - The Custard Factory - Digbeth / Deritend\n> **Author:** ell brown\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/39415781@N06/4009119117 flicker]\n\n> **Filename:** Ceridwen\n> **Author:** Christopher Williams\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Ceridwen.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
