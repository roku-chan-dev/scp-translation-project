Instances of SCP-7661-A are to be apprehended and contained in standard humanoid chambers at Site-56.\n\nFoundation assets are to monitor road traffic collision data to predict the creation of new SCP-7661-A instances. Newly created instances are to be retrieved from SCP-7661, interviewed, then transported to containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7661 is a 2002 Nissan X-terra sports utility vehicle consistent with those produced at the Nissan Smyrna Assembly Plant in Tennessee, USA. No records exist of its manufacture; a plaque reading \"Courtesy Vehicle\" is located where the windshield VIN plate would be. SCP-7661 otherwise operates similarly to a non-anomalous automobile. \n\nSCP-7661 will undergo an anomalous event when any 2002 Nissan X-terra is involved in a road traffic collision in which the driver is terminated as a direct result. An exact duplicate of the driver, designated SCP-7661-A, will manifest within SCP-7661 between 21 and 37 hours following the driver’s death. All instances of SCP-7661-A are physically and genetically identical to their terminated counterpart and possess memories that the latter would have.\n------\n**Addendum 01:** SCP-7661 was first identified by Foundation agents on July 20, 2003 through standard CCTV surveillance of civilian areas. A selection of related transcripts have been provided below. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/City_Market_in_Indianapolis.jpg/640px-City_Market_in_Indianapolis.jpg|caption=Third Street and North Dannis Avenue.|width=300px|align=right]]\n\n= **Transcript 7661-1**\n\n**Date:** July 18, 2003\n\n**Location:** Kyuzhevitz, North Carolina, USA\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//It is 17:16 EST.

An oncoming bus stops at the intersection, yielding to the vehicle.//\n\n//The SUV begins to accelerate, turning left.//\n\n//An oncoming speeding coupe swerves around the bus and collides with the SUV head-on. The force of the impact pushes the SUV backwards a few meters.//\n\n//The two vehicles come to rest as the SUV's horn blares. Multiple onlookers begin to walk towards the damaged vehicles in an attempt to provide assistance.//\n\n//A pedestrian approaches the driver’s side of the SUV and looks inward before reaching in.//\n\n//The horn ceases blaring.//\n\n//The pedestrian steps back from the wreckage and begins to solicit additional help from the surrounding crowd.//\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **Transcript 7661-2**\n\n**Date:** July 20, 2003\n\n**Location:** Slipchester, Nevada, USA\n------\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n//It is 1:35 PST.

They are dressed in Kyuzhevitz Police uniforms. Two more agents are preparing to load SCP-7661 onto a Foundation flatbed tow truck.//\n\n**Polot:** Alright team, one last reminder. Repeat after me: \"Mackenzie Macrada\".\n\n**Stafford and Nelson:** Mackenzie Macrada.\n\n**Polot:** \"Accident investigation.\"\n\n**Stafford and Nelson:** Accident investigation. \n\n//The three agents take deep breaths as Agent Polot knocks on the front door.//\n\n**Polot:** Kyuzhevitz Police Department! We have some questions for a \"Mrs. Macrada\".\n\n//The door opens to reveal an elderly woman.//\n\n**Woman:** Hello?\n\n**Polot:** Hello, ma'am. We need to talk to Mackenzie about the accident she was in about a week ago.\n\n**Woman:** What do you mean? She's completely fine. I... I thought I lost her, but...\n\n**Nelson:** Right, but there's been... a discrepancy over who's at fault, so we're here to ask her more about it.\n\n**Woman:** Um... alright then. \n\n//The woman turns around. Behind her, a young boy and girl are visible.//\n\n**Woman:** Mackenzie! The police are here to ask you about that accident!\n\n//SCP-7661-A-1 peers from around a corner.//\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** That's odd... cops?\n\n//SCP-7661-A-1 walks towards the front door as the elderly woman and children watch.//\n\n**Polot:** Hello, Mrs. Macrada. We need you to come down to the station to discuss that accident you were involved in. Don't worry, you're not under arrest or anything.\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh... the accident. \n\n**Nelson:** It's just gonna take a couple hours. It's for... insurance purposes?\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** Um... okay, officers. \n\n//The two children begin to approach SCP-7661-A-1.//\n\n**Boy:** Mom, mom, why are the police taking you?\n\n//SCP-7661-A-1 kneels down to eye level with the children as the agents watch silently.//\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** They just need to talk to me about the accident last week, Dustin.\n\n**Girl:** But Mommy, you're okay!\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh Rachel, it's just... adult stuff. I'll explain when you're older. \n\n**Stafford:** Um... Miss, we're on a bit of a tight schedule...\n\n**SCP-7661-A-1:** Oh, I see. //<to the children>// I'll be back soon, stay put with Grandma.\n\n//The children attempt to hug SCP-7661-A-1, but are blocked by Agent Polot.//\n\n**Polot:** Don't worry kids, your mother will be back soon. \n\n**Boy:** Oh... okay, officer. \n\n**Girl:** //<waving to SCP-7661-A-1>// Bye, mommy!\n\n//SCP-7661-A-1 waves back as it exits the house and is escorted by Agent Nelson to the Foundation-borrowed police cruiser.//\n\n//Agent Polot exchanges glances with Agent Stafford.//\n\n//Stafford nods, and the two face the elderly woman as the children watch.//\n\n**Polot:** While my partner takes Mackenzie in, we need to ask you some more questions. Mind if we come in?\n\n**Woman:** What kind of questions?\n\n//As Agent Polot recites his answers, Agent Stafford approaches the children.//\n\n**Boy:** Officer, when's our mom gonna be done with the questions?\n\n**Girl:** When will Mommy come back?\n\n//Agent Stafford does not respond.//\n\n**Boy:** Officer?\n\n//The elderly woman becomes agitated with Agent Polot.//\n\n**Woman:** Sir, I //do not// understand why you need to enter my home.\n\n//Agent Polot remains silent as he takes out his can of Class-B aerosol amnestics from his pocket. The woman notices.//\n\n**Woman:** What... what is that?\n\n//Agent Polot administers the amnestics in the elderly woman's face.//\n\n//The woman's mouth opens agape as she breathes in the amnestics. Stafford and the children gasp as they watch.//\n\n**Boy:** G- Grandma? What are you doing to my grandma?\n\n**Girl:** //Grandma!//\n\n//Agent Polot turns around towards Agent Stafford and the children, who appear distressed. Polot runs towards them, amnestics can in hand.//\n\n**Boy:** What did you do to-\n\n//Agent Polot sprays the amnestic aerosol can in the boy's face. The girl begins to cry.//\n\n//Agent Stafford steps back as Polot administers the amnestics in the girl's face.//\n\n//The two children cease commotion and stand in a slight daze.//\n\n//The agents look back at the elderly woman, who has slumped to the floor. Polot runs to her and checks her pulse.//\n\n**Polot:** //Shit,// I thought she was dead for a second...\n\n//Agent Polot looks back at Agent Stafford.//\n\n**Polot:** Why didn't you- why didn't you use your amnestics? You were just standing there!\n\n**Stafford:** I just- I didn't really... um...\n\n**Polot:** You //need// to get used to spraying that stuff, no way around it.\n\n**Stafford:** It's just that... we just-\n\n**Polot:** Every second counts.\n\n//Agent Polot picks up the elderly woman and carries her to a sofa as Agent Stafford watches.//\n\n//Polot sets the woman down on the sofa, then grabs the two children to sit them down next to the Woman.//\n\n**Stafford:** I'm sorry.\n\n//Agent Polot looks at Agent Stafford and sighs.//\n\n**Polot:** Remember your training next time, Stafford.\n\n//The two agents walk towards the front door. Agent Stafford glances behind her at the children and elderly woman sitting docile on the sofa.//\n\n//The agents exit the house, closing the door behind them.//\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThrough SCP-7661-A-1's subsequent interrogation, SCP-7661's abilities were successfully ascertained. An additional four uncontained SCP-7661-A instances have been identified through analysis of road collision data.
