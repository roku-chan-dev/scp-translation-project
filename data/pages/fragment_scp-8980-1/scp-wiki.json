He was scoped and hired by the SCP Foundation shortly after achieving his doctoral degree in Computer Science. Throughout his time at the Foundation, Dr. Byrnes was involved in the containment of several notable software- and hardware-related anomalies (including [[[SCP-079]]]), resulting in his eventual promotion to Containment Specialist in 1998. He achieved Level 4 credentials in October of 2010. He chose to retire in 2014, undergoing Class-E amnestic treatment per his own volition.\n _\nEarly on in his career, the Ethics Committee received reports regarding Dr. Byrnes's behavior, which was seen as condescending and aggressive by his colleagues. He was regularly reported by coworkers for this behavior. After a formal meeting with a Site-17 Human Resources representative, Dr. Byrnes agreed to be more mindful and cognizant of his behavior towards other Foundation personnel. The Committee has not received any additional reports regarding his behavior since.\n _\nDr. Byrnes is the primary subject of investigation for this annotated review. A vast majority of SCP-8980's documentation (including this file) was drafted and published by him.[[/span]]. Communication over electronic messaging systems in SCP-8980's immediate vicinity should be consistently monitored for corruption or degradation, if it occurs.\n\nAs a [[span class=\"bi-r\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]former[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Misleading Information** — SCP-8980 was still a member of Foundation staff even while in containment.[[/span]] member of Foundation staff, SCP-8980 is to be returned to its position and former duties upon the cessation of anomalous properties. To this end, SCP-8980 is to undergo yearly routine testing to ensure it is still anomalous.\n\n----\n\n**Description:** SCP-8980 is [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Lillian Marley[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Lillian Marley** was a Level 3 Containment Specialist, and is currently employed by the SCP Foundation. Marley joined the SCP Foundation in 1999 after discovering an algorithm directly related to an anomalous mathematical inequality, shortly after obtaining her Bachelor's degree in Computer Science.\n _\nAlthough Researcher Marley did not pursue a higher degree while employed by the Foundation, she quickly became a prominent member of Junior Staff due to her work ethic, conscientious attitude, and accomplishments. Her thorough objectivity and rigor in research eventually earned her Level 3 credentials in 2004, shortly before she began to manifest anomalous properties in 2005.\n _\nResearcher Marley is the secondary subject of investigation for this annotated review.[[/span]], a [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]28-year-old[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Age** — SCP-8980 was twenty-eight years old at the time of containment. As per standard protocol, an Artificial Intelligence Construct should have been assigned to update the page on SCP-8980's date of birth (January 12th), or the page should have only contained its date of birth. SCP-8980 is forty at the time of this review.[[/span]] [[span class=\"bi-r\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Caucasian[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Improper Nomenclature** — \"Caucasian\" is an obsolete classification; if ethnicity is necessary to specify (which it is not in this case), specifying the individual's culture of origin is preferable.[[/span]] [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]human[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Replacement** — the word \"human\" can be used in place of ethnicity.

It has displayed no abnormal Hume, EVE, or Akiva radiation readings since containment.\n\nSCP-8980's anomalous capabilities activate when utilizing electronic software. Whenever SCP-8980 produces, edits, deletes, or otherwise interacts (even indirectly) with digital information, the information is modified in some manner that negatively affects SCP-8980, whether socially, financially, psychologically, etc. Past examples of this include:\n\n* Critical files deleting themselves randomly from devices owned by SCP-8980.\n* Words in files changing into similar, inappropriate words ([[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]i.e.[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Latin Phrase** — //e.g.// should have been used instead, as this sentence clause is providing an example rather than clarifying the prior sentence.[[/span]] \"I like you.\" -> \"I lick you.\").\n* Electronic communication being sent to incorrect addresses, often resulting in data breaches or confusion.\n* Important programs initiated by SCP-8980 engaging in undefined behavior even if impossible (e.g. throwing segmentation faults despite being memory-safe).\n* Electronic payments intended for SCP-8980 being routed to incorrect recipients or failing to send under automated systems.\n* Electronic devices randomly shutting down in close proximity to SCP-8980, especially when owned by other individuals.\n\nThe exact source of SCP-8980's anomaly is unclear and is subject to ongoing research.\n\n----\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8980 [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]first became anomalous[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Certainty** — whether SCP-8980 was anomalous beforehand is unclear. The phrase \"was first discovered\" is more appropriate.[[/span]] in February of 2005 during a routine team meeting. Researcher Marley attempted to display a graph demonstrating a comparison between two algorithms; however, instead, the projector began to display highly explicit content. This resulted in Human Resources penalizing Researcher Marley by requiring an audit of her personal devices [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]bi-weekly[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Vague Vernacular** — could imply SCP-8980 was audited twice weekly. \"Once every two weeks\" should be used instead.[[/span]] and reducing her pay, despite protests [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]that her device never contained such material and that it was not due to any fault of her own[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Missing Context** — failing to specify the nature of SCP-8980's protests imply that it was protesting the punishment itself rather than the basis of the case.[[/span]].\n\nOver the coming weeks, Researcher Lillian began to report significant issues with her devices and assigned SCiPnet account. Provided examples included random deletion of files, modification of interpersonal communication in a way that negatively affected her (which had, in one instance, resulted in an additional penalization), and random shutdowns of nearby electronics owned by her coworkers. Replacement of her devices, recreation of her accounts, and even temporary relocation and isolation of her physical self failed to prevent these anomalies from occurring. \n\nAfter deliberation, [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]it was determined[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Passive Voice** — the use of passive voice obfuscates that this action was taken by Site-17's Containment Oversight Committee, with advisory from Dr. Byrnes's research group (excluding SCP-8980).[[/span]] that the best course of action was to classify Researcher Marley as an anomaly, citing concerns over property damage or potential loss of life. Marley hesitantly agreed to undergo [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]temporary[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Missing Context** — SCP-8980 only agreed towards tentative, temporary containment; lacking this context, the phrasing implies consent to permanent containment, which was not granted by SCP-8980.[[/span]] containment until anomalous properties ceased.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 1:** Initial Interviews\n\nFollowing containment, Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes conducted a series of initial interviews to understand the scope and severity of SCP-8980's anomalous properties.

I got caught up in traffic today.\n\n**SCP-8980:** It's 10:13 AM. You got to the site two hours ago. I know your schedule, we've worked together for two years now.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** The traffic delayed my other work. You know I have a lot of responsibilities, as research head of Section 3.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Sure.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** So?\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** You're impatient today.\n\n**SCP-8980:** (//Agitated//) Look Byrnes, I've been stuck in a cell for the past week getting my blood drawn and being put through the wringer with all of these tests. I'd hope — at the very least — you'd give me the luxury of being on time.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes shakes his head.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Jesus. You can be a real ball-buster sometimes, Lily.\n\n//SCP-8980 massages its temples.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Just... just spare me this time. What's the outlook?\n\n//Dr. Byrnes places his briefcase on the table and fetches a few documents from the top, before placing the briefcase on the floor once more. He bites his lip in hesitation.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Well, unfortunately, it does seem like all the standard tests came back null, indicating that your anomaly isn't Pseudo-Explainable.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Okay. I figured as much.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes pulls out and slides another document towards SCP-8980. It picks it up and begins to read, while Dr. Byrnes continues speaking.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** We haven't been able to figure out any concrete //rules// yet, but we can at least determine the anomaly isn't Inexplicable.\n\n**SCP-8980:** ...Yeah. I can definitely see some correlations in the data here, but nothing that can allow us to predict any particular...\n\n//Dr. Byrnes waits momentarily, while SCP-8980 squints at the paper.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** We've been able to establish one likely through-line for all the past incidents, though.\n\n//SCP-8980 stops reading and looks up, concern on its face.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** ...Which is?\n\n//Dr. Byrnes clears his throat.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Well... it seems like the anomaly is trying to humiliate you.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** //What?//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Here, look.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes slides a third document to SCP-8980, who immediately begins to read it fervently.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Every instance of 8980 changing text has been to your social detriment; every document it's deleted has been when you absolutely needed it for work; and every email that's been sent to the wrong address has caused some breach of sensitive information, calling into question your cognitive stability; and every device that shut down was in the middle of a critical operation while you were nearby.\n\n//SCP-8980 looks up at Dr. Byrnes.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** What... I— do you think it's—\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Are you religious, by any chance?\n\n//SCP-8980 pauses, taken aback, and contemplates the question momentarily. It shakes its head.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** ...No. I was born to Catholic parents, but I haven't been religious since I was fifteen.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Then our first suspect is targeted divine punishment from an Akiva-based entity, or an essophysical attachment of some kind. I can get the relevant departments to run some tests on our behalf; thankfully, essophysics is centralized in 17, so they can get back to us quicker.\n\n//SCP-8980 glances down to the paper it is holding.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** ...Thanks. I appreciate it.\n\n//SCP-8980 pauses.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Looking at the results... I assume you'll also want more data points out of me. \n\n//Dr. Byrnes smiles and folds his hands together.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** You've always had a pretty good head on your shoulders, SCP-8980. Yes, we'll want to be absolutely sure there's no underlying pattern by conducting a few experiments with you. If it's any consolation, it'll give you something to do while we figure out this whole situation.\n\n**SCP-8980:** ...That will add at least another two weeks onto my containment. That's ridiculous. I can't do that.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes sighs softly.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** I don't think there's much of a choice, sadly. We can't have you inadvertently ruining critical software in the site, especially with some of the nightmares we lock up here. You're just going to have to put up with it for a while. If it helps, we've already reassigned the manifold problem to Morgan, who should be able to handle it. Just consider this a... an extended vacation, alright?\n\n//SCP-8980 sighs loudly.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Okay. Alright — fine. Whatever. But you better make sure he credits me for the parts I already did.\n\n**DR.

SCP-8980 was given a standard Dell-brand laptop with Windows 95 installed as its operating system. The laptop was not capable of connecting to SCiPNet or the Internet.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** Very little occurred initially; however, when attempting to play Minesweeper after an hour, [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 consistently triggered a bomb on the first guess for over 58 games in a row[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]This is impossible on non-anomalous versions of Windows 95, as the game generates the board around where the button is first pressed.[[/span]], resulting in it angrily closing the device.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //It is possible that the phenomenon may be placing SCP-8980 into situations which will cause it to react with frustration or anger, embarrassing itself. SCP-8980's [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]hot-headed personality[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Inappropriate Description** — self-explanatory.[[/span]] probably exemplifies this; a good avenue for future experimentation.// -Dr. Byrnes.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n**ID:** 8980-A-2\n\n**DURATION:** 3.5 Hours\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was provided with a Dell-brand desktop running [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]NETLOG[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]NETLOG was the standard SCP Foundation Operating System used for most devices. It was deprecated in 2010 and replaced with Framerail.[[/span]] with read-only SCiPNet permissions. SCP-8980 was instructed to solve one hundred geometry math problems on the device. Certain modifications were made to the software to obfuscate and frustrate SCP-8980 in order to test whether the frustration would prevent SCP-8980's anomaly from activating.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 initially reported mixed success, though frequently bumped into software obfuscation that frustrated [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]her[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Identifier** — all anomalies should be referred to solely by their designation, a clinical identifier, or the pronoun \"it\". This is to prevent personnel from forming inappropriate personal connections with the SCPs they are assigned to.[[/span]] endeavors. Researchers noted that values in the software had begun to change slightly while SCP-8980 solved them, resulting in consistently incorrect results; these were not part of the programmed obfuscation tactics. Test was aborted after SCP-8980 refused to continue, citing a migraine.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //SCP-8980's anomalous properties activated quite insidiously here; it took us nearly twenty minutes before we even noticed the values changing. It seems the anomaly isn't content with allowing situations to play out naturally, and it could be affecting things on a much more minute scale than we thought. We'll have to pay closer attention.// -Dr. Byrnes\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n**ID:** 8980-A-4\n\n**DURATION:** 25 Minutes\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was provided with its work computer, modified to be SCiPNet read-only. SCP-8980 was allowed to use the device for up to an hour in private, in order to test whether its effects activated without outside observers.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 aborted the test 25 minutes into the experiment unexpectedly, showing distress. [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 did not yield to questioning on the nature of this event, and requested the experiment not be conducted again.[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]While testimony did corroborate the existence of this experiment and the described interview, no video recording could be found in Site-17's DEEPWELL archives.[[/span]]\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //Even though we are not aware of the specifics of what occurred during this experiment, it is still apparent that the anomaly activates in isolation with SCP-8980. The next line of inquiry should be to see whether or not SCP-8980's anomaly activates with other electronic devices besides Personal Computers (PCs).// [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]-Dr. Steele[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Dr. Rachel Steele** was another member of the SCP-8980 containment team. Interviews conducted with Dr. Steele by the Ethics Committee revealed next-to-no involvement from her in SCP-8980's actual containment beyond initial testing.\n _\nIt is the general consensus of the Ethics Committee that this general lack of involvement was gross negligence on part of Dr. Steele concerning the circumstances surrounding SCP-8980's later containment, and as a result is in direct [[span class=\"red-text\"]]violation[[/span]] of the Foundation Code of Conduct.[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n**ID:** 8980-A-5\n\n**DURATION:** 7.5 Hours\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was brought to a temporary testing chamber with essential commodities and was provided with a 27\" LCD television set connected to cable. SCP-8980 was permitted to watch any television channel it wished.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 watched various educational documentaries throughout the test, interspersed by an attending researcher entering the room to check on the experiment's status. After seven and a half hours — approaching the eight-hour allotted duration of the experiment — the television suddenly switched to playing //The Wiggles Show!// (a children's program) moments before an attending researcher entered the room. The device would not respond to external input until SCP-8980 was removed from the premises.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]//It seems as though SCP-8980's anomaly has some form of foresight or intelligence behind it — though we haven't been able to figure out who or what it is.//[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Erroneous Assumption** — there are numerous reasons for why an anomaly may display rationalistic behaviors similar to sapience without being sentient. As a Containment Specialist, Dr. Byrnes should have been aware of this.[[/span]] -Dr. Byrnes\n[[/div]]\n\nSimultaneously, several more tests were run on organic samples of SCP-8980, the following of which are recorded below:\n\n||~ Type ||~ Results ||~ Comments ||\n||= Akiva ||= [[span class=\"red-text\"]]Baseline[[/span]] [[size 80%]](Atheist)[[/size]] || Rules out possibility of divine punishment. ||\n||= [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Essophysical[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\" style=\"text-align: left;\"]]Refers to the physical embodiment of an abstract concept.[[/span]]||= [[span class=\"red-text\"]]Unbound[[/span]] || Rules out possibility of essophysical embodiment. ||\n||= Temporal ||= [[span class=\"red-text\"]]Unaffected[[/span]] || Rules out possibility of temporal manipulation. ||\n||= I-ACRS ||= [[span class=\"red-text\"]]No Matches[[/span]] || Rules out possibility of causation by known anomaly. ||\n||= Antimemetic ||= ##orange|Unlikely## || While it cannot be ruled out, no major indicators of antimemetic activity have been noted. ||\n||= Digital ||= ##orange|Unlikely## || While it similarly cannot be ruled out, both the IT department and AIAD could not locate any malware or similar software that could be causing SCP-8980 on SCiPNet. ||\n\nAfter compiling existing evidence, a third interview was conducted with SCP-8980, roughly three weeks after initial containment.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** March 29th, 2005\n\n**INTERVIEWER:** Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes\n\n**INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-8980\n\n**SUBJECT:** Explaining Findings\n\n----\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n----\n\n//Interview is conducted in SCP-8980's containment chamber.

BYRNES:** Lillian, you're acting irrational again. This isn't the end of the world or anything—\n\n**SCP-8980:** (//Interrupting//) Like hell it isn't! Do you know what this means?!\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** —You'll... you'll //just// need to continue testing for a few more months so we can learn to... to mitigate your anomalous effects. That's it. That's it.\n\n//SCP-8980 scoffs.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** So what? Am I supposed to just rot away in this chamber all day while I wait for my \"coworkers\" to finish poking and prodding me with sticks?\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Look. I'm sure we can arrange some form of... entertainment for you in the interim.\n\n**SCP-8980:** I don't— I don't //want// entertainment. All I want is to work on my projects and actually //do// something for the world, not watch the— the fucking //Wiggles// all day!\n\n//Dr. Byrnes sighs in frustration.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** I figured this would be hard to break to you. Alright, //well//... right now, the best thing you can do for us is to remain in containment and help us study you. Once everything's all done and settled down and we've figured out what's wrong with you, we'll let you come back out and you can help us with your projects or studies or algorithms or whatever. Alright?\n\n**SCP-8980:** It's //not// alright. And I never said I wanted to help //you//.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes flinches and grunts.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** ...Not like you've been helping //me// all that much anyways.\n\n//SCP-8980 scoffs again, but doesn't immediately reply. Silence elapses for ten seconds. Neither makes eye contact.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Alright. One month. After that, I revoke my consent to containment.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** ...You can't \"revoke your consent\" to containment.\n\n**SCP-8980:** I know my rights, Byrnes.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes laughs. [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 doesn't.[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Missing Descriptor** — due to the contrast between Dr. Byrnes's reaction and SCP-8980's, it is noteworthy to include the lack of social reciprocation on SCP-8980's part.[[/span]]//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Okay, okay. Got it. One month. We'll try to have it all sorted out by then.\n\n//SCP-8980 sighs, then leans back in its chair.//\n\n**SCP-8980:** Is that everything then?\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Thank God.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Yes, thank God indeed.\n\n//Dr. Byrnes gets up, and reaches out to shake SCP-8980's hand. SCP-8980 at first glances between his face and his hand, before eventually choosing to accept the handshake. Both leave the chamber.//\n\n----\n\n= **[END LOG]**\n\n----\n\n**AFTERWORD:** //Telling SCP-8980 the bad news on how containment as an anomaly works will certainly be awkward, so if we can find a way to at least mitigate SCP-8980's effects in the next month, that would be preferable.

SCP-8980 was provided with a fully-charged, brand-new laptop running Windows 95 with no prior interaction with other electronic equipment post-manufacturing.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 experienced significant difficulty setting the operating system up, including high input latency, incorrect options being selected (such as language), and the device randomly restarting. While SCP-8980 was able to eventually set up the device, it was cited as being uncomfortable and requested to conclude the experiment.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //This does seem to confirm that SCP-8980 is the **source** of the anomaly, as opposed to just its subject. Isolation isn't able to fully prevent its effects, though it isolates any corruption to the device itself.// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-B-4\n\n**DURATION:** 45 Minutes\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 used a Foundation-standard desktop within a [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Class 2 Faraday Room[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]A room lined with a Faraday cage, which is a device designed to prevent electromagnetic radiation from interfering with internal electronics. The exact definition is not necessary for this review; however, it is unclear why Dr. Byrnes included this experiment in the log, as there was no reason to suspect this would have any effect, and the experiment returned null results.[[/span]].\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 experienced anomalous effects in line with prior observations.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //This certainly rules out the possibility of electromagnetic interference, [[span class=\"bi-r\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]or something of the sort[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Vague Vernacular** — more specific language, such as \"or any similar possible origins of the anomalous effect\", should have been used in this context.[[/span]].// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-B-5\n\n**DURATION:** 25 Minutes\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was placed in a room with several electronic devices, including mobile cellphones, television sets, and desktops. SCP-8980 was instructed to use one such device for the duration of the experiment for any purpose.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** SCP-8980 selected and used a BlackBerry 7230 cellphone for several minutes. As the device was modified to prevent the user from sending outgoing electronic communication, SCP-8980 began to play the game \"Brick Breaker\". After several minutes, the device suddenly froze and began to send an outgoing call. The recipient — a man named \"Michael Crawford\", who had gone to the same college as SCP-8980 — answered the phone. SCP-8980, upon learning the man's identity, attempted to hang up, though the device refused to cooperate. The two engaged in a heated debate regarding a nebulous topic for nearly fifteen minutes, before SCP-8980 smashed the device and halted the experiment.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //Filling SCP-8980's surroundings with electronics to \"dilute\" its anomalous effects doesn't seem to have any effect. The anomaly appears to be laser-targeted to cause as much damage to SCP-8980's psyche as it can, though its limits haven't been clearly identified.//\n\n//The incident regarding Michael Crawford was of particular interest to us, though background checks and subsequent interviews with him haven't yielded any light on SCP-8980's anomaly. His relationship with SCP-8980 appears to have been one-sided, as he knows more about SCP-8980 than SCP-8980 knows about him, though they definitely do know// of //each other. Details are limited on both sides. He doesn't have any connections to any known GoIs and possesses little-to-no sub-Veil knowledge. Just to be sure, though, we amnesticized him with Class-B amnestics.//\n\n//SCP-8980 has shown heavy reluctance to participate in future experimentation. I've assured it we're getting closer to a permanent solution. It will just need a few days to get its emotions in control.// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-B-6\n\n**DURATION:** 10 Hours\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was taken to a retrofitted containment chamber and was provided with multiple stacks of Foundation-standard lined paper as well as several writing instruments (such as pencils). SCP-8980 was instructed to write several short programs on the paper in [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]//C//[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]A popular programming language.[[/span]], and output the finished product into a slot on the wall. The paper would then be interpreted by a remote system, which would then print the requested debugging/output information and return it to SCP-8980.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** No noted effects of SCP-8980's anomaly were observed during this process.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //This system seems like a clear and functional way for SCP-8980 to continue its duties to the Foundation. While I'm sure it's a large reduction in quality compared to a machine, I'm sure it's at least a little relieved that it has a future at this organization. I'm sure I speak for all of us in our research team when I say I look forward to having it back with us.// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing several days standardizing SCP-8980's containment arrangement, SCP-8980 began to resume active employment at the SCP Foundation on April 18th, 2005, with special considerations for its anomalous capabilities. SCP-8980's designation was not lifted, however, due to its potential risk to nearby electronic equipment. SCP-8980's containment procedures have been updated.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 5:** Post-Reemployment Containment Interview\n\nFor the first few days following SCP-8980's accommodations being standardized, SCP-8980 showed signs of struggling, however quickly achieved similar efficiency within a week of acclimation, despite the limitations. SCP-8980 showed some signs of improved emotional stability during this period.\n\nAfter several weeks of concurrent containment and employment, SCP-8980 began to show signs of irritation and lack of cooperation. After three days of poor compliance with Foundation working standards, Dr. Byrnes scheduled an interview with SCP-8980 to identify the source of the issue.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**DATE:** May 4th, 2005\n\n**INTERVIEWER:** Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes\n\n**INTERVIEWEE:** SCP-8980\n\n**SUBJECT:** Ongoing Issues in Work Ethic\n\n----\n\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n----\n\n//SCP-8980 sits motionless behind the interviewing table with its hands clasped together. Despite the lack of movement, there is clear [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]irritation[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Descriptor** — SCP-8980's expression was more clearly anxious rather than irritated.[[/span]] present on its face.//\n\n//At around 10:09 AM, Dr. Byrnes enters the interview chamber. SCP-8980 takes a silent, deep breath, but does not greet him. He sits down and faces it.//\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Good morning.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Hi.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**DR.

We appreciate your continued efforts to help make the SCP Foundation a more ethical and responsible organization.\n\nFollowing intense deliberation, we have decided to respond to each of the points you made below independently, in order to ensure we adequately meet your expectations:\n\n[[span style=\"padding-left: 10px; color: #2f2f2f; border-left: 3px solid #2f2f2f\"]]A severe lack of visitation rights from family members.[[/span]]\n\nAs per Chapter 2, Section 5 § 8.15.3 of the Ethics Committee Code of Conduct, an anomaly may be denied visitation rights if the transportation of any involved persons could cause \"significant and/or highly likely damage to either normalcy or monetary/personnel resources of the SCP Foundation\". In conjunction with your anomalous effects, it is the opinion of this Committee that a lack of visitation rights was within the guidelines set out by the Ethics Committee as they so intended.\n\n[[span style=\"padding-left: 10px; color: #2f2f2f; border-left: 3px solid #2f2f2f\"]]A major failure in privacy rights, especially during socialization.[[/span]]\n\nIt is largely the opinion of this Committee that Dr. Byrnes is not infringing on your right to privacy. While several accommodations can and will be made for your future containment (such as a provisional guarantee to private one-on-one conversations with other anomalies or coworkers without direct supervision), you still maintain an overall right to privacy with stipulations to accommodate your anomalous properties.\n\n[[span style=\"padding-left: 10px; color: #2f2f2f; border-left: 3px solid #2f2f2f\"]]A lack of sufficient entertainment/stimulation.[[/span]]\n\nYour containment staff will be provided with a $50 USD monthly allocated budget for purchasing recreational material at your request.\n\n[[span style=\"padding-left: 10px; color: #2f2f2f; border-left: 3px solid #2f2f2f\"]]Verbal abuse from Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes.[[/span]]\n\nThe Committee has found that several comments made by Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes to you have indeed been inappropriate for a professional environment.

The following is an [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]abridged[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]It is the general consensus of the Ethics Committee Review Team that the quantity of experiments in totality conducted was severely in excess of what was reasonably required, totaling 36 separate experiments over two months despite only the four listed below providing any new information.[[/span]] list of the third round of experimentation conducted by SCP-8980's research team under Head Researcher Christopher Byrnes.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-C-3\n\n**DURATION:** 1.5 Minutes\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was instructed to warm up a standard Foundation ration using a microwave oven with no electronic interfaces (though it contained internal electronic circuits).\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** The microwave's radiation was significantly higher than normal; instead of the standard 2.5 GHz, the microwave was believed to output at the maximum 6.8 GHz for the model, resulting in the ration violently exploding inside.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //It appears as though electronic circuitry is susceptible to SCP-8980's effects, despite the lack of electronic interface. The effect extends even to regular equipment too, which justifies the strict oversight of SCP-8980's movement through the site.// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-C-12\n\n**DURATION:** 2 Hours\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was instructed to use an experimental speech-to-text transcriber that was located in a separate room to fulfill various prompts, which would then be printed out afterwords using an analog system. SCP-8980 did not have any direct contact with the transcriber, which was electronic in nature.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** The transcriber began to misrepresent various words that SCP-8980 spoke in a manner consistent with its known anomalous properties. It is unclear if this was partially due to the transcriber's general inaccuracy, or influenced by SCP-8980.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //Electronic components which SCP-8980 has direct contact with — even if it can't see them — still appear to malfunction. This definitely limits our options even further than they already were. If we are to find some alternative system, we have to be creative.// -Dr. Byrnes\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-C-31\n\n**DURATION:** 15 Hours\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** An inactive DELL desktop computer running Windows XP was placed in SCP-8980's containment chamber. SCP-8980 was instructed not to use or interact with the device at all.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** Despite not interacting with the desktop, the device repeatedly activated. During activation, the device played the Windows XP startup sound, which repeatedly and audibly startled SCP-8980. SCP-8980 refused to touch or turn off the device after startup, even when requested to by experiment overseers.\n\nAfter the twenty-third activation at approximately fifteen hours into the experiment, SCP-8980 began sobbing uncontrollably, terminating the test.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** //This experiment — while disruptive for SCP-8980 — helps us further narrow down why our alternative systems don't quite work. Interaction does not seem to be a prerequisite for the anomaly's activation, only SCP-8980's general proximity.// -Dr. Byrnes\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote light\"]]\n\n**ID:** 8980-C-36\n\n**DURATION:** 47 Minutes\n\n**EXPERIMENT:** SCP-8980 was brought to a connected testing chamber. It was instructed to communicate with Junior Researcher Morgan McPharrell, who was present in a separate room. McPharrell was instructed in turn to follow SCP-8980's directions while interacting with a DELL desktop computer, taking caution not to communicate back to SCP-8980 except through written notes passed through a slot on the walls connecting the chambers.\n\n**NOTED EFFECTS:** While the experiment was running, no noted effects occurred. However, roughly 3/4ths of an hour into the experiment, SCP-8980 vomited onto the floor of the chamber, and began sobbing uncontrollably. SCP-8980 and Junior Researcher McPharrell were both extracted and the experiment concluded early.\n\n----\n\n**COMMENTS:** See following Incident log.\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Incident 1:** Post-Medical Instability\n\nOn August 16th, 2005, SCP-8980 vomited profusely during [[span class=\"bi-r\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]routine[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Information** — the testing was not routine.[[/span]] testing, resulting in its immediate hospitalization in Site-17's West Wing. After objective analysis, it was largely determined that SCP-8980 did not suffer from a known paramedical or medical condition, and its issues were likely due to cumulative stress, depressive symptoms, and disorientation from a lack of proper nutrition. [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 was discharged to its containment unit on August 17th, 2005.[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]Although compliant with the Foundation Medical Code of Conduct, it would have been prudent for medical staff to hold SCP-8980 for several days to properly diagnose any underlying medical or mental disorders.[[/span]]\n\nDespite being discharged, SCP-8980 refused continued testing, citing its hospitalization as a [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]](valid)[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Missing Context** — it is important to specify that SCP-8980's reason for suspension of testing is entirely valid under the then-present circumstances according to the Foundation Code of Conduct.[[/span]] reason for suspension of experimentation.

This necessitated Foundation intervention for the safety of both the anomaly and its containment personnel. To this end, several measures were immediately enacted by Dr. Byrnes in compliance with the Foundation Code of Conduct:\n\n* SCP-8980 was classified as a potentially hostile entity, requiring approval from containment staff to interact with the anomaly.\n* SCP-8980's free-roam time was reduced, with further restrictions to its movement at the site to minimize future incidents.\n* SCP-8980 was required to undergo [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Level 3 intensity security measures for humanoids[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]Level 3 intensity requires security cameras to be placed directly in the containment cell of the anomaly, additional restrictions on what recreational items the anomaly is allowed to request, and weekly room searches to prevent contraband possession. The maximum security level is five. _\n _\nIt is the opinion of the Ethics Committee Review Team that this was extremely excessive for the circumstance, though not technically in [[span class=\"red-text\"]]violation[[/span]] of the Foundation's Code of Conduct.[[/span]].\n* SCP-8980 was assigned to mandatory in-person parapsychological counseling.\n\nAfter implementing the above procedures, Dr. Byrnes was requested by Site-17 administration to distance himself from handling SCP-8980's case. [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]He complied[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Incorrect Information** — Dr. Byrnes was highly agitated by his removal and consistently put pressure on Site-17's senior staff to remain Head Researcher over SCP-8980.[[/span]].

Of the remaining two, Dr. Steele professed no interest in taking up the position, and Junior Researcher McPharrell was strictly underqualified for the role. _\n**Incorrect Information** — the process occurred over several days, not weeks.[[/span]], Site Director Thomas Graham signed off on the retainment of Dr. Byrnes as Head Researcher, [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]citing his prior professionalism and expertise[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]When confronted with evidence regarding Dr. Byrnes's inappropriate prior actions, Site Director Thomas Graham claimed complete ignorance to nearly all of the events detailed prior and below. While this is considered extremely unlikely due to his central role on the Site-17 Containment Oversight Committee, no concrete evidence has yet been found that he intentionally violated the Foundation Code of Conduct in this case.[[/span]] in handling SCP-8980's \"tantrums\". \n\nFor three days following the incident, SCP-8980 was given medical treatment for the wounds it incurred during the altercation. On August 27th, it was returned to its containment chamber.

Because of this, she was scouted by a Foundation recruitment agency and she accepted the position of parapsychologist shortly thereafter. _\n _\nDr. Crawford has generally been described as thoughtful, compassionate, and patient by most of the anomalies put under her care in the past. However, several incidents demonstrating grossly inappropriate behavior throughout her career resulted in the Foundation terminating her employment in 2013. This includes a particularly grievous incident in 2012, involving a romantic relationship with a male anomaly under her care that ultimately resulted in it committing suicide in containment. _\n _\nBased on evidence obtained by the Ethics Committee Review Team, it is suspected Crawford had close personal ties with Dr. Byrnes.

Initially, these sessions made very little progress, as SCP-8980 had a strong negative reaction towards the therapy process. This continued throughout the month. However, an eventual initial breakthrough was achieved on September 26th, 2005, when SCP-8980 began to speak with Dr. Crawford in a meaningful capacity for the first time.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **[BEGIN EXCERPT]**\n\n----\n\n//Extraneous information removed. Prior to this excerpt, Dr. Crawford attempted several times to initiate productive conversation with SCP-8980, which was largely unreciprocated.//\n\n//Dr. Crawford is sitting at her desk in the furnished office, while SCP-8980 is lying on a large velvet chair. Dr. Crawford has been doing miscellaneous paperwork for nearly fifteen minutes in silence, while SCP-8980 struggles to stay awake on the couch. SCP-8980's clothes and hair are both highly disheveled.//\n\n//After the fourth time, SCP-8980 snaps itself to attention, it pushes itself further up the couch, presumably to help it stay awake better.//\n\n**DR.

Lovely guy.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Oh, interesting.\n\n**DR.

Dr. Crawford returns to her paperwork, smiling.//\n\n----\n\n= **[END EXCERPT]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter waking up, SCP-8980 continued to deflect conversational attempts until the end of the session. However, over the course of multiple meetings, SCP-8980 began to engage in small talk more with Dr. Crawford, establishing some level of rapport between them. [[span class=\"bi-r\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Topics of conversation frequently included SCP-8980's current projects, novels SCP-8980 had read in the past, or other miscellaneous yet irrelevant topics.[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Violation of Privacy** — information regarding SCP-8980's progress in parapsychological counseling should be kept vague unless demonstrating an important breakthrough or highlighting an important interaction.[[/span]]\n\nWhile SCP-8980's mental state did not significantly improve for some time, SCP-8980 began to trust Dr. Crawford as the sessions progressed. This eventually led to Dr. Crawford being able to discuss SCP-8980's past, representing an important milestone in reconstructing SCP-8980's mental state.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **[BEGIN EXCERPT]**\n\n----\n\n//Extraneous information removed.

In spite of its relationship with Dr. Crawford improving, its mental state appeared to remain stagnant outside of sessions and its productivity was still relatively low, though still within minimum acceptable boundaries for continued employment.\n\nDuring the months prior, SCP-8980 refused to address Head Researcher Byrnes during routine interviewing unless explicitly required to, resulting in very little progress in treating its anomalous condition. In spite of Dr. Byrnes attempts to minimize hostility following Incident 1, [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 clearly held him in contempt[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Inappropriate Description** — self-explanatory.[[/span]]; nonetheless, it did not engage in any additional hostilities towards any containment staff.\n\nOn November 24th, 2005, several days before Thanksgiving, Dr. Crawford made a major breakthrough in SCP-8980's case, leading to a significant improvement in SCP-8980's psychological state, which is detailed below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **[BEGIN EXCERPT]**\n\n----\n\n//Extraneous information removed.

The anomaly worked overtime for several hours per day as well, including on weekends when it was not assigned work.\n\nThis activity was noted as strange by [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]containment personnel[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]Dr. Byrnes.[[/span]], though it suddenly ceased on December 22nd, 2005, when SCP-8980's productivity returned to normal. Though it experienced slightly fewer depressive symptoms according to Dr. Crawford, its overall behavior was still considered abnormal.\n\nOn January 9th, 2006, Dr. Byrnes [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]requested and[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Missing Information** — failing to specify that the action was requested deemphasizes Dr. Byrnes' role in having the investigation performed. See following annotation.[[/span]] received permission [[span class=\"bi-g\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]from the Site-17 Containment Oversight Committee[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Passive Voice** — the use of passive voice obfuscates the origin of this action, which deflects responsibility to an unspecified party. _\n _\nIt is largely believed by the Ethics Committee Review Team that, by this point in SCP-8980's containment, this use of vague phrasing was largely intentional — even if prior infractions were accidental.[[/span]] to conduct a full audit of SCP-8980 and its containment area. [[span class=\"bi-y\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]SCP-8980 and its room were fully stripped and searched[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]**Vague Vernacular** — this phrasing obfuscates the fact that SCP-8980 was forced to undergo a strip search, including invasive medical scans for potential hazardous materials on-person. This was deemed grossly excessive by the Ethics Committee Review Team and is in [[span class=\"red-text\"]]egregious violation[[/span]] of the Foundation Code of Conduct.[[/span]], as was the remote code device used by SCP-8980 to conduct its work.\n\nAfter a careful two-day audit of all its belongings, investigative staff discovered that SCP-8980 had located and exploited an Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) in its remote work apparatus over the course of several weeks. This granted it full access to its former SCiPNet account, which granted it access to:\n\n* All its previously limited SCiPNet utilities (such as its intra-messaging systems).\n* Its secure extra-Foundational communications system.\n* The {{SCP-8980}} file itself.\n\nThroughout the latter half of December, SCP-8980 had been in direct contact with several members of Foundation staff and several sub-Veil individuals, especially its mother. Although the nature of these conversations did not violate any employee protocols, the fact that SCP-8980 was a contained anomaly made conversing with these individuals without approval expressedly prohibited. All individuals who interacted with SCP-8980 were administered [[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]Class C amnestics[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]Class C amnestics are for targeting specific memories or concepts. Class Cs are administered through two injections: a first, initial primer which places a subject in a hypnotic state to orally \"prime\" the target concepts or memories, and a second catalyst which erases correlated engrams.[[/span]].\n\nAs SCP-8980 abused its Foundation accomodations to facilitate its rule-breaking behavior, consensus from the Containment Oversight Committee concluded that SCP-8980 must either undergo amnestic therapy or have access to its remote work apparatus permanently revoked. Although SCP-8980 was initially against amnestic therapy, Dr. Crawford convinced SCP-8980 to voluntarily accept the treatment, insisting on its efficacy.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"ec\"]]\n\n= **[[span class=\"ec-title\"]]ETHICS COMMITTEE MEMORANDUM[[/span]]**\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe following is a transcript of the video and audio recording of the amnesticization of SCP-8980.

Dr. Byrnes initially mistakes the amnesthesiologist for a nurse, though she quickly corrects him.

Not like this.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:09:15 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 spends several seconds attempting to crawl away or stand up (neither of which are effective).

I have an appointment at 9:30.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:11:27 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 begins sobbing again.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Leave... leave me alone...\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:11:34 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist begins to sterilize SCP-8980's arm for the injections, causing SCP-8980 to tense its arm in fear. She spends several seconds attempting to relax it, to surprising success. SCP-8980 stops thrashing in apparent defeat, gasping and sobbing without coherency.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:12:00 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist begins application of local anesthetic.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** Alright, that should fully kick in in about two to three minutes.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:12:44 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 makes eye contact with the amnesthesiologist. Upon seeing its expression, she stops moving and watches back.\n\n**SCP-8980:** Please... please don't do this to me. You don't know who he is. Please help me. Please, let me out.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:12:52 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes does not react, but watches the pair. The amnesthesiologist glances at Byrnes, but quickly pulls away from SCP-8980.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** Look, ma'am... I'm just doing my job. I'm not going to get involved in this. Take it up with the Ethics Committee, or something.\n\n**SCP-8980:** They won't listen. Please.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:13:08 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 strains against its restraints. The amnesthesiologist glances at Dr. Byrnes again. He crosses his arms and stares at her. She turns back to SCP-8980.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** I'm not going to risk my career over a stranger. Sorry.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:13:14 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 falls back and stares ahead, crying silently. Dr. Byrnes pulls out his mobile device (in violation of his own protocols involving SCP-8980), though quickly puts it away as it appears not to turn on. Several minutes pass in silence, only broken by SCP-8980's sobs and an occasional grunt by the present guard.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:16:05 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist prepares the primer shot for amnestics administration. Presumably due to SCP-8980's general uncooperation, she opts to include a quick-acting light sedative agent in accordance with amnestics guidelines.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:16:59 AM |[[/span]] After preparing all the materials, she approaches SCP-8980 and sterilizes the injection site once again. SCP-8980 begins hyperventilating and struggling again. Dr. Byrnes watches in silence.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:17:13 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist begins the injection, and SCP-8980 begins screaming. The amnesthesiologist ignores it.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:17:43 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist finishes, and pulls the empty injection from SCP-8980. SCP-8980 stops struggling, but is still visibly shaking and crying.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** There, all done. (//To Dr. Byrnes//) It'll take a few minutes until she's ready for priming. You shouldn't say anything once she's ready until we're done, because it could have some nasty side effects. That means absolute silence; if you say anything besides the primers, we have to let the shot wear off and reschedule. Got it?\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Understood.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** Good. I'll let you know when she's ready with a thumbs up.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:18:00 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 spends several minutes shivering and sobbing as the shot begins to take effect. Dr. Byrnes watches SCP-8980 in silence, while the amnesthesiologist files relevant paperwork. \n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:21:51 AM |[[/span]] As the primer begins to spread through SCP-8980, it redoubles its efforts to push against its restraints; however, its left arm is completely paralyzed, and its speech heavily slurs.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:23:24 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's mouth begins to twitch uncontrollably while it glances wildly around the room. Its ability to move its other arm and legs quickly fades, as SCP-8980's thrashing and shivering slowly ceases.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:26:55 AM |[[/span]] After several additional minutes of the agent spreading throughout its body, SCP-8980 is rendered nearly immobile, only able to breathe lightly and control its eyes. Its jaw is slack open; saliva begins to drip down the side of its mouth as its eyes unfocus and refocus repeatedly, still glancing wildly around in terror.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:27:34 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist checks her watch, then glances at SCP-8980. She motions a thumbs up to Dr. Byrnes, though he does not notice at first, as he is watching SCP-8980 intently without expression.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:27:40 AM |[[/span]] Irritated, the amnesthesiologist gets up and walks over to Dr. Byrnes, who jerks up suddenly when he spots her approaching. She stops and gives the thumbs up, which prompts Dr. Byrnes to approach SCP-8980. Its eyes solely focus on him.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:27:53 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist puts on her Foundation-grade earmuffs to ensure she is not exposed to classified information, as per standard protocol. SCP-8980 appears to notice this, and its mouth begins to twitch repeatedly. The amnesthesiologist watches in silence.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:00 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes pulls out a folded paper (presumably a refresher on administering amnestic primers), and begins to prime SCP-8980 for amnesticization. He smiles.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Memory. Performing Arbitrary Code Execution Exploit in containment.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:07 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's left eye spasms.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Concept. Arbitrary Code Execution Exploits.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:12 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's mouth twitches, and its eyes dart to the amnesthesiologist. The amnesthesiologist watches with disinterest. It repeatedly attempts to vocalize, but it makes no coherent sound besides low grunts and moans.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Memory. Contact with your coworkers during containment.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:19 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 does not have any sudden reactions, though its eyes meet with Dr. Byrnes again. Dr. Byrnes looks down towards the paper he is holding again.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Memory. Contact with your mother during containment.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:25 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's right arm twitches repeatedly, and SCP-8980's eyes dart around the room panickedly.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:30 AM |[[/span]] After several seconds, SCP-8980's eyes begin to leak tears, which slowly trail down to mix with the saliva building on its chin.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:36 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes spends several seconds reading the paper he is holding.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Concept. Using your remote work apparatus to breach containment.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:43 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's mouth twitches again momentarily. It begins moaning for a few seconds, futilely attempting to vocalize.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:47 AM |[[/span]] After several seconds of silence with no activity, Dr. Byrnes looks up and makes direct eye contact with SCP-8980. He holds its gaze; its eyes widen, and it immediately stops making sound.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:49 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes looks sideways towards the recording device, and then back towards the amnesthesiologist, who largely does not react. He then turns back to the anomaly.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:53 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes leans directly above SCP-8980, close enough that his face is inches away from SCP-8980. Its jaw begins to spasm. Neither of them break eye contact, though SCP-8980's breathing becomes extremely labored. \n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:28:58 AM |[[/span]] After several further moments of silence, Dr. Byrnes smiles, then speaks.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Concept. [DATA CORRUPTED].\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:29:03 AM |[[/span]] The video and audio feed severely distort for several seconds. SCP-8980 is violently spasming, and its eyes are entirely unfocused. Its breathing is highly irregular. Dr. Byrnes is no longer leaning.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:29:04 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist jerks up and instinctively reaches for her earmuffs; however, after looking towards and remembering the recording device, she hesitantly puts her hand down again. \n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:29:36 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980 returns to an inert state after several seconds, though its mouth continually twitches and it continually moans loudly. Dr. Byrnes turns towards the amnesthesiologist and gives her a thumbs up, signifying the priming phase is complete.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:29:42 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist gets up and begins to prepare the second injection, including sterilizing SCP-8980's arm again. SCP-8980 appears to recuperate from the sudden spasm as its eyes refocus, and it begins crying more intensely, making direct eye contact with Dr. Byrnes despite him now looking away.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:30:15 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist finishes preparing the second shot, and approaches SCP-8980 hesitantly.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:30:20 AM |[[/span]] As she bends down to administer the catalyst shot, the amnesthesiologist locks eyes with SCP-8980, whos gaze now stares directly at her. Its mouth twitches intensely. She looks back to Dr. Byrnes, who nods sternly. She sighs.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:30:34 AM |[[/span]] The amnesthesiologist injects SCP-8980 with the catalyst. \n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:30:39 AM |[[/span]] SCP-8980's mouth stops twitching.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:31:12 AM |[[/span]] As the amnestic activates, SCP-8980's consciousness slowly fades, causing its eyes to completely unfocus and its head to fall limp. The amnesthesiologist sighs again.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** Alright, it's done now. She should wake up in a few hours.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** Thank you, Doctor.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:31:19 AM |[[/span]] Silence. The guard begins to remove SCP-8980's restraints, as Dr. Byrnes and the amnesthesiologist stare at each other.\n\n**AMNESTHESIOLOGIST:** ...If I may ask, what caused her to—\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** (//Interrupting//) That information is strictly classified.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:31:24 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes glances at his watch.\n\n**DR. BYRNES:** I'm late for my appointment because of how long you took, so I'll be leaving. The guard will handle the anomaly. Have a nice day.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:31:32 AM |[[/span]] Dr. Byrnes exits the room as the guard finishes unbinding SCP-8980.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:32:01 AM |[[/span]] The guard picks up SCP-8980's limp body, throws it over their shoulder, and exits the room. The amnesthesiologist at first does not react, but in short order snaps herself to attention, and begins to pack her things.\n\n[[span class=\"logtime\"]]9:38:29 AM |[[/span]] As the amnesthesiologist finishes, she glances at the recording device. She shudders, scratches a discolored patch on her arm, then exits the room.\n\n----\n\n= **[END TRANSCRIPT]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nA full dissection of Dr. Byrnes's actions is attached at the end of this review, and as such will not be discussed in-depth here. Nonetheless, it is clear that Dr. Byrnes abused the protections assigned to the Head Researcher position to purposefully amnesticize SCP-8980 of non-essential concepts and memories. The effects of this can be seen in the following log in the SCP-8980 file.\n\n@@ @@\n\nOne instance of this (at timestamp 9:28:53) appears to have been corrupted beyond restoration. This effect is believed to have been caused by SCP-8980's anomalous capabilities, though this is the first and only time a recorder has been directly affected by the anomaly.\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe amnesthesiologist — whose identity has been purposefully obfuscated by the Review Team due to complete Code of Conduct compliance — was later identified and interviewed. This unfortunately did not yield significant results, as it was revealed that she had been chronically abusing amnestics on herself to erase her own traumatic memories. Nonetheless, she was able to point out that she submitted a complaint to the office of the Site-17 Ethics Committee Liaison a day after the incident, though the report was not received as the position was vacant at the time.\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe identity of the guard — although wearing SCRAMBLE equipment in accordance with Foundation guidelines — was requested from Site-17's administration as information may possibly be gleaned from them. Although Site-17 administration complied with the request, subsequent investigation showed that the guard — Geraldo H. Rodriguez, a then-36-year-old male — was killed in a containment breach in 2013. Although the Ethics Committee obtained a warrant to search his belongings from the O5 Council, no evidence relevant to the case has been found.\n\n@@ @@\n\nThe corrupted concept erased by Dr. Byrnes could not be rederived by the Ethics Committee Review Team.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n\n[[span class=\"bi-b\"]][[a href=\"javascript:void(0)\"]]**Addendum 9:**[[/a]][[/span]][[span class=\"bi-popup\"]]The Ethics Committee Review Team is attaching an annotation to remind reviewing personnel that this addendum was presented without the above context.[[/span]] Post-Amnesticization Depression\n\nFollowing SCP-8980's amnesticization, its mental state significantly deteriorated to the point of it not fulfilling any of its quotas, nor responding to any work inquiries.

As per Foundation succession standards, Dr. Morgan McPharrell assumed the role of Head Researcher for SCP-8980 on December 15th of that year.\n\nOn January 5th, 2015, Dr. McPharrell conducted SCP-8980's routine yearly testing, as per its Special Containment Procedures. After several rounds of testing, Dr. McPharrell discovered that SCP-8980 possessed none of its stated anomalous properties. This was confirmed after several additional rounds of testing.\n\nOn January 8th, 2015, Dr. McPharrell conducted an interview with SCP-8980. During the duration of the interview, he noted that the entity possessed several alarming features, including extreme apathy, severe technophobia, and a lack of social awareness. After spending several days confirming SCP-8980 was directly and indirectly subject to longterm abuse and negligence, Dr. McPharrell filed a formal Ethics Committee complaint regarding the treatment of SCP-8980 under Dr. Christopher Byrnes. After obtaining a warrant of investigation from the O5 Council, a formal investigation was launched on January 14th, 2015.\n\nAs of January 19th, 2015, SCP-8980 began rehabilitation and reintegration into the wider Foundation workplace under direct supervision from Dr. Morgan McPharrell. SCP-8980 is pending reclassification to Neutralized.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n{{End of document.}}\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n{{Loading attachment...}}\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"ec-comments\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ SCP-8980 Investigation Summary [[span style=\"color: grey; font-size: 80%;\"]]| May 5th, 2015[[/span]]\n\n++++++ Results Presented by Ronald Roberts (Leader), Linda M. N. Brown, Flora Marinos, & Amber H. Goldstein\n\n----\n\nThe prior document has been fully reviewed and annotated as of May 4th, 2015. It is presented in full for contextual purposes.\n\nBased on both SCP-8980's documentation and external resources found by the Review Team, it is clear that **__Dr. Christopher Byrnes__** engaged in severe, deliberate abuse of an anomaly over an extended period of time. Although extensive, a full list of irrefutable violations consists of the following:\n\n* Misuse of formal position to extort, manipulate, or otherwise negatively affect other members of Foundation Staff. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 1, Chapter 7 § 1)[[/span]]\n* Failure to recuse himself from sensitive matters in which he had clear conflicts of interest. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 1, Chapter 7 § 3)[[/span]]\n* Misuse of official documentation to present false or inaccurate information. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 5, Chapter 3 § 1.1)[[/span]]\n* Intentional obfuscation of details in official documentation. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 5, Chapter 3 § 2)[[/span]]\n* Abuse of an anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2)[[/span]]\n* Sexual harassment of an anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2 § 1.5)[[/span]]\n* Gross negligence of an anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2 § 2.4.1)[[/span]]\n* Extreme testing of a sentient anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2 § 2.6)[[/span]]\n* Deliberate intimidation of an anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2 § 5.3)[[/span]]\n* Public disclosure of private information of an anomaly. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 2, Chapter 2 § 7)[[/span]]\n* Gross misuse of amnestics. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 7, Chapter 1 § 2)[[/span]]\n* Violation of prior Ethics Committee Stop Order. [[span class=\"logtime\"]](Title 9, Chapter 1 § 7)[[/span]]\n\nAlthough these violations alone are egregious and numerous, they likely do not represent the full breadth of infractions committed by Dr. Byrnes, as several could not be proven, and further violations were likely committed in the containment of other anomalies. Although the Review Team has attempted to identify the full scope and scale of Dr. Byrnes's infractions, this investigation has largely been impeded by Site-17 Administration's non-compliance and the O5 Council's unwillingness to expand its investigative warrant.\n\nUnfortunately, Dr. Byrnes cannot be sentenced. Due to the Ethical Post-Amnesticization Punishment Ruling by the O5 Council in 1995, Dr. Byrnes cannot be punished for actions taken prior to major amnesticization, as he would not be able to remember committing them.\n\n**__Dr. Rachel Steele__** was also found to be in violation of the Foundation Code of Conduct, particularly Chapter 2, Section 2 § 2.4.1 concerning gross negligence of an anomaly. As she was not the head researcher and did not possess prior infringements on her record, the Review Team recommends the standard escalation of docking one week of pay, as well as requiring three months of remedial therapy.\n\nAlthough **__Dr. Morgan McPharrell__** was found to be in violation of the Foundation Code of Conduct (similar to Dr. Steele), it is the consensus of the Review Team (2/4) that Dr. McPharrell should not receive an infringement on his record.\n\n**__Dr. Nadine Crawford__** has already been removed from Foundation staff. For more information, consult [# Case ID #07082012-9932-T].\n\n----\n\nAs a result, the SCP-8980 Review Team would like to make the following recommendations for future Ethics Committee Proposals to rectify this case:\n\n# Provide monetary compensation to SCP-8980 for the abuse it suffered under Dr. Christopher Byrnes.\n# Provide free parapsychological counseling to SCP-8980 for the remainder of its tenure at the Foundation.\n# Request the Fire Suppression Department to soft-monitor SCP-8980 in order to properly reintegrate it back into the Foundation's workplace environment.\n\nAdditionally, some structural changes would be beneficial to propose to the wider Foundation as a whole as Foundation Motions:\n\n# File a Foundation Motion to require Ethics Committee Review of any staff member who wishes to undergo amnestic therapy upon retirement.\n# File a Foundation Motion to expand the ability of the Ethics Committee to promote Liaisons to sites without Site Director approval.\n# Request an investigative warrant from the O5 Council to investigate all of Site-17's administration.\n\nFurther inquiries and questions should be forwarded to Review Team Lead Ronald Roberts.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Chairman Odongo Tejani** [[span class=\"logtime\"]]| May 5th, 2015 - 01:02 AM LOCAL[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"ec-comment\"]]\nThank you for your invaluable efforts in this case, Roberts.

(61-2-4)\n * A separate vote (33-22-12) decided in favor of an allotment of $470,000 USD, as opposed to the standard for similar cases. Primary concern raised is the recent budget deficit and low-profile of the case. \n* **Proposal 2 (Counseling):** Passed. (64-1-3)\n * This is the standard practice; those voting against raised concerns that SCP-8980's experience with Dr. Crawford may result in additional traumatizing experiences for it.\n* **Proposal 3 (Fire Suppression):** Passed. (38-29)\n * Outcome was largely irrelevant; the Fire Suppression Department was already monitoring SCP-8980's case for several years. All actions taken by the FSD have been reviewed and deemed within specified ethical limits.\n\nFoundation Motions 1 and 3 have been passed; however, Motion 2 has been rejected (33-34), as opposition cites concerns that this policy would disrupt power balance between the O5 Council, the Ethics Committee, and the Site Directors Committee, unnecessarily inflaming tensions across the Foundation.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Chairman Odongo Tejani** [[span class=\"logtime\"]]| September 2nd, 2015 - 01:00 AM LOCAL[[/span]]\n[[div class=\"ec-comment\"]]\n\nI am adding an additional comment to this thread to indicate the previously-mentioned Foundation Motions were filed for vote during this year's Foundation Committees Conference. The results of the vote are as follows:\n\n* **Motion 1 (Amnestics Amendment):** Denied. Passed by the O5 Council (10-3), but vetoed by the Site Directors Committee (68-109).\n * O5 Council majority opinion expressed approval for the amendment, citing no concerns.\n * Site Directors Committee majority opinion expressed disapproval for the amendment, claiming the motion was an effort by the Ethics Committee to take power from the Site Directors.\n\n* **Motion 2 (Site-17 Investigation Warrant):** Denied by the O5 Council (6-7).\n * Minority opinion expressed interest in ensuring Site-17 was fully complying with the ethical guidelines of the Foundation.\n * Majority opinion solely commented the following: \"Site-17 is doing its job as intended.\"\n\nUnfortunately, it seems our hands are tied once again. I will be keeping this case open indefinitely in the event any future progress is made in investigating any of Dr. Byrnes's other activities. \n\nI want to once again extend my gratitude to our incredible review team for their hard work in bringing this case to light. Your efforts are invaluable in keeping the Foundation a safe place, and your work is incredibly appreciated.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= {{This thread has been automatically soft-locked due to inactivity (2 YEARS).

At the very least, I have a few new things to report.\n\nFirst, the new program you recommended for counselling wasn't effective. Two minutes in and she immediately suffered another panic attack, and the second go around was even worse. At the present rate, we're going to run out of new therapists at 17 in about a month. Long-distance is basically infeasible until we can stabilize her technophobia enough to get her on a computer for more than an hour at time.\n\nIn terms of work, she's still pretty much incapable of doing anything productive. I can't really blame her for this one; doing a division's worth of labor every week for a third of your life will absolutely burn you out. But I can't get Director Thompson off my case unless her work gets done, so I've bit the bullet and just started doing her work for her. It's absolutely agonizing to have to work overtime every single day, but I can't really do much about it — Director Graham's already denied my transfer request. At least I get overtime pay.\n\nFinally, her condition in general... she's still mostly the same, but I've made a little bit of progress. For one, she's finally stopped compulsively calling me \"sir\". It was a bit funny at first, but it got weird really quick, so I'm glad we can finally move past that. The random bouts of screaming haven't stopped though, and neither has her tendency to stare at me while I sleep, but they've become less frequent. If there's any hope for progress, it's in that — though if we're only seeing this kind of progress two years in, we've still got a ways to go.\n\nI wouldn't dare tell anyone else this, but... I think I'm really starting to resent her, Flora. I've been de facto co-opted into being her full-time caretaker, and frankly she's being a real pain in my ass. Between doing her work and chores for her //and// dealing with her severe neuroses all day every day, she's completely worn me down to the point that I can't even respect her as a person anymore, much less a coworker. I hate to say it, but I'm honestly this close to just calling it quits and letting her rot. I can't do this. Something's gonna give.\n\nSending this email is probably the dumbest thing I'll ever do in my career, but I really needed to get this off my chest. I know you said the Committee's hands were tied, but if there's anything you can do, //please// help me out here. I'm not sure how much longer I can handle this psychotic woman.\n\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid rgb(var(--ec-popup-color));\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWith Regards,\nDr. Morgan McPharrell\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n...\n\n@@ @@\n\n{{End of file.
