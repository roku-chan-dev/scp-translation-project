The challenge is simple; use [[[tag-search | Tag Search]]] to find an article with the daily tag/s, read it, and (optionally) draw a scene/moment/character from it that you enjoyed! At the end of the month, the Community Outreach team will be gathering several of the art pieces that we liked and compile them onto a page on the Wiki to share with our user base. Readers and artists of any and all mediums are invited to join and celebrate Sciptember with us!\n\n[[image sciptember2022.png]]\n[[=]]\n+ If you're interested in viewing this year's art, please check it out [[[sciptember-2022-art|here!]]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Uncle Nicolini]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** sciptember2022.png\n> **Name:** sciptember2022.png\n> **Author:** [[*user UncertaintyCrossing]]\n> **License:** CC BY SA 3.0\n\n\n=====\n\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
