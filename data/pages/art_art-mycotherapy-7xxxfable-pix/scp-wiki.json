Makes me melancholic. Reminds me of all those people I met while camping as a child who I'll never see again.\n\nI love the characters and basically all of my friends who don't keep up with SCP stuff that I've shown this article had roughly the same reaction about Carteckan & Sias's drawings and the ending. It's good I don't wanna spoil anything else. Just read it.\n\nOne thing though, I will say I am confused as to how Sias has an adult daughter at 30 but I mean. There's a lot of reasons that could be, more so in an SCP article but it did occupy a few brain cells through the whole article because there is not explanation.\n\nidk why but my brain went straight to cryogenic freezing even though there's a dozen less high sci-fi explanations that would make significantly more sense being slipped in without an explanation.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
