Medical staff mill around them, checking and double-checking the connections, the equipment, monitoring heart rate, breathing, temperature, brain activity. Thirteen IV bags drip anti-seizure medication and synthetic psychotropics into thirteen veins. Twenty-six eyes flit back and forth beneath twenty-six eyelids in an approximation of deep and dream-filled sleep.\n\nGreen across the board. No complications, though Three pissed himself again. The technicians haven’t found a better solution than a hospital gown and a plastic sheet.\n\nThirteen men, in the darkness of their minds’ eyes, reach out their hands towards thirteen doors, and with thirteen steps forward they enter Site-00.\n\nThe thirteen doors open simultaneously onto a mahogany pavilion in the center of a wide, shallow pond choked with lotus flowers and cat-tails. Dawn streaks the world with gold and blue and pink, a moment frozen in thought. Smiling statues of bodhisattvas meditate among the vine-choked ruins. When they pass back through those doors the image will vanish as if it had never been, and they will never find it again.\n\nNine men and four women sit down at the table, wearing now the faces and bodies of the dead and buried. The oneiric treachery of images prevents them from ever seeing each other as anything besides their own reflected thoughts, and so it was decided for the sake of coherence and continuity that they would adopt the guises of the original thirteen. The signatories of the FCC endure beyond their own deaths.\n\nTwo other men are waiting for them there at the table, blurred at the edges and stuttering with dropped frames. They remain awake in the material, sitting in empty rooms at empty tables in front of //camerae somniorum// struggling to maintain connection. They see only thirteen faint, shadowy hazes intruding into the peripheral vision of their drug-induced synaesthesia\n\nAgent Dagonet sits at his stenograph, appearing as he always does: Napalm scarring, drab olive flak jacket, black hair gone to white at the temples. St. Michael on his arm, sword aloft, calligraphic letters along an unfurling scroll declaring //Vengeance arms again His red right hand.// Overseers come and go, but Dagonet remains.\n\nSitting next to him, Dr. Robert Montauk fusses with illusory papers to keep himself focused.\n\nThe meeting begins.\n\n**One:** This High-Priority Session of the Overseer Council is hereby called to order at 0900 Mountain Savings Time on the Fifth of September 1986, for consideration of a proposed containment method for Item #231. Agent Dagonet, please proceed with roll.\n\nDagonet calls out the numbers, and thirteen presents echo in turn.\n\n**Dagonet:** All councillors present via tele-operation, Chairman. \n\n**One:** Then we have quorum. //Capimus, retinemus, prohibemus.//\n\n**Two through Thirteen:** //Capimus, retinemus, prohibemus.//\n\n**One:** At the recommendation of Overseer Six, the chair recognizes senior researcher Dr. Robert Montauk of Containment Division. The floor is yours, Dr. Montauk. You may proceed when ready.\n\nRobert Montauk – pudgy, balding, quiet, kindly old Bob – stands up and scrunches his face for a moment. He places the first sheet of plastic on the projector, flips it the right way round with a brief “op”, clears his throat nervously, and begins.\n\nForty-five minutes elapse as he speaks to an empty meeting room in the Arlington office of Specialized Corporate Products. He walks the councilors through each step of the procedure. He details the necessary preparations, the resource requirements, the logistics, the points of potential failure, the reasoning and purpose behind each choice and each component. His nervousness has intruded on his ordinarily sleepy, calming cadence. He tells them that the procedure is safe. Minimally invasive. That it was designed to be as humane as possible while still meeting the requirements. That in the scope of human suffering it contains no cruelties beyond those that have been endured time and time again.\n\nHe promises them that it is only temporary. That a better solution will be found. That when it is done, a battery of amnestic treatments and memetic conditioning will be able to erase every trace of the procedure, leaving it less substantial than a dream.\n\nNot a single lie falls from his lips in the entire forty-five minutes: he believes every word.\n\n**Montauk:** I, uh, yield the floor.\n\n**One:** Thank you, Dr. Montauk. The floor is open for comment and questions.\n\nSilence reigns. Thirteen men consider their options.\n\n**Seven:** So that’s it, then.\n\n**Nine:** An obscenity.\n\n**Five:** Are we certain that there’s no way of dispelling the original ritual?\n\n**Montauk:** Yes, unfortunately. Trying to defuse a ritual anomaly without an appropriate counter-rite will result in failure, and we still don’t have any way of predicting the consequences of ritual failure.\n\n**Eight:** How long would it take to develop a counter-rite?\n\n**Montauk:** I, ah, I don’t know. We’d be starting from nothing, the //Book of the Year// doesn’t contain anything of that nature. A few of the grimoires have some basic cancellation rites, but nothing for a ritual of this scope We’re still just beginning to understand thaumaturgic principles...\n\n**One:** What’s the status of the other six?\n\n**Montauk:** I’m sorry?\n\n**One:** The other six subjects.\n\n**Montauk:** Oh, yes, right. They’re in similar shape to 7. Malnutrition, long term neglect, repeated physical and sexual abuse. Reading level far below age standards.\n\n**One:** Are any of them pregnant, Dr. Montauk. What is the scope of the threat?\n\n**Montauk:** 7 is the only pregnancy detected so far. The other six are still significant to the original ritual, but they aren’t pregnant.\n\n**Ten:** What about the ultrasounds? Did they give us anything more?\n\n**Six:** Only that the fetus is in line with the description given by 089 – it appears human.\n\n**One:** Dr. Montauk, can you confirm this?\n\n**Montauk:** Yes, uh, Overseer Six is correct. The ultrasounds depict a human fetus between fifteen and seventeen weeks old.\n\n**One:** And were there any anatomical abnormalities?\n\n**Montauk:** Uh, yes. A rare one – not anomalous, but rare. Fetus //in fetu//. A mass of developmentally-complex solid tissues forming either from a highly aberrant differentiated teratoma or the partial absorption of a parasitic twin. It is, ah, a very rare condition and often fatal to the fetus. At this point in development, especially considering the mother’s age and the lack of prenatal care, it’s surprising that a miscarriage hasn’t occurred.\n\n**Ten:** But there was nothing else? No anomalous properties? Did you expose it to a Kant Counter?\n\n**Three:** We can’t make decisions on Hume measurements alone, it’s still-\n\n**Montauk:** Three times, yes, to go with the ultrasounds. One positive result, and two inconclusive – kept swinging between negative and positive. The exact readings are on page fourteen of the summary document. The positive result was extremely high, which-\n\n**Two:** I thought high Hume ratings meant the local reality was less anomalous.\n\n**Thirteen:** That was the outline provided in the original white paper; subsequent iterations of the theory have proposed an ascending measurement system. \n\n**Montauk:** Correct, an M3 Kant Counter was used with ascending measurements. The positive result was in the same range as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-might-have-been SCP-343]; the inconclusive readings were lower but still significant. \n\n**Five:** Would an abortion be feasible at this stage?\n\n**Montauk:** For a normal pregnancy under these circumstances, yes, I would recommend an abortion. Carrying the fetus to term will likely result in death, even without factoring in the risk of the cancer cells achieving metastasis and transferring to the mother. But when dealing with an unknown anomaly, I’m less certain.\n\n**Five:** Then what’s stopping us?\n\n**Montauk:** We, uh, simply don’t know enough about the anomaly. Or how it would react to attempted termination. There’s, ah, there’s this report from the UN Paranormal Security Council, I added an excerpt to the summary document, about ontokinetic individuals and the dangers they present when-\n\n**Two:** I’m sorry, could you repeat that?\n\n**Montauk:** Mm? Oh, ontokinetics. Reality-modification. I think we used to call them NASCENT GRENDEL? Is that right? The PSC calls them Type Greens. \n\n**Thirteen:** Correct. The designation was NEPTUNE EGRET from 1942 to 1953 and NASCENT GRENDEL from 1953 to present.\n\n**Two:** Thank you. Please continue, doctor.\n\n**Montauk:** Right, yes – the Hume readings we took indicate that 7-b possesses some manner of latent reality-manipulating properties, and ontokinetics can be extremely dangerous even when their abilities have limited manifestation, and...did I add it to the packet? Yes, I did. LTE-0334-Lovelock-Green. Attempted termination of an ontokinetic fetus resulted in the death of six PSC task force members and twenty-two civilians – automatic self-preservation response. This is the best-documented incident, but there are certainly more that have occurred on smaller scales.\n\n//Far away, in an abandoned apartment in Kiev, there is a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1782 hole in the wall in the bottom of the floor].//\n\n**Five:** Do we know when that response goes active?\n\n**Montauk:** Ah, no. No, we don’t. Ontokinetics is still very poorly understood. Much of the activity in humans involves the thalamus and amygdala, which normally take some time to develop but…\n\n**Five:** Go on.\n\n**Montauk:** But there are observed incidents of non-human ontokinetics from species with nervous systems much less developed than a first-trimester fetus. So...we don’t know. By the time we could know, it would already be demonstrating effects, and it would be too late. \n\n**Nine:** Do we have any explanation for why it hasn’t demonstrated any ontokinetic effects yet?\n\n**Montauk:** Without a triggering stimulus, most ontokinetics don’t manifest abilities until they are four or five, and...and it’s possible that it is hiding the evidence of its own abilities, removing any awareness of it from the minds of any observers. We don’t have enough data.\n\n**Twelve:** I believe Doctor Marness in the Memetics Division has been studying a similar phenomenon, I recommend that we reach out to his team and-\n\n**Thirteen:** No one by that name has ever worked in the Memetics Division.\n\n**Twelve:** Oh, yes- yes, you’re right. I’m sorry, I don’t know where that came from. I meant Dr. Burgess.\n\n**One:** Dr. Burgess has not produced meaningful evidence for the existence of antimemetic anomalies. He is not relevant to the matter at hand.\n\n**Four:** Are you fucking kidding me? Burgess is a crank because he’s got no evidence, and yet we’re chatting about this procedure like it’s already decided without a single fucking shred of proof.\n\n**Six:** Dr. Montauk has provided us with ample evidence that-\n\n**Four:** Fuck you, Six. There’re no active ontokinetics, we can’t see anything anomalous on the ultrasounds, the Kant counter won’t give us a consistent reading – you’re basing all of this on one statement from a talking statue. You are proposing //raping a child// to contain a threat you can’t even fucking prove!\n\n**Thirteen:** Point of order, disruption of Council session. \n\n**One:** Point well taken. \n\n**Four:** Fuck all of you.\n\n**Six:** It’s quite all right. Four has brought up a pertinent issue, and he is well within his right to play the hypocrite at this table. I am certain that the victims of 352 will graciously understand why he has suddenly decided that //this// is a line he will not cross.\n\n**Four:** Eat shit.\n\n**One:** Further disruption will result in censure, Overseer Four.\n\n**Six:** 089, whether it is the cause or the prophet of catastrophe, has never provided false information to any of its keepers. It will dress the truth in metaphor, but it will give us the truth. Dr. Montauk has provided us with the information he has available, and it aligns with the message we received. I invited him to speak because I believe that his analysis is accurate and that his proposal is the correct course of action.\n\n**Nine:** And what brought you to that conclusion? Your confidence seems out of proportion with the evidence presented so far.\n\n**Six:** Chairman, I request the floor for presentation of evidence in support of Dr. Montauk’s proposal.\n\n**One:** The floor is yours, Six.\n\n**Six:** Thank you.\n\nBack in the material, Overseer Six’s body takes a deep breath and he unconsciously settles into his orator’s role. A technician notes it down as a reflex response and thinks nothing more of it. \n\nGeorge collects his thoughts like stones along the creek, and begins.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=20\n|speed=120\n|float=false\n|align=center\n|width=556px\n|url=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/operation-magnolia/George_redstring.png\n|alt=alt|alt-text=Overseer 6's SCP-001 proposal\n|add-caption=false\n|caption=text\n]]\n\n**Six:** I cede the floor.\n\nDiscussion continues for another 3 hours and 53 minutes, lunch recess inclusive.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ OVERSEER COUNCIL VOTE #39-86\n\nVote to approve Procedure M110 as proposed by Dr. Robert Montauk as primary means of containment for Item #231.\n\n++++ VOTE SUMMARY\n||~ YEA  ||~ ABSTAIN  ||~ NAY  ||\n|| O5-1 ||                    ||            ||\n||            ||  O5-2                  ||  ||\n||   ||                    ||  O5-3          ||\n||            ||                    || O5-4 ||\n|| O5-5  ||                    ||            ||\n|| O5-6 ||                    ||            ||\n||            ||                    || O5-7 ||\n||   O5-8         ||                    || ||\n|| ||                    || O5-9         ||\n|| O5-10 ||                    ||            ||\n|| O5-11           ||          ||           ||\n|| ||                     ||  O5-12         ||\n|| ||  O5-13   ||           ||\n@@ @@\n||~ STATUS ||\n|| [[span style=\"font-weight: normal; font-size: 120%; color: green;\"]]APPROVED 6-5 (2 ABSTAINING)[[/span]] ||\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/11| Previous Chapter]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia-hub| Hub]]] | [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/operation-magnolia/offset/13| Next Chapter]]] >>**\n[[/=]]",
