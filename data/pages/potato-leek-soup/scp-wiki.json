Thoroughly wash between each and every layer of the leeks, as they will have plenty of dirt trapped within. Chop your leeks. Peel both cloves of garlic and crush.\n\nPeel, then dice your potatos and let them sit in a bowl of water for at least 15 minutes.\n\n----\n\n+++ Cooking\n\nIn a Dutch oven, throw in your butter and let melt at high heat. Then, add crushed cloves of garlic and your chopped leeks and let simmer for approximately 3 minutes at medium heat. Add in your potatoes and let simmer for a further minute. Then add in your salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Add in all of your chicken broth/stock. Increase the temp to bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer and add your thyme and bay leaves. Let simmer for 15 minutes.\n\nAfter 15 minutes, try to pierce the potatos with a fork. If you can pierce them with no resistance, turn off the heat. Fish out the bay leaves, and mash the soup. After fully mashed, add the whole cup of cream to the soup and mix.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[[>]]\n- Clarke Family Recipe\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe familiar scent of cooked potatoes filled the whole kitchen, only being cut by the aroma of fried onions and garlic.\n\nGrabbing two towels, he picked up the Dutch oven and moved it to the dining room. His mother hurried around, grabbing a heat-safe placemat to set the Dutch oven on. Finally, a loaf of old, pre-sliced sourdough bread was brought to the table.\n\nAnd they began to eat.\n\n\"Andy?\" she said.\n\n\"Yes?\"\n\n\"Do you want to do anything tonight?\"\n\n\"Like?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't know. Watch a movie? Play a board game? Something. Anything, really.\"\n\n\"Maybe.\"\n\n\"Heh. That's not a no!\"\n\n\"Yeah...\"\n\nTheir spoon is dipped into the soup. Andy eased the spoon into their mouth to taste it. //Hot. It is too hot.//\n\n\"This is really good.\" He stated.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Same recipe as always?\"\n\n\"Oh, you caught me!\"\n\nShe laughed.\n\n...\n\n\"Do you ever talk to your Aunt Shelly?\"\n\n\"Sometimes.\"\n\n\"How is she going along?\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n\"When was the last time you two talked?\"\n\n\"A week ago.\"\n\n\"Ah.\"\n\nA torn chunk of sourdough bread was dipped into the soup. He blew on it in a feeble attempt to cool it down before eating it.\n\n\"What about you?\"\n\n\"Hm?\"\n\n\"When was the last time you and her-\"\n\n\"Oh. A few weeks ago. Or a few months ago. You know?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nMinutes passed until the soup was gone. //Tasty, as it had always been.// He used the remaining sourdough to soak up all of the remaining soup in his bowl.\n\n\"I can take that if you're done with it.\" She said, outstretching her hand.\n\n\"It's alright.\"\n\n\"You sure?\"\n\n\"I can get it.\"\n\n\"Okay, then.\"\n\nPlates and bowls clanked against each other as they were moved to the kitchen. When he was done, he emptied the Dutch oven into boxes of Tupperware and then into the fridge.\n\nThe sink water rushed out of the faucet. He grabbed a sponge to vigorously scrub at the Dutch oven until every single speck of dirtiness was cleansed.\n\nLooking over at his mother, he saw her scrape chunks of food off of the plates into the trash can before they got crammed into the dishwasher.\n\n...\n\n\n//Tap. Tap. Tap.//\n\nFootsteps rung as Andy Clarke ascended the staircase. He rested upon his bed as he finally entered his room. Andy allowed the warmth and heat of his body to be drained by the cool, soft bedsheets he rested on.\n\nAnd yet, a light shone directly on his eyes. A turn later, Andy glanced at his curtain.\n\n//A curtain that had never quite actually fully closed.//\n\nSeveral groans later, Andy rolled over on his side away from the light. He closed his eyes and tried to sleep. After twenty-three minutes, Andy's eyes opened.\n\nAn urge overwhelmed him which drove him to grab his phone.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> I found a nice place.

Yet, at the moment, it seemed to Andy that it was the loudest sound in the world. Andy closed his eyes, drifting to sleep.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n----\n+++ Boarding Pass\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n\n||~ Flight ||~ Date ||~ Origin ||~ Destination ||~ Seat||\n|| 823 || 12/AUG/2023 || Pittsburgh, PA || Denver, CO || 17B ||\n\n**Departure:** 05:30\n\n**Passenger Name:** Andy Clarke\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThree hours. It took Andy three hours to assemble that simple, stupid desk.\n\nHe glanced over to a mattress which was fixed to the ground, accompanied by a box that contained an as-of-yet unassembled bed frame.\n\nThirsty, he reached for a cup and tried to sip out of it. //It was empty.// He left his room to go to the kitchen for more water.\n\nTap water filled the glass. Andy took one sip and nearly spat it out. Not exactly a bad taste, but rather an extremely //off// one.\n\nA year spent living in Boulder, and this would be the first time that tap water tasted bad to him. He normally didn't mind unfiltered water. He //hadn't normally// minded it, at least.\n\n...\n\nCold air rushed over him as he opened the fridge. Crisp, cool, calming air. An analysis of his fridge saw disappointment.\n\n//Two containers of cold, buttered noodles,//\n//Three eggs left in a carton,//\n//And a bottle of rum.//\n\nNot exactly a meal he envied for the fourth day in a row. So he checked his balance.\n\n[[=]]\n//$127.37//\n[[/=]]\n\nTakeout would not be an option. The money he had would have to last.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Susan:** Andy?\n\n**Andy:** Hey Mom.\n\n**Susan:** Hi!\n\n**Andy:** How are you holding up?\n\n**Susan:** Oh, you know. Just awful!\n\n**Andy:** Uh huh?\n\n**Susan:** I know it's only been a week, but it has felt like forever. Hasn't it?\n\n**Andy:** It's only been four days.\n\n**Susan:** Anyways, what are you calling me for?\n\n**Andy:** Bit of a weird question - but do you have the family recipe for potato leek soup?\n\n**Susan:** What?\n\n**Andy:** Uh, the recipe for-\n\n**Susan:** No, no. I mean- I heard you. Just... what? Why?\n\n**Andy:** Oh, I was just interested in it. I mean - I ate it the other day with you and it just tasted really great.\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I just want to know how to make it. Think it would be useful to know and whatnot.\n\n**Susan:** Well, um. Yeah! Sure. Let me find it really quick.\n\n**Andy:** Thank you.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nHorrid. It truly turned out as a horrid meal.\n\nNot when his mother made it, of course. But this was his first-ever attempt at even trying to cook. Ignore the noodles he boiled or the eggs he fried, this was a full-blown meal. His family's prized meal. A mean which he completely messed up.\n\nThe pantry revealed next-to-nothing aside from salt, pepper, butter, and garlic powder. Luckily, the grocery store was around a five-minute walk away.\n\nInside, he grabbed as much as he could remember as he hadn't bothered to write anything down.\n\n//A cheap can of dried thyme,//\n//A single, four-cup carton of chicken stock,//\n//The first six potatoes he saw,//\n//And a single head of garlic.//\n\nHis biggest pain was that he did not have or buy a vegetable peeler. Resorting to using a flimsy knife to cut off any skin or eyes, he chopped off at least a tenth of his total worth of potatoes.\n\nThe potatoes were unwashed. Before, during, and after they were prepared. Dirt which clung to the potato's skin clung to the knife, which rubbed off on the clean interiors of the potatoes as they were cut. All with the flawed reasoning that he had convinced himself of being that the potatoes would be cleaned off in the bowl of water.\n\nWhile a rough chop was called for the leeks, they were given an impatient hacking-at by Andy. No care was given to ensure that the leeks were clean. Large chunks of soil and earth remained attached to the leeks as they were finished being prepared.\n\nAt the very least, Andy didn't waste anything. He used //all// of the leeks. The roots, dried inedible leaves, and all.\n\nA realization dawned upon him at the last moment; he had no garlic crusher. Instead, he elected to use a mug to smash the garlic that was by some miracle peeled by him.\n\nWithout a Dutch oven he was left no choice other than to use a simple, standard pot. The temperature was far, //far// too high. Garlic and leeks burned the second they touched the pot. Even as he smelled smoke, he let the aromatics burn for the whole three-minutes as the recipe described before he added potatoes. Thankfully, the potatoes still had some water with them and didn't burn.\n\nWhatever little chicken stock he bought was not enough. It failed to cover all of the potatoes without even being simmered down yet.\n\nA second forgotten memory came back. He had not purchased bay leaves at the store. Pushed to the back of his mind, he added in all of the spices. For all three seasonings he used, they all were produced at such a fast speed that he had to have poured in at least twice of the seasonings that the recipe called for.\n\nUnstirred, the boiling potatoes overflowed twice after he tried to cover them.\n\nThe one thing Andy had remembered to purchase was a masher. He exerted nearly his full body weight on the masher to, unsuccessfully, grind the potatoes and leeks into chunks.\n\nAfter the fifteen minutes had passed, Andy turned off the heat and took the soup off of the burner.\n\nIt was hot. It was salty. It was peppery. It tasted charred. At times it felt like he was drinking sand. He would find long strands of poorly-chopped leeks that got stuck in his teeth. It was a struggle to choke down his pathetic excuse of a soup. While he did, he opened his phone.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Lauren\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[>]]\n> Heyyy. I just got back.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> welcome back!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> I'm going to be working most of next week, but should be free for the weekend.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> nice.\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> do you want to hang out at my apartment over the weekend?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> You have an apartment?\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> yea\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> That'd be cool.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> alright\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> Maybe Saturday after I get off work?\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> sure. I can pick you up if you'd like\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> Alright.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> see you then\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\nLeftover portions of the soup were placed in containers and then into the fridge. Even if the food was awful, he wouldn't let it go to waste.\n\nDespite his hardest attempts, he couldn't fully clean up. A residue wound up being stuck to the bottom of the pot that would never quite come off. //Likely some mix of burnt butter, garlic, and leeks.//\n\nLooking into the shopping bag, Andy remembered an impulse buy they had made.\n\n//An ice cube.//\n\nAlthough not much, it would at the very least make the tap water he hated taste cold.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Date Range:** ##transparent|..................................................## AUG/20 | AUG/26\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 200%]] Potential Earnings [[/size]]\n\n+ $457.65\n\n[[size 125%]] //Before Taxes & Deductions// [[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[size 200%]] Total Time Punched [[/size]]\n\n+ 30:01\n\n[[size 150%]] //__- View Time Punch Details -__// [[/size]]\n\n~ 21/AUG/2023 - 04:07 Hours Worked\n~ 22/AUG/2023 - 06:01 Hours Worked\n~ 24/AUG/2023 - 06:15 Hours Worked\n~ 25/AUG/2023 - 08:32 Hours Worked\n~ 26/AUG/2023 - 05:36 Hours Worked\n\n[[size 150%]] //- Hide Time Punch Details -// [[/size]]\n\n----\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAndy grabbed a backpack and hastily shoved his nametag into it. He adorned a non-company sweater and left the breakroom. He walked to the parking lot. A car horn blared as it drove in front of him.\n\n\n\"Andy!\"\n\n\"Hey.\"\n\n\"You ready to leave?\"\n\n\"Yep.\n\nAndy throws their backpack into the backseat and sits in the passenger seat.\n\n\"So how have you been?\"\n\n\"Good, good.

Just spent it here-\"\n\nThe car drives out of the parking lot.\n\n\"-and you're still down to head to my place, by the way?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Rad.\"\n\n\"How's your sister holding up?\"\n\n\"Probably good. I don't really know.\"\n\n\"Oh?\"\n\n\"We haven't really talked since the start of the summer.\"\n\n\"//Oh.//\"\n\n\"Yeah... But what about you. How's your mom hanging in there?\"\n\n\"She's getting better. Quit smoking, drinking, and all that stuff. But at this point...\"\n\n\"The damage is already done?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Jesus. Sorry for you.\n\n\"Thanks, Lauren.\"\n\n\"Ah shit.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I haven't told you yet.\"\n\n\"Told me what?\"\n\n\"I don't really go by the name 'Lauren' anymore. I started going by 'Quint' over the summer.\"\n\n\"Oh. Sorry.\"\n\n\"You're good.\"\n\n\"Where'd you get the name Quint, anyway.\"\n\n\"I saw it in an old movie.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Was it Jaws?\"\n\n\"... Yeah.\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\n...\n\n\"So... what prompted you - to start going by Quint.\"\n\n\"Do you know what being non-binary is?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"So...\"\n\n\"I'm going to take a wild fucking guess and ask if you're non-binary.\"\n\n\"Bingo. And you're chill with that?\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\nTwo car doors opened at once. Then, Andy and Quint walked into Quint's apartment.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ Potato Leek Soup\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n+++ Ingredients:\n\n* 2 Large Leeks\n* 2 Cloves of Garlic\n* 6 Large Potatos\n* 2 Tbsp Salted Butter\n* 2 Teaspoons of Salt\n* 1 Teaspoon of Black Pepper\n* 1 Cup of Cream\n* 6 Cups of Chicken Broth/Stock\n* 1 Sprig of Thyme\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 1 Teaspoon of Garlic Powder\n\n----\n\n+++ Preparation:\n\nCut your leeks at the root end and halfway up the greens and chop each leek in half.

It is quite literally the opposite of burning.\"\n\n\"To be fair- it wasn't actually while I was boiling it.\"\n\n\"Oh yeah. I assumed as such.\"\n\n\"Then why were you giving me such a hard time about burning it?\"\n\n\"Because the concept of burnt soup sounds funny.\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"You should try changing it around a bit.\"\n\n\"Changing what?\"\n\n\"The recipe. Changing the temperature and whatnot to try to avoid burning it. Each stovetop might be different from another.\"\n\n\"What if I undercook it?\"\n\n\"It's a vegetarian soup. Not like it'll kill you.\"\n\n\"I guess.\"\n\n\"I don't know. Not too much of a chef anymore. Just try to change the recipe until you find something that you like.\"\n\n\"Thanks.\"\n\n...\n\nThree times.\n\nAndy thrice checked the shopping list. Seventeen days had passed since he had first tried making the soup. This time, he had prepared a list of the //right// amount of //all the ingredients// that he needed. This included all of the tools that he //should// need. Paramount being a new, $65 Dutch oven.\n\nWith a new vegetable peeler, the skin was easily peeled off of all of the potatoes as he needed them. Roots severed and leeks bisected, Andy ran the leeks under cold water and meticulously washed out any semblance of dirt and filth before chopping them. He still came close to having accidentally severed his fingers three times.\n\nIn unison, all of his preparation saw improvement.\n\nAnd even then, with all of his preparation and care, he still forgot the garlic crusher. Rather than use an old reliable mug, he elected to merely peel and chop the garlic. He reasoned that the bigger chunks would burn slower, anyways. Which was what it was about.\n\nThe Dutch oven was placed on the stove at a medium-low heat, as Andy now wanted to carefully raise the temperature. Still-cold butter was allowed to melt in the Dutch oven. Just enough butter had been saved from making toast that morning for it. Andy would have to run to the store to get more butter for the rest of the week, later. Finally, in went the garlic and leeks. That was it - it would be important for him to get it right. A new factor Andy had learned was to frequently stir to disperse heat and prevent burning via movement.\n\nNervousness overswept him. It didn't seem like there was enough fat in the Dutch oven. Maybe it was too wide? Maybe something else went wrong? Regardless as the seconds passed it became more and more likely to him that something was going to burn.\n\nAndy looked around his kitchen. He knew he was out of butter, with all that he had left being a bottle of olive oil. Without much time to think, he let a glug of olive oil into the Dutch oven. That was it. The pot began to sputter and hiss at him as the olive oil dispersed throughout it.\n\nYet, it seemed to do the trick. The veggies weren't charred. When three minutes passed, he added in stock to deglaze the pan and ensure that any burned surfaces were completely destroyed.\n\nThe rest of the cooking time was similar to his original attempt, albeit better executed. More stock, better chunks, and better mashing all contributed. He especially placed care on the seasonings he let into the soup in order to avoid another over-seasoned mess.\n\nWhen the soup was done, he turned off the burner and served it in a bowl. By this point, Andy knew that he had to wait for the soup to cool down. As he waited in anticipation, he made a call.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n**Susan:** Hey Andy. What's up?\n\n**Andy:** Not much. Just calling back to ask about the soup.\n\n**Susan:** What about it?\n\n**Andy:** Just the recipe you sent me.\n\n**Susan:** Yeah?\n\n**Andy:** Are you sure you sent me the right recipe? Right ratios, cooking time, and whatnot?\n\n**Susan:** Um. Yeah? I'm pretty sure.\n\n**Andy:** Huh.\n\n**Susan:** Is something wrong with it?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, no. It's just... I don't know.\n\n**Susan:** Well, I can double-check it. It might just be something on your end; lack of experience or whatnot. I ought to've taught you how to make it when you were here.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah...\n\n**Susan:** But I guess that means that you should visit me sometime soon, huh?\n\n**Andy:** Yep. Soon.\n\n**Susan:** You got a plan figured out yet?\n\n**Andy:** Not yet. But - could you just send me the recipe again? Double-check that it's the right one.\n\n**Susan:** Of course.\n\n**Andy:** I think it is the correct one. But it's just like... better to confirm it. You know?\n\n**Susan:** Yeah. I'll send it to you again.\n\n**Andy:** Thanks.\n\n**Susan:** Love you.\n\n**Andy:** Love you.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nHe waited, waited, waited. A wait for the soup to finally cool down. Once the wait had passed, he sipped his first bite of the soup. It was a great improvement of the first, truly. Yet it still didn't taste quite //right...//\n\nPresentable, sure. If he had been able to eat the first soup, this would be easy. But it still just tasted off, for whatever reason.\n\nBefore he knew it, the soup was gone. Immediately followed by him storing the soup in his fridge.\n\nAnd then came the dishes, utensils, and other implements that all sat around the kitchen. All of them, dirty.\n\nAndy pondered simply deciding to store them in the dishwasher, out of his sight and mind as they were roughly cleaned. Then he remembered his childhood, how often he pointed out dirt and residue on dishes only for his mother to dismiss him, claiming that he had OCD and was making a deal out of nothing.\n\nSo he got to work. It took nearly an hour, but he did it. All of the dishes were scrubbed clean of their sin by the time he was done.\n\nHis phone read //11:47 P.M.//. Which meant it was time for him to visit Quint and watch a movie.\n\n...\n\nQuint pressed a button on their remote. It activated the television. While the streaming service loaded, Quint looked through their fridge.\n\n\"You want anything?\"\n\n\"Nah.\"\n\nThe fridge was then closed.\n\n\"I'm going to microwave some popcorn. You sure you don't want any?\"\n\n\"You know what? Fine.\"\n\n\"Heh.\"\n\nA single bag of popcorn was placed in the microwave. A few minutes passed before it was ready, at which point Quint tried to hand the bag to Andy.\n\n\"I'll wait.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"It's only a few minutes.\"\n\n\"Okay!\"\n\nWhen the second bag was ready, it was granted to Andy. He was joined by Quint as they jumped over the couch next to Andy.\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nA button on the remote was clicked. The opening credits of //The Thing// played.\n\nAt first, black completely filled the screen. Pure, empty black which was then broken by the opening credits of the movie. When the credits finished, fifty-seven stars littered the screen.\n\nOne of the stars transformed into a spaceship that zoomed toward the camera and then to Earth. The spaceship landed in a cold, desolate land also known as Antartica.\n\n\n...\n\nThe film ended with a shot of a bright fire which had engulfed the entirety of the facility, one that would inevitably burn it to the ground.\n\nA facility, built long before, soon to be nothing.\n\n\"What a movie.\" Andy remarked.\n\n\"I know, right?\"\n\n\"I don't know why I didn't see it sooner.\"\n\n\"It's probably my favorite movie, honestly.\"\n\n\"Yeah. I see why.\"\n\nFixation overwhelmed him as the final seconds of the movie played. Specifically, he paid attention to just how bright the fire was. How it made a beacon which shone in an otherwise empty, dark, and baren landscape.\n\n\"Do you know what time it is?\"\n\nHe checked his phone.\n\n\"One fifty-three A.M.\"\n\n\"Jesus.\"\n\n\"Kinda getting late.\"\n\n\"Yeah... You know. Only a //bit// late.\"\n\n\"I should probably start heading back. I need to fix up my sleep schedule.\"\n\n\"That is a good idea, yeah.\"\n\nThe pair stood. Quint stretched as Andy checked his phone. While Quint stretched, they saw the back of their hand. Their nails adorned dark-purple nail polish.\n\n\"Hey Andy.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"You ever had your nails done before?\"\n\n\"Nope.\"\n\n\"Do you want to have your nails done? Should only be about ten minutes.\"\n\n\"Sure.\n\nA set of nail polish is retrieved and brought before Andy. The set is opened and several unique shades are presented.\n\n\"Alright. Pick a color.\"\n\n\"This one.\"\n\n\"Black?\"\n\n\"Is that alright?\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\nHis hands eased while Quint guided them.\n\n\"Hold them steady. I don't want to get any polish on your skin.\"\n\nOver eleven minutes, Quint did Andy's nails. It took time for the polish to dry. But when it was dry, Andy held their new painted nails up in admiration.\n\n\"Wow.\"\n\n\"You like them?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Thank you.\"\n\n\"No problem.\"\n\n...\n\n[[=]]\n10:00\n[[/=]]\n\nAn alarm blared. Andy yawned and stretched his arms, noticing the black which still covered their nails.\n\nMono colored, pristine, semi-beautiful black. Even after a whole night's rest, it had-\n\nTheir alarm blared again, now reading 10:05 A.M.\n\nIt was quickly shut off, as well as the other seven alarms Andy had set to ensure he woke up around the right time every morning.\n\nTheir roommate's door was open. He was relaxed on his bed and typed on his phone. He barely elected to grant Andy a glance as Andy scurried by with their hand curled into a fist to ensure that their roommate didn't see their nails.\n\nIn the kitchen, Andy checked his balance.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ Bank\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[<]]\n**Aunt Shelley** has sent you $275.00.\n\n//To help you out with the first few weeks of food for college.

Especially nowadays.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah...\n\n**Shelley:** I remember when I was going through it. Half of the time I was surviving on microwave meals and tv dinners. The other half I had nothing at all. I don't want you to go through that.\n\n**Andy:** Well thank you.\n\n**Shelley:** When are you starting college?\n\n**Andy:** In a week or two.\n\n**Shelley:** Uh huh?\n\n**Andy:** Mostly I've just been spending my time back getting ready for it.

I also probably have to get a head start on dinner soon.\n\n**Andy:** Aww.\n\n**Shelley:** I'll talk to you later, then.\n\n**Andy:** See ya.\n[[/div]]\n\n\nThe fridge door swung open, a single-serving container of the potato leek soup being taken from it. With the lid removed, it was set in the microwave to cook for four minutes.\n\nA reflection was visible on the microwave. While faint, Andy really had no choice but to stare into it as the minutes passed. That was until Andy raised their hand, taking a glance at their nail polish. Now, despite being a less-close look, they saw the imperfections in their nails. Minor nicks, scratches, and all sorts of blemishes dotted their nails.\n\nThe faucet began pouring out water as they applied soap to their nails. There was a wait as the water began to heat. Nail polish on the edge of their nails where it met their skin curled. Andy picked at those curls in an attempt to peel off as much as they could.\n\nThe water got hotter, and hotter, //and hotter.// Until it was so hot that they yanked it back in pain.\n\nThen the microwave beeped, cutting them off.\n\n...\n\nCold. It was cold. The soup was cold. Not hot, not warm, not lukewarm, but cold. They would have put it back into the microwave to heat it further, except that merely feeling the soup seemed to overwhelm Andy with a sense of vertigo - making them sit down.\n\nA decision was reached to just eat the cold soup. Beside, Andy heard something about potato leek soup traditionally being served cold. Surely this would be good.\n\n...\n\nAbhorrent. An abhorrent, abnormally uninviting soup in stark contrast to the presentable soup the prior night.\n\nStill, Andy scarfed it down.\n\nWhen Andy had finished the soup, they walked to the sink and cleaned it. The soup seemed to easily wash away. At least, wash away much easier than their nail polish had. Andy looked at their nails one last time, noting how they looked similar to when they had awoken.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n----\n+++ Grocery List\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n* 6x Potatoes\n* 1x Carton of Milk\n* 12x Cans of Soda\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe cashier scanned Andy's select few items. The beeping of scanner and overall noise were drowned out by an abject nothing that flooded Andy's ears.\n\n\"That'll by $20.15.\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"Your total.\"\n\n\"Oh, sorry.\"\n\nTheir credit card was inserted into the reader.\n\n\"I like your nails.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Where'd you get the polish from? It looks nice.\"\n\n\"One of my friends.\"\n\n\"Ah. Well, I think your nails look pretty regardless.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n...\n\n[[=]]\n17:20\n[[/=]]\n\nThe key slid into the lock and the front door opened. Andy put all of the groceries they had bought into their fridge and cupboards.\n\nAfter the last grocery is put in the fridge, they take out the final portion of potato leek soup. Their roommate is nowhere to be seen, although Andy assumed they had eaten some of it.\n\nSix minutes. The soup spent six minutes in the microwave. By the time it was done, it was so hot that Andy needed oven gloves to remove it. They knew it would be a while before it cooled down to a point of edibility.\n\nRather than wait, Andy opened their freezer and pulled out the ice cube tray. They popped out a single ice cube and dropped it in the soup, using their spoon to stir it around.\n\nWhen they took a sip, the soup was palatable. Better than being eaten cold and arguably better than the night it was cooked, but still just not quite there.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[size 125%]] Hello, Andy!

Why are you here?\"\n\nQuint showed Andy a six-pack of energy drinks.\n\n\"For you.\"\n\n\"Aww. Thanks.\"\n\nThe nail has been picked off of Andy's nails, which Quint glances at. They point at Andy's hand.\n\n\"Did you not like them?\"\n\n\"Oh, no. I did. I just woke up and they mostly had fallen off already. Figured I'd remove them.\"\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\"I was actually thinking about getting some of my own.\"\n\n\"Like, to apply?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Holy shit.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"Nothing, nothing.

They opened their laptop to pass later into the night.\n\nThroughout the night, Andy grew curious.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n> || 🔍︎ Search the web ||\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\n> || 🔍︎ Prettiest nail polish colors ||\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\n> || 🔍︎ Tutorial for applying nail polish at home ||\n\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n.....\n\n> || 🔍︎ Where to buy nail polish in Boulder, Colorado ||\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAndy watched as an unfamiliar person left Quint's apartment and walked to a car. As they drove away, Andy moved to knock on Quint's door.\n\n\"Hey Andy. Come in!\"\n\nThey enter the house.\n\n\"Who was that?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\n\"That person who just left your apartment. I saw them walking out.\"\n\n\"Oh, yeah. That's my roommate.

Although I did read something about how he ended up hating his hair.\"\n\n\"You ready?\"\n\n\"Yep.\n\nIt took a minute, but Quint retrieved thirteen different shades of nail polish and brought them to the table in front of Andy.\n\n\"Pick one.\"\n\n\"Black is fine.\"\n\n\"Pick another.\"\n\n\"Dark blue?\"\n\n\"And another.\"\n\n\"I don't know.

You're going to want to start with the nail base-\"\n\n...\n\nLate at night, Andy laid in bed and watched videos on their phone. Video after video on Youtube of short, two-to-five-minute-long nail polish tutorials.\n\nA method they had been taught by their scrolling was finally fully functionally devised.\n\nBefore Andy could enact it, they moved to their bathroom with nail polish. They tried as hard as they could to be quiet as they knew their roommate was asleep.\n\nA bottle of nail polish remover was opened, soon placed on Andy's nails in an effort to wear out the paint.\n\nOne minute passed. Then two minutes. Then three minutes.\n\n//Then five minutes.//\n\nAfter exactly seven minutes a nozzle is turned and hot water begins to pour out of the faucet. Nail polish which touched Andy's skin had already began to peel and curl up. Andy grabbed the nail polish and meticulously peeled off as much as they could.\n\nStreaks and dots of nail polish once again littered their nails. Running their nails under the hot water did help, although specks of nail polish remained never-the-less.\n\nA short trip to the kitchen saw Andy grab a few sheets of paper towels before they retreated to their room.\n\nThe paper towels were strewn on the table. Andy grabbed the dark purple nail polish, nail base, and coat.\n\nNail base came first. It flowed along his nails, although admittedly a bit too much was applied.\n\nThen came the first layer of nail polish. Although inconsistent in its application, it generally avoided overlap onto their skin.\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\nThen came the second layer of nail polish. Now, it coated every atom of their nails and more. In several cases it fell onto their skin.\n\nAndy picked away at the excess nail polish with a nail file attached to their nail clipper to scrape off as much as they could. But still a thin layer solidified within seconds of it being applied, fusing to their skin.\n\nFive minutes passed.\n\nAnd the coat was applied over all of the polish.\n\nWhat Andy was left with was obvious. //A disaster.// Their nails were bumpy, the nail polish looked ugly, nail polish had gotten stuck under their nails. It was a fiasco.\n\nAnd yet, it hardly mattered. It was //theirs.// They had applied the nail polish on their own. Never mind the imperfections, Andy was left in admiration of their work.\n\n...\n\nIn the parking lot, Andy was left in panic. It was a quick trip, with them only needing to grab one item.\n\nBut, their nails remained. Near-pristine. //As pristine as shoddily-applied nail polish could be.//\n\nWhen they left their car their fingers were curled into a fist. It was enough for Andy to feel comfortable walking in public with markings on their nails.\n\nTwenty-seven seconds passed after Andy entered the store. They passed a clothing aisle. A previously fast pace slowed down as an outfit got caught in the corner of their eye.\n\nA mannequin adorning a long, brown pocketed skirt, a mini-belt, and a long-sleeved brown shirt.\n\nTheir phone rang.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Susan:** Andy!\n\n**Andy:** Hey.\n\n**Susan:** Is now a good time to talk for a bit?\n\n**Andy:** Not really.\n\n**Susan:** Aww. Well I'll keep it brief.\n\n**Andy:** Mom-\n\n**Susan:** So how's school going so far this year? Good, I hope.\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh? You liking your new classes?\n\n**Andy:** So far...\n\n**Susan:** How about, um... That apartment of yours! Is it doing you well?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I like it. It's been a lot less stressful than the dorms.\n\n**Susan:** I still think you're overplaying it a bit.\n\n**Andy:** Come on.\n\n**Susan:** I mean - no use arguing it now. It's over with. But still.\n\n**Andy:** So, yeah... To be frank, I'm not sure that I like my roommate too much.\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. He's been eating all my food, not doing dishes. All that stuff.\n\n**Susan:** Well that's just what happens when you rent your own place. Stuff isn't so easy.\n\n**Andy:** And that wouldn't have happened in dorms?\n\n**Susan:** Really?\n\n**Andy:** What?\n\n**Susan:** People had a lot more manners back when I was in the dorms. When I moved out-\n\n**Andy:** Hang on- I need to grab something real quick. I'll have to call you back later.\n\n**Susan:** Well, hang on. Just another minute or two?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah... Sure.\n\n**Susan:** How's that soup coming along for ya? Did you have the right recipe?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, I did.\n\n**Susan:** Did it work out better the second time around?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. Did end up tweaking the recipe around a bit.\n\n**Susan:** What?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I think my stovetop is wonky. Had to adjust the heat, add in a bit of olive oil.\n\n**Susan:** Andy! You should have called me first.\n\n**Andy:** I mean - I did. Just, right before I started cooking.\n\n**Susan:** You- ... Andy, you know what I meant.\n\n**Andy:** Oh? Sorry, then. Don't see how it was that big of a deal.\n\n**Susan:** What did you change with it? What was the whole recipe you used?\n\n**Andy:** Um. Pretty much the same recipe? I just changed around the cooking time a little bit.\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What was the whole recipe.\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember-\n\n**Susan:** Well, there you go! That's cause you didn't follow a recipe. And now you're complaining about how it turned out bad.\n\n**Andy:** Mom-\n\n**Susan:** What?!\n\n**Andy:** I don't remember it off the top of my head!\n\n**Susan:** Do you have a copy of it?\n\n**Andy:** Not right now.\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n**Andy:** All that I changed was the cooking time because I burned the garlic the first time.\n\n**Susan:** Why?\n\n**Andy:** One of my friends suggested it.\n\n**Susan:** Who?\n\n**Andy:** His name is Quint. They-\n\n**Susan:** What was the greater context surrounding that?\n\n**Andy:** I just brought it up.\n\n**Susan:** All do respect to Quint, whoever he is-\n\n**Andy:** Quint doesn't go-\n\n**Susan:** -but this recipe has been in our family for generations and generations. All due respect to him, but I trust the family recipe more than him. You know?\n\n**Andy:** Yup...\n\n**Susan:** Andy, here's my idea. I think you should try the recipe a few more times before you alter it to your own taste. That sound good?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I mean, I was kinda planning on that. Changing it around until I know exactly how to avoid mistakes and all.\n\n**Susan:** But, I want you to call me whenever you make it. No listening to friends or making up how to cook it on the fly. Instead I need you to let me in on everything you do. Okay?\n\n**Andy:** Okay...\n\n[[/div]]\n\nDeep breaths. Deep, deep breaths.\n\nBreathing did not help.\n\nAndy tried to continue their search toward the store. They just needed an immersion blender for the soup. Nothing else.\n\nThey found their legs becoming stiff, which did not help Andy as their pace nearly tripled. Sweat formed on their brow. It dripped down their forehead into their eye. Whatever control Andy had of their breathing vanished as Andy found themself unable to breath.\n\nThen Andy saw a unisex bathroom. Without a second thought, the door was opened then slammed behind them with nearly full force. The door was locked behind them.\n\nIt took nineteen paces around the small, cramped room for Andy to finally breathe again.\n\nNow able to breathe, they sat on the toilet for five minutes. With a jolt, they rose to the mirror. Their eyes had gotten beet red, although no tears had formed.\n\nTheir thumb and index finger moved to their sinus and pinched hard. A minute passed and Andy swallowed.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n**Susan:** Yes?\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to say something else-\n\n**Susan:** What is it?\n\n**Andy:** I just wanted to talk a bit about the recipe - what I am thinking about it and whatnot.\n\n**Susan:** Okay. What about it?\n\n**Andy:** It was just... being put on the spot like that. Randomly called. I wasn't really able to think what I wanted to say, you know?\n\n**Susan:** Uh huh?\n\n**Andy:** But, yeah...\n\n**Susan:** What is that echo, by the way?\n\n**Andy:** Nothing.\n\n**Susan:** Nothing?\n\n**Andy:** It's just a bathroom. I wanted some privacy.\n\n**Susan:** You wanted some- Jesus Christ, this is to yell at me, isn't it?\n\n**Andy:** No-\n\n**Susan:** Andy, just say what you want to say. I can't do this.\n\n**Andy:** I'm not going to yell at you.\n\n**Susan:** So what is it?\n\n**Andy:** It's just more- what I'm thinking is that I change the recipe a bit while I learn how to cook. Avoid burning things and everything like that.\n\n**Susan:** And that just applies to cooking temp?\n\n**Andy:** Mostly. I'm also getting an immersion blender-\n\n**Susan:** Andy...\n\n**Andy:** Because I don't like how chunky I cut the potatoes.\n\n**Susan:** Andy! That's one of the biggest parts of the recipe! It's supposed to have chunks in it.\n\n**Andy:** I don't... really agree with that. I just think-\n\n**Susan:** Sorry, but I don't think you're making the same soup anymore.\n\n**Andy:** It's just one thing-\n\n**Susan:** It's two. The temp, now this. Next you're going to tell me something else, and then something else. It's not the same soup anymore, just admit that.\n\n**Andy:** Mom! I-\n\n**Susan:** Stop. I told you that I can't argue right now.\n\n**Andy:** Okay then! Sorry.\n\n**Susan:** So stop yelling at me, stop arguing with me, and be honest with me that it isn't just that.\n\n**Andy:** It was just the temp thing. The blending thing's only something that I might do.\n\n**Susan:** Might?\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. Just see if I like it more.\n\n**Susan:** I think you're changing your answers now; which I don't really like.\n\n**Andy:** That was always what I was going to do.\n\n**Susan:** I don't like it when you lie to me, sweetie.\n\n**Andy:** I just-\n\n**Susan:** You know what, Andy? I'm not doing this, today. I've barely had any energy today and I just can't argue with you right now. You can't admit when you're wrong and just keep lying and I... I just can't.\n\n**Andy:** Sorry...\n\n**Susan:** Look- Andy, I love you. But that's not the same soup and it won't ever be. Unless you change it back, it's fundamentally different. And lets just leave it at that. Agreed?\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n**Susan:** I'm going to go. I have to take a shower. Love you.\n\n**Andy:** Love you...\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\nThe call ends.\n\nThey let out a scream.\n\nA scream they hoped wasn't heard by anyone. Really, really hoped.\n\nIt took another twenty-three paces to calm down. When they stopped, they looked in the mirror. The sight of their reflection overcame them with a need to cry.\n\nTheir best effort to suppress their tears were in vain. It couldn't be held in forever. As he realized that truth, Andy let themself cry for only one minute.\n\nA paper towel was produced by the dispenser and used to soak up any water around Andy's eyes. Still, they were bloodshot. At best, Andy hoped that the cashier would think they were high.\n\nIt took them a lot, but they managed to convince themself to leave the bathroom.\n\nThere was no point in getting the immersion blender anymore. So they went to leave the store. Two employees looked at them, an act that confirmed they had heard Andy's scream.\n\nRight before they left, Andy's eye was caught once more. The outfit. On a discount, no less.\n\n[[=]]\n$45.99\n[[/=]]\n\nAnd it was silly. They didn't have that much to spare - couldn't afford any split-second purchases.\n\n...\n\nExcept they could. It was priced the same as an immersion blender.\n\n\n\nAndy looked around for a price tag. Eventually, Andy found that it was priced at $45.99. Andy didn't know if they had that much to spare. Nor why they were even considering it.\n\nBut, they had decided not to buy the immersion blender. They would, in all likelihood, be a similar price. Andy toiled and considered.\n\n...\n\n\"Will that be all for the day?\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\n\"Total should be around $45.99.\"\n\nThe cashier was handed a credit card.\n\n\"It's for my sister.\"\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Her birthday is coming up. Wanted to get her something nice.\"\n\n\"Well, she must be pretty lucky. It's a pretty nice dress.\"\n\n\"It really is.\"\n\n\"Would you like a receipt?\"\n\n\"No thank you.\"\n\n\"Have a great day.\"\n\nThey knew.\n\nThe cashier knew.\n\nAndy could see it in their eyes.\n\nOutfit in hands, they left the store as fast as they could, getting in their car and screaming.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Roommate\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> You going to be here tonight?\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> No.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> Where are you going to be at?\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> A party.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> Okay.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> Why?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> Just curious.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nEven though their roommate would be gone, Andy instinctively locked themself in their bathroom.\n\nThey took off their jacket, then their belt, then their jeans, then their shirt, then their socks, and finally their boxers.\n\nAnd then they were nude. Completely.\n\nImmediately followed was a feeling of relief. Their clothes had been a bit tight on them.\n\nAndy glanced over at the door to confirm it was locked. With the final confirmation, Andy opened the bag.\n\nThree components.\n\nA skirt. A shirt. And a belt.\n\nIt quickly dawned on them that they would need a bra and panties to comfortably complete the set.\n\n//Complete the set?!//\n\nThey hardly knew why they bought the outfit in the first place. Yet, they put it on piece-by-piece-by-piece, followed by a glance in the mirror.\n\nAnd they were beautiful.\n\nAlthough not the perfect fit, the clothes were the most comfortable thing Andy had ever worn. It fit their shape well, the fabric was soft. Oh, it was soft.\n\nAndy began to cry. Not tears of stress, exhaustion. Rather tears of emotion, elation.\n\nAndy turns, and turns, and turns, and turns, and turns. They adore every angle, every aspect of their outfit.\n\nIt takes five minutes before Andy seems to snap out of adoration. They mechanically exit the bathroom and retreat to their bedroom, electing to lock the door before they passed out on their bed.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:42 P.M.// ||\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:44 P.M.// ||\n\n...\n...\n...\n\n> || Missed Call: Quint //8:47 P.M.// ||\n\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Quint\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n> heyyyy\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> r u okay?\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> anyways, was wondering if u wanted to head to my place later.\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> just to watch a movie\n[[/<]]\n[[<]]\n> let me know when u get this.\n[[/<]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n.......\n.......\n.......\n.......\n.......\n.......\n.......\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> Sorry.

After a stretch, they look down and realize they still adorn the same clothes as the night prior.\n\nPanic ensued. They tore off the outfit, nearly ripping it while they undresssed. Now naked, Andy rushed to put on a t-shirt, boxers, pajama pants, and a matching flannel before they were ready.\n\nThe removed clothing was crammed into a ball and thrown on their bed.\n\nThey sighed, then remembered that the previous night they had planned to make potato leek soup, but never did. With a free morning, they entered the kitchen.\n\n[[=]]\n\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n.............\n\n[[/=]]\n\nAndy remembered the first time they ever tried to make potato leek soup.\n\nThe first time they followed the family recipe.\n\nThe first time they ever cooked.\n\nThis was worse.\n\nA lot worse.\n\nIn truth, it was awful.\n\nIt wasn't a familiar type of awfulness, either.\n\nIt was, somehow, new.\n\nIt didn't make sense. Andy had very, very closely followed the original recipe. Even with a call to their mother, it didn't work.\n\nSame temp, same cooking time, same ratios, same ingredients, and a same everything as the recipe had called for.\n\nAndy tried their best to eat the soup. They had eaten every other soup before. Every other, awful soup. They only managed to get a few bites in.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, Mom?\n\n**Susan:** Just checking in to see how the soup's doing.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.

Probably not until Christmas?\n\n**Susan:** But that's so long away-\n\n**Andy:** The distance from Colorado to Pennsylvania is also pretty far.\n\n**Susan:** Yeah...\n\n**Andy:** Although, to be honest, I might not be able to afford the plane ticket.\n\n**Susan:** Honey...\n\n**Andy:** I've been looking at them, and they're getting pretty expensive.\n\n**Susan:** I can help you pay for the ticket.\n\n**Andy:** And then it's also the jet lag - that's playing into it.\n\n**Susan:** Andy. You're visiting me for Christmas.\n\n**Andy:** I want to! It's just I don't know if I can.\n\n**Susan:** I know- that you're a bit mad about the soup. But I don't think that really affects why you should or shouldn't come over.\n\n**Andy:** It isn't!\n\n**Susan:** Then why don't you want to?\n\n**Andy:** I do! I do. I just... I probably will. But I don't know for certain.\n\n**Susan:** We can visit your grandmother's grave.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, we can.\n\n**Susan:** It's been a while since we've done that, huh?\n\n**Andy:** It has...\n\n**Susan:** But I- just want to see you Andy. Get together for the holidays.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. Well, I still need to sort out the flight. But I promise that I will come.\n\n**Susan:** You don't have to. I don't want to force you.\n\n**Andy:** It's alright.\n\n**Susan:** So you'll come over?\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nIt had to be thrown away. It just had to.\n\nAll of the soup they had made was inedible. It was disgusting, //repulsing// to eat.\n\nSo much food went to waste all in a single moment. They went to their fridge to find some food, //any food.//\n\nBefore they could choose, they ran to the bathroom and vomitted.\n\nWhen they finished, they wiped the vomit off of their lip and went to their bedroom. Seeing a glass of water, they emptied it.\n\nAnd collapsed on their bed.\n\n...\n\nTossed and turned, turned and tossed. They tossed around for twenty-seven minutes.\n\nAll they wanted was to be able to close their eyes and rest. But, they couldn't.\n\nAndy shot up, sitting in their bed. They turned, their eyes locking almost like a magnet to the dress that laid on their bed.\n\nWith a single motion, they grabbed the dress. Their nausea seemingly having faded away.\n\nThe soft fabrics melted in their hands, each silky fiber feeling soft and beautiful as ever.\n\n[[=]]\nThen,\n\nwithout a single reason,\n\nthey tore the dress.\n[[/=]]\n\nFirst in half, then in fourths, then in eigths, then in sixteenth...\n\nWithin moments, it was reduced to scraps and shreds. Andy made very well sure to give the other parts of the outfit attention. The belt was snapped, the sleeves ripped off the shirt before themself being halved.\n\nMassive holes were ripped through the shirt until it was nothing but a rag.\n\nFive minutes passed. Shreds laid in Andy's hands and around their room.\n\nThey breathed and picked up what scraps they could to throw any away.\n\n...\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Quint\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> You want to eat out?\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n...\n\n\n\nQuint had arrived. A text on their phone informed them so.\n\nAndy walked outside to meet them. When they had met, the pair walked inside of the restaurant and were seated at a booth.\n\n\"You doing okay?\"\n\n\"Yeah. Just... woke up rough this morning.\"\n\n\"I feel you.\"\n\n\"Good thing I've been going to sleep earlier, huh?\"\n\n\"Heh. Yeah.\"\n\nA server arrived and took their drink orders. Both ordered a cup of water.\n\n\"That'll be out in a second.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\nThe server brought spinach artichoke dip to the table.\n\n\"Yum.\"\n\n\"Good call with this one, Andy. Spinach artichoke dip is my favorite.\"\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\"Yep. Behind whatever I decide to order.\"\n\n...\n\n\"So did my suggestion work out?\"\n\n\"It didn't taste burnt, if that's what you're asking.\"\n\n\"For some reason I feel like you didn't like it.\"\n\n\"I think it's mostly just inexperience, not the recipe.\"\n\n\"Probably.\"\n\n\"I called my mom the other day to talk to her about it. She freaked //the fuck// out.\"\n\n\"About what?\"\n\n\"I don't even know, man. The temp? I guess.\"\n\n\"Jesus. That's rough.\"\n\n\"It's just like... A //really, really// small part of the recipe and she was freaking out about it.\"\n\n\"What happened after that?\"\n\n\"She called me a few more times the next time I made soup.\"\n\n\"Still freaking out?\"\n\n\"Still freaking out. Yep.\"\n\n\"Yeah. That really sucks.\"\n\n\"Like, I don't really care about it, it's just like. You really care that much about whether I simmer garlic on medium, or low heat when I'm just fucking starting to learn how to cook enough to yell at me for it.\"\n\n\"But you liked it.\"\n\n\"The one with the changed recipe, yeah. You know - I made some earlier, followed the recipe word-for-word, and it still tasted like shit.\"\n\n\"It's definitely because you just haven't tried it enough.\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah.\"\n\n...\n\n\"When are you leaving?\"\n\n\"The 21st. I get back on the 28th.\"\n\n\"We've got to do something before you head off. Something before you spend a week in mundane hell FarmVille.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"We just have to. Doctor's orders.\"\n\n\"What are you thinking of?\"\n\n\"Something small. Probably having drinks at a park or something.\"\n\n\"That sounds fun.\"\n\n\"So you're down?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Radical.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Like your roommate?\"\n\n\"Kinda.\"\n\n\"So that's not a yes?\"\n\n\"I didn't say I don't.\"\n\n\"Because, my roommate is dropping out of college.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Yeah. She found a high-paying job and didn't need her diploma.\"\n\n\"Good for her.\"\n\n\"So that means that I have an open room.\"\n\n\"Uh huh?\"\n\n\"//And// I don't want to pay two people's rent by myself. Don't really want to move, either.\"\n\n...\n\n\"You get what I'm saying?\"\n\n\"I'll have to think about it.\"\n\n\"Just let me know soon.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\n.....\n\nIt was dark when Andy's door opened. Despite just eating, they were hungry.\n\nThe fridge door opened and the note they had left was gone. //As well as one of their energy drinks...//\n\nIt was at that moment Andy decided to move out.\n\nThey grabbed pre-cooked, cold spaghetti noodles out of the fridge. Rather than microwave them, Andy put grated parmesan on them and moved to their room with a fork to eat them cold.\n\nNot bothering to turn on a light, they sat in front of their laptop and quickly finished the pasta. A sigh left Andy's mouth as they looked at an essay they had to write.\n\n400 words done.\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\nA clock read //10:52 P.M.//\n\nThey had time, plenty of time. They just needed to write.\n\n//11:55 P.M.//\n\n500 words done.\n\n3,000 words needed.\n\nThe laptop screen was left open as they moved to their bed. Curled up in a ball, facing away from the light, and they eventually saw a scrap.\n\nDespite being only a thousandth of the original's glory, it had all the pull. Both eyes locked on the shred as their hand outstretched to grab it.\n\nAndy let out a gentle laugh.\n\n\"Must've been poor quality- with how easy it was to tear...\"\n\nThey wrapped their body around a pillow, cooling off with shred still in hand.\n\n\"Wouldn't have lasted if I wore it more than once...\"\n\n[[=]]\n\n//Wore it where?//\n\n//In their room?//\n\n//In public?!//\n\n[[/=]]\n\nNo no, they wouldn't have. It made sense for them to rip it; they didn't need it. They simply didn't.\n\nYet Andy did not know why they were holding on to the last scrap of fabric so tightly.\n\n//12:21 A.M.//\n\nThey went to their desk and shook their cursor around to turn on the screen. Fingers on the keys, they prepared to keep writing.\n\nUntil they brought out a pen and paper.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n----\n\nMystique -- Lash False Lash Effect Mascara -- Adds Volume & Lengthening -- Cruelty & Paraben-Free\n\n[[>]]\n$3.49\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\nEllanie's Prime Remain All Day Red Lipstick, Matte -- Long-Lasting Color Wear -- No Transfer or Bleed -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating for Soft Lips\n\n[[>]]\n$5.97\n[[/>]]\n----\n\nBlack Tone Lip Stick for Soft Lips -- Hydrating & Non-Irritating -- Perfect Gift For Your Girlfriend\n\n[[>]]\n$6.49\n[[/>]]\n----\n\nPROFFESSIONAL MAKEUP EYELINER Used By Celebrities -- Waterproof Pattented Formula -- Black Tone\n\n[[>]]\n$18.57\n[[/>]]\n----\n\nINSTANT Cheekbone Contour Peach Perfection, .33 Oz, Non-Irritating Materials to Enhance Natural Radiance\n\n[[>]]\n$5.97\n[[/>]]\n----\n\n[[>]]\n++ **Subtotal (5 item):**\n++++ $40.51\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n \nThree hours were needed to watch makeup tutorials on Youtube, or trying to figure out how to grow a wolfcut.\n\nAndy checked their bank account.\n\n//$205.60//\n\nAndy sighed what they thought was a sigh of a relief. An excuse why they didn't buy it. They couldn't drop 1/5th of their money on makeup! Not at the moment.\n\nAnd then Andy remembered how much cheaper it was to buy things in person vs online...\n\n...\n\nThe cashier didn't believe them. There was no way. Literally no way. It was like when Andy bought the dress.\n\nThey claimed it to be for Christmas shopping, a gift for their mother. The cashier didn't buy it for a second. At the very least, they //suspected// it. Buying //all of that makeup// for one person who'd likely //already have it?!//\n\nAndy only hoped.\n\nThey locked the bathroom door behind them and dropped the bag on the counter. Their roommate was there, so they had to be careful.\n\nAndy started with the eyeliner - which was shakily applied. It curved and swayed as dots of skin peeked out throughout both of their upper eyelids.\n\nNext up - the blush. The kit came with four different colors. The initial blush that Andy applied hardly matched their skin tone. Andy grabbed a wet towel and tried to wipe off the blush. Yet, it persisted. After Andy's face was dried off, Andy tried to apply a different kind of blush. All that Andy was left with were patches of dust that clinged to their face that were either too red or too pale for their skin tone.\n\nThen; the lipstick. They went with the red lipstick. The lipstick overlapped from their lips to their skin until they were left with a bumpy, shoddily applied red coating their lips.\n\nThe only thing that could save the day was the mascara. Their eyelashes were coated, and came off being longer. Much to Andy's shagrin, the mascara was hardly noticeable.\n\nEven with it being the best application, tiny dots of black which stemmed from the mascara hit their upper eyes.\n\nAndy looked into the mirror to see an object of horror. Although recognizable who was behind the mask, it was a hard sight.\n\nYet, the tiniest twinge of pride overcame them. It was their first time trying and not all that bad. But they simply couldn't avoid how bad it looked at first.\n\nAndy heard their roommate walking throughout the house and sighed. They grabbed the towel and cleaned their face.\n\n//Then nothing came off.//\n\nThe towel was soaked in water before being applied directly on their face. They panicked, scrubbing as hard as they could to get it off.\n\n//It was water resistant. All of it was!//\n\nThey glanced into the mirror, seeing the makeup merely smudge on their face without coming off.\n\nTheir roommate would certainly notice if they saw. They would notice, and they would //judge//. Especially for how bad the makeup was.\n\nAndy jumped into the shower and turned on the water. It was still freezing cold, and it remained freezing for the rest of the shower.\n\nWhen they finished, they dried off their face and looked into the mirror.\n\nRemnants of the makeup stayed, but they were more discreet. Much of their eyeliner and lipstick had washed off. All that remained was a hardly-noticeable shadow of the makeup they had just tried to apply.\n\nAs the bathroom door unlocked, they saw their roommate.\n\nThey were concise and told the roommate that they planned to move out soon.\n\nThe roommate asked why.\n\nAndy told them why.\n\nThe roommate asked what day.\n\nAndy said that they did not know.\n\nThe roommate confirmed that Andy was leaving the house.\n\nAnd Andy affirmed them.\n\nThen the roommate wished them well, and thanked them for letting them know.\n\nAnd that was it. Andy walked into their room and picked up their phone.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Quint\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> I can move in with you if you're still looking for someone.\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> cool\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n>Text me the details.\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAndy set down their phone.

The beer is handed to Quint, who shoves the six-pack into their backpack.\n\nThe pair follow a trail into the woods just into the Rockies.\n\nAfter roughly seventeen minutes, the pair arrived at a clearing slightly off-trail. Quint took out a blanket to place on the grass while Andy kicked off their shoes and felt the blades of grass beneath their toes.\n\nTwo bottles of beer were popped.\n\n\"Feels like forever since we've hung out, huh?\"\n\n\"It's been a while.\"\n\n\"Especially since we've gone out here.\"\n\n\"We should come out here more. It's really pretty.\"\n\n\"In a few weeks?\"\n\n\"Sure.\"\n\n\"Alright.\"\n\n...\n\n\"Thank you for offering me the apartment.\"\n\n\"You're good.\"\n\n\"I did not vibe well with my roommate, to be honest.\"\n\n\"I'll miss mine. But, we didn't really talk.\"\n\n\"My roommate stole an energy drink after I specifically confronted them to not.\"\n\n\"Geez.\"\n\n\"I know, right?\"\n\nAndy grabbed a second bottle of beer.\n\n\"Have you told your mom yet?\"\n\n\"Hell no?\"\n\n\"Fair enough.\"\n\nThe duo leaned back in near-unison to see the stars. While Andy had moved to lay on the blanket, Quint decided to lay on the grass, at least briefly.\n\nThe pair stared into the stars for thirty-one minutes all while sipping their beers.\n\nAt a point during the night, Andy had grabbed a third beer. By the time they were back in the car, the bottle was empty. The bottle Quint had nursed was thrown away in a trash can they found, still half-full.\n\nAs the pair entered the car, Quint turned on a light to search it.\n\n\"What are you looking for?\"\n\n\"My keys.\"\n\n\"You know- you... you probably shouldn't just leave those in the car...\"\n\n\"Heh. Probably.\"\n\nThe search effort is joined by Andy. After a minute, the pair briefly lock eyes.\n\n\"Andy.\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"Are you wearing mascara?\"\n\n...\n\n\"No, no.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\nQuint discovered the key, put it in the ignition, then drove away.\n\nA chuckle left Andy's lips and they closed their eyes, leaning against their seat and nearly falling asleep.\n\n...\n\nA key slid into the door, and it was opened.\n\n\"Let's get you into bed.\"\n\nThey practically had to drag Andy to their room where they opened a door, turned on a light, and eased Andy into bed. They helped Andy remove their shoes and tuck themselves under the sheets.\n\n\"I'm going to hang out here a minute- while I wait for a cab.\"\n\n\"No, no- no... Don't. You can just- just take my car and give it to me tomorrow.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"Yeah, yeah. Yeah... Just have a good night.\"\n\n\"Sleep tight.\"\n\nThe keys to Andy's car slides into Quint's pocket.\n\nRight as they reached the door, they turned to shut off the light.\n\nThen something caught their eye.\n\n//Blush,//\n//Eyeliner,//\n//Red Lipstick,//\n//Black Lipstick,//\n//Mascara,//\n//and Nail Polish.//\n\nAll neatly packed into the corner.\n\nThey picked up one of the nail polish bottles, at which point they confirmed that it was the exact same as they had given to Andy.\n\nThe cap of the lipstick popped off, and it was clearly used. Smeared in only a way that application, rough application, could do.\n\nThey approached Andy to look at their eyes and confirm that they were wearing mascara. With the confirmation, Quint left the room while they shut off the light behind them.\n\n\"Best of dreams.\"\n\n...\n\nTwo potatoes. Both were washed as they had decided to make a scaled-down version of the recipe for lunch, and likely dinner/breakfast.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Quint\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Andy:** Yeah?\n\n**Quint:** Hey.

She's been asking for that for a while.\n\n**Quint:** Anything else?\n\n**Andy:** A few stocking stuffers.\n\n**Quint:** Like?\n\n**Andy:** Socks. And maybe a candle or two, although I'd probably buy those in Pennsylvania.\n\n**Quint:** And that's it?\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n**Quint:** What about other friends? What other gifts have you gotten them?\n\n**Andy:** Why are you asking about that?\n\n**Quint:** Still have a few friends I need to get stuff for, but I'm out of ideas.\n\n**Andy:** Ah.\n\n**Quint:** Well?\n\n**Andy:** Mostly just alcohol or clothes. I got my sister a stereo. And I bought a necklace I think my Aunt will like.\n\n**Quint:** I guess I can't ask what you're getting me.\n\n**Andy:** Who says I'm getting you anything?\n\n**Quint:** You're right! I didn't think of that.\n\n**Andy:** But - your thing still hasn't arrived yet. It probably won't until after I'm gone.\n\n**Quint:** Ah.\n\n**Andy:** But yeah. Hope that helps.\n\n**Quint:** By the way - I'm driving over to your house to give back your car.\n\n**Andy:** Shit, yeah. Thanks.

Pretty tidy.\"\n\n\"I don't... Really think so, but okay.\"\n\n\"Then I saw something; in the corner on your desk. I looked at it. It was makeup. Lipstick, mascara, eyeliner.

Those were for my Aunt. Thanks for opening them, by the way!\"\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just saw you wearing mascara last night and I thought-\"\n\n\"Jesus fucking Christ. I was not fucking wearing mascara.\"\n\n\"Yes you were!

Their roommate didn't bother to check in on them.\n\nIn the kitchen, Andy tried to continue.\n\nThey heated up their Dutch oven and threw in the butter, which quickly turned to a brownish-black. The leeks varied, but all smoked and charred by the end. //In exactly four minutes under heat.//\n\nThen they thought.\n\n[[=]]\n\n**What did Quint know? Really.**\n\n**Was Quint in the wrong? Hell, //of course they were.//**\n\n**Breaking into Andy's room like that... And then looking through their stuff?**\n\n[[/=]]\n\nAt least the potatoes did not burn. Although Andy couldn't claim them to be cooked.\n\nWhen the stock was added, it boiled over.\n\nWhen Andy tried to check the potatoes with a fork, the tongs snapped off.\n\nAndy turned off the burner and ran to the restroom.

I only got a //92.4%// on one of my tests the other day.\n\n**Shelley:** Slacking behind, I see.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I'll have to drop out at that rate.\n\n**Shelley:** What about your apartment? How's that working out?\n\n**Andy:** Eh.\n\n**Shelley:** Do you like it?\n\n**Andy:** I mean - I like it. Just I don't really like my roommate.\n\n**Shelley:** Ah.\n\n**Andy:** But I did start talking with another one of my friends about moving in with them.\n\n**Shelley:** Who are they?\n\n**Andy:** A person named Quint. You wouldn't know them.\n\n**Shelley:** And you think you two'd be good roommates.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** To be completely honest, I don't know if it's still going to happen.\n\n**Shelley:** Oh? Why?\n\n**Andy:** Me and Quint- we got in a bit of an argument before. A bad argument, actually.\n\n**Shelley:** What happened.\n\n**Andy:** They- One night, I was drunk. Then they drove me home and helped me get in bed while I was passing out. When I did pass out, they looked through some of my stuff. When I found out about it, I got pissed off and yelled at them.\n\n**Shelley:** Oh.\n\n**Andy:** And now they've been trying to call me and text me, but I honestly have no idea how I'll respond to it.\n\n**Shelley:** What were they looking through?\n\n**Andy:** Just stuff on my desk. I guess they thought it might be a gift? Or something?\n\n**Shelley:** I mean, it doesn't even matter. They shouldn't have been looking through your stuff without your approval.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah, I'm just- kinda regretting how I lashed out at them. You know?\n\n**Shelley:** In all honesty, I don't see why you wouldn't have any right to.\n\n**Andy:** Uh huh?\n\n**Shelley:** I mean- I don't know the specifics. But, if I may, I just want to say that you shouldn't beat yourself up over it.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I just don't feel good about ghosting them.\n\n**Shelley:** Fair enough.\n\n**Andy:** I don't know if I'm going to do anything until I head back.\n\n**Shelley:** Yeah.\n\n**Andy:** Thanks for the call, though.\n\n**Shelley:** Merry Christmas!\n\n**Andy:** Happy holidays.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n\nTuesday.\n\nDecember 26th, 2023.\n\n10:53 P.M.\n[[/=]]\n\nThey stared at the alarm and watched as the seconds, then minutes passed. It had been thirty minutes since Andy had tried to start falling asleep. Their plane was set to leave next morning and they wanted any small amount of sleep.\n\nBut their curtain was broken, as it had always been. Light shone directly on their face.\n\nAndy wondered what awaited them when they returned. After all, Quint was convinced of something that flat out wasn't true. Something that Andy was not.\n\n...\n\nAlthough the makeup was suspicious. Obviously Quint shouldn't of looked, but Andy...\n\n...stood up and tried to yank the curtain close. Doing so saw barely anything change as moonlight still flooded the room.\n\nThey crawled back into bed then covered themself in sheets.\n\n//What about their mother?// She had been in bad health for such a long time, Andy considered. They knew she wouldn't be around forever. If Andy ever wanted to tell her something that they'd regret not letting her know, they'd have to say it soon.\n\nFortunately, //there was absolutely nothing that Andy needed to say.//\n\nAside from them starting to wear nail polish. Although they wouldn't really feel bad over not telling them that.\n\n//But what about the mascara? They'd been wearing that almost every day before they left.//\n\nAnd the //lipstick.//\n\nAnd the //blush.//\n\nAnd the //eyeliner.//\n\nBut they reasoned that they had only tried those things once and immediately washed them off.\n\n//Only because their roommate was there. What if they were alone? Would they still have washed it off so quickly?//\n\nEven then, they were all just minor things to Andy. Stylistic things that weren't exactly major secrets...\n\nBut-\n\n[[=]]\n++++ ##cyan|What## ##pink|if## ##silver|Quint## ##pink|was## ##cyan|right?##\n[[/=]]\n\n...\n\nThey stormed out of their bed to the curtain and grabbed both sides of it. Andy slammed together both curtains with such forced that the curtain rod was knocked off of the wall. It fell to the ground.\n\nThey sighed and leaned to pick up the curtain. Before they put it back, Andy stared out the window.\n\nAnd then they opened it.\n\nThey inhaled the cool, crisp air as it rushed past them. It wasn't too cold for a winter's night. They looked down at a field just a bit below them.\n\nWith a second thought, Andy adorned a jacket and moved downstairs.\n\n...\n\nThey walked through the field. Snow crunched under each footstep. It took effort to avoid the tangled amalgamation of roots and dead plants while making their way through the field.\n\nBut, they made it. A small clearing where they begun to breathe what felt like the freshest air they had in years. Only two sounds were heard, Andy's breaths and the gentle breeze of the wind.\n\nThey looked up into the sky. Fifty-seven stars littered it. A burning fire that shone all the way across the universe just so Andy could glimpse it.\n\nThey sat on the ground. Their coat was waterproof, allowing them to have some protection.\n\nThen they zoned out and enjoyed the cosmos. When they returned, they had no idea how much time they had lost.\n\n...\n\nThey were terrified. Terrified of the repercussions of it, of what it would mean if it were true.\n\nTheir whole life - everything they have had up until a few months prior, wasn't what they were.\n\nAnd what if they did tell their mother? What if they were disowned? What if their mother spent the last few months of her life hating her-\n\n-hating them.\n\nThey shiverred. It was cold. They knew it was time for them to go back.\n\nThey stood, feeling that snow had gotten through their coat. Somehow.\n\nAt the icy porch, Andy took careful steps to avoid slipping. Then, before entering the house, they turned back to the field. All fifty-seven stairs were still beautiful in the night sky.\n\nThey sat at the porch.\n\nThen, they thought. Thought for a long while. About Aunt Shelley and how she was cut off by her- their mother.\n\nWell, it wasn't //really// being cut off. They didn't meet, didn't talk that much. But they still talked occasionally. Still were friendly. Just... strained.\n\nAnd Andy didn't want that. They really, really did not want that. Despite everything, despite all of the stress, Andy did not want to lose their mother early. They really didn't.\n\nThey stood and entered the house, letting the warmth inside melt away any cool temperatures they had been in.\n\nAnd the house was just as cold.\n\nUp the stairs they went, entering their room and seeing their curtain-less window.\n\nThey stopped in front of the window, staring out of it once more.\n\nThen they opened the window.\n\nAndy didn't know where to start. They were afraid. If it wasn't real, it would have already fallen apart. At any point over the months where Andy tried to prevent it.\n\nEven then, they tried to rationalize their fear. That it wouldn't be all too bad. But, they knew it would be hard going forward. They knew that there was a good chance they'd be beaten down at any turn. They knew that throughout the rest of their life, they'd fight an uphill battle that they could likely never win.\n\nAnd Andy accepted that. They would have to be ready to face it one day. Mayble not day one, but they had to get ready to face what would happen if such a truth were ever revealed.\n\nShe closed the window, left the curtain open, and walked to bed.\n\nTucked into the sheets, she let her eyes close, and drifted off to sleep.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n||~ Flight ||~ Date ||~ Origin ||~ Destination ||~ Seat||\n|| 202 || 27/DEC/2023 || Pittsburgh, PA || Denver, CO || 3C ||\n\n**Departure:** 06:30\n\n**Passenger Name:** Andy Clarke\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n23:36\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nShe stared into the mirror. She had been staring into it for a few minutes. It dawned on Andy's mind that she hadn't shaved ever since she had gotten back from Pennsylvania.\n\nWhatever little hair she had on her head, she pulled back and tucked behind her ears. Shaving cream lathered her face and she grabbed a razor, using it with precision to cut every single strand of hair off of her face.\n\n//Yet she hated how gritty her face felt as she rubbed her hands against it.//\n\nSo she shaved it again.\n\nAnd a third time.\n\nUntil it felt /just a little bit// smoother.\n\nAnd that was all she felt she could do. When she moved to clean up, she saw her arms.\n\nHer hairy, horrendous arms.\n\nThe sleeves on her arms were pulled up until they resembled a tank top. She slathered her left arm with shaving cream, then pressed her razor against it.\n\n...\n\nShe was done. Both arms. Where they were hairy and irritating, now they felt smooth. She had to put toilet paper on the spots of her arms where she nicked herself\n\nThe couch cushioned her fall as she leaned back against it. Her roommate had gone to party, as most people likely had. But she decided to stay home.\n\nHer laptop opened, and she began to play //The Thing//.\n\n\n[[=]]\n----\nDecember 31,\n2023\n\n23:55\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nAndy took out her phone. She saw 53 missed calls from Quint, and nearly 83 missed texts.\n\nA sigh left their mouth, looking at the clock. She paused the movie, and called Quint.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Quint\n+++++ Phone Call Record\n----\n\n[[/=]]\n\n**Quint:** Andy?\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** Andy?!\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** Andy, are you there?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.\n\n**Quint:** Oh my god. Thank god. Okay. Are you okay?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.\n\n**Quint:** How- I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** I'm really sorry about looking through your- the makeup that was on your desk. I shouldn't- I should have just left after I dropped you off, you know.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** I just, guess that I saw my nail polish and jumped to conclusions. I don't think- I didn't think. I wasn't thinking about it. You know?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.\n\n**Quint:** I'm really, really sorry.\n\n**Andy:** You are?\n\n**Quint:** Yeah. I've been thinking about it; what I could have done. Ever since.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** Have you been in Pennsylvania this whole time?\n\n**Andy:** I got back a few days ago.\n\n**Quint:** Have you seen my calls?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I'm sorry.\n\n**Quint:** No- it's okay. I get it.\n\n**Andy:** Uh huh?\n\n**Quint:** I've just been worried.\n\n**Andy:** Where are you right now?\n\n**Quint:** At my apartment. Alone. Didn't really feel like partying.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. Same here.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** Look, what I said- What I thought... I don't know what I'm trying to say right now. I guess I put together the nail polish and the mascara; thought that it was for you. That there was some part of you that you were hiding. And I wanted to support you if you were hiding it. I just didn't think it through.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** So I'm sorry.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** I really am.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** I understand if you don't forgive this - if you don't want to move in anymore.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** I just want to apologize for it.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I was also thinking about it. I thought about it a lot up until I left.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I also called my Aunt for the first time in a while during Christmas. It was nice. I got to chat with her, catch up with her.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I think that was the second calmest moment of my trip. There was this night that was beautiful, and I mean really pretty. It wasn't that cold, the clouds were gone, and it was quiet. I guess the best part about Appalachia is how there aren't many lights around there.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I remember stargazing for a while that night. Wasn't that what we did? The night before I went? Got drunk and stared at the sky.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** And then I just thought.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** Nearly dozed off to sleep, too.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** You there?\n\n**Quint:** Yeah.\n\n**Andy:** I don't think I'm a man. I don't think it is right for me to be a man anymore.\n\n**Quint:** Do you think you're trans? Or non-binary?\n\n**Andy:** I don't know. I would feel better - or at least think I would feel better - if I was a woman. But I don't think I'll ever come close to that, truly. So I don't know what I am realistically going to be, or are realistically.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I'm sorry for lashing out. I still- stand by what I said. Well, some of it. I'm still mad that you looked at my stuff when I was drunk. But, I think that I lashed out for the wrong reason. I was just... angry, I guess? At the idea that I was trans.\n\n**Quint:** I'm sorry.\n\n**Andy:** Yeah. I'm still willing to move in, if you are.\n\n**Quint:** Of course I am.\n\n**Andy:** Really?\n\n**Quint:** Yep.\n\n**Andy:** Thank you. It means the world to me.\n\n**Quint:** And you moving in with me, too.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** Fireworks are going to go off soon.\n\n**Quint:** Yeah.\n\n...\n\n**Quint:** What do you want me to call you?\n\n**Andy:** What?\n\n**Quint:** Like, your name. Your pronouns. What do you want me to call you?\n\n**Andy:** You know-\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** I don't think that I've thought about it.\n\n**Quint:** I can use gender-neutral stuff, for now. If you would like.\n\n**Andy:** I wouldn't mind being called she/her, at least for now.\n\n**Quint:** Are you sure?\n\n**Andy:** Yep.\n\n**Quint:** Okay.\n\n...\n\n**Andy:** Thank you.\n\n**Quint:** Of course.\n\n**Andy:** I'm going to hang up.\n\n**Quint:** Alright.\n\n**Andy:** Talk soon. Bye.\n\n**Quint:** Bye.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nA minute passed.\n\nThen, the fireworks went off. Andy stood up, looking around to make sure all of her windows were closed. She hated the smell of smoke. Andy lit a candle before returning to her couch.\n\nAndy pressed space, and resumed her movie.\n\n[[=]]\n----\nJanuary 1,\n2024\n\n00:02 A.M.\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n...........\n\n[[=]]\n----\nFebuary 25,\n2024\n\n11:42 A.M.\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThe car parked on the curb, only a few dozen feet away from Quint's apartment.\n\nThe weather app had told her that it would be foggy in the morning. Bright beams of sunshine shone into her car directly on her face, taunting her.\n\nFrom her backpack, Andy produced a handmirror. Checking her makeup, it dawned on her that whatever little makeup she had on was rushed and shoddy.\n\nMuch like before, her lipstick veered away from the track of her lips, her eyeliner was shaky, and she could easily point out how different the blush was to her skin color. Hell, even her nails seemed off. She felt them, noticing bumps and uneven application.\n\nTwo whole hours had been spent to apply the makeup just to make it look presentable. Not good, not decent, but presentable!\n\nAll so she could make a thirty-one-second walk to Quint's house and not be noticed.\n\nIt was in vain, a stupid idea. She slammed her head back against her seat.\n\nThe longer she stayed in the car the more likely it would be for more people to notice.\n\nShe left and practically ran to Quint's door.\n\nHer clothes didn't match, either. Black cargo pants, a white long-sleeved undershirt, and a green branded t-shirt. They didn't match with her makeup. Anybody would instantly think that she was a boy pretending to be-\n\nShe arrived at the door. Time slowed, every movement became heavy. Every breath she took was forced. A knock barely left her hand before she froze, feeling minutes pass.\n\nThen the door opened.\n\nQuing lunged at Andy with a hug.\n\n\"Hey Andy! How was the trip.\"\n\nThrough the pressure on her lungs, she spoke.\n\n\"Good.\"\n\n\"I like your makeup.\"\n\nAll of the pressure, all at once, faded.\n\n\"Thank you.\"\n\n\"How much do you have to unpack?\"\n\n\"A bit.\"\n\n\"Well, let's go, then.\"\n\nThe duo spent three hours to empty Andy's car and make trips to Andy's old apartment.\n\nIt took two trips back to Andy's apartment to get everything.\n\nThe last item the pair got was a Dutch oven. Andy had contemplated not bringing it, to just leave it behind. But they knew they had to keep it.\n\nShe left the car and slowly carried the Dutch oven. She had to keep a slower pace to avoid dropping it. After two minutes, she arrived at her apartment door and brought the Dutch oven in with her.\n\n...\n\nAndy awoke. She turned over, and grabbed her phone. She checked the time.\n\n//April 7, 4:37 A.M.//\n\nShe leaned back against her pillow. Her alarm wasn't supposed to go off until eight. Andy closed her eyes, trying to go back to sleep. After eleven minutes, she opened her eyes.\n\nAndy rolled out of her bed. She stretched, letting out a yawn as she grabbed a glass on her nightstand. She drank out of it, quickly finding it empty. Andy began to hobble to the kitchen.\n\nAndy took out her ice tray. She popped out three ice cubes, plopping them in the glass. She then went to the sink and filled her cup with tap water.\n\nAndy took out her phone.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> I got a new apartment\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> ?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> with quint\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> When was this?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> yesterday\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> Why didn't you tell me about this?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n> it was about the same as my current rent. a bit less, actually\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n> Okay.

All from her mom, all angry. Some telling her off for having cussed. Some for being ungrateful. Some for not talking to her anymore. Some saying that Andy hated her. Some which claimed that Andy never wanted to visit.\n\nAnd then there was one question to top it all off.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\n> Do you even really love me?\n[[/<]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nShe didn't respond to it.

A head rested on her right shoulder. She felt a form lean against her back.\n\n\"It's early for you to be up.\"\n\nWhispered a groggy, half-asleep voice.\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Mm.

She placed it in her mouth and downed it with a glass of water.\n\nAs she stared out of her kitchen window. She stretched out her hand, moving aside the vines of all three of her Golden Pothos plants.\n\nThe sun began to set. An orange hue sprayed with magenta was overtaking the Rocky Mountain skyline. Andy wanted to drive out to see it. She took out her phone to text Quint. She wanted to ask them if they wanted to drive into the mountains.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Mom\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[>]]\n> Have you even loved me at all over the past few years?\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\nIt lingered.

Andy- why didn't you tell me?\n\n**Andy:** I don't know.\n\n**Susan:** You don't know?\n\n**Andy:** I just-\n\n**Susan:** So you're telling me that you didn't think to approach your mother about this?!\n\n**Andy:** Mom, I-\n\n**Susan:** No, I mean. That clearly shows that you didn't think this through that well.\n\n**Andy:** Oh my god...\n\n**Susan:** We need to talk this over a bit. You know, make sure that you've figured it out-\n\n**Andy:** No.\n\n**Susan:** What did you say to me?\n\n**Andy:** I'm saying, no.\n\n**Susan:** No?\n\n**Andy:** I've already thought this through. I've figured it out since December - nearly half a year now. I was thinking about it for a long time before that. It isn't getting that much more thought through.\n\n**Susan:** You figured it out in December?\n\n**Andy:** Yeah.\n\n**Susan:** Did you figure it out before or after you visited?\n\n**Andy:** During.\n\n**Susan:** And you didn't think to even tell me-\n\n**Andy:** I //did// think to tell you. I thought about it a lot. I was //scared// to tell you. I've been scared of it ever since.\n\n**Susan:** Oh, sweetie...\n\n**Andy:** Look- I didn't want any arguments. I didn't want to yell at each other. I didn't want to bring you on this around the holidays. This is right for me. It will make me happier.\n\n**Susan:** So- so you're saying that you lied to me? For all of these months? Because what?! You don't trust me?\n\n**Andy:** I didn't want to lose ties to you like Aunt Shelley did.\n\n**Susan:** ...\n\n**Andy:** ...\n\n**Susan:** You're sure it will make you happy?\n\n**Andy:** Yes.\n\n**Susan:** I'm not entirely too sure I understand it, but-\n\n**Andy:** ...\n\n**Susan:** I guess you know what you're doing with it.\n\n**Andy:** Thank you.\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\nA laugh left Andy's lips.\n\n\"You know- I honestly didn't expect her to react how she did.\"\n\n...\n\n\"I thought it would go really, really bad. Disowning, all that stuff.\"\n\n\"But... It went well?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nQuint hugs Andy.\n\n\"Are you okay? Be honest with me.\"\n\n\"I am, I am.\"\n\n\"You're sure?\"\n\n\"I just-\"\n\n...\n\n\"I just needed a place to clear my head.\"\n\n\"Of course.\"\n\n\"I was so worried about how bad she'd react that I don't really know what to do now.\"\n\n\"You should lay down. Clear your head, look in the sky some more. There is time to figure that out later.\"\n\n\"When?\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"When is that time?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\"\n\n\"That's why I was thinking. Just thinking about how much my life is going to fucking suck now.\"\n\n...\n\n\"And I only mean that as a half-joke, too!\"\n\n\"Andy...\"\n\n\"No, it's like- fucking living my life how I want to live is going to be so hard. People out there are actively judging me, trying to kill people like me. I would say that I can't be caught dead going to a place like West Virginia, but if I did go there is a good chance I would be!\"\n\n\"I know.\"\n\n\"You do?\"\n\n\"Yes, I do.\"\n\n\"Do you know how it feels every time I take a shower, or a bath, or change and I just see a dick hanging between my legs? Just- every morning I have to accept that it'll be there. And that if I want to remove that one, disgusting part of my body I'll have to go nearly into debt to possibly pay for a surgery that will only give me a //replication// of a vagina instead of the actual thing? All while people tell me I'm making a mistake and make me go through every hurdle and loop just to //possibly// get surgery that will make me feel just //a little// bit more like myself. And, hell - what if they're right about me making a mistake? What if I just...\n\n\"We've all gone through that, Andy. When I was figuring out some rough stuff about myself, I questioned every single day that I wore a binder, wore less makeup, styled my hair differently, eventually cut it off, and just every single piece of the journey.\"\n\n\"And you never regretted it?\"\n\n\"Nope. Never did.\"\n\n\"What about your sister?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"I love her. I really do love her. But she just doesn't see me as who I am. We yelled at each other and haven't spoken since. But despite all of that, I still don't regret me being who I am. I wouldn't take it back for a day.\"\n\n...\n\n\"The clouds are starting to clear.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Shame the sun is coming up soon.\"\n\n\"What time is it?\"\n\n\"Five twenty-seven A.M.\"\n\n\"Jesus. I should've made you come home sooner.\"\n\n\"Give me another half hour.\"\n\n\"Okay.\"\n\n\"Or, I could just sleep right here.\"\n\n\"I think it would be comfier at home.\"\n\n\"Really?\"\n\n\"Mhm.\"\n\n...\n\nThe sun rose and shone new light upon the entire day. The pair stood although both were exceptionally tired.\n\n\"Quint?\"\n\n\"Yeah?\"\n\n\"I honestly can't wait for Spring to kick into full gear.\"\n\n...\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[>]]\n2 mg / day\n[[/>]]\n----\nEstradiol Transdermal System, USP\nRx Only\n[[size 75%]] **Delivers 2 mg / day** [[/size]]\n----\n\n**Important:** Package //not// child-resistant.

It clearly had some sort of use, being wrinked and worn. But she just couldn't remember why.\n\nSomething became a blank slate in her memory. An idea that she just couldn't remember.\n\nSo, with no use for a piece of paper that meant nothing to her, she tore it in half and threw it away.\n\nThen she checked every ingredient in her kitchen. All of her cupboards, her fridge, her counter. She gathered everything she could.\n\nAnd then, Andie began to experiment.\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ Potato Leek Soup\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n+++ Ingredients:\n\n* Loaf of Sourdough Bread\n* 6 oz of Salami\n* 6 Leeks\n* 6 Potatoes\n* Chicken Broth/Stock\n* 1 Cup of Cream\n* 4 Cloves of Garlic\n* Pepper\n* Garlic Powder\n* Onion Powder\n* Cayenne Powder\n* MSG\n* Celery Salt\n* Salt\n* Brown Sugar\n* 2 Bay Leaves\n* 1 Sprig of Rosemary\n\n----\n\n+++ Tools:\n\n* Dutch Oven/Soup Pot\n* Spatula\n* Ladle\n* Cutting Board\n* Knife\n* Mixing Bowl\n* Immersion Blender\n\n----\n\n+++ Preparation:\n\nPlace your cold pot on your stovetop. Do not turn on the heat.\n\nTake the salami and cut into chunks. Peel and dice all six of your garlic cloves. Make sure that you have at least six cups of chicken broth/stock available, although have more ready if you can.\n\nSlice off the root of your leeks. Then, cut your leeks once length-wise down the middle. Chop all of your leeks from the whites up until the greek stalks become dry. Place all of the chopped leeks in the mixing bowl, and bring them to the sink. Begin to fill the bowl with water as you use your hands to massage the chopped leeks, doing so to remove all of the dirt and sediment. Fill up to the top of the bowl with water. The leeks should float at the top of your bowl.\n\n(Optionally peel your potatoes). Wash off your potatoes thoroughly to remove dirt and excess starch. Chop into small chunks.\n\n----\n\n+++ Cooking:\n\nIn your cold pot, place all of your diced salami. Make sure that there is no water or oil in the pot. Turn the temperature up to medium-high (As the temperature of the pot increases, fat will render out of the salami. This should produce enough fat to dually cook the salami and all other ingredients you need to fry before putting in stock. Any other fatty meat would work as a substitute.). Let simmer for 2 - 5 minutes, until a thin layer of fat covers the pot. Begin stirring salami after one minute.\n\nAfter roughly a minute, add in your garlic. Let simmer for a further minute before removing the leeks from your bowl and place them into the pot (As said before, all of the leeks should float. Try to minimize the amount of water going into the pot. While some water is inevitable, putting in too much water with the leek will prevent the leeks from frying.).\n\n**DO NOT** pour remaining water in the bowl down your sink. There should be visible amounts of sand and debris that sink down to the bottom of your bowl, which may be harmful for your drainage. The water is great to use for watering your plants. If not, simply pour the water outside.\n\nStir frequently and let simmer for around three more minutes. After the time has passed, add in your potatoes. Stir roughly twice a minute for three minutes. (Cooking the potatoes and leeks ahead of boiling them helps the entire dish cook faster, as well as giving them browning and flavor.)\n\nWhen the potatoes are done simmering, add in enough chicken broth/stock. If you like thicker soups, make sure to add enough stock to just //barely// cover the other ingredients. If you like lighter soups, add in enough stock to cover the ingredients by one or two inches.\n\nWith the stock in, turn the temperature up to high. While the soup begins to boil, add in both bay leaves and a tablespoon of brown sugar (Brown sugar makes every recipe taste better). Frequently stir and scrape the bottom of the pot to avoid burning.\n\nOnce the soup has reached a boil, reduce the heat to low/medium-low and stir until the soup is reduced to a simmer. Let simmer for 15 - 30 minutes. Check your potatoes every 2 - 3 minutes starting at around ten minutes. Once your potatoes are easily piercable with a fork, they are ready.\n\nAdd in your seasonings. You can choose different seasonings depending on your personal taste preferences. If you choose to add both salt and celery salt, make sure to minimize the amount of standard salt you apply accordingly to how much celery salt you put in (I personally only put half as much salt in as I do celery salt).\n\nUse your spatula to fish out both bay leaves. Add in your cup of cream. Add more or less cream depending on your desired coloration. No matter how much you add, let your cream simmer for a few minutes until it separates and a thin layer forms on the soup. This should also be accompanied by the soup thickening.\n\nTurn off your heat and take out your immersion blender. Puree the soup to your desired consistency.\n\nAfter you are done pureeing, add in your rosemary.\n\nServe the soup in a bowl with a side of sourdough bread. Rip off chunks of the sourdough and dip in the soup to eat.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n[[>]]\n- Andie Clarke\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
