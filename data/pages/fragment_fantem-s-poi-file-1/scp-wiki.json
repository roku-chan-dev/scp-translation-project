I'm Fantem.\n\nI got my start in creative writing right here on the SCP Wiki, way back in 2012, when I was just a senior in high school. I've been here since late-Series 1, and deciding to join the Wiki and grow as a creator has been one of the best decisions of my life.\n\nAs an author, I pride myself on creating deep settings, natural dialogue, and long narratives that feel like short ones through good flow and aesthetic. As I gained experience, I found that I also enjoy making CSS themes, and adding style through typography and iconography. \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n----\n----\n+++ Capone\n^^Date:  1 Mar 2013^^\n^^Genre: Horror, Character Focused, Fantasy^^\n^^Rating: 590+^^\n^^Comments: 34^^\n//[[[Capone]]]// is a story about [[[SCP-1471]]] (written by [[*user LurkD]]), a digital monster that haunts your phone, and stands as my highest-rated article.
