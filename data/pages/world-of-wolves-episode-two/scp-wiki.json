Ok, so, he once said he rode a big firecracker all the way to the ‘Unturned Plateau’, he called it..”\n\nAs Scarf rambled, the Old Man quietly considered… a lot of things.\n\nKnowing what little he did about the true state of the world, he did not hold the same conviction as Scarf did that this enigmatic “owner” would just be waiting at his house for a simple piece of winter gear.\n\nBeyond that apprehension, though, there was a growing concern within the Old Man’s mind, a nagging suspicion that blanketed his thoughts like the deluges of a flood:\n\nThere was a possibility - and a rather large one, at that - that his curse might not have fully abated; that the Brothers’ wrath wouldn’t be stifled completely by a simple deal, that he would soon bring that same suffering upon his newfound companion.\n\nBoth these thoughts shadow the Old Man as he weaves his way through the forest, clouding his vision as palpably as a high mountain blizzard.\n\nSo preoccupied was his mind, in fact, that he does not notice the sudden, frantic motions of Scarf until they tighten around the Old Man’s neck like a wet noose, snapping him to attention.\n\n“//ack-// What- what is it?”\n\n“To the right, behind that thicket! I hear something!” Scarf quietly whispers, in contrast to their prior, chipper tone.\n\nThe pair falls silent as the Old Man tries to listen, a challenge with how dulled his hearing has become across the ages.\n\nEventually, though, he manages to catch a soft clicking noise, evidently mechanical from its even pace & sharp tone.\n\nSlowly, with stealth honed from centuries of practice, the Old Man sneaks right up to the thicket, and tries to peer through it, with Scarf anxiously attempting to follow suit.\n\nAnd there, in a small valley a good distance ahead, stands an eclectic trio of strange machines, their forms gleaming in the moonlight.\n\nThe clicking comes from a bronze, wireframe automaton with an anatomy akin to a beast of burden, its head replaced by a large gear that loudly rotates in its neck-socket.\n\nAnother machine stands close by, starkly contrasting its companion by virtue of its rectangular build, supported on a large metal stump connected to four cylindrical legs arranged in a cross-pattern. \n\nThe third robot stands a distance away, bearing the most humanoid proportions of the group, though this did not count for much due to its lack of a head, as well as a black, rod-like right arm, a grey tube for its left, and no hands to speak of.\n\nWhat concerns the Old Man the most, however, was that all three machines appeared to be spattered in a considerable amount of dark fluid, as well as a clearer, less identifiable one.\n\nAs the Old Man watches, the humanoid slowly rotates its torso, revealing a camera lens embedded in the center. The others moved to flank it, as a small black rod suddenly juts out of a hole in the humanoid’s shoulder.\n\n“…w-who.. who are those guys?” Scarf’s voice was the quietest the Old Man had ever heard it.\n\n“…I do not know.” The Old Man keeps his voice low as well, while still maintaining his level tone. “But I presume that they would not mean well for us.”\n\n“..d-do we run?”\n\n“That would likely draw their attention. I would suggest we instead retreat at a slow and measured pace - or, rather, //I// should do so, seeing as-”\n\nSuddenly, a soft breeze kicks up, blowing into the pair from behind.\n\nAlmost immediately after, the humanoid’s antenna starts beeping with the pace & intensity of a bomb timer, and all three automatons rapidly maneuver themselves to face the thicket.\n\n“…Never mind, their attention has been drawn, and I suggest we run.”\n\nWith that, the Old Man breaks into a sprint as Scarf clings to his neck with a vice-like grip, and the forest fills with whirrs and clanks as the machines give chase.\n\nOn his right, the bronze robot gallops through the brush as two long, jointed arms unfold from its sides; one bearing a pair of stained shears on its end, and the other a long, hollow, equally stained rod.\n\nHe veers to the left, only to see an array of black, pointed tendrils snaking between the trees, all leading back to the rectangular robot. \n\nSaid robot’s front has opened like a fridge to reveal a human-shaped hole at the center of its interior, with a large concentration of what is definitely blood near the head area.\n\nThe Old Man moves back towards the right, only for Scarf to shriek and yank his neck downwards as he hears a loud snap where his head just was.\n\nThe shears retract back toward their owner, before lunging for the Old Man’s arm, which he pulls away in time to only tear his coat. \n\nThe tendrils then start closing in, and the Old Man has to veer towards the bronze robot to avoid being snagged.\n\nThe shears move again, and with every clean dodge the Old Man achieves, there is an instance where metal grazes his skin, leaving clean, linear wounds.\n\nScarf is, at this point, coiling so tightly around the Old Man’s neck that it’s slightly asphyxiating, their only speech being soft whimpering.\n\nIt’s at this point that the Old Man has the brilliant idea of stopping dead, and then sprinting right; his two pursuers keep forward long enough for him to gain considerable ground before they stop to reorient.\n\nThe Old Man allows himself a small, silent chuckle, for somehow retaining enough stamina after all this time to be able to outwit pursuers so smoothly.\n\nThis confidence fades when he realizes he hasn’t seen the humanoid robot at all, and then vanishes entirely when said robot shoves hard into his right side, sending him tumbling across the dirt into the trunk of a tree.\n\nScarf unspools from The Old Man’s neck and tries to hastily slither away, but their pace slows as the robot’s tube-arm whirrs to life. The detritus of the forest is sucked in with force, and Scarf has to wrap around a tree branch to avoid following suit.\n\nRoused by the noise, the Old Man manages to shakily rise, in time to watch as the robot’s other arm somehow splits into two thinner arms, despite lacking a seam.\n\nThe ends of both new arms each then start blurrily morphing as if sped up in a timelapse; the bottom one settling into a white, plasticine claw, and the top into a smooth, circular saw-blade of identical color.\n\nBefore the Old Man can react, the claw wraps around his throat, pinning him to the tree behind. He tries to remove it, but the metal of the arm is too slick and oily.\n\nThe robot walks forward, keeping its tube-arm trained on Scarf, whose grip is evidently starting to fail. Their screams are drowned out by the sound of the vacuum. \n\nThe robot’s saw moves forward, orienting itself to be perpendicular to the Old Man’s forehead, just above his eyes. It moves in slowly, with medical precision, the camera-eye watching impassively as the Old Man desperately attempts to both free himself and hold the blade away.\n\nSaid blades closes to three inches away, then two..\n\n@@ @@\nOne…\n@@ @@\n\n//thud//\n\nThe saw stops a fourth of an inch from the Old Man’s skin.\n\n//thud thud thud//\n\nThe robot’s torso turns to its right, thankfully moving the saw away, but keeping the claw around the Old Man’s throat.\n\n//thud thud THUD THUD THUD//\n\nThe Old Man also directs his gaze in the direction of the distant, heavy impacts, and notices a large figure lumbering out from the darkness.\n\n//THUD THUD THUD THUD//\n\nAs it approaches, the figure’s shape becomes identifiable as humanoid, and its movement becomes identifiable as a full sprint.\n\n**//CRUNCH//**\n\nThe robot barely has time to back away slightly before a large, stone foot slams into its midsection, releasing the Old Man as the automaton careens through the air, right into the trunk of another tree.\n\nThe Old Man looks up at his savior, now identifiable as a giant statue of a monkey, constructed from a gray, cement-like substance; clad in carved garments of seemingly Ancient Chinese design, and sporting a large, intricately carved pillar upon its back, held in place by its tail.\n\nScarf, now freed from the vacuum’s pull, shakily slithers back onto the Old Man’s neck, covered in soil and foliage.\n\nThe statue pays both no mind, as it turns its attention to the other two robots, who charge forth from the brush (or reach forth, in one’s case).\n\nThe bronze one darts haphazardly across the forest floor, loping around the left of the statue, and beelining for the Old Man & Scarf, both shears & chute bared.\n\nThe statue - in one fluid, frighteningly quick motion - turns, pulls the pillar from its back, and brings it down upon both the quadruped’s extended arms, stopping it dead a mere foot from the shellshocked pair.\n\nWith its other hand, the statue pulls the struggling robot away, dismembering both of the arms in the process, before crushing the bronze frame of the machine’s body within the monkey’s massive palm. \n\nThe robot’s broken corpse falls stiff to the earth, seemingly bleeding a grey, gelatinous substance in addition to actual blood.\n\nThe Old Man barely manages to comprehend the entire sequence before he feels something wrap around his ankles, and then yank his legs out from under him.\n\nMore black tendrils wrap around both him, a fleeing Scarf, and the monkey statue, as the boxy robot slowly ambles forward, a harsh thrumming emanating from its open, bloodied interior as the Old Man is slowly dragged closer.\n\nWith an oddly calm pace, the statue drops its pillar, reaches behind to grab several tendrils with one hand, and pulls, placing the extra length into its other hand before repeating.\n\nEventually, there’s a loud thud from the inside of the box, and it subsequently topples over onto its front.\n\nThe Old Man watches as the automaton is pulled right up to the back of the statue, and then winces as the giant then smoothly falls backwards, directly onto the robots’ immobilized form.\n\nThe tendrils holding the Old Man spasm slightly before going limp, and he rises once more as the statue rolls off of the crushed box, the once mostly-spotless cement skin now layered with dark, gritty stains.\n\nA soft, erratic beeping draws the attention of both to the humanoid, which is struggling to rise from the dark puddle at the base of the trunk where it impacted, its bottom half almost perpendicular to its upper.\n\nThe automaton’s cracked camera-eye gazes up with seeming resentment as the statue ambles over to it, before the beeping falls silent as a bare stone foot pushes the robot’s plasticine chest into the soaked dirt, before cracking all the way through.\n\nThe Old Man watches, Scarf coiled around his arm, as the statue retrieves its pillar, and secures it back under its tail, before turning to face the pair.\n\nSlowly, almost cautiously, the statue approaches, its hands raised in an apparent show of non-hostility.\n\nEventually, it kneels on one leg before the pair, its face set in a beaming, toothy smile.\n\nScarf is the first of the pair to speak up, in a meek, shivering cadence:\n\n“…erm, h-hello, Mr. G-Giant Monkey Man! Th-th-th-thank you for saving us from.. from those mean r-rrobot guys.”\n\nA moment of silence, as the pair stare up at the unmoving monolith.\n\n“…s-so, could we m-maybe, uh.. know some- some things about you?”\n\nMore silence.\n\n“I- I mean, it’s okay if.. if you don’t want t- //*eep!*”//\n\nScarf is interrupted by a steady grinding noise, as the monkey’s jaw slowly opens, revealing a solid wall behind, save for an rectangular inset…\n\n…bearing a digital phone.\n\nAfter another brief pause, the phone’s screen flashes to life, and the white outline of a top hat fades in over a blank, black background.\n\nA pair of white ovals then appear within the outline, spanning the hat’s whole height, followed by two black “pupils” the size of pinholes, which then “focus” upon the Old Man & Scarf.\n\n{{ oh hello there new buddies!! }}\n\nThe voice is sudden, loud, and grating, with a quality the Old Man finds hard to describe, but //very// easy to recognize.\n\nThe noise almost sends Scarf off the Old Man’s neck, which seems to amuse the hat-being.\n\n{{ aw did i scare you sorry teehee XD }}\n\nNow it is the Old Man’s turn to speak “Who.. what are you?”\n\nThe hat-thing’s eyes momentarily turn to upside-down “V”s.\n\n{{ oh right i should introduce myself. my name is [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2522 hatbot], but most call me an asshat haha }}\n\nThe sound of drums & cymbals, tainted with a certain grittiness.\n\n“…Right. And may we know why you are here, in this..” \n\nThe Old Man struggles to find the words to describe the statue. \n\n“…this giant monkey man?”\n\n{{ oh right, that }} \n\n{{ hang on let me get the script }}\n\n“Hatbot’s” eyes look to the right, at some unseen object within their own world.\n\n{{ it’s just under these prayers one sec }}\n\nThe sound of rustling papers, also bearing that same grit, and repeating every four seconds.\n\n{{ man, fat lot of good these did. WAN probably wasn't even real lol }}\n\n{{ that or the Haven killed him. them. it? i wouldn't know, never answered my calls :] }}\n\nThe Old Man has a momentary double-take.\n\n“Wait, you have knowledge on th-“\n\n{{ found it }}\n\nThe rustling ceases, and Hatbot’s pupils recenter, but at the bottom of the eyes, as if looking down at something in its’ own world.\n\n{{ alright gotta get my speech voice back in shape }}\n\nA throat clearing, followed by gargling, then a sneeze, and then a coughing fit.\n\n{{ sorry xp }}\n\nWhen Hatbot next speaks, it’s in a deep & baritone dialect, entirely dissimilar to its voice prior.\n\n{{ //“By the request of President [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1474   Xiu Lidao], Great Sage, Equal of Heaven, and leader of the Twelve Galaxies Coalition, you are invited to join the new society of Earth, as defined by its new citizens. We will provide shelter, supplies, and support, in exchange for your cooperation. We hope you will take this offer.// In Solidarity We Are United.” }}\n\nAnother throat clearing, before Hatbot returns to their prior voice.\n\n{{ the president part’s where he got this statue from, btw. subsumed the position a few weeks ago, now [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2762 twenty-seven-whatever-the-fuck] is his own personal pet }}\n\n{{ it is better than the snakes were, though, i’ll give the Haven that lolol }}\n\n“So you know what the Haven of Man is?” The Old Man interrupts.\n\nA moment of silence.\n\n{{ . . . if i say we do you’ll come see my boss  right < — < }}\n\nThe Old Man thinks, for a moment, his brow furrowing in thoughtful apprehension.\n\nScarf looks between him & Hatbot, before whispering in the Old Man’s ear.\n\n“…what’s a ‘haven of man’?”\n\n“I suppose we may both know soon enough, if we agree to follow this strange hat-being, but..”\n\n“…but what?” Scarf’s voice belies their confusion.\n\n“..I… ..I fear as though..”\n\n“…as though, i-if we partake in this offer, we will not reach your owner’s abode.” the Old Man’s speech is hasty, entirely unlike his prior eloquence.\n\n“Oh, that’s true; Baceloena //is// still very far away.” Scarf’s head-end seems to wobble, as if in thought.\n\n{{ . . . you know i’m still right here T _ T }}\n\nThe two turn back to Hatbot, as the icon’s pupils flick between the pair.\n\n{{ well good news }}\n\n{{ one of the things we have is a bunch of doors that can lead anywhere }}\n\n{{ maybe one of those is next to *Barcelona }}\n\n{{ sorry couldn’t resist :P }}\n\n“Couldn’t resist what?”\n\n{{ nothing dw ;) }}\n\n{{ anyway join us please we’re kind of desperate for any help because the brain-stealer attacks have been happening for weeks now and }}\n\nHatbot suddenly cuts off, looking into the distance.\n\n{{ speak of the devil }}\n\n{{ wait is that a phrase people still use }}\n\n{{ . . . eh who cares world’s already ended haha }}\n\nHatbot’s eyes refocus, now with a humored expression.\n\n{{ welp, seems like the choice has been made for you }}\n\n{{ i suggest you follow us, if you’d like to keep your brain in your skull }}\n\nHatbot takes a moment to eye up Scarf.\n\n{{ or as your body, that would work too @ v @ }}\n\n{{ anyways see ya }}\n\n{{ ,,. . . hey, that’s your cue to go, man <~<;,, }}\n\nThe statue’s jaw suddenly closes, before it calmly rises from its kneel and begins walking back in the direction from where it had arrived.\n\nThe Old Man & Scarf watch in its wake, before the former looks to their carrier.\n\n“…should we follow him?” Scarf’s voice indicates they have recovered slightly, though not completely.\n\n“…I suppose we could, but if that strange hat-being is to be believed, then there is in fact a larger society of my fellows, and I fear that if I am brought to them…”\n\nThe Old Man trails off, but the implications evade Scarf.\n\n“..B-but, he said he had a shortcut to Bacelona! We can probably at least check!” There’s an air of desperation in Scarf’s voice, mixed with the indignity of a child.\n\n“Well, that could be a dishonest ploy on his part, and we cannot waste travel time if we could help it.”\n\nThe Old Man starts walking, only to be halted as Scarf wraps around a nearby piece of foliage.\n\n“No, come on, we can spare the time, I’m sure!” \n\nScarf’s grip is firm and unyielding, and the Old Man has to temper his strength to avoid ripping the nerve cluster in two.\n\n“No, I am certain that we cannot, and I request you cease this immature behavior.” The Old Man’s cannot help but let annoyance slip into his cadence.\n\n“No, no, I want to see!” Scarf’s voice is shrill and impotent, as they tighten their hold at both ends.\n\nThis back-and-forth continues for a while, before the Old Man pauses, suddenly acutely aware.\n\n“…Say, do you hear that?”\n\nScarf also quiets down, and the two listen as the distant sound of marching becomes audible.\n\nLights suddenly dot the distant treeline, each one artificial, and all steadily growing in luminosity.\n\nThe Old Man sighs.\n\n“Well, then; thanks to your efforts, our agency in this matter seems to have been revoked.”\n\n“…Yeah, I guess so.” Scarf uncoils from the branch, and stares off into the horde of the horizon.\n\n“…we should be going now, right?”\n\n“Most likely.”\n\nAnd thus, they make haste.\n\n= **<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-of-wolves-episode-one|Episode One]]] |=| [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-of-wolves-hub|World Of Wolves]]] |=|  [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/world-of-wolves-interlude|Interlude]]] >>**",
