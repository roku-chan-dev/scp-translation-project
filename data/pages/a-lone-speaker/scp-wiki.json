Who knows.\n\nPicking up the mic that was left on the stage.\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url= http://firedawnfolder.wikidot.com/local--files/a-bloody-speaker/Bloody%20Speaker.mp3]]\n\n“I offer this poem in my own voice.”\n----\n\nI go to stand before a crowd, my life blue.\nFighting an undying urge to call to you, my love.\nWitnessed from below the blackened road of few, pools of crimson.\n\nKeeping calm and dry, unlike a certain two.\nWatching as they drown, within a slew of dew.\nHurting from your pain, the amount they caused you to suffer through.\n\nHow I miss the smell of your shampoo, my love, and joy.\nOh, how I wish we could begin anew, to keep creating memories.\nAlive and well, so I can hold on to you. My friend and lover.\n\nMy heart, my soul, my very being. Broken.\nHarmed for a lack of foreseeing. Dying.\nBy the groups of Imaginary unageing beings. Hatred flows.\n\nThe blood runs thick like black cherries. Along the wounds.\nMy mistakes for not being cautionary. The price too high.\nMy  entire life, fragmentary. The want to die.\n\nInstead of rambling on. Like past voice.\nAn effort to avoid bloodshed. Enough has spilled.\nI take my leave. To avoid my soul from being red. Staying blue.\n----\nA damaged being.\n\nA survivor.\n\nLeaves the stage changed.\n\nTil next week.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Bloody%20Speaker.mp3\n> **Author:** [[*user Doctor North]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-lone-speaker SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
