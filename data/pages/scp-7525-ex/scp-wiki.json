The SCP-7525-EX file itself represents the primary containment apparatus for a phenomenon classified SCP-5257. Use of this database slot is the only practical means of recording information pertaining to SCP-5257, which remains actively anomalous. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5257 is a \"Trojan Horse\" virus formerly infecting the SCiPNET servers, now isolated to the SCP-5257, SCP-5257-EX, and SCP-7525-EX database files. The former two files have been taken offline as of 05/17/2021; all attempts to view them will be met with an error or a notification from Site-19's Technical Department.\n\nUntil recently, SCP-5257 executed opportunistic vandalism attacks against slots in the SCP database. It appears to have a limited predictive capacity, as it tended to interact with empty database slots already slated for imminent official use. Statistical analysis established the following hierarchy of preferences:\n\n# Slots below SCP-1000;\n# Slots with numbers relevant to a file's proposed contents;\n# Slots below SCP-2000;\n# Slots with numbers having humorous associations;\n# Slots below SCP-3000;\n# Slots with aesthetically or sonically pleasant numbers;\n# Slots below SCP-4000.\n\nSCP-5257 attacked its targets by corrupting any existing data, inserting unwanted and extraneous new data, inserting SCP-5257-1, and reverting authorized edits by appropriate Foundation personnel.\n\nSCP-5257-1 is a photo with the file name slot_goblin.png which appeared in each slot affected by SCP-5257. It depicts a clean line-art rendering of a goblin, with two images of a man costumed as the Green Goblin from the //Spider-Man// franchise mirrored on the lower left-hand and right-hand corners. \"YOU HAVE BEEN GOBLINED BY THE SLOT GOBLIN\" //[sic]// and \"FUCK YOU AND YOUR SLOT\" //[sic]// appear on the top and bottom of the picture, respectively.\n\nWhile the image appears to be non-anomalous[[footnote]]It was downloaded onto a virtual machine which suffered no ill effects, even when connected to the SCiPNET test servers. [[/footnote]], it has proven exceedingly difficult to remove from affected files, and completely impossible to eradicate from SCiPNET as a whole. Its single persistent iteration was formerly hosted in the SCP-5257 slot; it is presently confined to SCP-7525-EX.\n\n**Addendum 5257.1:** Incident Log\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\nThe following is an abridged log of notable incidents related to SCP-5257 activity within the SCP Foundation database.\n\n**02/07/2015:** Agent Lament uploaded an SCP file to the [[[SCP-1848]]] slot. The file's \"common name,\" used informally to distinguish SCP files at a glance, has read [ACCESS DENIED] since its initial posting. All attempts to correct this have resulted in reversion, with an edit comment reading simply \"OOPS.\"\n//Stop bugging me about this, I'm retired -- Agent T. Lament//\n\n**05/13/2016:** The first occurrence of the \"Slot Goblin\" image appeared alongside corruption of the SCP-5257 file. The anomaly was classified SCP-5257 internally, though attempts to upload data on its effects to the related file were repeatedly reverted with an edit comment reading \"YOU CAN'T DEFINE THE SLOT GOBLIN!\"\n//We might not be able to fix this without abandoning SCiPNET altogether -- Dir. M. Jones//\n//I won't miss it -- Dir. P. Lague//\n\n**07/21/2019:** All unoccupied slots in the database were corrupted by SCP-5257. They now contained short unpublished drafts of unlikely anomalous objects not otherwise attested by Foundation sources, with a level of completion ranging from full descriptions with testing logs, to fragmentary Special Containment Procedures, to completely unintelligible gibberish. Edit comments included \"HOW DO I POST,\" \"IN PROGRESS DON'T DELETE,\" and \"LOL SNIPED.\"\n//Getting tired of cleaning this junk out -- H. Sturmatem//\n\n**10/14/2020:** Researcher Calvin's account uploaded an explained SCP file to the [[[SCP-5025]]] mainlist slot, rather than SCP-5025-EX. The edit comment read \"I DIDN'T READ THE INSTRUCTIONS LOL.\" Researcher Calvin denied uploading the file, and reported considerable backlash from his colleagues over the subversion of proper protocol.\n//I don't see the problem here -- Dir. R. House//\n\n**03/20/2021:** Drs. Blank and McDoctorate prepared an SCP file for an object known as the REISNO Cannon. They indicated a preference for the [[[SCP-5244]]] slot, as the item in question was thematically connected to both [[[SCP-5242]]] and [[[SCP-5243]]]. The slot had gone unused for nearly one year prior to this. They expressed this preference to Director Jones of RAISA; within one hour the slot had been corrupted by SCP-5257, with an edit comment reading \"LOL YOU HAD EIGHT MONTHS.\"\n//Research takes longer than eight months, asshole -- Dr. H. Blank//\n\n**06/10/2021:** Site-17's Labeling Team encountered a massive database corruption wherein 98% of all entries on SCiPnet had their organizational tags removed. These were eventually reinstated when the servers were disconnected and reconnected to their power source.\n//Turning it off and on again was my idea -- Jr. Designer S. Yvonne//\n\n**06/27/2021:** Dr. Septer removed an outdated file under the SCP-3775 designation. Upon its deletion, SCP-5257 immediately corrupted the slot. Later that same day, Junior Researcher Russ accidentally catalogued an entry in an out-of-range file series. This was subsequently corrected and SCP-5257 corrupted that slot.\n//I need a drink -- Dir. S. Andrews//\n\n**05/17/2022:** Through a series of extreme technical interventions, RAISA successfully isolated SCP-5257's mainlist activities to its own slot. Attempts to suppress the associated image were unsuccessful until the creation of the SCP-5257-EX slot describing the anomaly, at which point the image (and all further vandalism) transferred there. Damage to the original slot appears at present to be irreversible; the file refuses to load on most terminals in approximately 50% of recorded attempts.\n\n**Update:** SCP-5257 has now permanently disabled the SCP-5257-EX file. Its contents have been migrated to the present file, SCP-7525-EX, which remains stable for unknown reasons.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum 5257.2:** MTF Investigation:\n\nWALDO.aic was uploaded into the SCP-5257 file for the purposes of tracking it. Following the next flagged upload of SCP-5257-1, an originating location was pinged in the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania, USA. An edit comment accompanying this upload read \"Catch me if you can ;),\" and WALDO.aic was forcibly removed from the affected file.\n\nTwo members of MTF Ï†-103 \"Bark and Bite\" were deployed to the target location.\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n= **TRANSCRIPT**\n-----\n\n__Members__\nCommand - Dr. V. Brownley\nÏ†-103-6 Sycamore\nÏ†-103-34 Willow\n\n-----\n\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n//(A large, artificially carved tree stump is seen in the distance.

The creature appears to be composed of wood and foliage from the surrounding area, connected by metallic implements.)//\n\n**Command:** What is that?\n\n**Ï†-103 | Sycamore:** Doesn't seem dangerous. Permission to retrieve it?\n\n**Command:** Granted.\n\n//(Ï†-Sycamore grasps the automaton, henceforth SCP-5257-2, and pulls it out of the stump.)//\n\n**Ï†-103 | Sycamore:** Jesus!\n\n//(SCP-5257-2 is dropped.)//\n\n**Ï†-103 | Sycamore:** The fucker bit me!\n\n**Ï†-103 | Willow:** It ran back into the stump.\n\n**Command:** Alright, new tactic.\n\n**Ï†-103 | Willow:** Net?\n\n**Command:** Sure.\n\n//(SCP-5257-2 returns to the team, now holding a wax-sealed letter.)//\n\n**Ï†-103 | Willow:** Alright, no net then.\n\n**Ï†-103 | Sycamore:** I'm not putting my hands near that. \n\n//(SCP-5257-2 thrusts the letter into the air.)//\n\n**Command:** We need to get that letter.\n\n**Ï†-103 | Sycamore:** Tell me whatâ€” \n\n**Ï†-103 | Willow:** Drop it! Drop!\n\n//(SCP-5257-2 complies with Ï†-Willow's command. Ï†-Sycamore retrieves and opens the document.)//\n\n**Ï†-103 | Willow:** Good.\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[size 160%]]**THE MIRROR**[[/size]]\n\n**By Marlo Anderson**\n\nA goblin whose main duty in life is to fill in a file with something weird.

Despite this, SCP-5257 is still active and SCP-5257-1 continues to manifest despite deletions; whether further instances of SCP-5257-2 exist is unknown, and investigation is ongoing.
