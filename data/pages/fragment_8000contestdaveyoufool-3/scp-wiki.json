Operation Iconoclast consists of a 17-stage launch mechanism for an experimental payload consisting of 108 metric tons of Compound Elysium-1[[footnote]] (Note to staff: Compound Elysium-1 is a cognitohazard. Direct visual observation of any amount of the compound will lead to instant death.)[[/footnote]], SCP-████, and \"SPEER OF DESTANEE,\"  a special apparatus constructed by [[[SCP-2803]]]-A.[[footnote]] Due to the fact that another timeline's SCP-2803-A was the original creator of **[THE THREAT]**, SCP-2803-A's knowledge of its core programming has been crucial to our operations. [[/footnote]]\n\nIf Operation Iconoclast fails, **[THE THREAT]**'s file is to be deleted from the Foundation's database and cyanide caplets are to be distributed globally.\n\nIn addition, **[THE THREAT]** is to be referred to as **[THE THREAT]** and only **[THE THREAT]**. This has proven effective at slowing the spread of **[THE THREAT]**'s influence by subliminally instilling a preconceived negative association to potential followers.\n\n**Description:** **[THE THREAT]**, known to its followers as \"Pallit the Immaculate\" or \"the Goddess\", is a reality-warping entity that is not native to our reality. \n\nIt was initially discovered from documentation in a lead-lined capsule that had been sent to Site-59. According to those documents, **[THE THREAT]** was created as an AI construct by an iteration of SCP-2803-A from a parallel universe. However, it has since defied its programing and assumed reality-bending capabilities on a scale that is not completely understood.\n\n**INCIDENT-THE-THREAT-824:** On October 31st, 2023, two months after the capsule's data was integrated into the Foundation database as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp0012 SCP-001-THE], NBC, BBC, Al Jazeera, and 23 other networks worldwide were overridden with a six-minute video of  **[THE THREAT]** addressing viewers in English (and subtitles for other regions' respective languages).\n\nBased on the video, **[THE THREAT]**'s goal appears to be to assemble the \"group hug,\" for which it needs to gather all human beings in the multiverse, remove their ability to die, and perpetually incinerate them.\n\nFollowing this, there have been an increasing number of terrorist attacks from organizations of humans devoted to **[THE THREAT]**. (See Document-[DATA LOST] for more information.)\n\nIn addition, ever since **[THE THREAT]**'s \"partial ionospheric incarnation\" on [DATA LOST], a minimum of 2.5 billion civilians have been irretrievably captured for the \"Group Hug\", and [REMAINDER OF FILE CORRUPTED BEYOND REPAIR]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n+++ {{Opening PORPHYRIOSLOG512.RTF...}}\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n++++ Log Date: 12/29/[DATA LOST]\n\n<Begin Log>\n\n//(The boatswain, Ralph Rackstraw, enters Capt. Corcoran's private quarters.)//\n\n**Rackstraw:** ...you wanted to see me, sir?\n\n**Corcoran:** //You// did. Close the door, Ralph.\n\n//(He does.)//\n\n**Rackstraw:** May I ask why you've chosen your quarters for this meeting?\n\n**Corcoran:** One: unmatched privacy. Two: I have a suspicion that this is regarding our delivery for Operation Iconoclast.\n\n**Rackstraw:** Right... Remember that storm two days ago?\n\n**Corcoran:** Good Lord, how could I forget?\n\n**Rackstraw:** The containers for Iconoclast's payload tossed about just as much as the rest our cargo. And despite all the esoteric locking mechanisms, two of the doors busted open.\n\nThe conprocs were explicit in that making visual contact with Compound Elysium-1 could kill us, so the deckhands and I did what we could with the automated systems. But the second crate's door had to be closed manually. \n\n**Corcoran:** And to close it, you had to see what was inside.\n\n//(Rackstraw sighs through his nose.)//\n\n**Rackstraw:** If I wanted to close it //properly.//\n\n**Corcoran:** Well, now that you've survived a passing glance, what did you see?\n\n**Rackstraw:** A pile of surplus weightlifting equipment. \n\n**Corcoran:** Two metric tons, to be precise. An empty crate always weighs the same, so we had to fill it with //something.//\n\n**Rackstraw:** Now, unless I'm to believe Iconoclast involves a vigorous training regimen to beat THE THREAT at arm wrestling -- I'm worried about the project we've been enabling.\n\n**Corcoran:** So you think Operation Iconoclast is a placebo?\n\n**Rackstraw:** Placebos //work.// I'm worried that this is an instrument to instill false hope in the public. If so, it's immoral, and I want no part!\n\n//(Corcoran nods, thinking for a moment. He takes a long drink from a bottle of old cognac.)//\n\n**Corcoran:** ...you're a good seaman, Ralph. You've given us almost a decade of incomparable service.\n\n**Rackstraw:** Sir, I want to know the truth.\n\n**Corcoran:** And because you're so good, I think it's only fair that I share with you a little secret about something to look forward to.\n\n**Rackstraw:** I don't follow you. \n\n**Corcoran:** The Foundation does have a way to keep THE THREAT out of our dimension -- but it isn't Iconoclast. That's just to distract her from what O5-12's got cooked up.\n\n**Rackstraw:** Which is...?\n\n**Corcoran:** A change of management. I don't know much more than what I've already told you. But by this time next month, I can guarantee you two things:\n\n# THE THREAT will never hurt us again.\n# Everyone who helped O5-12 -- including us -- are in for the mother of all promotions...\n\n<End Log>\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n+++ {{Opening PORPHYRIOSLOG591.RTF...}}\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n++++ Log Date: 1/1/[DATA LOST]\n\n//(Rackstraw sits in a bed in his private quarters. He sweats heavily, kneading his forehead. This is recorded from his laptop's camera.)//\n\n//(He sighs heavily.)//\n\n**Rackstraw:** The plan worked. ...they got THE THREAT.\n\nI guess we can go back to calling her Pallit, at least for now.\n\nThey didn't //kill// Pallit or anything. I don't think that's even possible. But Twelve says we don't have to worry about her anymore.\n\nThought I'd be happier... I guess I'm just under the weather. Heard there was a bug going around -- I knew the mess hall wasn't clean. It's even got the word \"mess\" in it. \n\nMaybe I'll feel better once I know what's involved with this \"promotion\" they promised us. \n\n...\n\nIt's fucking cold. I know it's January, but I'm off the coast of the Carolinas.
