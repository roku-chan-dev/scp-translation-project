The one on the left is dressed in an outfit mixed between laboratory chic and witch's attire. She has a capricious look on her face and her arms are outstretched, encouraging her friend towards the door. The other girl, the one on the right, is wearing a green dress with golden trims and a blue bow on the back. She has a large tome tucked under one arm and a white snake coiled around the other. All around them, doors are swirling in a vortex and floating into the sky.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"widebox\"]]\n[[div]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp8000contesthub/8kon_logo.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"bannerseparator\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp8000contesthub/separator.png]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"aria-invisible\"]]\nImage: Logo in ornate text that says \"SCP-8000 CONTEST: Fantasy\"\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n\n+++ For a site with as varied history as ours, we've surprisingly never done this before.

This page must be posted by you (or, if it is a collaboration, one of the collaborators). Give your entry a title with the format \"SCP-8000 — <Your Title>\".\n\n**2.** Add the tag \"{{8000}}\" to your entry so it shows up on this page.\n\n[[=]]\n-- **Do not post before posting opens; this will result in a disqualification!** --\n[[/=]]\n\n**3.** Post your top five slot selections (excluding the 8000), in descending order if applicable, in the comment section of your article. Failure to do so may result in losing your place in the queue and your article being assigned an arbitrary placement.\n\n+ Tagging:\n\nAs previously stated, adding the tag \"{{8000}}\" to your entry will cause it to show up on this page. We encourage you to also //tag your entries yourself// if you feel comfortable with doing so.  To make the whole process smoother, we have [[[a-laymen-s-guide-to-tagging|Laymen's Tagging Guide]]] and a [https://05command.wikidot.com/tech-hub-tag-list list of all current tags]. Please make sure to consult these when self-tagging, they're great resources!\n\n[[=]]\n-- **Do not add the \"{{scp}}\" tag yourself! This must be performed by a member of the tagging team!** --\n[[/=]]\n\nIf you have any questions, feel free to ask anyone in the [https://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main#toc8 tagging subteam] for assistance, either via Wikidot PM or on [https://discord.gg/G8WypMXYNQ MAST's official Discord server].\n\n+ Rules:\n\n* Be kind to others. Unsporting conduct will not be tolerated and can lead to disqualification of your entry.\n\n* Placing is based on net vote total, in descending order. The prize for winning the contest will be your entry having the SCP-8000 slot. Runners-up get to choose other slots in the new Series in order of place of finish.\n\n* Voting should be based on the merits of the article alone, not whether or not you believe it deserves to win the contest. Voting on a piece based on your desire to see it win or lose the contest is grounds for disqualification.\n\n* Only one entry is allowed per user. Collaborations are allowed, but that will count as the one entry for all collaborators.\n\n* Pre-existing drafts are allowed, so long as they have never been posted to the wiki.\n\n* You are permitted to edit your article, but not wholly replace it. Although you are allowed to add and remove sections to your article, ultimately the central idea of your article should remain the same. This also means that any edits that would comprehensively replace or overwrite your original work will be prohibited. In the case of having an article with planned updates or something similar that we have seen in prior contests, **contestants need to provide the finished product to contest marshals first. Any delayed posting updates should occur within the posting period.** This is to help ensure that contestants are given the freedom to be creative with their works while at the same time preventing the possibility of some contestants being able to obtain \"additional time\" to work on their entry after the end of the posting period. The only edits allowed after the posting period are minor ones. If unsure over whether an edit would violate these terms, please consult a contest marshal.\n\n* Blurbs added to your entry for display on this hub can not exceed 240 characters in length, or otherwise take up excessive amount of space.\n\n* Contest entries will undergo normal deletion processes.\n\n* 'Fantasy' shall be interpreted very broadly. So long as you can explain how your work relates to Fantasy as a concept, in any interpretation, it'll likely be accepted. The theme is here to inspire, not constrain. If you're not sure if it'll count, feel free to ask one of the contest marshals listed below.\n\n* Articles can be anonymously submitted to the contest, as per the [[[anonymous-articles|Guide to Anonymous Articles]]]. For the contest, please allow a 48-hour period between submission and posting. This means that the Curation Team will not accept articles past February 17th, 12:01 AM EST. Anonymously-posted articles will be put into a queue and posted at regular intervals by the Curation Team.\n\n* If your contest submission includes images, we strongly encourage you to have [[*user Naepic]] review them, either on Wikidot or on the official Discord. This is to ensure a quick review of their usability and ensure that no user wastes time working with copyrighted images. It also saves time having to track down authors after the posting period.\n\n* **There will be no extensions.**\n\n* Any usage of banned AI-generated content, as defined by [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/site-rules#toc2 Section II.7 of the Site Rules], is prohibited. Attempts to circumvent this ban will result in a contest ban and forwarded to the Disciplinary Team.\n\n* Any contestant who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests with the possibility of further disciplinary action being taken depending upon the act in question. Examples of shenanigans include, but are in not limited to:\n * Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of posting.\n * Spamming other users with messages concerning your work.\n * Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's.\n\n* The contest marshals for the SCP-8000 contest are [[*user Modulum]], [[*user Naepic]], [[*user psychicprogrammer]], and [[*user WhiteGuard]]. As stated above, if you have questions concerning the contest, feel free to reach out to them or another [[[https://05command.wikidot.com/community-outreach-main|Community Outreach team member]]]. The contest marshals will have the ability to disqualify entries for violations of the above-listed rules, egregiously poor sportsmanship not otherwise enumerated, or failure to fit the theme. All decisions are appealable to the contest marshals.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n^^Special thanks to [[*user syuzhet]] for the wonderful artwork created in preparation for this contest.^^\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"dragon\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp8000contesthub/1762.png title=\"HERE BE DRAGONS!\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** banner.png\n> **Name:** The Border Between Fantasy and Reality\n> **Author:** syuzhet\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[scp8000contesthub|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n> **Filename:** separator.png\n> **Name:** The Border Between The Top of This Page and The Bottom of This Page\n> **Author:** syuzhet\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[scp8000contesthub|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n> **Filename:** bg.png\n> **Author:** syuzhet\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[scp8000contesthub|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n\n> **Filename:** 1762.png\n> **Name:** Here be dragons!\n> **Author:** syuzhet\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[scp8000contesthub|SCP Wiki]]]\n\n> **Filename:** flowchart.png\n> **Name:** Editing Flowchart\n> **Author:** WhiteGuard\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[scp7000contesthub|SCP Wiki]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[!--\n\nAuthor's Note\n\n***\n\nHello, my name is Anonymous S.\n\nIt's nice to meet you.\n\nI'm a shut-in living in a forgotten place buried among geysers. It reeks of mold and the walls are devoured by mayflies and ants, but I'm okay with all of that. As long as I stay away from humans, I can live a peaceful life.\n\nThe banner art was inspired by my time in this place. Since everyone died 5000 years ago, I have seen many things happen. Things change, people come and go, everything moves so quickly -- it makes me a little sad. But that's okay, because I'm a statue that only moves when you're not looking.\n\nDid you hear we'll have 10,000 stories soon? It's kind of scary, isn't it? Some people even want to end it there, but I'm not sure that's possible. Looking back, you can see the doors bearing the marks of past eras being thrown mercilessly into the infinite future. In this way, I feel we are falling to the stars without a choice.\n\nAnyways, I hope to read more of your stories soon! When you run out of things to say, I'll go to sleep and dream until the end of time. But until then, let's have fun in this fantasy together.\n\nThank you for reading. ✌️\n\n--]",
