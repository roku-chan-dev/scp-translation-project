On the vertical line we see three leopard heads, fangs included. Depicting the concept of war on a shield was a little more difficult, but I finally settled on using two British soldiers. The supporters are taken from the former coat of arms of Northern Ireland, reflecting WarFang's origin.\n\n**How the prompt fits in:** The prompt Extinct does not refer to WarFang, fortunately. It refers to the supporter to the right. This is an Irish elk, a very large species of deer that went extinct in the late Pleistocene.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**<< [[[art:inkscapetober-day-23-leak| Day 23: Leak]]] | [[[art:sleepofreasons-inkscapetober-hub| Hub]]] |  [[[art:inkscapetober-day-25-splat| Day 25: Splat]]] >>**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=SleepOfReason]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** WarFang.png\n> **Name:** WarFang\n> **Author:** [[*user SleepOfReason]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** N/A (this page)\n----\nWarFang.png is a composite.
