Said research has found that these activities all appear to centre around a conflict between Aos Sí, Tuatha Dé Danann and a pre-Roman British civilization, believed to have occurred approximately 2000 years ago. Though little evidence of this conflict remains, its impact is believed to have shaped much of the Isles' history and culture. \n\nWith this likely stemming from several political parties, including known Groups of Interest, wishing to either continue or restart this conflict, one of the Project's main aims is to ensure that such activity does not spiral into nationwide, anomalous conflict. To do so, the primary focus of the Project is to understand the significance and goals of these conflicts, both past and present, as well as to try and uncover any lost data. \n\nIn part of this research, several Foundation items are currently scrutinised for possible connections to this historical impact.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"imm-email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"imm-email\"]]\n[[div class=\"imm-tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Dr. Tommy Ashton\n**From:** Prof. Otis Pattinson\n**Subject:** Project Caliburn - SCP-2307\n[[/div]]\n------\n**[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/anomaly-306-the-silver-alder|Juniper Archive - Anomaly 306.zip]]]**\n------\nTom,\n\nAs you may be aware, Site-46 has been selected to partake in a nationwide investigation, code-named Project Caliburn. As part of the project's numerous investigations, we are tasked with investigating all known artefacts and documents instrumental in the anomalous activity within the British Isle. This brings me to your newly assigned anomaly: SCP-2307.\n\nAs you know, SCP-2307 consists of two related anomalies, 01 and 02, both of which were discovered in the United Kingdom and likely have connections to its history. Currently, 02 is with Psionics and Humanoid Psychology, undergoing its own examination. It's 01 we would like you to focus on. Specifically, we would like you to conduct a full investigation into 01's nature. Its regenerative capabilities, its composition, and its distortion of written works. All of it.\n\nFor some background, you should consult the documents we obtained during //Her Majesty's Foundation// absorption into the modern Foundation, which we believe details some crucial elements in regards to 01. I have attached them to this email.\n\nI look forward to your response,\n\nProf. Otis Pattinson\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Testing. Testing.}}\n\n{{This is Doctor Tommy Ashton, Level 3 Mechanical and Materials Engineering for the Foundation's Engineering Division.}} \n\n{{I am documenting this dictation log-in regarding my investigation into SCP-2307. In the coming days, I hope to uncover a more detailed description of the workings of SCP-2307-01.}}\n\n{{I do not know what I am looking for specifically, though my superiors are eager for me to report back with any findings. I will begin my first assessments in due course.}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-1}}\n\n{{As requested, the item has been removed from its aquarium. I am to allow the item's capabilities to continue until the length of the blade reaches approximately 70cm. After that, I will maintain the item's new condition with the use of the aquarium.}}\n\n{{Upon first inspection, SCP-2307-01 is exactly as it is described in its file. It is a European long sword. Specifically, a hexagonal cross-sectioned blade long sword. Whilst I am no expert in medieval weaponry, I have been informed by the Department of History that such blades were popular within the Northern and Western European regions up until the 17th centuries. Their original creation date remains unknown.}}\n\n{{The hilt is around 50 cm in length, which is unusual for swords of this type. Its pommel, grip and crossguard are decorated in various Celtic knots and what I believe to be chains. When held, the - hang on - gloves -}}\n\n= //{{Sound of rubber snapping and metal clinking}}//\n\n{{When held, the length and the lack of any shagreen make it somewhat awkward to hold, though as it is not that heavy, handling it does not appear to be too difficult.}}\n\n{{As of this recording, the blade, which started at 40cm in length, has now extended to 42cm and is expected to grow further in the coming days. As expected, sections of rust that were present prior to my log have started to recede and the blade is lengthening at a rate of 15mm per day.}}\n\n{{Let's see - upon closer inspection, I can make out some iridescent patterns on the blade, starting from the rain-guard. At the moment, there is too much rust to make out any details, so I will report any further findings of these patterns in due course.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-2}}\n\n{{The blade has lengthened to approximately 44cm since the last log. The rust flakes have also continued to recede and flake. Now with around 20g, I hope to investigate the materials used to create 01. If it goes well, I hope to subject 01 to more in-depth analysis. Thinking spectroscopic analysis.}}\n\n{{Those iridescent spots. The patterns. I can make out more of them today. Looks like chemical milling, like the Italians would do to their armour with vinegar. This is very fine, however. If this was done with human hands, it's impressive craftsmanship. I don't recognise the symbols, so I've sent some pictures to History and Terra-Linguistics to see if they can understand anything.}}\n\n= //{{Sound of metal clinking}}//\n\n{{Even by today's standards, this is impeccable work.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-3}}\n\n{{Haven't had anything back about the symbols yet. History believes we're not looking at a single language here. More likely three or four. The X-ray's found more symbols, between the exterior and interior of the blade. There's probably more the further the regeneration goes, too. So whoever made this must have added the symbols as it was forged.}}\n\n{{What's more interesting is the lengthening. The blade's now 52cm, not the expected 46 to 47cm. It's accelerating its growth. Thought that was odd.}}\n\n{{I couldn't figure it out until I checked the camera footage. Turns out the rate of regeneration is infrequent. It's around 15 mm per day when unattended, but it accelerates when I'm around it. Yesterday, I was around it my entire work shift, and in that time, it grew an extra 4cm. That's 240 mm per day. That suggests that my presence somehow enhances 01's regeneration. What's special about me? Maybe it's not me, but something I have that meets its requirements. May need to run some different tests.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-4}}\n\n{{Should've done this yesterday, but those experiments took a while. The good news is that it isn't just me. Seems like 01 responds to any human presence. Just humans. Got nothing when I tried it with other animals. Less good news, it's not consistent. Different rates for different people. Went to 350mm per day when Charlotte held it, dropped down to 100mm with Billy, and then shot up to 500mm when Erica held it. If there is a pattern, I can't see it. They all did the same job. They were roughly the same age. It can't be sex or ethnicity. Maybe -  maybe it's something more personal.}}\n\n{{The blade's at 72 now. Reported it to Otis, though he seemed fine with that. Currently, it's back in the tank, and its regeneration has been paused. I should look into that. What's special about that water?}}\n\n{{I wonder - those memories the D-class experienced - with the skull crown. The woman - in the water -}}\n\n{{History still hasn't got back. That's not surprising though. Apparently, Project Caliburn has got them working their arses off.}} \n\n{{Got the chemical tests back, however.}} \n\n{{I should note that in the original file, we marked the blade as 3.2 billion BCE in age and the handle as 4th Century CE. That was right, but not entirely. You see, 01 isn't two components, Handle and blade. It's three. The blade is layered. It has an inner part and an outer. What's more, only the outer part is 3.2 billion. The inner is also about 4th Century CE.}}\n\n{{It also seems the sword isn't made from one material either. The outer layer appears to be made from a kind of steel, most likely a high-carbon, Crucible steel. That in itself is not unusual, as such steels have been around for millennia, but what is strange is the lack of inhomogeneities. The alloy is unusually devoid of impurities, suggesting it had been created using recent metallurgic methods, and given the blade's age, that's not possible.}}\n\n{{The inner layer is even more strange. According to the files Otis sent me, this compound is called Alderwood Iron, a steel which includes silver in its composition which requires alchemical methods to create. From what I have since researched about this metal, it was supposedly created by HMFSCP during the Sixth Occult War. However, just like the outer casing, the metal's creation date succeeds its supposed discovery.}}\n\n{{The thing I still can't understand is why. Why have two layers and use different alloys? Maybe it has to do with the symbols? Maybe this regeneration is somehow tied to this layering and choice of metals.}}\n\n{{Whoever made you - God, they're clever.}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-6 - sorry - 5}}\n\n{{History came back. They cracked it - or at least some of it. The reason it was so hard is that not all of it was letters. There are numbers too. And images. A mixture of letters, numbers, images and symbols.}} \n\n{{They know one of the languages is something called Ogham. An old Irish language from the medieval times. Apparently, the words translate to Welsh and Gaelic words, too, not just Irish. The other languages they don't know, but they think one may be a kind of Mycenaean Greek and Roman Latin mix. The numbers are Mycenaean however. This is somewhat of a discovery. Historically, those two cultures barely knew each other. Yet this sword - 01 - suggests some kind of contact was missed by the history books.}}\n\n{{They said the way it's presented is unusual. Some of it is sentences while others are more disjointed, like algorithms or mathematical formulas. And then sometimes, it just images and symbols. What's it for? Is it a message? A warning? Instructions?}}\n\n{{I've made no further development with the material analysis. That's the key to this, I think. They chose to make it like this. Why?}}\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A - uh - 6 - yeah - 6}}\n\n{{God. Lots to report this time.}}\n\n{{Firstly, new developments with the sword. I got Otis to extend the length restriction to 90cm. Wanted to test the regeneration again. See what's special. But then something happened in the tests.}}\n\n{{The sword's changing. The blade's lengthening but the handle's shrinking, changing to something smaller. Right now, the handle's at 20cm and the blade's at 75cm. It's easier to handle too, and it's starting to point. It's close to fully forming, I think.}}\n\n{{The change was brought on mostly when Kelly handled it. Regeneration went to 750mm per day when she touched it. She said she felt something too, when she held it. Claimed it felt welcoming or supportive, but also enticing, like it was goading her to do something. Had to stop after that. I was worried it was developing memetic properties on top of its record-altering abilities. We don't want that. That is until I got the results about the language from History, specifically the Department of Antiquity.}}\n\n{{They've translated some of the text in the swords. I was right - sort of. It's code. A programming language. But written in two different styles. One part, written in Latin and Greek, is like circuits, using words, numbers and symbols. Kind of like early Boolean logic gates. Furthermore, the way it's written is different too. Like the punctuation and grammar, if that's what it is, changes in place. Almost like two different people wrote it, in different styles. Apparently, one is more modern than the other, closer to our own style of writing. And a word keeps appearing in it. [[[church-of-the-broken-god-hub|Mekhane]]].}}\n\n{{Maybe those memories the D-Class had weren't as fantastical as we thought.}}\n\n{{The other part, written with Ogham and the unknown symbols. Well, they couldn't figure that out until they put them together on paper and read them out. A whole table suddenly blew to pieces, like something very heavy hit it very fast. They got Thaumaturgy to check them and they confirmed it. The symbols are sigils. Runes and glyphs.}}\n\n{{This things isn't just a weird sword. It's more than that. It's a machine. A machine programmed with some combined Mekhanite technology and ancient, probably British, metallurgy and thaumaturgy. A computer, utilising magic in its matrix.}}\n\n{{Weirdly, Otis doesn't seem baffled to hear this. In fact, it looks like he anticipated it. Claims he expected that to be the answer, based on what the D-Class experienced wearing 02 and what History is currently learning. He's pleased with what I've done. Wants me to look into this program the sword's using.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-7}}\n\n{{Been a while. Sorry.}}\n\n{{Haven't got very far since the last recording. Even with the translations, the programs are really difficult to understand. Trying to write it out. Understand how it all works together. That wasn't easy.}}\n\n{{The sword's at 90cm now. It's more recognisable now. Before, whilst it was a sword, it did seem a bit large. Too large for a person. Now, the proportions have shifted to something more usable. Maybe that's the point. Maybe it wants us to find it easy to use.}}\n\n{{I have cracked the water though. Turns out the water is giving off a specific frequency of Akiva Radiation. When submerged in it, the sword responds to the frequency. Seems to kind of go into standby mode or something. Whether it has to do with that lake creature or those priests - I don't know.}}\n\n{{What next? Marshall, Carter and Dark are auctioning off round tables?}}\n\n{{It's - it's ridiculous.}}\n\n{{He can't be real.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-8 - getting bored of saying that shit.}}\n\n{{Got it. Took a while but I think I'm close to the answer.}}\n\n{{Looks like 02 is going to be useful after all. Contacted Psionics and managed to run a few tests with 01 and 02 again. Just to see if something had changed. The record alerting hasn't and no new memories have surfaced using 02 but looks like the connection between 01 and 02 has. According to the D-Class, they can hear something in the background, like a voice. One came from the experiment claiming he heard someone talking, but not to him. In the background, whispering. Apparently, it's a woman's voice.}}\n\n{{When we looked at the footage with the Zohar data playing in parallel, we could see, 01 responds differently when 02 is involved. The flow of Akiva is more frequent and denser. Plus, more parts of 01 respond when 02 is involved. It's like the two things recognize each other and can communicate. Maybe that's why the memories come. Could 01 actually be holding more than just incantations? Maybe it's holding data?}}\n\n{{I'm close to something. I know. I just - }}\n\n{{Wonder if Psionics can lend me a psiophone?}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-9}}\n\n{{Not sure if this is going to work.}}\n\n{{OK, so going into uncharted waters here, but we're always learning here. Never thought I'd be dealing with magic and psychics when I graduated, however.}}\n\n{{So according to Thaumaturgy, 02 has a property which works with telepathic signals. They think that's how it can suppress all those amnestics and cognitohazards. Apparently, they think it's got more under-discovered properties. And then - Sorry, I digress.}}\n\n{{My theory is this: When 02 is involved, 01 projects telepathic signals into the wearer's mind. While doing this, more of 01's code becomes active, with the circuits and sigils changing and broadening. This brings me to the test.}}\n\n{{What I've done is hooked up 02 to one of Psionic's psiophones, and connected 01 to a simple thaumic circuit, complete with Zohar counter. I've also got Spell# open on the SCiPNet, where I've rigged up a few programs connected to the History's database. My idea is this. If I create an electronic transmission between 02 and 01, I can then translate what the sigils and circuits in 01 are saying to 02, allowing us to better understand where 01 keeps its data, if it even does.}}\n\n{{It's convoluted - I know - but it's the best I can do. Never worked with this stuff before.}}\n\n{{Right - psio's at 34 Hertz, Spell#'s got all the translations ready, the Zohar's registering a constant rate of 20.2 Stingers. OK - let's try this.}}\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/arthcymro/sword_glitch.mp3]]\n\n{{Fucking hell!}}\n\n{{Shit!}}\n\n{{God, that's loud!}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n{{Experiment Log 2307 A-10}}\n\n{{Fuck.}}\n\n{{OK, OK, OK. Last experiment went - well, you heard. Fried the circuits of my laptop. So, new plan.}}\n\n{{So it looks like 01 and 02 don't work with electrical inputs. It needs a person. A real telepathic connection. So this time, I'm gonna be the subject of 02, whilst being hooked to the psiophone. I know I should be using a D-Class, but in this case, I think we need someone with a bit more of an analytical mind.}}\n\n{{I've still got the circuit and counter scanning 01, except this time, the computer is just providing the translations. If I've done this right - which I probably haven't - both the outputs of the counter and psiophone should be uploaded into Spell#, which in turn, can translate the outputs based on what History and Psionics have given me.}}\n\n{{If this works, I'll attach the data to this audio file.}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"terminal\"]]\n[[div class=\"scanline\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"text\"]]\n| last login: fri july 09 17:02:23\n| username:~ drtomton:\n\n> ###80ff80|**drtomton:** Hello?##\n\n...\n\n> ###80ff80|**drtomton:** My name is Doctor Tommy Ashton.

According to Medical, he has experienced deep psionic and thaumic shock, which his body and consciousness were not prepared for. His condition is recoverable, though intense psycho and physiotherapy will be needed. Whilst recovering SCP-2307-02 from the mess, Psionics noted that the psiophone had remained connected to Thomas even after the power surge. As such, numerous images have been recovered, which we believe are pieces of data, buried within SCP-2307-01. We've uploaded them to the 2307 file and you should get an alert for them following this email.\n\nSecondly, since the incident on the 12th, SCP-2307-01 has received moderate damage, with most of the blade shattered. It still retains its record-altering and regeneration capabilities, thought slightly impaired. 01 also appears to have undergone some additional changes since Ashton's experiment. It appears 01 will now alter its design depending on who's holding it, as Ashton noticed in his tests. Also, it no longer alters records into a more positive reflection of the owner. It's now changing names, backgrounds, and histories. Some of them talk of great battles or political engagements. One record we've found is identical to an extract from the Book of Pieces. It is as if 01 is trying to tell us something. These altered records are currently with History, to see if they support what Ashton uncovered during his tests.\n\nBy the way, since the experiment, History and Terra-Linguistics have managed to translate some more of the text within 2307-01. Most are names or groups which we are currently researching. According to our texts, //kobaloi// is the name Greeks gave to the sprites of Dionysus. Whilst this doesn't seem like much, the name had another meaning to the Mycenaeans, specifically the Followers of Mekhane. In their tales, they speak of a monstrous enemy who'd hunt them during their days hiding within the Roman Empire. An enemy whose flesh blistered at the touch of metal, led by a powerful leader of the name, //χλωμήκία//, or //Chlomikia//, meaning the pale malice.  \n\nThis was one of words Ashton couldn't translate. Furthermore, this name appears to have been referenced in other cultures too. In the mythical tales of the Tuatha Dé Danann, they mention an powerful sorcerer and ruler of the Aos Sí, under the name Gwynn, meaning white and pale. Whilst this doesn't sound like anything beyond just old wives tales, the name Gwynn seems to still be popular among the Aos Sí  individuals of Three Portland. Records differ between age brackets but generally, this individual appears to be regarded highly in Aos Sí culture. \n\nIt is for this reason, I would suggest External Affairs start investigating this immediately. Whilst this could be nothing, if said individual is still around, I do not like the image they are being painted in, nor do I like the apparent connection they have to our current problems.\n\nI look forward to your response,\n\nHelga\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n{{###246bce|> ACCESS FILES: SCP-2307##}}\n\n[[div class=\"transcript\"]]\n[[=]]\n{{###246bce|THE FILE YOU HAVE REQUESTED IS UNDER ALTERATION.

Secondary and tertiary tanks are to be kept to store SCP-2307-01 during primary tank maintenance.\n\nSCP-2307-02 is to be kept in a climate-controlled case meant to preserve skeletal structures and is to be cleaned and inspected for damage immediately after each test conducted with it. Use of SCP-2307-02 with other memory- or record-affecting SCPs is permitted with approval from O5-2.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2307-01 is the remains of a long sword, with a 56 cm hilt and a partial blade approximately 40cm in length, estimated to be approximately 43% of its original size. Carbon dating has shown that the hilt and cross guard of the sword date to approximately the 4th Century CE; however, the metal used in the blade dates to approximately 3.2 Billion BCE. SCP-2307-01 is in a severe state of disrepair as a result of being submerged in water for at least 1300 years.\n\nSCP-2307-01's primary anomaly manifests when\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n{{###246bce|> JUMP TO LATEST ADDITIONS##}}\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-97-P:\n\nA robed man with a crown of antlers and iron was standing next to a silver tree. At his feet was an enormous wolf, dead. As he knelt he picked up a cub, also dead. Bringing it to his lips, he kissed the cub's head and whispered something. Something in Welsh. And suddenly, the cub came back, barking, sporting red eyes and ears.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-98-P:\n\nA great machine emerged from the sea. As it rose, oil and pieces fell into the water, turning much of it black or red. Pieces of what seemed like flesh were floating in the water around it, still squirming and bleeding. The machine then rose, looked up into the star sky and howled. A scream like the clanking of engines and the buzz of electricity. Then it collapsed and broke apart.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-99-P:\n\nIn a clearing, filled with flowers, a crowd stood, encircling two figures. The man wore a band of gold on his head. The woman, a wreath of meadowsweet. As they held hands, they spoke in unison. They pledged faithfulness, love and support for one another and vowed to bring Celliwig and its allies to a harmonious state. Now man and wife, the two kissed, and the crowd cheered as they did.\n\nThe crowd was very diverse, but not just ethnically. Some had skin like bronze or brass. Some had skin raw and red, bones sticking out. One or two had long red hair, with pointed ears. There were huge men, three times the size of ordinary folks, and one was a werewolf or something.\n\nAs everyone celebrated, the husband kissed his wife and made his way to a group of blue-skinned women with webbed hands. Alone, the wife was approached by another man, with black hair and a moustache. He was handsome. Very. He sat with the woman and the two smiled, talking for a bit. But as the man made to touch the woman's cheek, a woman came forward, wearing a horse skull on her head. She was not happy. At the sight of her glare, the man bowed and walked off, leaving the two women scowling at each other. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-100-P:\n\nThere was a large room, underground. A forge of sorts, but there were scrolls, cauldrons and flora too. In the room's centre were these people. Men and women wearing black hooded robes and fur, all wearing animal skulls, surrounded a golden fire in a stone hearth on the floor. One of them, a woman with a mechanical hand, was wearing the horse skull. Suddenly, the fire grew bigger, and it turned green, with one of the robed people, a man in a deer skull, stepping forward, saying something. It wasn't one language. More like, it was loads of words from multiple languages.  \n\nThen, from a hole in the ceiling, lightning shot down and the fire went out. And in the pit, among the coal and wood, was the sword. The man, possibly the leader, walked forward and held it out. For a second, something flashed across the blade. Like a shimmer or a glow of shapes. He said a word.\n\n\"Caledfwlch.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-101-P:\n\nThere was screaming. A cry of rage and sorrow. There was fighting. All around there was the sound of metal clashing, fires burning and people screaming and weeping. All while the rain came down. A man, wearing a gold band crown on top of long brown hair, stood stooped, holding a sword in one hand and his bleeding gash in the other. At his feet was a body. A dying man, no older than 20. He tried to say something but the crowned man just pushed his sword into his chest, killing him.\n\nThen, simply appearing from the rain, another man came out. He wasn't human, at least, not completely. He had great wings that shimmered like pearls and wore delicate fabric, gold jewels and had a horned headpiece on top of platinum white hair. When he saw the crowned man, he laughed, saying he was impressed for going so far as to kill his child. The crowned man screamed and they began fighting.\n\nIt felt like days, but also seconds, and the two kept going at it. The crowned one slashed his sword. The winged one cursed and flew about. But the crowned one was losing. He was bleeding out. Getting tired. The winged one mocked him. For losing his knights, for his wife's faithlessness and his friend's betrayal.  \n\nBut the crowned man smiled and raised his sword skywards. The winged one sneered, calling him pathetic. Saying humanity would pay for the defilement of the world. And lunged forward, his arms raised. But then the rain stopped and from the heavens came a word, made by a voice that sounded like thunderclaps. \"Smite\". Then there was lightning, shooting down towards the two. Blinding everything.\n\nWhen the light vanished, the two stood together, almost in an embrace. The crowned man was cut all over, bleeding and hunched, but smiling. The winged one had his mouth open in a silent scream. The sword, which glowed with runes and numbers, was running through his belly, drenched in blood and rain. At the end, was a blue stone, which glowed slightly before crumbling into dust.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-102-P:\n\nIt was a factory. Something was covered in oily tarpaulin, with smoke and steam seeping from the edges. Two men came in, dressed like Victorians. One of them had these bronze gauntlets that had all these dials and switches. The other was exactly like the crowned man before. As they spoke, they said something about a plan, mentioning lay lines, someone called Father Loom and tunnels. The crowned man then pulled out a sword, the same sword from before, and walked in front of the tarpaulin. He then said something, something in French, and pointed the sword towards the tarpaulin. And then the whole thing blew off, revealing a large, bronze steam locomotive, blowing steam and sounding a shrill whistle. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-103-P:\n\nThere was a large pool. A lake. In the water there were two people, a man and a woman, both wearing animal skulls on their heads. The woman stood but the man was kneeling down in the water, hands submerged. He was murmuring something.\n\nSuddenly, the water made this loud sound. Like a thunderclap. The man gasped and fell back. The woman ran to him and held him, comforting him as he shook and cried. You saw their hands. His was all scarred, covered in red shapes. One of hers was all metal, like a gauntlet going all the way up to her shoulder. As he cried, he kept saying the same thing over and over again.\n\n\"Behemoths.\"\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-104-P:\n\nAt the end of a cliff, facing the ocean. The sky was odd. A dark purple filled with black clouds, which thundered and shot lightning. No sun, moon or stars were in it. And now and again, there was this rumbling noise and the sky filled with this golden aurora. \n\nOut in the ocean, entities thrashed about. A metallic goliath and some beast things, all fur, scales, bone and horns. They were fighting, but it seemed both the goliath and the reptile thing were actually united against another thing. Another monster. A humanoid with tentacles, claws and five eyes. Suddenly, the monster vomited and several smaller creatures, eel-like and frilled, emerged from the sick.\n\nSuddenly, someone was at the edge of the cliff. A young girl, about 16, dressed in black muslin and fine jewels. She had antlers growing from her head, and furred ears, and instead of feet, she had hooves, with furred legs and a tail, like a deer. She was crying. Crying and crying. And when the tears fell to the ground, daisies bloomed from the grass.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n\nStatement 2307-105-P:\n\nIn a clearing, there was a circle of stones. In the middle was the largest stone, with a sword, set into the rock. From the brushes nearby, a man emerged, dressed in furs and a deer skull headpiece. His body was covered in tattoos. Some blue and Celtic in design. Others seemed more like cuts, like the ones you'd see Sarkics have. As he got closer to the sword, he reached out a hand and touched it. He murmured something, in a voice that sounded strange. Made your mind feel all fuzzy and your body limp. He then walked away but before he left, he turned. And looked straight at you.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n{{###246bce|> RETURN TO STATMENT STATEMENT 2307-104-P: PARAGRAPH 3##}}\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\nSuddenly, someone was at the edge of the cliff.
