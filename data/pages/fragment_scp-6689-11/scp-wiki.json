The construct of SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛 was discovered to engage in predatory behaviour: identifying distinct relational frameworks and incorporating them into its meta-construct. Notably, the majority of these frameworks were previously suppressed from human conceptualization through the implementation of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6699 GOTTFRIED PROTOCOL: DRAWN VEIL.]\n\nWhile this behaviour was initially unexplained, developments in the Foundation's understanding of and ability to monitor the noosphere -- emerging from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6659 PROJECT DEICIDIUM and PROJECT PROMETHEUM] -- provided an explanatory framework. Current hypothesizing identifies SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛 as an active, responsive, meta-construct: similar to previously identified deific entities. While SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛's ability to influence physical reality is undetermined, it presented an immediate, aggressive threat to normalcy prior to its containment.\n\nThe failure of SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛 to successfully alter consensus understanding of anomalous phenomena is attributed to the actions of SCP-游랚游랚游랚游랚, a hitherto inadequately understood meta-construct that acts in opposition to SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛.\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\nSCP-游랚游랚游랚游랚's meta-construct displays strong relations to the following ideatic complexes:\n* Adherence to and perpetuation of a framework for unified 'normal' existence;\n* The isolation of atypical phenomena, both through physical confinement and suppression of general knowledge;\n* Operations within secretive parameters to achieve the aforementioned goals;\n* Hierarchical, occulted, organizational structures -- with corresponding numerological significance.\n\nDue to these properties, the application of SCP-游랚游랚游랚游랚 for the containment of noospheric entities has been considered, but determined redundant.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##ad962a|{{ALERT: SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛 CONTAINMENT UPDATE:}}##\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##ad962a|{{//\"This thing is the strong fortitude of all strength, / for it overcometh every subtle thing and doth penetrate every solid substance. / Thus was this world created. / Hence will there be marvellous adaptations achieved, of which the manner is this.\"//}}##[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] Vulgate translation of the //Emerald Tablet//, attributed to Hermes Trismegistus.[[/span]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##ad962a|{{Showing Alert:}}##\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"jotting\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ##red|FAILURE: SCP-游랛游랛游랛游랛 CONTAINMENT CONSTRUCT##\n-----\n++ OVERVIEW:\n[[/=]]\n> -----\n> **{{GOTTFRIED PROTOCOLS:}}**\n> * __{{CAMERA OBSCURA}}__ -- ##red|INACTIVE##\n> * __{{DRAWN VEIL}}__ -- ##red|INACTIVE##\n> * __{{BLINDFOLD}}__ -- ##red|INACTIVE##\n> * __{{WARREN EYE}}__ -- ##red|INACTIVE##\n> -----\n> **{{BLACK MOON 游랱|游랰 GOLDEN SUN:}}** ##ad962a|STANDBY##\n> * __{{SCP-游랚游랚游랚游랚}}__ -- ##green|ACTIVE##\n> * __{{O5 APPROVAL}}__ -- ##ad962a|PENDING:## CANDIDATES IDENTIFED -- INITIATION UNDERWAY\n\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++ ##ad962a|__MEMO FROM THE DEPT.

Thus far, the representatives of the Dept. of Transmutation have upheld our mandate to resolve the oppositional forces of the human and not-human, normality and the anomalous, to maintain equilibrium.\n\nFire, Air, Water, and Earth have been carefully balanced through the interplay of conceptual sympathies to provide an enduring framework. We, intentionally occulted from the understanding of others, have watched as this stability teeters, spinning inevitably toward dissolution. Our methods are insufficient to continue in this manner, and perhaps this is for the best.\n\nBefore us stands an uncertain future, where the conflict between these forces will reach a precipice. Either we will embrace this concept as the means to a new world, or we will embrace the turbulent chaos of a disordered universe.\n\nHowever, the choice is not ours alone to make. The introduction of new elements is essential to this upcoming resolution. As such, The current Dept. of Transmutation is hereby dissolved, and the initiation of new personnel is considered our final responsibility. Upon those hands will fall the decision for the future.\n\n- Written by the body that, hitherto, maintained the balance of the four elements in circular unity, through the application of the fifth, aether: ##ad962a|**The O5 Council.**##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]",
