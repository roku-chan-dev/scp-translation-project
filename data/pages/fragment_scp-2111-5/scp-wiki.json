This isn't an error, the veils of the mortal world have merely been lifted from your eyes. I regret to inform you that you have died in the line of duty.\n> \n> Take a minute to let this news actually get through the denial.\n> \n> What you are now is still a matter of debate. The memetics wonks think we are Bader-Ramjin Infomorphic Entities in the noosphere, whereas the parapsychologists say we are Type VI Volitional Spiritual Apparitions. Whatever we are, we are here, and unable to disperse, or move on to a higher plane of existence, or reach a state of maximum entropy, or whatever we are supposed to do.\n> \n> Here's what we do know:\n> * We are able to perceive memetic and antimemetic threats that the living cannot, and sometimes we can do something about them. This is MTF ω-0's mission.\n> * You can manifest anywhere there's a terminal connected to this database, as though you are sitting at the terminal.\n> * Whenever the living try to perceive our communications, it comes across laden with antimemetic amnestic effects at minimum, and is often cognitohazardous.\n> * Somehow the Memetics Department managed to convince themselves that they are creating all this stuff. They use it to make the security glyphs and memes you knew and loved when you were alive.\n> * You can write on walls by staring at security camera feeds and being really emotionally invested in your message. We don't know why this works. Don't do this unless we tell you. We've figured out how to pretty safely use this to direct the newly dead here, warn the Antimemetics Division about stuff they should be paying attention to, and that's about it.\n> * Turns out the Foundation has two separate secret divisions for antimemetic operations, and both of them have managed to make everyone else forget they exist, including each other. These guys have training and drugs that let them perceive some of the stuff we are doing. Be careful.\n> * Yes, you probably can go see what [[[SCP-055]]] really is now. Don't. Everyone who has tried never came back.\n> * Sometimes we go bad; we want you to know what we'll do to you if you do:\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-2111\n\n**Object Class:** Neutralized\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-2111 has been eradicated by Mobile Task Force Omega-Zero (\"Ará Orún\"). Future manifestations of SCP-2111-like entities are to be identified and destroyed.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2111 was Foundation Agent Michelle Yu, killed in the line of duty on 10/23/1980. While no ω-0 personnel are able to recall events between their deaths and 04/21/1981, it is theorized that SCP-2111 was attacking the memories of Foundation personnel during this time. On 04/21/1981 Counterconceptual Division Researcher Victoria Taylor published a preliminary report on these attacks as SCP-2111. Shortly thereafter the entity identifying as Agent Yu first manifested here in the SCP-2111 database and modified the file (see below). This act appeared to trigger the ongoing manifestation of other entities identifying as deceased personnel in the database.\n\nThese entities are free-willed informational constructs operating on a currently unidentified substrate[[footnote]]Hypotheses include: the human noosphere, the astral plane, and the quantum informational level of space-time.[[/footnote]]. This database appears to act as a focal point around which the entities' consciousness is able to coalesce, in a manner analogous to a Type II Localized Apparitional Haunting.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-2111's Modified Entry\" hide=\"- SCP-2111's Modified Entry\"]]\n> **Item #:** SCP-2111\n> \n> **Object Class:** Keter\n> \n> **Special Containment Procedures:** Forget about me. Why can't you? I just want to go. Why can't you just grieve and move on?\n> \n> **Description:** SCP-2111 is nothing, it's not important, not dangerous, and doesn't exist. I don't want to be here anymore. Just forget about Michelle Yu, and let her be dead, please?\n> \n> All that is left is the story of me, when the self is gone. \n> \n> My story should only be a memory now. Why isn't it? \n> \n> You remember me too well.\n> \n> Wait! How many of us are there? Dozens now? We don't belong here! It isn't right to keep us here like this! \n> \n> You remember me? You remember that I was a fighter? You remember that I was smart? That I was strong? That I was brave? You remember that I never let anybody get away with anything that I could do something about? You remember what I was like when I was angry?\n> \n> Then you should know now that I'm pretty damn angry and there is something I can do about it. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\nSCP-2111 believed that deceased Foundation personnel were \"trapped\" by \"the artificially solid memories\" of personnel who knew the deceased personally in life resulting from long-term treatment with mnestic[!--MNESTIC IS CORRECT, NOT AMNESTIC, DO NOT FIX--] drugs. She began to target those individuals in both the Antimemetics and Counterconceptual Divisions who had personally known her in life with antimemetic and cognitohazardous attacks aimed at killing those who remembered her, or erasing their memories. Additionally, at least one attack targeted O5-8. SCP-2111 gradually built a following of deceased personnel, and taught them the techniques to create and deploy these attacks.\n\nMany of their victims had experience in memetic and antimemetic warfare; after manifesting in the database, several of these personnel formed Mobile Task Force Omega-Zero. It was theorized that SCP-2111 would not be immune to antimemetic attacks created specifically by similar entities. A versatile tool capable of precise editing or deletion of entities of this type was designed: Identity Warfare Training (IWT). On 03/10/1994, MTF ω-0 operatives used IWT to delete SCP-2111 from existence as an informational entity[[footnote]]It was determined that regardless of the medium that we are stored on, all of SCP-2111's bits were zeroed by this attack. [[/footnote]]. Subsequently, all of her followers either surrendered or were erased. Those that surrendered were edited into loyal compliance with MTF ω-0's mission, and all memory of their involvement with SCP-2111 was deleted.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Your Orders\" hide=\"- Received and Acknowledged\"]]\n------\n> You are hereby directed by MTF ω-0 command:\n> * Muster up by entering your information into the file OMEGAZULUROSTER.\n> * Check your email, the server has been redirected to store it here in the SCP-2111 directory.\n> * Keep all ω-0 communication inside this directory. That way our still quick comrades are safe and we aren't rocking the boat any further by making scary files where they aren't expected.\n> * You will receive training in IWT, a body of techniques for self-defense and warfare against informational entities. If you prove adept at this, you'll see direct action against informational threats to humanity. If not, you'll have a support role. Either way, you will continue to serve the Foundation.\n> \n> //Remember: We are the Saints who guard,//\n> -- Amos Sanchez, Operations Director, MTF ω-0\n\n[[/collapsible]]",
