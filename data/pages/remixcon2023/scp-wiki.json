But did you know there have been various re-imaginings of these popular articles for the modern wiki? It's true! Take for example; [[[omega-k-049|SCP-049-Î©K]]], [[[SCP-1465]]], and [[[SCP-7579]]], all of which take these old articles and breathe new life into them, remixing in the spirit of the wiki's license (CC BY SA 3.0) and bringing to them an appreciation for a new audience.\n\nThat's what this contest is all about; remixing old SCP articles! Have you read an old SCP that you like that is just so close to being great but misses the mark? Or perhaps you have an old favorite that you want to pay tribute to? This is your opportunity to bust out your sandbox and write up a remix/reimagining of said article! Whether this means bringing your selected SCP into a new canon or simply looking at it through the eyes of a Group of Interest, any interpretations are valid here!\n\n+ But wait, there's more! \n\nSimilar to Halloweencon 2022, **this is also an Art contest!** Just as we are asking authors to remix old articles, we ask the same of you, artists, to remix an older SCP in a new light. That's right, if you ever imagined SCP-049 as a space marine medic, SCP-105 as a flapper gal, or SCP-079 as an old Nokia phone, now is your time to make it happen!\n\nAnd by the way, **you're allowed to enter both at the same time!**\n\n\n+ CONGRATULATIONS TO THE WINNERS:\n\n*  [[*user Long Arm Larry]] with [[[SCP-7918]]] at 184!\n*  [[*user Harmacy]] with [[[critter-profile-cack-dealer|Critter Profile: CACK Dealer!]]] at 62!\n*  [[*user LOVEMARGINAL]] with [[[she-s-worth-it-i-promise|she's worth it, i promise]]] at 96!\n*  [[*user Raddagher]] with [[[art:hand-drawn-cassy|She is completely sentient and]]] at 135!\n*  [[*user Anky Swallow]] with [[[/secure-facility-dossier-site-387|Secure Facility Dossier: Site-387]]] at 110!\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Click here to see the entries in order of placing +\" hide=\"- Click here to minimize -\"]]\n+ PLACEMENTS\n\n+++ SCP Category Ranked By Votes\n\n# [[[SCP-7918]]]\n# [[[SCP-7599]]]\n# [[[SCP-7838]]]\n# [[[SCP-7409]]]\n# [[[SCP-7342]]]\n# [[[SCP-7565]]]\n# [[[SCP-7715]]]\n# [[[SCP-7941]]]\n# [[[SCP-7796]]]\n# [[[SCP-7165]]]\n# [[[SCP-6317]]]\n# [[[SCP-7912]]]\n# [[[SCP-7293]]]\n# [[[SCP-7427]]]\n# [[[SCP-7614]]]\n# [[[SCP-7947]]]\n# [[[SCP-7625]]]\n# [[[SCP-7354]]]\n# [[[SCP-7346]]]\n# [[[SCP-7662]]]\n# [[[SCP-7522]]]\n# [[[SCP-7718]]]\n# [[[SCP-7640]]]\n# [[[SCP-7652]]]\n# [[[SCP-7439]]]\n# [[[SCP-7623]]]\n# [[[SCP-7334]]]\n# [[[SCP-7584]]]\n# [[[SCP-7657]]]\n# [[[SCP-7489]]]\n# [[[SCP-7462]]]\n# [[[SCP-2140-EX]]]\n# [[[SCP-7357]]]\n# [[[SCP-7663]]]\n# [[[SCP-7049]]]\n# [[[SCP-7451]]]\n# [[[SCP-7671]]]\n# [[[SCP-7612|SCP-7612, which used to be the Earth]]]\n# [[[SCP-7661]]]\n# [[[SCP-7379]]]\n# [[[SCP-7814]]]\n# [[[SCP-7196]]]\n# [[[SCP-7341]]]\n# [[[SCP-7453]]]\n# [[[SCP-7884]]]\n# [[[SCP-8499]]]\n# [[[SCP-7658]]]\n# [[[SCP-7719]]]\n# [[[SCP-7512]]]\n# [[[SCP-7665]]]\n# [[[SCP-7411]]]\n# [[[SCP-7189]]]\n# [[[SCP-7651]]]\n# [[[SCP-7318]]]\n# [[[SCP-7347]]]\n# [[[SCP-7244]]]\n# [[[SCP-2798-J]]]\n\n+++ GoI Format Category Ranked By Votes\n\n# [[[critter-profile-cack-dealer|Critter Profile: CACK Dealer!]]]\n# [[[spc-6985|SPC-6985: THE ANTI-SHARK]]]\n# [[[Sand and Bag]]]\n# [[[red-pool-superfund-site|UIU File: 2021-354 (OPERATION: SUPERFUND)]]]\t\n# [[[erics-mega-zine-vol-49-an-intermission-to-keep-you-hanging|ERICS MEGA ZINE VOL 49: AN INTERMISSION TO KEEP YOU HANGING]]]\n# [[[excerpt-of-the-naelkaen-bestiary-the-vasasoonenueta|Excerpt of The NÃ¤lkÃ¤n Bestiary: The VasasoonenÃ¼tÃ¤]]]\t\n# [[[Grabnok The Destroyer]]]\n# [[[project-proposal-2017-005-a-self-keeping-secret-a-removal-of|Project Proposal 2017-055 \"A Self Keeping Masterpiece\"]]]\n\n+++ Tale Category Ranked By Votes\n\n# [[[she-s-worth-it-i-promise|she's worth it, i promise]]]\n# [[[Creaking at the Seams]]]\n# [[[illcovetyouifyoucoverme|COâ–ˆVEâ–ˆTâ–ˆâ–ˆâ–ˆ]]]\n# [[[A Matter Of Perception]]]\n# [[[frollicles|Frollicles (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Baba Yaga)]]]\n# [[[So we sang the chorus from Atlanta to the sea]]]\n# [[[Because]]]\n# [[[you-await-my-return|This Dark Night Separates Us]]]\n# [[[Diary of an Adolescent Orange Blob]]]\n# [[[A Promise To Live For]]]\n# [[[exactly-what-happened|Exactly What Happened to Interdimensional SCP Death Battle Arena-13]]]\n# [[[Memories of the Abyss]]]\n# [[[Voice of Rage and Ruin]]]\n# [[[Caso PURE]]]\n# [[[Gearmen]]]\n# [[[The Conspiracy to Murder]]]\n# [[[Clunk]]]\n# [[[goodbye-gregor|Goodbye, Gregor]]]\n# [[[i-forgor|I forgor ðŸ’€]]]\n\n\n+++ Art Category Ranked By Votes\n\n# [[[art:hand-drawn-cassy|She is completely sentient and]]]\n# [[[There Be Dragons In My Backyard]]]\n# [[[art:049-but-logos|049 But Logos]]]\n# [[[art:c2hlaxnozxjl|This is no coincidence, but there's nothing you can do]]]\n# [[[art:for-honor-paragon|For Honor Paragon]]]\n# [[[art:speak-of-me|SPEAK OF ME]]]\n# [[[art:sentient-supervillain-stop-sign|Sentient Supervillain Stop-Sign]]]\n# [[[art:iron-icarus|The Iron Icarus]]]\n# [[[art:our-wretched-lookout-179-remixcon|Our Wretched Lookout (179 Remixcon)]]]\n# [[[art:murphy-law-in-a-storyboarded-stageplay|Murphy Law in...
