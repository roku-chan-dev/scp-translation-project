Due to the high amounts of classified information within, Foundation personnel with clearance level [[[SCP-6500|6500-5]]] or higher who are exposed to SCP-8650 are to be subject to immediate administration of Class-A amnestics. MTF Lambda-11 is to observe all personnel involved in the discovery of SCP-8650 and their respective Sites for connections to Splinter Group 6500-1.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8650 refers to a two-part film, with a total combined runtime of 7:18:03, produced by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media. Branding for the film, titled //SCP: Inevitable//, indicates that it is part of the \"SCP Cinematic Universe\" or \"SCPCU\"; the Foundation has no record of this brand's existence.\n\nBroadly speaking, SCP-8650 recounts the events surrounding the neutralization of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6500 SCP-6500] by a combination of Foundation personnel operating on an international, and interdimensional, scale. Past VKTM productions have recruited actual Foundation personnel, or used simulacrum of said personnel, for use in their anomalies. However, several prominent actors and voice performers were cast in the film, and are listed in the end credits.\n\nWith the exception of Ben Schwartz and Benedict Cumberbatch, who were both hired to read several lines of dialog for their respective roles without any context, --and Steven Seagal, who claimed to remember being cast for the film in late 2021--[[footnote]]Seagal's testimony was found to be unreliable; under the influence of a truth serum, he confessed that he had had no interaction with the Foundation or any groups of interest since the early 1990s, during the 'Unholywood' incident.[[/footnote]] no actors who were credited in SCP-8650 recall being involved with its production.\n\n**Addendum 1: Discovery**\n\nSCP-8650 was discovered after several members of Foundation personnel -- Dr. Udo Okorie, Chief Delfina Ibanez, Dr. Katherine Sinclair, Dr. Montgomery Reynolds, Dr. Daniel Asheworth, Dr. Placeholder McDoctorate, and Dr. William Wallace Wettle -- were abducted from their respective Sites for a seven-hour duration on the night of April 26th, 2024. \n\nAll Foundation personnel were found back in their respective living quarters at approximately 3:20 PM EST on April 27th, 2024, all claiming to have no memory of what happened while they were abducted. Dr. Sinclair, Dr. Okorie, and Dr. Asheworth all independently surrendered DVD copies of SCP-8650 that they had been given by a VKTM representative; attempted acroamatic abatement of the items has resulted in equipment failure, and digital copies were found uploaded to the Foundation's servers, in a file marked 'DOOMSDAY :)'. \n\nAttached is an abridged log of recordings taken from monitoring equipment on Chief Ibanez and Dr. Asheworth's person. \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Begin Log**\n\n//Chief Ibanez is walking through Site-43's corridors alongside Dr. Okorie.

That's good, I think? Less of a chance they focus on you. I just hope this doesn't turn into [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8889 Season Two]...\n\n//A third door opens.

Sorry to draw you away from any pertinent medical emergencies, luxury galas, or ice cream dates.\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** It wasn't-- the hell do you want, you extradimensional executive?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Ooh, alliterative, I like that. Can we use that in the sequel?\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** //Sequel?//\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Ah, you aren't aware, then. I don't blame you, wouldn't do numbers in your world. Long story short? We here at Vikander-Kneed have decided to break into the long-standing reality that is the film business, and create our very-own cross-media franchise-- the SCP Cinematic Universe! SCPCU for short.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Okay, so, I get why you dragged //me// into it. Expect it to happen every day before lunch at this point. But why everyone else?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Well, we need a test audience for our newest film, and who better than the people the film is based on?\n\n//Silence on the recording, and sounds of confusion. After about ten seconds, Sinclair swears loudly.//\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** You made a //film// based on 6500?!\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Well, no, that would be crude and insensitive to those who died during the Impasse. We made a film based on your attempts to stop it! It's got an extremely star-studded cast.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Hold on, we didn't sign any kind of--\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Someone needs to read their Goldbaker-Reinz plans more carefully.

Starting a film franchise with a massive team-up movie--\n\n**MacPhaerson:** You think this is the //first// film? This is the culmination of over twelve years of work on our part! You should //see// what Bonnie Wright did as ██████ █████ in //Black Autumn IV//. Brings a tear to my eye.\n\n**Dr. Reynolds:** As //who?//\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Oh, long story. You got bottomless buckets of popcorn on one side, bottomless drinks on your right, and there are restrooms at the back of the auditorium. Buckle up, buttercups. This is going to be a great show. Any questions before we start the screening?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** ...Please tell me that Whedon didn't direct this.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** What do we look like, Vought? We have some integrity, Daniel. We got James Gunn to fire off on this project-- pun fully intended.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** How long is this?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Just over seven hours. It's a two-part film!\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm not doing this. As far as I'm concerned, Mari, you and everyone involved in this can go and--\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** Bill. C'mon. We need to see what this says about... you know. That whole thing in the Mediterranean? \n\n**Dr. Wettle:** ...Fine. You hear from Cat lately?\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** She's got a lead on something in the Darien Gap along with Wexley. Talk about it later.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Excellent! Well, let's start the screening. We'll have a Q&A session a bit later.\n\n**Dr. Reynolds:** You do realize we're going to give this the full Gizmonic treatment, right?\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** I'm sorry, Gizmonic?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** I wouldn't have it any other way. We even wrote a theme song for it just in case you went that route, but Fionn[[footnote]] Fionn Sharke Esq. VP of Vikander-Kneed's LEGAL Department. [[/footnote]] told us not to play it. That's for the comments section.\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** Comments section?\n \n//MacPhaerson sinks back into the stage. She turns towards Chief Ibanez's recording equipment as blood spurts out of the left side of her bandage, as if winking.

It was a long day, and between me losing Udo, facing off against that... //thing// and Place going on and on about pataphysics... it seemed the right thing to say!\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** Hopefully your banter improves by the time you face down Crocker again. It's a vital survival skill in Sloth's Pit.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Can we just write that down as heat of the moment and move on?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** How much longer is this?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Oh, about twenty more minutes, counting the post-credits scene.\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** ...You can't let them sit through that.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** What, are you going to quote some metafictional bullhonkey as to why I can't?\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate** 'Three can keep a secret if two of them are dead'. \n\n**MacPhaerson:** Oh sweetie, Threshold's not a secret. You're just ineffective.\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** How do you--\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** What are you //on// about?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** You'll see. Wait for the end credits scene.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Technically it's //mid//-credits.

Right?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Why are you being nice to me?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** ...Okay, I'll be honest. Seagal was the //worst// possible choice to play you and I'm showing some sympathy.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Oh. Thank you?\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** Here comes the lauded mid-credits scene. Let's see how bad this-- what the fuck?\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//The video quality of this portion appears as if it was shot on a hand-held camera, a notable downgrade from the rest of the picture. It shows the interior of the O5 Council's chambers at Site-[REDACTED], and depicts all of the O5s present as themselves. O5-0 is visible in a platform at the center.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Dr. Reynolds:** What is this?\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Pla-- //Temporary// footage.\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** ...That's O5-4...\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** How on //Earth// do //you// of all people know what O5-4 looks like?\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** It... it is. Trust us on this.\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** No, that... that figure in the center. It matches depictions of Norris Arklay. One of the possible identities of O5-0.\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** That looks a lot like Nur, honestly... what the //Hell// is happening?\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**O5-0:** The Foundation is the cause. The sole cause. Every time you lock up an anomaly, every time you conduct a test or publish a document — steal the Natural elements and apply your artificial understandings and definitions — you choke magic out of reality. //O5-0 sighs and relaxes their restraints.// A Foundation that secures and contains is incompatible with the anomalous.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n//Prolonged silence on the recording, other than the film playing. Dr. Sinclair takes in a horrified gasp.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** ...What kind of sick joke is VKTM playing here? I thought-- if this is supposed to make some kind of point about the Truth, or about how the Foundation is evil, we get it. But it... this isn't -- this //can't --//\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**O5-0:** Humanity existed long before the Foundation. You tell yourselves that you're preventing countless untold apocalypses and raptures, but you're preventing change. You prevent the entropic effects of the Natural world on the artificial and, in so doing, cause the accelerated entropy of the Natural.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** It's true.\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** Dr. Wettle, I recognize you're a pessimist, but how can you //possibly// know that //any// of this actually happened?\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** Okay, you remember a few years back, how our thylacine cloning initiative to contain SCP-12987 and a few other things got leaked, and nobody could figure out //how// it leaked?\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** Of course. There's a population of them in the zoo in Duluth now. But what does--\n\n//Audio briefly cuts out on the camera feeds; The Foundation personnel talk amongst themselves as their faces display a combination of shock and resignation. Dr. Okorie appears to have crushed her cup of soda in apparent anger. Reynolds holds onto Sinclair as she stares at Drs. Wettle and McDoctorate in disbelief. Chief Ibanez scowls, gripping onto her armrest.// \n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n//Tense music plays.//\n\n**O5-13:** The votes are 6 for, 6 against. \n\n//O5-13 frowns in thought, then lets out a long sigh.//\n\n**O5-13:** I vote--\n\n//The screen cuts to black, and the film ends.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n//MacPhaerson applauds.//\n \n**MacPhaerson:** Wooo! What a cliffhanger!\n\n//All other personnel are silent. Dr. Asheworth appears to be nauseous, briefly, before wildly gesticulating.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** //Cholery nikt z nas o tym nie wiedział?! To idzie na sam szczyt, ponad szczyt!//\n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** I... I left the Hand. I left the //Hand//. Why did I... I could have stopped...\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** We got some of the Crown at Site-43, I... I remember seeing it in the Abatement catalog, and... I guess this makes sense.\n\n**Dr. Reynolds:** None of this makes sense. //None of it//.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Oh, it will once you've seen the sequel. We did something ambitious with it!\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Mari, //shut it//.\n\n**MacPhaerson:** Don't talk back to your wife, Willie!\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** I'm married to VTKM //as a whole//. And what you've just-- //why?!// Why show this to //any// of us?!\n\n**MacPhaerson:** William, come on, really? Winnie's doing //great// by the way, did you get her letters?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** //Mari//--\n\n**MacPhaerson:** I'm terribly sorry, I'd love to continue this conversation, but I have a meeting regarding voice acting rights for our exciting new animated spin-off of the SCP Cinematic Universe, //What About...?// Feel free to stretch your legs before part two starts!\n\n//MacPhaerson's seat tilts back, and she vanishes into the floor. Ibanez feels at the carpet of the theater for seams, and finds none.//\n\n**Dr. Asheworth:** ...What do we do now? \n\n**Dr. Sinclair:** I-I have... I have a daughter... oh God, what if the Foundation... what if they use her as collateral? I can't //know// this, I need amnestics, I need to get away.\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** What are you going to do, get back in [[[SCP-8787|the magic coffee shop?]]]\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Dr. Sinclair, if I may? Place, myself, and at least six other people have known about this since the end of 2021. We're still alive.\n\n**Dr. Reynolds:** Who else?\n\n**Dr. Wettle:** Uh... Dan Navarro. Dr. Doja Cat...\n\n**Dr. McDoctorate:** He means //Athenodora// Cat. Also-- Ibanez, have you been recording this?\n\n**Chief Ibanez:** ...Fuck. I have. Asheworth's got monitoring equipment on him, too. What do we--\n\n**Dr. Okorie:** Katherine, come over here for a moment? Dan, Fina, look at me.\n\n//Dr. Sinclair walks over to Dr. Okorie, who wraps her in a hug. Sinclair returns the hug; the combined thaumic auras of the two Type Blue personnel cause the recording equipment to fail.//\n\nEND LOG\n[[/div]]\n\nCurrently, it is believed that several members of Foundation personnel have been radicalized by Splinter Cell 6500-01 (\"The Threshold\" or \"Threshold Guardians\"), a group of Foundation dissidents dedicated to independently recovering, studying and utilizing anomalous items that are of Artifact level-- i.e. capable of undoing or halting another Impasse. The following members of personnel, and their respective Sites, have been added to monitoring by MTF Lambda-11:\n\n* Dr. Katherine Sinclair\n* Dr. Montgomery Reynolds\n* Dr. Udo Okorie\n* Chief Delfina Ibanez\n* Director Daniel Asheworth\n\nHowever, due to the relative ineffectiveness of Splinter Cell 6500-01 (see documentation for Splinter Cell 6500-01's failed attempts at recovering Dante's Atlas, the Bell of Entropy, and the Daedalic Manuscripts) it is currently believed that minimal threat is posed by this faction, and the greater threat comes from the possibility that SCP-8650 is distributed among the larger population of Foundation personnel, and the greater anomalous community.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n< [[[SCP-8649]]] | SCP-8650 | [[[SCP-8651]]] >\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
