Testing of any instances must be approved by the Head Researcher. If not in experimentation, only security officers with at least Class-3 Memetic Resistance training are permitted to handle and transport SCP-7669 instances.\n\nMobile Task Force Upsilon-23 (“Art Critics”) and Eta-10 (“See No Evil”), as well as agents situated in anomalous communities, are responsible for coordinating routine screenings for new instances of SCP-7669 at galleries, theatres, hotels, and brothels. Due to SCP-7669's anomalous properties, treatment with amnestics is unnecessary unless subjects have experienced any neurological issues following multiple exposures. In this case, subjects are treated with Class C amnestics and emitted to the nearest civilian hospital for any necessary medical care.\n\n------\n\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-7669 refers to --a collection of 12-- an unknown number of //(See Addendum 7669.2)// cognitohazardous paintings of various sizes and mediums. Whilst each of the paintings has differing styles, including cubism, De Stijl, geometric abstraction, suprematism, expressionism, and colour field, all are considered examples of art created during the abstract movement. Outside of their shared theme, all paintings have been signed with the same signature, \"//With Love, Cally//\". Below each signature is a \"kiss mark\", made using dark crimson lipstick. DNA analysis has failed to identify the creator of this mark.\n\nSCP-7669 cognitohazardous properties manifest when subjects come into eye contact with them. Upon observation, subjects experience a strong compulsion to maintain visual contact with the instance. This compulsion, whilst strong, can be resisted if the subject has the appropriate psionic training or if they possess low spatial and interpersonal intelligence. Despite its strength, SCP-7669's compulsion effect is temporary, with the effect subsiding suddenly after a period of time[[footnote]] This period varies, with the longest recorded period being 20 minutes.[[/footnote]]. Following this period, the subjects will experience a sudden increase in dopamine, melatonin, and oxytocin, resulting in the subjects experiencing feelings of excitement, happiness, melancholy, and arousal. However, a majority of subjects also experience light-headedness, high blood pressure, muscle pain, and headaches.\n\nDuring the viewing period, as well as the compulsion, the subject will also try to comprehend certain aspects of the instance, identifying patterns, designs, methods, or images. Experimentation has found that no two subjects have managed to come to the same comprehension. This desire to comprehend and understand the contents of SCP-7669 instances increases in intensity the longer the subject remains in visual contact, with the majority of subjects becoming frustrated, aroused, and even aggressive. Many subjects also experience muscle tension and heightened blood pressure during this period. Like with the compulsion effect, this desire will subside after a period of time.\n\nUpon the completion of the observation period, SCP-7669's anti-memetic properties will come into effect. After ceasing observations with SCP-7669, subjects will quickly find they are unable to remember any thoughts, comprehensions, or conclusions they made during their visual contact with SCP-7669, although are able to recall physical sensations and emotions experienced.\n\nWhilst short-term exposure is considered harmless, long-term exposure to SCP-7669 has a severe impact on the nervous system of its subjects. Those who had been exposed multiple times to an SCP-7669 instance developed several neurological issues, including problems with depth and special perception, anterograde amnesia, and various types of agnosia[[footnote]] **Anterograde amnesia:** The inability to create new memories after the event or complete inability to recall the recent past.\n**Agnosia:** The inability to process sensory information.[[/footnote]]. Long-term exposure also results in the compulsion period a subject experiences lengthening and the subject developing an addiction to observing SCP-7669.\n\n------\n\n**Discovery:**\n\nSCP-7669 was brought to the Foundation's attention on 05/11/2015 by an Agent Han Ngiam working undercover in [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/locations-of-interest#backdoor-soho|FP-02]]] (\"Backdoor Soho\"). Agent Ngiam first witnessed SCP-7669 during a masquerade gala, organised by GoI-012 (\"Marshall, Carter, and Dark\"), where numerous Groups of Interest situated in FP-02 provided entertainment, craftsmanship, and cuisine. 12 instances of SCP-7669 had been provided and hung in individual private rooms. Following the gala, Agent Ngiam alerted the Foundation and a raid conducted by MTF Mu-3 (\"Highest Bidders\") and MTF Pi-1 (\"City Slickers\") on a warehouse in Sunset Park, New York City, which contained many of the items used during the gala. SCP-7669 was one of the many anomalies obtained.\n\nWhen asked for details about SCP-7669 during the gala, Agent Ngiam claimed that it had been provided by GoI-669 (\"[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-569-fr|Caldeira]]]\")[[footnote]] A network of establishments offering goods and services related to abnormal sex. Known to often supply and cooperate with various other Groups of Interest, especially GoI-012 (\"Marshall, Carter, and Dark\"), whom they regularly supply with escorts, prostitutes, and fetish equipment.[[/footnote]] and all viewings had to be requested by an individual known as \"//Mx. Gisèle//\". When asked to describe the individual, Agent Ngiam reported that \"//Mx. Gisèle//\" possessed metamorphic capabilities, altering between various genders and sexes through the gala. Due to the strong possibility of their connection with GoI-669, the individual was added to the Person of Interest roster.\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 7669.1: Experiment Log Transcript**\n\nBelow is an extract from one of the tests initially conducted on SCP-7669. Each experiment was carried out using one D-class personnel, isolated in a Standard Human containment cell with electroencephalogram electrodes secured to their heads and a shock collar to their neck.\n\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ 7669-E-17\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n**Date:** 19/11/2015\n**Researcher:** Dr. Lolly Soot\n**Subject:** D-7787\n**Item:** SCP-7669\n\n------\n\n**- Begin Log -**\n\n**Dr. Soot:** D-7787, you can remove the shroud now.\n\n//(D-7787 removes the shroud covering the SCP-7669 instance.)//\n\n**D-7787:** Oh - is that it?\n\n**Dr. Soot:** Yes. Can you give the painting a good look, please?\n\n**D-7787:** Ok - sure.\n\n//(D-7787 looks at SCP-7669. After 30 seconds, they approach the painting examining it more closely.)//\n\n**D-7787:** What's that - is that a leg?\n\n**Dr. Soot:** What can you see, D-7787?\n\n**D-7787:** I thought I saw a leg but - but there's something else. There - there's something moving.\n\n**Dr. Soot:** In the painting?\n\n**D-7787:** Yeah - like a wave - ##transparent|move## - a powerful wave.\n\n//(D-7787 begins to breath heavily and branch their fingers slowly.)//\n\n**Dr. Soot:** D-7787, can you tell me what you’re feeling right now?\n\n**D-7787:** I'm - I'm - ##transparent|we## - warm.

D-7787 begins to stroke the section, breathing heavily.)//\n\n**Dr. Soot:** D-7787, did you hear me? Can you please return the shroud?\n\n**D-7787:** It's getting warmer - the red - it's like blood - ##transparent|pain.## - all red - and - warm - and lumpy - ##transparent|Lumpy. We are lumpy.

Security officers are called.)//\n\n**- End Log -**\n\n------\n\n**Afterward:** D-7787 was removed successfully by security officers, 20 seconds after the log was completed. Following their subjection to SCP-7669, D-7787 experience a mild headache and muscle stiffness. As expected, D-7787 could not remember what had occurred during the experiment but made several requests to witness SCP-7669 again. All requests were denied. D-7787's [DATA EXPUNGED] was removed from the SCP-7669 instance by personnel with Class-3 Memetic Resistance training.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n**Addendum 7669.2: PoI-7669-01**\n\nOn 06/01/2016, after performing several investigations, the Biology Division discovered a sample of DNA from one of the 12 SCP-7669 instances ascertained. Further analysis also determined that the DNA was from a seminal fluid sample. The DNA was traced to a French fine artist, Etienne Dumont (PoI-7669-01), whom the Foundation traced to Nouvel Hôpital Civil, Strasbourg, France. When investigated, Dumont was found to be in a persistent vegetative state, with signs of cerebral cortical functions. Personnel from the Medical Department confirmed Dumont's condition.\n\nAccording to police and hospital records, Dumont was found in his apartment on 17/11/2015, in the same vegetative state. When their apartment was investigated by agents, a further 7 instances of SCP-7669 were discovered, all painted by Dumont. Along with the SCP-7669 instances, numerous diary entries, and photographs of the SCP-7669 instances[[footnote]] SCP-7669's anomalous properties did not activate through the photograph. [[/footnote]], paintings, art materials, and sketches were discovered, none of which showed any anomalous properties. Below are some of the legible diary entries written by Dumont:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▷ Diary excerpts of Etienne Dumont\" hide=\"▽ Diary excerpts of Etienne Dumont\"]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: #f4f4e0; text-color:black;\"]]\nCalvin came by today. Said he and his boyfriend had had a fight and wanted to crash at my place. Said I'd barely known he was there. I kicked the lazy arsehole out after he pissed all my dyes onto the floor. He needs to quit the pot.\n\nTo be honest, even without Calvin's blundering, I didn't get far. I just don't know where I'm going with my stuff. Every time I try and do something, I get distracted and then I can't get back to where I was.\n\nCarman's gonna cut me off for sure.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: #f4f4e0; text-color:black;\"]]\nCarman's cut me off.

I'll never be cool.\n\nCalvin came banging on my door at midnight last night. I helped him sober up and got him to bed. I hate the guy but I don't want him hurt.\n\nHe repaid me the next morning with a card to this company. He said they could help me with my walls. I don't need a hooker. I need a muse.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"background-color: #f4f4e0; text-color:black;\"]]\nThe landlord turned up today. I managed to persuade them to give me a two-week deferral.

I didn't know what to ask for and I just blurted out I wanted inspiration. I think she found it funny and said someone called Yuki would be over the next day.\n\nShe was amazing. Curved. Sharp. And the hair. It moved like it was in water. It never stopped. When she came in, she didn't even ask me what I wanted and just got on with it. It was the best I've ever had. And I saw things. Shapes. Faces. Screams. She said she could have that effect on people. I didn't care. I'd found what I needed.\n\nAfter I had to paint. I couldn't afford to forget what I saw. Yuki asked if she could be in it. I don't remember saying yes but in the end I'm happy I did. She fit in so well.\n\nShe left not long after I finished. When I tried to pay her, she said no but said her boss would be in touch about doing more paintings.

They gave me this look and said they'd help me get things rolling.\n\nNext thing I know we were having sex.\n\nTurns out Gisèle can change their sex at will. They'd been a woman when they'd come in.

I did a couple, some as her and some as him. When I finished, they said I needed to look further. I needed to find the shapes. The figures. The patterns. They said they worked and saw beauty in every form and I needed to find a way of capturing that. They said their clients wanted to see the beauty and enticement.

According to neighbours and the building's landlord, Dumont created 17 paintings for the individual known as Gisèle. After studying the photographs found at their apartment, it was determined that only 2 of the originally discovered SCP-7669 instances had been created by Dumont. This discovery heavily implies that multiple artists had been commissioned to create instances of SCP-7669. Attempt to identify these individuals are ongoing and SCP-7669 has been reclassified from Safe [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]●[[/span]] to Euclid [[span style=\"color:yellow\"]]●[[/span]].\n\nOn 10/01/2016, Dumont was subjected to psionic investigation and was found to be projecting strong telepathic signals, suggesting a degree of consciousness. As it couldn't be determined if the consciousness was Dumont, he was subjected to a psiophone[[footnote]] A device capable of measuring telepathic and tele-empathic signals and projections and converting them into electrical signals.[[/footnote]]. When Dumont's psiophone results were fed through a visualiser, the resulting image depicted a crude humanoid face, not resembling Dumont, appearing to be experiencing intense ecstasy and arousal.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Abstract.jpg\n> **Name:** Abstract expressive abstract abstracts drawings paintings ink on paper black and white raphael perez\n> **Author:** Raphael Perez Israeli Artist\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/99581103@N06/39809024114\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7668]]] | SCP-7669 | [[[SCP-7670]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
