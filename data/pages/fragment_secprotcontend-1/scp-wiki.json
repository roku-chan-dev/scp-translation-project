ACO-7798 is believed to have formerly been a planet class object, which disintegrated into its current state through natural means[[footnote]]Disputed[[/footnote]]. \n\nTraversal to/through ACO-7798 is not advised due to high meteor belt density, abundance of alternative routes, and low importance. Extraction of natural resources have been set as a low priority due to the value of present resources and isolation from existing Galactic infrastructure.\n\nArtificial resources should be studied, not salvaged. Archeological study of ACO-7798 is deemed low priority, due to its low importance in Galactic history and low chance for new technological insight.\n\nArtifact composition:\n* Structural ruins (Dwellings, workplaces, gathering places, etc.)- 98.2%\n* Other relics (Tools, furniture, etc.) - 1.6%\n* Information cache relics (Written records, storage servers, story-telling monuments, etc.) - 0.2%\n\nMicroscopic, cellular life is present. Proof of macroscopic and intelligent life has also been found. Presumed extinct.\n\n**Advanced Information:** ACO-7798 relics consists mainly of structural ruins made up of an artificial stone like material. Day-to-day use relics are mostly made up of processed metals and plastics.  Informational caches on ACO-7798 are unusually rare. Initial investigation has shown that all surviving information caches were constructed by a single organization.\n\nACO-7798 was host to a wide variety of species and biospheres. The dominant intelligent species, classified Species ACO-7798-1, was present on all land environments. They called themselves Homo Sapiens, or Humans. They called their planet Earth. The disintegration of the planet into an asteroid belt is believed to driven the biosphere into its current form. Of note, biological remains of Humans are unusually rare.\n\n**ACO-7798 Unorganized Information:** The following are files have been identified by AI as pertaining to ACO-7798, but have been flagged (by AI) for intelligent organization due to potential for deeper insight into ACO-7798 if organized by Intelligent beings.\n\n**Recovered Relics:**\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: black; width: 20%;\"]]\nRelic Designation\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: black;\"]]\nDescription\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nACO-7798-RELIC1\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nRefined metal shaped in a long, flat, curved fashion.

All items affected will## hereafter referred to as SCP-7798-1. Noticeable amounts of ##cyan|data## will be removed from SCP-7798-1 via anomalous means. For example, ##cyan|books are rendered blank,## and no traces of ink will remain.\n\n##cyan|Human memory is affected by SCP-7798, which can be tracked by recording brain activity. Severity ranges from slight forgetfulness to full brain death.  The conditions gets worse with time. There are no recorded instances of recovery.##\n\n**Addendum SCP-7798.1:** Currently, the primary way of mitigating SCP-7798 from affecting ##cyan|digital  information## is storing them within DEEPWELL facilities. However, the cost of doing this with every ##cyan|document known to humanity is## incredibly large.\n\nAt the time of discovery, SCP-7798 only affected mostly-ignored texts. However, the amount of information being lost with each discovered instance has grown ##cyan|exponentially##. As of 2063/2/2, the Foundation estimates a full IT-class ##cyan|\"End of Information\"## Scenario by the ##cyan|2078/4/5, and full ED-K Mass Lethe Scenario encompassing all of human conciousness## if ##cyan|no countermeasure is found.##\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 7798-2\n|clearance= 0\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= apollyon\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Aanomaly-class-bar/apollyon-icon.svg\n|disruption-class= amida\n|risk-class= critical\n]]\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Research is to be directed towards neutralizing the effects of SCP-7798-2. or neutralizing SCP-7798-2 altogether.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7798-2 is a ##cyan|intelligent, sapient, malevolent## celestial object ##cyan|directly hostile to human information. It is## approximately 1.6x larger than the sun, ##cyan|and## located ##cyan|50## light years away from Earth. Noospheric imaging indicates that the information lost from SCP-7798-1 instances go towards SCP-7798-2 at a faster-than-noospheric-light speed.\n\nInformation lost as a result of SCP-7798 is always related to humanity in some fashion, whether it describes a man-made object or describes people/personified objects in a narrative. SCP-7798 also never affects information pertaining to natural phenomena. Due to these facts, SCP-7798 is theorized to be hostile to specifically human information and/or life.\n\nSCP-7798-2 ##cyan|travels## faster than light.
