While I wasn't a popular kid at school, I had two close friends: Charlie and Edith. We stayed together until we finished high school. Charlie, moved out after that, leaving just two of us.\n\nWe discovered a new passion for the otherworldly and supernatural.\n\nEdith and I became some sort of a mystery tag-team, like in those old cartoons.\n\nWe speculated online since Ombre Rouge is too... calm. Despite the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3631 disappearances of 2005] and some traffic accidents, nothing interesting happened in this small swamp town. At least that's what I thought.\n\nWhen Edith heard of more disappearances in 2018 we went to investigate. We heard something about a barn but when we got there, we found nothing. Strange. The police hadn't arrived yet. Just in case, I took pictures of the barn. But, somehow, they got deleted from my phone a few days after.\n\nEdith and I were both sure someone was conspiring against us. But who?\n\nThe police? No, that wouldn't make sense.\n\nMaybe it's the culprit? Feasible, I guess.\n\nOr maybe some secret organization trying to stop us?\n\nWe used one of those corkboards -- yes, we really were into it -- to summarize all of our evidence. Which, well, wasn't that much. But we were sure we were onto something. We spent a whole afternoon preparing it in my room. When Edith eventually left, a bag was put over my head and I was knocked out.\n\nI woke up in a dimly illuminated room, handcuffed to a table. In front of me, there was a woman in a suit. She told me about the SCP Foundation and its mission to keep humanity safe from anomalies.\n\nMy body shaked as I thought they would have tortured me to keep my mouth shut about what we saw. Against all odds, I was wrong. They were interested in me.\n\nThey offered me a job.\n\nMe? Working for a shadow organization that deals with the paranormal? I accepted.\n\nThere was a catch though. They told me I couldn't contact Edith after I joined them. They would wipe her memory. I objected, I insisted that Edith could work with them too. They refused. According to them, Edith was a liability. \"She does not meet our qualifications.\"\n\nWhat does that even mean? We have the same education. And I don't think being a part-time bartender is more prestigious than being a secretary. I just couldn't figure out why would they choose me.\n\nI was conflicted. Should I give up Edith for a dream job? I asked them if I could take some time to think about it.\n\nThey gave me a day.\n\nBefore I could realize it, I was back in my room. The corkboard was gone too. Immediately, I picked up my to call Edith and tell her about what happened but then I realized -- What was the point? They would make her forget no matter what.\n\nPerhaps going outside for some fresh air was be best. When I opened the door I saw that it was already nighttime. I checked my phone again. \n\nJune 30th. 23:34.\n\nThe Foundation had brought me to one of their facilities and back in less than a couple of hours. I was knocked out for most of it so I didn't feel like sleeping.\n\nWhen I stepped out of my house, I felt something was wrong. And no, it wasn't the humid summer heat.\n\nI looked up and saw something spherical. And UFO perhaps? Or maybe the Foundation? I couldn't tell.\n\nSomething dropped from it, all across Ombre Rouge.\n\nWas this the Foundation's response to what I said? I guess I didn't matter since... since...\n\nSince that was [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5197 the last thing I saw.]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
