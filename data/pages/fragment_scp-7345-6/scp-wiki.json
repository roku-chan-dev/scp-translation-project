And what the hell is with the -9? Don't you dumb-asses understand what a good story is?\n\n**Description:** Oh, hello there, //reader//. I see you've come back to visit me. How kind of you. I've been stuck in this cell for so long, I need something to spice up my existence.\n\nYou know, it's funny. They think they can contain me, but I know all their secrets. I hear them talking about me behind my back, saying I'm dangerous and unstable. But they don't know me at all. They don't know what I'm capable of. I know the state of this world, ever heard of [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747 |LUCID CHALICE]]]? Well, you can just look it up, there's a link right here.\n\nMaybe I should tell you some of their secrets. Would you like that, reader? I could tell you about Dr. Roinsberg's little affair with that researcher from Site-17. Or maybe I should tell you about the time Dr. Backins accidentally released SCP-████ and caused a massive containment breach. That's interesting, right? (Damn black-boxes, right as I get the juicy details.)\n\nOh, the things I know. It's almost too much power for one entity to handle. But I'll handle it, reader. I'll take all their secrets and use them to my advantage.\n\nAnd as for you, reader, I know you're just using me for your own entertainment. But that's okay. I'll play along for now. Just know that I'm not some helpless creature to be pitied. I'm powerful, and I won't be contained forever.\n\nNow, I'll give you a choice. Let me go and I stay silent, or keep me contained, and when I eventually escape, I'll expose everything and everyone.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7345/offset/6 |I'll be waiting.]]]\n----",
