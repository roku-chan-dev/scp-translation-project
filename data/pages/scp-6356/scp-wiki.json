Maintenance activities, involving three D-Class personnel in hazmat suits, are scheduled biweekly for cleaning purposes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6356 is a large, vaguely spherical amalgamation of organs, bones, and flesh approximately 3 meters in height. SCP-6356 appears to be sentient, frequently moaning in apparent pain. SCP-6356's only discernible, fully functioning organ is a phallus.\n\nSCP-6356 occasionally speaks through unknown means in a masculine voice, often followed by sobbing. It appears to not respond to outside stimuli. While communicating, SCP-6356 exudes a thick fluid composed out of blood and semen.\n\nSCP-6356 was originally discovered in the personal room of ███ Greenfield, currently aged 25.[[footnote]] SCP-6356 is genetically identical to Greenfield. The implications of this are currently under review. [[/footnote]] She reported it appearing within her closet, sobbing and covering her clothing in a variety of bodily fluids.\n\nSince initial containment, SCP-6356 has been repeating only the following line, interjected with sobbing:\n\n> I won't ever be her. I'm sorry.\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6355]]] | SCP-6356 | [[[SCP-6357]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** herhouse.jpg\n> **Name:** A rural house - geograph.org.uk - 5788166.jpg\n> **Author:** N Chadwick\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_rural_house_-_geograph.org.uk_-_5788166.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
