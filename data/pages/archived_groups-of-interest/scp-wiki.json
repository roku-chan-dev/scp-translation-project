There are many other groups in existence who possess, use, or attempt to create SCP objects, either for their own personal gain or for the protection of mankind. Some are rival organizations, some are splinter groups of the Foundation, and some are trusted associates of the Foundation. In any case, it has been deemed necessary to create and distribute a brief on what agencies the Foundation knows about, and our stance towards them.\n\n[[toc]]\n\n++ Alexylva University\n\nVery little is known about Alexylva University or its motives. Evidence appears to suggest that the organization exists in some sort of alternate universe in which Latin and Greek cultures maintain dominance at least over the Western Hemisphere; nothing to date is known about any other part of this world. All University-related objects have been found in the Mid-Southern United States, and more specifically in Tennessee, leading Foundation researchers to believe the University itself is located in that geographical area. \n\nMany objects associated with the University (which is not believed to have built the objects) are recovered during postal transit via an agency known as \"Phitransimun Combine\" and accompanied by relevant paperwork, which has helped shed light on the objects and the place from which they came. To date, all that is known about the methods that transfer the objects is that the technology uses principles similar to that of the Einstein-Rosen Bridge, a concept considered purely theoretical by contemporary science. A particular section of the University known as the Department of Natural Philosophy is considered responsible for the transferences, possibly without the knowledge or consent of the rest of the organization. \n\nCatalogued SCPs relevant to Alexylva University include [[[SCP-877]]], [[[SCP-961]]], [[[SCP-1043]]], [[[SCP-1080]]], [[[SCP-1081]]], [[[SCP-1083]]], [[[SCP-1546]]], and [[[SCP-1998]]].

Lead by Vincent Anderson, and specializing in the sale of anomalous androids, robots, artificial intelligences, and cybernetics, Anderson Robotics has quickly gained a fair amount of traction in the realm of paratechnology. The group’s small size, remarkable espionage capabilities, and surprisingly large resource base has made apprehension of any Anderson employee difficult, with only a handful of Anderson products currently in the hands of the Foundation.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //anderson//, [/system:page-tags/tag/anderson#pages click here].\n\n----\n\n++ [[[are-we-cool-yet-hub|Are We Cool Yet?]]]\n\nA collective of \"art terrorists\", the members of Are We Cool Yet? are capable of either obtaining or producing anomalous objects and entities, and using them to create art installations. These installations are placed for maximum public exposure, and are often -- but not always -- fatal to bystanders; the phrase \"Are We Cool Yet?\" is always present in some way.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //are-we-cool-yet//, [/system:page-tags/tag/are-we-cool-yet click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[black-queen-hub|The Black Queen]]]\n\nVery little conclusive information has been recovered about the person of interest called the Black Queen. She claims the given name \"Alison Chao\", the name of the daughter of researcher Dr. ██████ Gears and ██████ ███ Chao before Gears' recruitment by the Foundation.\n\nThe Black Queen possesses unusual knowledge of Foundation structure and activities, and contained anomalies. The reason for this unusual knowledge has yet to be conclusively identified, but it appears to be gained partially through anomalous means (including the possibility of extra-universal information sources). She has repeatedly been able to breach Foundation security utilizing this information, in addition to classified anomalous means. \n\nConflicting reports exist of the Black Queen's activities and motivations (likely due to multiple individuals or deliberate counter-intelligence). Initial reports characterize her as malevolent, murderous, and destructive. Other reports characterize her as neutral or benevolent. All intelligence indicates her hostility towards the Foundation.\n\nThere are reports of the Black Queen's involvement with most major Groups of Interest known to the Foundation, along with several world governments. Unverified sources claim that she is the same individual as L.S. of the Serpent's Hand, and that L.S. stands for \"Little Sister\". The reason for this unusual close connection is possibly due to the Black Queen's use of the Wanderers' Library. \n\nIntelligence indicates the presence of multiple other individuals also calling themselves \"the Black Queen\". The nature and origin of these individuals is inconclusive.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //black-queen//, [/system:page-tags/tag/black-queen click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[chaos-insurgency-hub|The Chaos Insurgency]]]\n\nThe Chaos Insurgency is a splinter group of the Foundation, created by a rogue cell that went A.W.O.L. with several SCP objects in 1924. Since then, the Insurgency has become a major player on the world stage, using the anomalies that it obtains for its own benefit and to consolidate its global power base. The Insurgency not only deals in anomalies, but also in weapons running and intelligence gathering.\n\nIt makes use of authoritarian regimes in poor and developing countries, often using their populations in the same manner as the Foundation does D-Class personnel. It helps to maintain the extreme poverty and war that is suffered by these countries, so that it can continue its radical experimentation, easy conscription of forces, and lucrative business deals with various opposing factions.\n\nMost of the anomalous objects possessed by the Insurgency are unknown. Among the most notable items are the \"Staff of Hermes\", an item capable of warping the physical and chemical properties of any matter it touches, and the \"Bell of Entropy\", an object that can cause a variety of destructive effects depending on where it is struck. Both of these objects were originally obtained at no small cost by the Foundation, and were stolen by the original founders of the Insurgency. \n\nThe SCP objects and other anomalies stolen from the Foundation typically possess high potential for direct utility, but the Insurgency has also made use of anomalies with less direct applications, such as [[[SCP-884]]].\n\nThe main base of operations of the Insurgency is unknown, as are its current leaders. This organization is directly antagonistic to the Foundation, using deadly force to attempt to prevent Foundation containment of multiple anomalies. The Foundation has also been infiltrated by agents of the Insurgency in the past, resulting in the loss of valuable scientific data, theft of a number of anomalies, and deaths of personnel. Personnel are made to be aware of possible raids, terrorist action, and spies from the Insurgency, and are to notify their superiors about any activities from fellow personnel fitting the Insurgency behavioral profile.\n\nOther SCP objects which have been associated with the Insurgency include [[[SCP-244]]], [[[SCP-355]]], [[[SCP-830]]], [[[SCP-1316]]], [[[SCP-1943]]], and [[[SCP-2490]]].

Led by one Robert Bumaro, they are a group of zealots, believing many of the SCP items to be parts of a \"god\" that was broken after the creation of the universe. By restoring it to its whole state, they will also gain godhood. Since first contact, three other key components of the \"god\" have also been tentatively identified: [[[SCP-217]]], [[[SCP-271]]] and [[[SCP-1139]]]. A sect dedicated to the Church built [[[SCP-808]]].\n\nThey are extremely hostile to Foundation operatives, branding them \"heretics\", and will attempt to kill operatives and break containment of SCP items. It is unknown how they are able to detect these items, but they have shown their ability to do so with frightening accuracy. In addition, they have shown a remarkable ability to resist the mental effects of SCP items, notably [[[SCP-882]]] and its \"mental lure\".\n\nThe Church is viewed as a threat to both the SCP Foundation and mankind. Members are to be detained by force, or eliminated by whatever means deemed necessary by Foundation agents.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //broken-god//, [/system:page-tags/tag/broken-god click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ Doctor Wondertainment\n\nIt is unknown whether Doctor Wondertainment is an individual or an organization. All that is known is that Doctor Wondertainment is capable of producing anomalous artifacts and entities which thematically resemble children's toys.\n\nLinks to the Factory have been speculated but are unconfirmed.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //dr-wondertainment//, [/system:page-tags/tag/dr-wondertainment click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ The Factory\n\nLittle is known about The Factory, except that they seem capable of manufacturing anomalous artifacts -- and that they use mass-production techniques to do so.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //factory//, [/system:page-tags/tag/factory click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[fifthist-hub|The Fifth Church]]]\n\n//\"This church is to other churches what clowns are to people. There are some superficial similarities, but all the wrong things are being emphasized and exaggerated so you can't quite put your finger on what is wrong. . . Sure, it isn't out to get you, but what does it mean? Why is it there? What happens if it calls to you?\"// --Dr. █████\n\nThe Fifth Church, also known as the Church of Fifthism or the Fifthist Fellowship, is a highly secretive religious organization which possesses ties throughout the entertainment industry. Despite repeated investigations, culminating in the 2007 nationwide sting known as \"Operation Stargazer\", no further details regarding its doctrines, its practices, its number of members, or its goals have been confirmed, although a watchlist is maintained of 100 confirmed and suspected Fifthist celebrities and other prominent personalities. Its origins have been placed in varying points in the mid-20th Century and various locations in North America and Asia, but some sources have dated it to centuries earlier.\n\nThe Fifth Church has never communicated directly with the SCP Foundation, but is to be considered a hostile force.\n\nObjects attributed to this group which are currently under Foundation custody include [[[SCP-1523]]], [[[SCP-1982]]], [[[SCP-1724]]], and [[[SCP-1425]]].

More recently, however, they have also been implicated in supplying anomalies to left-wing political organizations. While Gamers Against Weed organizes its activities primarily over internet channels, several real-world locations associated with the group have been identified and raided. Current intelligence suggests that Gamers Against Weed is in the process of creating and distributing a set of anomalous humanoids to parody Dr. Wondertainment's \"Little Misters\" series, and that it is aware of the Foundation's operations, if not its exact nature.\n\nDetainment of Gamers Against Weed's members has proven more difficult than anticipated. Some of the group's organizers are believed to possess reality-altering capabilities, either in their own right or through access to outside resources. Current operations are focused on the containment of related anomalies and the identification and analysis of Gamers Against Weed's most dangerous members.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //gamers-against-weed//, [/system:page-tags/tag/gamers-against-weed click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[goc-hub-page|The Global Occult Coalition (GOC)]]]\n\nThe GOC was created in the aftermath of WWII, from the remnants of defecting occultists, psychics, priests, and scientists from Nazi, Soviet, and Allied states, brought together and formed by the Allies. As the world stage broadened, so too did the number of countries that had their hands in the GOC, until it became what it is today.\n\nThe GOC are a largely political force, seeing themselves as the police of the paranormal world. They pride themselves on destroying supernatural entities, and make use of the most high-tech experimental technology possible, obtained from their benefactors. Many potential SCPs have been destroyed by them before the Foundation could obtain and contain them.\n\nThey have been both on the side of the Foundation and against it at times, depending on the situation. They largely hold the Foundation in contempt for their use and containment of SCP items rather than their out-and-out destruction. The GOC has respected the Foundation's formidable might enough to leave it mostly alone, although there have been some questionable incidents with which the GOC have strictly denied involvement.\n\nAgents of the GOC are to be treated with suspicion.\n\nThe GOC are known to have involved themselves with [[[SCP-1609]]] and [[[SCP-1899]]].

V. Stalin, its first task being the investigation of the murder of S. M. Kirov.\n\nDuring WWII, the Commission expanded into newly reorganized GRU as Division \"P\" - Psychotronics, working to counteract anomalous threats from the SS, Ahnenerbe, and the Vatican, and to capture and study anomalous artifacts both home and abroad for the benefit of the Soviet government. Division \"P\" has carried on with this role throughout the Cold War, making Foundation operations in the countries of the Comintern difficult.\n\nAfter 1991, rapid restructuring, coupled with budget cuts and the decommissioning or sale of significant assets, resulted in numerous defections of their personnel (A significant proportion of both Chaos Insurgency and MC&D operatives in Eastern Europe originated from GRU Division \"P\" ranks) and the flooding of the European black market with anomalous items formerly in their possession. Currently, this Group of Interest poses little direct threat to the Foundation.\n\nObjects associated with GRU Division \"P\" are [[[SCP-1011]]], [[[SCP-1723]]] and [[[SCP-1232]]].

Currently, there is no evidence that this group exists beyond the allegations of various sapient SCPs and a handful of damaged non-anomalous artifacts. Most instances of related objects typified by humanoid status are physically mutilated in some way, such as [[[SCP-1884]]] and [[[SCP-1860]]]. Others appear to be typical fairground //objets d'art//, such as [[[SCP-1921]]], or take the form of 'attractions' for the show, such as [[[SCP-1956]]] or [[[SCP-1931]]]. Typically, objects related to Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting are found at fairgrounds where the show is said to have 'performed.'\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //herman-fuller//, [/system:page-tags/tag/herman-fuller click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ The Horizon Initiative \n\nThe Horizon Initiative is an organization created in the late 1960s by various influential sects in the main three Abrahamic religions as a response to the growing number of anomalous activities and groups which they perceived as threats. Though the full extent of their goals is uncertain, the Horizon Initiative is known to target SCP objects, either with the intention of retrieving or destroying them, depending on each item's perceived place in their dogma.\n\nThe Initiative is led by a tribunal composed of leaders from the three largest sects involved in its creation, though a large amount of internal strife often leaves the official leadership in less than full control of the organization. The HI's main combat force, Project Malleus, is generally deployed in anti-cult operations and in SCP retrieval operations.\n\nThe Initiative's relations with most other Groups of Interest and the Foundation seems to be in a state of constant flux; while all parts of the HI perceive the Church of the Broken God and Fifth Church with a great degree of hostility (and at times engaging them in armed conflict), sentiments toward the Foundation and the GOC vary greatly, from open hostility to a limited willingness to cooperate, depending on the internal affiliation of individual members.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //horizon-initiative//, [/system:page-tags/tag/horizon-initiative click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[manna-charitable-foundation-hub|Manna Charitable Foundation]]]\n\nEstablished in 1971 as an interfaith humanitarian relief agency, recovered documents describe the Manna Charitable Foundation's mission as \"sharing all of God's miracles with the least of His children\". Funded indirectly through associations with various charitable groups and religious organizations, and on occasion publicly endorsed by wealthy philanthropists or academic institutions, the MCF's primary agenda since its founding has been the free distribution of anomalous objects, or their by-products, to civilians living in poverty-stricken regions in the Third World or in areas afflicted by warfare, famine, or natural disaster.\n\nThe MCF is currently recognized as a non-governmental organization by the United Nations, and is known to operate legally and illegally in several hostile or isolated regions outside the Foundation's sphere of influence. While no SCP objects known to have been distributed by the MCF to date have caused intentional harm to human beings or communities (and detained MCF operatives tend to demonstrate strong pacifist beliefs), containment breaches associated with the group have often resulted in human casualties or severe threats to the global status quo due to unforeseen consequences of the object's release from containment, and/or a zeal to distribute potentially \"helpful\" objects immediately without rigorous scientific study of their long-term behavior.\n\nObjects known to be associated with the Manna Charitable Foundation include [[[SCP-1135]]], [[[SCP-1176]]], and [[[SCP-1615]]].

Catering to the super-rich and with extensive political and financial ties worldwide, this group has caused extensive problems for the Foundation.  Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. is known for collecting rare and obscure items, along with providing its members the most exclusive, expensive, and rare experiences available.\n\nThese activities have resulted in conflict with the Foundation on numerous occasions.  The group is not known for the use of force; they prefer to apply extreme financial and political pressure to achieve their goals.  When forced to use more direct means, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. employs outside agents, and it is very difficult to connect said agents to the organization.\n\nMarshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. has caused several SCP containment breaches, primarily through the use of money or social pressure.  Several reports, records, and even items have been leaked by Foundation personnel who had been approached with large amounts of money, or threats of extensive jail time or torture.  Notably, two containment sites were almost brought to public attention after the Foundation refused access to members of Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd.\n\nInformation pertaining to Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., such as the name of the director or even a list of members, has proven very difficult to acquire.  Agents encountering members of this group are advised to maintain a cover story and not, for any reason, reveal Foundation ties or SCP information.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //marshall-carter-and-dark//, [/system:page-tags/tag/marshall-carter-and-dark click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[nobody-hub|\"Nobody\"]]]\n\nLittle is currently known about the person, entity, or group known as \"Nobody\".  First sighted in 1954, they have had numerous appearances since.  There has only been one person seen at any given time, typically described as a male Caucasian dressed in a grey suit and a fedora.  If asked his identity, he replies that he's \"Nobody\".  However, it is not known if this is the work of a single person or multiple agents of a single, unknown agency.  Their agenda is currently unknown, sometimes helping the Foundation, sometimes hindering it.  Caution is recommended if any field agents encounter an operative identifying themselves as \"Nobody\".\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //nobody//, [/system:page-tags/tag/nobody click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[oria-hub|Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA)]]]\n\nThe Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (ORIA) is a paramilitary force, answerable only to the Supreme Leader of Iran, dedicated to the collection and utilization of anomalous artifacts throughout the Middle East and Central Asia. Following the 1979 overthrow of the Imperial Iranian government by revolutionary forces, and subsequent creation of the Islamic Republic of Iran, all Foundation personnel were expelled from Iran as \"agents of colonialism.\" Attempts at maintaining a clandestine presence in the country met with failure, with the majority of Foundation personnel either captured or killed and Sites ██, ███, and ███ being captured by Iranian forces. To prevent Iran from being left behind in the field of extranormal research, the ORIA was created by a secret decree of Supreme Leader Khomeini in 1981. Despite its name, the group has not limited itself to the pursuit of anomalous objects of Islamic origin.\n\nAlthough the ORIA has access to considerable resources, its effectiveness is hobbled by infighting among numerous factions within the organization. Some of these disputes center around philosophical differences, such as the weaponization of anomalous objects, while others appear to be personal in nature. The proliferation of factions appears to have been intentional, as the organization of the ORIA often leaves multiple commanders with overlapping areas of responsibility. It is theorized that the reasoning behind this arrangement was to prevent any one individual from accumulating enough power to pose a challenge to the Supreme Leader.\n\nWith the spread of Iranian hegemony throughout the Middle East and Western Asia, the ORIA has expanded its reach across the region, becoming the foremost paranormal organization in the Middle East. The ORIA is to be considered a hostile force, and Foundation personnel are advised to use extreme caution when engaging.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //reclamation//, [/system:page-tags/tag/reclamation click here].\n\n----\n\n++ [[[oneiroi|Oneiroi Collective]]]\n\nInformation about the Oneiroi Collective has come to the Foundation only through analysis and interviews or the anomalous objects they leave behind. It is believed to be a collective consciousness of dreaming persons and dream-based entities.\n\nIntelligence has shown that they have been documented by other Groups of Interest, usually to a degree similar to the Foundation's interaction. The Oneiroi Collective is apparently capable of contacting even highly isolated entities (e.g. Nobody). Their goals, if any exist, are currently unknown.\n\nDocuments related to the Oneiroi Collective include [[[SCP-2805]]], [[[SCP-2028]]], and [[[SCP-2272]]]. \n\nTo see all documents tagged with //oneiroi//, [/system:page-tags/tag/oneiroi click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[prometheus-labs-hub|Prometheus Labs, Inc.]]]\n\nPrometheus Labs was founded by ██████ ██████ in 1892 as a scientific research and development corporation based in [DATA EXPUNGED] who had over the years developed several potentially marketable products of a preternatural quality.\n\nPrometheus Labs was regarded as a profit organization claiming to \"develop technology and tools that will aid humanity to surmount the so-far extrinsic realm of the paranormal\". Despite posing no direct threat to the Foundation, Prometheus Labs was relatively reckless in their regimens and refused the Foundation's recommendation of special containment procedures for certain products that would warrant them.\n\nOn 01/09/98, one of Prometheus Labs' projects, [DATA EXPUNGED], resulting in the annihilation of their base facility. In the aftermath, the Foundation swept over Prometheus Labs' ground zero and recovered several surviving products and personnel. Products were retrieved as SCPs and survivors inducted as Foundation personnel. The Foundation is currently attempting to establish contact with Prometheus Labs' branches and affiliates.\n\nObjects recovered from Prometheus Labs facilities include [[[SCP-148]]], [[[SCP-155]]], [[[SCP-534]]], and [[[SCP-1290]]].

Adherents practice ritual cannibalism, human sacrifice, corporeal augmentation, thaumaturgy, and dimensional manipulation. Highly secretive, the general public appears to have no direct knowledge of their existence; the one exception being the CotBG, who views them in apocalyptic terms. Organic manipulation has allowed certain Sarkicites to achieve anomalous states of being, transcending the physical limitations of baseline humans. Disease is viewed with reverence and Sarkic shrines have been discovered with offerings of swollen lymph nodes and tumorous growths. Sarkic cults treat contagions as consecration, a means to \"cull the weak\" and purify the masses, and thus actively seek to ensure their spread.\n\nThe Foundation divides known Sarkic cults into two distinct strands: Proto-Sarkic and Neo-Sarkic. Proto-Sarkic cults can be found in insular communities throughout Eurasia's most isolated regions, its followers generally poor (if self-reliant) and hostile towards outsiders. Such groups eschew modernity, display acute technophobia, and are bound by superstition and taboo. In contrast, Neo-Sarkic cults are cosmopolitan, publicly embracing modernity and showing no apparent qualms with technology; their public lives differing little from others of their culture and social status. Adherents are primarily affluent families, rich in history and scandal.\n\nUltimately, it is believed that the Foundation only knows a fraction of what Sarkicism is and what its followers intend. Based on the available information, the speculated goals of Sarkic cults represent an SK-class dominance shift, including the possibility of an XK-class end-of-the-world scenario.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //sarkic//, [/system:page-tags/tag/sarkic click here].\n\n----\n\n++ [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|The Serpent's Hand]]]\n\nThe Serpent's Hand is a small but formidable organization responsible for several security breaches. At least three different individuals have been encountered, all of whom used possible or confirmed anomalous items for infiltration purposes (including [[[SCP-268]]], which was stolen from the Foundation, who had in turn recovered it during a raid of a Chaos Insurgency facility). The total number of members belonging to this organization is unknown, as is their level of technology, number of possible SCPs held, or total level of threat.  However, it is clear they are highly coordinated and possibly dangerous.  One of their leaders is thought to be a figure known as \"L.S.\", who is considered to be personally responsible for two security breaches in Foundation sites.\n\nThe Foundation currently has very little information about the Serpent's Hand, and almost all known information about the Serpent's Hand has been leaked from the GOC intelligence. The group seems to embrace the use and existence of paranormal items, and in particular seems to embrace humanoid and sentient SCPs. The Serpent's Hand has been highly vocal in criticizing the containment and destruction of these SCPs, especially those which are fully human and are not particularly destructive.\n\nThe group seems to have unfriendly relations with the Chaos Insurgency and the ORIA, and an extremely hostile relationship with the GOC. The only recorded cases of unprovoked violence by Serpent's Hand members have been against GOC agents.\n\nThe Serpent's Hand seems primarily based in an anomalous location called the Wanderers' Library, a building accessed through portals found in many different parts of the world. Direct assaults on the Library have so far proven unfeasible, even when entrance could be found. However, initial intelligence seems to suggest the Hand has little understanding or control over the place.\n\n[http://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ Attempts to infiltrate the Wanderers' Library are ongoing.]\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //serpents-hand//, [/system:page-tags/tag/serpents-hand click here].\n\n-----\n\n++ [[[unusual-incidents-unit-hub|Unusual Incidents Unit (UIU), Federal Bureau of Investigation]]]\n\nDisparagingly referred to as \"X-Files\" (after the television program starring David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson) by the larger FBI community, UIU was formed after the SCP-███ Containment Failure Incident brought the existence of paranormal activity to the public consciousness. Although later debunked as a ████ █████████ █████████, a rider attached to HR██████ by Representative ███████ ██████ of ██ (███) required the creation of a special FBI division devoted to rapid response to paranormal events and crimes. Since official protests by then-FBI Director ██████ would have drawn suspicion, UIU was formed on ██-██-████ to \"research and react to paranormal activity\".\n\nMembers of UIU are generally well-meaning, although their lack of effective resources and training often make them a liability in the field. Early attempts to recruit from UIU have met with dismal failure: as UIU is generally considered a dead-end career path, the unit tends to attract the lowest rung of FBI talent. Personnel who request a transfer to UIU voluntarily are few, and those who do generally exhibit high levels of credulity and gullibility. For this reason, UIU operatives are to be recruited at the same tier as normal FBI agents.\n\nShould UIU obtain possession of a genuine SCP, personnel are required to contact Assistant Director ███████ at the ██████████, ██ office for retrieval and replacement with an inert substitute. The standard \"Man in Black\" concealment pattern is recommended for these scenarios, and for incidents where UIU is operating in the same theater as Foundation elements.\n\nFBI agents operating for the UIU have engaged in combat operations with Foundation Operatives and the Office For The Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts as detailed in ████████ of the Bowe Commission Reports.\n\nTo see all documents tagged with //unusual-incidents-unit//, [/system:page-tags/tag/unusual-incidents-unit click here].\n\n-----",
