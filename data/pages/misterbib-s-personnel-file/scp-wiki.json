  "content": "[[include component:image-block name=agentbibs.jpg|caption=Agent Bibs, dated ██/██/20██.]]\n\n\n**Name:** C████ Bib███████\n\n**Code Name:** \"Mister Bibs\" (\"Bibs\" in casual conversation)\n\n**Security Clearance:** 4 \n\n**Position (Primary):** Agent\n\n**Position (Secondary):** Researcher (Level 2 clearance, security authorization M1L132//.97//)\n\n**Residence:** Site-██, retrofitted Containment Room #835354 [[footnote]] ,,Despite repeated suggestions to use a standard-issue domicile, Bibs is adamant about keeping #835354 for his own. O5-█ has ordered the issue dropped, owing to the cost of having to restore #835354 to a usable state, --as well as Bib's insistence that he would [DATA EXPUNGED] if forced to relocate-- It sounds mean when you say it like that. I play my music loud, and I sing badly. Nobody would get a wink of sleep in the dormitories. Christ.,, [[/footnote]]\n\n**Pre-Foundation History:** MisterBibs's first interaction with the Foundation occurred on ██/██/20██, during an escape attempt of SCP-███. Bibs autonomously assisted Foundation personnel by [DATA REDACTED], greatly decreasing the loss of life during the recapture. Bibs explained (at considerable length) the reasoning behind his actions, citing numerous fictional stories with similar entities. Believing that he might be a valuable asset to the Foundation despite little high-end education, Bibs was not given the standard dose of Class-A amnesiacs. After being interviewed by O5-█, Bibs was recruited into the Foundation.\n\n**Profile:** With a nondescript look and bumbling, scatterbrained mannerism, Bibs excels at covert infiltration and in-the-field investigative duties. To date, he has been involved in the investigation or initial appraisal of ██ potential SCPs, with only █ detections[[footnote]],,That one in March of '██ doesn't count, for the record. I slipped.,, [[/footnote]]. Bibs describes his infiltration style as //\"James Bond meets the Second Doctor\"//, designed around appearing to potential threats as innocuous and unprepared. Personnel critical of Bib's methods argue that he //is// as unprepared as he acts, a notion that Bibs admits is \"kinda-sorta true, half the time, but that's why it works so well! That, or everyone else is dumber than me. Which is sad.\"\n\nWhen not deployed to the field as an Agent, Bibs will, if left to his own devices, wander around Foundation Sites, assisting in tasks which pique his interests. He identifies himself as \"profoundly stupid\", insisting that his skillset comes from \"having too much time on [his] hands growing up\" and over-consumption of fictional material. When confronted with moments of genuine insight or assistance, Bibs is quick to downplay it . Paradoxically, Bibs constantly seeks validation from Foundation personnel, especially from those of the senior staff and those with higher education.\n\nAfter repeated and consistent requests for access to research files during his off-hours, Bibs was given Level 2 Researcher duties on ██/██/20██.\n\n-----\n\n**SCPs Investigated**\n[[[SCP-112]]] - The Variable Coaster\n[[[SCP-440]]] - Sand-based Ecology\n[[[SCP-544]]] - The New Voice\n[[[SCP-684]]] - The Caretaken\n[[[SCP-1049-J]]] - The Grim Bucket\n[[[SCP-1923]]] - Asteroid Forest\n[[[SCP-2319]]] - Mirrored Shipwreck\n[[[SCP-4237-J]]] - Object of Indescribable Action\n\n**Orientation Logs**\n[[[Learning Shit]]]\n[[[Mystery]]]\n\n**Other Works[[footnote]] ,,Since the SysOps won't let me title this section \"Stuff I Found In The Servers At Four In The Morning That Nobody Ever Bothered To Look Though And Catalog, So Thank You, MisterBibs!\",, [[/footnote]]**\n[[[I Remember My Heroes]]]\n[[[The Improbable Bibs]]]\n[[[Shell]]]\n[[[Shortage]]]\n[[[securitycameralog |Security Camera #██████ Log ]]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dreams Despair Rage Envy Aye Mak Sicur]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ContainingCreation Containing Creation]\n[[[Triumph]]]\n\n-----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=MisterBibs]]\n=====\n> **File Name:** agentbibs.jpg\n> **Name:** agentbibs.jpg\n> **Author:** MisterBibs\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/misterbib-s-personnel-file\n\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
