Feel free to pick and choose and edit. And also [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/hotfish| Author Page]!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:acs-animation]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n\n|item-number= 9000\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= thaumiel\n|disruption-class= dark\n|risk-class= notice\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Use them.\n\n**Description:** Look with your eyes, dingus.\n-----\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-right: 5px;\"]]\n[[=image dept1.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nThe first couple of images were really just me learning how to do SCP symbols.\n[[=image dept2.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAs you can see, not very good. Just kinda eh. Nonetheless, if it happens to strike a particular authorial chord within you, feel free to use it. Plus, do note that I'm an amateur.\n[[=image dept3.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nSame with this.\n[[=image dept4.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnd then I realized you don't have to stay within the solid border! You could break out, establish your presence, and become the new normal. Such is the way of the wiki.\n[[=image dept5.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nI start experimenting, creating something newer.\n[[=image dept6.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nFrench Department. This was mostly a joke icon.\n[[=image dept7.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnd then I started taking requests. These ones are the most realistic, and inspired by prompts instead of imagination.\n[[=image dept8.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nThat's a book. Anomalous education maybe?\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"width: 50%; margin:auto; padding-left: 10px;\"]]\n[[=image dept9.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnomalous childcare. This one I would really, really enjoy if someone made it. \n[[=image dept10.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nThat's space! See, very grounded in reality. I was taking some Discord requests.\n[[=image dept11.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nThis one was inspired by Pastaphysics. Go check it out if you haven't already.\n[[=image dept12.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nFucking pattern screamers. I really, really doubt this one will ever see the light of day. I honestly don't really want to see this on the wiki any other place than this. I love me some pattern screamers, keeps the mystery alive.\n[[=image dept13.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnd back to something normal for once. Yes. On a related note, this is my single favorite icon, because it's so simple and evocative. Grodyyyy!\n[[=image dept14.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnother request.\n[[=image dept15.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnd then we're back to abstract. The departments people were asking me got really, really specific, and I couldn't handle them. Like Department of Environmental Sociology. Like, what the fuck?\n[[=image dept16.png style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\nAnd finally, my baby, Department of Atypical Persuasion. I flubbed the dimensions, so you're gonna have to deal with this as is. But this one is already in use in one of my articles, [[[SCP-6970]]]. Don't use this one unless it's DAP. This is seriously non-negotiable, do NOT use this unless it's for a DAP article.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n-----\n**Addendum:** Feel free to use this (with the exception of the last image) for whatever you want! Just make sure to plug me/my author page. Even though I have ideas on what departments these SCP symbols should be used for, they're supposed to be open ended. On that note, I made all these images in ms paint.",
