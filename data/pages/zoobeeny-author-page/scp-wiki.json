At Das Critters' deepest point lies the CritPond™. Many a brave adventurer have attempted to acquire the hidden treasure of the CritPond™ known as... ##green|The Greenlight##. Those who attempt to do so must challenge Zoobeeny to ritual combat of which there shall be only one survivor (or two in the case Zoobeeny loses).\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\nAnyways, I'm Zoobeeny. I write occasionally and crit things. Been on the wiki since 2020 and uh, yeah. That's it. I'm kinda boring. :]\n\nAnd without further ado, I present... MY STUFF! (with more stuff coming. Hopefully.)\n\n(If you're looking for my crit list, click here: [https://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/zoobeenycritlist The Crit List])\n\n[[tabview]]\n\n[[tab SCP Articles]]\n\n[[[SCP-6229]]] - Till Bonds Break\nMy first SCP article! Technically. Rewrote it several months after its original post, now with 50% more cohesive narrative! Much prouder of this version of the article than the first. The original had villains appear randomly, little characterization, and was overall less engaging than I had wanted. The rewrite has better everything, objectively. \n\n------\n\n[[[SCP-4238]]] - The Child, the Monster, and the Angel\nMy second SCP article and written in the spur of the moment (for the most part). Actually pretty happy with this one. Features a lot of physical child abuse, but not from personal experience. I just wanted to write something that had a lot of inherent darkness but still have an overall tone of hope and a rather happy ending.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Tales]]\n\n[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/in-which-catgirls-are-shot-probably In Which Catgirls Are Shot. Probably.]\nMy first ever article on the site, written and conceived in a single day, for ColdpostCon, involving a guy, several catgirls, a reality-bending neckbeard, and possibly... a gun.\nThis was written while in the middle of writing 6229 because I figured, \"instead of dealing with the social anxiety of asking for critique, let me just coldpost with permission.\" It appears it did alright, so that's a win in my book.\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show =\"Simplified Table\" hide=\"Begone Table! >:O\"]]\n[[/=]]\nTable of stuff by me, mostly for me to use :D\n\n[[module ListPages created_by=\"Zoobeeny\" order=\"rating desc\" separate=\"no\" perPage=\"250\" prependLine=\"||~ Article Name ||~ Rating ||~ Votes||~ Comments ||~ Last Comment ||~ Last Edit ||\"]]\n|| %%title_linked%% || %%rating%% || +[[#expr (%%rating%%+((%%rating_votes%%-%%rating%%)/2))]], -[[#expr ((%%rating_votes%%-%%rating%%)/2)]] || %%comments%% || %%commented_at%% || %%updated_at%% ||\n[[/module]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Zoobeeny]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
