The current instance of SCP-3692-1 is to be likewise restricted to this same chamber, along with necessary accompaniments (as detailed in Document 3692-1). There may only be one means of entrance or egress to this room, leading to an intermediary room between SCP-3692’s room and the rest of Site-██. Each week, a package of food, water, a change of simple cotton clothes, and 3 ballpoint pens are to be left in the intermediary room. The trash produced by SCP-3692-1 must be examined for pieces of SCP-3692, which are to be stored in a storage locker. This locker may only be unlocked with direct approval of Senior Researcher Rhodes. Examination and storage may only be conducted through mechanical means that do not contain a visual/electromagnetic component. All other articles of waste are to be incinerated.\n\nOn either side of this central room must be other directly adjacent chambers, each populated with a single D-Class personnel. At all times, one of these D-Class personnel must be the closest living human to SCP-3692-1; neither may be made aware of the purpose of their proximal containment to SCP-3692. Each room is to be made identical to other D-class holding cells. Every 30 days, these D-Class personnel must be rotated with two more D-Class personnel. Each day, a thorough search is to be made of these cells and of the D-Class contained within, by no less than two guards. Afterwards, these guards are to search each other thoroughly. If, during any of these searches, SCP-3692 is discovered, the personnel in possession of SCP-3692 is designated SCP-3692-1 and will replace quarters with the previous SCP-3692-1, now designated SCP-3692-2. SCP-3692-2 is to be moved to a medical unit for observation and necessary care.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3692 is a small black notebook, visually indistinguishable from a Moleskine brand classic hardcover notebook, measuring 1.2 x 21 x 12.5 cm, with 192 pages contained within. There is visible wear on the notebook - the edges of front and back cover are mildly worn, the elastic band meant to keep the book closed missing, and the included bookmark frayed at the end. The contents of SCP-3692 are not to be known.\n\nThe current person in possession of SCP-3692 (designated SCP-3692-1) will be psychologically compelled to write at least once a day in the notebook. SCP-3692-1 will express extreme distress if they are incapable of writing in SCP-3692 for whatever reason, becoming increasingly hysterical up to and through the point wherein SCP-3692-A is triggered. If SCP-3692-1 does not write in SCP-3692 for a period of 24 hours, an SCP-3692-A event is triggered. If SCP-3692-1 has been in possession of SCP-3692, and been writing daily and diligently in the notebook for an indeterminate period no longer than 192 days, a SCP-3692-A event will likewise occur. While the current owner of SCP-3692, SCP-3692-1 will experience a gradual decline in mental state, manifesting symptoms aligning with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, Bipolar Type II Disorder, Gender Dysphoria, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, among others. Prior to acquisition, this coincided with a degradation in social status and overall interpersonal likeability. No correlation has been observed between SCP-3692-1’s initial mental fortitude and the duration of its position as SCP-3692-1. SCP-3692-1 will not express particular distaste for its containment, finding SCP-3692 itself as a satisfactory pastime.\n\nSCP-3692-A events pose the primary threat to containment. During a SCP-3692-A event, SCP-3692 will disappear from its current location (usually nearby SCP-3692-1, though this effect occurs regardless of SCP-3692’s location) and appear near someone else--, the closest human that isn’t SCP-3692-1-- (see Document 3692-4). That person (now SCP-3692-1) will begin to experience the effects associated with possession of SCP-3692, and no further degradation will occur for the previous SCP-3692-1 (now SCP-3692-2). SCP-3692-2 will expire in precisely 24 hours. When an SCP-3692-A event occurs, visually-disabled D-Class personnel are permitted entrance to SCP-3692’s chamber to clean it, then searched to see if another SCP-3692-A event has occurred.\n\n**Document 3692-1:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Document 3692-1\" hide=\"- Hide Document 3692-1\"]]\n+++ The following belongings are to be set up in the room containing SCP-3692:\n\nDesk with overhead lamp\nBed\nShower with fan-drying component\nToilet with bidet\nBookcase with the following:\n\n████ ████ by ████████ ███████\n██████████████ by ████████ ████████\nThe collected works of █████████ █████████ and ██████ ███████\n█████████ by █████ ████ ██████\nAssorted works by ██████ ████████ and ███████ ███████\n\n\nDuring periods where SCP-3692-1’s room is unoccupied (i.e. immediately after SCP-3692-A), the status of each of these objects is to be noted and, if necessary, they are to be replaced.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Document 3692-4:**\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Document 3692-4\" hide=\"- Hide Document 3692-4\"]]\n+++ The following is a log of known SCP-3692-1s during the duration of SCP-3692’s containment at the Foundation.

After an initially cursory, and later more thorough investigation, the notebook in possession of █████ was narrowed down to the common thread, and further anomalies were observed that made apparent to the Foundation that SCP-3692 was, indeed, an anomalous object. In the 2 months during this investigation, ██████ mental state continuously declined, as was observed in recent grades and several psychiatric evaluations. When the Foundation repossessed SCP-3692, SCP-3692-A was immediately triggered.\n> ////\n> **Event SCP-3692-A:** At approximately the same time that Foundation researchers signed for an order to acquiesce SCP-3692, this event was triggered. Possession of SCP-3692 transferred to a low-ranking Foundation personnel, Alex ████████, who was at the time interviewing █████. It was not discovered that this event had taken place until the Foundation gave Alex orders to acquire the object.\n> ////\n> **Summary of Duration as SCP-3692-2:** Subject successfully self-terminated on ██/██/████ via [DATA EXPUNGED].\n> ////\n> //It is unecessary for the details surrounding SCP-3692-1's termination to be made visible for lower security clearances. - Senior Researcher June Rhodes//\n\n\n> **Identity of SCP-3692-1:** Alex ████████, former field agent of the Foundation.

This period was initially going to be two weeks, though an uncharacteristic decline in SCP-3692-1’s mental state, namely an obsession over “the notebook” made researchers highly reluctant to allow him back into the field.\n> ////\n> **Event SCP-3692-A:** SCP-3692-1’s remains were found on ██/██/████. After investigation, SCP-3692 was found in possession of ████████ ███, resident of the adjacent cell to SCP-3692-1.\n> ////\n> **Summary of Duration as SCP-3692-2:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n> ////\n> //Following this, we put forth a more thorough exploration of SCP-3692’s abilities and anomalous properties.

SCP 3692-2 is to be moved to a medical unit for observation and necessary care.\n\n**Description:** ##blue|SCP-3692 is a Class --V-- VI (See Addendum 3692.1)  cognitohazardous entity currently contained within a plain Moleskine brand notebook. The notebook shows signs of wear typical of a well-used notebook. It is unknown how this entity came to be contained within the notebook though this does simplify containment. Any human capable of sight is vulnerable to this entity’s possession. The “owner” of the notebook of SCP-3692 is the person currently in possession of the notebook and/or possessed by SCP-3692, and its notebook.##\n\nThe owner (designated as SCP-3692-1) will be psychologically compelled to write at least once a day in the notebook. SCP-3692-1 will express extreme distress if they are incapable of writing in SCP-3692 for whatever reason, becoming increasingly hysterical up to and through the point wherein SCP-3692-A is triggered. If SCP-3692-1 does not write in SCP-3692##blue|’s notebook## for a period of 24 hours, an SCP-3692-A event is triggered. If SCP-3692-1 has been in possession of SCP-3692##blue|’s notebook##, and been writing daily and diligently in the notebook for an indeterminate period no longer than 192 days, a SCP-3692-A event is likewise triggered. While the current “owner,” SCP-3692-1 will experience a gradual decline in mental state, manifesting symptoms aligning with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Dissociative Identity Disorder, Bipolar Type II Disorder, Gender Dysphoria, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, among others. Prior to acquisition, this coincided with a degradation in social status and overall interpersonal likeability. No correlation has been observed between SCP-3692-1’s initial mental fortitude and the duration of its position as SCP-3692-1. SCP-3692-1 will not express particular distaste for its containment, finding ##blue|the notebook## itself as a satisfactory passtime.\n\nSCP-3692-A events pose the primary threat to containment. During a SCP-3692-A event, SCP-3692 ##blue|and the notebook## will disappear from its current location (usually nearby SCP-3692-1, though this effect occurs regardless of SCP-3692’s location) and appear near someone else, the closest human that isn’t SCP-3692-1 (See Document 3692-4). That person (now SCP-3692-1) will begin to experience the effects associated with possession of SCP-3692, and no further degradation will occur for the previous SCP-3692-1 (now SCP-3692-2). SCP-3692-2 will expire in precisely 24 hours. When an SCP-3692-A event occurs, visually-disabled D-Class personnel are permitted entrance to SCP-3692’s chamber to clean it, then searched to see if another SCP-3692-A event has occurred.\n\n##blue|It appears that SCP-3692 is the original owner of the notebook, as determined through each instance of SCP-3692-1 referencing a similar character. It appears to have the ability to choose its next SCP-3692 from a pool of either a) the nearest living human capable of sight, or b) any human who has seen the contents of the notebook. Furthermore, any individual who has seen the inside of the notebook, yet is not currently an instance of SCP-3692-1, will be incapable of recalling the contents of those pages. The pages within the notebook must thus remain hidden from direct visual observation.##\n\n##blue|From secondary accounts, the interior of the notebook appears to contain more pages than it would appear, many hundreds of pages contained within the notebook. The contents of these pages is unknown, as any instance of SCP-3692-1 has refused to divulge them, claiming them to be “not for you,” or “too personal.” Update: see Addendum 3692.1##\n\n**Addendum 3692.1:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Addendum 3692.1\" hide=\"- Hide Addendum 3692.1\"]]\n+++ As of ██/██/████, SCP-3692 is to be upgraded to a class VI cognitohazard, due to revelations found in the attached interview log.\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-3692-1, Dr. Jamie Omensen, 27-year old junior researcher recently diagnosed with [DATA EXPUNGED].\n> ////\n> **Interviewer**: Dr. June Rhodes, Site-██ administrator and senior researcher of SCP-3692.\n> ////\n> **Foreword:** Dr. Omensen willfully ensured that she would be the next possessor of SCP-3692’s notebook, with the caveat that she would inform the Foundation of the notebook’s contents.

Two days later, SCP-3692-A was triggered and ownership was passed to an appropriate D-Class personnel. As SCP-3692-2, Dr. Omensen was nonresponsive to anything but the most basic physical commands, refusing eye contact or connection with Foundation personnel, including Dr. Rhodes. Dr. Rhodes also has no recollection of the contents of the last 30 seconds of that audio file before hanging up the phone, reporting hearing nothing but static. Dr. Rhodes reported acute mental stress and a mild headache at the termination of this interview, which may or may not be anomalous or simply due to the emotions involved.\n> ////\n> //It appears that information about the notebook’s contents can’t be known through audio.

Nevertheless, the room persists. Within the room are numerous pieces of A5 paper, seemingly ripped from the notebook referred to throughout the catalog of pages. The contents of these pages are not to be extensively read, as they exhibit Class Y amnestic qualities. The sole exception being those that that were found at the base of the door to the room, contained in a manila folder marked \"readme.\" This appears to be a fictional or alternate reality account of an entity referred to as \"SCP-3692\" and its interactions with reported Site-██ Director/Administrator \"June Rhodes.\" Within the entire SCP Foundation's database, we have no records of either.
