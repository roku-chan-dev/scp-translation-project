The Original\n[[*user HarryBlank]] made this image to advertise his 7k.\n\nAnd then he never did.\n\nSo I took on the burden.\n\nI have collected the 35 tweets and associated images and text I made over the course of the 7k voting period and presented them here for your viewing \"pleasure\".\n\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/JDLmCYW.jpg]]\n\n+ 1. The Shallow Fry\n> @HarryBlankSCP #scp #SCPFoundation #scp7kcontest #onguard43\nI started the process with a simple shallow fry with some glowing red wettle eyes on the side. I added some text in a childish font, some very basic conspiratorial thinking: 43 decomposes to 4 + 3, which adds to 7, which means 7k hashtag wettlesweep. I saved the JPEG with 30% to 40% compression. After all, I had 30 or more days of this.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/Rfy7vHq.jpg]]\n\n+ 2. The Deep Fry\nFor day 2, I said nothing, but saved the image at 10% compression.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/7Cm5G7W.jpg]]\n\n+ 3. Eyes of the Loser\n> every day i make it worse\nI had already added red Wettle eyes, but they had lost definition in the compression.\n\nSo I added more.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/s69fdPU.jpg]]\n\n+ 4. Crown of Chaos: teh loser\n> tehre is no escape.\n\nI honestly don't know why the face got better. Maybe I worked off of the wrong one. Not a mistake I made again.\n\nI added a star shaped thingy above his head as a crown of sorts.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/eIbS1bB.jpg]]\n\n+ 5. The Fried Crown\n> day... 5? I'm losing track.\n\nThis was not the first time time became meaningless during 7k. It would not be the last.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/47Yh9QW.jpg]]\n\n+ 6. O Canada\n> teh loser day 6\n> i added something to emphasize the canadian setting\n\nAnd what is more Canadian than a creative commons Maple Leaf SVG?\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/8aFXqeo.jpg]]\n\n+ 7. Deep Fried Maple Syrup\n> day 6 for realsies this time\n> making it worse, makin it worse\nIt was not, in fact, day 6.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/OCVKToD.jpg]]\n\n+ 8. Moose!\n> it has come to my attention that it may not have been canadian enough. Here, have a moose.\nI think the caption here is self explanatory. Yet GIMP's select by color tool is quite fickle, and so I was only able to partially remove the forest background of my moose picture.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/ppexclW.jpg]]\n\n+ 9. Beavers!\n> the people get what the people want\n[[*user bigslothonmyface]] suggested I add some beavers, so I did.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/cmNzYRB.jpg]]\n\n+ 10. By Grufugoi\n> i realized that in my efforts to make the hype posters for my favorite 7k entry, the loser, more Canadian, i had forgotten some very important information like name and title\n> I have rectified that.\nThere is a running joke where people confuse Harry Blank and Grigori Karpin. Grigori doesn't actually like it when you anglophonize his username though. Sorry Grigori. I needed to stretch out the joke.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/W0344Up.jpg]]\n\n+ 11. I mean By [[*user Grigori Karpin]]\n> pselled it wrong\nThis is the second part of the already stretched out joke, in which I spell Grigori's name right.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/yxGerL0.jpg]]\n\n+ 12. By the loser, Harry Blank\n> god i keep messing up the basics\nAfter 3 days of trying, I finally put the author on the thing correctly.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/iLAN1wc.jpg]]\n\n+ 13. Commas are important, kids.\n> this marks the 13th edit i've made i think\n> 13 indeed?\nIn this one, I crossed out the comma after \"The loser\" because it does in fact imply that Harry is the loser. This is not the case. Ignore the fact that I added the picture of Dr. Harry Blank from SCP-7000 below. Ignore it.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/GJyQ1HL.jpg]]\n\n+ 14. Pixels.\nThis was a lazy one. I just pixeled it.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/G5WYf8A.jpg]]\n\n+ 15. Lens Flair\n> it was starting to look too pixely so i tried fixing it with a blur\nAt this point, I decided to feign caring about aesthetics, which really opened up a lot of possibilities\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/qBzfpfL.jpg]]\n\n+ 16. This Loser Not That One\n> the captions were in the way so I felt like clarifying further\nUsing a tool to add text ultimately ends up being rather neat and clean, compared to drawing it haphazardly with your mouse. I decided to add Wettle back in with more clarity and to clarify that Wettle, not Dr. Blank, was The Loser.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/TQdYqDa.jpg]]\n\n+ 17. Blending In\n> day 16 8/11/2022: did some modifications for visual consistency\n\nI blurred Wettle so it was just his face. I didn't give any care to the rest of the picture.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/eOWucbS.jpg]]\n\n+ 18. Intermitted Vengeance\n> by the way, the chaos insurgency is in this one. Harry Blank doesn't advertise it with that fact, but it is.\n> though to be fair this is because harry hasn't advertised this at all\nI gave Wettle a clown collar that was the Chaos Insurgency logo.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/seIZXN0.jpg]]\n\n+ 19. Red Right Dot\n> here comes the sun doo doo doo doo\n>\n> wettlefacts:\n> 1) the red light thingy is part of the proper chaos insurgency logo and the chaos insurgency is in this one\n> 2) it also looks like a clown nose and wettle is a clown\n>\n> this is your daily dose of wettlefacts\nTo go with the collar I gave him a clown nose. I also plugged my own 7k, [[[SCP-7997]]], in the replies. It didn't really help.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/9RvAEXI.jpg]]\n\n+ 20. Bringing Beaver Back\n> it was no longer obvious this was canadian so I added a beaver pic back in\n\"Beaver\" can be slang for vagina.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/XsQUAy1.jpg]]\n\n+ 21. More Pixels More Censorship\n> lets play spot the difference\ngot lazy, just blurred it.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/lTZrex2.jpg]]\n\n+ 22. The Prettiest Wettle's Ever Been\n> i think wettle looks better this way\nSaved at 10% compression\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/aAxnWyJ.jpg]]\n\n+ 23. The Rainbow Is Not A Social Commentary\n> in order to emphasize how \"political\" (i.e. \"Canadian\") i have added the author's name in rain8ow (sorry b key 8broke)\nMy b key really was broken, but I set up a macro to type it anyways. Replaced my keyboard though!\n\nThe comment was in no way a commentary and is just a reference to how the OG43 logo is a picture of Canadian geography which is political because of uh the colonization history.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/Rbg6xwl.jpg]]\n\n+ 24. Remember, this is Canadian!\n> genuinely surprising no one has called me out on how lazy my depictions of canadianiness are\nI was honestly too lazy to try to pull the maple leaf pic again and it didn't feel right either.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/ffgIyAm.jpg]]\n\n+ 25. Moose are Canadian, right?\n> i've only seen a moose in the wild once\n> it was off the road around 30 feet\n> there were a whole bunch of tourists looking at it and taking pictures\n> or maybe the road was empty and it was sunset\n> i don't recall it was many moons ago\n> how many?\n> who knows\nComment based on a true story.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/lgtByZK.jpg]]\n\n+ 26. It has come to my attention that my understanding of Canada is superficial.\n> putting a little more effort into the canadianness , just a little\nAnd what could be more Canadian than healthcare?\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/RQZyc53.jpg]]\n\n+ 27. Now Presenting the Time After Time Password\n> did you know william wettle appears in the tale series \"the time after time password\" by [[*user HarryBlank]]\n>\n> weird right\nArt is from that tale series.\n\nHarry didn't believe that tale series got tags anymore.\n\nI proved him wrong. #time-after-time-password\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/oYdzZuj.jpg]]\n\n+ 28. Looking Sharp\n> wettle looking \"sharp\"ened\nI just used the sharpening tool and the blur tool in various measures.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/ubBAN75.jpg]]\n\n+ 29. A Pretty Watercolor\n> everyone seems \"burned out\" by 7kcon so I decided to apply a \"water color\" filter to the meme i think that is uspposed to help?\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/1R2AHrG.jpg]]\n\n+ 30. Abstraction\n> this \"filters\" things is real cool, it's like a replacement for actual artistic ability! (not a commentary on current happenings on the scp wiki)\nThis was probably a commentary on a current happening on the SCP Wiki.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/jwPINYZ.jpg]]\n\n+ 31. Oops Maple Syrup Spill\n> oops accidentally dropped some maple syrup on my dank meme.\nWhoops.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/NVgsnzU.jpg]]\n\n+ 32. Starting from the Beginning\n> sometimes you fuck up so badly it's easier to start from the beginning\nI tried undoing the maple syrup spill via filters but it didn't work so instead I put in a Wettle drawing and some basic descriptions.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/J36aUnz.jpg]]\n\n+ 33. Bringing Everything Back\n> BRINGING EVCERYTHING BACK\nSomething had been lost, something essential. So I recreated everything from all the pictures I had lying around.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/sFYU9h5.jpg]]\n\n+ 34. Dawn of a New Day\n> A GLORIOUS NEW DAY DAWNS ON CANADA!!! #ONGUARD43\nThere was one day left until results were announced.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/qCx7mxm.jpg]]\n\n+ 35. SCP-7000\n> #WETTLESWEEP\n> #WETTLESWEEP\n> #WETTLESWEEP\nAnd it was official.\n[[=image http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/wettlesweep2/NVGZbBB.jpg]]\n\n[[include
