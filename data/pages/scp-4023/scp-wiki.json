Most of these tracks resemble white noise, scratching on wall or static. When played, each track has a different anomalous effect on the listener as detailed below.\n\n**Addendum:** Most notable tracks:\n|| **Track**  || **Name** || **Effect** ||   \n|| Track 01 || \"Traitor\" || Listening to this track for longer than 10 seconds will cause the listener to abruptly lose control over their body and proceed to assault any nearby beings they previously had friendly or acquaintance relationship with. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||\n|| Track 04 || \"Snake\" || Anyone listening to this track for longer than 1 minute becomes incapable of speech and instead starts making noises similar to hissing. Effect of Track 04 is a memetic virus. Affected individuals proceed to involuntarily infect others by hearing. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||\n|| Track 07 || \"Regret\" || Subject's listening to this track will find themselves lost in their thoughts, rethinking their past decisions. Track 07 has been shown to counter the effects of Track 01. Effects lasts two hours. ||\n|| Track 10 || \"Fake Heroes\" || Individuals who listen to this track will cut all ties with their friends and associates. They will often claim that they \"have seen through their lies\". Effect lasts indefinitely. ||\n|| Track 11 || \"Sins are not forgotten\" || Listening to this track causes affected individuals to suddenly remember every wrong done to them in their life. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||\n|| Track 13 || \"Betrayal\" || The effect of Track 13 seems to be similar to the one of Track 01 but more aggressive. Counter effect from Track 07 is not effective in countering the effect of Track 13. Effect lasts indefinitely. ||\n|| Track 14 || \"Redemption\" || If any individual affected by any other track apologizes during listening to Track 14, the negative effects will disappear.

Stables of SCP-4023-5 are to be cleaned daily. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4023-5 is a herd of 13 anomalous //Equus ferus caballus//[[footnote]] Domesticated horses [[/footnote]] of various breeds. \n\nAnomalous properties of SCP-4023-5 manifest, when anyone attempts to ride one of the instances, upon which every individual in the herd turns to face the rider and starts running towards him and do not stop until they reach their destination. When all 12 horses reach the location of the rider alongside the instance that is saddled, they all merge with it into one. In this form, SCP-4023-5 is capable of reaching speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour, is more resilient and capable of being commanded telepatically by its rider. In addition, rider is also capable of ordering SCP-4023-5 to split back into individual horses with each instance removed weakening the powers of SCP-4023-5.\n\n**Addendum:** On █/██/20██ an accidental exposure of multiple simultaneous riders has shown that when SCP-4023-5 merges into one while multiple individual instances are saddled, riders also merge into one being. This state has been described by all three persons involved as confusing. It would appear that SCP-4023-5 merges bodies of its riders into one but their minds remain separate and fighting for control. Exposure concluded after 9 minutes, when one of the riders managed to order SCP-4023-5 to split, which divided the riders back into their own bodies.

SCP-4023-8 resembled a long serpent with thick scales similar to those of modern day crocodiles. Full length of SCP-4023-8 is speculated to have been around 11 metres, however the remaining skeleton after its neutralization is only 2,5 metres long.\n\nSCP-4023-8 was a Type Green reality bending anomaly, capable of small but hard to notice changes to surroundings of its prey. It would seemingly change its appearance, try to lure humans closer and devour them whole once they got close enough. However, this behaviour was observed only if the creature was hungry. SCP-4023-8 was a highly intelligent and manipulative creature capable of speech and would often interact in this way with personnel of Site-[REDACTED]. It was found that SCP-4023-8 found great pleasure in discussions with Foundation researchers and was very polite yet intrusive during interviews.\n\nAge of SCP-4023-8 is currently unknown, however it claimed to be older than humanity. Even though SCP-4023-8 was cooperative during interviews, it always tried to negotiate its release from Foundation custody or special privileges in exchange for knowledge it possessed. These exchanges were strictly forbidden by order of the O5 Council.\n\n**Addendum:** On ██/██/19██, SCP-4023-8 escaped from its cell at Site-[REDACTED] during a massive containment breach of multiple SCP objects. It was found later that this breach was caused by Agent █████ who claimed to have been persuaded to this action by SCP-4023-8.\n\n**Addendum:** 3 months after the containment breach at Site-[REDACTED], Foundation agents found the dead body of SCP-4023-8 approximately 23 kilometers from Site-[REDACTED].

You would think that after all this time, we would both get used to this. I can see from your face that you are just as uncomfortable with this as I am. But chitchat is not why I am here. It has come to my attention and to the attention of the Council, that you have been dragged into the Investigation of 4023. Now, I know that you and I share a lot of secrets Everett, and we really should have expected you being dragged into it.\n\nBut I never told you about 4023, all these secrets and I omitted this one. So let me tell you about number 23 and about its significance to the O5 Council.\n\nYes we try to keep it a secret.\n\nYes it was our mistake.\n\nAs you already know from our previous conversations, we started this foundation slowly but surely, me and my men... My loyal 12. That wasn't always the case. We discovered that 13 didn't cut it for us. 13 was a bad number, unlucky, or at least some of us believed that. Plus our organisation grew bigger by the day and some of us thought that we might need a bigger council to control it. This was the first attempt at this. Before the Administrators, before Site Directors and even Alpha-1. Before all of that we had the O6 Council.\n\nThey were supposed to be there as a support to us, taking care of the things we couldn't when there was too much work to do. In retrospective it was a horrible idea but back then it worked. Selected from people we trusted, people that were with us almost from the beginning, capable men and women. And for a while they did exactly what we expected them to do. In a sense, they helped us more at the time than we are able to admit. Without their help at the early days when we were still learning, we could have been unprepared when it came to the Insurgency many years later.\n\nAnyhow, it worked. Until the anomaly. Even back then there were many things we underestimated, you might remember some cases from my other stories. Well, we definitely underestimated number 23. It was a small anomaly, made you think the number was stalking you everywhere you go, nothing to stress about. You might get where this is going. It was passed to the O6s. I know I like to compare us today to us back then but we didn't know anything about memetic properties or cognitohazards. Turns out this was one.\n\nThe entire O6 Council got infected with a meme and started obsessing over the anomaly. Over all of them. Everything with number 23 in it. That's how we discovered many things that are still in our possession today including parts of 4023 but I'll get to that. \n\nThe poor people were relentless about it. Even tried to convince us about it. Mel kept telling me about this eldritch creature from another dimension that sends these anomalies here, that it is trying to get into our dimension using these numbers as anchors. It didn't exactly help that this was entirely possible in our lives. But we didn't see it that way. To us they all just started going crazy from overworking and coincidences.\n\nSo our relationships started to stagnate. We let them do their jobs that they still performed excellently and they stopped trying to get us on board with their theories. We should have seen it. Now I know it is our fault but I cannot help myself but blame that reptile. It was around that time when we captured something bigger. The O6 had their number but we... We obsessed over a snake. It claimed to have many secrets and was willing to give them to us. How could we not try to find out?\n\nWe tried but it never actually said anything worth noting. On the other hand, we told it everything.  For a lot of us in the Council, he became a friend. No one noticed how manipulative it was. We would talk a lot and sometimes, our conversations would shift their focus. We complained to him about the O6s and we would do it often. I am very glad that thing is dead actually. Knew me better than I did myself.\nSo for a long while we didn't have any problems with the O6 Council and we didn't care what they did as long as they did their job. Coincidentally they didn't do that anymore.\n\nAnd then they showed up on our meeting one day. Said they need help. At this point we were all angry at them for abandoning their intended purpose and they were angry at us because... Well, we didn't believe them. That evening was very unprofessional for all of us. Word exchange was fine even if vulgar at parts but the reason for cutting the meeting short was a fist fight that broke out. That was the breaking point. They begged us for help with their crazy crusade but we kicked them out of the room and out of our organisation. All that was left was the paperwork. Everyone who remained in that room settled on waiting until the next meeting.\n\nBut as it turns out, they were right. Something about the number may have driven them crazy but it was also dangerous. That evening they took off from Site-Alpha on horseback and disappeared. This opened our eyes a little and we saw the snake for what it was. By the time of another meeting we already had our minds clear but it was too late. The O6 Council was gone. Disappeared from the surface of Earth.\n\nWe all agreed that we should investigate their disappearance. We owed them at least that. And would you know it, the more we dug into it, the more number 23 appeared. We found their research and we were terrified. I cannot discuss everything but there were many anomalies and events that were corrupted by this curse. And it all led to a date. 2nd of March, 2023. I am afraid that we are approaching this date at light speed my friend and if the rest of their research is something to go by... Well, let's not worry about that. We have enough end of the world predictions as it is.\n\nOh, the research? We hid it, destroyed it alongside all the evidence of the O6 ever existing, some of us feared that even the knowledge could be affected by the number. We still don't know what exactly it is. A curse? Bad luck? An alien being? Maybe all. I hope we don't have to find out.\n\nWhat? No, we never had 23 members. The O5 Council has and always had 13 and the O6 had 9. That is 22 and I am glad it stayed that way.\n\nWhy am I telling you this? Everett, I told you many stories. Why this one? Well, the Council does not want anyone to know. Doctor Ike seems to be hitting a rock bottom with the investigation and you are the only person who can give him the information he needs. Don't worry about the Council. Yes? Let's just say that I am still regretting the decision we made all those years ago. \n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n> Thanks Mary.

The Council has performed extensive research regarding SCP-4023 and managed to discover a malicious entity in its core. The O6 Council tried to reason with their superiors at the Overseer Council about an immediate action regarding SCP-4023-18 but were denied.\n\nThe O6 Council left Site-Alpha to investigate an anomaly which turned out to be a portal leading to another dimension. It is believed that SCP-4023-18 was creating anomalies related to number 23 in our world to gain strength and enter our dimension through this portal. The O6 Council made an unanimous decision to enter the portal and attempt to close it from the other side. Their attempt was successful and caused a local temporal anomaly blocking the entry. This anomaly is currently contained as SCP-4023-14.\n\nFate of the members of the O6 Council is unknown but anomalies related to SCP-4023 found since this event are more personal in nature. Multiple related anomalies seem to reference the O5 Council, specifically blaming them for the fate of the O6. Due to this, it is believed that the O6 Council has joined with the entity.\n\n**Addendum:** Status of Investigation, SCP-4023 by Dr. Ike\n\n> I have successfully managed to tie more than enough anomalies to our theories to confirm that SCP-4023-18 is indeed real. \n> \n> SCP-4023-1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 19, 20, 21 and 22 all seem to be either products or anomalies related to SCP-4023-18.\n> \n> SCP-4023-5, 8 and Document 4023-15 are related to SCP-4023's discovery.\n> \n> However, I was unable to find any connection between SCP-4023-18, SCP-4023-7 and SCP-4023-11.
