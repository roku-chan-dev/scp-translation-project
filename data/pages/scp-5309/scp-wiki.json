You can't do anything, can you?\n\n**Unknown:** Hey, I can't get into their heads, or anything like that. So I guess this is it.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Why am I even asking you, when I //am// you?\n\n(//Berkeley shrugs.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Okay. I — I need to think.\n\n(//Berkeley thinks.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Alright. I know that whatever is written happens. So maybe if something happens, then it must also be written?\n\n**Berkeley:** But how can I make something happen?\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Well, it all began with an idea, didn't it? The idea that we don't exist.\n\n**Berkeley:** //Ideas// are able to penetrate the narrative. If I can talk to the readers, and change their ideas, then I can change my reality.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Problem is, I'm outside of the fourth wall. I'm still in the author's head, I can't do anything inside of his head. I need to be put into the narrative to do anything.\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Can't I just go back the way I came? Ideas can go up to readers. Why can't I send an idea back down?\n\n**Berkeley:** But I need them to be listening. Who would be listening, when nobody exists except for me?\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** Someone who exists as an idea inside of me.\n\n(//The chorus of \"Space Oddity\" by David Bowie is barely audible.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** //Ground control to Major Tom?//\n\n**West:**  Scarlett? How are you —\n\n**Berkeley:** //Tommy. You have to listen to me. I'm outside of the narrative.//\n\n**West:** What?\n\n**Berkeley:** //I'm outside of the narrative.//\n\n**West:** Outside //what// narrative? There's //nothing// on this side, Scarlett!\n\n**Berkeley:** //There will be. Enkidu is still there, right?//\n\n**West:** Enkidu — Enkidu.aic?\n\n**Berkeley:** //If you can think about him, that means he exists.//\n\n**West:** Umm — okay. What about Enkidu?\n\n**Berkeley:** //Listen to me very carefully, Tommy.//\n\n**West:** Of course, sunshine.\n\n(//Berkeley takes a deep breath.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** //I'm stuck as an idea within the author's head, but I know a way to come back.//\n\n(//Berkeley pauses.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** //Tommy. You're going to pull me back in, and I'm going to be dead again.//\n\n**West:** What?\n\n**Berkeley:** //I'm going to die, Tommy, just like last time. But I need to die for this to work.//\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**West:** You don't have to die, Scarlett. Let's think about this.\n\n**Berkeley:** //I have to come back.//\n\n**West:** Then come back! I can just pull you back in.\n\n**Berkeley:** //Pull me back into what?//\n\n**West:** I don't know. Where I am —\n\n**Berkeley:** //You're nowhere, Tommy. You're in me, and I'm outside of existence.//\n\n(//Silence.//)\n\n**Berkeley:** //Pull me back in, and make sure Enkidu is ready for the transfer.//\n\n**West:** — what are you going to do?\n\n**Berkeley:** //Ask the readers to change their minds.//\n\n[END LOG]\n[[/div]]\n[[include component:colend]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n###5b2f8e|Sisyphus.sic, synthetic intelligence construct, at your service.
