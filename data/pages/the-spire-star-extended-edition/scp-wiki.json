Some were forgotten and lost to time, while others managed to preserve their existence and left their impact on the world in ways which can never be undone. Although humans have had the most cultures and some of the most powerful empires throughout history, many other intelligent beings have also walked the Earth for countless millennia. Among these many beings were the Fae, the Fairies, the Fair Folk, the Star Gazers, or Children of the Forest.\n\nOver time, the Fae gave rise to one of the most infamous empires upon the face of the Earth. This empire lived on for several thousand years, and once even controlled the entire world in a grip of wonder and fear. This was during a time when magic was widespread, and when gods and deities influenced the fate of the world and its inhabitants, as well as a time when [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/poczatki-normalnosci-i-jej-przyszlosc the concept of normalcy yet to suffocate the world for more than a century]. The empire spread its influence across the lands and seas of the ancient world, and went on to absorb or destroy the many neighboring settlements through alignment or enslavement. This empire was responsible for countless incredible achievements and historical events, both good and bad, while under the rule of its twin demigod queens, the wicked Undoer Mab and her more compassionate sister the Inventor.\n\nWhile this article includes some information from official sources and historical documents, let it be known that much information regarding the Fae Empire is vague due to being lost to time. Historians and writers have worked together to extrapolate as much of the available history as possible and combined that with poetic license in order to develop this potential scenario of Fae history.\n\nIt is widely believed that the Fae Empire was largely built on major cultural norms, philosophical ideals, governmental power, and architectural traditions throughout the years. For example, their early architectural style was brutalist in nature, and included simplistic yet monumental and imposing towers and palaces. The aristocratic and mabbites were granted the most luxury and privileges. The people followed the wills of the twin queens. Despite these norms, the Empire was formed of many settlements and cities, each having their own customs, cultures, and peoples. Of all these kingdoms and villages, there existed six city-states which were the prime powers of the Empire. They were the most glorious and influential of all the lands over which the Empire ruled.\n\nThese six cities were known as the Spire Star. It is believed that many forms of Fae existed throughout the Empire and still exist today, and the six cities served as the capital and the core home to a specific group of Fae people. Even with the Empire’s demise, these cities left an influence on both the world and the Fae which withstood the tides of time. Then came a time when the world learned that these cities were not as lost as many had believed.\n\nThus begins a deep look into the many secrets of the Spire Star of the Fae Empire.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/the-spire-star-extended-edition/Arlende%20Emblem.png style=\"width: 450px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 450%;\"]]**Arlende**[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]](ahr-lahn-deh)[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]]The Velvet Spire, The Heart[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nAs the title implies, the city of Arlende was the heart of the Spire Star. It was the supreme capital which ruled over the entirety of the Fae Empire. It was from this city the seed of the Empire was planted, and blossomed and spread its roots throughout many lands of ages long gone. It is here the palace of the twin queens was located. They would watch over their kingdom from the many turrets and steeples surrounding the megalithic structure. The ancient gods were brought here before the queens to pledge their allegiance to their new rulers, or forfeit their lives. Those who were loyal became members of the courts of the two queens.\n\nArlende’s legend and influence actually extends centuries earlier than the rise of the Empire and the birth of the twin queens. Arlende was built many thousands of years prior, as it was the first home of the Fae [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-enlightened-children founded during the time of the ancient Sky Keeper dragons known as the Age of Tranquility]. It was once a docile and spiritual kingdom which lived harmoniously amongst the lush beauty of the tranquil forests and beautiful meadows, within which it was located. Arlende had been the home of the twin queens since their births, as both were born within its very walls. However, once Mab rose to power, she warped the once peaceful and benevolent kingdom into a monolithic and imperial capital. This capital then ruled over all the Empire.\n\nAs the Empire capital, Arlende was believed to be the largest and wealthiest of the six cities. It was the home of the common Sidhe Fae (//Homo Sapiens Sidhe//) within the Empire. Arlende was seen as a city that was both beautiful, yet intimidating. Its many spire tipped blackstone towers were lined with the purest irrilite and silver. Those viewing the imposing structures from the ground would be overwhelmed by the illusion that the towers stretched up to above the heavens, a sight that was both breathtaking and terrifying. It was also a city of wealth, power, and pride. The affluent held great power, and the commoners usually resided in the slums and trenches of the city. While the higher class showered themselves in pleasure, festivity, and all the finest Arlendian attire the city had to offer, the commoners were mistreated and abused, often enslaved simply for being poor. It was also infamous for the widespread practice of slavery through captured Humans and Yeren. These slaves were often either kept as pets to be used as personal servants, or manual labor for the more hazardous of tasks.\n\nOne theory regarding the start of the Empire’s fall, is that the cruel mistreatment of the commoners was the genesis of the Inventor gaining the courage to stand up against her sister. This act would lead to the civil war which would result in the downfall of the Fae Empire. However, many even to this day contradict this theory as propaganda by Inventor sympathizers. While it is true that the Inventor was a tyrant much like her sister, documents and official sources state that the Inventor was more compassionate and had more noble ideals. Experts in the field of alternate histories hypothesized that if the Inventor survived her battle with Mab, she would have reformed the Fae Empire by outlawing its more oppressive and prejudicial practices. Whatever the reason, it was the Inventor who sparked the beginning of the Civil War that would lead to the First Diaspora. Ironically, the most destructive battle of the civil war would take place in Arlende, the very city where such abuse was most common. Despite all its wealth and power, the city could do nothing to prevent the catastrophic event which would lead to the fall of the city and Mab’s ultimate destruction.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOf all the cities of the Spire Star, Arlende was the only one which was completely destroyed during the ruination of the Empire. This was shortly after both queens fell in their legendary battle. Despite this, it still serves as a reminder of the cruelty of both the Undoer Mab and the Empire as a whole. Although the city was destroyed, what became of the remains is something of a mystery. The collected theories over the decades, and historical information received from the now dissolved SCP Foundation, combine to form the belief that the Third Diaspora took place where the ruins of Arlende once stood.

The people of Brasilveen were the Elves (//Sidhe Tumuli//). A center of knowledge and learning, Brasilveen was home to the Empire’s finest libraries and institutions, opened to those seeking to uncover the many mysteries of existence and the untapped potential of the thaumaturgic arts. The city was fraught with observatories, archives, universities, and museums. The many white marbled medieval styled buildings were decorated with fine gold, and featured ornate tapestries hanging from the outside ridges or the inner halls. Many referred to Brasilveen as the mind of the Empire, as it always put logic and reasoning before impulse.\n\nIt is a common fact that the Fae were genetically linked to humans, as they are considered a cousin species much like the Yeren and Fin-Folk. The Elves were the sub-species which resembled humans more than any other species of Fae in existence. While they retained the standard pointed ears and large shiny black eyes, they completely lacked the ethereal wings of their other fellow Fae, and had human-like skin colors, ranging from the palest of pale to the darkest ebony, and all of the tones and hues in between. Despite being more physically similar to humans, the Elves were still as naturally gifted in thaumaturgy as the rest of their fellow Fae brothers and sisters. The Elves often donned themselves in cloaks of pure silk embroidered in gold and colored threads. They often adorned their heads with laurel leaf crowns or gold chained circlets.\n\nIt is believed that Brasilveen was governed by a royal court composed of trusted sorcerers and wizards, led under a noble monarchy. The first rulers of Brasilveen were thought to be the monarchs Nemed and Danu Airgetlám, legendary ancestors of the late Nuada Airgetlám VII. Both King Nemed and Queen Danu were well known members of the Seelie Court of the Inventor. As such, the city of Brasilveen followed the Inventor, rather than her sister Mab. Therefore, when the civil war erupted, the people of Brasilveen immediately sided with the Inventor. They desired to avenge the possible murder of Oberon, one of the many lovers of the Inventor.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nBrasilveen managed to preserve its way of life long after the fall of the Empire. Unfortunately, the shape warping people of Fomor could not forget the many years of conflicts between themselves and the Elves, brought forth by Mab and her monstrous general Nessilatha. It is believed that many battles and conflicts between the two peoples continued for many centuries, and caused great damage and destruction to Brasilveen. Ambushes and assassinations befell many of the peoples and nobles of the city. Eventually, after one final bloody clash at the summit of the Sliabh an Iarainn, the Elves stood victorious. However, despite the many years of bloodshed between them, the Elves decided to spare their enemies in the end and let them live. They did not wish to make the same mistakes committed by the Empire because of Mab’s influence, therefore they felt genocide was not the answer and showed mercy. Thus, the war ended, but the damage caused to Brasilveen was devastating.\n\nThe final fate of Brasilveen after the wars end is at this moment unsured of, as official evidence has yet to be found. The most widely believed theory is that after the war, the citizens of Brasilveen would scatter and go on to find the five Fae kingdoms of the Arthurian Charter, such as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/finding-avalon the kingdom of Avalon]. This theory states that one portion of the inhabitants chose to stay and would go on to rebuild Brasilveen, a process that would be completed during the 14th century. Feeling their home had been reborn from the ashes of the old, the Elves chose to rename Brasilveen to Hy-Brasil. Over time Hy-Brasil would go on to become a thriving settlement of knowledge and sorcery. It became a monolith of Fae culture and housed one of the largest Fae populations in history. Unfortunately, past enemies of the Empire would soon return to seek vengeance. The terrible Nessilatha, now warped and mutated into the terrifying creature scientifically known as //Crocoteuthis gigantis//, rose from the ocean and decimated the city of Hy-Brasil. Eventually the beast was destroyed by a Thaumonuclear bomb brought down by the GOC, but it also completely decimated the city in the process.\n\nFor many decades, Hy-Brasil was left a pitiful shell of its former self and was sparsely populated. Many attempts were made to restore the metropolis, but it was a painstakingly difficult process, especially when the Veil was still held high. The lack of available natural resources greatly inhibited rebuilding efforts. The community sent scouts far and wide outside Hy-Brasil to locate and gather materials suitable for rebuilding. These scouts also endeavored to seek out skilled artisans outside Hy-Brasil within the veiled community willing to assist in the reconstruction.\n\nDuring the initial rebuilding stages, life was difficult and the citizens choosing to remain in Hy-Brasil during that time suffered many hardships and a poor quality of life. However, the Elves were incredibly devoted and patient, and many were determined not to abandon the city they called home for generations. Those who did feel the need to move away, only did so knowing they would one day return. However, with the fall of the Veil around the early 2020’s, the reconstruction process greatly increased. There have been many positive reports received from on-site members of the Manna Charitable Foundation, and the Fae supporters from Esterberg and other Free Ports. If these positive reports continue, it’s likely that Hy-Brasil may once again rise from the ashes.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/the-spire-star-extended-edition/Yefshara%20Emblem.png style=\"width: 450px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 450%;\"]]**Yefshara**[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]](yef-shär-ah)[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]]The Sapphire Spire, The Sea Hub[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nPerched on the surface of a sheet of ice over a frozen sea, [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/morskie-opowiesci directly above a massive and bottomless trench], Yefshara was believed to be the center of pleasure and luxury within the Empire. A resort city rich in relaxation and entertainment of all forms, enjoyed by many travelers who wished to bask in ecstasy and amusement. Its tall domed towers were held high by marble columns enameled in gold and rich lapis. Elegant docks of hand carved mahogany etched with bronze, and plazas adorned in theatrical stages where many would perform and cater to the masses. Entertainment and pleasures of all forms could be found on every city street, everything from taverns, brothels, spas, and gambling houses. Yefshara was also known for having the loveliest beach in the Empire. Many lovers would stay for long hours perched upon the sand to witness the majestic sunsets. While Yefshara provided the pleasures of the body and liquor, it also provided opportunities to bask in the pleasure of battle. From soldiers to gladiators, many warriors across the Empire would travel to Yefshara to satisfy their lust for battle and conquest. Tournaments and duels were held in a massive colosseum at the peak of the city for the enjoyment of both spectators and competitors. Many of the Fae Empire’s greatest warriors fought, triumphed, and fell in glorious battle within its arena. Even Mab herself would find the time to visit Yefshara, both to witness these battles, and to visit the head ruler of the city, one of her own daughters.\n\nThe people of Yefshara were the epitome of what you would expect to find in a city that thrived in pleasure and entertainment. The proud Undine (//Sidhe Naiad//), also known as the Undyin, were known for living off the thrill of battle and the fruits of luxury. Naturally more muscular than other species of Fae, they possessed a bluish hue to their skin. They wore tunics and kilts, often adorned with leather straps, animal pelts or chainmail and irrilite armor plating. Many great warriors and guards of the twin queens were Undine men and women who pledged themselves to the mother of their city’s ruler. Undine women were willing to join their fellow men in the arenas and battlefields, but they were also not afraid to display their beauty through the art of exotic dancing. Many of the finest dancers of the Empire could be found within Yefshara, in their many brothels and on the streets for the masses to witness.\n\nWith Yefshara being under the rule of her daughter, most of its people sided with Mab when the civil war erupted between the Undoer and the Inventor. This led to Yefshara being targeted by the armies and followers of the Inventor, and caused much of the city to become a battlefield with bloodshed within its streets. However, the Undine were experienced in battle, thus they were able to repel many of the sieges laid upon it. It seemed Yefshara would survive the war nearly unscathed, but that would not come to be. It is said that ultimately, as a result of the damage and destruction brought on by invaders, the ice sheet that Yefshara stood upon slowly melted until finally shattering, sinking into the waters below, taking the city with it. Many who witnessed the devastating defeat went on to document the event. They claimed to witnessing the city being surrounded and engulfed within a massive bubble of light and energy before finally sinking deep into the great depths of the ocean.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOnce thought to have been destroyed and lost forever, it wasn’t until 2010 that the SCP Foundation uncovered the truth of Yefshara’s fate. As a result of its queen’s natural thaumaturgical aptitude that she inherited from her mother, the city was able to survive its destruction through preserving spells and an impenetrable light barrier. After sinking to the deepest depths of the trench it once stood above, Yefshara and its people were able to survive and adapt to their new life beneath the waves, through thaumaturgic evolution by their queen to be more suited for their new aquatic subterranean environment. Although she was unable to successfully accelerate the evolution of the entire population, and many perished in the process. They grew gills, their wings warped into fins, and their skin becoming transparent and changing from a pale blue to a vibrant green, which also made their muscular physiques appear smaller than they supposedly were. One interesting side effect of their rapid evolution was the display of their emotions and intentions through their nervous systems. They would glow in a variety of colors based on their internal feeling. Due to this characteristic, the concept of lies no longer existed in their society because their intentions and feelings are always on display and cannot be hidden, thus making it impossible to lie. The only exception to this is their queen who was not affected in this way through rapid evolution. Life in Yefshara continued and it became an underwater metropolis. For many generations the city continued to bask in the luxuries it provided itself, even if no one on the surface could join in the luxury, including the Undine still living above who were not present when the city sank.\n\nHowever, many generations isolated beneath the waves would have an unfortunate effect on Yefshara and its people. Over time as the centuries turned into millenia, the people of Yefshara slowly began to lose portions of their history and memories of their prior way of life on the surface, to the point where even the name of the city and its queen started to fade. Eventually however, Nordic Vikings led by one Lugos One-Eye accidentally discovered the underwater city and found themselves conversing and feasting with its inhabitants. These Vikings believed they had found themselves within the realm of Niflheim and that its queen was in fact Hel, daughter of Loki the God of Mischief. The meeting with Lugos and his companions greatly influenced the underwater city, with the queen even taking on the title of Hel and renaming the city Niflheim. These Vikings would be the last interaction the Trench Fae had with humans until many centuries later, when on [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/10-kwietnia-2010 April 10, 2010], the Foundation discovered the Baltic Trench and eventually stumbled upon the underwater city. This would lead to the Foundation forming a partnership with the newly dubbed Niflheim, and their involvement in the event referred to as Ragnarök.\n\nDuring the end of the Veil, Yefshara had been recognized as a nexus by the rest of the anomalous community. While the city retained many of the aspects that made itself known as a luxury city, it went on to incorporate numerous Nordic Viking cultural traits. It is a well-known concept to many that the power of belief is immensely great, it can alter the very state of the universe itself, resulting in the birth of deific entities and magnificent realms beyond imagination. Because the Baltic Fae of Yefshara truly believed their home was the realm of Niflheim, the power of belief caused the city to morph into a physical afterlife on Earth, reminiscent of the aforementioned Nordic realm of myth. This also led to the queen of Niflheim becoming the same Hel mentioned in said myth. For those who believed in both Hel and Norse mythology, their souls would traverse to the nexus when they died, but not from battle, as stated in Nordic myth with the concept of Valhalla.\n\nThese days, while visitors are permitted to enter Yefshara, they must adhere to strict guidelines. They must follow along with the belief they are indeed in the realm of Niflheim. This is to preserve the stability of the afterlife that many spirits now inhabit alongside the Fae natives. While acting as an independent community, the city has an agreement with Vanguard that they will support one another by sharing information and resources when necessary. Despite this agreement, there have been incidents where hostile forces and groups have attempted to destroy the city. Most of these were unsuccessful. Today, the Niflheim turned nexus of Yefshara, stands as an example of how old world human and Fae cultures and beliefs can sometimes merge and create something truly unique and otherworldly beautiful.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/the-spire-star-extended-edition/Fernafaun%20Emblem.png style=\"width: 450px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 450%;\"]]**Fernafaun**[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]](fern-ah-faun)[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]]The Emerald Spire, Gaia’s Meadow[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nIt is believed when the Fae were first born, they emerged from the vast forests within the bundles of nature’s gifts from Gaia. This belief was most embraced by Fernafaun, located upon the Emerald Isles. Of the six cities of the Spire Star, Fernafaun was considered the most unique. They chose to embrace and live amongst nature and all the riches the lush lands could provide, becoming one with the environment. They so cherished nature that they dared not damage any foliage in order to prosper or create their structures. Instead, they mastered the art of chloromancy. This entailed manipulating and commanding the very greenery of nature. While their mastery of plant manipulation was not as profound and defined as that of the Yeren’s bio-organic engineering, it was still a sight to witness. All the structures and architecture of Fernafaun were naturally grown. Massive trees and fungi grew to be hollow within, and took the shapes of houses and towers. Bridges were created from vines and lily pads, and massive luminescent flower bulbs served as lanterns. A natural ecological paradise, much of the most exotic foliage and fauna could be found throughout Fernafaun.\n\nThe city of Fernafaun cherished their homelands and worked hard to ensure natural beauty in their surroundings. They utilized the finest greenhouses and farms to raise and nurture both the plant and animal life within. This lifestyle made Fernafaun the primary source of resources needed to preserve the Empire’s prosperity, leading to them hosting the largest farmer’s market within the empire. Most homes of families boasted lush gardens and shared their homes with a variety of animals which were regarded as their companions rather than pets. \n\nThe inhabitants of Fernafaun were often regarded as the most unique species of Fae. They were the Dryads and Sprites (//Sidhe Norn Napaea//) and were given the title of Gaia’s Caretakers. Though having two distinctive names, the Dryads and Sprites were the same species on a genetic level, the aspect of nature they embraced is what determined if they were Dryads or Sprites. The Dryads embraced flora and the sprites embraced fauna, this difference was revealed a year after birth with a cultural ceremony. At that time infants were presented with two baskets, one filled with flowers and the other holding an animal cub. If they chose the flower basket they were deemed a Dryad, and if they chose the cub basket they were a Sprite. By the age of four, they would develop the physical and biological characteristics of the natural aspect they had chosen.\n\nDryads skin resembles wood, fungi or pome fruit and have soft vines or leaves for hair, or a large flower growing on the top of their heads. Their wings resemble leaves or flower petals. Because of these botanical traits, Dryads inherited various genetic abilities of plant life. Though consuming food still provides them with nutrients, they can survive almost entirely on water. They possess an immunity to all forms of natural poisons and can identify whether a plant or fruit is poisonous through gustation (taste) and olfaction (smell). They are capable of performing photosynthesis and gather nutrients from sunlight. Having botanical traits also has their setbacks however. Dryads cannot survive in environments with extreme temperatures such as deserts or polar regions without the necessary protection to survive. The botanical features of their bodies makes them highly flammable. They can also be harmed by anything detrimental to botany like termites, locusts, pollution, hazardous chemicals and smoke. Despite the limitations, being partially botanical grants the Dryads incredible abilities. They can communicate with any form of flora, and can use their chlorokinetic abilities to manipulate, enchant, and heal botany. They are prodigies in the field of horticulture, such as easily being able to determine what fields have the best soil for providing rich nutrient. They wore clothing made entirely from botanical material which, through thaumaturgy, were incapable of deteriorating.\n\nSprites develop the characteristics of any animal on Earth. Such examples include having fur coats, tails, fuzzy ears, antlers, tiger stripes, whiskers, scales, forked tongues, avian wings, or the legs of goats. Sprites also develop the same abilities as wildlife such as heightened hearing and smell, night vision, climbing, running, digging, and swimming. But much like Dryads, the Sprites’ transformations also have their setbacks. Sprites with fur, feathers or scale can shed. They can develop negative behavioral animal traits, like a feline’s fear of water. Finally, much like natural wildlife, Sprites can go through heat cycles once they mature. They maintain a symbiotic relationship with the wildlife of Earth through studying zoology and teaching the animals thaumaturgy. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2952 This leads to them creating animals with unusual abilities]. Sprites traditionally seek and befriend any form of animals, many who would become their companion, familiar, or steed. Sprites have also mastered the ability to shrink themselves so they could interact with smaller animal life, such as squirrels, mice, or [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2323 birds]. Sprites manufacture their clothing from the wool, silk, leather, and fur they have harvested from the numerous livestock they herd.\n\nDespite having different appearances, Dryads and Sprites are the same species of Fae and can be married to each other. Fernafaun works under a government system similar to a meritocracy. The city is under the guidance of an elected group comprised of the most respected and talented individuals in the city, with the elected head leader being known as the Grand Meadow-Keeper. Despite having an elected body, Fernafaun’s welfare is a shared responsibility. By each member sharing their own skills with all the citizens, everyone benefits. For example, the farmers share their food, the builders share their talents, the caregivers and the healers ensure the well-being of all, and the leaders always work towards the best interest of the citizens.\n\nWhen the civil war erupted within the Empire, Fernafaun did not take up arms in the conflict. Instead, they chose to support by providing the supplies to the armies such as food rations and medical supplies. Surprisingly, Fernafaun provided supplies to both the armies of Mab and the armies of the Inventor. While they too had hatred towards Mab and her followers for their mistreatment of the commoners, they knew that supporting her sister alone would lead Mab’s forces to target Fernafaun as well, so they chose to stand as a neutral party throughout the war. Despite this neutrality however, they secretly prayed for the Inventor’s victory.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOf all the cities of the Spire Star, only Fernafaun survived the war unscathed. It is believed this is because the city’s love for nature became so pure and limitless, that Gaia herself chose to take in the city as a part of herself. She embraced Fernafaun and fused it with the very essence of nature itself. In simpler terms, Fernafaun’s love of nature led to it being transferred into a pocket dimension of its own creation, the primary entrance way to which is located upon the Hill of Tara in modern day Meath. Four secondary entrances to Fernafaun’s informal districts directly linked to faeiry forts within Ireland. The city continued to thrive even after the fall of the Empire, much like its neighboring city of Brasilveen. Fernafaun did not choose to keep itself confined to its dimension however, as eventually they would go on to explore the outside world several millennia later. This led to their encounters with the Celtic communities as early as 11th Century BCE, which was the earliest traces of human inhabitation in Ireland. It is believed that Fernafaun and the city of Hy-Brasil may be the roots of the many myths and legend of Fair Folk in Irish and Celtic folklore. These interactions also influenced Fernafaun, as the Grand Meadow-Keeper and the four major members of the Fernafaun council would go on to incorporate traits reminiscent of the province crests of Ireland. However, their interactions with these communities would come to an end when William the Conqueror led the Invasion of Ireland in 1169. At the time Fernafaun attempted to help the natives fight off the Normans. These efforts inevitably failed and Fernafaun was left in horrid shape. Having sustained property and life losses, they secluded themselves to recover and rebuild. For almost three hundred years nary a soul entered or departed the city. In the early 1500’s Fernafaun’s people had recovered and felt confident enough to begin interacting with the natives again.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until the establishment of Her Majesty's Foundation for the Secure Containment of the Paranormal (HMFSCP) by Oliver [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8120 Hadfield] after the Fifth Occult War that the people of Fernafaun would once again be forced back into their pocket dimension. They eventually found themselves in conflict with the French Estate noir, due to the brutal and segregationistic ideals of the HMFSCP which Fernafaun viewed as tyrannical. Unfortunately, the Dryads and Sprites of Fernafaun were no match for the ruthless capabilities of the HMFSCP and its forces. This eventually forced them to seclude themselves within their home city in fear of the threat of genocide. After centuries of hiding, they decided they would never let any groups related to the United Kingdoms or HMFSCP within the boundaries of the city again.\n\nThe city of Fernafaun would not come out of its seclusion until sometime in 1923, as a result of commotion caused by the IRA (Irish Republican Army), who eventually found a way to enter Fernafaun. Fortunately, direct fighting was kept out due to the respect they showed the Fae for their hospitality during the unrest. It was thanks to this interaction Fernafaun discovered that the threat of the HMFSCP was no longer present, and thus they were once again free to roam the outside world. However, upon learning of the existence of the Veil, they acted much more carefully when traversing outside the city. This cautious traversal prevented the Foundation from discovering Fernafaun until the late 20th century via knowledge obtained from the city of Hy-Brasil. Unfortunately, this knowledge was soon lost due to their on-site facility being destroyed along with the city. The Foundation wouldn’t rediscover Fernafaun until late 2013, when they also made their first contact with the inhabitants. At the time Fernafaun agreed to establish a diplomacy with the SCP Foundation, and eventually granted them permission to build a facility, Site-32, within the city to aid in their operations within Ireland.\n\nAfter the end of the Veil, Fernafaun had become a popular tourist location within Ireland, and a place of intense interest to botanists and zoologists around the world. Their teachings of chlorokinetic thaumaturgy and fellow Dryad volunteers have even led to the successful restoration of many barren and degraded natural landscapes due to deforestation and pollution exposure. The assistance of the Sprites of Fernafaun, and their ways of developing symbiotic relationships with wildlife, has also led to the rescue and preservation of several endangered species of wildlife, especially those which previously were nearly brought to extinction.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/the-spire-star-extended-edition/Neonachlar%20Emblem.png style=\"width: 450px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 450%;\"]]**Neonachlar**[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]](neo-nuh-clar)[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]]The Opal Spire, The Star Valley[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nLocated along the western boundaries of the Empire was the city of stars, Neonachlar. Secluded within a vast forest filled valley, Neonachlar was a city whose magnificence was not fully revealed until after dusk. Known as the star valley, the city was famous for having the most beautiful view of the night sky within all of the Empire. It resembled a sparkling ocean filled with diamonds. Neonachlar and its people held a deep love and appreciation for the stars, and built their very way of life and culture around them. The city itself was perched directly above the vast trees which spanned across the valley, so the night sky would always be visible. All the buildings of Neonachlar were glamorous towers built of platinum and mahogany, or immense ornate treehouses. The rooftops of every building were composed of a highly durable unique crystal material. These crystals appeared an opaque black when exposed to sunlight, but as night fell, they became as transparent as glass, so the stars were always in view. The streets of Neonachlar were similar to suspension bridges and tree top walkways, each interconnecting every structure within the city. Plazas and parks were large elevated platforms throughout the city. Buildings were often decorated with luminescent star shaped crystals which would glow a warm gold or enchanting emerald color during the night, making the city glisten like the stars above.\n\nThe people of Neonachlar were known as the Pùca (//Sidhe Stellaris//), but were commonly referred to as Pixies. The pixies were regarded as the most unusual species of Fae. Pixies resembled the Sidhe Fae, although they had six small eyes which were arranged vertically with two in the middle, two on top, and two at the bottom. They were much shorter than all other species of Fae. Their skin was mint green, their hair multicolored and vibrant, and their ethereal wings were like that of a dragonfly rather than a butterfly. The pixies were well known for being master craftsmen and manufacturers. Whether it be glassblowing, blacksmithing, woodworking, ceramics, jewelry, or sewing, the Pixies were regarded as the best in such fields. Establishments such as workshops or ceramics shops were common within the city. They generally designed their craft items themed around the stars, however they were always willing to honor any special items requested by nobles or the Empire courts. The attire of Neonachlar was described as regal, flowy, exotic and vibrant in design.\n\nThe Pixies viewed the stars as sacred and tied to the existence of the Fae themselves. While some believed that the Fae were born from the forests by Gaia’s hands, the Pixies believed the Fae were born from the stars, crafted from starlight and the ethereal threads of the universe by a long-lost goddess of stars and dreams. The true name of the goddess was lost to time, but the Pixies have come to call her the Star Mother. This belief would, over time, be expanded upon by many, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/fae-myths-and-legends forming a religion that is worshipped even to this day].\n\nThey believed one day this lost goddess would return, and bring them to a paradise of starlight and miracles, where they could bask in the beauty of the stars for all eternity. Not much about the Star Mother is known, as most knowledge of this deity was lost long before the time of the Empire. However, one aspect that has remained was that a fragment of the Star Mother broke off long ago and took the form of a red shooting star. This red star would soar through the night sky once every six years during a new moon. Every six years the Pixies would hold a grand festival in celebration of this star, and the deity they believed it to be born from. They called this festival the Symphony of Starlight. They celebrated the goddess through joyful dancing, dramatic reenactments, musical performances, selling their best crafts and offering the finest delicacies to the many participants. Many have claimed the most glamorous spectacle of the festival to be the royal duet between the Mistress of Heavenly Glamour, matriarch of Neonachlar, and her daughter, the Princess of Wishful Desires. For this event, the two performed a mesmerizingly beautiful and exotic ceremonial dance together in front of a large Irrilite statue depicting one of the many forms of the Star Mother.\n\nDark times came later for Neonachlar when civil war erupted throughout the Empire. Despite the Mistress of Heavenly Glamour being a member of the Unseelie Court of Mab, she was one of the lovers of the Inventor. She thus secretly opposed Mab and desired to abandon her seat to be among the members of the Inventor’s Seelie Court. When the civil war began, she was forcibly ordered by Mab to have the many smiths of Neonachlar produce weaponry for her forces. However, she also did everything she could to assist the Inventor, such as offering weapon supplies, and leaking both war plans and secrets to the Inventor herself. Unfortunately, it wouldn’t be long before Mab became aware of this defiance and eventually caught the Mistress in the act. Enraged, she sentenced the Mistress to death and summoned her royal guards to slay the matriarch. But whether through sheer luck, or divine protection from the Star Mother, the Mistress of Heavenly Glamour narrowly managed to escape with her life. She wasted no time in returning to Neonachlar, knowing full well that Mab would seize her forces upon the city for their deviance. However, it is believed that the matriarch had a plan to ensure the survival of her home and her people. When night fell and the forces of Mab finally came upon the valley of Neonachlar, many Pixie warriors, along with support from the armies of the Inventor, awaited them. They would hold off the followers of Mab long enough to buy time for the Mistress of Heavenly Glamour to enact her plan and save their home. As the hours passed, and the battle continued to rage on, Mab’s forces were starting to push back the retaliating army. Hope was starting to dwindle for the defenders of Neonachlar.\n\nWhat occurred next is not entirely certain due to the passage of time, but legends tell us it was at this moment that a great beam of red light came down from the sky, and the city of Neonachlar was engulfed in a wave of starlight. When the light finally faded, Neonachlar had vanished, leaving only a few structures and crumbling bridges behind. Believing this was an act of their queen, the forces of Mab ceased their clash with their foes and withdrew from the battlefield. They returned to Arlende to defend its walls, under the impression that they were victorious. However, upon disappearing from the horizon, the Pixie warriors roared in delight and triumphed, for it was they who were victorious in the end. What Mab did not realize was that the night of the battle for Neonachlar marked the end of the six year wait for the return of the red star of the Star Mother. As the battle raged on, the Mistress of Heavenly Glamour along with her daughter and the many citizens of the city, prayed to their goddess. They prayed she would deliver them from the chaotic war and spare them from the fires of Mab’s rage. In the end, the red star burst forth with great light, as it answered their prayers.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOver the millennia, the fate of Neonachlar has always been unclear in history. However, the pixies that were not present within the city when it vanished, and those in modern times knew what happened to Neonachlar, as it has been kept a secret among their people for generations. A birthright that was bestowed upon them, where all newborn Pixies would possess the knowledge of Neonachlar and its fate embedded within their memories.\n\nAs previously stated, the power of belief can alter the very state of reality itself if it was strong enough. Many deities and concepts exist merely because the power of belief brought them into existence, and that can lead to miracles becoming a reality. That is the case with Neonachlar. There may have been a time when the red star was a simple comet soaring through space, but because of the power of belief, that star may have indeed become a part of the Star Mother, and thus it answered the prayers of the Pixies by fulfilling what they have always prophesied within their religion of stars. When Neonachlar was engulfed in light, it and its inhabitants were in fact transported to another reality, [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/oneiroi one that is forged from the very essence of dreams and the imagination]. The city had found itself in a reality where not only could they forge creations from their very dreams, but they were now always above a sky that was forever filled with beautiful stars. By believing in their goddess, they were able to escape destruction by Mab’s hand and ascend into a paradise where they remain to this very day.\n\nBut for the Pixies still on baseline Earth, they too were able to have the opportunity to experience this paradise of stars, only not while conscious. Whenever a Pixie sleeps, they awaken within Neonachlar and bask in the wonders its people created from the threads of dreams and starlight. Many times, they are able to reunite with loved ones who have passed, and ancestors who were present when the city ascended. This is because through its power, the city of Neonachlar gathered the souls of Pixies who passed to bask in the stars for all eternity. This was a secret the Pixies kept amongst themselves for generations, a secret mostly unknown to the rest of the Fae of the world.\n\nDespite this utopian life in the realm of dreams, there sadly came a later time when Neonachlar would encounter conflicts even within this realm. For the dream realm was not just the home to the dream whisperers of the Oneroi, and ideas given form, it was also home to [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nt-4041-nimuedianetic-karhu the domain of the Erlking and his kingdom]. Despite being an entity affiliated with the Fae Empire, the Erlking was displeased by the sudden appearance of a new kingdom within his realm. For this reason, he kept a careful, watchful eye on Neonachlar, even sending scouts to spy and infiltrate the citadel. After much time with no reported suspicious activity, and upon realizing the Fae origins of the city, the Erlking’s suspicions of Neonachlar began to dwindle. Yet, still having their doubts, they messaged the city warning to never dare attempt to cause a conflict with their kingdom, or else face their unfathomable wrath. Neonachlar quickly responded, stating that as long as they were free to bask in the stars in peace, there would be no problems between their two kingdoms. Thus, a diplomatic treaty of peace was formed between the two citadels, where as long as one did not antagonize the other, there would be peace between them.\n\nSometime during mid-2025, with the fall of the Veil and seeing how comfortable humanity of the public world had become around sapient beings such as the Fae, the Pixies eventually revealed the secret of Neonachlar’s presence with the dreamscape, and their means to travel there while sleeping. After much discussion with representatives of the Pixie inhabitants of Esterberg, Vanguard, the Sidhe Lounge, and Oneiroi Incorporated, it was decided that the public would be granted means to visit the city of Neonachlar via thauma-technological means. This led to the invention of the Star Dream Transcendence Headset, an optical psionic based headset which puts the users into a thaumaturgically induced REM sleep. It then warps their consciousness into the Oneroi dreamscape city of Neonachlar. Many have compared it to a virtual reality experience. Those who experience the Star Dream Headset are able to visit and vacation within the city, where they can bask in the many marvels that the city of stars offers its many visitors.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/the-spire-star-extended-edition/Fata%20Morgana%20Emblem.png style=\"width: 450px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 450%;\"]]**Fata Morgana**[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]](fa-ta mor-ga-na)[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 250%;\"]]The Silver Spire, The White Towers[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nOf all the cities of the Spire Star of the Fae Empire, none was considered more majestic than Fata Morgana. Although Arlende was the capital of the Empire, Fata Morgana was revered as the magnum opus of the Fae Empire’s achievements. Located upon the ocean’s surface several miles off the coast of the beaches of Paradim, Fata Morgana was a city of creativity, beauty, and wonder. From the most heavenly paintings and sculptures to the most harmonious melodies and hymns, Fata Morgana was the creative epicenter of the Empire. Everything the city produced was beyond words in terms of beauty. Even the city itself was an absolute work of art. Tall towers and monolithic palaces of pure silver and glimmering crystal and arches inlayed with the purest gold and alabaster. As a city on the water, pools and rivers of crystal-clear water flowed throughout. Dazzling water fountains, bridges, ornate walkways and platforms spanned far and wide, providing stunning views for all. Like Fernafaun, Fata Morgana also cherished the beauty of nature, but believed that nature and progress should exist harmoniously. The city was filled with many lush parks offering peace and tranquility. The grass was the purest green, and the lovely tall trees were covered with gray bark like that of marble. Silver leaves produced beautiful sounds like that of a wind chime when the winds blew. The parks were surrounded by flower fields brimming with colorful flowers of many varieties. At sunset, the city of Fata Morgana would overlap the sun and appear to sparkle and shine with brilliant light like a diamond. However, the most glorious and breathtaking site was the heart of the city, Titania Spire. The largest structure ever constructed by Fae, the megalithic palace was the governing center of the city. The structure was named after Titania, a legendary benevolent Fae figure from ancient times. Many believed that Titania was an ancestor of the twin queens.\n\nFata Morgana provided many opportunities to bask in the wonders of art and entertainment. Concert halls, theaters, art museums, resorts, exotic dining halls, and aquariums could be found within. But above all, Fata Morgana was a city of absolute peace and purity. While it was undeniable that some of the corruptive influences of Mab had found its way into the other five cities in some shape or form, such as the concept of the wealthy possessing more freedom than the commoner, or how Yefshara utilized human and Yeren slaves, Fata Morgana however held little trace of Mab’s influence. The citizens were adept at maintaining a façade of loyalty to Mab. When not directly under Mab’s watchful eye, all citizens were treated and respected equally, including the many other Fae who would come to visit the city. There was an unspoken understanding that all Fae honored that they would do all within their power to protect Fata Morgana from as much of Mab’s influence as possible. At one time, even Mab respected the beauty within Fata Morgana, and allowed the citizens to live more comfortable lives than in other cities.\n\nJust as Fata Morgana itself was a glorious sight to behold, the people of the city, the Changelings (//Sidhe Leanan Hesperides//), were regarded as the most beautiful of all known species of Fae. The Changelings greatly resembled the common Sidhe Fae more than any other Fae species, however, the Changelings were more elegant in form. Their skin was a healthy vibrant pastel pink with a blue glint, that shone like porcelain. They also had large shiny eyes, but unlike the common black of all other Fae, the eyes of Changelings could be any color imaginable. Their hair was also colorful and flowed like smooth silk. Their wings were their most beautiful feature. They were very large and vibrant, pulsed and rippled with many colors, and were translucent and shimmered like an aurora borealis. Their wings were also strong, as mana flowed deep within them. This allowed them greater mobility and greater speeds while in flight, all the while still retaining their grace.\n\nEven the clothing of the Changelings was graceful and elegant. All attire within Fata Morgana were created from a sparkling and reflective material similar to silk. They dressed primarily in white with subtle accents colors. The men generally wore long-sleeved, high collar tunics with ankle length pants, often accompanied by a long scarf around their shoulders like a vestment. The women wore long gossamer dresses with bell-sleeves. But the one clothing detail all Changelings of Fata Morgana shared was their custom of being unshod. With the occasional exception of ankle length silk stirrups and ankle strips, the Changelings were always barefoot. The reason for this is that they view it as a form of balance between nature and urban progress, a means of presenting their embrace of peace and purity.\n\nMany often called Fata Morgana the city of the Inventor, for it was her will that brought the city to life. She was the orchestrator of its creation and visited the city often. This is why the city had no traces of Mab’s influence, because she had no affiliation with its creation, thus the Changelings followed the will of the Inventor and her court alone. In fact, the ruler of Fata Morgana was a member of the Seelie Court, Adresin Balleor, first Lord of Fata Morgana and the Inventor’s most cherished lover, as well as a long-time childhood companion. Even though the city disregarded the many ideals brought forth by Mab, Fata Morgana was highly adored and respected by the entirety of the Empire, commoners and aristocrats alike. Even the Mabbites and members of the Unseelie Court viewed Fata Morgana in high regard.\n\nAll of the Empire revered Fata Morgana, even the Undoer Mab herself did for a time. However, over the years Mab began to despise Fata Morgana once she realized its peoples were only feigning loyalty to her to protect themselves. Ultimately, she knew they were a great threat to her power and could ignite a flame of rebellion against her. She refused to allow this to come to fruition, but she knew that destroying the city would only ensure a revolt occurred against her, even her most loyal followers would likely betray her. Instead, Mab chose to denounce Fata Morgana as a city of the Fae Empire, separating it from the rest of the Spire Star. She even went so far as to have the bridge connecting the city to the mainland destroyed, and imprisoning all Changelings within the city’s walls. She also had several of the artworks of Fata Morgana destroyed, many which might have been lost forever if replicas had not been created before their destruction. Despite being denounced by Mab, that did not stop the rest of the Empire from continuing to visit and hold Fata Morgana in high regard. However, they feared bringing anything that originated from within its walls, believing Mab would punish them greatly for doing so.\n\nDespite banishing Fata Morgana from the rest of the Empire, revolution and civil war still erupted. However, Fata Morgana was not at all involved in this war, for they were unable to assist due to Mab imprisoning them within the city’s walls. Though the Inventor likely would have preferred it this way, as she was the one who brought life to Fata Morgana, and so cared greatly for its people, and its ruler Adresin. However, what no one knew was that Adresin was also the father of the Inventor’s child, a child that had yet to be born and was kept a secret. Aside from Adresin himself, the rest of the Empire was kept in the dark about the Inventor’s pregnancy. They feared if Mab were to learn of it, she would view the child as a great threat to her power and bring great harm upon them. One early dawn, the day that would be the apex of the legendary clash between the two queens, the time came for the Inventor to go into labor. On that very morning, the first and only daughter of the Inventor, Princess Ariel, was born. Sadly, the first time she ever laid eyes on her mother, was also her last. The Inventor left Ariel in the care of Adresin and left the city to face her wicked sister in a battle that would end in the demise of both.\n\nBut before this battle ensued, those who were present at the beaches of Paradim witnessed what would become of Fata Morgana. They claimed to hear a faint humming coming from the horizon, a sound that rose higher and higher. Suddenly, a mysterious pink mist emerged and swallowed the city in its entirety. The fog and the humming continued for what felt like hours, until finally the humming quieted and the fog dissipated. Shockingly, where Fata Morgana once stood, was nothing. The entire city had completely vanished without a trace, leaving only the water surface of the ocean it once stood upon.\n\n[[div class=\"one column\" style=\"font-family: Old English Text Mt Regular;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-size: 350%;\"]]**Present Day**[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs milleniums passed, the fate of Fata Morgana was a mystery that might never be answered. Eventually, the idea of Fata Morgana faded from fact to mere myth and legend. Many modern Fae believed Fata Morgana and the Changelings never really existed, being nothing more than a tale told by Fae fablers and treasure hunters. Without any means to prove its existence, such as artifacts or ruins, it seemed Fata Morgana would be remembered as nothing more than a fantastical tale. However, it wouldn’t be until 2008 that the truth would finally be uncovered.\n\nThe truth of the city’s disappearance was, in fact, an act of protection by the Inventor and Adresin. Before leaving to stand against Mab, the Inventor gave Adresin a crystal flower which acted as a reflection of her life force. She then entrusted him with a thaumaturgic practice only known to those such as herself and Mab, the art of dimensional displacement. The Inventor pleaded with Adresin to send the city outside this reality where it would be safe from Mab if she were to fail. She believed it was their only protection if she did not return. The flower would determine whether she had lived or not. If the flower was still healthy at the coming of midnight, it meant she had survived and it was safe for Fata Morgana to return. However, if the flower shattered, it meant she had perished in battle and that Fata Morgana was to remain beyond the realms, until a time came when the world was no longer under the threat of her sister, and was more peaceful. She believed one day the world would become truly tranquil, and all peoples of the land would live in harmony. Her hope for such a future was so deep, that as an extra means, the Inventor secretly stored one piece of art from the city within the Empire’s royal repository, but not before slipping a hymn sheet bearing a hidden message within its frame. She then cast a spell to preserve the repository, so that someone would one day discover it and use the knowledge and treasures within to help create a better future. The hope was that they would also summon the white towers back to its home upon Gaia. Thus, when the fog emerged off the horizon, Fata Morgana was warped into another plain of existence, where it remained until modern day.\n\nWhile Fata Morgana remained outside the realms, Adresin and his daughter Ariel, along with all blood descendants after her, would observe Earth through a device dubbed the Eye of the Observer. The many royals watching went on to archive the events and figures of Earth’s long history, with the Fae Empire now nothing but a memory. They witnessed many historical moments such as the Yeren’s time of glory, the Second Diaspora and the founding of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7600 Druv’tuul], the fall of Babylon, the birth of the Daevites, the rise and fall of both [# the empire of steel] and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-baptism-of-fire the empire of flesh], and the many Occult Wars to plague the world for generations. While the descendants of Ariel watched over Earth, the city of Fata Morgana went on to prosper and advance. They went on to create mana crystals. These were bio-engineered organic crystals that rapidly grow from plants which are the primary power source of all the thaumaturgic based technology the city would go on to develop. They created morgana silver, a thaumaturgic metal created from mana crystal enhanced yttrium that serves as a slightly weaker substitute to irrilite. They also created powerful weapons and battle armor for their royal guards and military force, a necessity in order to defend themselves from hostile entities outside baseline reality.\n\nWhen the siege on the factory of James Rollander erupted on August 13th, 1911, the current Lady Titania of Fata Morgana, Áine Lurline Tanaquill, became aware of the soul of Mab that lay buried beneath the facility. Queen Áine attempted to resummon the city so she and its militia would put an end to the conflict and prevent the release of Mab. Unfortunately, the amassing of her army took too long, and had to witness the Third Diaspora unfold. Watching in horror as seventy-five percent of the Fae population outside extradimensional space were stripped of their names and banished to a nameless prison of Mab’s design. Refusing to give up on the many lives lost during such tragedy, but not possessing the means to restore the names of the nameless, Queen Áine chose to seek aid from the divine. Contacting the many deities of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/three-moons-initiative-hub Corbenic], she made the proposal that in exchange for restoring the names of all nameless who died within the Nameless Forest and allowing them to reincarnate, the people of Fata Morgana would worship and praise the deities of Corbenic. Thus, the phenomenon known as VNP-3903 was created, where Nameless Fae along with the victims of the destruction of Hy-Brasil, would reincarnate as humans, who would then be summoned to Fata Morgana when they reached maturity. They would then become Otherkin, Reborn Fae transformed into Changelings, with their true names restored and the memories of their past lives returned.\n\nIt wouldn’t be until [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-lost-spire-part-1 March of 2008, that the city of Fata Morgana would be rediscovered]. When the SCP Foundation discovered the royal repository of the Fae Empire, they came across the aforementioned painting left there by the Inventor. This lead them to learn about Fata Morgana and the legend of the Spire Star. With this information, they temporarily summoned the city back to baseline reality. With the aid of Olivié Gwyneth of the Sidhe Lounge and the Vajra King of Arcadia Ragna Von Morrowind, the SCP Foundation and the Droganians were able to form a partnership with the city of Fata Morgana. In fact, one might say it was the rediscovery of Fata Morgana which started the domino effect leading to the rediscovery of the three remaining cities of the Spire Star. It was also the archives of Fata Morgana, provided by the Lady Titania which revealed much of the knowledge regarding the six cities mentioned here.\n\nBefore the fall of the Veil on November 25th, 2021, Fata Morgana remained outside baseline reality, but means to access the city was granted to the SCP Foundation, the city of Arcadia, the free port of Esterberg, and the still recovering Hy-Brasil. The resources and knowledge gained from this partnership led to thaumaturgical breakthroughs within the SCP Foundation, and a huge positive impact on the organization’s Public Relations within Esterberg. Also, with the aid of Fata Morgana, the Droganian city of Arcadia was able to advance its thaumaturgical technology and architecture much more quickly. It was also helpful in dealing with other obstacles which greatly slowed the restoration of Hy-Brasil.\n\nOn February 14th, 2023, as part of several campaigns enacted by [http://scp-pl.wikidot.com/iluminaci-krytykuja-vanguard the Committee for the Reconciliation of Crimes Against Humanity and Anomalies], the city of Fata Morgana permanently returned to baseline reality, now located not far off the shores of Gdańsk, Poland. The city went to become a popular resort and tourist destination for both humanity and Fae, with sapient peoples of all kinds also free to enjoy the many wonders the city provides. Queen Áine also served as a major contributor in forming the Ever After Congress, an assembly party within the Sidhe Lounge who represent various Fae communities around the world. It is composed of the governing figures of every known Fae settlement. The technology of Fata Morgana quickly went on to be incorporated widely within numerous other Fae communities such as Esterberg. This includes the use of mana crystals as a form of natural energy source in other locations around the world. Since early 2009, many citizens of Esterberg considered Fata Morgana a spark of hope and great change for all of Fae kind.

Finally, Fata Morgana shows how there was indeed some good within the Empire. An example that even in the most hopeless of times, there will always be a spark of hope that will bring about a time of great change and healing.\n\nWhile there were many other cultures that existed at the time, as well as many additional stories and legends regarding the Fae Empire and its twin queens, the legacy of the Spire Star is one that has gone on to shape the world in countless ways. Truly a testament to how remarkable the Fae are as both a species and a culture.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Spire Star Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Arlende Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Brasilveen Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Yefshara Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Fernafaun Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Neonachlar Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Fata Morgana Emblem.png\n> **Author:** WarriorofChaos\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
