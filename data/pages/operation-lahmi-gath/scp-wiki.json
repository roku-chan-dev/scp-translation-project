Outwardly presenting as a military base or other government building has dissuaded all above the veil attacks on Foundation property, allowing all low value and Safe-Euclid sites to operate with minimal site security. Even high-value sites are generally only prepared for one major attack before respite, as would be expected by Hostile GoIs. With the collapse of Federal authority, an entrenched identity as a military base will instead invite frequent attack, which will pose unprecedented issues for continued containment efforts across the entire United States.\n\nAs of 31/10/2014, mass amnestization or anomalous means of preventing assaults on Foundation sites is unfeasible, and the use of anomalous weaponry to protect sites will be inadvisable. For this reason, efforts should prioritize reducing Foundation presence in the United States when possible, and preparing American sites for a prolonged siege event. [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/task-forces#nu-7 MTF Nu-7 (Hammer Down)] will likely be the Foundation's most effective tool to protect major American sites, but does not currently have the capacity to cover every site against prolonged assault.\n\nThis suggests the current Foundation presence in the United States of America will not be practical in the event of civil war. This paper recommends a mass evacuation of Safe and all other available objects from the United States. This will no doubt present several logistical challenges on a scale the Foundation has not yet had to deal with. Security risks involving object transport are considered an acceptable consequence of Operation Lahmi-Gath. Objects are to be transported to other North American sites as space allows, with the construction of other Safe low-security sites as necessary to store Anomalous Items and Safe class anomalies.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**ACTION POINTS**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n# An immediate withdrawal of non-location anomalies that can be moved without significant risk of containment breach from all American sites.\n * Objects are to be rehoused in Canadian and Mexican sites until maximum occupancy.

An average of 80% of this is spent on object containment. With the collapse of traditional production and import routes, continued containment will become increasingly difficult. The Foundation consumes huge amounts of capital and materials in the protection of consensus reality, often requiring incredibly specialized or rare resources that have only become available in the globalized 20th-century world. Alternative methods of acquiring these will be discussed below in order of difficulty.\n\nThe United States are the largest government contributor to the Foundation's budget but will likely be unable and unwilling to continue providing to Foundation efforts in the event of severe civil unrest. In addition to this, America's collapse will lead to a recession, rendering Foundation investments unlikely to make up the difference if required. While long term this provides an opportunity for increased Foundation investment, it leaves very little option for a short term injection. Instead, immediate fundraising efforts could include liquidation of Foundation front organizations or expanded contributions from other nation-states.\n\nEven with sufficient funding, supplying sites brings with it several complications.\nFirstly, there will always be an inherent risk of transporting materials through a war zone, by air or by land. These losses will have to be considered acceptable, but minimized when possible by concealing low-value transport as civilian, and escorts for high value. More importantly, concealed sites deep in insurgents land will not be able to be supplied on a regular basis. Frequent shipments will draw unnecessary attention to Foundation sites, which poses an unacceptable risk to normalcy as mentioned in the first section of Operation Lahmi-Gath. For this reason, all sites should be supplied with several months of supplies, those necessary for containment and food/water to sustain staff for the same period of time. This should allow site self-sufficiency regardless of the conditions around it for everything except electricity.\n\nA power-cut at nearly any site would almost certainly cause a major containment breach. Currently, policy calls for a standardized 6 hours worth of onsite power storage in the form of a battery buffer, but this will be inadequate should American national infrastructure collapse. The Libyan civil war teaches us to expect frequent, long-lasting power cuts, exasperated by the fact that many facilities will be working without the express permission of those with authority over the land they are on, meaning a connection to mains electricity may not be possible at all. Each remaining Foundation site must be self-sufficient in regards to power, for a long enough period that ensures they can run until resupply without risk of a blackout.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**ACTION POINTS**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[/div]]\n\n# Significant effort to appeal for further funding from world governments is to be undertaken.\n * Liaison efforts should focus on nations with proportionally low contributions to the Foundation's efforts, including China, India and Japan.\n * Minor concessions to these nations may be necessary following consultation with and a supermajority agreement of the O5 council.\n# Liquidation of select European and Asian Foundation front Organizations for a short term injection of capital until the world economy can stabilize.\n# Remaining American sites must have no less than three months of supplies to continue containment efforts when resupply is not feasible.\n# All sites must have power generation capabilities greater than the site's maximum usage over the previous six months. \n * Sites relying on fuelled generators must have a stockpile of at least three months fuel to ensure self-sufficiency and isolation.\n * Sites relying on other forms of electricity generation, including most renewable sources, must have a sufficient battery buffer to allow for downtime.\n# To prevent power outage, all sites must run under brownout conditions until the end of hostilities in America.\n[[/div]]\n[[table]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #85ff97;padding: 3px;\"]]\n**Russel:** Foundation-Chinese relations are better now than they were back in 2014, and the Chinese economy's faring better than most the world's who's still recovering from 2020 or reeling from America’s collapse right now.

With that being said, the Ethics Committee has access to Protocol 12 and I cannot in good faith recommend authorizing it short of a worldwide emergency. Introduction of a translator on all Foundation sites seems like an acceptable alternative solution.

We take political prisoners from America or what? We take political prisoners from Russia and China nine times out of ten. And it's one less thing they can hold over our heads since you lot seem set on selling out. The American's will thank us for taking people off their hands and we need all the goodwill we can get right now.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #fcef97;padding: 3px;\"]]\n**Ash:** We aren't sending Americans convicted of having the wrong opinions to death!
