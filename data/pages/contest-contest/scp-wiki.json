Now, you can. Well, you could before, too. Anyone can post a contest hub at any time. There is no rule explicitly preventing this. There is no written policy page for rules regarding contest hubs, as far as I can tell. I didn't have a ton of time to research. \n\n**HOWEVER:** I am legally[[footnote]]morally[[/footnote]] obligated to inform you that you //should not// attempt to run any sort of unofficial contest without speaking to the Community Outreach Team first. They would //really prefer// you didn't attempt to run a contest without their approval. I don't think they'd stop you, but many of the things you'd want to do in order to run a serious, quality contest cannot be done without their assistance and oversight.\n\nAnyway. Point is, you could have run a contest before and you didn't. But now, some funny man whose name is literally placeholder is saying you can do it //competitively//. And there's no way you're turning that down. I mean, you've participated in worse contests. \n\nCome on, don't lie to me, I know you have. I'm scrubbing through your wikidot user history right now. //Memecon?

Like, not just visual art -- //no// art, at all. Your entry must not include anything artistic. Your entry can //be// an Art Contest, though, that's fine!

Although you are allowed to add and remove sections to your **CONTEST CONTEST** entry, ultimately the central idea of your **CONTEST CONTEST** entry should remain the same. This also means that any edits that would comprehensively replace or overwrite your original **CONTEST CONTEST** entry will be prohibited. In the case of having a **CONTEST CONTEST** entry with planned updates or something similar that we have seen in prior contests, a full and thorough outline of said updates must be presented to a **CONTEST CONTEST** marshal before the end of the posting period. This is to help ensure that **CONTEST CONTEST** contestants are given the freedom to be creative with their **CONTEST CONTEST** entries while at the same time preventing the possibility of some **CONTEST CONTEST** contestants being able to obtain \"additional time\" to work on their **CONTEST CONTEST** entry after the end of the posting period.

So just do whatever's required to obtain the regular ol' {{contest}} tag on your entry. \n\nSince I can't use Listpages to target only contest pages created between certain dates, they won't be listed here unless I edit the page, which I'm not allowed to do until ColdpostCon has concluded. So, on 12 January, between the end of ColdpostCon's Voting Period and the end of **CONTEST CONTEST**'s Posting Period, I'll update this page to reflect all the **CONTEST CONTEST** entries!
