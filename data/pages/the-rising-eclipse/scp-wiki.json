Inhaling deep, multiple pops usher from under the covers. He struggles to right himself. Eventually he does, and manages to turn off the infuriating alarm. \n\nHe prays, he stretches, he stands. \n\nShuffling into the kitchen, he prepares a pot of coffee. Hal, his white rabbit servitor, sleeps soundly on the couch. Some nights, when a severe episode happens, Mordecai sleeps on the couch with her. It was better than sleeping in the un-decorated bedroom, alone...\n\n\"Good morning Hal,\" Mordecai grumbles as he sets up the coffee machine. Hal's ear twitches, still lost in synthetic sleep.\n\nThe coffee brews and warm, bitter-sweet aroma wafts throughout the apartment. Mordecai pulls out eggs and cheese from a sparsely stocked fridge. With the eggs frying, Mordecai takes a swift glance toward his personal laptop. \n\nHe sighs. Working on the anomalies had inspired him. Yet, he was still too nervous to get back into writing. It felt empty, and like he was staring at concrete. Internally, he was actually staring at concrete. All five of him that is, all peeking out into the rest of Mordecai's headspace. Mostly, barren concrete and asphalt.\n\n\nThe coffee finishes brewing, while prepping the cup, out of his eye he perceives a silhouette of a bird-person.\n\nGlancing in that direction, he only sees an empty dining room.\n\nHe returns his focus to his coffee and takes a sip. With the honey and breve; lightly sweet, bitter, and creamy. In his thoughtspace, peeking out, cracks began to form on the concrete in the headspace. Something wells inside him, and compels him to walk over and open the laptop.\n\nIgnoring all chat messages, he opens a new text file, puts on music, and allows himself to be lost in his ##gold|thoughtspace## as he types. After a few all-consuming moments, Mordecai's eggs start to burn.\n\n\"Oh shit,\" he says to himself as he jumps up to tend to his eggs. Not burnt, but definitely done. He fixes himself a plate and sits back down at his laptop.

Once there, Mordecai realises he's not alone as he watches Królik fix himself a cup. \n\nMordecai was not in the mood to socialise. He wanted to get his work done quickly, and peacefully. He wanted to be able to return home early, and continue drafting. Such compulsion he hadn't felt since before he joined the Foundation.\n\n\"Ah, Mordecai excellent work with the pollution rhino!\" Królik cheers as he sips his coffee.\n\nMordecai tries to hide his anxiety as he smiled, \"Yea, thanks,\" he pours himself a cup.\n\n\"I read you're going to be on my team soon,\" states Królik in an attempt to make small talk.\n\nMordecai nods his head in agreement and shuffles out of the break room.\n\n\"Leah was right, he isn't all too talkative,\" Królik mumbles to an empty room.\n\n------\n++ 13:13\n\nAfter reading through SCP-6420, Mordecai understood where Leah was coming from about the thaumaturgy.

You know my brother Królik.\"\n\n\"Yea, we had collaborated on 7710's conprocs,\" Mordecai says.\n\n\"The chemical composition is very interesting,\" Królik bluntly states, still recalling Mordecai's reaction at his attempts of small talk.

She had plenty of stories, and struck Mordecai has the sort of person to always look at the bright side of things.\n\n\"Like wise,\" the text-to-speech prompts.\n\n\"So, this meeting's purpose is to familiarize you with 6420 and the team.

He had little time left; he places his phone in his back pocket and starts to get dressed.\n\n------\n++ 08:11\n\nLate, Mordecai enters his office, closes his door and takes a seat. Opening his emails, he reads:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++ 6420digitized_journals_1.pdf\n\n**09/03/20**\n\nToday Tal and I went to pick up the rabbits. Xe suggested we get the rabbits to keep us company during covid. We decided to name the two girls, Grace and Trinity. Their previous owners hadn't spayed them yet so I've set up a vet appointment for the 21st.\n\n**15/03/20**\n\nThe state issued a \"shelter-at-home\" order and for all non-essential businesses to close. Grace and Trinity's vet appointment is canceled. I hope their previous owners' sexed them correctly. Tal re-sexed the rabbits and as far as Tal can tell, both rabbits have vulva.\n\n**23/03/20**\n\nGrace has been acting suspicious lately. She won't let either of us pick her up and she's started nesting. I remember seeing Trinity and Grace humping a few days ago, but that's typical rabbit behaviour regardless of rabbit sex. Could this be a false pregnancy?\n\n**01/04/20**\n\nIt's not a false pregnancy. Happy April Fool's to us…\n\n \n[extraneous journal entries removed]\n \n\n**08/06/20**\n\nGrace wrecked my office door trying to get to Trinity. The hinges are smashed and the door won't close properly. We fear another litter may be coming. We have our hands full enough. Please don't let her be pregnant.\n\n**12/06/20**\n\nTrinity has started to nest.\n\n**21/06/20**\n\nTrinity has had a litter (how did she also have a litter?) and Tal and I haven't found anyone to adopt the rabbits we have.\n\nDamhán[[footnote]]A mutual friend of Tal and Isa in the organic gardening community.[[/footnote]] came by today with empty gallon bins for us to store our rabbit poo. Something felt off when they came over. I can't place my finger on what.\n\nWe hope we can donate this poo. It's a shame to put it to waste.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++ 6420digitized_journals_2.pdf\n\n**12/07/20**\n\nWe woke up one morning to a cloud of flies in the utility room where we keep the empty bins. I double checked the bins and found that Damhán had left standing water in them.\n\n \n[extraneous journal entries removed]\n \n\n**08/09/20**\n\nOver the last few months, we've tried to store some of the poo outside near the forest and some sealed under the utility boards. We've tried keeping the rabbits sexed and apart from each other. But no matter how hard we've tried they keep multiplying. The fly problem is starting to get out of hand.\n\nTal pointed out yesterday that trees sprout from the poo in the house.\n\n**18/09/20**\n\nThe tree sprouts have grown tremendously. Tal and I have been trying to cut down them down but day after day more trees crop up. The flies have gotten so bad I feel like I'm losing my sanity. Tal stated that the fly problem is of biblical proportion… and xe is a theologian.\n\n**08/11/20**\n\nWe woke up to a loud crashing sound. The trees have taken over the house and Tal and I don't know what to do. What do we do? How did they grow that fast?? WHAT DO WE DO?\n\n**12/11/20**\n\n[written in a different hand] Isa has come down with some sort of illness. They woke up after sleeping for a day, complaining of lightheaded-ness. On the back of their neck is a large red scab. We're trapped in the house by trees or I'd take them to hospital.\n\n[illegible]\n\n[written in prior hand as before] I don't know what happened.

Blank expression on his face, his mind spirals inward.\n\n##gold|\"OK, I think I'm gonna have to prepare for this visit,\" said Blues pinching the bridge of its snout.##\n\nMordecai huffs, and closes the laptop. He stands up, switches his office door sign to \"QUIET: THAUMATURGY IN PROGRESS\", and locks the door. He closes his eyes and imagines Hal. After a few breaths, Mordecai strides to his desk, opened a drawer and begins to prepare a mini-altar.\n\n##gold|\"Hal, I need you here Hal,\"## whispers Mordecai to an empty room as he sets up the thaumaturgy work space. Hal appears as Mordecai goes to his bookshelf, \"Good morning Hal, we have a problem,\" states Mordecai occupied with the books. \n\nHe grabs a printed copy of the Torah, and a copy of Psalms. Thumbing through both books, he finds the passages he wants and bookmarks them.\n\n\"So to catch you up to speed Hal,\" Mordecai says as he sits down in his chair to rest for a moment, \"SCP-6420-1 is a house I'll be visiting today that seems to have been cursed, or hexed. The rabbits at this location are hostile, and have overcome the thaumaturgy of two other theologies already.\"\n\nHal bobs her head up in down in apparent acknowledgement.\n\n\"I reckon, because both the 'Shema' used by the prior residents, and Macky's 'Hail Mary', weren't focused or even the appropriate prayers for the situation, that the prayers broke when interacting with the thaumaturgic flow of-- whatever the hell this curse is,\" he takes a moment to slurp coffee. \n\nFrom his notes he read, \"//'Tal stated that the fly problem is of biblical proportion… and xe is a theologian.'// Tal is one of the prior residents of the house, and clearly xe were referencing the Plagues. However, since there is some heavy shenanigans at play here-- I'm going to use passages specific for this uh, hex or curse,\" he continues to read his notes, \"'//##gold|Exodus 12:13##, and ##gold|Psalms 7:2-3## and ##gold|91:1-4##//, as basis for a protection charm.\"\n\nHal sits upright lifting her chin. Mordecai continues, \"And this is where I need you. I need you to be our last line of defense. I'll program you into the charm,\" Hal bobs her head in agreement.\n\nMordecai finishes his coffee, stands up and turns down the lights. Whispering under his breath, he approaches the gold colored candle and lights both it and incense. His whispers turn to chants as he opens his notebook, the printed Torah, and Psalms. He carefully copies down the needed passages in both English and Ceremonial Hebrew. He strikes out any mentions of the name of ##gold|G-d## while copying. His intent was to ##gold|burn## the charms after the visit.\n\n------\n++ 15:26\n\nAn overcast day, white rabbits hop around the grass near the house. Mordecai and Królik step out of the car.\n\nCradling his head, Mordecai states, \"Wow, I can feel the thinness,\" he uses the car door for support, \"I was not prepared for this.\"\n\n\"What is? Are you alright?\" concerned, Królik asks.\n\n\"Just, the reality here is thin. It's a bit dizzying. I'll be alright in a moment, I have to get my bearings,\" he takes a deep breath in, \"It's like being on a boat at sea.\"\n\nAfter a few moments pause, Mordecai centers himself and him and Królik approach the house.\n\nCrossing the threshold, Mordecai shivers. Królik gives Mordecai another concerned look. Mordecai shakes his head, \"I'll be alright. Show me the kitchen.\"\n\n------\n\n\"So, you're sure y'all searched thoroughly?\" Mordecai asks as he starts to open random pantry doors and cupboards.\n\n\"Totally,\" said Królik as he adjusts the neck brace he wore to avoid getting infected. Mordecai has no brace, and does not care. His \"\"\"charms\"\"\" are enough.\n\nMordecai goes into the utility room from the kitchen and begins to root around. After several minutes of struggling and cursing, Mordecai closes his eyes and centralises his focus. In his ##gold|thoughtspace##, him and Blues \"swapped\" points of view, ##gold|Mordecai opens his eyes and sees thin, jagged strands of golden light in the dark. His eyes follow the threads to a location on the utility room floor. He blinks.## \"Swapping\" again, Mordecai goes to the spot and dusts off the top of a trap door.\n\nHe tries lifting the latch. Rusted. He whispers, ##gold|\"Break.\"##. The lock breaks, and he swings the trapdoor open. Out rushes a cloud of little black flies. Both investigators yell in surprise. After the cloud disperses, Mordecai checks the hiding spot. Four large, one gallon buckets sit covered in rabbit poo.\n\n\"Eureka!\" exclaims Mordecai.\n\n\"Well, I'll be-- we didn't search as well as we thought.\"\n\n\"I don't blame you really, this place is creepy.\"\n\n//Thump!//\n\nMordecai and Królik look over their shoulders. Standing between them and the kitchen exit is a horde of rabbits.\n\n\"For the love of God, not again,\" Królik motions toward his service weapon.\n\n\"No,\" snaps Mordecai, \"We got this.\"\n\nHe closes his eyes, and sees Hal, ##gold|\"We need you Hal.\"## Mordecai opens his eyes and watches as a giant Hal, three-times the size of a normal Hal, manifests in front of him and Królik. Hal shimmers with ethereal silver mist. The horde of rabbits hop away in fright.\n\n\"Excellent Hal,\" states Mordecai.\n\nHal honks loudly, and startles Królik and Mordecai.\n\n\"Alright, alright, alright, I feel we've overstayed our welcome,\" Mordecai nervously says to Królik.\n\n\"I have no complaints. I'll grab the buckets,\" Królik says. Him and Mordecai follow Hal out of the house as she continues fending off rabbits until the trio reach the car. Mordecai scratches Hal's snout, \"Gut kinigl,\" he whispers to her, as she dissipates into mist.\n\n------\n++ 17:34\n\n\"On further analysis, 'Super Scrumptious, and Pleasant Produce' went out of business in 2019,\" types Macky into her keyboard, \"Damhán must've worked at 'SSAPP' before they went out of business.\"\n\n\"What about this though,\" Mordecai points at the bottom of the bucket. In each bucket is a crude, squiggle in sharpie.\n\nMacky types, \"LOL I was hoping you could tell me. It looks like something you might know.\"\n\nMordecai rubs his chin, \"Well, it sorta looks like a sigil. Maybe I can deconstruct it?\"\n\n\"Who could've put it there?\" asks Macky.\n\n\"From reading the files, I reckon Damhán. After all, these were their buckets that they donated. Could be a runaway fertility spell, since the buckets were meant for the local gardens.\"\n\n------\n++ 22:56\n\nMordecai throws his keys on the counter, and shrugs off his spring jacket. Hal hops up to him in greeting.\n\n\"You did a fantastic job today sweetie,\" he bends down and pets her. She lays flat like a pancake, \"Ahhh, flat bun,\" after a few moments of cuddle time, Mordecai takes a deep breath in, \"OK Hal, we think we know how we're going to end the new piece.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[div class=\"script\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[size 75%]]\nI-1-6\n[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[div class=\"dialog\"]]\n[[div class=\"char\"]]\nBLUES\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"dtext\"]]\nTaiga can destroy the item in question, thus destroying the demon's anchor or tie to the world.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"dialog\"]]\n[[div class=\"char\"]]\nSTACCATO\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"dtext\"]]\nThat would trap her in a half-human, half-demon, form though wouldn't it?
