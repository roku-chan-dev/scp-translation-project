The subject is to undergo a daily behavioral modification regimen under Project Burgess. The current director of Project Burgess is Dr. Marcella Fenwick. \n\n> ++++ Project Burgess:\n> \n> 1. Contain SCP-9922 during its inert phase until regeneration begins.\n> \n> 2. The iteration is to be kept under constant surveillance for five years to ensure that it does not vocalize. To this end, SCP-9922's throat will be filled with expanding fiberglass foam on a thrice-daily basis.[[footnote]]Unfortunately, due to supply chain issues resulting from SCP-001's rampage, this is not a permanent solution.[[/footnote]] Rudimentary human education will be administered during this phase.\n> \n> 3. Once the iteration has demonstrated the self-awareness of a five-year-old human child, foaming will discontinue. SCP-9922 will be administered weekly \"quieting\" placebos. SCP-9922 will view between 7 to 15 films per day. The content of said films needs to be moralistic, with simple themes of good vs. evil. SCP-9922's comprehension of the themes in these films is to be tested after viewings.\n> \n> 4. After SCP-9922 has demonstrated sufficient comprehension of morality, the content of viewings is to shift to films with graphic depictions of murder, torture, animal cruelty, slavery, cannibalism, and/or sexual assault.[[footnote]]Due to the possibility of SCP-9922 seeing a correlation with its containment procedures, //A Clockwork Orange// has been banned from Project Burgess.[[/footnote]] In an absence of new material, the use of surveillance footage of ethically questionable Foundation activities has been authorized. Again, SCP-9922 will be tested after each film to ensure its understanding of right and wrong.\n> \n> //(Note: Should SCP-9922 begin to enjoy the films of Phase 4, progress is to revert to Phase 3 for as long as necessary.)//\n> \n> 5. If there is sufficient evidence that containment has instilled a sufficient amount of moral and humanitarian values in SCP-9922, **[5/BURGESS CLEARANCE REQUIRED]**.\n\nIf SCP-9922 should enter a vocalization event, the instance is to be rendered inert by any means necessary, and Project Burgess will revert to Phase 1. Ten minutes of sustained heavy machine gun fire have proven effective to destroy SCP-9922's current body and render the core inert.\n\nHowever, if any staff members onsite mention a desire to interact with \"the Party behind the Party Door\" between SCP-9922's vocalization and neutralization, the onsite nuclear warhead is to be detonated immediately.\n\nMost importantly, under no circumstances is SCP-9922 to return to SCP-001.\n\n**Description:** SCP-9922 is a shapeshifting lifeform of extradimensional origin that was used as the power source for SCP-001. Inscriptions within SCP-001 referred to SCP-9922 as the \"Traitor-Flame.\" At some point, SCP-9922 assumed control of the ship to destroy the crew, most of the ship's captives, and 7.9 billion human beings.\n\n**Anatomy:** While inert, SCP-9922 is an indestructible orange disc, 5cm in diameter and 0.5cm in width. \n\nAfter 170.2 hours of inertia, a body begins to form around the disc, eventually resembling a human being with orange skin, white hair, and solid black eyes. This humanoid appearance is believed to be a result of Project Burgess convincing SCP-9922 that it's a human boy, triggering an instinct to blend in with its surroundings. Every surface of its body perfectly imitates human textures and functions.\n\nA newly-regenerated instance of SCP-9922 lacks the memories of its previous iterations. However, if it vocalizes, it will immediately assume its default appearance, regain its memories, and enter a state of extreme hostility and indiscriminate devourment.\n\nSCP-9922's default appearance is a 2.3-meter-long being that resembles a winged serpent. Its only orifice is a mouth with 14 rows of pointed teeth, made of the same material as its skin. The skin has the superficial appearance of red blown glass. The only visible organs are three yellow, amorphous eyes located over the teeth. There are two winglike arms on either side of the head section with a variable amount of digits.\n\nSCP-9922 is capable of changing its body's size and shape when agitated. The extent of this ability is currently unknown.\n\nThough the surface temperature of this form's skin is always one degree Celsius colder than its surroundings, SCP-9922 contains an unknown amount of superheated plasma that can mimic the effects of SCP-001's \"world-eating\" ability. It is believed that SCP-001 was designed to harness and amplify this power for commercial or military purposes.\n\nAccording to inscriptions from SCP-001, the energy contained within the \"Traitor-Flame\" is limitless. \n\nAdditionally, in its original state, SCP-9922 is capable of subconsciously inducing surrounding organisms to allow it to devour them. In human subjects, this manifests as the subject expressing an interest in going to \"the party behind the party door.\" Due to the hypothetical collateral damage that would result from testing, this effect has yet to be fully understood.\n\n------\n\n+++ __Addendum 1: SCP-9922 Recovery Timeline__\n\n>  **5/1/2028:** SCP-001's neutralization confirmed. \n> \n> **5/2/2028:** Excavation begins of SCP-001's crash site. SCP-001's hull was only minimally damaged from impact -- hypothetically, it could resume operation if SCP-9922 were reconnected.\n> \n> **5/7/2028:** Cpt. Thaddeus O'Dell's body is recovered from an observation deck on the bow of SCP-001. Cause of death was determined to be head trauma during SCP-001's impact with the ground. Prior to death, O'Dell had severed his own Achilles tendons, leaving a written note to explain why:\n>\n>> Last entry will have to be written instead of oral; the whale-things stepped on my commlink. \n>> \n>> Then they tried to take me to the {{Party Door}}. I was right about the \"party\" being nothing but flames. They didn't look too bright, so I just told 'em, \"you go first.\" And they bounded off, giggling and neener-neering at me as their flesh charred and boiled. They didn't even scream.\n>> \n>> That was disturbing enough -- but the longer I stared at the fire, the more I started to... //want// it? My fear of missing out was on overdrive. So what if I didn't want to burn alive, I was the only one who didn't --{{get to go to the Party, which is behind the Party Door, where you can drink as many jolly Party Fluids as you want and}}--\n>> \n>> Yep, I'm fucked. But I've got one last plan. \n>> \n>> Why does the Traitor-Flame need to use this bullshit --{{Party}}-- hypnosis to --{{get people to join the Party behind the Party Door and interact with Party Objects}}-- THE POINT IS, why does it need people to --{{RSVP to the Party}}-- GO THERE instead of just grabbing them --{{and some glowsticks}}--?\n>> \n>> Then it hit me --{{and by \"it\", I mean Party Fever}}-- -- I didn't see any reserve power units on the ship. If the Traitor-Flame unplugs itself for even a second, the whole ship will lose --{{their excuses not to Party}}-- power --{{to the DJ}}--!\n>> \n>> No. I have decided --{{to suckle the Party Breast for to partake of its Party Milk}}-- I'm gonna hurt myself in such a way that I can't --{{rave}}-- move. Then, --{{Mr. Party-Haver}}-- the Traitor-Flam--{{boyant Party Outfits}}-- will have to unplug --{{the electric Party-preventing device so that Parties may occur}}-- itself from the ship to come and get me -- thereby cutting --{{up the dance floor with my sick moves}}-- the power and causing a crash--{{ing a Party isn't nice}}-- landing, and that means we won't have to worry about --{{losing your right to Party}}-- **FUCK YOU AND FUCK PARTIES**\n>> \n>> Tell my wife I--{{'m a Party animal}}-- I lo--{{st my keys at the Party}}-- I love --{{Party Solids and Party Liquids, both of which can be found behind the Party Door}}-- LOVE YOU BABY --{{but if I had to choose between you and the Party Life, I'd stick your head in a}}-- [Aggressive, incomprehensible scribbling]\n> \n> Cpt. O'Dell has been posthumously issued the Foundation Cobalt Cross for bravery in the line of duty.\n> \n> **5/9/2028:** Additional inscriptions from within SCP-001 deciphered, leading to more information about SCP-9922 that would eventually go into its containment procedures.\n> \n> **5/10/2028:** SCP-9922's regenerated body, hereafter SCP-9922-2, located 59 km south of crash site. Going against orders, Dr. Vadim Yusupov loads 19-Perun with unmanned ammunition to dispatch SCP-9922-2, resulting in its degeneration. SCP-9922 was recovered from the resulting pile of glass.\n> \n> **5/11/2028:** Containment procedures under Project Burgess finalized. \n> \n> **5/12/2028:** Representatives of the extradimensional GoI-4019 \"Three Moons Initiative\" enter Australian airspace on a humanitarian mission. In a joint effort with the Australian government and the Initiative, the Global Restoration Interim Government (GRIG) is founded to use anomalous technology to terraform and eventually restore the Earth's habitable surface area affected by SCP-001.\n> \n> **5/15/2028:** Work begins on the construction of 2,000 new Foundation containment sites in SCP-001 affected areas that have sufficiently decreased in temperature. Anomalous means approved to hasten production.\n> \n> **5/17/2028:** SCP-9922 regenerates; Project Burgess begins...\n\n------\n\n+++ Addendum 2: __Project Burgess Iteration Log__\n\n**Iteration:** SCP-9922-3, \"Robbie\"\n**Result:** Failure\n**Age of Vocalization:** 2 years, 3 months, 4 days\n\n**Iteration:** SCP-9922-4, \"Roland\"\n**Result:** Failure\n**Age of Vocalization:** 6 years, 1 month, 29 days\n**Note:** Onsite nuclear device detonated during rampage; Provisional Site-581 lost.\n\n**Iteration:** SCP-9922-5, \"Ronnie\"\n**Result:** Failure\n##545454|**Age of Vocalization:** 7 years, 10 months, 1 day##\n\n##8c8c8c|**Iteration:** SCP-9922-6, \"Rupert\"##\n##d2d2d2|**Result:** Failure## \n##e8e8e8|**Age of Vocalization:** 1 year, 11 months, 20 days## \n##f0f0f0|**Note:** Onsite nuclear warhead detonated; Site-1858 lost.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##white|.##\n\n##f0f0f0|**Iteration:** SCP-9922-126, \"Raphael\"##\n##e8e8e8|**Result:** Failure## \n##d2d2d2|**Age of Vocalization:** 9 years, 2 months, 14 days## \n\n##8c8c8c|**Iteration:** SCP-9922-127, \"Roger\"##\n##545454|**Result:** Failure##\n**Age of Vocalization:** 25 years, 1 month, 1 day\n\n**Iteration:** SCP-9922-128, \"Raymond\"\n**Result:** Failure\n**Age of Vocalization:** 18 years, 6 months, 12 days\n**Note:** Onsite nuclear device detonated during rampage; Backup Area-481 lost.

Observation has proven that SCP-9922 has no need of nutrition. However underdeveloped his mind may have been at the time of the attack, he gained nothing from it but an outlet for his rage.\n> \n> Therefore, we //cannot// allow ourselves to grow too attached to SCP-9922. Whatever form he takes, however well he behaves -- we can never truly rehabilitate him. There is no way to atone for a ten-digit amount of murder convictions. \n> \n> I don't say this out of hatred. Emotions are addictive and dangerous in our line of work. I say this to ensure that we don't stray from the path laid out by our founders. An organization's core values are its lifeblood. And if those values falter, their every practical application will suffer. \n> \n> Never forget: the old Foundation Ethics Committee were the ones who came up with Project Valkyrja, and they conveniently booked the first tickets for themselves. //That's// where compassion for the enemy gets us.\n> \n> The day that he becomes our friend is the day we lose our humanity.\n> \n> You may re-educate him. You may treat him politely. You may integrate him into Phase 5. You may do as you please, so long as you remember: **SCP-9922 will never truly deserve a second chance, freedom, or compassion.**\n> \n> All detractors are advised to tell 7.9 billion charred corpses that \"he didn't know any better.\"\n> \n> \n> \n> [[>]]\n> - Leonid Saltan, Former Administrator of the Foundation\n> [[/>]]\n> \n> \n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dyfscp0013/offset/7 Congratulations.
