Welcome to my museum and R&D. Here at Golden Moth, we value the research and  preservation of only the highest quality artifac-\n\nWhat's that?\n\nThe artifacts here aren't that good?\n\n...\n\nWell you can bugger off then.\n\n----\n+++ METAPHYSICS WING\n\nA fledgling department dedicated to the study of memetic and metaphysical concepts.\n\n++++ ARTIFACT #1\n+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6043 SCP-6043]\n\nFun fact, the Golden Moth institution was founded after we discovered this marvelous specimen! We helped discover the mechanisms by which life functions in the metaphysical realm.\n----\n+++ EGYTPOLOGY DEPARTMENT\n\nAh! I see you've found our Egyptology department! It's quite small so far but our teams are actively searching for more to put on display. Just across the corridor, to the left of our patented Crocodile Death Pit, you'll find a cat adoption center. Please do pay it a visit!\n\n++++ ARTIFACT #1\n+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6990 SCP-6990]\n\nOur Egyptology research team had a lot of fun finding this one. Ever wondered about ancient aliens? Well, we finally have an explanation for that; this artifact!\n\n----\n\n+++ INTERNET CULTURE AND HISTORY\n\nWelcome to our Internet Culture and History department! Despite it being staffed exclusively by teenaged interns who are payed in \"dank memes\", the area is surprisingly clean! Do mind the stray memetic hazard.\n\n++++ ARTIFACT #1\n+++++ [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5273 SCP-5273]\n\nThis artifact was a joint project with the wonderful curator [[*user hungrypossum]]. Surprisingly enough this qualifies as an artifact, at least by our standards! We've thoroughly scrubbed any and all memetic hazards from this artifact, so you should be free to look at it without worrying about waking up on a bathroom floor at 3 AM.\n\n----\n\n+++ ENTOMOLOGY\n\nThis is our newly-opened Entomology Department! Hold your party poppers, you don't want to startle the insects. Please do read the posters, and just follow me-\n\nNo, that's not a typo. Our guards will beat you with life-sized replicas of various insect wings until you leave if you erroneously use \"bug\" and \"insect\" interchangeably.\n\n++++ ARTIFACT #1\n+++++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6048 SCP-6048]\n\nYou wanted a golden moth? You got it baby! This specimen is our largest yet, actually. Now we can officially say we have the largest lamp in town. ðŸ˜Ž\n\n----\n\nWell, that's the end of this guided tour! I sincerely hope you enjoyed this.\n\n...yes that's it.\n\nYes, there's only 4 departments with 1 artifact each right now. But stay tuned! We're steali- pardon me, we're searching for more constantly! Keep checking back here to see what we've got.\n\n----\n\n++++ REVIEWS\n\nReviews for the Golden Moth Institution have rolled in! Let's take a look.\n\n\"4/5 stars, the museum is great but the staff wouldnâ€™t show me the 'golden' 'moth'\" - [[*user Fishish]]\n\n\"1/5 - damn the writings pretty good but i thought this was the golden goth museum. very disappointed\" - [[*user SketchyTh0ughts]]\n\n\"4.5 stars - Excellent aesthetic here and the curator is a class act.

Is. My. Golden. Moth? I've been looking all over the souvenir shop yet nothing. Apart from that, it's alright. 3/5 stars.\" - [[*user winkwonkboi]]\n\n\"3.5/5 I was told I would get a real golden moth at the end of the tour but all I got was this rock covered in highly-toxic lead paint. The artifacts were pretty sick though.\" - [[*user cwazzycwafter]]\n\n\"I've seen the golden moth. They showed it to me. This did happen. I did see it. It was beautiful. I'm not lying. I promise it was real. I definitely know that it happened. I'm pretty sure what I saw was the golden moth. 0/5 stars.\" - [[*user Deadcanons]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
