I now welcome them as a test of my emptiness. \n\nThey helped me come closer to that golden city, the city in the middle of the void. \nThe city I had to be empty to reach.\nIt was beautiful. \nWhen I could gaze upon it, the fumes of incense and scent of ancient books flooded every orifice I had.\nThe memories of the librarians were welcome, for they showed me more of the city I needed to reach.\n\nI couldn’t possibly understand those who would resist the city's call. \nTo do so is like crying “Mommy, it’s cold! It's so cold! Please let me in!”- \nwhen dear mother is already suffering the torments of Avīci for an antarakalpa.\nPathetic. Weak.\n\nMother had taught me all about the faith I went wayward from.\nShe taught me her mantras, her ways to meditate, and her ways to reach her own Nirvana.\nThere's no reason to regret leaving her. To regret joining those who lock up even the stars.\nAfter all, I eventually came back. \n\nThe cold is a blessing.\nI can take it.\nI won't reject this precious gift, for it is the best that one still weighed down by their humanity could receive in this Naraka. \nThe cold builds character and empties us of weakness.\nWithout it, we children would struggle to ever escape this ever-repeating wheel of reincarnation.\nI didn't even need to go round and round to understand this.\nI was ahead, better than the rest.\n\nThe footsteps got closer, and I realized something new.\nNot hundreds of feet racing as one. Not the golden centipede, then.\nJust two. A visitor for me? How quaint.\nJust when I was to depart for the golden city, at last, and a non-believer - as I used to be a non-believer - arrives to interrupt?\n\nThey would need to learn a lesson. \n\n\"Oh, golden centipede, how much longer will you wait?\" I asked- and was rewarded with a response. The wayward child - we are all children - startled, jumped back, and fell to the ground.\n\nI waited, patiently.\n\n\"What the- Oh. Fuck me, you're a skipper. Are you going to kill me?\" The child's voice was genderless to my ear. It didn't matter. We were all equal on this path to leaving the wheel. Their emptiness was curiously impressive- so close, for all they had not dedicated their life to the path. In truth, it was much the same for me. It had been three months since I came back. It ceased to matter when I was close. So close.\n\nI felt a tug, a feeling atrophied by time and disuse. In another life, it might have been pity.\nNow, that feeling didn't matter. Helping others achieved nothing but creating a distraction.\n\n\"I have no intention of harming you, as my previous occupation would have demanded.\" I paused. A question of my own. \"Do you also seek the golden city, smelling of golden incense?\" The child was wayward - and it tugged at some long-gone feeling to leave them to suffer in this emptying Naraka. I buried that feeling as deep in the void as I could.\n\n\"What?\" A long pause, broken by nothing. \"No. I-I'm looking for a Way. To get to the Wanderer's Library, where I can escape from this living hell.\" They were getting their confidence back the longer they were speaking to me. What a bold, proud child. \"I heard the Serpent's Hand was evacuating. No one...No one else got out of Three Portlands besides me, as far as I know. The Jailors...They got in too fast. Wrecked the place with some [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7450 giant mind-controlling bird monster]. Nearly everyone I saw was marching right towards the bastard instead of fleeing.\"\n\nThe child was telling an irrelevant story. I had heard of Three Portlands before. The photos of it had been pleasing to the eye, when I had still had eyes, but what was its beauty to that of the golden walls of the city in the void?\n\nThe story being told did not matter, but my question was in order.\n\n\"Do you desire to keep going? To go round and round until you reach the bottom of reincarnation? To keep crying out for your mother and father in cold winters, when you could empty yourself of that pain? That is the path you are walking, lost child. I hope you can listen to our dharmas. Find your salvation in this place.\"\n\nThey didn’t seem to want to listen and I could never make them. I had no obligation to bring a sinner back in.\n\n\"Shit. You don't know anything, do you? Fine. I'll just be leaving then. And I didn't have a \"mother and father\", asshole. I had two moms. And now they're both dead, and so is everyone else I cared about because of your [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5000 damned organization]. I'd tell you to go to hell but it looks like you're halfway there.\"\n\nI had one last thing to tell the child before they departed.\n\n\"A warning for you, child. Your mothers are already suffering an eternity in the cold Narakas, just like my mother. Farewell.\"\n\nThe child honored me with a response.\n\n\"Well, fuck you too.\"\n\nWith that, they left. What a sad, lost child.\n\nAnd yet, with them gone, I felt renewed excitement. With the distraction gone, I could finally depart- for the city in my dreams. I just had to empty my self- and I would be gone. \n\nI meditated once more.\nI focused on nothing.\nThe cold crept in and took my self with it.\n\nThe scent of opium grew stronger.\nThe rustle of old books grew louder.\nI was one in the many chanting our empty mantras.\nIt was a sight beyond sight.\nI approached śūnyatā.\n\nYad rūpaṁ, sā śūnyatā; ya śūnyatā, tad rūpaṁ.\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7027 And thus, my form empties for all of you.]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=calhutcherson]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
