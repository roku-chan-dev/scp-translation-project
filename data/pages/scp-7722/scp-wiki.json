In cases such as that of SCP-7722-SGB, a physical perimeter may be established to prevent transplanar contamination. Limited interference within national governments has been authorized to ensure that commercial developments or other forms of long-term human activity do not encroach within 10 kilometers of SCP-7722 instances. \n\nMedia trends are to be manipulated to popularize the practice of staying up late and normalize midnight shifts, in an effort to increase the total population of waking individuals at any given time.\n------\n**Description:** SCP-7722 is a collective designation for several uninhabited human settlements that do not exist in consensus reality nor correspond to any existing human settlements, mundane or otherwise, but may be made to manifest in consensus reality. \n\nExisting analyses have inferred SCP-7722 to be extradimensional in nature. Instances of SCP-7722 may range from small villages to sections of urban agglomeration spanning tens of square kilometers, and are universally devoid of fauna. \n\nDespite being uninhabited, SCP-7722 instances contain evidence of extensive human activity to a degree consistent with mundane settlements of equivalent size. Utilities such as electricity, plumbing, and telecommunications networks are observed to maintain functionality within SCP-7722 in the absence of infrastructure to support them. \n\nSCP-7722 instances may enter consensus reality if its ontokinetic signal is reciprocated by a sapient medium, resulting in a small proportion of the human population being capable of perceiving and potentially achieving crystallization of SCP-7722 instances. Unaided manifestations of SCP-7722 are only possible under certain conditions: It must be night at the location of manifestation, and the individual sensitive to SCP-7722 is not under observation by unattuned individuals.\n\nUpon meeting these conditions, an instance of SCP-7722 will manifest within baseline reality, overwriting the existing terrain and any structures located within. The degree of manifestation is dependent on the number of unattuned individuals nearby, decreasing in size and intensity as these individuals increase in number. If the aforementioned conditions are no longer fulfilled at any point, the SCP-7722 instance will rapidly fade away, returning the affected area to its original state. As such, exploration attempts are advised against entering tall structures within SCP-7722 instances.\n\nOntokinetic amplification centered on attuned individuals has been shown to be effective in reliably bypassing the observation restriction, but may result in undesired crystallization of instances into consensus reality. Crystallized SCP-7722 instances do not dissipate naturally, but may be forcefully displaced by application of SRAs.\n------\n[[=]]\n+ {{Addendum-7722/01}}\n++++ Discovery\n[[/=]]\n------\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **«BEGIN LOG»**\n------\n[Dr. Oshaghan stands on the dock behind Area-514, cigarette in hand, staring into the night sky. A door creaks open behind her. Dr. Vetaluna emerges from the building, pulling a trolley of equipment behind them.]\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** About time. Want a smoke?\n\n[Dr. Vetaluna yawns and takes a swig from their coffee mug.]\n\n**VETALUNA:** I'm good with just the caffeine, thanks. Anyway, we're primed and ready to go.\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Alright. \n\n[Dr. Vetaluna begins flipping switches on the trolley. Dr. Oshaghan winces.]\n\n**VETALUNA:** How do you feel, Dr. Oshaghan?\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Just like I did that night. Feels like sleepwalking-- Everything is heavy and fuzzy and-- The anomaly-- Mmph. SCP-7722 is definitely still here. Good call on the uh. Uh... I-- The amplifier thing. I-- Ugh.\n\n**VETALUNA:** OK. Just focus on visualizing SCP-7722. \n\n[Dr. Oshaghan begins breathing heavily. She grasps her temples as a minor distortion effect occurs on the dock in front of them.]\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** I see it.\n\n**VETALUNA:** Confirming visual contact with SCP-7722.\n\n[The distortion begins expanding, contorting the shape of the dock as a faint afterimage forms over the area. The wooden dock is slowly obscured by a concrete floor that spills out from the distortion, spreading beyond the end of the dock and into the sea. Yellow bollards rise out from the new floor, and cargo containers shift into view in the distance. LED floodlights flicker into existence, half-illuminating what was once the dock as the light refracts off and disappears into the cracks in local reality.]\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Something-- something's different. //Feels// different. It--   \n\n[Dr. Oshaghan screams. A strong wind rises, and the waves begin churning violently to match. Alarms sound from at least 4 different machines on the trolley. The distortion abruptly accelerates. The concrete floor spreads rapidly over the waves as objects on the port vanish and reappear in different positions every few milliseconds. Dr. Vetaluna panickedly hits several killswitches.]\n\n[Cargo containers, cranes, entire buildings and ships rip into consensus reality from parts unknown. The port has now completely obscured the former dock. Dr. Oshaghan collapses, but is caught by Dr. Vetaluna.]\n\n**VETALUNA:** Sayagul! Are you alright? Can you hear me?\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** God, my head... Give me just a bit I'll be fi-- \n\n[Dr. Oshaghan stares at the newly formed port. She stares back at Dr. Vetaluna.

Did I do that?\n------\n= **«END LOG»**\n------\n**AFTERWORD:** Documents recovered from the port indicate that it was a container terminal within the Port of Amddiffyna, the capital of the Republic of Afalonia. No record of this political entity exists within Foundation records, including those of the Deepwell Archives. \n\nFollowing this incident, Dr. Oshaghan was found to possess non-negligible ontokinetic abilities that were most likely amplified during the attempt to replicate the initial discovery of SCP-7722. Subsequent attempts to recreate this effect using other ontokinetic personnel or equipment have been unsuccessful.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= **«BEGIN LOG»**\n------\n**SANKARAH:** I thought SCP-7722 was supposed to dissipate after sunrise? \n\n**OSHAGHAN:** We believe the over-amplification caused the anomaly to 'crystallize' into consensus reality. We had only meant to strengthen its manifestation enough to allow the exploration of the anomaly before it dissipated. At least we know it works.\n\n**VETALUNA:** It works a little too well. The port is still there out back. We'll have to refine our methodology a bit more before we continue.\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Continue? We've already confirmed the existence of the anomaly, I'm not sure if manifesting the rest of the port will help with the investigation.\n\n**SANKARAH:** Dr. Oshaghan. You remember SCP-6140, yes? \n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Daevastan? Yeah, I was on one of the XACTS maintenance teams during that event. \n\n**SANKARAH:** Prior to the re-manifestation of that country, similar phenomena was reported near what is currently the Daevastani city of Aydyragat. Described as a kaleidoscope-like mirage in the middle of the desert. However, this was only ever attested on a single Parawatch forum post amidst the peak of Fresno nightcrawler sightings and was immediately buried by a torrent of grainy photoshops. Our webcrawlers didn't even bother to flag it at the time.\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Are you suggesting SCP-7722 is merely a part of something greater?\n\n**VETALUNA:** We've found similar points elsewhere. Locations where local reality weakly fluctuates with a certain ontokinetic signature. It's never strong enough for any significant anomalous activity, but it's noticeable to our more sensitive monitoring stations. \n\n**SANKARAH:** Dr. Oshaghan. As your supervisor, I am formally requesting your cooperation in investigating this matter. \n\n**OSHAGHAN:** I-- Of course I accept, but don't you have more suitable personnel for this? Like, trained ontokinetics? \n\n**VETALUNA:** None of our trained personnel resonate as well with the aforementioned ontokinetic signature as you do. Hence the unforeseen thaumic spike during our test. We tried to replicate the test with our most experienced ontokinetics and they barely managed to cause a ripple in local reality, even when assisted by our most powerful ontokinetic amps.\n\n**SANKARAH:** I know how cliché this sounds, but you are quite literally the best person for this task, Dr. Oshaghan. You will be sent to these locations of interest, where you will figure out if they're anything like SCP-7722. While Dr. Vetaluna will be supervising you, I've also made arrangements with other Sites within the vicinity of the aforementioned locations of interest to provide assistance. \n\n**OSHAGHAN:** If I may, wouldn't it be more suitable to, I don't know, train some ontokinetics to be able to zero in on this specific ontokinetic signature? \n\n**SANKARAH:** Dr. Oshaghan, I understand how all this must seem to you-- Suddenly being thrust into a project of this scale, but please understand this: There could easily be other Daevite Empires hidden all around us. We have no other SCP-140s with which to track them. For all we know, investigating other SCP-7722 instances may be the only thing standing between normalcy and the incursion of a genocidal anomalous civilization unto consensus reality. Time is of the essence here.\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** ...very well.

They wouldn't be out of place if they were nexuses, like Three Portlands or Esterberg. \n\n**VETALUNA:** And what of the towns and villages? The ones where nothing's different except for a flag or language?\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** I-- I don't know. I thought it was just a phenomenon of folded reality, that we were making copies of places that are hiding from us, or just aren't accessible.

Sayagu-- Damn it all.\n\n[Emergency protocols are executed, bringing all equipment offline. Without amplification, SCP-7722-SGB rapidly dissipates, but is not completely neutralized. A fracture in reality persists, approximately 5 meters in diameter, through which the instance can still be seen. Errant streams of warped reality periodically shoot out of the rift. Dr. Oshaghan continues to stare at it.]\n\n**VETALUNA:** Dr. Oshaghan! What the hell are y--\n\n**OSHAGHAN:** Alyx. Look. \n\n[Dr. Oshaghan points into the rift. A government building is visible, superimposed onto the steppe behind it. In front of the building is a large statue, bearing a strong resemblance to Dr. Oshaghan. As reality refracts around the aperture, the surroundings of the building alter accordingly. In one frame, the building is in smoking ruins. In another, it is draped in turquoise and green banners. In another, it is the backdrop of an empty military parade. In another, it is ground zero of a nuclear detonation.]\n\n------\n= **«END LOG»**\n\n[[/div]]\n\nA physical perimeter has been erected surrounding SCP-7722-SGB, reinforced with a Faraday cage and an on-site SRA array despite the instance now only constituting a visual anomaly. Analysis of the instance is currently ongoing, with over 3,200 distinct sub-realities identified and counting. \n\nAs with all other SCP-7722 instances, all sub-realities are devoid of human life. 48% of sub-realities depict some form of XK-Class Scenario, either ongoing or post-incident. 30% depict a heavily armed, and possibly belligerent Shigastani polity. The remainder depict a mundane nation, with nothing of note. Due to the interstitial pressure, it is not considered possible for any given sub-reality within SCP-7722-SGB to reinforce itself and enter consensus reality. Hence, it is considered self-containing. In order to avoid disrupting this equilibrium, ontokinetic testing on SCP-7722-SGB has been suspended until further notice.\n\nAccording to telescopic imaging and radio transmissions originating from the instance, SCP-7722-SGB is centered on the Shigastan Official Residence in Shigasmenbashi, the capital of the so-called [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/wikipedia-shigastan Republic of Shigastan]. The statue in front of the building is that of its third President, Sarah I. Galbraith. The connection between Dr. Oshaghan and Galbraith is currently under scrutiny. ##0d0d0f|The wild thistle blooms twice.##\n [[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Aftokrator]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
