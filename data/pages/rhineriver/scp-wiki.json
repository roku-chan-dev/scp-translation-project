This creature reportedly stalks through the woods at night, using its glowing eyes to see in the dark. Its eyes appear as a pair of flashlights, giving the illusion to unsuspecting passersby of a group of people lost in the woods.\n\nRhineriver will lure in its prey by calling out to them in a voice resembling a human, asking individuals in its line of sight to critique its writing. It is unknown what happens to individuals who take it up on this offer, as no one who has approached the creature has ever been seen again.\n\nThe morning after the disappearance of a person at the hands of Rhineriver, a small piece of paper will be found near the location of their capture. These scraps contain writing, apparently written by the creature, most commonly fictional stories. It is currently unknown if there is any correlation between the story found and the victim of the attack, with one of the most popular theories stating that each story contains a riddle leading to the location of the victim.\n\nBelow is a list of all writings recovered following Rhineriver attacks. If you have any more to contribute, leave a comment on this thread or private message me.\n\n[[size 125%]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCPs\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[/size]]\n\nThe following writings consist of what are apparently supposed to be recovered documentation from some mysterious organization. The sections labelled \"commentary\" were found written on the back of the scraps and are supposedly the creature's thoughts on its writing.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5749 SCP-5749 - Double Jeopardy]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-5749\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** Neutralized\n\n**Posted:** May 18, 2021\n\n**Quote:** //\"Due to the horridness of their actions, 7 members of the ITD council have been removed.\"//\n[[size 125%]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show commentary\n| hide=- Close commentary\n]]\n[[/size]]\n**Commentary:** My first work on the site, and also my favorite thing I've written for the site. I actually didn't plan on posting anything for a while later than this, but when 6kcon was announced I figured it was as good a time as any to set myself out there. The original draft was much shorter, and only consisted of everything before the second addendum, but then I showed it to my sibling and they suggested I add more to the story. For some reason the idea of a second lobster controlling the ITD crossed my mind in the middle of class and I instantly wrote the rest from there. A couple revisions later (especial thanks to the kind critter who reminded me how lobster fishing works because I was a dumbass who thought you catch them like regular fish) and here it is. I'm still incredibly happy with it and I recommend you read it over any of my others.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The name Andrew Mercury was originally a placeholder based off one of my sibling's characters. I liked the name and they let me use it so it ended up in the final piece.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6664 SCP-6664 - I Hate For the Trees]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6664\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Posted:** July 1, 2021\n\n**Quote:** //\"SCP-6664-1 is written in pencil on paper, and contains the text, 'See how it feels?

And one I'm pretty proud of, too. This started out as a silly idea I had during tennis practice one day. There's a forest near the court I play on and in it there's these trees that I can't tell the species of. Thinking about that for probably a little too long gave me an idea for a tree whose species no one can agree on. As I wrote the idea I developed it further and eventually it ended up in the form it is today. This was probably one of the most fun I've had writing an article, mainly because I got to learn how to do the Listpages Thing for it. I think some parts of this could've been better, but I'm honestly happy with it as-is so I'm probably not going to change it.\n\n**Fun Fact:** I posted this on the same day Series 7 opened, making it one of the first non-6kcon entries in the series, which is pretty cool I think. Also yes, the title is a Lorax reference.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6444 SCP-6444 - On a Rainy Day Just Like This]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6444\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Posted:** July 15, 2021\n\n**Quote:** //\"SCP-6444 has no clear pattern of manifestation, save for the fact that SCP-6444 has, to-date, never occurred on a day where Culwick Elementary School is in session.\"//\n[[size 125%]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show commentary\n| hide=- Close commentary\n]]\n[[/size]]\n**Commentary:** The original inspiration for this was actually the picture at the top. I took it during a thunderstorm while I was bored and sitting at my desk. I've always loved thunderstorms, and they often get me in a productive mood, so I started writing on a whim after taking the picture. This article was originally going to be a lot more. I originally planned to have a whole search log for Merrick with Upsilon-13 attempting to track xem down with increasingly unethical methods. I was also originally going to set this in Deepwell for that reason. I scrapped it because I didn't really know enough about Deepwell and because personal deadlines kept me from expanding like I wanted to. I honestly think this one would've been better if I kept the original story but alas. I'm still decently proud of how it turned out.\n\n**Fun Fact:** Before I came up with the Deepwell storyline that evolved into the current storyline, this was going to be a feel-good piece about reconnecting with loved ones. Oops.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6244 SCP-6244 - Scot Pilgrims Vs.

I wrote this while I was on vacation, so if it seems a little rushed and chaotic that's probably because it is. This went through many iterations before I settled on its current form, most of which were scrapped because they didn't match with the title. Similarly to 6444, this was originally a feel-good story, and involved Novelty's citizens escaping a hostile parallel multiverse and seeking asylum in our reality. Again, oops. I seem to have a tendency to make happy stories sad, which probably says something about my writing style. I don't have much else to say about this one other than that it was really fun to write and it's one of my favorites of mine, even if some parts aren't as good as I'd like them to be.\n\n**Fun Fact:** Originally, the series of events we see happen in the flash drive occurred in our reality instead of a parallel one. I changed it literally last minute because the story didn't sit right with me and I liked the implications of the baseline document compared to the parallel reality document.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3644 SCP-3644 - Slot reserved, please do not fill]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-3644\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** TBD\n\n**Posted:** September 5, 2021\n\n**Quote:** //\"The SCP-3644 slot in the Foundation database is reserved for an as-yet undiscovered entity witnessed by Dr. Salem-Orden on September 2, 2021.\"//\n[[size 125%]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show commentary\n| hide=- Close commentary\n]]\n[[/size]]\n**Commentary:** Baby's first sleeper hit. This only got a lot of attention and upvotes several months after it was posted. I was inspired to write this by Aethris's SCiPtember challenge, particularly day two's tag \"paradox\" (even though the article itself didn't end up having that tag). I developed it from an idea I'd come up with a couple months prior but never ended up doing anything with, and I think I ended up doing pretty good. I love the DoTA and I'm glad I finally got to write something for them. I also wrote this during the great shortform trend of August and September 2021, and it's probably detracted from a little bit by its shortness, but frankly I like it. And that's really what matters. Plus, I also snagged a Series IV slot, so that's pretty cool.\n\n**Fun Fact:** Dr. Salem-Orden's canonical first name is Evie. If I ever use her again in the future this fact will probably be less fun.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6749 SCP-6749 - Historical Refishionism]\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6749\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Posted:** April 2, 2022\n\n**Quote:** //\"Good job everyone.

I wasn't originally planning on writing anything for April Fools' Day but the idea for this crossed me in the middle of class and I liked it enough to develop it further, and I ended up completely finishing the draft by the end of the day. I initially wanted to post this on April 1 itself but I thought it fit better with the story of the article to post it on April 2, and also the community was kind of just having a moment that day and I didn't want to get involved. This was a really fun world to develop and I really want to use these characters again, but I'm not entirely sure how I'd do that. Such is the way of canonically erasing characters from existence.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The setting of this as well as the image are leftovers from another draft I never finished that sort of got reanimated into this. It was originally a lot more cryptic and boring, and I personally like this better.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7420 SCP-7420 - Worst Case Scenario]\n//[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp7000contesthub SCP-7000 Contest] Entry//\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7420\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**Object Class:** Uncontained\n\n**Posted:** July 25, 2022\n\n**Quote:** //\"Problem is, almost every member of RAISA is dead, and they're the only ones who can make direct edits to database files.\"//\n[[size 125%]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show commentary\n| hide=- Close commentary\n]]\n[[/size]]\n**Commentary:** Possibly my most controversial article, vote-wise. This was originally a tale draft I wrote over the course of a day after coming up with the idea for the punchline, but I repurposed it for 7kcon because I felt like it fit the theme and it was just collecting dust in my notes app at the time. I went with this draft after giving up on a previous 7k draft that wasn't going anywhere, but maybe I'll revisit it someday. Many people have said that this would work better as a -J, which is fair, but I feel like the bait and switch doesn't work as well if you're expecting a joke.\n\n**Fun Fact:** This was originally titled \"teemo\" when I first posted it and it kept that title for a glorious ten minutes, but reception to the title was so negative I elected to change it.

It came from me reading a tweet about the 5,000 polygon toothbrush model in Yandere Simulator, and thinking about how funny it would be if something like that existed in the world of SIMULACRUM. SIMULACRUM is a very interesting concept to me, and it was fun getting to explore what it would look like to be trapped inside of something like that when it breaks. The timing worked out perfectly, as I was already planning on writing this by the time GoblinCon rolled around, and it motivated me to get off my ass and actually get around to it.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The metal bar image is not actually a metal bar, but is instead a picture of a static mixer filled with glue.

Flash forward to me reading all of the WWS formats on-site two years later, and I got a little tired of the format of \"Caretaker gets attached to animal, animal dies, sadness ensues\" that so many of them follow. I remembered this idea, and decided it would be a fun exercise to try to flip the format on its head. Here is the result, and also my first GoI format! The first of many...\n\n**Fun Fact:** Thunder's name comes from my childhood cat, who was also a Bombay breed. A large part of the inspiration behind this article comes from many of my friends avoiding my room when I was a kid because they were scared my cat was unlucky, and how much that bummed me out because I loved my cat so much.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/erics-mega-zine-vol-49-an-intermission-to-keep-you-hanging ERICS MEGA ZINE VOL 49: AN INTERMISSION TO KEEP YOU HANGING]\n//[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/remixcon2023 RemixCon 2023] Entry//\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"erics-mega-zine-vol-49-an-intermission-to-keep-you-hanging\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n\n-----\n\n**GoI:** Eric\n\n**Posted:** September 3, 2023\n\n**Quote:** //\"it's part of the reason why i started the Mega Zine in the first place, i didn't have too many creative outlets with them around. i wonder if they're still out there being assholes to someone else.\"//\n[[size 125%]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:coltop\n| show=+ Show commentary\n| hide=- Close commentary\n]]\n[[/size]]\n**Commentary:** I've always been a big fan of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/erics-mega-zine-vol-50-the-cutout-room ERICS MEGA ZINE], and thought an art-based GoI Format was really cool. As an artist, I'd been meaning to contribute a format of my own to it for a while, but I was never really able to come up with anything I liked enough. Then, after my first RemixCon draft had miserably gone nowhere and I had already given up on joining the contest, I was scrolling through the [[[Cool War 2 Hub]]] as I often do in times where I need inspiration, and the idea to cross the three struck my brain. I decided an Eric format remixing an old Eric article would be a really fun concept, and with the AWCY? angle 683 just made the most sense. The rest mainly consisted of doing the actual drawings, which was my favorite part of it, as well as drawing on my own personal experiences with developing my art style to write the story.\n\n**Fun Fact:** The pen is supposed to be a reference to [[[SCP-067]]], and there are also references to [[[SCP-085]]], [[[SCP-066]]], and [[[SCP-168]]] in there.

I think removing the image was by far the right choice, even if it's an important part of site history.
