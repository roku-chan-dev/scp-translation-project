[[/footnote]] Mayor Darnell Hollis advocating for the creation of a new aqueduct through the town's only municipal freshwater deposit, the eponymously named 'Ridley's Creek'. A brief transcript of the event has been attached below.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> @@ @@\n> //Recording begins mid-speech.

Containment personnel were unable to locate Veneer nor Hollis; their disappearances were later attributed to a fatal motor vehicle accident.\n\nAfter one month of investigation producing no leads, SCP-5589 was presumed to be an isolated incident, and, following an internal vote by the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-726-ex |Department of Inbound Object Processing]]], classified as Extranormal Event #AXZ28D-B. \n\n**Addendum:** SCP-5589 was flagged for further research potential on July 24th, 2021, after the interception of an unusual package sent to the home of Site-88[[footnote]] A biological research facility in Cincinnati, Ohio.[[/footnote]] Director George Ramirez. Ramirez was previously aware of SCP-5589, having overseen its classification as an extranormal event while serving as a member of RAISA, and had more recently supervised the construction of a new wing of Site-88 dedicated to the containment of ranine and caecilian-like anomalies.\n\nUpon opening, the package was found to contain only a single printed image, which has been attached to this document below.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open attachment\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block-base name=https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/stoner995/Two_frogs_yellow.jpg|caption=72421.jpg|width={$width}|width=300px|link={$link}|link=#|align={$align}|align=center]]\n [[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5588]]] | SCP-5589 | [[[SCP-5590]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
