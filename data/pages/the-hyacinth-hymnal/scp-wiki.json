Periodic gunshots are heard.\n\nPOI-35233:\n\tI waited patiently for the Lord; and he inclined unto me, and\n\theard my cry.\n\n\tHe brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry\n\tclay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.\n\n\tAnd he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our\n\tGod: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the Lord.\n\n\tBlessed is that man that maketh the Lord his trust, and\n\trespecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.\n\n\tMany, O Lord my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast\n\tdone, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be\n\treckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak\n\tof them, they are more than can be numbered.\n\n\tSacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast\n\tthou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou no\n\trequired.\n\n\tThen said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is\n\twritten of me,\n\n\tI delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my\n\theart.\n\n\tI have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I\n\thave not refrained my lips, O Lord, thou knowest.\n\n\tI have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have\n\tdeclared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not\n\tconcealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great\n\tcongregation.\n\n\tWithhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy\n\tlovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.\n\n\tFor innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities\n\thave taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;\n\tthey are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart\n\tfaileth me.\n\n\tBe pleased, O Lord, to deliver me: O Lord, make haste to help\n\tme.\n\n\tLet them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my\n\tsoul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to\n\tshame that wish me evil.\n\n\tLet them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto\n\tme,\n\nPOI-35233 pauses. Heavy breathing is heard.\n\n\tLet all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let\n\tsuch as love thy salvation say continually, The Lord be\n\tmagnified.\n\n\tBut I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou\n\tart my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.\n\nThe sound of a gun being loaded.
