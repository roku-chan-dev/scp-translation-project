It was discovered by Agent █████, and was approximately 2 m in length. Though it walked on four limbs, its front limbs had human-like hands capable of operating complex devices. SCP-567-9-1 was quite intelligent, and was able to deduce the operation of a [DATA EXPUNGED]. There were a total of 14 casualties prior to its containment.\n\n**Date:** June ██, 19██\n\nSubject: SCP-567-9-2\n\nDescription: SCP-567-9-2 appeared shortly after Site 41 was fully established and quarantined, and took the form of [DATA EXPUNGED].  Foundation personnel suffered 9 casualties before it was destroyed with remote explosives. Agent ███████, who participated in the containment of SCP-567-9-2, is currently undergoing psychological counseling for his experience.\n\n**Date:** July █, 19██\n\nSubject: D-834200\n\nDescription: D-834200 was used as part of testing to determine the trigger conditions for each cell.  When placed in front of the cells, SCP-567-6 and SCP-567-7 both activated simultaneously and attempted to draw D-834200 in. After a brief struggle, D-834200 was [REDACTED]. The individual body parts vanished as per the usual, once drawn completely into the cell. \n\n**Date:** July █, 19██\n\nSubject: SCP-567-9-5\n\nDescription: During testing of SCP-567-4, when the cell door was opened, SCP-567-9-5 manifested and immediately attacked and killed Dr. ██████ without warning. It took the form of [DATA EXPUNGED]. Due to the presence of high-value personnel, standard containment procedures were not feasible. After a total of 7 casualties, [REDACTED] was able to lure SCP-567-9-5 back towards SCP-567-4, at which point it activated, drawing SCP-567-9-5 back into it.\n\n\n**Date:** December ██, 20██\n\nSubject: SCP-567-9-8\n\nDescription: On December ██, 20██, the door to SCP-567-7 was observed to open and close via CCTV, but no instance of SCP-567-9 appeared on the monitoring system. Two weeks later, [REDACTED] was found dead in his bed, in circumstances identical to those of deaths involving [[[SCP-966]]]. Mobile Task Force Iota-1 was dispatched, and located SCP-567-9-8 within Site 41. SCP-567-9-8 appeared similar to an instance of [[[SCP-966]]], with variations in [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-567-9-8 was successfully contained, and facility cameras were upgraded to observe additional wavelengths.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
