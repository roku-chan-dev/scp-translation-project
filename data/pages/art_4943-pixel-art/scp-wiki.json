Common style, or at least employed pretty often by other people. Anyway, SCP-4943 was certainly a weird and disturbing one from my personal viewpoint, so I decided to head for that one.\n\n= I originally made pixel art for this one twice, but I finally picked on the second design because I liked it way more. Anyway, here it is!\n\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=4943.png|align=center|width=70%|caption=SCP-4943 (\"Transcendence\"), by Attila The Pun.]]\n----\n\n= Although I felt that some of the cables or the design didn't fit, or if there's a lack of detail, I still liked it.\n\n= **Merry Christmas!**\n\n= -- //[[*user Abrethe]]// / //[[*user Roundabouts]]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Abrethe]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 4943.png\n> **Author:** Abrethe\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:4943-pixel-art SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
