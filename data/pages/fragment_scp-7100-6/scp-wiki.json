  "content": "##blue|**Part 5: Scientific Experimentation**##\n\n##blue|The very nature of the anomalous means that the phenomena we tackle do not conform to our current understanding of science. However, that does not mean that application of scientific method is without merit.##\n\n##blue|The Foundation has state-of-the-art laboratories at its disposal. However, these facilities are shared between all researchers at a facility. Make sure that, before your scheduled time slot, you have been thorough in your experiment design as to ensure efficient time usage.##\n\n> __Microscopic Examination__\n> \n> //Monochromatic Fluid:// Examination of sample under a microscope showed no anomalous characteristics aside from the liquid maintaining its color. When two different colors of the liquid were poured into the same petri dish to examine their combined form, each color liquid separated similarly to oil and vinegar.\n> \n> //Milky White Fluid:// Examination of sample under a microscope showed no anomalous characteristics.\n\n> __Chemical Decomposition__\n> \n> //Monochromatic Fluid:// Chemical analysis of the fluid found that its molecular structure was no different from water.\n> \n> //Milky White Fluid:// Chemical analysis found that the fluid consisted of a combination of water, bone marrow, and an additional, unidentified compound. \n\n> __Ingestion Experiments__\n> \n> //Hypothesis://[[footnote]]##blue|Going into an experiment with a clear hypothesis will ensure that some minimal amount of information is determined from testing, even if ultimately the hypothesis is inconsequential to final containment.##[[/footnote]] SCP-7100 affected individuals reported feeling liquid being poured down their throat. It is possible that there is a correlation between their increased luck, and these substances. \n> \n> //Procedure://[[footnote]]##blue|Documenting your procedure is a key step, even if it is never read by other personnel, as it will ensure that you have thought out each aspect of the experiment, and that you remain consistent between trials.##[[/footnote]] For each fluid, we will have a subject ingest a given amount, and then partake in a luck-based activity. They will be isolated after the ingestion, until results from their luck-based activity have been reported to limit the number of activities where this luck could manifest outside of the selected activity. Each fluid-luck activity will be tested 10 times, across different test subjects.\n> \n> We have selected ingestion as the method of applying the liquid to a subject as it most closely resembles the testimonies from SCP-7100 affected individuals, however in future experiments we may test the effectiveness of applying the fluids through alternative methods, such as skin contact or eye drops.\n> \n> //Results:// Presented below on a subset of the case-by-case trials in the table below:\n\n\n||~ Ingested Fluid ||~ Luck-Based Activity ||~ Average Result ||\n|| Monochromatic Fluid, 50ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 1.2$ ||\n|| Monochromatic Fluid, 100ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 0.8$ ||\n|| Monochromatic Fluid, 200ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 0.9$ ||\n|| Milky-White Fluid, 50ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 5.2$ ||\n|| Milky-White Fluid, 100ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 25.4$ ||\n|| Milky-White Fluid, 200ml || 5$ Scratch-Off Lottery Ticket || Won 70.2$[[footnote]]Average significantly raised by one 200$ winner[[/footnote]] ||\n|| Milky-White Fluid, 100ml || 10 Hands of Poker || 1.4 High Card Hands, 4.6 Pairs, 2.7 two pairs, 0.5 three of a kinds, 0.2 straights, 0.01 flushes ||\n|| Milky-White Fluid, 100ml || Applying To 10 Jobs[[footnote]] Subjects all applied to entry-level office jobs, which none had previous experience in using their real resumes.

Well, let's hear it then.\n> \n> **Teller:** So, the rainbow water from the terminus had— it had no correlation to increasing a subject's luck in primarily financial activities. Specifically, winning a scratch-off lottery ticket.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Okay.\n> \n> **Teller:** But the other fluid— the one we found inside the cavern had a very... um... statistically significant correlation. Like, uncharacteristically convenient levels of correlation. \n> \n> **Mackey:** I see...\n> \n> **Teller:** And— and that. That was the one I w-w-was, well, drenched in. Back during the mission.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Yeah. Yeah I see what you're saying.\n> \n> **Teller:** Should we put me in containment? I'm not sure it's safe for someone affected by the anomaly to be heading the project...\n> \n> //Mackey sighs.//\n> \n> **Mackey:** I know you know that I want you on this project. But I hear your concerns. I still want you to keep monitoring but I'll put together a list of possible replacements. I can start sending over your files so if something happens, they're primed to take over.\n> \n> **Teller:** That doesn't sound very... preventative.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Containment is fundamentally reactionary. We just don't talk about how much work ConProcs are to come up with in the official files. Besides, I wouldn't want anyone leading this, not after all the work you've done so far.\n> \n> **Teller:** But I'm just—\n> \n> **Mackey:** Trust me. The moment things get out of control, I'll step in. \n> \n> **Teller:** ... sorry.\n> \n> **Mackey:** No need to apologize. And hey, if you really think you might be affected, it might do some good to do a follow up on our previously affected persons. Those were mostly short-term investigations anyways. A longitudinal study would inform your case better.\n> \n> **Teller:** Right, right. I'll do that.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Any other questions on the docket? \n> \n> **Teller:** So um, what about the rescue mission? How did that go?\n> \n> **Mackey:** They were able to re-enter the cavern we explored last time. Said it had the same beetle bodies, tent debris, everything.\n> \n> **Teller:** D-did they find Casey?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Not exactly, they found her recording equipment. It was discarded in the pond where we left her. But no Casey.\n> \n> **Teller:** But they checked the whole cavern?\n> \n> **Mackey:** The whole thing.\n> \n> **Teller:** Does that include the, uh... the caves? \n> \n> **Mackey:** The ones flooded in the back of the pond? No. No they didn't search there.\n> \n> **Teller:** W-why?\n> \n> **Mackey:** Well, due to the instability of the terminus that we experienced, they didn't want to get too far away from the entrance in case of a sudden disruption.\n> \n> **Teller:** B-but she could've been down there. \n> \n> **Mackey:** I know kid, I know.\n> \n> **Teller:** Was Norman on the team?\n> \n> **Mackey:** I— I don't think so.\n> \n> **Teller:** Oh... maybe we should do another one then. Bring me and Norman.\n> \n> **Mackey:** Why?\n> \n> **Teller:** Because then we'll be luckier!\n> \n> //Mackey lets out a sigh.//\n> \n> **Mackey:** I'm not going to tell you you're wrong, because you rarely are. But I can't recommission an entire rescue mission, with the only change being \"the team will be luckier\". Financials and operations will both laugh my ass out of the site. \n> \n> **Teller:** But she can't survive down there forever!\n> \n> **Mackey:** Probably not. But unless you can give me more reason to commission another operation I'm telling you right now I can't get it approved.\n> \n> **Teller:** I see...\n> \n> **Mackey:** I mean, I don't know why you're being so mopey about it. You'll have a whole forty-five page proposal on my desk in about a week.\n> \n> **Teller:** I— I can't make any promises. \n> \n> **Mackey:** Then don't, Mr. Lucky. Make a bet.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#e6e6e6; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 0 2%; float:right; width: 45%\"]]\n[[>]]\n{{[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7100/offset/6 Next document]}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]",
