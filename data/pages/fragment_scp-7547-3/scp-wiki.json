Audio taken from monitored phone call.\n--------------\n\n[[=]]\n**Begin Log**\n[[/=]]\n\n//(Hallway #3, Wing-A. Engle approaches a locked door down the hall. He holds a keycard up to the scanner and the door opens.)// [[footnote]]Upon closer analysis of the footage, the card scanner does not appear to show the color change indicating the keycard as valid.[[/footnote]]\n\n//(He enters a large room, full of file cabinets along with a few computers placed against the wall. Engle sits down at one that is obscured in the footage by the cabinets.)//\n\n**Engle:** I’m in. How long do I have?\n\n**Female Voice:** If you’re lucky? 3 hours. Though a more realistic estimation would be just 2 hours.\n\n**Engle:** And how much luck is in the cards today?\n\n//(Clacking of a keyboard, clicking of a mouse.)//\n\n**Engle:** “Incident 23-1 Gamma.” //Manahiem.// “Murder took place at…” “Corpses suffered anomalous transfiguration…” …What? “Believed to be connected to the Children of the Scarlet King sect operating in the area. Suspect is–”\n\n//(The lights in the room suddenly turn off. Adam falls silent.)//\n\n**Female Voice:** What happened?\n\n//(Engle does not respond. In the distance, a computer monitor lights up and an unintelligible noise begins playing from it. Engle slowly approaches the disturbance, indicated by the noise gradually increasing in volume.)//\n\n//(As he gets closer, the noise is made out to be the name “Pinocchio” being repeatedly called out. Engle reaches out towards the computer, while a figure approaches from behind and reaches for his shoulder.)//\n\n**Unknown Person:** Adam.\n\n//(Engle spins around and grabs the person’s arm, restraining them.)//\n\n**Engle:** What’s your angle? Who are you!\n\n**Unknown Person:** Woah, woah! It’s just me, dude. It’s Dan!\n\n//(The lights turn back on, revealing the individual to be agent Daniel Cho. Engle releases his grip while pocketing his phone.)//\n\n**Engle:** //Jesus Christ//, man. In what world would you think that was a good idea?\n\n**Cho:** I just wanted to know what you were doing and why you turned off the lights.\n\n**Engle:** Then why did– what do you mean?\n\n**Cho:** //(He motions to the computer.)// Why are you watching cartoons in here?\n\n//(Engle looks at the computer, on which the 1940 movie Pinocchio -- specifically, the scene in the movie in which Geppetto searches for Pinocchio -- has been playing.)//\n\n**Engle:** I wasn’t, I… //(Sighs)// Nevermind.\n\n**Cho:** Whatever, man. //(Pause)// Hey, are you doing okay?\n\n**Engle:** //(Pause)// Yeah.\n\n**Cho:** Okay. Cause I know this case has been stressing you out lately, so if you need someone vent or just talk to, I’m always open.\n\n**Engle:** I appreciate it.\n\n//(Cho nods before leaving the room, slipping slightly on a puddle prior to exiting. Engle takes out his phone.)//\n\n**Female Voice:** It might be best to find everything you need and then bounce.\n\n**Engle:** Right…\n\n//(Adam returns to his computer.)//\n\n**Engle:** “Level 4/7547 Access.”\n\n“Observation of the ritual indicates it is approaching 70% completion. SCP-7547-OMEGA (Adam Engle) has a current Foundation Loyalty score of 94; within acceptable margins but lower than in past months. SCP-7547-OMEGA is to be placed under increased supervision so as to maintain the Foundation’s control on the approaching SCK-Class (Paradigm Shift) Scenario. Data predictions show if all goes according to plan, containment success rates will increase by 15% and the Foundation will possess greater jurisdiction over the planet earth and reality as a whole.”\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Female Voice:** They were using you.\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Engle:** “It is unknown how many groups are aware of the truth of SCP-7547, but it is confirmed that the Global Occult Coalition, Serpent’s Hand, and Marshal, Carter, & Dark are aware of the purpose of the ritual.”\n\n//(Pause.)//\n\n**Female Voice:** We could trip the alarms, you know. Have them run in and amnestisize you.\n\n**Engle:** You do that and you’re right back at square one, without little old dash omega under your thumb.\n\n**Unknown Voice:** Read the Incident again.\n\n**Engle:** “...Connected to the Children of the Scarlet King sect operating in the area. Suspect is believed to be… Evan Boothe...”\n\n//(Engle backs away from the screen, bumping into a cabinet before stumbling out of the room.)//\n\n//(He walks down the hall, visibly disoriented. As he does he starts quickening his pace, before sprinting and then finally running.)//\n\n//(He continues running and enters a door not shown on Site-55’s blueprints. Over the phone, the sound of footsteps in shallow water followed by a crashing noise is audible.)//\n\n**End Log**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[>]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7547/offset/4 (IV/VII) --->]\n[[/>]]",
