Current location has been lost.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Due to a lack of information on SCP-4947, it remains uncontained. Efforts should focus on researching and permanently cataloging SCP-4947 in Foundation records. \n\nAs of [DATA LOST]\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\nSCP-4947's location is tracked through remotely-monitored seismographic readings taken along SCP-4947-A, with an accuracy of 23%. For ease of containment, several points located in SCP-4947-A have been marked as either strategically or geographically significant. Designated SCP-4947-A Leaf Points[[footnote]]Defined as any point resting on the perimeter of SCP-4947-A.[[/footnote]] around SCP-4947's projected location are to be filled with plain concrete[[footnote]]As of 19/10/2024, the Foundation lacks the resources to fill the entirety of SCP-4947-A.[[/footnote]]. Mobile Task Force Psi-16 (\"Martyrs\")[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 99%. **Justification:** Psi-16 is not a registered task force.[[/footnote]] is to watch for and attempt to study and subdue SCP-4947 during this time.\n\nFoundation holding companies are to perform land grabs of SCP-4947-A affected areas. Structures built within 3 km of SCP-4947-A are to be condemned and demolished. Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor reports of sudden sinkhole activity around SCP-4947-A, with a focus on designated Leaf Points and recent SCP-4947 sightings. \n\nPersonnel are encouraged to transfer out of the SCP-4947 project as soon as possible.[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 100%. **Justification:** Illogical containment procedure.[[/footnote]]\n\nInstances of SCP-4947-B are to be destroyed as soon as possible. Foundation webcrawler ƟU-947[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 67%. **Justification:** ƟU-947 has registered itself idle for the past **NaN** months.[[/footnote]] is offline.\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\n**Description:** SCP-4947 is a burrowing entity, possibly native to Northeastern Europe. [DATA LOST] SCP-4947 spends much of its time underground, possibly emerging rarely for unclear reasons. SCP-4947 does not appear to require sustenance or sleep. No visual records or sightings exist of SCP-4947.\n\n[DATA LOST]\n\nSCP-4947-A designates a series of faults, spanning an area of at least ████ kilometers^^2^^[[footnote]][DATA LOST][[/footnote]]. SCP-4947-A is maintained primarily by collapses resulting from SCP-4947's constant burrowing, and does not correspond to any naturally-occurring fault zone. The majority of faults form lines between instances of SCP-4947-B.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-4947/scp-blank.png|caption=Rocks discovered near SCP-4947-A24.]]\n\nSCP-4947-A's primary anomalous effect is the creation of holes in the surrounding area. Landscapes and objects around SCP-4947-A will develop gradually expanding holes on their surface. Notably, this extends to living organisms, including [DATA LOST].\n\nSCP-4947-B designates several buildings, all of which contain at least one hinged door. Through an unknown process, buildings can become instances of SCP-4947-B through proximity to SCP-4947-A along with existing instances of SCP-4947-B.\n\nHinged doors within SCP-4947-B connect to at least one other hinged door in another instance of SCP-4947-B[[footnote]][DATA LOST][[/footnote]]. [DATA LOST] the majority of doors in SCP-4947-B will not exit into the same place one enters from.\n\n[DATA[[size 0%]]She's gone.[[/size]] LOST]\n\n##red|**ADDENDUM [4947-A]:** SCP-4947 is a powerful a##[DATA LOST]##red|es are to be reported to Researcher Yarkoni as soon as possible.##[[footnote]]Whatever.
