The anomaly may be downloaded but after that the computer must be entirely quarantined.\n\nMETATRON.aic is to scan the internet for instances of SCP-7756, taking down any posting that includes the anomalous file.  Given the nature and content of the anomaly, this represents a significant threat to Normalcy and the continued operation of the Foundation behind the Veil Protocol.\n\nSCP-7756 must only be accessed by those with a high rating of memetic resistance; any researchers wanting to perform tests or access the anomaly must rate at least 4.9 on the Cognitive Resistance Value scale.\n\n++++ __Description__\nSCP-7756 is an online digital security seminar produced and distributed by GOI-5889 (“[[[vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]”) entitled “There’s No Place Like Home… Land Security.”  The anomaly has been found linked to a number of posts on Reddit and other social media sites in the context of digital security.  An account with username of VKTMNarrator has responded to numerous comments and posts on social media with links to the anomaly.  The storage of SCP-7756 has been difficult to locate, even with the use of AICs – the link appears as __[[span style=\"color:red\"]]homelandsecurity.vktm.org[[/span]]__, but no such website exists.\n\nThe content of the seminar includes sensitive data and images concerning the nature of the Veil in general and the SCP Foundation in specific.  More importantly, those who access the link and participate in the seminar are subject to a significant memetic compulsion to do as the seminar instructs.  Usually this results in completing the seminar without incident, but in one notable case it led to the arrest of a man in Detroit, Michigan for murder.\n@@ @@\n-----\n@@ @@\n++++ ADDENDUM 7756.1 – Testing Log\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background:#E2EBEF; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px; font-family: 'Palatino Linotype'\"]]\n\n//[Dr. Lillihammer[[footnote]]Highly resistant to memetics, Dr. Lillihammer has been assessed with a Cognitive Resistance Value so high  that she is practically immune to memetic effects.[[/footnote]] turns on the dedicated laptop and activates the link to SCP-7756, downloading the file, and then engaging the security protocols to air-gap the device from SCiPNet.

We at Vikander-Kneed Technical Media take digital security seriously, and we thought we could share with you our best practices.\n\n**Lillihammer**: What the… I know that voice.\n\n**Narrator**: No, you don’t!\n\n**Lillihammer**: Yes, I do.

Look, I don’t have all day and we’ve got at least forty-five more minutes left in this presentation before the quiz.  Can we get started?\n\n**Lillihammer**: There’s a quiz?\n\n**Narrator**: Of course, there’s a quiz!  How else are we supposed to know if you’ve learned the lessons of digital security?  Anything else? Or can I start?  \n\n**Lillihammer**: Go ahead.\n\n**Narrator**: Thank you. //[Clears throat.]// In order to reinforce the primary concepts of Digital Security, we’re going to cover six areas where we think //your// company’s practices can be improved…\n\n[[=]]\n//**Fifteen minutes of footage are omitted for brevity.**//\n[[/=]]\n\n//[When prompted, Lillihammer clicks through to the third slide.]//\n\n**Lillihammer**: What just happened?\n\n**Narrator**: Time moves when we’re having fun!\n\n**Lillihammer**: It took you a quarter hour to read less than a hundred words!\n\n**Narrator**: Next slide!\n\n[[=]]\n[[image http://scpdsandbox.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-i/VKTM%20Security%203]]\n[[/=]]\n\n//[Lillihammer sighs.

Neither the narrator nor Dr. Lillihammer speak during this period.  The slides contain the following information:  “1) Wrap the body in plastic tightly, several layers of food plastic wrap would be best.[[footnote]]A video of a comatose Dr. Alto Clef slowly being wrapped in thin sheets of plastic then bound in duct tape plays in this slide.[[/footnote]] 2) Using a serrated cutting implement, disconnect the feet, hands and head.[[footnote]]A pair of hands grip the body and places a [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacksaw | hacksaw]]] against the left ankle and then begins to saw back and forth until the limb is detached from the leg.  The video then plays through a montage of further cuts until both feet, hands and the head are detached.[[/footnote]] 3) Place the wrapped bundles in a bathtub or large plastic vat, pour hydrochloric acid over the top.[[footnote]]The video plays at ten times speed as the body parts are slowly dissolved.[[/footnote]]  4) Take the leftovers and mix with lye, then bury in your neighbor’s back yard. 5) Repeat.[[footnote]]A line of bodies is panned over, including Dr. William Wettle, Director Sophia Light, Dr. Dan ██████, and many others.[[/footnote]]”]//\n\n**Lillihammer**: Jesus, was that a threat?\n\n**Narrator**: What do you mean?\n\n**Lillihammer**: You’re using comatose or dead Foundation personnel of note as examples of how to dismember a fucking body.  So, is that a threat?  \n\n**Narrator**: Those were actors, VKTM makes entertainment not snuff films!\n\n**Lillihammer**: I’ve met Clef, that was Clef.  Granted, he’s unpleasant but this feels targeted.  \n\n**Narrator**: No no no.  Come on.  You’re suspending your disbelief a little too intensely, Lillian. \n\n**Lillihammer**: What are you talking about?\n\n**Narrator**: I’m going to the next slide.\n\n**Lillihammer**: No, explain what you meant.\n\n**Narrator**: Special effects!
