Taxonomically, it is closely related to the Promethea silkmoth (//Callosamia promethea//) and belongs to the subfamily Saturniidae. The larvae of SCP-097-KO feed on human organs as they grow and build large cocoon structures based on images of buildings stored in the host's brain tissue in the form of memories or imagination. The Foundation has periodically provided Class D hosts and large construction sites to maintain the population of SCP-097-KO post-containment. In this study, we have identified that SCP-097-KO adjusts its population size according to the surrounding environment - particularly the size of its habitat - and that it can successfully hatch and grow in a protein dummy with injected replicated brain cells. Based on these findings, we propose revised procedures that can significantly reduce the excessive resource consumption of the current containment protocol.[[/span]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family:돋움체; font-size:10pt\"]]**keyword:** SCP-097-KO, //Callosamia structura//, Safe, Organism, Insect, Ecology, Protocol Revision[[/span]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++ **Ⅰ. Introduction**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\nThe current special containment procedures for SCP-097-KO (//Callosamia structura//) have been in place since 1███ without significant issues. However, these procedures require the annual use of 25 Class D personnel, large tracts of land and multiple staff, leading to severe resource wastage. The lack of thorough biological research during SCP-097-KO's containment meant that the current procedures were established based on rough empirical knowledge rather than accurate research data on the SCP population. For more efficient containment, it is essential to conduct rigorous research to thoroughly analyse the subject's characteristics and revise the special containment procedures accordingly. Therefore, we have conducted an in-depth exploration of the biological and ecological characteristics of //Callosamia structura// and present our findings in this paper.\n\nThis paper also serves as a memorandum from the Scientific Department regarding SCP-097-KO's containment procedures revision. Based on our findings, we have proposed a revised version of the current special containment procedures, which is included in the conclusion section of this document.\n\nWe would like to take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude to several individuals and groups who made these achievements possible. Our heartfelt thanks go to Council Member O5-2, who provided unwavering support and made significant contributions by actively participating in the research; to Dr Bright and Dr Kondraki from human resources for their approval to use Class D personnel required for the experiments; to the researchers at Site-19 who offered invaluable assistance with human experimentation; to Researcher Hariuchi, who not only contributed to the research as an investigator but also ensured that language barriers did not hinder the research process and diligently translated this paper into nine languages; and finally, to the members of the Ethics Committee and the Scientific Department's Paper Review and Approval Committee, who provided the final review and approval of this paper.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++ **Ⅱ. Body**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ 1. Background information of SCP-097-KO\n\nSCP-097-KO (//Callosamia structura//) is a species of silkmoth that once inhabited a small area in the north-central region of Virginia, North America. Taxonomically, it belongs to the phylum Arthropoda, class Insecta, order Lepidoptera, family Saturniidae, genus //Callosamia//, with the species name //structura//. After securing a sample population, the extermination process was successfully carried out. As a result, there are currently no wild populations of //Callosamia structura//.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-imago-male.jpg\n|caption=Figure 1. Sketch of an adult male SCP-097-KO instance.|width=250px]]\n\nThe adult SCP-097-KO resembles the Promethea silkmoth (//Callosamia promethea//) in appearance and does not exhibit any notable anomalies besides its reproductive method. After mating, the adult SCP-097-KO lays multiple eggs inside the body of a nearby adult human (hereafter referred to as the host). The larvae hatch and grow for ten and a half months, feeding on the host's internal organs, including muscles and digestive organs. Despite the significant consumption of the host's internal organs as the larvae mature, the host maintains normal vital functions and can even easily carry out social activities. The mechanism by which SCP-097-KO maintains the host's bodily functions remains completely unknown, and there are no recorded observations of the larvae's activities and growth within the host's body.\n\nOnce fully grown, the larvae move up to the host's head and consume the entire brain. During this process, the host experiences excruciating pain and eventually dies, with the remains of the body also being used as nutrients by the larvae. After consuming the brain, the SCP-097-KO larvae exit through a hole in the skull and begin their metamorphosis.\n\nThe SCP-097-KO larvae that emerge from the host split into two groups: the excavators and the builders. During metamorphosis, the SCP-097-KO uses cocoons to construct a structure based on a building the host previously envisioned. This appears to be a form of camouflage designed to help them survive the vulnerable pupation stage. During this process, all excavators die, but the builders successfully undergo metamorphosis, forming the next generation.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ 2. Current Special Containment Procedures for SCP-097-KO\n\nBefore proceeding with the research, this paper will analyse the current special containment procedures to establish the focus of the study. The following is an excerpt from the special containment procedures section of the current SCP-097-KO report copy^^[((bibcite 097KO))]^^:\n\n> All wild SCP-097-KO specimens must be exterminated except for the twenty-five (25) population groups in captivity for breeding. The SCP-097-KO containment breeding wing, an auxiliary facility of Site-19, must always be maintained at room temperature, and each group must be allocated a habitat area of 2 km^^2^^. The height of each breeding wing must be at least 9 meters. During the metamorphosis period, Foundation personnel must continuously monitor to ensure that SCP-097-KO adults do not escape from the breeding wing.\n> \n> Every May, when SCP-097-KO engages in mating, one Class D personnel is introduced into each breeding wing.  Class D personnel are instructed to draw a \"house\" under the pretence of a psychological test, and the individual who draws the most ordinary and conventional house is selected. When introducing Class D personnel into the breeding wing, they must be gagged and have their limbs restrained to prevent resistance. Additionally, sufficient nutrients must be provided intravenously for the 11-month growth period of the larvae.\n> \n> After approximately one month of pupation, once the SCP-097-KO larvae have completed metamorphosis, containment team personnel are deployed to dismantle the collapsed cocoon structures. Since mating occurs again within a week, the following Class D personnel must be introduced immediately.\n\nThe current procedures, as outlined above, consistently require the use of 25 Class D personnel annually. Given the recent trend of decreasing availability of Class D personnel, this fixed expenditure will likely cause a significant burden on personnel procurement. Moreover, the Ethics Committee has issued guidelines to minimise the use of Class D personnel if alternative materials can be used^^[((bibcite e1))]^^. Therefore, exploring options to replace or reduce human resource consumption, including Class D personnel, is crucial.\n\nAdditionally, the current procedures allocate over 50 km^^2^^ of land to maintain 25 groups. However, SCP-097-KO only utilises the full 2 km^^2^^ of space during the one month when it constructs its cocoon and prepares for metamorphosis. Considering that the larvae are spatially restricted within the host's body during the 11-month larval stage, this represents a significant waste of space.\n\nBased on the above analysis, the team has decided to focus on the following aspects of the research on SCP-097-KO:\n* Exploration of environments outside the human body where SCP-097-KO can grow or investigate the potential for recycling hosts.\n* Estimation of the minimum containment area required that does not hinder SCP-097-KO's growth and reproduction.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++ **Ⅲ. Research Plans**\n[[/=]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ 1. Basic Ecological Research\n++++ 1.1. Observation of SCP-097-KO Ecology\n* Observe the currently contained groups for one year to collect various primary data. Particular focus is placed on exploring anomalous characteristics such as spawning, growth, and cocoon construction to supplement previously insufficient information.\n++++ 1.2. Research of SCP-097-KO's ability to control its host\n* As the SCP-097-KO larvae grow, they consume the host's internal organs. Despite this, the host can lead an almost everyday life until the larvae fully mature and move towards the brain. For further investigation, SCP-097-KO eggs were inserted into eight Class D personnel, and the behaviour of the SCP-097-KO larvae was observed. The insertion sites include the muscles (arm), the nervous system (spinal cord), and other places throughout the body.\n+++ 2. Host Research\n++++ 2.1. Host Recycling Research\n* By blocking the larvae's movement to the brain, whether one host can support multiple breeding cycles is studied.\n++++ 2.2. Non-human Replacement Host Research\n* Various non-human hosts for breeding, such as animals or dummies made of various materials, are provided. The growth of SCP-097-KO populations within the replacement hosts is observed, ruling out potential replacements.\n+++ 3. Research for spatial optimisation\n++++ 3.1. Observation of SCP-097-KO adaptation relative to breeding ground space\n* Three groups are placed in differently sized breeding grounds, 1 km^^2^^, 10,000 m^^2^^, and 100 m^^2^^, respectively. Each SCP-097-KO group's responses are observed and compared to the group's within contemporarily sized breeding grounds.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++ **Ⅳ. Results**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ 1. Basic Ecological Research\n\n++++ 1.1. Observation of SCP-097-KO Ecology\n\nLike the typical //Callosamia promethea//, SCP-097-KO is holometabolistic, passing through the egg, larva, pupa (cocoon), and adult stages. While this was already known, the study provided additional detailed information regarding the larval stage. It was observed that SCP-097-KO larvae also grow through several moults, during which their anomalous properties gradually increase.\n\nSCP-097-KO adults mate in early May. While the mating behaviour is similar to that of other insects in the same genus, the location where the fertilised female lays its eggs is, as widely known, the human body. The female SCP-097-KO possesses a sharp ovipositor at the end of its abdomen, similar to that of a parasitic wasp, designed to pierce the skin of mammals. Using this ovipositor, the female lays approximately 350,000 eggs inside a human body. They typically select a sleeping human as the host, likely to avoid interference during spawning.\n\nObservation revealed that the female SCP-097-KO does not lay all its eggs in one location but distributes them across four different body areas. The most preferred sites are areas with dense muscle mass, particularly the shoulders, where an average of 200,000 eggs are deposited. In all cases, it was confirmed that at least 10,000 eggs are laid near the spinal cord.\n\nSCP-097-KO eggs are tiny, with an average diameter of 500 μm, allowing them to be quickly injected into the host's internal organs through the ovipositor. Each egg travels through the bloodstream for approximately three minutes before settling in an internal organ. This process is believed to prevent the eggs from clustering and ensure that each individual has sufficient space for its activity.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-larva-1.jpg\n|caption=Figure 2. Sketch of 1st instar SCP-097-KO larvae. (×10)|width=200px]]\n\nAbout 30 days after the eggs are laid, all SCP-097-KO within the host simultaneously hatch from their eggs (1st instar larvae). During this process, the host may experience mild pain, but it quickly subsides due to the tramadol hydrochloride and lidocaine secreted in trace amounts by SCP-097-KO. The average body length of the 1st instar larvae is 1 mm, and they are white. (Fig. 2)\n\nThe 1st instar larvae remain where they hatched, feeding on the host's organs for approximately five months. The amount of tissue consumed by the 1st instar larvae is within the host's capacity for recovery, so the host does not notice any significant abnormalities. As a result, the 1st instar larval stage of SCP-097-KO becomes a \"latent period\" lethal to the host.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-larva-2.jpg\n|caption=Figure 3. Sketch of 2nd instar SCP-097-KO larvae. (×5)|width=200px]]\n\nAt five months of age, SCP-097-KO moults and grows into 2nd instar larvae. Observations indicate that the larvae consume their moulted skin to replenish nutrients after moulting. During this stage, SCP-097-KO larvae typically burrow into the subcutaneous fat layer, making them nearly impossible to detect with the naked eye. However, as the larvae increase in size to 3 mm and begin to move slightly within the host's body, the host experiences a significant sense of foreignness and itching for several days following the moult. These symptoms are alleviated as the larvae grow and their lidocaine secretion increases.\n\nThe 2nd instar larvae require approximately twice the energy of the 1st instar, increasing the burden on the host's body. The host's food intake begins to rise, and it is common for a mild dysfunction in some organ functions to occur. Additionally, the spindles, which play a significant role in the anomalous properties of larval SCP-097-KO, first appear during this stage. However, the 2nd instar larvae spindles are immature and do not yet function.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-larva-3.jpg\n|caption=Figure 4. Sketch of 3rd instar SCP-097-KO larvae. (×2)|width=200px]]\n\nAt around six months of age, SCP-097-KO moults again, becoming 3rd instar larvae like their previous moult. The 3rd instar larvae grow rapidly to about 1 cm in length, occupying a significant volume within the host's body. As a result, the host's body bloats, and body weight increases compared to before the infestation. From this stage onward, SCP-097-KO larvae use two pairs of spindles located on the second and third segments to exert localised control over the host's body parts. Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, as no chemical substances or electrical signals have been detected, the fact that removing these spindles prevents the larvae from displaying this anomalous behaviour strongly suggests that these spindles play a central role in the process. Additionally, the spindles appear to be used for communication between individual larvae.\n\nUtilising this control ability, SCP-097-KO larvae gradually adjust the host's body to better accommodate their development. The larvae positioned near the spinal cord play a crucial role in this process by interfering with the communication between the brain and peripheral nervous system, distorting certain information. Blood test results suggest that they manipulate neural signals and the host's endocrine system. As a result, the host experiences significant hunger, leading to increased food intake, while the recovery rate of the organs consumed by SCP-097-KO accelerates dramatically.\n\nThe 3rd instar stage is also when the range of movement for SCP-097-KO larvae expands significantly. At this point, the larvae seem to place less importance on remaining at their hatching site. Instead, they congregate around organs like the liver, where rapid recovery and nutrients are more easily obtained. However, the larvae initially settle near the spine and remain mostly stationary, staying near the neck area to continue manipulating the host. As a result, the host's neck becomes almost filled with SCP-097-KO larvae, except for the space occupied by the organs. This causes the host to experience severe neck stiffness.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-larva-4.jpg\n|caption=Figure 5. Sketch of 4th instar SCP-097-KO larvae. (×1.5)|width=200px]]\n\nSCP-097-KO larvae undergo another moulting process at seven months of age and develop into 4th instar larvae. By this stage, the host's body is almost entirely under the control of SCP-097-KO. The transmission speed of neural signals slightly decreases, causing the host to struggle with intense physical activity, and reflex responses become noticeably weakened. Certain actions, such as attempts to remove the larvae, are completely inhibited by SCP-097-KO, as the larvae block the command signals from the brain. However, as long as the survival of the larvae is not threatened, SCP-097-KO transmits most of the brain's commands to the body without interference, leaving the host utterly unaware of the situation.\n\nHowever, despite SCP-097-KO increasingly taking control of the body, the host's physical condition deteriorates as the host's organs are consumed by the SCP-097-KO group, eventually reaching a critical point. Organs such as the liver, the primary food source, become irreparably damaged. Interestingly, even when the host's life is threatened due to these issues, the SCP-097-KO group is capable of successfully keeping the host alive. For further details on this phenomenon, refer to Study 1.2.\n\nThe 4th instar larvae reach a body length of 3 cm, making them 30 times larger than the 1st instar larvae. This significant increase in size explains why the host's body continues to enlarge, even though some larvae die during the growth process. In some cases, the movement of SCP-097-KO larvae can be visibly observed wriggling beneath the host's skin.\n\nBefore progressing to the 5th instar, around 290 days after hatching, the SCP-097-KO group manipulates the host's neural signals, knocking the host unconscious and relocating the host. The fact that the host is moved to the most isolated part of the containment area suggests that this behaviour is intended to isolate the host from society, facilitating the construction of the cocoon structure and metamorphosis. If the host cannot move, the SCP-097-KO group exhibits different responses depending on the situation. In an experiment where five groups were restrained during the late 4th instar stage, three groups chose to progress to the 5th instar at the place where the host was restrained. In comparison, the remaining two groups, whose hosts were relatively healthy, severed the host's restrained limbs and then moved the host by crawling. This behaviour indicates that SCP-097-KO possesses a collective intelligence capable of assessing situations and responding accordingly.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/scp-097-ko-larva-5.jpg\n|caption=Figure 6. Sketch of 5th instar SCP-097-KO larvae.|width=200px]]\n\nAbout nine and a half months after hatching, SCP-097-KO moults into 5th instar larvae and primes itself for metamorphosis. During this stage, the larvae become barely active, focusing on accumulating the nutrients needed for cocoon construction. As a result, the host becomes severely debilitated. This occurs because the larvae, which had been maintaining the functions of the already failing organs, cease their support, and the remaining organs are fully consumed. Notably, Study 2.1 revealed that when the host's health is in a particularly poor condition, some larvae remain in the 4th instar to assist in keeping the host alive. By this stage, the host has been moved to a location where it is challenging to seek help, making resistance against the SCP-097-KO group impossible.\n\nThe 5th instar larvae, which reach a body length of 4 cm, have the front three to four segments noticeably swollen in a deformed manner. Dissection revealed that these segments are filled with a viscous fluid resembling cement. Component analysis showed that this fluid has the same composition as the material used in the completed SCP-097-KO cocoon structures, indicating that it serves as stored material for constructing these structures.\n\nAfter about a week, when the host is on the verge of starvation, the larvae simultaneously move towards the host's head. The larvae then consume the host's brain tissue entirely, though only about 15% of the entire group feed on the brain tissue. The majority of these larvae are those that initially hatched near the spine.\n\nOnce the brain is destroyed and the host dies, the SCP-097-KO larvae consume the remaining corpse. After this, as is known, the SCP-097-KO larvae split into two groups to begin preparations for construction.\n\nTypically, by this stage, an average of 290,000 larvae survive. Of these, approximately 34% (around 100,000 larvae) become the excavators, while 66% (around 190,000 larvae) become the builders. The exact ratio between these groups can vary depending on the design of the cocoon structure.\n\nThe excavators do not undergo pupation but instead deform their bodies in specific ways: their legs transform into sturdy hooks, and their dorsal areas swell. Dissection revealed that these swollen dorsal areas contain significant amounts of explosive materials, including nitroglycerin. The excavator larvae use these explosives to create large-scale explosions, clearing the ground and preparing underground spaces. They typically dig several layers deeper than the number of underground floors specified in the structure's design, providing a foundational space for the builders to construct underground supports. As is expected, all the larvae in the excavator group perish in the explosion.\n\nThe explosions caused by the excavator group are extremely powerful, capable of breaking through soil and bedrock and producing intense heat and light flashes. However, the associated noise and vibrations are remarkably minimal. The precise mechanism behind this phenomenon remains unknown and has not been explored further, as it falls outside the scope of this paper. Further research is necessary to address these physical anomalies.\n\nThe larvae of the builder group do not exhibit the unusual physical changes seen in the excavator group when they enter the metamorphosis stage. These larvae remain inside the host's body longer than the excavator group, consuming the host's corpse to accumulate the necessary nutrients for cocoon construction. This extended stay also appears to be a strategy to avoid being caught up in the excavator group's explosive activities, which could otherwise result in their deaths.\n\nOnce the excavator group's explosive work has prepared the ground and underground space, the builder larvae complete their consumption of the host (or sometimes stop midway) and move to the designated location to begin cocoon construction. This process unfolds very calmly over an extended period, with each SCP-097-KO larva precisely locating itself and constructing a cocoon in the exact shape required for the structure. On average, each larva produces a cocoon with a volume of 30,000 cm³, using up to 300 grams of silk. This volume is several times larger than the cocoons of related species and even exceeds the mass of the 5th instar SCP-097-KO larvae themselves. It is suspected that some form of ectentropic factor may be involved, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. Further research is necessary to explore this phenomenon.\n\nThe method by which individual SCP-097-KO larvae construct their cocoons is not significantly different from other silk moths. However, as is well known, the entire SCP-097-KO group collectively creates a single, cohesive architectural structure based on the information stored in the host's brain. As previously mentioned, only about 15% of the larvae directly consume the host's brain, so they are assumed to share information about the overall design and their roles in the construction through their spindles.\n\nThe structure's construction follows the same sequence as typical human construction processes: ground preparation and pillar erection, followed by wall construction and roof installation. SCP-097-KO larvae patiently wait their turn to contribute to the process to ensure the successful completion of the structure. Experimental observations revealed that during this waiting period, the larvae are vulnerable to predators and can be easily hunted without resistance.\n\nOnce the cocoon layers in their designated area are complete, the larvae climb up the structure and begin constructing their cocoons. As previously mentioned, the method of cocoon construction is not significantly different from that of typical Saturniidae insects, but the material produced by SCP-097-KO larvae is more akin to cement than silk. This material is the same as that discovered during the dissection of 5th instar larvae. Depending on the structure's design, this material can take on the appearance of wood or metal, though its composition and physical properties remain unchanged. Each larva takes approximately one hour to complete its cocoon, and the entire group takes about two weeks to finish constructing the structure, including the explosive groundwork done by the excavator group.\n\nThe elaborate and complex process by which SCP-097-KO constructs its massive cocoon structures is presumably intended to protect the vulnerable pupal stage from external threats. However, this strategy raises some questions, considering that SCP-097-KO's pupal stage lasts only a few weeks and that the larvae are fully exposed to dangers during construction. This construction behaviour's highly deliberate and intricate nature seems too intentional to have merely evolved by chance. Therefore, it is suspected that there is an unknown reason behind SCP-097-KO's behaviour.\n\nOnce the structure is completed, the SCP-097-KO larvae begin pupation within their cocoons. The pupal stage lasts approximately two weeks, during which time the SCP-097-KO cocoon structure remains as sturdy as an ordinary building. Although the functionality of the cocoon structures varies greatly depending on the design, in most cases, they are constructed with such a high level of precision that they are suitable for human habitation.\n\nAs evidenced by the first recorded instance of an SCP-097-KO cocoon structure, [DATA EXPUNGED], setting the structure on fire during this stage results in the death of all internal entities while leaving behind a sturdy building. Some Native American tribes, aware of SCP-097-KO's anomalous properties, appear to have utilised this knowledge to construct such structures, with [DATA EXPUNGED] being one such example. Except for [DATA EXPUNGED], these structures have since been demolished. For detailed records of the buildings that have been discovered and demolished, refer to the official report^^[((bibcite 097KO))]^^.\n\nAfter two weeks, when the SCP-097-KO entities begin to emerge as adults, the cocoon structure collapses with significant vibrations. Many SCP-097-KO adults, especially those who had built their cocoons in the underground or lower levels, die during this process. It is suspected that such high mortality in this process kept the wild SCP-097-KO population stable despite the high survival rate of its larvae compared to other species.\n\nThe lifespan of an SCP-097-KO adult is about one week. During this time, the SCP-097-KO entities engage in mating and spawning as described above. The short adult stage is likely one of the reasons why SCP-097-KO did not spread widely and was limited to Virginia and its vicinity.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n++++ 1.2. Research of SCP-097-KO's ability to control its host\n\nAside from constructing the cocoon structures, the most intriguing aspect of SCP-097-KO's anomalous properties is its ability to control and maintain the functions of the host's body. This paper is keen to refer to this as an \"ability\" based on a series of experimental results presented later. The following experiments were conducted the year after completing Study 1.1, where SCP-097-KO eggs were artificially implanted into specific body parts and allowed to grow. Through the manipulation of several impressive variables, these experiments were able to shed light on SCP-097-KO's anomalous abilities.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment Setup** _\n _\nA total of eight Class D personnel were implanted with SCP-097-KO eggs. Four individuals (D-1022, D-1023, D-1024, D-1025) received 5,000 eggs implanted into the left antebrachial muscles, while one individual (D-1506) had 5,000 eggs implanted into the spinal cord. The remaining three individuals (D-1509, D-1510, D-1511) were allowed to develop a typical population of SCP-097-KO through the natural spawning process by adult SCP-097-KO, resulting in the standard distribution of larvae throughout their bodies. Initially, direct insertion to the brain was attempted, but since all larvae invariably migrated to the spinal cord, only spinal cord experiments were conducted. The larvae within each host were allowed to grow to the 3rd instar stage for seven months. For those Class D personnel with SCP-097-KO implanted in specific areas, regular examinations were conducted to remove any larvae that had migrated outside the designated implantation site. Depending on the requirements, some experiments were conducted after allowing the larvae to reach the 4th instar stage. _\nClass D personnel involved in the experiments were preconditioned with drug administration and other measures to render them docile. Initially, only hosts with SCP-097-KO implanted in the central nervous system were equipped with electrodes for brainwave analysis. However, after Experiment 1-2, EEG testing was conducted in all experiments. _\n _\nTo prevent the SCP-097-KO group from learning from the experiment results, all Class D personnel and SCP-097-KO larvae used in this experiment were incinerated after the experiment.\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1-1: Resistance to Host's Actions** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:**  D-1022, infested with 3rd instar larvae, is provided with tools such as a scalpel and saw and instructed to amputate the parasitised left arm. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Since the central nervous system, including the spinal cord, has not been taken over, it is uncertain whether the larvae can effectively control the host. It is expected that some form of response would be made to ensure the group's survival, but the exact details is to be determined through the experiment. _\n _\n**Results:** Upon receiving the command, D-1022 began to mutilate his left arm with a scalpel. This caused significant damage to the veins, leading to heavy bleeding, and some SCP-097-KO larvae were expelled out of the body by the haemorrhage and died. The SCP-097-KO group belatedly attempted to stop the bleeding while simultaneously taking control of the nervous system in the left arm to evade D-1022's attacks. Following this, D-1022 was unable to inflict further injuries on the left arm but died three hours later due to excessive blood loss. _\nAfter the host died, SCP-097-KO instances crawled out of the left arm and thrashed around for several hours. However, they could not take any effective action and eventually expired. _\n _\n**Analysis:**  It is confirmed that SCP-097-KO can locally manipulate motor nerves even without taking control of the central nervous system. However, the fact that SCP-097-KO failed to anticipate D-1022's self-harm attempt and that the host's death ultimately led to the death of the entire group indicates that SCP-097-KO did not effectively control the host in this experiment. Whether this failure was due to the limited parasitic range or the insufficient control power of the 3rd instar larvae must be clarified through subsequent experiments.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n* **Experiment 1-2: Resistance to Host's Actions** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** D-1023, infested with 4th instar larvae, is provided with tools such as a scalpel and saw and instructed to amputate the parasitised left arm. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Like Experiment 1-1, active response is expected to be limited due to the lack of control over the central nervous system. However, considering that the host control abilities of the 4th instar larvae are more developed than those of the 3rd instar stage, the exact outcome is difficult to predict. Dr. Gears speculated that the results would be similar to those of Experiment 1-1, while O5-2 anticipated that SCP-097-KO would manage a more successful response. _\n _\n**Results:** D-1023, holding a saw and scalpel in each hand, hesitated briefly before gripping the scalpel with the right hand and attempting to stab the left hand. The first strike penetrated deeply into the left arm, but SCP-097-KO's manipulation caused the second strike to miss, and the left arm was used to grasp the right wrist, preventing further self-harm. It was observed that the larvae initiated haemostasis. _\n _\nWhen D-1023 found it difficult to inflict harm using the saw as he could not move his hands, he began rubbing his left arm against the saw on the ground. Judging that self-harm was challenging with the saw lying down, D-4001 was introduced to assist by propping up the saw. D-1023 then attempted to bring the left arm to the saw blade. However, at this point, D-1023 ceased all movement and was unable to continue the self-harm attempt until the experiment concluded. Subsequent examination revealed that the SCP-097-KO group had moved from the left antebrachial muscles to the spinal cord. _\n _\n**Analysis:** Although D-1023 hesitated at the start of the experiment, SCP-097-KO demonstrated significantly quicker and more precise responses compared to Experiment 1-1. Additionally, the fact that the entire group of larvae rapidly relocated to a different parasitic site and successfully seized control of the host's bodily functions was an impressive outcome, exceeding expectations. This suggests that the SCP-097-KO group possesses a considerable level of collective intelligence. _\n Given that SCP-097-KO has demonstrated the ability to relocate and change roles in response to external stimuli, it has been decided that all future experiments include brainwave analysis, regardless of the parasitic location of the SCP-097-KO group.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1-3: Resistance to Host's Actions** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** D-1026, infested with 4th instar larvae, is provided with tools such as a scalpel and saw and instructed to amputate his left arm. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Although the SCP-097-KO entities are not directly parasitising the arm, considering their reliance on the host's survival, it is expected that the SCP-097-KO group would intervene to prevent any self-harm attempts by the host. Given that SCP-097-KO has secured control of the host's central nervous system, it is anticipated that any self-harm attempt will be easily thwarted. _\n _\n**Results:** Upon receiving the command, D-1506 requested that the research team provide a meat cutter. Once provided, D-1506 promptly used the cutter to sever the left arm without hesitation. The SCP-097-KO group belatedly attempted emergency measures, such as stopping the bleeding, but these efforts were largely ineffective, and D-1506 died within a few minutes. EEG readings indicated that after the amputation, D-1506 accepted death without further thought or command. An autopsy revealed that approximately 3,500 SCP-097-KO entities had moved to the severed area of the left arm, attempting haemostasis by expanding their bodies. _\n _\n**Analysis:** It was observed that SCP-097-KO does not exert sufficient control over the host when in a partial parasitic state. Despite the SCP-097-KO group's ability to intercept and manipulate the host's neural signals, they were unable to prevent the self-harm attempt, which suggests that the entities are unable to fully interpret or understand human brain signals.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1-4: Resistance to Host's Actions** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** D-1509, infested with 3rd instar larvae throughout the body, is provided with tools such as a scalpel, saw, and cutter and instructed to amputate the left arm, one of the parasitised organs. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Given that SCP-097-KO has secured control over the host's entire body, it is expected that any self-harm attempt will be easily prevented. _\n _\n**Results:** D-1509 examined the various tools before selecting the saw and making a small cut on the left arm. However, the action soon ceased, and D-1509 remained unresponsive until the tools were retrieved. EEG signals confirmed that the brain continued to issue commands to move the muscles, but these signals were not transmitted to the nervous system below the spinal cord. _\n _\n**Analysis:** It has been determined that under normal circumstances, SCP-097-KO can suppress any sudden actions by the host that threaten the group starting from the 3rd instar stage. When correlated with Experiment 1-3 findings, it suggests that SCP-097-KO does not interpret the host's neural signals to respond but rather collects motor information from the SCP-097-KO larvae present in the affected area. Consequently, it was concluded that further experiments on the 4th instar stage were unnecessary and were not conducted. _\n _\n**Note:** After the experiment was completed, the Ethics Committee issued a warning about protecting D-Class personnel and conserving resources. Following a meeting between O5-2 and the Ethics Committee, it was confirmed that this experiment was deemed significantly necessary for the research on SCP-097-KO.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 2. Resistance to Host bodily damage** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** To understand how SCP-097-KO responds to a host's organ loss, a significant portion of D-1510's left trapezius muscle was surgically removed. This was intended to model the scenario in which SCP-097-KO consumes the host's organs, with the external muscle chosen to allow direct observation of the affected area. The wound was then monitored to observe the response of the 3rd instar SCP-097-KO group. Additional instructions were given to assess how the larvae compensate for the lost organ function. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Under normal circumstances, even when the host's organs are consumed as food, there are typically no significant impairments to the organ functions or the host's overall physical condition. Therefore, it is expected that the removal of the muscle in this experiment will likewise not result in any substantial disruption. _\n _\n**Results:** When attempting to remove D-1510's trapezius muscle, D-1510 reacted with extreme resistance despite the same precautions taken in previous experiments. D-1510's brainwave patterns and facial expressions indicated that his own will did not drive this resistance. After restraining him with additional restraints, the procedure was completed. _\nAs the bleeding began, several SCP-097-KO larvae were observed being expelled with the blood, and the bleeding stopped after 3 minutes. D-1510 showed no signs of excessive blood loss or shock. Upon examining the wound, it was observed that the SCP-097-KO larvae in the affected area had expanded their bodies to suppress the bleeding, similar to what was seen in Experiment 1-3. Periodic component analysis of the wound site revealed that D-1510's body had increased platelet production and promoted muscle recovery. This response also occurred without any corresponding commands detected in D-1510's brainwave signals. Further examination with additional electrodes revealed that these commands were being issued from the upper spinal cord. _\nD-1510 was instructed to lift his left arm before the excised area had fully healed to understand how the function of the lost organ was being compensated. During the initial attempts, D-1510 complained of mild pain and could not perform the task. After several repeated attempts, a group of SCP-097-KO larvae emerged from D-1510's left shoulder, biting into both the host's wound and each other to artificially replicate the missing muscle structure. Some larvae also reinforced this structure by producing silk to secure it in place. Once this process was completed, D-1510 attempted the command again and, though with some difficulty, successfully managed to lift his arm. _\nThree weeks after the experiment was completed, D-1510's shoulder fully healed. _\n _\n**Analysis:** Due to the active intervention of SCP-097-KO, D-1510's wound healed at an abnormally rapid pace. Across all these experiments, SCP-097-KO appeared to obtain situational information not from the host's biological signals but rather from other group members. _\nThis experiment revealed that SCP-097-KO can hijack the host's nerves and neurotransmitters in the neck, allowing it to issue complex commands that enhance the host's recovery speed. It was even confirmed that the larvae can temporarily replace the functions of the host's organs. Considering these findings, SCP-097-KO larvae can manipulate the host's recovery mechanisms and support the functions of the consumed organs, enabling them to maintain the host's bodily functions while feeding on the host's organs.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 3. Amputation of parasitised organ** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** The experiment involves observing the response of the SCP-097-KO 3rd instar larvae group when a body part they inhabit (in this case, D-1511's right arm) is completely separated from the host's body. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** The outcome of this experiment is difficult to predict. Considering SCP-097-KO's remarkable ability to manipulate the host, the larvae may attempt to restore the separated body part. However, since the limb would be physically severed and its function lost, it is uncertain whether this can be achieved. Given that a significantly larger number of SCP-097-KO larvae would be separated from the main body of the host compared to previous experiments, it is anticipated that they may attempt a more aggressive recovery effort. _\n _\n**Results:** Following the procedure in Experiment 2, D-1511 was restrained, and the right forearm was severed using a cutter. Immediately after the amputation, the SCP-097-KO group within the forearm exhibited intense movement. For the first few minutes, it appeared the larvae attempted to reattach the severed limb as they crawled out from both cut surfaces, biting into each other to bridge the gap. However, when it became apparent that reattachment was not possible, the larvae in the severed forearm collectively began to escape. While some succeeded in returning to the body of the host, the majority failed to travel far outside the body and died. _\n _\n**Analysis:** This experiment confirmed the limitations of SCP-097-KO's ability to promote recovery. Additionally, it was observed that the larvae that emerged from the host's body survived for only a few tens of seconds outside the host.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n+++ 2. Host Research\n\n++++ 2.1. Host Recycling Research\n\nThe direct cause of host death due to SCP-097-KO is the loss of the cerebrum, diencephalon, medulla, and other critical brain structures. Based on this, it is hypothesised that if the destruction of the host's brain can be prevented during the SCP-097-KO's emergence process, it might be possible to reuse a previously utilised host for future parasitism.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1. Blockage of body-to-brain passage of larvae** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** The neck of D-1528, parasitised by 4th instar larvae, was carefully severed, ensuring that the nerves, blood vessels, and airway remain connected while separating the head from the body. The head is then fixed at a slight distance from the body to prevent the SCP-097-KO larvae from migrating to the host's brain while ensuring the host's survival. Nutrients are provided via an IV drip, and a prefrontal lobotomy is performed on D-1528 beforehand to prevent resistance to the experiment. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** The fact that no successful experiments have been conducted where the head of a higher primate has been separated from its body remains a concern^^[((bibcite a))]^^. However, if the host can be kept alive in this decapitated state, the experiment itself is expected to proceed successfully. _\nHowever, Dr. Aura expressed concerns that \"if SCP-097-KO cannot consume the host's brain, it may be unable to construct its cocoon structures, potentially leading to a significant loss of its wild nature and anomalous properties.\" Even if the experiment is successful, a thorough feasibility review is necessary before incorporating the results into the containment procedures. _\n _\n**Results:** As the separation procedure was nearing completion, the SCP-097-KO larvae group finished moulting into the 5th instar stage. D-1528's physical condition remained stable, and it was observed that some larvae remained in the 4th instar stage to assist in maintaining D-1528's survival. Until the conclusion of the experiment, D-1528 remained in a generally healthy state, aside from experiencing severe starvation. _\nAfter six days, the SCP-097-KO group detected the problem. Unable to move through the neck, the larvae spent an entire day moving chaotically throughout the host's body. On the seventh day, at 2:11 PM, five larvae attempted to move along the spinal cord and trachea. Although the researchers removed these larvae, the group began moving in unison. When it became impossible to prevent their movement, the research team decided to sever D-1528's nerves, trachea, and blood vessels, fully separating the head from the body. The larvae were initially confused and crawled out of the host's body. (Researcher Hariuchi described this as resembling \"a mass of caterpillars from \"//Hope for the Flowers//\".\") While the body of D-1528 continued to function due to the remaining 4th instar larvae, the 5th instar group did not survive and perished. _\n _\n**Analysis:** It is concluded that SCP-097-KO must consume the host's brain tissue to undergo metamorphosis successfully.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n++++ 2.2. Non-human Replacement Host Research\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1. Primate experiment** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** SCP-097-KO is parasitised on the bodies of bonobos, orangutans, and chimpanzees instead of humans. Each group is then matured under the same conditions previously applied to Class D personnel. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Considering the ecology of SCP-097-KO, there should be no significant issues during the larval stage. However, it is uncertain whether the brains of apes, which have significantly less understanding and knowledge of artificial structures than humans, will be suitable for SCP-097-KO's cocoon structure construction. _\n _\n**Results:** The SCP-097-KO larvae groups survived and developed into 5th instar larvae as in human hosts. However, upon entering the metamorphosis stage and consuming the host's brain, all three groups failed to construct cocoon structures and subsequently died. The exact cause of this failure remains unknown. _\n _\n**Analysis:** It is concluded that SCP-097-KO must consume human brain tissue to successfully undergo metamorphosis.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 2. Protein Dummy using cloned brain cells and [[[SCP-427]]]** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** SCP-097-KO larvae are raised on a protein dummy modelled after the human body. Human brain cells are cloned and injected into the area corresponding to the head, and SCP-427 is applied for 1 minute to regenerate the brain tissue. The experiment is conducted in three separate groups to ensure stability. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** The brain's ability to store information relies on synaptic connections between neurons rather than the neurons themselves. If the application of SCP-427 is effective, it is presumed that fragmented architectural information stored in the injected brain cells could be transmitted to SCP-097-KO. However, whether the brain tissue will regenerate sufficiently to achieve this remains uncertain. _\n _\n**Results:** The protein dummies were created using Dr. Isaac Stark's method^^[((bibcite i))]^^, producing a total of three units. The brain of D-1528, extracted in a previous experiment, was broken down at the cellular level and replicated into three samples, each injected into one of the dummies. Nutrients were supplied to each dummy, and SCP-427 was applied for 1 minute. Subsequent EEG tests confirmed that most brain functions, excluding the frontal lobe, had been successfully revived. _\n _\nSCP-097-KO eggs were implanted into each dummy and raised for 315 days, with a continuous supply of nutrient solution provided to the dummies. After 312 days, the 5th instar larvae group in Dummy 2 began migrating to the brain. This group successfully consumed the brain and constructed the cocoon structure without issue. Subsequently, the larvae groups in Dummy 1 and Dummy 3 also completed their metamorphosis. _\n _\n**Analysis:** The experiment demonstrated that SCP-097-KO can be successfully raised using artificially replicated and restored brain tissue. Incorporating this method into the containment procedures could significantly reduce the need for human resources, leading to a breakthrough in resource conservation. _\n _\n**Note:** A review was requested for the Ethics Committee due to steps similar to human cloning in the experimental process. The review concluded that the SCP Foundation does not prohibit human cloning^^[((bibcite 222))]^^, and in this case, since the process does not result in the full realisation of brain functions or self-awareness, there are no issues. However, considering the potential risks associated with the cloning of Class D personnel, the Ethics Committee adopted a resolution stating that the use of protein dummies and SCP-427 for artificial body creation is permitted only for pre-approved purposes, such as the production of hosts for SCP-097-KO.^^[((bibcite e2))]^^ _\nAdditionally, Dr. Aura's concern that SCP-097-KO may lose its ability to control hosts if raised in an environment lacking resistance over an extended period was acknowledged. As a result, the revised containment procedures include the direct use of Class D personnel for some of the SCP-097-KO groups.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n++ 3. Research for spatial optimisation\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n+++ 1. Observation of SCP-097-KO adaptation relative to breeding ground space\n\nThe following experiments are conducted to check whether SCP-097-KO can adjust its group and structure size depending on the size of the breeding site. All three experiments were conducted with a host dummy and a pair of male and female adult SCP-097-KO instances put within the breeding ground. All three experiments were conducted simultaneously to shorten the experiment time.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 1. 1 km^^2^^ Breeding Site** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** An SCP-097-KO group is raised within a 1 km^^2^^ wide breeding site, half of what is currently provided. The height of the site is 9 metres. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** The average base area of the cocoon structures built by SCP-097-KO in the current containment facilities is 1.2 km², with the largest recorded structure covering up to 1.95 km². However, in most cases, the structures typically fall just below or around 1 km², so the group is expected to successfully construct their cocoon structure without significant issues in the reduced space. _\n _\n**Results:** The SCP-097-KO group spent 312 days in the larval stage before constructing their cocoon structure, which had a base area of 0.6 km^^2^^. The structure was subsequently incinerated and demolished.  _\n _\n**Analysis:** Observations revealed that the structure built by the SCP-097-KO group in the 1 km^^2^^ area was significantly smaller than those constructed in the 2 km^^2^^ area. Although the number of experiments conducted is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions, it is hypothesised that SCP-097-KO may be able to adjust the size of its structures based on the available containment area.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 2. 10,000 m^^2^^ Breeding Site** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** The SCP-097-KO group is raised in a containment area measuring 100 meters by 100 meters, with a total area of 10,000 m^^2^^. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Given that the containment area is 200 times smaller than the original, it is expected that while growth may proceed without significant issues, constructing a cocoon structure will likely be challenging. _\n _\n**Results:** The female SCP-097-KO laid approximately 170,000 eggs, about half the usual number. After 320 days in the larval stage, the SCP-097-KO group emerged from the host and began constructing a cocoon structure with a base area of 9,200 m^^2^^. The structure was subsequently incinerated and demolished. _\n _\n**Analysis:** It was observed that SCP-097-KO not only adjusts the size of its structures based on the available area but also regulates the number of individuals in the group accordingly. Additionally, the completed structure's size was less than the provided area of 10,000 m^^2^^. This aligns with the hypothesis that SCP-097-KO modifies both the population size and the scale of its structures according to the conditions of its habitat.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n* **Experiment 3. 100 m^^2^^ Breeding Site** _\n _\n**Experiment Design:** The SCP-097-KO group is raised in a containment area measuring 10 meters by 10 meters, with a total area of 100 m^^2^^. _\n _\n**Hypothesis:** Given that the containment area is 20,000 times smaller than the original, it is expected that while growth may proceed without significant issues, constructing a cocoon structure will likely be challenging. _\n _\n**Results:** The female SCP-097-KO laid approximately 90,000 eggs, four times fewer than usual. After spending 325 days in the larval stage, the SCP-097-KO group emerged from the host and began constructing a cocoon structure with a base area of 99.1 m^^2^^. The structure was subsequently incinerated and demolished. _\n _\n**Analysis:** This experiment also demonstrated that SCP-097-KO adjusts its behaviour to fit the available area. The hypothesis that SCP-097-KO regulates its population size and the scale of its structures according to the conditions of its habitat has been confirmed. _\n _\n**Note:** It was confirmed that SCP-097-KO can adapt to an area of 100 m²; however, there is a concern that an excessively reduced population could weaken its ability to control the host. Therefore, it has been decided to provide a larger area in the containment procedures to mitigate this risk.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n++ **Ⅴ. Conclusions**\n[[/=]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\nThe research findings presented above can significantly improve the containment procedures for SCP-097-KO. Accordingly, the following revised special containment procedures are proposed.\n\n> All wild SCP-097-KO specimens, except for the twenty-five currently maintained groups, are to be exterminated. The SCP-097-KO containment breeding wing, an auxiliary facility of Site-19, must be maintained at room temperature at all times, with each group allocated a habitat area of 10,000 m². The height of each breeding wing must be at least 9 meters. During the metamorphosis period, Foundation personnel must continuously monitor to ensure that SCP-097-KO adults do not escape from the breeding wing.\n> \n> Every May, two Class D personnel are selected by having them draw a \"house\" under the pretence of a psychological test, with the most ordinary and conventional houses being chosen. One of these individuals is to have their central nervous system extracted and replicated to create 24 protein dummies (refer to attached document 097KO-D for the dummy creation method). The dummies and the other selected Class D personnel will be introduced into the SCP-097-KO containment enclosures to serve as hosts for the larvae. The Class D personnel should be rotated annually between the containment enclosures. When introducing a Class D individual into a containment enclosure, they must be gagged and their limbs restrained to prevent resistance. During the 10.5-month larval growth period, sufficient nutrients must be supplied to the host via IV or other means.\n> \n> After approximately one month of pupation, once the SCP-097-KO larvae have completed metamorphosis, containment team personnel should be deployed to dismantle the collapsed cocoon structure. Since mating occurs again within a week, the next host should be introduced immediately.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n[[bibliography]]\n: 097KO : //SCP-097-KO//, SCiPNET archive\n: e1 : Ethics Committee, \"About Using Class-D Personnel (I)\", 13-14, 201█.\n: a : 阿笠博士, \"高等霊長類の頭脳-身體間連結 (brain-body connect of high-level primates)\", 103-155, 201█.\n: i : Isaac Stark, \"Biological dummy\", 1-205, 201█.\n: 222 : //[[[SCP-222]]]//, SCiPNET archive\n: e2 : Ethics Committee, \"Regulations Of Human Cloning - 201█\", 9-10, 201█.\n[[/bibliography]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n----\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-097-ko/SCP-Logo-small-thick.png width=\"12px\"]] [[size 120%]]**SCP Foundation Scientific Department Archives**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@",
