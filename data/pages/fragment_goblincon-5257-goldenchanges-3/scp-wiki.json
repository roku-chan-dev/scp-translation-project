At least 3 RAISA technicians are to be on duty at all times to fix any issues that may arise within the system or Lyne.aic.\n\nTo maintain secrecy about the inner workings of SCP-5257, a decoy file has been created, available to all personnel with Level 2 security clearance. This file has been chosen to host the real documentation for SCP-5257, and will continue to do so permanently. All personnel with Δ/5257 clearance are allowed to view this file. \n\nPersonnel working on the maintenance of the DIDS are not to be informed about the nature of SCP-5257, and are advised not to interact with SCP-5257-1 in any manner.\n\n++ **Description:**\nSCP-5257 refers to a supernatural phenomenon, through which the 5257 slot on the SCiP database has been possessed by an anomaly posing as the spirit of former RAISA technician, Spec. Lance Kellock, designated as SCP-5257-1. SCP-5257-1 has no physical manifestation, and is stuck within the bounds of the 5257 slot.\n\nSCP-5257-1 feeds on all data that is uploaded to the SCP-5257 slot, first corrupting said data (through altering it or destroying integral parts of it), before beginning to \"consume\" it, deleting the data bit by bit until it has been fully eradicated. These processes are known as SCP-5257-A and -B, respectively. See the image below for the effects of these processes on written documents.\n\nDespite this, SCP-5257-1 shows a high level of sentience, and seems aware of the situation it is in (see the addendum). However, attempts to communicate with SCP-5257-1 have mostly been failures, as all communication efforts must be conducted through supplying SCP-5257-1 with pre-existing pieces of writing or audio files for it to corrupt.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=8\n|speed=200\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=400px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:libertythroughcessation-2/Hell\n|add-caption=false\n|caption= \n]]\n\nThe communication attempts that have succeeded have shown that SCP-5257-1 knows that it is trapped, and on multiple occasions, SCP-5257-1 has begged to be \"set free\" and \"released\". It also seems to understand that it was once a person, however, apart from its name, it knows nothing of its past identity. Due to this, it is currently unknown whether SCP-5257-1 is truly who it says it is, and its intentions behind degrading data uploaded to its file are unknown.\n\n++ **Addendum 5257-1: Timeline**\nOn the 8th of May, 2021, right after the expansion of the SCiP database's servers, Spec. Lance Kellock was working on a maintenance fix regarding the 3775, 6467, 6109 and newly created 5257 and 6183 slots, with Spec. Elisa Kellock, his wife, and two other RAISA technicians. However, while Kellock was taking a look at the 3775 slot, he encountered a memetic hazard that had taken over the slot, causing him to suffer from heart palpitations and a stroke for the next 4 minutes, before being pronounced deceased at 18:54. Medical staff on site were unable to help him before he passed away.\n\nThe RAISA formally classified SCP-5257 on the 11th of May, believing that SCP-5257 was simply some kind of isolated phenomenon affecting only the 5257 slot. However, as experimentation was done with 5257, it was determined that the anomaly seemed to be purposefully corrupting data in certain manners to leave behind messages and questions. This culminated in an incident where SCP-5257-1 left behind its name, followed by a question mark, after being given a passage from Steinback's \"Of Mice and Men\". \n\nSCP-5257-1 was questioned further about their identity, but they seemed unable to come up with any information regarding their past job, education or personality.\n\n++ **Addendum 5257-2: Note on the DIDS**\n\n@@ @@\n> **From:** @@andrewfeirin@raisa.net@@\n> **To:** @@ericcollins@raisa.net@@, numerous undisclosed recipients\n> **Subject:** Regarding the DIDS\n> @@ @@\n> -----\n> @@ @@\n> //Dear all,//\n> @@ @@\n> I hope this email finds you well.\n> Before I begin, I would like to provide you all with a small update on the DIDS initiative. Since its creation, the DIDS has deleted over 600 files, two thirds of which hosted potentially deadly infohazards, and has successfully dealt with almost 40% of the clutter on the database. All in all, the database' deletion process has been streamlined to be as efficient, systematic and hands-off as humanly possible.\n> @@ @@\n> I say this, as it has come to my attention, as the Head Coordinator of this project, that certain high-ranking members among the RAISA have recently been criticising the DIDS, having read 5257's documentation and misunderstood the true reality of things greatly. Thus, to resolve this matter, I would like to clear up two very essential things regarding 5257, and remind you all of the importance of the DIDS.\n> @@ @@\n> The first is that we have no real, tangible proof that 5257-1 is really who it says it is. Sure, it's given us a name, and its story matches up quite well, but it's been unable to provide us anything beyond fundamental information about who it (apparently) \"once was\". There is no way for us to confirm such a thing, and for all we know, it could merely be lying.\n> @@ @@\n> I would also like to remind everybody of one simple fact: we have no clue what SCP-5257's intentions are. If we knew that it was benevolent, I **promise** you that we would've tried our best to help them out by this point. But the principle truth is that we don't know what it wants. Even if they are who they're posing as (and this seems quite unlikely, considering everything), who knows what they want from us? It is simply not reasonable for an organisation as big as the Foundation to trust random anomalies, simply based on what they've said, when many of which have betrayed and back-stabbed us in the past.\n> @@ @@\n> Thus, please approach this problem from a more sensible perspective. We are not unethical, nor are we selfish. We are the Foundation. We are simply doing what is right, remaining skeptical and using this unique situation not to our detriment, but to our gain. Please remember this, and contact me directly with your concerns, rather than resorting to spreading misinformation regarding the program. Thank you.\n> @@ @@\n> Sincerely,\n> Andrew Feirin\n> Director of the DIDS\n\nFollowing this update, the RAISA sent out an announcement to relevant personnel, informing that the DIDS would remain in use indefinitely, until further notice. It was also announced that 5257's new documentation was to be locked under Δ/5257, and that new requirements were to be instated for personnel granted Δ/5257 clearance, restricting personnel previously involved with SCP-5257-1's supposed \"identity\" and technicians working on the upkeep of the system from viewing SCP-5257's actual documentation.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #e0dc74; background:#222200; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ ##e0dc74|Update to DIDS Detected!##\n\n##e0dc74|Confirming status...##\n\n##e0dc74|**Degradation Status:** Light Corruption##\n##e0dc74|Replacement is currently not needed.##\n##e0dc74|System has detected minor issues.
