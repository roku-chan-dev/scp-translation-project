Eliza Kellock, and\n* mentions of an unknown piece of music in SCP-5257-1's messages, described as a \"beautiful symphony\".\n\nThese changes culminated in Incident 5257-A, which took place on the 11th of May, 2029. A decommissioned article was uploaded to the 5257 slot at 13:30, belonging to a now neutralised info-hazard that spread through listening to an anomalous copy of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. The article contained an audio file belonging to a non-anomalous version of Concerto No. 1 in E Major, \"Spring\".\n\nAfter about 20 minutes, SCP-5257-A had fully elapsed, and Lyne.aic went down not long after, prompting RAISA technicians who were on duty that day to check on the 5257 slot. After Lyne.aic was put back online, said technicians created a copy of the now corrupted file, reading through the distorted text and downloading the non-anomalous recording of the song, attached below.\n\nThe file's name had been corrupted, but the title seemed to have been directly altered rather than created through SCP-5257-A, displaying a single word: \"Liberty\".\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:audio-player-woed-source\n|unique-name=vivaldi-four-seasons\n|audio-file=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:goblincon-5257-goldenchanges-5/Final%20SCP%20Audio%20Attempt\n|background-color=rgb(252, 252, 252)\n|border-color=rgb(34,34,0,255)\n|border-radius=0.313rem\n|dropshadow-color=rgba(12, 12, 12, 0.15)\n|text-color=rgb(34,34,0,255)\n|icons-color=rgb(34,34,0,255)\n|player-color=rgb(12, 12, 12, 0.15)\n|progress-color=rgb(34,34,0,255)\n]]\n\nA particular anomaly was noticed within the last 7 to 8 seconds of the song, when the symphony became completely indiscernible from a high-pitched buzzing sound and static playing in the background of the recording. When this audio-based anomaly was put through a spectrogram, the following image was created.\n\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"max-width:500px;\"]]\n[[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:libertythroughcessation-2/darkened%20spectogram style=\"max-width:500px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\nAn image brightener was used, displaying a single message. \n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=7\n|speed=20\n|float=true\n|align=center\n|width=500px\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/fragment:libertythroughcessation-2/Spectogram\n|alt=alt|alt-text=Brightened Spectrogram.\n|add-caption=false\n|caption=text\n]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\nAfter this incident, SCP-5257-1 suddenly returned to its normal behaviour with SCP-5257-A and -B reverting back to their normal speeds. However, certain changes still persisted, including the rise in the quantity of messages SCP-5257-1 left in data they were fed, and continued mentions of the symphony and message above. \n\nFollowing this, technicians working on the DIDS were restricted from opening any files corrupted by SCP-5257-1, and were advised not to engage with SCP-5257-1.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #e0dc74; background:#222200; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++++ ##e0dc74|WARNING!##\n\n##e0dc74|Confirming status...##\n\n##e0dc74|**Degradation Status:** Heavy Corruption##\n##e0dc74|Replacement is needed.##\n##e0dc74|Lyne.aic has gone offline, and the system is currently experiencing unusual amounts of load.
