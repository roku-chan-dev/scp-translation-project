[[/footnote]] As long as such a permit is maintained and edits are made regularly, SCP-0110-PRIME-J poses almost no threat to humanity.\n\n**Description:** SCP-0110-J is an anomalous relationship between the number of Object Classes within the SCP Foundation's database and the number of months until an inevitable ÓK-Class \"Universal Collapse\" Scenario.[[footnote]] Hereby referred to as SCP-0110-PRIME-J. [[/footnote]] The event has been noted to inevitably occur on 09/09/2030 within all observable multiverses.\n\nHowever, it was discovered through extrauniversal sources that when a new logical and usable Object Class is introduced into the database, the event is postponed by exactly one month. The mechanism upon which the anomaly functions is unknown.\n\n**Addendum 0110-1-J:** The following is a table of all proposed Object Classes in relation to stopping SCP-0110-PRIME-J.\n\n||~ Attempt Number ||~ Name of the Class ||~ Definition ||~ Personnel Suggesting ||~ Database Accaptence ||\n|| #1 || Anomalous || Item is so simplistic that it is not assigned an official database file || D.

Are any of you even aware of how much paperwork that creates? Hell, even one new Object Class creates weeks of new documents to fill, but forty-five? Most of them aren't even usable! I don’t care there’s a -K goddamnit, you guys can literally remake the universe, so find a way around that shit. You are literally just clogging the database for the purpose of sounding ~cool~ or your documentation getting more attention due to a word at the top of it. Yesod is practically a Thaumiel, except with less uses!
