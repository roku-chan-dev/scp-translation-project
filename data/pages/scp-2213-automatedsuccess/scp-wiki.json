Class C amnestics must be administered to the site director and any personnel involved in the execution of Mu-4 following the conclusion of the operation.\n\nAny SCP-2213-1 instances in Foundation custody are to be immediately terminated. Any future SCP-2213-1 instances are to be terminated through incineration immediately upon production (except as outlined in Operation Mu-4).\n\n**Description:** SCP-2213 is a door which, if uncovered, will produce an individual (referred to as an SCP-2213-1 instance) at intervals approximately two minutes apart. Beyond this production, the doorway appears entirely mundane, being composed of oak wood.\n\nA covering, which was installed shortly after discovery in 1964, has remained in place and prevents the production of SCP-2213-1 instances. While covered, SCP-2213 produces audible vibrations at the same regular intervals as production events, however the covering has proven capable of preventing production events entirely.\n\nWhile superficially similar to humans, SCP-2213-1 instances lack the capacity for complex thought. SCP-2213-1 instances are completely hairless. Instances require little nutrition to survive (the longest contained subject's body continued functioning for seven months before succumbing to starvation), and are resistant to injury due to redundant internal organs.\n\nAn instance's visual acuity is reduced significantly due to vertical slit pupils, while night vision is dramatically increased. Furthermore, despite lacking obvious sensory organs for the processing of auditory input, SCP-2213-1 instances have displayed behavior consistent with a capacity to observe sound.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Operation Mu-4\" hide=\" \"]]\n\n//This file has been accessed 3 times.//\n\n**Site director's terminal has been activated.**\n\n**Please Enter Credentials**\n\n**Welcome back Dr. Marrick. Your credentials are recognized:** //access granted.//\n\nOperation Mu-4 is to be initiated with the inclusion of yourself, and the four member backup team. The monitoring of the cremation systems and the chamber housing SCP-2213 is to be overseen directly by yourself. All individuals involved in Operation Mu-4 including yourself are to be administered Class C amnestics immediately following the successful conclusion of the operation except in the case of a breach relating to any information which contradicts SCP-2213's documentation.\n\nThe removal and replacement systems are both automated. You are to oversee this system and utilize your backup team only in the case of its failure.\n\nUnder no circumstances are any attempts at communications from SCP-2213-1 instances to be acknowledged. Under no circumstances should SCP-2213 remain uncovered for longer than 10 minutes. Should the backup team be required, and not complete its task before a production event, previously installed systems to facilitate the incineration of SCP-2213-1 instances will be initiated by yourself upon the conclusion of their task. The loss of the backup team is acceptable in these circumstances.\n\nIf the level of intelligence possessed by SCP-2213-1 instances in any way becomes known to any individual beyond yourself, your own amnestic administration may be postponed in order to deal with the information breach.\n\nPertinent information may be left for future site directors in the following section.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
