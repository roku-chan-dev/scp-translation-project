To quote the article itself where this scene takes place: \"It was a world with a pulse, a life that I could palpate, and at that point I felt the enormity of my world's hollow and primitive nature collapse upon me. I cried, not at his world's beauty but at my world's sheer inferiority.\" \n\nI do highly recommend reading SCP-2700 for yourself. It's one of my favorite pieces on the site.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** SCP-2700_City.png\n> **Author:** [[*user Marceline_Raynes]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:scp-2700-the-visit SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
