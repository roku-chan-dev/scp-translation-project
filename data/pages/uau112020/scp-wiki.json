What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[new-age-hub|New Age]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[Boxes]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTales regarding the Foundation's inner-workings? Not uncommon. Civilian encounters with the anomalous? Similarly done. But few do what Boxes does: civilian encounters with the Foundation itself, and the civilians //never realize it//.\n\nThe Foundation maintains absolute secrecy and total power over various jurisdictions. Some tales [[[everyone-knows|poke fun at this]]], but less really delve into what life would be like, living in a world with the Foundation present, but never seen. The world we live in, really, minus the Foundation. It forces the author to think not only about the SCP world, but our world as well, and how far control can be concealed.\n\nThink grand, but think low-key as well, much as a simple tale of a man supporting his family depicts the dystopia the Foundation world lives in.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write a tale where some outside the veil, at some point, encounters the traces of the Foundation or a facet of its organization, be it D-Class, amnestics, etc, without realizing the greater nature of the world they're in.\n* **For artists:** Draw something metaphorical, perhaps still grounded in a particular scene, showing the Foundation's phantom grasp on civilization.",
