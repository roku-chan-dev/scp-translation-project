I have felt that pulsating, penetrative brilliant blue of gamma radiation as it tore violently through the bodies of eighty thousand people and I have heard the exuberant chirping of people conversing in pale yellow-and-green radio waves on that same day in August of 1945. I have seen beautiful colors do terrible things, and sometimes there is nothing anyone can do.\n[[/div]][[div_ class=\"blue\"]]\n> You are composed of color and light, and I will make you blossom anew.\n> \n> I have seen those stunning blues and yellows of young people in love and that burning blood-red of lust as they sickened and drove to madness those they affected. I have felt the filthy, creeping black-brown of those who would never speak their mind as it grew and grew in them and consumed their thoughts every night until they were a husk of their former selves, corrupted by a color they could never actualize, a color never noticed, never appreciated and respected for what it was.\n> \n> I have seen beautiful colors do terrible things, but there is only so much I can do. I will give you what this world could not, but if your mind is leaking brown and black and degradation and rot, your body will start to as well.
