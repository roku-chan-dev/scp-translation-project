Toys, books, games and other stimulation are to be provided at the discretion of Dr. ██████. SCP-3175 is to be allowed up to two hours of outdoor play per day under supervision.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3175 is Lonnie James █████████ of ███ █████, ██████, recorded date of birth ██/██/2010. In all physiological respects, SCP-3175 appears to be a normal 6-year-old boy. Psychologically and cognitively, SCP-3175 displays a number of abnormalities which remain unexplained.\n\nSCP-3175 claims to be Edwin Makepeace █████ of ████████, ████, recorded date of birth ██/██/1956[[footnote]]█████ was reported missing by his daughter Elizabeth on ██/██/2016. His remains have never been found.[[/footnote]]. According to SCP-3175, sometime during the night of ██/██/2016, after celebrating his 60th birthday, he found his consciousness transported by means unknown into the body of SCP-3175.\n\n**Recovery:** SCP-3175 came to the attention of the Foundation in 2016 during a routine review of school records as part of Project SAMSARA. █████████ was flagged as possibly of interest to Project SAMSARA based on repeated disciplinary action for “telling the most ridiculous lies” in class. █████████ was subjected to preliminary psychological screening under the supervision of Dr. ██████, and although not found to meet the inclusion criteria for Project SAMSARA, was subsequently catalogued as SCP-3175. SCP-3175 was taken into Foundation custody under the cover story of the fatal rupture of a previously undiagnosed cerebral aneurysm. SCP-3175 has been transferred to secure housing at Site ██.\n\n**Reports:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Pre-Classification Evaluation, █████████, Lonnie James, ██/██/2016\" hide=\"Pre-Classification Evaluation, █████████, Lonnie James, ██/██/2016\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"printout\"]]\n> \n> @@ @@\n> \n> @@TESTS ORDERED:@@\n> \n> @@  * STANDARD INTELLIGENCE SCALE, 5TH ED.
