Tests utilizing SCP-3679 must be carried out or approved by a level 3 researcher assigned to SCP-3679.\n\nInvestigation into the identity and location of PoI-3679 is currently underway. The online storefront maintained by PoI-3679 is to be monitored and any newly identified customers are to be located and amnesticized after their purchases are confiscated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3679 is an unbranded ballpoint pen purchased online as a part of a writing kit. Chemical analysis shows the contents of SCP-3679 to be natural non-anomalous red ink. Despite this, tests have indicated that any writing done with SCP-3679 results in a blend of ink and the writer's own blood being used; no test subjects have displayed any discomfort or injury that would otherwise explain this, and prolonged use of SCP-3679 has failed to result in any noticeable differences in blood pressure or other such factors.\n\nStatements written with SCP-3679 are contractually binding: violating a claim or promise written with SCP-3679 invariably results in the writer's injury or death occurring within the following 24 hours. Causes of death have included non-anomalous factors (e.g. heart failure or accidental death) as well as anomalous factors (e.g. spontaneous human combustion or unprovoked decapitation). Those bound by a contract written with SCP-3679 have an innate understanding of the penalties for violating said contract, and as such, show a notable unwillingness to violate their terms. \n\nSCP-3679 was purchased from seller \"shadow-queen\", designated PoI-3679, through the popular online marketplace Etsy.com after a routine scan indicated potential anomalous activity based on the reviews left on PoI-3679's store. SCP-3679 was originally a part of a kit marketed as a \"Do-it-Yourself Geas[[footnote]]**geas** (/geSH/) //noun:// (in Irish folklore) an obligation or prohibition magically imposed on a person.[[/footnote]] Kit\", which contained SCP-3679, a pad of fifty non-anomalous sheets of paper, and a note from the seller.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Document-3679\" hide=\"- close document\"]]\n\n> Do-it-Yourself Geas Kit\n> \n> Tired of broken promises? Rival hero stealing all your thunder?\n> Create your own geas today!\n> \n> Forbid them from cutting their hair, prohibit them from refusing a gift!\n> Make them do anything you can think of with this simple kit!\n> All you have to do is get them to sign!\n> \n> WARNING: Seller is not responsible for any injury or death caused as a result of this kit.\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nInitial attempts at making contact with PoI-3679 were rejected. After leaving a one-star review of the purchased kit, PoI-3679 initiated correspondence with Senior Researcher Maxwell, head researcher assigned to SCP-3679.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Chat Log 3679\" hide=\"- close log\"]]\n\n> ##blue|**shadow-queen:**## hey asshole\n> ##blue|**shadow-queen:**## wtf is with the one star rating\n> **rjmaxwell:** Hello.

After locating an IP address, agents were dispatched with orders to capture PoI-3679 if possible. When agents arrived at the location derived from the traced IP address[[footnote]]Located on the Isle of Skye in Northern Scotland.[[/footnote]], they found only a small copse of trees showing no signs of human habitation. Field agents have been assigned to observe this location until further notice.\n\nAny customers that had left reviews on SCP-3679 have been located and amnesticized, with duplicate kits being incinerated.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3678]]] | SCP-3679 | [[[SCP-3680]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
