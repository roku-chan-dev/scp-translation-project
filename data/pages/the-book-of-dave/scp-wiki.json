Before too long, the book started writing back. How cool is that?//,,\n\n,,//Anyway, I wrote a song about the guys in the book and here we go. -Clyde//,,\n\n//**Peppy guitar intro**//\n[[div style=\"font-size:125%;color:#000;font-family:Courier,cursive;\"]]\n**Verse 1**\n[[/div]]\nWell I was sitting home alone last night, recording music for my band,\nWhen suddenly I saw some pages and a blackened spine.\nI grabbed me up that book, sat it down and started a-reading.\nAnd then thought to myself, “Hey, for lyrics this'll do just fine!”\n\n//It was the Book of Dave, it was the Book of Dave!\nSomething crazy bout a civilization depraved!\nBook of Dave, oh yes the Book of Dave!\nSounded like they needed some funk.//\n\n//**Probably a guitar solo here**//\n\n,,//We’re putting this in the EP? Seriously?

Me interest in read. -Umiko//,,\n\n,,//I think I threw it out, ‘Miko.
