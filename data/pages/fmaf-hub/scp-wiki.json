From the first motorised flight in 1903, only half a century was needed for humanity and their warplanes to open the world of jet and supersonic. Many organisations had to adapt to this rapid change, and the Foundation was no exception.\n\nThe Foundation started to build its own airpower in 192█'s reconnaissance-liaison aircraft introduction program, and now it possesses a well-organised air force which can accomplish various airspace missions, including reconnaissance, transportation, and carrier-borne flight. This document contains digested information about the composition, fighting power, facilities, and missions of the Foundation's air force.\n\n[[div style=\"text-align: right; margin-right: 1em;\"]]\nMOBILE AIR FORCE\nOPERATIONS COMMANDER\nAmadeus F.

Unlike the usual national air forces, the Foundation's air force hardly needs to defend its territorial sky or cope with the enemy air power. For this reason, and linked operations with the other ground task force units, Alpha-17 is attached to the MTF department instead of forming itself as an independent armed force. But this whole air power is too large and complex to embody in a single unit. Therefore, some first-line air units are organised as the subordinates of Mobile Air Force Alpha-17.\n\nMobile Task Force Alpha-17 is the operational command that oversees the Foundation's airpower. As it is a high-ranking echelon, it does not have direct combat forces except for the land-borne forces to defend Operations Command facilities. Alpha-17 coordinates the organisation and missions of subordinate units per the instructions of the O5 council and the MTF HQ. It compiles the details of the mission performance of said subordinate units to identify the collected intel and finished tasks. Ensuring that there is no problem with the flights of subordinate units and cooperating with civilian and military aviation control is also the responsibility of the 17th Aviation Control Group, which is under the immediate control of Operations Command.\n\nAirpower under Alpha-17 operates with purchased conventional military aircraft and its accessories, but many aircraft have modified bodies and accessories due to the specificity of missions. Such Foundation-developed improvement/modification devices include various non-destructive subduing weaponry, airborne aerosol-bound amnestic spraying devices, [[[upsilon-23-periodic-report#toc1|BISON]]], jet engine silencers, and Cognito-hindering paint.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Δ-61]]\n\n[[div class=\"m-center m-image\" style=\"float: right; width: 260px;\"]]\n[[image http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/MTW-d-61.png]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[table class=\"m-center\" style=\"float: left; width:calc(100% - 280px);\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #999;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n++++ MOBILE TASK WING DELTA-61 [[span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"]]\"OWLEYE\"[[/span]]\n[[/cell]][[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:105px; vertical-align: top;\"]]**Sr. Comdr :**[[/cell]][[cell]]\nBG Stewart Collins\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**Fdn.

The base is a large airfield with two 3000m long runways and six heliports built to support mass-scale aerial missions. The base stores various aircraft, ranging from two types of fighter jets utilised by Pi-0 and various rotorcrafts of Eta-100 to the KC-30 voyager aerial tankers, improving the operation radius and time.\n\nMissouri Base, constructed as the operational base at the time of the establishment of Delta-61 in 192█, was originally a small airfield with a single 1000m-long runway. Recognising the value of air power, the Foundation started investing in it. In the process, the Missouri Base underwent multiple expansions and upgrades to its current form. Furthermore, while constructing new airbases and establishing/reorganising MTWs, the units deployed in Missouri Base changed several times. After establishing Tau-99, the runway was expanded, and the Alpha-17 headquarters building was constructed. With the establishment of Lambda-5 in 194█, three air wings were stationed at the Missouri Base, leading to the airfield reaching its capacity. With a civilian area located only 85km away and the base becoming excessively congested, expending the Missouri Base was judged as an impossible option. Consequently, the Foundation decided to cunstruct a new airbase R2 Yukon, where Delta-61 will be relocated. Due to another overcrowding following the establishment of Pi-0 in 196█, Lambda-5 moved its main base to R3 Nile Base, and in 199█, Tau-99 was relocated to R5 Great Sandy Airfield. With the establishment of Eta-100 at the Missouri Base, the current unit deployment was established.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab R2]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/R2-1.jpg|caption=RQ-4 Global Hawk Reconnaissance Aircraft landing on Yukon Base. _\n687th Squadron, 68th Mobile Task Air Group, Delta-61. ]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding: 1px; align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #999;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n++++ SCP FOUNDATION AIR BASE R2 \"YUKON\"\n[[/cell]][[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:90px; vertical-align: top;\"]]**Sr. Comdr :**[[/cell]][[cell]]Col.

Moreover, the base is suitable for joint training exercises, thanks to its vast area and more igloos than the number of aircraft operated. Yukon Base has successfully hosted several events, including the White Flag Alaska joint training in 20██ and the Seventeen Flight exercise in 20██. This was also facilitated by the proximity to Eielson Air Force Base of the U.S. Air Force, which made public information control easier.\n\nOriginally, Yukon Base was constructed in 195█ to operate the U-2 Dragon Lady reconnaissance aircraft, with the Mobile Task Wing Delta-61 deploying and carrying out missions. Later, the 662nd Squadron was relocated to the newly constructed R4 Altai Base in 199█. With the introduction of the RQ-4 in 20██, the U-2 operation missions were fully taken over by the Altai Base, converting Yukon Base into an RQ-4 operation base. During this process, the 68th Group was established to be stationed at Yukon Base under Delta-61, and the 663rd Squadron was reorganised as the 687th Squadron.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab R3]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/R3-1.jpg|caption=A-10 Thunderbolt Ⅱ attacker of Lambda-5 taxiing to the parking ramp after landing on Nile Base.]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding: 1px; align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #999;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n++++ SCP FOUNDATION AIR BASE R3 \"NILE\"\n[[/cell]][[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:90px; vertical-align: top;\"]]**Sr. Comdr :**[[/cell]][[cell]]BG Nehru Brahmaputra[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**Location :**[[/cell]][[cell]][REDACTED], Al Wadi al Jadid Governorate, Egypt[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**Runways :**[[/cell]][[cell]]2622m × 2, Heliport × 2[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**DEP.

Notable aircraft types include the A-10 Thunderbolt II attack aircraft, AC-130 Spectre gunship, F/A-18F Super Hornet fighterbomber, various armaments for fire support, and the KC-30 Voyager aerial refuelling tanker. Among these, the F/A-18F was introduced in 200█ as a new multi-purpose tactical model, selected to replace the B-52 Stratofortress bomber of the U.S. Air Force when its lease contract expired. The decision to introduce fighterbombers took into consideration the negative assessment of the operational efficiency of large bombers and the significant need to fill the gap in air superiority in Europe and Africa.\n\nIn 196█, with the establishment of Pi-0 and deployment to R1 Missouri Base, three air wings shared the Missouri base, including Lambda-5 and Tau-99. Thus, the Foundation decided to build new airfields at suitable locations for dispersion. At that time, the Egyptian authorities, trying to build a positive relationship with the Foundation, offered a site for the airfield. The Foundation, facing issues with the uneven local distribution of its airbases, accepted this offer, leading to the construction of Nile Base. Nile Base was completed in 196█, with its runways and military facilities, and has been fulfilling its mission with Lambda-5 stationed there ever since.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab R4]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/R4-1.jpg|caption=U-2 Dragon Lady Reconnaissance Aircraft used by the Altai Base. _\n662nd Squadron, 61st Mobile Task Air Group, Delta-61.]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding: 1px; align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #999;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n++++ SCP FOUNDATION AIR BASE R4 \"ALTAI\"\n[[/cell]][[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:90px; vertical-align: top;\"]]**Sr. Comdr :**[[/cell]][[cell]]Col.

Located in the highlands of the Altai Mountains, the base has limited space, and the difficulty of takeoff and landing poses challenges for missions and resupply. However, thanks to its distance from civilian areas and high altitude, reaching operational altitudes is easy, making it a favourable location for U-2 operation. Additionally, its position is strategically beneficial for reconnaissance across the Eurasian region.\n\nInitially, the Foundation tried to establish a U-2 operation base in the Central Asian Plateau. However, the plan was indefinitely postponed due to strong objections from the U.S. Air Force, which was operating the U-2 as a key strategic reconnaissance asset against the Soviet Union, as they were concerned about the risks of utilising the aircraft in a region heavily influenced by the Soviet Bloc. The plan was revisited in 1992, as the People's Republic of Mongolia restructured into the nowaday Mongolia. All facilities including the runway were completed by 199█, and the 662nd Squadron of Delta-61 was deployed to Altai Base. Subsequently, with the conversion of R2 Yukon Base into a Global Hawk operation base, the 661st Squadron also relocated to Altai Base and both squadrons were reorganised into the 61st Mobile Task Air Group.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab R5]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/R5-1.png|caption=C-130 Hercules Transport Aircraft from Tau-99 taxiing on the taxiway of Great Sandy Airfield.]]\n\n[[table style=\"padding: 1px; align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #999;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n++++ SCP FOUNDATION AIRFIELD R5 [[span style=\"white-space: nowrap;\"]]\"GREAT SANDY\"[[/span]]\n[[/cell]][[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"width:90px; vertical-align: top;\"]]**Sr. Comdr :**[[/cell]][[cell]]BG Yoruyonaka Shin[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**Location :**[[/cell]][[cell]]Area-44, [REDACTED], Western Australia State, Australia[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**Runways :**[[/cell]][[cell]]12830m × 2, Heliport × 4[[/cell]]\n[[/row]][[row]]\n[[cell style=\"vertical-align: top;\"]]**DEP.

Great Sandy Airfield located in the desert region of northwestern Australia within Area-44, a supply and production hub. The primary mission of Tau-99, deployed at Great Sandy Airfield, is to distribute supplies issued from Area-44's production facilities and large-capacity storage warehouses to various bases via large transport aircraft. The raw materials and stored goods needed by Area-44 are primarily procured within Australia or secured through Darwin Port, but Tau-99 transports some cargo requiring quick delivery. Additionally, since the Foundation's largest maintenance depot, 1st Depot, is also part of Area-44, most of Foundation aircrafts requiring depot-level maintenance are moved to Great Sandy Airfield.\n\nThe creation of Pi-0 caused overcrowding in R1 Missouri Base again. In response, the Foundation relocated Lambda-5 and Tau-99 to a new airfield. In 198█, the plan for Area 44, including the Great Sandy Airfield where Tau-99 would be stationed, was completed and received final approval from the O5 Council. Area 44 was designed not just as an aviation facility to accommodate Tau-99 but as a large-scale support facility undertaking various maintenance-related functions such as supply, procurement, and repair, previously dispersed across regional hubs like Site-19 and Site-01K until then. In 199█, with the first warehouse, storage facilities, and all runways of Great Sandy Airfield deemed operational, Area-44 commenced active duty.\n\nSeparate from Alpha-17, the Foundation Space Command, its launch sites, and related facilities are also located in Area 44. For this reason, the 10,000-meter-long runways at Great Sandy Airfield were designed to accommodate space shuttles.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab R11]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/R11-1.jpg|caption=F-15X Skipper Eagle from the 102nd Fighter Squadron flying over Mt.

Its current design and performance are comparable to those of the Gerald R. Ford-class carriers of U.S. Navy. It currently serves as the flagship of the 7th Mobile Task Fleet of CMF Chi-17, and as the assigned carrier for MCW Chi-18. It is equipped with an electromagnetic aircraft launch system, phased array radar, and anti-aircraft defence weapons and can operate up to 90 aircraft simultaneously. It can cruise over 30 knots and conduct missions without resupply for two months, demonstrating superior performance.\n\nInitially, the CVN-6 //Enterprise// was designated as [[[SCP-217-KO]]], subject to containment. However, thanks to its stable anomalous characteristics and exceptional combat capabilities, it was decided to be recommissioned and integrated into active service. In 1973, it underwent operational testing by the maritime test team of Upsilon-23, and upon recognition of its utility, it was recommissioned in 197█ as a Foundation combatant vessel under Task Force Chi-17. Concurrently, Chi-18 was organised as the air wing assigned on the CVN-6 //Enterprise//. After its recommissioning, the CVN-6 //Enterprise// exhibited its anomalous characteristics once in 2013, after which it was safely upgraded under the supervision of the Engineering Support Department and returned to service.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n　\n\n+++ **MISSIONS**\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab In Progress]]\n\n+++++ [[[SCP-616]]] Containment Maintenance Operation\n* Site-46, located near Area-44, is currently designated as the containment facility for SCP-616, with the necessary hangars and runways for executing SCP-616's containment procedures also established. Tau-99 is responsible for the ground maintenance and periodic flights required for SCP-616. A team of skilled mechanics and pilots are currently stationed at Site-46, serving as SCP-616 containment personnel. Over the 50 years since its initial containment, ██ individuals have passed away on duty. _\n\n+++++ [[[SCP-2556]]] Containment Maintenance Operation\n* Two (2) SH-60 Seahawk helicopters from MCW Chi-18 are currently deployed on the SCPF //Favonius// of the Atlantic Command's 6th Cruiser Fleet. These helicopters are equipped with mast-mounted radars and other early warning equipment to detect aircraft approaching the no-fly zone and periodically patrol near SCP-2556 to check the condition of the aircraft and the anomalous phenomena. HH-60H Rescue Hawk helicopters were deployed when previous containment procedures were in effect. However, after the death of Lieutenant Ilyushki, its jurisdiction was transferred, and containment procedures were changed. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n+++++ [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-079-ko|SCP-079-KO-3]]] Containment Maintenance Support Operation\n* Alpha-17 supports the operations of the Foundation Space Command to ensure the safe launch and re-entry of Foundation space shuttles and performs the containment procedures for SCP-079-KO-3. They control the airspace corresponding to the launch/landing trajectory and guide the gliding space shuttles to land at Great Sandy Airfield after re-entry safely. Past attempts to guide the landing of SCP-079-KO-3 ended in failure. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n+++++ [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-797-ko|SCP-797-KO]]] Retrieval Operation\n* Currently, a total of ██ instances of SCP-797-KO have been successfully recovered, and it is understood that ██ instances, excluding the █ instances that crashed, are still uncontained. (Number may increase.) These SCP-797-KO instances, like those previously recovered, will be retrieved to the ground as soon as their location is identified, using CH-54 Tarhe heavy transport helicopters of Eta-100. The CH-54s deployed for the operation will undergo Type A high-level cognito-inhibition treatment to ensure civilians do not notice the operation. Local amnestic dispersal procedures will also be implemented if information dissemination is suspected. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Complete]]\n\n+++++ [[[SCP-1387]]] Containment Operation\n* In 198█, the first identified Incident-1387 led to a total of ██ civilian disappearances due to two additional incidents. Following this, in 199█, the O5 Council set the containment of SCP-1387 as Alpha-17's top priority, instructing them to swiftly secure it to prevent further civilian casualties. Based on the collected photographic evidence of SCP-1387, Alpha-17 analysed its flight characteristics and concluded that the object could glide over considerable distances without flapping its wings. They determined that by connecting it to an aircraft with towing cables, they could guide its direction of glide to land on a runway or open ground. _\n _\nAfter the last incident at Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City, the team was able to determine which direction SCP-1387 took off. Based on this information, a search along the Pacific coast of South America discovered SCP-1387 flying in a large circle over Peru. When the SCPS //Enterprise// entered Peruvian territorial waters and deployed an E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft from MCW Chi-18, SCP-1387 perceived it as a hostile approach and increased its altitude to flee over the Andes Mountains. In response, F/A-18C Hornet fighterbombers from Chi-18 and F-111 Aardvark fighters from Pi-0 launched to intercept and disrupt SCP-1387's path, causing SCP-1387 to turn left and begin heading north. _\n _\nAfter flying approximately 5,500km, SCP-1387 entered the Air Defense Identification Zone of the United States about 9 hours later. As the object reached the airspace over Arkansas, a CH-47 Chinook transport helicopter approached SCP-1387 from high altitude and dumped liquid oxygen around the wingtips and tail of the target.[[footnote]]Liquid oxygen was chosen instead of a sedative or hardening agent because it was uncertain whether SCP-1387 was a biological entity or an inanimate object. Using such substances posed a risk of having no effect or potentially neutralising the target, so these options were rejected.[[/footnote]] The liquid oxygen vaporised before contacting SCP-1387's body, not causing severe damage but inducing a state of paralysis due to the rapid temperature drop, rendering it unable to control its altitude and direction. Shortly after, a C-130 Hercules transport plane adjusted its position relative to SCP-1387 and deployed cables to connect to the instance, beginning a towed flight. _\n _\nFlying at low speed and descending for about 30 minutes, the two aircraft reached an extremely low altitude over a prairie near the R1 Missouri Base. The C-130 then disengaged from SCP-1387, ascending and departing, while SCP-1387 continued to glide and descend over a distance of about 1 km before touching the ground. Although its body was almost paralysed, thus unable to move its wings to perform the familiar landing manoeuvres, SCP-1387 could extend its legs and safely land. Immediately after, a CH-54 Tarhe heavy transport helicopter tracking SCP-1387 from above dropped a net to capture it. _\n _\nOnce Foundation forces approached from the ground and fully restrained SCP-1387, it began to resist vigorously as the paralysis wore off, but it failed to break out of its temporary containment. Subsequently, SCP-1387 was transported to Area 55 on a large trailer, where its current containment procedures were established. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n+++++ [[[SCP-1850]]] Guided Landing Operation\n* SCP-1850 was first discovered in 19██ in the London Borough of Kingston upon Thames, drawing the Foundation's attention after several contacts with civilians. After a period without sightings, SCP-1850 was rediscovered in 19██ following a near-miss incident[[footnote]] When a collision is narrowly avoided during an aircraft's flight. Counted as an Aircraft Incident.[[/footnote]] with a commercial airliner over the Atlantic. Alpha-17 immediately initiated a containment operation, deploying an F-111 Aardvark fighter from Pi-0. The F-111, with its wings fully extended for slow flight, gradually forced SCP-1850 to change its course. Unlike SCP-1387, the more docile SCP-1850 compliantly flew alongside Site-6. Without any specific instructions or approach, SCP-1850 autonomously landed on the runway designated for liaison aircraft at Site-6 and was soon secured by the base's security team. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n+++++ [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-091-ko|SCP-091-KO]]] Guided Reposition Operation\n* At the time of its initial securement, SCP-091-KO was located in an airspace very close to a densely populated area in ██████, the Mediterranean Sea. This proximity, coupled with the heavy pollution in the airspace, significantly heightened the potential risk posed by the liquid concoction emitted by SCP-091-KO. _\n _\nBy 20██, continued research had enabled control over SCP-091-KO's air sack, making it possible to steer the entity as desired. This led to the decision to deploy Eta-100 to relocate SCP-091-KO. However, concerns over how the airflow generated by the rotor blades of the intended rotary-wing aircraft might affect SCP-091-KO led to the cancellation of plans to deploy existing aircraft. Instead, a special uncrewed vehicle equipped for the operation was used to manipulate the target. _\n _\nTo prevent any unplanned contacts, a squadron of UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters and Ka-32 Helix-C helicopters were deployed to monitor and control the airspace around SCP-091-KO as it moved. While the 17th Air Traffic Coordination Squadron managed minute-by-minute air traffic control for all aircraft passing through the nearby airspace, SCP-091-KO began its move toward the airspace under the jurisdiction of R3 Nile Base. After 30 hours of flight, SCP-091-KO successfully halted in the targeted containment airspace. Following this, the containment procedures for SCP-091-KO were revised to their current content, and tasks related to SCP-091-KO were transferred to the newly established Ksi-22. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Halted · Postponed]]\n\n+++++ [[[SCP-998]]] Search Operation\n* SCP-998 is currently not detectable, with only its radio signals being intermittently received. Still, the continuation of these signals and the testimonies of crew members suggest that it may still be flying somewhere. Consequently, efforts to pinpoint and approach the aircraft's current location were undertaken by Delta-61 and Chi-18, focusing on the airspace corresponding to the 998-Alpha zone and the crew's testimonies. However, this operation yielded no results for five years, leading to an indefinite suspension of the search activities until new information was gathered. _\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Awaiting Classification]]\n\n+++++ MAF Alpha-17\n* [[[SCP-253-KO]]]\n\n+++++ MTW Lambda-5\n* [[[SCP-556-KO]]]\n* [[[SCP-958-KO]]]\n\n+++++ MSW Tau-99\n* [[[SCP-347-KO]]]\n\n+++++ MCW Chi-18\n* [[[open-fire|]]]\n* [[[SCP-745-KO]]]\n* [[[hippocampus-of-triton|]]]\n\n+++++ MTW Kappa-11\n* [[[SCP-1102-KO]]]\n[[size 20%]]　[[/size]]\n\n+++++ MTW Kappa-15\n* [[[SCP-8086]]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n　\n[[=]]\n------\n++ [[image http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/FMAF.png width=\"25px\"]]　**SCPF Mobile Air Force**　[[image http://scpko.wdfiles.com/local--files/fmaf-hub/FMAF.png width=\"25px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[!--\n\nMobile Air Force Operations Commander Lieutenant General Amadeus F.
