Retiring Foundation personnel with relevant experience [[footnote]] Childcare, teaching, pediatrics, psychology, combat, congenital defects [[/footnote]] are strongly encouraged to take up residence in Negaseattle following their retirement in order to assist the initiative. Individuals 5132-1 through 5132-50 are to be kept within the bounds of Negaseattle and approved Foundation properties and locations. [[footnote]] see Document 5132-A [[/footnote]] Further details regarding the treatment of Individuals 5132-1-50 can be found in the Initiative Comprehensive Guide written by Dr. Clark.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5132 refers to the operation being conducted in the Foundation retirement town of Negaseattle, Washington. SCP-5132 is designed to combat the observed drop in personnel over the course of the late 20th and early 21st century. Due to the Foundation’s increasingly concerning turnover rates, measures were approved by the O5 Council to ensure the retention of the current leadership as of 1981. Fifty individuals, ranging from Mobile Task Force commanders to Site Directors to leaders of specific projects, were chosen for the initial trial run. These individuals were tested for prominent genetic defects and pervasive medical history before submitting a DNA sample to create a genetic clone. To date, three viable clones of each individual (and thus four generations of the selected individuals) have been produced using SCP-████, each employing different methods of ensuring the best outcome for the Foundation’s needs. \n\n**Overview: [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shiny-gold-foil Rose Hatcher], Individual 5132-32** [[footnote]]For additional subject overviews, see Document 5132-A.

It’s designed specifically so nobody knows how it works except me.\n> \n> [Dr. Cataldo laughs]\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Alright. What would you say is your favorite childhood memory?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** My dad took me to LegoLand and let me pick whatever I wanted. I ran from bin to bin shoveling handfuls of them into my bucket with my bare hands. It was euphoric.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Sounds wonderful. What is your deepest intangible fear?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Being ignored when I have something important to say.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Mm. And if you had to rate your loyalty to the Foundation on a scale of one to five, where do you think you would fall?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Three.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Three?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** It’s a job. I’m not exactly the type to fall head-over-heels for the ideals here. And I don’t agree with a LOT of the practices. I do what I need to do, but there are a lot of things I’m MORE loyal to than my place of business. \n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Such as?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** My family.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Of course. Thank you, Dr. Hatcher.

I would like to take a moment to remind you that due to the anomalies involved in the creation of the subjects in question and the overall importance of this project, your proposals need to be cleared by three members of the board minimum.

Let’s get right to it.\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Lovely.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** What are your initial concerns about your role in this initiative?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** I’m afraid that if I meet my- my “counterpart,” I’ll finally see the back of my own head and there will be something inexplicably weird about the back of my skull, and I’ll never stop thinking about it.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** I see your sense of humor is the same as Hatcher 1, Doctor.\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Why wouldn’t it be?\n> \n> [Dr. Cataldo laughs]\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Moving right along. What would you say is your favorite childhood memory?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** When I was nine, my father took me to LegoLand and let me shovel whatever Legos I liked into a bucket. Best day of my life.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Really the best toy. What is your deepest intangible fear?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** That people won’t listen to me in emergencies, and it’ll result in people getting hurt.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Understandable. And if you had to rate your loyalty to the Foundation on a scale of one to five, where do you think you would fall?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Three.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Could you elaborate on that?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** I’m more loyal to things like my family than I am to my place of work. I’m perfectly happy to do my duty that I’m paid for, but I think it’s no surprise that I take issue with the way things are run around here.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Right. That concludes our interview, Dr. Hatcher, thank you again for coming in. \n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** How’s it going?\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** I’m sorry?\n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** The project. 5132.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** It’s… we’ve encountered a few hitches we weren’t expecting. \n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Stuff you can fix in the next go-round.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** Probably. We have several ideas we are planning on trying out. \n> \n> **Dr. Hatcher:** Well, we’ll see how this all goes.\n> \n> **Dr. Cataldo:** I guess we will.\n> \n> **<End Log>** \n> \n**Notes:** Age-up cloning technology usage halted after personnel observed a trend in dramatically increased risk of genetic diseases in subjects.

But while I'm glad you're thinking compassionately, I need to remind you that your position on this project does not include research into SCP-████ or any other Foundation project. While all the diseases observed in the subjects are indeed non-anomalous, using any anomaly for cancer research would be an improper use of Foundation resources and could cause vastly more problems than it would solve.\n> \n> Furthermore, I would like you to think about the importance of this project. The Foundation is approaching its twilight if we don't find a solution. We are hemorrhaging personnel at an unsustainable rate. The 5132 project has the potential to save our organization if we can stay focused on the task at hand. \n> \n> Dr. Cannon\n> \n\n[[/Collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Individual 5132-32.3]]\n\n**Birth Date:** 1986\n\n**Current Status:** Deceased 2012, gunshot wound.\n\n**Desirable Traits:** Fast reflexes, emotional control, logical thinking, high Foundation loyalty. \n\n**Undesirable Traits:** Inclination toward social isolation, lack of compassionate empathy, unpredictable impulsivity, chronic depression, self-destructive behavior.\n\n> \n> **Interviewed:** Individual 5132-32.3\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Katharine Clark\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Clark:** Good morning, Miss Hatcher.\n> \n> **5132-32.3:** 32.3.

Raising them within the Foundation, starting their training as early as possible, limiting their connection to the outside world, I understand why we are doing it. They are not ordinary children, they will not have ordinary lives. The course they have set ahead of them is, by design, extremely difficult and high-pressure, and they need to be introduced to that early. They aren't even human, strictly speaking. We still are not 100% on any side effects produced long-term by the anomaly that created them.\n> \n> But as I'm watching them, monitoring their health and progress, I'm having major doubts about how we have set this up.\n> \n> Their development is normal, comparatively. Maybe it's only been a dozen years, but none of them are showing anything abnormal in the timeline of their development. They have shown, however, signs of progressively severe mental problems. A morbid part of me thinks maybe it's beneficial in the long run, given that most Foundation employees end up with some kind of mental illness anyway. But another part of me is still dubious of our plan to raise children in an underground military bunker, for their sake.\n> \n> Unfortunately, this project isn't about what's best for them. It's about what's best for all of us. We've already botched one phase. We are running out of chances.\n> \n[[/Collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Individual 5132-32.4]]\n\n**Birth Date:** 2010\n\n**Current Status:** Active, currently in care of Dr. Elaine Marten and former special agent Griffith Hook.\n\n**Desirable Traits:** Practical creativity, high motivation, strong social skills, fast reflexes, Foundation loyalty. \n\n**Undesirable Traits:** Contrarian nature, impulsivity, disorganization, willful attitude.\n\n> \n> **Interview Date:** 12/9/2026\n> \n> **Interviewed:** Rose Hatcher 4\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Clark\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Clark:** How are you feeling, Rosie?\n> \n> **Hatcher:** Pretty good.
