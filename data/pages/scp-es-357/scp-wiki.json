The subject holds two bottles of liquor, one in each hand, and smokes a Cuban cigar. The photograph that constitutes SCP-ES-357 was originally taken in Havana, Cuba, in 1953 by Constantino Arias and is titled \"El Americano Feo\" (The Ugly American).\n\nSCP-ES-357's anomalous properties are activated when the object is observed by a US citizen. Exposure to SCP-ES-357 in vulnerable subjects induces an extreme feeling of uneasiness, pallor, sweating, paranoia, and also express discomfort and uneasiness regarding ideas directly related to the Cuban territory, its people, or being there. The effects of SCP-ES-357 are not permanent and usually cease within 1-2 hours of exposure; however, all affected individuals continue to express discomfort at the thought of being assigned to CMA surveillance again.\n\nSCP-ES-357 was initially discovered in the mid-1960s, following the creation of the CMA and Fidel Castro's rise to power in Cuba. Multiple attempts to spy on the newly founded organization proved unsuccessful, as all of the Foundation's U.S.-born spies were immediately rooted out through the use of SCP-ES-357. All initial reports of the anomaly were forwarded to the Department of Liquidation and Procurement, which failed to find a single instance of SCP-ES-357. Although it is known that there are CMA spies within the Foundation, it is currently unknown whether the organization is aware of the Foundation's knowledge of the anomaly. \n\n**Addendum 357.1:** On 01/05/1995, the Foundation succeeded in recruiting an agent from Little Havana who possessed Cuban nationality; Javier Palacios, a 42-year-old CMA agent who offered to defect to the Foundation as a double agent on the condition that he and his family be granted U.S. citizenship, amnesty and a pay raise. The Foundation agreed, and Palacios was assigned to retrieve information on SCP-ES-357 to help bolster its counter-espionage capabilities. \n\n**Addendum 357.2:** A transmission sent by Palacios on 9/25/1995 is reproduced below.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Note: Agent Palacios has spent the last few months befriending one of the alleged members of the SCP-ES-357 creation team, Gustavo Santos. The following is a record of a transmission sent by Agent Palacios in which he interacted with Gustavo Santos.//\n\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n//[Irrelevant conversation redacted for brevity.]//\n\n**Palacios:** You're a funny guy, Gustavo.\n\n**Santos:** Please. I'm just another researcher. I can't be any funnier than all the other nerds in the building.\n\n**Palacios:** Whatever you say. But look, I had a question I was wondering if you could answer for me.\n\n**Santos:** Of course. What do you need, friend?\n\n**Palacios:** It's about that picture of the American. The one we use against the yankees.\n\n**Santos:** Oh yeah?\n\n**Palacios:** Yeah. How does it work?\n\n**Santos:** You know I can't tell you, Javi. But don't tell anyone.\n\n**Palacios:** Just curious, is all.\n\n**Santos:** I really shouldn't...\n\n**Palacios:** Come on now. We are both lifers of the CMA. We are both men of science.\n\n**Santos:** I thought you were an agent.\n\n**Palacios:** I studied chemistry in university.\n\n**Santos:** I see. Well, in that case, I suppose I can let you in on the secret.\n\n**Palacios:** Thanks for trusting me, Gustavo. I promise you it'll stay between us.\n\n**Santos:** Okay, but first, tell me, Javi, what got you interested in Case 001221?\n\n**Palacios:** I find it very interesting that a simple photograph has the power to make these imperialists squirm. I also admire the composition of the photograph. Do you think Arias told the Ugly American that he hated him? \n\n**Santos:** Probably not. He looks too happy for that to be the case. Or drunk.\n\n//[Both laugh.]//\n\n//[The shuffling of papers is audible on the recording.]//\n\n**Santos:** Ah, here we are.\n\n**Palacios:** Case 001221?\n\n**Santos:** Yup.\n\n**Palacios:** It's been a long time since I see it in person.\n\n**Santos:** Oh yeah?\n\n**Palacios:** Y-yes.\n\n**Santos:** Are you alright, Javier? You're a little pale.\n\n**Palacios:** I'm fine. I just think my lunch is-- HRRK! \n\n//[Palacios is heard vomiting.]//\n\n**Santos:** My God.\n\n**Palacios:**  I'm sorry, Gustavo. I... I'm... sorry, I-- oh God what is happening to me?\n\n**Santos:** It happens to you that the others were right. You had been acting strange, happier, more relaxed, more... detached. That you were a spy was just a hypothesis, one that today we have proven, but with what happened now, I get a conclusion and a couple of other theories.\n\n**Palacios:** //(Screaming)// What is happening to me?!\n\n//[Palacios is heard screaming incoherently.]//\n\n**Santos:** Theory. U.S. nationality. Information from here in exchange for living there. That's what you asked for, right? They should have given it to you by now. I admit, I didn't think this was the way it would end up. You were right, the scope of this thing is amazing. Conclusion. You're a traitor. No, what am I saying, you wanted to sell us out to the Yankees in exchange for becoming one, you are worse than a traitor; you are a fucking [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gusano_(slur) gusano.]\n\n//[Palacios' screams grow fainter and fainter, until they are no longer audible. There is the sound of a chair backing up and footsteps approaching.]//\n\n**Santos:** And since you're nothing but a worm, I don't see anything more appropriate for you to become.\n\n//[The sound of something twisting on the floor, followed by a loud stomp, are audible before the audio feed is cut off.]//\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n\n//Note: This was Palacios' last transmission. Attempts to contact him or locate him have, to date, failed. Palacios is considered Missing in Action.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** 357.jpg\n> **Name:** The Ugly American\n> **Author:** Constantino Arias\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ConstantinoAriasUglyAmerican.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
