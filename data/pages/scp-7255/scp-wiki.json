SCP-7255 is out of frame.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**{{Special Containment Procedures:}}** Any civilians approaching SCP-7255 are to be dissuaded out of the anomaly's vicinity under the pretense of the sauna being a private property. A proper set of containment procedures is pending approval.\n\n**{{Description:}}** SCP-7255 is the designation given to a sauna located in the outskirts of Riihimäki, Finland. SCP-7255's interior, though seemingly mundane, is an extradimensional space that connects approximately 107 afterlives, 73 extradimensional spaces and 38 alternative timelines.\n\nWhile in baseline reality, SCP-7255 is located in the municipality of Riihimäki, SCP-7255 may be located in other places in other timelines, spaces and afterlives. Due to the large amount of realities and spaces connected by SCP-7255, the anomaly is considered a common place for SCP-7255-1 instances to meet.\n\nSCP-7255-1 is the designation given to any entities that enter (or have entered) SCP-7255. Upon exiting SCP-7255, SCP-7255-1 instances will return to their respective realities.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**Addendum 7255.1:** DISCOVERY -- 13.01.2017}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nSCP-7255 was originally found by Rsr. Abigail Lacroix on January 13th, 2017, during a holiday vacation to Finland along with her coworker, Neil Leinnes, both of which were officially assigned to Site-94 in Alaska. During her 2-week vacation across the country, Lacroix reported that, while visiting Riihimäki, several posts in Finnish and Swedish detailing a 'magical sauna experience' could be found around the entire town. One of these posts was later recovered during a short inspection of the town, and its translation can be found below:\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**ISOMÄNTYVALKOISELLAMAALLAJÄRVI MAGICAL SAUNA EXPERIENCE**}}\n\n{{FIND THE BEST LÖYLY IN FINLAND.}}\n{{BECOME A GIANT OCTOPUS'S BEST FRIEND UNDER MAGICAL DUST SAUNA STEAM.}}\n{{FIND YOUR LIFE'S LOVE AND NEVER MEET THEM AGAIN.}}\n{{CLEAN YOUR SKIN FROM ALL SIN AT A SHINING LAKE'S COAST..}}\n\n{{EASY RELAXATION, MAGIC UNBOUND.}}\n{{**ONLY AT ISOMÄNTYVALKOISELLAMAALLAJÄRVI.**}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n\nLacroix spoke fluent Swedish, so she understood most of the text on the sign. Upon contacting her workmate, who was booking in a night at a local inn, Lacroix proceeded to drive towards the location on her own.\n\nOnce Lacroix entered SCP-7255 and comforted herself, she laid on the sauna's cabin for 7 minutes before a large, bipedal polar bear (\"SCP-7255-2\") entered the cabin and sat next to Lacroix, who reported to feel unnerved by the bear's presence. Believing the bear was an individual anomaly, Lacroix called her workmate using her earpiece, and described her circumstances. Following this, a platoon of the Canadian Army (\"SCP-7255-3; SCP-7255-11\") entered the sauna and the bear proceeded to exit SCP-7255, presumably intimidated by the guns.\n\nLacroix later escaped the sauna and drove to the inn Leinnes was booking in, before writing a message to Site-358's Site Director, Kalevi Riikonen. A provisional SCP file describing the bear was later written.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ {{**Addendum 7255.2:** INTERVIEW LOG -- 16.01.2017}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nOn the evening of January 16th, 2017, Rsr.

I should've talked to you before any of this could happen.}}\n\n{{As I said, an indemnity is the best way to settle things!
