I was thinking of taking a vacation next year in [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/k-s-g-hub|Hong Shing]]], now that it's been open to the public for a while.\n\nAre there any stories that you can share? Advice you can give me?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##red|**SashaBelle**## #47282938\n\n------\nHi, KiKo! Here's some advice that I got from my tour guide when I went to Hong Shing.\n\n# Don't talk to [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-cn-999|United State of A Mary King]]] representatives, Foundation representatives, the Unusual Incidents Unit, or the Hong Shing Police Department under //any// circumstances. They have a bad habit of making people asking them questions \"disappear\" for a while. If you need help with anything, ask someone local instead.\n# Do //NOT// buy anything infused with Divine Energy!!! My tour guide said their friend once purchased a crystal laced with the stuff, and they were detained by customs for exporting radioactive materials. In short, if something makes your skin tingle, //AVOID IT//!!!\n# Do NOT ask questions about the Sky Wall Crisis. It's not forbidden or anything, but a lot of people lost friends and family during the incident, so it's a sensitive topic for the locals...\n# If you see someone who looks identical to you, //DO NOT APPROACH THEM//!!!1!! My tour guide told me they heard of bad things happening to those who met \"inverted reflections\" of themselves. Few people survived.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##red|**elleBahsaS**## #47282939\n\nReally now? Wanna put that to the test **##red|@SashaBelle##**?\n\n//Waves fingers menacingly in ur direction//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##red|**SashaBelle**## #47282940\n-----\nReally, //that's// the best you've got? Blow me. If I told you what my guide said about what happened to people who met their parallel selves, you wouldn't be making light of it, trust me.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##white|**CeleryOvercoat**##üóø #00000000\n-----\nOi, knock it off, both of you.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##green|**DuldrumMonkey**## #47282942\n\n------\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki-cn.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-cn-1997/RP.png style=\"width:300px;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\"]]\nmy photo.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n~~~~\nits a really beautiful place. check out this image i took and see for yourself.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##grey|**Darwizzii**## #47282946\n-----\n##green|@DuldrumMonkey## Bud you did not take that. That's from one of the Skippers' [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-cn-1997|declassified documents.]]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##green|**DuldrumMonkey**## #47282953\n-----\ni said i //took// it. i never said i //shot// it ;)\n\n**##red|[THIS USER HAS BEEN BANNED.]##**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##pink|**evilwaterbottlef**## #47282959\n\nHong Shing, huh? Y'know, I was actually there when the Sky Wall had a hole torn in it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##grey|**Darwizzii**## #47282964\n-----\n**##pink|@evilwaterbottlef##** How??? They said there were no survivors of that thing.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##pink|**evilwaterbottlef**## #47282966\n\nWell, \"there\" is a bit inaccurate. I was //nearby//. But I might as well have been there, with the lights, screams and ##red|[CENSORED]## that we heard coming from the region.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n ##white|**Rook**## ‚ôñ #00000000\n-----\nThis topic is grossly inappropriate for this thread. I'm not going to ban anyone for it //at the moment//, but any more talks about what happened in 2010 need to go to a more suitable thread.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##yellow|**KiKoHowYaDoin**## #47282976\n-----\no.O\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##blue|**JoeDaDragonSlaya**## #47282984\n-----\nSorry you had to witness that, KiKo. I promise you that not all Parawatch threads derail like this.\n\nAnyway, my advice is to take a look at the Sky Wall paintings if you get the chance. The people of AWCY and the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gamers-against-weed-dossier|Gong Anartists' Group]]] are gorgeous artists, when the former isn't being dadaist and the latter isn't doing stuff for shits and giggles.\n\nI especially recommend the mural of the Zhujihui's original Sages' Council. It's absolutely brilliant and scathing satire of the bastard predecessors. Plus, every year on Hong Shing's anniversary they let people vandalize it as much as they want!\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##yellow|**KiKoHowYaDoin**## #47282985\n-----\n:O I heard about that. I'll have to see if I can schedule my vacation to line up with the anniversary.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##purple|**H00tWireless**## #47282987\n-----\n\nMeh the art on the skywalls are overrated as fuck imho. Oh wow, you drew the Zhujihui as a bunch of decrepit and taloned crones. Very subversive, especially paired against the Dickbutt graffiti and mispelt marriage proposals.\n\nGive me a break.\n\nI've seen more interesting art in the stalls of my workplace's shitter. At least that won't make my nose bleed if I look at it wrong.\n\n**##red|[THIS USER HAS BEEN BANNED.]##**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##orange|**YugeJefe**## #47282990\n-----\nI'm sorry, but I really have to question why a place where people can emit hundreds upon thousands of whatever of radiation from their stomachs can just be... opened up to the public. Are you at least going to be wearing protective clothing?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##yellow|**KiKoHowYaDoin**## #47282991\n-----\nShould I? I thought they give Divine Energy-proof amulets to protect tourists from it all?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##orange|**YugeJefe**## #47282999\n-----\nTell that to my buddy Johann. He bought one of those crappy \"amulets\". Now he can't have kids, but at least their left nut now glows in the dark.\n\n**##red|[THIS USER HAS BEEN BANNED.]##**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n##yellow|**KiKoHowYaDoin**## #47283001\n-----\n-_- I knew this was a bad idea.\n\nWell, thank you everyone who actually gave me advice and such. I think I'll ask around Void instead.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n ##white|**Rook**## ‚ôñ #00000000\n-----\n(Ôºç‚Ä∏·Éö) Great job, folks. Another advice thread ruined. I hope you're all proud of yourselves.\n\n**##red|[THREAD LOCKED]##**\n\n[[/div]]",
