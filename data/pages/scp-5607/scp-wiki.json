All basic life functions are supported through the stasis unit and maintained by the Research and Development Division. \n\nSCP-5607-1 is to be extracted via a catheter and stored within pressurized biologic storage tanks. The extracted SCP-5607-1 is given to Development Team 14 to be repurposed into Compound-5607/P.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Description__**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=200 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=150px \n|url=http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/donk/alien\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-5607 within its stasis unit.\n]]\nSCP-5607 is theorized to be an extraplanetary humanoid entity originating from outside of the Sol System. Measuring 11 cm in height, SCP-5607 is bipedal, with elongated arms, and a large head relative to its body (approximately 4 cm in diameter). Similar in biological function to native Earth plants, SCP-5607 subsists off water, UV radiation, and carbon dioxide. Since its discovery, SCP-5607 remains in a self-induced comatose state, though all bodily functions are fully operational.\n\nSCP-5607 was discovered in 1976, during a Foundation-backed mission to the lunar surface. During surveying operations in the Montes Secchi range, astronauts discovered a disk-shaped vessel (designated SCP-5607-0). After SCP-5607 and its stasis container were removed from SCP-5607-0, a self-destruct sequence initiated leading to the destruction of the vessel in its entirety. The salvaged remains were declared unsuitable for experimentation and subsequently left at the point of discovery (2.65°N 42.97°E, Montes Secchi, Earth 1). \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=200 \n|float=false\n|width=250px \n|url=http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/donk/ship\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=SCP-5607-0 prior to its destruction.\n]]\n\nSCP-5607-1 is the designation for urine created by SCP-5607 and is currently considered anomalous due to an unexplained biological reaction caused by its inhalation. During the examination of the spacesuit worn by SCP-5607, an unusual urine disposal method was discovered. Utilizing a catheter and an advanced vaporization unit, the suit redistributed vaporized SCP-5607-1 through the respiratory systems. Inhalation of SCP-5607-1 was subsequently tested on 28 different species, including humans. These tests concluded that SCP-5607-1 unilaterally causes a substantial increase in physical and mental dexterity, far beyond pre-exposure parameters. It is theorized that this facilitates the acuity needed for piloting the high-speed interstellar vessel used by SCP-5607.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__SCP-5607 Project Proposal__**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=5\n|speed=200 \n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=150px \n|url=http://topia.wikidot.com/local--files/donk/inhale\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=PISS Device.\n]]\nThe Research and Development Division has developed an inhalation device utilizing Compound-5607/P, an SCP-5607-1 derivative capable of a temporary and substantial increase in the effectiveness of Mobile Task Force agents. The device was designated the Personal Inhalant Service Stimulant, or PISS device. Testing concluded a ~175% increase in performance-related scoring in all participants.[[footnote]]Testing and performance results are available upon request.[[/footnote]] The R&D division requests the use of a high-engagement Mobile Task Force in order to test the long-term use of the PISS Device. \n\n**MTF Administration:  ##green|Approved##**\n\n**Site Director: ##green|Approved##**\n\n**Ethics Committee: ##green|Approved##**\n\nDr. Cooper Millgate and Development Team 14 are hereby granted a six-month trial for the operational use of PISS Devices utilizing MTF Epsilon-19, under the supervision of Captain Luke Wells.
