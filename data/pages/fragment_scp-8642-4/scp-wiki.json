  "content": "You simply can’t bring yourself to knock on the door. The suspense is too much. After all, anything could be behind that door! A time-traveling mashed potato, a bird that sings like Dolly Parton, a bumble bee with a calendar, an eldritch god who manages a team of insects critiquing story drafts… the possibilities are endless! And you decide that, instead of knocking and spoiling it for yourself, you want to savor the suspense and the mystery for as long as you can. Sure, you’ll probably get yelled at, fired, and maybe even put on bathroom-cleaning duty, but that’s a small price to pay for keeping a little mystery and imagination in your life.\n\nCongratulations! You found the Failure Ending! You failed to be a functioning member of the Foundation by refusing to knock on a door!\n\n||= Page 4 - Failure Ending||\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/0 Try again to get all 7 endings!]||\n||= or||",
