Alsvart\n* Site-19 Director Tilda D. Moose\n* SCP-8855\n\n**FOREWORD:** The following recording begins shortly prior to SCP-8855's identification as an anomalous object. Since its discovery, SCP-8855 was noted to have been under considerable stress, calming only shortly before the following recording took place.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«BEGIN TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//<SCP-8855 walks up to a tree within its enclosure, bracing itself against it. Professor Alsvart fumbles with a pen and notepad, setting them down hurriedly on a plastic fold-up table as Director Moose approaches through the grass.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Moose-- Tilda. Tilda-- Moose.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## //Haa-haa.//\n\n//<Moose extends her hand to Alsvart, who gives her a confused look. Rather than taking it, she quickly pulls her into an embrace. Moose is surprised, but reciprocates with a soft smile.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I'm sorry for eating into your schedule like this, with a meeting that isn't just business. I'm sure a great many people have an urgent need of you at any given moment, but-- I haven't seen you in so long.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## I know-- no, it's fine. I've had an unfortunate couple of days. I'm glad to be outside, with friends. I need something easy... to take my mind off things.\n\n//<Alsvart releases Moose from her grip and steps back.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## This place isn't good for you, you know that? You can't keep working yourself to the bone like this. \n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Someone's gotta do it.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## And //someone's// gotta take care of you, Tilda. Please, sit.\n\n//<They both sit down across from each other on a pair of plastic fold-up chairs. SCP-8855 ceases bracing itself against the tree and begins to wander.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I see it on your face; questions. Far be it for me to delay your curiosities, //ask away.//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## I got the notice from security about this thing. No indication of anomalous attributes or of external subterfuge; it's been cleared for release outside the perimeter. I take it you're the reason it's still here?\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Ye-up! I blocked its release. I just had to test one last thing. Plus... do you really think a //three-hundred-plus// kilogram beast like that could've slipped by //our// perimeter unnoticed? //Really?//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Stranger things happen.\n\n//<Silence. SCP-8855 appears to be inspecting the grass around its enclosure.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Enlighten me.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Someone as well-read as you, how much do you know about \"Fylgja\"?\n\n//<Moose stares blankly at Alsvart.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## F-Y-L-G-J-A.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Ah. Hm... I've seen the name under the category of 'guardian spirit'. Never did read up on them myself, though.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## A guardian spirit indeed! A //follower// -- that's what \"fylgja\" means -- tied to fate and fortune. They manifest mostly in dreams, in feminine form, sometimes as animals representative of it's owner's spirit. Though \"follower\" //is// a bit of a misnomer, as they actually walk ahead of them, act ahead of them. So they're guides, of sorts.\n\n//<Moose stares curiously at Alsvart.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Their animal forms usually appear in the dreams of others to forewarn the fate of its owner. But, when that form can be seen //by// the owner? It is a clear omen of death -- **impending**.\n\n//<Silence. Moose continues to stare, patiently waiting for Alsvart to make her point.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Gosh, when'd //you// start making such liberal use of the silent treatment? Fine! What if I told you this-- //<pointing to SCP-8855>// --is //yours//?\n\n//<Moose takes a moment to look at Alsvart, then at SCP-8855 for a while, then back at Alsvart.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Why, just because...?\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## **No**, dummy. Not because it's a //moose//. It's-- //<she scoffs.>// Have you had any weird dreams as of late?\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## I haven't //been// dreaming as of late. Haven't had the time.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## See? This is why we never spend time together anymore! This place isn't good for you. Always busy, busy, busy. Well, I //have// been dreaming-- //<again, pointing to SCP-8855.>// --of her. Two nights in a row, now.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## So I can say that someone did their job properly... Alsvart, do you have anything to go off here besides circumstance and conjecture? //Are you certain you haven't just had moose on the mind?//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Well I... //I suppose in certain ways you could say I have.// But... very well. I'll recount what's been my primary focus for the past couple days. I //just// got back -- yesterday -- from my vacation in Greece, throughout which I was re-reading 'Gödel, Escher, Bach' for the... fifth time. So, n--\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## You never left the hotel room, did you?\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## ...the Aegean Sea looked just fine through the window. //<Pause.>// Anyway, so, no, I haven't had //moose// on the mind. Last I heard they aren't native to the Mediterranean anyway.\n\n//<SCP-8855 stops moving and locks its gaze upon Alsvart, laying its ears back and raising its hair.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## I'll grant you that a coincidence like this, in our line of work, //could// be an assumed manifestation of anomalous influence. But you need more than that.\n\n//<Alsvart pauses and exerts herself greatly to maintain eye-contact with Moose, putting on a fake smile before speaking.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## How's your sex life?\n\n//<Moose closes her eyes and belabors her breathing, beginning to speak shortly before opening them again.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## //What?// It... really is lovely catching up with you -- Reine -- but we //are// working.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Clearly. It must be difficult for you, when everyone's too afraid to speak up to the big boss. I understand, of course, the power imbalance. You're in charge, where would you go looking? //Other site directors?// Not a very big pool... not a very good looking one.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## And what, exactly, could've possibly indicated to you that I had even the slightest gleaming interest -- at all-- in discussing such a topic with //you//?\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## No, no. I know that, Tilda. I know.\n\n//<Silence.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/shattered-love Not since Alison], right?\n\n//<Moose stares at Alsvart with a gaze that threatens harm.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## She must be a //pretty// difficult one to top, huh?\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## You're pissing me off n-- \n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## You said I needed more. //<She turns toward SCP-8855.>//\n\n//<After a moment's delay Moose does the same. SCP-8855 is now standing on the immediate opposite side of the enclosure fence, staring at Alsvart, agitated. It takes a violent bite at the fence. Alsvart hides a frown from Moose's view.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## It's not just you. In my dreams, when it came to me, I always thought of you. My mind had difficulty differentiating its behavior, its image, from yours Like it was an interobject, somewhere in between. In my dreams I saw it walking away, towards... someone. I don't know who.\n\n//<Moose continues to look toward SCP-8855.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## They walk ahead of you, act ahead of you. As it is now, is how you soon will be. In dreams they come to guide you, or others--\n\n//<Moose interrupts, standing up and turning towards Alsvart.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## This is **not** how we test! You set an appointment, you state your suspicions, you outline procedure! You do **//not//** drag a co-worker into a meeting and blindside them with inappropriate questions in a selfish gambit to corroborate your theories!\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I'm sorry, Tilda. I didn't want to hurt you, but I had to prove it to you!\n\n//<Silence. Moose remains standing, staring.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## And I haven't seen you in so long.\n\n//<Moose turns, and leaves without a word. Alsvart sits still for a while before picking up the pen and notepad on the table. She looks at SCP-8855, which has already sauntered off through its enclosure. She begins to write.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«END TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aeigenmachine/asterisk_scp.svg]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\" style=\"max-width: 65%; font-size: 95%;\"]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]__ADDENDUM 8855.II:__[[/span]] Director Dream Journal\n[[div class=\"jotting\" style=\"font-size: 92.5%;\"]]\n//{{The following is a transcript of thought-processes recorded by Site-19 Director Tilda D.

The field is dew-laden; it's morning, I can see a dark figure dancing on the treeline, half-obscured by a gentle fog at our feet. The cold wind makes me shiver, and the treeline upon which it stands is one straight, unending threshold stretching from horizon to horizon. Looking back, there is no home, no Site-19. The threshold surrounds me, a circular clearing of a dense forest. I'm surrounded and alone.

Why show up... however long in advance, to tell me that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it?

This thing, it's forcing me to wallow in it.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## And you don't think there's anything that can be done?\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

For all we know this thing is only manifesting a subset of a fylgja's conceptual qualities. My family has no history with anything similar to it, which, if it's real, they probably should've. At least to some extent. It might be... a behavioral lynch-pin to which an entity -- I -- am anomalously attracted. No lynch-pin, no pull. Besides, we've seen no evidence of fate having any part in this, it could be a wholly behavioral/temporal anomaly.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Or, equally likely...\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

Why?\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## It obfuscated itself. Only presented itself to me as some vague form. How could I trust it? Never showed me its face, not even its real figure.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Figure-- it's a bit much to ask on your first dream, no?\n\n//<Moose looks away briefly from the camera.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

You're skipping a couple things.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## It was a dream, Reine. No one's really themselves when suffering a severe case of disjunctive cognition.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I'd have to contest that, it's in our dreams when we're freed of our inhibitions!

And you couldn't hear yourself say it.\n\n//<Silence.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Well, I... I don't even know what I was trying to say. It was just... some desire to-- to say anything at all.

Moose:**## I refuse to legitimize it.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Did you know that when an animal fylgja dies, it's said that a part of her owner -- who is soon to follow -- has already moved across that threshold. They exist in this... liminal sphere on their way into another world. In this condition, their typical behaviors and attitude changes. So, someone of few words might become one of many, for example.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## You're suggesting we decommission SCP-8855 in order to make me into a better speaker?\n\n//<Alsvart laughs.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## //(gleefully)// No, sweetheart. Of course not. I'm laying the cards on the table for you. Have **any** of its behaviors diverged from your own?\n\n//<Moose sighs deeply.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

Moose:**## I'm well aware of what this is, I deny nothing. I simply don't //particularly// enjoy regular updates on how precisely I'm going to be acting in the immediate future. Conjures one too many memories of McDoctorate's cafeteria lectures on determinism at Site-17. Among other things.\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Why don't we take a live look instead then?\n\n//<Before Moose can react, Alsvart jumps out of her seat, quickly reaching the office window in order observe SCP-8855. Moose plants her elbows on her desk, and her face in the palm of her hands. In its enclosure, SCP-8855 appears frustrated, biting branches off the tree within its enclosure and throwing them away. It suddenly stops, standing still for a bit before walking away, slowly.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I see. //<Turning to Moose.>// Well don't get frustrated with me yet, I haven't done anything!\n\n//<Moose's head remains in the palm of her hands. She is completely still, save for the occasional wave-like twitch of her upper-body. She's sobbing.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## Tilda? //<She pauses, taking a step closer.>// Tilda, I'm sorry.\n\n//<Alsvart continues to step closer to Moose.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## I'm truly sorry.\n\n##26592b|**Dir. Moose:**## Sorry for **what?** You haven't done //anything//. You're having the time of your life just fucking around!\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## It's not--\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

Frankly, I'm shocked you haven't thrown me out of your office; the way I've been behaving.\n\n//<With a stern expression, Moose's body stiffens as she looks down at the table.>//\n\n##26592b|**Dir.

If you truly need your waking mind to go through with this. Tonight, when you go to bed, recite the following over and over as you drift away: //\"Mind awake, body asleep.\"// Got it?\n\n//<Moose nods. Alsvart sits silently for a while before standing up. She looks at Moose, despondently. She begins moving around the desk, but is stopped as Moose indicates for her to go no further.>//\n\n##000|**Prof. Alsvart:**## There's no more tiptoeing around this, Tilda. You need to choose.\n\n//<Alsvart leaves through the door, leaving it wide open behind her. For hours, Moose sits, staring blankly at this threshold.>//\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«END TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"asterisk\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Aeigenmachine/asterisk_scp.svg]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation\" style=\"max-width: 65%; font-size: 95%;\"]]\n\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]__ADDENDUM 8855.VIII:__[[/span]] Director Dream Journal\n[[div class=\"jotting\" style=\"font-size: 92.5%;\"]]\n//{{The following is a transcript of thought-processes recorded by Site-19 Director Tilda D.

I've never owned a mirror. I'm dreaming. Awake. Why am I walking by the forest's edge? It isn't surrounding me anymore. I must be searching for her. In the face of my dwindling agency, I feel a profound shame. Where is she? Again the forest stretches from one end of the horizon to the other. I can only imagine its confinement to have been a product of my subconscious fears, then. A fear that it was a thing impending; my prophesied doom. Is that why I hesitated? Faced now with a simple threshold, I know I have a choice.\n\nI leave, with her.\n\nOr I stay, and die.\n\nThe forest is not the death I had feared, it is the field. The forest is her refuge for me. I turn to her, knowing she'll be there. \n\nShe stands, again, on the treeline. I see her clearer now, with a waking mind. The visage remains just as incomprehensible as the one gleamed by my subconscious -- like seeing several of the same person beneath a layer of no one at all.\n\nI can think of no one but Alsvart--\n\n--and Alison.

I can't be there for her.\n\nThe stairs ahead become a bright, dawning star in the space of a single blink. I stand upon the same overlook as --Reine-- had when I found her, knelt down in the dirt.
