A security camera is to monitor the growth of new SCP-5517-1 instances, and incendiary weapons are to be used to prevent their maturation.\n\nAdditionally, customized costotomes[[footnote]]An instrument usually used for cutting the ribs and opening the thoracic cavity in surgical operations.[[/footnote]] are to be used to remove excessive material from SCP-5517 whenever necessary, which is to be sent to Site-66 for study. Personnel responsible for this procedure must wear biohazard protection suits at all times. Any individual that comes in direct physical contact with an SCP-5517-1 instance is to be immediately isolated. A medical examination will determine the proper measures to be taken, possibly resulting in termination.\n\nSCP-5517-B is to be contained inside a square perimeter and a behind a three meter electrical fence. A patrol is to ensure the security as well as the integrity of SCP-5517-B.\n\nAnnually, a Class D personnel is to be exposed to an instance of SCP-5517-1. The affected individual is to be allowed to proceed with its anomalous behavior while escorted by a security team provided with standard equipment.\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=deadtree|\n    caption=SCP-5517. Photo taken in 1974 by an unknown photographer. See 5517-B/INV ITEM #9.\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-5517 is a pale tree of unknown species. Its outer structure is primarily made of collagen fibers and calcium phosphate. The interior consists mostly of stem cells, but also presents an amalgam of other ordinary human cells, tissues, and organs, including: neurons, hormone-producing glands, and bronchioles.\n\nOrganisms visually similar to leaves, designated SCP-5517-1, will periodically grow and detach from SCP-5517. These organisms are 12 cm long and scarlet in color. They have simple circulatory systems composed exclusively of erythrocytes[[footnote]]Commonly known as red blood cells.[[/footnote]]. They also have rudimentary muscle fibers, which make them capable to control gliding movements through the air. SCP-5517-1 specimens demonstrate no interest in animals other than human beings and will cease all movement 48 hours after full maturation, but will maintain the hazardous properties until biodegradation. Analysis indicate the DNA of SCP-5517 and SCP-5517-1 specimens to belong to a single human female.\n\nSCP-5517-1 will attempt physical contact to human individuals when possible. If successful, the organism will attach to the subject epidermis and will immediately start to merge with the tissue, causing severe pain and temporary paralysis. The affected individual, designated SCP-5517-2, in addition to developing yellow coloration in the iris and sclera, will then engage in a singular behavior[[footnote]]See 5517/EX.07 and 5517/INT.11.[[/footnote]] and will react aggressively to any attempt to hinder its progression. Incendiary weapons have proven to be an effective countermeasure to SCP-5517-2 instances, as they present unnatural resilience to physical damage.\n\nLocated 426 m from SCP-5517 is an abandoned wooden cabin, referred to as SCP-5517-B. An inspection of the cabin as well as experimentation with SCP-5517 has revealed a relation between these two objects, specially concerning SCP-5517-2's active cycle. A list of relevant items found in the cabin can be examined in this report.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-5517 is located inside a natural reserve in the municipality of Maricá, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Following a series of missing persons cases of hikers and local residents, an investigation by the local police led to the official discovery of the anomaly in 1995, and to the eventual intervention by the Foundation in the same year.\n\n----\n\n**Inventory (5517-B/INV):** Notable items collected from SCP-5517-B.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS INVENTORY\" hide=\"▼ ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n\n||~ ITEM ||~ DESCRIPTION ||\n||= **#1** ||< An old cleaver.

It should be noted that SCP-5517-2 displayed no signs of pain during the process, nor did it have its motor functions impaired, even though it was visually confirmed to have removed vital organs from the thoracic cavity. After observation of SCP-5517-2 engaging in several culinary practices using the collected material, the entity placed the organs inside a wooden bowl.\n> \n> As SCP-5517-2 rushed from the front door, Agent Miguel ████ was attacked. Agent ████ expired from 52 slash wounds to the ████ and right ██████. The video camera was damaged in the process. Instructions to increase observation distances were given and the experiment was ordered to continue for the sake of data collection.

Just following the death of Miguel ████, we had no feed from that point on.\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** It all happened fast after that. The target approached the empty well outside the cabin, and just crawled in there carrying the wooden bowl. When the boys approached the well he was gone. We used a rope to go down and there was a hole inside. The target reopened this passage with his bare hands through the bricks and soil. It led into a small underground tunnel.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** What was it looking for? I have seen my share, be objective.\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** We followed in. Visibility wasn't the best inside, but we had the flames and a couple of lights. The path was quite linear, so we had no trouble navigating. It took around six minutes before we started seeing the flesh structures. Root-hands is what we called them, since we couldn't decide which of the two they were. But they didn't move, they just stood there.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Your team was approaching the coordinates of 5517 from below.\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** Correct. We kept a good distance from it. ████ saw it first, the target was kneeling at the top of a log staircase leading to a huge chamber. It was pitch black in there, but he didn't mind our flashlights. He was lifting his hands above the head as if offering the bowl.\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** [pause]\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Want one? [lighter flicks and ignites]\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** Appreciate it. He just stood there for about three minutes. [exhales] Then a massive hand comes out of the dark chamber. Grabbed D-854 and carried it into its mouth. Took the upper half of his torso away. We could see the face of D-854, he was laughing even then.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Can you describe this new entity?\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** We let the scene cool off, then moved a bit closer. It is around twenty or so meters long. The shape wasn't quite easy to identify at first. Or maybe it just took a while for any of us to admit it.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** What do you mean?\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** The hand-roots? They were all around it, suspending it, slowly moving it left and right. There was humming too, coming from the tree above. What I mean is that this thing was being taken care of, that it is humanoid.\n> \n> **Dr. Bernard Hale:** Anything else?\n> \n> **Elijah ████████:** Just make me wake up and pretend that I'm babysitting a fucking tree again, would you?\n> \n> || **<END INTERVIEW>** ||\n> \n> ----\n> \n> //**ADDITIONAL NOTES:** New entity reported.

Even though it has 18 m of height, SCP-5517-3 resembles a male infant in appearance. However, the entity also presents other singular characteristics: thick skin similar to a pale crocodilian hide, three eyes with vertical beaded pupils, and six-digit hands. SCP-5517-3 feeds exclusively on SCP-5517-2 instances, and remains in a slumber state when unattended.\n\n----\n\n**Addendum 5517/AD.01:** In 1998, it was discovered that SCP-5517-3 shares genetic material with both SCP-5517 and Inventory ITEM #7. Furthermore, efforts to remove SCP-5517-3 from SCP-5517's roots have resulted in extreme aggressive behavior and lost of ██ personnel.\n\n**Addendum 5517/AD.02:** After five years of containment, SCP-5517-3 has been progressively manifesting physical symptoms of malnutrition and hostility. Attempts to offer alternatives of nourishment have failed, as have the attempts to replicate SCP-5517-2's culinary methods. Request to temporarily use Class D personnel in creating SCP-5517-2 instances to feed and pacify SCP-5517-3 --pending approval.-- accepted.
