For more information on the anomaly, please consult its corresponding documentation.\n\nAll personnel are free to add additional tests to the log, provided they are sponsored by an Overseer.\n\n----\n\n**Template:**\n\n[[code]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** \n\n**Projectile:**\n**Target Object:** \n**Procedure:**\n\n**Results:** \n\n**Notes:** (optional)\n[[/div]]\n[[/code]]\n\n----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson \n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart. \n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target, but not throw with enough force to hit precisely.\n\n**Results:** As the dart began to arc downwards, the target fell off the wall. The dart ended up hitting the target in the direct center on its way down.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target, but aim sideways.\n\n**Results:** As the dart passed in front of the test chamber's doorway, a Junior Researcher at Site-02 entered the chamber seeking assistance, causing the dart to be deflected towards the target.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target, but aim backwards. Ensure the doorway is not present in the dart's trajectory.\n\n**Results:** As the dart left SCP-8630, a large crow bursts from the room's ventilation shaft, flying directly at the dart in sheer panic. The dart then deflected upwards off of the bird, who — in its panic — knocks over both the dartboard and the experiment recording equipment. The dart falls directly onto the target.\n\n**Notes:** Several hours before the experiment, the site's ventilation security suffered a software error, allowing for the bird to enter Site-02. Although the likelihood of the bird entering the facility precisely as it did was low, the event was ultimately attributed to SCP-8630's effects. The bird was apprehended and released after being given rudimentary medical care and tested for anomalous properties.\n\n//There are definitely security risks involved in using SCP-8630, but there seem to be dozens of potential applications. I am curious to see exactly how far this anomaly can be pushed, and what exactly can be considered a \"dart game\", considering// [DATA CLASSIFIED]//.// –Dr. Jem Pierson \n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target. A pane of glass with a refractive index of 1.001 hermetically separates D-12330 from the dartboard. D-12330 is not made aware of the glass.\n\n**Results:** As the dart leaves D-12330's hand, a magnitude 5.3 earthquake occurs, with Site-02 near its epicentre. The pane of glass is shattered and the dart hits the target.\n\n**Notes:** Preliminary geological analysis reveals the tectonic plate beneath Site-02 spontaneously split in two. Further investigation is scheduled to determine underlying causes outside of SCP-8630.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson\n\n**Projectile:** An approximately 7 meter by 30 centimeter steel replica of a dart, weighing 4,725kg.\n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target.\n\n**Results:** After \"release\", SCP-████ breaches containment, obliterating the testing chamber and leading to ██ casualties. The dartboard is found atop the dart head in the rubble.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Faye Peterson\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Sirius B.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target.\n\n**Results:** Denied by O5-█.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Jem Pierson\n\n**Projectile:** A digital dart controlled via a Wii-remote.\n**Target Object:** A digital dartboard.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target in a video game. Game was programmed to make it impossible to hit the target.\n\n**Results:** The remote slipped out of the testing personnel's hand, landing in the screen on the location the digital dartboard was located.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. Alexander Avenlee\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** A plastic mannequin suspended by wires connected to a metallic contraption mounted on the ceiling.\n**Procedure:** Intended to hit the target while simultaneously triggering the contraption to elevate the mannequin at high speed immediately upon the projectile's release.\n\n**Results:** After one second, the contraption was activated, lifting the mannequin upward. However, approximately one and a half seconds later, one of the wires supporting the mannequin failed, causing a shift in momentum towards the forward direction. This resulted in the dart striking the mannequin's face with full force.\n\n**Notes:** //The contraption was tested eight times prior to the experiment to ensure there were no technical issues. So, it is reasonable to conclude that the malfunction was most likely caused by the anomalous effects of SCP-8630.// —Dr. Alexander Avenlee.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. A. Kraken\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** A generic dartboard affixed to the center of a wind turbine, powered on and facing testing personnel.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target. \n\n**Results:** Approximately 10ms after the projectile is thrown, the testing chamber loses power. This is later attributed to a system error which briefly disconnected local power lines from the rest of the Foundation grid. Once power is restored, the dart is observed to have hit the \"bullseye.\" \n\n**Notes:** All personnel were provided with eye and ear protection prior to testing. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. A. Kraken\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart\n**Target Object:** A generic dartboard affixed to the side of a Precision Strike Missile (PrSM). Missile is fired from a secure testing location on a pre-programmed path into open water. The dart is then thrown after it. \n**Procedure:** Intend to hit target. \n\n**Results:** Satellite footage shows projectile achieving speeds upwards of 300 m/s in pursuit of the PrSM. Approximately 4.5 seconds after release, the PrSM spontaneously loses ignition and begins freefall. In the instant of arrested momentum, the dart strikes the dartboard in the \"bullseye.\" \n\n**Notes:** All personnel were provided with eye and ear protection prior to testing. The origin of the dart's acceleration is unclear, but is speculated to be related to extremely rare atmospheric phenomena.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. A. Kraken\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart\n**Target Object:** A generic dartboard, which is released from a remote-controlled drone at an elevation of ~2000 meters or more. At this stage, the target cannot be manipulated due to a mechanical or digital failure. \n**Procedure:** Intend to hit target while target is in freefall. \n\n**Results:** At approximately 4500ms, the dart achieves a maximum speed of 370 m/s and breaks the sound barrier. The dartboard is recovered with a 3mm hole directly through the \"bullseye.\" The dart is not found. \n\n**Notes:** All personnel were provided with eye and ear protection prior to testing. \n\n//It's not my fault if you thought you didn't need it after the first two.// --A. Kraken\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. O. Stalwart\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dartboard.\n**Target Object:** Standard dart, taped to wall.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit target.\n\n**Results:** When thrown, the dartboard hit the dart on its point. Inspection reveals the two connected on the \"bullseye.\"\n\n**Notes:** //Surprised that worked.// --O. Stalwart\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Researcher S. Pataro \n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Two dartboards, one colored blue and one colored green).\n**Procedure:** The dartboards were placed at opposite sides of the testing chamber. The dart was thrown from the chamber's entrance with the intent to hit both targets. \n\n**Results:** Upon being thrown, the dart's tip separated from the body and ricocheted to the blue dartboard. The green dartboard was placed in front of a vent, which began blowing at maximum capacity and sent the green dartboard to the remaining half of the dart.  \n\n**Notes:** //I checked the dart beforehand, but there were no defects.// --S. Pataro \n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Researcher H. Fernandez\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** A standard dartboard standing behind a reinforced metal wall.\n**Procedure:** A D-class was instructed to throw the dart at the dartboard knowing that it was lying behind the wall.\n\n**Results:** The dart did not reach the dartboard.\n\n**Notes:** //I thought I was onto something here. Should've read the file first.// --H. Fernandez \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Researcher T. Zara\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** A standard dartboard.\n**Procedure:** A D-class previously tested to have naturally high skill at dart-throwing was instructed to aim at the target, but close their eyes before letting go of the dart.\n\n**Results:** As the dart was thrown the dartboard came loose from the wall and fell to the ground. The dart struck the wall, close to where the bullseye would be had the dartboard not fallen off.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Test Overseer:** Dr. G. Krause\n\n**Projectile:** Standard dart.\n**Target Object:** Standard dartboard, positioned behind a freestanding reinforced metal wall. A standing mirror is positioned perpendicular to the wall.\n**Procedure:** Intend to hit the target through the wall, using the mirror to maintain a clear line of sight to the target.\n\n**Results:** Precisely as the dart was thrown, the testing personnel experienced a muscle spasm in their left calf, causing them to stumble, resulting in the throw being wildly inaccurate from the intended target. The dart struck the mirror, shattering it. Following the experiment, recording equipment revealed the location of impact was the center of the dartboard's reflection.\n[[/div]]",
