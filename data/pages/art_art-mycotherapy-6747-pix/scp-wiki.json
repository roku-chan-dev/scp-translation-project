I LOVE this article. So much so that I read it all the way through like 3 times to make SURE I was explaining it properly STILL didn't get tired of it. Despite that, I'm 99% sure I misunderstood or explained SOMETHING wrong in the video. A 50-second video is not a lot of time to explain such a long article.\n\nI've been lurking for years on this site before joining but even still I somehow never paid attention to any of the content focused on researcher characters so I had to write a book report on these characters to make them recognizable in the drawing. I still know nothing and don't think I accomplished it for anyone besides Clef.\n\nI'm sorry everyone I've failed you. But hey! This is still one of my favorite ones I've done so far. Definitely one of the most involved animations. I think this article deserves it.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
