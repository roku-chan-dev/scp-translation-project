Due to the low-risk nature of SCP-029-J, police reports are to be monitored for potential reports of SCP-029-J.  Class A amnestics are to be administered as necessary.  At this time, no additional containment procedures are required, pending review yearly on 1/12 or as needed.\n\n##red|{DEPRECATED AS OF 4/21/17: Foundation Agents are to attempt to contact SCP-029-J in order to attempt to discern more stringent containment procedures.}##  At this time, for resource and sanity reasons, additional attempts to contact SCP-029-J are not considered conducive to study, and are to be discontinued.\n\n**Description:** SCP-029-J is an adult male of apparent Middle Eastern descent, who claims to be Jesus Christ.  SCP-029-J is exclusively found in the Newark, New Jersey area, posing as a for-hire driver using the application Uber.  Foundation Agents contacted Uber to request the driving records and registration of SCP-029-J.  No records were found.\n\nUpon being assigned to a subject's request, SCP-029-J's vehicle is listed as \"A flaming hot ride\", of the current year, and is always 1 minute from the pick up location.  Of note, the Uber application does not allow this to be listed as a model name.  SCP-029-J's vehicle has been determined to be a multi-entity combination designated SCP-029-J-1 through SCP-029-J-4.\n\nSCP-029-J's vehicle has been shown to take a variety of appearances. This ability is contingent upon the concentration of SCP-029-J-1 through -4.  These entities have to date, proven easily distracted, leading to a high incidence of sightings of SCP-029-J, especially around the Christmas and Easter holidays.\n\nThe entities that comprise SCP-029-J's vehicle are as follows:\n\n* SCP-029-J-1 has been identified as a Throne\n * Thrones are depicted as great wheels containing many eyes, and reside in the area of the cosmos where material form begins to take shape. They are usually depicted as the literal movers of the throne of God.  SCP-029-J-1 takes the physical form of all four wheels.\n* SCP-029-J-2 has been identified as a Seraphim, and most likely as Michael\n * Seraphim are usually depicted as having six wings, one pair covering the face, another the feet, the last to fly with.  They are not normally depicted as humanoid. SCP-029-2 makes up the chassis.\n* SCP-029-J-3 has been identified as an Archangel, mostly likely Gabriel\n * Depictions of Gabriel usually include a horn of some variety with which he proclaims God's majesty.  Reports of Gabriel's physical form vary. SCP-029-J appears to only include Gabriel's voice, and is the radio and sound system.\n* SCP-029-J-4 has been identified as a group of 12 Cherubim\n * Cherubim have varying descriptions from four wings and four feet, to even having four faces, and extraordinarily complicated arrangements of faces and wings, feet and glowing coals in their mouths.  Reports are inconsistent, varied, and almost invariably inhuman and eldritch.  SCP-029-J-4 are situated in front of SCP-029-J-1 through -3 and pull the entire collection, as draft animals.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 1: Remote Surveillance\" hide=\"Close Addendum\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black;\n    border-style: double;\n    /* width: 50%; */\n    /* float: none; */\n    /* height: 50%; */\n    background-color: white;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    padding-right: 20px;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/int.png width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\"]]\n++ Prepared by the Department of Intelligence\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Reporter:**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nAgents Ricciardi and Stokes\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Date of Report**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nDec 21, 2016\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Incident**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nCollection of remote surveilance\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n__**Summary**__\n[[/=]]\n> \n> SCP-029-J has appeared with a 1.7% chance to date, to any particular user's request.

I've lead God's forces to glory for thousands of battles.  I'm supposed to be your general, but now I'm climate control for lazy millenials today.  Sheesh.\n> \n> //SCP-029-J-2 ceases to appear as a late model sedan, and can be seen in its angelic form (See Description).  Its wings make up the bulk of the vehicle's chassis, with its face situated where the rear axle should be. SCP-026-J-1 continues to appear as non-anomalous wheels.//\n> \n> **McIntyre:** Holy fuck, what the fuck! Jesus Christ, what the hell is this?!\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Hey!  That's not very nice!  Don't be a dick to Mike and Ray!\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-2:** Yeah what the deuce, lady.  I've got human butt meat on my face, and you're screaming at me?!  I'm trying to do you a favor with the fire here!\n> \n> //SCP-029-J-2 returns to its physical appearance of a late-model sedan.

Alright, open the door, Mike.\n> \n> //SCP-029-J-2 opens its side door, and McIntyre quickly exits in to the building.//\n> \n> **McIntyre:** FREAK!\n> \n> //Several moments pass in silence.//\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** So...think she's gonna tip us?\n>\n\n------\n[[=]]\n__**Final Notes**__\n[[/=]]\n> According to SCP-029-J's profile, it was rated 1 star for this ride.\n> \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 2: Direct Foundation Contact\" hide=\"Close Addendum\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black;\n    border-style: double;\n    /* width: 50%; */\n    /* float: none; */\n    /* height: 50%; */\n    background-color: white;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    padding-right: 20px;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/int.png width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\"]]\n++ Prepared by the Department of Intelligence\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Reporter:**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nAgents Mathews\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Date of Report**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nApril 24, 2017\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Incident**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nDirect contact with object\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n[[=]]\n__**Summary**__\n[[/=]]\n> \n> On 4/19/2017  Foundation agents successfully acquired SCP-029-J as their driver after [REDACTED] unsuccessful attempts.  SCP-029-J simultaneously picked up 12 separate containment teams at the same time.  The following is a transcript between SCP-029-J,  the various entities that make up SCP-029-J's vehicle, and Agent Mathews; an expert in Abrahamic religious studies and a trained field agent.\n> \n\n------\n[[=]]\n__**Transcript of Encounter**__\n[[/=]]\n> \n> **Involved Foundation Assets:** Agent James Mathews, Level 2, Religious Containment - Abrahamics\n> \n> **Encountered Anomalies:** SCP-029-J, SCP-029-J-1, SCP-029-J-2, SCP-029-J-3, SCP-029-J-4\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Alright, you guys have been trying to get me in to containment for what feels like forty eons, so I guess we should talk.\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** Excuse me?

Vroom vroom!\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Yeah.  Me, Ray, Mike, Gabe, and the Cherubs.  I was just gonna have Ray do it, but it wasn't a great idea. He's a kick ass set of wheels-within-wheels but he doesn't get XM radio.  I guess you could say, this is a real //electric// car!  Ha!\n> \n> //Several moments pass in silence//\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** See, in the Septuagint חשמל was translated as ἤλεκτρον, and from there...\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** No, I got it. I'm one of maybe four people in the world who would get that joke, and it still wasn't funny.\n> \n> //SCP-029-J-3 ceases playing the Jesus Christ Superstar soundtrack.//\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-3:** Awkward.

And it's driven by Jesus?\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Give this man a shekel! I figured if I do this, people can really get to know their savior.\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** Okay, so isn't your chariot supposed to have this giant multitude of angels, move the heavens and the earth, everything like that?\n> \n> //SCP-029-J hesitates for a moment//\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Uuuusually, yes.  Circumstances were slightly different.  Dad wouldn't lend me the regular throne-chariot.  So instead, I've got my own sweet whip to drive people around in.\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** Sweet...wh..okay.  So why did all of the angels help?\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-1:** I owed him for a taco, and he said we'd be square.\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-2:** He said he'd watch my dogs next weekend while I'm in Cabo.\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-3:** I just like singing!\n> \n> **SCP-029-J-4:** Wait, this is voluntary?\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** Okay one last question.\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** Of course.\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** Why do the Cherubim look like corgis?\n> \n> **SCP-029-J:** They always look like that.  How do you guys keep getting the descriptions so wrong?\n> \n> **Agent Mathews:** I'd like to get out of the car, please.\n> \n\n------\n[[=]]\n__**Final Notes**__\n[[/=]]\n> After this incident, containment procedures were updated to reflect the current state.\n> \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n------\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 3: Human Resources Request\" hide=\"Close Addendum\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: 1px solid black;\n    border-style: double;\n    /* width: 50%; */\n    /* float: none; */\n    /* height: 50%; */\n    background-color: white;\n    display: inline-block;\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    padding-right: 20px;\"]]\n[[=image https://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/admin.png width=\"50px\" height=\"50px\"]]\n++ Prepared by the Department of Human Resources\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Reporter:**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nAgent Mathews\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Date of Report**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nApr 30, 2017\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"boxType\"]]\n[[div class=\"boxText\"]]\n**Content**\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"boxValue\"]]\nAgent Mathews' resignation letter, in its entirety\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n> \n> I am not studying Jesus' fucking voltron angel car anymore.\n> \n\n[[/collapsible]]",
