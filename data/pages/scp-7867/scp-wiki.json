It is to be fed 23 kilograms [[footnote]]The equivalent of 50.7lbs.[[/footnote]]of raw meat twice a day. This is to be delivered either by guards or PoI-2813. PoI-2813 must be supervised by guards during feeding.\n\nIf SCP-7867 displays any signs of aggression or begins to harm itself, Nitrous Oxide is to be released into the containment chamber until SCP-7867 is rendered fully unconscious.\n\nPoI-2813 is to be held in a standard humanoid containment chamber. It is to be provided 3 Grade-B meals daily. PoI-2813 is to have weekly tutoring sessions with Dr. Donnie Heller.\n\nBoth SCP-7867 and PoI-2813 are to undergo weekly counseling sessions with Dr. Lexie Hubert.\n\n-------------\n\n**Description:** SCP-7867 is an SK-BIO Type-007 Instance[[footnote]]An amalgamation of multiple species.[[/footnote]], though it is able to have a stable form of a male African Lion (//Panthera Leo//), measuring on average 2.6 meters in length from the head to the buttocks. SCP-7867 stands at a height of 1.5 meters. 2 humanoid arms extrude from SCP-7867’s back. Its tail is similar to that of an Iguana, being 2.7 meters in length and covered in quills with a bone pike at the end. There are 2 additional functioning mouths on both palms of the humanoid limbs. SCP-7867 has an unhinged jaw to feast on larger prey similar to a snake. It uses several appendages from its mouth to grapple victims over a long distance.\n\n\nEvery time SCP-7867 finishes consuming an organism, SCP-7867 can alter its anatomy and structure to replicate the organism’s physical, genetic, and neurological characteristics. SCP-7867 also exhibits advanced regenerative capabilities.\n\n\nSCP-7867 is capable of communication. However, its behavior changes at random, followed by its speech and vocals. Moreover, SCP-7867 will claim that whatever identity it presents is the real self, although PoI-2813 always refers to SCP-7867 as “Levushka.”\n\n\nPoI-2813 is a 12-year-old humanoid male of Chechen descent. PoI-2813 does not have any anomalous attributes. Due to SCP-7867's aggression in its discovery, as well as previously attempting to breach containment, PoI-2813 was sent to remain by its side.\n--------\n**Addendum-1-Discovery:** Local hikers claimed to have seen a disfigured lion in Great Smokey Mountains National Park in Tennessee. Following 22 missing person reports in the week of 2008-02-17 wherein the person went missing within the park, MTF Zeta-13 was dispatched to locate the anomaly. Upon locating SCP-7867, the team attempted to capture it, however, they were attacked by PoI-2813 and SCP-7867, resulting in the death of 1 member of Zeta-13. Following the capture of SCP-7867 and PoI-2813, all exposed civilians were administered Class-B amnestics.\n\n--------\n\n**Addendum-2-Interviews:** \n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Access Interview with Dr. Lexie Hubert\" hide=\"- Close Interview with Dr. Lexie Huburt\"]]\n\n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Interviewed:** SCP-7867 & PoI-2813\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Hubert, Lexie\n\n---------\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Hi there.\n\n//No response//\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** I’m Lexie, and I’m just here to talk.\n\n//Still no response//\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Okay… That’s quite the pet you have there.

Do you work?\n\n**SCP-7867:** Oh nothing special. A waiter at IHOP. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** No way! I love IHOP. I usually go on Saturdays but it always gets packed in the morning. But that’s good business for you, right?\n\n**SCP-7867:** For them, yeah. But for me, no. The school is closed every weekend. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** School? Didn’t you say you worked in an IHOP?\n\n**SCP-7867:** No. I’m a PE teacher.\n\n//Lexie writes on her clipboard.// \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Okay? What grade do you teach?\n\n**SCP-7867:** High school. I only do Juniors and Seniors though.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Hope they're not too much trouble. \n\n**SCP-7867:** Surprisingly not. We got some pretty good teams. Women's baseball is heading to their Semi-finals. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** You should be proud of them. What team are they going against?\n\n**SCP-7867:** My team. The New York Mets.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Uh, pardon?\n\n**SCP-7867:** Yeah, we’re going against the Texas Rangers next week. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** So you’re a waiter, a PE teacher, and a Mets player?\n\n**SCP-7867:** No, I’m just a Mets player.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Are you positive?\n\n**SCP-7867:** Yeah, why wouldn’t I be? Tell her Edmon.\n\n**PoI-2813:** Yes.\n\n**SCP-7867:** See?\n\n//Dr. Hubert jots on her clipboard//\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Uh-huh. Well, I’m more of a Yankee’s girl. \n\n**SCP-7867:** Booooo. By the way, can someone tell me what time it is?\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** It’s 2 pm.\n\n**SCP-7867 (Elderly male voice):** Aw shucks. I forgot my meds. Don’t tell my doctor, she'll get on my ass. “You’re 72!” She says. “You need to take better care of yourself.” She says.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Didn’t you say you were 43? \n\n**SCP-7867:** No. But I wish! What I am though is hungry. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** We’ll give you something to eat once we’re done, yeah?\n\n//SCP-7867 remains silent and stares at Lexie.//\n\n**PoI-2813:** Please give him something.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** I’m sorry but-\n\n**SCP-7867:** MINUN TÄYTYY SYÖDÄ! [[footnote]]\"I must eat.\" in Finnish.[[/footnote]]\n\n//SCP-7867 charges to the window and slams headfirst on the glass causing Dr. Hubert to fall back from her stool and press herself against the wall. SCP-7867 opens its mouth and presses it on the glass while scratching it with all of its limbs. The Nitrous Oxide gas activates and fills the room, knocking out both PoI-2813 and SCP-7867.//\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n\n [[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Access Interview 5\" hide=\"- Close Interview 5:\"]]\n\n [[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n **Interviewed:** SCP-7867 & PoI-2813\n \n **Interviewer:**  Dr. Hubert, Lexie\n \n **Foreword:** SCP-7867 fell ill during this interview. \n\n----------\n \n **<Begin Log>**\n\n **Dr. Hubert:** Afternoon, Edmon.

Why wouldn't I be?\n\n**PoI-2813:** You look like you're stressed.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:**...I-(clears throat) got a call from my husband, earlier. Said that my son got suspended. Again.\n\n**PoI-2813:** You have a son?\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Yep. (She sighs and leans back from her chair) I don't know why he always does this. I try having him tell me what's wrong but- oh sorry. I didn't mean to make this about me.\n\n**PoI-2813:** It's okay.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** I wonder if I'm doing a good job.\n\n**PoI-2813:** I think he’s lucky to have you.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Thanks. I appreciate that.\n\n**PoI-2813:** I wished my parents were like you.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** What do you mean?\n\n**PoI-2813:** They kept hurting me. They turned my brother into...this.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Do you know how they did it?\n\n**PoI-2813:** No. But my father always had this camera with him when we were doing our trials. Maybe he had something in that?\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Do you know where the camera is?\n\n **PoI-2813:** It's probably still at my house. In the basement. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** And where's your house?\n\n**PoI-2813:** 1641 Arbon Ct, Gatlinburg.\n\n**<End Log>**\n\n [[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\nAfter confirming the address from PoI-2813, a team was dispatched to the address and searched the residency. No person was found within, although the team commented on a foul odor. When they moved down to the basement, what was found is as followed:\n\n* Dried blood and chunks of meat splattered across the walls. \n* A variety of detached limbs\n* A Sony Handycam CCD-TRV23E Digital 8 Camcorder on the ground \n* A broken tripod. \n* 7 Sony DVM60PRL DVC Camcorder tapes \n* 30-foot long rope\n* 5-inch piece of duct tape\n\nThe team returned to Site-63 with the camcorder and tapes.

A woman is laying on a towel, watching the two. She looks at the camera and hides her face behind her hands.//\n\n**Elina:** No! Put it away!\n\n**Ivan:** But I don't want to.\n\n**Elina:** I said put it away! \n\n**Ivan:** But you look so gorgeous! \n\n//The camera zooms into her face and she peeks.//\n\n**Elina:** Nooo! \n\n//The woman laughs and turns away from the camera. The man laughs too, pointing the camera at him. Showing his medium-length black curly hair and full beard.//\n\n//Footage cuts and the date is 07/21/1999. It shows a wooden longboat. It pans and shows other passengers with a man holding a microphone speaking Portuguese. Panning to the right, the footage shows the lush green rainforest and brown murky waters. A Tamarin Monkey jumps from its branch and on top of the boat. It climbs down crawls under the seats. It jumps and sits next to Ivan holding one of his sons on his lap. The baby tries to grab it when it is not looking but he ended up grabbing the tail. The monkey jumps and approaches the baby cautiously. The baby still tries to grab it but the monkey takes the hat and climbs away from the boat. Gasping and laughter can be heard and the baby is crying.//\n\n//Footage cuts again and the date is 9/19/1999. The two sons are trying to walk to their father. They climb on top of each other and use each other as support to get them standing. Eventually, one of them makes it and the other has to crawl.//\n\n**Ivan:** Good job Levushka! \n\n//He picks up his son and spins around. Levushka pukes on his arm.//\n\n//Footage cuts and the date is 02/08/2000. The footage shows a birthday party with other family members. Some shots show balloons with the number 3 around the room. Singing can be heard in the Russian Happy Birthday song. When they finish, the two boys try blowing out the candles but with no success. After a few more seconds of blowing, one of them uses a paper plate to blow the candles out and succeeds. Cheering is then heard.//\n\n----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Video Tape #2\" hide=\"- Video Tape #2\"]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 06/10/2003\n\n**NOTE:** The following has been translated from Russian to English.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Footage shows a gathering in the woods.

They walk to the figure who is holding a wooden bowl.// \n\n\n**Figure:** Please remove your clothes and turn around.\n\n//The couple removes their son's shirts first and then themselves. The figure takes his fingers in the bowl and paints a seal on each of their backs. After the figure finishes, others pour buckets of blood surrounding the family.

However, he was weakened and did not have enough light to empower the little one. One came forward, “take mine,” and another, “mine as well.” Soon all banded together in hopes that they can aid Ozimorok so that he may lead them to salvation. The once-fallen cub had finally risen and was given the name, Narok. Becoming a mighty and prideful beast. With a heart of an army that beats within.”\n\n**Ivan:** I don’t understand.\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Long story short. You need a corpse. A fresh one that has to be a child and you pour that into it. That should give you who or whatever this champion, Narok, was. Or at least their power.\n\n**Elina:** Why a child? Can’t it be an adult?\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Hold on. “Once, there was a man who sought the champion's blood. He waited until they had slumbered. When he drew his blade and cut their tail, Narok knawed at his wrist in return. Narok tasted the tainted blood and requested Ozimorok to put a curse on themself. Should anyone heartbeat so foul seek their blood, they shall know only agony and silence.” Do you both understand?\n\n**Ivan:** Tainted blood… So it needs to have somebody who is pure? And supposedly that’s children. Because the gift was given to some child? \n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Now you're catching on. \n\n**Elina:** And anyone who isn’t pure dies. Adults. \n\n**Mr. Rowe:** You're on the right track, there.\n\n**Ivan:** But didn’t it say earlier that people gave their power to them to make it stronger?\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Well. We don’t know what that exactly entails. \n\n//There was silence from the couple.//\n\n**Ivan:** Thank you for your time, Mr. Rowe. Although, this doesn't explain how we set this up.\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** My pleasure. And no worries, I'll come back next week to take a look. (Yawns) Although what you have is older than our history.  Where did you find this?\n\n**Ivan:** You don’t need to worry about that. What matters is that we have it. And now thanks to you, we'll know what to do…(mutters)\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** What was that?\n\n**Ivan:** It’s nothing.\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** May I ask how long have you lived here in America?\n\n**Elina:** Two years.\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Hmm. Why did you go through all this trouble for this anyway? If you don’t mind me asking.\n\n**Ivan:** When we were in Russia, and this was a long time ago, I had an accident that had crippled me for quite a long while. To keep it brief, I was saved by this \"woman\", so to say. What she did… It was like being touched by a higher power. I wanted to feel that again and more. I felt like I could do and be anything. If this scroll is the way to do it, then I’ll risk it all for me and my family.\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Well, if you think you can pull it off. I want in.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Video Tape #7\" hide=\"- Video Tape #7\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 02/08/2008\n\n\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//Footage shows a concrete room with members in dark garbs present. Ivan walks to the crowd, his back facing away from the camera. Slight muffling and thumping is heard in the background//\n\n**Ivan:** I would like to thank you all for helping me set up this final trial for my son, Levushka. In your diligence and faith in me, you may all be granted our people’s gift back when it was first used in the First War of the Flesh. And pay no attention to Edmon. He's lucky that I want him to bear witness to his brother's greatness. Are there any questions?\n\n**Member 2:** Yeah, you think your kid here might get loose? \n\n**Ivan:** We tripled check the knots. I don't think he's going anywhere.\n\n**Member 5**: How come he isn’t going up there? Wouldn’t it be better if we had two of these “champions” on our side?\n\n**Ivan:** One is all we need. Any other questions? \n\n//Silence//\n\n**Ivan:** Let’s begin. You. Go and make sure he stays quiet. Elina!\n\n//One member walks out of the frame and moments later, the muffling stops. Elina holds Levushka's hand walking into the frame with him wearing a white gown.//\n\n**Levushka:** Mom. Who are these people?\n\n**Elina:** They're friends of your father, and they've come to help us.\n\n**Ivan:** Levushka. Come to me. \n\n//Elina lets go of his hand and Levushka walks to his father. He nervously glances at the other men staring down at him. Levushka is in front of Ivan, and he bends down a knee.//\n\n **Ivan:** If someone were to tell me that you would be chosen as our champion. I wouldn't believe them. My son, you've always had potential, and have shown it time and time again. \n\n //Ivan places his hands on his shoulders.//\n\n**Ivan:** I don't know what you'll become after this. But no matter what form you take, I'm certain that you'll shine brighter than most, if not, all of us. Now that I think of it, I've picked the most fitting name for you. Do you know what your name means?\n\n**Levushka:** No.\n\n**Ivan:** It means \"Lion.\"\n\n//Silence in the room.//\n\n**Ivan:** Now Levushka. I need you to lay down on your back. On this circle. I also need you to take your robe off, above the waist is fine. \n\n//Levushka does what he's told and slips the robes off. He keeps his hand on his head while the other men surround him and hold him down. Ivan pulls a dagger from his robe pocket//\n\n**Levushka:** What are you doing!?\n\n//Levushka squirms and thrashes. The other men visibly being shaking from trying to keep him still. Ivan raises the dagger.//\n\n**Levushka:** Podozhdi, podozhdi, podozhdi, podozhdi! Papa, pozhaluysta, ne delay etogo! Pozhaluysta ostanovis'! Pozhaluysta pozhaluysta pozhaluysta!\n\n//Muffled screams can be heard in the background.//\n\n//Ivan sinks the knife into his chest and Levushka loudly cries. Ivan drags the knife down to his stomach. Levushka's cries turn to gurgles and gags. His thrashings were slowing. Levushka's gurgles go quiet. Ivan takes the container and opens the lid. He pours a black liquid into the gaping chest until it's empty. Faint sobbing is heard.// \n\n//Ivan and the other members slowly stand.//\n\n**Mr. Rowe:** Nothing's happening. \n\n**Ivan:** Give it time. He'll rise.\n\n //10 seconds later and nothing happens.//\n\n**Elina:** Ivan?\n\n**Ivan:** Just a moment. \n\n //Another 12 seconds pass and nothing happens.//\n\n**Elina:** Oh my god... Oh my God, Ivan!\n\n**Member 2:** Oh shit! I think we fucked up!\n\n**Ivan:** We didn't! We followed the instructions. So everything is fine!\n\n**Member 3:** Written thousands of fucking years ago! \n\n**Ivan:** I'm certain that we've followed everything right!\n\n**Elina:** Ivan, what the fuck did you do?!\n\n**Ivan:** Nothing!\n\n**Member 7:** We just killed a kid!\n\n//The members pace around the basement, removing their hoods. Some rub their heads while glancing at his corpse. One other throws up at the corner. Elina goes to Ivan, punching and screaming at him. Ivan holds her wrist. She stops and collapses on the floor. One member looks down at the body and tilts his head.//\n\n**Member 12:** Hey... Guys... EVERYONE SHUT UP!\n\n//Silence//\n\n**Member 12:** Look! \n\n//He points at Levushkla who's coughing blood.//\n\n**Ivan:** (Faintly laughs) See! See! I told you! I told you we did it right!\n\n//Elina crawls to Levushka and holds his cheeks still crying. Ivan kneels beside her, looking at his son.// \n\n**Ivan:** Levushka, how are you feeling?\n\n//Levushka stays silent for 5 seconds and screeches that rise in volume.//\n\n//Tendrils erupt from his chest and latch onto his parents first, pulling them down. Other tendrils erupt and lash around the basement, grabbing onto every member who was trying to run and hide from them. The camera knocks down to its side and the lens crack. It shows running legs and someone kicks it, spinning on the floor and coming to a halt against the wall. The tendrils drag the members from their necks, arms, legs, and waist. SCP-7867 roars with its massive mouth to chew on them one by one with its enormous blob of a body growing by every victim. One of the tendrils strikes the lightbulb and everything goes black.//\n\n//13 seconds later, only whines echo in the basement. Sounds of rope being cut are also heard with heavy breaths. The rope snaps and the sound of a piece of glass drops on the concrete floor. The sounds of footsteps pass the camera//\n\n**SCP-7867:** It huuurrts...Edmoooon... heeellpp meeeee...\n\n**Edmon:** I-it's okay... (sniffle) I'm h-here...We're going to leave, okay? Right now.

It helps us better understand you and your brother a lot.  Is there anything you'd like to add? Something that wasn't shown in the tapes?\n\n**PoI-2813:** No. All he ever cared about was his beliefs and comparing me to Levushka.\n\n//Pause//\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** Has your father ever introduced you to the woman who saved him?\n\n**PoI-2813:** Mm-mm. Never. He only talked about her after his accident. I think we were still toddlers. But since then, well. You've seen how he was.\n\n//Pause//\n\n**PoI-2813:** I don't understand why he had to do all of that.

I'm truly sorry.\n\n//5-second pause//\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** So what happened after you left the house?\n\n**PoI-2813** We hid in the woods for...I don't know how long. \n\n**Dr. Hubert:** 9 days. From the time you left to when we found you.\n\n**PoI-2813:** 9 days... Bog. Eto kazalos' dol'she.\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** What happened during that time?\n\n**PoI-2813:** We had to find food, every day. At first, it was just the animals, big and small. Eating it raw. That was until I spotted a truck, and Levushka chased it. By the time I got there, he'd changed into a combination of all the zoo animals that were in there, as well as the driver. I found a lighter and used that to cook the meat after that. There were times, he would get so hungry that he'd hunt on his own, and come back angry with nothing. I found people walking around the woods and call them to help me. When they were far enough from the trail, Levushka would pounce and eat them. \n\n//7-second pause.//\n\n**PoI-2813:** Am I bad?\n\n**Dr. Hubert:**...I don't know how to answer that.\n\n**PoI-2813:** Do you know Važjuma?\n\n**Dr. Hubert:** In a way, yes.\n\n**PoI-2813:** Do you worship her?\n\n**Dr. Hubert**: No. I don't.\n\n**PoI-2813**: ...

And for my second-born son, he was always the one to do things first before you could. From taking his first steps, to finally passing his trial, and now this. Time and time again, he's shown more worth than you. And you hated him for it. You hated him because you were always in his shadow.
