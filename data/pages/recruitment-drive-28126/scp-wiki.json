Corporate Spy Kenya Jordan[[footnote]] Worker ID: CORPS82635100 [[/footnote]] informed several of her coworkers in the SCP Foundation of new positions at the location. While they were not initially interested, after a short tour of the facility, and contact with an elder foreman in charge of recruitment, they changed their minds. \n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"colspan=\"2\"]]\nTRIGGER:\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nAll three prospective employees entered the Southeastern Indiana Distribution Center, and spoke with Receptionist Cynthia Klein, who kindly asked they wait until the employment representative could speak with them. Several positive comments were observed from the prospective employees:\n\n> Jesus Christ! Did you see her legs? They were beyond atrophied. It almost looks like she's growing out of that chair. How long has she been here? God...\n> \n> -  SCP Foundation Employee Daniel Finch\n\nWhen you work hard, you too can get compliments like this. Keep up the hard work, Cynthia!\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nORDER OF EVENTS\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n**Actor Action**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n**Factory Response**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nWhile waiting for Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth to begin the interviews, SCP Foundation Employee Emilio Delgado Ruiz decided to contact other SCP Foundation Employees about this excellent employment opportunity. \n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nHowever, due to company policy, cellphone and radio use is prohibited. Because of this, the call was intercepted and the prospective employees were encouraged to explore the facility and become acquainted with their new working environment. \n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> Sorry, Emilio, but we don't have any agents in the area that can provide backup. That particular Factory location is a non-dangerous one, so I'd encourage you to try to get a bit further in, find some intel. I'll see if I can scramble a team or two from the nearby site. Over and out.\n> \n> - Factory Supplied Response [[/footnote]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nFollowing this response, all three prospective employees moved to the distribution floor to meet their new co-workers. Today was a busy day, so few employees had the chance to stop their work and speak with the prospective employees. \n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nOnce the prospective employees had left the main lobby area, Worker Jesse Lenz volunteered to go to Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth's office in the basement, to inform him that the interviewees were present in the facility. Unfortunately, Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth had not had the chance to take a lunch break yet this month and had to terminate Worker Jesse Lenz' employment to fulfill himself. \n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> We would like to thank Worker Jesse Lenz for taking the initiative in doing this difficult task. Once his remains are secreted from Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth, we would love to offer him new employment in a management position. Taking initiative like this is exactly the kind of behavior we need in our managers.

With this thought, he directed them towards Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth's office in the basement.\n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> Foundation agents? Oh thank god! Are you here to get us out? Please! There's more of us in the basement. Please get us out of here. Please.\n> \n> - Worker Stanley Belle's communication with prospective employees\n[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nThe three prospective employees found the entrance to the basement as directed by Worker Stanley Belle and began their descent. Due to the basement's size, they did have some trouble finding their interview location. These positive comments about the basement's layout and decor were observed. \n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> I'm glad you reminded me about the flashlights, Sue. It's fucking dark in here. Let's not spend too much time looking for those people, this place is giving me the creeps. Emilio, can you check on that backup?\n> \n> - SCP Foundation Employee Daniel Finch [[/footnote]]\n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> I'm not getting a response. I think these pipes are the issue. Looks like they're made of copper or lead, pretty old. They're fucking with my signal. I think we need to get out of here. \n> \n> - SCP Foundation Employee Emilio Delgado Ruiz [[/footnote]]\n\n[[footnote]] \n@@@@\n> I-I swear there was a turn here. I'm not going insane, guys. You gotta believe me. I think the walls are moving. Fuck... Fuck... We have to get out of here.\n> \n> - SCP Foundation Employee Susan Weiss-Hardoff [[/footnote]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nAfter Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth was informed of the prospective employees and finished his lunch break, he quickly found them wandering the basement trying to find his office. He guided them to the waiting area outside his office as he prepped for the interview. Once his preparations were completed, he had SCP Foundation Employee Emilio Delgado Ruiz enter his office for his interview. The other prospective employees were understandably nervous about being interviewed. Interviews can always be a nerve-wracking experience, and Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth made sure not to let their nerves harm their individual interviews.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nEmilio's interview went superbly. Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth noted his skill and experience with a firearm and suggested he be given a security position. Once Emilio's interview was completed, he was removed from the office to begin the orientation process. Following Emilio, Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth chose SCP Foundation Employee Daniel Finch for the next interview.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nDuring Daniel's interview, SCP Foundation Employee Susan Weiss-Hardoff let her nerves get the better of her and attempted to remove herself from the interview process through the use of a firearm. However, since she was already so far in the hiring process, The Factory kept the wound from negatively impacting her interview.\n\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nDaniel's interview was discouraging, as he was largely unresponsive, choosing to remain in the corner of Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth's office. Despite this, Steve recognized Daniel's hardworking potential and suggested he become a worker. Following Daniel's interview, he was started on the orientation process and SCP Foundation Employee Susan Weiss-Hardoff was escorted into the office. \n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 0 1%\"]]\nSusan's interview was fairly short. Elder Foreman Steve Al'uth felt she would be a good fit for the Factory's public relations department, and she was promptly moved to the orientation center. \n\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"colspan=\"2\"]]\nRESULTS/FOLLOW UP\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black;  padding: 0 1%\" colspan=\"2\"]]\nAll three potential employees have completed the interview and orientation process.
