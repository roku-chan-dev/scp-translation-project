A fear, that sees no blood, hears no screams, insensitive to all but the darkness around it. If no weapon can harm them, no blade pierce their shield, then let the stench of fear gas them out into the daylight, where all the world will converge upon them, and by the end of the feast nothing will be left but their bones.\n\n**1. STEP 14/126**\n\nMaintain exposure of agent to Subject 207 within Procedure Centre 28. Keep surgery to a minimum in prevention of shock. If subject continues to show unrest, administer amnestics prior to and after every surgery procedure.\n\n**2. STEP 14/248**\n\nBegin Procedure 28 on Subject 207. Commence with chemical editing of the amygdala when possible.\n\n**3. STEP 14/476**\n\nStaff suffering from a psychological unrest when dealing with Subject 207 are to be removed from the program. I don't need people breaking-down in the middle of surgery procedures.\n\n**4. STEP 14/886**\n\nBegin Preparation Phase 01 on Subject 207. Sterilize the facility.\n\n**5. STEP 14/895**\n\nBegin Preparation Phase 02 on Subject 207.\n\n**6. STEP 15/232**\n\nExpected Foundation raid on Facility 14. Evacuate all required personnel attributed to Procedure 28. Burn all documentation on related material.\n\n**7. STEP 15/524**\n\nBegin testing of Procedure 29 on Subject 207. Remain cautious. Procedure 28 to be terminated. Gamma-class staff involved to take amnestic prescriptions. Subject 207 to be moved to Detention Centre 18 prior to movement to Experimentation Centre 05.\n\n**8. STEP 15/884**\n\nAuthorised testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-15/884-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 02-05-2015\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Foster\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Livestock (poultry); death from shock on 18/20 cases. Average survival time: 28.11 minutes. Livestock (cattle); attempted retaliation on 9/10 cases. Experimentation ceased after possible threat of injury to Subject 207. Cattle appear able to resist attacks and psychological trauma presented by Subject 207.\n\n**9. STEP 16/110**\n\nTransfer to Procedure Centre 28. Re-enact Procedure 30. Begin usage of steroid and hormone-growth agents of Subject 207. End when seen adequate for safe, further testing.\n\n**10. STEP 16/308**\n\nAuthorised further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-16/308-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 15-06-2015\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Foster\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Livestock (poultry); death from stroke/heart attack on 5/5 cases. Average survival time: 5.42 minutes. Livestock (cattle) attempted retaliation on 3/20 cases. Average survival time: 12.41 minutes. Suggest an increased focus on the maximum psychological trauma subject is able to inflict.\n\n**11. STEP 16/441**\n\nFurther surgery on Subject 207 required. Increase exposure to agent by 11%. Transfer to Procedure Centre 28. Commence Semi-Procedure 30-1. Once complete, commence Semi-Procedure 30-2, utilising the exposure of psychoactive drugs on a biweekly basis. Remove Medical Procedure Team 7 from program and replace with specialised team invulnerable to catatonia while performing procedures on 207. End when seen adequate for further testing.\n\n**12. STEP 16/821**\n\nAuthorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to livestock. Introduce equine livestock. Remove poultry from experimentation.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-16/821-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 24-11-2015\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Foster\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Livestock (cattle) attempted escape 10/10 cases. Average survival time: 36.44 minutes. Livestock (equine) attempted retaliation. Average survival time: 1.24 minutes. Subject 207 has proven ability to harm larger prey. Mechanism of releasing prey near death effective. Should be preserved in further iterations.\n\n**13. STEP 17/011**\n\nRemove Dr. Foster from manager of Procedure-28. Suspected psychological unrest. Record incident on medical logs, and deny future access to further psychologically unsettling procedures.\n\n**14. STEP 17/045**\n\nMove Subject 207 to Procedure Centre 31, and perform Procedure 31, involving skeletal/anatomical reconfiguration. Expect intense trauma from 207. Cancel removal of bone-marrow due to near-death experience. Authorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to equine (group) livestock after surgery (allowing 8 maximum days of recovery).\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/045-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 12-03-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Grant\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Livestock group attempted escape. Subject targets most panicked experimental prey. Subject able to maintain constant speed with persistent stamina, capable of stalking for considerable lengths of time. Observed to attack utilising shock as a primary vantage over experimental prey. Results positive. Suggest continued experimentation.\n\n**15. STEP 17/157**\n\nAuthorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to domesticated animals.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/157-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 30-05-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Grant\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Experimental Prey(s) 1-12 (German Shepherd breed of domesticated dog) died from blood-loss and shock after encounter with Subject 207. Average survival time: 8.15 minutes. Subject 207 suffered minimal injuries. Results promising.\n\n**16. STEP 17/162**\n\nContinue Procedure 31 on Subject 207. Previous procedure centre in use. Relocate temporarily to Procedure Centre 78. Authorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to predator animals after surgery and recovery.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/162-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 06-06-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Grant\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Experimental Prey 01 (420kg grizzly bear), died from fractured skull after prolonged encounter with 207. Survival time: 24.31 minutes. Experimental Prey 02 (982kg saltwater crocodile) withdrawn from experiment after subject sustained substantial injuries. Further experimentation with Bengal tiger closed. Suggest allowing Subject 207 time to recover.\n\n**17. STEP 17/248**\n\nAuthorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to humans.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/248-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 26-07-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Grant\n> \n> **Summary Report:** 3/4 subjects died from shock. 1/4 attempted retaliation. Average survival time: 28.17 minutes. Subject 207 affected momentarily due to the vocalisations of a familiar species. Suggest inducing Subject 207 with more influencing amnestics. There's something still in there. Experimentation on a larger group required.\n\n**18. STEP 17/250**\n\nAuthorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to humans (group). Remove Dr. Grant from role as Procedure(s) 28-31 manager following psychological unrest.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/250-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 28-07-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Taylor\n> \n> **Summary Report:** 8/12 attempted retaliation. 1/12 died from shock upon viewing Subject 207. 3/12 attempted escape. Average survival time: 48.53 minutes. Suggest administering experimental prey with anterograde amnesia to test maximum potency of Subject 207. Results are extremely promising, however Subject 207 is becoming restless. Further suggest implementing a staff-rotation-cycle in prevention of further psychological unrest. Soon Experimentation Centre 05 will be unfit to hold Subject 207.\n\n**19. STEP 17/421**\n\nStaff suffering from psychological nervousness when experimenting with Subject 207 to be removed from program. Staff requesting amnestics to be granted permission. Commence Procedure 32 ASAP.\n\n**20. STEP 17/472**\n\nA significant number of staff have developed catatonic states while working with Subject 207. Hold progress on the program until further notice.\n\n**21. STEP 17/488** \n\nCommence Semi-Procedure 32-2. Admit only sensory-inept (blind/deaf) personnel to the program.\n\n**22. STEP 17/526**\n\nAuthorise further testing of Subject 207 on exposure to humans (group) each administered with anterograde amnesia. Provide basic supplies. Move research of Subject 207 to Experimentation Centre 05. Design facility to imitate hospital environment.\n\n> **DeCIRO Catalogue Number:** FR-17/488-001\n> \n> **Document Type:** Summary Report\n> \n> **Date Received:** 14-08-2017\n> \n> **Author:** Dr. Taylor\n> \n> **Summary Report:** Group lasted total of 18 days. 32/40 attempted retaliation. 1/40 died from suicide. 5/40 died from shock. 2/40 attempted escape. Longest survivor died during prolonged encounter with Subject 207. Further research concludes that Communication Device 04 has been recovered by the Foundation, and were using the device to communicate with one member of experimental prey.\n\n**[FURTHER DOCUMENTATION BURNT DURING FOUNDATION RAID ON FACILITY]**\n\n**23. STEP 17/921**\n\nDeploy 18 Alpha-Class personnel to recover Subject 207. Location unknown, escaped during Foundation raid on the facility. Foundation confirmed not to be in possession of Subject, but aware and also attempting recovery. Suspected to have entered a civilian population, heading Eastbound of facility. This is a maximum-class priority. Re-contain Subject 207 immediately.",
