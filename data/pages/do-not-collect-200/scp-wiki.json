How many tests did they do on this thing? And who on? Maybe some random D-Class? \n\n   After looking at the evidence you sent, I've got to agree with you whole-heartedly. This game isn't anomalous whatsoever. It's just a couple of people getting too involved in a goddamn board game. I've shown your work to junior researchers Syrek and Wright. They both agree. We've got a plan to make a report to the Director and we'll need your help. Reply ASAP if you are interested.\n\n   - Researcher Harmon\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; width: 95%;font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.3em;border:solid 3px #0050a0; background:#f9f4d6;\"]]\n**Walter Pietrovitch** <pietrovitchw@foundation.scp>\n //to:// Jack Harmon <harmonj@foundation.scp>\n //date:// Wednesday, Aug 9, 2001 at 11:08 AM\n //subject:// RE: RE: Non-anomalous item\n\n------\n\n   Jack,  \n   Regarding those initial questions, documents suggest they took \"friendly\" D-Classes to test this thing. Twice. Clearly not enough to prove any anomalous effects. I can help you with your report. \n\nWhen going through the logs, I found where it came from. Some kid was selling it because he blamed it for \"ruining mommy and daddy's marriage\". He'd gotten it for his birthday, but when his parents played it, they got in an argument over real money and divorced. Kid dead hated that game. I don't blame him, although it's not like that marriage would have lasted if you ask me. \n\nAnyways, what do you need? A co-witness? Report verification? It can't be on-shift though, I've got to lead research on my current skip. \n   - Piet\n\n##firebrick| » AO-2175.log##\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; width: 95%;font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.3em;border:solid 3px #0050a0; background:#f9f4d6;\"]]\n**Jack Harmon** <harmonj@foundation.scp>\n //to:// Walter Pietrovitch <pietrovitchw@foundation.scp>\n //date:// Wednesday, Aug 9, 2001 at 3:34 PM\n //subject:// Need your help\n\n------\n\n   Thanks for your interest. We aren't planning to send a //normal// report, per se. We're gonna play the thing ourselves and take a video of it. Saves us at least two weeks of paperwork just to clear this thing. We package that up with the report, send it off to the Director. He's a man of common sense. I've got Wright, Syrek, me, and hopefully you. Eckhart's gonna videotape it. Let me know if that's fine with you. If so, meet at the recreation room tomorrow in Sector 17.\n\n   - Researcher Harmon\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; width: 95%;font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.3em;border:solid 3px #0050a0; background:#f9f4d6;\"]]\n**Walter Pietrovitch** <pietrovitchw@foundation.scp>\n //to:// Jack Harmon <harmonj@foundation.scp>\n //date:// Thursday, Aug 10, 2001 at 1:53 PM\n //subject:// RE: Need your help\n\n------\n\n   Jack,  \n  I'll be there.\n   - Piet\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; width: 95%;font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.1em;border:solid 3px #097002; background:#0b3808; color: #77CC77;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ Hello!
