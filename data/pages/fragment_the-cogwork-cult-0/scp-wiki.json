Usually, this wouldn't be worth my time; anything I needed to know could have been sent to me in a letter. Unfortunately, an Inventor retrieved me from my quarters to inform me that the Patriarchy had requested my presence. If it had not been for the nature of this meeting, I would have cut the insolent bastard's fingers off. \n\nThey found it.\n\nI had my doubts- ever since the church allowed females to ascend to any rank higher than Inventors, we've become completely incompetent. It was within my range of reasoning that the stupid whores had merely found another dishwasher. Regardless, my curiosity piqued, and I'm always more than happy to take any opportunity I can to prove Bumaro's decision wrong. \n\nThe meeting was about as interesting as one would expect it to be. The endless, redundant dronings of Patriarchs far past their prime enabled constructs and ideas that would never come to pass before dragging themselves to the topic of discussion. A civilian had identified a construct in London back in January, and a Legate-Faithful has now confirmed it as a holy artifact. They wanted me to confirm the nature of the object and return it to Mexico. \n\nWhen I inquired about the pace at which the Legate returned, I was met with claims that a new \"normalcy\" agency had infiltrated the ranks of the British crown and that all members of the church were to exercise caution when traveling. It's highly likely this was merely a scare tactic Bumaro fabricated to keep church members close together, deceitful but clever. \n\nI have been instructed to depart from Tampico tomorrow morning. Originally, I was to be accompanied by a Hispanic, Columbian or something like that, a disgusting notion which I quickly dispelled. Instead, I am accompanied by Militant-Faithful Caesar Brogly and Inventor-Faithful Irwin Fordham alongside a group of forty general members of the faith. \n\nI will seek to exit London sooner than I enter it, the less time I have to spend in that FLESH pit, the better. \n\n]]\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"hfbookcontainerRight\"]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktopRight\"]]\n        The Collapse of Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookmobiletitleRight\"]]\n        Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktitleRight\"]]\n        Volume 2.07.25-38\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookcontentRight\"]]\n[[div style=\"float:right;width:45%;font-size:90%;padding:5px;\"]]\n##red|a.## The illegitimate son of Emperor Tamin, it was considered that Kadmiel did not inherit Bumaro's blood, and so it was determined that he, and all of his sons after him, were to never ascend to the Patriarchy. \n\n##red|b.## Producers and overseers over the actions of the Inventors-Faithful.\n\n##red|c.## Records indicate some form of construct was present within the emperor's temple, capable of relaying the history of the city into the mind of the current emperor. \n\n##red|d.## A construct destroyed during her fall from the heavens, for more, see 01.76.12-97.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Volume 02.07.25-29**\n**25.** Two sons of Kadmiel ##red|^^a^^## would be born, Orville and Jacob.\n**26.** They would become Fabricators-Faithful ##red|^^b^^## much like their father before them.\n**27.** Orville, younger and infinitely wise, would ascend to the ranks of a Schematist through his contributions to the church. \n**28.** Jacob, older and resolute in his faith, would resign himself to the rank of a Legate-Faithful, eternally unwavering in his loyalty to the emperor. \n**29.** Through the transcriptions of the emperor's memories##red|^^c^^##Orville would learn of MEKHANE's alimentary canal. ##red|^^d^^## With permission from the Patriarchy, Orville would set out to reconstruct the canal, enlisting the assistance of his brother. \n~~~~\n        [[div class=\"hfbookpagenumbers-mobileRight\"]]\n            784\n        [[/div]]\n    [[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n        [[div class=\"hfbookpagenumberRight\"]]\n            784\n        [[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| style=\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lugrasimo&display=swap');\n\n.page {\n  font-family: 'Lugrasimo&display=swap', cursive;\n  margin: 2rem;\n}\n\n\n| contents=\n\nMay 30th, 1899:\n\nLondon. A vile hellhole serving as the epicenter of an equally vile country. What was once a glimmering city has since been ruined and tainted by the sins of The FLESH and the abolishment of slavery. I had previously considered the possibility of the stomach entering the city, but due to how fast items travel through London's ports, I figured it would be gone sooner than I would be able to investigate. \n\nWe arrived in London through the St Katharine Docks, a dreadful place run by creatures that made me glad I didn't possess the senses of The FLESH. Unfortunately, our destination lay in the Southwark neighborhood, about two miles from the port. \n\nSame as four days ago, Brogly's presence has been a hindrance to our proceedings; he's a loggerhead and duller than a rock. His only redeeming quality is his 20/20 vision. The man's head has been clouded by a FLESH-bound lust for Saint Trunnion and her unholy teachings. He stated my mechanical form was bound to draw unsavory attention and wrestled me into a heinous disguise. If he fears a mechanical form so much, then I shall ensure he grows to love it...\n\nA crumbling warehouse in a sea of other crumbling warehouses. I had heard a lot about the status of the man who discovered the stomach, so needless to say, this was not what I was expecting. Although much to my delight, Fordham had discovered a coffeehouse in the area, rumors stated that the coffee was harvested the way I like. \n\nThe interior of the warehouse was disheveled and unsanitary, various catwalks lead to adjacent rooms, in the center of the warehouse floor sat a large object covered with a white sheet. \n\nFordham introduced me to James Moriarty, a tall, thin man with skin lighter than the parchment I write this on. It was clear to me that this was a man possessed by desires of The FLESH. After our dreadful exchange of pleasantries, the man limped to the center of the room and pulled the sheet off the object.\n\nIt was just as beautiful as I imagined. A divine combination of gears and steel coming together in a form so striking words fail to truly give it meaning. \n\n\"We acquired this warehouse following a recent operation.\" The man explained, \"Once I grew closer to the object, I instantly knew of its importance and managed to contact one of your representatives.\" \n\nI wheeled over to the stomach, laying my hand upon its hard exterior. \n\n\"You have done a great service to the church, but your services are no longer required,\" I said, focusing on our reflection in the cold steel. \n\nIn my mind, I counted down from fifteen. At three, I heard the expected clang on the back of my head, followed by the usual reactionary movements from Brogly and his goons. \n\n\"Tsk, off by three,\" I exclaimed as I turned to the pale man, his sunken eyes widened. I wheeled myself closer, feeling the vibrations of his FLESH and bone. \n\n\"Professor Moriarty, do you take me for an idiot?\" I inquired, met only with the sound of the frail man's heartbeat. \n\nWith a flick of his wrist, the man produced a scimitar knife engraved with spurious gold. He brought the knife down upon my head, lodging its blade in my skull. I retaliated by detaining Moriarty's hands; the eternally satisfying sound of bones cracking graced my ears as I peeled his fingers back.\n\nThrough his other sleeve, the man produced a syringe, a tactic just as effective as the knife. \n\n\"Well, isn't that just adorable?\" My hand enclosed itself around his long neck, I sensed the vibrations of his pulse, faster and faster and faster.\n\n\"It's a real shame; you would've been a valuable asset.\" My fingers dug themselves through his neck, spilling the sinful liquids on the floor. \n\nThe sack of FLESH dropped to the ground as I extended a lone finger to the catwalks above, demanding that Brogly bring me the gunman. Despite Brogly's asininity, he was well trained, and the gunman was brought to me within moments. \n\nHe was quite different from the nearby corpse. Large, hairy, primitive, he would do nicely. I directed Brogly and the gunman up the stairs and onto the catwalks above the stomach's opening. Brogly's vacant eyes stared at me, seeking the reassurance he was shortly met with. With a push, the man tumbled from the catwalks, crashing into the cavity below. \n\nI was met with the orgasmic sound of churning gears and screaming FLESH. The other end of the construct dispensed several gears, bullets, and a large container holding a specimen I was quite familiar with. A gracious gift from MEKHANE. \n\nI listened to the utterances muttered beneath the breaths of the church members. \n\n\"Caesar, your right hand.\"\n\nHe was apprehensive; I wheeled myself closer, neglecting to reiterate myself. \n\nA swift cut of my blade and three of the fingers on Brogly's right hand were lost to the stomach's opening. The momentary squealing of FLESH and another gift, three mechanical rodents glimmering and golden. \n\n\"Let something like that happen again, and your entire body will meet the same fate.\" \n\n\"Moriarty's corpse is to be hung from the rafters,\" I called to the group down below. \"His FLESH will be of great use to me.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<br>\n<br>\n\nJune 2nd, 1899:\n\nThe rats are gone. \n\nThey got out of the warehouse a couple of days ago, stuck around the alleyways for a while, but now they're completely gone. \n\nI worry not about this being a problem; they'll likely be deducted as mere children's toys. \n\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"hfbookcontainerRight\"]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktopRight\"]]\n        The Collapse of Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookmobiletitleRight\"]]\n        Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktitleRight\"]]\n        Volume 2.07.30-36\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookcontentRight\"]]\n[[div style=\"float:right;width:45%;font-size:90%;padding:5px;\"]]\n##red|a.## Records indicate Orville took part in this task for twelve years. \n\n##red|b.## See Volume 2.15.63-98.\n\n##red|c.## A sinful covenant of powerful mages that participated in the conquest against the city of Amoni. \n[[/div]]\n\n**Volume 02.07.30-36**\n**30.** To fabricate the gut was a daunting task. \n**31.** Orville would spend hundreds of moons studying MEKHANE's form.##red|^^a^^##\n**32.** Jacob would provide the metals necessary to construct the stomach while, much to Jacob's dismay, Orville would isolate himself from the rest of Amoni for several seasons at a time to complete his project.\n**33.** With the encroaching war and rising tensions throughout the patriarchy,##red|^^b^^##\n Jacob feared his brother would be unable to complete the stomach.

I've instructed my legwork to use livestock and the occasional drunkard, although I am not afraid to turn to more unconventional methods. \n\nMy experiment with the corpse has come along well.  It has been far too long since I have modified FLESH, and Fordham has proven himself particularly useful. He was the one who provided me with my tasting module, introducing me to the delectable and biting taste of blood coffee, and much to my luck, the aforementioned coffee shop provided just what I sought.  \n\nI have taken much joy in arming this new automaton. This has been an excellent medium by which I can test the capabilities of the stomach. Through several of the lamb sacrifices, we've obtained some incredibly valuable components, and through those components have come new constructs. \n\nMy best work thus far is the replacement for the corpse's left arm, an incredibly powerful tool operated as follows. \n\n* Users attach their fingers to a subject's teeth. \n* The fingers then inject a fast-acting calcium compound into the subject's bones.\n* Once the subject's bones are hardened, the hydraulics in the mechanical arm activate, allowing the user to separate the subject's bones from their FLESH. \n\n\n When we are brought new sacrifices, we shall use this to split the corpses we receive into specific parts, allowing us to better optimize the outcomes of our sacrifices.  \n\nThis new automaton will be perfect. A figure so divine and faultless that it will disgrace any other construct assembled by the hands of man. \n\nJune 8th, 1899: \n\nDamn it all to hell. If it weren't for these imbecilic meatheads, we would've been back in Mexico by now. \n\nWe're being followed. Our more covert intelligence have inserted themselves across businesses in the area.

Holmes was infected just as planned, but that has not deterred his accomplice. How that moronic bastard is a doctor is far beyond my understanding. \n\nHolmes was getting close, I'll admit that much, but how Watson works is far beyond me. He's getting closer. Saw right through the disguise of one of our agents; must've heard the ticking. We haven't seen the man since. Brogly wanted to pull our agents back to the warehouse, but I refused. He claims to have lost four agents, but it's clear he's spewing hot air. They've all been arrested and dragged to Scotland Yard. It doesn't matter; they'd have to dissect our agents to learn the truth, and the Brits just don't have the heart to do it. \n\nFordham brought upon me the Schema I wrote, reminding me that the further an individual is intertwined with their FLESH, the greater the sacrifice. I have demanded the general delegation bring me more humans, preferably ones who wouldn't be missed, but that appears to not be enough. The stomach keeps spitting out the same components, and if I wish to transform the corpse into something truly divine, this won't cut it. \n\nRegardless, Fordham's still been quite useful. He's taken in my footsteps, extracting the entrails from the corpses we receive and replacing the innards with clockwork mechanisms. It's clear my intellect is unmatched, an underground network to transport the stomach out of the city, a cogitation even Bumaro would fail to think up! \n\nThe construct is coming along well. We abducted several lawyers and, in return, received computational devices; when attached, we managed to simulate a brain in the construct. Moriarty's corpse is now eternally unyielding to me. He stands at six and a half feet tall, electing to equip the corpse with four legs for movement and eight arms to extract different parts from a human corpse. All that remains is to gift my beautiful creation with sight. \n\nJune 9th, 1899:\n\nBrogly is gone. \n\nHe approached me this morning claiming that Watson wasn't the only one hot on our tail, that the coffee runs and abductions were warranting unwanted attention. Of course, the idiot can only see what's directly in front of him, failing to realize why we needed to distribute our members across the city. \n\nHe stormed off, claiming that he was going to deal with Watson himself. For once, I thought he was finally going to be useful- naturally, I was mistaken. He came crawling back in the dead of night, whining that he was intercepted by members of British intelligence. It was made clear to me that he had failed in his mission and ended up leaking our operations to an extremely incompetent government run by a WOMAN!\n\nI gouged Brogly's eyes out with my own hands, forcing him to listen to his eyes be churned and processed in the stomach before throwing him in as well. Through the destruction of his FLESH, Caesar Brogly managed to contribute something noteworthy to our cause. Through the components MEKHANE has graced us with, I have managed to construct a new image processing system capable of allowing me to connect with the occipital implants Fordham inserts into our agents. Soon, I shall have eyes all across London, allowing me to handpick our next recipients of MEKHANES grace. I will construct perfection, no matter the cost. \n\nJune 10th, 1899:\n\nThey're everywhere, they're in our ranks, outside our warehouse, in the deepest corners of my mind. In my slumber, I was met with visions of Amoni and subsequent visions of my own demise. A traitor exists in our midst, waiting to strike me, and I will find them. \n\nJune 11th, 1899: \n\nTwelve sacrifices today, four of them our own. I'm not taking risks, not when I'm this close. I tested the new image processing device today, and I have now seen the repugnant face of Dr. John Watson. He approached one of my agents stationed in a nearby restaurant. \n\nHis pug-like lips flapped, spewing unnecessary nonsense. My agent showed Watson to his table, careful to keep an eye on the obese doctor. Another man approached, an officer, lanky, his facial hair akin to that of a filthy rodent. I managed to catch his name, one born of FLESH rite: Lestrade. \n\nDespite the situation that surrounded him, Watson was cheery, approaching Lestrade with a kind manner and presenting an understanding tone when the officer failed to provide any leads on Holmes' condition. Every sentence exchanged between the two disgusted me more- two incompetent and ignorant morons encouraging each other's oafishness. \n\nFollowing their meeting, Lestrade was brought to me and sacrificed, yielding nothing more than a few simple gears. \n\nJohn Watson is not a threat. He will spend the rest of eternity stumbling in the dark as his accomplice turns to steel. I thought no man could be that slow, no matter the false god they worship; I stand corrected. \n\nI will have the members of the general faith deal with Watson while I complete the construction of Moriarty's corpse & ostracize our traitor. \n\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"hfbookcontainerRight\"]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktopRight\"]]\n        The Collapse of Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookmobiletitleRight\"]]\n        Amoni.\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbooktitleRight\"]]\n        Volume 2.07.288-297\n    [[/div]]\n    [[div class=\"hfbookcontentRight\"]]\n[[div style=\"float:right;width:45%;font-size:90%;padding:5px;\"]]\n##red|a.## The Emperor requested the acquisition of the alimentary canal in the name of MEKHANE.\n\n##red|b.## Since this event, no other living human has been completely converted by the stomach, so whether or not humans emerge as different materials is currently unknown. \n[[/div]]\n\n**Volume 02.07.288-297**\n**288.** Orville would permit the release of the stomach into the hands of the Emperor, ##red|^^a^^## trusting in the Patriarchy's decision. \n**289.** Two nights before the Legates would come to obtain the stomach, Jacob would approach his brother, furious. \n**290.** \"Brother, why would you sacrifice your work to the Emperor?

All of them blasphemous in their own right. I will purge every last member to find this rat if it means the last of me. \n\nThe Moriarty construct is nearly complete, a perfect symbol of divine grace assembled to perform every service the church ever needs. I have granted it the ability to roam the warehouse with explicit permission to decommission anyone who comes in its path. Unfortunately, it has not proven itself yet. That vile rat is still amongst us; I know it to be true. \n\nWatson still encroaches closer every day, every step he takes is another towards me. I see it now, this man has set out to kill me and will not rest. He has sent me fake letters from the Patriarchy in Mexico requesting my return. He's trying to pull me out of my hiding place. A broken clock is right twice a day, and with the assistance of a filthy rat, that number can jump drastically. \n\nI watch him through a hundred different eyes, and I wish to kill him. He claims to be a man of science yet denies the foundational science that composes our church. \n\n<i> I want to tear every bone from his body, denying him any sense of structure. </i>\n\nHe follows a baseless reasoning of \"deduction,\" desperately seeking to tie together seemingly random details in a futile attempt to push his own agenda. \n\n<br>\n\n<i> I want to purge his eyes from their sockets and bathe in the blood that follows. </i>\n\nHe claims to be a friend of these people, yet he takes from them, offering nothing in return. \n\n<i> I want to shatter his brain into puny sizes of meat and feed them to the stomach. </i>\n\nHe follows his insufferable hero, Sherlock Holmes, like a starving puppy. His undying affection for a man who merely does nothing more than perform simple parlor tricks. John Watson has no personality outside of his false hero. \n\n<i> I want to shred his skin, relieve him of FLESH.</i>\n\nI want to save him. I must save him. I know it; he just needs a little push. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nJune 13th, 1899: \n\nI see it now. It's Fordham; it's always been Fordham. \n\n\"We can't use that component; the construct will become unstable.\"\n\n\"We should ignore this Watson fellow and focus on getting the stomach back to Mexico.\"\n\n\"I'm afraid I can't give you that component and still be sound of mind.\"\n\nAll lies, all of it. \n\nHe manipulated Brogly; he dissented from my followers, he lied to our superiors in Mexico. He wants the stomach for himself. He wants to achieve perfection, but perfection does not exist for those who bring hell upon their brethren. \n\nMy coffee runner did not return today. I personally went to investigate to find the store closed down and my runner nowhere in sight; it was a front to watch me. When I returned, I could see the glimmer in Fordham's eyes; it was him, it's always been him.\n\nHe is a master of FLESH, clever and cunning. His screams echoed through the warehouse as his body churned through the stomach, a ringing reminder of sacrilege that will always stain these walls. \n\nI care not for what becomes of the stomach; it is of no use to me anymore. My construct is complete. My time is limited; the walls are closing in. I only have one goal now.\n\n<i> I must save Doctor John Watson.

Dated June 14th, 1899.\n\nA report delivered to Her Majesty's Foundation on the actions of Dr. John H. Watson and Sherlock Holmes regarding AO-8712.\n-----\n\n**07:48 HOURS:**\nDr. Watson leaves his residence on Baker Street clutching the golden letter the church delivered yesterday. I feared I would have to step in like I did at the scrapyard, but thankfully he appeared armed. \n\n**09:22 HOURS:** \nI took a back route to the hotel and arrived shortly before the doctor. Rather than darting directly for the stairs as I expected, he spent a moment in the lobby to listen for Tickers, a pleasant surprise. I trailed him as he made his way to room 346, a journey made difficult by his insistence to inspect every door frame he passed. \n\nEventually, he arrived at the room, and to my dismay, he entered with little hesitation. I brought my eye to the peephole and watched as the warped shape of the doctor entered the room. Somehow, the church had managed to choose the one hotel with walls thicker than an inch. As such, it was difficult for me to make out anything they were saying.\n\nThe form of the Schematist was difficult to discern. He had positioned himself in such a way that the sunlight obscured his appearance. I held out hope that Watson would realize the room was a trap, that he would hear the ticking, or realize the Schematist had no flesh, or that he would trust his gut instinct, yet they just kept talking. \n\nWatson sluggishly shuffled before the Schematist, careful to keep his grip on his revolver. The Schematist's hands shifted about, a movement that alarmed Watson as he unloaded a bullet into the Schematist's temple. \n\nIn a blink, Watson found himself pinned to the wall, the Schematist's metal fingers quickly enclosing his throat. \n\nI pulled, twisted, and jerked the doorknob to no result before resorting to throwing my shoulder in the door in a futile attempt to get it to budge. My attempts were all for nothing as I found myself on the floor as Watson's body crashed through the doorway. He groaned, certainly having shattered a few bones. I scrambled to my feet, watching as the Schematist retrieved a canister I had become disgustingly familiar with. \n\nI pulled Watson to his feet. \"By Jove, you're the dame from the scrapyard!\" he bellowed. \n\nI nodded, explaining the urgency with which we needed to evacuate the hotel. Together, we limped down the stairs. Before arriving in the lobby, we were met with the sound of ticking clockwork. \n\n\"They're waiting for us...\" Watson gasped as I swore under my breath.\n\nWatson pulled his firearm from his jacket. \n\n\"I'm taking you hostage.\" Watson illustrated. \n\n\"Excuse me?\" \n\nHe knocked on his shoulder; the metal rang out. \"They'll think I'm one of them.\" \n\nI understood our mission. Watson held his revolver to my temple, and together we walked through the lobby, then stopped. \n\n\"Sorry sir, the hotel's under quarantine. I'm going to have to ask you to head back to your room.\" A man approached us, the sounds of clockwork beneath his skin louder than that of a grandfather clock. A peer into the gaping hole where his left eye once was revealed hundreds of tiny gears. \n\n\"I'm taking this woman back to the warehouse, Schematist's orders.\" Watson knocked on his shoulder again. The dumb prats bought his story, and we made our way out of the hotel. \n\n**10:33 HOURS:**\n\nWe attempted to travel back to Baker Street to regroup with Holmes. Much to our dismay every corner we turned held another occultist. We resorted to alleyways for our progression, yet even then we had to adjust our path several times. I was thankful that Watson was so familiar with the layout of the city as I surely would have led us to our demise. \n\n\"It's as though they've abducted half of the city.\" Watson gasped for air as we took a short break in an alleyway garden. \n\n\"They're being chalked up to disappearances, I'm sure you know that...\" I explained, \"But I'm not sure how long we can keep this charade up.\"\n\n\"Not to worry.\" He exclaimed, \"This will all be over soon and we shall be allowed to return to our normal lives.\"\n\nHe helped me to my feet and we continued to make passage for Baker Street. \n\n**11:25 HOURS:**\n\nEventually, we took refuge in Grosvenor Square, despite the time, it was just as empty as the rest of London. \n\n\"So you're the madam who's been stalking my home?\" Watson inquired. \n\nWhen I asked how he knew that, he explained the cigarettes that were found in the gutter outside his home each morning, a sizable oversight on my part. \n\nWe exchanged our notes, Watson had amassed a sizable documentation of the church's activity, hundreds of cold hard facts we had overseen in our speculation regarding the anomalous object. Together, our documentation provided more than enough information for me to present to my superiors to justify mobilization against the church. \n\nWatson asked me how soon we could raid the warehouse, claiming his fear for his life and his wife's. I saw right through him; he was seeking revenge for what happened to Holmes and for his injuries. \n\nI explained it would take a couple of days to reach approval for this sort of action, but I would let him know when it happens. Soon, we parted ways, and I made my return to Charles Street. \n\nWatson is clearly disturbed by the church's ideals of eternal life, and the condition of his friend has shaken him to his core. He is an incredibly brave man, but it's clear he is terrified, as expected from someone's first interaction with the unconventional. I believe with time, he could be a valuable asset to our organization. \n\nTake this as my request that, once the situation dies down, Dr. Watson sees counseling rather than amnestic treatment. \n[[>]]\n-  **Clara Greene**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:pages\n| medium=vintage-book\n| style=\n@import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Lugrasimo&display=swap');\n\n.page {\n  font-family: 'Lugrasimo&display=swap', cursive;\n  margin: 2rem;\n}\n\n\n| contents= \n\nJune 20th, 1899:\n\nThey're almost all gone.
