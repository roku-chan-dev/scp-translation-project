I write sci-fi and fantasy stories about strange horrors, eldrich gods, and the power of love. I often focus on LGBT themes, as well as religion, romance, and supernatural mystery.\n\nI've been a fan of the SCP Wiki since I discovered it more than ten years ago, but it wasn't until last year that my own writing skills grew strong enough that I felt like I could contribute to this wonderful universe. I hope all of you enjoy what I create here.\n\n+ Off-Site\nBesides being an SCP author, I also write novels. Links to all of my work, including my personal blog and an e-mailing list you can subscribe to, are available on [https://www.daviscollinsauthor.com/ my author website].\n\nMy first novel, entitled The Springstorm Alpha, is available as an eBook on [https://www.amazon.com/Springstorm-Alpha-Davis-Collins-ebook/dp/B0DRF2X96Z Amazon], as an eBook or Paperback on [https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-springstorm-alpha-davis-collins/1144918745?ean=9798893470239 Barnes & Noble], and in serialized form on [https://www.webnovel.com/book/the-springstorm-alpha_25519290205134005 Webnovel], [http://abs.ireaderm.net/zyhw/app/app.php?ca=Share.toPcdisp&bookId=12857304&p2=120161&lang=GLOBAL&countryCode= iReader], and [https://www.dreame.com/story/1784568064-the-springstorm-alpha Dreame]. It's a paranormal romance, but it's also a mystery story about a strange town full of monsters and the brutal murder connected with it. The first few chapters are free on each of those platforms, so you might as well check it out!\n\nI also have an [https://xhawk77x.blogspot.com/ old blog] I used to post some stories on. Among the works present there is a (basically) complete web serial called Angel of Death, which is also available on [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/2594/angel-of-death Royal Road].\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=XHAWK77X]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
