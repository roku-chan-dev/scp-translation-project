However, following botched reports and multiple additional incidents related to the PETRA project (such as 1974-003, 1974-019, and 1974-028), the project was shut down in mid-1974 with little to no controversy. Due to recent in-bureau FBI and UIU declassifications, these files have been uploaded per the Federal Records Act to the database. Please keep in mind that these files are still of a somewhat sensitive nature to those in the bureau, so proceed with caution.\n \n- //Eugene Kittridge//, PETRA Head\n    August 4th, 1993\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"padding: 5px 5px 5px 15px; margin-bottom:10px; font-family: courier; font-size: 1em; color: #11ff21; border:solid 2px #0bbc17; background:#002d03;\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span class=\"colorlink\"]][http://scp-wiki.net/uiu-file-1974-028/offset/1 < PROCEED TO FILE >][[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@",
