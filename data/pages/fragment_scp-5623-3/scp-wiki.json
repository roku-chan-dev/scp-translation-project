  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-5623\n\n**Object Class:** Ticonderoga[[footnote]]Cannot be contained, but does not need to be contained.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All deep-space observatories are to be monitored by remote sensing and imaging satellites in low Earth orbit.\n\nThe production and trade of new deep-space telescopes, satellites, and other spatial equipment has been limited to companies where a sufficient number of undercover Foundation personnel are present in order to successfully implant a Binary_Star.aic file in all related hardware.\n\nAll data on SCP-5623 collected by telescopes, satellites, probes, drones, rovers, and other spatial equipment is to be intercepted by the Foundation AI \"Binary Star\", saved in the Foundation database, and subsequently deleted from public records. Those who witness the anomaly are to be administered Class B amnestics.\n\nPersonnel with Level 4 Clearance studying extraterrestrial anomalies may access the stored data.\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue;\"]]Personnel with Level 5 Clearance are allowed to use the Diplomat Terminal to view the communication logs with SCP-5623-1.[[/span]]\n\n**Description:** [[span style=\"color: blue;\"]]SCP-5623 is a dark metallic spacecraft roaming through space with one passenger on board, designated SCP-5623-1. SCP-5623 serves as a transportation vessel and vault for SCP-5623-1.[[/span]] It is the first extraterrestrial spacecraft observed by the Foundation and was discovered 54 years before the first manmade spacecraft[[footnote]]The first satellite, Sputnik 1 was launched on 4 October 1957.[[/footnote]] and 57 years before the first manned spacecraft[[footnote]]The first manned spaceflight took place on 12 April 1961 when Yuri Gagarin was launched as part of the Vostok 1 mission.[[/footnote]] existed. Although it cannot be confirmed due to the difficulty of acquiring a sample, SCP-5623 is presumably made from an alloy of palladium and black rhodium. It has a frame in the form of an oblate spheroid with an outer chamber on the bottom side which presumably serves as a control room.\n\n[[span style=\"color: blue;\"]]SCP-5623-1 is a sapient entity of currently unknown age and origin. During communication with the entity, it appears that these details are not completely clear even to itself, as it most likely has lost its sense of time and claims to have been spontaneously formed from the universe itself.\n\nIts method to maneuver SCP-5623 is currently unknown. It has been observed by the Beholder-3 probe to travel several light-years worth of distance nigh instantaneously and is nearly impossible to track because of this. \n\nSCP-5623-1 utilizes SCP-5623 to travel through space in search of dying stars. Upon arrival, it will collect the star and store it inside SCP-5623. The entity has not explained how it interacts with stars just as with its traveling method. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.[[/span]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=ZeppelinBW|caption= An LZ 127 Zeppelin|width=200px|align=right]]\n**Discovery:** On 4 December 1872, Ferdinand von Zeppelin claimed that he saw SCP-5623 with his telescope. He was administered amnestics; however, due to the lower quality amnestics available at the time, fragments of the memory of SCP-5623 remained in von Zeppelin's subconscious.\n\nPresumably due to these fragments, von Zeppelin showed a rapidly increasing interest in air-travel. After internal discussion, Foundation administrative staff decided to allow von Zeppelin to invent new aircraft with undercover personnel beside him as manual laborers in his employ. It was anticipated that von Zeppelin would eventually develop an aircraft based on the design of SCP-5623. Currently, the LZ 127 Zeppelin is the most accurate representation, albeit significantly smaller in size.\n\nOn 28 August 1903, several Foundation Astronomers observed an object matching von Zeppelin's description near the Orion Nebula in the Milky Way Galaxy through a telescope. It was then designated SCP-5623.\n\nOn 25 February 1955, the Foundation successfully launched the probes from the //Beholder// series in space to detect and study extraterrestrial anomalies. [[span style=\"color: blue;\"]]On 29 July 1958, SCP-5623 was observed by Beholder-3 nearly 55 years after its last observation.\n\nOn 2 July 1962, the //Diplomat//, a new probe was launched in the direction of Beholder-3 to establish a direct way of communication, as well as delivering the following to the passenger(s) of SCP-5623:\n\n* Several syllabi of different levels, dictionaries, and audio files of 57 Earth languages.\n* Photographs of life on Earth\n* A variety of music and natural sounds from over the entire globe approved by several site-directors.\n* Deep-space radio communication equipment with a reserve transmitter and receiver\n\nEvery day at 08:00 am UTC[[footnote]]Coordinated Universal Time, no difference with GMT (Greenwich Mean Time)[[/footnote]] different signals were automatically transmitted. On 14 August 1986, a response from SCP-5623-1 was recorded.[[/span]]\n\n+ Addendum-1: Diplomat Terminal Logs\n[[div class=\"danke agent\"]]\n| CLEARANCE CONFIRMED\n| CONNECTION TO DIPLOMAT STABLE\n| INCOMING MESSAGE\n\n14/08/1986 SCP-5623-1: \nARE YOU THERE?

How many times the scenario has been executed is unknown. \n\nDue to the inability to contain SCP-5623, all containment procedures will focus on preventing the public from observing and gaining information about the anomaly. Its whereabouts are currently unknown.\n\n[[=]]\n[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5623|Back To First File]]]|[[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5623/offset/1|Back To Level 4 File]]]\n[[/=]]",
