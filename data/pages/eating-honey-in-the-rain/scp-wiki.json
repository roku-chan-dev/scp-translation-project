The end of lies. Haggard women walked through the deserted carriages shouting, Hath! Hath the emperor laughs! How could he have laughed!\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nThe haggard carriagewomen saw in the half-light, the shadowed corpse of the grey woman; holding her palm up toward the black landscape. Her waist is strongly canted. Her forehead is wrinkled. It looks sullen. Its half-human, half-possessed, poisoned face – mouth half-ocean – has all of the features of the emperor's gun-man, shooting black-fire\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nOn the day, as the nursewoman flee the carriage, laughing in the ashen soot, gunpowder and foggy day-light that came down from the country. Emperors don't admire themselves alone with mirror glass. They admire their troops! The bullets! The more war they enjoy, more that is fought- the more victories they win! The more astride their monstrous formed chariots, the more glorious their trumpets, hawking a victory! Oh, for the end of sorrow- wake the emperor up, and kiss the haggard carriagewomen. The haggard carriage wrench, gave to all Mary, and lord, reaped from a womb spilt with honey.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nSt. Mary clutches her breast, looking down at the blue azure sky, cerulean waves crashing upon her hazel eyes, golden cross, green fringes. Blue fishes, singing the soul of the Lord and god. Mary, her soul a' blaze with eggs of white\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nAnother girl- Mildred, laying her dear, true and jest-like babes, across lost lost hair-worm's nest, singing to her\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nKing, his soul a' lustre-reared to the altar\nFloating in his swan's breast\nCried with bewailing and rambling fervour\nJesus, in his expression and name\nHe stands, for every eye, in every beholder,\nFor every face in all the world. He stands\nAnd speaks, in eloquent eloquence\nThat most heavenly doctrine of peace,\nThat men's hearts should be moved\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nSays Mary, sweet of the soul\nUpon the breast of Mildred rose\nBring new world\nInto flesh above\nFree from your jaw.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nOh, on the dreary days of blue leaves suckled by the tiger's great breasts, dropped with the soul of honeydew-laden coyote,\n[[/=]]\n\nOnly recalled to me the moving figure — the snow-blue wings, blue eyes. Here was the blades of the grass days\n\nLet me look at the days of grassen-blue and so I can\n\nTalk to you\n\nFeel you\n\nHug you\n\nKiss the tiger's maw\n\nUnderstand you\n\nCock-a crow, three times in the darkest hour\n\nSinging our song-\n\nAs we sung, and danced and sing joy\nClouds of chlorine dioxide flood our lungs\nSuffocatingly bright\nBut that pales in the moments we shared\nTogether\nRight?\nAs I\n\nTalks to you\n\nFelt you\n\nHugged you\n\nKissed the tiger's maw\n\nUnderstood you\n\nAlthough I ask, that we could still be together, in health fair, breathing in days of grassen-blue dropped with the soul of honeydew-laden tiger's eye. Mary wept.\n\nThe war outside is raging and it is already lost. On to victory!\n\n[[=]]\nYet you with steel guns and roses\nContinue the losing fight\nAs if a thorn-covered beast\nStung with honey and lead\nWill not come to the surface,\nBut still dies at night,\nLike summer fires on ancient deserts\nAnd in death, one will find the bullets\nDug out of the rosary-woman's temple\nCrushed by the jaws of a great tiger in the heavens\nAnd you will ask to fight again.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\nA traveler stops,\nYou've reached out to me\nHaven't you\nWith the carcass of the moonlight\nFalling snow into my soul\nAs the war rages\nAcross the papers, 'ruined streets of\nSarajevo',\nThe bomb in Myanmar\nThe clouds of aqauamarine haze under the disheveled roads of London\nThe triumphs over the war-men\nTo create after war\nTo forget and let old wounds heal\nLet there be joy.\nSo\nJoin us.\nWon't you\nOr at least\nRemember us.\n[[/=]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
