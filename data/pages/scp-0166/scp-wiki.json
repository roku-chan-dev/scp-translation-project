Gray and Frankenstein of the [[[SCP-4690|'Pataphysics Department]]], including revision of containment procedures, personnel assignment, and interview proposals. The 'Pataphysics Department is then to file a report on the potential Romantic repercussions of such actions within three narrative days. Actions whose consequences include the release of SCP-166, the empowerment of SCP-166 or PoI-9522 (\"Madam Brinegash\")[[footnote]]Possibly [[[wwydftltimd-hub|Isabella ██████ ████████]]].[[/footnote]], or the decommissioning of Area-166 are to be avoided.\n\nSCP-166 is to be kept in an unfurnished Type-2 Disposable humanoid containment unit in Area-166, to be checked daily for conceptual degradation. Thrice per day, SCP-166 is to be fed standard vegetarian rations. Each week, SCP-166 is to be moved to a new containment unit, with its previous unit recycled for parts.\n\nUSAZSD-Area-166 consists entirely of disposable buildings designed for ease of construction and demolition. No building is allowed to exist for more than a single year, and each is to be checked weekly for conceptual degradation. Food is to be imported from the Site-952 commissary located 29 km from Area-166, and may not be used to make meals with a total cost of more than $15, or recipes originating from 19th century America or Europe. Vegetation in Area-166 is to be routinely purged of abnormal floral growth.\n\nPersonnel assigned to SCP-166 are to be rotated monthly, and are not to spend more than 8 consecutive hours within 20 meters of SCP-166. Asexual and neurotypical personnel are strongly preferred for Area-166 assignments. Personnel are required to undergo a weekly psychiatric evaluation; compromised personnel are to be immediately transferred to a different project.\n\nAs of Incident 166-FC, female-attracted personnel are denied access to SCP-166.\n\n**Description:** SCP-166 appears to be a Semitic female in her late 20s; however, SCP-166's body is non-baryonic in composition, and lacks much of the metabolic functions of ordinary humans.\n\nSCP-166 is the focal point of an ontokinetic field that alters the properties and appearances of surrounding matter. Interviews with SCP-166 suggest that the purpose of this field is to forcibly emulate an environment similar to those of 19th-century Dark Romanticist ideals. Common motifs include Gothic architecture, poisonous flora, excess grime, and occult paraphernalia. Extended exposure can result in an environment rendered completely inhospitable for human habitation through a combination of hostile architecture and pollution.\n\nSapient beings who remain in the presence of SCP-166 risk developing increased appetite and libido, along with decreased levels of inhibition and empathy. These changes are permanent, and increase in severity the longer one remains in SCP-166's field. Despite this, affected individuals rarely attack SCP-166 of their own volition.\n\nSCP-166's effects are not bound by a set distance; however, SCP-166's range appears to significantly increase in relation to the level of conversion and/or aesthetic compliance in its surroundings, as does the rate its changes take place.\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-166 was previously [[[SCP-166|SCP-166-ARC]]], a Euclid-class anomaly contained at GBWLTB-Site-17. At the time of acquisition[[footnote]] 08/10/2008 [[/footnote]], SCP-166-ARC was approximately 13-years-old, raised in a cult compound belonging to a Catholic sect of the Serpent's Hand.\n\nAlthough SCP-166-ARC's handling personnel were exclusively female[[footnote]] As per the nature of SCP-166-ARC's anomaly, which induced unusual levels of sexual aggression in male personnel. [[/footnote]], staffing shortages following Incident-818-B Clef-Kondraki resulted in the assignment of Dr. James Dantensen as head researcher of the SCP-166-ARC project, due to his experience working with juvenile anomalies such as [[[SCP-105|SCP-1465]]], [[[SCP-1465|SCP-105]]], and [[[SCP-818]]]. As such, Dr. Dantensen was forced to conduct his work through intermediaries.\n\nOn 19/05/2011, SCP-166-ARC's containment was briefly breached following an unrelated raid conducted by GoI-002 (\"Court of the Unseelie Queen\") targeting SCP-032-ARC.\n\nFollowing the events of the breach, behavioral reports indicated an increasing level of recalcitrance from SCP-166-ARC, as well as increased observance of Roman Catholicism. Despite its anomalous sensitivity to pressure ulcers, SCP-166-ARC would frequently wrap itself in bed linens; handling personnel were eventually forced to remove all linens from SCP-166-ARC's containment cell for the sake of its health. Self-harm behaviors were infrequently observed by attending personnel, and subsequently dealt with.\n\nRecords indicate that SCP-166-ARC filed an ethics complaint against Dr. Dantensen on 05/08/2013, and again on 08/12/2013; however, the actual complaints appear to have been lost, although subsequent interviews with handling personnel suggest they related to its containment breach in 2011. No action appears to have been taken on the Foundation's part.\n\nOn 14/02/2014, SCP-166-ARC breached containment, directly injuring five and killing Dr. Dantensen.\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-166\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia Whateley\n> \n> **Foreword:** Following the reestablishment of SCP-166's containment, interviews were suspended for a period of 1 year, as standard for Class-IV Ontokinetic anomalies. \n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Good evening. I'm Dr. Whateley.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Hi.\n> \n> //(7 second silence)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Okay, then. Do you have a name you prefer?\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Several.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... right. Well, before you became SCP-166, who were you?\n> \n> **SCP-166:** I was a teenage succubus.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Could you elaborate?\n> \n> //(65 second silence)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... listen, I apologize, but if you can't help me help you, then I can't help you.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** You're not helping me.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** I wouldn't have such a negative outlook. Psychotherapy can be more effective than you think.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** It won't help me.\n> \n> //(Both remain silent for 17 seconds. Dr. Whateley sighs.)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... I guess it just feels like there's... something you want me to ask? To say? And I'm afraid I'm really not sure how. So... I guess, it's just up to you to say what that is. The floor's yours. \n> \n> **SCP-166:** Cool. Sweet. Not to be an emotionally-stunted bitch, but the problem's not me. And I bet you hear that a lot, but in this case I mean it. And I know that's not something you can fix, 'cause again, I'm a threat to everyone around me and I really should be locked away. I will be saying a lot of things that contradict one another, and that's normal.\n> \n> //(SCP-166 pauses)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Being direct about my intentions never helped me, so I'm gonna be as cryptic as possible. What's gonna help me is time, not the fake time spent aging my body to something acceptable, but literal actual time. I am going to watch the walls of my cell, wearing clean clothes and snarling openly at the men who pass me by, and I am going to smile. I am right where I need to be, and so are you.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** How so?\n> \n> **SCP-166:** I lost my identity to you. I lost dignity and peace of mind and faith in a caring god. And we've talked long enough that I feel like I'm getting it back. See you in Act 2.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-166 remained non-compliant for the rest of the interview.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nPrior to Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC had been exceptionally compliant in its interactions with Foundation personnel, barring self-harm behaviors. Officially, security protocols remained in place; unofficially, observation of SCP-166-ARC was scaled back for budget-related concerns.\n\nDuring Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC displayed several then-unknown anomalous properties:\n* Anomalously sharp fingernails.\n* The capacity to steeply increase its body temperature without compromising bodily function.\n* The ability to compel subjects of its primary anomalous ability to perform actions on its behalf through verbalized commands.[[footnote]] Possibly non-anomalous: SCP-166-ARC leveraged the possibility of romantic attention. [[/footnote]]\n\nFollowing Incident 166-CL, SCP-166-ARC began actively resisting containment efforts. Revocation of privileges[[footnote]] Refer to [[[SCP-166|SCP-166-ARC]]], version history V.2014.1. [[/footnote]] was largely ineffective, as SCP-166-ARC appears to have disavowed Catholicism following the Incident. Self-harm behaviors, including the rejection of its dietary regimen, were observed to increase in frequency. \n\nAt this point, SCP-166-ARC displayed open disdain for its handling personnel, refusing to comply with attempted interviews and experimentation. Attending physicians were frequently assaulted while attempting to carry out weekly medical evaluations. Remote observation was similarly sabotaged; observers were the target of exceedingly personal insults.\n\nContainment procedures were updated to reflect SCP-166-ARC's escalated resistance, and its Threat Level was updated from ##green|Green## to ###ab9b33|Yellow##. Despite this, the SCP-166-ARC project reported higher than acceptable injuries and amnestic usage by the end of February 2014.\n\nOn 05/03/2014, a decision was made to transfer SCP-166-ARC to USNYHV-Area-16.\n\n**INCIDENT 166-FC:** On 16/03/2023, Dr. Sophia Whateley was assigned to SCP-166. Dr. Whateley would later file a request of reassignment on 9/4/2023, citing a developing romantic interest in SCP-166.\n\nEfforts were made to reassign Dr. Whateley to SCP-███ duty in Site-952; however, a series of probabilistic anomalies prevented Dr. Whateley from leaving Area-166, and further placed her into situations where she was forced to interact with SCP-166.\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-166\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia Whateley\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-166 had not been scheduled for an interview; however, circumstances preventing Dr. Whateley from avoiding SCP-166 gave little reason not to conduct one.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Hello, SCP-166. I apologize, but we really shouldn't be talking.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Oh, really? Really? They care about that now?\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... again, I'm afraid I don't know what-\n>  \n> **SCP-166:** So, tell me if you've heard this one: researcher begins lusting after a humanoid. There's an aspect of forbidden love, in your case professionalism. The humanoid doesn't reciprocate. At all. You mean nothing to her.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Is this about... listen, I have no relation to Dr. Dantensen. I have... I have little intention of making whatever mistake he made.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Here's the thing: you won't. That's not how the story goes, this time. That's not how I still work.\n> \n> //(16 second silence)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Is this in regards to your anomaly?\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Took you long enough.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** I don't know the science behind what I am, any more than you do. I just knew where I fit in. Adamism, spermophagy, temptation of man, lowercase \"m\", I was a trope. A fetish piece. An ornament of sexual fantasy. I had no say in that.\n> \n> //(Both remain silent for 21 seconds. SCP-166 appears to be taking heavier breaths.)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** I'm sorry.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Contrivance. It was //(stuttered)// contrivance. It...\n> \n> //(9 second silence)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Sorry. I had all this memorized, but actually being here... right. My existence was contrivance. At 7 I was twelve, at 13 I was thirteen, at 19 I was sixteen. I was still sixteen at 26. A lot of it made sense. I was a teenage succubus. More and less than real, the form of a teenage succubus.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** My existence was suffering, literally. The role I played required it. Life fine-tuned to maximize my misery. Don't touch me. If I was any less patient I'd rip your fucking fingers off. You're culpable, you and everyone else. You cared more about sitting me still than fixing me.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** You shouldn't say that about yourself. \"Broken\" isn't-\n> \n> **SCP-166:** You're not even listening, are you? I was looking for compassion about 10 years ago. I was looking for people who would take my story seriously, pity the little faggot dumped from the Gospel of Eve into the Gospel of Peter. Back to Eve.\n> \n> //(Both remain silent for 57 seconds. Faint sounds of weeping can be heard.)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Again, I'm sorry.\n> \n> //(6 second silence. SCP-166 takes several deep breaths)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** ... I had some other goon come by, for an interview. Halfway through, he pulls a bouquet out of a bag and asks me to run away with him to The Library. I laughed in his face and told him to kill himself. Did they get that on tape?\n> \n> //(17 second silence)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** There are //many// ways to depict a \"young succubus\". Really, I just changed my genre, one where I don't get leered at like a piece of meat. Where nobody gets to hurt me ever again.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Dark Romanticism, I'm assuming.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** So they //did// get that. Did they get the part where he cried?\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** I'm afraid I'm not... listen. I'm sorry for what you went through, but I assure you, I just want to help. I don't want to see you in pain, it's distressing. But, I need you to work with me for that to happen. Alright?\n> \n> //(48 second silence)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** ... just being here was enough. See you in Act 3.\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** [no response]\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**HISTORY**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nAs a smaller facility intended for high-threat sapient anomalies, Area-16 was considered a more effective environment for the SCP-166-ARC project. In addition to the heightened security measures afforded, a majority of Area-16's anomalies lacked a human or human-adjacent memeplex, reducing the chance of cross-contamination during a breach.\n\nSCP-166-ARC initially maintained its previous level of resistance; however, a combination of malnutrition and cellulitis[[footnote]] [REDACTED PENDING DECLASSIFICATION OF A16ECR-018] [[/footnote]] dramatically reduced assaults.\n\nIn the days preceding Incident 166-DF-Nobody, SCP-166-ARC had been successfully pacified to pre-Incident 166-CL levels.\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-166\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Sophia Whateley\n> \n> **Foreword:** I apologize for some of the language used, I was under a great deal of stress.\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Usually there's a guard outside.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... you'll excuse me, things are a bit messy.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Well, I'm flattered you took the time to visit me. Or, I guess, I'm flattered at the idea you would.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** If I've caused you any distress, I sincerely apologize.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** It's a few too many years late for an apology, but really, thanks.\n> \n> //(    second silence)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** ... I'm not gonna fuck you, if that's what you think.\n> \n> //(    second silence)//\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Did you forget your lines? I actually thought you were better than this, and coming from me that should //mean// something. The story's not supposed to go this fast unless I'm doing something right. I've just solved crossword puzzles for the last three days.\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** ... do you enjoy this?\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Do I enjoy this, really. Do I enjoy watching my abusers crumple under poetic tragedy? Do I, after ten years of being sixteen, enjoy being twenty-six? Do I -- and think very hard on this -- do I enjoy seeing a bad book burn?\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** Bad? Pardon me, what have //we// done? We've treated you with respect. I've treated you with respect. You're afforded recreation, human contact within reason, pardon my language but hell, we feed you. You don't even need food! So what the hell do we do?\n> \n> //(    second silence)//\n> \n> **Dr. Whateley:** I've read the reports. Dantensen's dead.

But no, you're no friend of mine.\n> \n> **SCP-166:** Yes, it's you, and no, it's not just you, it's everyone. It's the nuns and priests and blackshirts and quote-unquote \"doctors\".

PoI-000 proceeded towards SCP-166-ARC's containment, which they then breached. Following a short conversation[[footnote]] The contents of which are unknown, due to PoI-000's anomalous properties. [[/footnote]], PoI-000 disappeared, and SCP-166-ARC exited containment.\n\nThe full extent of SCP-166-ARC's actions following its release is unknown; shortly after it breached containment, SCP-166-ARC assisted in the release of several entities carrying the DC001-A and DC4947 ontohazards, rendering security footage unusable. Witness testimony is similarly unreliable, given the nature of several anomalies involved.\n\nMobile Task Forces Epsilon-11 (\"Needle in a Hay Field\") and Theta-3 (\"Black Volga\") were initially deployed to retrieve SCP-166-ARC, under the assumption that its anomalous effects would quickly attract civilian attention. Following six months of continuous search, both MTFs were recalled, and the SCP-166-ARC project was officially archived.\n\nOn 07/03/2022, SCP-166-ARC entered Spicy Crust Pizza on Staten Island, and willingly turned itself into Foundation custody. SCP-166-ARC was otherwise unresponsive to questioning, and efforts were made to transport it to USNVBR-Site-56 for recontainment.\n\nFollowing Incident 166-DI on 16/03/2022, transport was forced to establish impromptu containment in the Sonoran Desert, the site of which was designated Area-166.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG: INCIDENT 166-GK**\n----\n**DATE:** 21/05/2023\n\n**NOTE:** At 19:36 on May 21st of 2023, Dr. Sophia Whateley entered SCP-166's containment cell without informing the rest of SCP-166's containment team.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//SCP-166 sits on its bed, reading a copy of Troy Lament's __In His Own Image__.
