At the base of its roof, SCP-4276-B descends into a void extending well beyond its outside parameters.\n\nWhen matter comes into contact with a threshold of 1.07m inside the pit of SCP-4276-B, it will begin to rapidly deteriorate at varying speeds with no discerned pattern. Should the material be returned from this threshold prior to total annihilation, the process will cease and the subject will suffer all expected effects.\n\nCurrently, the deepest recorded depth of the interior of SCP-4276 is 800 meters before the applied recording hardware was rendered defunct.\n\nSCP-4276-A can be observed within SCP-4276-B and in between engagements of protocol NULLARCH. As such, protocol NULLARCH has been devised to diminish SCP-4276-A's spread. There is no known method to extinguish SCP-4276-A.\n\n----\n= **Testing:**[[footnote]]Truncated.[[/footnote]]\n----\n[[div style=\"background: url(\"https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png\") center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 2px #000; padding: 1px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n||~ Subject Details: ||~ Depth: ||~ Retrieval:||~ Subject Post Test Details ||\n|| Steel rod, 3kg, 125cm. || Contact made; base of the subject level with the entrance. || Yes; 10 seconds. || Subject lost 9.5cm of length; subject carved with an upward spiraling pattern up to 107cm.  2.74kg.||\n|| Steel rod, 3kg, 125cm. || Fully engulfed; subject descended below the threshold. || No. || Following 40 seconds, the subject was pulled out, revealing nothing had remained of it.  ||\n|| Steel rod, 3kg, 125 cm. || Fully engulfed below the threshold. || Yes; 20 seconds. || Consistent spiraling patterns across the subject.

The population, prior to SCP-4276, was recorded at two-hundred and thirty-seven, all of which have been expunged from non-Foundation databases.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Triple-Triple-Spiral-triskelion|caption=Recreation of singular spiraling SCP-4276-A pattern.]]\n\nSCP-4276-B was located in what was formerly the center of the town, found overflowing with SCP-4276-A. No witnesses, files, or evidence of either the town of Oblation or SCP-4276 was found on the premises. Additionally, a difference in elevation had formed between the inside and outside of the premises of Oblation, forming a 46-meter deep crater around its edges and a 172-meter deep crater at its center. Spiraling patterns were carved into the crater ground, creating a network of the image on the right.\n\nDuring initial containment efforts, the effects of SCP-4276-A caused extreme difficulty for Foundation personnel in reaching SCP-4276-B, resulting in the annihilation of fourteen agents and two researchers; the three survivors were later terminated.\n\nAfter several days, a reliable method for reaching SCP-4276-B was discovered, and, once Foundation personnel could reach it, a draft for Protocol NULLARCH was devised by the former lead researcher at the time, Jameson Macrada. Revisions have since been made.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[span]]O-Class[[footnote]]Named after Oblation, North Carolina.

Mr. Macrada, if you could identify yourself for the audio recording.\n\n**O-Class:** Jameson Macrada, level-4 credentials, lead researcher for 4276.\n\n**König:** And, for how long have you served as the lead researcher for SCP-4276?\n\n**O-Class:** Since its discovery, the fourteenth of April, 1992.\n\n**König:** And what is the current date?\n\n**O-Class:** The ... sixth of May, I think?\n\n**König:** Very well. Mr. Macrada, over the past few weeks, there have been multiple complaints regarding various minor things, but, before that, might we discuss Protocol \"NULLARCH\"?\n\n**O-Class:** What would you like to know?\n\n**König:** How, precisely, were you able to come up with this Protocol? It seems, to me, antithetical, yet it works all the same.\n\n**O-Class:** Well, it was-  it struck me, I suppose, how devilish it seemed to me at the time. This great, big geyser, spewing hateful black everywhere. You know how devoted I am.\n\n**König:** No, I don't, actually. How faithful would you say you are, Mr. Macrada?\n\n**O-Class:** Very, König my boy! Very much so! In the mornings I wake up and pray to little baby Jesus, and in the night I thank God for everything he's done for me.\n\n**König:** Interesting, Mr. Macrada. But, and you just said it now, you said it seemed \"devilish\"? And, that didn't answer my question either, so I'll cut to the chase: Why did you decide to dump bodies into SCP-4276?\n\n//[O-Class begins slowly fidgeting its hand it a circular motion]//\n\n**O-Class:** Well, you see ...\n\n**König:** No, Mr. Macrada, I don't see.

The right way to dispose of the bodies, and maybe even the anomaly itself. Quell down whatever was going on inside that thing so it doesn't affect us here on the outside.\n\n**König:** With human bodies? Sir, I would think that those would only serve as kindling.\n\n**O-Class:** I figured that if we packed them tight enough, it would suffocate anything beneath.\n\n**König:** Fascinating. And this has undoubtedly worked in our favor.\n\n**O-Class:** Yes sir.\n\n**König:** Well then, if you would be comfortable with changing back to the topic of the recent complaints?\n\n**O-Class:** I would.\n\n**König:** Very well. These reports claim that you have been acting rather strange as of late. They describe you as being too quick, volatile, jumpy. Some times when you nearly fell asleep during work.\n\n**O-Class:** I've had a lot on my m-\n\n**König:** -And logs with the site psychiatrist state that you haven't been sleeping well, either.

That same thing, over and over in my mind. I can read it clearly when I close my eyes because it's burned into the darkness: \"Chiral Hypocrisy\". It tells me to give to it, to prepare things for it.\n\nIt won't stop either, it doesn't stop. I can feel it, now, shouting in sigils and grand, deep stretches of nothing that burn my heart and sear my flesh. It wants, it hates, it needs, it says. It's yelling at me, it's furious, demanding.\n\nYou must understand, everything I've done, everything that NULLARCH is, was me defying it, denying everything that it, that it silently screams in my nightmares.\n\n//[O-Class pauses, breathing in and out, letting its head rest on the table]//\n\n**König:** Mr. Macrada, our time is up. Thank you for participating in this interview.\n\n//[König gets up, adjusting his outfit, before walking to the doorway]//\n\n**O-Class:** Friedenfänger.\n\n**König:** Yes, sir?\n\n**O-Class:** I'm sorry.\n\n**König:** Very.\n\n//[König leaves, and two guards walk in]//\n\n**Security Personnel:** Place both your hands behind your head and stand up.\n\n//[Selected footage abruptly ends as security personnel approaches the O-Class.

Additionally, it seems that SCP-4276-A is similarly incapable of being manipulated through non or thaumaturgic methods. The only stimuli found to cause a change in its activity are O-Class personnel and their relative distance to SCP-4276-A.\n\nAdditional information on O-Class entities has also been found amidst a new series of tests, which has provided new insight for the continued secure containment of SCP-4276. O-Class entities will begin to develop symptoms after a period of one-two weeks of being located in the same facility that SCP-4276 is housed in. This occurs regardless of whether the O-Class has come into contact with SCP-4276.\n\nThe O-Class will then begin to develop inherently non-human characteristics, most pressingly, the capacity to internally interact with an unknown entity.

König and Senior Researcher Confer are present]//\n\n**Confer:** Why, König?!\n\n**König:** The signs were all there. It clearly was no longer human and I could not have it bringing this to ruin.\n\n**Confer:** He was right. He was right - did you even //think// about an alternative?!\n\n**König:** Indeed, I have. But what do you have in mind, //fraulein//?\n\n**Confer:** Amnestics, surgery, resorting to anomalous methods, anything to help these people instead of ...\n\n**König:** Yes, Ms. Confer?\n\n**Confer:** Instead of killing them!\n\n**König:** I have not killed anyone. I did not make that artefact, nor did I give it its potent capability. Instead, I have been given an enigma, one which we know painfully little about, and one that could, if used properly, save thousands of lives.\n\n**Confer:** ... How do you figure that?\n\n//[König stands]//\n\n**König:** Because. You've seen it, have you not? You arrived here once we had concluded the thaumaturgy trials and found that nothing, nothing, Ms. Confer, would be spared. And you are here now, as we begin \"cross-testing\" the anomalies that have proven to be not worth the effort. And we //destroyed// them, Ms. Confer.\n\nAs of yesterday, we have tried ten different objects that were seemingly indestructible, and we were returned with only an empty harness. Nothing has yet survived.\n\nWhat we have is the chance, a great opportunity afforded to us by, frustratingly similarly, an unknown force. If we are to continue and if we are to achieve the best, then we must first establish the boundaries of this gift. We must be aware of any failures in this system beforehand.\n\n**Confer:** A gift?\n\n**König:** Yes, Ms. Confer, a gift. We have discovered the vengeful wrath of the cosmos, a power beyond any nuclear bomb or crossbow. And a power such as that, a power to rival Mjöllnir, the Thunderbolt, or the Lance of Longinus, must be well managed in our hands.\n\nThink of the things in the dark, how many beasts without end do you think the Foundation has contained? Many, Ms. Confer. Many. And how many people have died because of them? Dozens, do you think? Hundreds? Or, God forbid, thousands? There are things in this world that need to be expunged, and there are things in this world that, until now, could not be undone.\n\nAnd so, if twenty people are to die for us to put these things down; if a hundred are to be sent down there so that humanity may reach a brighter day, then the choice is obvious, Ms. Confer, and I will not allow the important work we are doing here to be harmed because of an out of line inhuman anomaly.\n\n**Confer:** That ...\n\n**König:** Yes, Ms. Confer?\n\n**Confer:** Just ... please consider something other than throwing people to d- to die down there.\n\n//[König is seated once more]//\n\n**König:** Not people, Ms. Confer, and I am afraid I cannot give my authorization for that. There are many variables we have yet to study, and many of the subjects we have performed upon were moreso wasted due to the actions of your predecessor.\n\n**Confer:** We're both equal rank, I have authorization privileges too.\n\n**König:** And to change the procedures of //our// project requires mutual agreement, which we have not achieved. Now, I would suggest, Researcher Confer, that you find somewhere else to spend your time. I have anomalous //object// trials to consider.\n\n//[Confer turns and walks to the door, hesitating for a moment when she reaches it]//\n\n**König:** Is there something wrong, Researcher Conf-\n\n**Confer:** What if you were infected? What would you do?\n\n//[König looks at Confer]//\n\n**König:** Then I would find an adequate replacement, and then turn myself in, Carla.\n\n//[Confer opens the door and leaves.

Am I correct?\n\n...\n\nWell, I'll take your silence as a yes, then. Angelina died not just because of the failure to maintain proper protocol in the containment of the entity, but in the fact that we condoned the inefficient and disastrously unprepared restrainment of a god.\n\nI have taken multiple trips into the Foundation's database; I have found that the number of Secure Containment Protocols consisting of a singular \"type-green\" entity has risen drastically over the course of the last few decades. And yet, we are to dedicate more and more resources to the containment of these monsters.\n\n**Site Director:** What's your point, König?\n\n**König:** My point is that we have a simple and efficient solution here in this facility. Containment has so far proven to amount to little more than appeasement, and, if the need arises, indefinite sedation. But this much need, on such a grand scale as this, has strained the Foundation's resources few and thin.\n\nWhat we have here will eliminate these creatures - it will send them back once more into the night. There will be no hazards of sudden awakening, there will be no potential for Hume-level leakage, and there will be no more failed containment incidents - there will simply be eradication.\n\n//[A light knocking is heard from the other side of the door]//\n\n**Site Director:** Come in!\n\n//[Senior Researcher Confer opens the door, stepping inside before noticing König]//\n\n**König:** Ms. Confer!\n\n**Confer:** O-oh, I didn't realize you were here ... sir.\n\n**König:** No, no, please, come in.
