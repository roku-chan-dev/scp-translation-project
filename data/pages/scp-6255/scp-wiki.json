Due to the environment SCP-6255 events happen in, SCP-6255 is currently self-contained.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=https://live.staticflickr.com/3021/3067310185_d2a3af6601_b.jpg |\ncaption=Dr. Abbett's office prior to an SCP-6255 event.|\nalign=right |\nwidth=50%\n]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6255 is the designation given to a phenomenon that occurs within the boundaries of Site-94. SCP-6255 is believed to happen at least two times a week, although the estimated amount of weekly SCP-6255 events is currently unknown. SCP-6255's anomalous properties consist in the manifestation of an SCP-6255-1 instance in a random location within Site-94.\n\nSCP-6255-1 instances take the form of porcelain coffee cups containing different liquids[[footnote]]Usually hot liquids or fluids that create stains.[[/footnote]] and a pair of legs underneath them. Following the execution of an SCP-6255 event, SCP-6255-1 instances will attempt to reach the closest personnel, incline, and pour their liquids onto their clothes or any object said personnel is carrying[[footnote]]Usually, paper-made archives of contained anomalies, logs, or classified information.[[/footnote]] before displaying a crudely painted message on itself. This message may vary depending on the context of the event.\n\nOnce an SCP-6255-1 instance has completed its task, it will demanifest as soon as possible. As of the time of writing, 143 SCP-6255 events have been reported via surveillance since its appearance on 07/29/2021.\n\n**Addendum:** The next addendum is a non-comprehensive log including several SCP-6255 events recorded during the month of September, 2021. All recordings were stored in Site-94's surveillance room.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Log?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n> **{{Surveillance Log 6255.1}}**: Infirmary\n> ----\n> **Event:** During an analysis of [[[SCP-6354|Dr. Maya Warren's]]] vitals following her death, an SCP-6255-1 instance spawned in Site-94's sickbay and poured its liquids (Fresh Water) on Dr. Albert White's phone, who was at the moment browsing images and Internet memes.\n> \n> **Result:** The SCP-6255-1 instance displayed the message \"{{RESPECT FOR THE DEAD.}}\" before jumping inside Dr. White's lab coat and demanifesting.\n\n> **{{Surveillance Log 6255.2}}**: Cafeteria\n> ----\n> **Event:** Janitor Savannah Santos entered Site-94's cafeteria and ordered a cold coffee at the cafÃ©'s machine, but before she could grab a plastic cup, an SCP-6255-1 instance manifested, filled itself with hot coffee, and jumped onto Janitor Santos's suit.\n> \n> **Result:** The SCP-6255-1 instance fell to the floor, and instead of shattering, it displayed the following message before demanifesting: \"{{DISGUSTING}}\".\n\n> **{{Surveillance Log 6255.3}}**: Workbench\n> ----\n> **Event:** Junior Researcher Michaels was using a typewriter to work on the official classification of an anomaly that recently arrived at Site-94. Soon after, an SCP-6255-1 instance manifested in Dr. Michaels's lab coat and jumped onto the workbench, before pouring its liquids over the unfinished document.\n> \n> **Result:** The SCP-6255-1 displayed the following message before nodding with its body and demanifesting: \"{{PUT A BIT OF ART, JAMES}}\". Researcher Michaels later stated that the file he was working with was excessively colloquial.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6255 came to the Foundation's attention on 07/29/2021 soon after an SCP-6255-1 instance manifested in Junior Researcher Joseph Faraday's workbench and poured its liquids[[footnote]]Hot coffee.[[/footnote]] onto the document Researcher Faraday was working with. Following the SCP-6255 event, the SCP-6255-1 instance spawned a note from within its interior before demanifesting:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open Log?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"addendum\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n ROSES ARE RED\n VIOLETS ARE BLUE\n IF PAPER IS WHITE\n THEN ART'S WHAT YOU CAN DO\n[[/=]]\n\n= **ARE WE COOL YET?**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nJunior Researcher Joseph Faraday hasn't been affected by an SCP-6255 event since the anomaly's discovery.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6254]]] | SCP-6255 | [[[SCP-6256]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
