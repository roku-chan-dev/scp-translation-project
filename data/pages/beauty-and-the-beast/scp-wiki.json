Pale skin stretched taut across disfigured bones, talon-like fingers extending from warped arms. Her mouth could open wider than a snake's, and her eyes were as white as summer clouds. The townsfolk simply called her the Beast.\n\nOnce, perhaps, the Beast had another name, but neither she nor any of the townsfolk could remember what it was. The oldest of them spun tales of the terrors she had wrought, back when she still stalked the wilderness. It was said that she always screamed louder than her victims.\n\nAt the edge of the town was the castle, towering, eternal, alive. Its spires of sun-bleached bone blazed with light during the day, transforming to dark obelisks with the coming of night. Its walls and buttresses were little more than blocks of pink flesh, giant fangs protruding at irregular intervals. And there was a gate, a quivering web of muscle strands, red as blood.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Description:** SCP-2075 is Karcist Varis, a Sarkic practitioner and skilled carnomancer. Though she has displayed the ability to alter her physical appearance at will, SCP-2075 has consistently taken the form of a middle-aged Caucasian woman while in containment. \n\nSCP-2075 adheres to a seemingly unique sect of proto-Sarkicism, tentatively designated SCP-2075-A. SCP-2075 does not boast abilities beyond those typically observed in 'Karcists', hence her classification as Euclid.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n“Twenty-three years of complete cooperation with the Foundation. An additional sixteen years of cooperation with GRU Division “P”. Few requests for expanded amenities during containment approved without issue. Positive relationship with Dr. Albert Cronenberg, on friendly terms with multiple members of staff.” \n\nKarcist Varis laid back in her chair, though she took care to maintain a professional expression. There was a shuffling of papers as the man in front of her paused, then put the file back down on the desk.\n\n“I know you mean well, Varis, but I can't just let you access another anomaly like this.“\n\nShe studied Maurice for a moment, but the Director's tone was honest, his breathing regular and his blood pressure stable.\n\n“Why not? What harm could come of this?”\n\n“Command doesn't like it when you mix up anomalies, doesn't matter what they are. There's no way I can justify this, especially considering there's nothing wrong or unsustainable with how it's currently contained. I'm sorry.”\n\nNo change in tone, no spike in heart rate. He really did want to help, she realized. A rare virtue for Foundation employees, especially senior ones. She knew what button to press.\n\n“The O5s aren't the ones signing on this, though. You are. They like results more than anything. Give me access once a week, recorded and secured, and they won't have to fear this particular Broken Masquerade scenario anymore.”\n\nSilence followed. Varis wished she could see his expression. He was obviously contemplating how long it would take for his shadowy superiors to notice, and whether or not she'd succeed in time. She waited calmly. Patience was a quality she had in no short supply.\n\n“You really think you can do this? Talking to it?” He said eventually.\n\n“I think my proposal was quite clear, Director.” \n\n“And you're sure that you'll be–”\n\n“With all due respect sir, I am blind. I highly doubt I will see its face.”\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"storybook-hca\"]]\n\nAnd so the Beast lived within the castle while the townsfolk below went on with their lives. She paced the empty halls, adorned as they were with tapestries of skin and thick carpets of tightly woven hair. She sat at the decrepit library, staring at the volumes rotting on the shelves. She climbed to the tops of the tallest towers and descended them again without sparing a glance for the world outside. \n\nThe Beast was lonely in the castle, but the solitude brought with it a cold comfort. No one could see her while she was inside. No judgemental eyes followed her movements, no disgusted stares or unsettled glances. She was alone. \n\nUntil one summer morning, a stranger arrived at the crimson gate.\n\nThere was something odd about this stranger, though she couldn’t quite place it as she ran up the stairs. It was only when she carefully peeked out of a window on the third floor that she realized what it was. They were blindfolded, and could not see.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= [[size larger]]**Interview 096-2**[[/size]] \n\n**Interviewer:** SCP-2075\n\n**Interviewee:** SCP-096\n\n**Date:** 1/1/2014\n\n**Overseeing Researcher:** Dr. Albert Cronenberg.\n\n**Foreword:** Upon request, SCP-2075 was granted access to SCP-096’s containment chamber, on the condition that she be escorted by two blindfolded Foundation agents (Jonathan Li and Jacob D.

Then he found Ion.\n\n**SCP-2075:** “And Ion held six fingers aloft and upon their spears did the soldiers impale themselves. \"For you!\" they cried before the blood drowned their tongues. And Ion said, \"Now do you see?\" And Nadox wept, as more did skewer themselves in Ion's name, for he had seen and now knew the truth of his words.” \n\n**SCP-096:** Oh God, that’s– ugh. I thought Ion was… Is this– I don’t get it.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Indeed. This is very unlike our Ozi̮rmok. Why would they demand the suicide of their followers? Perhaps you can tell me. \n\n**SCP-096:** Maybe… It's like a sort of trust-fall? The soldiers trust them so much that they know Ion’s spears won’t kill them.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Close. Not only would they not kill them, but Ion would never hurt them at all. This implies that ‘the blood’ that drowns them isn’t theirs, but the Ozi̮rmok’s. To quote //Sone Tal//, “All that comes from your flesh is sacred, for it contains the knowledge of my words and deeds. The blood cannot forget; it can only learn.\"\n\n**SCP-096:** The blood contains Ion's knowledge...? So by ‘drowning’ them, Ion’s… teaching them something? Giving them a part of that knowledge?\n\n**SCP-2075:** Exactly. At least, that’s my interpretation. Later, Nadox would become the greatest scholar of the Nälkä, and I believe he’s still out there somewhere continuing the work. At that moment, not only does he see the trust the people put in the Grand Karcist, but he witnesses their teachings firsthand.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Ion despised death, believing that to spill our blood is to feed the Archons of Yaldabaoth. It is no coincidence they named their empire Kalmaktama, the Deathless. They would never ask their followers to sacrifice their lives just to prove a point.\n\n**SCP-096:** Why is it worded so… ominously then? If I didn't have you here, I'd assume this passage implies we should give up everything for Ion’s glory because they know best.\n\n**SCP-2075:** I do not know. The texts are incredibly old, what once might have been clear is now more difficult to parse. \n\n**SCP-096:** What if it's a sort of code? In order to properly harness the power, you have to understand what Ion really meant. And to do that you need to read the scripture as a whole.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Ah, a test? A way to separate the true believers from the appropriators. Interesting. I've never thought about it that way. \n\n**SCP-096:** Really?

We were both religious minorities, and people confused one for the other on more than one occasion. But that’s a different story.

You mentioned she was Ion’s lover?\n\n**SCP-2075:** Indeed, though as I’ve mentioned the exact relations between the Klavigars and the Ozi̮rmok are difficult to pinpoint. What’s particularly interesting about Lovataar is that she is the only Klavigar who wasn’t a victim of the Daevites in one way or another. Quite the opposite, she was born into the nobility.\n\n**SCP-096:** Enemies to lovers?\n\n**SCP-2075:** Precisely. You’re becoming quite the pupil.\n\n**SCP-096:** It’s a pretty common trope. I’m assuming Lovataar wasn’t a fan of Ion at the beginning, considering they were attempting to destroy her empire.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Oh she //despised// them. She would send the finest slave catchers after the Grand Karcist day and night, the bounties doubling every day. When that didn’t work, she began to send whole legions to snuff them out. Eventually, Ion’s curiosity got the better of them, and they snuck into her palace and entered her quarters alone.\n\n**SCP-096:** Truly a knight in shining armor. Let me guess, she fell in love at first sight?\n\n**SCP-2075:** We don’t know. It is said the Ozi̮rmok stayed there with her for twelve days, before leaving with Lovataar by their side. She would never return to the Daeva.\n\n**SCP-096:** So they //did// enamor her! Called it.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Am I boring you?\n\n**SCP-096:** No, no, I was just… hm. I suppose I was expecting more depth? Nadox and Orok were both way more interesting.\n\n**SCP-2075:** Love can be a very private thing. There is a reason we were not told what transpired on those twelve days and nights. What do you think happened?\n\n**SCP-096:** They must have talked a lot, there’s not much else to do alone in a room for so long. Other than, well, you know. But somehow she went from pure hatred to unbreakable love, strong enough to make her give up everything she had.\n\n**SCP-2075:** And?\n\n**SCP-096:** There are plenty of stories about love turning to hate and vice-versa, but… Did Ion love her back the same way?\n\n**SCP-2075:** “And Ion looked upon the gift and their heart was moved again, for they knew what great cost Lovataar had borne in the crafting of such a gift. And they bade the celebrants of the great feast to be still, and they spoke to them of her love. It was then that they decreed that the seat would travel with them, wherever they should go, to always remind themself that they led only by the love of those they would lead.”\n\n**SCP-096:** Awww. They’re cute.\n\n**SCP-2075:** That is certainly one way to interpret the text. \n\n**SCP-096:** So Lovataar represents a willing sacrifice, what we’re willing to do for love.

Immediately afterward, an amorphous mass of flesh and bone, genetically sourced from the two agents, ruptured the containment cell and carried SCP-096 in the direction of SCP-2075, who was in her own cell at the time. Both anomalies proceeded to breach containment, the mass breaking through Site-66’s eastern external wall before finally coming to a halt. External camera footage revealed SCP-096 to be carrying SCP-2075, moving at a speed of ~300 km/h.\n\nAgents Li and Moore were discovered unconscious but otherwise unharmed within SCP-096’s containment chamber. They were subsequently quarantined and interrogated, though they appeared to possess no memory of the incident. It is theorized that the two were remotely controlled by SCP-2075 during this time via a hitherto unknown ability. \n\nThe whereabouts of SCP-096 and SCP-2075 are unknown, the latter discarding her tracking chip 40 kilometers east of Site-66.
