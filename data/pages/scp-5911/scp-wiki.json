Outpost-237 has been established in the rural entertainment plaza in which SCP-5911 is located and is tasked with monitoring for potential trespassers. \n\nAny civilians attempting to enter SCP-5911 are to be detained and assessed for possible exposure to SCP-5911-1. Cleared subjects may be released at the discretion of the Outpost Coordinator. \n\nAutomated web crawlers have been deployed to identify and censor any online references to SCP-5911-1. Any web domains claiming to represent SCP-5911-1 are to be seized and shut down indefinitely. Foundation assets in the United States Postal Service have been tasked with identifying and destroying any material referencing SCP-5911-1.\n\nIf an instance of SCP-5911-1 is identified, Outpost-237 is to be alerted and prepped for an increase in potential trespassers. Any Foundation personnel exposed to SCP-5911-1 are not permitted within 10 kilometers of SCP-5911. \n\nAs of this writing, no instances of SCP-5911-2 have been observed exiting SCP-5911. Outpost-237 has been outfitted with humanoid containment cells in the event that an instance of SCP-5911-2 does exit SCP-5911.\n\nTesting is currently suspended pending Ethics Committee review.  \n\n**Description:** SCP-5911 is an abandoned movie theater, originally branded as a Carmike Cinemas, located approximately 65 kilometers north of Jacksonville, Florida. When dormant, the structure contains ten screening rooms as well as a concession stand and reception area near the front entrance. \n\nDuring dormant periods, SCP-5911 displays no anomalous properties. It is only upon the manifestation of an instance of SCP-5911-1 that the structure’s anomalous properties activate. \n\nSCP-5911-1 is the designation for an anomalous event known as the North Florida Independent Film Festival. SCP-5911-1 manifests seemingly at random, with dormant periods lasting anywhere from 8 weeks to 24 months. All instances of SCP-5911-1 naturally end approximately 14 days after manifestation. \n\nDuring an active period, SCP-5911-1 will attempt to contact civilians within a 600 kilometer radius of SCP-5911. SCP-5911-1 exclusively targets subjects that express a passion for cinema in some capacity, with filmmakers being especially vulnerable to its negative effects. Communication attempts typically take the form of physical mailers as well as targeted advertisements on social media. A physical source for these materials has not been identified. \n\nThese materials invariably attempt to persuade readers to submit an original film of their making to SCP-5911-1. Below is a typical example of these materials:\n \n\n> **CALLING ALL FILMMAKERS, WE NEED YOU! SUBMISSIONS OPEN NOW!**\n> \n> The North Florida Independent Film Festival is back for our 10th consecutive year at the beautiful Carmike 10, and you're invited to join the festivities! Here at the NFIFF, we’re excited to announce our annual opportunity[[footnote]]There is no evidence that SCP-5911-1 follows an annual schedule.[[/footnote]] for local filmmakers to submit their original films for a chance to screen at this year’s festival. \n> \n> Qualifying films will be screened in full at the festival, with free admission and drink tokens for the entire cast and crew! It doesn’t matter if it’s a home video or a Hollywood production, we’re dedicated to showcasing the true spirit of independent filmmaking.\n> \n> Featuring over 150+ films over three weekends, the NFIFF is the largest and only Oscar-accredited film festival on the First Coast. Come mingle with acclaimed filmmakers, award-winning celebrities, and other movie fanatics just like you!\n> \n> You can submit your original film online at [DATA EXPUNGED] or you can mail in a physical copy to [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\nAny person or persons (hereby referred to as “subjects”) who submit an original film to SCP-5911-1 will receive an invitation to a festival screening within two days. Invitations will direct subjects to SCP-5911 and inform them of the time and date of their screening, typically within one week of submission. \n\nIf a subject enters SCP-5911 on the date provided, they will be instantly transported to an isolated pocket dimension cosmetically resembling the non-anomalous interior of the structure.[[footnote]]Testing has indicated that individuals who have not submitted a film to SCP-5911-1 will not experience this effect, and will simply walk into the theater with no negative consequences. [[/footnote]] The reception area has been slightly modified to accommodate a film festival, with a guest check-in station and full bar near the concession stand. Various decorations mentioning SCP-5911-1 by name can also be found in this area. \n\nOnce inside the theater, subjects will be unable to exit the structure by any means.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum: SCP-5911-1 Film Log\" hide=\"- Addendum: SCP-5911-1 Film Log\"]]\nAs part of an exploratory mission into SCP-5911, MTF Omega-11 (“Ocean’s Eleven”) placed a recording device in one of the projection rooms inside the structure. This is a brief selection of films captured by that device.\n\n\n> **Title:** //Bubble//\n> \n> **Duration:** 0:09:13\n> \n> **Description:** A red bubble floats through a pastoral landscape. The camera follows the bubble for six minutes before it pops. The camera remains static on an open field for the remainder of the runtime. \n\n\n> **Title:** //The Wind Tells All//\n> \n> **Duration:** 0:19:04\n> \n> **Description:** A poacher hunts for rare and exotic birds in the bamboo forests of Southeast Asia. The majority of the film focuses on the poacher in a prone position as he listens to various bird calls. At 0:17:19, a South China tiger (Panthera tigris) suddenly mauls the poacher. The tiger drags the screaming man off screen, at which point the film ends. \n\n\n> **Title:** //Home, or So They Call It//\n> \n> **Duration:** 1:38:20\n> \n> **Description:** Set in the 1950s, Chloë Sevigny stars as Mary Lloyd, a bored and self-destructive housewife living a double-life as a street prostitute. The film consists largely of Mary’s sexual encounters with various men, with each encounter being increasingly disturbing in nature. Eventually, Mary’s husband (played by Gregory Peck)[[footnote]]This is the first recorded instance of non-contemporaneous actors appearing in the same film.[[/footnote]] discovers her in the act. A scuffle ensues, and Mary stabs him to death. She then drives home and suffocates her teenage son in his bed before stripping naked and walking outside. The film ends as Mary walks nude down a suburban road. \n\n\n> **Title:** //Whiplash'd//\n> \n> **Duration:** 0:59:58\n> \n> **Description:** Documentary featurette featuring two unknown film critics discussing the 2014 film //Whiplash//. Analysis overlooks key plot elements and overemphasizes the role of the \"Madonna/Whore\" dichotomy, which is largely absent from the source material. At the 0:38:12 mark, both critics begin repeating the phrase \"Are you rushing or are you dragging?\" to each other for the remainder of the film's runtime.\n\n\n> **Title:** //Millie//\n> \n> **Duration:** 2:05:12\n> \n> **Description:** Documentary feature about the life of child star Millie Bobby Brown. The film documents the period between her rise to stardom until to her untimely death by overdose at age 27.[[footnote]]The Foundation is currently monitoring Ms. Brown in connection with SCP-5911. As of this writing, approximately 70% of future events described in //Millie// have transpired in reality.[[/footnote]]\n\n\n> **Title:** //1898//\n> \n> **Duration:** 2:45:51\n> \n> **Description:** Set in the Spanish-American war, the film stars Timothée Chalamet as Private Clarke Jones, an American soldier stationed in the Philippines. After falling in love with a Filipino prisoner of war, Jones plots to break the man out of prison. The two are eventually captured and executed by the United States Army.\n\n\n> **Title:** //Pixar’s Up//\n> \n> **Duration:** 1:36:04\n> \n> **Description:** Live-action remake of the Pixar film //Up//. All human actors retain their character’s stylized proportions, resulting in grotesque bodily abnormalities. No other diversions from the original film have been noted. \n\n\n> **Title:** //Lily's Pet//\n> \n> **Duration:** 1:49:13\n> \n> **Description:** The film stars actor Shia Lebouf as Jason, a homeless man who derives pleasure from harming animals. Jason eventually falls in love with Lily, a young social worker with a love for dogs. The two develop a romantic relationship, but Jason is plagued with fantasies of killing her 6-month old Boston terrier.\n\n\n> **Title:** //The Hidden Secrets of the SCP Foundation//\n> \n> **Duration:** 9:45:09\n> \n> **Description:** [DATA EXPUNGED]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum: Discovery Report\" hide=\"- Addendum: Discovery Report\"]]\nThe Foundation was first alerted to the existence of SCP-5911 after the 2016 disappearance of an independent film crew from Savannah, Georgia. Foundation assets in local law enforcement were able to use cellular data to trace the subjects’ last known location to SCP-5911. \n\nInitial expeditions reported no signs of anomalous activity in or around SCP-5911, but leaflets with references to SCP-5911-1 were recovered from the scene. Surveillance footage taken from the area revealed that the subjects had vanished upon stepping inside SCP-5911. Initial attempts to recreate this effect failed. \n\nAt the urging of Dr. Candace Sydney, Director of Scientific Arts at Site-426, the Foundation authorized the production of a short film to be submitted to SCP-5911-1 in an attempt to activate SCP-5911’s anomalous properties. \n\nAfter several revisions, a screenplay written by Dr. Sydney was approved and a modest budget was allocated to the project. Dr. Sydney would serve as the film’s director, and additional cast and crew members were sourced from Mobile Task Force Omega-11 (Ocean’s Eleven). \n\nBelow is an excerpt from the approved final script. \n\n> \n> \n> {{INT. STAFF QUARTERS - EVENING}}\n> \n> {{DR. HARMON LUNN is sitting in the dark, all alone except for the stiff drink in his hand. }}\n> \n> {{He scribbles at his note pad with a serious expression. //These incident reports don't write themselves.//}}\n> \n> {{A KNOCK at the door breaks his concentration.}}\n> [[=]]\n> {{DR.

She and the entirety of MTF Omega-11 received invitations to SCP-5911-1 the following day. \n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ RESTRICTED: Level 4 Clearance\" hide=\"- Clearance Granted: SCP-5911 Exploration Log\"]]\n**Note:** On January 12, 2019, MTF Omega-11 was tasked with infiltrating and exploring SCP-5911 during an active period.

When full, the hole in the entity’s face closes once again.//\n> \n> **Tarantino:** Okay, I take back what I said about the popcorn. \n> \n> **Hitchcock:** Outpost, can you run a playback and see if those things were here when we arrived?\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** Yes, one second. \n> \n> //The researchers at Outpost 267 review the footage and conclude that the instances were not present upon the team’s entry.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** Looks like they manifested some time after you came in. It’s possible that SCP-5911 can manifest these entities at will. (To Junior Researcher Holland) Make a note of that. \n> \n> **Hitchcock:** Copy that, I want everyone on high alert. Just because these things haven’t tried to kill us yet doesn’t mean they won’t try it eventually. \n> \n> //MTF Omega-11 approaches the concession stand. There are two hallways to either side, each lined with theater entrances and extending out of sight.//\n> \n> **Hitchcock:** Let’s stick together, we’ll clear the left hallway before moving onto the right. \n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** Reminder, documenting the premiere of [REDACTED] is mission priority.\n> \n> **Hitchcock:** Copy that.

She is holding a wireless microphone and waves toward the crowd.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** Thank you all for coming out to support my little film!\n> \n> //She pauses for applause to dwindle.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** As many of you know, filmmaking has always been something deeply personal for me. I always dreamt of being up here one day, making the corny speech before the lights dim and the real movie magic begins. I would not be here today if it wasn’t for the support of my loving parents, the love of my husband Greg and, of course, the SCP Foundation for financing this project. Without them, none of us would be in this room today. Let’s give a round of applause to the SCP Foundation, everyone!\n> \n> //The audience cheers and claps. MTF-Hitchcock's camera briefly turns to face the rest of MTF Omega-11.

Such an amazing organization that’s doing incredible work in keeping the spirit of indie filmmaking alive and thriving! I am so grateful for this opportunity and I'm looking forward to joining your permanent roster of in-house filmmakers. It is truly an honor, and I know my cast and crew feels the same way. \n> \n> //As the applause subsides, Dr. Sydney gestures to MTF Omega-11. The substance has successfully spread across the entirety of the agents' faces. MTF Omega-11 begin to thrash in their seats.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** I want to thank these four amazingly talented men for helping bring my creative vision to life. It was their hard work and sacrifice that made this movie possible. Together, we will continue to make original films for years to come. I can't thank you enough, you guys rock!\n> \n> //Distorted laughter from the audience. The unknown substance begins sloughing off the agents in chunks, revealing blank faces with no discernible features.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** They say the actor's job is to remove themselves from the material, so that the soul of the character can truly inhabit their bodies. If there is one thing that I've learned as a director, it's that the best actors are blank canvases.\n> \n> //The substances affixing MTF Omega-11 to their seats completely dissolves, and the team rises. They join Dr. Sydney on stage.//\n> \n> **Dr. Sydney:** So without further ado, I’d like to welcome you all to the world premiere of my film, [REDACTED]. I hope you all enjoy watching the movie as much as we enjoyed making it. Be sure to stick around after the screening for a Q&A with the director - moi - as well as the surviving members of the cast and crew!
