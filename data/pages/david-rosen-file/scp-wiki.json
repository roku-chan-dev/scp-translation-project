Assigned job since 2012 has been to perform user-level Information Technology Support at Site-19.  Competency level is debatable, Rosen is not believed to be proficient with any technologies he is certified in. However, this has not been proven and given his perfect attendance record there is no urgent need to replace him. \n\nEffectiveness has been uneven. Although machines and devices sent directly to his office are repaired within hours, logs on the Technical Support Request Line often go unheeded. While this may appear to be highly unprofessional, many of the requests to the Technical Support Request Line violate Foundation protocols and, as such, are technically not counted against Rosen for the purposes of his performance reviews. This has played a large part in his continued employment.\n\nRosen is believed to live out of his office, which has been evaluated as one of the filthiest on record for any personnel in the history of the SCP Foundation. Every inch of floor space is covered by various PC parts dating back to the early 1970's. \n\nIt is required to wear a dust mask before entering the office. The combination of body odor and lithium grease odors has been considered for use as a scent-based deterrent.\n\nRosen is haunted by the memory of his predecessor. System Analyst Patrick Gephart disappeared mysteriously on July 29th, 2011. Since then, Rosen has filed no less than 412 reports indicating he believes Gephart is stalking him or otherwise attempting to undermine him in his Technical Research position. \n\nWhile Rosen has not been able to provide proof of any physical encounters with Gephart, it is notable that no evidence has been found that Gephart exited Site-19 at any date after his on-site disappearance. Further investigation is to be undertaken as necessary to calm Rosen down.\n\nKnown associate of [http://www.scp-wiki.net/leveritas-personnel-file Dr. Veritas]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[image owlRosen.png width=\"32%\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n\n^^**__//Portrait Sketch//__**^^\n\n----\n\n^^**__Position:__**^^\nTechnology Researcher\n\n----\n\n^^**__Clearance:__**^^\nLevel 2 (Restricted)\n\n----\n\n^^**__Posting Location(s)__**^^\n//Site-19//\n//Site-██//\n\n----\n\n^^**__Psychological Profile Summary (2014):__**^^\nParanoia \nTime blindness \n----\n\n^^**__Known Relations:__**^^\nDr. Tim Taylor (Supervisor)\nDr. Blaire Roth (Psychiatrist)\nRsr.
