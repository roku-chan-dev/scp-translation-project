Most of you have had no prior awareness of this KTO - this is a deliberate choice on our part. We have recruited alumni from the Mages Academy into our own ranks in the past, but their loyalties are too divided to use any of them in this operation.

Although lacking most of the insights of Unified Thaumatology and instead relying on outdated theories of \"Astral Energy\", the thaumaturgy they teach is demonstrably effective, despite its typical reliance on complex rituals and vocalised spells. While many graduates from the Mages Academy have gone on to become useful GOC assets, the training of unregistered Type Blue Parathreats presents a significant threat to Normalcy, and a number of graduates have been involved with anti-Coalition activities.\n\n**Structure:** Each constituent university or college is nominally independent and run by an Archmagister, but the curriculum and policies of the Academies as a whole are decided by the Magistrate, a council of Archmagisters. The Magistrate regards itself as a sovereign legal entity enforcing its own regulations as spelled out in its Charter, and has ignored all orders to surrender parathreats to the GOC for termination.\n\n**Resources:** The Mages Academy operates covertly within ordinary institutes of higher education, awarding their graduates with degrees in conventional fields in addition to titles (from Apprentice to Grandmaster) reflecting their thaumaturgic proficiency. The Academies receive financial support from their graduates, and effectively have access to a paramilitary force by calling on staff and alumni to enforce the terms of their Charter.\n\n**Standing Orders:** Although unregulated magic and unregistered Type Blue parahumans pose a significant threat to Normalcy, for pragmatic reasons a diplomatic rather than military approach has been taken so far. The Magistrate of the Academies has rejected multiple offers for Council membership.\n\n**Revised Orders:** While individual members of KTO-1466-Houdini will only be terminated if non-compliant, it has has been decided that the best course of action will be to liquidate the currently existing organisation and restructure any remnants in accordance with the GOC's Fivefold Mission (\"Operation Sternenfall\"). Detained Staff and Students confirmed to be human will be re-educated to ensure compliance with GOC Resolution on the Practice of Thaumaturgy. Non-human parathreats will be identified and terminated.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n|| **CC:** Operation Sternenfall ||\n|| From: ##blue|PTKrammer@PHYSICSdiv.goc##||\nCongratulations,\n\nFor obvious op-sec reasons we couldn't tell you in advance, but you've just been part of one of the largest operations in the Coalition's history. Simultaneous raids on two-dozen locations across Europe was difficult to plan in secret, but you carried out the operation with the courage and determination we expect from our PHYSICS Strike Teams.\n\nI can't say they didn't see us coming, quite a few of them managed to get away, but we believe we've managed to detain the majority of the Academy's students.

Let me assure you that you all performed admirably in a stressful situation. Blues aren't quite as unpredictable as Greens, but termination is often the only option - our [[[goc-supplemental-equipment| Black Suits]]] may be bulletproof, but they don't make you invincible! On the other hand, the Academies seem to be teaching even their newest students spells that protect them from most conventional weapons, but we're working on a solution to that for next time - and yes, there will be a next time.\n\nFinally, I want to commend the work of our PSYCHE Division. Those of us in PHYSICS often make light of their undercover efforts, but without their intelligence we'd never have been able to pull off something on this scale.

KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather has survived three subsequent termination attempts due to the continued use of remotely controlled replicas and its own paranormal abilities. KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather rebuilt KTO-1982-Darwin by recruiting other fugitives with scientific and paratechnological expertise, especially after relocating to UT-2005-Zweifach to evade the Coalition's reach. \n\n**Resources:** The IMBW has limited financial resources, but has significant parascientific capabilities, with a focus on the mental and physical alteration of its formerly human members and test subjects. KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather embraces self-experimentation, possessing both biological and cybernetic augmentations that have been augmented in each subsequent encounter with the GOC. Strength, endurance and regenerative ability are significantly above human norms, and KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather is armed with paratechnological weaponry, either remotely controlled by a brain-computer interface or incorporated into its cybernetic left arm.\n\n**Standing Orders:** KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather appears to bear a personal grudge against the GOC due to the termination of a parathreat that KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/die-liebe-des-professor-alexander-voss claims was formerly its wife]. It is expected to engage the GOC, likely supported by other members of the IMBW with unknown paranormal abilities. Conventional weaponry will, at best, slow down KTE-1983-Red-Bronze-Darwinfather.

While I was not present until the very end, my experience with Astral Manipulation makes me more than qualified to comment on the numerous errors and oversights that plagued this operation.\n\n(A note on the terminology: I have attended [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| your lectures]]] at the ICSUT, and while your theories involving EVE and the observer effect certainly are ONE approach to magic, Astral Manipulation is something quite distinct. I have long been insisting that the more accurate \"Type Violet\" term be adopted to refer to magical practitioners who draw on energy from other planes of existence.)\n\nThe first complication was the weather - if you'd consulted me in advance, I'd have pointed out that the rituals for weather manipulation are relatively simple when working within a closed system like Sjhlfels, and that would have enabled you to protect yourselves better against the lightning that was directed with such deadly effect. Unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done to stop a weather system like that once it's established and sustained, and in the absence of the original casters to reverse their workings, constant thunderstorms may well become a permanent feature of the Sjhlfels microclimate. \n\nThe landing craft coming in from the Rhein weren't designed for that kind of weather, and quite a few of them were overturned.  I know there are a lot of rumours about some sort of creature or creatures in the water, but that's not been confirmed - I hear that trawlers are still dragging the coast to see if the the bodies can be found. The rough waves and strong winds scattered the fleet, and every boat that got too close to the Sjhlfels docks were sunk by mages on the shore - the idiom \"sitting ducks\" comes to mind. While the landings further up the coast were successful, they were more spread out along the shore than was ideal, enabling the defenders to carry out a defeat in detail by attacking each landing party while they were still disembarking.  However, I've been informed that despite the high casualties and the lack of progress made for most of the day, this assault was essential to keep our foes divided.\n\nThe force that came in overland from the Sihl Valley made much faster progress. The mud and rain made it difficult for most of our vehicles, but the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-017-de R.T.I. Grizzly] tanks really were impressive, both for their manoeuvrability and for the ability of those railguns to punch through pretty much everything. There were a few ambushes by mages, but generally the battle went very well while in the open, and Coalition forces quickly reached the town.\n\nIf I had been consulted, I would have advised that you reduce the entire settlement to rubble via an artillery bombardment. In the confined spaces that characterise urban warfare, a small number of prepared defenders can inflict heavy losses on a much larger attacking force. While I have been told that the plan was to capture the Nexus mostly intact, you severely underestimated the capacities of the Mages Academy, likely because no graduate of the academy was consulted until it was far too late. \n\nThere was a regrettable lack of precautions taken to protect against psychic influence. Entire units were hallucinating, attacking enemies that weren't there, or directing fire against our own forces (the fact that the R.T.I. Hammer P1 bypasses all armour and cover is something of a mixed blessing). I believe that the psionics divisions was eventually able to incapacitate Archmagister Weber, but I'm afraid that the brain damage caused by his retaliatory curse is irreversible.\n\nAfter recovering from this initial confusion, our forces then proceeded deep enough into the town to be attacked from all sides, primarily by mages but also by local residents. The attack by Professor Voss and his IMBW creations was particularly noteworthy, since the collateral damage from the artillery bombardment was almost as deadly as the initial attack - indeed, he ensured that he was totally surrounded. I suppose you wouldn't expect to find a body after the use of that many incendiaries, but the lack of one is still concerning.\n\nThe use of unconventional weaponry to bypass Mages Academy wards was ingenious, although I doubt they'll be so unprepared next time you face them on the battlefield. They'd already developed  countermeasures to your otherwise impressive armor - seeing through invisibility is trivial, it offers limited protection from lightning strikes, and it seems the mages also developed a rather viscious spell to warp and distort the plating and crush the wearer inside it. After their initial losses to the R.T.I. Hammer P1, the mages learned to keep their distance and protect themselves with mobility and stealth. The [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-124-de Invisibility cloaks] created by Mirabilis seem to have been used to great effect to ambush and evade us, and I suspect that Ways were created to connect locations throughout Sjhlfels together to enable rapid advances and retreats. With our progress slowed by the barricades and traps they filled the streets with, we certainly took more casualties than they did.\n\n(Personally, I don't trust the reports that Das Wunderkabinet was destroyed - I know the lot the shop was in is now occupied only by rubble, but I speak from experience when I say that my former apprentice always was very skilled at slipping away.)\n\nAs for General Krammer, it seems the cause of death was venom from an unknown source. I suspect that one or more members of the Caecus Carnelia Collective specifically targeted him, because troops report receiving orders from him long after his body would have been cold - or at least, orders that they are confident originated from him. That impersonation seems to have been used to get our forces exactly where the enemy wanted them.\n\nIt was clear that we'd eventually win with our superior numbers, but what you took for a fighting retreat was really a trap. If I'd been consulted I could have told you the dangers of cornering an Archmage within an Academy that they've had plenty of time to fortify, especially when a man as spiteful as Szabó Janos is coordinating the defense. He was a thorn in the Soviets' side in his youth, and it seems he's only become more stubborn in his old age. Your thaumatologists may have eventually worked out how to protect themselves from the lightning strikes he was directing at us, but in the absence of any understanding of the principles behind the wards placed around the SHAM, they decided to just brute force their way through. It could have been an accident due to channelling too much energy into his defences without the proper precautions, but I suspect Szabó knew exactly what he was doing when he allowed an Astral Being to possess him. \n\nReshaping the storm above Sjhlfels into a cyclone that quickly was the kind of magic that would normally be impossible, but those limits simply don't apply to Mages possessed by [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/neue-horizonte Astral Beings]. It's rather difficult to explain to an uneducated audience, but imagine taking hold of a live wire, except the energy that courses through your body has a will of its own. \n\nEntire divisions were swept away by that hurricane, allowing Szabó (since the entity held all of his knowledge, I'll consider it to be him) to focus all of his attention on the little that was left, consisting of the thaumatologists capable of protecting themselves from those winds, and the tanks and [[[goc-supplemental-equipment| Orange Suits]]] that were too heavy to be picked up.\n\nSzabó attacked those by creating an intense electromagnetic field around himself, destroying any electronics he got too close to, but also blocking every shot from the R.T.I. Hammer P1. I expect we'll be seeing a lot more of that defense in future now that the mages know it works. Conventional weapons and railguns could still be used, but Szabó was constantly in motion and could easily deflect or redirect the few projectiles that would have hit their mark. That left only our thaumatologists, who eventually brough him down by throwing out too many different spells for him to counter, although not without a great many losses. Szabó resorted to tearing apart the fabric of reality to bypass their defenses - for obvious reasons, this is not a technique someone with concern for their own safety would ever use. However, he was an old man, I suspect he simply wanted to take as many of you down with him as he could.\n\nIt's a good thing you called on me to clean up that mess, the reality breaches were already starting to spread, releasing dangerous levels of Astral Radiation. If they'd been uncontained for much longer the entire Sjhlfels Nexus may have broken apart and collapsed into the Astral Plane. I eventually gathered  enough Mages to perform a ritual to excise the area around the Hochshule from the Sjhlfels Nexus. While that was the safest way to repair (or at least remove) the damage, it does means that the town of Sjhlfels is now smaller on the inside.\n\nI have no idea where all the residents of Sjhlfels went, but one would presume that you did not actually have all entrances and exits to the town blockaded, and that they evacuated either before or during your rather slow invasion. I suppose this operation could be considered a success in achieving its main objective, however I must insist that I am consulted prior to any further actions against the Mages Academy. The destruction of a non-anomalous settlement will be much more difficult to cover up.\n\n//Mundus, Normalis//\n\nMagister Krone\nEsoteric Research and Development\nPTOLOMY Division\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n|| **CC:** Operation Sternenfall ||\n|| From: ##blue|BOLizt@PSYCHEDiv.goc##||\nOperatives,\n\nAlthough casualties sustained during the capture of CT[[footnote]]Coalition Territory[[/footnote]]-2005-Zweifach were higher than anticipated, High Command has deemed the losses of men and material to be acceptable sacrifices in pursuit of the GOC's main missions: the Survival of Humanity and the Destruction of Parathreats. \n\nMagister Krone's remarks will be taken into consideration.\n\n//Mundus, Normalis//\n\nBraun Lizt\nParathreat Intelligence\nPSYCHE Division\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n|| **CC:** Operation Uberflutung||\n|| From: ##blue|PTKrammer@PHYSICSdiv.goc##||\n\nWin another battle like that, and you'll have no soldiers left to follow you.
