  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-4134\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** In the event of a terrorist attack or mass shooting within a 1km radius of Paris, France, Applied Task Force Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\") will conduct a sweep radially from the location of the incident. Upon discovery of any SCP-4134-1 instance, no fewer than three personnel, equipped with blast-resistant gear, are to contain the instance according to Procedure 4134-Harpo until the instance resumes non-anomalous behavior (see Document 4134-Harpo). \n\nAll restoration projects performed on Parisian buildings certified as \"historic monuments\" are to be assigned three members of Applied Task Force Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\"), accompanied by two D-class personnel trained in mime, to be converted to instances of SCP-4134-1. Instances are to be contained using Procedure 4134-Harpo on-site until renovations are complete. \n\nMembership in ATF Sacre-2 (\"Mimesweepers\") will be granted only to Foundation personnel --with French citizenship-- born in France. D-class personnel recruited for use in SCP-4134 containment efforts must also have --French citizenship-- been born in France.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4134 refers to a pattern of behavior exhibited by mimes[[footnote]] Mime is a theatrical medium in which actors act out a story through body motions without speaking.[[/footnote]] within the city of Paris, France, triggered whenever the city of Paris or any Parisian buildings classified as \"Historic Monuments\" are threatened. Previous threats have included:\n\n* Military invasion of Paris\n* Destruction of Parisian buildings or monuments certified as \"historic\" \n* Renovation or restoration projects on \"historic\" monuments or buildings, entailing the removal or destruction of major features of same (see Incident Log 4134.3)\n\nWhenever one of the above occurs, one Parisian mime will spontaneously become an instance of SCP-4134-1. Mimes appear to be selected based on proximity to threats, with closer candidates being prioritized over those further away. SCP-4134-1 instances' anomalous properties persist until being \"activated\" (see below), or until the \"threat\" to Paris has been eliminated (for instance, when \"historic\" buildings are returned to normal).\n\nUpon conversion, SCP-4134-1 instances travel to a pedestrian walkway within 100 meters of the perceived threat. Upon reaching a suitable location, an instance will take a kneeling position with both arms extended forward from the shoulder. At this point, it is considered \"armed\" and will remain completely immobile until triggered.\n\nWhen armed, any force which displaces either hand of SCP-4134-1 more than 3cm will trigger a directional explosion outward from a point in space no more than 30 centimeters in front of the instance's chest, typically resulting in the destruction of both hands. \n\nAfter detonation, SCP-4134-1 instances become non-anomalous, typically showing panic and confusion at their injuries. Expiration due to blood loss is common without immediate medical treatment. Individuals are unable to recall time spent as SCP-4134-1 instances, or provide any information about the source of SCP-4134.\n\nSCP-4134 was declared Neutralized on 09/01/1944 after all ███ instances of SCP-4134-1 in Foundation containment lost their anomalous properties. However, three new instances of SCP-4134-1 manifested following the bombing of ██████████ in 1960. Testing was conducted to determine the cause of the anomaly. SCP-4134 was subsequently reclassified as Euclid.\n\n[[include component:coltop\n    show=+ Incident Report 4134.3 |\n    hide=- Incident Report 4134.3\n]]\n> Date: ██/██/1962\n> Location: Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris\n> \n> On ██/██/1962, workers began removing the 19th-century grisaille windows in the nave, as part of an extensive restoration effort on the cathedral. While monitoring SCP-████ for changes during the restoration, Dr. Richard witnessed the manifestation of a new SCP-4134-1 instance. Foundation agents were alerted and contained the instance using Procedure 4134-Harpo. \n> Believing SCP-4134 to be connected to the restoration project, Dr. Richard instructed workers to return the original grisaille window to its position. SCP-4134-1 instance spontaneously regained mobility, and was subsequently amnesticized and released. SCP-4134 containment procedures updated.[[footnote]] Further testing to determine which buildings are linked to SCP-4134's effect has been denied.

Interview has been translated from French.\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Laurent Ruquier, host\n> **Interviewee:** Marcel Marceau, a.k.a. \"Bip the Clown,\" professional mime artist\n> \n> [EXTRANEOUS DIALOGUE REMOVED]\n> \n> **Ruquier:** Of course. How did you become involved with the French Resistance?\n> \n> **Marceau:** While I was in Limoges, my cousin spoke with me often. He was in the business of rescuing children, and he wanted me to join him.\n> \n> **R:** This was your cousin, [*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Loinger Georges]?\n> \n> **M:** That's correct. Georges approached me a number of different times to ask me to join different projects, but I was never a fan of combat so I stuck to that kind of job.\n> \n> **R:** Fascinating. May I ask, how did you have time to study mime during this period?\n> \n> **M:** Actually, that's an interesting story. I was in Paris for a month working with the Resistance on some project or other- one of Georges' schemes. I needed to duck into a building quickly to avoid a German officer. That's how I ended up walking into the ████ School.\n> \n> **R:** The ████ School?\n> \n> **M:** Yes. I ended up studying there for about a month before I left to join my cousin Georges in, if I recall...\n> \n> **R:** Annemasse?\n> \n> **M:** That's right.\n> \n> **R:** Why did you stay there only a month?\n> \n> **M:** The style of mime, it wasn't for me. A lot of what the teacher, Mr. Thomas, did was statuary mime, plastic mime. For instance, he would have me stand still for an hour, or try to balance on one hand for as long as I could. I preferred to be in motion, even then, but it gave me time to improve my craft, up until I couldn't stay any longer.\n> \n> **R:** What happened?\n> \n> **M:** One day, this was after I had been there merely a month, I came into the studio and saw Thomas more excited than I'd ever seen. He kept shouting, \"I've done it, I've done it.\" One of his newer students was kneeling on the floor, arms like this. //Marceau extends his arms forward from the shoulder.// As soon as he saw me, he jumped up to greet me, but then...\n> \n> //Marceau grimaces.//\n> \n> **R:** What happened?\n> \n> **M:** I'm not sure. There was an explosion, and suddenly the student was on the floor, screaming, and Mr. Thomas... half of his leg was gone. I knew that the Germans must have been behind it. Perhaps they meant to reach me, perhaps they learned of my location from my brother. I do not know. All I know is that I left Paris shortly after.\n> \n> **R:** Thank you for coming onto the program today, Mr. Marceau.\n> \n> **Closing Message:** Research into the ████ School is ongoing. The Foundation has been unable to locate any records of either Mr. Thomas or his remaining pupils.\n[[include component:colend]]\n\n------------",
