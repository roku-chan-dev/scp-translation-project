It's about our current relationship with the SCP Foundation.

The Command does welcome some Foundation alumni whose... motivation goes beyond the legitimate misunderstandings we have with the Foundation and draws more on... stronger and more controversial opinions. Of course, the RPD Command is not in their image as some people claim, but if we want them to stop claiming it, we should act.

That's it, I'm a little concerned about some of the steps taken recently within the Foundation. Last week, we lost 15 men in a submarine due to an immersion problem. Provoked by you, I'm afraid. I am absolutely not here to accuse you, of course not, and my colleagues take a rather negative view that I have reproaches against you, you are a very respected person, but I would have liked to talk in more detail with you about the way things are going. Since the first schism, our work seems to have some flaws that we... let repeat instead of, well, correcting them. Perhaps out of pride, since it was the same flaws that our, uh, current enemies were blaming us for.// - Dr. Santanis\n\n> //Well, Dr. Santanis, I don't have time to waste on your paranoia. We're thriving more than ever, okay? See: at 4:00 p. m. I have an appointment with [[[scp-4213|a telepath who uses his power to get free ice cream]]]. And at 6:00, I'm taking care of [[[scp-3213|a guy who's being insulted by seals]]]! Our files have never been so numerous or so good. Look at the personnel appraisal ratings! It's our apotheosis!// - Dr. Cletus\n\n> //To be honest, some of us are wondering if... well, if the C-Class personnel still have all their subjectivity. I have nothing against having a little fun, but it's true that the recent topics of study and the methodology adopted are... particular choices.// - Dr. Santanis\n\n> //My poor friend, these people don't know what's good. Vote democracy, yes. These foolish opponents, such as those of RPD - or CCC - or ACD - are enemies of democracy as long as it does not conform to their taste. Do you realize that? They push us to block the votes and the right of members to express themselves by trying to tamper with our system: the further away they are, the better we are. They are terrorists.// - Dr. Cletus\n\n> //What I mean is that... well, funny things, nods, private jokes can be found everywhere, and in abundance. It's easy to produce. At its beginning, our organization stood out because it proposed to deal with serious and mysterious issues, by equally serious and mysterious ways, and it might be clumsy to lose that in the long run. If the majority wants something else, they may simply not belong here.// - Dr. Santanis\n\n> //That is exactly the kind of sectarian comment that I cannot suffer. You sound like those fascists who accuse us of raiding their warehouses when they are the first to do so. No, there is not much in our past that we can be proud of, no matter what those who were there before may say. It is our duty to rework it. To perfect it. And if anti-progressists such as you disagree, go ahead, join a competition that is dying because it does not know how to give people what they want. So take the initiative for a new life.

It concerns our recent break-up with the Foundation. Again.// - Apprentice Brandy\n\n> //We already talked about this at last week's meeting, Brandy. A significant proportion of the Foundation's employees seem to follow the words of some senior officers as gospel. Popularity calls for popularity. I do not reject the editorial shift taken by this noble institution, far from it, but we have made the bet to try the experiment with, say, a different approach.// - Analyst Nassier\n\n> //The fact is that we are struggling to recruit. Those who leave the Foundation mainly join RPD or ACD, which is embarrassing, but the real big problem is that we can't even recruit from outside. We have no visibility. People only know about the SCP Foundation and, because of the SCP Foundation, they don't discover us.// - Apprentice Brandy\n\n> //Well, the SCP Foundation will always monopolize the field, that's the way it is. Whatever their work, they were there first, they took the place, and they will keep the bulk of the attention. Whatever they do. Good or bad. I'm not happy about it any more than that, but we're a vine growing in the shadow of a baobab tree - the question is to give good wine. Do I make myself clear?// - Analyst Nassier\n\n> //I... suppose? Actually, with the staff - all six of us - we had a little chat. We did a very good job here, we are proud of it, and we think it's a shame not to have more visibility...// - Apprentice Brandy\n\n> //That's out of the question.// - Analyst Nassier\n\n> //But I haven't even made a request yet!// - Apprentice Brandy\n\n> //You want to go beg our former employers to take you back. After having claimed our independence in full force and shouted for it. Because pride in quality work is not enough for you, you want it to be displayed between two studies of sh... Sorry for this reaction. But rest assured that this would be a big step backwards.// - Analyst Nassier\n\n> //Nassier, we're proposing an alternative that no one else has asked for. Those who don't like what has become of SCP go to RPD, or focus on their old work. Either we go back there and raise the level in our own way, even if it means being hidden behind work of.... variable quality but extremely valued, or we make radical changes here to propose something radically different from what they do. We have no choice.// - Apprentice Brandy\n\n> //Brandy, no offense, but I have the impression that your brain is completely rotten from these supply and demand stories. I may be the one who is too idealistic, I don't know, but despite the small size of our company I feel that we are on the right track, and I don't want to change it for considerations like that.
