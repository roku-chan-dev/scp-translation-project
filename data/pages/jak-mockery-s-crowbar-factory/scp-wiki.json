Agent Mockery first came to Foundation attention when he successfully investigated and unveiled an anomalous Person of Interest without Foundation intervention. Foundation operatives embedded in the local police force later met with Agent Urquhart and offered him a position as a field agent within the Foundation; a position that he accepted after lengthy consideration. \n\nAgent Urquhart specialises in homicide investigation and undercover field work. He joined Mobile Task Force Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\") after temporary MTF duty, and has since received various covert assignments.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab A Note from the Author]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=Jak5.jpg|\n    caption=An idiot and his lizard. Art by [https://twitter.com/ricebuttsss Ricebuttss.]]]\n\nGreetings and salutations!\n\nMy name is Jak.\n\nI joined the SCP Foundation website circa 2016 as a means to get my creative juices flowing and to share my passion for literature with the online community. I was a young lil fella of 13 years of age, and nowhere near ready to publish works on the site. With such intelligent creatures as \"cow that could teleport\", and \"Bionicle that kills people\", it was a wonder I wasn't banned altogether. Still, I remained, reading and learning all I could so I could improve as an author. And I returned in 2020, ready to crack my knuckles and get into some writing. \n\nMy interest in writing stems from when I first read the novel \"Skulduggery Pleasant\" by Derek Landy, and I desired to write characters of my own in a similar fashion to the skeleton detective. Nowadays, I study majors in English and Screen Studies at university to strengthen my skills, with the SCP Foundation work I do greatly assisting me in maintaining my skill and keeping my fingers busy. \n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy acting on stage and with my voice, creative writing, Discord chatting, playing videogames, and Lipton Peach Ice Tea consumption.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Works]]\n\n[[include component:author-page order=created_at]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Commentary]]\n\n+ SCPs\n\n> **[[[SCP-5048]]] - The Bridge of Gaia.** 30/07/2020 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nEjn63QGL-s ♬]] \n> \n> My first successful SCP Article (successful in the sense that it wasn't bombed into the ground with downvotes). I'm not particulalry proud of it, and I may rewrite it someday, but for now, it's a fresh reminder of how far I've come as a writer. I took a long break after posting it to finish highschool and not die, so there's a big gap between this and the articles that follow it, both in time and quality.\n\n> **[[[SCP-5478]]] - Markhaven, Indiana.** 07/01/2022 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0nnYVZ1L6Q ♬]] \n> \n> The group effort of my team in the Canon Renaissance Contest, for the \"Coldest War\" canon. We decided it didn't fit, and retired the piece to touch it up. While we never got back together and gave it a proper look, I gave it some tuning over my year of dormancy, and decided to repost it myself, without wasting all the hard work that had been put into it. I was responsible for a bit of the worldbuilding, a good chunk of the writing, and the sound design. This is the first SCP article to have my voice acting in it, as well as featuring my friend's, and even my goddamn mother. It was a wild time. \n> \n> I was super proud of my team's efforts, even if we didn't win, and I hope this article attracts more authors to write about Markhaven, given the potential it has as a setting. I know I personally have a few Markhaven projects shelved for later. Markhaven lives!\n\n> **[[[SCP-5654]]] - One More Battle Before the Curtain Call.** 29/01/2022 [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltke6iuerTA ♬]] \n> \n> A deeply personal article about my experience with my grandmother, who suffered from dementia for roughly a decade before she passed. I was attracted to the idea following a chance viewing of Florian Zeller's //The Father// (2021), and after listening to The Caretaker's album \"Everywhere at the End of Time\" (2016-2019). Though, instead of echoing sentiments similar to those present within the aforementioned pieces, I decided it would be better to instead go for a more positive tone, and try and bring some levity to the conversation being had, like I did for my dear old granny every time a tapped the keys on that piano.  \n> \n> Give it a read. You might get something out of it.\n\n+ Tales\n\n//... crickets...//\n\n+ Other\n\n//... crickets...//\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Final Remarks]]\n\nFor the future, I have a lot more articles and tales on the backburner. I am also looking to commence work on an SCP Reading series, after some encouragement by some friends in the community, which will aim to cover works that haven't been featured prominently, perhaps including tales if I want to be merciful on myself.\n\nAnd that's about it from me, I'm afraid. I really do hope you enjoy most of the strange things I write about, because I absolutely adore the process of writing them. I'm always aiming to improve, so do not hesitate to let me know if my articles need some work, because I'll happily hear you out. \n\nAnd hey, we all have bad days. If you ever need someone, do not hesitate to reach out to me, for any reason. I'm very good at listening.\n\nCheers all. Take care!\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
