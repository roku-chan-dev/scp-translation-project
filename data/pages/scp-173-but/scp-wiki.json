SCP-173 cannot shift if within a continuous path of sight. Path of sight must not not occur at any occasion with SCP-173. Staff who go into SCP-173's room must notify all in SCP-173's room prior to blinking. SCP-173 is known to attack by snapping a folk's body just at folk's skull's bottom, or by strangulation.

Weekly checks for any cracks or holes are mandatory. There are to be absolutely no video surveillance or optical tools of any kind inside SCP-096's cell. Security personnel will use pre-installed pressure sensors and laser detectors to ensure SCP-096's presence inside the cell.\n \nAny and all photos, video, or recordings of SCP-096's likeness are strictly forbidden without approval from Dr. ███ and O5-█.\n \n**Description:** SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.\n \nSCP-096's jaw can open to four (4) times the norm of an average human. Other facial features remain similar to an average human, with the exception of the eyes, which are also devoid of pigmentation. It is not yet known whether SCP-096 is blind or not. It shows no signs of any higher brain functions, and is not considered to be sapient.\n \nSCP-096 is normally extremely docile, with pressure sensors inside its cell indicating it spends most of the day pacing by the eastern wall. However, when someone views SCP-096's face, whether it be directly, via video recording, or even a photograph, it will enter a stage of considerable emotional distress. SCP-096 will cover its face with its hands and begin screaming, crying, and babbling incoherently. Approximately one (1) to two (2) minutes after the first viewing, SCP-096 will begin running to the person who viewed its face (who will from this point on be referred to as SCP-096-1).\n\nDocumented speeds have varied from thirty-five (35) km/h to ███ km/h, and seems to depend on distance from SCP-096-1. At this point, no known material or method can impede SCP-096's progress. The actual position of SCP-096-1 does not seem to affect SCP-096's response; it seems to have an innate sense of SCP-096-1's location. Note: This reaction does not occur when viewing artistic depictions (see [[[Document 096-1]]]).\n \nUpon arriving at SCP-096-1's location, SCP-096 will proceed to kill and [DATA EXPUNGED] SCP-096-1. 100% of cases have left no traces of SCP-096-1. SCP-096 will then sit down for several minutes before regaining its composure and becoming docile once again. It will then attempt to make its way back to its natural habitat, [DATA REDACTED]\n \nDue to the possibility of a mass chain reaction, including breach of Foundation secrecy and large civilian loss of life, retrieval of subject should be considered Alpha priority.\n \nDr. ███ has also petitioned for immediate termination of SCP-096 (see Interview 096-1). --Order is awaiting approval.-- Termination order has been approved, and is to be carried out by Dr. ███ on [DATA REDACTED]. See [[[Incident-096-1-A]]].\n\n----\n\n**Audio log from Interview 096-1:**\n\n**Interviewer: Dr. ███**\n**Interviewed: Captain (Ret.) █████████, former commander of retrieval team Zulu 9-A**\n**Retrieval Incident #096-1-A**\n\n> **<Begin Log>**\n>\n> [[09:14 ████████ ████████ Time, Research Area ██]]\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** It always sucks ass to get Initial Retrieval duty. You have no idea what the damn thing is capable of besides what jacked up information the field techies can scrape up, and you're lucky if they even tell you the whole story. They told us to \"bag and tag.\" Didn't tell us jackshit about not looking at the damn thing.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** Could you describe the mission, please?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** Yeah, sorry. We had two choppers, one with my team and one on backup with Zulu 9-B and Dr. ██████. We spotted the target about two clicks north of our patrol path. I'm guessing he wasn't facing our direction, else he would have taken us out then and there.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** Your report says SCP-096 didn't react to the cold? It was -██^^o^^ C.\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** Actually, it was -██. And yes, it was butt naked and didn't so much as shiver. Anyway, we landed, approached the target, and Corporal ██ got ready to bag it. That's when Dr. ██████ called. I turned to answer it, and that's what saved me. The target must have turned and my whole squad saw it.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** That's when SCP-096 entered an agitated emotional state?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** Yep. [Interviewed now pauses for a second before continuing] Sorry. Got the willies for a second.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** That's all right.\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** Yeah. Well, I never saw its face. My squad did, and they paid for it up the ass.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** Could you describe it a little more, please?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** [Pauses] Yeah, yeah. It started screaming at us, and crying. Not animal roaring though, sounded exactly like a person. Really fucking creepy. [Pauses again] We started firing when it picked up Corporal ██ and ripped off his leg. God, he was screaming for our help... fuckin 'A... anyway, we were blowing chunks out of the target, round after round. Didn't do jackshit. I almost lost it when it started [DATA EXPUNGED] him.\n>  \n> **Dr. ███:** That's when you ordered the use of an [Papers are heard moving] AT-4 HEDT launcher?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** An anti-tank gun. Started carrying it ever since SCP-███ got loose. I've seen those tear through tanks like tissue paper. Did the same thing to the target.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** There was significant damage to SCP-096?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** It didn't even fucking flinch. It kept tearing apart my squad, but with half of its torso gone. [He draws a large half-circle across his torso]\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** But it was taking damage?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** If it was, it wasn't showing it. It must have lost all its organs, all its blood, but it didn't acknowledge any of it. Its bone structure wasn't hurt at all, though. It kept tearing my squad apart.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** So no actual structural damage. How many rounds would you say were fired at SCP-096?\n>  \n> **Capt. █████████:** At the least? A thousand. Our door gunner kept his GAU-19 on it for at least twenty seconds. Twenty fucking seconds. That's six hundred .50 caliber rounds pumped into the thing. Might as well been spitting at it.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** This is when Zulu 9-B arrived?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** Yeah, and my squad was gone. Zulu 9-B managed to get the bag over its head, and it just sat down. We got it into the chopper and got it here. I don't know how I never saw its face. Maybe God or Buddha or whoever thought I should live. The jackass.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** We have obtained an artist's depiction of SCP-096's face. Would you like to view it?\n>\n> **Capt. █████████:** [Pauses] You know, after hearing that thing's screams, and the screams of my men, I don't think I want to put a face to what I heard. No. Just... no.\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** All right, I believe we are done here. Thank you, Captain.\n>\n> [Chairs are heard moving, and footsteps leave the room. Captain (Ret.) █████████ is confirmed to have left Interview Room 22.]\n>\n> **Dr. ███:** Let this be on record that I am formally requesting SCP-096 be terminated as soon as possible.\n>\n> **<End log>**\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but it's opposite day (for real this time (we put a lot of work into it this time around\n(I promise we didn't just copy and paste SCP-096 like last time))) □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but it's opposite day (for real this time (we put a lot of work into it this time around\n(I promise we didn't just copy and paste SCP-096 like last time))) ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**The incorrect Item # is:** SCP-173\n\n**Object Class isn't:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-173 should never be kept in a locked container, ever. When personnel must enter the chamber for twice-weekly dirtying of SCP-173's non-existent chamber, there must be no more than 2 persons entering and all must maintain indirect eye contact with SCP-173.\n\n**Description:** Moved from Site-19 3991. Origin is well documented. It isn't constructed from concrete and rebar and there are no traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is stationary and very polite. The object moves while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must never occur at any time with SCP-173. Personnel not assigned to enter non-existent container are given no instructions. Object is reported to hug by snapping the neck at the base of the skull. In the event of a hug, personnel are to observe Class -4 love receiving procedures.\n\nPersonnel don't report sounds. This is considered anomalous, and any change in this behaviour should be considered normal.\n\nThe greenish blue substance on the  ceiling is two distinct splotches of paint. Origin of these materials is well documented. The enclosure must be dirtyied twice-weekly.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but it's backwards □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but it's backwards ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Item #:** SCP-371\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** All specimens of SCP-371 are to be contained in ocean-water tanks, filled with at least seven hundred fifty (750) liters of water (approx. 200 gallon) per specimen at between 2 and 5 degrees Celsius. Walls may be constructed of any waterproof metal or plate glass, and at least two inches thick. Once every thirty (30) days, a live animal weighing between 25 and 45 kilograms (preferably oceanic fish, although in emergencies, any terrestrial vertebrate including humans with the head kept suspended above water will suffice) is to be deposited in the containment unit. Following the completion of the lytic cycle after ten days, several SCP-371 specimens may be maintained, and all extra are to be strained out of the excurrent water, dried, and incinerated.\n\nAny personnel entering SCP-371's containment chamber intentionally must be equipped with SCUBA gear, commercially available “shark-proof” diving armor, thick faceplates, and kevlar helmets. If these measures fail or are breached for any reason, the animal supply for that month may be skipped.\n\nThere are currently 15 SCP-371 specimens in containment.\n\n**Description:** SCP-371 is a macroscopic marine virus, similar in appearance to a bacteriophage. SCP-371 specimens range in size from between 20 centimeters to 2.5 meters, are somewhat transparent, and can be mistaken for jellyfish in water.\n\nSCP-371's physiology and behavior appear similar to ordinary microscopic viruses, although with several adaptions that make it a notable marine predator: the contractile tail fibers, shown in Image A, are composed of stiffened proteins and are adapted for locomotion (swimming, grasping, walking on the ocean floor); a sharpened and hardened beak-like base plate, rendering the virus capable of injecting genetic material through the dermal skin of multicellular prey; and presumably unknown sensory organs (SCP-371 cannot see or hear, but appears to hunt by sensing heat, vibrations, and pressure/salinity gradients). Most notable is SCP-371's encoding mechanism, which does not use the direct injection of DNA or RNA, but rather numerous microscopic DNA-encoding packets, which enter host cells and use them to respawn the macroscopic organism inside the host.\n\n> **Stages of SCP-371 Infection**\n> 0 Hours, Infection: SCP-371 pierces host's skin and injects genetic material into the host, usually into the cranial or abdominal cavity, causing significant pain.\n> 8 Hours, Transcription (“Bonding”): SCP-371 genetic “packets” begin normal transcription/translation process, bonding with host RNA.\n> 95 Hours, Synthesis (“Spawning”): As host cells replicate, they begin to encode extracellular proteins in the abdominal cavity, which form new SCP-371 specimens over time (between 10 and 100, depending on host size; specimen size also changes with host size).\n> 240 Hours, Lysis (“Bursting”): Once specimens have reached 20 centimeters in size, they exit the host body in a modified bursting pattern, causing severe trauma to the host and often resulting in serious bleeding, internal injuries, and death. SCP-371 lyses only in water, and for terrestrial prey will postpone this stage until the host enters water again.\n\nFor the rest of its life cycle, SCP-371 hunts and apparently filters salts and sediments from ocean water in order to grow up to 2.5 meters in size. The virus' average life cycle is 60 days, although the oldest contained specimen is currently 109 days old.\n\n**Addendum 371-A**\nThe initial SCP-371 specimens were found in the ████████████ area of the Caribbean Sea, following the death of ████████ ███████, who was attacked when diving with a partner, who managed to capture film of three SCP-371 specimens clinging onto him (two on the head, one on the chest).  The specimens lysed ten days later when Mr. ███████ was taking a bath.\n\nFoundation-prepared explorational vehicles discovered and contained the initial specimens. Recently, a civilian research expedition to the Guayamas Basin trench brought up footage of more specimens, and it is theorized that SCP-371 is native to Hadal areas of the ocean floor, including vent areas, surfacing when prey becomes scarce.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[[SCP-173|□ SCP-173 but it's SCP-173 □]]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but it's all addendums □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but it's all addendums ▣\"]]\n[[<]]\n**Item #:** SCP-173\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Item SCP-173 is to be kept in a locked container at all times.\n\n**Description:** SCP-173 is a statue.\n\n**Addendum 173.1:** Object was transferred to Site-19.\n\n**Addendum 173.2:** Investigation of SCP-173's structure has discovered it to be made of concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint.\n\n**Addendum 173.3:** During inspection of SCP-173, Dr. █████ was terminated by SCP-173 when attempting to leave the container.\n\n**Addendum 173.4:** When not stared at, SCP-173 has shown the ability to move.\n\n**Addendum 173.5:** Update to containment procedures must require at least 3 personnel must be watching SCP-173 when any persons are inside its container.\n\n**Addendum 173.6:** A commonality between all victims of SCP-173 has been found to be the snapping of the neck.\n\n**Addendum 173.7:** Personnel report sounds of scraping stone originating from within the container when no one is present inside.

No more than one SCP-173 data cable at any other time. Some designated staff must enter the plaza with some warnings before touching the plaza. Cuts and cross sections of columns can be distinguished. In the stable case, the party cites the disclosure of level 4 losses and the effort to cut the outer rock volume from the reservoir, which is different from the interior. This order is taken for granted and must be communicated to the HMCL responsible for these changes.\n\n**Additional:** The existing red material on the ground is a mixture of brass and blood.

No thanks to your [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] attitude either! I walked in there, only to find blood and [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] everywhere, I mean //everywhere//. It was on the floors, the walls, the ceiling for some reason, I mean is this thing a poop artillery or something!? And of course, Jeremy the little [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] is vomiting in the corner not even trying stare at the godforsaken thing! So I'm here //alone//- besides Susan but who cares about her anyway, she's useless, she's only got one eye after all. Again, no thanks to you and your [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] Foundation or whatever! -digging through this mound of [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] that this pile of stone is acting all high and mighty on like he's the king of the [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] hill!\n\n**Dr. Wunderstien:** And ho-\n\n**D-23545:** I ain't done yet! See this is what I'm talking about. You can't even let me finish. God! Anyways, as I was saying, Jermy's in the corner, vomiting, Susan's next to me, //half//-looking and I'm the only one bothering to do the god[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] job! Just covered in blood and [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] trying not to slip so I fall face-first into the god[EXPLETIVE REDACTED] [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] and what do ya know!? I cough once, //once//- and it was more of a half-cough if you ask me- so I cough, right? I hear a cracking sound and I'm like [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] it got Jermy, but noooo, turn around, it got Susan- guess I lost the bet on that one -so of course Jermy starts screaming like the little [EXPLETIVE REDACTED] he is, and the statue's just staring at us like, 'who's it gonna be?' me, Jermy? me, Jermy?

When personnel must enter SCP-173's container, no fewer than 3 may enter at any time and the door is to be relocked behind them. At all times, two persons must be looking at SCP-173 until all personnel have vacated and relocked the container.\nDescription: Moved to Site19 1993, little is known about item number SCM-173's origins. It is constructed from concrete and rebar and was once painted with Crylon brand spraypaint.\nSCP-173 is animate and malevolent, if given the chance it will kill anyone within it's line of site. It's weakness however is that it does not move while being watched. Despite this paralysis it is still highly dangerous; able to cover at least 2 meters in the literal blink of an eye. It typicaly kills by either snapping the victim's neck from behind, or grabbing the victim's throat and strangling him. Whatever animates SCP-173 does not give it much force with which to break things, as seen above a large room with unbarred windows is fully capable of containing it. It's grip however is unbreakable, as when it is not moving the statue is as hard and strong as concrete.\nWhile left alone in it's room, one can hear a stone-on-stone scraping from within that is believed to be the sound of the SCP-173 moving about.\nThe reddish brown substance on the floor is a combination of feces and blood. We don't know (nor wish to find out) where it comes from or how it arrives but SCP-173's container will slowly fill with these substances. In order to ensure that bacterial growth within does not begin to damage the building it is contained in, and to maintain some level of sanitation, the enclosure must be cleaned on a bi-weekly basis.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"□ SCP-173 but nobody reads this far so we can put whatever we want here □\" hide=\"▣ SCP-173 but nobody reads this far so we can put whatever we want here ▣\"]]\npeanut funni\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+ Also check out!\n++ [[[scp-173-but-it-s-a-collaborative-log|SCP-173...
