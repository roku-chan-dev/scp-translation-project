Screams could be heard in the distance. Desperate requests for help echoed through the endless chambers. Roars echoed too, deafening as they passed; though they were few and far between.\n\n[http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-239 Siggy] heard none of that, however.\n\nShe was asleep.\n\nSiggy was always asleep, ever since the doctors thought that she needed to sleep.\n\nSiggy was a good girl. When they put her under, she closed her eyes and slept like she was told to.\n\nWhen she drifted off, her room was beautiful and colorful, the normally white walls covered in drawings and posters that she made herself. It was her home, the doctors said, and she thought it was the best home ever.\n\nWhen she woke up, the first thing that Siggy noticed was the darkness.\n\nShe couldn’t see a darn thing, and not even her night light was on. She didn’t see her posters, or the white walls, or her drawings, or any sign of the doctors. It seemed as if the doctors decided to make it night.\n\nSiggy didn’t like the night.\n\n“Lumina.” Siggy whispered, and instantly the tip of her finger glowed with a bright light, enough to illuminate the room.\n\nThere she saw her drawings, her posters, her night light- just as she left it. The doctors didn’t touch a thing.\n\nBut what she noticed right after that was the silence.\n\nThere was always music in Siggy’s home. She wanted it that way. The good doctors said “Why not?” and decided to put a radio in her home, just like she wanted.\n\nThe radio was on the stool next to her bed, and she used her non-lighty hand to touch the on button like she always did.\n\nNo music came out.\n\nAnd all of a sudden, Siggy felt terrified.\n\n“Hello?” She called out, looking around and using her lighty hand to look for anyone that may have been there. “Docs? I’m scared. Can you please turn the lights on?”\n\nNo response. Only the deafening silence answered her.\n\nSiggy moved off her bed, slowly inching towards the mirror that she always used to dress up like a witch. She knew the doctors watched her there. Lana the Doctor said so. Lana was a clever girl, and she trusted her.\n\nShe wished she had the teddy bear Lana gave her now. The doctors took it away right before she went to sleep.\n\nShe knocked on the mirror.\n\n“Hello? Doctors? I’m done with my nap. Can you please turn the lights on?”\n\nShe waited for a few moments. Nothing responded.\n\n“Please? Even if it’s just the night light and the radio. I’ll be a good girl, I promise!”\n\nNothing answered.\n\nShe shined her lighty hand at the mirror to try and see through it, but it did nothing but shine the light back in her eyes.\n\nHer lips were quivering, but she tried to keep them still. She was a brave girl. A very, very brave girl.\n\nHer head turned to the door at the end of her home. The doctors always came through there whenever they had to ask her questions, but when she tried to get out, it was always locked.\n\nShe shook away the memory. The doctors said she was very bad for trying to do that. She didn't want to think about it.\n\nShe hesitated.\n\n//But they weren’t here, were they?//\n\nSiggy inched closer to the door, and stretched out her non-lighty hand to give it a push.\n\nWith a slow //creeeeeeakk//, it opened into a dark dark hall.\n\nShe stepped out, her legs shaking. “Docs? Doctors?”\n\nThe halls echoed her voice, but nothing else answered.\n\nIt was there and then that she realized that she needed to come out. And if she needed to come out, she needed her tools.\n\n“Summonus Hattius.” Siggy whispered to herself, and suddenly a large purple hat landed on the soft tufts of her blonde hair. “Summonus Wandus.” She whispered again, and a wand appeared in her non-lighty hand.\n\n“Okay, here goes.” She muttered to herself, as she continued out into the hall. \"Hello? I’m right here! Please come get me!”\n\nShe took a step.\n\n“I’m scared.” She muttered, incomprehensibly.\n\nSlowly, she walked down the hall, using her lighty-hand to light the way forward. \n\n“Hello?” She said, as she passed the dark cafeteria.\n\n“Hello?” She said, as she walked by the door of the secure lockers.\n\n“Hello?” She said, as she began to emerge into a big hall.\n\nNothing answered. Nothing wanted to.\n\nThe big hall that Siggy entered was too dark for her lighty-hand to shine the way forward, so she muttered another spellword under her breath.\n\n“Lumina Brightenia.”\n\nIn an instant, her lighty-hand grew to shine across the entire room, allowing her to see her way through.\n\nAnd what she saw scared her more than anything else in the whole world.\n\nDoctors were laying in pools of their own blood. Black splotches dotted the floor. Grown-ups in black and shining armor were in pieces all across the room, like they were dolls that something had torn apart.\n\nShe froze. She felt her heart beating quickly, faster than anything she'd experienced before. She felt something painful rise up in her throat, but she forced it down.\n\n\"H-h-hello?\" She said. Her voice was quivering. She wanted to run.\n\nBut she was a brave girl.\n\n\"A-anyone there?\"\n\nThen, in the far distance, something big and black and with a shiny head and one black glass eye turned to look at her.\n\n\"I am.\" Said the voice, light and sinister. \"Boo!\"\n\nSiggy screamed with all her might and ran away, as fast as her legs can take her.\n\nShe ran past the secure lockers and the cafeteria and a million other rooms until she came to the room that was her home. She rushed in and slammed the creaky door behind her, leaping in to her bed and pulling the covers over her head.\n\nSiggy realized she had lost her hat as she ran, and her wand was broken into two as she held it in her hand. She didn’t care. She just wanted the doctors to come back and make everything normal and safe and happy again.\n\nWas she a bad girl? Did the doctors decide to leave her behind so that the big monster with the one black eye can eat her? She was a good girl, why would they do that? Why?\n\nThen she heard heavy steps down the hall, and suddenly all her thoughts went silent.\n\nShe held her breath.\nShe stopped shaking.\nShe waited.\n\n\nThe door opened.\n\n\n//Creeeeeeaaaaaaak,// it said.\n\n\nSiggy’s heart was beating fast.\n\n\n//Please don’t come here.// She thought. //Please don’t eat me.//\n\nTears were running down Siggy’s face. She didn’t want to die. She didn’t want to die. None of her spells could save her and she didn’t want to die.\n\nThen she felt a heavy hand touch the blanket over her face.\n\nAnd in an instant, the covers were thrown off her and the dead eyes of a bloody doctor with maggots crawling out of his skin looked at her.\n\n“BOO!” The corpse shouted, and Siggy screamed louder than she had ever screamed before.\n\nAn idea came to her head in that instant, and she chanted with all her might “LUMINA BRIGHTIA!”\n\nA brilliant flash lit up the room, staggering the corpse, and Siggy took the choice to run.\n\nBut a large thing blocked the door, stopping her from escaping.\n\n“Hey, woah kid, calm down.” A kind voice said in front of her.\n\nSiggy ran the other way, back to her bed.\n\n\"Did I scare you really bad? I'm sorry.\" A moment of hesitation followed. \"I'm friendly, really. Don't you worry.\"\n\nHe sighed.\n\n“Hey kid. Can you open your eyes?”\n\n\"No!\" Siggy said, tears running down her cheeks. \"You'll eat me if I do!\"\n\n\"Eatcha? No, silly. I just wanted to scare ya! Open your eyes, you'll see.\"\n\nSiggy stayed silent for a moment, then opened one eye.\n\n\"Lumina smallia.\" She whispered, and again her finger brightened.\n\nIn front of her was a [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-2006 seven foot tall monkey] with a metal helmet, adorned, strangely, with two long antennae and a large, black and circular glass obscuring its face from view.\n\nIt was the monster she found in the big hall.\n\nSiggy screamed.\n\nInstantly the monkey put its arms out in an ineffective attempt at trying to calm her down. “I’m not gonna eat you, for fuck’s sake, don’t worry. I just wanted to scare you a bit, come on.”\n\nSiggy looked back at him with wide eyes. “You just wanted to scare… me?”\n\nThe monkey put its hairy arms on either side of his waist. “Yeah. I’m a scary guy, ain’t I?”\n\n“…Yeah.”\n\n“That’s what I do best, the docs told me.”\n\nAt the mention of doctors, Siggy’s face instantly perked up. “The doctors told you?”\n\nThe monkey scratched his head. “Well, I don’t call them doctors, really, but the docs, yeah.”\n\nSiggy scooted a few inches away, and placed her knees up to her chest as she sat. “Did… did you see the doctors? I need to tell one of them something.”\n\n“The docs?” He scratched his head. “Only the dead ones. Just got out of my cell a few months ago, see. Wasn’t around to see what went down ‘round here.”\n\n“What… went down?” Siggy said the words like they were foreign- which to her, they were.\n\n“Yeah, like, what happened. Something killed ‘em.” He looked at her, then put his arms up, moving his fingers in an effort to scare her. “Probably still arouuuuund-“\n\nSiggy screamed.\n\nThe monkey’s hands went down immediately. “Okay! We’re not doing that anymore.” He looked down at her intently. “Adults are nice to scare and all, but kids… kids scream too much apparently.”\n\nIt was at that point when he realized that she was crying.\n\n“And… and they cry. Shit. I’m sorry.”\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nAn hour later, the monkey and Siggy sat on the bed of the home, three feet away from each other.\n\nSiggy was practically attached to the wall, knees hiked up to her chest, tear trails evident down her cheeks.\n\nThe monkey had his hands both placed properly on his lap, as he looked away from the girl right beside him.\n\nIt was at that point that he realized that this was what the docs meant by “awkward”.\n\nHe attempted to break the ice. “So uh… what’s your name?”\n\nThe girl looked back at him, silently.\n\nHe nodded back. “Okay!”\n\nHe sighed. “…Okay.”\n\n“Uh… docs raised you huh? Same as me?”\n\nShe nodded again.\n\n“Can’t you speak? You spoke earlier dintcha?”\n\nShe nodded.\n\n“Agh for fuck’s sake, I can’t be the only one talking in this fucking room.”\n\nSilence reigned.\n\nThen, she finally spoke. It was a whisper, barely audible, but he could hear it.\n\n“Lana said good girls shouldn’t cuss.”\n\n“C-cuss? What’s a cuss?”\n\nSiggy looked at him with those wide green eyes, and put her lips up to her teeth. “Like the fffffff- word.” Then she put her tongue up to the roof of her mouth. “And the shhhh-“\n\n“Ah, fuck! And shit!”\n\nSiggy’s voice went up by several magnitudes of volume. “Don’t cuss!”\n\nThe monkey put both his hands up in a conciliatory gesture. “Right! Right, sorry. I... don’t know your uh... things, much.”\n\nSilence reigned again.\n\n“How’d you look like that?” Siggy said.\n\nThe monkey looked back at her, puzzled. “Hmm? Looked like what?”\n\n“Like the dead doctor.”\n\n“Ah, the dead fucking doctor g-“\n\nShe shot him a dirty look.\n\nHe raised a pointer finger, then immediately lowered it. “Ah. Sorry.”\n\nHe drew his legs up to the surface of the bed. “Well, it’s my job to scare people. Woke up once in the cell the docs put me in, and it’s been my calling ever since.”\n\n“But how can you do… that? The shape-changing thing?”\n\n“I can just do it. I can be anything-“ His face turned back into the rotting corpse. “See?”\n\nSiggy’s eyes widened.\n\nHe turned back, and sighed.\n\n“I… see you didn’t like that.”\n\nSiggy shook her head.\n\n“Well uh… that’s enough for me! How ‘boutcha? You have that wand in your hands, you dropped that wizard hat, and you just about near blinded me with them words of yours.” He leaned in. “You a witch or some’in?”\n\nShe nodded. “Something like that. The doctors said I could cast whatever spells I want, and they’d teach me the words to do it.”\n\nThe monkey leaned in further, interested. “Wait one fu… second. You’re an actually real, I-swear-ta-Gahd witch?”\n\nSiggy brought up her broken wand, then she muttered a word. “Fixiomimus.”\n\nWith a growing green glow, the wand knotted itself together. Its two broken halves rose, then the place where it snapped started to mend and bond like nothing ever happened.\n\nThe monkey crossed his arms. “Gahddayum. That’s some impressive sh- tuff.”\n\nSiggy smiled, her eyes glowing with a genuinely happy light.\n\nThe monkey smiled behind his helmet. “Yeah, that’s the spirit. Ya got a good smile, witch girl. Keep smiling, it’s kinda nice to see.”\n\nShe smiled even wider. “You know, for a monster, you’re kinda nice.”\n\nHe crossed his arms even tighter. “That’s nice, little girl. Thanks.”\n\nHe cleared his throat. “Anyhoo, I’ve been trying to find a way outta here for the past few months. Hadn’t had any fahki… hadn’t had any luck.”\n\nSiggy’s eyes lit up. “What did you see? Did you see any doctors?”\n\nHe shook his head. “Nah. Only dead ones.”\n\n“How about Lana?”\n\nHe cocked his head to one side. “Lana?”\n\nSiggy bit her lip at his reply, then spoke again.\n\n“And monsters?”\n\n“Lots of ‘em. They couldn’t see me, though. I know when I’m not wanted with those kinda folk.”\n\nSiggy took a few seconds to digest the information, before speaking again. “Why… why do you want to get out?”\n\nThe monkey laughed. “Because it’s sh… crappy in here, that’s why! Full of dead folk and angry monsters. Not the best place to be in, I’d say.”\n\nHe shot her a look. “You wanna come with me?”\n\n“C-come with you?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n\n“Where?”\n\n“Outta here. Outta this little hellhole.”\n\nSiggy bowed her head.\n\nA few moments passed.\n\n“You’ll keep me safe? From the monsters?”\n\n“Yeah, ‘course. It’s gonna be you and me against this entire basement full of horrors.”\n\n\"And you won't scare me anymore?\"\n\n\"I swear.\" He smiled from behind his helmet. “’Cause we’re friends, right? Best friends?”\n\nSiggy nodded, and smiled. “Best friends. Yeah.”\n\nThe monkey stood up, walked to the door, looked both ways, and looked back at Siggy. “It’s clear.”\n\n“You can see in the dark?”\n\n“Yeah, part o’ my powers, you see.” He smiled again, and beckoned. “Come ‘ere.”\n\n“Wait.” She said, before muttering something to herself. A moment later, a bright source of light emanated from her pointer finger.\n\nShe turned to her right and took the radio right off the stool, tucking it deep within her clothes.\n\nSiggy then shuffled off the bed and slowly walked towards the monkey, a smile on her face.\n\nThe monkey looked at her. “Ah, by the way, before we go,” He knelt down to place his head at her level. “What’s yer name, witch girl?”\n\nShe took a step closer. “Siggy. Siggy Ste… stefanssdahttur…”\n\n“Heh, alright Siggy Stefanssdat'r. My name’s…”\n\nHe stopped for a moment, his head paused in thought.\n\nSiggy tilted her head forward in a gesture for him to proceed. “You don’t have a name.”\n\nThe monkey felt himself go red underneath the helmet. “…Nah.”\n\n“I’ll give you a name instead!” Siggy put her pointer underneath her chin for a moment as she thought, then jumped in excitement.\n\n“RoboMonkey!”\n\nThe monkey snorted. “Ro… RoboMonkey?”\n\n“Yeah. ‘Cause you kinda look like a robot under that helmet. And you’re a monkey.”\n\nThe monkey laughed hard, his bellowing laughter echoing down the cold and empty halls. “I kinda like it, witch girl. RoboMonkey it is.”\n\nHe looked to his left, and found something on the floor.\n\n\"What is it?\" Siggy said, inquisitive.\n\nRobo stooped over, taking something from the ground, and then raising it over Siggy's head.\n\nIn that moment, Siggy felt something soft and familiar land on her hair. It was her witch hat. The witch hat that she thought she lost.\n\n\"I thought I lost this.\" She smiled, looking up. \"Thank you. \"\n\n\"No problem, kid. Think of it as something in return for the name.\"\n\nHe put his large hand around hers. Siggy’s hand practically disappeared under the fur and muscle.\n\n“Now let’s go on an adventure right outta here.”\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n--------------\n[[=]]\n\nThe Adventures of Siggy and RoboMonkey\nArc 1: A Rude Awakening\n\n<< Siggy and The Time All the Lights Went Dark Forever | [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/siggy-and-robomonkey-and-the-beast-that-screams When We Start to Hear Creepy Voices of Probably Dead People] >>\n\n<< [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ekronak-s-archive-with-commentary More from this author] >>\n\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
