I get treated like I did something wrong or should have been better when I couldn’t have been any other way. When I get treated like a foolish little girl for being my authentic self it hurts my estimation of myself as a person. \n> \n> When I make a mistake and in response the other person immediately shuts down and/or becomes angry and bitter then I feel invalidated. The silent treatment hurts even more so. I want to know why I did wrong. It’s not on purpose. I want to do the right thing and sometimes big feelings lead to big mistakes. All I ask is that communication and empathy not be withdrawn in a seemingly punitive fashion when I do. Blaming and shaming me for things, even things that are my fault, is counter-productive. I know I’m at fault and feel overwhelming anxiety at the prospect of future punishment. Making that point acute is basically saying that I need to go sit in the corner so the actual adults can handle it.\n> \n> Repeatedly reminding me of my inadequacy and all the things I’ve failed to do in the past makes it more difficult for me to do things in the future. When you repeatedly point out how I’m failing at the things I’m trying to do and how hard that makes your life, that undermines my confidence. I am really suffering from mental illness which is just as debilitating and just as exhausting as yours. Diminishing my struggle is diminishing yours too. We can understand each other if we accept that each is struggling as much as the other.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\nnote to self\n> Should I be with the family?\n> \n> Do they still call me that?\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n\nscrawl on crumpled paper\n> **Hospital Supplies**\n> --Big Bear-- got thrown out\n> Polaroids of Kitty\n> bottled drink\n> Favorite blanket\n> Change of clothes\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\ntexted\n> I remember what I didn't sense\n> No smiling in pictures of us together\n> never looked in the eye\n> Hearing \"I love you\" in her voice, like her teeth was getting pulled on every syllable.\n \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\ntyped\n> Does she know\n> at night, in the silhouetted light of blinds \n> Marvelous sight, outline of perfection\n> Endless reflections filling a bottomless hole\n> \n> Does she know\n> How her soft breathing keeps me sane\n> When troubled thoughts consume my brain\n> Her unconscious touch simmers my boiling mind\n> \n> If only I'd known\n> What I know now sooner\n> No lonely nights where we lay waned lunar\n> blissfully ignorant together again\n> to move what is to what could have been\n\n\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= ##purple|,,//{{You'll always have,,}} ,,the memories//,,##\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
