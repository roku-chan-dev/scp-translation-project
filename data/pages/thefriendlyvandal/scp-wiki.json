I'm doing this in an attempt to get serious about my writing IRL. To do this, I need to build a portfolio and start fleshing out some of my original stories, and I need to stop writing only for SCP. While I remain as invested in it as I have been, I feel like I can't fully commit myself to taking my original writing seriously. I need to make the jump and force myself to swim.\n\nRoget once told a friend of mine that he wished this site could be a jumping off point for writers as opposed to a permanent fixture in their writing. This place has been a great help for me over the past 7 to 8 years and was very formative in my early stuff, and I'm grateful for the drive it gave me while I had it. It gave me something to reach for, and now I need to reach for other things. \n\nI'll be deleting my non-early-RP SCP posts off my tumblr (of which there are probably hundreds), or at least all my SCP posts from the past year or two. My tumblr URL itself will be changed. I'm keeping all my AO3 stuff up as well as all my articles here on the wiki. I'll also be leaving all my SCP drafts up on my personal Wikidot site, but will be moving to a new Wikidot account under a new URL for my original drafts moving forward. This Wikidot account will not be deleted, but I'll be signing off and trying not to use it anymore unless some seriously wild shit goes down, or for some reason I decide to come back or make edits any time in the future.\n\n--To fully cut myself off, I need to post what I have finished of the project I've been working on for the past year. I'm going to reparent the chapter I have posted to this page instead of the Broken Masquerade hub, and I'm going to delete that page from the hub itself. In the next tab, I'm going to post what I had of that project, back to back. It was not finished, and you'll notice that many parts of it are missing, but I liked where I got with certain aspects of it, especially the chapter //Umbra//. I also really like my OCs, and might put them in some of my off-site stuff going forward.-- \n\n[EDIT AUGUST 30TH 2019: I've been thinking more about this story and I think I'm gonna rework it into something original, because the stuff that's good is like, //really good// by my standards and I really love the core of it. Because of this, I'm taking this copy of it off my author page. It's gonna need some serious work - that's 18k words of SCP content - but you know, you gotta do what you gotta do.]\n\nAs nervous as I am, I'm also feeling excited for what the future could hold for me, and for the budding original projects I have going. I'm optimistic about my future. My main goal is to eventually get something published. If I end up accomplishing that, I might put a note here.\n\nWrite honestly and bravely, everyone!\n-Van\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[/tabview]]\n\n\n\n\n\n= [[image https://scp-ru.wdfiles.com/local--files/list-of-foundation-s-internal-departments/eng.png]]",
