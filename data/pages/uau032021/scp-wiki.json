What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ Underread and Underrated Picks of the Year\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[endless-light|Some Are Born To Endless Light]]] and the Tales of Anomalous Items\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMany consider various SCPs underrated. Others consider tales and GoI-formats underrated. But perhaps the most unrecognized facet of the wiki despite its high status is the [[[Log of Anomalous Items]]]. Quintessential microfiction, the LoAO format demands its contributors to construct an interesting object in about a paragraph's space. Some do better than others, but of course all have potential, including potential for expanded stories.\n\nHere, the [[[ao-hub|Tales of Anomalous Items]]] challenge steps in. By expanding upon the simplest of objects and stories, this challenge allows these glimpses of the supernatural a chance in the limelight.\n\nSometimes the most interesting narratives lie in the most unassuming places.\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Pick an item from the Log of Anomalous Items or its sequels (//this includes the [[[Log of Unexplained Locations]]] and [[[log-of-extranormal-events|Extranormal Events]]]//) and write a tale based off it. Be sure to follow the directions set in the Tales of Anomalous Items hub, linked above.\n* **For artists:** Either create a piece of media based off an anomalous item/extranormal event/unexplained location //or// media based off a pre-existing Tale of Anomalous Items article. Your pick.",
