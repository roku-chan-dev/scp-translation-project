The beautiful product of our flesh and blood.\n\nIt’s easy to smash his skull in with the baseball bat he kept around. And much less noisy than a gun. He’s heavy, and a mixture of blood and brains leaks out of the gaping wound on his skull from the living room down to my art studio.\n\nHe’s still heavy, and still bleeding, as I position him inside the metal frame for my latest masterpiece while waiting for the concrete to be useable. When it is, I get started with smothering his treacherous corpse in the thick, gritty substance. It mixes with his blood and my sweat. Hours, days pass while I repeat the process. Mix, slather, repeat.\n\nIt’s been a week. My studio smells of progress. Of blood. Of cement. Of art being created. The basic shape is done, the head of my masterpiece towering over me. I grab my paint and get to work. Using big strokes of the can, I get the entire thing covered from the top of its head as bulbous as my stomach was when I was carrying a new life, to the feet as large as the traitor’s were. The details take longer than the main part of the job, but when they’re done, I feel like crying. I gaze at my creation, marveling at its beauty. All of which came from my pain and suffering. When nature finally calls, I turn to leave my new baby.\n\nI hear a sound like stones moving against each other.\n\nAnd all goes dark.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
