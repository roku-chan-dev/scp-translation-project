It burnssss!\" The eight-year old Anthony whined as Josephine rubbed the aloe vera ointment into the burned, red skin on his back. \"Grandma, it hurts!\"\n\nShe grunted. \"Well, maybe if you'd have put on some sunscreen, then this wouldn't have happened, hmm?\" \n\n\"But I did!\"\n\n\"Hm. Well, you're lucky I love you a lot...\"\n\n\"Well--\" Anthony winced, feeling the piercing sensation of the gel. \"Thank you...\"\n\nJosephine paused for a moment before chuckling quietly. \"Well, you should know that I'll always be here to take care of you. Just take care of me when I'm an old wrinkleton too, heh!\"\n\nAnthony laughed, a smile breaking through his distressed frown. \"Of course I will, Grandma!\"\n\n------\n\n\"Josephine?\"\n\n\"...\"\n\n\"Josephine? It's time for your medicine.\"\n\nThe ninety-three year old woman looked up, a warm smile spreading across her wrinkled face. \"Ah, Stephanie. I'm so glad I could see you again...\"\n\nThe nurse in front of her stepped closer. \"I'm Nina, remember? Stephanie is your daughter.\"\n\nThe woman clasped her hands together, leaning forward in her chair. \"Oh... I--\" Suddenly, she burst into a violent cough, her lungs heaving. Nina ran over, setting down a cup filled with an assortment of pills, supporting Josephine as she wheezed.\n\nShe panted for a moment, every breath jagged, like repeated jabs to her fragile body. Her breathing slowed, and the nurse kneeled down, checking on her.\n\nTheir eyes met.\n\n\"Stephanie! I didn't know you were coming.\"\n\n------\n\nJosephine sat in her uncomfortable, lumpy bed, the coughing now incessant as she descended into dry-heaving, which echoed throughout the lonely nursing home.\n\nBut, in an instant, it stopped, and she felt... Warm.\n\nShe turned, looking over to the chair beside her. On it sat [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-4999 a solemn man], and-- despite her poor vision-- she recognized him.\n\n\"Anthony.\" A tear trickled down her cheek. \"I thought that you couldn't visit anymore...\"\n\nThe man stayed silent, reaching into the pocket of his grey suit, where he pulled out a pack of cigarettes.\n\nJosephine-- despite the strange flourishing feeling pulling her down like a peaceful heaviness on her body-- found the strength to yell. \"Anthony! You told me you quit those years ago!\"\n\nHe paused, then tucked them back away. Standing, the man looked down at her. \n\n\"I'm so glad you're here--\" The man leaned down, placing a finger on her lips. \n\nShe felt a sudden wave of tranquility, intensifying as she stared into the man's quiet eyes. \n\n\"I... I know,\" she whispered, only hearing her slow, controlled breathing as the man carefully held onto her hand, gripping it tightly. \n\nHer eyes weakened, softly closing. Memories slowly bubbled up into her mind as it dipped further into a gentle aura of serenity.\n\nA chill rang throughout the world as Josephine's soul floated from her lifeless body. The man watched as she danced around him, free from her stiff, limiting vessel. She hugged him, then turned, running off to the afterlife.\n\nThe man stood still for a moment.\n\n _\n _\n\n _\n _\n _\n\n\nHe smiled, then disappeared.\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
