He contacted whatever prison the inmates supposedly went to, but they said the prisoner never arrived.\n> When he checked the prison registry the prisoners were still logged as in the prison, (not as escaped or transported), but supposedly actually in their own cell as well.\n> \n> I get these are prisoners and that death row inmates have this subhuman status, but doesn't it look like the government is disappearing people?

Especially shady they're not taken out of the prison system. This shit's why the prison system sucks in this damn country. I bet most those people being disappeared are just people who said something the govt disagreed with or some shit so they got them on a technicality. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##cyan|**Z3r0-V1rus**## 15/11/2022 (Tue) 14:27:56 #12865494 \n------\n\nDon't know about that. My brother said these are actually terrible people. He's only seen it happen two or three times and he's been doing this for over 10 years though. One guy murdered his wife, girlfriend, and like 4 kids or some shit. \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##magenta|**Em-per-sand**## 15/11/2022 (Tue) 14:30:24 #18938435\n------\nYea that sounds like some government bullshit still. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##lime|**ScrimbleScramble**## 15/11/2022 (Tue) 14:32:14 #19956612\n\nYour bro's probably not giving you the whole story if you see him again ask for other things around it. if he doesn't want to say shit you know you've asked too much.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##cyan|**Z3r0-V1rus**## 15/11/2022 (Tue) 14:33:46 #12865494 \n------\n\nI'll ask him when I see him tomorrow and get back to you with some more details ##lime|ScrimbleScramble##\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##cyan|**Z3r0-V1rus**## 16/11/2022 (Wed) 16:17:42 #12865494 \n------\n\n##lime|ScrimbleScramble## i got some answers. Well somewhat. He has asked his direct superior about it and that person was very secretive about it. Just got told they get orders in from someone on the outside when they 'required' people and that it happened every so often. Got told to just be happy the prisoners are out of their hair. It's really fucked up. The other guy also said he hasn't seen them return ever.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##lime|**ScrimbleScramble**## 16/11/2022 (Wed) 17:02:34 #19956612\n------\nDude, you know you just found something that could be a huge conspiracy right? They're disappearing prisoners and here we are, unable to do shit about it. This is mental you know that right? \n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##cyan|**Z3r0-V1rus**## 16/11/2022 (Wed) 17:05:51 #12865494 \n------\n\nI can make it even worse. My brother said that before the prisoner gets shipped off someone from some vague organisation no one knows anything about comes by to check if they're a \"good fit\". You think they're using them for human experimentation or something? Something like experimental medication?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##lime|**ScrimbleScramble**## 16/11/2022 (Wed) 17:08:58 #19956612\n------\nIf it's government shit it's probably more like weapons testing and probably worse. MK Ultra part two or something if you ask me. You've actually uncovered something dramatic!\n[[/div]]\n\n> ##cyan|**Z3r0-V1rus**## 20/11/2022 (Tue) 17:24:15 #12865494 \n> ------\n> [[size 120%]] UPDATE: My brother works in a state penitentiary and strange things have been happening to some prisoners.[[/size]]\n> ------\n> So I have been getting a lot of questions about my last post and why the thread is closed, so I will just update you all at the same time.

Some fancy suited Vice detective and some normal cops came to tell me because I am one of his main contacts. I hate cops at my door as much as the next person, but they checked out. I had them show me their IDs which for once they willingly did and I didn't see anything wrong with them or the IDs.\n> \n> Sorry to accidentally mislead you all, I truly didn't know this wasn't real either. I have asked staff to lock this thread when I post it because this is only meant to be an update.\n> \n> Stay vigilant fellow watchmen!
