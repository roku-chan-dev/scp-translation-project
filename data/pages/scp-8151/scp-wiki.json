Foundation personnel who witness manifestations of SCP-8151 may __not__, regardless of clearance level, receive amnestic treatment until after the events portrayed either come to pass or are circumvented. Failure to comply with these restrictions will result in mandatory amnestic treatment. \n\n--D-Class assigned to SCP-8151 locations are to be provided adequate provisions as per Document 422341-CA--[[footnote]] 2002 treatise titled \"Document on Human Rights Necessities for Anomalous Deployment.\"[[/footnote]]. Staff assigned to monitor SCP-8151 locations must be given bi-weekly psychiatric evaluations. Any staff obtaining lower than a 50 on the Düren-Henderssohn Psychological Stability Scale[[footnote]]Henderssohn, Frieda and Franz Düren. //On Cognition and the Esoteric//. 1997.[[/footnote]] must be reassigned. \n _\n##blue|The previous procedure is under review by the Ethics Committee.##\n\nPersonnel assigned to official SCP-8151 locations must comply with all Delphi event regulations, including cooperation with the GOC in disseminating only relevant and necessary information to participating world governments. Due to the often time-restrictive nature of SCP-8151, Foundation emergency response teams are to remain on standby 24 hours a day.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8151 is a standard single-hung 24\" x 36\" domestic window. SCP-8151 can manifest in any enclosed, windowless room up to 15 sq meters in size. It will not manifest in rooms that are not of a standard (rectangular or circular) shape. \n\nManifestations of SCP-8151 are labeled as \"Delphi\" events. During Delphi events, SCP-8151 will materialize on a wall within the room, displaying vague, foggy patterns and shapes on the window for approximately five minutes. If a sentient being is not present within that time, the window will de-manifest and the Delphi event will cease. If a sentient being is present, the image outside the window will spontaneously shift to depict a current or near-future tragedy, typically of anomalous origin.[[footnote]]Roughly 60% of Delphi events have shown anomalous activity. The rest are mundane disasters, either natural or manmade.[[/footnote]] Depictions are highly detailed and graphic, often involving catastrophic loss of life and/or severe harm to human persons. \n\nPrior to 2013, the disasters depicted during Delphi events were determined to be roughly 50% ongoing crises with no possibility for Foundation or GOC intervention that could mitigate damage. The implementation of thaumaturgic spatio-temporal focusing rituals, developed by Dr. Tilda Moose, allowed Foundation thaumaturgists to filter out ongoing disasters and only depict future ones. This also allowed for Foundation thaumaturges to specify certain locations where Delphi events were exponentially more likely to occur. There are currently 18 Sites, with Site-34’s Temporal Anomalies wing being the central location, designated for Delphi events under Foundation control.\n\n**Addendum 1 - Preliminary Trial of SCP-8151:**\n\nBefore deployment as a full Thaumiel-Class anomaly, SCP-8151 was set to undergo a series of preliminary testing to determine its efficacy and ease of use. Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were promoted to Senior Researchers and tasked with helping to oversee the trials. They were selected for their naturally very high psychological and cognitive resilience. \n\nParameters for testing were selected to show low potential for loss of life with moderate to severe structural and financial damages. Volunteer D-Class were used as subjects for viewing SCP-8151 during Delphi events.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px; border: 1px solid\"]]\n[[size larger]]**__Test 1:__**[[/size]]\n**Event:** Monsoon flooding on Tioman Island, Malaysia\n**Expected Losses:** 15 dead, 7 missing, $3,000,000 USD\n**Results:** Island and surrounding areas were evacuated fully, protective seawall and storm borders reinforced.

Senior Researchers Meredith Polletta and David Cross were named as Project Co-leads. The following is a record of major disasters predicted by SCP-8151 at Site-34 up to December 31st, 2017.
