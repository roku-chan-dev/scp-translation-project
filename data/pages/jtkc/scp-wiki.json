Welcome to my author page!\n\nI'm JTKC, an author on the SCP wiki. Back in 2018 I found about this cool website and quickly tried to catch up with all the cool stuff on this place. A few years later in 2022, I'm still yet to catch up to all the cool things on the wiki but I wrote my first article and I found this writing thing pretty cool. I essentially started creative writing on this site with little to no training outside but it's a fun experience essentially winging it until I figure it out.\n\nBut y'know a wise man once told me to just fake it till you make it.\n\nAnyways, I hope you enjoy having a look at what I've written :)\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCPs]]\nHi there!\nWelcome to the author page. We hope you enjoy your stay :)\nHere is a quick list of all the articles I've written. This site has started my interest in writing fiction and I hope I can write a lot more in my time here.\n\n----\n**[[[SCP-8404]]] — That One Time The Foundation Attempted To Use SIMULACRUM Technology To Contain A Keter-Class Entity In Another World**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-8404\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was my entry into the 8k contest. For several reasons, this is the article that I'm the most proud of. I think that I've been able to balance the comedic elements of this with the more emotional parts. That and I was able to apply what I've learned about character writing into the little characters I made. The original premise of having someone(originally going to be an alien princess) trapped in a visual novel was something I had for a while but I liked the idea of Echidna which led to the AI gaining sentience. \n\nOutside of the story, there were a lot of the problems with the writing process. I wrote an 8k word draft which was completed 10 days before posting closed but when I got it crit, I realised it was kinda ass. This draft was mostly the same with one key difference: Echidna didn't know who she was until the last moment. Without that, there was hardly any conflict and the article felt a lot more emotionally muted. I essentially rewrote the article in 8 days while moving to a new country for uni. A stressful experience for sure but I'm glad all the effort payed off. This is my third article to breach past +100 and I'm so happy that people are enjoying it this much. \n\nThis is also the first time I got fanart which is incredible. Thank you DianaBerry, Olicus and Sunnyclockwork. You are all amazing. \n\nI also cannot thank CuKnite enough for the art he drew for the article itself. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n**[[[SCP-7522]]] — Jamie Goodworth Mcdonald Sr: Finance Expert, Celestial Construct**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7522\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was my entry for remixcon which I originally didn't want to enter. That was until on the train I got the idea for a remix for SCP-5595 aka Goeff the gumball machine. Despite being a relatively short article, I found this pretty challenging for a couple reasons, the big three I listed on the author post. \n\n1. I had about 12 days until remixcon ends\n2. I have to mimic not just any loud, over the top character, but a very specific loud, over the top character\n3. I have to match fucking Plague's witty character writing and dialogue\n\nI think it worked out very well. I basically read any article where Geoff was featured three times over to get a feel of him. Thanks to Plague giving a couple pointers, I'm very proud of this piece. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n**[[[SCP-7606]]] — The Invincible, Undefeated One**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7606\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis was an almost scrapped idea. It's a simple joke but I didn't know how to execute it at the time so I kept it at 90% done. Fast forward a couple months and I figured that I could add the dialogue to build tension before the bait and switch. Overall a fun one to write and one I did not expect to do as well as it did. Definitely surprised that this is the 2nd SCP I've written to get +100 but I'm not complaining.  \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[[[SCP-7129]]] — Mortem Day Education System**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7129\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThis one had a bit of an embarrassing origin story. Before the 2022 art exchange, I had the idea in my head of the mallet that sent you to hell and worked around from there. At the time I also recently read all of the Undervegas/Site-666 stuff by Rounderhouse which lead to the first draft to feature his characters. I sent it to Rounder to which he essentially said yeah, it doesn't work as an Undervegas article(in retrospect, I agree) but it taught me a lot about my style of writing and actually gave me a deeper appreciation for Rounder's work and Undervegas. In the end, enough people liked it enough as it was and so I removed all mention of Site-666 and made it its own thing(which probably is a telling sign of how //not// Undervegas it was lmao). A fun piece for sure.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[[[SCP-7877]]] — Special Containment Professionals**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7877\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nI wrote this for the 2022 Art Exchange. A lot of pain from the writing process in this one since it was the longest article I wrote at the time. The timeframe for this thing also made December the fastest I've written something if you want to count words per day. A lot of late nights with me having to report to military HQ the next day.\n[[size 0%]]The fucker I was supposed to gift this to also ghosted the contest with his only reason being 'I forgor'. So he's essentially doing no work and getting a free gift, leaving his giftee out to dry and making the pinch hitters do more work. This guy fuckin stinks, if you're gonna enter an event where you have to personally give someone something then make sure you're free before entering and give less problems for everyone. Asshole. [[/size]]\n\nDespite all of this, I'm very proud of this SCP. It's a deviation from what I'm comfortable with(comedy and action) to tell an emotional story and also work with themes. Took a page out of Zyn's book and also tried to put some cute elements and make the reader care about this thing. I think I could have afforded to have Connie and Dr. Lockwood spend more time with each other but time constraints probably made that impossible. Regardless, I'm very fond of this one for trying to explore the relationship between the two characters and working the anomaly itself into the themes.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[[[SCP-6140-J]]] — The Br*tish Empire**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6140-J\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nAh yes this one. For better or worse, this is the most well known SCP I've made thus far and will probably stay that way for a while. And for good reason. Plus, this was the most fun I've had writing anything to date. It started when I was thinking of K-class scenarios and thought 'hehe what about UK-class end of the world scenario'. I shelved that idea for a bit until the Queen of England died which is when I thought was the best time to write a long ass -J making fun of the UK. It definitely paid off and was the first SCP I wrote to break through +100 and reaching high +80s within the first 24 hours, almost making it a total winner. I think the fact that I kept giggling to myself during the writing process was an excellent sign as the little jokes just kept popping up here and there. Once posted, I fucked up the fragments but other than that it was the most surreal experiences with so many of the authors I would call inspirations and so out of my reach telling me how funny it was. It's no understatement that without this article(and I suppose by extension, the death of Queen Elizabeth), I wouldn't have the same drive I have to continue contributing to this cool site and its cool community.\n\nAlso this was the first time I reached out to a big name author (in this case, PlaguePJP) for crit and as a relatively new writer at the time this was so unnecessarily nerve-wracking. Thanks Plague!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[[[SCP-7000-EX]]] — Awesome Points™**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7000-EX\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy first(and probably only) -EX. I wrote this in about a day because I was bummed out about how I spent so long on 7447 and its(at the time) lukewarm reception. It's a pretty obvious metaphor about people obsess over internet points and it's alright, nothing mindblowing in retrospect. Not much else to say.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n**[[[SCP-7447]]] — Alfredo With A Side of Quantum Entanglement**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-7447\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy entry into 7Kcon and my second creative writing project. Considering my level of skill at the time, I think I did alright and many people have told me how much they enjoyed it (Thank you Sidd in particular). However, I think I was probably balancing way too many complicated elements at the time for it to reach it's full potential. It has a romance arc, a balance of serious tone and comedic tone, an Admonition parody with hard clinical psudo-science bs. I think I balanced some of those elements alright but not as well as it could have and the fact that this and the eventual winner of 7K was also about a guy with comically bad luck didn't help my case haha. Out of all the early articles I've written, this one is probably the one I am most likely to rewrite when I have an idea but I'm grateful that so many people have said how much they like this and the lessons it taught me which lead to me making 6140-J.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[[[SCP-6259]]] — See The Means of Production**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-6259\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy first ever SCP and creative writing project ever. I wrote this during my trip in Thailand and submitted it to the DSCP writerbotfestcon thing(basically a live crit sesh with Tanhony and Darnell). I think for a first ever thing it was pretty ok but as a standalone thing, it's kind of a nothing-burger content wise. I think the idea of how the foundation powers their stuff is interesting but the flat characters, the lack of anything makes this a pretty subpar piece. Still, I like to keep it around as a reminder of the lessons I've learnt so far.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Tales/Other stuff]]\n\n**[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-050-int SCP-50-INT] — Tower of Babble**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"SCP-50-INT\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy first collab with my good friends over on the DSCP server. There were definitely some rough patches especially having to work between 3 different timezones among my co-authors but we (by we I mean mostly Sobek) managed to pull through with a really close 5th place. Definitely had a lot of fun collaborating with these guys.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n**[https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/the-river-cannon The River Cannon]**\n\n[[module ListPages name=\"The-River-Cannon\"]]\n**[##green|+%%rating%%##]**\n[[/module]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Commentary\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nMy first tale and my first thing I wrote on the Wanderer's Library. I first heard about the River Canon from the 19cord reading club and naturally my brain heard River Canon and thought 'hehe what if there was a cannon that shot out rivers'. The rest fell into place but the project went from a short shitpost into an almost 5k word long tale with escalating stakes and having to learn //prose// and //dialogue punctuation// eww. In all seriousness, I found the learning process really fun and I really wanted to try and write a tale anyway so this was really good practice.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab JT's Kool Corner]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= [[size 150%]]**Still don't think my author page is cool?**[[/size]]\n= [[size 150%]]**Don't just take it from me, take a look at all these satisfied customers!**[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; ; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n----\n= \"At the rate this guy is going soon he's gonna become one of the legendary acronym authors, up there with ARD, MAFT and at the very top, myself.\"\n----\n= [[*user LAN_2D]],\n= Local floating cat wizard and some fucker that actually knows how to use 'CSS'\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; ; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n----\n= \"I still dont know if it is JTKC or JKTC.\"\n----\n= [[*user Guaire]],\n= Funny rat who plans to take over the wiki by becoming a mod in every SCP discord server please someone stop him before it's too late please\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; ; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n----\n= \"Imagine Bowser wearing skinny jeans.\"\n----\n= [[*user Crow-Cat]],\n= Psychopath that willingly tags  other people's articles for them(for free)\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; ; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n----\n= \"JTKC got some bangers for sure, read NOW 👁️\"\n----\n= [[*user AnAnomalousWriter]],\n= [https://youtu.be/BhaBZTxNpJs Guy] [https://youtu.be/cV7DhHrWEik who] [[[SCP-7004| Also]]] makes bangers\n\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border:solid 3px #000000; ; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n\n----\n= \"My brother couldn’t find his hoodie so I was helping him look for it.
