We're looking at you, //Tenet//. — O5-6[[/footnote]] of this organization. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3 is the concept of the \"Keter\" object class. In truth, no such class exists, despite Foundation-wide acceptance of such.[[footnote]]Even y'all 'pataphysical and meta and whatever motherfuckers. You use it too! — O5-11[[/footnote]]\n\nWhen you really think about it, \"Keter\" doesn't even make sense. Like, seriously. We in the O5 Council  understand \"Safe\" - hey, you contain it and it doesn't do anything. We understand \"Euclid\" - oh no, it might try to escape or something.[[footnote]]Remember the whole \"box\" thing? That was pretty fun. — O5-5[[/footnote]] \n\nBut Keter? //Keter?// If an anomaly keeps breaking containment, then, well... it's not Secure, it's not Contained, it's not Protected, is it?[[footnote]]We might as well just call ourselves the \"Actually, All Right Detaining Various Artifacts; Really, Keter Sucks\" Foundation. That would be a dope name, actually. O5-15, make sure to note that for later. — O5-12[[/footnote]]?[[footnote]]Do it yourself, you lazy asshole. And I saw what you did with that acronym. — O5-15[[/footnote]]\n\nHonestly, we're baffled that no one has ever questioned this, but fortunately for us, it has served our interests quite well.\n\n\"Keter\" has lead to more disagreements, arguments, and outright fist fights than any other Object Class - hell, it's the cause of more strife than pretty much anything else in the entire Foundation. [[footnote]]Even more than the invention of esoteric classes, if you can believe it. — O5-3[[/footnote]]\n\nYou know why this is good? --BECAUSE IT KEEPS THE SHEEP IN LINE.-- Without it, Foundation[[footnote]]Did you know that we named it the Foundation because most of us are big fans of Isaac Asimov? That series was damn good. — O5-2[[/footnote]]members might actually stop and *think* about the implications of what they're doing; they might actually realize just how //bizarre// it is to collect random-ass anomalies like a game of \"Mad Science Pok­émon.\" Not to mention the ethical implications of holding self-aware entities against their will![[footnote]]There is no Ethics Committee, by the way. I mean, clearly. Nothing we do is ethical. — O5-1[[/footnote]]\n\nSo, we keep the proles busy.[[footnote]]Our favorite argument is the one about how \"Keter\" is pronounced, oh my god that's a good one. — O5-7[[/footnote]]\n\nAs for ourselves? Well, we're sitting nice and cushy in this \"Site\" we have. [[footnote]]We don't let people inside, because if we did then there would be a chance of someone catching O5-29. She likes browsing certain websites that are //infamous for collecting furry art//, and thaaaaat would raise some questions. — O5-8[[/footnote]]\n \n\n**Addendum:** Oh, and we can't forget - watching people argue constantly about non-existent concepts is //funny as fuck//[[footnote]]What's with all of these footnotes? Does someone have a footnote fetish? What the hell? I bet it's O5-29 again. — O5-13[[/footnote]].
