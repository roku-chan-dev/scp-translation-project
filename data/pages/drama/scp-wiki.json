These were the first words you'd exchanged with the man sat opposite you since you first arrived roughly thirteen seconds ago. Between yourself and the man was a lacquered desk – upon which – rested a series of manilla folders. His eyes pore across the folder and you continue observing the man’s tumefied face for any betrayal of cognitive awareness.\n\n‘No,’ the man replies as he hastily reaches for the first folder with grubby fingers. ‘Is he one of yours?’\n\n‘They,’ you reply in turn, slapping his sausage-like appendages away from the folder. ‘And no, they are not.’\n\nThe grotesque man nurses his fingers between cupped hands. His muttered complaints are inaudible beneath the din of halogen bulbs buzzing faintly within the cramped office. Above your heads, a large fan circulates frigid air around the office with a constant whirring and whining. //Whir-whine; whine-whir.//\n\n‘One of mine?’\n\n‘Again, no.’ You smile as you sip at the whiskey provided by the bloated man — it tastes like bitter regrets. The man's glassy, pale eyes blink like some gigantic confused frog. You watch as blood rushes beneath the surface of his flabby face.\n\n‘Then why would I ever be familiar with them!’ He shouts, his fingers briefly curled into grubby fists gripping at the table's lip.  \n\nYou offer an apologetic shrug and your kindest smile. ‘Just thought you might have been is all.’\n\n‘Well then, how might //I// help you with this Thorley? Were they involved in some kind of altercation?’ The odoriferous beast smiles thinly — visibly struggling to conceal his apparent frustration with you.\n\n‘Oh no, nothing like that.’ You reply as a smirk slowly begins to grow across your lips. An inside joke takes seed within your mind and you can't help but stifle a laugh. ‘It's a rather //big// story.’\n\n‘Are you insulting me?’ The large man pauses for a brief moment, before gathering his composure and licking his crusted lips. ‘I feel as though I'm the butt of some cosmic practical joke. Here you are, rudely barging into my office with serious allegations regarding the conduct of an employee who I don't even recognise!\n\nHe pauses again, sipping at his own glass of whiskey and smiling thinly at you. ‘Now, please try and be reasonable with me, whatever did this Alex Thorley do to cause you such grave concerns?’\n\n‘I heard it all started with a burger.’\n\nThe rotund ogre cries out with rage – standing up from his desk with some visible effort – before reaching for the nearest object and sending it flying over your shoulder. The glass figurine of a horse lays shatters upon the carpeted floor behind you.\n\n‘My mistake, it was a bagel.’\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n= //**Act II, Scene 13.**//\n\n= {{**Department of Unreality, interior-exterior-//betweenerior//. — dusk, complacency.**}}\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n//**ALEX THORLEY** continues idly tapping away at the keyboard, their fingers brushing against cheap plastic keys the colour of… beige?//[[footnote]]Beige?
