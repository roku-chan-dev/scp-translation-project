A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-ISMETA) is to monitor online fiction communities for signs of its emergence. When found, an authorized member of the [[[operation-overmeta|Pataphysics Department]]] is to be assigned to deconstruct it. \n\nMTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Freds[!--THIS IS NOT A TYPO, PLEASE LEAVE IT ALONE--]\") is to investigate any leads regarding possible locations of SCP-3143-A. If found, he is to be apprehended and taken into Foundation custody.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3143 is an intrafictional construct. When active, this construct exhibits the ability to temporarily 'flatten' portions of reality into a script-like narrative. This narrative is derivative of the genre established by North American writers of hard-boiled and noir fiction[[footnote]]Notable examples include Dashiell Hammett's //[[[red-harvest|Red Harvest]]]// (1929) and Raymond Chandler's //[[[the-long-goodbye|The Long Goodbye]]]// (1953).[[/footnote]].\n\nDuring this period, SCP-3143 takes on the role of the main character (a 1930s private detective) hired to solve a case. All entities flattened by its effect become characters within the narrative surrounding it, exhibiting personalities and attributes typical of the genre's style. The narrative will continue until SCP-3143's actions lead to a resolution consistent with the genre; at this point, the narrative will conclude and reality will revert. Events which occurred within the narrative will be projected into reality; however, entities involved in these events will typically have no recollection of what occurred. \n\nSCP-3143 was first noted in 2005 in the [[[scp-3043|aftermath]]] of a containment breach at Site-95. In 2012, the Foundation's Pataphysics Department worked alongside the [[[to-be-noir-not-to-be|Department of Analytics]]] to make contact with and apprehend SCP-3143.\n\nSCP-3143-A is Murphy Lawden, SCP-3143's author. \n\n**Addendum 3143.1:** Interview Logs\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/3143/interviews/001.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n> = **INTERVIEW LOG**\n> ----\n> **DATE:** 2012/02/02\n> **INTERVIEWER:** Dr. Thaum\n> **SUBJECT:** SCP-3143, SCP-3143-A\n> **NOTE:** Dr. Thaddeus Thaum is part of the Pataphysics Department.

His shirt is stained with blood -- some of it might even be his own.}}\n> \n> {{He's got a slug of bourbon in his hand, a slug of lead buried in his chest, and 6 more waiting for the next son of a bitch who comes through that door -- courtesy of his .44.}}\n> \n> {{His name is MURPHY LAW, and if you think his number is up, then you haven't been counting.

That's how we determined who you were.\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** God, I remember that. It was... yeah. I wanted to write, um, write a story, or something, I think? Something like what I read as a little kid? \n> \n> **DR. THAUM:** Somehow, you managed to bring the narrative to life -- literally.

Yes, we've learned quite a bit about him, but he's also learned quite a bit about us. Until we know precisely how his abilities work, further efforts to contain him could be dangerous.
