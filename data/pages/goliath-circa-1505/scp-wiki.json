The action passed on animation to the challenged statue and forced a duel to begin, where //Goliath// was typically the victor due to its aforementioned invulnerability.\n\n**Description:**\n\nThe piece itself is a sculpture modeled after the biblical Goliath, most widely recognized as the character in the story of \"David and Goliath\". The head is kept separate to the body, though not an intentional choice of the artist.\n\nMuch like the original story, //Goliath// was made in rivalry to //David//. Its sculptor, Antoni Barazzi, tasked himself to sculpt the work under two conditions: that it be completed with a difficult to model material and that it be a completed work in one year.[[footnote]]It is of note that the marble statue, //David//, was made by Michelangelo in two years at the age of 26.[[/footnote]] It has been speculated that Barazzi set these restrictions to demonstrate his ability and claim himself as the better artist, one more deserving of having their work displayed on the top of the Florence Cathedral.[[footnote]]It is of note that, while the initial plan was to have the statue of David nested at the top of Florence Cathedral, it weighed nearly six-tons and deemed too heavy. Whether Barazzi was aware of this decision is unknown to the Academy.[[/footnote]]\n\nBarazzi began work on 22 January 1504. In accordance with his restrictions, he chose white granite for his artistic medium. The sculpture had been intended to tower over //David//, being thematically consistent with the original tale. However, the face of //Goliath// had been modeled after Julius Caesar, perhaps a flair of style on Barazzi's part.\n\nA year later, 16 January 1505, he had finished the sculpture, though public reception of the work was mixed regarding its completion. Even now, those that have seen it comment on its unusual proportions and bulky torso.\n\nBarazzi was promptly executed following a streak of vandalism and one instance of indirect murder on 20 February 1505.\n\n**Provenance:**\n\n__16 January 1505:__ //Goliath// is \"completed\" and unveiled in Venice; controversy of this claim arises.\n\n__20 January 1505:__ //Goliath// is sighted wrestling Barazzi's earlier work, //Tita//, a marble statue of a horse. //Goliath// is the victor after crushing its head. It then leaves the exhibition hall.\n\n__29 January 1505:__ //Goliath// traveled to Ferrara, Italy and challenged three marionettes in the middle of a performance. //Goliath// is declared victor after stomping on each one. A civilian is killed by an errant motion of //Goliath//'s javelin.[[footnote]]This account has not been verified as wholly true, as the //Goliath//'s challenged had varied from witness to witness at the time of record. The civilian death, however, remains constant in each retelling.[[/footnote]]\n\n__07 February 1505:__ //Goliath// challenged a bronze lion sculpture in Bologna, Italy, but chose not to immediately destroy it. Instead, //Goliath// struck it across the snout a number of times before mounting it and riding it out of Bologna.\n\n__10 February 1505:__ //Goliath// arrives in Florence atop the lion sculpture. Once within the city, it claims victory after impaling the lion from the mouth to the lower stomach.\n\n__10 February 1505:__ //Goliath// approaches //David// at the entrance of the Piazza della Signoria. It challenges //David//, which becomes animate. Soon after, //David// claims victory by slinging a ball of marble at //Goliath//'s nose, knocking it over. They both become inanimate once //Goliath// has been decapitated by //David//.\n\n__10 February 1505:__ //Goliath// and its head are transported to the Florentine Academy while //David// is set back into place at the entrance of the piazza.\n\n> //Proposal from Tutor A.L., 2019//: The //Goliath// has remained in the basement of the Florentine Academy for five centuries with little display of malice. As such, I believe that it is safe to assume that it will not be wreaking any havoc as long as the head is detached.\n>\n> \n> I am proposing to the Curator that //Goliath// be open for public exhibition beginning this year. The history of the object and its connection with the //David// is of significant merit, one that I firmly believe to be worthy of a proper display.\n>\n> \n> I await your response, Curator.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=RockTeethMothEyes]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Marble portrait of a man\n> **Name:** Marble portrait of a man\n> **Author:** \n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** http://www.metmuseum.org/\n\n> **Filename:** 4ikpcjE.png\n> **Name:** 4ikpcjE.png\n> **Author:** [[*user TSATPWTCOTTTADC]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/goliath-circa-1505\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
