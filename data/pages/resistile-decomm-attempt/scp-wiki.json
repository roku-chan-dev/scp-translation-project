Come and learn![[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\n+ Resistile Decommissioning Attempt\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Pedagon]]\n[[div]]\n\n[[=image lizardthumbsup.png size=\"medium\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ \"We'll definitely get him this time, guys!\"\n[[/=]]\n\nHey everyone! The O5 Council has decided to once again put forth a Decommissioning Attempt on **[[[SCP-682 | Resistile]]]**.\n\nSince the early days of SCP Foundation competitive play, even way back during Series 1, Resistile stood out among the rest as a nearly uncontested threat in the Keter tier. With a slew of appealing characteristics that we will delve into later, you wouldn't be wrong to say that Resistile has been fundamentally altering the status quo of the competitive scene since day one. Where other once prominent threats of Series 1 have fallen out of favor (RIP [[[SCP-173 | Motonut]]]), Resistile has somehow remained a top threat as the years have gone by.\n\nThis overwhelming force did not subside as we moved into Series 8. As such, the O5 Council decided to perform a multifaceted vote on how to handle Resistile moving forward. Results are posted below.\n\n|| || QuickDecomm || Decomm Attempt ||\n|| **Pedagon** || No || Yes ||\n|| **OriTiefling** || Yes || Yes ||\n|| **Torcsandantlers** || Yes || Yes ||\n|| **EstrellaYoshte** || No || Yes ||\n|| **Ralliston** || No || Yes ||\n|| **Rounderhouse** || No || Yes ||\n|| **Naepic** || No || Yes ||\n\nAs you can see, only 2 of the 7 O5 Council members chose to immediately decommission Resistile from the metagame, falling short of the required threshold. As all 7 voted to make a Decommissioning Attempt should a QuickDecomm fail, we have decided to move forward on Resistile's 27th decommissioning attempt since it was initially introduced back in Series 1!\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+Open for relevant competitive breakdown and reasoning\"]]\n\n+ Resistile\n[[div class=\"mon-card\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"sprite\"]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-682/monster8editub9-new.jpg]]\n[[/div]]\n\n||Index #||**682**||\n||Type:||[[span class=\"dread\"]]Dread[[/span]][[span class=\"divine\"]]Divine[[/span]]||\n||Ability:||[# Regenerator]||\n||Tier:||[# Apollyon]||\n\n[[div class=\"stat\"]]\n||HP||[[span style=\"--num: 112\"]]112[[/span]]||\n||Attack||[[span style=\"--num: 120\"]]120[[/span]]||\n||Defense||[[span style=\"--num: 125\"]]125[[/span]]||\n||Sp.

Defense||[[span style=\"--num: 105\"]]105[[/span]]||\n||Speed||[[span style=\"--num: 98\"]]98[[/span]]||\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs I'm certain any competitive SCP player knows, Resistile sports a 112/125/105 bulk in conjunction with stellar defensive typing. It is one of, if not the single best wall in the game. Many a match has been ended simply by Resistile entering the field and sitting still as opponents break themselves upon it. Combined with an amazing ability in Regenerator and reliable recovery in Reconstruct, Resistile is nigh-impossible to punch holes in with anything less than boosted super-effective moves.\n\nThat isn't to say that Resistile is entirely passive, though. Resistile sports a monstrous attack stat of 120, allowing it to rip opponents to shreds should it decide it wants blood. Combined with it's new STAB gained back in Series 7, [[[SCP-6820 | ANTIKILL]]], Resistile can sweep through entire teams with little to no setup.\n\nThis isn't to say Resistile is entirely unstoppable, however. Resistile sports an amazingly exploitable 4x weakness to Humor type attacks, which have become surprisingly common in Series 8 with several standout new offensive Humor type sweepers like [[[SCP-7000 | Willucky]]] entering the scene. That said, the current metagame has proven relatively unfriendly towards Humor types overall. For every notable Humor type there's been a notable Grimdark type to counter it, making it difficult for them to keep up momentum and leaving Resistile relatively unchecked.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nDue to the above, counterplay to Resistile remains limited at best. Resistile once again remains a uniquely polarizing as a strong and consistent presence in the metagame within a tier that is fairly strapped for answers to it. With that said, as is said every single time Resistile has had a Decommissioning Attempt made against it, there is strong and consistent counterplay against it that can and does minimize it as a threat. Resistile is not a one SCP army, and does rely on team support to fill gaps that it can't fill on its own. No Decommissioning Attempt made in the past against Resistile has succeeded, but maybe the 27th time's the charm.\n\nThis thread will be open to discussion for 2 weeks. Following that, there will be another vote by the O5 Council to decide Resistile's fate.\n\n//**RULES:**//\n\n* Don't be a dick\n* Don't shitpost\n* Do not argue because this is your favorite SCP. This should be common sense, but every Decomm Attempt we have there is at least one person vehemently defending the suspect because it's their favorite. Don't.\n* Failure to follow these simple rules may result in your site membership being revoked.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user OriTiefling]]\n[[div]]\nI will be voting to ban Resistile, like I have every Decomm Attempt since attempt #14.\n\nSince Series 1, Resistile has been kept vaguely in check by the equally annoying [[[SCP-963 | Shawright]]]. This would continue to hold true to this day... had the No No List not been removed. Without the List as an option, this is what the Resistile-Shawright matchup looks like:\n\n252+ Atk Resistile ANTIKILL vs. 0 HP / 0 Def Shawright: 176-210 (106.6 - 127.2%) -- guaranteed OHKO\n\nAnd that's a //non-optimal// move. I've been experimenting with [[[SCP-6059 | Botulae]]] as a potential counter, considering it outspeeds Resistile and has some solid offensive options, but...\n\n252+ Atk Resistile Crush Jaw vs. 252 HP / 4 Def Botulae: 268-316 (136 - 160.4%) -- guaranteed OHKO\n\nYou miss a single attack, you're done for. So yeah, ban this thing.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user plaguepjp]]\n[[div]]\nso just dont miss?? i dont see the problem here. skill issue.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply2\"]]\n[[*user pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nAuthor, per the initial post in this thread-\n\n> No shitposting\n\nYour post here is contentless and does not foster productive discussion. Please avoid making similar comments in the future.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Limeyy]]\n[[div]]\nSeriously, just use Pesterbot. Everyone is constantly moaning about how \"OP\" Resistile is, when it's completely stopped dead by a Series 2 SCP LOL.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user ParallelPotatoes]]\n[[div]]\nIm not the best at scp but this is not a fun thing to go agianst\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user gee0765]]\n[[div]]\nmeta deez nut\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply2\"]]\n[[*user Pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nThe above user has been banned for trolling.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Fortanono]]\n[[div]]\n> Seriously, just use Pesterbot\n\nOk but why are we ignoring this?? Pesterbot is and has been the clear cut answer to countering Resistile for like 10 years now. There's a reason we're on attempt #27 here, and that's because there has NEVER BEEN A REASON TO DECOMM RESISTILE. YES it's strong, but that DOESN'T MEAN IT NEEDS TO BE DECOMM'D. Seriously, look at this-\n\n252- SpA Pesterbot Endless Fury vs. 0 HP / 0 SpD Resistile: 232-280 (140.6 - 169.6%) -- guaranteed OHKO\n\nThis thing rips through Resistile like tissue paper. Time to stop pretending Resistile is OP and focus on getting good.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user StrangerSwing]]\n[[div]]\nI respect the perspective of anti-Resistile players, but at the same time I can't support a decomm. Yes, Resistile is strong. Yes, it's flexible, and yes, it's very splashable. I recognize that for a lot of players that's a problem. All that being said, as outlined in the original post, there are plenty of ways to check and counter it. It's so reliant on team support to fill in its weak points that I struggle to see why it needs a full decomm.\n\nAnd to be honest? It's fun. It's just plain fun to use Resistile. That flexibility it has combined with how well it fits on almost any team comp always puts a smile on my face :)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user J Dune]]\n[[div]]\nThere's no way to counter this \"SCP\" without either getting overly complex or allowing it to remain overpowered. Resistile users should die, end of story. Now before you cite series 5, acknowledge that quite a few well respected players thought  [[[SCP-4000 | The Ones in the Woods]]] were still overpowered even //after// the numerous nerfs and still remain a menace to this day. Resistile is the same thing, it needs to leave in its entirety like Shawright did. Get over it. I'm literally so tired of entertaining this farce every few weeks. Decomm the thing and be done with it.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user plaguepjp]]\n[[div]]\nskill issue\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply2\"]]\n[[*user Pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nAuthor, per the initial post in this thread-\n\n> No shitposting\n\nYour post here is contentless and does not foster productive discussion. You have already been warned for this. Further rule violations will result in a ban.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user anactualcrow]]\n[[div]]\nResistile **was** balanced back before the bullshit SCP/Tale split in Series 4. Back in that classic meta before all these CSS setups drawing matches out forever it was fine. Seriously when this meta was just weird creatures it was perfect.\n\nAll this extra new stuff took something totally ok and broke it. Might as well ban it at this point.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user Torcsandantlers]]\n[[div]]\nBan. I'm tired of seeing this thing everywhere, and I'm tired of running a gamble on trying to figure out if it's offensive or defensive. I have two completely different teams designed to counter Resistile and I always seem to predict which one the opponent has wrong.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply\"]]\n[[*user Fishish]]\n[[div]]\nresistile is not broken. there is nothing wrong with (a) an scp being able to wall and sweep & (b) it folds under so many threats its not even funny\n\nim gonna keep it simple here and address resistile's defensive counterplay, which is not only abundant but also **all are viable**.\n\npesterbot- like people said already this thing absolutely rips resistile to pieces\n\n[[[SCP-7005 | neonpeter]]]- this thing absolutely cockblocks resistile. you pair it with a humor type (basic teambuilding strats my dude, its not hard) and your opponent is paralyzed trying to decide if it should click crystal burst or corroshock, and theyll pick the wrong answer every time.\n\n[[[SCP-6000 | sniddies]]]- i find it funny that people talk about this like its some kind of fringe option. rewrite dicks on almost all of resistiles teammate options so hard it isnt even funny\n\n[[[SCP-7073 | misdigander]]]- take a look at [*https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvFZjo5PgG0 this replay] to see what resistile can do to this. resistile is ass LOL\n\ntl;dr resistile is mid at best and once again being overhyped as some unstoppable monster. fuck outta here with that man you guys are soft as fuck\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user AstersQuill]]\n[[div]]\nThe problem is that half of the matchups you mention above devolve into a coin flip. If you tie on speed or Resistile has any buffs in several of these cases, it comes down to pure luck of the draw.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply2\"]]\n[[*user plaguepjp]]\n[[div]]\nHonestly if you can't outplay a coin flip that's your problem. Skill issue.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply3\"]]\n[[*user Pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nThe above user has been banned for trolling.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Zyn]]\n[[div]]\n> resistile is not broken. there is nothing wrong with (a) an scp being able to wall and sweep & (b) it folds under so many threats its not even funny\n\nYou forgot to mention [[[scp-7333|Busiguana]]]. It's a bit underpowered, I've been able to pull off a few surprise sweeps against Resistile teams with it :>\n------\n[[size 75%]]{{Lepidopteran Cup Tournament Master}}[[/size]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user anky swallow]]\n[[div]]\nIt's not the Resistile is broken, it's that everything else is really weak. I mean come on??? Why does this thing get an attack of 120 when [[[SCP-179 | Estrellite]]] only gets 100 on its //special attack//. What about [[[SCP-073 | Markaine]]] too? Dude is sitting with a piddling attack of 90 and a speed of 40.\n\nThe real answer is creating a meta where we buff everything else. (please I just want to use [[[SPC-3008 | Ikeahaj]]] competitively ;-;)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment\"]]\n[[*user AvocadoMilk]]\n[[div]]\nFrankly the damn thing is too overpowered and unpredictable.

I once beat a top ranked player (like top 2%) with a team of SCPs I liked instead of what was meta. I never heard someone scream so loud than when my [[[SCP-6004 | Yurlungurpent]]] crit their Resistile with Divine Punch and killed it.\n\nHe tried to rip me to pieces because I beat him with a Yurlungurpent lol.\n\nAnyway I support keeping Resistile.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user Jak Mockery]]\n[[div]]\n...I'm sorry what? Are you seriously suggesting fucking //Yurlungurpent// as a Resistile counter? Like dude I mean this as kindly as possible but are you an idiot?\n\n252+ Atk Yurlungurpent Divine Punch vs. 0 HP / 4 Def Resistile: 88-108 (53.6 - 65.8%) -- guaranteed 2HKO\n\nAnd that's a //non-wall// set, which means not only will you be outsped before you can even attack, you're going to have your ass handed to you the next time it attacks as it rips you to bits with ANTIKILL.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user SCPLORE]]\n[[div]]\nGreat joke man!\n\n...Oh god you're serious\n\nDude are you an idiot?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user DXL44]]\n[[div]]\nYO THIS MAN IS OUT HERE USING DIVINE PUNCH YURLUNGERPENT LMAO\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user felixou]]\n[[div]]\nImagine thinking that this was an actual argument in favor of keeping it around like :x\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user diour]]\n[[div]]\nMan really thought he was cooking here\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nThread locked.

Aside from the arguments made above, Resistile just isn't all that unhealthy for the metagame. It isn't some ubiquitous monster, it isn't completely unstoppable, it's just another piece on the field. If anything one of its biggest weaknesses is having //too many// tools, it has major four moveslot syndrome. It really wants to do so much more than it actually can, and as a result whatever set you do wind up running you're really going to feel your weak points.\n\nSo yeah. I vote against decomm.\n\n-Sent from my Samsung Smart Fridge\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user pedagon]]\n[[div]]\nSorry, but your account doesn't meet our site age requirement to vote.

I seriously can't believe you all.\n\nLike it's a non discussion. Resistile isn't HURTING anyone!! She's JUST THERE! Minding her own business! So what if she's a little strong? So what if she's a little hard to destroy? That doesn't mean you need to go out of your way to get rid of her!!

This game rewards absolute blind luck and nothing else. I am //beyond// convinced at this point. After getting completely fucked over by my opponent sending out this shitstain excuse for an SCP and watching as it completely dicks on my team, losing somehow feels worse than usual. My prep was superior, my strategy was superior, and I lost regardless, so I don't see a reason to continue engaging in an activity where whatever I have control over is overwhelmingly dominated by that which I do not. It makes me want to give into dark triad traits.\n\nI am done with competitive SCP, and you won't get a fond farewell. You'll get a fond fuck you. This community is infected to its roots with a degenerative disease that grows stronger over time but stops short of killing its host. Anything remotely competitive about this entire scene has been long replaced by our refusal to recognize the tumor that exists at the heart of this community. The environment we fostered has trapped us all in this vicious cycle, and escaping it requires acceptance of the harshest reality we all scramble to explain away, that none of the countless straining efforts we put ourselves through here will ever amount to one single shining glimmer of significance.\n\nOne last thing before I leave you all to react with righteous mockery as you self fellate to your epic \"own\", before you do everything in your power to minimize my words and thoughts like the manchild you are. From this moment on, nothing you say matters to me. No insult you can craft against me will hold power, no toxic vitriol will leave me poisoned. The foulest, most profane insults that you deem to throw my way will simply settle into the dust at my feet. You all chose to let this absolute insulting excuse of an SCP exist in your community, while I chose to walk away filled with joy derived from the fact that I knew when to quit and you didn't.\n\nCowards.

This really //is// like Decomm Attempt #20 huh?\n\nAnyway to recap votes so far, it looks like about 7 in favor of Decomm and 6 actual votes to keep it. I'm going to throw my hat in with the people who want to keep it.\n\nListen a good Resistile at the right time in a match can be absolutely devastating and can be a win condition. I'm not going to argue that it isn't. At the same time, it has a myriad of checks and hard counters that stop it even after it gets rolling. [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-cappi Cappi], for example, completely shuts down even a +4 Resistile with its ability Spongy Body allowing it to just completely ignore all offensive boosts. Just like the ones Fishish mentioned prior, it's completely viable and not even uncommon on teams.\n\nSeriously as long as Cappi itself is around I'm not sure why Resistile decommissioning is ever on the table?\n\n[[=]]\n**USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"comment reply1\"]]\n[[*user floorboards]]\n[[div]]\nSis got banned for being right?

It's basically been 2 weeks at this point and a solid 90% of this thread is absolute nonsense shitposting. The O5 Council met to have another vote on Decommissioning Resistile. Results are below.\n\n|| ||  Decomm ||\n|| **Pedagon** || Yes ||\n|| **OriTiefling** || Yes ||\n|| **Torcsandantlers** || Yes ||\n|| **EstrellaYoshte** || No ||\n|| **Rounderhouse** || No ||\n|| **Naepic** || No ||\n\nAs there was an even 50-50 split due to the loss of Ralliston as a Council member, the vote is decided in favor of Resistile remaining in the tier. I'm sure that will make most of you very happy.\n\nSee you again in 3 weeks when we relitigate this again.
