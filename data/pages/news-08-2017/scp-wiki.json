If you're unsatisfied with the blurb(s) provided for the article(s) you wrote, feel free to change it. Of course, you could just avoid that problem entirely by sending A Random Day a blurb for your article. We may or may not use it (if we can think of something more attention-getting, though we can try to stick with one you give us) but we'd really would just like them in order to make the process easier for making these. This is a community thing, and we want authors to give their blurbs to sell these articles much easier. It reduces the workload we have to do, and helps the news come out that much earlier! \n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[news-07-2017|July 2017]]] | __[[[news-08-2017|August 2017]]]__ | [[[news-09-2017|September 2017]]] »**\n[[/=]]",
