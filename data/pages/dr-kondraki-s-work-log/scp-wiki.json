Any contact with SCP-XXX is to be facilitated by Level 2 personnel equipped with kinetic inhibitors, and protective suits reinforced with [[[SCP-143]]]. If monthly casualties rise above a designated limit, Class D personnel are substituted for normal operating staff. A designated animal specialist is to be housed at Site 19 for containment purposes. By no means should any ammunition constructed of standard Euclidian alloys be introduced to SCP-XXX or its containment(see Addendum XXXb).\n\n**Description:** SCP-XXX appears to be a mass of ammunition of various caliber and composition, which moves under an unknown, autonomous force possessing moderate sentience. This force is not magnetic or gravitational is origin, and seems to be unaffected by most natural forces. Each of the constituent units possesses a practically infinite amount of potential energy, which is not expended by the movement of the mass as a whole. SCP-XXX is capable of taking on various forms through crude imitation. Most commonly, SCP-XXX prefers to take the form of a domestic feline.\n\nUsing the massive potential energy possessed in each constituent unit, SCP-XXX is capable of accelerating its mass in unison. The velocity of each unit of ammunition accelerates differently, despite possessing the same amount of potential energy. Velocities range from 330 m/s to 1,800 m/s, which results in SCP-XXX’s form becoming elongated into a “stream” of ammunition when in full motion. As this is universally hazardous, great care must be paid to keeping SCP-XXX contained.  The rational behind SCP-XXX initiating acceleration is unknown and somewhat random, although acts of aggression towards it almost always trigger the reaction.\n\nWhile composed of a number of types and makes of ammunition, the “core” of SCP-XXX’s mass is composed of several hundred .30 caliber rounds composed of an unknown metal alloy. While the overall mass of SCP-XXX fluxuates, as individual bullets are lost or destroyed, the core has remained unchanged. Scans of SCP-XXX while in containment show that the unknown alloy continuously emitted radiation similar to alpha brain waves.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
