Apparently she used to be dangerous because she was connected to this Pre-Occultation monster thing. The Great Bøyg destroyed the monster thing's knowledge of our dimension.\n\n**Addendum:** Tasted a little too gamey.\n\n------\n\n+++ Loading 319.rtf...\n\n**Item #:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-319 SCP-BIGSTOOPIDMACHINE]\n\n**Object Class:** Weird\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-BIGSTOOPIDMACHINE is kept in this special huge capsule thingy that was being used before the Occultation. None of us know how it works except Her Majesty. The capsule thingy is currently located somewhere at the Northern end of the Pile in Castle Skog. Make sure it's surrounded by large rocks or something so it can't slip.\n\nThere's a little display on the console next to the capsule thingy. If the number in the top display goes any higher than \"0.01000\" or the number in the bottom display goes higher than 0.00100,\" that's when you press the big button the side that calls Her Majesty to stop whatever she's doing and fix it. ONLY Her Majesty can do anything else with it.\n\nI cannot stress this enough: **DO NOT** smack the capsule thingy with a stick, hands, bricks, poop, or anything else. In fact, don't touch it at all. Anyone who touches it will be dragged out into one of the back alleys and have their guts yanked out of their ass with steel hooks and chains.\n\nAgain: Only Her Majesty can fix it. No touch. Anal hooks.\n\n**Description:** SCP-BIGSTOOPIDMACHINE is some kind of big stoopid Pre-Occultation machine made by the humans. There are all these tiny moving parts and they probably make noises. (All staff are advised that none of SCP-BIGSTOOPIDMACHINE's moving parts are shiny or fun to touch.) But here's the thing: if the parts move AT ALL, it'll cause a ZK-0 Event, which is a lot of explanation but it basically amounts to \"nobody gets to bite the humans anymore,\" so **DON'T LET THE PARTS MOVE.** The capsule thingy prevents the parts from moving on their own (I think).\n\nCurrently, there's no understanding as to why the humans made a machine with moving parts if they didn't want anyone to move it. The going hypothesis is that the humans are a bunch of stoopid meat monkeys who would be curled up in the corner sucking their own dicks forever if we weren't in charge.\n\n------\n\n+++ Loading 343.rtf...\n\n**Item #:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-343 SCP-STINKYOLDGUY]\n\n**Object Class:** Uhhh\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** I forgot where we put him, but it's locked a box somewhere at the bottom of the Pile.\n\n**Item #:** SCP-STINKYOLDGUY is a stinky old guy that's a human but also not, kinda.

Attempts to monitor SCP-10889 discreetly are ongoing. \n\nFurther containment procedures will require additional research to determine SCP-10889's capabilities.\n\n**Description:** SCP-10889 is an intangible consciousness occupying[[footnote]] It is not currently known if SCP-10889 is capable of leaving the cave at will. [[/footnote]] a cave in Etnedal, Norway. The only empirical method to detect is presence is through sudden spikes in Hume levels. Hume-anomaly image mapping has not yet been able to determine that SCP-10889 takes any consistent shape or size. \n\nWhen a human subject physically intersects with SCP-10889, they experience a series of visual and auditory hallucinations. While the nature of these hallucinations differ from person to person, there are a few consistent elements:\n\n* The subject is surrounded by complete darkness.\n* The darkness is occasionally interrupted by the irregular appearance of a glowing symbol that has been most often described as \"a crystal wrapped in a worm/ribbon/snake.\" \n* An androgynous human voice, presumably belonging to SCP-10889. Based on tests with D-class personnel, the voice is capable of speech in English, Norwegian, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, German, and Russian, and addresses itself as \"The Great Bøyg.\" The voice most commonly instructs the human subject to \"go around\" to escape the darkness. The meaning of this is unclear.\n\n**Note:** //A monster also called \"The Great Bøyg\" features in Norwegian folklore. In particular, the appearance of such a creature in Henrik Ibsen's play// Peer Gynt //is analogous to the hallucinations experienced by human subjects that spatially intersect with SCP-10889. A notebook was discovered within the cave that belonged to Ibsen, so it's entirely plausible that an encounter with SCP-10889 provided inspiration for the play.// - Dr. Gladstone, Foundation CARR[[footnote]] Cultural-Anomalous Relations Research [[/footnote]] Department \n\n------\n\n+++ Loading amodestproposal.rtf...\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #000000; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\n\nDear Foundation,\n\nWe do not extend the olive branch without considerable trepidation. However, now that [THE THREAT] has made it clear that we're all about to become roommates in the same incinerator, our priorities have been restructured accordingly.\n\nSo, allow us to introduce ourselves: we are Skogslottet, the human friends and servants of all Trolls of the North.\n\nEver since the Third Century AD, our presence has been felt, without once being seen, throughout all aspects of Scandanavian life. Through the blessing of our Lord the Great Bøyg, we were once the only humans who were allowed to freely trade with the Trolls. As the world around our communes sunk irretrievably into latter-day decadence and \"progress,\" our secret prosperity was unmatched.\n\nOur happiness ended when the Cold War began. The radiation of the Sun was already enough to turn a Troll to stone. But a single Soviet nuclear test triggered a collective subconscious breakdown that destroyed all of Trollkind in a fortnight. \n\nBut one hope remains -- in the Great Bøyg, the formless, deathless god of the Trolls.\n\nThe Trolls had many prophecies. Among them: \"After eternal sunlight befalls the tribes of the Dovre, the Great Bøyg will bargain with the Kings of the Last Nation of Men. Thus from the ruptured eyes of forgotten humanity shall come the second genesis beneath the mountain roots.\"\n\n...\n\nYou may be wondering what this has to do with you and [THE THREAT]. \n\nFor one thing, thanks to [THE THREAT], all world governments have been united under the Foundation's banner. By definition, you are the Kings of the Last Nation of Men.\n\nFor another... have you noticed how quiet [THE THREAT] has been since yesterday? \n\nThe Bøyg is not the strongest of gods -- because It doesn't need to be. The Bøyg has never lost a fight, and the Bøyg has never fought. The Bøyg is not invincible, but everyone that could do It harm has forgotten Its existence.\n\nBecause the Bøyg does one thing better than anything else in the omniverse: It steals memories. And the Bøyg has made [THE THREAT] forget about our world.\n\nThis is a demonstration, not a favor. In three days, the memories will be returned, and [THE THREAT]'s assault will begin with renewed rancor.\n\nAs much as we would like to stop [THE THREAT], the Bøyg has needs of Its own. Its mind does not work the way a mortal's does -- there are rules. \"Permission from the Kings of the Last Nation\" may not seem reasonable to the secular world. But when dealing with a god, otherwise arbitrary words and agreements are like a programming language.\n\nIf we work together, we will witness the return of our masters, who will live forever in a world rebuilt for their peace and comfort. We will shed our human flesh and moral crutches, becoming part of Trollkind reborn. And the second generation will be stronger than the first -- sunlight and the sound of church bells will still be nuisances, but no longer shall these things carry a death sentence.\n\nAnd in exchange, your [THREAT] -- and any other such [THREAT]s -- will forget about you. And if the Bøyg's feeling generous -- maybe you, too, will share in the renaissance of the Trolls.\n\n...whatever your ethical hangups may be, it beats the Group Hug, doesn't it?\n\nYou have three days. Think it over.\n\n[[>]]\n- High Minister Aslak, Skogslottet\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n------\n\n+++ Loading voterecord10889.rtf...\n\n> +++ Motion as Follows: Comply with GoI-10889-A's proposal to interfere with [THE THREAT]'s memories.\n> \n> **Yea:** None\n> \n> **Nay:** O5-1, O5-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-6, O5-7, O5-8, O5-10, O5-11\n> \n> **Abstain:** O5-5, O5-9, O5-12\n> \n> **Votes Pending:** None\n> \n> **Result:** Motion failed\n\n> +++ Motion as Follows: Negotiate with GoI-10889-A to more suitable terms.\n> \n> **Yea:** O5-1, O5-3, O5-4, O5-7, O5-9 O5-10\n> \n> **Nay:** O5-2, O5-5, O5-6 \n> \n> **Abstain:** O5-8, O5-11, O5-12\n> \n> **Votes Pending:** None\n> \n> **Result:** Motion passed.\n> \n> **Note:** Negotiations failed.\n\n> +++ Motion as Follows: Negotiate with GoI-10889-A to extend the three-day deadline to return [THE THREAT]'s memories until a decision can be met.\n> \n> **Yea:** O5-1, O5-2, O5-3, O5-4, O5-5, O5-6, O5-7, O5-11\n> \n> **Nay:** O5-8, O5-10\n> \n> **Abstain:** O5-12\n> \n> **Votes Pending:** O5-9[[footnote]]\"My facility's experiencing an power outage.

Knowing our line of work, there's a temptation to reverse-engineer the Lizard's flesh so we could synthesize a metal alloy that's just as hard to destroy as 682. Ideally, the plan was to make our //own// 682 -- a military automaton strong enough to beat back our most dangerous enemies. \n> \n> And after an ungodly amount of prototypes, my former supervisor, Dr. Terry Bosc, managed to come up with an ingot of the first end result that didn't either melt or explode after ten seconds. It was 50% aluminum and 27% titanium, but because not even Level 4 clearance is high enough, I'll say it was 23%... //stuff.//\n> \n> I was one of the new researchers when the project was finished. You would not believe the amount of tears of joy shed that day, especially by Dr. Bosc. He had been struggling with this project since before I was even a glint in my father's eye.\n> \n> Then, ostensibly because Dr. Bosc was very cruel man in a previous life, //that// was when our site was attacked by the Chaos Insurgency. I got to shelter as soon as the alarm went off, but I can't say the same for Dr. Bosc -- he was still trying to gather his data for DBS as he heard gunfire. He went out like Archimedes, telling the Romans \"quit bothering me, I'm working.\"\n> \n> When the smoke cleared, the ingot was still there -- but that's where the miracles ended. Dr. Bosc and most of the workers on the DBS project were dead. The blueprints were either stolen or erased completely. This miracle ingot could never be replaced.\n> \n> What's more, it's not like we could have broken off a piece of the ingot and let it go through mitosis. In layman's terms, if you snap it in two, the larger piece regenerates. The smaller becomes inert hunk of aluminum. Only through a series of complicated alchemical steps could you mold it permanently into anything other than a brick.\n> \n> But with a construct as small as Hammie, that brick was just enough.\n> \n> Perhaps we didn't create the Mechagodzilla version of 682 of our fever dreams.
