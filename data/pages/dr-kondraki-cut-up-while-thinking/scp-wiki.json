There is... sensation. Touch, sight, sound. But each is divorced from comprehension. The chill breath of conditioned air on the body's scalp, the pristine vacuity of the medical chamber, the dull roar of monitoring equipment. You cannot understand it. You reach and reach but it slips through your fingers every time.\n\nAn interval of time passes -- an eon, maybe, or a few minutes.\n\n[[=image dotted-line.png]]\n\nThe body does not rediscover movement so much as it falls into it; a jolt that passes through the chest and shoulders in reaction to a sudden neurochemical bloom. When it tries to move again, something goes strange in that nebulous space between //stimulus// and //response//. The body tries to open its mouth and finds itself wiggling its toes. It tries to raise its arm and the left side of its face goes tense. It tries to turn its head, to close its hands, to throw itself from the bed and watches great streaks of color carousel around the room.\n\nTwitching uncontrollably, the body breathes in, then out. Its heart hums a steady tune. So at least that still works.\n\n[[=image dotted-line.png]]\n\nWords begin to coalesce.\n\nThe words are insubstantial, wispy things, floating along the edges of your cognition like threadbare clouds.
