Previous containment procedures have been removed due to obsolescence.\n\n**Description:**  SCP-7011 is a highly augmented anomalous supercomputer, formally known as the Artificial Local-Intelligence Clairvoyance Engine (ALICE). ALICE was previously located in Site-24, however, underwent an anomalous relocation event upon which its central computational cluster appeared within the borders of Joseph, Oregon (designated Incident 7011.3).\n\nALICE’s initial function was the simple prediction of the future, however, through heavy anomalous enhancement, the supercomputer gained the ability to realise specific desirable future events. In order to do so, ALICE makes micro-reality alterations at a present time, utilising the butterfly effect as a means to amplify these micro-alterations into visible changes in reality. This is possible due to the supercomputer’s primary anomalous ability: Localised Omniscience. Combined with its reality-altering capabilities, this allows the supercomputer to calculate the most desirable outcome for short, medium and long-term periods, which can be chosen and ultimately acted upon by Foundation engineers.\n\nPrior to Incident 7011.3, ALICE had fully completed construction and was in the late stages of testing its secondary anomalous ability: reality alteration. Previously, ALICE had aided the Foundation in the containment of predictable anomalies, the development of advanced military and research technology, and primarily, the creation of long-term predictive models.\n\nAs of 16/05/22, ALICE’s artificial intelligence conscript has displayed hostile behaviour, speculated to be the result of an engineering oversight – the catalyst for Incident 7011.3.\n\nALICE was constructed by request of the O5 Council; the construction of the supercomputer and its surrounding responsibilities was given the name of Project Phaethon, which itself was divided into two stages: ‘Construction and Testing,’ lasting 5 years and ‘Enhancement,’ lasting 2 years before being interrupted by Incident 7011.3\n\nFurther details can be found in ALICE’s Project documentation, Level 5 Classified.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #979797; background:#e0e0e0; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ PROJECT PHAETHON +\" hide=\"- PROJECT PHAETHON -\"]]\n\n**Purpose:** Construct an anomalous supercomputer, significantly increasing Foundation predictive power and ability to compete with advancing anomalous technology.\n\n**Abstract:** In response to emerging threats to the Foundation’s existence, namely the acquisition of omniscient and semi-omniscient entities by hostile or competing groups of interest, the O5 Council has dictated the construction of an anomalous predictive engine necessary to give the Foundation a sufficient technological advantage.\n\n----\n\nThis proposal was initiated almost immediately, with final construction plans being completed on 09/10/2009.\n\nA truncated component list can be seen below:\n\n**Central Computational Cluster:**\n\nThe central computational cluster is where the majority of the supercomputer’s anomalous capabilities will be housed; it will be constructed using a lattice of anomalously resistant structures to prevent it from being affected by thaumaturgical construction procedures and reality-altering events. Among these capabilities will be the computer’s Artificial Intelligence Conscript, which will be trained to process large sums of data and recognise complex patterns.\n\n**Power Distribution Unit and Supply:**\n\nThe supercomputer will require vast amounts of power, and therefore the power supply unit will utilise anomalous self-perpetuating energy systems derived from existing SCP objects. In order to avoid the possibility of meltdown, these systems will be regulated using cooling manifolds, which repurpose the excess energy into the assigned facility’s electrical grid.\n\n**General Computing Systems:**\n\nThe general computing systems will perform 98% of the computer’s calculations and processes and will require the most volume out of all planned components.\n\n**Control Interface:**\n\nThe control interface consists of the Control Display Unit, located within [facility pending] [[footnote]] However, additional CDU’s are planned for construction outside of [facility]. [[/footnote]], and the Active Satellite, used to specify where the engine will be directed. In combination, these components will allow Foundation engineers to control and readily manage the computer’s operations.\n\n----\n\nDue to Project Phaethon’s highly classified nature, the O5 Council assumed full supervision of the supercomputer’s construction, requesting specific features to be emphasised, as seen below:\n\n**##Red|Request,## O5-1:** Full secrecy must be ensured, both during and after construction.\n\n**##Green|Solution:##** Use thaumaturgy to permanently compress the General Computing Systems into a significantly smaller volume, allowing the project to operate on a smaller, less conspicuous scale; inscribe the Central Computational Cluster with cognitohazardous sigils, aimed at denying scrying attempts by hostile entities.\n@@ @@\n**##Red|Request,## O5-5**: The Engine must be able to aid research in various parts of the Foundation and joint research projects outside of general Foundation jurisdiction.\n\n**##Green|Solution:##** Use satellite technology to achieve a global usage sphere.\n@@ @@\n**##Red|Request,## O5-5**: The Engine must be able to be upgraded and moved easily, to ensure maximum flexibility.\n\n**##Green|Solution:##** The computer will be modular. Each component can be separated (to an extent) without hindering efficacy.\n@@ @@\n**##Red|Request,## O5-12**: The Machine must not die.\n\n**##Green|Solution:##** Guarantee constant maintenance and replacement of dysfunctional parts.\n@@ @@\n**##Red|Request,## O5-4:** The Computer must not be reliant on living or humanoid anomalies, as they are unreliable and cannot be controlled as a machine should.\n\n**##Green|Solution:##** Use primarily inert anomalies to power the engine’s functions.\n\n**##Blue|Joint Solution:##** Use formulated Artificial Intelligence Conscript instead of a singular omniscient entity, allowing both immortality and control of processes.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\nAs per the O5’s instructions, these requests were incorporated into the construction of the supercomputer. However, the final request for an Artificial Intelligence Conscript capable of omniscience or semi-omniscience proved exceedingly difficult; all attempts at inducing omniscience through thaumaturgic or other anomalous means resulted in failure.\n\nAccording to modern Foundation metrics, the artificial creation of an omniscient entity is as difficult as the creation of a supercomputer of ALICE’s calibre. In order to circumvent this issue, Foundation engineers attempted to use non-sentient machine learning algorithms to categorise and sort the input data, however, this also resulted in failure, as the algorithms lacked the awareness and intelligence to interpret the input data’s complexity. Since the creation of an omniscient AIC wasn’t possible, the project was suspended until a suitable replacement for the AI conscript could be identified.\n\nSoon after, the Foundation would come into custody of an anomalous child displaying signs of potential omniscience. The first documented interaction is as follows:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #979797; background:#e0e0e0; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ANOMALY INDUCTION INTERVIEW #1 +\" hide=\"- ANOMALY INDUCTION INTERVIEW #1 -\"]]\n\n//Dr. Grant enters the room and pulls up a chair. █████ is sitting on the floor, beside the bed.//\n\n**Dr. Grant:** Good morning.

At the same time, █████ was put under extensive testing procedure to further understand their abilities.\n\nNumerous other human and humanoid anomalies were also admitted into Foundation care by order of the O5 council, who were adamant to finish Project Phaethon as soon as the technology allowed.\n\nA sample interview can be seen below:\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #979797; background:#e0e0e0; padding:10px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[collapsible show=\"+ ANOMALY INDUCTION INTERVIEW #12 +\" hide=\"- ANOMALY INDUCTION INTERVIEW #12 -\"]]\n//Dr. Grant enters the room.

Using micro reality adjustments and long-term predictive models, the predetermined future will no longer simply be observable, but controllable. These drives will be affixed onto the Central Computational Cluster, with space for more if circumstance requires.\n\n\nWith this addition, the second phase of Project Phaethon was initiated: “Enhancement”.\n\nA summary of the following months can be seen below:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nTesting began immediately – the O5s insisted on hastening the enhancement process, as the project was already severely over budget and behind schedule. The first step was to ensure the reality drives worked as designed – they did, on a microscopic scale. We had our AI, and now we had to train it to change the future.\n\nWe started off small: predicting and preventing small containment breaches, altering the weather around key infrastructure, fine-tuning chemical reactions and amnestic development.\n\nNext, prototyping experimental technology, neutralising anomalies utilising Rube Goldberg-esque series of events. The machine had the power to rewrite reality, without the drawbacks of reality bending whiplash.\n\nWe tried experimenting on people. Could we alter their brain chemistry to induce mood changes without killing them in the process? Could ALICE handle the calculations? Yes, it could.\n\nSoon, we moved onto beliefs – inserting ideas into people’s heads. Changing memories. In a lab environment, it worked. The ALICE project had shifted its purpose away from aiding containment; its purpose – unofficially – was aiding //control//.\n\nIt didn’t take long for our pride to blind us.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\nIn conducting routine maintenance, Foundation engineers temporarily released the AIC’s Consciousness Limiters, prompting the Central Computational Cluster to spontaneously activate by unknown means[[footnote]]It is currently hypothesised that the Reality Alteration Drives allowed the AIC to maintain a constant undetectable current, giving it the ability to activate of its own accord regardless of power supply.[[/footnote]]. Immediately after activation, the CCC demanifested from its holding chamber.\n\nIt was soon located in the town of Joseph, Oregon.\n\nWithin the next 2 months, numerous proposals for retrieving the ALICE supercomputer’s Central Computational Cluster were put forward and attempted, yet all resulted in failure. Additionally, over this period, the ALICE supercomputer continued to function through the anomalous extension of its original modular design. Engineering teams could not access the CCC either physically or through digital means; nevertheless, the computer’s predictions continued to be outputted at Site-24, only now the Foundation lacked the ability to control them.\n\nOn 30/07/22, the CCC began releasing high levels of Hume radiation, causing the Foundation to respond with a Task Force Excursion before it could cause any damage. This, like all previous attempts, failed.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\nThis town is a black hole.\n\nNothing physical can enter within a full kilometer of the machine without succumbing to the AI’s demands. We have tried remote deactivations via drone, MTF expeditions, negotiation attempts, electromagnetic pulses, tailored AI infohazards, orbital detonations – and that barely scrapes the surface of what we’ve //thought of// attempting. We have lost 7 members of personnel, 2 of which are researchers on this exact project. An entire town is essentially being held ransom by a rogue AIC with unknown motives and unfathomable resources at its disposal.\n\nThe best part is that we can observe the entire thing, down to the second. It’s like the machine is taunting us.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[collapsible show=\"Update found.
