As with [*http://www.scp-wiki.net/2015-survey-results last year], these results are //not// scientific, but give a somewhat representative perspective of the community.\n\nWe had 2,662 entries this year versus 3,187 last year, this is a trending decline of 16.4%.  Last year it was also a decline of 15.6% from 2014.  I'd like to emphasize the importance of these surveys and appreciate those who took the time to respond to them; we appreciate the feedback, good, bad, and neutral, and will try to take it into account in the future.\n\nAnd now, on to the results!\n----\n= **What is your gender?**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Results\"]]\n||~ Gender ||~ # of people ||~ % of responses ||~ % of responses in 2015 || \n|| Male || 2119 || ##green|79.60%## || 77.22% ||\n|| Female || 357 || ##red|13.41%## || 14.53% ||\n|| Other || 101 || ##red|3.79%## || 5.18% ||\n|| Prefer not to say || 85 || ##green|3.19%## || 3.07% ||\n||~ Total ||~ 2,662 ||~ ||~ ||\n\n> Slight increases in the 'Male' and 'PNTS' categories while slight decreases in 'Female' and 'Other' categories are seen.

For 2016, it seems all 2,662 participants gave a response to this question.  Although the overall numbers were down for this year and we lost users on Twitter, Tumblr, and Facebook, we acquired a sizable DeviantArt community and our Reddit subforum almost tripled in size. \n> \n> **TL;DR - Yay Reddit!**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n= **Which of the following do you do?**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Results\"]]\n\n||~ Activity ||~ # of respondents ||~ % of responses ||~ % of responses in 2015 ||\n|| Read articles on the English wiki || 2558 || ##green|96.09%## || 94.56% ||\n|| Vote &/or comment on the English wiki || 556 || ##red|20.89%## || 23.73% ||\n|| Write articles on the English wiki || 262 || ##red|9.84%## || 12.38% ||\n|| Draw SCP art || 250 || ##green|9.39%## || 8.93% ||\n|| Read articles on one of the non-English wikis || 233 || ##red|8.75%## || 12.41% ||\n|| Write SCP fiction not on one of the wikis || 170 || ##green|6.39%## || 5.23% ||\n|| Roleplay on another site (Twitter, Tumblr, etc.) || 133 || ##red|5.00%## || 5.78% ||\n|| Create other SCP work (music, games, videos, etc.) || 117 || ##red|4.40%## || 5.47% ||\n|| Translate articles for a non-English wiki || 76 || ##red|2.85%## || 4.10% ||\n|| Vote &/or comment on one of the non-English wikis || 71 || 2.67% || * ||\n|| Participate on one of the official SCP roleplay sites || 57 || ##red|2.14%## || 3.32% ||\n|| Write articles on one of the non-English wikis || 51 || 1.92% || * ||\n||~ Total responses ||~ 2662 ||~ ||~ 2924 ||\n\n> Readership remains strong on the English wiki, but there appears to be a significant drop off from wikis in other languages, as seen in the \"Read\" and \"Translate\" categories. The \"Vote &/or comment\" and \"Write articles\" are new categories for the non-English wikis in 2016 (with \"Write\" English and non-English combined in a single category in 2015), and so are not compared with 2015. Slight increases in art drawing and SCP fiction not on the wiki are noted.\n> \n> **TL;DR - Keep reading.  Keep drawing.  Translation sites need more love.**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n= **What do you think about the wiki's Staff (not the in-universe Senior Staff/author avatars) and the job they're doing, individually or as a whole?**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Results\"]]\nGiven that these were free-form answers and people were able to give detailed responses, we can't provide a full breakdown outside of filtering the blanks. That said, the responses generally fell into the following categories:\n\n||~ Response ||~ Number ||~ % of TOT ||~ % of TOT (2015) ||\n|| Approve of Staff || 935 || ##red|78.6%## || 82.2% ||\n|| Neutral/Don’t know || 171 || ##green|14.4%## || 11.3% ||\n|| Do not approve || 43 || ##green|3.6%## || 2.5% ||\n|| Non-answer/Unclear || 41 || ##red|3.4%## || 3.9% ||\n||~ TOTAL ||~ 1190 ||\n\n> A lot of the neutral responses were not aware that staff even existed, but that came from a majority of people that just come to read articles and nothing else, which is fair.  There's another minority that wanted to see more activity from staff, while an almost contradictory minority stated that they like the \"hands-off\" approach.\n> \n> Some of the main complaints were staff being overly harsh, wanky/masturbatory, and rather unapproachable.  Things to take into consideration going forward.\n> \n> The vast majority of responses were praise on the broad spectrum.  Site runs well and keeps getting better from what they observe.  \n> \n> **TL;DR - Most readers are content as long as the site is still running.  Low expectations.**\n\n> Finally, in no particular order, here are some responses that we found amusing:\n> * \"SHIT IN MY ARMPITS\"\n> Not even dinner first?\n> * \"cuck\"\n> typo... oh wait... nvm.\n> * \"As long as you're doing your job right, no one knows you've done it at all.\"\n> This Futurama quote shows up at least 10 times in the survey answers.  Don't know what to make of it.\n> * \"Eh, They're doing well, just allow more NSFW.\" \n> I have been saying this for years now.  At least 350% more NSFW is needed.\n> * \"FUCK NO\"\n> Kay?\n> * \"Fuck yeah.\"\n> Kay!\n> * \"Fucked if I know.\"\n> Que?\n> * \"How they look naked is what I think about the staff.\"\n> This too keeps me up at night.  Great topic.  SCP Staff Pin-up Calendar slotted under 'future projects'.\n> * \"I do not visit the site enough to tell, but the site isn't constantly filled with nothing but pictures of dicks so they must be doing something right\"\n> So many dicks.\n> * \"I don't really know what they actually do\"\n> See above.\n> * \"I for one welcome our demigender pansexual overlords.\"\n> We all identify as some type of dinosaur as well.\n> * \"rumetzen is the sexiest\"\n> Self promotion anyone?  \n> * \"I think they would work better if they all assimilated into one mass.\"\n> Pfft, you don't think we've tried?\n> * \"I think you are all sick horrible people with horrible minds using this site as an outlet for your messed up fucking minds\"\n> Ew a normie.  Nah, I'm a normie too.  You keep on doing you as well.  ;)\n> * \"I'm a fan of strict moderation (like /r/askhistorians), and I think they're doing a great job.\"\n> Seig Heil! jk. <3\n> * \"GOOD. NO GAYS!\"\n> ##red|W####orange|H####yellow|A####green|A####blue|A####indigo|T####purple|?##\n> * \"nice shirt bro\"\n> Oh?  Thanks!  Uh... you too!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n= **Do you have any thoughts or concerns about the direction the wiki is taking?**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Results\"]]\n\n||~ Response ||~ % of TOT ||\n|| **Neutral response** || 48.1% ||\n|| **Positive response** || 24.5% ||\n|| SCP has hit its peak already or is getting there || 3.8% ||\n|| Lack of activity or internet presence is concerning || 3.6% ||\n|| Needs more horror || 3.3% ||\n|| Hard to break in as a newcomer || 2.9% ||\n|| Quality decreasing || 2.8% ||\n|| Getting boring || 1.9% ||\n|| Too liberal || 1.4% ||\n|| **Other/Unreadable** || 7.7% ||\n\n> In the future, I think this question needs to be more focused on what it's asking.  The responses were all over the board with this one and after a few tries trying to consolidate it all, it was better to group the top answers as much as possible.  \n> \n> The majority of these answers were very nuetral, bordering on positive, so it was a little difficult to slice cleanly on what was positive and what was nuetral.  Everything from \"Nah.\" to a novel falls under these responses.  A good portion were just too new to comment or just there to read articles.  \n> \n> A minority of the answers are worried about the wiki plateuing or it's in decline currently.  Another minority was concerned with the quality and content of writing and how it has shifted away from its roots.  These are all things to take with a grain of salt in how we judge ourselves and how we're doing, but the real meat and potatoes of the survey are in the responses to the next question below.  \n> \n> **TL;DR - Not very good survey results but most are content currently.**\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n----\n= **If you could change ONE thing about the wiki, what would it be?**\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Results\"]]\n\nSo we are doing it a little differently this year but first some stats.\n\n__Out of the 2,662 responses of the survey only 1,195 gave an answer to this question, which is only 45% of the total.__  I'd like to emphasize the importance of these long form answers and hope to see a better turnout next year.\n\n__Of the 1,195 answers, 484 were mostly praise or indifferent/neutral responses.__  The rest of these results were filtered based on content whether it was trolling, unreadable, or just general ignorance of what SCP is and how it works.  __The final 711 answers, 27% of total survey entries,__ that are considered earnest critique are all there for everyone to see. Many were grouped into categories.  Some of these are far-fetched and/or frankly impossible, but it's to illustrate the wants and needs of our community at large.  If anything, this is just a wishlist so take it with a grain of salt.\n\n* Items in ##blue|blue## are technical or design concerns.\n* Items in ##008f00|green## are specifically related to Staff and Staff interactions or duties.\n* Items in ##ff8f00|orange## concern writing content or community standards, which is largely dependent on the authors and commenters on the wiki.\n* Items in normal text color don't easily fit into one of the other categories. \n\n|| ##blue|Better site layout (Aesthetics)## || 94 ||\n|| ##blue|Easier/intuitive site navigation/search## || 71 ||\n|| ##blue|Mobile

Some think that this just needs to be the standard in default colors rather than white background and black text.  Also the use of some graphics or animations to make it flashy were also suggested.  A lot of the suggestions also asked for a larger font size, but it was unclear if they meant for mobile or browser.  Either of which should be able to increase the font size in settings in some way or another.  Search bar and intuitive navigation was also a big hitter in the list of complaints.  Some people were not able to find what they are looking for or are overwhelmed from search results.   \n> \n> Lastly for the tech side, the mobile users had their say as they wanted a layout that was much more mobile friendly.  Things like the 'Random' button taking too long or a 'Next' and 'Previous' button by default for binge reading was also suggested.  This I think stems from the limitations of the Wikidot platform and until we can work around (see [http://www.scp-wiki.net/usertools Usertools]) or effectively muster the resources, time, and knowledge of how to move this will be an ongoing concern.\n> \n> **TL;DR - In the short term, site needs a makeover.  Long term, get off wikidot.**\n\n> ++ ##green|Staff and Staff Interactions or Duties## \n> Main takeaways is that there are people who find the current membership and submission rules to be rather draconic.  There were a lot of suggestions to lower the age limit.  There was also a suggestion to somehow make a non-writer account just for voting and not for submitting.  Some complaints were targeted toward turnaround time in applications for new members.  In contrast, there was another group wanting //more// restrictions on submissions.  \n> \n> Complaints against staff were somewhat centered around availability.  A few suggested the rotation of the admin position.  Others addressed issues with leadership, selectivity, or accusations of elitism.  Things to take into consideration going forward.\n> \n> **TL;DR - Want a streamlined path to membership and posting.**\n\n> ++ ##orange|Writing Content or Community Standards## \n> This one was all over the fucking place.  Sheesh.  The //big// one was a demand for more media, whether in the article or fanart.  There's certainly an appreciation for the visual here, but not only visual... a good half of these were requests for audio logs as well.  So there's for sure an audience out there if you're handy with a mic.\n> \n> The rest of the comments were requests for making more SCPs, more tales, and giving tales the spotlight a bit more.  There was also some Crackfic and -J hate, suggesting to move them off site entirely because they drag the site down as a whole, but this was not a huge amount of people.\n> \n> **TL;DR - More media.  More SCPs.  More tales.  Some people are too harsh.**\n\n> ++ Everything Else\n> Obviously, more contests.  A lot of people had suggestions for what type of contest they'd like to see.  So maybe a contest for a contest theme in the near future.  Plenty of people with ideas.  People also wanted to see more updates and more frequent featured articles on the front page.  Maybe make it bi-monthly or a weekly thing was suggested. \n> \n> Other concerns were our diminishing internet presence is not what it used to be.  Maybe need to maybe rethink how we can get ourselves out there more.  The other more interesting requests were wanting a separate place for all the deleted articles so they can be viewed.  Also folks wanting official merchandise or an actual SCP brand to be formed, but that has been a larger discussion in the past.\n> \n> **TL;DR - More contests.  Update front page more often.**\n\n> ++ Interesting Responses\n> * Have an arranged marriage between HAGGER and Conselo.  Then have BritHog videotape their honeymoon sexcapades.  Trump 2016.
