SL00195 is your baby, I get it. We all have our pet projects! But the fact of the matter is that the Complex is better-funded and better-equipped to handle this project, especially since the Date of Sale is in a couple of months. The Foundation really doesn't like late deliveries, haha. But don't worry. I'll be sure to let the team in New Portland know that they can call you up for any technical advice or inquiries. In the meantime, you've still got the DeVry Core for a month or two. Try to iron out the kinks with the power supply, yeah? Keep me in the loop 👍!\n\n----\n\nVikram Ali\nSenior Product Manager\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n||||~ **SL00195 TEST EXCERPT** ||\n||~ Test ||~ Result ||\n|| Small bowl of tap water.

We managed to isolate the identifiers from a mouse and swap them with some water. Then introduced an object with no qualities to mix it up. It's absolutely freaky to see, I have to say.
