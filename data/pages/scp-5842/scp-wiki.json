Previous sightings of SCP-5842 are currently being passed off as gags. Wellington is to be monitored in the case that SCP-5842 becomes active again. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5842 is a standard North American stop sign. SCP-5842's primary anomalous property is appearing in a location via unknown means[[footnote]]Due to the similarities between SCP-5842 and [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1047 | SCP-1047]]], an investigation is underway to find a connection between them.[[/footnote]]. Initially, it was believed that SCP-5842 appeared at random, however, further research has discerned a pattern in its appearances. See addenda below. \n\n**Addendum-5842:** \n\nAdded below is a list of the most noteworthy sightings and encounters with SCP-5842. \n\nThe first is a series of text message exchanges between Wilma Greggs and her employer. \n\n**First Encounter:**\n\n[[div style=\"background: gray; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: white; padding: 1px 15px; border: solid 3px lightgray; margin: 10px; border-radius: 30px 15px;\"]]\n\n\n**Lisa:** Hey, Wilma.

I get off in an hour. Come out of the house. I'll take you somewhere. Come on. My treat.\n\n**Wilma:** sorry. cant.\n\n**Lisa:** Don't worry about the price. I'll take you somewhere, anywhere.

I just want to be there for you, you know? \n\n**Wilma:** i cant leave the house. \n\n**Lisa:** Why not?? \n\n**Wilma:** theres a stop sign outside my window. so i cant go outside. \n\n**Lisa:** ...Wilma, I'm gonna call you. \n\n//<Lisa tries to call Wilma. It gets rejected.>// \n\n**Wilma:** stop i cant make phone calls either. \n\n**Lisa:** Come on, dear, just talk to me. You've been working yourself to death. Why can't you answer the phone anyways? \n\n**Wilma:** i cant answer the phone because the stop sign told me not to. \n\n**Lisa:** ??? \n\n**Wilma:** i went for a cup of coffee at the office and then i heard the customer phone ring. when i went there to answer it, there was a stop sign in my cubicle. \n\n**Lisa:** IN your cubicle?

I'm still coming, okay? \n\n**Wilma:** eh. \n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n**Second Encounter:**\n\n\nSCP-5842 made an appearance in the morgue of Tillman Funeral Home and Crematory. The following is a letter of resignation by Craig Dillard, an employee of Tillman Funeral Home.\n\n> Dear Johnny Truman. \n> This is my official letter of resignation. As you know, I am a very devout and pious follower of the Christian faith. For the longest time, I thought I was doing a good job, handling the bodies of the deceased and preparing them for burials. I had always believed that taking on a job such as this was good for my soul. \n> \n> I thought that if I helped my fellow men and women see off their loved ones as they departed to the gilded gates of our glorious God, that I'd be recognized as virtuous. \n> But sadly, that is not the case. I have received a sign from our Lord and Heavenly Father that I must stop what I have dedicated my career to. \n> \n> I was working on the body of an emissary of traffic when I turned around and saw the sign from God right then and there, peering down upon my work in the midst of me checking on the body's decomposition. In his life, this man directed the automobiles on the road. In death, he—ergo, God—has directed the vehicle of my life choices. \n> \n> I must leave this occupation. \n> \n> If God himself gave me this sign, I must heed it. Thank you for everything, Johnny. \n> I wish you the best,\n> Craig Dillard\n\n\n\n**Third Encounter:**\n\n\nSCP-5842 was spotted in Wellington Elementary School. There was a writing assignment that had the students introduce themselves and describe something of interest that they had seen. \n\nOne of the students described their experience of being followed by SCP-5842, transcribed below. Spelling and grammar errors are preserved from the original document.\n\n\n\n[[div class=\"page\"]]\n[[div class=\"hand\"]]\nWilliam Greggs\n10/4/2019 \nMrs. Pollock \n[[=]]\n**cool things i have seen**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[size 120%]]Hi my name is william greggs but my mommy and daddy call me will. my mommy is wilma greggs her name sounds almost the same right? daddys the only one with a different name and its thomas greggs!
