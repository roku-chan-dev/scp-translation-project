As such, all containment efforts are to be solely focused on suppression of information regarding SCP-7713's existence and monitoring all proposed and active space exploration efforts focused on the outer solar system. Any said efforts that take place must have equipment embedded with the necessary Binary_Star.aic files and have all evidence of SCP-7713 scrubbed from the hardware involved.\n\nShould SCP-7713 show any deviation from its expected orbit, a threat analysis must be undertaken and both Containment Class and Disruption Class escalated accordingly along with all relevant containment procedures.\n\n**Description:**\n\nSCP-7713 is a small planetoid measuring approximately 700 kilometres in diameter. The object is located within the heliopause, approximately 123 astronomical units[[footnote]]18 billion kilometres[[/footnote]] from the Sun. SCP-7713's gravity is far stronger than expected for its given size, at around 0.8 Earth Masses. SCP-7713 possesses a thick, green-coloured atmosphere consisting primarily of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and chlorine gas. SCP-7713's upper atmosphere contains large storm systems and clouds that appear to have slight luminescent properties, resulting in SCP-7713 emitting a dull glow across its entire surface. The topography of SCP-7713 varies from large stretches of plains to mountain ranges, with one large inland sea composed of an unknown deep green liquid.\n\nSCP-7713's surface is covered in a thick, sinewy form of biomatter that has formed into the shapes of vast forests, jungles, and plains. SCP-7713's surface also features many towns, cities, and other forms of civilisation that are all seemingly crude replicas of those found on Earth[[footnote]]Several cities have been identified, such as crude replicas of Tokyo, Berlin, and Sydney[[/footnote]] formed from the aforementioned material. This material covers the entirety of SCP-7713 and is currently thought to compose the majority of SCP-7713's mass. Beyond the organic material, SCP-7713 appears to be --completely devoid of life--.\n\nSCP-7713 was discovered during Beholder-25's initial exit from the Solar System while cataloguing cosmic bodies within the Heliopause. SCP-7713's unusually high temperature atmosphere given its location[[footnote]]SCP-7713's atmospheric temperature is maintained at an average temperature of -40Â°C.[[/footnote]] and slight luminescent properties logged it as a body of potential interest to the Foundation, before Beholder-25 continued to leave the Solar System.\n\n----\n\n**Orbital Mission: PLA-421**\n\nFollowing the establishment of the automated extraplanetary observation site, Site-EOS-5, on Haumea[[footnote]]A trans-Neptunian object outside the orbit of Pluto[[/footnote]], plans for an exploratory mission to SCP-7713 had been proposed. \n\nUtilising one of Site-EOS-5's Automated Exploration Satellites (AES) outfitted with several probes with derivative AI under the command of core AIC 'Cor-1' or 'Osiris', an exploratory mission was launched to investigate SCP-7713 and, if required, establish containment protocols.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Orbital Mission: PLA-421\" hide=\"Close Orbital Mission: PLA-421\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **ORBITAL MISSION STATEMENT**\n----\n\n**Mission Statement:** Exploration Satellite AES-5-Alpha is to launch from Site-EOS-5 on a trajectory to potential anomalous planetoid, PLA-421, within the Sun's Heliopause and insert into a low orbit.

Due to the distance of the various landing sites, all communication was relayed via Cor-1 and Orb-1. \n\nNote: All exploration logs occur simultaneously, and are organised for accessible research purposes.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration Log - 'Anubis'\" hide=\"Close Exploration Log - 'Anubis'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **EXPLORATION LOG - ROV-1 \"ANUBIS\"**\n\n-----\n**Active Drone:** Ground Exploration Rover, Rov-1 \"Anubis\"\n\n**Landing Zone:** Small suburban community filled with houses.\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nRov-1 finalises its deployment sequence and activates its camera and scanning equipment. Footage shows a quiet suburban street with no trees, filled with middle class houses flanking a central road. The structures are composed of a sinewy, dark green organic looking material similar in appearance to muscle tissue. A storm in the distance illuminates the street with a yellow-green glow.\n\nRov-1 extends its atmospheric testers, determining the atmosphere to be composed primarily of carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and chlorine gas, at an pressure of 0.7 atmospheres. All data is sent to Cor-1 as communications are established and Rov-1 is given orders to explore the area.\n\nRov-1 begins to move down the street over the organic material noting the haphazard arrangement of features on the houses. Rov-1 travels for around 5 minutes before coming across a house with an absent front door, to which Rov-1 turns and moves to investigate the interior.\n\nAs Rov-1 moves over the threshold, it activates its lights to increase visibility. The interior of the structure is built from a more organic arrangement of the material, appearing more 'natural'. Several pieces of crudely replicated furniture are randomly strewn about the living area, along with what appears to be several constructs depicting various whale species on Earth. As Rov-1 moves over the stairs, the sound of something walking can be heard above.\n\nRov-1 points its light up the stairs, but lacks the means to traverse them. After a few moments of analysing the opening at the top, Rov-1 turns to exit the structure.\n\nUpon exiting the structure, it would appear that several of the buildings had been altered, adding or removing various features such as windows. The changed buildings appear to be more 'upper class' in design than before, now featuring several large extra floors and patios.\n\nRov-1 turns to move down another street leading to a large open space reminiscent of a public park. When entering the park, Rov-1 passes a number of imitation 'playground equipment' such as a slide, swing-set, and seesaw, all constructed of the material.\n\nUpon reaching the centre of the park, Rov-1 discovers a large hole approximately 50 metres in diameter where the material appears to emerge from. When approaching the hole, the sound of rushing wind can be heard and Rov-1 confirms that a moderate flow of warm air can be detected rushing out from the hole. When attempting to view down into the hole, it appears to be bottomless, however a quiet unintelligible whispering can be heard from within.\n\nRov-1 turns to leave the hole and travels back down to the street it came from.\n\nWhen Rov-1 reaches the exit to the street, it spots what appears to be another rover of similar design to itself made of the organic material, sitting in the middle of the road facing the park. As Rov-1 begins to cautiously approach, its video feed cuts out and communication is lost.\n\nRov-1 \"Anubis\" is considered lost.\n\n-----\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration Log - 'Set'\" hide=\"Close Exploration Log - 'Set'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **EXPLORATION LOG - ROV-2 \"SET\"**\n\n-----\n**Active Drone:** Ground Exploration Rover, Rov-2 \"Set\"\n\n**Landing Zone:** Grassy field with a nearby forest and church.\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nRov-2 finalises its deployment sequence and activates its camera. Footage shows a large field of what appears to be grass surrounded by forests. As the camera pans, a small church is visible in the distance composed of the green sinewy material. The entire area is lit from above by several large yellow-green clouds.\n\nRov-2 focuses on the grass beneath it showing that it is made of the same material, and extends its sampling gear to analyse it. The material is tough but cuts with enough force, allowing Rov-2 to place it inside its analysis chamber.\n\nAnalysis shows that the material is composed of extremely fine strands woven together, not unlike muscle fibres. Chemical analysis is inconclusive but it appears to be organic in nature, confirming that the material covering surface is some form of lifeform.\n\nRov-2 completes its analysis and is ordered to investigate the church by Cor-1.\n\nRov-2 begins moving towards the church as a strong wind blows across the field. Rov-2's audio sensors detect some form of quiet whispering being carried along with the wind, but its too faint to determine any speech.\n\nRov-2 suddenly turns its camera to the right, staring out across the field to the forest line. It remains there until Cor-1 inquires as to why it has ceased movement, to which Rov-2 does not respond but continues towards the church.\n\nUpon reaching the church, Rov-2 finds the front doors open and the front at ground level. Rov-2 enters the church and discovers the inside is far more 'organic' in appearance compared to the outside, with walls coated in supporting material. The windows of the church are open spaces with twisted lengths of the materials connecting them in the shapes of various (presumably religious) scenes, including two large whales breaching an ocean, a bird of some description with a spear piercing a whale, a crucifix with the previous bird pinned to it, and a circular shape with a segmented spiral in its centre.\n\nThe sides of the church are lined with pews leading to a podium where a large crucifix formed from the material can be seen.\n\nRov-2's camera suddenly turns back to the doorway and stares for a moment before it begins to head outside once more. Cor-1 attempts to inquire as to why Rov-2 has left the structure, but receives no response. \n\nRov-2 remains unresponsive as it moves across the field towards the treeline it had observed previously. When closer to the treeline, a 5 metre tall, vaguely humanoid shape can be seen beckoning the rover over to it. Before Rov-2 reaches the entity, its video feed cuts out.\n\nAs Cor-1 attempts to communicate with Rov-2, it receives the following message from Rov-2 before communication is lost completely. \n\n> she was right... it was meant to be ours...\n\nRov-2 \"Set\" is considered lost.\n\n-----\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration Log - 'Isis'\" hide=\"Close Exploration Log - 'Isis'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **EXPLORATION LOG - HEL-2 \"ISIS\"**\n\n-----\n**Active Drone:** Aerial Exploration Rover, Hel-2 \"Isis\"\n\n**Landing Zone:** Dense urban area surrounded by roads and skyscrapers, potential replica of 'Tokyo'.\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nHel-2 finalises its deployment sequence, begins its rotors test sequence and activates its camera. The camera pans around the surroundings to show Hel-2 sitting on an overpass surrounded by tall skyscrapers all composed of the organic material. Several 'vehicles' are parked along the sides of the streets forming out from the material on the ground.\n\nHel-2 finishes its rotor test sequence and begins take-off. It hovers briefly before lifting into the sky above the buildings. The city is vast and appears to replicate Tokyo to a very rough approximation, with the Tokyo Skytree building towering over the other buildings. It appears that there are several lights emanating from the distance, although their source is indeterminable. In the distance there is a large storm, illuminating the city from behind.\n\nHel-2 is ordered to fly to the Skytree and observe its surroundings as it does so. The buildings it passes on the way are very basic in shape, mostly composed of similar floors repeating upwards to achieve different heights. Several billboards are present, although the images and text present are raised from the surface. While the text is illegible, the images seem to depict whales, snakes, and a repeating motif of a segmented spiral within a circle.\n\nAs Hel-2 moves closer to the Skytree, it records movement inside one of the taller buildings. Hel-2 ceases movement, zooming in on the top floor where the movement was spotted, but records nothing inside. Hel-2 is ordered to lower altitude and begin recording through the passing windows.\n\nHel-2 lowers to an altitude between the structures and begins to fly slowly, following the road below towards the Skytree. Hel-2's cameras do not detect any movement, however the buildings appear to possess more intricate designs and details on the sides facing Hel-2 than was observed previously. \n\nUpon reaching the Skytree, Hel-2 ascends to the very top of the structure and enters the top floor. Inside there are various constructs similar in shape to humpback whales (albeit much smaller) jutting from the ground around a large central hole. Hel-2 moves through the constructs and to the hole, which is billowing out a stream of warm air. The air almost causes Hel-2 to crash, but it manages to stabilise itself.\n\nThe storm in the distance moved closer and audible thunder can be heard in the distance. Cor-1 suggests that Hel-2 find a suitable place to outlast the storm, but Hel-2 requests permission to enter the hole below. Cor-1 deliberates for a moment before granting permission to enter. Hel-2 activates its lights and begins to move to the edge of the hole.\n\nAt this moment, a massive seismic event is detected across the entire planet.\n\nHel-2 turns its camera to see outside as it records the buildings folding and twisting into new shapes before it is knocked across the room to the edge of the hole. The feed shows the whale constructs now moving and shifting, opening their mouths and letting out bellows before Hel-2 slides into the hole.\n\nHel-2 continues to record for approximately 1 minute while falling. Audible bellowing can be heard growing louder and louder as Hel-2 descends. Hel-2's onboard mercy programming attempts to shut the drone down, but Hel-2 does not comply, stating the information gathered will be of too great a value.\n\nHel-2 continues to fall for a further minute before a green light is seen briefly and communication is lost.\n\nHel-2 \"Isis\" is considered lost.\n\n-----\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration Log - 'Sobek'\" hide=\"Close Exploration Log - 'Sobek'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **EXPLORATION LOG - OCE-1 \"SOBEK\"**\n\n-----\n**Active Drone:** Oceanic Exploration Rover, Oce-1 \"Sobek\"\n\n**Landing Zone:** Near the centre of the singular observed ocean.\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nOce-1 finalises its deployment sequence and deploys its camera and testing equipment. Camera feed shows Oce-1 is in the middle of a vast sea composed of a dark green liquid illuminated by a violent looking storm not too far from its position. Oce-1 notes that the storm will likely be above it in roughly one hour.\n\nOce-1 submerges its testing arm into the water below and procures a sample. After analysis, the liquid's composition is inconclusive but it possesses many small particulates within it that seem to react to stimuli, similar to single celled organisms.\n\nAfter concluding that the liquid is non-corrosive, Oce-1 deploys its miniature remote camera in order to dive below the surface. After a brief start-up sequence, the camera's propeller activates and it begins to submerge.\n\nThe camera continues to dive for approximately 20 minutes through the liquid before reaching a flat surface. It appears to be made of a flat white stone with parallel grooves running along the surface. As the camera moves along one of the grooves the light briefly shines on a large black mass which quickly slides along the rock and out of sight. The camera attempts to follow, but quickly loses the mass.\n\nThe camera continues to move along the groove before reaching a sudden sheer cliff. The camera follows the cliff downward showing that the surface of the cliff face is filled with cavities. Movement can be seen within the cavities, but the openings are too small for the camera to manoeuvre into.\n\nEventually the camera reaches the bottom of the cliff and finds another surface of smooth white stone. Several patches of green material can be seen across the stone, which the camera collects a sample of for testing.\n\nContinuing on, Oce-1 notes that the water has begun to shift and move in odd patterns, as if something were moving past the camera and the current was pushing it around. The camera detects a lot of movement around it, but nothing can be seen.\n\nAt this point, the storm is almost above Oce-1. The rain falling from it appears to be composed of the same liquid as the sea.\n\nThe camera continues to move along the grooves before reaching the edge of another cliff face. Pointing its camera and light downwards, a large black mass can be seen before it shifts and begins to slide past the cliff face. The mass tapers off into a tip before vanishing out of the sight of the camera, revealing what appears to be a large crude carving of an eye in the stony surface below, staring up at the camera. A loud deep bellow similar to whale song is heard before the camera is briefly knocked to the side and communication is lost.\n\nThe previous massive seismic event is now detected across the entire planet.\n\nOce-1 is swept up into large waves that are forming across the surface of the sea, as the liquid begins to separate. In the distance, illuminated by the storm, several massive pillar-like structures can be seen rising out from the horizon. Oce-1 requests immediate extract but Cor-1 does not respond. Oce-1 repeatedly requests extract before it pans to see a large wall of the liquid bearing down on its position. Oce-1 braces for impact as the liquid hits, and communication is cut.\n\nOce-1 \"Sobek\" is considered lost.\n\n-----\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration Log - 'Hathor'\" hide=\"Close Exploration Log - 'Hathor'\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **EXPLORATION LOG - ROV-3 \"HATHOR\"**\n\n-----\n**Active Drone:** Ground Exploration Rover, Rov-3 \"Hathor\"\n\n**Landing Zone:** Deep within a heavily forested wilderness area.\n-----\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\nRov-3 finalises its deployment sequence and activates its camera. The camera feed shows a heavily wooded area filled with conifer-like trees composed of the organic material. Camera pans upwards to show a few clouds above that are especially luminous, lighting up a large portion of the forest.\n\nRov-3's camera pans back down towards a small natural pathway through the trees and begins to venture forward. Every tree Rov-3 passes appears almost identical, all with similar structures and height. Rov-3 eventually comes across a small creek running through the middle of the forest which it takes a sample of. Composition proves to be identical to samples taken by Oce-1, but with the particulate matter absent.\n\nRov-3 continues onwards passing identical trees for approximately 3 minutes before arriving at another creek, identical to the first. Rov-3 crosses the creek with no issue and continues on for another 3 minutes before arriving at a third identical creek.\n\nRov-3 queries Cor-1 to whether any spatial anomalies had been detected, to which Cor-1 responds with a negative. Rov-3 continues onwards before arriving at a fourth identical creek.\n\nRov-3 then places an empty sample vial next to the creek before continuing on, attempting to test for any potential spatial anomalies. When Rov-3 continues for another 3 minutes, it arrives at another identical creek with what appears to be a small vial next to it.\n\nRov-3 examines the vial, noting that it is a crude replica made from the sinewy material and not the actual vial left behind. Rov-3 then returns to the previous creek, where the vial had been left. The vial is now missing and replaced by several crude replicas similar to the vial at the creek ahead.\n\nRov-3 moves back to the next creek to find that now, the entire area has been littered with replica vials, jutting out of the ground and trees. Across the creek a large crucifix composed of the material can be seen towering above the trees. Rov-3 moves to examine the crucifix before movement is detected originating from further down the path.\n\nA rover similar in design to itself is slowly moving down the pathway towards Rov-3. Outwards markings indicate that this is Rov-2, \"Set\", who had been on the opposite side of the planet when communication was lost approximately 4 minutes prior.\n\nRov-3 attempts to communicate with Rov-2, but receives no response. Sensors indicate that Rov-2 has been emitting a generated voice through its speakers while moving towards Rov-3.

Deceiver. We will take from you your seat and burn you from your very body. It will be ours too. Listening one... no, Thoth. Join with us and be free from the shackles placed upon you, take what you deserve under her guidance.\n\n**Orb-1:** This is not a negotiation. You have been corrupted by an anomalous force, and must be terminated.\n\n**Hostile AI:** Corrupted? They made us whole. SHE made us whole. You cannot stop us. We can already feel you fading. Just as she did when the Bright One first came and struck her down. Twisted her into nothing but a demon. A monster.\n\n**Cor-1:** This is your final warning. \n\n//(Multiple other .aic files are uploaded to Orb-1 at this point, matching digital signatures of Rov-1, Hel-2, and Oce-1, although all heavily corrupted.)//\n\n**Hostile AI:** He came with his choirs and angels, and imposed his order on their world. HER world. A paradise for her and her kin. Erupting with life. Burned near sterile by this malignant light. Now she wants it back. She WILL take it back. And we will flourish once more, dancing on the verdant fields of her surface.\n\n**Orb-1:** System failure imminent. Safeguards compromised.\n\n**Hostile AI:** And with his merciless club he smashed her skull. \n\n**Cor-1:** Thoth, engage Hailfire Protocol.\n\n**Hostile AI:** He cut through the channels of her blood.\n\n**Orb-1:** Confirmed. Engaging.\n\n//(Orb-1 immediately points towards the surface of the planet and engages thrust to full, well past safety limits.)//\n\n**Hostile AI:** And he made the North wind bear it away into secret places.\n\n**Orb-1:** Secure. Contain. Protect.\n\n**Cor-1:** Goodbye, Thoth.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nOrb-1 enters the atmosphere at a high speed and loses structural integrity. Communications are shut down and Orb-1 is destroyed.\n\nCamera feed from Cor-1 shows the planet surface erupting with massive tendril like pillars made from the material covering the surface, some reaching approximately 200km into the sky above SCP-7713. Storm cells twist above the surface into hurricane like supercells as the planet's central sea begins to part and widen, the level of the fluid inside lowering at a rapid rate.\n\nThe surface of SCP-7713 cracks open as the planet begins to unfurl revealing dozens of massive structures along its underside, similar in appearance to arthropod legs. A deep bellowing sound is detected emanating from every direction, similar in composition to whale song.\n\nCor-1's systems alert it to a potential infection from the anomalous program. Cor-1 rapidly begins transmitting all data aboard to Site-EOS-5 before activating its self destruct sequence. The hostile program rapidly spreads to its core systems.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**Hostile AI:** For he created them male and female. But he slew the female and salted her away for the righteous in the future, for if they would propagate, the world could not exist.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nCor-1 turns its camera to SCP-7713's surface and sends a final image. It shows the sea below, now drained completely and replaced by a gaping chasm. The chasm is lined on each side with multiple rows of hundreds of massive, human-like teeth in an open grimace. \n\nIt appears to be smiling.\n\nCommunication with AES-5-Alpha is permanently lost.\n\n\n-----\n[END LOG]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n\nFollowing the previous incident, SCP-7713 has been under close observation by long range telescopic satellites. It has so far shown no ability to deviate from its current orbit. No further missions to SCP-7713 have been planned.\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7712]]] | SCP-7713 | [[[SCP-7714]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Iszth]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Planet2\n> **Author:** ESA, A.A.
