Secondary containment procedures are considered adequate until a more feasible mechanism for SCP-3884's containment is determined.\n\nMobile Task Force Rho-66 “Road Hogs” will maintain continual ground and aerial patrols of the American Southwest. When alerted by Foundation listening network PANOPTICON, MTF Rho-66 assets will engage SCP-3884. If SCP-3884 is stationed in a heavily-populated area, Foundation assets will establish an observation cordon around SCP-3884 and immediately confiscate any items distributed to the populace by SCP-3884-01 while deflecting local law enforcement involvement. MTF Rho-66 will then track SCP-3884 until it has cleared the population center, then engage. Resultant explosion will be publicly designated a vehicular accident. \n\nAll civilians and local law enforcement personnel exposed to SCP-3884 will be amnesticized.\n\nUnder no circumstances are Foundation personnel to attempt to acquire or redeem Civil Defense Points.\n\n**Description**: SCP-3884 is a black Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau (IFA) W 50 cab-over truck that displays a number of anomalous properties.\n\nSCP-3884's performance capabilities exceed that of a standard cargo truck.  It has shown the ability to attain speeds of over 270 kilometers per hour, and exhibits effects characteristic of a Class 2 reality distortion field, including spatiotemporal translocation and the spontaneous manifestation of matter, described in further detail below.\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=apprehension.JPG|\ncaption=Typical result of SCP-3884 detainment attempt|\nwidth=300px\n]]\nSCP-3884 will typically manifest within the outskirts of a population center, then drive to a local gathering point such as a strip mall, market, fairground, parking lot, or downtown area, whereupon SCP-3884-01 will exit the vehicle, lower its rear hatch, and attempt to distribute its wares. If approached by an element that intends to detain or obstruct SCP-3884-01's activities, SCP-3884 will explode, and SCP-3884-01 will vanish. SCP-3884 will then remanifest elsewhere in the southwestern United States after a variable amount of time.\n\nSCP-3884-01 visually resembles an emaciated, significantly decomposed humanoid figure, typically wearing a stahlhelm, leather trenchcoat, and combat boots. SCP-3884-01 will [http://www.scp-wiki.net/undead-insane-and-fully-loaded loudly advertise its products] and attempt to give them to any passersby within arm's reach, or simply throw them on the ground in a pile near SCP-3884 in the frequent event that no civilians accept them. These items have thus far included fully-automatic machine guns, high-powered anti-materiel rifles, rocket launchers, flamethrowers, anti-personnel and anti-vehicle mines, and, in one instance, a Nerf brand toy rifle, spray-painted black and given to a small child.\n\nEach individual instance of weaponry will have a flyer crudely affixed to it with duct tape. Text follows.\n\n[[div style=\"background:#f2f2f2; margin:36pt; padding:3%;text-align:left;\"]] \n[[=]]\n+ ##green|//IT'S TIME TO LOCK AND LOAD, CITIZENS!//## \n@@@@\n@@@@\n++ ##green|DO YOU WANT TO BE SAFE?

Your time has come.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAs SCP-3884's activities invariably attract local law enforcement attention, its attempts to supply weaponry to the populace are brief and swiftly interrupted. To date, civilians have reacted negatively to all SCP-3884 appearances and none have willingly accepted any items given by SCP-3884-01. As a result, none have participated in its rewards program, thus information regarding the aforementioned “prizes” is limited.\n\nEfforts to successfully detain SCP-3884 or SCP-3884-01 are currently underway.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[include component:wikimodule |normal= --]]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3883]]] | SCP-3884 | [[[SCP-3885]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
