There was less than an inch of clearance between the bulk of the desk and the floor, but the fan had nevertheless already blown a few sheets of paper through. He stared at one of them with horrified fascination; the words formed one at a time, sharpening, clarifying, the paper turning glossy before his eyes.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; margin-left: 16px; margin-right: 16px;\"]]\n[[div style=\"background:#C9FCFF; padding-top: 8px; padding-bottom: 8px; padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;\"]]\n++ **IKIGAI**\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"padding-left: 16px; padding-right: 16px;\"]]\n__System: Nintendo 64__\n__Developer: Togenyko__\n__Publisher: Unknown__\n__Release Date: 12 February 1999__\n\nSociety has checks and balances to prevent things like Togenkyo from happening. Your school teachers encourage you to discover your talents. Your guidance counsellors help you put those talents to work in a career. Your career is a leaning and success curve, onward and upward in knowledge and accomplishments. Togenkyo's story is a perversion of that journey. Togenkyo is what happens when you're terrible at something, and everyone tells you to spend the rest of your life doing it, and you //do// spend the rest of your life doing it, and you never get any better.\n\nPlodding along since the Atari and NES era, this company has produced a series of stinkers obviously designed to pay the bills for //Ikigai,// a developer's baby which ended up sucking the life out of its proud papa until his bankrollers did him a favour and strangled it in the crib. I don't know how much of his \"vision\" he accomplished before the jobbers rushed in, but the results aren't pretty. I was promised an action-packed hack-and-slash by Togenkyo's in-your-face marketing, and what I got was a frou-frou JRPG with obviously tacked-on horror elements. It's not worth your money. It's not worth my time.\n\nI won't waste another second reviewing it, because it's not a video game, because Togenkyo is not a video game company. Togenkyo is a deluded idiot, and //Ikigai// is his suicide note.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nA series of scarlet lines began cris-crossing the text, and McInnis realized someone had scribbled over every word in red pen. He realized this at about the moment when the musical sound of glass being crushed underfoot announced the arrival of his pursuer at the door.\n\nHe didn't dare breathe. He relaxed his body against the frame of the desk so his arms wouldn't tremble with the effort of holding his heaving chest aloft. He was afraid to even close his eyes, as though the white-clad IJAMEA agent might be able to hear the sound of a single blink.\n\nA shadow crept beneath the desk. The man-or-monster knew where he was hiding. It had to be raising its razor-sharp //naginata// over its head. It—\n\nBANG.\n\nA spurt of blood splashed over the edge of the desk and onto the floor beside him.\n\nBANG. The desk slammed into him, sending him sprawling into the red-stained carpet as the IJAMEA agent fell hard against it. McInnis scrambled to his feet and saw Kuroki standing in the doorway, the open elevator shaft yawning behind him, smoking pistol in his hand.\n\nThe agent was lying on the floor, pike still clutched in its linen-wrapped fist. It shuddered and groaned. It hauled itself up on top of the desk with one hand, and the shining white light from its cyclopean visor momentarily blinded McInnis.\n\nBANG.\n\nThis final shot struck it clean in the spine, and it roared with pain and fury. The //naginata// came down into the carpet, slicing into the floorboards with deadly ease, and the creature used it as a crutch to regain a standing position. Kuroki's trigger discipline was excellent; he kept the gun levelled, but avoided making the tell-tale clicking sound which would have revealed that its magazine was empty.\n\nMalice radiating from its expressionless face, the IJAMEA agent turned around and rushed towards the doorway.\n\n\"Kuroki!\" McInnis screamed. \"One side!\"\n\nAnd he barrelled into the creature from behind.\n\nMcInnis struck his foe centre mass, and shoved him hard into the hallway. Kuroki leapt out of the way, and McInnis dropped his weight, falling onto the broken door that lay on the floor as he shoved with all his might. The IJAMEA agent spun as he fell into the open elevator shaft, swinging his nasty weapon in one final vain gesture of hatred. It sliced cleanly through a dangling cable, and the severed bottom half followed him down into the abyss.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image TO.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThey both lay there for a moment, taking the chance to catch their breaths. Kuroki sat up first; he jammed the spent pistol into its holster. It was no longer recognizable as any sort of tool; it had nearly morphed into a solid grey block by the time he stood up and pulled McInnis to his feet. \"It's gonna get dark here real soon,\" he said. \"We need to head downstairs.\"\n\nThey were able to make good time, not having to worry about their pursuer hearing their footsteps. It was almost certainly invulnerable, but a four-storey fall would at least have knocked the wind out of it.\n\n\"It,\" muttered McInnis. \"What are we calling it?\"\n\n\"Shinoda,\" Kuroki replied. \"That's what the IJAMEA report said.\"\n\nMcInnis frowned. \"If it's an IJAMEA agent, why are all its thoughts about a failed video game company?\" He showed Kuroki the review, which had briefly been illegible before they'd moved one storey down. \n\nKuroki shrugged. \"Maybe it's an IJAMEA agent //and// a video game developer? That dismissal notice said he was returning to civilian life, right?\"\n\nMcInnis barely avoided snapping his fingers. \"Yes. Yes, that's it. The newspaper article in the lobby said the founder was serving in a special forces unit. That was a euphemism for IJAMEA.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Kuroki swung open the door to the second floor, and they emerged gingerly from the stairwell. \"An IJAMEA reality bender founds a video game company. Is that what all this is?\" He gestured at the dim grey hall of computer terminals and filing cabinets around them. \"Are we in one of //his// video games?\"\n\n\"Let's find out.\" McInnis walked up to the nearest cabinet and pulled open the top drawer. \"Assuming all these files are his memories, we should be able to learn something.\"\n\n\"Or we could go downstairs and turn on the elevator, like we planned.\"\n\nMcInnis shook his head. \"You took me upstairs to see the stairs blocked because you knew the dream-game wouldn't let our first route be the correct one. Do you now think it'll let us defeat Shinoda if we don't know his tragic backstory?\"\n\nKuroki's mouth worked for a moment before he replied. \"That's actually pretty clever. You're right.\" He took the filing cabinet at the end of the row, pulling open the bottom drawer. \"Why do I get the feeling this isn't your first rodeo?\"\n\nMcInnis smiled grimly. \"I've been chased through a Site by a monster before.\"\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image TO.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe filing cabinets in the hall were a bust, but they had better luck in an adjoining office. One desk offered up an abundance of expository goodness: an old video game cartridge sitting on a printed email. McInnis nudged the cartridge aside and examined the printout first.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** souma.shinoda@togenkyo.net\n**From:** admin@dwd.net\n**Date:** May 23, 2000\n**Subject:** Training wheels off\n[[/div]]\n------\nShinoda,\n\nI don't know if you get our core brand proposition, but it's not \"normal video games.\" I gave you two million bucks back in '81, and you've given me a steady stream of respectable, functional, not-at-all anomalous shelf-warmers.

He's chasing us. He wants something. What do we have that he wants?\"\n\nKuroki leaned on the filing cabinet. \"I assumed he wanted me, at first. I assumed he attacked the Site to get at me.\"\n\nMcInnis raised an eyebrow. \"Why would he do that?\"\n\nKuroki waved the question away. \"Later. That's not the point. He's been playing, toying with me all this time. He probably could've killed me half a dozen times, but he held back. He's not holding back with you. He wants something from you, specifically.

Why hasn't he come up to attack us?\"\n\n\"Reading is a free action.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\nKuroki smiled. \"In  survival horror games.

He must have seen it somewhere, or somebody told him.\"\n\n\"Which means he thinks Dunn is here, at 79.\" Kuroki cleared his throat. \"But so what? Is he here to kill a competitor? To rescue a friend?\"\n\nMcInnis sat back on a cushion of rustling paper. \"Unless Dunn is connected to Togenkyo somehow.\"\n\n\"Togenkyo?\"\n\nMcInnis blinked. \"Yes. Togenkyo.\" He pulled the Nintendo 64 cartridge out of his pants pocket, and pointed to the logo. \"Shinoda's company. I saw their name on the splash screen for //Hide and Seek// when I first came in.\"\n\nKuroki's eyes were wide. \"Togenkyo is the peach blossom spring, from Japanese and Chinese mythology.\"\n\n\"Okay?\" McInnis picked up one of the shrivelled petals. \"Yes, these are definitely peach blossoms.\"\n\nKuroki reached out to grip his shoulder. \"No, you're not listening. It's not just that. Togenkyo is //paradise//. Know any other names for paradise?\"\n\nMcInnis blinked again. He groaned. He looked down at the sheet. \"Foreign investment capital. Magic.\" He looked up at Kuroki. \"DWD.\"\n\nKuroki nodded. \"Dan 'Wolf' Dunn.\"\n\nThey both spoke at the same time, though they didn't say precisely the same thing.

He must know we're reading the files, and this is what he's doing about it.\"\n\n\"//What// is what he's...\" McInnis stopped in mid-sentence as he noticed the gathering gloom around them. There was a wall of black at the end of the hallway, and it was grinding inexorably closer. It was rippling, roiling like a pot of boiling water, and as the faceless white shapes with their eerie glowing eyes came into view, they both took off at a jog in the opposite direction.\n\n\"Arcadia funded Shinoda's company,\" McInnis grunted. \"He named it after Arcadia. He was grateful.\"\n\n\"Until Arcadia ruined //Ikigai,//\" said Kuroki.\n\n\"Which is why Shinoda is looking for Dunn.\"\n\n\"Who Shinoda thinks you're here to check on...\"\n\n\"...so he thinks I know where Dunn is.

He stood watch while Kuroki tried to activate the elevator, and rifled through the last few scraps of paper they had to explain their present situation. He dropped them one by one, as their contents proved worthless, and they winked out before striking the floor.\n\nHe was still staring at the final sheet when Kuroki finally emerged from the generator room. \"All set.\"\n\nMcInnis passed him the paper, and watched his reaction carefully.\n\n[[table style=\"border-collapse:collapse; margin-bottom:3px; width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"2\"]]\n**TOG03/ARC71/IJA58**\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Status**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nLost\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Demand**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nHigh\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Value**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nHigh\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Availability**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nNone\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Identifier**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nProject KOTODAMA\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; background-color: #7A5E7A; color: #ffffff; padding: 12px; text-align: center\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\n**Description**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: 12px; text-align: left\"  colspan=\"1\"]]\nItem is an electronic apparatus capable of bending space and time in the user's proximity, creating in effect a virtual reality environment.

When he hammered out a few simple commands on a flat-keyed keyboard, which became deep-keyed and mechanical as his fingers struck each key, and a bevelled black box became a widescreen computer monitor with a very confused face on it, he actually laughed out loud.\n\nWhen he had the second copy of the password in his head, and he barrelled back towards the shaft, he suddenly remembered that the car was on the first floor, the bodies were gone and the stairwell was blocked.\n\nThe password entry terminal was on the first floor.\n\n//I hope you're headed down, Kuroki.// McInnis took a deep breath, and spoke into his microphone. \n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image TO.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMcInnis was talking in his ear. McInnis was talking //gibberish.// Kuroki's mind suddenly felt a little more crowded, and he immediately realized what had happened.\n\n//No. Why? No!// The one-time password was in his head. McInnis had to be trapped in the comm center; it was on Kuroki to get back to the terminal now. That would have been fine, if he'd been running down the stairs instead of up them. He could hear the heavy footfalls behind him, slow and regular.\n\n//How the hell am I gonna get around him?//\n\nHe leapt across the next landing, pulled himself up the railing of the next flight of stairs...\n\n...and smacked hard into a pile of stone and metal. He fell back on his ass, ears ringing, and realized he was looking at the back ends of the filing cabinets which had arrested their progress earlier.\n\nHe was certain this wasn't the same staircase, but that didn't matter anymore. As he struggled to his feet, head swimming, he saw the muscular, wrapped figure ascending the stairs blade-first.\n\n\"Are you finally going to do it, Shinoda?\" He had nothing left but words. He was so very, very tired. \"Are you going to shed blood in your paradise?\"\n\n\"//Et in Togenkyo ego,//\" the spectre spat, and pinned him to a filing cabinet straight through his heart.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image TO.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMcInnis stared at the red text hovering over the crown moulding of the comm centre.\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image Died.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWhen he finally noticed the sound of rubble being shifted in the adjoining stairwell, he could barely muster the urge to care.\n\n[[div style=\"height:12px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ready-or-not| previous-title=Ready or Not...\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/spread-the-word | next-title=Spread the Word\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-time-after-time-password-hub  | hub-title=The Time After Time Password\n]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[/=]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** Died.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n\n> **Filename:** Ikigai2.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source:** Reference released CC BY-SA 3.0 by owner (HarryBlank): [http://scptestwiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/sigma%3Aadmonish-yourself/ikigaisource.jpg via PoseMy.Art]\n\n> **Filename:** TO.png\n> **Author:** HarryBlank\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/div]]",
