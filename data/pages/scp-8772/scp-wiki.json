I don't mean its linear progression, or the way we recall, observe, or speculate it, or even the presence of \"alternate\" timelines. I refer to the concept of \"lost\" time.\n\nWe've all stared at clocks, wondering \"where the time went\". Be it at the end of a long day, or a year, or a lifetime, our compressed perception of time cannot seem to grasp any consistency. If it is \"lost\", where did it go? Can one recall it, as one turns to the beginning of a book? If so, can one alter it, increase it? -- or are we doomed forever to be impotent observers? \n\nI wonder.\n\nK.S.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n**Item #:** SCP-8772\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8772 is currently located in the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/groups-of-interest-cn#CC|St. Christina's College's]]] quadrangle[[footnote]]A usually rectangular courtyard surrounded by or mainly occupied by a large building or several smaller buildings.[[/footnote]] and cannot be moved.

Inorganic material, weather, perceptions of time, etc., will revert to reflect their status on that date, but any organism and their relevant memories will be unaffected. The affected area will revert to present time once another SCP-8772-1 event occurs, but by introducing additional tachyon particles into SCP-8772 it is possible to accelerate this process.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n++ Addendum 1\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\nSCP-8772 was created by [[[reg-profile-s11013387|Shek Kwai-chun]]], a then-student of St. Christina's College who gained the ability to \"reality-warp incomplete concepts into complete ones\" after being branded by Gamers Against Weed, according to documentation acquired from the college.

Upon reaching the bell mechanism, Shek noticed it was in an advanced stage of deterioration, which prompted feelings of longing and regret. Shek's anomalous ability manifested and focused on the bell mechanism, reconfiguring concepts of reparation until it had returned to its original state. Observing this, Shek adjusted the mechanism's time, then left the tower and recorded the event. The bell chimed seventeen minutes later.

All of St. Christina's now knows about the \"time loop\" that sets everything back; it's become something of an event, like a holiday.

It's become a bit garish, to be honest, and I've found myself becoming more and more blase about it. I didn't even mean for all this to happen; I was just reminiscing. But maybe that's what we're all doing here, as we grow and move on with our lives. As humans move forward, they like looking back; they like seeing where that time \"went\"; they like knowing that the comfortable and familiar is there, waiting for them, to be remembered and revisited.// ||\n\n@@ @@\n\n__Note:__ Various extraneous documents and records have been removed.\n\n@@ @@\n\n||||||||~ - 2017/03/25 -||\n||||||~ Situation||Shek makes observations on the four-year anniversary of reconfiguring the Clock Tower's bell mechanism as he prepares to graduate from St. Christina's.||\n||||||~ Remarks|| //I've come to an epiphany as I prepare to conclude my studies. Interest in the past isn't merely historical; a return to \"simpler times\" implies there was a period in our lives where we had no responsibility, no obligation, nothing to worry and trouble ourselves with other than what little the day demanded. We (in our pasts) could fill our time with idle leisure while others shouldered those aforementioned burdens. Only by growing and taking on the mantle of adulthood do we yearn for what has passed, as if we had to sacrifice something for an inheritance. We miss the simplicity, the perceived freedom. We want to take back what was lost.//||\n||||||~ ... || //What I have (inadvertently) done amounts to little more than an interactive film strip, a movie or television show that we've seen before, playing ad nauseum every two months. We can no more influence this past than we can influence the outcome of the film:  we can only observe.  I think, maybe, giving the campus and its student body the opportunity to understand this might help them shake off this yearning.  Maybe we only really \"lose\" this time by wondering where it went:  when we stand idle, rather than be productive; when we look back, and not move forward.  All right, so that's a little maudlin, but is it wrong?   We've got to...  I've got to look ahead now.  That's what today is about, right?

When the Foundation wiped everyone's memories of the incident away, coincidentally or not, the temporal loop ceased being an issue. It was contained; it was forgotten about.
