Although the records of this are usually private, that doesn't stop staff from ruminating about his past life, his attachment to work, and his strange behaviors.\n\nBut discussion regarding his person is no match for those that focus on those that attempt to probe into the mind of this person and the intentions he has for Facility-57 and the Region itself. Reserved and quiet about his moves, some accuse him of resting his feet on an impenetrable ivory tower that he might one day turn into the lair of his tyranny, one that would make the Ancient One even more missed.\n\nIndifferent to rumors and criticism, Venceslao silently continues on his way; perhaps not a politician, but a man of science and action.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"ERROR‎\" hide=\"‏‏‎ ‎\"]]\n\n----\n\n**Background:**\n\nReserved and distant, the man who calls himself Yerko Venceslao is a strange and mysterious figure to most of the staff who always see him performing different jobs throughout the Site-34, from cook, receptionist or researcher, to simply a janitor, among others.\n\nThose who have approached him have had varying degrees of success, from those who can't understand what he is trying to say, to those who manage to have long and fluent conversations. One thing that always recurs is the ominous, nostalgic regrets about his past, but which he never wants or succeeds in revealing.\n\nOccasionally, he will tell some people that he already knew them before, and will say facts to prove it that are usually incorrect but close to the truth, but sometimes they are right. This includes people he is meeting for the first time.\n\nSometimes mistaken for an anomalous apparition, some concerned investigators and agents have reported his presence or tried to investigate him closely but it has never been possible to prove that he possesses paranormal abilities.\n\nHis true position at the Site is a mystery ignored by those closest to him, and the reasons why he is allowed to continue wandering the facility are an even greater unknown. Either way, Venceslao is still there, always there, working on something, mostly in silence.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Canon]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name= http://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme:i-57/I-57-Logo.png|caption=Canon Isotype|width=225px]]\n\n+ Facility-57\n\n**[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/i-57-hub Facility-57]** is a ES' canon about alternative history in which The Foundation is controlled both by its members and by the presidents of the regions of the world into which it is divided. The answer to a series of questions: \"What if The Foundation had not been clandestine? What if it had been politicized? What if it were organized into regions? What good and what harm would governments do by mixing their interests with those of The Foundation?\", among many others.\n\nWhile the DNA of the canon is politics, a fundamental part of it is also the resulting scenario of its history away from the underground. In other words, not only is it important how Interest Groups and Anomalous Communities govern and organize their societies, but equally important are the consequences of their decisions in people.\n\nThis leaves us with a wide range of possibilities, from the administrative meetings of the Foundation's top officials, to the consequences that a dictatorship can have for the anomalous families, to the geopolitical war that develops when large groups wish to have control, power, or monopoly over the anomalous world behind the Veil.\n\nIn short, the world is full of tyrants and dreamers. I wonder which of the two groups you belong to.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab About]]\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://lafundacionscp.wdfiles.com/local--files/dc-yerko/Yo.png|caption=Soy ese|width=300px]]\n\nMy name is Yerko, and I make attempts at writing for people who are pretty without trying.\n\nI mainly focus on creating stories that inside my mind look like little movies, but sometimes I also make smaller articles that may or may not end up being part of something else, sometimes I just like to have a little fun and create short stories as glimpses of interactions between personnel or characters of my friends, and sometimes I just like to do what my heart tells me to do.\n\nI may not be the person with the most original ideas, and many times the topics I like to touch on have already been touched on by dozens or hundreds before, but whenever I do something, I always look to give it a twist, or add a detail that makes it different. Sometimes it will turn out better, sometimes it will turn out worse, but I always try to put a little bit of myself into what I do.\n\nI've been in this hobby for many years, writing a lot, but deleting more, too much more. If you knew how many drafts I have in both digital and physical format that I deleted or never got around to publishing, you wouldn't be able to count them, or at least I'm not able to.\n\nStill, I have fun writing, and I love getting to that point where I feel good enough about something to show it to you guys, and see what you think of what I've done. Votes are fine and all, but it's in your comments, in your discussion, in your time, in your art, and in your emotions that I find my greatest and most sincere happiness.\n\nPerhaps saying that writing is just a hobby for me can feel like a lie and an insult to my own heart, and while it may be more comfortable to delude myself, the truth is that life sometimes demands different paths if we want something as simple as survival. If dreams could come true, I would eat from writing and live from listening to what they might say about my writings.\n\nAlthough reason tells me that these are desires of impossible things, I pursue every day, with every writing and publication, this dream that rests at the end of a road full of time bombs. If you wish to help me, --[https://ko-fi.com/dc_yerko here is my kofi]-- I will always want to hear your comments. You can find all my articles in the My Writings section above.\n\nRegardless of how uncertain the future may be, there is one thing I will always know about tomorrow, and that is that I will be forever grateful for my time here with all of you.\n\nPEPSIE\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
