This space stores four prehensile appendages when said appendages are not in use. According to SCP-4197, this condition predates its knowledge of the cytomatic arts, a fact corroborated by photographs taken from its family home. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |blur-reveal=--]\n|blur-amount=1.5\n|speed=200\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=250px\n|url=sarah\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=A demonstrative depiction of SCP-4197 by Doctor Turner[[footnote]]Due to SCP-4197's anatomy, and ethical concerns about showing photographs of it in various states of undress, an artistic representation was deemed an appropriate replacement.[[/footnote]].\n]]\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-4197 came to the Foundation's attention after a news outlet reported that an American surgeon removed several brain tumors from a twelve-year-old boy in Botswana, with the child making a full recovery in less than two days. SCP-4197 was apprehended the following week outside of Gaborone, where it was dispensing mosquito netting and anti-malarial drugs to the populace. SCP-4197 surrendered without a struggle and has cooperated with Foundation inquires, with some reluctance.\n\nAccording to its passport and journals, SCP-4197 had spent four years traveling through impoverished countries, where it performed an unknown number of surgeries; utilizing cytomancy to aid its procedures. \n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"View Recovered Files\" hide=\"FILES_CORRUPTED\"]]\n{{Please Contact Your System Administrator | Local Files Corrupted}}\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[!--\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:96.5%; padding:10px\"]]\n**CORRUPTED_VIDEO_LOG**\n\n**Date:** UNKNOWN\n\n**Location:** VEERS_ESTATE\n-----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n//[Camera shows a young girl playing with a dog in a hedged garden.

SCP-4197 was provided with standard medical equipment, as well as the necessary materials for cytomatic rituals.\n\n> \n> **Subject:** D-24729\n> \n> **Condition Present:** Severe tendon and ligament damage related to employment in the construction/restoration sectors as a civilian. \n> \n> **Procedure Conducted:** SCP-4197 placed its hand on D-24729's forehead, causing him to become unconscious. It then removed a scalpel from the kit provided and made four incisions on the side of the knees and the interior of the elbow. SCP-4197 drew a sigil in oil paint around each site, which halted the flow of blood. Following this, SCP-4197 took several portions of bull sinew and inserted them into D-24729's wounds. After drawing a larger sigil on D-24729's chest, it began to suture the incisions. \n> \n> **Outcome:** D-24729 reported immediate relief from his chronic pain. \n> \n> \n\n> \n> **Subject:** Doctor Richard Blanc\n> \n> **Condition Present:** Spontaneous kidney failure and acute blood poisoning. Emergency procedure conducted due to Site-12's remoteness.\n> \n> **Procedure Conducted:** SCP-4197 drew a sigil on Dr. Blanc's ankle with an appendage, using its own blood, before creating a one-centimeter incision in the center of the sigil and placing a shallow basin beneath it. Black liquid began to seep out of the wound. After administering a blood transfusion via IV, SCP-4197 made two incisions above Dr. Blanc's kidneys with a scalpel. SCP-4197 then used the scalpel to carve symbols associated with the Sarkic cults into the back of its hands, crying out in pain several times. After composing itself, SCP-4197 reached into Dr. Blanc's torso and removed his kidneys with its bare hands. It then took the kidneys, which were blackened and showed severe scarring, and wrung them out over the basin. After two minutes, the kidneys were reinserted into Dr. Blanc and SCP-4197 sutured the wounds. \n> \n> **Outcome:** Doctor Richard Blanc experienced a full recovery, with no side effects. The basin used in the surgery was found to contain a black liquid comprised of toxins usually filtered by the kidneys. SCP-4197 exhibited symptoms consistent with severe sleep deprivation and slept for the next three days.\n> \n> \n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**Interview-02[[footnote]]Interview-01 consisted primarily of inquires about SCP-4197's ability and identity.

How are you doing today?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** I'm doing pretty well, Dr. uh... Turner. \n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** I assume you're at least well-rested.\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** You don't need to small talk me. I know what you're gonna ask, so go for it. \n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Your hands. That wasn't normal cytomancy. You carved a Sarkic symbol into them. Are you-\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** A fleshcrafter? Yes. No. Not really. I can do Nälkä rituals but I'm not a practic- Why? Is that //important// or something? \n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Well-\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Sorry. I didn't mean to sound hostile. I'm just //really// hungry and my hands ache... Thanks for bandaging them, by the way.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** It was the least we could do. //[Pause.]// Would you like me to call for some food?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Yeah. I'd like that.\n> \n> **<Interview halted for thirty minutes.>**\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Better?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Much better.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** So. Are you a Karcist?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** I think you mean Orin or Zend. Karcists are the priest-types. But in any official capacity, no. I'm not //ordained// or anything\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Then how did you learn your craft?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** My //craft// is medicine; I'm a surgeon by trade. But I learned how to do cytomancy from a Karcist, if that answers your question.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Not really. The Veers family is rich, but there's no real connection to Sarkicism. And you're too good to have learned recently. \n> \n> **SCP-4197:** It... it was a family friend. She started teaching me when I was like six. Maybe she saw something in me. Or maybe it was...\n> \n> //[A wet sound can be heard, as well as the tearing of fabric.]//\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** These.\n> \n> **Dr. Tuner:** //[Gulps.]// And you've had those-\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Since birth. You already found my baby pictures. Why keep asking?\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Because it-\n> \n> //[A wet sound is heard again]//\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** Nevermind. Look, if a Karcist singled you out at a young age for training, why aren't you a practicing member? Or a member of her company? An advisor to her Halkost? \n> \n> **SCP-4197:** I am. A //member of her company//, that is. Kinda? //[Pause.]// Look, I know you have these blanket generalizations of what a Nälkä is, but we're not all monsters. Not all of us delight in murder or... cannibalism. There are a lot of people like me, young Nälkä, who want to do something to fix the world. We have this incredible power, the ability to reshape living matter, and we just squander it.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** How would you use it?\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Like I've //been// using it. For the past four years, I've used the Veers family fortune and my fleshcrafting to make a positive difference in the world.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** That's the issue. Your Sarkic rituals put the world at risk of knowing about the supernatural, the anomalous, the paranormal. If you'd just used the fortune, nothing would have happened.\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** No amount of money can pull a tumor out of somebody's heart with a 100% guarantee of survival. The first thing they tell you in medical school is that you are //going// to lose people. I know Sarkicism is like the Dark Side of the Force to you people, but if it means I can save lives, so be it.\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** The morality of cytomancy isn't the concern of the Foundation. It's the disruption of normalcy.\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Why do you get to be the arbiters of what's considered normal? \n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** I'm never gonna leave here, am I?\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n> \n> **Closing Statement:** SCP-4197 declined further interviews and limited its interaction with staff to brief sentences. \n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n> \n> **Subject:** Captain Tobias Bell\n> \n> **Condition Present:** Massive comminuted fractures in the legs and complete paralysis after the destruction of the spinal column between the C4 and L4 vertebrae in a vehicular collision. \n> \n> **Procedure Conducted:** SCP-4197 engraved a seven-pointed star into the operating table, placing a single drop of axolotl blood[[footnote]]Extracted via syringe.[[/footnote]] in the center, before instructing attendants to place Cpt. Bell on the table. SCP-4197 then ran its fingernail across Cpt. Bell's thighs and calves, causing the skin and muscle to split and splay out. Over the next two hours, SCP-4197 reassembled the splinters of his femur, patella, tibia, and fibula with surgical tweezers, utilizing all of its appendages in this process. Once completed, SCP-4197 held the split muscle and skin together with its left thumb and forefinger, licked its right thumb and ran it over the seam, sealing the wound.\n> \n> SCP-4197 repeated this process with Cpt. Bell's spinal column, taking additional measures to ensure the proper reconnection of nerves and blood vessels. \n> \n> **Outcome:** Captain Tobias Bell was reinstated to active duty two weeks later.

Take Captain Bell for example. Because of his actions, he's saved countless lives. You've given him back his ability to walk, Sarah. And play with his kids.\n> \n> **SCP-4197:** Well, what about D-2... What was it?\n> \n> **Dr. Turner:** D-24729 killed someone in a home robbery because he was addicted to opioids after a lifetime in working in disaster cleanups and restoration.
