Imagine it in as much detail as possible. Think of every note played on the piano in the corner; picture the plush weight of the stool as you take your seat. Picture me behind the counter. Look at me, and, within your mind's eye, say the following:\n\n\"Shoot me a waco, doctor.\"\n\nHold on to the image as long as you can. If it remains at the front of your mind when the pill is ingested, your memory will not be lost.\n\nWith love,\nDr. Charles Alderton, Practicing Alchemist\n\n--]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails code=--]]\n\n[[module CSS]]\n.email-example .collapsible-block-folded a.collapsible-block-link {\n    animation: blink 0.8s ease-in-out infinite alternate;\n}\n@keyframes blink {\n    0% { color: transparent; }\n    50%, 100% { color: #b01; }\n}\n.email {border: solid 2px #000000; width: 88%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.5)}\n.email-example a.collapsible-block-link {font-weight: bold;}\n.tofrom {margin-left: 10px; margin-top: 5px; padding: 1px 15px; border-left: solid 3px maroon}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ LEGACY ARCHIVE PROJECT\n++ DIGITIZED REPORT\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[table style=\"border: none; width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 125%]]**Designation:** 7523[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[[size 125%]]###990000|**Report Originates: 1897**##[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n[[size 125%]]**Classification:** Safe[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[[size 125%]]###990000|**Procedures Unchanged**##[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"\nclass=\"mz-img-wrap img-frame ]]\n[[include component:image-block\nname=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/%22Charles_Alderton%22.png/2000px-%22Charles_Alderton%22.png\n|caption=Dr. Charles Alderton, creator of SCP-7523.\n]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures --**\nDr. Charles Alderton, after being brought under the Foundation's employ, has freely assisted in the containment and concealment of SCP-7523.

Due in large part to the beverage's anomalous qualities, it saw rapid financial success, and the Company quickly expanded its operations throughout East Texas.\n\nIn 1887, Foundation operatives first received reports of sudden shifts in beliefs and values among Texas residents, corresponding to the exponential growth of the Dr Pepper Company. A fact-finding mission launched in August of that year uncovered documentation connecting Alderton to multiple known alchemists and alchemist groups, at which point he was formally apprehended.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ A RECORD OF THE FIRST INTERROGATION BETWEEN OFFICER GLENN WALKER, FOUNDATION OPERATIVE, AGAINST DR. CHARLES ALDERTON, IN THE YEAR OF 1887\n\n//Begin.//\n\n**Walker --** Alderton. Have a seat.\n\n//Walker and Alderton each sit at opposing ends of a table.//\n\n**Alderton --** Have I done something wrong, officer?\n\n**Walker --** Are you responsible for the chemical formula to Dr. Pepper's Phos-Ferrates?\n\n**Alderton --** Yes.\n\n**Walker --** Are you aware of the beverage's effect on its customers?\n\n**Alderton --** A promoted sense of health and enjoyment. Might I interest you in a case?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Alderton --** Yes, I kid. Dr Pepper is a... persuasive beverage. The alchemy is uncomplicated, but its application here is unique, as far as I can tell. It bends belief to my favor.\n\n**Walker --** Well. Thank you for your cooperation. Could you tell us //why// you set out to create such a product?\n\n**Alderton --** Financial gain, pure and simple. I intended to cheat the market by way of mental manipulation.\n\n**Walker --** ...You're awfully straightforward with this information.\n\n**Alderton --** You seem surprised. Did you expect me not to take a man of your position seriously?\n\n//Prolonged silence.//\n\n**Alderton --** I see. Still becoming acquainted with the role, are we? Perhaps a new recruit?\n\n**Walker --** If we... //(unintelligible)// If we could remain on topic, please.\n\n**Alderton --** Of course.\n\n**Walker --** Would you be willing to provide full receipts for the sale and distribution of your product?\n\n**Alderton --** I would. It appears, however, that I could do quite a lot more for you than that.\n\n//Walker stands.//\n\n**Walker --** Nothing more will be necessary.\n\n**Alderton --** Officer, will all due respect, I see a wonderful opportunity for our interests to align.\n\n**Walker --** We are not concerned with your interests.\n\n**Alderton --** Oh, but //I// am concerned with //yours//! If I assume correctly, you are some manner of organization seeking to... silence the impossible, yes? My beverage defies reason, which is why you are interested? And your presence explains the disappearance of many of my fellow alchemists?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Alderton --** There is no need for secrets at this point, officer. I've suspected an organization such as yours may exist for some time now, and regardless, if I'm correct, you almost certainly intend to kill me anyways.\n\n//Walker returns to his seat.//\n\n**Walker --** You are correct on all counts.\n\n**Alderton --** Excellent! Then you must see how my services could be invaluable to you!\n\n**Walker --** Elaborate.\n\n**Alderton --** I imagine your operation must be militant, and that a great deal of effort and resources must be dedicated to the disappearance of those like me, who have seen the impossible. Yes?\n\n**Walker --** Yes.\n\n**Alderton --** Therefore, I assume it would benefit you greatly to have a means of... //un-seeing// the impossible.\n\n**Walker --** I don't understand.\n\n**Alderton --** Pray tell - what is the difference between having a memory and //believing// yourself to have a memory?\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Walker --** None.\n\n**Alderton --** Exactly! Suppose I were to make some adjustments to my formula. Suppose, rather than introducing a belief in policies that benefit me and my company, Dr Pepper introduced a belief that, say, nothing particularly unusual has happened to the consumer within the past week. And suppose that, rather than gradually, its effects set in immediately.\n\n**Walker --** You're suggesting that it's possible to induce targeted amnesia.\n\n**Alderton --** I'm suggesting something identical in practice, yes.\n\n**Walker --** And you seek to accomplish this through a carbonated soft drink.\n\n**Alderton --** It need not be administered by glass. Only a drop of the formula would be necessary, possibly administered by pill. Regardless of form, though, think of the //effect.// If you want to hide the unusual, a few adjustments are all it would take for Dr Pepper to become your veil. I was able to deduce your organization's existence before you apprehended me. How would you like me to be the last one? How would you like to be the //reason// I am the last one?\n\n**Walker --** What prevents you from, as you say, making it bend belief in your favor once again?\n\n**Alderton --** Nothing would compel you to ingest the formula yourself, and if it does anything other than what I have promised, nothing prevents you from killing me as planned. Make no mistake, I am bartering for my life.\n\n**Walker --** ...We will be collecting your receipts now, Dr. Alderton. I will mention your proposal to my superiors tonight.\n\n**Alderton --** Much obliged.\n\n//End.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAlderton showed an immediate willingness to cooperate, providing full receipts for the sale and distribution of SCP-7523. All known instances of SCP-7523 were either confiscated or destroyed over the course of the following year.\n\nAlderton's proposal for a beneficial variant of SCP-7523 was tentatively approved. The variant was produced in 1888, and was fully incorporated into Foundation operations by 1890. The vast majority of remaining instances of SCP-7523 were used in the development and refinement of the variant.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"ATTACHED MESSAGES: (8) UNREAD\" hide=\"X\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= mmadison@scp.lap.int\n|to= all:scp.lap.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= Test\n]]\n\nThis is a test email.

The leak takes the form of two objects: one available to the general public, and one commonly used by the Foundation. As a side effect (or maybe as an intended consequence) of the leak, the latter causes most Foundation personnel to be permanently unaware of the former. I do not know the direct relationship between the two objects, but I would hazard a guess that under chemical analysis they would be almost identical.\n\nI am requesting authorization to forward a report to antimemetics.

I don't know what to do.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Murphy Madison\n|title= Transcription Assistant, Legacy Archive Project\n|signoff= Sent 10.14.22\n|signoff-icon=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n++++ A RECORD OF THE INTERROGATION BETWEEN ADMINISTRATOR M.H. FOLKESTONE, RESIDENT SITE AUTHOURITY, AND DR. CHARLES ALDERTON, CHIEF SCIENTIFIC OFFICER, AGAINST OFFICER GLENN WALKER, IN THE YEAR OF 1897\n//Begin.//\n\n//Folkestone and Alderton enter Walker's office.//\n\n**Walker --** Doctor! ...Administrator. Is there a problem, gentlemen?\n\n**Alderton --** Administrator Folkestone pulled me aside to share some... //inconsistencies// within the Department of Self-Concealing Items.\n\n**Walker --** Inconsistencies?\n\n//Folkestone places a stack of papers on Walker's desk.//\n\n**Folkestone --** We've discovered invoices attributed to the Department transferring funds and resources to a private corporation - albiet one suspiciously omitted from all documentation.\n\n**Walker --** What?\n\n**Alderton --** Folkestone showed me the evidence, and while most of it had been redacted or defaced, I cannot disagree with his assessment. We have evidence of embezzlement, smuggling, fraternization, and breaches of confidentiality originating in 1890 - the year //you// were promoted to director.\n\n**Folkestone --** It goes further. We have encoded messages, attributed to your office, containing confidential information. Updates on Foundation proceedings. Directions on where to move to avoid detection. You've been collaborating with people on the outside, it seems.\n\n**Walker --** I //honestly// have no idea what you're referring to.\n\n**Folkestone --** As Dr. Alderton has already proposed, that may be true regardless of your guilt.\n\n**Walker --** How so?\n\n**Alderton --** Glenn, have you or have you not requested amnestics for personal use?\n\n**Walker --** ...Everyone has by now.\n\n**Folkestone --** Answer directly, director.\n\n**Walker --** //Yes//! Where is all this coming from? Are you really accusing me of crimes against the Foundation //and// of cleansing them from my own mind?\n\n**Alderton --** A person in your seat of authority would have ample opportunity to take advantage for personal benefit. If you could remove your own guilt, your own //accountability//, from the matter, then all the better, yes? What was it you called my formula, around when we first met? A \"confidence?\"\n\n//Walker stands.//\n\n**Walker --** //You// called it that, doctor! Furthermore, //it did not succeed for that purpose//!\n\n**Alderton --** I'm afraid your memory deceives you, director.\n\n**Walker --** //And whose fault is that//?\n\n**Folkestone --** Enough of this! Walker, you are now under detainment for suspected acts against the interests of the Foundation.\n\n**Walker --** You have nothing to detain me on! Why would I go against my station? I gave my life to this organization!\n\n**Alderton --** From my perspective, all you've ever done is defer the real work to //me.//\n\n**Walker --** Because I //trust// you! Because I //admire what you do//! Look me in the eyes, doctor! You trust me, do you not? You know I wouldn't do this!\n\n//Alderton turns away.//\n\n**Walker --** I-\n\n//Prolonged silence.//\n\n**Walker --** I wouldn't do this. Would I? //Tell me I wouldn't do this.//\n\n**Folkestone --** Walker, come with me. Alderton, search through Walker's amnestics requests and compare them to our invoices. If your theory is correct, the dates will align.\n\n**Alderton --** With pleasure, administrator.\n\n//End.//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[collapsible show=\"ATTACHED MESSAGES: (1) UNREAD\" hide=\"X\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= cbraun@scp.lap.int\n|to= all:scp.lap.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= On Murphy Madison's Absence\n]]\n\nHello all,\n\nAs some of you already know, Murphy Madison has been admitted to Site-19's psychiatric help center and will be out of office for the immediate future.\n\nWhile I cannot speak to any details, I am happy to report that they have responded well to amnestics and are already eager to return.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Dr. Carmen Braun\n|title= Director, Legacy Archive Project\n|signoff= Sent 10.20.22\n|signoff-icon=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** \"Charles_Alderton\".png\n> **Name:** Charles Alderton\n> **Author:** Gagaherdrere\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:%22Charles_Alderton%22.png\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
