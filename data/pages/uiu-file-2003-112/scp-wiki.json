Background\n\nOn 7/13/2003, paramedics and local police were called to the campus of Deer College in Three Portlands to respond to several incidents of drug overdose arising during an early Bastille Day party being held in the student dorms. When first responders arrived at the scene, they found a large number of young adults present, most of them students at Deer College, nearly all showing signs of significant substance intoxication; five persons were found comatose, and were unable to be revived by paramedics. They were taken to the nearby St. Hedwig's Hospital, where three of them were immediately declared brain-dead. Medical thaumaturges were able to stabilize the remaining two victims by replacing the entire volume of their circulatory system, although not before they had already suffered neurological damage.\n\nBastille Day is a popular holiday throughout Three Portlands; not coincidentally, more misdemeanors and public order crimes occur on the weekend of Bastille Day than any other three-day period in the months of June, July, and August. With most resources presently tied-up in responding to other Bastille Day incidents, the Three Portlands Police Department has requested that the Unusual Incidents Unit assume responsibility for the investigation of the overdoses at Deer College. The public nature of the incident, combined with the social status of the victims, has generated a significant amount of public interest and outrage. To avoid a deterioration of relations between the UIU and the city's residents, Assistant Director Mallory has publicly indicated that the investigation is of high priority.\n\n+++ 2. Current Status\n\nThe Three Portlands field office has launched a major narcotics investigation to discover the source of the drugs used in the overdoses, with the ultimate aim of apprehending the persons responsible for their production and distribution. A number of students who attended the party were detained by 3PPD officers on charges of excessive public intoxication; however, questioning has so far produced very little coherent information, and it is doubtful that this avenue will yield any significant leads.\n\nWhile a request has been made asking any students with pertinent information to come forward, it is not expected that many, if any, students will inform on their dealers. A warrant is currently being sought to conduct a more thorough search of the Deer College dormitories and the belongings of the students who attended the party, which may expose elements of the narcotics ring operating on the campus. Security cameras are absent in most areas of Three Portlands due to public opinion; as such, identifying suspects may be difficult.\n\n\n+++ 3. Leads\n\nSeveral milligrams of an unknown chemical substance, believed to be the drug involved in the overdoses, were recovered in a search of the rooms of the comatose students. Preliminary forensic testing at the local field office was unable to identify the substance, which does not correspond to any currently known mundane or paranormal narcotic. A sample of the substance has been sent to ICSUT Portlands for more extensive analysis by their laboratories, which may yield useful information about its composition and origin.\n\nDoctor Irene Seward at St. Hedwig's made it known to investigators that she had observed similar cases of drug overdose several months prior, although they had attracted little attention at the time. A review of the hospital records, as well as the records of other public hospitals in the city, is currently underway; this may shed further light on its source and the mechanism of its distribution.\n\nThe 3PPD officers who first responded to the call performed a cursory search of the scene at the time, resulting in the seizure of a large quantity of illicit substances and illegal materials. Among the items impounded as evidence was the corpse of an American bullfrog, which had been provided with a paper crown and then ceremonially guillotined as part of the Bastille Day celebrations. The moment of the frog's death has been identified as a potential source of Aspect Radiation, and forensic thaumatologists are currently working to construct an aetheric image of the party at that particular point in time based on the patterns of microbacklash in the local aura. Moreover, long-term proximity to the Deer campus may have given the frog an abnormal degree of sentience and awareness; to this end, a necromancy specialist is being brought in from the Miami field office to attempt a //nekyia// to interrogate the frog's spirit.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Collected Evidence]]\n\n----\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Interview Transcript\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewee**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nJeremiah/King Louis XVI\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewers**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nAgents Quinn Law and Andrew Harris\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Interview&nbsp;Date>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n07/18/2003\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Session&nbsp;#>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n01\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n----\n\n> //[Mumbling and ectoplasmic slopping is heard as Agent Law performs the// nekyia.//]//\n> \n> **Harris:** Hello, do you know where you are?\n> \n> **Jeremiah:** //Ribbit//.\n> \n> **Harris:** //[muffled, towards Law]// Could you adjust the ritual circle so, yeah?

I had just stopped by Reggie's pad, and was hopping home from the pond, bringing home a belly full of flies for the missus and kids, and I get jumped, right?

I start hearing muffled voices again. One of the voices was new, and really deep, like a bullfrog in heat, and it looked like it had two golden eyes, piercing through the bag. After that, the awful noise starts up again, and I start hearing croaking far away, must of been getting dark. Soon after that, I get dumped outta the bag in this big fucking room.

But after I hopped off the mortal plane, I stuck around a bit, y’know? Hoping to see what they did with my body, hopefully giving them a sick stomach if they ate me. But all most of them did was put some shit in their eyes and conked right out. Couple of hours later, a few of the brats woke up, saw some others weren’t moving, and hoofed it outta there like there was no tomorrow.\n> \n> **Harris:** And right after this is when school faculty discovered the bodies and called us, right?\n> \n> **Jeremiah:** Right as rain.\n> \n> **Harris:** Thank you for your cooperation, Jerry.

The impurities, compounded with excessive amounts used by the five students are the most likely contributing factors to the overdoses.\n\nWodin is part of a family of paranarcotics known collectively as The Gods' Eyes. The Gods' Eyes were first discovered after Prometheus Labs' synthesis of Horus, a combat-enhancing drug which differs from Wodin primarily in terms of the conformational isomer of fourth-dimensional dimethyl chains on each end of the molecule. After Prometheus Labs' liquidation, many assets, including Horus and its recipe, were purchased by Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., whom then developed a modified variant, from combat-oriented to a recreational drug. MC&D then sold the new drug in bulk to an as-of-now unidentified third party.\n\nWodin allows the user to view the perspective of an alternate version of themselves, specifically seeking out alternate versions of the user that possess high levels of seratonin, dopamine, endorphins, or oxytocin. While not directly possessing the alternate self's body, Wodin allows for the sharing of the alternate self's perspective and emotional state, due to the syncing of the user's and doppleganger's hormonal and sensory centers of the brain.\n\nBased on conjecture from one of the medical staff's personal experiences, the five students that overdosed experienced cognitive-whiplash from large impure quantities that shattered their identities in differing degrees of severity across multiple alternate selves. These alternate selves would have received detrimental disorders such as conflicting memories, personality shifts, alien hand syndrome, extreme migraines, and in a few cases, fatal stroke.^^##blue|1##^^ Collaboration of ICSUT colleagues from affected timelines is recommended for further study of the effects of //diacetyl yggdracetate//, due to the relative understudied nature of The Gods' Eyes.\n\n------\n##blue|1.## Ferrario V. (2002) \"The Causes and Effects of the Increase in Paranormal Mental Illnesses from 1990-2000\"; //ICSUT Journal of Medicine// Vol 15(4); pp 13-23\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n\n++ Recovered Prometheus Labs Documentation\n\n\n**GRANT REQUEST FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHARMACEUTICALS ALLOWING FOR TACTICAL DECISION-MAKING BASED ON THE OBSERVATION OF ALTERNATE SELVES**\n\n**Problem:** The majority of casualties in theaters of war, particularly in guerilla warfare, are caused by split-second hesitations within combat, or by failing to anticipate and adapt to changes on the battlefield. Many soldiers, when faced with a seemingly impossible challenge where survival is improbable, tend to rout or surrender, even near the completion of objectives or victory.\n\nWhile precognitive softwares and technologies have made leaps and bounds over recent decades,^^1^^ the smallest changes in variables and scenarios can lead to unforeseen outcomes devastating to friendly forces, and even the most reasonable estimates suggest that a perfect predictive algorithm is still at the very least thirty years away.^^2^^ As such, there needs to be a quick, efficient, real-time solution to this obstacle for well-being of military personnel and the expediency of combat.\n\n**Solution:** We propose a pharmaceutical product distributed to infantry in hostile territory for limited use in extreme conditions. Following research in the Amazon Jungle focusing on a particular species of salamander,^^3^^ we have experienced quantum leaps in the effects of chemical compounds on the dorsolateral prefrontal right cortex. Due to these advancements, we believe that it is possible for human cognition to cross temporal boundaries and experience the perspective of an alternate version of themselves, and take action according to these observations.\n\nPer an //in situ// dissection of the aforementioned salamander, it was discovered that the species produces a hitherto unknown protein, expanding into fourth-dimensional space, that temporarily inhibits the cognitive sense of TVM (This Very Moment)^^4^^ and TVS (This Very Space), uncoupling the individual's consciousness from its current body. The individual's consciousness is then sent \"sideways\" through parallel timelines and/or universes, observing multiple versions of itself perform slightly different actions, and then taking the action with the best short-term success. A side effect of the inhibition of TVM also means that the individual experiences time at a relativistic rate comparatively to an outsider's perspective, allowing the individual to experience days or months within seconds, or vice versa.\n\nThis pharmaceutical would allow commanders to take decisive action in relatively short amounts of time, leading their squadrons through the safest route possible, avoiding gunfire and potentially lethal traps and obstacles, coming to a decisive victory based on the collation of a potentially infinite number of scenarios playing out in alternate timelines.\n\n[...]\n\n**Known Issues:** Due to the nature of the protein, the expense of manufacture will be significantly higher than other pharmaceuticals, and the relative complexity of the protein means there is significantly less margin for error during the manufacturing process. A projected 20% of product could be rendered unusable or hazardous due to human error or minute process variations.\n\n[...]\n\n------\n##blue|1.## Turing, A.

Current Status\n\nThere is a possibility of a full recovery for the two surviving students, pending communications with parallel Deer College faculty. Anderson Robotics has offered to assist with the loaning of their highest-quality soul receptacles to collect the victims' consciousness within, in exchange for the cooperation of Deer College faculty on an unrelated carno-metallurgy binding project.\n\nFollowing testimony given by witnesses, it has been concluded that there are multiple potential districts where victims could have purchased the paranarcotics within the given timeframe.\n\nWithin recent days, there has been mounting tension between the public and the UIU. The public is vocal about demanding updates and progress reports on the investigation. However, Assistant Director Mallory has made a public declaration that no updates will be shared to avoid compromising the investigation efforts. Reports of harassment of UIU and 3PPD officers by Three Portland citizens have increased, but officers and agents are ordered not to retaliate.\n\n+++ 2. Leads\n\nJudging by the description of the drug dealer from one of the witnesses, it has been determined that the dealer was a repurposed door-to-door near-sentient salesgolem. Representatives of Golemancy United, proprietary owners of the construct, have fervently denied publicly any and all allegations of the tampering of their products, excepting acts of Divine Will. However, the representative admitted in private that a number of their golems did not return from their designated routes through Theia Central several weeks prior, where they were soliciting various Carts and household items.\n\n3PPD officers were dispatched to apprehend likely suspects for interrogation. Officers discovered a salesgolem hidden by multiple trashbags within an alleyway in the Docks District, offering Wodin in exchange for legal tender. As the Docks District is close to Deer Campus, it is highly likely that the golem was the one responsible for selling the paranarcotics to the victims. While its identification rune was partially sanded off, enough remained to prove without a doubt that it was one of Golemancy United's missing units. The golem was brought in for questioning.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Collected Evidence]]\n\n\n----\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Recorded Cases of Wodin Overdoses, January-July 2003\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=]]\n//Statistics Courtesy of St. Hedwig's Hospital//\n[[/=]]\n||~ District ||~ # of Overdoses ||~ # of Deaths ||\n|| Docks District || 50 || 32 ||\n|| Little Avalon || 38 || 21 ||\n|| Theia Central || 27 || 13 ||\n|| Jurassic District || 14 || 8 ||\n|| Deer Campus || 5 || 3 ||\n|| Anderson Robotics Employee Housing || 4 || 1 ||\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Interview Transcript\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewee**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nזהוב Golem No. 531  \n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Interviewers**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nAgents Quinn Law and Andrew Harris\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Interview&nbsp;Date>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n07/21/2003\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n----\n> **Harris:** Hello, Number Five-Three-One.\n> \n> **No. 531:** Good morning, good sir and lady!

Background\n\nOn 07/22/03 at 9:30 PM EST, following the interrogation of the stolen golem, the UIU learned the location of the main Wodin distribution hub, located in a disused four-floor dust-den within Little Avalon. Mobile Occult Operations Team (MOOT) units and 3PPD officers moved promptly to cordon off the bar and the surrounding area. 3PPD officers set up blockades and spike-strips on the outside streets and alleys. Acrophobia-inducing proximity aether-mines were seeded onto the roof and the air, preventing any escapes via flight.\n\nMOOT operatives were equipped with standard MOOT gear, thaumaturgically-enhanced bulletproof vests, combat-rated exoskeletons, targeting runes painted onto the backs of their helmets, and ambient EVE accumulators. The MOOT were instructed to shoot to incapacitate, and arrest if able. MOOT operatives were to be deployed into the building, rappelling onto the rooftop and through the skylight via helicopter.\n\n+++ 2. Objectives\n\nThe primary objectives of the operation were to shut down production and distribution of the drug, seizing the remaining product and the location, placing it into lockdown before a full sweep could be initialized. A secondary objective was to arrest associates or conspirators of the Lighthouse Mafia at the location, along with discovering the name of the main distributor.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ Operational Report\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n> **1300:** Operation commences, MOOT team rappels through skylight.\n> \n> **1302:** Operatives begin sweeping the top levels of the building, encountering several intoxicated individuals who were subsequently detained.\n> \n>  **1306:** Fourth floor is secured. Lighthouse Mafia members begin organizing a defense of the lower levels, and operatives encounter heavy resistance on the stairwells as hostiles sandbag the stairwell landings. A large spell-fight ensues.\n> \n> **1307:** A squad of operatives attempt to circumvent the choke-point and try to breach the floor of the fourth level, but the charge backfires due to wards. The operatives were medevaced and stabilized.\n> \n> **1312:** Three operatives are severely injured in the stairwell spell-fight, and a LM-member casts an enchantment of toxic smog, slowly eating through the MOOT gear.\n> \n> **1313:** Agents engrave a sigil of silence on the wall, ending spellcasting within the perimeter. MOOT team resumes their sweep, but are hampered by the silence.\n> \n> **1315:** Infrared cams show a large congregation of irregular heat signatures on the first floor and sub-basement, team lead notified.\n> \n> **1316:** On the second floor, operatives encounter a Culkin Device[[footnote]]**UIU 3P Glossary:** CDs are traps and improvised weaponry made out of common household items and engraved with probability-manipulating sigils. Used primarily as IEDs.[[/footnote]] made out of several LEGO sets and a fifty pound rock. Said rock is then launched towards the MOOT team and out of the window as they avoid its trajectory. The rock impacts a student reporter hovering in an unlicensed pedal-powered ornithopter around the building, which crashes into the police barricade.  \n> \n> **1320:** Second floor secured and all discovered CDs disabled, MOOT operatives begin the construction of a Doc-Torie for medical assistance. Agent Law places strategic defensive necromantic sigils on the stairwell.\n> \n> **1325:** Onlookers begin to crowd the barricades around the building, preventing reinforcements from arriving. A helicopter is dispatched with further reinforcements.\n> \n> **1327:** Significant EVE readings begin to emanate from the sub-basement. Team lead notified.\n> \n> **1328:** Team lead resumes operation as all injured operatives have either recovered or been successfully medevaced. As they proceed downstairs, the team is met with significant gun- and spell-fire. Two agents are transmogrified and another is vaporized. A shoggoth also appeared to have been created during this time, which began advancing on the team.\n> \n> **1330:** As the MOOT team returns fire, it becomes apparent that all hostiles have taken large doses of Horus and are effectively evading all attacks by the operatives. As such, the team focused on the shoggoth.\n> \n> **1332:** Three operatives attempt to breach the first floor. The charge backfires again.\n> \n> **1335:** The shoggoth appears to grow in size proportional to the amount of damage inflicted upon it, buckling the floor and damaging overhead rafters. MOOT operatives tactically retreat to stairwell while antagonizing the shoggoth. The shoggoth advances, forcing the agents up the stairs. As the shoggoth pushes forward, Law's necromantic sigils activate and several Harryhausenian //spartoi// engage the entity. As the shoggoth opens a mouth to shriek, Agent Swinton tosses a grenade down its digestive tract. The shoggoth becomes incapacitated, though several operatives are struck with cosmic nihilism throughout the fight.\n> \n> **1339:** MOOT operatives form a ballistic shield wall and proceed to the first floor. As they push back the LM-members, they break ranks for a brief moment, allowing Law to flash a tattoo that summons psychic manifestations of the Deer College victims, which begin to poltergeize enemy combatants. The ensuing sensory and emotional overload incapacitates all hostiles within range and burns out multiple sigils and wards.\n> \n> **1343:** As MOOT clears the first floor, Agent Law brushes against a seemingly normal cobweb, but it quickly constricts her left arm, dragging her into a nearby trash chute.\n> \n> **1345:** Majority of building cleared and hostiles detained. MOOT proceeds to sub-basement, where Agent Law is held at gunpoint by Eight-Legged Jenny and her instectoid retainers, all of whom appear to be on Horus.\n> \n> **1350:** Operatives attempt to negotiate the freedom of Agent Law in exchange for a reduced sentence, but are unsuccessful.\n> \n> **1351:** A large burst of EVE radiation is observed on optics, reported to team lead. Seconds later, a subordinate of Eight-Legged Jenny reports the accessing of a Way, upon which Jenny suddenly stops and looks up, before dodging to the side.\n> \n> **1351:** Simultaneously, two agents attempt to breach the sub-basement from above with a much larger charge than previous attempts. Due to the previous short-circuiting of protective wards, the charge annihilates the majority of the first floor immediately above Eight-Legged Jenny, who catches the brunt of the blast.\n> \n> **1352:** Agent Law uses the distraction to summon tactical bear corpses from her wrist pocket, which then attack Eight-Legged Jenny. Law flashes her tattoo again, and remanifests one of the Deer College victims, which is able to rip off one of Jenny's legs.\n> \n> **1352:** In the engagement that ensues, multiple overlapping and conflicting spells are fired simultaneously, creating a large backlash which incapacitates the majority of combatants. Coupled with the flaming wall of ectoplasm in the middle of the sub-basement, MOOT is unable to detain Eight-Legged Jenny, and she is able to escape via Way.\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Casualties**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n15\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Fatalities**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell colspan=\"2\" style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n3\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Operation>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n##green|SUCCESS##\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Closing Case Report]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #000000; background: #eef0f2; padding: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; overflow-x: auto\"]]\n[[table style=\"align:left\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Case&nbsp;File&nbsp;#>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n2003-112\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Report&nbsp;Author>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\nAndrew Harris\n[[/cell]]\n[[hcell style=\"text-align:right; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**@<Date&nbsp;Filed>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #000000; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\"]]\n08/11/2003\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"vertical-align:top; text-align:left; padding-right: 5px\"]]\n**Irregularity** _\n**@<Cross&#8209;reference>@**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid #000000; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px; padding-left: 15px; padding-right: 15px; background-color: #d8dbe2\" colspan=\"5\"]]\nParanarcotic, temporal, addictive, Deer College, Prometheus Labs, Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd., Lighthouse Mafia\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n----\n+++ 1. Findings\n\nFollowing the raid on the Wodin distribution hub, recovered files and documents revealed more of the extent of the Lighthouse Mafia's operations throughout Three Portlands. Smaller Wodin distribution sites within Three Portlands were discovered and shut down by subsequent raids and sting operations. However, due to the intentional destruction of a significant portion of the documents by the Lighthouse Mafia it is likely that members of Lighthouse Mafia that have gone to ground continue to distribute Wodin within Three Portlands.\n\nEquipment found within sub-basements of the bar indicated that the Lighthouse Mafia was collecting materials necessary for the creation of temporary Ways; This evidence, corroborated by documents found within the bar, indicates that the Lighthouse Mafia was planning to transport Wodin and potentially other illicit substances to other Free Ports. The equipment was confiscated and documentation was archived.\n\n+++ 2. Bureau Actions\n\nThe UIU was able to put an APB on multiple high-profile members of the Lighthouse Mafia, along with tangentially related suppliers and researchers creating and modifying batches of Wodin and Horus. Several of these researchers suddenly disappeared from UIU custody, coinciding with a visit from Pentagram agents in an unofficial capacity. The Pentagram has refused to comment on the incident.\n\nAll retailers within Three Portlands have been given lists of materials used in the manufacture of Wodin, and have been instructed to notify the UIU if any individual or group of individuals are purchasing the items in bulk. New Golemancy United products have EVE trackers installed in discreet locations to prevent further golem-jacking.\n\n\n+++ 3. Final Analysis\n\nWhile the sale of Wodin has slowed, it maintains a small niche in the paranarcotics market and is prevalent throughout Three Portlands, with an increase of usage following an economic downturn in Eurtec. Multiple smaller paracriminal organizations stole samples and sensitive documents from the scene of the operation and from UIU custody, proliferating the recipe needed to manufacture both Wodin and Horus. Actions taken against Wodin dealers and manufacturers are filed under Operation: Pandora, which remains ongoing. Due to the splintered state of these groups and their liberal use of Horus, tracking their movements has proven more difficult than monitoring those of the Lighthouse Mafia.\n\nThe two survivors of the Deer College incident made full recoveries, and the processes utilized was distributed to hospitals in other Free Ports to mitigate the harmful effects of Wodin, under the collective name Woken (WOCAN). The collective student body of Deer College attempted to place a blood curse on Eight-Legged Jenny, but the success of the attempt is unknown. A mural of the three deceased students, as well as UIU agents who died during the operation, was created on the side of the dormitory of the victims.\n\nFollowing the incident and the UIU raid, pressure by the public led the Council to immediately convene in an emergency session, passing a series of ordinances that criminalized the use of several recreational drugs. Due to the public backlash that ensued, the majority of these ordinances were repealed before Samhain, though Wodin remains a restricted Schedule I paranarcotic on the federal level.\n\n\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n====\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
