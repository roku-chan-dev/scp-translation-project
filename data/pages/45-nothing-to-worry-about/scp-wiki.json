They had their own medics and supplies, but for anything serious, they'd rely on LeClair's steady hands.\n\n\"Come on.\" Helena poked her daughter in the shoulder, twice. Billie was sitting on a bunk bed, scowling at nothing. She slouched to her feet and followed without a word. \n\nLeClair was patting her labcoat and frowning. Helena handed her the clipboard, receiving a wan smile in response. \"Thanks.\"\n\n\"Been a stressful couple days.\"\n\n\"That's the thing, actually.\" They headed for the cloverleaf, passing techs and agents and the odd labcoated abationist as they went. \"Ngo says stress is down so far.

They argued practically every time they spoke. It was a major constituent element of their friendship. In the end, they relented. McInnis had never objected in the first place; Udo's objection had almost certainly involved personal considerations she was unwilling to air in a pinch; Del just wanted to complain, and Lillian wanted Harry to feel embarrassed before she let him have the win.\n\nNot that he thought it was any great boon, being able to pass on this information. Telling someone their entire world had a shelf life was not the most pleasant of tasks. Still, he felt she had a right to know. He would have felt profoundly wrong proceeding without telling her.\n\nWhat he hadn't expected, though in retrospect it made a certain sense, was that Karen would open her mouth in a silent guffaw and stare at him with wide eyes and an open-mouthed smile for ten seconds straight before saying, in a mixture of awe and relief, \"That's fucking //hilarious.//\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/45-nothing-to-worry-about/DL_45_01_Elstrom_Guffaw.jpg]]\n\nAnd the whole way up the elevator, she was humming a jaunty tune.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nMost resources at Site-43 were already inventoried regularly, so the recount was just a formality. But McInnis wanted precise, up-to-date numbers for everything, and he got them within two days. It only took that long because in addition to counting the food, medical supplies, armaments and the like, he demanded a tally of every other numerable object within the facility. He had to know precisely, in every detail, what they were working with.\n\nHarold Blank, some of his old sense of humour already returning for some reason, found it a fun idea as well as a vital one. \"We have the opportunity, for the first time in human history, to know exactly how many objects exist in the entire world. It was never worth the prep costs before, you know?\"\n\nWith it all laid out in front of him, McInnis could now judge the length of eternity. How long the only living things would live. The Site kept food and medicine stores for one year at max complement, a policy inaugurated after everyone had been trapped bottomside while indigenous protestors occupied Camp Ipperwash above in the mid-nineties. Those stores were at capacity. They would likely last until September 8, 2012. Of course, that wasn't good enough; they didn't want hunger riots interrupting the containment procedures for SCP-5243, and they also didn't want to drop dead if they failed and were stuck here permanently. \n\nWell, probably. Probably they wouldn't want that. \n\nSo LeClair and Forsythe were synthesizing additional stocks, with help from an unusual source: William Wettle, whose degree in chemistry and experience in pharmacology could finally come in handy. They'd be replicating medicine for a while to ensure they'd be prepared for any eventuality, as even a single preventable death represented a major drop in the community's sustainability. \n\nUnless of course they couldn't get their food growth projections higher, in which case a few casualties, perhaps early on, might help considerably with reaching the finish line. (The first to point this out had been, of course, Delfina Ibanez.) The Site was equipped with hydroponics, though they had been designed as a supplement to food imports from outside or to allow for pet projects in the field of agricultural comestibles rather than full-scale production. Muhammad Ghosh, a turfgrass management specialist among other things, was overseeing the transformation of their little greenhouses and grow-ops into something resembling a covert industrial farm. Initial estimates suggested their supply of soil, seeds and a variety of complex organics would enable what had formerly been pilot studies to carry them through to October, if necessary.\n\nIf it needed to last even longer, that would be an entirely different kind of problem.\n\nMost of the day-to-day consumables weren't an issue. They'd never run out of paper, batteries, lightbulbs, soap, //et cetera,// or rather they'd run out of something more vital much sooner. They'd be rationing these things anyway, though not excessively; McInnis understood that enhancing the already oppressive nature of their collective imprisonment was a good way to take it from unpleasant to intolerable. He had Styles writing up proposals for incentive programs, spontaneous parties and such to keep spirits high and the odds of disobedience low, and both Ibanez and Van Rompay had been briefed on the importance of taking the lightest of touches to internal policing.\n\nExternal policing was also a consideration, now more than ever. The Site had a lot more externals going on than they'd ever had to manage. The empty caverns which surrounded it had largely disappeared, but there was now a vast expanse of roof accessible through maintenance hatches designed for repair and replacement of the various protective membranes stretched over the first sublevel. Within the walls, egress points to the Mishepeshu tunnels now opened on solid void, but an enterprising spelunker could use them to crawl along the facility's outer skin. Obviously nobody in the Site's complement was expected to do this sort of thing, but they were much better off safe than sorry, so patrols were posted and locks double-checked regularly. They were still deciding what to do with the exterior of the transport systems; it was now possible to promenade along the top of the subway tunnels from the main Site to AAF-A, with only the slimmest likelihood of tripping, slipping, and falling to your death, presumably of starvation, in the dark.\n\nWhy the whole Site hadn't done that already, none could say.\n\nNascimbeni's early findings re: the power and potables situations seemed to hold. They were still trying to figure out where the wells were getting their water, and what the geothermal vents were actually venting, and some of the scientists thought the answers to these questions might conclusively explain just what precisely the great disappearing had really represented, but for now the main thing was that the lights would stay on, the water would keep running, and the heat would keep radiating.\n\nSpaceship-43, a pale grey dot in the otherwise vacant cosmos, would endure.\n\nProbably.\n\nIf nothing else went wrong.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 12 September\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n//Don't think about it.//\n\n\"That's probably far enough.\" If only so the sound of the whirring hydraulics would distract his preoccupied mind.\n\nVanchev nodded, and flicked the switch. The pulley began drawing the cable back up. \"One kilometre, and nothing.\"\n\n\"Yep.\"\n\nThey were standing on the bottom-most level of AAF-A, feeding a long length of steel braid through what had formerly been a cave access hatchway. They'd send drones down next, now that it was obviously safe; they were already buzzing far above the facility, determining whether the blackness had any extent or boundaries, but somehow sending them downward had seemed much more potentially dangerous. Material dropped below the Site would be essentially irretrievable. At least if it fell from above, it would impact on the roof of S&C.\n\n\"Been talking to Paul,\" Vanchev yawned. \"Know what he thinks?\"\n\nNascimbeni did not know what Paul Nicolescu thought. He couldn't wrap his head around anything that happened between these two men anymore. Where he came from, one had bludgeoned the other to death. Where he was now, they were closer than he'd ever been with his own son.\n\n//Don't think about it.//\n\nThere was something very human about the way everyone was reacting to the sudden appearance of nothing in every direction. Site-43 was now the full extent of their reality, and what were they all doing? Standing at the edge, looking away from everything that existed, at...\n\n\"We need more words for 'nothing',\" said Nascimbeni, ignoring the question he'd already nearly forgotten.\n\n\"Weird, right?\" Vanchev agreed.\n\nThey were worse than children on Christmas morning playing with the box and ignoring the toy. They were playing with the space beneath the tree where the box had been. In a sense, he supposed, it indicated both a whimsical imagination and the soul of science. He remembered when Flora--\n\n//Don't think about it.//\n\n\"Sorry I'm late.\"\n\nTechnician Charles Carter sauntered over from the stairs, zipping up the front of his jumpsuit. He was five minutes early for his shift, as he had been the previous day, and the one before that. He apologized for it every time. Perhaps it was an inside joke Nascimbeni was meant to be inside of. He had no way of knowing.\n\nEileen Veiksaar was with him, rubbing red-rimmed eyes beneath black-rimmed glasses. \"Want to talk to you,\" she said, and Nascimbeni assumed he was being addressed. She hadn't cared for Vanchev back in baseline (nobody had), and he suspected she'd already had plenty of time to talk with Carter.\n\n\"Sure. What do you want to talk about?\"\n\n\"I want to run something //rhetorical// past you.\" The emphasis was only the tracest of outlines, but it was there.\n\nHe fixed a smile on his face, and nodded. \"Okay. The office?\" He gestured in the vague direction of the tiny maintenance kiosk on this sublevel.\n\nShe inclined her head agreeably, then stood on her tip-toes and kissed Carter on the cheek. He was already leaning to the side so she could reach. \"See you later,\" she cooed.\n\nHe'd never heard her coo before.\n\nCarter grinned. \"Not if I--\"\n\n\"You'll see me first automatically,\" she snapped. \"I wear glasses. That's how light works.\"\n\nSomething in the way she said it gave Nascimbeni a notion. As they headed for the kiosk together, he chanced a glance back at Carter, who was clapping Vanchev on the back companionably, and then at Veiksaar, who was re-adjusting her glasses after the kiss.\n\nEach had a gold band on their left ring finger.\n\nHe wasn't sure why this should give him a worse sinking feeling than watching the cable descend into the unplumbable abyss, but still, it did.\n\nHe didn't think about it.\n\n[!-- [[=image Nascimbeni_Carter_Veiksaar.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nKaren stared into the void.\n\nThe void approached, and rubbed itself against her pant leg. She reached down and touched the void, and it began to purr.\n\nKaren Elstrom in his dorm room was like a touch of Rococo in a drug nest. Stiff and ornate in a den of dissolution. She didn't so much pull the room together as she put it to shame. Harry realized he'd hardly ever seen her outside of A&O for nearly a decade, where the fancy decor was only slightly upstaged by her impeccable sense of style.\n\nThe cat leapt onto the cushion beside her, a bridge between two poles of elegance. She reached out, and a tiny black snout delicactely sniffed at her metallic blue fingernails.\n\n\"Question,\" he said. She glanced down the couch at him, an invitation to continue, as her long fingers found the cat's flank with experimental precision. \"What do you know about Foundation medical tech?\"\n\nShe scratched behind Scout's ears. The cat jumped into her lap, startling her; she held both hands in the air uncertainly as the brown-black ball began kneading her thighs. \"Uh. Not much. What's your question specifically?\"\n\n\"Anti-aging.\"\n\nShe looked at him again, this time speculatively. \"Feeling old?\"\n\n\"Yeah. I'm sure you can see the grey hairs from over there.\"\n\nShe scooted a little closer on the couch, and leaned in his direction. Even so casual a gesture seemed choreographed from Karen, and her hands never missed a beat. The cat, never very skittish when he was being loved, rolled with the haunches. \"A few,\" she agreed. \"I still don't know what you're asking.\"\n\n\"I don't really expect an answer, I'm just putting out feelers. Do you know what might cause someone to age at a different rate? Someone in the Foundation?\"\n\n\"Oh, well.\" She performed her equivalent of a shrug, inclining her head away from him. \"Yeah. The Fountain of Youth.\"\n\n\"Which is a myth. As in, an actual myth. Not in the database.\"\n\n\"Maybe not in the database,\" she smiled, \"but not quite a myth.

Now he'd need to play a one-sided game, keep her from realizing he hadn't lived the same nine years she had. He'd gone over his diaries and notes, but that only got him so far. \"Falkirk.\"\n\n\"Yes.

He supposed it made sense that the old bastard had filled that role in every timeline; the 2002 breach, which had triggered his investigation and advent at the Site, had happened in every reality they'd inhabited.\n\n\"You remember how pale and skinny he was?

It saved his life, once.\"\n\n\"Dr. Falkirk,\" McInnis murmured, \"is not what I would call a reliable source.\"\n\nHe was also a sore spot for Nascimbeni, who still kept mum and watched the others argue.

Ten days?\" Nascimbeni pointed out.\n\n\"Sure, but at his age that should have meant at least a cursory exam. Something was keeping him healthy.\"\n\nHarry nodded back at her, perhaps hoping that would make her stop.

Though it was difficult to tell, with the office floors carpeted as they were, she felt certain he lingered out of sight behind her, looking over her back, before sliding into view and draping his arms lazily over the walls of her cubicle. \"Eileen.\"\n\n\"Chief.\" She forced a smile.\n\nRudolph Marroquin flicked a hand at her monitor. \"Everything working out alright?\"\n\nHer heart fell. He couldn't be serious. \"Of course. Getting it done.\"\n\n\"All of it?\" Marroquin pressed, smiling the least sincere smile she'd seen outside of a zoo.\n\n\"All of it.\" Her voice sounded weak in her own ears. By the way his nostrils flared, she knew it sounded the same to him. He was a tiger sniffing blood on the wind.\n\n\"Lyle?\" she called out. Her boyfriend was working in the next row of cubes, a few seats down. The office was almost empty otherwise, only one other tech slaving away at their machine. She wasn't sure what she was going to say when he responded, but it would signal the end of her conversation with Marroquin, and that was all that mattered.\n\nExcept Lyle didn't respond. He didn't so much as acknowledge her. If he were a cat, his ears wouldn't even have twitched.\n\n//Where'd these animal metaphors come from, all of a sudden?//\n\n\"He's busy. Eileen, it's really important that you get these things done today. Important for both of us. You understand.\"\n\nShe did understand. She knew exactly what he was talking about. Her fingers itched to call up the program she'd been working on, even with him looming over her machine, and let the cards fall where they would.\n\nBut no. If she was going to do that, she was going to do it right. She was a programmer. Half-finished code was no better, and sometimes worse, than no code at all. And some part of her was already rebelling at the idea of using something so pure for such a dirty job. Before Marroquin, it had all seemed so elegant...\n\nSo, she nodded. And called out again, more forcefully: \"Lyle.\"\n\nHe waved a hand dismissively.\n\n\"Really gets into his work, doesn't he?\" Marroquin chuckled. \"Maybe let some of that dedication rub off on you. Of course, if you're not up to the tasks we've agreed on, I could always see if he's game to join our little cabal.\"\n\nShe shook her head. //Anything but that.// \"It's fine. It'll be done. Like I told you.\"\n\n\"Great.\" The chief tech stood up, stretched, and then patted her on the back. Even through the cotton, his touch was electric in all the wrong ways. \"End of day, please. As in, day doesn't end until it's done. You understand.\"\n\nAnd he walked away, ignoring Lyle to zero in on Cassandra Avelina on the opposite end of the block. He paused before stepping in front of her, and... yes, he was scanning her screen, seeing what she was up to. Eileen saw Avelina's shoulders tense up. She could tell he was there, and was preparing herself for the assault.\n\nLyle was looking at her now. \"What did you want? You wanted something, right?\"\n\nShe shook her head. \"Don't worry about it.

She'd come out of the trance in a bad mood, had barely been able to preserve decorum with the woman while excusing herself back to her dorm, and that was mostly where she'd been this entire time. She'd gone to the Survivors meeting, but that was it. She'd called in to ApplOcc, said she was recovering from the heavy duty thaumaturgy, and nobody questioned it. Probably she wasn't known for extravagant acts of micamancy in this timeline. She hadn't been in the last, or the one after that either. She had to keep resetting people's expectations; it might have been exhausting, if her memories hadn't been wiped every time.\n\nEventually she got tired of cooking pot noodles in her room, and reporting the consumption to Styles' office. Odds were good he was preparing to send one of LeClair's nurses her way, armed with a packet of information about the value of proper nutrition in survival situations. If that was the case, it would go better if she had something to say for herself.\n\nThis was the excuse she used to get out of her funk, through the halls, and into the main cafeteria.\n\nHot meals had once been prepared here around the clock, but now the times were fixed. 'Leftovers' had become a synonym for 'waste'; nothing would be prepared if it wasn't going to be eaten right away. She'd seen the projections, and even with the hydroponics going full tilt, it was going to be tight if they didn't tighten their belts.\n\nBut it was half past six in the evening, and the cafeteria was still serving. She let old Wyers ladle some vegetables and chicken into a bowl for her, and her body reacted to the smell like she was huffing ammonia inhalants. It was revitalizing. This was what five pot noodles in a row did to a woman.\n\nShe scanned the room. There were a few clusters of researchers and techs, but nobody she knew. Ordinarily she'd take her meals upstairs, in ApplOcc's little café, but...\n\n//Actually, you do know that one.//\n\nYes, she did, but...\n\nBut nothing. It didn't matter anymore. It should never have mattered in the first place. It was absurd for her still to be hung up on this, years later, even if the man //had// died. He'd been a bastard. He wasn't worth it.\n\nAnd Phil looked lonely, though it could have been only that she was used to seeing him with constant company.\n\nShe took her tray, and went over to sit across from him. \"Hey.\"\n\nHe looked up in surprise. He'd been daydreaming, or nightdreaming, or whatever the hell. Nobody really knew what time it was unless they were on shift, now. \"Oh. Hey!\"\n\n\"If you don't mind?\" She settled the tray on her side of the table, and starting picking at the chicken.\n\n\"Mind? Oh. No, I don't mind.\" The plate on his own tray was empty, but he picked up his fork and tapped at it pointlessly anyway. It was guilelessly charming.\n\n\"How've you been holding up?\" It was easy to talk to him. Too easy. She considered bolting for the door, but something in his eyes kept her seated.\n\nHe looked, she thought, like he was considering bolting for the door.\n\n\"Oh. You know.\" He shrugged. \"I keep thinking.\"\n\n\"Your parents?\" The words wrung themselves out of her. She popped a piece of chicken into her mouth to stop it happening again. A sudden rush of nausea made her wonder what would happen when she tried to swallow.\n\n\"Dead. No, I'm just...\" He looked up at the ceiling. \"My brother.

But of course there was one other still.\n\nPhilip Deering never finding out.\n\nShe swallowed. \"Yeah.

This freed him up to consider the perspectives of others, since he took only one perspective himself and the human brain had evolved with a staggering capacity for doublethink.

He'd wanted to work on the upper circuits, mostly so he wouldn't need to take the ladder down to the Core's lower levels, but Du had insisted on the reverse arrangement. The old man was too annoyed to ask why, which was good, because he probably wouldn't have reacted well to Du's reasoning: Bremmel spat when he talked, and Du didn't want that raining down on the narrow tube of circuits and wires, or onto his own face. So when Bremmel spoke, it rattled up to where Du lay prone with his screwdriver out: \"That bitch ask you to talk to her yet?\"\n\nDu considered. Bremmel wasn't misogynistic, but rather misanthropic; anyone he was forced to interact with stood a good chance of becoming 'that bitch' or 'that asshole' when described after the fact. It was difficult to know who he was talking about, which was probably the point.\n\nBremmel liked to talk, but he hated to listen. Making Du ask what he asked next: \"Which bitch?\" was the engineer's way of letting the other man say a few words on his terms.\n\n\"The Hammer.\" The sound of a socket wrench twisting ricocheted up around Du's ears. \"She call you in for a cry-fest yet?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\" Du pulled up the schematics on his tablet, and considered the overhanging circuits with care. Was that right? It didn't look right. \"She did. I told her I was busy.\"\n\nBremmel snorted. \"I told her to fuck off, and //also// that I was busy.\"\n\n\"What do you think she's trying to get at?\" He wasn't sure why he felt suspicious of Lillihammer, other than the fact that she'd clapped him in the head to exorcise a ghost from his skull. Perhaps that was reason enough, actually. He //still// had bruising. He was starting to think he always would.\n\n\"From what I hear,\" and the old man grunted as he finished torquing something up, \"they're all talking about their widdle feelings. Everything that's made them //sad.// Some new-age bullshit Ngo probably made up, or else Styles. Reeks of HR. Let's all get in touch with our inner children, because of the oh-so-tragic situation that's befallen us. Woe, woe is me.\"\n\nDu turned over onto his stomach and glanced down the conduit's length. Bremmel was staring up at him, bushy beard glowing green in an LED backsplash. \"Sounds pointless.\"\n\n\"It //is// pointless. I hear Mataxas was in there moaning about how his brats need sunlight and fresh water. I told him he should stick them in hydroponics.\"\n\nDu laughed. \"Ridiculous. He should count himself lucky they were inside when it all disappeared.\"\n\nBremmel coughed.\n\n\"Ridiculous,\" Du repeated. \"That man //dotes// on those children.\"\n\n\"Hardly children,\" Bremmel growled. \"They're college aged. They should be //in// college. They say they're trainees. I wouldn't stand for it, I was him.\"\n\n\"He's a soft touch. Doesn't believe in firm discipline. Showers them with praise. How's that going to harden them up for life at the Foundation?\"\n\n\"Exactly. //Exactly.//\" Bremmel waved his wrench at Du. \"They eat dinner together every night, he says. They talk about their days. Can you imagine anything more dull? My dad, he never wasted time on any of that nonsense. Never asked me what I was doing. He had his projects, and I had mine, and that was how we both liked it.\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Du agreed without enthusiasm. He decided to change the subject, but that was always difficult when talking to Bremmel, who only suffered turning his monologues into dialogues under protest. \"So, are the tolerances down there--\"\n\n\"I never sat around moping because he never told me he was //proud.// Of course he was proud. Why wouldn't he be proud? And Joanna--\"\n\nHe coughed again, and Du recoiled. \"You really ought to get that checked out.\"\n\nBremmel cleared his throat. \"It's nothing.\"\n\n\"You were saying about J--\"\n\n\"The //point// is,\" the old man interrupted, \"that Lillihammer's wasting time. She should be down here checking torque and tolerances with us, not playing grab-ass with a clipboard. It's disgraceful.\"\n\nDu nodded, and rolled back around.

They were in the boondocks now for sure. \"I can't just walk in and ask.

Perhaps it was a test. \"Is this a metaphor for something?\"\n\nDougall stopped at an unoccupied all-way stop, before the stop sign, as was the law and good practice.

It might even be something he hadn't drummed up himself.\n\nShe'd been less and less subtle with her implications. The last time they'd spoken, remotely of course, she'd all but suggested he'd been directly responsible for the erasure himself. It was simply too absurd to get him riled, however. He had a soldier's temper: it only flared when he needed the anger to fuel his vengeance. He could wait her out indefinitely.\n\nLeClair's interview was meant for today, but she'd already cancelled. Something about Billie Forsythe's treatment for whatever the code word was for her mother's hypochondria by proxy.

At your age, these constant injuries will start to take a toll.\"\n\nIndeed, he'd never felt so old and beaten-down.

There was transit data to back this up, though the relevant cameras had been mysteriously blacked out. When Ibanez had looked over the details, they first thing she'd pointed out was that four people at Site-43 could make the elevator move remotely without a passenger, and without an entry in the Site's activity log: the Director, and the Chiefs of I&T, S&C, and P&S.\n\nThe Chief of P&S grunted. \"You're calling me a liar.\"\n\n\"Yeah.

He refused to consider what the researcher might be implying.

He wasn't going to infect Van Rompay with it.\n\n\"It does matter. I can help her, Chief. I can fix it.\"\n\nHe tightened his grip on the stock, and fought to retain trigger discipline. \"Walk. Don't talk.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Wirth's smile widened. \"No more talking.\"\n\n//This is far more direct, anyway.//\n\nVan Rompay tried to pull the trigger, but found that he couldn't. He didn't control his own hands anymore. The gun was lowered, gently, and he took his finger away from the trigger guard.\n\n\"Get out of my head,\" he tried to say, but it went no farther than the inside of his skull.\n\n//I could put the gun to your neck,// Wirth's voice said. There was no anger in it, only a bald statement of fact. //Blow your brains out. But I won't. You're a symptom of a wider disease, and I'm going to cure it. And you're going to help me. After a show of good faith.//\n\nVan Rompay tried to squeeze his eyes shut. They didn't respond. //How are you doing this?//\n\n//That doesn't matter. What matters is, I can.

The words were all the more convincing for being beamed directly into his head. The other man's face was a mask of concentration. //What are you proposing?//\n\n//I'm going to rearrange your lover's brain. I'm going to give her back to herself. And I'm going to offer a long-term service plan, so long as you keep my little secret, and keep prying eyes off my work. Do you think you can do that? Would you do that for __her__?//\n\nHe wanted to make a moral stand. No, that wasn't true. He wanted to want to make a moral stand. The difference in strength between those two positions was catastrophic. //I'd do anything for her. But why would I believe you? What's stopping you from just killing us all when I let you go?//\n\nAnd now the gun suddenly was against his throat, finger back on the trigger. //Nothing is stopping me from doing that __right__ __now__. Ergo, I am telling the truth.

He'd never been in this room. Only the I&T techs ever came in here, and only the ones with the highest clearance. He was used to that sort of compartmentalization, so he'd never made a fuss.\n\nWell, that was part of the reason. He'd been making fewer and fewer fusses since shortly past the turn of the millennium.\n\n\"This,\" Veiksaar sighed again, as though she could only convey the information breathily, \"is the DR-RHETORIC interface.\"\n\n\"The supercomputer that isn't,\" Nascimbeni agreed. \n\nVeiksaar blinked at him. \"You know?\"\n\nHe immediately began kicking himself, mentally. Lillian had explained the entire thing to them all, of course, but Veiksaar wasn't supposed to know that. Not for the first time, he resented being made to carry and keep secrets, and keep track of who was allowed to know what, and who was allowed to know who knew what, and so on and so forth along the fractal curve of escalating dishonesty. \"I know. We can talk about //why// I know later. But you can skip the explanation.\"\n\nFor the third time, she sighed. \"That's good. That's //great.// I don't like explaining this.

The ASC stood up, and they all looked up at him. \"Do you propose an expedition, then?\"\n\n\"I'm not really sure,\" said Lillian. \"Thing is, the factory is passively antimemetic if it's really down there.

Well, Sokolsky officially didn't, but they all knew how far that went.\n\n\"It's a measure to neutralize Rydderech.\" Harry grimaced. \"Fills the factory with expanding foam. Scout tried to use it once, when he thought Rydderech was too far gone and begging for death.

There was always a lot of computer equipment laying around, most of it archaic; in this sense it was not unlike Nascimbeni's quarters, where old machinery went to not die. The recent comprehensive inventory had relocated everything which could be repurposed to the manufactories of J&M, but there was still little room for pacing or dramatic gesture when you packed more than a couple of people into the space.\n\nThere were more than a couple now -- a trio, to be precise -- and they were all bunched up at the back of the room, looking at Eileen's terminal over her shoulder. It was an intimate occasion, and the events they were monitoring were no less so.\n\nOne of the Tarrows was sneaking through the facility, and Eileen's CLIOMETRIA was tracking her across a wide variety of electronic media.\n\nThe cameras were the most obvious bet, but of course the //giftschreiber// knew that, and was selectively rerouting the feeds. She must have had some sort of technical knowledge, which was an interesting wrinkle Lillian hadn't previously suspected. In any event, watching Tarrow on the cameras when she didn't want to be watched was a bad idea, because odds were they'd all suddenly stop caring about the hunt, stand up, and wander off to do something else. Chasing an antimemetic threat was something a human being couldn't practically do.\n\nBut CLIO was nothing but raw code, lacking not only the personality driver that made an .aic a virtual person, but most of the electronic superstructure that supported it. The program could follow each fluctuation, each change in temperature or pressure, the source of each feed alteration -- Tarrow was forcing the cameras to replay old footage, a trick Lillian remarked disapprovingly had been lifted straight from //Speed// -- to trace the woman's course through the undercrofts of AAF-A with something approaching precision. She was circling, spiralling, veering off at strange angles down corridors nominally leading nowhere, navigating an antimemetic maze which only she could see.\n\nIt was probably not the quickest path to her quarry, since she had obviously never actually found him yet, but there was time to streamline. She'd already made dramatic improvements on the path she'd taken yesterday. In a few more days, she might actually have found the point of access.\n\n\"Assuming there's a point of access,\" Eileen pointed out. \"Could be Wirth just lowers the entire antimemetic field when he wants to leave.\"\n\n\"Could be,\" Lillian agreed. \"Bremmel's working on a solution for that, too.\"\n\n\"Which is what?\"\n\n\"A big bomb.\"\n\nEileen struck a key, and the second tracking routine CLIO was running took over the screen. The other Tarrow was on the level above, spinning in place, hands outstretched as though feeling for walls in the dark. So far as they could tell, neither sister was aware of the other's activities. They weren't comparing notes. They were searching separately.\n\nUdo shook her head. \"It's so weird that they're working against each other.\"\n\n\"Not so weird,\" said Lillian.\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"They've got power. Too much power.\" Lillian waved her hands, and Eileen pushed them out of her face so focus on the screen. \"Blah blah blah, the saying that goes with that.\"\n\n\"The saying that goes with that is four words long,\" Udo sighed.\n\n\"What are you today, the fucking word police?\"\n\n\"I'm just...\" She stood up, and performed the limited amount of pacing allowed by the room's narrow profile. \"This is all freaking me out a bit. I thought I understood where the lines were. Who was on what side. Now there's more sides than I was expecting. This isn't a coin, it's a polygon.\"\n\n\"Coins are polygons,\" Eileen murmured.\n\n\"Yeah, but the space between the sides isn't so //overt.// What do all these interest blocs want? With us? With the Victims? How have we been in this mess for like a decade, and yet still we aren't any closer to figuring it out?\"\n\nLillian stretched, then walked over to where Udo was treading carpet and reached out to still her by the shoulders. \"We're a //lot// closer to figuring it out.

The back of her office featured a wall panel that slid aside if you tapped it with her keycard, and the tunnel behind that panel -- Billie knew it had to be an escape tunnel -- had a door halfway down its length which opened via a more traditional keycard interaction, and behind that door was nothing. Not the nothing she could see from the elevator platform, or the nothing which surrounded the Site's enormous exposed roof, but a nothing she could have all to herself, if she wanted it.\n\nEvery once in a while, she stole the old woman's keycard and returned to visit the void.

But occasionally.\"\n\n\"Was there anything you could have done differently?\"\n\nHe had a sudden image of gratuitous violence. His staff fleeing from him in terror. Smashed furniture. Blood. A red haze. And then a bricked-up wall, and one less Section at Site-43. He'd seen it before, in his dreams. He'd seen it once before that, in livid colour.\n\n\"No,\" he admitted. \"Compulsion is compulsion. It happens to the best of us. Most personnel who last long enough are forced to face the spectre of a loss of control. Few so completely as you, of course, Dr. Wirth. You have my deepest sympathies.\"\n\nThe other man laughed. \"Don't try to change the subject. I'm not under any sort of //compulsion.// I'm just not who you think I am, which is honestly very embarrassing, because we've met before, more than once, and you really ought to recognize me. I've seen you fail, and fail, and fail again, Allan. I've seen you fall short of your lofty intentions. I've seen you take shortcuts. I've seen you make mistakes. And today, I can feel them all. Right here. Right now.\"\n\n\"Right here,\" McInnis repeated. \"At the peak of Rydderech's factory?\"\n\n\"At its //heart.// You're thinking with lines instead of curves. We're standing where the man once lived, Allan. Where he suffered every day for half a century.\"\n\n\"But no longer?\" The words seemed to echo.\n\n\"No. I've taken up his post. I've absorbed his guilt. Do you know how lonely he was? You think you do, but you don't. You think you regret what you've done to him, but you don't understand the //half// of it. You're too caught up in all the things you've done wrong that you can't take back. All of you are. Every last one of you. You're anchored to the same shoal by the weight of your shame, and you've polluted every inch of this place with it. It's in the walls. It's in the asbestos. It was giving you //cancer.// But I'm going to burn it all away.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/45-nothing-to-worry-about/DL_45_15_Wirth_Crazy.jpg]]\n\n\"Burning asbestos is inadvisable,\" McInnis murmured.\n\nWirth glanced down at the controller, and smiled. \"I'm a liberator,\" he said. \"I'm going to present you with the finest freedom of all.\"\n\n\"And what is that?\"\n\n\"Freedom from guilt.\" He raised the remote, not to use it, but to fix the Director's attention on it. \"I'm almost there.\"\n\n\"Almost...?\"\n\n\"I know what went wrong. I know how to fix it. I //have// fixed it, the machine I mean.\" McInnis searched Wirth's eyes for uncertainty, confusion, dishonesty. There was only a crazed determination. \"It works the way I thought it would work, now.\"\n\nMcInnis turned away, and examined the computers behind his manifestation point. \"Why was there such a gap between conception and construction? Was it not your plan you were executing?\"\n\nBy the sound of his voice, Wirth was frowning. \"I and me are two different things, and sometimes more. Sometimes //seven.// You know what I mean. You've been through this rodeo //twice already.// So you can excuse me for being a little //mixed up,// given the circumstances.\"\n\n\"Given what you've done,\" McInnis brushed the cold steel and polymer with his fingertips, \"forgiveness is entirely beyond my authority.\"\n\n\"There won't be anything to forgive, soon. It'll all be back to normal. It'll all be //back.// Then you can do whatever you want. We can shape it however we please.\"\n\nMcInnis let his hands fall back to his sides. He began adjusting the hem of his jumper. \"My desires are now being taken into account? You're no longer a unilateral Creator?\"\n\n\"Just leave me alone,\" Wirth cursed. \"Leave me down here, with the machine. Let me finish my work. You just need to give me another chance.\" His voice was growing louder. He was approaching. \"When I'm ready, I'll set things right again. I'm the only one who can.\"\n\nMcInnis turned to face him again. \"I absolutely believe you.\"\n\n[!-- [[=image McInnis_Wirth_Wallpaper.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nShe found him at the door, one hand on his temple, the other clutching the jamb. He didn't look up when she approached, but he did nod. \"The matter is settled.\"\n\nLillian frowned. \"Meaning?\"\n\n\"Meaning the matter is settled. There is no further threat from Dr. Wirth.\" He looked up, and she saw his eyes were closed. He opened them. \"Your hypotheses were entirely correct. As were Dr. Du's, and Dr. Bremmel's. I'll thank you to inform them.\"\n\nHe started down the hall.\n\n\"Where are you going?\" she called after him.\n\n\"I'm feeling fatigued. It was a taxing interaction. Please do not attempt to enter the factory tonight; we will begin promemetic treatment tomorrow, to make the space more easily accessible.\"\n\nNascimbeni was waiting around the next bend, and he heard the tail end of that sentence. \"Accessible for what?\" he demanded, as the Director brushed past him.\n\n\"Hey,\" Lillian called. McInnis was moving fast for a man with such short legs. \"HEY. What happened down there? What was it all about?\"\n\n\"You already know what it was all about, Lillian.\" He glanced back at her, eyes hooded, but did not slow his roll. \"Regrets. Let's do our best not to accrue any more, shall we?\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nKaren shook her head. \"And that's that? It's all settled?\"\n\n\"I guess so.\" Harry spread his arms around the back of the couch, clutching at the frame beneath the fabric. \"We're in this for the long haul, now.\"\n\nShe wrinkled her nose. \"Well, it's nice that we're not in danger of any further program interruptions. I wonder how Allan managed that.\"\n\nHarry shrugged. \"He can be very convincing, when he wants to.\"\n\n\"Mmm.\" She ran her hands along the length of her slacks. Her legs were very long. \n\nThere was something in the set of her jaw that set him to wondering. \"Good day at the office?\"\n\nShe smiled. It reached her eyes. \"Just another day at the beach. I never realized how much heavy lifting the Oversight was doing in Admin and Oversight.\"\n\n\"Yeah, I guess you don't miss Overwatch?\"\n\n\"Over-the-shoulder-watch, more like.\" She stretched, and let her hands rest on the frame where they fell. \"Without them, it's like managing a condo complex.\"\n\n\"Still sounds pretty cut-throat.\"\n\n\"I can cut throats from nine to five, and not bring it home with me.\"\n\nHe felt his left hand creeping up the back of the couch. \"Sounds like you've got a lot of free time, for a change.\"\n\n\"Little bit.\" Her right hand crept down to meet his. \"What about you? What have you got to work on, for the next few months?\"\n\nHe met her eyes, held her gaze. \"I did have a project in mind, actually.\"\n\n\"Do tell.\"\n\nTheir hands connected.\n\n\"Maybe I could show you, instead.\"\n\nIt was a sudden thing, what with both of them pulling at the same time.
