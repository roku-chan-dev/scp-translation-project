She's quite a brilliant thing, armed to the teeth with her facts and logic ready to tear down any and all motherly advice I give her. Though I say this with a smile... she's just not old enough for love to bring her back down to earth.\n\nAt her age, I'd already met her dad. I was, in my head at least, very good at doing what I needed to do -- I've always been the go-getter in my family -- with some determination, I transformed into and remained his dream girl. My oldest, Ashlie, takes after me. She met THE boy last month and cold-quit carbs (something not even I've managed). Haley, however... let's just say she takes after my Hubby.\n\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ella-s-sickly-sweets|By the way, here's some goodies that helped me lose the weight and keep the boobs!!!]]]\n\nTo my fellow mamas reading this: how often do you let your kids eat out? Haley whines and whines, every single gosh-darn day, even though my answer has always been \"never\"! She and Ashlie are free to make their own choices (within reason, obvs) but junk food is where I've always drawn the line. I would go so far as to say it is the very thing slowly murdering our country. We as Americans are groomed from toddlerhood to crave grease-encrusted garbage, with every birthday party hosted in a McDonalds or Chuck E Cheese and every colorful soda pop brand they have in every cafeteria -- is it too much to have my girls be the ones breaking the cycle? Though I wouldn't  assume neither have snuck a chicken tender or six while out with friends, no daughter of mine shoves pore-clogging crap into their stupid little mouths that don't know better. Not under my watch.\n\nMy home is somewhere we ALL take care of our bodies. Not a single fry has made it past my doorframe since the girls turned five.\n\nHOWEVER...there is a reason why I of all people am writing a milkshake recipe.\n\nAgainst my express wishes, our car broke down on the I-405 in walking distance of a Spicy Crust Pizzeria, and the other option was to swelter under the 98 degree heat waiting to get hit by a car…\n\nMy brain must've been baking itself into goo. I watched as Haley made a beeline for the counter. Passive, permissive. Paralyzed with heat.\n\nThen I was... thrilled?\n\nThere was something about what she ordered -- Super Strawberry Surprise Shake, she called it, a cheap-sounding name for a cheap-sounding drink -- that evoked, in my wandering mind; images of ###ff85a2|[[size xx-small]]laced hems and rounded cheeks[[/size]]##, of ###ff85a2|[[size xx-small]]warm hands and playground rhymes[[/size]]##, of ###ff85a2|[[size xx-small]]scented ink streaking pink[[/size]]##.

I dragged the girls out of the store and back to the car right in time for AAA to arrive and do their job. Then off we went, as I allowed one thought to reconcile with the other, to the nearest Erewhon where we got:\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ What to make Superior Strawberry Surprise Shake with\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"dark\"]]\n\n[[size 125%]] **Fresh organic strawberries.** Frozen works too if you want it frosty, but the real deal will be packed with nutrients and those of us with a cheap/suboptimal blender will struggle less.
