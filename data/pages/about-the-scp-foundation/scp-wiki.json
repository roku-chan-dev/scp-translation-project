We huddled in caves and around small fires, fearful of the things that we didn't understand. It was more than explaining why the sun came up, it was the mystery of enormous birds with heads of men and rocks that came to life. So we called them \"gods\" and \"demons\", begged them to spare us, and prayed for salvation.\n\nIn time, their numbers dwindled and ours rose. The world began to make more sense when there were fewer things to fear, yet the unexplained can never truly go away, as if the universe demands the absurd and impossible.\n\n**Mankind must not go back to hiding in fear.** No one else will protect us, and we must stand up for ourselves.\n\nWhile the rest of mankind dwells in the light, we must stand in the darkness to fight it, contain it, and shield it from the eyes of the public, so that others may live in a sane and normal world.\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/about-the-scp-foundation/scp-logo-signature.png style=\"width: 63px; margin: 12px 15px 0 42px; float: left;\"]]\n**We secure. We contain. We protect.**\n\n**-- The Administrator**\n[[/div]]\n\n= [[size 1.325em]]{{MISSION STATEMENT}}[[/size]]\n\nOperating clandestine and worldwide, the Foundation acts beyond conventional jurisdiction, with the task of containing anomalous objects, entities, and phenomena.\n\nWe maintain an extensive database of information regarding anomalies requiring //Special Containment Procedures//, commonly referred to as \"SCPs\"; all of which undermine the natural laws that the people of the world implicitly trust in.\n\nWe operate to maintain normalcy, so that the worldwide civilian population can live and go on with their daily lives without fear, mistrust, or doubt in their personal beliefs, and to maintain human independence from extraterrestrial, extradimensional, and other extranormal influence.\n\nOur mission is threefold:\n* **Secure** — secure anomalies to prevent them from falling into the hands of civilian or rival agencies through extensive observation and surveillance, acting to intercept anomalies at the earliest opportunity.\n* **Contain** — contain anomalies to prevent spread of their influence or effects; by either relocating, concealing, or dismantling them, or by suppressing public dissemination of knowledge thereof.\n* **Protect** — protects humanity as well as the anomalies themselves until such time that they are either fully understood or new theories of science can be devised based on their properties and behavior. \n\n[[[universe-hub|Additional information]]] will have been provided upon your joining us in pursuit of our goals.
