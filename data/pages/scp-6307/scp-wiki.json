Personnel assigned to the SCP-6307 project, Mobile Task Force Beta-17 \"Truck Freaks,\" and Logistics and Transportation Division Admin are the only individuals permitted to enter SCP-6307's containment unit for research and maintenance purposes. Technical personnel are mandated to refrain from tampering with or altering SCP-6307's current wiring setup.\n\nAny aberrations in SCP-6307's daily logs and any unusual supply requests are to be reported to the SCP-6307 team immediately.\n\n------\n\n**Description:** SCP-6307 is a massive, sophisticated computer network built some time between the early 1970s and 1982. SCP-6307, in its current state, is made up of the following components:\n* Five DataBank 1012 computers[[footnote]]A now-archaic multi-purpose computer built by the Foundation, and used until the late 1980s. These were known, rather infamously, for their bulky nature, with one DataBank taking up almost the entirety of a single room.[[/footnote]], engraved with standard SCP Foundation identification.\n* Approximately 0.5km worth of wiring and tubing, connecting the DataBanks to a central mainframe unit.\n* A homebrew computer unit constructed from a hybrid of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/prometheus-labs-hub Prometheus Labs] and DataBank 1012 computer parts. This unit is engraved with a \"Property of the SCP Foundation\" placard on its side.\n* A terminal connected to the homebrew computer unit, with an LCD display, keyboard, and mouse, running an outdated version of the Foundation's current operating system and SkipNet[[footnote]]Slang for the intranet used by the Foundation[[/footnote]].\n\nSCP-6307 greatly assists in the monitoring, maintenance, and fulfillment of virtually all logistical matters pertaining to the Foundation. The system automates most processes regarding supply chain management, Site resupply, personnel transfer, and inventory logging, and maintains constant contact with every major Foundation Site in order to fulfill the supply demands of the Foundation as a whole.\n\nAlthough many of SCP-6307's components are outdated by modern technical standards, the system is capable of fully integrating with the rest of the Foundation, provided it achieves regular maintenance.\n\nSCP-6307 requires little human input in order to function properly. This is achieved in part due to an [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ai-classification-guide artificial intelligence construct] housed within the network, a Class-IV Positive-Aligned Narrow Intelligence known as Sneed.aic. //(See: History)//\n\nSneed.aic, although sentient, is rather narrow-minded in its tasks, only ever choosing to speak if addressed directly. For this reason, and to maximize productivity, personnel assigned to SCP-6307 are advised to refrain from engaging in casual conversation with the AI.\n\n----\n\n**History:** The construction of SCP-6307 began in 1968, when former RAISA computer technician Terry Sneed drafted a proposal to the O5 Council for Project Galactica, an effort to fully digitalize the Foundation's logistical records for ease of access and storage. While highly-promising on paper, Project Galactica was ultimately rejected, due to the then-superfluous costs associated with fully-digitizing the Foundation's records. \n\nHowever, the O5 Council would direct Sneed to Dr. Isaac Whitaker of the Logistics & Transportation division, whom had a similar goal in mind with his drastic reform of the department he now led. Sneed and Whitaker would later become founding members of the department, and would collaborate on a myriad of projects, including a prototype logistical computer network built inside Section A of the fledgling Site-122.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-features-source |hover-enlarge=--]\n|enlarge-amount=6\n|speed=250\n|float=true\n|align=right\n|width=300px\n|url=sneed.png\n|add-caption=true\n|caption=Terry Sneed, circa 1970\n]]\n\nIn 1971, with approval of the O5 Council, Terry Sneed would acquire 5 Foundation DataBank 1012 computers, and began construction of what would later become SCP-6307. Originally unaided in his process, a number of L&T personnel would soon pitch in to the monumental effort, including Dr. Whitaker himself. Although some team members believed that Sneed's project was ultimately futile, costly, and time-consuming, Dr. Whitaker supported the project wholeheartedly, and personally assisted Sneed in constructing and testing SCP-6307 on multiple occasions.\n\nIn March of 1982, halfway through the construction of the SCP-6307 terminal, Terry Sneed would suddenly die in his sleep, and progress on the project froze. With an inspection date of May 1982 approaching, Whitaker took charge of the project and rushed its completion, referencing heavily from Sneed's rather incomprehensible notes and blueprints.\n\nDuring the inspection, it was discovered that SCP-6307's internal software and several hardware components had been modified through anomalous means to account for a 50% increase in processing power and data storage. In addition, an artificial intelligence construct identifying itself as Sneed.aic was present in the terminal, which no member of the team had any recollection of implementing whatsoever.\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum 6307.1:**\n= Initial Contact\n\nWith no way to properly verify Sneed.aic (then-designated as SCP-6307-B) as a Foundation-made program, SCP-6307 was officially registered as an anomaly in late May of 1982, and was placed into containment in Section A of Site-122. Dr. Whitaker was personally tasked with conducting an interview with SCP-6307-B to ascertain its directive and identify any other changes anomalously made to the machine. \n\n[[collapsible show=\"<< ACCESS INTERVIEW #6307-01 >>\" hide=\">> HIDE EXCERPT <<\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **ARCHIVAL RECORDING #6307-01**\n= **ARCHIVE DATE:** MARCH 15, 1982\n----\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Dr. Whitaker enters SCP-6307's containment unit.]//\n\n**[WHITAKER:]** //(Speaking into recording device)// For the record.

After a brief consultation with the Classification Committee, SCP-6307 was reclassified as Thaumiel, and a containment unit housing SCP-6307 in its entirety was constructed at Site-122. \n\n----\n\n= **Addendum 6307.2:**\n= Project Update\n\nBelow is an update pushed by Dr. Whitaker regarding SCP-6307's performance on February 16, 1984.\n\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** SCP-6307 Staff, L&T Admin\n**Bcc:** Overwatch Command\n**From:** Dr. Isaac Whitaker\n**Subject:** 6307 update 2/16/1984\n[[/div]]\n------\nTeam,\n\nImpressive is an understatement. SCP-6307 remains in regular working order as of writing this message. Upon its completion and the integration of Sneed.aic, we saw positive results almost immediately. Throughput across the Foundation has increased drastically, and our delivery times have similarly decreased. This machine does not do //all// of the work for us, of course, but to call it useful is an understatement — it is //vital//. That is why, effective immediately, I am asking for the weekly maintenance checks to now become daily maintenance checks. Any abnormalities are to be reported and dealt with.\n\nFollowing the installation, though, I noticed a few oddities in SCP-6307's daily reports, as well as a few unusual requests. There is definitely something strange and peculiar to the machine's mannerisms. One noteworthy example is when I found out it had transferred a great deal of its maintenance staff to Armed Site-21, requesting an equal transfer of technicians from AS-21 to our Site in return. \n\nIn the meantime, I've assigned Mobile Task Force Beta-17 \"Truck Freaks\" to follow up on any unusual requests and their intended destination. Should any more of these discrepancies become known to me, I will push out an additional update.\n\nDr. Isaac Whitaker\n----\nSite-122 Director\nLogistics & Transportation Division Director\nSecure, Contain, Protect\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n\n=  ##transparent|.##\n\n----\n\n= **Addendum 6307.3:**\n= Additional SCP-6307 Correspondence\n\nAlthough SCP-6307 remained in regular operation for much of the 90s and onwards, its hardware still remained vastly outdated; old and nearly incompatible with newer, more experimental systems. With the rest of the Foundation speedily digitalizing their systems and records, SCP-6307 was steadily upgraded with more antiquated software and hardware, though its setup remained mostly unchanged.\n\nOn 7/18/1998, a heated email exchange between Director Whitaker and Dr. Marcus L.
