His name is Archivist Morgan and he's heading for the medical bay in order to amnesicize himself. Please stop him, I don't trust his ability to regulate himself in his current state. He is identifiable by being the guy running through the hallways screaming \"I quit\" at the top of his lungs. Thank you. - Archivist Hansen//\n\n//Note: I've seen 914 archivists melt down before, but this is the most entertaining one I've seen yet. Usually they just start crying on their desks, which is kinda underwhelming. - Archivist Hansen//\n\n------\n**Test 914-0401**\n**Name:** Dr. Vand\n**Date:** 08/02/2019\n**Total items:** One red marker and a sticky note\n\n//Note: I wonder what he’ll write -Dr. Vand//\n\n**Input:** Above mentioned\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A sticky note covered in red.

Fully armed complete with apparently RC ASW helicopters and guided missiles, interior has space for one person crawling with little extra room.\n\n//First, how did he fit that zodiac in the input booth, I was told he brought it in fully inflated. Second, how do we get this thing unstuck from the output booth? Its bigger than the doorway is, if all else fails we better call in the demolition crew to hopefully take it apart in a way that can be repaired. - Chief Arleigh Burge//\n\n//Note: You're not coming within 10 meters of the machine, Burge, and neither does Brandt after this. - Veritas//\n\n------\n**Test 914-0409**\n**Name:** D-92627\n**Date:** 12/02/2019\n**Total Items:** One toothbrush shiv\n\n//Note: This incident occurred as a part of a minor outbreak attempt that was neutralised quickly after. The item meant for testing was not used.//\n\n**Input:** Toothbrush shiv\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A slightly shorter unsharpened toothbrush.\n\n//Note: Class-D was terminated before 914 finished on the grounds that he was trying to make a stronger weapon.

The camera continues to be functional.//\n>\n> **00:12:** //The camera exits the enclosed space and falls into a contraption similar in appearance to a conveyor belt, built entirely in pulleys and gears.//\n>\n> **00:15:** //The inside of SCP-914 is noted to be larger than its outside, as the conveyor belt is surrounded by a large amount of empty space, which is filled with [REDACTED]. Four towers, estimated to be several kilometers high, are seen in the distance. Further examination reveals these towers to be entirely constructed out of [REDACTED] and other unknown materials.//\n>\n> **00:16:** //Several machines extend from the fog and begin to [REDACTED], changing the camera's shape. Before connection is cut, footage of a humanoid entity is seen behind one of the machines. Further examination reveals this to be [DATA EXPUNGED]. The subject's lower body is missing, the subject's torso is suspended within the air, and their spine extends down below the conveyor belt, with the spine having approximately 6000 vertebra.//\n>\n> **00:19:** //A final machine extends from the fog and [REDACTED], causing the camera's connection to be severed.//\n>\n\n//Note: It is to be noted that the three cameras that SCP-914 spat out had a higher than baseline cognitohazardous residue corruption.

When plugged into a compatible device it functions normally, is notably more accurate than comparable ball mice from the same era and removes all forms of mouse acceleration.\nIt also overrides and assumes control of all mouse pointers in a --20-- --50-- 100m radius.\n\n//Note: I would like to apologize to all staff members whose work was interrupted between 12:00 and 13:00 before that last bit was discovered, the mouse has been incinerated – Dr. Playford//\n\n//Note: The closest on-site infirmary was 125 meters away. Don't know how that would've ended, probably medical file deletion? Either way, I'm surprised this came from a \"Fine\" input. - Dr. Range//\n\n//Note: Correct, was supposed to be \"Very Fine,\" fixed. – Dr. Playford//\n\n----\n**Test 914-0414**\n**Name:** Dr. Thompson\n**Date:** 16/02/2019\n**Total Items:** The compilation game Mother 1 and 2 for the game boy\n**Input:** Above mentioned\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The game Mother 3.

However, once swiped by a hand, the location would shift with respect to the motion of the hand. All //de facto// administrative divisions, correct as of the present, up to the fourth-tier, as well as rivers, can be seen on the map. However, the map ratio is always strictly 1:100000 regardless of position. No anomalous effects occur if the map is folded.\n\n//Note: When I shifted it to French Guiana, it apparently treated the French Region as an independent state, with its Arrondissements (3rd tier in France) and Communes (5th tier in France) treated as its first and second tier administrative regions. -Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Right now, I've set the map to the area of Georgia, Abkhazia, both Ossetias, and that whatever Karachay-Cherkessia and Kabardino-Balkaria that is. It's in the break room for those of you wanting it. -Cleveland//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-0418**\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher Stan\n**Date:** 17/02/2019\n**Total Items:** One blank testing form for SCP-914 experiments, small container of printer ink.\n\n//Note: Since 914 has been shown to utilize writing utensils and materials, I wanted to see what it would fill in.// - Stan\n\n**Input:** Testing form, printer ink\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The output form was filled in with the proper documentation for the current experiment, including Jr. Researcher Stan's notes.\n\n//Note: Basically the output was what you just read and are currently reading.

All other characters immediately stopped their previous activity, before rushing to beat the character resembling Dr. Sheath to death. After two minutes, all characters returned to their previous positions and continued the scene as normal; after the camera cut, the body resembling Dr. Sheath was no longer present.\n\n//Note: And that's it for me, folks. See you all later, I'm never touching this movie again. Leave it to the experts, I guess. - Dr. Sheath//\n\n------\n**Test 914-0421**\n**Name:** Dr. Iunvey\n**Date:** 18/02/2019\n**Total Items:** One bowl of generic brand macaroni and cheese sauce.\n\n**Input:** One bowl of generic brand macaroni and cheese sauce.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One bowl of Fettuccine Alfredo.

The number itself has a cognitohazardous effect that, if fully enumerated (which, given current technology, is impossible given the impossibility to calculate the full value of Graham's Number), will wipe out all life (up to and inclusive of [[[SCP-682]]]) in the universe. As the existence of θ′ itself has been contained, it is necessary for researchers to be notified of this derived number.\n\n//Note: By inserting files of a researcher and an SCP subject, I ended up with this cognitohazard of a number. To whoever is next, I have this warning: 914 is unpredictable. Don't mess it around. -Cleveland//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-0423**\n**Name:** Dr. Illumia\n**Date:** 18/02/2019\n**Total Items:** A cheese sandwich containing two slices of white bread, two slices of sharp cheddar, and a single slice of muenster cheese.\n\n**Input:** The aforementioned sandwich.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A cheese sandwich containing two slices of whole wheat bread, two slices of sharpened cheddar, and a single slice of muenster cheese.\n\n//Note: Very tasty, although it did cut my tongue several times. - Illumia.//\n\n-----\n**Test 914-0424**\n**Name:** Dr. Brill\n**Date:** 18/02/2019\n**Total Items:** One Prince Rupert's drop.\n\n**Input:** One Prince Rupert's drop, as mentioned before.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One western honey bee (//Apis mellifera//) constructed completely out of glass.

This vinyl has several anomalous properties, including: The run time on each side is 2 hours instead of 20 minutes, there are 13 bonus tracks on each side of the album; none of which are known to exist, and the vinyl will always play at 45 rpm.\n\n**Input:** One copy of Floral Shoppe.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A pink and black checkered hovering sphere made of vinyl. The entirety of Vektroid's discography plays from the sphere, and the sphere seems to be sentient, and can communicate VIA a form of telepathy. The sphere also seems to be very fond of Dr. Kenua and is currently under evaluation for possible SCP classification.\n\n-----\n**Test 914-0427**\n**Name:** Dr. Wallace\n**Date:** 19/02/2019\n**Total Items:** Two terrestrial globes, both having all the countries of the world and major cities of each respective country.\n\n**Input:** One terrestrial globe.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A globe of the moon, major craters are outlined.\n\n**Input:** One terrestrial globe.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A globe of an unknown exoplanet, no outlines or other information can be seen on the respective globe , upon physical contact, a voice is heard telling the individual: \"RUN\", \"ESCAPE\", \"BE PREPARED\", \"YOU ARE OUR TARGET\".\n\n//Note: Upon further testing on the globe, the voice appears to be male of nature, and only the individual making physical contact with the globe is able to hear the voice.

The label read \"**Bomb**astic Explosive Flavor!\" with no nutrition information or ingredients.\n\n//Note: We've decided to test this in a reinforced chamber with a remote arm. I think you know why. -Stan//\n\n//Results: A technician operated the remote arm from behind reinforced glass with Jr. Researcher Stan. The remote arm poured the mix into a glass of water. Drink mix was shown to be colored bright red. Upon fully diffusing into the water, it began to violently react and created a small explosion, destroying the glass and sending shards throughout the room. Remote arm and drink pouch were unharmed.//\n\n//Note: I was expecting something more grenade-like, but it was awesome anyway. We got permission to break open to pouch over a 20-liter tub. -Stan//\n\n//Results: Remote arm was used to crush the pouch, spilling most of its contents into the tub. After roughly five minutes, the water in the tub began to react, bubbling and spilling its contents, making loud gurgling noises. A loud bang is audible as the camera feed cuts out. Later inspection shows the camera was destroyed when a piece of the tub impacted it and broke it open, allowing water to damage the circuitry. The remote arm was also destroyed by a mixture of blunt force damage, shrapnel, and water.//\n\n//Note: Anybody got some clean pants I can borrow? -Stan//\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 043X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 043X Test Logs\"]]\n------\n**Test 914-0430**\n**Name:** Sr. Researcher Calloway\n**Date:** 20/02/2019\n**Total Items:** 3 vials of aerosol amnestic solution.\n\n**Input:** 1 vial of aerosol amnestic solution.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 1 vial of liquid.

The rubber tips appear to have been melted and hardened into slugs fitted into foam casings. The bottoms of the casings are designed to compress air going in and launch the slugs at high speed. The amount of rubber needed to create a slug that fit the casings appears to have been borrowed from other darts, as there were fewer output darts than input and a small pile of foam was found in the output chamber. Slugs cannot be refit into their respective casings after being fired.\n\n//Note: They fit into standard Nerf blasters and magazines, but there isn't any way to eject spent shells, meaning that you can only use one dart.

The knees and elbows resemble round, bulbous spheroids constructed out of a flesh/[REDACTED] concentrate. The forearm is capable of moving around these bulbs using specific placement of cartilage and thigh tissue. The subject's mouth resembles that of a \"nutcracker\", capable of moving up and down when stimulus is applied to the subject's stomach area. A steady stream of saliva consistently exits this mouth. Before expiring, the subject vocalized //\"and all the players a stage\"// to 5 nearby security guards that were attempting to neutralize it.\n\n//I heard those words. I heard them clearly.

When disturbed, several clay honeybees flew out of multiple hidden holes on the hive's surface. They appear to have been flying through anomalous means. The bees were unable to sting any of the personnel present due to the softness of their material, but they were able to fly into them at high speeds. This tactic would cause the bees to destroy themselves, but left large welts on the personnel's skin. The beehive was eventually destroyed by security.

When activated, it emits Gamma radiation. D-Class Personnel expired due to acute radiation poisoning. Notably, when the lamp was deactivated by remotely controlled drone, all traces of radiation dissipated immediately, unlike normal Gamma radiation which can linger for centuries.\n\n//Note: So, the logic behind this is that light is essentially a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum with a wavelength inside the visible spectrum. Increase the frequency enough, and you get ultraviolet light, X-rays, and eventually Gamma rays. 914 seems to be functioning as well as can be expected in its state, carry on people. - Veritas//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0481**\n**Name:** Researcher I.

These lights are extremely inefficient, extremely bright (but not as bright as some pre-existing alternatives), and extremely short-lasting (averaging 1 hour use before burning out), effectively making them useless. I've left them in non-anomalous item storage, just in case someone thinks up a use for them. - MT Johnson//\n\n**Input:** 100 identical florescent light bulbs\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One floating sphere made of plastic and metal surrounded by a sphere of glowing gas. Moving the sphere with tools (as the heat produced by the object made physically touching it impossible) caused the sphere of gas to move with it. The gas remained anomalously stable during transport, remaining in a perfect sphere around the core at all times, regardless of the speed or direction of transport.\n\n//Note: This... shouldn't be working like this. Florescent bulbs work by producing UV light, which then gets converted into visible light by the glass of the bulb, so we shouldn't be seeing anything but the core. Also, how the heck is this thing producing heat and light with no input whatsoever? Then again, this was made by 914. I'm pretty sure that it's never heard of the laws of physics, or at least doesn't take them seriously. - MT Johnson//\n\n------\n**Test 914-0487**\n**Name:** Dr. N████ Trandfir\n**Date:** 23/03/2019\n**Total Items:** One USB drive, containing a copy of the Valve game //Half-Life//\n\n\n**Input:** One copy of //Half-Life//\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One copy of the //Half-Life// fan game //Hunt Down The Freeman//\n//Note: As Expected.

Analysis on their possible meaning is ongoing, though low-priority.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Mood Setting:** Curious\n**Output:** An irregularly-shaped ball-peen hammer with a stainless steel handle and a wooden head.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Mood Setting:** Curious\n**Output:** A music box composed of oak and stainless steel which plays the hook of \"U Can't Touch This\" by MC Hammer.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Mood Setting:** Curious\n**Output:** A small war hammer adorned with Nordic runes. When held by a human, the holder is possessed by an entity calling itself 'Asmund', claiming to be a deceased viking warrior. Entity is mostly non-hostile, and will primarily recount glorified tales of its supposed exploits. Removing item reverts its holder to their normal state of mind.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Mood Setting:** Malicious\n**Output:** Ashes and molten steel. Molten steel proved excessively difficult to remove - ultimately requiring the entire output booth floor to be replaced.\n\n//Note: Usually 914 resorts to scare tactics or physical harm. Toil is an entirely other\nechelon of malice, I'd say. - Dr. Harper//\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Mood Setting:** Malicious\n**Output:** Item appeared unchanged. A D-class was instructed to retrieve it. Upon touch, the item collapsed seemingly into dust. Testing has determined that breathing the dust will cause an allergic reaction in which an itchy rash will form whenever the recipient is in physical contact with hammers.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Mood Setting:** Malicious\n**Output:** A hammer which had been stretched to a length of 4 meters and 22 centimeters, fitting into the output chamber from corner to corner. Item was broken in two in order to retrieve it. Item weighs exactly the same as the original hammer.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Mood Setting:** Malicious\n**Output:** A hammer which switches places with whatever item it hits. No upper limit to the weight or dimensions of such objects has been found.\n\n//Note: This is a major containment issue. When in contact with any matter, it counts\neven tiny vibrations as \"hitting\", eventually wriggling out of piles of sand and even\njelly.

Testing was at first inconclusive. After 24 hours of disuse, the item duplicated itself. Further testing has confirmed that the [[[SCP-871 |item duplicates itself whenever it isn't used at least once in any given 24 hour period, with all copies retaining the anomalous properties.]]] All resulting hammers successfully contained.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Mood Setting:** Insightful\n**Output:** A ball-peen hammer broken in two. Analysis suggests item was broken by stress from overuse.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Mood Setting:** Insightful\n**Output:** Irregular wooden tubes aligning to the tree rings found on the original hammer. Two irregular metal objects, one pure iron and the other pure chromium. Analysis suggests that the metals are arranged in the shape in which they were originally contained as ores.\n\n**Input:** One Ball-peen hammer\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Mood Setting:** Insightful\n**Output:** A small device with a stainless steel outer shell and three buttons. Each button corresponds to a single wooden slab which protrudes out from the top of the machine via a simple non-anomalous mechanism. The slabs read \"Baa Baa\", \"Dolly\" and \"Shaun\" respectively.
