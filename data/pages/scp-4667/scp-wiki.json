The tracking of abnormal tooth growth in coastal and ocean fauna is to be used to locate its precise whereabouts.\n\nOnce SCP-4667 is found and contained, it is to be stationed in a standard humanoid containment chamber located approximately 100m away from any population of organisms possessing teeth. Necessary living procedures, such as feeding, are to be performed by a D-Class which is to have their teeth pulled prior. \n\n**Description:**  SCP-4667 is a mute, 26-year-old humanoid female of Soviet descent. SCP-4667 has been diagnosed with total anodontia[[footnote]]A genetic disorder causing a total lack of teeth.[[/footnote]]. Organisms possessing deciduous and/or succedaneous teeth in near proximity[[footnote]]Believed to be approximately 70-100m.[[/footnote]] to SCP-4667 will be subjected to a dental-transfigurative effect.\n\nSaid organisms' teeth will begin to slowly elongate vertically, with new teeth spontaneously growing directly from the skeletal system, starting from the jawbones. These newly developed teeth will similarly elongate, eventually puncturing through the skin and internal organs. The rate of this effect is sporadic, with current theories suggesting that SCP-4667 is capable of partially controlling the rate of tooth growth.\n\nThis effect persists after the subjects are deceased. Organisms affected by SCP-4667 will primarily expire via tooth growths elongating through vital organs, commonly from the teeth in the lower jaw elongating through the roof of the mouth and into the brain. Once affected cadavers leave the presence of SCP-4667, elongated tooth growths will begin to collectively bend and grow into large, intricate models and sculptures of varying subject. The following are known instances of said sculptures: \n\n* A feminine winged humanoid, cradling a child. Grown out of a human male.\n* Multiple humanoids, all appear malnourished, and are in positions of anguish. Grown out of a colony of European bats.\n* A larger feminine winged humanoid, its arms are extended out over multiple other humanoids. Grown out of a human male.\n* Multiple humanoids, all appear to be joyous, and are holding objects resembling foodstuffs. Grown out of a human male.\n* Multiple humanoids, all of which in aggressive positions, a winged humanoid is flying away from the aggressive humanoids. Grown out of a human male.\n* A feminine humanoid, noticeably larger and less well-constructed as other instances, is seen crying. Grown out of a human male. \n\n---------------\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=http://smlt.wdfiles.com/local--files/lamentte:0/russ|\n    caption=,,Russ Stanford, circa 1977.,,| align=left|\n    width= 155px\n\n]]\nAlthough SCP-4667 is known to exist, it has never been in Foundation custody. SCP-4667 originates from Byrkisk, USSR, where it was originally studied by Iosif Jekaterina, a local dentist. SCP-4667's anomalous effects were then reported to an British colleague Russ Stanford. \n\nStanford is known to be a leader of GoI-0435, \"The Dentist's Collective of Britain\", a group originally created as a workers union for dentists, but gradually changed their efforts towards the study of anomalous and non-anomalous practices of dentistry and genetic dental disorders. \n\nUpon hearing of SCP-4667 and its anomalous effects, Stanford requested for SCP-4667 to be relocated to his office in the United Kingdom. In conjunction with Stanford, Jekaterina procured the British cargo ship SS //Mavis// via bribery of the ship's crewmen. On 10/19/85, //Mavis// began sailing to the United Kingdom with SCP-4667 locked in the cargo hold.\n\nDuring this, all crewmen succumbed to SCP-4667's effects, with Jekaterina and SCP-4667 disappearing. \n\nThe following are notable video surveillance logs aboard //Mavis//:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **VIDEO LOG**\n---------\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=http://smlt.wdfiles.com/local--files/lamentte:0/ship|\n    caption=,,SS //Mavis//, sailing away from the USSR.,,| align=right|\n    width=270px\n\n]]\n\n@@     @@**Key:**\n\n* Boleslav Kondrat - Captain\n* Carlton Tilda - Chief Mate\n* Kenelm Hyram - Chief Engineer\n* Wilhelm Cale - Second Mate\n* Sebastian Wendell - Deckhand\n* Iosif Jekaterina - Dentist, Impromptu Ship Doctor\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n------\n{{CARGO HOLD - 23:02}} \n\n(//SCP-4667 is in a small room to the side of the cargo hold, Wendell is outside of this room's door.
