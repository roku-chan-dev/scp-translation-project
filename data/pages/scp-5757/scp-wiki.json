Video output by SCP-5757-A is subject to algorithmic monitoring in order to ensure its accuracy.\n\nWildlife agents have secured the perimeter of the Everglades Agricultural Area C-139 Annex with unauthorized persons being refused access under the guise of ongoing restoration work.\n\nAny attempt by SCP-5757-affected individuals enthralled by them to exit the C-139 Annex are to be repelled; lethal force is authorized for these efforts.\n\nAttempts to recover those affected by SCP-5757 have been discontinued. Lethal force is authorized to enact these procedures, if that becomes necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5757-A is the data for an unreleased and unfinished piece of software. Entitled \"Curse of the Everglade\" it is written with the [[[scp-5032| ICRDTA]]] programming language and is only compatible with original Atari Jaguar hardware.\n\nThe game world of SCP-5757 appears to correlate directly to approximately 15,000 acres of land within an Everglades Agricultural Area, hereafter referred to as SCP-5757-B. Actions taken within SCP-5757's game space can and will change the physical landscape, topography, and population of SCP-5757. \n\nAny sentient or sapient entities within SCP-5757-B, including humans, will be represented as spherical sprites by SCP-5757-A. Within the game space there is a persistent text bubble displayed above any human-representing sprites, giving information on their status, mood, and occasionally brief transcripts of their vocalizations.\n\nHowever, to date, it has proven impossible to play SCP-5757-A directly through the console - instead, it is believed that the game is played remotely by the first individual to gain physical access to SCP-5757-B with knowledge of its connection to SCP-5757-A.\n\n[[=]]\n**Addendum 5757-G:** Supplemental Documentation\n[[/=]]\n\n= //Excerpt from Curse of the Everglade game manual//\n\n> Society is ending…\n>\n> Darkness falling over our cities…\n>\n> Everglade, mankind's last bastion, is the place for rebuilding civilization!\n>\n> Gather resources, fight fearsome wildlife, and brave the ever-changing jungle!\n>\n> The future is up for grabs… can //you// become the Jaguar King?\n>\n> //Well, what else are you doing?//\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Access Document Arcadia-X\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\nThe following information was also enclosed with the manual:\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-5020/arcadia.png) center no-repeat ; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n> //At ##purple|Arcadia##, we're doing more than satisfying every holey bit where your craving is laying.

We did //not// anticipate the threat that would result from those capabilities expanding. I am writing, of course, of the skill tree that we found in the data of SCP-5757-A. As Subject 5757-1 expands its settlement and continues killing the local wildlife, it is gaining 'experience' - and it's using that experience to make itself more powerful.\n>\n> So far, we know it has access to these skills:\n>\n> * **Skill Share:** Skills possessed by one unit are shared by all controllable units. This is why they're all able to proficiently use the weapons they have access to.\n> * **Vital Boost:** All of the units are much more durable than ordinary human beings - they move faster and hit harder, too.\n> * **Revive:** If a living unit can get to a downed unit within a minute of it losing all its health, the downed unit can be revived.\n> * **Fine Control:** We're fairly sure this is the latest skill Subject 5757-1 has acquired. Previously, SCP-5757-1's commands were limited to simple things like 'go here, move this there, attack this'. Now, we're not certain of the level of control it can achieve.\n>\n> The next skill to be achieved is **Animal Call** - which allows the player to recruit animal units as well as human ones. If Subject 5757-1 achieves control over //all// the local wildlife, I don't think I need to say how much more difficult containment will become.\n>\n> Tracking the rate of experience gain, we're fairly sure that Subject 5757-1 will unlock this skill in five days time. If we're going to eliminate this threat, this is our last chance.\n>\n> //Requesting a termination order regarding Subject 5757-1.//\n>\n> Dr. Regal\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Expedition Summary\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n\n> Mobile Task Force Delta-43, \"Quarter Junkies\" was mobilized on 1/16/2019 to carry out the neutralization of Subject 5757-1.
