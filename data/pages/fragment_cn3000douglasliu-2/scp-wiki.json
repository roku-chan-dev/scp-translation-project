By taking out his own heart via Rarusium, he had his shifting eigenvector resided down at a specific mode of transformation, which enabled him to roam inside non-matters freely. After six standard months of investigation and inspection, our Society now has twelve serving Couriers that acquired such anomalous ability. They're to collaborate with each vacuole, carrying semantical flows with their flesh and blood and delivering them to every vacuole reachable.\n\nThe selection of Hollowed Couriers is tough. Not all individuals with a variable eigenvector are suitable to become a Hollowed Courier. Our discovery suggests candidates are required to sacrifice a part of their body in order to gain the ability to travel within non-matters. Our first Courier Yu Nuoda, as an illustration, afforded the price of losing his heart. Although not all Couriers have to become \"heartless\" like him, we still put \"sacrificing\" as a mandatory requirement for the Society's selection. This also signifies that every Hollowed Courier shall be embracing an unwavering determination. We solemnly pledge to dedicate ourselves to the career of tearing down the blockage named non-matter, to transmit semantical flows, and to establish a connection for our fragmented world once more. Today, the Society of Hollowed Couriers will set their sail.\n\nMay we build the Matrix one day.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** IL-03\n**Sender:** Liao Hong, Hollowed Courier\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI sacrificed my left eye to become a Hollowed Courier. Frankly, I don't mind it that much. Didn't Odin from Norse Mythology also lose one of his eyes for a drink in Well of Mímir? Though I wasn't seeking \"the ultimate wisdom\" or something anyway, I'm able to walk freely in non-matters now. That's quite cool.\n\nI'm looking forward to visiting other vacuoles. For local vacuole-born youngsters like me, marvelous legends out there in other numerous vacuoles were just fantasies. Well, in the past tense, because from now on, we the Hollow Couriers are about to witness those legends personally.\n\nI can't wait any longer!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** DV-R8\n**Sender:** Lü Hanshan, Lachrymose Chanter\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][DGDZACKM0ZOJ0WGJP6BU][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nNot all children born with non-matter accompanying can grow up to become Lachrymose Chanters. In fact, not even every one of us is able to grow up. We lived healthily with just a bit more tears, but how about others? This fact always gives me a sense of sorrow. Non-matters can not only appear within your brain but also have the chance to show up on any places of your body. Some may grow up with permanent disability, with the rest of their life contemplating this predestined misfortune.\n\nWell, I'm gonna say, you don't have to be a Lachrymose Chanter to be useful in our vacuole. You don't have to be like me; I will and always will admire you whatsoever, for it is just an arrangement made by heaven, that's all. Even if you live a mundane life, not being a Lachrymose Chanter, not being a Hollow Courier, not being a broadcaster or researcher ... As long as you have your own life, and write your own lines, and make your own poems, you are a dazzling one.\n\nFor all of you that lived your own lives, you deserved to be chanted, whether you are accompanied by non-matters, or by other things, or by nothing ...\n\nTell me! About your life, your desire, your words, your poems ... I will compose them into my songs. I will belt out the tales of yours!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** DV-R8\n**Sender:** Shu Yongmo, Lachrymose Chanter\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][UD1ROC1HAO4G0DBXPDO4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTo everybody in Vacuole DV-S8,\n\nToday I announce that, after nearly one standard year's preparation, the Chorus of Lachrymose Chanters is founded officially. Hurray!\n\nTaking Vacuole DV-S8 as our headquarters, we now have eight Lachrymose Chanters. They have all faced the threat of dying young because of non-matter accompanied birth, just like me. But we managed to survive it, grow up healthily and witness the overwhelming beauty and loveliness of this world. Thanks to the non-matter in our brains, we are indeed a bit too sensitive and tearful, yet it also offers us a sincere, exquisite capability of expressing our emotions. We excel at singing. Our carols are wordless, for we shall weave all sentiments and semantics directly within our melodies, to make every listener resonate with us upon their first hearing! So is how we, the Lachrymose Chanters, present ourselves!\n\nThe selection of Lachrymose Chanters is tough. To this day, non-matter accompanied birth is still an adversity that requires great struggle of the patient and medical practitioners to overcome. In addition, the talent of memetic singing is not granted for all of these individuals either; it is a skill that requires both inherent gifts and consistent efforts. A qualified candidate should bear a strong willingness towards hardships, which on the other hand signifies that every Lachrymose Chanter shall embrace an unwavering determination. We will deliver hope, deliver aspiration, deliver imagination, and deliver willingness, with our melodies and mastery of subtle emotions, to every vacuole that is ready to listen to our sounds! We now witness the dawn, under the pitch darkness in the wrapping of non-matters. Hope and aspiration shall be the fuel that keeps driving us forward.\n\nOf course, if you will, we can also become the bards of a new age. We're ready to tell and spread your heart's contents in the form of music. The weaving of memetic singing may not always align with your thoughts but ... Hey, who can say? Perhaps we can find out how brightly your emotion burns within the calmest words!\n\nToday witnesses the birth of the Chorus of Lachrymose Chanters. Everyone in Vacuole DV-S8, lend an ear for my singing —\n\n//[A soprano piece without lyrics with anomalous memetic properties. The audience would find themselves in the vast wilderness after a rainy dusk, with a scent of grass in their noses, sweet and fresh. Numerous crystal balls shimmered on and off like light bulbs, as if they were echoing with neighbors, or weaving a resonating texture with each other. The audience would look up to see a golden bolide piercing through the dark sky of non-matters, leaving behind a dazzling trail.]//\n\nThank you. Thank you all.

I don't mind accepting the title of \"First Fretting Goldsmith\".\n\nRarusium is such a marvelous kind of metal. So wonderful. Nobody can make it behave in the same way as others. We the Smiths have built an extraordinary connection with rarusium. To us, it is the most perfect kind of metal and the most perfect kind of material in general as well. Your craziest illustrations, most exquisite designs and ultimate techniques can all be realized with rarusium. And right now, there's something arising. Rarusium has become the essential weapon for the battle against non-matters. So, who will be better forgers for such a weapon than us?\n\nThe selection of Fretting Goldsmith is tough. I can't figure out a way to choose my next apprentice besides having everyone in this vacuole come and touch the rarusium. Me and Jin's meeting was totally an accident schemed by fate. But we the Guild of Fretting Goldsmiths should not be that kind of selfish and xenophobic organization. Now we've found a new way. Getting semantical flows out still is and will be hard, but we're making big progress. Share your skills, my smiths. The next Fretting Goldsmith may come up anytime anywhere in other vacuoles. They have the right to get their potential acknowledged.\n\nMay we build the Matrix one day.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** H5-BM\n**Sender:** Ba Hongjin, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][KOZZ99O45ISKXDR02EQ9][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI was worried that Master Kong might be unhappy with me ... I had no idea how he thought of the Guild. Although I’m almost a mature artisan now, I just don't have the ability to literally grab rarusium out of non-matters as Master Kong. Nowadays we have more advanced methods for obtaining them, but you need money for it. We're artisans, yes, but we're also merchants at the same time. I actually had no idea ... I mean, Master Kong is a pretty genuine person; I do believe he would like to forge rarusium items for anyone without charging anything. I just didn't know how he would think seeing us making sells and contracts.\n\nSurprisingly, Master did not have any objections at all. \"Don’t offer any discount on your talent, for they won’t be pleased and will leave you in the end if you do.\" That’s what he said.\n\nBut if you'd like to pay a visit to Master Kong’s studio in Vacuole H5-BM ... He won’t charge you for anything.

Little attention is demanded for one to hear the bubbling, sizzling sound from sources of fervency underneath the volcano's abyssal maw. One bubble breaks, then two, then three, enough to be noticed but not to be irksome, as if they are soothing you to sleep with white noise. I often wonder if the [[[SCP-1000 |Folks of Big Foot]]] had been accompanied by such sounds when they told stories inherited from ancestors and engraved them onto clay tablets.\n\nEven within chronicles dating back to the third millennium of the Old Calendar, pages where Folks of Big Foot are mercilessly scarce, which is not helped by the fact that they went as the shadows before the coming of non-matters. Someone says they concealed themselves inside the most lonesome delves and had stepped into non-matters upon the demise of old normalcy; with semantical flows in litura diluviorum as ramparts, they had rebuilt the kingdom of their own. However, I always hold a deep skepticism toward such a story. Turning eyes to the tablets remained in the foothills, and arcane writings would not share their mysteries even to the most erudite historians and culturologists. More than half of a century has passed, yet not a single of the characters can be deciphered.\n\nLegends claim the Folks had written the profoundest wisdom of their nation on clays. Their consonants are fractured rubbles on Mount Zhurong, their vowels are turbid water in Mount Zhurong, and their numbers are hovering crows above Mount Zhurong, their punctuations are blazing lava out from Mount Zhurong. Impractical is the abstract and poetic description, but a message it indeed conveyed to me: one has to be on Mount Zhurong if they are to comprehend what are on the tablets by the Folks.\n\nSquandering all transmission windows available to me, I finally reached the Vacuole VL-13 which upholds Mount Zhurong. What I could find was merely the vast devastation and nothingness; scorch temperature with desertic air roughened and cracked the surface of anything existing. However, to peruse the clay tablets of the Folks, I knew I had to endure, to fit myself in all this savageness and let them merge into my skin, blood and depth of my soul. I needed to become a true Folk of Big Foot with my best efforts to even seize a chance to gaze on their wisdom.\n\nI so lived for some months on Mount Zhurong, but still unrewarded.\n\n[[>]]\nAuthor: An Ji\nWritten for //Asagao Literature Gazette//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** FE-NV\n**Sender:** Liao Yiyi, resident\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][8JXHF6P9HKIWSH7VWD83][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nQian, I'm sinking into the trench.

Perhaps it was because we were busy monitoring the non-matter conditions in the vicinity and searching transmission windows; perhaps it was because we were busy decoding stories from other vacuoles within bits and bobs of information coming out from semantical flows suffered from litura diluviorum; or perhaps we were merely too used to the irregular look of vacuoles and thought none could be surprising; or it was that we were afraid of adventures to that surface of glittering waves resembling surge of non-matters.\n\nOr one can argue that we were tired in these long and changeless days. We were tired of researching. We chose to return to our families, our normal lives, without anomalies.\n\nYet changes have taken place in these days now. Rarusium, eigenvector, Nodes ... New hopes reignited our curiosities, driving us to find an explanation for the properties of that liquid. It is a type of perfluoroalkyl compound. Clean, pure, near inexhaustible. Guo Zizhuo, a Junior Researcher from our institute, tied a cable around his waist and sketched a thaumatic anti-gravity sigil. Then he rose to the sky and got submerged into the liquid. He removed his helmet, confirming the nature of the liquid with the rising and falling of his chest.\n\nMy daughter often says, \"Daddy, look! The water in the sky is so beautiful!\" when I take her out for walks. Now I can tell her, \"Rou, that liquid is greater than water. You can breathe inside it.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** X0-BA\n**Sender:** Gegeen Tuyaa, Captain\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][1Y7UEE1VU3EMSUHM22E4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWe might not get a chance to know about Nodes if not a Hollowed Courier just came to our Vacuole before. His arrival proves one thing: those suns, those ten things blocking our path forward entire, shall perform their lawless conducts no more.\n\nSo I made a squad. Ten operatives, five men and five women, all elite archers. We wear badges made from rarusium to raise everyone's morale, which resembles a bow on top of a bundle of arrows. At midnight when the sunlight was at its weakest, we marched into the western forest and tracked down one of the suns from its remaining light. It floated motionlessly on a small pond. Even though its brightness had been whittled away by the night, marks would still appear and linger on one's eyeballs upon looking at it. I shot my arrow toward it without hesitation.\n\nAnd it explodes, brilliance like tangible objects sprinkled all over us. Bayar closed his eyes not quickly enough and got near-blinded even till today. Raran and I hid between rocks and trunks, and with good cooperation with other teammates, we managed to make the sun retreat to a gravelly corner. Naran shot from the dark, hitting straight at its core. The sun had a rapid internal collapse before vanishing completely.\n\nIt is a shame that our victory was not an unalloyed one. Less than two minutes after we headed to our camp, my fellow at the watch tower reported that a new light beam had shown up in the forest.\n\nThat sun can revive.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** Q4-9W\n**Sender:** Cang Miyun, Intranet Administrator\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][XFHY1PN5095B3URS7PTB][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\ni got the news coming from vacuole c0-bk. hope hollowed couriers can help bring this message to their admin.\n\nour vacuole's intranet got non-matter attacks for a while some time ago. we literally got our ass kicked until we figured out ... to stop expansion and divide the network into more tiny clusters, only keeping the most basic 443 port to communicate. go back to stone age, basically. attack rate dropped after we did it.\n\ni know this sounds like yielding but ...yeah this is the only way we know is effective. the algorighm of non-matters ... it hates unity; it hates seeing us unite together and develop bigger. it will never stop biting ur asses unless u stop expanding.\n\ngood luck fellas ... oh dont forget to check ur raid. we learned our lesson the hard way ↲\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 5Z-EG\n**Sender:** Song Fangfei, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][2TRZ94MGUT2IFRCZ2L79][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOur vacuole has heard those things about Nodes and the Nodal Matrix.

Cyberspace is way larger than vacuoles in reality with endless possibilities in there. It's a shame that the alarm went off too soon and they kicked me out when I only got a little satisfied.

I am sure this phenomenon is anomalous because it is not affected by location; even if I enter a room and lock it up, with only the ceiling above, the mirror on top of the rarusium would nevertheless still reflect the rippling sky of Vacuole AQ-9S.\n\nOut of instinct, I gently tossed the rarusium up, and I didn't think it would levitate straight to the sky and sink into the lake. Researchers in my institute told me don't ignore what hint rarusium had given me, so I tethered a rope on my and went up using a thaumaturgic sigil as Ziyao did before. To take off your helmet within perfluoroalkyl compound requires courage. I got quite uncomfortable at first when the liquid went in my lungs, but quickly I got used to that feeling of being drowned, as if a blurring filter was applied to the whole world.\n\nHowever, things turned dangerous in just a few seconds. I raised my head and noticed a pitch-black sphere sitting right at the depth of the upside-down lake, to which my piece of rarusium was accelerating toward it. I immediately made a comparison and found it was strikingly similar to a black hole; colleagues on the ground surface confirmed my thought and said AIC had detected a red shift effect on my body, though very small. Meanwhile, I felt a stream of semantics — semantical flows from other vacuoles — slipping through my fingers shortly and soon they floated up into the black hole in the sky.\n\nThe black hole ... Could it be the reason why there is a lake of perfluoroalkyl compound on our Vacuole? And those semantical flows broadcasted by other vacuoles ... Would they be consumed by the black hole even though they have resisted the effect of litura diluviorum?\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-7\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-7\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** VL-13\n**Sender:** An Ji, writer\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][C1ORTC1CAHXMMT413UZT][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI was not a believer in rarusium; I didn't think it would provide any help to my work. However, as the clay tablets were tidied, I discovered thin rarusium adhering within the concaves from writings. I scraped it out with a stalk of milfoil. Upon making contact with the air, rarusium lit up to life like charms on pieces of paper burnt into flumes with the wind guiding dots of sparkling ashes to the volcanic crater of Mount Zhurong. I stayed prolonged at the low lands, as the caldera would be too searing for mankind; gazing beyond rushing heat waves, even non-matters in the background would turn into a spiral. But when all methods were exhausted, I must make try.\n\nI climbed up the umber volcanic rocks arranged in hexagonal prisms with all tablets and my portable AIC. At where it became steep, I was amazed to find out that there always would be a neat stairway of stones leading upward. It made me think whether these structures were formed by nature itself or the elevated techniques of the Folks of Big Foot made them suit so flawlessly with the environment. I could not fathom the origin of the rarusium until I finally reached the edge of the volcanic crater — scraps of rarusium floated around the galloping air as though a giant was buried here half a fortnight ago and Folks had incinerated rarusium in memorial. Apparently, this is my own imagination as I am afraid they would not know about rarusium when the Folks wrote down their wisdom on the clay.\n\nRight in this cruel land, I came to a revelation. Although I had been here, on the very Mount Zhurong and lived as the very Folks had lived, I never learned from the Folks to record, to write matters down. You have to become an engraver to understand the engravings. But in a place so devastated, whose story shall be worthwhile?\n\nI turned on the reception function of my AIC and began reading semantical flows traversing to the local vacuole. Non-matters still ravaged the world and the majority of flows were sunk by litura diluviorum. But as long as there could be some fragments of language ... There must be fragments of language to be understood. I hunkered down; I made tablets in accordance with the Folks' recipe out of the clay from Mount Zhurong; I grabbed a piece of shattered obsidian. Then, record.\n\nI shall do what the Folks of Big Foot did.\n\n[[>]]\nAuthor: An Ji\nWritten for //Asagao Literature Gazette//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-9\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-9\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** RW-55\n**Sender:** Shan Yiyu, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][PDARQ7TK4DICC0MD5WVE][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTo whoever is listening to my broadcast: I am Junior Researcher Shan Yiyu, specializing in [[[SCP-3688 |kinetoglyphs]]].

I am still looking for ways to leave this location. I need your rescue.\n\nAnd the following message is for myself:\n\nShan Yiyu, when you wake up again, go to everything in the AIC records about \"rarusium\" and \"eigenvector\". The litura diluviorum near here is pretty severe, so the only way to get yourself out is to attain a valid eigenvector. You're alone here, so there's nobody you can bank on except yourself. I've set the AIC to actively evaluate the litura diluviorum rate of any semantical flow you broadcasted. When it's below --95% 84%-- 62%, it'll play Beethoven's //Für Elise// automatically. Use it as a marker.\n\nOnce you figure out what's going on, don't waste any seconds and just perform PMK-02; it's best to do it for over 30 minutes because that can bring you five to six hours of time dilation. Quite economical, right?\n\nKinetoglyphs are your only hope. Go mess around with that rarusium in the center to find kinetoglyphs that resonates with it. Note: if it resonates, you shall feel a slight sense of being pulled and weak echoes; yell if you can't hear the sound. All tried combinations are listed later in the message. Pick one that looks nice to you and trust your instinct and your professional sensitivity to kinetoglyphs. PS: please don't do Group C of PMK-53. It backfires in this vacuole. If you don't believe it, just make a remark here in case you get confused about why another bruise appeared on your body. PS: don't do PMK-207. It will upset the rarusium and cause the next cycle to begin immediately.\n\nIt seems that rarusium is likely to be what traps you in the loop. PS: don't get angry about it. PS: that's really what I said; check the signature if you wish. When you see it starting to vibrate, go switch on your AIC and record your moves. You have at least 12 minutes to do this. When you see it starting to glow, prepare for the next cycle.\n\nLongest resonating sequence so far: PMK-160 ⇒ PMK-13 ⇒ PMK-437 ⇒ PMK-22 ⇒ PMK-72 (but the last move is pull, not push) ⇒ PMK-55 ⇒ PMK-217\n\nCome on, Shan Yiyu.

I, in the present era, wondered if their feelings would be the same as mine when I read the tablets by Folks of Big Foot as such because through ages so elongated, I ultimately got the progress I had been desiring.\n\nWith the carving of semantical flows, letters by the Folks started shifting, floating, even overturning. I could already hear their verses coming from the gone times, more and faster as I sped up my hand. It was not enough ... My fingers had distained and cracked, heat from the volcano had smoldered the tablets; I had reached the speed limit, but there still were hundreds of layers of mist between my eyes and their texts, there still were thousands of mountains of the distance between my ears and their voice.\n\nI needed to go faster, with all efforts being made ... and I wouldn't give up.\n\nSometimes I wrote on tablets through the entire night, so when I turned around, I would find a thick blanket of rarusium scraps covering me.

However, as the new normalcy has been established, and research and containment duties become mundane and boring, I have dropped this opinion. I met with my love; we got a daughter. Although I still work for the Foundation, I think I am now more of a normal person living peacefully in the vacuole.\n\nAnd then the calling came upon me. Judging from how the rarusium acted and others' research, the conclusion is very simple. I am the one able to attain valid eigenvector through going up, through submerging myself in perfluoroalkyl compound in the sky, through guiding the semantical flows at a position near the event horizon. As such, I can become a Node. There is only one person who can do it and that person is me.\n\nAs a member of the SCP Foundation, I have pledged to take such a responsibility. It is literally a miracle for a vacuole to find a Node. It is wrong of me to not ditch all my concerns, not to say becoming a Node is not that dangerous in the first place. But I ... Yes, I admit I hesitated. Being a Node means I would not be at home so much, and would not accompany my daughter so much.\n\nI would not have such worries if I did not make a family. But ... My family, my wife, my daughter, they have become the most wonderful things in my life. I cannot imagine a life withour them. I firmly believes that my encounter and life with them is destined. I have no choice on this, in effect.\n\nI brought my daughter to the Institute and taught her how to use a telescope to observe the lake above us. Then, I told her the mission I was given. I said, \"Daddy will miss you so much, but he is going to do what he should do anyway. Rou, what do you think daddy should do?\"\n\nRou said, \"If I allow daddy to be a Node, would it make my life happier?\"\n\nI smiled, \"Probably won't. But it will make this world a better place. People can travel between different vacuoles freely, talk to each other freely, without worrying if one day they'll sink into litura diluviorum.\"\n\nShe said, \"I'm already happy with mommy and daddy. I don't wanna travel to other vacuoles. I don't wanna talk to people from outside。\"\n\n\"If that's the case,\" I replied, \"then daddy may not be a Node then.\"\n\nMy daughter looked at me in silence, then she asked, \"Are others looking for you to become a Node?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said.\n\n\"Will they be happy if you do?\" She asked.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nRou lowered her hand and thought for a while. Then she said, \"Daddy should be a Node.\"\n\n\"What makes you think so now?\" I asked.\n\nAnd she answered, \"Because, making others' dreams come true, is really cool.\"\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-10\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** X0-BA\n**Sender:** Gegeen Tuyaa, Captain\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][1Y7UEE1VU3EMSUHM22E4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI advanced quietly from a distant path, then killed the first sun on the fifth crossing. The rarusium badge made its first vibration.\n\nI climbed to the top of a tree, leaping from branch to branch, then killed the second lying in a bush. The rarusium badge made its second vibration.\n\nI dived into a stream with only my nose above water, then killed the third sun after sneaking to under the waterfall. The rarusium badge made its third vibration.\n\nThousands of rays of sun chased me. The fourth and fifth suns surrounded me at the end of the valley, but they did not realize that was merely my phantom out of thaumatology. I hid in a cavern nearby and killed the two suns. The rarusium badge made its fourth and fifth vibrations.\n\nThe sixth and seventh suns were lazy and ruthless. I lured them out of the cave with gunpowder. Their lights brightened the whole cave as if the day had come, without knowing that I was waiting on the peak. After they were exhausted, I killed them with shots one by one. The rarusium badge made its sixth and seventh vibrations.\n\nI killed the eighth sun on the canopy. The rarusium badge made its eighth vibration.\n\nI killed the ninth sun in the dried well. The rarusium badge made its ninth vibration.\n\nFinally, I chased the tenth sun to the end of the cliff. It was scared, it trembled, with the rarusium badge making its tenth vibration. I pulled my strings and aimed it, but got struck by hesitation. They were, after all, suns, the symbols of light. Maybe they were ... just doing what they were made to do, with no real malice whatsoever. If I killed all the suns, would the vacuole fade into eternal cold? But if I did not kill all the suns, everything would be in vain when they revive ...\n\nBut I had proven that I could conquer them. I was superior to them.\n\nSo I dropped my bow and let the tenth sun escape. It fell down the cliff, then were a million beams of light. The rarusium badge broke in front of me, meanwhile, I felt ripples coming from within and echoed through the entire vacuole.\n\nI think I have done something more valuable.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** AQ-9S\n**Sender:** Gao Anrou, resident\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][RB7XGO7ZQJ3LUR7U5B4Y][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nDaddy twinkles when he goes up in the sky.

This is where meaning lies, where profound significance resides.\n\nMaybe rarusium can help me find the most sincere meaning and pain of me.

Mount Zhurong of Vacuole VL-13 can be seen on the screen. The recorder in silver heat insulation suit sat on the ground with numerous clay tablets roughly the size of books scattered next to her. Tiny rarusium particles can be seen sparkling in the air. One end of a data cable was connected to the recorder's wrist port and the other end extended toward the camera, presumably connected to the AIC.//\n\n**An Ji:** On the second day of February 2137 of the Old Calendar, [[[SCP-CN-2000 |the Chaos Runners]]] revealed a large number of documents of the SCP Foundation to the general public. Those so-called battles of concepts are merely childish games not beyond a three-year-old's mental capacity from the perspective of today. Nonetheless, it did objectively promote the publication and advancement of many high-end technologies, which include this.\n\n//The recorder took out a light-gray box from her back. The box is identified to be a standard material printing box for AIC usage. The recorder opened the box and took an ampule holding with low amount of light-green-colored liquid from it.//\n\n**An Ji:** F-class Amnestics, codenamed \"FUGUE\", which used to be among the evidence the Chaos Runners provided to prove the incontrovertible crimes that the SCP Foundation had made. Nearly thousand years have passed and all the rights and wrongs have long gone with the old days. But the recipe for amnestics remains, and it develops and evolves through time. (//pause//) Elements on today's Mount Zhurong happen to be enough for me to print it out. I don't think it is a coincidence.\n\n//The recorder put the ampule on the ground and dusted the rarusium scraps on her body with her hands.//\n\n**An Ji:** My speed of engraving is still not fast enough — this is a sure thing as I don't understand what writing system the Folks of Big Foot were using. To break the impasse, I came up with a solution.\n\n//The AIC made an electronic beep. The recorder unplugged the cable and gently caressed the port on her wrist.//\n\n**An Ji:** I have constructed a language, using my own eigenvector as consonants, vowels, numbers and punctuations at the same time. Once I'm familiarized with it, I would be able to compress semantical flows coming through this vacuole at nearly the speed of light. To engrave on clay tablets as such, with this I believe I can be proximate enough to the Folks in the old days, who will allow me to pore over their tablets.\n\n//Brief silence.//\n\n**An Ji:** But I cannot make it for now. Even though it is a language created by me, it still isn't born with me as my native language. I am mother to it, and now I need it to become my mother tongue. To go even further, I need it to become the sole existence inside the depth of my soul.\n\n//The recorder looked silently at the ampule on the ground, then took it up. The noise of lava sprinkling can be heard from the background. The visual signal was distorted by the running of hot air.//\n\n**An Ji:** I just have compiled the entirety of my language to my portable AIC. It will be capable of decoding every record I make from here on. Now, I shall engulf this elixir to reconstruct my soul. I shall forget everything I knew from the past, with only the constructed language left, with only Mount Zhurong left, and with only the mission to finally decipher the clay tablets left by the Folks of Big Foot.\n\n//The recorder snapped the neck of the ampule. Bubbles started to emerge from the light-green liquid.//\n\n**An Ji:** I shall finish my writing.\n\n//The recorder raised her head and drank all of the liquid from the ampule in one gulp. A short silence later, the entire body of the recorder began to tremble violently meanwhile the sound of volcano eruption became clearer in the background. The recorder opened her mouth and yelled, but no voice had been recorded. After this, the recorder lowered her head and went into fetal position on the ground.//\n\n**An Ji:** ... Ba ...\n\n//With a splash, the recorder pushed all the tablets into the volcanic crater.//\n\n//<END LOG>//\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nNeighboring vacuoles received the eigenvector broadcast from Vacuole VL-13 after this record. Three standard months later, we assigned a Hollowed Courier passing by to head to the vacuole to investigate. Upon the volcanic crater, we found comrade An Ji who was persistently engraving on clay tablets and pushing them into the volcano. By the Courier's words, the language An Ji has been using since then was \"dry, thick and just so hot as Mount Zhurong\". All conversations with her could only be made with the translation service provided by her portable AIC. We asked if she was willing to become a Node. After finishing the engraving for fifty-seven tablets, the AIC made a confirmative answer.\n\nIt is true that comrade An Ji had managed to decipher the tablets of the Folks of Big Foot, and we had archived all source files of translation originally provided by the AIC. However, on the afternoon of the day when we logged them into our database, all the files were gone with only a short message with a signature of //\"Asagao Literature Gazette\"//, and it asked us to express their gratitude to An Ji for them. No sign of an entity named //\"[[[wanderers:asagao |Asagao Literature Gazette]]]\"// is found in all vacuoles within the Eastern Land.\n\nIf you are going to pay a visit to Vacuole VL-13, remember to prepare a heat insulation suit.

But this time no one is deflated to any extent. This time, I will not go alone, but not with teams either. We are independent hunters ... No. Our goal is not to kill the ten suns. We are not hunters, but dancers, dancing at the side of those ten suns. We will repeat shooting nine of them to death, and let one live so that they can revive later and the circle can continue. I can attain my valid eigenvector via continuous participation in \"sunhunting\" like this.\n\nLet it be a traditional festival of our vacuole, my fellows. We dance and dart, we feast and laugh.

What's more, every pluck on the string will resonate with the rarusium and amplify the eigenvector of whoever using it. That's what I made to gift the Sunhunter.\n\nAnd I made a patch of rarusium arrows, too. Same lightness, but sharp and fast at the same time. No need to save them, Madam.

I am sure you would be very welcome by all in my vacuole and I have heard about the idea that the SCP Foundation you are representing is attempting to construct the Nodal Matrix. I have no problem on this matter witnessing the sincerity and enthusiasm you and the Foundation behind you on your advertisement and lectures made for sharing knowledge about rarusium to my vacuole. It is a pity that I would like to decline your invitation to the entire population of this vacuole to attend the celebration at night. I beg your pardon on this.\n\nI have already been accustomed to the peaceful and serene life in my vacuole before your arrival. The local archive holds a considerable number of books from the Old Age and in my humble opinion, they are good enough to keep me occupied for decades. I am not a person who is fond of interaction and connection with other people as I tend to act poorly at interpreting their emotions and organizing my words on those occasions. Other residents of my vacuole might enjoy socializing though, therefore to avoid having to repeatly reject others' invitations, I have made up my decision to inform you of my conditions in advance. Please forgive my disturbance.\n\nI wish you a joyful life in Vacuole TK-3N.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-9\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-9\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** RW-55\n**Sender:** Shan Yiyu, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][PDARQ7TK4DICC0MD5WVE][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI never thought I'd come back again ... But the good news is, there won't be any time loops anymore.\n\nBeing an employee of the SCP Foundation, I know I must take the responsibility of becoming a Node — and it's sort of a promotion. Only in this vacuole can I do kinetoglyphs to resonate with that chunk of rarusium and attain my valid eigenvector. But I'm not going to be lonely here. New institutes are being set up, and many researchers as well as explorers yearning for new lands are coming too. This vacuole will get really heated soon.\n\nI don't quite like the rarusium here even today ... I just don't understand why it has to treat me like this. But, when I'm doing the movements, there will be a feeling ... Maybe it's trying to enlighten me; it sees my potential so it forces me to go forward, meanwhile sneakily guiding me to the right direction, showing me a miracle that I can't be dared to imagine. Or maybe it's just because it just feels unaccompanied; it might not be a native to this vacuole, and like me it came here merely out of an accident. So it wants to make the world connected like everyone who's making efforts right now; so it stopped me from leaving, for it didn't want to fade into darkness again. Or maybe ... You know, I shouldn't judge rarusium in the way I judge people.\n\nAll in all, here is not lonely, and the world is reconnecting.\n\nMay we build the Matrix one day.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** II-IY\n**Sender:** Xiao Teng, Hollowed Courier\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI met Mr. Yu Nuoda in Vacuole II-IY!

There might be some mishap happening to my last letter to you but I am still getting invitations to activities that you send to me. I would like to clarify that I am afraid I have little to no interest in the events you are involved. I would be pleased if you could discontinue the care for my simple life at the archive. Common people might find this place and its easy work dull and boring, but I feel rather comfortable and cozy here in fact.\n\nPlease do not misunderstand my meaning. I appreciate your passion and professionalism very much. Residents of my vacuole have high remarks of you and I have known a small portion of your kind deeds. Your persistence impresses me deeply even though the research into Nodes has not progressed much since your arrival, and holding events such as crowd-listening to concerts of Lachrymose Chanters makes our vacuole much livelier.\n\nI have absolutely no intention of refusing or opposing you and the SCP Foundation to find the next Node, but the thing is I am just not interested in it. With all due respect, I do not solely dislike interpersonal communication; I consider it as a thing that could do more harm than good. Looking into the not-too-distant past, I see countless tragedies caused by distrust and divergence between groups of people. The world had much greater connectivity back in that age, however, I did not see people becoming more relatable to each other; quite the opposite, opposing and extreme opinions raised wars all over the past world when we put themselves into different parties and factions with sharp languages piercing everyone's gore out. I feel lucky every time when I read these materials since the non-matters have divided us, to the point of even thinking if they came more lately, then the third World War might break out and you and I would perish after which.\n\nAllow me to clarify my position again: I am not going to refuse or oppose your action on building the Nodal Matrix. I only do not want to get involved, and I will not make my life involved even if you manage to do the thing. I already have everything I need in this place. I do not care about everything else.\n\nCease your disturbance, please, and thank you.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** SR-47\n**Sender:** Lü Feiang\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][3A2T5JJYP9OP6JX6E392][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI'm standing on the edge of a cliff. I'm waiting for the triple rainbow to show up, and when it shows up, I'll jump off and a hang glider will bring me to where the centers of rings overlap. I shall attain my eigenvector there and become a Node.\n\nIt's just that I don't know when it can show up ... Vacuole SR-47 is a desert, dry as hell and has no precipitation in the whole year ... But the only thing I can do is wait, and I will wait.

I shall be as profound as the eyes of the universe, as painful as the fangs from hell. But I just can't ... How should I paint infinity on my finite canvas? I can make the same circle once, twice, a thousand times, thousands of thousands of times, and my skin will eventually run out, not to say that even till the Heat Death of our world, the time consumed would not be comparable to one mere second of eternity.\n\nOh rarusium, you gave me the revelation, you gave me the start of the very sincere pain, yet you left me when I crave more. I see a path of infinity, but I can't find the doorway leading to it. I gave all my filthy skins to you! Alas, I beg your answers, rarusium! My head is pale and lifeless even now.

Xiang likes puppies no matter they woof or no woof. Xiang and Xiang's friends have no such dreams. Xiang thinks Xiang's dream is always stay in here, in this vacuole with fluffy grass and fluffy wood and fluffy clouds. Grownups things are too complex. Grownups semantical flow will make fluffy clouds complex too and Xiang can't undersand them.\n\nBut Xiang now knows many grownups have simple dreams. They want friends and they want to play games with friends, but non-matter make them can't find friends in vacuoles. Xiang is so upset. Xiang doesnt like non-matter too. Good brother says grownups are trying to ask non-matter leave. Xiang wants help them too! But grownups need to promise Xiang to make their dreams as simple as Xiang and Xiang's friends. They should find friends and play games with friends. Grownups always lying and Xiang wont help them if their dreams are not like this!\n\nBut, but ... Xiang will help if theres 50 grownups dream is finding friends! No,  Xiang will help if theres 40 grownups dream is finding friends! Wait ... How about ... 30 grownups ... 20 grownups ... 10!

I did not know it was the mailbox of the house of your neighbor. The owner of that house has become a Hollowed Courier and often works without going home, so I thought ... Now I realize that my behavior before was very abrupt and impolite. I am really sorry. And you did recognize me on that day; yes, I did take part in your research into rarusium and eigenvector, since on that day, I thought ... Perhaps it would be better for both you and me to stop asking what I was thinking of on that day.\n\nMy opinion of the Nodal Matrix from my standpoint has not changed much frankly. However, I have to admit that your words make a point. The great number of books and documents in the archive which I love reading are all made possible to exist by the interpersonal connection in the Old Age. There will not be great philosophy and great art if there is no communication, clash of thoughts, and entanglement of love and hate. It may be true like you have said, that civilization cannot be born without the incubation of conflicts; development begets problems, and problems will ultimately be solved by further development.\n\nBut nonetheless, I still would not like to go too far on this matter ... I do not think I should be a part of it. Maybe only in fierce conflicts can great achievements be made, but I do not think ... With conflicts, there will be wins and losses. What if great achievements are defeated before they even have the chance to see the world? What if the loss refers to me? I believe any reasonable person should know the meaning of pursuing fortune and avoiding disaster and make choices accordingly. I accept being called a coward or a selfish person, but I admit that I am not born to be the hero who saves the day. I just want to spend the rest of my life peacefully and safely. I support nothing, and I oppose nothing; what matters wo me is the little piece of paradise of mine, a little piece of ... where nothing could change no matter whether you had come to Vacuole TK-3N or not.\n\nI am really sorry to bother you for so long.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-3\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** OG-CL\n**Sender:** Xiang Yuetao, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][PJVXKEIP89QYFZBWOETP][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI'm tying ten thousand knots on a rope, each the size of a fist.

The vacuole is not broad at all, but walking one step inside makes one feel like they are covering a distance of a thousand miles, even a temporal distance of thousands of years if they get delusive enough. In hindsight, they only took a second when making this step. We are not able to fully explain the anomalous physical attributes of this vacuole, but we are convinced that it was because of such attributes that enabled comrade Wan Zhang to tattoo a fractal on the head by performing a \"supertask\".\n\nWhen residents of Vacuole OI-IO found Wan Zhang, he fainted on a chair in his studio with a smile on his face. Two robotic arms for tattooing were pointed at his gruesome head with flashing green lights showing their work was completed. The tattoo pattern on his head is confirmed to be infinitely precise, but it also contains a certain degree of cognitive hazard and long-time visual contact may cause mental disorders. We suggest everyone avoid looking at it, no matter how curious you are.\n\nComrade Wan Zhang is still in a coma, however, his vital signs have been stable and he is constantly broadcasting his valid eigenvector in an unconscious state. Node No. 11 functions normally as always.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** N5-1B\n**Sender:** Chen Ting, resident\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][DM2E5YR6C4931OAQ50T6][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWheat in my vacuole always has a low yield ...

According to the calculation result based on the interaction between rarusium and non-matters, if I turn my ship away from the standard temporal axis for ... 176.28 degrees, and fly toward the Earth, then my three-dimensional projection will form a spiral structure from your point of view with its tip pointing at Vacuole TM-A4. Such a structure shall help me attain the valid eigenvector. I will become one of your Nodes, and after approximately 30h of piloting, I will reach below the Earth's atmosphere and arrive home.\n\nBut with a deviation so drastic from the standard temporal axis, my AIC predicts that 2875 standard years would have passed when I finally return to Earth. Whoever welcomes me, if there still can be anyone to welcome, will sure be a creature I cannot imagine.\n\nIt also means that as long as I maintain a stable cruise for 30h toward you, then I shall be a Node valid for two thousand years. On the other hand, me as a Node will go offline for over a month even if the ship turns in a wrong direction for only ten seconds.\n\nFor this, I hope to say something to the Eastern Land Command of SCP Foundation: I, Igor Kamenev, pledge my loyalty to the SCP Foundation and unconditionally support the great project of building the Nodal Matrix. I have turned the calculation frequency of my AIC to its maximum, and it will receive and reply to all semantical flows while I am flying. I will focus on piloting the spaceship and go straight toward Vacuole TM-A4. Ha, merely thirty hours. Piece of cake.\n\nI've got a bottle of vodka in my ship's refrigerator.

The lights on the surface of his spaceship are stretched into thin lines, and in general, the Node looks like a vortex made of crystal. It would be impossible, but for some reason, all visitors claim that for a glimpse they can see a static image of Igor Kamenev sitting inside his ship.\n\nThough the trajectory could have minor changes, Node No. 13 has not come into any dysfunction thus far.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-no-gap\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-14\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-14\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** TK-3N\n**Sender:** Ke Zeyan, archivist\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][3FUY0SAL7T2XDB5OMLMG][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTo all residents of Vacuole TK-3N,\n\nUnder the permission of the SCP Foundation, I will become the successor of the broadcaster of this vacuole.

This is not determined evenly by a randomization algorithm; the number 20% I said earlier is by no means accurate either. In effect, my discards are done completely at the discretion of my personal liking, even down to my mood on a certain day. My range of authority extends to all semantical flows waiting to be received and sent. The SCP Foundation has administered the position of supreme dominance on all matters related to the broadcast of semantical flows. I will not accept any objection.

But ... I'm just curious, okay? What exactly is rarusium?\n\nWe all know that rarusium comes from non-matters, which explains why both us before the falling and the \"Alpha Centauri\" civilization didn't find it out in the first place. However. Why rarusium reacts with semantical flows in a specific way? Why rarusium can reveal our eigenvectors? Why everything? I know it's anomalous and a lot of stuff just does not yet have an explanation ... But I still think it's somehow anti-logic. It makes little to no sense.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** OI-IO\n**Sender:** Long Liangjun, Hollowed Courier\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThey said the Chief of Node No. 11 was still in a coma and they didn't guarantee he could hear what I would say when I reached the vacuole. And I told them, no, he was absolutely able to hear my voice. I told them not to look down on anyone of the Chiefs of Node, because they had become persons completely different from us.\n\nTherefore I read aloud the report on the current situation of the Node and how much he was not aligned with other parts of the Matrix. I swear, he made a faint smile upon hearing my words.\n\nIt turns out I was right. Just a couple minutes after leaving the room, I received a broadcast about the adjustments made to his public key.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** N0-FS\n**Sender:** Chiara Alberti, Lachrymose Chanter\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][QUPH3PTKPAWSRX0BXOJX][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI went to Node No. 12, looking for inspiration.\n\nA world of children is way different from the world of grown-ups. It's so pure and so simple, yet full of imagination and fantasies. How amazing are they to see countless imaginary beings in the sky! We the group of adults, on the other hand, have so few people that can ... right? Perhaps there is a little child inside every one of us, waiting for us to wake them up and recollect our dreams of childhood that are lost. We can make miracles if we do that!\n\nMaybe the child inside me is a singer too.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** HB-5N\n**Sender:** Ran Pengtao, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][L6DW75LF971AEG3AQVJ4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nMy son once said to me about rarusium. He said rarusium is shit that non-matters pooped out.\n\nI admit his metaphor is a little gross, but I'd argue that children's instincts are often good at reaching the essence of things. If we compare the act of non-matters applying litura diluviorum to semantical flows to the act of people swallowing food, then yes, maybe rarusium is equal to what food turns to in our stomach ... no, it is equal to what we vomit; rarusium is semantical flows that non-matters can't digest. Maybe this can explain why rarusium can tell us the properties of a semantical flow. Because such properties determine whether it can be digested by non-matters.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** DT-2N\n**Sender:** Xin Dong, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][L6DW75LF971AEG3AQVJ4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI am pretty familiar with the fourteen stories of the Nodes, and yet there is still a bit of confusion that condenses in my mind. Why do humans have bipartite eigenvectors, and why can we alter that one part?\n\nRarusium brings us revelation, I know pretty well of it. However, in my humble opinion, a lot of the so-called revelations are too esoteric from my perspective. If we examine every one of the Chiefs' methods of becoming Nodes ... To be real, does anybody think those lines of revelation feel like \"rituals\" that are unjustifiable to you? What made the fourteen Chiefs unanimously agree that what rarusium had told them were the right way to attain valid eigenvectors?\n\nNot to say they all succeeded. It is like, what, a miracle that occurred fourteen times in a row!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-2\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** TK-3N\n**Sender:** Huang Yuxuan, Fretting Goldsmith\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][PPZQOF4645QFTVMG2EA4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nI know what I should do for Chief of Node No. 14. I'm gonna make him a set of dice with rarusium; a D4, a D6, a D8, a D12, and the biggest D20! Read about the idea from a very old gaming book. I think they're more than appropriate:\n\nWhat could be better than dice at symbolizing randomness!\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-1\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** F6-JN\n**Sender:** Nguyễn Thị Ngọc Liếng, Senior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][L6DW75LF971AEG3AQVJ4][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Nodal Matrix is a stone's throw away ... Having worked for the SCP Foundation for so long, I'd like to say that it's meaningless to work on questions anymore. Just feel it. It's unlikely for anomalies to give us opportunities to answer \"why\", and we should not answer \"why\" either. We only care about answering how to protect human civilization in a fickle and changeful world.\n\nWho knows? Maybe all of these, the non-matters, the rarusium, and the eigenvectors — All of them can exist just because the universe thinks putting these elements on us can make an interesting story.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** F6-JN\n**Sender:** Qian Kangping, Junior Researcher\n**Eigenvector:** [[span class=\"scp-eigenvector\"]][6SCXJJNTMH6N4HKQ72PH][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nOn the fourteen Nodes ... I actually want to think about them on the basis of \"ritual\". It is likely that they are effective because the fourteen Chiefs believe they are effective.\n\nBut to \"believe\", or to \"have faith\" in something, are words that carry a lot of weight. Obviously just by \"thinking it's right\" is not enough for you to become a Node. You have to have faith in something or somebody and fully put your heart and efforts into working for it. You have to stick to your //Dao//. The rarusium points out a path for us, but we can see it only if we have complete faith in ourselves.\n\nAnd once we reach the starting point of that path, the non-matters can comprehend us not anymore. Non-matters abominate semantical flows; they devour, they attack, but they can never understand what makes us unique and to what extraordinary extent can hopes and faiths make us. Therefore, when enough people find their path and shine, the non-matters' blockage shall be merely a spook to us.\n\nPerhaps one could say that human beings are born with the capacity to create miracles. We just need to believe we can.\n\nBut of course, this is just my own version of the story. In the future when more new Nodes show up — I know there are already a couple of candidates — maybe they can tell us more about it.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"scp-h-stack\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-v-stack scp-small\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-bar scp-character-x-4\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-details\"]]\n**Vacuole Designation:** 5N-1N\n**Sender:** Geng Jia, Hollowed Courier\n**Eigenvector:** N/A\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nNodes No. 1 to 5 have been aligned.

All Nodes have been aligned and connected to each other, forming the Nodal Matrix we are yearning for so long. Right here, right now, I believe my research team can finally announce our new project:\n\n**Node No. 15** - Codenamed BROADCAST, located in Vacuole QM-LM, with myself, Basang Drolma, as the Chief of Node.\n\nThe fifteenth Node for broadcasting is not a regular Node. We will utilize the rarusium signal tower at the peak of Mount Qomolangma to continuously broadcast the public keys of all fourteen Nodes to every location within the Eastern Land. As such, all residents of the Eastern Land shall be able to receive the public key nearest to the current vacuole at any time and overlap the public key upon the semantical flows of themselves with the help of rarusium-made resonators for public key. All residents will not be obstructed by non-matters anymore from this day on. All residents can walk freely between vacuoles from this day on.\n\nWe made it, comrades. We appreciate the efforts and sacrifices all fourteen Chiefs of Node have made. ETERNAL GLORY TO ALL NODES.\n\nOf course, this does not mark the end of our work. We need to prepare for the unexpected, for one day the Chiefs of Node need to have their rest. We will continue to search for new Nodes to strengthen the robustness of the Nodal Matrix. We will send all of our research materials to the Western Realm Command, which as far as we know is still under the torment of non-matters. We need to lead them to freedom, to victory.\n\nAcross the non-matters, comrades, we can reach every corner in the world.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"scp-block scp-reply\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-reply-info\"]]\n[[div class=\"scp-character-info-head scp-character-foundation\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThree years after the completion of the Nodal Matrix, humans stepped onto Vacuole IN-SC once again. This time, the AIC that had been operating for almost twenty standard years has finally done its simulation. It calculated and worked out the possibility of human civilization achieving mutual connection through attaining valid eigenvectors. Naturally, we asked it how was the result.\n\nThe AIC answered: its simulation gave a result of 99.8724%. Within the range of error, one can consider it a certain event.\n\nNaturally, we asked, why? Why results from the two calculations were so drastically different? Why the result was near zero, almost fitting the definition of miracle, if one considers a human being's success as an individual event? And why the result from the simulation showed that the success was near one, almost fitting the definition of destiny?\n\nThe AIC answered: because this is never an individual event. Even in the most pessimistic simulation where we are divided by harsher non-matters, as long as a tiny, infinitesimal connection can be made, then the single spark will ultimately start a prairie fire. As long as mankind has not given up their hope entirely, then the tiny bit of connection will ultimately link every one of us together.\n\nAt last, it was the AIC's turn for raising questions. How is the current situation? Can humans make connections after all?\n\nAnd we answered it.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]",
