Invariably, the old man gave them instructions on the order of \"Let me do the talking,\" \"Just sit there and look serious,\" \"Don't say a word unless they address you personally,\" or \"Stick to the script, and //do not improvise.//\" These instructions were greeted with relief and ready acceptance in every case, and McInnis had no intention of being the exception to the rule when his time came.\n\nExcept that when it did, there was no briefing. The Red Right Hand chopper arrived unannounced, and Scout ushered him in, and within minutes of takeoff the Director had his fedora down over his eyes and was fast asleep.\n\nMcInnis had never been more flattered by anything in all his life.\n\nIt wasn't a proper Council meeting, but the security measures were still in place. The Council Chamber was pitch black save for a single white light, desk mounted, which only served to make it clear that there was a masculine silhouette at the table they were facing.\n\n\"Vivian,\" O5-8 said in a casual tone. McInnis had expected a voice changer, or perhaps a booming amplifier. \"And Dr. McInnis. This is your first time at Site-01. Welcome.\"\n\nMcInnis nodded with a depth suggestive of bowing. \"Sir. Thank you.\"\n\nThe silhouette gestured. \"Have a stand.\"\n\nScout chuckled.\n\n\"So, the petition.\" The Overseer appeared to bow his head; McInnis wondered how he could possibly be reading anything in a manner that cast no light on his features. \"I'm a little confused. Don't you already have no D-class? Sorry, that's not the right way to say that, is it. Double negative.\" He looked back up. \"Doesn't Site-43 already prohibit the use of D-class personnel?\"\n\nScout nodded. McInnis could sense the movement, though he couldn't see his mentor in the dark. \"Of course. This proposal isn't about 43. It's about the entire Foundation.\"\n\nA grunt, and the man's head bowed down again. There was a sound of rustling paper. McInnis was amazed to think that the Overseers printed things out before reading them. Then again, it did diminish the threat of electronic cognitohazards. \"Table of logistical concerns is pretty thin.\"\n\n\"I believe the moral imperatives more than make up for that deficiency,\" Scout replied.\n\nA snort. \"You know better than to come to me with morality alone, Vivian. Why are you proposing we hamstring the Department of Containment in this manner? I see you haven't consulted with HARMA at all.\"\n\nScout sighed. \"HARMA and the D-class program are atrocities, sir. War crimes looking for a war. We've suggested dozens of initiatives that could replace--\"\n\n\"Bah.\" The Overseer looked up once more, and from the sound of it, closed the report. \"A solution looking for a problem. D-class are efficient. The system works. It's proven and tested, and it's helping us prove and test everything else. Give me one good reason, and I do mean //good,// and I do mean //one,// why we should do absolutely anything to change this //status quo?//\"\n\n\"Because the //status quo,// sir, if I may,\" McInnis found himself saying, \"is seriously injurious to the sustainability of our academic efforts.\" He could feel Scout's eyes on him now. \"Only the most psychopathic of scientists will have their enthusiasm undampened by implication with forced labour and illicit human experimentation, and such scientists are rarely in the top percentile of intelligence, creativity or dedication. We are limiting our own capacity to do right by doing this wrong.\"\n\nThere was silence in the chamber for what felt like an age. O5-8 broke it, because the other two knew this was his prerogative. \"Are you suggesting, Dr. McInnis, that this single, entirely justifiable act of ethical greyscaling might be enough to turn our best people against the cause of protecting mankind? That they would sacrifice the good of their fellow human beings writ large, on behalf of the worst of us, in limited quantity?\"\n\nMcInnis allowed a moment for Scout to intervene. It didn't happen, so he answered for himself. \"I am not suggesting that this will lead to open revolt, no, sir. We all know the importance of the Veil. But that it materially injures our souls is a foregone conclusion, and it has been my experience that soulless experimentation can only very rarely be bent towards the good.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" McInnis wished he could see the other man's face. Communication wasn't only about words and tone of voice. \"Hmm hmm hmm. Well. I'll pass this along to the others. They'll vote it down later this evening. I'll let you know when that's happened, Vivian.\"\n\n\"Sir,\" the old man acknowledged. There was no sadness or anger in his voice, only the weariness of having an unpleasant forethought confirmed. He placed a hand on McInnis' shoulder, and turned them both towards where the door was hidden in shadow.\n\n\"One more thing, Vivian,\" the Overseer said to their backs.\n\nMcInnis moved to turn, but Scout's firm grip told him not to. The impudence sent a thrill down his spine as the Director responded: \"Sir?\"\n\n\"You were absolutely right about him.\"\n\n\"Yes, sir.\"\n\n\"I look forward to seeing you again, Dr. McInnis,\" O5-8 said.\n\n//We didn't see each other at all,// he thought as the door opened, and the Red Right Hand reached in to reclaim them.\n\n[!-- [[=image McInnis_Scout_O5-8.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n+ ##990099|1992##\n++ 29 October\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]**[http://www.scpwiki.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-43 Site-43]: Lambton County, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nHe couldn't tell if they were growing closer, or if the old man was simply getting more lenient in his old age. But this was the second time in one week that Scout had invited McInnis to the Director's Complex for dinner, and the second time they'd rounded out the night with a spirited philosophical debate.\n\nBy their standards.\n\n\"Might it not be more efficient to simply recruit the like-minded?\" McInnis swished his glass of red wine.\n\n\"If by 'efficient' you mean 'easy', sure.\" The old man was still picking at the remnants of the pork chop on his plate. \"Find people who already agree with you, and make them work with you. But what's the flaw in that logic?\"\n\n[[=image DL_51_01_Scout_Dinner.jpg]]\n\nMcInnis took a freshly-oxygenated sip, and shook his head as he dabbed at his lips with one of Scout's black handkerchiefs. \"I don't know that I can see any such flaw.\"\n\n\"You could if you'd let yourself look.\" The old man sat back, and McInnis saw that his belly was bulging as the rest of him receding. \"Don't be so sure of yourself. Don't come at every discussion like it's an argument, and don't argue like the only possible positive outcome is //winning.// Maybe you're wrong. You //are// wrong, in this case. Why are you wrong?\"\n\nIt sometimes seemed like everything the Director did was to force him to consider a new perspective. Confident that there was a good reason for the exercise, he always obliged. \"You believe that converting others to our way of thinking is better than preaching to the choir. You believe we should be nurturing our sensibilities where no such seed has yet been planted.\"\n\n\"I do,\" Scout nodded. \"It's good to know you've been paying attention, even if sometimes you're not willing to interrogate what you're seeing.\"\n\nHe didn't take it personally. Anything that could make him stronger couldn't harm him. \"I am trying. Perhaps a hint?\"\n\n\"I'm getting too old for hints.\" Scout covered his mouth; if he burped, he did so very discreetly. \"I'll just say it outright. A thing which is //learned// is far more dear than a thing which is //believed.// You can't teach a person who believes something to //know// it. They're two different things.\"\n\n\"Overwatch would appear to disagree.\"\n\nScout pointed at him in affirmation. \"More than they're letting on. They don't want us teaching people a better way. They want to make the entire world see things the way they do.\"\n\n\"They do have an elevated perspective,\" McInnis reminded him. Advocacy for the devil was his role at this table, he'd swiftly learned. Scout always harkened to his better angels.\n\n\"I'll thank you not to craft any more positive euphemisms for standing atop an ivory tower.\" Scout cleaned his hands, and draped his handkerchief over the bone on his plate like a shroud of funereal modesty. \"That sort of thing is beneath such a gifted communicator as yourself. The Council wants you to think we should only hire acclaimed experts because it's a better use of our resources. Let the world beyond the Veil create our people for us. But they're wrong. The kinds of people we need, the world doesn't generate those in quantity. The world teaches people to hate, to mistrust, to judge. Prejudice is the death of science. It's the death of humanism. It will be the death of humanity.\"\n\n\"There is no mind free of prejudice,\" McInnis smiled.\n\n\"No,\" Scout allowed, \"but it only truly takes root and grows in the right conditions. Catch people before they become so much loamy soil. While they're still people. While they can still change their minds, and not see it as a weakness, or something to be feared.\" He was speaking with his hands now, something he never did. He was obviously excited, and it wasn't just the wine.\n\nThough it was very, very good wine.\n\n\"I understand the philosophical point, but I wonder if, given the gravity of our responsibilities, we ought to be populating our force of world-saving geniuses exclusively with graduate students and young quarterbacks.\"\n\nScout chuckled with a warmth that probably did have something to do with the wine. \"Not exclusively, but substantially. Don't misjudge the wisdom that comes with youth. A sharp intellect is a sharp intellect, no matter the vintage of its frame.\"\n\n\"I might counter that ignorance often masquerades as open-mindedness.\"\n\n\"I would rather have the ignorant,\" the old man said, \"a thousand times over I would rather have the ignorant than the learned intolerant, and if you'll allow me today, Allan, I will tell you why.\"\n\nIt was a long, though not unproductive, evening.\n\n[!-- [[=image Scout_McInnis_Hire.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n+ ##990099|1996##\n++ 1 April\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nThis time, the entire Council had been in chambers.\n\nThe Directorship of Site-43 was, for reasons McInnis had not fully understood until now, one of the most important posts at the SCP Foundation. All thirteen Overseers had impressed upon him the vitality of the work he would be doing, and shared a mind-boggling array of secrets, often in a bored monotone. (O5-2, the Archivist, at least had a reason for that.) But the meeting eventually ended, and when it did, all but two of the nameplates blinked out.\n\nThe lights remained off. Scout had been so trusted, after his eighty years of service, that he could sit and chat with Eight without any of the chamber's security features active. Twenty-odd years was insufficient to earn that privilege, apparently.\n\nEight was one of the two who lingered. The other was Thirteen, who spoke first. \"A lot to wrap your head around, isn't it?\"\n\nMcInnis didn't nod. Perhaps they could have seen it somehow if he had, but as always he strove for the clearest possible communication within the bounds of his circumstances. \"Yes, sir.''\n\n\"He'll manage.\" Eight was the Foundation's special projects supervisor, and had been Scout's Overseer sponsor for a good long chunk of his career. He was used to dealing with technology rather than people, and his manner was often brusque. \"Let's get to the final item, shall we?\"\n\nThirteen's silhouette nodded. \"Allan,\" the Mediator said. \"We were unable to convince your predecessor to meet us halfway on a few key issues. I'm afraid we're going to have to be quite insistent with you.\"\n\nMcInnis tried not to stiffen. \"Sirs.\"\n\nEight took over, as though this routine had been rehearsed. Probably it had. \"Vivian ran 43 like a freshman college class. I could count on one hand the number of times he hired someone over the age of thirty. Your demographics skew younger than anywhere else in the Foundation. That ends today.\"\n\n\"Well,\" Thirteen chided, \"not //today.// But a gradual trend is beginning, to be sure. Director McInnis, we feel very strongly that your facility requires more age and experience than it presently boasts. Do you understand what I'm saying?\"\n\nHe found he'd been grinding his teeth. He doubted they could hear it... but then, he had the vague sense that the cylindrical bulk of the Archivist was still in the room, and perhaps it could. Perhaps his protest was already on record. Nevertheless... \"I believe I do, sir. You're saying you expect me to shift our hiring trends away from recent graduates, and toward proven experts. Is that right?\"\n\n\"That's right,\" Thirteen nodded.\n\n\"I see.\" He considered. \"And you've expressed, unless I mistook your tone, a disinterest in debating this point. Yes?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Eight. Very firmly.\n\nMcInnis shrugged. \"Very well, sirs. Your preference will become official policy.\"\n\nThirteen sat back, apparently satisfied, but Eight sat forward. \"You wouldn't be planning to pay lip service here, and continue Vivian's course behind our backs, would you?\"\n\nThis time he allowed himself a little body language. He raised his eyebrows slightly. \"You've invested a great deal of trust in me, sir. I shouldn't suppose your judgement in that matter was faulty.\"\n\nIt was something of a surprise when they let it go at that, considering how tactically he'd avoided actually answering the question.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n+ ##990011|2016##\n++ 20 May\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nMcInnis was on the way out of his office when he stopped, for no particular reason, and looked down at his assistant.\n\nZulfikar was greying around the temples, but he hadn't slowed down a bit. He met McInnis' eyes, and asked: \"Sir?\"\n\nMcInnis pulled a waiting chair up from the wall, and sat down. \"You remember the expansion plans?\"\n\nZulfikar nodded. Veil maintenance in the communities surrounding Lambton County was becoming more difficult to manage from Site-43. There was talk of opening satellite facilities in the coming years.\n\n\"Have you considered entering the administration track?\"\n\nHis assistant blinked. \"I... No, sir, not really?\"\n\nMcInnis nodded. \"And why is that?\"\n\nHe hadn't seen Zulfikar so flustered since the first deadline. \"I just... There's always so much to do here. So much work.\" He smiled almost bashfully. \"The Good Work. Sir.\"\n\n[[=image DL_51_02_Zulfikar_Smile.jpg]]\n\n\"Of course. But have you not considered that said Work cannot be progressed from Site-43 alone?\"\n\nZulfikar was trying to keep an upbeat mood, but the conversation was clearly distressing him. \"Are you asking me to transfer? Are you unhappy with my...?\"\n\nMcInnis laughed. He didn't laugh often. It was an unsubtle tool, and difficult to tune. He hit what sounded to his ear like the right balance: warm, sympathetic, not mocking, but incredulous. \"You? Your work has never been anything less than extraordinary. But you've been here almost twenty years, Zulfikar, and you're the Director's Assistant. You could be an Assistant Director. Even a Director, possibly.\"\n\nIt was difficult to tell on the other man's tanned and bearded face, but it seemed like he might be blushing. \"Thanks, sir. I appreciate it. Really, I do. But I feel like this is where I'm meant to be. I...\" He looked away, embarrassed. \"I just really believe in what we're doing here. I have for a very long time. And that means the world to me.\"\n\n//I don't have to ask,// McInnis thought. //I could simply not ask.//\n\n\"Around when,\" he asked, \"did you first acquire this faith? If you recall.\"\n\nHis assistant considered. \"Funny thing,\" he said after a moment. \"Earliest I remember is right after the Breach, in 2002. You gave that incredible speech about duty and sacrifice.\" He smiled shyly. \"I guess there's something to that whole thing about people coming together in a crisis, huh?\"\n\n[!-- [[=image McInnis_Zulfikar.jpg]] --]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 23 May\n[[span style=\"font-family: BauhausLTDemi; font-size: 120%;\"]]##990011|**Falconer University##: Toronto, Ontario, Canada**[[/span]]\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nHarry couldn't help it.

It made an audible //thud.// \"You wrote all of this... yesterday?\"\n\nReggie nodded. \"Ayup.\"\n\n\"How on Earth?\"\n\nShe shrugged. \"When I go, I go.\"\n\n\"You certainly do.\" He turned over the first page of the first chapter, and his eyes automatically travelled to the footnotes. As he'd feared, they were immaculate. \"I have trouble getting a few thousand words done a day. This is... is this the entire first section?\"\n\nShe was beaming. \"Ayupyup.\"\n\n\"And to what do you credit this outrageous success?\"\n\nShe took on the affect of a robot. \"The extensive and incisive commentary of my supervisor on the earlier drafts, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" He continued paging through, expecting to find that most of the middle pages were blank, and this was an elaborate gag. They were not. It was not. \"Jeez. //Wow.//\"\n\n\"Kinda serious though.\" She glanced to the side. \"Those comments were //really// helpful.\"\n\nAltan reached into his school bag, smirking. \"Have to agree.\"\n\nHarry watched in dismay as a second gigantic pile of paper was slapped onto his desk. \"Not you, too.\"\n\nHeng produced a smaller stack, which was probably at least a full chapter. \"I didn't consider the material culture angle at all until you mentioned it today,\" he said sheepishly. \"That's a whole other thing now.

She winked at her jacked colleague. \"He got out the physical copy of your dissertation. Who does that? The case is locked.\"\n\nHeng shrugged. \"Knowledge should be free.\"\n\n\"If that's enough idle chatter,\" Harry said, staring at the mass of unfinished chapters and dreading the amount of reading and writing he was going to have to do over the next few days, \"we've got some actual work to get on with. Don't we?\"\n\nReggie shook her head. \"I don't know if it's more important than solving the Case of the Disappearing Committee.\"\n\n\"Literally 'The Disappearing Committee', Reggie,\" Harry warned her. \"As in, the committee that will //disappear// you if you look too closely.

Wettle wondered what had gotten into him.\n\nThey were discussing the capabilities of each Victim during each Deadline, specifically how they mapped to pre-existing talents in an exaggerated way. Harry said something about Mukami's exceptional powers of persuasion, and McInnis, apparently lost in thought, had responded with something vague about the depth of responsibility that kind of thing engendered. Lillihammer had been about to pave over the pothole with a new tangent, when Wettle shook himself out of half-sleep and grunted: \"What?\"\n\nHe grunted it loud enough that Lillihammer couldn't talk over him, and so McInnis heard. Because he had heard, he had to respond, because he was McInnis. He responded: \"Nothing. Well... ah.

Your work is worth a great deal to the Foundation, Dr. Mataxas, but you will need to find a way to perform these tests elsewhere.

The overhead fan was whirring double time to remove the carcinogens from the air -- he was using lead flux, because he was repairing the control circuitry for an alchemical detoxifier, and had convinced himself that these insufficient safety measures were probably good enough, it'd be fine, and how many brain cells did he need at his age //really// -- and she barely heard him over the white noise. It had been another thing recommending this workspace to her tonight.\n\nShe glanced over her shoulder, sighed, then stood up and turned her chair to face him. \"Remember //Moonlight Maria?//\"\n\nHe nodded glumly, and put his soldering iron down. //Moonlight Maria// had been an Acroamatic Abatement Group project at Area-21 involving a B-52 Stratofortress and some manner of complex toxicological system. It had blown up in 2002, a few months before the Breach, killing everyone on the project except technician-on-temporary-loan Philip Deering.\n\n\"Well, I know what it was for now.\"\n\nNascimbeni grimaced. \"I already know everything I want to know about that.

Elsewhere at the Foundation, it was common for kidnapped cons and death row inmates to be pressed into service as scientific guinea pigs, with the tenuous rationale that this inhumane treatment was still, statistically, better than death or life in prison. Supposedly, those who survived long enough or whose worth was worn through were amnesticized, given new identities, and returned to society rehabilitated, after a fashion. Most people chose not to examine that premise too closely.\n\nBut by standing order of Vivian Scout, which McInnis had annually argued back into force with the O5 Council, Site-43 hosted no permanent D-class population. It was argued, quite effectively, that having flunkies on which to test every odd thing made researchers act with complacency, if not outright cruelty. It was better to find a more creative way to figure things out. Site-43 had been founded on that principle.\n\nSometimes, however, exceptions had to be made. The obscenely-acronymed Human and Animal Resources Management Authority (HARMA) would be contacted, and they would ship over a single member of D-class personnel where no other logical means of experimenting on an object could be found. McInnis only ever allowed it, to Trevor Bremmel's frequent dissatisfaction, when there was no immediately apparent and obvious danger to the tests. The prisoners could not be fed into an active paper shredder. If they, for example, picked up a small statuette and it shredded them like paper, well, that was something else entirely.\n\nDu still didn't like it.

The one-way screen on the glass had been lowered. He waved back, and picked up the microphone. \"You've been administered the mnestics and fortificants, D...\" He glanced down at the sheet for her number, saw her name first, and decided he really did not feel like playing ball today. Saying a four-digit number to a humanoid SCP was already stupid. Five digits for a D-class was beyond the pale. \"Miss Hartman?\"\n\nHartman blinked rapidly, obviously surprised to hear her real name spoken aloud.

She'd helped Quantum Supermechanics to figure out precisely how the strange little statuette worked; even though the process was now extremely clear, the parameters known in full, nobody else had yet utilized the device -- which they were colloquially calling 'the Lever', for its ability to move any object -- except her. Today was her final physical with Dr. Forsythe, and at the end of that, if she still showed no signs of ill effect from repeatedly translocating matter with her mind, she would be discharged back to HARMA with a glowing recommendation for release to the MTF training program.\n\nDu watched her leave the chamber with a sense of awkward satisfaction. Satisfaction because, as relationships between warden and prisoner went, it had been a productive and respectful one. Awkward because he hadn't signed up to be a warden, and she was a prisoner of no recognized governmental authority. It still felt wrong, no matter how right he'd tried to do by her.\n\nBut he couldn't focus on that anymore. His focus was, in fact, in need of crystal clarity.\n\nSCP-5416 was, as the note had suggested, an extraordinarily dangerous object. If you picked it up, the first thing you thought about became the object to be moved, and the next thing you thought about became its destination. Hartman had been thinking about the statue when she picked it up, so it was immediately teleported to the table. They put it in a box from that point onward, so it wouldn't be on her mind until she picked it up again. In the second test she focused on the table, and moved it across the room. In the fifth test she transported a dime from the table into her pocket. The fourteenth test had solved a longstanding mystery in the field of confectionery. After eighteen tests, they knew enough to write up a comprehensive manual for the object's use.\n\nThey were coming up on Test 28.\n\nAnd they still had zero clue where it had come from.\n\nThat bothered Du more than Hartman's fate.\n\nA fact which bothered him most of all.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 30 August\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nImrich did most of the talking.\n\nHe let Wettle present the boring parts, the repetitious tests that had confirmed or falsified each result, and made sure he was the one to present the actual findings.

Probably not right away; Director types liked to mull things like this over before deciding who else needed to know.\n\nWhen it became apparent that an answer was expected anyway, Imrich said \"No, sir.

That meant her mind could be easily molded by the mental fortificants, particularly the mnestics and focus drugs, required for any use of SCP-5416, which meant that when she performed her little trick, it would be with the utmost precision.

What is known is that individuals encountering //The Weight// will subsequently regard their memories of doing so as false, then suffer from anxious dreams regarding the vessel or tangential topics for what may well be the remainder of their lives. \n\nIn late August of 2016, it was decided that this risk to the Veil of Normalcy could no longer be borne. The Department of Containment ordered the use of SCP-5416, \"The Lever,\" to teleport it from the lagoon into a truly vast concrete cube poured into a framework erected in a cave bubble just off the west end of the first sublevel Security and Containment block. Once the poured concrete hardened, water was poured in next via the Lake Huron floodgates and internal water management systems, until a reasonable approximation of the ship's no-longer-to-be-final resting place had been achieved.\n\nAll that remained was to perform the simple act of translocation.\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Are you ready, Dr. Bell?\"\n\nThe young woman smiled nervously, but responded right away. \"Sir, I think so.

Under interrogation by Dr. Du, this individual claimed to have overriden the security lock placed on that object following Incident Report SC-I-3512 (ongoing), in order to perform activities relating to a classified Overwatch Command-sanctioned operation. Under extreme pressure from Dr. Du, Agent Pandev explained that he had attempted to utilize SCP-5416 to remove a distant asteroid expected to impact the Earth in approximately one year. Familiarized with the target, and already familiar with the Earth's sun in his capacity as a Foundation-employed astrophysicist, Agent Pandev attempted to remove the asteroid from its current course and place it within the heliosphere. Due to what he is now calling \"serious deficiencies in the object's documentation by Site-43 personnel,\" its properties were not properly understood, and the object itself was sent into the sun in place of the asteroid. Recovery seems unlikely at this time.\n\nAgent Pandev was detained for one day at Site-43 under the authority of Chief of Security and Containment Roger Pensak, who along with Dr. Xinyi Du of Quantum Supermechanics, has been named in a complaint to Overwatch by that agent.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nDu escaped serious consequences via a combination of seniority, very good explanations, and -- as his staff would have it in years to come -- an untouchable frothing fury that made even the Overwatch auditors hesitant to come down on him too hard.\n\nPensak got a black mark on his record, having failed to so much as notice the interloper, official business or not.\n\nThe auditors somehow never got around to removing the note on his file after Agent Pandev disappeared without a trace a day later, having apparently never been attested in any Foundation database.

He was napping in the next room.\n\n\"Just a little bit more that matters,\" said Ibanez, and she pressed the play button again.\n\nHer voice was the first to break the silence. \"But if this alternate-you killed you-you — we need better terminology for this —\" Harry smirked, and so did Lillian, \"then 5243 didn't kill you-you. So why is it bringing you back every year?\"\n\nAn exchange of glances in the room. The question on everyone's mind for over a decade, Udo and Ibanez most of all.\n\n\"Maybe it isn't,\" said Du. \"Maybe Dr. Deering isn't entangled with 5243, but with whatever is going on in the alternate timeline.\"\n\nIbanez turned off the recorder.\n\n\"This is way outside my experience,\" said Nascimbeni. \"But did I just hear him suggest that there's... another Breach, in another timeline, that's... interacting with ours?\"\n\n\"That's what I got,\" said Harry.\n\n\"That's what he said,\" Lillian sighed. \"I thought he was pretty plain with it.\"\n\nThey settled into a contemplative hush to match the one on the tape.\n\nThis time, nobody broke it.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nUdo stepped out to get some food from the cafeteria, and to her surprise, Harry offered to come with. There was obviously something on his mind, and he waited until they were on their way back with a pair of trays heaped full of hot food to spring it on her.\n\n\"Tell me to fuck off if this is inappropriate,\" he said, \"but...\"\n\nShe waited.\n\nShe got tired of waiting. \"Fuck off,\" she said. \"It is inappropriate to leave me in suspense.\"\n\nHe held a hand over the food, to shield it from his exhalations, and laughed nervously. His OCD was obviously getting worse. And given what they had to deal with every year, why not? \"Okay. I just... I thought someone ought to ask you, because you might...\" He shook his head. \"Did you talk to him, after? Dougall? Did you talk to him?\"\n\n[[=image DL_51_14_Okorie_Prevaricate.jpg]]\n\nShe smiled. If she'd had a free hand, she might have patted him on the back. A friendly gesture only, but still plenty friendly. \"Del says he asks for me every year. Says he begs, and he pleads.\"\n\n\"And? Did you listen to what he had to say?\"\n\n\"No.\" She chewed the words out through her lower lip. \"I didn't go in at all. If it was so goddamn important, he should have said it before he died the first time.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/50-turning-and-turning | previous-title=Turning and Turning\n| next-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/52-true-art-is-cognitohazardous | next-title=True Art is Cognitohazardous\n| hub-url=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/deadlined-hub  | hub-title=The Breach Goes On: Deadlined\n]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\nIllustrations in this series use reference material created with DAZ studio.
