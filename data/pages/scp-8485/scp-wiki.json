Construction efforts should coincide with periods of increased vocal activity by SCP-8485 whenever possible. \n\nShould SCP-8485's noise levels surpass the pre-recorded standard, personnel are to be temporarily evacuated as to not disrupt active workflow. Medical leave is to be granted if personnel report lasting bouts of tinnitus as to avoid permanent damage to hearing. \n\n**Description:** SCP-8485 is a collective of 293 small globular organisms, comprised entirely of  fatty flesh. At the time of discovery, 23% of the SCP-8485 population exhibited some form of injury, ranging from minor scratches to its skin to partial disfigurement. \n\nSCP-8485 is hyperaware at all times, remaining vigilant during movement and observing its immediate surroundings without interruption. SCP-8485 shows aversion to all physical contact. Throughout its containment, SCP-8485 has not yet gone dormant. SCP-8485 continuously vocalizes upwards of 125 decibels to garner human attention. [[footnote]] Sounds have ranged from baby crying, cooing and in one recorded instance belligerent screaming.

[[footnote]] Background is a recorded temporary blockage of the duct. Minor damage to the metal has been observed. [[/footnote]] || ##red|Denied## [[footnote]] The issue was able to be fixed remotely through an installed piston to clear anything trapped in the duct. Heavy thump confirmed clearance. [[/footnote]]||\n|| Physical check-up on SCP-8485, as last check-up occured over 12 years ago. Temporary spike in volume recorded. || ##red|Denied## [[footnote]] SCP-8485's vocalizations have started to consistently decrease in volume. The spike in volume is attributed to SCP-8485 attempting screaming to garner attention. Behavior is not to be encouraged. [[/footnote]]||\n|| Physical check-up on SCP-8485 due to vocalizations having subsided. || ##red|Denied##||\n|| Physical check-up on SCP-8485 due to unusually sweet scent emitting from its containment chamber. || ##red|Denied##||\n|| Physical check-up on SCP-8485 as damage to the containment unit has been observed. || ##green|Approved##||\n\n**Addendum SCP-8485-B:** Physical Check-Up\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nFollowing unusual activity and a complete malfunction of the automatic feeder system, a physical check-up was conducted. Remnants of SCP-8485 were spread throughout the chamber, with the containment chamber's walls having been stained a rich purple color. Scratch marks identical to prior observed damage to the feeding system were discovered on the inside of the chamber. A rotten smell perforated throughout the containment unit. Neutralization was presumed; however faint whimpering continued to originate from leftover offal congruent with SCP-8485's anatomy.  \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8484]]] | SCP-8485 | [[[SCP-8486]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Not Noodles]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
