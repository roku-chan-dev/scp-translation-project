Written on back: {{01/19/2005 FOUND HIDING IN CLOSET}}]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-3117\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** A Foundation-operated bot (I/O-SPIRAL) is to monitor online communities for discussions regarding SCP-3117. MTF Phi-11 (\"Promise-Keepers\") is to investigate these discussions and make a determination for appropriate action on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAny materials confirmed to contain components of SCP-3117 are to be isolated if possible, and — if not — referred to the Foundation's Disinformation Bureau for immediate action. Subjects who have experienced SCP-3117 are to be isolated for study.\n\n[[[task-forces#iota-10|MTF Iota-10 (\"Damn Feds\")]]] are to continue the ongoing investigation regarding the location featured in Addendum 3117.1.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3117 is a recurring dream triggered via exposure to certain components. These components take the form of specific ideas, concepts, phrases, and images. While exposure to all components are required to trigger occurrences of SCP-3117, these components can be spread across multiple forms of media (including film, audio, print, and still images). Consequently, no one source is known to contain all components responsible for triggering SCP-3117.\n\nAlthough subjects' experiences with SCP-3117 vary, the following symptoms have been noted among those who have or will experience SCP-3117:\n* An aversion to discussing or describing SCP-3117. \n* Suspicion that they are receiving warnings regarding SCP-3117.\n* A growing sense of urgency, inevitability, and/or dread. \n* The belief that they are being watched. \n\nIn approximately 1 out of 7 cases, subjects who experience SCP-3117 will go missing shortly after the dream's first occurrence. Investigations into this phenomenon are ongoing.\n\n**Addendum 3117.1:** Discovery\n\nIn 2006, a member of the [[[goc-hub-page|Global Occult Coalition]]]'s PSYCHE Division contacted Site-95 with the goal of transferring responsibility for containment of \"UTE-2639-Pygmalion Blit\" over to Foundation care. After several months of negotiation, 378 items (including several hundred documents, digital files, photographs, and one Betamax tape) were taken into Foundation custody. After an extensive clearance process by the on-duty HMCL supervisor, these items have been catalogued as part of SCP-3117's documentation.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"► ACCESS SCP:/3117/goc/035.log\" hide=\"▼ Close File\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#ffffff; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n= **{{INTERVIEW TRANSCRIPT}}**\n[[>]]\n**{{15 March 2001}}**\n[[/>]]\n[[=image goc_color.jpg size=\"square\"]]\n----\n**{{__SUBJECT:__ }}**\n**{{UTE-2639-Pygmalion Blit}}**\n\n**{{__ASSESSMENT TEAM:__}}**\n**{{761 (\"PERIWINKLE\")}}**\n\n__**{{IN ATTENDANCE}}**__\n**{{52841285/761 (\"LADYBUG\")}}**\n**{{52883762/761 (\"VOODOO\")}}**\n**{{SUBJECT 2639-712 (\"GAMMA\")}}**\n----\n**{{LADYBUG: Tell us about the dream.}}**\n\n**{{GAMMA: I'm in a woods, or a park, something like that.

What do you want me to tell you?\n> \n> **JENNER:** The files don't paint the whole picture. Several of them are incomplete, and show signs of damage --\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** That's probably on account of my team destroying as much of it as we could.\n> \n> **JENNER:** What -- may I ask why? Were they --\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** No.\n> \n> **JENNER:** -- cognitohazardous? No?\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** No. They weren't dangerous in of themselves.

UTE-2639 --\n> \n> **JENNER:** SCP-3117.\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** Right, whatever. 3117 -- it isn't -- it isn't whatever you think it is. There's a reason the GOC stopped looking into it and threw everything I didn't destroy over to you guys. \n> \n> **JENNER:** And why is that?\n> \n> **SUBJECT:** We've been investigating this thing for maybe ten, twenty years?

I think -- I think some of these stories, when we tell them -- they're not meant to be thrilling. They're meant to be warnings. A warning to stop. To not open that door -- to not go down the stairs.
