Its structure has been concealed behind a protective dome stylized like a house of the area. Three copies have been built alongside the dome, each guarded by a stationary patrol.\n\nThe specific location is safeguarded through its semantic decomposition into three parts, each part known to the following people:\n\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-moloch-mentality The current Director of Site-36]\n* [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/saffronsands-hub The current General Secretary of GoI-1984 (“The House of the Naga”)]\n* An undisclosed third party\n\nInteraction with SCP-5641 and any of its parts has been suspended indefinitely.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5641 is a stupa[[footnote]]Type of mound-like building containing buddhist relics.[[/footnote]] located somewhere within India, dated to the 6th century BCE[[footnote]]With Gautama Buddha living from the 5th to the 4th century BCE, it is believed the building is either anachronistic or was repurposed.[[/footnote]]. The stupa presents an infohazard involving the knowledge of the stupa’s location, with anyone knowing it suffering at least one of the following symptoms[[footnote]]It is worth noting that correctly inferring the stupa’s location is believed to cause the same symptoms, although to a lesser degree.[[/footnote]]:\n\n* Hearing chants in Pali[[footnote]]Language of the Indian subcontinent. Sacred language of Theravada Buddhism.[[/footnote]] that pray to Ardhanarishvara[[footnote]]Figure of Shiva fused with his consort Parvati, depicted as half-male and half-female. Represents the harmony of masculine and feminine forces. Figure is not present in the Pali canon, nor in Theravada Buddhism.[[/footnote]]. The chants are believed to grow in intensity the longer one stays away from SCP-5641.\n* Dreaming of seven humanoid figures, believed to represent the Saptarishi[[footnote]]Known as the ‘Seven Sages’, these are important figures in Vedic religions, possessing great knowledge and guarding the divine law of Dharma. The Big Dipper in India is named after them.[[/footnote]].\n* A constant taste and smell of blood, diminishing all other flavors and smells sensed by the subject. High salivary calcium levels.\n* A constricting feeling in one's chest, described as 'feeling like they've been chained up.'\n* Hearing a set of steps neither close nor far from one’s position. Subjects believe they ‘don’t follow after you, but are accompanying you.’\n* The sensation of wind and fingers running through one’s hair.\n* Feelings of restlessness and dysphoria, either accompanied or caused by an extreme urge to visit and stay within SCP-5641, under the belief that the subject’s ‘not where they should be.’\n\nThese symptoms will vanish once the memory of the location of SCP-5641 is removed from the subject, with amnestics being effective against these 100% of the time. If these symptoms are allowed to continue without amnestic usage, the person will walk into, be led into, or be teleported into SCP-5641, with their retrieval becoming impossible, impractical or detrimental. Both means and reasoning behind this have been purposefully forgotten.\n\nThe interior of the stupa contains several elements that cause similar symptoms to the ones mentioned earlier, and are triggered by a similar cognitohazard. Due to this, only the most basic descriptors have been allowed to remain:\n\n* A reliquary positioned in the middle of the stupa\n* Its contents\n* A number of monks\n* The path they circumambulate\n* The hymns and prayers they sing\n* The ritual they perform\n* The reason behind it\n\n**Discovery:** Knowledge of the ruins and its effects were forwarded to the Foundation by agents of GoI-1984 (“The House of the Naga”)[[footnote]]Paranormal wing of the Sangh Parivar, a group of Hindu nationalist organizations.

Something they’ve told me isn’t true. Perhaps the chants I hear are from another interpretation of these poems, as a member told me they’re somewhat inconsistent. It seems in the texts Tarakasura had only three sons, the Tripurasura. They also didn’t reign for long: Skanda killed Tarakasura and submitted his two brothers, who I have not heard of. Meanwhile, the Tripurasura were defeated by Shiva, who burned their forts, and sent their believers into the desert.\n\nIs the woman I see in my dreams one of these believers? Is she Parvati?

One you must hear. Are you listening?\n\n**Vashistha:** I am.\n\n**5641-2:** Skanda fought the Saptarasura, and defeated them. This is what we chant of. However, the battle wasn’t an easy fight, nor a simple affair. The Saptarasura had many allies, and many powers, and many boons. They were invincible, as far as any other being knew. This is why Tarakasura’s body was used as a weapon. If he was invincible, the astras made would be equally powerful. The Saptarasura knew they had no chance, so they formed together into a great Asura King, one who went onto rule the universe just like the parts that composed him. He had no name, because no one could utter it. He reeked of scarlet blood, the sacred liquid constantly pouring out his mouth and eyes and ears. He was covered in gold and bronze and all precious metals that composed the seven cities each Saptarasura had built, who he now had fused into a single fort in the shape of a throne, where he sat on and oversaw all the universe from.\n\nNow, as I describe this being, you may think there is no feasible way Skanda would have defeated him, and you would be right. He didn’t.\n\n**Vashistha:** Wait, but the prayers-\n\n**5641-2:** Skanda was strong enough to defeat the Saptarasura, but not the King they’d formed, nor their forts, nor their legions, nor their astras, so he asked for help. He was assisted by many Devas, including his own parents. But even that was not enough.\n\n**Vashistha:** So?\n\n**5641-2:** What can you do to an enemy that cannot, nor will ever be defeated?\n\n**Vashistha:** (//Opens his mouth to answer, but nothing comes out.//)\n\n**5641-2:** You stall them, indefinitely, through any means possible.\n\n-----\n\n(//The scene remains the same, but 5641-3 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.//)\n\n**Vashistha:** So the prayers are to stall the Saptarasura.\n\n**5641-3:** Indeed, and yet the truth isn’t as easy. We’re stalling a seventh part of the Saptarasura.\n\n**Vashistha:** A seventh?\n\n**5641-3:** When Skanda planned to defeat the Asura King, he first had to get to him. To get to him, he first had to get rid of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/daevite-hub his many followers.] These were all the Asura and the Yaksha and the Rakshasa and the Kumbhanda and all who decided to follow him, because the King had offered them power like none other: Freedom. And they used this freedom to enslave, and to wage war, and to inflict pain and misery upon all others. And thus a dark age besieged the world, and the King thrived.\n\n**Vashistha:** How were they defeated?\n\n**5641-3:** Skanda asked Lord Brahma to grant him the boon that would conquer his followers, and after ten thousand thousand years of meditation, it was granted to him: The sacred texts that contained all knowledge yet to be. Skanda presented it to the King’s followers, and told them all answers were contained within. Curious, they peaked in, and saw a future of dominion; one of everlasting conquest. They cheered and they feasted and their happiness was unlike any other.\n\nSkanda turned to Lord Brahma and asked him “I see the men and women of the Asura King whose name cannot be said and cannot be heard feasting, fulfilled in both body and mind. How can you say, Lord Brahma, that this is a weapon to defeat them?”\n\nAnd Lord Brahma smiled, and explained that for all history that must be remembered is considered //Smriti//, and is kept within one’s heart and one’s mind, but the texts given to the followers were //Asmriti//, which is the texts to be forgotten, and are thrown out of one’s heart and one’s mind, never to pollute the universe again.\n\nAnd as he explained, Skanda saw that the followers, who were warriors and workers and architects and poets all fell to the ground, and melted into clay, leaving their clothes and weapons and slaves behind, who now free, praised to Skanda and Lord Brahma who both had saved them from their chains.\n\nAll left of the followers was the //[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-140 Asmriti]//, with now empty pages, and the men who were enslaved took it and hid it, for the Asmriti’s content must not be remembered, else the followers will return and they will enslave and wage war and mock the Devas again.\n\n**Vashistha:** Is this book what is kept here?\n\n**5641-3:** The book is not the part contained here. The book is lost to all, I hope, and should remain as such.\n\n-----\n\n(//The scene remains the same, but 5641-4 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.//)\n\n**5641-4:** Skanda kept on his path, and was confronted by seven women: The seven wives of the seven Saptarasura. They stood over the followers, and made sure to both ensure their compliance, and bring all their gifts to their husbands. Without the followers, there was no compliance to be had, and no gifts to receive. The seven wives were enraged by this, and confronted Skanda.\n\nThese seven wives were powerful Asuri, capable of bending clay and blood and life, and using these they created plants that poured not //soma// but //halahala//, and a single drop of it could corrupt all life it touched. What seemed to surely be a battle soon turned to a peace agreement, however. Skanda asked the Asuri why they were, amidst the ruins of their now-gone empire instead of next to the golden throne of the Asura King. And why were they fighting him instead of the Asura King, and they understood that he cared not for them anymore, if ever.\n\nSkanda thus stopped his mission, and attempted to find husbands for the Asuri. It took several hundred years, but the wisest and most forgiving of all men stepped forward, and promised they would ensure their safety and fight for them. These men are now known as the Saptarishi, the Seven Sages.\n\nSkanda brought Agni who ignited a great pyre, who they all danced around, praying for each other’s health and to survive the King’s ordeal, and to have healthy children who will live better lives. Thus was born the Saat phere ceremony, and the Saptapadi, and all marriages included them from that point on. And the seven wives attained enlightenment, and their poison turned into //amrita//, and with a single touch, the land was blessed with mango trees and jasmines and even the lotus flower began to flourish where only bloodshed had flourished before.\n\n**Vashistha:** So the Asuri are the Seven Sages’ wives? Our wives?\n\n**5641-4:** The truth isn’t as simple. Yes, they once were, but not anymore. After many years, they discovered that the seed of the Saptarasura remained within the Asuri long after their consummation; long after their defeat even. The Asuri are cursed to bear the next generation of Asura, who will be stronger than they ever were, and will have no weaknesses, not to any man nor to any Deva.\n\nAs such, the Devas and the Saptarishi had to make sure these children would never be born, and the seven wives were sealed away. They will never understand the happiness of giving birth, for they cannot be allowed to, and will never see Agni’s light again, for their children will steal it, and sink the world into a darkness there's no return from. Where they are now, we cannot know. I pray that wherever they are, they are safe from the influence of the Asura King.\n\n-----\n\n(//The scene remains the same, but 5641-5 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.//)\n\n**5641-5:** After the followers and the wives had been dealt with, Skanda finally encountered the King. He was ten thousand times his strength, and ten trillion times his size. He knew all there was to know, and his seven mouths spoke profanities and his eyes killed all who saw into them. He had fourteen hands, and he knew all //mudras// and practiced all //pranayamas// and controlled the seven winds known as //vayu//.\n\nSkanda knew he could not defeat the King, so he prayed to Lord Brahma again, asking for a different boon. He offered the seven astras of Tarakasura, and in turn Lord Brahma sent Tvashtr, who had forged Indra’s //vajra//, and he took the astras, and transformed them into [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kte-2013-kapala-mendes seven golden spears.] And each spear Skanda wielded, and each spear was thrusted into the King, and the King screeched in pain as the spears absorbed each of the Saptarasura.\n\nSeven thrusts later and the Saptarasura was no more. Skanda knew this was not the end, for the spears slowly corroded, the gold falling off, leaving only ugly iron behind. The Saptarasura could not be as easily defeated, nor as easily sealed, for they had meditated to strengthen themselves during the time the spears were forged. The spears wanted to come together; the seals wanted to come undone.\n\nAs such, Skanda granted each spear to the seven most powerful warriors, who then left, to never meet again. The spears bled and thrashed and from time to time the Saptarasura would escape their cells, and the warriors would best them.\n\nIf we are to win this war, the spears must never meet again.\n\n-----\n\n(//The scene remains the same, but 5641-6 is the one sitting in front of Dr. Vashistha.//)\n\n**5641-6:** Skanda stood unopposed, but he knew this was not the end. Even if the followers had been forgotten, they could return. Even if the wives were sealed away, the seals could break. Even if the spears had been separated, they could reunite. This was because people remembered, and memories are //Brahman.// To best this, Skanda needed for them to become //Maya//, an illusion.\n\nFor this, he asked for Shiva to help him, and Shiva indeed offered his help. He took a single glance at the throne which had once been seven forts, and molded it into the image of a singular beast: The Asura King. And the beast would speak like the King, and move like the King, and all would [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2317 be made to believe that this was the King.]\n\nAnd then it was sealed away, and many scholars would make sure that this Fake King would be found and feared and revered as the real King. This too would be a seal, for it would seal away the truth of the Asura King’s existence.\n\n-----\n\n**Vashistha:** First were the followers, second were the wives, third was the King, fourth was the decoy. What were the last three?\n\n**5641-2:** A pertinent question, but it seems you still are missing a point.\n\n**5641-5:** Tell me, do you really believe seven spears were enough to bring down the King?\n\n**Vashistha:** Were they not?\n\n**5641-4:** His corporeal form, sure, but the //sthula sarira//[[footnote]]Physical mortal body in the Three Bodies Doctrine.[[/footnote]] is merely one of three. Skanda still had the //sukshma//[[footnote]]Body composed of the mind and other vital energies.[[/footnote]] and the //karana//[[footnote]]Body that veils the //atman//, or True-Self, and births the other two in this universe of ours.[[/footnote]] to deal with.\n\n**Vashistha:** How did he deal with them?\n\n**5641-5:** As soon as the decoy had been built, a strong howling was heard through the land, and all shivered: The voice of the King still remained, seven distinct tones morphed into a cacophony of pain and misery, singing of the darkest of evils, bringing fear and chaos even after his body had been stripped of all mortal power. The King without body smiled, and from a mouth that did not exist, blood poured.\n\nAnd the blood became a sea of obscenity that washed over the new world, and submerged it all in its miasma. The King used the knowledge of his defeat to strengthen even after death, and brought the same destruction that befell his followers and his kingdom unto men and Deva equally. Soon, there was no land to stand on, and many perished. The survivors were rescued by Vishnu, who took on the shape of a great fish, and took on the name of Matsya.\n\nSkanda stood by Matsya’s side, and knew not what to do, so he asked for help. And Matsya provided, and help arrived in the shape of the few he rescued. These were the slaves the followers of the King had chained and tortured, and they had been promised kingdoms and riches beyond comprehension, and they would become the Kshatriya who would rule earth. But the slaves turned to Skanda, and offered to trade all that had been promised to them in exchange of stopping the King from taking the world over again.\n\nSkanda thus cursed the slaves, and the slaves would again be at the bottom, standing as the lowest of all castes. In doing so, however, the King’s mind and rage and blood was forever locked inside their minds, and the seas subsided, and the King’s form was defeated once more. Were he to ever return, he would [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2439 control nobody but those who stood at the bottom of it all], and they would be laughed at and mocked by all but Skanda, who knew they had committed the greatest of all sacrifices.\n\n**Vashistha:** What about his True-Self?\n\n**5641-1:** Skanda thought there was nothing left of the King, but the Saptarishi warned him: Past body and mind there is still one’s True-Self, directly attuned to the rest of the universe. As long as it existed, the King could return.\n\nOf course, the True-Self will always exist no matter what. It is part of Brahman, and stands ever-permanent. It was the one weakness in Skanda’s plan: The King could not be banished, for he had existed, and would thus forever remain.\n\nBut the Saptarishi knew something that many others ignored: The existence of the King was devoid of Dharma, so he could not know of the truth of the True-Self. Another weapon was born out of this knowledge; another illusion.\n\nSkanda took the clay and the dirt and the broken weapons that littered the ground, and molded them into seven urns. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3838 These seven urns, seven tribes took.] These tribes kept them trapped in the past, so that the King would never see a future. As long as the tribes kept them intact, they would thrive. As long as the tribes kept them, the King would believe a part of him resided within, and thus would never attain his True-Self, for his ignorance acted as a trap in and of itself.\n\nThe tribes soon left, and Skanda smiled. He smiled, because the King was no more.\n\n-----\n\n**5641-2:** His legion fallen, his wives converted.\n\n**5641-3:** His body broken, his throne transformed.\n\n**5641-4:** His mind trapped, his True-Self unrealized.\n\n**5641-5:** Thus the King was defeated. Skanda stood victorious.\n\n**5641-6:** Now we sing of his glory, as we cheer for the past that was changed in our favor, for the present that we’ve allowed others to enjoy, and for the future that is still within reach.\n\n**Vashistha:** … That’s six. You said there’s seven parts.\n\n**5641-1:** There are seven indeed. We’ve yet to mention the one we safeguard.\n\n**Vashistha:** What is it? Which part do we safeguard?\n\n**5641-2:** This final question cannot be answered. It cannot be known. To know it is to invite him. To invite him is [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-2747 to face the end.] This is the truth of the seventh seal. A seal shrouded in ignorance, because we know better. We //must// know better.\n\n**Vashistha:** Is this why we sing?\n\n**5641-3:** The chants are a seal, yes. We pray because Skanda has asked us to. We chant his name because he must be remembered. We sing of Saptarasura’s defeat, because were we to stop, the world would forget it. And if the world forgets, then the King will return, because the King is ignorance, and the King is division, and the King is all the foul and the profane and yet he was defeated.\n\n**5641-4:** And yet, even in defeat he thrives. Even in death he lives. Even vanquished he conquers.\n\n**5641-5:** So we pray and as we pray the world remembers the triumph: A world of nature, and not of bloodshed. A world of pillars, and not of rubble. A world of freedom, and not of chains.\n\n**5641-6:** And so, all questions are answered, but one: Are you ready to pray?\n\n**Vashistha:** Must I?\n\n**5641-2:** You are in no obligation to do it, but you must do it. The seal shall not be completed until the Seven Sages pray of Skanda’s greatness in the battle with Saptarasura.\n\n**5641-3:** If you decline, then you will live your life, die, be reincarnated and, some day, we will meet again.\n\n**5641-6:** Your free will shan’t be tainted. At the same time, however, you came here for a reason. You, and not your previous reincarnations, but //you.//\n\n**Vashistha:** Why me, and not them?\n\n**5641-6:** That we cannot answer. Only thou knows thyself.\n\n**Vashistha:** I… I don’t know if I want to leave my old life behind.\n\n**5641-2:** No one who’s come here wanted to, at the beginning. To abandon it all for the sake of everyone else… That’s a heavy sacrifice to make. It isn’t easy.\n\n**5641-3:** But it’s the right thing to do. It is our duty.\n\n**Vashistha:** It’ll be my duty too then.\n\n**5641-6:** Have you decided then?\n\n**Vashistha:** There was no decision to make, was there? The moment I stepped in, I stepped in because I would join you all. I knew that I needed to be here. Now I know why. I understand my mission, and I accept it. This is my aim, my goal, my purpose. I am where I belong.\n\n**5641-1:** Welcome home, Vashistha.\n\n-----\n\n(//The log consists only of audio, with seven people praying to the sound of drums.
