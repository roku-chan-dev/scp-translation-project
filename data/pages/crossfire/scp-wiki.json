Making their way to where they believed the intended target was, they both had the mindset that failure is not an option\n\n----\nNorth steadily looked through the scope of his rifle. He watched as four operatives patrolled the outside gate.\n\nKneeling beside North, as he looked through a set of rangefinders, Bixtwist leaned over whispering.\n\n“750 meters, wind at two clicks an hour east.”\n\nTaking the new information into account, North repositioned his rifle as he scanned the side of the compound for the target. \n\n“Bix, you sure this is the right Chaos base?”\n\nBixtwist gave a silent nod as he quickly glanced at his map. \n\nUpon hearing the sounds of alarms. The team of two suddenly dropped closer to the ground. \n\nAs he continued to scan the compound with his rangefinder, Bixtwist leaned over.\n\n“North, we got an additional  problem.”\n\n“Is it time to book it?”\n\n“Worse, Epsilon-6 is doing a raid…”\n\n“The ‘Village Idiots?’ We’re in the middle of the forest, what are they doing out here?”\n\n“I’m just as confused as you are, North.”\n\nAn explosion roared in the distance, making both of them flinch.\n\n\n“North, shouldn’t we be helping out Epsilon-6?”\n\nStaring at the battle taking place on the compound grounds, North shook his head.\n\n“We can’t. The Village Idiots can’t know. It’s hard enough to get a Task Force amnestics. Nine would kill us.”\n\n“Wouldn’t Nine also kill us if they died?”\n\nSighing, North peered down the scope of his rifle once more. \n\n“Status?”\n\nInstantly kneeling down beside North, as they have done multiple times before, Bixtwist looked over the compound with his rangefinder. \n\n“730 meters, the wind is at one and a half clicks an hour southeast.”\n\nCarefully aiming his rifle, North gave the trigger a quick tug. The sound of gunpowder igniting was lost to the sound of combat in the compound. A Chaos Insurgency operative fell from their position, with a quarter sized hole in the side of their head.\n\nCarefully repeating the process making sure the Task Force wouldn't take notice, North and Bixtwist watched over Epsilon-6 until each of them in the Task Force had made their way into the compound. \n\nLeaning up looking over the scope of his rifle, North glanced towards his partner.\n\n“We should head out, no doubts someone would've picked up on the muzzle flash.”\n\nGiving a thumbs up, Bixtwist packed his rangefinder in his pouch. The pair of them started to crawl further into the forest sticking within the overgrowth.\n\nHearing the loud roar in the distance, the two of them held their ground as the trees started to bend. They both watched as an attack helicopter flew over their position heading towards the base.\n\n“That isn’t one of ours Bix.”\n\n“Let’s loop around and get a better position.”\n\nWasting no time, both of them arched back looking over the compound from a new angle.\n\nPlacing his rifle on the ground laying beside it, North put his sights on the hovering helicopter. \n\nBix using his rangefinder, whispered.\n\n“620 meters, wind at two point three clicks an hour southeast.”\n\nPutting the tip of his crosshair on the pilot's forehead. They watched as the helicopter dropped from the sky. Exploding in at the wall of the compound. With unison, Bixtwist and North started to move from their position. \n\nThe Chaos Insurgency base was in utter madness. The duo crept along the tree line, staying within the safety of weeds and grass.\n\nHearing the sound of gunfire fade, they glanced at the compound to witness it in a blaze of orange and yellow. They quietly made their way further into the forest. A sound roared behind them as another helicopter flew overhead. Bixtwist and North quickly stopped.\n\n\nTrying to hide in the bushes, hoping their camo outfits would suffice, the team of two broke into a sprint as a floodlight shined directly on them. \n\nGlancing back to check if Bixtwist was keeping up with him, North watched in horror. He witnessed a muzzle flash from the side of the helio. Time appeared to slow down for North. As he watched, Bixtwist fell to the ground with a hole in the center of his chest. Glancing up to the flying metal machine aiming his rifle, North hesitated seeing the sigil for Epsilon-6.\n\nDucking into the tree lines, hearing a bullet pass his ear. North grabbed a blue flare off his vest, igniting it without hesitation with hopes Epsilon-6 would notice they are on the same team.\n\nHis ears ringing from the sound of a gunshot. Feeling a bullet penetrate his hip, North fell to the ground with a loud thud. \n----\nHearing a loud knock his office door, North flinched as he was snapped back into reality. Breathing heavily he set down the photo of his late friend, Bixtwist next to multiple framed medals on his desk with utmost care. \n\nSlowly standing up, making sure his tie was straight, North tried to calm down, getting control of his breathing. He could never get the ringing out of his ears from that fateful night.\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
