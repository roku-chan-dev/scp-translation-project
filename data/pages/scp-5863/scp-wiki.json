Any activities suggestive of organic life will be logged and reported automatically. The roads leading into Darwin County should be placed under construction indefinitely, to prevent civilian incursion. Entrance into Darwin County should not be attempted unless absolutely necessary. The Foundation will continue to fund Mallard Park State Wildlife Refuge until further notice.\n\n//The nature of SCP-5863 is currently unknown to the Foundation. The following proposed explanations are currently under investigation.//\n\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Proposal Alpha]]\n**Description:** SCP-5863 refers to Mallard Park State Wildlife Refuge, an Oklahoma state park established in 1997, and apparently run by the Oklahoma government, in tandem with the Department of Unreality.  Mallard Park does not appear on any Foundation or government records outside of financial statements before its discovery in 2017, and has no staff, Foundation or otherwise, officially assigned to the area.\n\nSCP-5863 appears to cause heightened levels of cortisol, adrenaline, and blood pressure in subjects viewing or aware of their proximity to SCP-5863. Symptoms appear to worsen should a subject move in the direction of SCP-5863. Foundation Agents who entered Mallard Park during the initial investigation are currently being treated for psychological trauma.\n\nDespite its name, no animal life, human or otherwise, has been observed within or around the park.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Proposal Beta]]\n**Description:** SCP-5863 refers to the area known as Darwin County, Oklahoma. All properties within Darwin County appear to be properly maintained, despite the fact that no human occupants have been observed within SCP-5863 since its discovery in 2017. The county also appears to consume water and electricity at a rate consistent with the number of permanent residents listed in the most recent national census. Attempts to contact individuals who reportedly live within SCP-5863 have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nSeven of the thirteen Foundation agents who have entered SCP-5863 have apparently disappeared while within SCP-5863, although two of these individuals have been recovered later.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Proposal Mu]]\n**Description:** SCP-5863 refers to Mallard Park State Wildlife Refuge, which is believed to be the first known instance of a Disunion Area. A Disunion Area is a theoretical concept initially conceived of by acclaimed Anomalous Physicist Dr. Sayen O'Riley in 1989, which proposed the concept of an Anti-Nexus, or an area of space which is not only devoid of, but appears to repel anomalies.\n\nThe potential causes and consequences of such an area are currently undetermined.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n**Addendum 5863.1:** Recovered Documents\n\nNo physical documents have been recovered from the Mallard Park Ranger Building. All digital documents recovered from the Mallard Park Ranger Building computers have been entirely content-less, with the exception of two files, attached below.\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 5863.mp3\" hide=\"- 5863.mp3\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**0:00-0:43**: Audio file appears to be completely silent.\n\n**0:44**: A heavy and loud distortion is suddenly present in the recording. Sound is reminiscent of the sound made when a camera picks up strong winds, however it is present too constantly for that to be a likely cause.\n\n**0:45-1:00**: The sound of ducks quacking slowly becomes audible in the recording.\n\nThe distortion and vocalizations of ducks continue, until the recording ends 10 minutes and 43 seconds later.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 5863(2).mp3\" hide=\"- 5863(2).mp3\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**0:00**: The same distortion present in the last recording can be heard. The sound of ducks is likewise, still present. Both sounds are present throughout the entirety of the recording.\n\n**0:03**: A sound similar to an aluminum can being opened can be heard.\n\n**0:22-1:08**: A hissing noise can be heard. The sound has been described as \"similar to frying meat.\"\n\n**1:08**: Hissing abruptly stops.\n\n**1:09:** Something is heard hitting the ground, and rolling to a slow stop.\n\nRecording continues for an additional 54 seconds, where only the distortion and sounds of ducks are present, before abruptly terminating.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n----\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5862]]] | SCP-5863 | [[[SCP-5864]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
