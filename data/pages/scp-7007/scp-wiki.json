The anomaly may be viewed under strict limitations, with explicit approval of Site Director McInnis.  \n\nUnder no circumstances is any member of Overwatch Command to be allowed to view the anomaly or be informed of the anomaly’s existence.  Access to the content of SCP-7007 is restricted to those personnel specifically cleared to review; general knowledge of the anomaly is to be suppressed even among Foundation personnel. \n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n++++ __Description__:\n\nSCP-7007 designates a cathode ray tube (CRT) television continuously playing a single episode of the game show //Misfortune Gorge//, sponsored and distributed by GoI-5889 (“[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vikander-kneed-technical-media-hub | Vikander-Kneed Technical Media]]]”).  The episode is apparently from an established series, but no reference to other episodes has been found within the database.\n\nThe recording consistently displays image degradation, static and warping lasting for brief periods.  However, the audio is consistent with 1990s recording techniques.  Despite this, Misfortune Gorge’s opening crawl alleges the episode was filmed in front of a live studio audience and contains copyright information indicating it was distributed in 2022.[[footnote]]The identifying copyright number does not match any on record with the US Office of Copyright or any other nation’s equivalent federal body.[[/footnote]]  The manner and technique of storing the video file on SCP-7007 has not been discovered.  The television appears to be of standard production and no obvious mechanical modifications have been discovered upon disassembly that would explain its ability to store video files.  The anomaly has no need for electrical current to maintain operation, and if an individual enters containment in the midst of the episode’s playtime, the anomaly will reset and start the episode from the beginning.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM-7000%20Print%20AD\n| caption=Print ad shipped with SCP-7007.\n| width=300px]]\nIndividuals who watch the episode are convinced of the veracity of everything depicted during its runtime of forty-three minutes.  This conviction will begin to affect the behavior of viewers in predictable ways: they believe the events actually occurred, and react accordingly.  Amnestics have been ineffective on those subjects who have viewed the video, leading researchers to theorize that memories of the show are effectively permanent.  This anomalous effect has been demonstrated even after merely reading a transcript of the show in print form.  \n\n**Discovery**:  On 25 September 2022, the anomaly was received at Site-43 in a Foundation-issued secure artifact case, with a label indicating it was shipped with escalated security protocols from [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facilities-locations | Area-32]]].  Director McInnis, finding the transfer of anomalies from Area-32 suspicious, ordered the parcel inspected.  Ultrasound revealed a television set from the late 1980s; sounds were noted emanating from within the parcel.  Director McInnis and Dr. Lillihammer alone were present when the parcel was opened, finding the following note and attached print ad:[[footnote]]William Wettle, Researcher in Replication Studies at Site-43, claimed to have no knowledge of the anomaly and categorically denied any connection to [[[scp-6123 | GOI-5889]]].[[/footnote]]\n\n> Dear Dr. Wettle,\n> \n> We’re hoping you’d do us the favor of reviewing the show we’ve enclosed.

He is wearing a red-and-white checkered suit coat, wide black tie over yellow collared shirt, and red slacks. His skin is ashy gray, and his eyes are consistently leaking black, oily tears. He smiles at the camera; his teeth are bloody and stained yellow. He is holding a long, thin microphone measuring approximately forty-five centimeters.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Welcome back to another splendiferous episode of Misfortune Gorge, the gameshow where our contestants use their wits and hard-won life skills in a steep competition of life and death!\n\n//[Raucous applause began with Kincaid’s introduction but then trails off into silence as the host finishes.  The view pulls in for a closeup of Kincaid’s face.  He winks, squirting oily liquid onto his coat and microphone.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh, relax.

One where the sweat of the brow and the accomplishments of our contestants are earned the hard way: through nepotism and global conspiracies.  That’s right! Today, our contestants are all from everyone’s favorite oppressive secret regime: the SCP Foundation!  //[whispering]// Or is that Secure Contain Protect Foundation?  Honestly that sounds worse.  We’ll stick with the first one.\n\n//[The view zooms out to show the stage as Kincaid walks over to a heavy curtain, rust colored and deteriorated.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Things, creeps and glorious consumers we call an audience, let me introduce our contestants.  \n\n//[The following graphic appears on screen.]//\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM-7000%20contestants]]\n\n//[The image fades and the curtains draw back to reveal the three individuals indicated, although Agent Echo is without his weapon.  All three look confused and quickly glance around the stage.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Let’s get to know our lucky contestants!  O5-7, introduce yourself.\n\n**O5-7**: Marjorie Gonzales, O5-7 of the Foundation.  \n\n//[O5-7’s eyes are wide as she speaks.  She looks at the other two contestants in horror.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Well Marjorie, tell us a little about yourself!\n\n**O5-7**: I’ve been on Overwatch Command for over ten years.  I gave up everything for this organization.  I left my husband and my seven-year-old son to take this position.  They were amnesticized, they think I’m dead.  My son dropped out of high school recently and has taken up heroin. \n\n//[O5-7 tries to cover her mouth halfway through her speech but her arms won’t rise all the way and she continues to speak.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh no!  Have you ever tried to reach out to them?\n\n**O5-7**: Not even once. \n\n//[O5-7’s eyes narrow and she says this last line through gritted teeth.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: How fitting!  Alright, enough from you. Agent Echo, how are things?\n\n//[O5-7 continues moving her mouth as if speaking, but no sound comes out.  Agent Echo looks at O5-7 in shock, but begins speaking.  O5-7 appears to be screaming.]//\n\n**Agent Echo**: I don’t actually know.  I’ve been with the Foundation for a significant amount of time, but there’s been so many missions that were amnesticized, so it could’ve been three years or three weeks.\n\n**Kincaid**: Well, that’s no good.  Hopefully you have some fun tonight, right folks?\n\n//[Rousing applause is heard.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Well, Marjorie, could you shed any light on Echo’s conundrum?\n\n**O5-7**: //[Grimacing]// It’s just cheaper to amnesticize than pay for psychological treatment, and more effective. \n\n**Kincaid**: Well, isn’t that interesting!  How do you feel about that, Echo?\n\n//[Echo stares at O5-7.  She avoids his gaze.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Well, he’s just flat out stupefied, folks!  Marjorie, anything else?\n\n**O5-7**: We need our agents working at peak efficiency, and they experience a lot of trauma.  Not to mention are sometimes asked to do ethically questionable actions to contain an anomaly.  So amnesticization is just better for everyone.  That way they’re still useful.\n\n//[O5-7 flips off Kincaid, which is blurred on the video.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Now now, that’s no good!  We’re a family show here at Misfortune Gorge!\n\n//[The audience boos, prompting O5-7 to flip off the audience.  As she focuses off camera she takes a step back, and her mouth opens wide.  Agent Echo stares at O5-7, his fists clenched at his side.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: And our final contestant!  Dr. Kleiner, introduce yourself.\n\n//[Up until being addressed, the researcher had been paying little attention to Kincaid or her fellow contestants.  She had been looking around the stage, in a focused manner.  She does not cease her observations, but does respond to the host.]//\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Isabel Kleiner.

Yes.  Professionally speaking, I don’t know how I got here, and I want to.\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh, sounds like we’ve got a contender here!\n\n//[A medium build, middle aged man, dressed in slacks and a tucked-in button down shirt emerges from behind the curtain.

If I took my eye off the ball, I would lose my position and then the world would suffer.\n\n**Caspian**: But you’re my mother.  I needed you.\n\n**O5-7**: The Foundation needed me more, Cas.\n\n**Kincaid**: Really?\n\n**O5-7**: Okay, no, but I didn’t really want to be a mother anyway!\n\n//[O5-7’s mouth hangs open after this.  She looks away, downcast.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Excellent! Three points to Marjorie!\n\n//[The audience claps.]//\n\n**Kevin**: Well, you’re still a dick.\n\n**Kincaid**: Yes I am!\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n+++ //TIME TO MAKE THE MONEY!//\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[html]]\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/731859302?h=fbe6152156\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n[[/html]]\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Final Segment\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//[Screen fades in from the last commercial to find Kincaid sitting cross legged on the floor of the stage.  The oily brown substance is pooling around him on the floor, pouring from his eyes and down his shirt and into his lap.  The three contestants are facing him in a semicircle, but are standing.  Kevin is bound to a simple wooden chair in the corner of the screen, his mouth gagged with cloth.  He is rocking back and forth in the chair.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh look who’s back, it’s the audience!  We missed you.\n\n**O5-7**: //[Scoffs]// Audience.\n\n**Kincaid**: Sorry?\n\n**O5-7**: What audience?\n\n**Kincaid**: //[Pointing at the camera]// The Audience.  \n\n//[O5-7 moves over to the camera and turns it around.[[footnote]]Interestingly, as the view rotates 180° there is no camera operator seen.[[/footnote]]  The audience is an American football field sized coliseum.  At least seventy thousand people sit in the stands.  The closest seats are visible as the camera pans by.  Filling each seat is a humanoid corpse in various states of decomposition.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Stop it! \n\n//[The camera circles back to the stage and Kincaid ushers O5-7 back to where she was before.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: They’re shy.\n\n//[Kincaid winks at the camera.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Alright, who’s ready for the last part of the show?\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Good god, yes. Let’s get this over with.  I have research I could be doing.\n\n**Agent Echo**: Yeah, I’m done here.\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh?  Oh yes! Important things to get back to, and then get your memory erased!  Fun fun.\n\n//[Agent Echo frowns, but does not respond.]//\n\n **O5-7**: Okay, that’s enough.  Leave him be.\n\n**Kincaid**: Where was that nurturing spirit a minute ago?\n\n**O5-7**: Tell us what the game is already.\n\n**Kincaid**: Alright alright. It’s actually my favorite! Because it’s time for:\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM-7000%20Guess%20that%20number]]\n\n**Kincaid**: Okay! Ready?\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: What about the rules?\n\n**Kincaid**: You guess the number I’m thinking of.\n\n**O5-7**: That’s ridiculous.\n\n**Kincaid**: No, it isn’t.  Tell me another game show that’s ever done that.  Go on, I’m waiting.\n\n**Agent Echo**: He’s got you there.\n\n//[Kincaid walks over to Echo and slaps him on the back, leaving a rusty handprint on his uniform.]// \n\n**Kincaid**: Thank you, my friend!\n\n//[Kevin is struggling in his chair, succeeding in catching Dr. Kleiner’s attention.  He indicates his bindings with a head motion.  Kleiner stares at him, then turns back towards Kincaid and the other contestants.]//\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Alright, let’s play already.\n\n//[Kevin’s low whimpering can be heard for a moment, but audience applause drowns it out.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Okay! Number between 1 and 10.  Echo, you first.  Go!\n\n//[Agent Echo just grimaces.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Pick. A. Fucking. Number.\n\n**Agent Echo**: Uh, four.\n\n**Kincaid**: Hmmm.  Nope, that’s not it.\n\n**Agent Echo**: Who cares?\n\n**Kincaid**: That’s the spirit!  Marjorie?\n\n//[O5-7 sighs.  Kevin begins softly moaning in the background again, and Dr Kleiner turns to look at him.]//\n\n**O5-7**: Eight.\n\n**Kincaid**: No way!  Okay, Doctor? Your turn.\n\n//[Dr. Kleiner is looking at Kevin.  No emotion is easily readable on her face.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: //[Touching his ear]// Jerry, will you please take George to the back?\n\n//[A humanoid-shaped darkness begins to drag Kevin off to the side of the stage.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Oh Dr. Kleiner?\n\n//[She turns away from Kevin and looks back at Kincaid.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Wow! Nothing fazes you, huh?  What’s your guess?  You’re tied with Marjorie, so if you don’t get it, we’re going back around!\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Seven.\n\n//[Confetti begins falling from above them, with a klaxon sounding and trumpets playing a fanfare.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: That’s it!\n\n**O5-7**: Come on.\n\n**Kincaid**: Complain, complain, complain. What now?\n\n**O5-7**: You probably didn’t even have a number in mind, you just picked who you wanted to win.\n\n**Kincaid**: That’s absolutely true.\n\n**O5-7**: Seriously?\n\n**Kincaid**: What’s the matter? You only like playing when you’re the one who can manipulate the results? You’re only happy when you can ruin a man’s dreams of having a primetime gameshow?  \n\n**O5-7**: What are you talking about?\n\n**Kincaid**: Why do you do it anyway? Don’t tell me that nonsense about dying in the dark, lady.  Why do you insist on containing everything?  I worked for years on that show.  One simple decision by you fucks, and it’s all up in smoke.  So tell me, why contain the things that aren’t nightmares?  No more bullshit.\n\n**O5-7**: We’ve been doing it so long, we don’t know how to exist any other way.  And we don’t want to let go.\n\n**Kincaid**: Of what?\n\n**O5-7**: Control.  It’s in the name, for fuck’s sake.  And if the [[[scp-6500 | anomalies weren’t around to control]]] anymore, we’d lose what hold we have.\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Inspiring.  Can we leave now?\n\n//[Kincaid points at Echo and O5-7, snapping his fingers.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: They can!\n\n//[Tendrils of black sludge reach up from the floor of the stage, wrapping themselves around Echo and O5-7, dragging them down into a hole opened in the floor.]//\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Listen, I don’t care what you do to them.  I’m going home.\n\n**Kincaid**: What about your prize?\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: I don’t care.\n\n//[Kincaid snaps his fingers again, and the prizes are all laid out in front of them.  He walks over and lifts the paper bag, staining it further with his fingers covered in brown fluid.  At this point the only distinguishing feature on Kincaid is the eyes, glowing a dull yellow.]//\n\n//[He walks over and hands her the bag.  She gingerly opens it, trying to avoid the residue from his touch. She pulls out a crumpled pile of papers.  She looks at them and glances up at the camera, her eyes wide.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: An exclusive employment contract with Vikander-Kneed Technical Media planning and statistics department!  Already signed!\n\n//[Dr. Kleiner frantically flips to the last pages.]//\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: Hey, my signature is here.  I didn’t sign this!\n\n**Kincaid**: I’ll think you’ll find that you did.  \n\n//[Kincaid turns to the camera with his arms open wide.  A spray of the brown liquid hits Kleiner.]//\n\n**Kincaid**: Well, that’s all folks!  We’re outta time here at Misfortune Gorge.  I hope you all had a good time, I know our very own Dr. Kleiner did.  Don’t worry, you’ll be seeing a lot of her in the future!  She’s VKTM material.\n\n**Dr. Kleiner**: The fuck I am!\n\n**Kincaid**: Just smell that gumption, folks! Can’t wait to get started!  Thank you to our sponsors, Vikander-Kneed Technical Media.  For a Better Tomorrow^^TM^^.  Goodnight, America!\n\n//[Credits begin to roll as the camera pulls back from the stage.  Dr. Kleiner is dragged back into the shadows of the side stage area, and Kincaid follows her.]//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; grid-gap: 10px;border:solid 1px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 50px; background: #000000; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:left; width: 50%; padding: 0 2%\"]]\n\n[[>]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 200%]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Alfa Slab One', cursive;\"]]##FFFFFF|Misfortune##[[/span]] [[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##c1c1c1|Produced by##\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##FFFFFF|Cast##\n@@ @@\n##c1c1c1|The Host##\n##c1c1c1|O5-7##\n##c1c1c1|Agent Echo##\n##c1c1c1|Dr. Kleiner##\n##c1c1c1|Kevin##\n@@ @@\n##FFFFFF|Crew##\n@@ @@\n##c1c1c1|Production Designer##\n##c1c1c1|Key Grip##\n##c1c1c1|Graphic Designer##\n##c1c1c1|Light Board Operator##\n##c1c1c1|Planning and Statistics##\n##c1c1c1|Puppet Creative Consultant##\n##c1c1c1|Music Coordinator##\n##c1c1c1|Editing Supervisor##\n##c1c1c1|Best Boy##\n##c1c1c1|Casting Supervisor##\n@@ @@\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float:right; width: 45%; padding: 0 2%\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 200%]] [[span style=\"font-family: 'Alfa Slab One', cursive;\"]]##FFFFFF|Gorge##[[/span]] [[/size]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##FFFFFF|Vikander-##\n##FFFFFF|Kneed##\n##FFFFFF|Technical##\n##FFFFFF|Media##\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##FFFFFF|Jeremy Kincaid##\n##FFFFFF|Marjorie Gonzales##\n##FFFFFF|Agent Echo##\n##FFFFFF|Dr. Isabel Kleiner##\n##FFFFFF|Kevin Fillmore##\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Dr. Isabel Kleiner##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n##FFFFFF|Jerry##\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]] \n\n[[=]]\n+++ //ONE MORE AD BREAK TO FEED OUR BANK ACCOUNTS!//\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[html]]\n<iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/731859823?h=54e0116347\" width=\"640\" height=\"564\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; fullscreen\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n[[/html]]\n[[/=]]\n\n//The final image before the episode begins again is included below.//\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/VKTM-7000%20End%20Image]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n> **__Update__**:  (30 September 2022) Agent Echo was found unconscious on the streets of Reykjavik, Iceland.
