Then, and forever after. As creation's most ancient of beings, there are very few things the Brothers Death do not entirely understand. \n> \n> Oddly enough, one such thing are their own creations. \n> \n> Born from mass grave at a time of plague, the Children of the Barrow forever owe their allegiance to Death, they who gave them life. \n> \n> Born from conflict and into conflict, the Children of the Barrow seek always to create a world without it. A world where they would no longer be needed. \n> \n> Born with skill in medicine and healing, the Children of the Barrow name themselves plague doctors, a name fitting for more than one reason. For each plague they cure, another is brought forth from their very existence. \n> \n> The Children of the Barrow wish only to heal, but the Brothers Death may have other plans for them. \n> \n> As does life. \n\n\n\n\nMainline tales (written by Dmatix): \n\n# [[[Three Short Scenes About Death]]]\n# [[[Therapy]]] \n# [[[Painless]]] \n# [[[Surgery]]]\n# [[[Pathology]]] //(coming soon)// \n    \n                                                                      \n\n\n* Special thanks to SunnyClockwork for providing the wonderful art for this page\n@@@@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n**Image 1**\n> **Filename:** //three_death_brothers_by_sunnyclockwork-d973ty7.jpg//\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** [[*user SunnyClockwork]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/death-and-the-doctors-hub/three_death_brothers_by_sunnyclockwork-d973ty7.jpg The SCP Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
