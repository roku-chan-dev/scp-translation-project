But the origins of the project go much further back than that.  \n\nIn 1986 a fledging provisional director of a provisional Site discovers the body of a completely unknown anomalous creature in the basement of an 18^^th^^ century Yorkshire manor.  This cadaver had been ritually sacrificed.  Its murderers were arrayed around it, having died through horrendous violence following the ritual.  \n\nIn researching this anomaly, a series of interconnected anomalous events, artifacts and locations were discovered.  Project Hecatoncheires concerns the research and containment of these anomalies.  It is a multi-level initiative with research into an alien anomalous species, the impact that species has had on human history and the apparent budding return of the species to interfere again in our development.\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n//**What is a god?**//  \n\n//**What does authority mean?**//\n\n//**What good is the individual without a community?**// \n\n//**What can we learn from our enemies?**//\n\n[[/=]]\n-----\n++++ Documentation of Project Hecatoncheires: \n-----\n* [[[SCP-4612 | 19/12/1986]]] - //**SCP-4612**//\n* [[[SCP-4712 | 01/07/1991]]] - //**SCP-4712**//\n* [[[SCP-5512 | 03/04/1992]]] - //**SCP-5512**//\n* [[[SCP-5612 | 21/01/1987]]] - //**SCP-5612**//\n * [[[catching-up | 27/04/1992]]] - //**Catching Up**//\n * [[[looking-forward | 29/04/1992]]] - //**Looking Forward**//\n * [[[cleaning-house | 03/05/1992]]] - //**Cleaning House**//\n-----\n* [[[SCP-3743 | 15/08/1992]]] - //**SCP-3743**//\n * [[[repatriation | 22/02/1993]]] - //**Repatriation**//\n* [[[scp-5957 | 02/05/1993]]] - //**SCP-5957**//\n * [[[fox-hunt | 11/06/1993]]] - //**Fox Hunt**//\n * [[[never-fight-a-land-war-in-the-peloponnese | 08/08/425 BCE]]] - //**Never Fight a Land War in the Peloponnese**//\n* [[[scp-5267 | 15/06/1993]]] - //**SCP-5267**//\n* [[[ee-8832 | 03/07/1993]]] - //**Extranormal Event 8832**//\n-----\n* [[[oh-so-smart-or-oh-so-pleasant | 08/07/1993]]] - //**Oh So Smart or Oh So Pleasant**//\n * [[[an-scp-masquerading-as-a-tale | 11/07/1993]]] - //**An SCP Masquerading as a Tale**//\n * [[[the-ends-justify-the-means-of-production | 11/07/1993]]] - //**The Ends Justify the Means of Production**//\n* [[[scp-5626 | 04/09/1993]]] - //**SCP-5626**//\n* [[[scp-6520 | 19/09/1993]]] - //**SCP-6520**//\n* [[[scp-7812 | 06/10/1993]]] - //**SCP-7812**//\n\n[[=]]\n**THE END**\n[[/=]]\n\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Beta777logotransparent width=\"200px\"]]\n\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n//Below you will find a dossier on the central Site concerned with Project Hecatoncheires.//\n[[/=]]\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Site-91%20Logo%20Small width=\"100px\" height=\"100px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCP Foundation Secure Facility Dossier\n\n+++ Research and Containment Site-91\n\n**Official Designation:** Xenobiological Research and Containment Site-91\n\n**Site Identification Code:** XRC-Site-91\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n++ General Information\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/site91\n| caption=View of Site-91 research and containment facility from the south.]]\n\n\n**Purpose:** Research Site-91 is a heavily secured facility used to research and contain xenobiological and thaumaturgical anomalies of interest.\n\n**Founded:** 17 Jan 1987\n\n**Location:** Rural Yorkshire, England.\n\n**Cover Story:** Privately owned 18^^th^^ century manor.\n\n**Site Function:** Research and Development, Containment, Mobile Task Force Deployment (as needed), center of Project Hecantoncheries activities.\n\n**Size:** Total land area of 2.6km^^2^^\n@@ @@\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ Additional Information:\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/eckhart\n| caption=Portrait of William Henry Eckhart hanging in the entrance of Site-91's primary facility.]]\n++++ __History__:\nThe structure that would become Site-91's primary research facility was built in the early 18^^th^^ century by the Eckhart family, and named Eckhart House.

Site-91 was originally adapted from its previous use to contain SCP-4612 (which was found in the substructure below the manor), but was expanded to a full containment facility, research lab and library. \n\nThe site's research focus is the containment and analysis of xenobiological specimens, with a secondary focus of the development of thaumaturgical countermeasures and containment of thaumaturgical artifacts.  It serves as the primary station for MTF-Beta-777 (“Hecate’s Spear”) due to their familiarity with and expertise in thaumaturgical analysis. \n\n++++ __Security__:\n* Guarded perimeter enclosure\n* Extensive biometric security measures\n* Internal and external security check points\n* Overlapping system of thaumaturgical wards\n* Titanium and beryllium bronze reinforced original structure of manor\n\n++++ __Logistical Capabilities__:\n* Extensive thaumaturgical library and research laboratory\n\n* Xenobiological research laboratory:\n * Dissection and genetic analysis\n\n* Fully functional medical center \n * Trauma and emergency services\n * Surgical suites\n * Intensive care unit\n * Long term hospice care for victims of [[[SCP-5079]]]\n\n* Full contingent of MTF Forces\n * Rapid deployment utilizing VTOL aircraft\n * Central mobilization point for MTF-Beta-777 (\"Hecate's Spear\")\n * Since 5 May 1992, central HQ for Project Hecatoncheires including deployment of MTF-Tau-9 (“Bookworms”) and MTF-Omega-20 (“Thought Police”)\n@@ @@\n----\n[[=]]\n++ Staffing Information\n\n----\n\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/vargaA | width=\"300px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n**Site Director:** \nIona Varga, MD/PhD (seen above)\n\n**Site Superintendent:** \nHidetaki Utseki\n\n**Security Chief:** \nCpt.

After opening a Way on the premises, the agents were able to cast a cantrip to fool the Site-91 thaumaturgical wards, allowing them the ability to access the grounds.  Serpent's Hand agents were able to enter the underground containment vault of 4612-A but were impeded by two things they had failed to consider: \n> \n> a) the excessive density of 4612-A's biological material made the cadaver nearly impossible to remove from the stone slab on which it was found; and\n> \n> b) biometric security features tied into thaumaturgical wards on the containment vault were activated upon non-cleared personnel accessing the vault.  The five Serpent's Hand agents eventually surrendered to on-site security personnel and were detained for attempting to break containment protocols.  \n> \n> After interrogation revealed relevant intelligence, Director Varga ordered the agents amnesticized with class-B chemicals and released to the local constabulatory.  This action was approved by the Ethics Committee Liaison and as such the agents were charged with breaking and entering of a private residence.  They received a sentence of four years and routine surveillance after release showed no continuing ties to the Serpent's Hand.  Following this incident, Capt. Zadeh edited the thaumaturgical wards surrounding Site-91 to better assure that Ways would be incapable of opening inside the perimeter.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n++ Main Facility Structure\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Floor%20A width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Floor%20B.png width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/Floor%20C.png width=\"600px\"]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/grigori-karpin-s-author-page/underground%20vault width=\"600px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n+++ __Person of Interest Dossier File__\n[[/=]]\n\n[[# POI]] [[collapsible show=\"► Access File ◄\" hide=\"▼ Security Verified ▼\"]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-4612-B]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #000000; color:#000000; border-radius: 10px; background: #C5CCBF; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px; padding:10px\"]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Intelligence File: SCP-4612-B\n[[/=]]\n\n**__Aliases__**: //Diego Marquez// (current), //Euboea// (Hellenistic Era, Ancient Greece – //theorized//)\n**__Affiliations__**: //The Second Haptic Assembly// (leader) – GOI-8832\n**__Previous association with the anomalous__**: See [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4612#IC | Incident 4612-1]]], [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5512#UIU | UIU Infiltration and following MTF recordings from SCP-5512]]], and [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cleaning-house | MTF Action Report - Rabban Hormizd Monastery]]]\n**__Anomalous traits__**: 4612-B has exhibited extremely atypical strength for a humanoid entity and the ability to manipulate thermal energy.  He has also recovered from wounds that would be mortal on a nonanomalous human.\n\n* SCP-4612-B is believed to be significantly older than it would appear, as he was first recorded in 1779, where he killed an occult society in York in the basement of Eckhart House, Site-91.  He claimed, during that event, to be the offspring of SCP-4612-A – an unidentifiable, possibly extraterrestrial, limaciform organism that the occult society had allegedly killed. \n\n* It is believed, though not confirmed, that 4612-B decimated a small town on the island of Nassau, Bahamas, in 1815.  See [[[SCP-5612]]]\n\n* In 1992, Gabriel Marquez was leading a cult in Boston, called the Second Haptic Assembly, that the UIU was investigating.  During a sting operation the agents failed to report in after infiltration and the Foundation was called to follow up.  The mobilized MTF found evidence of human experimentation, an abandoned headquarters, the remnants of all the UIU agents (killed in a similar manner as the occultists in York) and Marquez himself opening a Way to an unknown destination in which a creature very reminiscent of 4612-A was witnessed.  Shortly after these events, Agent Rebekah Douglas recognized Marquez as the individual designated 4612-B.\n\n* Based on context clues and original documents dating from the period, it is theorized that 4612-B/Marquez was active during the Hellenic Era, leading another cult called the Many Hands Society.  It is impossible to confirm at this time, but it is likely that the individual called Euboea is the same individual.

He was involved in many classified actions, most of which the Foundation is not aware.  It has been made clear that he took control of an investigation and eventual coverup of the Dyatlov Pass Incident, hiding from public view the anomalous causes of the situation. \n\n* Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Chernoff has become the owner of a growing energy conglomerate, //__Proiskhozhdeniye Investitsii__// – translated as 'Origins Investments' – headquartered in Moscow.
