In Britain, the queen announces an \"eternal empire unshackled by the limits of time and space\". And the US president is defending herself from claims of executive overreach. \n> \n> I'm Thomas Leiberman from NPR News and here are today's top stories.\n\n-----\n\n> The ceasefire negotiated last June between Beijing and the GOC forces established along the border of what once was North Korea ended in gunfire today as a Chinese expeditionary force crossed the demilitarized zone into South Korea. \n> \n> Originally, the force of approximately 16,000 troops was attempting to flee from an unnamed threat inside North Korea's former territory, but as soon as they were detected massing along the border, the GOC forces opened fire. \n> \n> Over 10,000 prisoners were eventually taken, with unknown causalities amongst the Chinese forces. UN forces inside South Korea have begun to mass along the border as well in expectation of the unnamed threat crossing the border, but so far nothing has materialized.\n> \n> Reporting from Chinese state news services has called this an unacceptable escalation and unnecessary provocation. The People's Liberation Army have begun to mobilize troops and ships in the South China Sea. We'll get you updates on this story as it develops.\n\n-----\n\n> In Britain, the queen has made a strange announcement in a public address. Josh Lennier in London has more.\n> \n> \"Today at a surprise speech in the House of Commons, the queen has announced that Britain will form a new \"eternal empire unshackled by the limits of space and time\". Following the speech, the Queen hovered over the House of Commons silently for approximately 4 minutes before landing and leaving with her entourage. \n> \n> What this means exactly has not yet been explained, but a number of news pundits attempting to better understand the speech and its aftermath were vaporized on live television by an unknown power. It is unknown if this is related to the speech or if it is some other anomalous phenomenon.\"\n> \n> The House of Commons was dissolved by the Queen soon after the speech. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's last act before being dissolved onto the floor of the House of Commons was to call for a snap election. There were no other survivors.\n\n-----\n\n> President Clinton is having to defend herself from accusations of executive overreach today after she made recess appointments to the SCP Foundation's governing board. The Foundation has not had an administrative council appointment confirmed by the Senate since 2018, and President Clinton placed Dr. Alto Clef in the most recent open slot. \n> \n> Republican Senate Minority leader Jack Reilly spoke this afternoon in his home state of Washington.\n> \n> \"The president doesn't get to end run around the Senate just because it's inconvenient. The SCP Foundation governing board seats are senate confirmed positions. If the president wants to appoint new members she needs to send us names that aren't tainted by past Foundation criminality. Until that time we will continue to delay these appointments. Thank you.\"\n> \n> White House Spokesperson Anna Leyman said in a written statement \"Dr. Alto Clef is one of the most respected authorities on anomalous science. If the senate would like to reconvene during Chrismas to prevent this recess appointment, they certainly can. Until then, the President is going to ensure that the government remains functioning.\"\n> \n> **This is NPR news.**\n\n-----\n\n> //NPR News is brought to you by a donation from the Marshall Carter and Dark Charitable Trust, The Beryllium Bronze Industries Co-Op, and the support of viewers like you.//\n> \n> In the next hour, more updates on the ongoing conflict in the Korean Peninsula, and are you paying too much for Avocados?
