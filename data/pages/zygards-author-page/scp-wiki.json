He is known to heal the sick just by entering a room, even his enemies have him marked in their contacts as \"emergency number\", he never claims that anything tastes like chicken, not even chicken. He can disarm you with his eyesight, or with his hands, one of the two. He can speak Polish in English. According to some, he discovered the fountain of youth, but did not drink from it because he was not thirsty. When he was stopped by the police in the European Parliament with a pocket knife, he gave police the ticket. Regardless of the temperature, you'll never be able to see his breathing, once he challenged his reflection to a duel of looking without blinking. After 4 days, he won. He is the reason why users cannot give approvals to rewrite articles in SCP-PL, otherwise the Polish branch would outperform the English site quality. The museums allow him to touch the exhibits, he cuts the frogs that are alive and happy to this day. He is the soul of the parties he has never been to, if he punched you in the face you would fight with a powerful desire to thank him. The sharks have a week dedicated to him. As he stepped among the crows, they began to croak like him. When opportunity is knocking and he is not home, opportunity awaits. When asked why he was not a candidate in the presidential election, he stated that it would not be fair to other candidates. He once met Chuck Norris and gave him his autograph. \n\nHe is **the most interesting person in the world**\n[[image http://scp-pl.wdfiles.com/local--files/userinfo-zygard/themostinterestingmanintheworld style=\"width: 99%; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 1px\"]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n+ Objects created by PoI-PL-69\n\n> [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-pl-046 SCP-PL-046 \"Final Girl\"]\n> When he was a victim of Krueger Phenomon, it was he who haunted the murderers, not the other way around\n\n> [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-149 SCP-PL-149 \"The Cinema\"]\n> Movie based on his image won an Academy Award in each category\n\n> [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-259 SCP-PL-259 \"The list of territories conquered by Genghis Khan is incomplete, you can help by expanding it\"]\n> Genghis Khan saw him as an inspiration for his strategies\n\n> [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-289 SCP-PL-289 \"A Multidimensional Solution For Shopping at Biedronka\"]\n> He came to the end of Biedronka and then left.
