As much as we would love to gather food forever, we are limited by the oncoming winter and the risk of predation. Since we can never satisfy our infinite desires, we instead make trade-offs between various aspects of our lives. We limit our time on the ground to stay safe from foxes. We only collect as much as we need for the winter before doing other things. This was the law of nature. At least, before SCP-7472 was discovered.\n\nSCP-7472 is a //Homo sapiens//[[footnote]]{{Characteristics:}} Indirect food provider, not predator, not resource competitor, dog symbiote.[[/footnote]] shelter in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland containing a single //Homo sapiens// (SCP-7472-1). SCP-7472-1 is highly trusting, suggestable, and collection-oriented. Their combined presence is strategically beneficial for the Foundation.\n\nWe have been influencing SCP-7472-1 for several seasons. The Foundation front organization \"Squirrel Containment Pros,\" disguised to SCP-7472-1 as fellow //Homo sapiens//, has proposed an exchange to SCP-7472-1 whose outcomes would be advantageous for both parties involved.[[footnote]] Details restricted to members of Operational Group Alpha-1 (\"Human People\"). [[/footnote]] However, should he at any point fail to abide by the terms outlined in the proposed documents, the exchange would be canceled.\n\nSCP-7472-1 has accepted the offer.\n\nCovert psychological influence of SCP-7472-1 (accomplished by having several of us stand very close together outside of SCP-7472) has resulted in it retrofitting its expansive shelter to contain as many living squirrels as possible. If successful, this will result in a Mulberry-Class \"End of Predation\" scenario and an Oak-Class \"Endless Nuts\" scenario for anyone involved. Surveys of SCP-7472 have noted its exogenous temperature control, suggesting a potential Maple-Class \"Warm Winter\" scenario. If SCP-7472 is sufficiently expanded, the proliferation of habitats without scarcity would ideally result in a Sycamore-Class \"Squirrel-d Peace\" scenario.\n\n[/scp-7472/offset/0 The transfer of staff into SCP-7472, beginning with Foundation high command, is ongoing].\n\n _\n _\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n@@ @@",
