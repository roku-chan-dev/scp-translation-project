No personnel is to come into line-of-sight of SCP-6192-1 without body language and facial expression concealments.\n\nSCP-6192-1 participates once a week in a mental health consultation with a member of the Site Psychology staff, where the subject's mental health status is examined.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6192-1-EX is a female human by the name of Franziska Miranda Neuhaus, who was previously categorised by the SCP Foundation as a person with abnormal characteristics.\n\nMs. F. M. Neuhaus was contained per the original Containment Procedures of [[[SCP-6192]]] before its reclassification.\n\nDue to her high density of mirror neurons[[footnote]]Mirror neurons are neurons that fire both when a subject observes an activity or thought in someone else and when it performs the same activity or thought for itself. This can allow a person to mirror thought patterns with varying accuracy.[[/footnote]], Ms. F. M. Neuhaus has been classified as a Higher Mental Transcommunicator. Higher Mental Transcommunicators are persons with the ability to connect mentally with other life forms in this measure in order to exchange different information. This ability is colloquially called \"[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-121-de telepathy]\". It was confirmed that she possessed at minimum emphatic telepathy upon her original containment.\n\nDue to the \"telepathy\" provided by SCP-6192 being reliant on body language and facial expressions to accurately mirror thought patterns, it has been reclassified as Explained. All related files, including SCP-6192-1-EX, have been reclassified to Explained as well.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[html]]\n\n<style>\n\nhr.style14 {\n\n  width: 600px;\n\n  border: 0;\n\n  height: 1px;\n\n  background-image: -webkit-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n  background-image: -moz-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n  background-image: -ms-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n  background-image: -o-linear-gradient(left, transparent, #8c8b8b, transparent);\n\n}\n\n</style>\n\n<hr class=\"style14\" align=\"center\">\n\n[[/html]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"⬣ Open Excerpt from an Interview with SCP-6192-1-EX ⬣\" hide=\"⬡ Close ⬡\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"padding:14px; margin-bottom: 2px; border-radius: 8px; border: solid 2px #000;\"]]\n[[==]]\n**Interviewed:** SCP-6192-1-EX; contained anomaly\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Richter, Head Researcher for SCP-6192-1-EX\n\n------\n\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**Dr. Richter:** Good evening, Ms. Neuhaus.\n\n**SCP-6192-1-EX:** Good evening.\n\n**Dr. Richter:** I would like to ask you a handful of questions.

Make every test as if she just was contained and compare it to whatever old material we can find.\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** What would this entail?\n\n**Dr. Richter:** From Ms. Neuhaus' file, a brain scan to confirm mirror neuron density and the activity that originally alerted the Foundation of SCP-6192 behaviour.\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** ...There was no telepathy test?\n\n**Dr. Richter:** Yes. Although to be fair, the Higher Mental Transcommunicator protocols didn't exist then as they do now.\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** That's no excuse. It should have been rectified as soon as the protocol was invented.\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** You'll see this a lot when dealing with older skips. Containment Procedures are followed to the letter until no one knows their original intent. Until nobody's left who cares for necessary updates.\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Well, we can rectify that now. So we need a brain scan and a telepathy test.\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** Is the brain scan really necessary?\n\n**Dr. Vasquez:** Well, it doesn't hurt. And it's better to be on the safer side with evaluations.\n\n**Dr. Hewlett:** Right.\n\n**Dr. Richter:** I can conduct the scan and the test.
