A core team of a dedicated few, they are always willing to collaborate with new artists, take risks, and push the limits of what 'theatre' can be.\n\nWhether it's a stage show, an experience, an installation, or something weirder -- if you are trying to make a difference in the world, Pseudogenesis Productions is right for you!\n\n-----\n+ About Us:\nPseudogenesis Productions is an anart theatre company, focused on creating immersive and innovative theatrical productions through the use of memetic and ontological anomalies. In sharp contrast to AWCY and other anart groups, Pseudogenesis Productions focuses on safe and discreet performances, immersive experiences, and the like, ensuring that any willing participant is able to experience something otherworldly, without any lasting damage to themselves.\n\nPseudogenesis Productions believes that change can be accomplished through helping other people understand more about the human experience. We do __not__ collaborate with larger organizations or corporations; we are about the community, and we refuse to compromise our message or morals. We are happy to collaborate with individual artists, grass-roots local businesses, in an effort to best benefit our communities.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab This Season's Shows]]\n[[=]]\n+ Special Performances\n++ (GOI Format)\n-----\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[Self-Expression Collection]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ Main Stage\n++ (SCPs)\n-----\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-8478|SENSE: A Pseudogenesis Production]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-8740|The Secret Project: A Pseudogenesis Production]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-8686|Best Days Of Our Lives: A Pseudogenesis Production]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user DoctorLilithSophia]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-821|Dixie Fun Faire]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]] and [[*user Uncle Nicolini]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-7748|The Quiet Room: A Pseudogenesis Production]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-8184|Backpedal: A Pseudogenesis Production]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user winkwonkboi]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ Side Stage\n++ (Tales)\n-----\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[Recomposition]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user DrBleep]], [[*user Queerious]], [[*user Dexanote]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[Dissonance]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user DrBleep]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[Pseudoguilt]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/whos-afraid-of-a-red-starfish-en-blues Who’s Afraid Of A Red Starfish En Blues?]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user xexnoncores]]\n[[/div]]\n\n+ Affiliated Acts\n-----\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\"]]\n++ [[[SCP-7238|The Critic]]]\n-----\n+++ Directed By: [[*user Queerious]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Dramatis Personae]]\n[[=]]\n+ Meet The Team\n[[/=]]\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\" style=\"padding-left: 1em;\"]]\n+ Stephanie Pseudo | She/Her\n++ Creative Director and Founder\n-----\n[[<]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=Stephanie_1.jpg|caption=content|width=50%|align=right]]\nThe mysterious creative director and founder of Pseudogenesis Productions, little is known about who they actually are.

She sets the full outline for many performances, and seem to be a major creative influence in every piece they create. She is present for every performance from the core team, having never missed one -- even if she's using a proxy.\n\nShe wants to thank the rest of Pseudogenesis for trusting in her to lead the way.\n-----\n= //To my sweet daughter Grace, I only wish that you could be here to see the show.//\n[[/<]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"queerbox_large\" style=\"padding-right: 1em;\"]]\n+ Vivienne Chen | She/Her\n++ Memetics and Cognitohazards Designer\n-----\n[[>]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=VivienneChen_0.jpg|caption=content|width=50%|align=left]]\nVivienne Chen is the resident master of memetics, specializing in creating cognitohazards that create unique, detailed and isolated experiences for Pseudogenesis Productions. She believes that memetics allow for untold levels of shared understanding within theatre. Vivienne is the only member of Pseudogenesis to ever attend production locations in person, but has never been successfully, continually, held by the Foundation.\n\nVivienne would like to specifically __not__ thank the Foundation, as they are a bunch of idiots playing doctor, including her mother.\n-----\n= //The thing about having two moms is that the odds of one of them sucking goes way up.

They saw what AWCY? could do, and refused recruitment to become The Critic, a choice that they stand by every single day of their life. Duplo's real face is unknown, if they even have one; they can always be found controlling the blank mannequins that run around the theatre and take care of odd jobs. They are the master craftsperson, having shaped the very sets that you see before you.\n\nDuplo would like to thank every member of Pseudogenesis, and each artist they have worked with; it is a delight to work with others who believe that true art causes change, without violence.\n-----\n= //Art is meant for the people, not for the elites.

That's great! The GOI is fully open for anybody to contribute SCPs and Tales, with a GOI format coming really soon!\n\nPseudogenesis Productions stages a large variety of performances, however, any production by them shares a few key details:\n\nPseudogenesis focuses on the use of memetics and hermeneutics to create anomalous effects. While the use of ontokinetics is present in many performances, it is typically only used in the creation and manipulation of the spaces, rather than during the performances.\n\nAll attendees, performers and participants of a Pseudogenesis show are willing, and capable of stopping their experiences at any time. They refuse to force anybody to act against their will; knowing that true change only comes when somebody is ready.\n\nPerformances staged by Pseudogenesis typically involve themes of: agency and inaction, reliving uncommon experiences, understanding others through immersion into their lives, and the undercurrent fear of violence throughout the anomalous world, and within marginalized communities. Pseudogenesis focuses on giving a voice to the voiceless, and a stage to the forgotten.\n\n-----\n\nThe main four Pseudogenesis members are always involved with a performance in some way; even if just in the creation, they touch everything with their name on it. They frequently collaborate with independent artists, and do their best to raise up the voices of those around them.\n\nWhen writing a Pseudogenesis piece, the main thing to consider is //why.// What is the message behind what they created? What are they trying to accomplish? Who are they trying to help? As long as you remember this key detail, the sky is the limit for performances.\n\nIf you have any other questions, feel free to reach out to [[*user Queerious]], the creator of Pseudogenesis!\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Stage Tech]]\n\nPseudogenesis utilizes a number of shared technical or CSS component.
