This includes gambling of any kind, draws, sports events, casinos, and excessive warfare.\n\nA worldwide stipulation is to be made, instructing elderly civilians over the age of 65 to maintain a secondary individual nearby, in case of emergency.\n\nPublic events with an area smaller than 300^^2^^M may have a maximum occupancy of no higher than 70 individuals. Events with differing units are to work off of this metric.\n\nThere is to be a maximum occupancy of 35 passengers aboard any and all aerocrafts, and 80 aboard sea-faring vessels. Additionally, no aircraft may carry cargo exceeding 200KG and ships 820KG.

The exact mechanics of how this process occurs is unknown.\n\nSince its discovery, there has been a major rise in diagnoses of various life-threatening illnesses, accidents of any nature occurring, newborn children found to have various handicaps, malfunctions within architecture, electronics, and other systems, and the general global death toll. \n\nTypical instances of SCP-7101 may be observed as:\n* An individual being located in an environment that, at the current time, is more hazardous than it is regularly;\n* A higher concentration of subjects experiencing a hazardous scenario that usually results in injury, damage, or termination;\n* Hazardous events, such as fires, earthquakes, or gas leaks occurring near individuals with disabling handicaps;\n* Sudden development of natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, tornados, droughts, or floods;\n* Personnel that are usually well trained and or equipped make increased numbers of mistakes.\n\nRecorded instances of this include:\n\n* The individual known as O5-04 had entered an alleyway, only to get killed due to a botched robbery.\n* A pipe within Site-17 burst within Server Room-4, resulting in mass flooding of the room, 3 other server rooms, and the loss of 04.082% of Foundation records, including all files previously associated with SCP-7101.\n* A 6.4 scale earthquake occurred within Reliquary Site-27, which heavily damaged several sections of the facility, including the cafeteria, dormitories, and infirmary. 19 personnel were killed during this, including Director Kaleb Tennanbaum, head of the Department of Applied Theology, who was being treated there for a previous injury that was believed to be caused by an effect of SCP-7101.\n* The complete annihilation of the newly reformed [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-03 State of Hy-Brasil], caused by earthquakes, fires, poor weather conditions, and ill-appropriate trade options.\n* See incident report: 7/004.\n* The failed termination of SCP-7101, resulted in the deaths of Director Pendant Roufhous, the previous head of the SCP-7101 project, and an unknown number of individuals. //[SEE INCIDENT REPORT:7/074]//\n\nSCP-7101-1 is a humanoid female entity. Details about it or its relation to SCP-7101 are unknown.\n\nSCP-7101-A is a specially modified ABSRDeI device. It was purported as being able to locate SCP-7101, though how this was achieved is unknown. It is currently deactivated and inoperable.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #999999; background:#8a8454; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n------\n**Incident Report: 7/074--15/11/2039F:**\n------\nFootage recovered from a camera attached to a tree in a forest outside Area-55.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n= //Camera begins recording. In front of it is Director Roufhous. Their hand is removed from the camera, revealing them to be in a forested area, with a device appearing to be a modified ABSRDeI. Various runes are depicted upon the ground, circling the device//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** We're rolling. Alright, well, good day, viewer. I'm Pendant Roufhous, overseeing this termination attempt on SCP-7101. I have not told anyone about this; but if nothing really happens, well I'll just destroy this footage and move on.\n\n= //Director Roufhous moves out of view before returning with a document//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** So, I started thinking about Fortuna or Tyche, and thought about their relation to 7101. They were their respective culture's personifications of Luck, and we were able to locate, identify, terminate, or contain both of them. So why not 7101?\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I've been having Researchers Pepper and Fallen have another look at how we were able to trace Fortuna and found that her actions would leave something behind. Sorta like 7101?\n\n= //Director Roufhous begins interacting with the device//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** So,  technobabble aside-\n\n//Director Roufhous looks at the camera//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I found a way to locate SCP-7101.\n\n= //Director Roufhous begins removing several objects from their coat, before arranging them in a pattern around the device//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** This might be a little bit much, but I haven't really tried this before, so let's hope for the best! Or, good luck, I suppose.\n\n= //Director Roufhous removes a phone from their coat pocket, before calling, what is believed to be, Director Kaleb Tennanbaum. They begin chatting, though the conversation takes place outside of microphone reach. After hanging up, they approach the machine and activate it. They take a step back as it begins making several sounds, before turning to the attached screen//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I think... it's uh, working. \n\n= //The noises emitted from the machine begin slowing and quieting down. Director Roufhous looks at the screen, before looking at two different documents. They turn and approach the camera//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Didn't work.\n\n= //Director Roufhous tries to turn the camera off, before hearing a noise from the device. They return to it//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** The fuck?\n\n= //Director Roufhous looks to the camera//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Oh. Uh, before it gave me the coordinates to Tyche, but now they're giving me the coordinates to... the Atlantic sea, Australia, and Germany?\n\n= //The device repeats the previous noise//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** New coordinates. (Pauses) To Texas... Croatia... Sweden... and Pakistan?\n\n= //The machine begins rapidly repeating the previous noises//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Ohh, what the hell?\n\n= //The machine stops, displaying the coordinates listed below//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** ██████████, 8 - L ██████, ████████[[footnote]] The exact coordinates of Area-55. Censored for security purposes.[[/footnote]]?\n\n= //The machine makes another noise.

Roufhous:** Hello?\n\n= //SCP-7101-1 stares directly at Director Roufhous, unmoving//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Mate, you can't be here. This is government property; I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\n\n= //SCP-7101-1 remains motionless//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** This is your last warning. Leave, now.\n\n= //SCP-7101-1 does not respond. Director Roufhous begins approaching it, before SCP-7101-A makes another noise behind them. They turn to view the panel, as a second set of coordinates, exactly identical to the previously noted coordinates, appear on the screen//\n\n= //Director Roufhous then turns back to SCP-7101-1, now seeing two instances where there once was one//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** What the fuck?\n\n= //SCP-7101-A sounds off twice more before Director Roufhous can turn to view it. They turn back to 4 SCP-7101-1 instances.//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Do you mind not duplicating?\n\n**SCP-7101-1-1:** Carlos Santiago.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** What?\n\n= //The instance becomes silent once more. The device beeps//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** I'm not looking at it.\n\n= //The machine beeps again. Director Roufhous pulls their phone out, requesting assistance from Area-55 staff. Just before they can say where they are, the phone dies, just as SCP-7101-A sends out another alert//  \n\n= //A rabbit is seen moving in the background. SCP-7101-A beeps again. A branch from a tree above the rabbit breaks and falls upon it, presumably killing it. Director Roufhous turns in reaction, before looking back at 8 SCP-7101-1 instances//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** That's a tad bit alarming.\n\n**SCP-7101-1-6:** Kurt Alexander.\n\n= //SCP-7101-A alerts//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Is that your name? And what about your buddies, here? Have they all got names?\n\n**SCP-7101-1-4:** Peter Davidson.\n\n= //SCP-7101-A alerts//\n\n**Dir.

Roufhous:** What is going on here?\n\n**SCP-7101-1-2:** Angus O'Brien.\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** Alright.\n\n= //Director Roufhous removes a revolver from their sleeve//\n\n**Dir. Roufhous:** All of you are coming with me.\n\n**SCP-7101-1-5:** Charles Vemhoff.\n\n**SCP-7101-1-8:** Christian Kennedy.\n\n**SCP-7101-1-2:** Hugo Sanchez.\n\n= //SCP-7101-A alerts after every comment made by SCP-7101-1 instances//\n\n**Dir.
