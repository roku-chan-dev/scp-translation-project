This red hue is discernible in all phases and serves as the most expedient method of identifying contaminated matter before its anomalous properties manifest. In contrast to mundane water, SCP-009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.[[/size]]||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-409: Contagious Crystal\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n||||= [[image http://scpkosb.wdfiles.com/local--files/draft:asdf142857-30-d018/20220610_183556.jpg]]||\n||||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-409 Item Number: SCP-409]||\n||= **Alias**||= Contagious Crystal||\n||= [[span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"]]**Object Class**[[/span]]||= Keter||\n||||= [[size 100%]]SCP-409 resembles a large quartz crystal approximately 1.5m (5ft) tall and 0.6m (2ft) wide. Any objects coming in contact with SCP-409 will begin to crystallize after three hours. This effect will occur in any material other than granite. The crystallization will spread by approximately 2.5cm (1in) per minute, and will convert the entire object or organism, inside and out. Subjects report this effect to be extremely painful, and similar to frostbite. After complete crystallization, the object will begin to make snapping and creaking noises for approximately twenty minutes, before bursting into thousands of fragments with great force.||\n\n[[/size]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-714: The Jaded Ring\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n||||= [[image http://scpkosb.wdfiles.com/local--files/draft:asdf142857-30-d018/20220610_183657.jpg]]||\n||||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-714 Item Number: SCP-714]||\n||= **Alias**||= The Jaded Ring||\n||= [[span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"]]**Object Class**[[/span]]||= Safe||\n||||= [[size 100%]]Seemingly nothing more than a green jade ring, wearers of SCP-714 reported feeling very physically and mentally exhausted within minutes of wearing SCP-714. Due to this, they will feel driven to \"sit down and rest for a bit\" on the nearest available furniture, and will likely fall asleep within the space of a few hours. Wearers of SCP-714 show abnormally high resilience to memetic and mental influences, particularly commands or immediate effects.[[/size]]||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-178: \"3-D\" Specs\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n||||= [[image http://scpkosb.wdfiles.com/local--files/draft:asdf142857-30-d018/20220630_203833.jpg]]||\n||||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-178 Item Number: SCP-178]||\n||= **Alias**||= \"3-D\" Specs||\n||= [[span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"]]**Object Class**[[/span]]||= Euclid||\n||||= [[size 100%]]SCP-178 is a pair of white stereoscopic (“3-D”) glasses with a rectangular white cardboard frame and lenses of transparent blue and red (left and right lenses, respectively) plastic. The item exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from a slight discoloration of the cardboard consistent with age. When worn, the wearer begins perceiving large bipedal entities in addition to its ordinary surroundings. Entities reportedly exhibit a docile and occasionally curious behavior, with one exception. Attempts to interact with these entities will immediately result in severe lacerations in the personnel involved. The laceration pattern was always consistent with three parallel, slender-tipped cuts between 14.2 and 27.4 cm in length and 2.9 to 8.1 cm in width. Recording and measuring devices used during testing failed to detect any anomalies, including while lacerations were appearing on the subject. Subjects do not report hearing any sounds emanating from the entities.[[/size]]||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[collapsible show=\"SCP-500: Panacea\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n||||= [[image http://scpkosb.wdfiles.com/local--files/draft:asdf142857-30-d018/20220630_203849.jpg]]||\n||||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-500 Item Number: SCP-500]||\n||= **Alias**||= Panacea||\n||= [[span style=\"white-space:nowrap;\"]]**Object Class**[[/span]]||= Safe||\n||||= [[size 100%]]SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains 47 red pills. One pill, when taken orally, effectively cures the subject of all diseases within two hours, exact time depending on the severity and amount of the subject's conditions.[[/size]]||\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[!-- 각주를 댓글 위에 표시하기 위한 구문입니다. 지우지 마시고 초안은 이 위에 쓰세요.  --]",
