As a forum critter, I often spot several drafts which try to shoehorn Groups of Interest into their articles with little rhyme or reason. Even worse, sometimes they try to write an article heavily featuring the group without really knowing anything about it! GoIs are cool, don't get me wrong. I love mixing and matching groups of interest in my articles, but to do so requires both a level of understanding of what a specific GoI represents, and what they can bring to the table from a narrative standpoint.\n\nIn this essay, I, alongside several other authors well-versed on the matter, will be offering up advice on what kind of voice, tone, and themes an article featuring a specific GoI should aim for. Keep in mind **this is not a bible or definitive guide by any means, and there is always room for exploration and deconstruction. This essay is more of a crash course and meant to provide easy to digest information not present in most GoI hubs,** alongside recommended reading for those interested in reading about a GoI or learning the basic gist of what a group stands for. I hope this helps you whether you are a reader, critter, or author.\n\n[[size 150%]]NOTICE TO ANY INDIVIDUALS INTERESTED IN CONTRIBUTING[[/size]]\nIf you possess in-depth knowledge of a particular GoI and want to touch on something that was missed out on here, please PM me. **Do not add blurbs on here**. Additionally, if a new major GoI pops up or one of the minor ones becomes a major one, this essay will be updated. If enough time goes by since the GoI has risen to provenance and I have not updated this, please poke me with a stick. \n\n[[toc]]\n\n-----\n[[# Add1]]\n+ Alexylva University\n[[=]]\n[[image alexylva-university.png style=\"width:25%;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Writing Advice\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nUncle Nicolini's Advice\n> Alexylva is a weird group of interest, and possibly the only one that the Foundation cannot interact with directly in any capacity. Alexylva University is, as the name implies, a university from a divergent timeline in which Carthage was not razed by Rome, and where Greco-Roman culture reigns supreme. They are very technologically advanced but some very simple things (such as the lower case and Arabic numerals) were never invented or universally adopted. \n> \n> Not an awful lot is known of Alexylva, but that means you have more room to play around in. The only rules (if they can even be referred to as such) when writing about Alexylva are as follows: Any objects found relating to Alexylva are only there by accident, they are related to Greco-Roman culture, and should function or operate in a retro-futuristic' fashion. Picture trying to imagine what the future would look like while living in the first century AD. Would slaves be automated by some magic technology? Would chariot jousts be more high-stakes?

That's not to say they don't appear elsewhere, however, in fact quite a lot of their restaurants are found in normal reality, though their options are a little more restricted there.

At the end of the day, they've got to turn a profit somehow. Other than that, and just as important as the characters and the stories they tell, is the food. You cannot forget the food. If someone's reading Ambrose, they don't want exactly what they could get with any other group, they want to see the chefs, the waiters, and most of all the bizarre dishes that one can find in any of their establishments. As far as characterization goes, you should be cautious to remember that the leadership is far more moral than that of many other GoI's. That's not to say that everyone in their employ is a pillar of justice, but for the most part, they won't do harm if it can be avoided, and Chaz is certain to veto using a human in a dish.

Based in the Pacific Northwest and to a larger degree Three Portlands. The company is headed by Vincent Anderson, a skilled thaumaturge, and manipulator, and persists through a combination of espionage, supply deals with such groups as Marshall, Carter, and Dark, and simply existing out of the Foundation's range.\n> \n> Writing Anderson Robotics pieces is a great way of exploring classical Science Fiction themes, with a thaumatological twist. Most of their products disguise their anomalous features as the product of advanced but mundane engineering—using an artificial soul to emulate human-like AI, and so on. Is it ethical to create an artificial soul to power a machine of labor if the alternative was that such a being never existed in the first place? What are the dilemmas in creating artificial intelligence to use in place of a human soul for a demonic sacrifice? What happens when your technology masters the very power you used to create it? These are the types of questions often tied up in the group that should be explored, if not necessarily answered, when you write.\n> \n> Additionally, a huge part of the draw for Anderson Robotics is the characters. Since the company is a small group with only a few hundred people working for them, one can explore the dynamics of the workplace. Entire tale series have been created focusing on how Vincent Anderson runs his company and emotionally manipulates his workers to fulfill an internal desire to be seen as a hero and visionary. Tales have also been written that focus on the interplay between human employees and the numerous androids in the company's staff. With a Three Portlands serving as a well-established backdrop, you can really dive deep into the lives of the programmers, machinists, sales reps, and android security agents that make the company tick.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About Anderson Robotics\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> Return signal terminated.

AWCY? is a movement, more than anything else, of making anart acceptable, or \"cool\", in popular culture. While AWCY? is unified under that one goal, there are numerous factions and splinters in AWCY? This is somewhat fixed by the Critic system, but this only causes more problems.\n> \n> AWCY? articles should say something about the struggle of an artist against something. Whether it be the Critic, social norms, lack of supplies, whatever. There should be something that an artist is fighting against and an artist is fighting for. Having a spooky painting with \"Are We Cool Yet?\" written on it will not fly.\n\nUncle Nicolini's Advice\n\n> AWCY? is very much about thinking outside the conventional norm, and this extends into the mediums anartists (anart: ana= anomalous art= artists) use to create. Performances, songs, sculptures, interpretive dance, nothing is off the table so long as it is punctuated with a flair of the anomalous. Don't be afraid to explore something new in your article, art is about breaking boundaries and exploring new mediums.\n> \n> But the most important thing about an AWCY? piece is that they are always about something, [[[scp-3435|even when they're about nothing.]]] Every piece has a purpose; whether we, the in-universe audience or even the anartists themselves get it is up to you. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About AWCY?\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> What is Life? what is Art? what is god?

They congregate in the Wanderer's Library and share close relations with the Serpent's Hand, and in some instances are even the leaders of the organization. \n> \n> Black Queen articles typically involve the pursuit of knowledge through multiversal collaboration. The Queens (who refer to one another as 'Sisters') aim to collect as many anomalous objects across the various universes and timelines which may help them in their pursuits, whatever they may be.

This version of the CI is typically used as cannon fodder to be mowed down or as a catch-all, unquestionably evil puppy-kicking villain. Very simple and effective when in need of a generic villain, but not very interesting.\n> \n> The second depicts the Insurgency as a sort of Black Ops MTF which operate on behalf of the Foundation when their hands are tied and cannot do something on the books. This depiction is much more morally grey and typically would depict the internal dilemma of one having to do what may be a highly immoral or villainous act, but one that would no doubt end up benefiting the world overall.\n> \n> Finally, we have the Moral Insurgency, which are Foundation defectors members who seek to protect the world while not making morally grey compromises and have a very pragmatic approach to dealing with problems. Whereas the Foundation would keep an anomaly alive even if it were in great pain, this Insurgency would put it out of its misery. An article featuring this Insurgency would likely be seen as monsters by the outside world and the Foundation, but is operated by people who firmly believe they are doing what they must while causing as little pain as possible. \n\nLazar's advice\n\n> The Chaos Insurgency is probably one of the oldest extant GOIs, and it shows. As unclenicolini has discussed, interpretations of the CI vary widely from author to author, or even year to year.  \n> \n> A classic mistake many a new author makes regarding the CI is not understanding who they are and what they want. The CI has been so thoroughly abused as a simple, kick-the-dog unjustified Foundation antagonist that it's pretty much a discredited trope at this point, despite likely being developed for this purpose. Playing this straight in a non-humorous context is going to lead to eye-rolls and likely downvotes.\n> \n> That's not to say the CI as an antagonist to the Foundation, or as a GOI itself, is dead or discredited. It's merely important to understand what their motivations are. MC&D and Prometheus Labs pursued profit - CotBG and Sarkicists pursue their own, specific religious ends. What the CI wants is decidedly less clear, and certainly not as unified as those described above.\n> \n> The unifying factor in all CI interpretations is that the CI is an alternative Foundation - they are organized along similar lines, have similar skills, and generally evenly matched. What causes them to differ is likely little more than a razor's edge. Less stringent ethics committee, perhaps a bit looser in testing? Or perhaps less of a focus on containment and more of an interest in utilizing those anomalies for personal benefit? Both of these are entirely valid interpretations, as are dozens more like them.\n> \n> The CI is an extremely flexible GOI to work with. Treating them as 'only' an unjustified Foundation antagonist is a missed opportunity. \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About the CI\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> Oh, the name?

Much like cyberpunk fiction, the central connecting theme of all versions of the Chicago Spirit is \"high tech, low life\". Fantastic people use incredible means for decidedly mundane ends: it's a GOI that uses submachine guns against magicians and summons demons to help rob banks. At the same time, do not confuse the Chicago Spirit with Marshall, Carter, and Dark. MC&D represent the peak of late-stage capitalism -  the members of the Chicago Spirit are perpetually hungry, operating at street-level and interacting with the common people. \n> \n> When writing for the Pre-1933 Chicago Spirit, you want to consider the culture and context of early 20th century America: World War 1, the Great Depression, Prohibition, film noir, Al Capone, etc. are all events, people, and themes that could play a role in this era's Chicago Spirit. Think of the celebrity worship and romanticism surrounding 1930s gangster culture and use that in your work. The most defining article to represent this era would be the tale \"Hartliss Detective Agency\". The Pre-1990 Chicago Spirit is much more freeform. Really, the only rule when writing in this time period is that there IS no Chicago Spirit - at least not any recognized one. The most defining article for this era would be the tale \"Zeitgeist\".  The Post-1990 Chicago Spirit draws on elements of postmodern literature and culture. It's more playful and more cynical than the prior eras, incorporating stylistic elements of comic books, anime, and music, and blending them with themes from neo-noir, cyberpunk, and urban fantasy fiction. The most defining article for this era would be the tale \"Hypervelocity\".\n\n\nRounderhouse's Advice\n\n> The Chicago Spirit are (in-universe) the first Group of Interest catalogued by the Foundation. They were a gang from Chicago that made their name using anomalous technologies to supplement their strength, and grew massive during the Prohibition. They were primarily operated by one Richard Chappell, said to be a reality-bender (Though a popular interpretation says that Chappell was a non-anomalous human, and all reality-bending was done by his mysterious partner-in-crime.). Anyway, the Chicago Spirit rapidly fell in power and collapsed a few years after Prohibition ended.\n>  \n> The Chicago Spirit's aesthetic, tone, and style is deeply rooted in Prohibition-era American culture. With the absence of the Prohibition, the Spirit was rapidly on its way out. Remember that when writing for them. Everything they do is influenced by the viewpoints and technologies of 20s America. When writing for them, consider what an individual from back then's thoughts would be on the matter. Even their language is dated back to that era.\n> \n> A constant theme for the Spirit is greed. They're willing to commit crimes for profit, there's no doubt about that, but they won't go out of their way to bring harm upon someone who doesn't threaten them without a good reason. The reason is usually money. They're also greedy for more power. Expansion is //very// important to the Spirit, because they know if they make themselves brittle, the UIU (which was a much more real threat back then) and the Foundation could destroy them. The Spirit was a powerful player in the anomalous underworld, but even then, the legitimate organizations were far more powerful than them.\n> \n> //Capiche?//\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About the Spirit\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> When folks ask where I studied, I just laugh at them.

Even with all but one of their gods dead, they strive to keep Rakmou-leusan alive, constantly working to spread their beliefs and aid in the fight against the Voruteut.

The group was intended from the start to be an inversion on blood cults (being pacifistic instead of violent and having a justified reason for blood rites beyond \"BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD\") and, while there is nothing wrong with writing other Ortothan groups as despicable (alien Ortothans are bound to have different morals than humans, for instance), the Church and the majority of Ortothan groups will not act that way.

Despite any shady under-goings within Wondertainment, no one in the company wants to actively hurt or emotionally damage children. As such, any malfunctions with Wondertainment products are wholly unintentional and are likely the result of an accidental oversight or pushing the product to its limits.  Wondertainment products are also inherently over-the-top and wacky, much like if a child designed them. \n> \n> If you're going to write a Wondertainment product as an article, you'll have to keep in mind that Wondertainment only makes mistakes, never directly seeks harm, and Wondertainment will try a variety of different products, from games to food to toys to amusement parks, to keep kids not only engaged in play but also to keep them wondering. That being said, never be afraid to veer into sad, scary, or other subject matter that doesn't fit into the innocent facade.

It's like a monster manifested as an industrial hell. It doesn't just overwork its employees, it consumes them, and it mass produces objects not out of customer satisfaction but out of pure capitalistic need. As such, most Factory products are rough around the edges, have horrifying effects, and are generally cold and distant like a manager looking over his thousands of of workers.\n> \n> There's little to no hope for those in the Factory. Once you're in, you never get out. That great turmoil, that horrendous fate, should come across when you're writing a Factory item. You should think not only \"Why did they make this?\" but also \"Who is this for?\" Factory items are made from the worst of humanity and should bring out the worst in humanity. The horror of rust and industrial dystopia is what should come across in your article.\n\nUraniumempire's Advice\n\n> A good thing to remember about the Factory: it does not care.\n> \n> That's not to say they're not driven. The Factory does what it does with a (quite literally) inhuman drive, and most probably wants to keep doing what they're doing for as long as time allows. Indeed, the Factory is often associated with the cutthroat robber baron \"pioneers\" of the industrial revolution, and operates much like 19th-century factories were wont to do. But outside of consuming the world and regurgitating products, it simply does not care.\n> \n> The consumption/production cycle of the Factory is not a means to some mundane end, like improving humanity or even just making money; it is what the Factory //wants// to do. The Factory will eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat and eat until it can eat no more, converting raw material and humanity into things to be consumed. In turn, these products will allow the Factory more food, and it will continue chomping at reality like an industrial cancer. Only three things exist to the Factory: consumers, the consumed, and the Factory itself, and even the line between \"consumer\" and \"consumed\" will eventually blur.\n> \n> When the sun goes cold and Earth goes lifeless, the Factory will consume the ground beneath itself. When the last being in the universe hangs itself upon a dead tree, the Factory will cannibalize its lifeless corpse for raw materials. When the last star dies, the last planet crumbles, the last cosmic cloud disperses, when the last bit of warmth is devoured by entropy, when at last some deific being comes across an empty existential space to make the universe anew, the Factory will be there, waiting for seconds.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About The Factory\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> Survivors claim the floor was engraved with arcane symbols, that were only visible when blood flowed across them… But then again the survivors claimed a lot of things.\n- [[[scp-001-o5|Bright's Proposal]]]\n\n> Staff reminder: Elder Foremen dislike their existence being acknowledged.

They don't give a shit about morality or anything, just destroying every last trace of the paranormal.

This is the GOC you tend to see in a lot of earlier works, as well as works that don't greatly feature them. They tend to be a rather shallow version.\n> \n> The second is what happens when writers realize they said the GOC was a **UN** organization and think \"Maybe having a UN group that commits war crimes on a daily basis doesn't make sense.\" This is a GOC that acknowledges the paranormal, has paranormal members, and is less violent overall to it. Yes, they still tend to the liquidation of the hostile parathreat, but they don't care so much about benign. This GOC tends to exist in worlds where the paranormal is common enough that they're still busy just focusing on the overtly dangerous.

Unlike the other national paranormal organizations of their time, GRU-P did not worry themselves with policing the paranormal or militarizing it. Instead, they turned the anomalous into weapons and tools for espionage. They are cold, calculating, efficient, and never show their full hand. Whereas the GOC would charge in guns blazing, GRU-P would observe from a distance and investigate before performing a strike with surgical precision. Knowledge is power, and GRU-P knows a lot.\n> \n> Their decline was a slow and steady one, which turned into a tailspin following the Soviet economic crisis of the early 80's. Within ten years, the Soviet Union collapsed, and GRU-P along with them. Many of their resources, facilities, and personnel fell into GOC and Foundation control. Like IJAMEA, there may still be some holdouts hiding in the Siberian wilderness or somewhere in plain sight, their numbers are small and continue to dwindle.\n> \n> GRU-P lend themselves well to espionage thrillers, nightmarish science experiments, bizarre documents, and themes of structural decay.

They worked closely with national governments, as a sort of paranormal defense contractor and by the middle of the 20th century, were a major force in their own right. At their peak, PL was a globe-spanning conglomerate that had its fingers in just about everything imaginable, imagine, like, General Electric and Boeing combined. While they were still huge suppliers of paratech to normalcy organizations, they also had a consumer market at that point. You'd buy a Prometheus microwave and never even know that it was powered by ghosts.\n> \n> They were able to get away with this because they were, essentially too big to fail.\n> But then the cold war ended, the demand for paratech dropped, and some bad financial decisions meant that they failed anyway. This didn't happen overnight, it was much more like a normal corporate breakup. The parent company was dissolved, and its subsidiaries and assets sold off. Some of them became independent companies still operating in the paratech market, some of them were bought out by rivals or normalcy orgs, and some of them just stopped doing business. The upshot of all that is that, while PLabs proper is defunct, there's a lot of PL still operating, just under different names like Titan Consumer Appliances and Electronics. There's no definitive list of PL-successor companies, and there's a lot of room for new ones to pop up.\n> \n> Thematically, the big thing with PL is reenacting the Prometheus myth. their whole goal was to steal the anomalous fire and figured out how to use it to benefit mankind. In their later years, this would be somewhat lessened by the inevitable consequences of being a for-profit corporation and globe-spanning conglomerate, but the core tenet of PL was always, from the beginning, trying to use the paranormal for the benefit of mankind, and hey, maybe make a quick buck or two off of it.\n> \n> The other thing is that they were //good at it//. Yeah, they eventually got burned, but for a full century, PL was on the cutting edge of parascience. They took risks, and sometimes that backfired, but a lot of the time it paid off. One of the tropes of old school PL was \"lol, they screwed up because they were dumb\", b/c it was popular to give GOIs the idiot ball back then to make the Foundation look competent, but for modern PL, if they fail, it's not because they screwed up, but because they were unlucky, or sabotaged, or whatever.

At first glance, they resemble “flesh worshipers” due to their fixation with the body and corporeal augmentation. In truth, the flesh is but a means to an end. They regard organic matter as the corrupt tool of malevolent alien gods but one that can be used by mortals to rival the power of these cosmic horrors. Sarkicism comes from the traditions of the Grand Karcist Ion, its long-vanished prophet and founder. \n> \n> The religion began with the noble goal of liberating and uniting humanity – and bringing an end to the gods. Since the fall of their civilization, the faith has degenerated into these various cults. Some still hold to some semblance of morality but most have twisted these traditions in the name of fanatical devotion or selfish ambition. Though there exist many Sarkic cults, most can be divided into Proto-Sarkic and Neo-Sarkic.\n> \n> \n> Proto-Sarkites are commonly depicted as isolationist, preferring a rustic lifestyle outside of modern civilization (though this is not always the case). These cults take many influences from European Paganism and Siberian shamanism and have close ties to the land. They value hardship, self-sacrifice, and collectivism. Their approach to the Sarkic faith is prone to fundamentalism and their use of anomalies makes them a threat to the Foundation's goal of normalcy. They revere Ion and his Klavigar (Nadox, Saarn, Orok, and Lovataar; basically akin to apostles), celebrating them on holy days and making sacrifices in their name. They regard Ion as a messianic figure but are divided on his current state, with some regarding him as having transcended to godhood and others believing he had sacrificed himself for the good of humanity. \n> \n> Neo-Sarkites are cosmopolitan, affluent, and lack the superstitions associated with Proto-Sarkites. It is better to think of them as occult organizations, rather than true religions. They worship only power, ignoring much of the doctrine and mythology of the original faith. Though they descend from the same tradition and exploit the same anomalies, they are in many ways the antithesis of Sarkicism. They value ambition and selfish desire, willing to sacrifice the many for the benefit of the few; they see the world through a social-Darwinist lens, merging fleshcrafting and eugenics with terrifying results. The first Neo-Sarkites descend from European nobles who learned of Sarkicism through Proto-Sarkites kept as court-sorcerers and it quickly spread through politically advantageous marriages. Modern Neo-Sarkites are usually involved in business, finance, and other lucrative professions – though many of the older aristocrats still prefer to live among their crumbling castles and manors. \n> \n> “Fleshcrafting” is central to all Sarkic cults, though the degree varies between cults and individuals. The most extreme examples are usually found among Neo-Sarkites, due to their sadism and libertine interests. This can be used to alter the self and others in both monstrous and disturbingly beautiful ways; it can also be employed to create new life and seize control of any organic matter. It is important to remember that traditional Sarkic cults regard the gods (known to them as Archons) as their creators but also as something to be opposed. Gods are to be “devoured” so that humanity might rise above them. However, Neo-Sarkites are perfectly willing to serve these cosmic horrors if it benefits them. \n> \n> \n> Ancient texts should be presented as having righteous and benevolent goals, even if the means seem utterly alien or even abhorrent. Sarkites are best depicted as having the same positive and negative traits as any other human though their traditions are a window into something truly nightmarish and cosmic in scale.\n\nThe Great Hippo's Advice\n> Like the Church of the Broken God, Sarkicism posits that our world is broken -- and describes a path to fix it. But while the Church pursues idealized solutions through external artifice and abstraction, Sarkics look within: Flesh, bone, sinew, thought -- and the very soul.\n> \n> The first mistake people make with Sarkics is presuming they're just fleshmancers. They //deal// in flesh, but only because they deal in reality -- and a significant portion of our reality is made of flesh. The second mistake people make is presuming all Sarkics are evil. They //can// be, sure; they can be a lot of things. But at their core, Sarkics are 'doctors'. The illness they treat? The human condition. Their cure? Apotheosis.\n> \n> There are two branches of Sarkicism: Proto-Sarkics are the original tradition, tracing their roots back thousands of years. Druids, shamans, and other mystics -- they seek apotheosis through the sacrifice of the few for the many. Neo-Sarkics are the newcomers, they're a syncretic fusion of Proto-Sarkic beliefs, science, and pseudo-science (such as eugenics). They seek apotheosis through the sacrifice of the many for the few. \n> \n> The tension between these movements defines Sarkicism in the modern era.\n> \n> > Recurring themes include cycles of death and rebirth, resurrection, consumption of one's fore-bearers and/or God(s), evolution, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncretism syncretism], and (particularly in the case of Neo-Sarkicism) the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power will to power]\n \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About Sarkicism\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> I am Ion, Grand Karcist of Adytum, and I have borne an intolerable force.

But one must note that the Serpent's Hand does not own the Wanderers' Library, nor do they have any special sort of authority or claim over it.\n> \n> One important thing to remember is that all it takes to become a member of the Serpent's Hand is considering yourself a member. Just as there are Serpent's Hand associates who are bird shamans and mantis swordsmiths, there are SH members who are completely normal humans who just happen to find the extraordinary pretty neat and are willing to embrace it. SH members don't need to be super powerful or super exceptional to be part of a group. Additionally, that means that not all SH members are the same—there are some splinter groups that are powerful and hostile and would happily go toe-to-toe with the Foundation or other GoIs to bust their friends out of lockups, but there are also a lot of more peaceful folks who just want to talk to their magical fish without someone wrecking their picnics. Some of them have simple stories, others are part of eons-long histories involving mythological deities and centuries-long conflict. There's a lot of room for fantastical elements here, just make sure you're not ripping off D&D or the latest YA novel.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Show Quotes About the SH\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n> \"The Garden is the Serpent's Place.\"\n- Various\n\n> When normalcy starts hurting the people who have to live under it, to try to cure a 'poison', //normalcy is itself the poison.//\n- [[[serpent-s-hand-hub|Serpent's Hand Hub]]]\n\n\n> The divinities of fear and order who come to walk in the cool evening air are only visitors.

Highly trained federal agents were cast as bumbling buffoons who only served to showcase how clever the Foundation was.\n> \n> The big thing with the UIU is that their limits are much more to do with politics than with their competency or ability. Their funding is limited, and there are a lot of legal constraints they have to follow. While maintaining the Veil is a key priority for them, their major mission is paranormal policing. There's too much weird stuff out there to just lock everything up in containment cells, so the easiest way to keep it hidden is to provide a safe, ordered paranormal community. Hence the Hoover Mandate, wherein the US basically says \"hands off\" to the other normalcy organizations, which is why paranormal enclaves like 3ports and Backdoor Soho can exist. 3ports is, really, just a single giant containment cell for tens of thousands of wizards and anartists and everything else, and it's the UIU's job to maintain order and make sure that they don't all kill each other.\n> \n> While they probably don't have the firepower to get into a straight-shooting war with the Foundation (not without seriously compromising the Veil, anyway), the fact that the paranormal enclaves //work// to keep the paranormal community segregated from normalcy plays a big part in why they are willing to abide by the Hoover Mandate. \n> \n> They're the wizard police, basically, at least within the US, both in the sense that they police wizards and in that they are wizards.\n \n\n\nIhp's Advice\n> The UIU's main weakness is the fact that nobody in the US government gives a good goddamn about them.  They were formed by Hoover, and are largely seen as an artifact of his paranoia. The Foundation keeps it afloat through interference with the congressional budget, and they provide a valuable service in taking on anomalies that aren't worth the Foundation's time-- when they've got a Keter-class to deal with in Kansas, they don't care about an anomalous genetic experimentation ring in Brooklyn. \n> \n> They're law enforcement above anything else, and despite the fact that people think of them as the X-Files, they have the authority to do a lot of law enforcement things-- arrest, investigate, arrest *and* investigate (there's a distinction there-- agents can either arrest or investigate, but special agents can do both), get warrants for things like camera footage and searching the premises. They can work with other parts of the FBI- SCP-3256, for instance, has them working with the Behavioral Analysis Unit, the Evidence Response Team, and at least one crime lab. \n> \n> Keep in mind that the UIU is probably not the only US Government agency that deals with the paranormal.

Yes, the general attitude of most WWS articles is 'happy-go-lucky', but they are far from perfect. Due to their lack of experience, small budget, lack of manpower, and relative Luddite status, WWS are more prone to failure than most other GoIs.\n> \n> What sets them apart, however, is their willingness to dust themselves off and try again. What they lack in just about everything else they make up for in spirit; these are people who love their job and are doing it because they believe they are doing the right thing. Keep in mind that 'the right thing' is subjective here, as they might just be doing more harm than good sometimes.\n> \n> To put it simply, WWS is about ordinary people doing their best in not-so-ordinary situations.\n\nDarkStuff's Advice:\n\n> Nico put it very nicely. In fact, most of what I wanted to write here he covered. There is another part, though.\n> \n> Wilson's Wildlife Solutions is also meant to be a lens through which we can see the \"inbetween\" phase, in which people know //of// the anomalous but are clearly ignorant of the //scope// of everything. Wilson's Wildlife Solutions does not employ reality benders. They don't manufacture Reality Anchors (though they might use them with Foundation approval). They don't know much of anything about Anderson, about Are We Cool Yet?, about Fifthism or Sarkicism or Mekhanism (I believe we can call it that). They //have// been seen in Three Portlands in one article, but that's the outlier. Largely, they have little knowledge of the anomalous world except the small window they can see through the sleepy town of Boring, Oregon, and the Foundation.\n> \n> They are //also// meant to be somewhat of a complement to the Foundation. Wilson's Wildlife Solutions is what the Foundation would be if they were smaller, more idealistic, more //people// focused, more public, more... anything, really. Wilson's Wildlife Solutions is idealistic and optimistic, where the Foundation is calculating and pessimistic. The way that their energies play off of each other is a large part of the Wilson's Wildlife Solutions charm. It might be silly, but when writing Wilson's Wildlife Solutions, think of them as the Spongebob to the Foundation's Squidward.
