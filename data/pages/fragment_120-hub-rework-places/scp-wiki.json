  "content": "++ Places\n\nThe world is magical -- literally! -- and the places we visit in it are living proof of that. Below you can find a dossier of some of the most important areas featured as settings throughout the canon, alongside their descriptions.\n\n* **Adytum** -- the capital of the sarkic nation of Kalmaktama and [[[uralic-breath|seat of power of Grand Karcist Ion and his four Klavigars]]]. Appears more like a grotesque flesh tree planted on the [[[manifest-704|graves of Daevite slavemasters]]] than any real city. [[[laid-in-blood|Breached]]] and [[[a-baptism-of-fire|burnt]]] by Mekhanite forces following the conclusion of the First Occult War. Little more than a record of that which once was, in the modern day.\n\n* **Amoni of the Pillars** -- the southern-most residence of the Broken Empire of the Mekhanites and city-state acting as its capital. The seat of power of the three Prophets of MEKHANE and cradle of Mekhanite civilization. [[[scp-8472|Sacked]]] and divided by a schism in the Broken faith following the conclusion of the First Occult War.\n\n* **Arcadia** -- an [[[scp-7629|underground Droganian city]]] led by the Dragoon's Circle, a thirteen-person council made up of twelve nobles and the Vajra King, the leader of the Droganian people. Granted the Free Port status soon after its discovery. Experienced significant growth following the collapse of the Veil in 2021, leading to its close cooperation with Vanguard and other organizations. \n\n* **Avalon** -- one of the Five Fae Kingdoms. Once a thriving hub for Fae societies, the Sixth Occult War and the establishment of the Veil led to the significant weakening of the nomenclative narrative spells that held Avalon together. This eventually led to its deconceptualization and disappearance from baseline reality, forcing most of its citizens to seek refuge in Three Portlands. Although in the modern day, Avalon has been gone for over a century, the [[[finding-avalon|influence of its culture can still be seen throughout most of the paranormal world]]].\n\n* **Druv'tuul** -- a [[[scp-7600|gigantic biomechanical underground city]]] located sporadically throughout the Earth's inner and outer cores. [[[art:sketches-made-by-o5-4-the-annalist-during-his-visit-to-s|Acts as the primary habitat hotspot for over 99,5% of the Yeren population worldwide]]]. Prior to the SCP Foundation's intervention, Druv'tuul was an oppressive monarchy ruled by [[[sc-049-100-049-103|Met'heus, an ancient Yeren thaumaturge and brother to the mythical figure of Phomet]]]. Following the collapse of the Veil in 2021, the city [[[scp-7629|became a sovereign state and became an elective monarchy ruled by its new leader, king Eldröl Gérunda]]].\n\n* **Esterberg** -- the [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|largest and oldest still existing city built by anomalous species]]] and a Free Port located in Częstochowa, Poland. Houses some of the biggest Fae and Yeren populations around the world and acts as the main hub for anomalous activity -- [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub|especially]]] [[[scp-6772|related]]] [[[scp-643|to]]] [[[nt-4041-nimuedianetic-karhu|the]]] [[[scp-5373|aforementioned]]] [[[scp-6471|species]]] -- in Central Europe. Filled with magic on a scale almost never-before-seen, Esterberg is a monument to cooperation between different species, organizations, and people, showing what can be achieved when the good of the many is placed before the good of the few. [[[i-did-not-fade|In 2034, it merged with its baseline reality sister city of Częstochowa, forming New Częstochowa in the process]]].\n\n* **Eurtec** -- a cyberpunk technological metropolis located in a pocket reality anchored primarily in Germany, officially classified as a Free Port. Under the control of the Global Occult Coalition's Servants of the Silicon Nornir, Eurtec was founded in 1985 to speed up the development of paratechnology in Europe for the purpose of the Servants' own agenda. Despite the Coalition's supervision, the city hosts one of the largest paracriminal underworlds, [[[everchase|oftentimes dealing with crimes related to paratechnology]]], paranarcotics, and parahumans. Home to House Darke's primary headquarters, the monumental [[[it-s-always-darkest|DEATH PYRAMID]]].\n\n* **Galileo** -- a city megastructure located in the Mare Imbrium crater on the Moon. [[[lunar-city|Constructed in the 2030s through a joint effort between numerous nations and organizations managed by Vanguard]]], it is the [[[david-hunt-on-galileo|first off-world settlement with a permanent population and the ability to sustain its own needs]]]. Connected to the Earth via a modified version of the SCP-120 portal, Galileo acts as a hub for trade, research, tourism, and Solar System exploration missions. Home to the research installation of the [[[excerpts-from-the-galileo-deep-space-observatory|Galileo Deep-Space Observatory]]].\n\n* **The Nameless Forest** -- a pocket reality [[[ralliston-s-proposal|created by Queen Mab during the Third Great Diaspora]]] for the purpose of trapping and torturing the now-nameless victims of the Purge. [[[scp-4000|Housing over 75% of the Fae population, it takes the form of an endless, non-Euclidean forest bound by name-magic and strange rules]]]. Stealing names is the only way for its prisoners to escape, which has [[[ambrose-esterberg|infrequently happened]]] throughout history. Following the [[[jaeger-part-2|death of Queen Mab in 2021]]], the magic which had bound the Forest dissipated, freeing most of its still-alive population back into baseline reality.\n\n* **Hy-Brasil** -- one of the Five Fae Kingdoms. Located in the seas surrounding Ireland, Hy-Brasil once housed the single largest Fae population on the planet. However, after [[[lte-0851-cetus|the Crocosquid attack and the GOC thaumonuclear bombardment that followed]]], it was degraded from its former Free Port status to a hollow, barely-populated Nexus. Although many plans and attempts were made to revive the once-thriving monolith of Fae culture that Hy-Brasil was, even following the collapse of the Veil in 2021, most of them resulted in nothing but failure.\n\n* **Site-01** -- the primary headquarters of the SCP Foundation's O5 Council and Overwatch Command. Located 25 kilometers south of Kraków, Poland. Transformed into its current state from the [[[ralliston-s-proposal|Factory building following the Foundation's hostile takeover]]], it acts as the primary containment site for the only anomaly present within: SCP-001-C, Queen Mab. Protected by a series of borderline impenetrable thaumaturgic wards, protective circles, and rituals. Antimemetically hidden from almost all outside observation, allowing for the safety that the O5 Council's continued operation necessitates.\n\n* **Site-59** -- an SCP Foundation facility located near the Gulf of Mexico. Does not contain any anomalies, and is instead focused on hosting [[[the-holiday-special|Foundation staff parties]]], organized by the Ethics Committee to keep up personnel morale. Its exact location is known only to the O5 Council and the Committee itself to protect the intoxicated partying staff from any outside danger.\n\n* **Site-PL-69** -- an [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/dokumentacja-bezpiecznej-placowki-osrodek-pl-69 SCP Foundation research facility] located in the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/10-kwietnia-2010 anomalously-formed, 13-kilometer-deep Baltic Trench] in the Baltic Sea. Primarily focused on [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/morskie-opowiesci researching the sunken ruins of the Fae Empire detected in the Trench] and studying the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/ryba-pod-kocim-nozem local Fae subspecies], which have [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/powrot-do-niflheimu radically adapted to their drastic, underwater environments].\n\n* **Site-118** -- an [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-118|SCP Foundation research facility]]] located in the Sonoran Desert. Primarily focused on handling [[[scp-6471|nomenclative hazards]]], Site-118 is designed to reduce the impact of potential Keter-class containment breaches. Due to its specialization, heavily involved with the [[[cycle-of-seasons-hub|Cycle of Seasons]]] of the Fae Courts.\n\n* **Site-120** -- an [[[secure-facility-dossier-site-120|SCP Foundation research facility]]] located in Częstochowa, Poland. Acts as the [[[fresh-blood|headquarters]]] of the [[[scp-6172|Department of Ontokinetics]]]; due to this, it specializes in [[[scp-6936|thaumaturgic]]], [[[scp-5795|ontokinetic]]], and [[[scp-5659|theological anomalies]]], oftentimes utilizing unconventional methods to contain them. One of the few Sites actively encouraging the usage of the anomalous. Acts as the main Foundation observation point for the Free Port of [[[esterberg-city-wikipedia|Esterberg]]], with which it [[[scp-643|frequently]]] [[[gaslight-gatekeep-girlboss-hub|cooperates]]].\n\n* **Sloth's Pit** -- a small midwestern town located in Wisconsin, United States. The world of Sloth's Pit is ruled by the \"narrative,\" a mostly-benevolent force that influences the lives of its citizens by making them follow the lines of tropes, clichés, and themes frequently found in western media. This effect oftentimes results in the appearance of mythological figures and the [[[one-spark-four-flames|visits of different people from all around the world]]].\n\n* **Three Portlands** -- a pocket reality city-state, connected to the Isle of Portland in the United Kingdom and the cities of Portland in Oregon and Maine. Three Portlands is the largest Free Port in North America, housing a population of over 80 000 humans, parahumans, and anomalous races. Mostly built by [[[finding-avalon|Fae refugees from Avalon, which were forced to escape from their dying home]]] in the early 20th century. Controlled by the FBI Unusual Incidents Unit, which [[[uiu-file-2014-158|enforces the American law within the city]]].\n\n* **The Wanderers' Library** -- an extrauniversal nexus existing outside the Multiversal Compass, taking the form of an infinite library. Contains [[[the-edge-of-all-light|every single piece of writing that ever has been or ever will be created]]], [[[a-library-empty|allowing visitors to use the knowledge contained within it]]] as long as they follow its rigid rules. Due to its status, the Library isn't controlled by any one faction, instead acting as neutral operational grounds for numerous organizations and locations, such as the [[[the-deathless-merchant-of-london|Serpent's Hand]]], the [[[the-queen-in-green|Black Queen]]] syndicate, or the [[[publin|Publin]]] bar.\n\n++ The Multiversal Compass\n\nBeyond baseline reality and all of the pocket dimensions anchored to it, the [[[scp-6172|Multiversal Compass]]] lies. A collection of all realities to ever exist, it accounts for all possible worlds and outcomes, splitting its timelines into two separate ones whenever any choice is made. The further away from a universe a reality is, the harder it is to traverse the [[[scp-3001|gap between them]]], and the more different they are from each other. With nearly infinite possibilities, the only limit to [[[chronicles-of-the-irreal-hub|exploring the vast multiverse]]] is one's technology, endurance, and sanity.",
