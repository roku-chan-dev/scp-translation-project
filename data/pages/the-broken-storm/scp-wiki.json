Marcus (Operations Liaison):**\n“Satellite recon confirms the Chaos Insurgency is operating out of an abandoned monastic complex near Grid Theta-42. At 1900 hours local time, we registered a Class-3 thaumaturgic spike centered beneath the chapel ruins. That alone would’ve been enough for interest—but we cross-referenced that energy pattern and got a hit. It's almost identical to SCP-███’s activation signature.”\n\n**Dr. Vega (Anomalous Artifacts Division):**\n“The monastic records mention an idol worshiped in secret by monks in the 13th century. A four-armed figure believed to ‘walk between seconds.’ We’re calling it Relic-19-A. The Insurgency is trying to wake it up.”\n\n**Captain Juno (Nu-15):**\n“So we’re going into a crypt chasing something that distorts time and memory, currently in the hands of a terrorist cult with a god complex. Great.”\n\n++ Operation “Twilight Hail” Engagement Log\n\n**Timestamp: 2025-03-11 – 02:17 hours**\n\nInsertion – VTOL Transport “Blackwing-7”\n\n//RTF Nu-15 descends silently through fog. Thermal readings show no signs of life within the ruins—deceptive, as expected. Instruments begin to glitch intermittently.//\n\n**Private Halvors:**\n“My scope’s flickering. Probably just interference, right?”\n\n**Sergeant Kell:**\n“Or a polite warning from the thing downstairs. Stay sharp.”\n\n02:42 – Initial Engagement\n\n//Chaos Insurgency snipers open fire from the belltower. Nu-15 takes cover behind crumbled stone walls. Suppression initiated. One insurgent is neutralized by drone-guided missile. Another disappears into a hole beneath the nave.//\n\n**Captain Juno:**\n“They’re guarding something below. Stack up—breach the crypt.”\n\n02:47 – Entry into Crypt\n\n//Old stone stairwell leads into a chamber lit by flickering lanterns and blood symbols scrawled across the walls. Scraps of Insurgency equipment, data slates, and ritual diagrams scattered across a makeshift altar.//\n\n**Private Halvors (visibly shaken):**\n“The air’s… wrong. It’s like breathing in syrup.”\n\n**Lt. Marcus:**\n“Psychogenic field detected. Recommend mental shielding protocols—deploy memetic filters.”\n\n02:52 – Contact with Relic-19-A\n\n//A central stone dais, cracked and moss-covered, holds Relic-19-A: a basalt humanoid idol, four arms folded across its chest. Sigils pulse red. A containment shell surrounds it, powered by anomalous tech spliced with Foundation stolen parts.//\n\n**Dr. Vega (via comm):**\n“If that thing wakes up, it could destabilize every second in a ten-kilometer radius. It doesn’t kill you—it erases the moment you were alive. You’d never have existed.”\n\n02:54 – Ambush\n\n//Six Chaos Insurgency agents phase in through a rift in the stone wall. One holds a crystalline firearm emitting violet energy.//\n\n**Insurgency Commander “Virgil”:**\n“You’re too late. This relic doesn’t belong to you—it never did. It remembers who we were before the Foundation shackled the world.”\n\n//Chaos Insurgency engages. Two Nu-15 operatives downed immediately. Relic-19-A glows brighter—sigils spinning.//\n\n**Sergeant Kell:**\n“We’ve got temporal distortion building. Clock sync is out of phase—mission timer’s jumping back every five seconds!”\n\n02:59 – Reality Break\n\n//The chamber fractures. Time stutters. One operative is seen flickering in and out—appearing in three positions at once before collapsing. Voices in Latin echo from nowhere.//\n\n//“Tempus est servus. Tempus est dominus.”//\n> Time is a servant. Time is a master.\n\n//A Reality Anchor is dropped and initialized. Field begins to stabilize.//\n\n**Lt. Marcus:**\n“It’s working—but we need five more minutes or this whole place folds into a Möbius strip.”\n\n03:03 – Suicide Assault\n\n//Insurgency operative “Virgil” sacrifices himself, activating a black crystal. He vanishes in a flash—no remains. The relic feeds on the energy. It shifts. Its eyes open. Time stops for 0.7 seconds—long enough for every operative to see themselves die.//\n\n**Private Halvors (recorded on helmet cam):**\n“…I just watched myself get shot. Twice. But I’m still here.”\n\n**Captain Juno:**\n“Don’t think. Move. Lock it down!”\n\n03:09 – Final Stand\n\n//Insurgency backup arrives—armored truck with mounted anomalous cannon. Nu-15 counters with heavy plasma and sonic ordinance. Two Chaos operatives attempt to extract the idol—one is absorbed into its surface, screaming as he fades from memory.//\n\n//Drone Support arrives. Three hostiles eliminated.\nContainment Casket deployed. Relic-19-A secured.//\n\n03:23 – Extraction\n\n//Exfiltrated via subterranean Foundation rail tunnel. Three wounded, four KIA. One MIA—Sergeant Kell, last seen during temporal collapse. No memory of his presence exists on two surviving operatives. Only found on digital logs.//\n\n++ POST-ENGAGEMENT ANALYSIS\n\n> Relic-19-A reclassified as SCP-████. Exhibits non-linear memory effects, reality bending fields, and a passive memetic hazard. Currently housed in Site-77, Vault Theta-Black.\n\n> Researcher Note: \"We tried to count the number of limbs it has. First it was four. Then five. Then none at all. I stopped counting after I saw my daughter’s face reflected in its surface. I don’t have a daughter.\"",
