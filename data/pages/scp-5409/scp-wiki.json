SCP-5409-1 instances have the physical appearance and texture of hard plastic and rubber, but are composed of a previously unknown organic polymer. The faux-rubber \"nipple\" on each SCP-5409-1 instance is filled with a liquid compound consisting of sap, water, fat, proteins, and lactose. Growth analysis indicates that all 200 SCP-5409-1 instances grew over an estimated 24-hour period during September or October of 2012.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Discovery__**\nSCP-5409 was discovered on 2013/04/20, by a hiker on the Big Heat Trail in South Mills, Arkansas. The hiker posted detailed pictures of SCP-5409 and a video of himself picking and dissecting an SCP-5409-1 instance to his Facebook account, which were subsequently flagged and removed by WebCrawler 0/FB-44. Assets within the Arkansas State Police were able to verify the anomalous nature of SCP-5409, and cordoned off the area until Foundation personnel could arrive.\n\nA Foundation botanical containment team was dispatched to exhume and transport SCP-5409 to Site-51. During this process, the skeletal remains of a one to seven day old infant male was found entangled in the roots of SCP-5409. The degraded remains of a wicker basket and cotton sheet were also recovered from the roots. A small non-organic pacifier matching the physical appearance of SCP-5409-1 was discovered near the remains.\n\nA small envelope was located in the wicker basket; though the index card within was degraded, the following hand-written message was deciphered through analysis:\n\n> I'm sorry, I'm just not ready.\n> \n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5408]]] | SCP-5409 | [[[SCP-5410]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** pac.jpg\n> **Author:** RuggyBearLA\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0 \n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/21874566@N07/3393862615 flickr]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
