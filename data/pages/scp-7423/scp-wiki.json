That of course changed when the Apollyon took all our attention. Blaming it solely on either of the two would still be a wrong assessment. Even with all that happened, there's a bit of an overestimation of the world-ending capabilities of a single anomaly. On paper, they often seem like they can expand infinitely, but they all have a limit in one way or another. Mountains in particular are a bulwark of reality your average world-ender finds a hurdle too steep to climb.\n\nThe worst one of the \"Syncope\" anomalies was probably SCP-7676 with its cascading waves of reality alterations. The thing is that these anomalies were almost exclusively focused on North America, with maybe [https://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-1976 one or two] appearing on other continents. We had all reason to believe that in the absolute worst case we would only lose the US. And that was still far-fetched with how local most of them were. No, the role these anomalies played in all of this was spreading our resources thin at a time with so many wildfires that the Veil was already tearing.\n\n~ General Westhill\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n= **O5 Council Meeting Transcript**\n\n----\n\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**O5-11:** And I'm telling you we can't keep this amnestics supply up.

Being generous we can withhold amnestics for 1 in 10 individuals as long as we rebound at some point. Any more than that and the unamnesticized can successfully spread veiled information faster than we can amnesticize them. //(Pause)// If we can't allow any shortage in the supply the only solution that comes to mind is [[[SCP-3000|the eel]]].\n\n**O5-2:** Absolutely not.\n\n**O5-11:** I'd rather fail morally than completely.\n\n**O5-6:** We might not have to go that far.

This should suffice for now to solve the slot problem. I have also created a direct file for SCP-7423 so no one else will mess with the slot. It and all the secondary files are to be restricted to exclusive Archivist Clearance.\n\n~ O5-10\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**Item #:** SCP-7423\n\n**Object Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** As the SCP-7423 project is completed it requires no further Containment. SCP-7423-1 is to be contained per the Containment Procedures of [[[SCP-1423]]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-7423 was part of a Foundation run experiment to test the success of recreating the American culture following the activation of SCP-2000. SCP-7423 specifically focused on reproducing the anomalous events in Kirk Lonwood High School in May of the original 1976 AD.\n\nThis event was chosen as a plethora of anomalies with unknown origin centred on the final class of High School and the music shop Syncope Symphony appeared in the original 1976 and the following years of the ADK-Class \"Anomalous Destabilization\" Scenario.\n\nWhile the exact events could not be reproduced, the experiment resulted in the creation of SCP-7423-1, since designated SCP-1423. SCP-7423 was therefore tentatively deemed a success.\n\nSCP-7423-1 is a polaroid photograph that when held by a human subject will enhance memories of the subject's last high school summer vacation to the point of bypassing amnestic treatment. The back of SCP-7423-1 shows the written message \"{{We've had a great year, haven't we?}}\"\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7422]]] | SCP-7423 | [[[SCP-7424]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
