The contest was a huge success with a massive 119 pieces submitted from 34 teams with a total of 84 participating authors. Of these, 24 teams and 103 pieces qualified for victory, a huge increase from Wrathcon's (the sites previous contest) 37 qualifying works.\n\nBut which team came out on top? Well that honour goes to team Provisional Government of Occupied Third Law, Revolutionary Firing Squad, consisting of [[*user TyGently]]ᶜᵖᵗ, [[*user Intercedent]], [[*user Anorrack]]. The character they choose to bring new life to was Gilgamesh, King of Uruk, most famously known from The Epic of Gilgamesh. The entries submitted were:\n# **[[[To be King in the House of Dust]]]** //by Intercedent// (+86)\n# **[[[With Naught but Dust to Eat]]]** //by TyGently// (+69)\n# **[[[ptt-1666-gray-templum|PTT-1666-Gray-Templum — \"Irkalla, the House of Dumuzi, the Netherworld\"]]]** //by Anorrack// (+68)\n# **[[[King of the Dead, Breaker of Chains]]]** //by Intercedent// (+68)\n# **[[[To Make Meat of Clay]]]** //by Anorrack and Intercedent// (+64)\n# **[[[SCP-8660]]] -- The Empty Birdcage** //by Anorrack and TyGently// (+61)\n# **[[[SLAYER OF WICKEDNESS]]]** //by Anorrack, Intercedent, and TyGently// (+51)\n# **EPILOGUE: [[[The Fruit of Eight Millennia]]]** //by Anorrack and TyGently// (+44)[[footnote]]all ratings being as of the time of writing and may no reflect the ratings as they were on the contest closing date[[/footnote]]\n\nThe team won with a score 286 but managed to rack up a total 511 combined upvotes and an average count of 63.9.\n\nA massive thanks to all of you who participated and made the contest flourish as it did, and to the site's contest organizers for allowing these events to happen.\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ProblemPal//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n------\n\nRecently, [[[eventyr-hub|Eventyr]]] has officially become a canon! A remixed version of our classical SCP stories and characters within a fairytale setting, while also tackling themes such as generational curses, learning from our guardians, and seeking family.\n\n[[*user AstersQuill]] and [[*user sailorenoch]] has given us the time to interview them to share their thoughts:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**1.) What inspired you to create Eventyr?**\n\nAt least for me, the entire idea of Eventyr dates back to when I first read [[[SCP-166]]] and I wanted to expand on her story in some way. Though this is what ultimately led to [[[SCP-8166]]], Remixcon was also a huge influence, and that is actually where two of the first Eventyr articles came from: [[[SCP-6317]]] and [[[SCP-7462]]]. After that, the 8k contest really just cemented that idea of a want to push these stories further, and Eventyr was born from that. — AstersQuill\n\nI've always had a love for adaption and remixing. I wasn't able to participate in remixcon, but really enjoyed everything I read. I was brought on a bit later but working on 8166 it was clear that this was everything I loved. 8166 was the first thing I actually worked on for the wiki haha! — sailorenoch\n\n**2.) What are your favorite entries that best represent the canon?**\n\nI really think [[[SCP-8166]]] helps represent the canon best, though in terms of that remixing vibe, I have to give it to The Bowe Transition in terms of taking an old character and concept and flipping it in an entirely different direction. In terms of capturing the fairy tale vibe, I honestly feel as though Faust, Raisin, and Roxy's Arthurian Cycle PDcon entries do an amazing job at accomplishing that vibe. — AstersQuill\n\n[[[SCP-8166]]] is the core entry, the foundation of the rest of Eventyr and sets everything up, so I feel like that's the best overall entry. The Arthurian Cycle series I made with the help of Raisin and Rosy. I feel like it also helps represent how to adapt an existing story very well, and how to make it Eventyr. — sailorenoch\n\n**3.) At its core, Eventyr is fantastical that tackles familial themes while following the bureaucratic nature of the Foundation. What motivated you to write about the canon in this way?**\n\nAt least from my perspective, as someone whose stories predominantly feature anomalies in containment (Hana and Meri) and how they interact with the Foundation, I felt like the fantastical sort of vibe we set up provided a really interesting juxtaposition to the systems our characters are trapped in. Though Hana and Meri's stories carry a whimsical vibe, they very much are victims to the oppressive nature of the Foundation, and that nature wasn't something we wanted to lose by predominantly centering our stories in remixes or fairy tales. — AstersQuill\n\nI really have a love for themes around cycles and repetition. I think it shows the human nature a bit. Part of that is the cycle of abuse that gets passed down from generation to generation. I think the contrast between the fantastical element and the cold Foundation. — sailorenoch\n\n\n**4.) Was Eventyr intended to be a canon initially? If not, how did it grow to become one?**\n\nThere were talks about making Eventyr a canon, but there was never any definite timeline on when that would be the case. The push for canonization came at a period where I felt interest in Eventyr was waning, and the model of running a closed setting was something that was ultimately stagnating. Opening Eventyr up to canonization, while also allowing people to continue on with their series how they saw fit, was ultimately the best and only move to ensure that people were interested in the canon going forward. — AstersQuill\n\nNo, but once 8166 was established we found ourselves wanting to write more characters. It first became a series, and that series continued to grow and grow. We wanted to establish the basics and what to expect before we went into having it into a canon. — sailorenoch\n\n**5.) What are your plans for Eventyr going forward?**\n\nPersonally, I have a three act series planned that focuses on Hana and Meri, though I very much do intend to write stories that don't directly focus on them. Generally, I can't say I have anything specific in mind. Eventyr is at a point I'm incredibly happy with, and everything that comes after is just a bonus to an already amazing experience. — AstersQuill\n\nI plan on diving into the early foundation days of the Eventyr timeline, focusing on familiar but reinterpted faces like Siegel, Mann, and also some new faces as well. I really want to explore how Eventyr was founded on colonization, and how the O5 treat staff and anomalies like they are all part of one big British Museum. This is a long-term project, so it probably won't show up until much later. I also have a few Eventyr collabs planned! — sailorenoch\n\n**6.) Would you like to share any tips/advice for writers who wish to contribute to the canon?**\n\nI think any Eventyr writer should really look into the soul of what they want to write. A lot of the works in the canon, while diving into fairy tale, also really dig into a personal aspect of the author. I think finding inspiration in one's self and finding a way to connect that into a fantastical feeling story is my best advice. Eventyr is all about the vibe, after all, and I think it's really important to really dig into not only what the story has to offer, but also learn something new about yourself along the way. — AstersQuill\n\nReally understand your source material, learn literal analysis to dissect themes, symbolism, and vibes. This goes for both stuff on wiki and literature. Every good adaption in Eventyr has some element of love as well. Learn to love your characters especially and not to be afraid to invoke a childlike wonder. I also ask to look and analyze other adaptions, especially strange ones! I've seen like 10 versions of Phantom of the Opera, and you can really see into the mind of someone by figuring out how they adapt something. — sailorenoch\n\n**7.) Do you have any final thoughts you would like to share with readers?**\n\nI wanted to say that I'm incredibly thankful for everyone who has either supported Eventyr, both in reading and/or writing, over the course of this past year. Genuinely, it is because of y'all that the canon has grown to the extent it has, and I really can't put to words how amazing this entire experience has been through all the ups and downs. Thank you and Happy Reading! — AstersQuill\n\nThank you so much for reading Eventyr. It truly means so much that I was able to take part in something so close to my heart and share it with everyone. There is more to come! — sailorenoch\n\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By Strange Matter//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n------\n> \n> For as long as humans have learned and taught, so too have they created words and ideas and meanings to understand the world around them. These meanings- powerful tokens of belief that spread and shape that which receives them, they are what we have decided our universe is and encompasses.\n>\n\n[[=]]\n\nFrom the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/semiotics-hub|Semiotics Hub page]]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\nLast month saw the Semiotics canon hub be posted onto the wiki by [[*user PoufyPoufson]]. The canon encapsulates the surrealist-absurdist horror articles revolving around site-196s downfall. The cannon currently consists of 13 works with more to come on the way. You might be familiar with works in the canon such as [[[SCP-7793]]] or [[[SCP-8995]]]. \n\nArticles in the canon typically deal with deeply personal human narratives, depicting issues of hubris, loss, and abandonment, all depicted through hyper-clinical documentation. If you're interested in contributing your own ideas and stories to the canon then anyone can! It is recommended you reach out to [[*user PoufyPoufson]] through either wiki PMs or Discord for any questions you may have about the canon.\n\nWe hope to see many more great works added to the canon! \n\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ProblemPal//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n\n------\n------\n\nGreetings, class of April 1st!
