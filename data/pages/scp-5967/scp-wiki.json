Psychological assessments are required for personnel assigned to SCP-5967 twice per week. Testing with SCP-5967 is strictly forbidden.\n\nLyndhurst, New Jersey has been converted into Provisional Site-83, and Foundation agents are to monitor the town for evidence of continued anomalous activity. --Salem Steros and-- Caesar Winters is considered a Person of Interest related to SCP-5967 and is suspected to be involved in the continued creation of SCP-5967 instances across Bergen County. The \"Reality Cinq'' radio program is to be treated with standard media suppression tactics, should it begin broadcasting again.\n\nThe apprehension of Caesar Winters is considered a Rho-Level priority. Salem Steros is currently detained in a reality-sunk containment suite at Site-83, with three Scranton Reality Anchors active at all times.\n\n**Description:** Instances of SCP-5967 refer to five-meter-tall pillars composed of currently unidentified musculature and eyeball-like organs originating in Lyndhurst, New Jersey. There are currently seven contained instances. DNA analysis of SCP-5967 has proven ineffective in identifying the source of its components, although the eyeball-like organs visually resemble those of non-anomalous humans. SCP-5967 is capable of speech, despite lacking vocal organs, and consistently intones phrases indicative of  [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-five-mind|Fifthist]]] ideology. Individuals who are within the auditory range of SCP-5967 without wearing auditory protective gear will be forced to adhere to Fifthist ideologies.\n\nMembers of a group known as \"The Commune\", operating out of the local Elks Lodge[[footnote]]The Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks (BPOE; also often known as the Elks Lodge or simply The Elks) is an American fraternal order founded in 1868, originally as a social club in New York City.[[/footnote]], were able to radically influence the Hume levels of Lyndhurst and its surrounding towns over the course of three days, generating substantial amounts of latent reality. SCP-5967 allowed The Commune's leadership figures, Caesar Winters and Salem Steros, to establish and maintain control over the minds of local residents.\n\nAffected individuals were susceptible to remote influence by Winters or Steros. Established methods of conceptual manipulation, amnestic treatment, and hypnotherapy have proven ineffective in relinquishing control of the affected subject from either party. The maximum range of influence, if there is one, has yet to be determined.\n-----\n[[collapsible show=\"Cassette tapes found in the ruins of the Lyndhurst Police Station\" hide=\"Close\"]]\nOn December 3^^rd^^, 2017, undercover agents embedded in the Lyndhurst police force reported an instance of SCP-5967 manifested in the center of the Lyndhurst Police Station. Containment teams were dispatched in an effort to mitigate civilian injuries and secure the instance. Surviving witnesses were amnesticized, and SCP-5967 was contained.\n\nDue to the abrupt cessation of The Reality Cinq's productions, it was hypothesized that Steros and Winters were operating from within the police station using anomalous methods to conceal themselves, their equipment, and even their studio.\n\nThe following cassette tapes were found during the reconstruction of the police station.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n**Air date:** June 3^^rd^^, 2018\n\n**Winters:** Goooooood evening everybody!

Steros and his followers were discovered holding hands in a circular pattern around SCP-5967. Foundation agents observed the members of the Commune approach the SCP-5967 instance, kneel down and lick SCP-5967 several times before returning to their location within the circle.\n\nSteros was taken to Site-83 for questioning, while the other members of The Commune were taken to Site-9, where they were kept in isolation containment cells.\n\nAt Site-83, Steros frequently complained of headaches and demanded to be examined. His requests were initially denied. Steros, in turn, elected to harm himself by repeatedly running into a wall until he lost consciousness. A medical team was alerted to this behavior and, after treating his wounds, performed an MRI before he regained consciousness, discovering the source of Steros' discomfort. (See image)\n\nJunior Researcher Umar Hadid volunteered to interview Steros as he had previous experiences with the latter.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n**Interviewer:** Junior Researcher Umar Hadid\n\n**Interviewed:** Salem Steros\n\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**J.R.

Why don't you just let me outta here so I can get back out there with Caesar and spread the Truth huh? Isn't saving people what your Foundation is about?\n\n**J.R.

Look, if you could just, explain a bit clearer what you-\n\n**Steros:** Listen here, fuckstick. I'm gonna tell you this once. //Once//! //She// is a goddess, one that is actively trying to fuck us. And you an' me? We are //not// ready for that. No one on Earth is. \n\n**J.R. Hadid:** Why?\n\n**Steros:** Because that's //Her// thing, Jones. Hadid, whatever the fuck. \n\n**J.R.

And if- no, when //She// gets here and we can't see //Her//, well, that's just bad news bears for everyone.\n\n**J.R. Hadid:** How would seeing this entity be good for anyone?\n\n**Steros:** Loyalty. I mean, think about it. Who in their right mind would lick a pillar made of meat and bones for fun?\n\n**J.R. Hadid:** I don't think anyone would. B-but how did you figure this out?\n\n**Steros:** Me and Caesar we were just stargazing in the meadowlands after a show one day. Was nice to get away from the city every once and a while and just... take in the view.  We did that sometimes, just lay back and chill like we were kids again. Then we heard //Her// voice for the first time and //She// told us about the Truth. Said that //She// wanted to come home, but that the Way was broken so //She// needed our help.\n\n**J.R. Hadid:** You and Caesar became Fifthists after that?\n\n**Steros:** After we learned the Truth we knew that something had to be done. But you can't make a cake without breaking a few eggs. \n\n**J.R. Hadid:** That's not the-\n\n**Steros:** Would you rather eat a cake or an omelet, shadow man? \n\n**J.R. Hadid:** A cake I guess. \n\n( //Steros nods.// ) \n\n**Steros:** We'll all be eggs in //Her// massive cake. But maybe, //maybe// some of us will get to eat it too.\n\n**J.R. Hadid:** I'd hardly call turning people into meat pillars saving them.\n\n**Steros:** ( //Laughing// ) I don't expect you to understand. You can't see things like we do. Caesar's doing the lord's work, and you'll never find him.\n\n**J.R. Hadid:** I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.\n\n**Steros:** Oh?\n\n**J.R.

Similar reports from undercover Foundation agents county-wide confirmed that Caesar Winters was responsible for the creation of the instances. \n\nMTF Lambda-5 encountered Winters in the meadowlands, a remote field located in East Rutherford, New Jersey.
