This time we have here our dear fishy friend Percy. It's about time I drew fanart of my own article.\n\nAnd huzzah, I have snagged myself a Series III spot! I wrote this as quickly as I could before coldposting it (//Sorry for committing such a terrible sin, by the way//). I am quite proud of myself for the progress I have made on my mission to write an article for every single series.\n\nI'm planning to write more articles for the AEED. I struggle with coming up with overarching stuff like this, so the fact that I managed to conceive this department amazes me. Shoutout to [[*user Rounderhouse]]'s Department Con. I doubt I would ever come up with this if I didn't participate in this contest.\n\nAlso, I give my thanks to my teammates: [[*user Deadcanons]] and [[*user GreenGolem]]. They really did help me better vision this concept and piece it together into an actual thing. I really appreciate it.\n\nYou should stop by and read an article from our department some time. Who knows, maybe even contribute to it too. By '//maybe//', I mean you should. This is a threat.\n\nOkay, bye. ðŸ‘‹\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ //Why yes!
