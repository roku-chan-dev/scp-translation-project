  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nAny pages which contain adult material need to be posted in accordance with the [http://05command.wikidot.com/forum/t-13896072/adult-content-warnings Adult Content Warnings Policy].\n\n__Site members are //not// expected to know and carry out these instructions,__ any author posting an adult page may request that site staff implement this on their behalf.\n\nThis requires two pages:\n\n* The actual article. This must be posted in the {{adult:}} category.\n* The splash page. This provides a content warning and a link to the actual article.\n\nBy posting in the {{adult:}} category, the page will automatically gain a warning banner, and a redirect to the splash page unless the user has opted-in to the content. As a result, MAST will apply the {{redirect}} tag in addition to {{adult}}.\n\nThe splash page will have the {{adult}} and {{splash}} tags, and must include {{component:adult-splash}} to provide the standardized notice:\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@<[[include component:adult-splash slug=scp-xxxx]]>@\n[[/div]]\n\nIf it is a mainlist SCP, it should also have a Wikiwalk footer underneath:\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n@<[[include component:adult-splash slug=scp-xxxx]]>@\n\n\n@<[[footnoteblock]]>@\n\n@<[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]>@\n@<[[=]]>@\n@<<< [[[SCP-xxxw]]] | SCP-xxxx | [[[SCP-xxxy]]] >>>@\n@<[[/=]]>@\n@<[[/div]] >@\n[[/div]]\n\nThe {{slug}} parameter has the URL or \"slug\" of the page being posted. For instance, for {{adult:my-tale}} the slug would be \"{{my-tale}}\".\n\nOnce the splash and main pages are posted, ask a moderator to lock the splash page and its discussion forum. Edits and comments on the new article may only take place on the primary page in {{adult:}}, not the splash page.",
