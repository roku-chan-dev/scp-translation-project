However, there is a lot that happens behind the scenes. For this edition of Site News, we did an interview with Naepic and the contest committee on what goes into running a contest and deciding its theme. You can read the interview below!\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**How does the theme get decided? What criteria do you use to determine what makes a good theme?**\n\nWe have always had inconsistency when it came to why we chose a particular theme for the K-Cons. The last couple were for different reasons where luck was decided as we wanted something original and it paired well with the number. Obviously the last one we decided based on the requests for it from the past. What determines a theme to be good is generally based on our own speculations on how well the community can write around it - based off past feedback, we're encouraged to pick themes that are wide enough to have multiple interpretations while narrow enough to give people a direction to work toward.\n\n**Were there any themes you considered other than fantasy? Why did they get discarded?**\n\nFor 8kcon specifically, we kind of just settled on fantasy immediately. For 7kcon, themes like time and order were considered, but the thematic feel of 7 being luck felt like it was better than the others.\n\n**When do k-cons get announced? Is it based on the number of SCP slots left, or is there some other factor?**\n\nWe normally try to time the K-Cons in line with the remainder of the last series. We tried to estimate the time it would take for the series to fill up and for the contest to end so there's a smooth transition.\n\n**Other than deciding the theme, what other work goes into planning a kcon?**\n\nThe theme, the contest page itself and its aesthetic, scheduling and timing, and marshals come into play when planning it.\n\n**How far in advance was everything planned before the contest was announced?**\n\nWe normally have the schedule and planned theme set for a few months, normally a month or two in advance we start work building the page and its presentation. The way we plan schedules is that we try to plan the next year's worth of contests before the current year ends - for example, we finished up the 2024 contest schedule back in December 2023.\n\n**What kind of work goes into moderating a contest? How do you decide what to do when shenanigans occur?**\n\nWhen actually operating it, we answer questions and try to guide people in the right direction and in accordance with the rules we set for it. They're always reports sent our way in regards to people trying to circumvent the rules and so investigating those takes place too. It mainly boils to what we find during our investigations: a user who may downvote a lot of entries, but has shown thought into comments will not be viewed as suspicious as a user who has upvoted a specific author's entire body of work. There are comments that can invite downvotes on an entry, but one that calls out a fundamental issue within an article is not the same as one that makes fun of an author. It really hinges on the context for any suspicious incidents that we look into, and the severity of that incident(s) is what helps us determine what action is needed, if any.\n\n**What was the most exciting moment for you during the kcon planning? What did you enjoy about it?**\n\nMe, personally, the thrill of teasing the theme was fun. Maybe this is just my gambling addiction speaking, but I genuinely enjoyed posting a seemingly innocuous tweet and people forming wild speculations about what it could mean - especially when a lot of people ended up convincing themselves that the theme was going to be infinity\n\n**Is there anything else about contests that you would like our readers to know?**\n\nI think it's no surprise that contests, as fun and engaging as they can be, can also be a stressful time for authors due to the inherent competitive nature of contests. Please keep that in mind and treat authors as people.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[>]]\n[[span class=\"s-title\"]]//- By ParallelPotatoes//[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n------\n\n[[=image https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/YhTdg-zKwm_txCBv0VFgbwrJjMeKnWp3CMJJodOc1Gs/https/co-team.wdfiles.com/local--files/site-news-image-hosting/koblood.png?width=1200&height=910 width=\"500px\"]]\n\nThe 3rd annual Korean SCP Foundation Blood Donation Campaign in partnership with the Korean Association For Children with Leukemia & Cancer (KACLC) has come to a successful close!
