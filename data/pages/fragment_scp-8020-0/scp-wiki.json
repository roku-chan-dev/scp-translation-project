You were sitting in your lonesome sanctum, detached from the outside world. Your eyes trudged through pages of requisition reports with a tired droop. Your cohort of Thirteen had taken time out of their schedules to enjoy themselves. They even elected to invite you on the way out. Despite your status as the Administrator, you were far from immune to peer pressure. With a playful eye-roll in rebuttal, you would join them.\n\nThe night was a mess of barely coherent memories. The visages in your mind were broken by the mind-melting hands of inebriation. One moment, you were with your colleagues. The next, you were rubbing shoulders with people from all walks of life. Amongst all of the people you talked to, there was one who stuck out to you: a woman.\n\nIt was a tale as old as time itself--it only took one glance. Your mind was completely, and utterly, compromised: she was the saboteur. By the time she had introduced herself, a mess of words that barely sounded like English spilled from your mouth. For the rest of the night, you had shared what few hours were left of it together: you were enthralled.\n\nOver many months, your colleagues would comment about how you would leave your office more. Your closest friend and loud-mouthed business partner, Roland Foster, would tease you about a smile that never quite left your face.\n[[/==]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=default\n|unique-name=defections\n|display-name=SUBJECT: Recent Defections\n]]\n[[<]]\n**TO:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]administrator@site01.scp.int[[/span]]\n**FROM:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-1@site01.scp.int[[/span]]\n**CC:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5 Council (group)[[/span]]\n[[/<]]\n------\n[[==]]\nEvening Winston,\n\nWe've just wrapped up our meeting on the recent Insurgency activity.

It had been a while since you had stepped foot into Site-01, but you still had your obligations. You groan to yourself as you prepare for another long night in your study, you almost didn’t notice the door behind you opening. As you swing around on your chair, your eyes lock with the woman you had grown so familiar with. In the dim lighting, the band nestled upon her finger sparkles slightly. She gives you a soft smile as she places a hand on your shoulder, her other hand resting upon her abdomen. With only a few words, she convinces you that the pages can wait.[[/==]]\n[[=]]\nTomorrow is another day.[[/=]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=default\n|unique-name=news\n|display-name=SUBJECT: RE: News\n]]\n**TO:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]administrator@site01.scp.int[[/span]]\n**FROM:** [[span style=\"color: red;\"]]O5-1@site01.scp.int[[/span]]\n\n------\n\n[[==]]\nMorning Winnie,\n\nFirst: that's amazing news!

It's unheard of for men and women like us to fraternize with civilians, but I suppose we all have skeletons in our closets--just so happens yours are remarkably tame.\n\nSecond: I know this is unrelated, but I sent a copy of SCP-8020 over to you to look over.

Your mind is a mess. Your hand clutches hers as distress fills both of your bodies. Medical staff flank you in a race against human biology. You kept her as close as you could, but not close enough. When they came back, the doctor quietly shook his head. But your world had not ended yet, not entirely. Contained within your hands was your future: a boy. He was small and fragile, but to you? He was perfect in every way that mattered. For her sake, you promised yourself that you would keep the boy secure and protected.\n\nThe first year was the hardest, but eventually, you found an even tempo. You were far from the perfect father for the boy, but you were attentive and you were patient. That was more than what many others could say. With that aside, you have work to do that's far overdue.[[/==]]\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"RETRIEVE FILE 8020.1 || 1980 - 2001\" hide=\"Let's see...\"]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|containment-class= safe\n|containment-color= 0,159,107\n|inc-split-color= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:customizable-acs\n|containment-class= safe\n|containment-image= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/component%3Aanomaly-class-bar/safe-icon.svg\n|containment-color= 0,159,107\n|inc-esoteric-layout = --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= SCP-8020\n|clearance= 3\n|container-class= safe\n|secondary-class=\n|secondary-icon=\n|disruption-class= dark\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8020/cave2.png|caption=Northwest entrance to SCP-8020.|align=center|width=2000px|]]\n-----\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Site**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Site Director**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Research Head**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned MTF**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Site-03 [[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Site Director E.

Despite its location within the United States National Radio Quiet Zone, the architecture displays techniques more commonly associated with early medieval Europe. Several nonanomalous objects have been retrieved from SCP-8020 since its discovery, many depicting themes of death, judgment, and conflict. Extensive water damage has severely degraded a large majority of SCP-8020’s contents, greatly slowing research and containment efforts. To date, only 27% of associated items have been secured and properly cataloged.\n\nThe complex’s full extent has yet to be fully mapped but consists of over 70 distinct earthen chambers across five floors, centered around a massive circular burial chamber. This central burial chamber is characterized by the presence of thirteen identical stone sarcophagi, designated SCP-8020-1 through -13, each adorned with a variety of yet-to-be-deciphered symbols. Radiocarbon dating has suggested that these sarcophagi are upwards of 50,000+ years old.\n\nCurrently, only a subsect (-1, -5, -8, -10, -13) has been successfully opened for further examination. Each sarcophagus contains the remains of a humanoid, each in various states of decay. The cadavers are characterized by extensive branching bronze growths engulfing significant portions of their remains, which have displayed constant growth since they were exhumed in 1982. Contents found alongside each body are noted below:\n[[/==]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-1]]\n\n**ITEM RETRIEVED:** A small book, bound in human leather with a bronze spine.

To provide mental stimulation, SCP-8020 will be provided with recreational items that do not contain prohibited materials.\n\nAny personnel handling SCP-8020 are to be stripped of any electronics or metallic objects. Exceptions may be made by the head researcher.\n\nAs of August 2001, efforts to fulfill the Foundation's primary [[footnote]] Explanation: \"The Foundation recognizes its place within the scientific community.

The entity, first measuring approximately two meters in height and 300 kilograms in weight, has steadily grown since its recovery in March 2001. A significant portion of its anatomy has been replaced with mechanical analogs, including multiple organ systems. While the conversion of its organic components to their bronze counterparts is undeniable, the exact nature of its spread remains unknown.\n\nSCP-8020 has been designated a Class-4 Regenerator [[footnote]] Class-4: Matter-dependent regenerator.[[/footnote]] and is capable of completely regenerating lost or damaged structures via the consumption of metallic and/or organic matter. Consumed matter is assimilated into SCP-8020’s anatomy with a high level of conservation and is even capable of preserving the functionality of integrated technological devices and foreign organic matter.\n\nDespite showing signs of human-like cognizance, SCP-8020 is incapable of producing coherent sentences, instead communicating with Foundation personnel solely through garbled electronic transmissions and nonsensical, emulated speech. The entity has a volatile temperament, frequently experiencing bouts of unprompted aggression, distress, or panic. Attempts to mitigate these behaviors have been unsuccessful.\n\nAs a result of multiple containment breaches within a short time frame, SCP-8020 is currently being investigated for additional anomalous capabilities and has been reclassified from Euclid to Keter in the interim.\n[[/==]]\n-----\n[[==]]\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Breach Report #1]]\n**Cause of Breach:** Lock mechanism failure.\n\n**Overview:** Following routine cell maintenance by engineers, SCP-8020-13's chamber lock mechanism was swapped with a faulty replacement. After discovering this, SCP-8020-13 attempted to open the door. Upon successfully doing so, -13 would begin to wander the halls of the Euclid Containment Wing before reaching the Safe Containment Wing. Security teams were alerted thirty minutes after the fact via a manual alarm initiation. By the time security personnel arrived to escort SCP-8020-13 back to its chamber, the humanoid was found interacting with SCP-8020-5 before accidentally assimilating it via unknown methods.\n\nSCP-8020-5 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n**Notes:** Post-breach, SCP-8020-13 was observed possessing scale-like growths along its entire torso region. Following a full-panel SAED[[footnote]]Standard Anomalous Energy Diagnostic: A generalized diagnostic procedure to measure alterations in various anomalous signatures including Humes, Akiva, EVE, etc. Typically performed monthly.[[/footnote]], SCP-8020-13 was noted to have a slight reality anchoring effect in its immediate vicinity. Further testing is pending.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Breach Report #4]]\n**Cause of Breach:** Overt sabotage by third party.\n\n**Overview:** An infiltrator, operating under the pseudonym \"Cassie McLaren\" within the Security Department, used their clearance card to deliberately release SCP-8020 during an ongoing containment breach of another SCP object. McLaren, seemingly cognizant of the previous breach attempt, would guide SCP-8020-13 towards the holding chest of SCP-8020-8. After the humanoid assimilated with the object, the infiltrator attempted to escape before the facility's automated service system was able to alert security forces of their suspicious behavior. After an hour of searching, agents were able to capture and interrogate the infiltrator.\n\nSCP-8020-8 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n**Notes (1):** Infiltrator resisted questioning and appeared unaffected by the administration of mind-influencing compounds. POI held no notable form of ID aside from a moving copper ring in the shape of a snake.\n\n**Notes (2):** Post-breach, SCP-8020-13 was witnessed possessing horn-like features. Radios within the vicinity were observed to become disrupted.\n\n**Notes (3):** Audio recordings during the breach had shown SCP-8020-13 repeatedly asking the infiltrator if it would take them to its creator. As of now, its supposed creator is unknown.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Breach Report #9]]\n**Cause of Breach:** Overt sabotage by SCP subject (memetic).\n\n**Overview:** SCP-8020-13 managed to escape containment by sabotaging the radios of a nearby guard control and broadcasting an unknown memetic hazard. Hazard resulted in the guard appearing enthralled with SCP-8020-13, whereby it would release the humanoid. As SCP-8020-13 continued to wander the facility, more personnel were infected by the audiohazard. Automated Service System declared a sector-wide lockdown and an immediate deployment request for MTF H-10 (\"See No Evil\") and mobilization of on-site Tactical Response Teams. MTF H-10 severed communications within the facility while Response Team \"FLAIL\" began detaining affected suspects. SCP-8020-13 managed to evade capture for sixty minutes before eventually being tracked and located by MTF H-10. Prior to re-containment, the instance was found gnawing on SCP-8020-1 before completely assimilating it.\n\nSCP-8020-1 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n**Notes:** Post-breach, an interview with SCP-8020-13 resulted in it reciting several pieces of classified Foundation strategic data. Furthermore, SCP-8020-13 purported mild gastric discomfort despite a lack of appropriate nerve cells within the region.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Breach Report #12]]\n**Cause of Breach:** Remote Door Override\n\n**Overview:** SCP-8020-13 managed to escape containment following a remote override of the door systems. The origin and nature of the override was unknown. No logs of the occurrence could be retrieved from the Automatic Service System. Several doors would begin to initiate lockdown procedures, preventing security personnel from responding whilst also guiding SCP-8020-13 toward SCP-8020-10. Upon arrival, SCP-8020-10 would consume the oil held within.\n\nCameras would observe SCP-8020-13 collapsing and beginning to convulse as bronze growths began to expand at an accelerating rate. During this event, SCP-8020-13 is thought to have gained upwards of 25 tons of additional mass alongside 5 extra feet of height. Audio recording devices picked up a mixture of wailing sounds (interspersed with calls for its creator) and proclamations about its hunger. SCP-8020-13 would proceed to wander the facility and consume any metal in its sight. This includes, but is not limited to, bulkhead containment doors, wiring, weaponry, and containment equipment. The influx of mass resulted in SCP-8020-13 growing further at an even more accelerated rate, further causing an uneven distribution of mass which put considerable anatomical stress on SCP-8020-13.\n\nAs a result of the excessive damage, a containment breach cascade would occur. The service system noted that 8 additional objects had escaped containment, which coincided with a complete rescission of all lockdown overrides. In response, a state of emergency would be declared and MTF E-11 (\"Nine-Tailed Fox\") would be dispatched to support on-site combative elements and resecure the facility. After 4 hours, all 8 escaped subjects (alongside SCP-8020-13) would be re-contained. Upwards of 35 casualties of on-site personnel were reported, of which 13 were KIA.\n\nSCP-8020-10 has been classified as neutralized.\n\n**Notes (1):** SCP-8020-13 has begun to continuously generate additional mass, resulting in the object appearing considerably malformed. Distressed, SCP-8020-13 was observed to begin self-mutilating to try and control these growths. At several points, the self-mutilation required the intervention of security teams. A request for a psychological evaluation is pending.\n\n**Notes (2):** Following the neutralization of all known SCP-8020 items, SCP-8020-13 has been redesignated as SCP-8020 by RAISA authorities.\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/==]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n> +++ ADDENDUM-8000.1: Prediction #2014-001\n\n[[div class=\"code\"]]\n+++ THE PROPHET HAS SEEN INTO THE FUTURE.\n\n= 5 14 4 15 18 8 5 9 3\n\n= ARAL WILL DRY, SAND WILL SEE THE SUN.\n\n= ALPHA, DELTA, WHISKEY.\n\n= SOLDIERS DONNING HELMETS MADE OF SKY WILL WALK THE FLATS.\n\n= 3 15 1 12 9 20 9 15 14 9 19 20\n\n= THEY WILL FIND THE GRAVE OF A MONARCH.\n\n= ROMEO, ECHO, DELTA.\n\n= IGNORANT, THEY WILL TRY TO DESTROY IT.\n\n= 3 15 12 12 1 16 19 5\n\n= THE PARADIGM WILL SHIFT.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[==]]\nYou had failed.\n\nWhat more was there to be said?

It divulged information about an anomalous artifact that they would discover and attempt to terminate: a statue.\n\n**ADMIN:** An investigation was opened and remained open until three weeks ago. It would be closed for a lack of evidence.\n\n**ADMIN:** Last week, we received an emergency communication requesting that Foundation assets support Coalition operations inside of ADW-01 [[footnote]] Anomaly Disposal Wells: Coalition locations dedicated for the processing of anomalous entities too large, unorthodox, and/or resilient, to perform a field termination on [[/footnote]].\n\n**ADMIN:** Tactical Response agents from Site-03 and Site-19 were deployed to the location, with MTF-Nu-7 [[footnote]] Mobile Task Force Nu-7 (\"Hammer Down\") [[/footnote]] on standby. After about six hours, Foundation and Coalition agents were able to suppress the situation.\n\n**ADMIN:** Since then, SCP-8020 has made 40 additional predictions.

When he caught onto your staring, he'd stammer before correcting his attitude.\n\nYou began to squint--then your eyes widened. You felt your face run cold.

You fell asleep at your desk again. For the past several years, it was the closest thing you could call a bed.

You allow yourself to stew amongst your self-pity for several minutes--you've earned that right. However, the buzzing of your mobile seems to disagree. Lifting it up, your eyes adjust to the blinding screen: an email. A sigh escapes your lips, and then a rolling groan overtakes it.\n\nWith a heavy finger, you press against the power button of your terminal. The start-up messages rush right past you and the lights of your desktop flush your face in the token whites, blacks, and dull yellows of the facility's operating system.

Exceptions may be made by a ruling body of Level-5 clearance assigned to the SCP-8020 project, or any member of the O5 Council.\n\nAs of January 2014, SCP-8020 has been reclassified from Keter to Thaumiel and its clearance requisite has been amended appropriately.[[/==]]\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n> +++ **DESCRIPTION**\n[[/=]]\n[[==]]\nSCP-8020 is the designation given to the heavily altered remains of █████ ██████, currently 12 meters tall and weighing 140 tons, which has been significantly transformed by the extensive mechanical augmentations responsible for its prolonged existence. Now designated a Terminarch-Class entity [[footnote]] Terminarch: The last remaining subinstance of a once more prolific anomaly.[[/footnote]] and Class-7 Regenerator [[footnote]] Class-7: Error-Prone Overgrowth. Originally speculated to have been a purely restorative process, however, the production of material now continues even in the absence of injury.[[/footnote]], SCP-8020 is perpetually growing in size and complexity, generating profound quantities of bronze components and poorly differentiated organic matter daily.\n\nDespite multiple attempts to regulate its growth, SCP-8020’s anatomy has become increasingly deformed by progressive gigantism and self-mutilation. Superficially resembling the Persian manticore, disproportionate allocations of mass have resulted in grotesque elongation of the spine and neck, along with the formation of numerous ornamental structures, including flightless wings, horns, and a tail. No longer capable of supporting a vertical posture, the extent of SCP-8020’s size and alteration have forced the subject into a quadrupedal gait.\n\nThe subject’s identifiable organic components, consisting only of the skull, nervous system, and scattered tissue fragments, remain intact but heavily distorted to fit SCP-8020’s extreme anatomy. Blood continuously seeps from crevices in SCP-8020’s exterior plating and is hypothesized to assist in cooling and lubricating its various components. The functionality of SCP-8020’s central nervous system has demonstrated a slow but irreversible decline in recent years - despite continued animation of the construct, attempts to differentiate the subject’s consciousness from digital emulations have been inconclusive.\n\nWhile initially adverse to its augmentations, SCP-8020 has slowly come to conceptualize its transformation as a form of human transcendence, likening it to GOI-004B’s practice of “Standardization”. Since its reclassification to Thaumiel, the subject has become enamored with its mechanical state, actively shaping the growth of its components and referring to itself as a fragment of the Church’s namesake deity, “MEKHANE”. While efforts conducted by the Division of Para-anthropology have found little in the way of suggesting that the automaton is the Broken God, SCP-8020 possesses several attributes that appear to be consistent with its delusions of grandeur (most notably its robust predictive faculties) and are believed to stem from paratechnological components found within it. These components have been designated as sub-instances (SCP-8020-1 to SCP-8020-13)\n[[/==]]\n[[==]]\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-1]]\nIn the absence of a large and small intestinal tract [[footnote]] The absence of the gallbladder, liver, and pancreas have also been observed within SCP-8020's body cavity.

Their continued method of operation, despite the immense internal temperature of SCP-8020, is unknown. As of 29/12/2022, engineers and technical researchers were able to extract heavily encrypted data from all catalogs. However, AIC-assisted cryptanalysis has yet to yield any viable results.\n\nThis broad dataset has been utilized to its fullest extent by SCP-8020's processors, allowing it to generate highly detailed predictive models. These models have successfully been used as an early alert system, predicting 162 significant incidents with 97% accuracy since 2001.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-5]]\nSeveral plated scales that completely cover the torso of SCP-8020. Initially disregarded as a mundane facet, mass spectrometry has allowed researchers to discover that the scales are not derived from a standard bronze alloy. Rather, the scales are made up of beryllium bronze that are complimented by unknown runes. Now designated SCP-8020-5, they appear to protect SCP-8020 from the effects of reality warping. Applications are pending.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-8]]\nInitially purely decorative, SCP-8020's horns (designated SCP-8020-8) have recently become the source of a potent beta-type audiohazard [[footnote]] Beta: Persuasive/Mind-affecting.

First observed during Incident-8945.3, the audiohazard in question appears to only be effective on subjects with a mind-affecting resistance score (MARS) of, or below, 5 out of 10. Subjects affected by the audiohazard appear enthralled with SCP-8020 (to the point of religious zealotry) and proselytizing fantastical, albeit entirely fabricated, stories centering around the entity.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-10]]\nSCP-8020 possesses a potent genotoxic venom (designated SCP-8020-10) that is administered either via fangs or contact with the apex of one of its many serrated protrusions along the dewlap and spine. Oral venom sacs appear to have replaced salivary glands, whilst spinal and dewlapine sacs are located in an analogous hypodermic region. Subdermal injection of SCP-8020-10 results in the rapid replacement of most visible organic tissue with bronze as a result of an anomalous chromosomal aberration which alters and replaces the production of collagen I with the latter. It is important to consider that SCP-8020 has previously referred to this process as “Standardization”, a phrase used by GOI-004B to denote submission in preparation for anomalous enhancement.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab SCP-8020-13]]\nA protective layer made of ivory.
