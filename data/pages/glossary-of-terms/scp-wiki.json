  "title": "Glossary Of Terms",
  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nThis page is a collaborative resource defining terms commonly used on the site or in the community. While erring on the side of inclusion and open to contributions from any site member, new terms should not be added to this page unless they've been used in published articles on the site more than once. While you don't have to cite sources, remember that links to articles that go into more detail can be very useful to people unfamiliar with specific terms. An important caveat is that these terms may not always be used consistently, that's just inevitable when we have so many different canons and alternate interpretations on the site.\n\nTerms defined elsewhere ([[[object classes]]], [[[personnel-and-character-dossier|characters]]], [[[locations-of-interest|specific locations]]], [[[groups of interest]]]) are omitted from this list to avoid redundancy. If you're not sure whether a term warrants inclusion, want to clarify a proposed definition, or think a definition already on this page should be amended, post in the discussion thread for this page to get feedback first. Feel free to comment on other people's suggestions and additions, if you think you have something useful to add!\n\nThe page is ordered alphabetically, but terms are organised into multiple sections, with synonyms listed together. If you're looking for a specific term, you can quickly search this list using your browser's \"Find In Page\" option (Keyboard shortcut ctrl + F or cmd + F).\n\n[[toc]]\n\n+ In-Universe Terms\nSpecialized vocabulary that may be used in SCP articles, tales and GoI formats.\n\n++ Article Format\nListed by typical order of appearance in an SCP article.\n* **Item #** -- The numeric identifier for the SCP. Note that the formal name of an SCP is always \"SCP-####\", and not its number alone (\"SCP-173\", not \"173\"), although the number on its own is often used informally.\n* **[[[object-classes|Object Class]]]** -- A system of categorization based on the difficulty of containing the entity or object. See the [[[Object Classes]]] guide for more information, and definitions of the most commonly used object classes (Safe, Euclid, Keter), as well as some less commonly used object classes (including Thaumiel, Neutralized and Apollyon). [[[esoteric-classes-complete-list| More esoteric object classes]]] may replace these, and supplementary classification systems may be used (such as adding a **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level]**, or using the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], which replaces \"Object Class\" with \"Containment Class\").\n* **Special Containment Procedures** (**SCP**) -- Instructions to be followed to keep the entity or object contained. May be truncated to \"S. C. Procedures\" or referred to informally as \"conprocs\".\n* **Description** -- The section of an SCP article that explains in a clear and concise way what the entity or object does, and why it is contained. The description can be supplemented by one or more addenda, but you should be able to understand the basic function through the Description alone.\n* **Addendum** -- (//Plural: addenda//) A section of an SCP article that either expands on specific aspects of the Description, shows the progression of information over time, or otherwise provides additional information that does not fit into the Description. Addenda can be posted on the main page or in separate **[[[incident-reports-eye-witness-interviews-and-personal-logs| supplement]]]** pages, and can include [/system:page-tags/tag/experiment Experiment Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/exploration Exploration Logs], [/system:page-tags/tag/incident Incident Reports] or [/system:page-tags/tag/interview Interviews].\n\n++ Foundation Terminology\nOther terms used in Foundation documents to describe their own personnel, facilities and containment procedures.\n* **[[[o5-command-dossier| The Administrator]]]** -- Mysterious figure in-universe, may (or may not) have been the Founder of the SCP Foundation. Possibly a member of the **O5 Council**, possibly the overall leader of the Foundation. Inspired by FritzWillie, the [[[an-interview-with-the-administrator| person who brought the SCP Wiki to Wikidot]]], as he used an account simply called \"The Administrator\" to create and run the new website.\n* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| agent]]]** -- An undercover Foundation field agent, typically capitalized when used as a title (e.g. Agent Smith). Note that not all field personnel employed by the Foundation are necessarily \"agents\" in this sense, nor do all such personnel have the title \"Agent\". See also: **containment team**, **response team**, **Mobile Task Force**, and **researcher**.\n* **[[[log-of-anomalous-items| Anomalous Item]]]**/**Anomalous Object** (**AO**) -- An object with **anomalous** properties too minor to warrant **Special Containment Procedures** or further research.\n* **anomaly**/**anomalous** -- Foundation term for the objects they contain and research. Generally defined as anything that cannot be explained by current scientific knowledge, behaving in a manner contrary to otherwise universal laws and principles. See also **paranormal** and **anahuman**.\n* **Area** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations#area| Foundation Facility]]] completely unknown to the public.\n* **Contained Person of Interest** (**CPoI**) -- A **Person of Interest** the Foundation has captured and contained. Usually is an anomalous human (**anahuman**) [[[scp-6703|whose properties are too minor]]] to warrant **Special Containment Procedures**, and as such have more priviliges than a **SCP entity**.\n* **containment breach** -- Term used when an SCP object escapes containment. Could involve physically breaking out of a **containment chamber**, could also mean spread of knowledge about it outside of the Foundation.\n* **containment chamber** -- A room dedicated to the containment of an SCP object.\n* **containment team** -- Field personnel specializing in recovering or retrieving anomalous objects or entities. Members may or may not be field agents as well, but usually have a different title, such as \"Containment Specialist\". See also **agent** and **response team**.\n* **[DATA EXPUNGED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site. While often used interchangably with **[REDACTED]**, specifying that information has been \"expunged\" indicates that it has been permanently deleted from the records, typically because the information poses a hazard in and of itself, e.g. if it's a **memetic** hazard. \n* **D Class** -- Foundation employees deemed expendable if necessary for testing or containment. Typically consist of prison inmates recruited by the Foundation for this purpose. See the [[[Security Clearance Levels]]] guide for more information, as well as the relevant [[[ethics-committee-class-d-housing-regulations|Ethics Committee Regulations]]]. \n* **[[[departments| department]]]** -- Organisations within the Foundation that specialize in a specific task, discipline or field.\n* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| director]]]** -- The head of a Foundation **Facility** or **Department**. Typically capitalised when used as a title (e.g. Director Jones).\n* **Disruption Class** -- Part of the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], the Disruption Class refers to an anomaly's ability to disturb the status quo or break **the Veil** if uncontained. In ascending order, these are Dark, Vlam, Keneq, Ekhi and Amida.\n* **[[[scp-ex|Explained]]]** (**EX**) -- A sub-class of SCP object that has either been debunked as a hoax, sufficiently understood so as to be normal scientific knowledge, or so widely disseminated that containment is no longer possible.\n* **[[[log-of-extranormal-events| Extranormal Events]]]** (**EE**) -- Anomalous events that occurred too briefly to be contained.\n* **[[[secure-facilities-locations|Facility]]]** -- A generic term used to refer to both **[[[secure-facilities-locations#site| Sites]]]** and **[[[secure-facilities-locations#area| Areas]]]**.\n* **The Foundation** -- A secret organization that contains **anomalous** objects, entities, and phenomena through the creation of **Special Containment Procedures**. Only rarely referred to as the \"SCP Foundation\" in-universe, usually just \"The Foundation\".\n* **[[[locations-of-interest#free-port| Free Port]]]** (**FP**) -- A larger and more formally recognised type of **[[[locations-of-interest#nexus| Nexus]]]**, an area that is inherently anomalous and entirely behind the **Veil**. This means that there is no need to try to conceal the existence of the **anomalous** from the people who live there, since they all already know.\n* **[[[a-semi-comprehensive-list-of-foundation-fronts| front]]]** -- An organisation used as a cover for the Foundation's activities, allowing agents of the Foundation to operate in public. Fronts may have a name that can be abbreviated as \"SCP\", such as Spicy Crust Pizzeria or [[[the-s-c-plastics-hub | S&C Plastics]]] - see [[[pickman-blank-proposal| The Frontispiece]]] for more information about this practice.\n* **[[[Groups of Interest]]]** (**GoI**) -- A Group of Interest is an organisation other than the Foundation that is aware of the anomalous.\n* **HMCL Supervisor** -- Responsible for managing the containment of one or more anomalies. The actual meaning of \"HMCL\" is debatable, however, most users conclude it to be \"**Hazardous Materials Containment Liaison**\".\n* **[[[k-class-complete-list| K-Class Scenario/K-Class Event]]]** -- Hypothetical situations with drastic effects on normality or reality. The most well-known K-Class Event, the XK-Class Event, typically denotes a catastrophic event resulting in the destruction of human society, if not the entire human species, but various other scenarios have their own designations, used with varying consistency across different articles.\n* **[[[Locations of Interest]]]** (**LoI**) -- A Location of Interest is an area with anomalous properties, often inhabited by a permanent community and requiring a more diplomatic approach to their containment. See also **Unexplained Location**, **Nexus** and **Free Port**.\n* **[[[task-forces|Mobile Task Force]]]** (**MTF**) -- A highly-trained and specialized team that is deployed in the field by the Foundation to deal with specific threats or conditions. Mobile Task Forces are designated by a Greek letter and a number (e.g. \"MTF Alpha-7\", \"MTF Omega-15\") and may have a nickname attached, similar to many real-life military units. MTFs are the elite personnel of the Foundation, and run the gamut from highly experienced field researchers to combat-hardened troops, with each MTF specialising in a different scenario or class of anomaly. Other types of Task Force also exist.\n* **[[[locations-of-interest#nexus| Nexus]]]** (**Nx**) -- An actively anomalous location supporting a permanent community. Originally defined and listed [[[nexus-series|here]]].\n* **[[[o5-command-dossier| O5 Council]]]**/**Overseer Council** (**O5**) -- short for the \"Council of Observers, Level 5\" or the \"Overseer Level 5 Council\". The highest authority in the Foundation and the leading body of **Overwatch Command**, a council of 12 or 13 individuals who have the power to authorize or veto any action taken by the Foundation as a whole. O5 Council members are only known by their numbers (O5-1 through O5-13), are rarely involved in day-to-day Foundation activities, and are typically not allowed to contact any SCP objects directly for fear of contamination. Note that it's a capital letter \"o\", not the number zero.\n* **Overwatch Command**/**O5 Command** -- The highest administrative department of the Foundation, headquartered in [[[secure-facilities-locations|Site-01]]]. Although often used to refer solely to the **O5 Council**, Overwatch Command is the name of the Foundation's general central authority, composed of the most high-ranking personnel and the Overseer's closest staff (e.g [[[task-forces#alpha-1|MTF Alpha-1]]]). Along with the Council, it manages and supervises the rest of all other **Facilities** and **Departments**.\n* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| Person of Interest]]]** (**PoI**) -- An individual that the Foundation is investigating or observing due to their involvement with the anomalous. May have anomalous abilities, have had contact with an **SCP object**, or be a member of a **Group of Interest**. \n* **[REDACTED]** -- One of the two types of censorship used on the site. Something that is \"redacted\" is withheld from the article because the reader is not cleared to see the information, but would be made available to someone else with a higher **Security Clearance Level** or on a need-to-know basis. See also **[DATA EXPUNGED]**.\n* **[[[personnel-and-character-dossier| researcher]]]** -- A broad term for anyone involved in research and development at the Foundation - they may be referred to as a Researcher, Technician, Doctor or Professor, depending on their qualifications and specialty. Researchers can be involved in anything from figuring out how an anomalous object or entity functions to developing better materials and containment procedures. Field researchers may also accompany containment teams to assess the nature of uncontained anomalies.\n* **response team** -- A heavily armed team trained to deal with security or containment breaches, typically at a secure Foundation site. Response team members are also sent into the field to escort containment teams when dealing with highly hostile or dangerous objects or entities, or when enemy [[[Groups of Interest]]] are involved. \n* **Risk Class** -- Part of the [[[anomaly-classification-system-guide| Anomaly Classification System]]], the Risk Class refers to the severity of an anomaly's effects on an individual person, and how easily one can recover from it. In ascending order, these are Notice, Caution, Warning, Danger and Critical.\n* **SCiPNET** -- Alternatively capitalised as SCiPNet or SCiPnet. The Foundation's intranet and inter-site database, used for sending emails between employees and for accessing SCP files and other documents. \n* **SCP** -- An [https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialism initialism] for \"Special Containment Procedures\", and used informally as a short-form of \"SCP article\", as in, \"I wrote three SCPs yesterday\". SCP objects or entities are not formally referred to as \"an SCP\" or \"the SCP\" in-universe, although characters might do so informally, even using casual pronunciations like \"scip\" or \"skip\". Note that \"SCP\" is //not// an initialism for \"Secure, Contain, Protect\"; the motto of the Foundation is a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] derived from \"SCP\".\n* **SCP object**/**SCP entity** -- An anomaly assigned its own **Special Containment Procedures**. May also be referred to as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-56 Special Containment Projects (SCPs).]\n* **[[[security-clearance-levels| Security Clearance Level]]]** -- Specifies the information that a Foundation employee is authorized to know, ranging from 1 (very limited) to 5 (beyond top secret).\n* **Site** -- A type of [[[secure-facilities-locations#site| Foundation Facility]]] disguised behind a mundane front (e.g. as a corporation or government office).\n* **Site Director's Executive Committee of the Whole**/**Site Director's Executive Council of the Whole** (**SDECotW**) -- A gathering of Foundation **Site** Directors, serving as the Foundation's penultimate administrative authority, one step down from the **O5 Council**.\n* **Species of Interest** (**SoI**) -- Non-human species with anomalous properties. \n* **[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/niveaux-de-menace-des-objets-scp Threat Level]** -- A complimentary system to the object classes, assigning each anomaly a color code based on the danger it would pose if containment was breached. The threat levels, in ascending order, are White, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red and Black.\n* **Unclassified Anomalous Entity** (**UAE**) -- An anomalous entity too minor to have **Special Containment Procedures**, most commonly used on anomalies generated by a **[[[locations-of-interest#nexus| Nexus]]]**. Usually, nexus UAE's are additionally designated with a codeword signifying their locations (e.g UAE-Chapman for [[[locations-of-interest#sloths-pit|Nx-18: Sloth's Pit]]], UAE-Fowke for [[[locations-of-interest#lake-huron|Nx-94: Lake Huron]]], etc.) \n* **Undesignated Anomaly**/**Unregistered Anomaly** (**UA**/**URA**) -- An anomalous entity that has not yet been assigned Special Containment Procedures. A temporary designation, prior to full documentation as an SCP object.  \n* **[[[log-of-unexplained-locations| Unexplained Location]]]** (**UE**) -- A specific place where anomalous phenomena too minor to be assigned **Special Containment Procedures** occur. See also **Locations of Interest**, as well as **Nexus** and **Free Port** for inhabited anomalous locations.\n\n++ Anomalous Science\nTerms used by the Foundation and by other groups to describe and categorise the anomalous.\n* **acroamatic abatement** -- The processing of anomalous waste products and esoteric substances produced by anomalies into non-anomalous industrial effluent. See [[[acroamatic-abatement| Everything You Need to Know About Acroamatic Abatement But Were Too Confused by the Name to Ask]]] for an elaboration.\n* **Akiva Field**/**Akiva Radiation** -- An anomalous field that fluctuates based on human belief and divine intervention, possible to measure and quantify in centiAkiva (cÁ/cAk) or [[[a-brief-introduction-to-thaumaturgical-engineering|Steiners (⊕)]]]. High levels of Akiva radiation correlate with the divine presence in a location, the piety of an individual, and the religious significance of objects. Named after a Jewish scholar and religious leader, the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbi_Akiva Rabbi Akiva]. See the [[[tactical-theology-hub|Tactical Theology Hub]]] and the [[[Akiva Counter Operating Instructions]]] for more information.\n* **anahuman**/**parahuman**/**superhuman** -- A human being with anomalous properties or abilities.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/antimemetic antimemetic]** -- Antimemes (also known as counterconcepts) are ideas which, by their intrinsic nature, discourage or prevent people from spreading them. The Foundation has an [[[antimemetics-division-hub| Antimemetics Division]]] investigating and containing anomalous antimemes.\n* **Apex Tier [[[divine-dossier| Pluripotent Entity]]]** -- An incredibly powerful anomalous entity, possibly omnipotent. Generally used as a clinical term for a god (although not all divine beings will be \"Apex Tier\"). May or may not also be a **pistiphage**.\n* **Aspect Radiation (ARad)** -- **EVE** emissions intense enough to alter reality - the basis of applied **thaumatology**.\n* **backlash** -- Random alterations to reality caused as a side-effect of **thaumaturgy**.\n* **bozomorphic** — Clinical term for anomalous entities resembling clowns.

Also known as a Cognitohazardous Resistance Score, Cognitohazard Resistance Value, Mental Resistance Score, Mind-Affecting Resistance Score (MARS) or Psychic Resistance Score, each measured using the corresponding scale.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/cognitohazard cognitohazard]** -- A term used to refer to objects that are dangerous to perceive. This could occur through any or all of the human senses, including sight, sound, smell, taste, or touch. Differs from an **infohazard** in that simply being informed about a **cognitohazard** has no anomalous effect. See also **memetics** and **hermeneutic**.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/ectoentropic ectoentropic]** -- Entities or objects that produce energy or matter in an unexplained way, in apparent violation of the First and Second [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laws_of_thermodynamics Laws of Thermodynamics], which specify that energy (which includes matter) cannot be created (or destroyed), and that entropy (the disorder of a system) must always increase over time.\n* **Elan-Vital Energy** (**EVE**) -- Mysterious energy emitted from living beings and sapient anomalies that can power **thaumatology**. See [[[goc-supplemental-arad|this lecture]]] for more information.

See the [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|FAQ]]] for more information. Named for the philosopher [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Hume David Hume].\n* **infoallergenic** -- An uncommon class of infohazard, capable of exhibiting both **memetic** and **antimemetic** properties. See also **pretermemetic**.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/infohazard infohazard]** -- A term used to refer to objects that have an anomalous effect whenever they are referred to or described. Differs from a **cognitohazard** in that cognitohazards require the anomalous phenomenon to be directly perceived, whereas infohazards may be spread indirectly, simply through people telling each other about them. Because of this, the effects of **infohazards** are often **memetic**. See [[[memetics-and-infohazards-division-orientation| this orientation]]] for more information.\n* **kinetohazard**/**kinetoglyphs** -- anomalous mental and physical effects that occur when an entity performs specific gestures and movements.\n* **Knock** -- An action or requirement that enables the opening of a **Way**.

Distinct from regular **psionics** for its ability to [[[scp-2803|control electronic devices]]], though various other capabilities have also been observed, such as [[[dyfscp-001|regenerative healing]]]. Can be suppresed through the use of a [[[scp-4922|Naismith-Henderson Lambda Wave Sink]]].\n* **Large-Scale Aggressor** (**LSA**) -- Clinical term for a giant monster.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/memetic memetic]** - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme Memes] are the basic units of culture, ideas or behaviours that can be transmitted to others through communication or imitation. In the context of the Foundation, memetic effects are a sub-class of **cognitohazards** and **infohazards** that deal with the transfer of information. Ideas and concepts with anomalous memetic properties can spread much more effectively than non-anomalous memes, and may have anomalous effects on anyone exposed to them. Creators and users of anomalous memetic effects may be referred to as memeticists or cryptomancers. See [[[Understanding Memetics]]] and [[[memetics-and-infohazards-division-orientation| this orientation]]] for more information.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/metamorphic metamorphic]**/**polymorphic** -- Clinical term for shapeshifters, entities that alter their own form or appearance.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/mimetic mimetic]** -- entities capable of anomalous mimicry of another creature or object.\n* **narrativistics** -- A meta-meta framework for understanding and justifying the presence of conflicting models in the same system. Utilizes aspects of holographic theory, extended modal realism, narratology, mechanical determinism, and absurdism to suggest our reality may be part of an infinitely nesting loop of complex storytelling. See [[[Narrativistics And You]]] for more information. See also **pataphysics**.\n* **narrativohazard** -- A construct of independent, individual units of narratives (known as **narremes**) that collectively destroys stories they are part of.\n* **[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narreme narreme]** -- The basic unit of a narrative, much like **memes** are the basic units of a culture.\n* **non-Euclidean** -- Refers to spaces possessing geometry that is inconsistent with [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_geometry Euclid's postulates]. While mathematicians use \"non-Euclidian\" to refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-Euclidean_geometry other types of explainable geometry], including hyperbolic and elliptic geometry, the Foundation typically uses the term to refer to anomalous geometries that should not be physically possible.\n* **noogenesis** -- Clinical term for the formation of a new consciousness.\n* **[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noosphere Noosphere]** --  The realm of collective human thought, encompassing dreams, concepts and ideas. [[[the-wild-light| May]]] or [[[scp-6820| may not]]] generate and conceptually encompass multiple omniverses and/or be [[[intro-aux-anomalies-narratives | a primary source of pataphysical phenomena.]]]\n* **ontokinesis**/**ontokinetic** -- Clinical term for **reality bending**. Derived from the philosophical term [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology Ontology], the study of being and the most general features of reality, with ontokinesis meaning \"control over being\".\n* **paranormal**/**paranatural**/**preternatural** -- alternative terms used to describe phenomena that the Foundation categorises as **anomalous**. Anomalous phenomena may also be referred to as esoteric, occult, supernatural or transmundane.\n* **[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/system:page-tags/tag/pataphysics-dept pataphysics]**/**'pataphysics** -- The scientific study of fictional narratives and their effect on reality, including the study of the fictional SCP universe by characters that are part of it. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/'Pataphysics 'Pataphysics] was originally proposed as a parody of science, being one step up from metaphysics and defined as the study of imaginary solutions. See the [[[intro-aux-anomalies-narratives | Narrative Anomalies Orientation]]] for more information. See also **narrativistics**.\n* **psionics** -- The generation and detection of supernatural phenomena solely through the power of the mind, including telekinesis, telepathy, precognition and clairvoyance, abilities that may also be referred to as extra-sensory perception (ESP). The scientific study of psionics is known as parapsychology or as psychotronics, with the later term mostly being used in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Individuals with psionic abilities may be known as psions, psychics, psykers, mentalists or espers. [[[SCP-7669|Psiophone]]], devices capable of measuring telepathic signals and projections and converting them into electrical signals, are often used to decrypt psionic data. See [[[psi-guide-1| this lecture series]]] for more information.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/pattern-screamer Pattern Screamer]** -- Consciousnesses embedded within the fabric of reality. These entities do not exist, although they may have existed at some point in the past, and may be brought into existence if perceived. Also known as [[[pattern-dwellers-an-expose| Pattern Dwellers]]] or [[[scp-8212|Usinsk-Class Ideoforms]]]. It is possible that their nature is quite different from what was previously believed, and [[[divine-dossier#toc9|even encompass Rakmou-leusan,]]] a powerful but similarly ailing god with a still-high degree of being able to be drawn upon for abilities in baseline reality.\n* **pistiphage** -- An entity that feeds on faith, deriving sustenance and power from belief and worship. Often used as a clinical term for a god, a pistiphage may also be a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tulpa Tulpa] or [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egregore Egregore], only existing because people believe in it. An **Apex Tier Pluripotent Entity** may or may not also be a pistiphage.\n* **pretermemetic** -- Information that is selectively **memetic** or **anti-memetic** depending on the nature of the recipients or circumstances. Used by groups such as [[[dread-circuses-hub| Herman Fuller's Circus of the Disquieting]]] to advertise without attracting the attention of organisations like the Foundation. See also **infoallergenic**.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/reality-bending reality bending]**/**reality warping** -- The anomalous ability to alter reality. May be referred to as **ontokinesis**, **essokinesis**, or simply as magic, although **thaumaturgy** is generally regarded as something separate. Humanoid reality benders may be referred to as \"Type Greens\" using [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]], or as [[[scp-3241| \"ontokineticists\"]]], [[[grasp-on-reality| \"bixbies\"]]], [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| \"Outside Observers\"]]] or [[[grant-request-for-the-manufacture-of-devices-to-regulate|\"Objective-Reality Independent persons\"]]]. See [[[and-this-one-explains-humes|this FAQ]]], [[[clef101|this orientation]]] and [[[what-we-know-so-far-answering-the-question-of-what-how-and-w| this document]]] for more information.\n* **semiontological anomaly**/**semiohazard** -- Anomalies that disrupt the **semiosphere** to create universal axioms that should not be possible.\n* **semiosphere** -- The medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured.\n* **spectral entity** -- Clinical term for a [system:page-tags/tag/ghost ghost], spectre or spirit. May also be referred to as a posthumous entity, eidomorph or ectomorph (an entity made from ectoplasm). See [[[anatomy-of-a-specter| this document]]] and [[[welcome-to-spectral-affairs| this orientation]]] for more information.\n* **spectremetry** -- The scientific study of **spectral entities.**\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/surrealistics-dept surrealistics]** -- The scientific study of anomalies too incomprehensible or bizarre to understand, except through illogical thought and the use of **agnostics.** The term is a reference to the artistic movement of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrealism Surrealism].\n* **Tartarean Resonance Energy** (**TRE**) -- Radiation naturally produced by demonic entities. Named for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tartarus Tartarus], the part of the Greek Underworld where monsters and sinners were imprisoned.\n* **Tartarean-Class Demonic Entity**/**Tartarean Entity** -- Clinical term for a demon, which are traditionally defined as malevolent supernatural entities. See the [[[undervegas-hub|Undervegas Hub]]] for a summary of different classes of Tartarean Entities.\n* **[/system:page-tags/tag/thaumaturgy thaumaturgy]** -- A term meaning \"wonder-working\" and referring to magic, miracles and the occult. The scientific study of thaumaturgy is known as thaumatology, while the use of it is known as applied thaumatology. Magic users are formally referred to as thaumatologists, thaumaturges or \"Type Blues\" in [[[goc-supplemental-threat-entities| Global Occult Coalition terminology]]], although more archaic terms may also be used, including \"wizard\", \"sorcerer\" and \"mage\". When considered as distinct from **reality bending**, the phenomena studied by thaumatologists generally follow more predictable rules and limitations. See [[[goc-supplemental-thaumatology| this lecture]]], [[[another-goddamn-magic-system| this orientation]]], [[[sistema-taumaturgico| this document]]] and [[[A Brief Introduction to Thaumaturgical Engineering]]] for more information. \n* **tychekinesis** -- Clinical term for probability manipulation, named for the Greek goddess of fate and fortune, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyche Tyche].\n* **Way** -- An anomalous connection between two locations, enabling rapid travel between them regardless of distance.

A good example of this would be the exact strengths of the various classes of amnestics, or the precise nature of various K-class Events.\n* **hook** -- The aspect of your article or tale that catches your reader's attention and makes them want to keep reading until the end. A hook has to inspire some sort of curiosity or emotion in your reader; it doesn't necessarily have to be at the very beginning of your article, but it does have to be early enough to make a difference. A hook can also be the aspect of the article or tale that keeps a reader interested after they're done reading; this can take the form of an interesting revelation or twist ending, and tends to be closer to the end of the writing.\n* **Kalinin Threshold** -- Refers to the idea that SCP articles which do not reach a rating of +50 or more should be eventually deleted. Largely referenced as an inside joke within community spaces, and no member of Staff has ever considered to actually implement it in the Deletions Policy. Named after former author Kalinin, who mentioned the idea once in an off-hand remark, but otherwise never seriously proposed it.\n* **Kcon** -- An abbreviated way of writing \"Thousand Contest\", this is a type of **contest** held every time the current SCP **series** is nearly filled. The tradition started with the [[[scp1000contesthub | SCP-1000 contest]]] in 2011 to mark the opening of SCP slots 1000-1999, and has continued since then whenever each new series has nearly been filled. The entry with the most votes at the end of the contest is awarded the first slot in the new series (X000), while runners up are assigned to other slots of their choice in the new series.\n* **Keter duty** -- In-universe threats to demote personnel to Class D or otherwise assigning them to dangerous Keter-class objects as a form of punishment. Considered a type of **lolFoundation**.\n* **locked box test** -- An informal thought exercise often used to determine what **Object Class** on an object or entity ought to have. It is explained as such:\n * //If it's locked in a box indefinitely and nothing bad will happen, it's probably **Safe**-class.//\n * //If it's locked in a box and we have no idea what might happen, it's probably **Euclid**-class.//\n * //If it's locked into a box and eventually all hell will break loose, it's probably **Keter**-class.//\n * //If it// is //the box, then it is probably **Thaumiel** class.//\n* **lolFoundation** -- Additions to an SCP article that imply seriously unprofessional conduct among Foundation personnel, such as reckless misuse of dangerous anomalous objects, as well as threats of punishment for such behavior such as reassignment to \"Keter Duty\". While generally considered to be too unprofessional for a serious research organization, there is still [[[lolfoundation-hub-page| a place for it]]] on the site.\n * **NeololFoundation** — Refers to the shift of more humorous and light-hearted, as well as narrative- and character-based, articles in the modern days of the SCP Wiki. A reimagining of **lolFoundation**.\n* **Murder Monster** -- An inhuman entity that attacks and kills people. Although this term is often used dismissively, this is a classic type of SCP, going all the way back to [[[scp-173|the Original]]]. There are [/system:page-tags/tag/murder-monster many successful articles written about this kind of SCP], but new examples need more of a **hook** than just describing a scary monster that's dangerous to be around.\n* **sandbox stalking** -- The act of reading the **sandbox** pages of other authors for purposes other than critique, without their permission or knowledge. While not against the Site Rules, telling an author that you had covertly read their unpublished drafts could make them uncomfortable, as these pages often do not reflect the finished product. It is advised to not share the contents of an author's sandbox page to other users, nor to edit one's drafts without their explicit permission. Note that the term does not apply to members of **[https://05command.wikidot.com/maintenance-and-ancillary-staff-team-main MAST]**, who regularly clean the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/sandbox offical SCP sandbox wiki] for vandalism and offensive content.\n* **[[[spc-hub|SPC]]]** -- The Shark Punching Center. A [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym backronym] created to make fun of people who misspell \"SCP\" as \"SPC\" (e.g. \"I like the idea, but what does the Shark Punching Center have to do with it?\"), subsequently turned into a **Group of Interest**.\n* **Thing That Does A Thing** -- Inanimate objects with an anomalous property. While this is a common type of SCP, particularly for new authors writing their first article, this term is usually used as a reminder that the article needs a **hook** to hold the reader's interest. See [[[things-what-do-a-thing-an-essay-on-things | this essay]]] for advice on doing this well.\n* **Total Winner** -- Refers to articles that have reached a rating of +100 under 24 hours.\n* **Wikifot** -- Catch-all joke term used by the community to refer to the general technical issues our platform, Wikidot, occasionally runs into.\n\n----\n+ Additional Resources\n\nCanon Specific definitions of terms can be found on the following pages:\n* [[[Ad Astra Per Aspera Hub]]]\n* [[[aiad-homescreen|AIAD Homescreen]]]\n* [[[from-120-s-archives-hub|From 120's Archives Hub]]]\n* [[[third-law-hub| Third Law Hub]]]\n* [[[War On All Fronts - Hub]]]\n\nTerms from the French Branch of the SCP Foundation are listed in the [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/patapouf Prestigious Almanac of Terms and Academic Parlance Originating from the Universe of Francophonia (PATAPOUF)].\n\n----\n\n+ Acknowledgements\n\nIn addition to the linked pages, this Glossary of Terms made use of the already existing [[[mackenzie-glossary| Dr. Mackenzie's Glossary of Terms]]], as well as similar pages from the [http://scp-pt-br.wikidot.com/glossario-dos-tradutores Portuguese] and [http://fondationscp.wikidot.com/gudule French] SCP wikis. \n\n----\n\n+ Updating the Page\n\nFurther contributions are always welcome!
