Guards armed with light weapons are to patrol the exterior of the site and deter civilian approach. Persons actively attempting to breach the site are to be detained and questioned.\n\nSite-49 is a circular one-story building consisting of a central chamber containing SCP-2157, research laboratories, examination rooms and storerooms in the inner ring, and barracks, offices and interrogation rooms in the outer ring. The central chamber has no floor so that SCP-2157 has access to the natural ground, and it is equipped with a retractable roof to be opened at the discretion of the Site Director or Senior Medical Researcher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-2157 consists of --43 humans (21 males, 22 females)-- 41 humans (20 males, 21 females) of Asian ethnicity but varying heights, weights and builds, located in an approximate 20m^^2^^ area within the ██████████ forest in Japan.\n\nAlthough standing in a seemingly random arrangement, each member of SCP-2157 faces a western direction and, --while they have never displayed any autonomous movement,-- they are capable of involuntary actions, such as blinking and flinching from stimulus. They show no adverse reaction to extreme cold beyond a reduction in metabolic activity, similar to hibernation in some mammals. Sunlight and occasional rainwater seem to be the only sustenance they require.\n\nBiological analysis on SCP-2157 has found that its members are genetically siblings and are approximately thirty years old.\n\nEach member of SCP-2157 has its feet covered in soil, but there is no physical connection to the earth. Despite this, removal from the soil is fatal to SCP-2157 members (see Addenda 1A and 1B). Analysis of the soil has found nothing anomalous.\n\nSCP-2157 was discovered on 04/13/20██ when Foundation agents embedded in local law enforcement were made aware of its existence following an indecent exposure report from two hikers who reported encountering a “group of nudists” in the ██████████ forest. It is unknown how SCP-2157 went undiscovered before this, given its public location. The hikers, and all affected police officers, were administered Class-A amnestics.\n\n**Addendum 1A:** 04/05/20██ — A male member of SCP-2157 (SCP-2157-01) was scheduled to be removed for further testing. Medical Technicians S████ and C████████ lifted SCP-2157-01 onto a gurney for transport, at which point every member of SCP-2157 screamed loudly upon its removal from the soil. SCP-2157-01 immediately expired.\n\nEach member of SCP-2157 then turned their heads to look at Med-Techs S████ and C████████, maintaining eye contact where possible until the technicians left the containment chamber, at which point SCP-2157 resumed facing west.\n\nAutopsy on SCP-2157-01 found cause of death to be heart failure and its stomach to be full of soil similar in composition to that at the base of SCP-2157. The full autopsy results can be found in Medical Report 2157-01.\n\n> //\"We have no idea how that soil gets into their bodies, or, for that matter, how it gets out, if it does at all.\" – Dr. Masuda, Senior Medical Researcher, Site-49//\n\nNote: All subsequent times Med-Techs S████ and C████████ have entered SCP-2157’s containment chamber, its members have turned to face them as much as their necks will allow.\n\n**Addendum 1B:** 05/05/20██ — A female member of SCP-2157 (SCP-2157-02) was removed to compare results with the SCP-2157-01 incident. Medical Technicians K███████ and O█████ were tasked with lifting SCP-2157-02 onto a gurney. Outcome was identical, with exception that observers noted that SCP-2157’s screams were louder. Autopsy results can be found in Medical Report 2157-02.\n\n> //\"Further testing that requires removing SCP-2157 members from the soil has been suspended indefinitely.\" -- F. Ishimoto, Site Director, Site-49//\n\n**Addendum 2A:** 05/20/20██ — Med-Tech O█████ was found deceased in his barracks bunk. Autopsy found that his stomach and esophagus were filled with soil of similar composition to that at the base of SCP-2157, and he had died via asphyxiation. Trace amounts of the soil were also found in O█████'s blood. Other personnel sharing the barracks reported hearing no disturbance through the night. Given the nature of O█████'s death, locating Med-Techs K███████, S████ and C████████ was made a level 3 priority.\n\nMed-Tech K███████ was discovered in Storeroom C shortly after this, deceased via the same means. He was positioned as if sleeping, and there were no indications on his body or surroundings of a fall.\n\nMed-Tech C████████ was off-duty and a team of agents was sent to her residence. After forcing entry, the agents found C████████ on her bedroom floor, deceased via the same means, in a similar position to Med-Tech K███████.\n\nMed-Tech S████ was also off-duty, but has yet to be located.\n\nThroughout these events, SCP-2157 showed no change in activity.\n\nUPDATE: As of 11/20/20██ Medical Technician S████'s whereabouts are still unknown. Although he is presumed deceased, investigation is still ongoing but has been downgraded to a level 4 priority.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-2156]]] | SCP-2157 | [[[SCP-2158]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
