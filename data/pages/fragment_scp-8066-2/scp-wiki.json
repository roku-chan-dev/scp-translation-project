Are you really telling me you don't know what SCP-106 is?\n\n**Price:** Don't know what?\n\n**Dr. Owings:** SCP-106. The teleporting matter-corroding mass murderer. We used SCP-2006 to trap it here back in 1961. Not ringing any bells?\n\n//[As Dr. Owings speaks, Price's eyes glaze over. Her hands tighten on the clipboard, knuckling white, then relax.]//\n\n**Price:** ...I'm sorry, I spaced out for a moment there. You were saying something about Halloween preparations?\n\n[[/div]]\n\nAfter determining that Price was no longer capable of remembering SCP-106, Dr. Owings contacted Agent Benedict Lugosi, Site-118's chief of security, requesting that he check Cell 606's internal camera feed. Upon hearing about SCP-106, Agent Lugosi began displaying confusion and short-term memory loss similar to that experienced by Price.\n\nRealizing that communication regarding SCP-106 was currently untenable, Dr. Owings traveled to his office and used his security clearance to directly access the Cell 606's internal feed from his computer. \n\nAll recorded footage prior to September 1st, 2024 appears to have been deleted prematurely due to a system error. All footage after this point is uniform:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic curved\"]]\n\nSCP-106's container is nowhere in sight. The room is clean and white, devoid of corrosion or the black, mucus-like substance that typically forms in the anomaly's immediate presence. The door is missing.\n\nSCP-106 is lying in the center of the room, curled into the fetal position. It is whimpering quietly and its eyes are tightly squeezed shut.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n**Notes:** I currently believe that SCP-8066 is some kind of roaming antimeme that came into contact with SCP-106. Even the new site AIC we recently installed appears to be affected by it, so I've had to do the video log transcripts by hand. My immunity to SCP-8066, conversely, is possibly born of my unusually high CRV (robust mental defenses are a requirement for leading the Phobology Department) and the mnestic supplements they give all high-clearance personnel.\n\nI'll be sending this document to ##transparent|the Antimemetics Division## to see if a cure for SCP-8066's effects can be synthesized quickly -- if SCP-106's emotional state returns to baseline while its still antimemetic, we'll have no defense against it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"report-box\"]]\n\n++* INCIDENT 8066.2\n\n----\n\nOn September 3rd, 2024 at 2:01 AM, several discrete instances of anomalous phenomena simultaneously took place across Site-118:\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic curved\"]]\n\n++++* INCIDENT 8066.2-1\n\n----\n\nSite-118's Delta Wing experiences minor tremors and a distant rumbling sound for 14 seconds.

Upon reaching his house, Dr. Owings discovered that the front door had been forced open and left ajar.\n\nAs several similar break-ins had recently occurred in the area, Dr. Owings initially believed that the incident was nonanomalous in nature and called local authorities to report the crime.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote classic curved\"]]\n\n= **[CALL BEGINS]**\n\n**Dr. Owings:** I'd like to report a break-in.\n\n**Dispatcher:** Is the crime currently in progress?\n\n**Dr. Owings:** No, they were long gone when I got here.\n\n**Dispatcher:** Can you give me the location of the break-in?\n\n**Dr. Owings:** 55 Englewood Drive.

Subsequently, an attempted report to the Foundation revealed that this anomalous event was a manifestation of SCP-8066.\n\n----\n\n**Notes:** I've been making too many assumptions. Here I thought the common thread with SCP-8066 was Site-118 -- that it was lurking in its halls or attempting to hold sway over them, and I happened to be psychologically resistant enough to notice. But it's not that at all. It didn't just follow me home, it was waiting for me.\n\nSCP-8066's might only be affecting the site because I'm there. The common thread is myself.

The extent of these blackouts is unclear, as Site-118's structure is vast and only Dr. Owings is currently capable of reporting them.\n\nIn the event that a blackout prevents exit from the complex, a portable generator and a large supply of food and water have been stored in Dr. Owings' office.\n\n----\n\n**Notes:** When I was a child, I was afraid of the dark. This was somewhat problematic, as my parents worked long nights, often leaving me to shut the lights off when it was time for bed.\n\nI was convinced, then, that if I lingered in the dark for even a moment, some terrible creature skulking within it would be upon me. It became a ritual, of a kind -- each night, I would turn off the lights, then rush up the stairs as quickly as I could to hurl myself into bed, certain that the monsters' grasping claws were only inches away.\n\nEach blackout feels like that, to me.

I had no intention of driving anywhere -- it's a good hour and a half trip to reach anything from Site-118, as deep as we are in the Sonoran Desert. More and more of my colleagues were becoming unrecognizable and I needed a few moments alone; I needed to be able to stop pretending for a second.\n\nI didn't intend to stay there for longer than the duration of a lunch break, but I haven't been sleeping well recently and must've passed out the moment I started relaxing. When I woke, it had become night, and there was a body strapped into the passenger seat beside me. In the gloom I couldn't make out much of its features -- all that stood out was the cloudy whites of its eyes in its lolling head, staring.\n\nThere were other things outside of the car, too. Shadowy, vaguely humanoid shapes were passing between the cars in the parking lot, softly hissing like gas leaks. When one passed right by me, I could feel a chill emanating off of it like a walking freezer. \n\nI fled, of course, the moment I found an unbroken path from the car to the site's entrance. I may have been chased or I may not -- I was too preoccupied with running and scared out of my mind to get a proper sense of my surrounds. I raced to the elevator, only slowing down to flash my identification to the guard at the front door. When the doors shut and it started to descend, I nearly collapsed. I was so overwrought at the time that I only noticed as I was nearing my stop: the button for the ground floor, on the surface, was missing. It had disappeared from all of the elevators and the stairwells were gone entirely.\n\nNow there really is nowhere to run.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=spectre.png\n| caption=Incident 8066.6\n| width=100%\n| align=center]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n----\n\n**Notes:** Personnel seem particularly uneasy since Incident 8066.6. Nobody has talked about it or done anything to try to fix the situation, but I'm pretty sure that there's been a psychological impact.\n\nCould it be possible that SCP-8066 was never antimemetic at all? It might be something memetic instead, an effect tied to the anomaly on a conceptual level.
