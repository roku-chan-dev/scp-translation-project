Testing is to be approved by SCP-3346's primary researcher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3346 is a plastic child-size hard hat. The hat is a toy manufactured by the █████ Company in 1986 and is not suitable to be used as protective equipment. SCP-3346 shows signs of wear consistent with gentle use. There is a piece of yellow construction paper taped to the inside dome of SCP-3346 (see addendum 1).\n\nWhen an individual puts SCP-3346 on their head, they experience a non-sight-based sensation. These sensations are related to significant anxieties the subject wearing SCP-3346 experienced as a child between the ages of 4-6. Frequently these are audio or physical sensations; however, no one in the experimentation chamber but the subject is able to experience the sensation. After removal of SCP-3346, most subjects report feeling much better about the incident and able to handle further exposure to the anxiety-inducing event.\n\n**Experimentation Log:** Approval for testing using individuals under the age of 18 is pending. All testing until such a measure is approved is to be done by adults. Testing is to be conducted by instructing the subject to wear SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then remove and offer commentary on their experience.\n\n> **Test Subject:** D-84269\n> **Testing:** D-84269 puts on SCP-3346. Subject looks confused, then at 34 seconds begins laughing. Subject removes SCP-3346 at 60 seconds.\n> **Commentary:** \"Macaroni salad! I tasted macaroni salad! God, I hated macaroni salad when I was a kid, it scared me to death! I thought it was little worms!\"\n> **Long-term Results:** D-84269 was provided with a bowl of macaroni salad and immediately began to eat it. Following consumption, D-84269 commented, \"I haven't thought about the worms thing in years. Isn't that funny? It was so serious back then.\"\n\n> **Test Subject:** Dr. Theodora Wu\n> **Testing:** Dr. Wu wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, then removes.\n> **Commentary:** \"I could smell flowers. My sister died when I was four, she was eight.\" (Pause) \"They covered her coffin in flowers. I had a panic attack at the funeral. I still can't stand dahlias, they were her favorite.\"\n> **Long-term Results:** Dr. Wu self-reported increased visits to R████████ Cemetary where her sister is buried. Most recent report indicated Dr. Wu brought dahlias with her, as \"They //were// her favorite.\"\n\n> **Test Subject:** Dr. Charles L. (request to remain anonymous)\n> **Testing:** Dr. L. was chosen as his psychological profile indicated being raised in an abusive household. He is instructed to wear SCP-3346 for the full 60 seconds. Dr. L. wears SCP-3346 for 60 seconds, displaying extreme discomfort throughout, then removes and throws across the room.\n> **Commentary:** Dr. L. was initially unable to respond to researcher queries, but after calming down claimed he \"felt him hit me again.\" Dr. L. was overcome again and unable to elaborate.\n> **Long-term Results:** Dr. L. was issued weekly Foundation-sponsored therapy and has been able to face some of the difficulties he endured as a child. When asked, Dr. L. commented, \"It's hard. It's going to take time. But I'm glad I'm facing it.\"\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Addendum 3346-1\" hide=\"Access Granted\"]]\n**Addendum 3346-1:** SCP-3346 was discovered with the following note taped inside. It is written on yellow construction paper using a blue crayon.\n\n> Worry Hat, Worry Hat\n> \n> Worry Hat, Worry Hat\n> When it's hard to play\n> We can tell the Worry Hat\n> \"I feel sad today.\"\n> \n> Anyone can take their sad\n> And put it in the hat\n> Then when we are feeling good\n> We can come right back!\n> \n> Mrs. Raymond's Kindergarten\n> If found please return!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3345]]] |  SCP-3346 | [[[SCP-3347]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** A Hard Hat.JPG\n> **Author:** Dwight Burdette\n> **License:** CC BY 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:A_Hard_Hat.JPG\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
