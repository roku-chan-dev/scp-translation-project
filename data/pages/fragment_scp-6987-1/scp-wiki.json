You may be responsible for humanoid SCP objects. You may have your own lab. Whatever the reason, you now must understand the nature of the Foundation's relationship with Goldbaker-Reinz in greater detail.\n\nGoldbaker-Reinz is the best insurer with an unreasonably accurate forecasting model for natural disasters, terrorist attacks, and other traditionally unpredictable events. It is the only insurer that charges fair rates for these events with the liquidity to pay out. Marshall, Carter, & Dark have proven in the past that they prefer to line their own pockets, and our [[[SCP-4951|in-house solutions]]] are significantly limited in scope.\n\nOur audits of their operations only cover matters pertaining to our policies, and even then we don't get to look at the guts of their mathematical models. So:\n* We don't know how their models work so well -- how they predict calamities.\n* We don't know where their money is coming from -- how they always charge fair prices for disasters, though always just slightly in their favor. \n* We don't know how they provide their more... //esoteric// services.\n* We only have their past performance as proof of their benevolence -- though they have //always// honored their contracts. \n\nYou see the problem.\n\nYou may think you can make a name for yourself by getting Goldbaker-Reinz formally classified with an SCP designation of its own, instead of merely classifying our contracts with them as SCP-6987. \n\nDon't. People have tried. They no longer work here.\n\nOur relationship with Goldbaker-Reinz is more valuable than your continued employment. Keeping track of every contract we have with them is a full-time job for thousands of people, but they have //always// paid.\n\n//Ezekiel Yang, PhD.//\n//Department of Financial Esoterica//\n\n//Sheldon Katz, Esq.//\n//Legal Department.//\n\n//Secure.

These penalties increase in severity with the magnitude of the breach.\n\nPenalties for contractual violation by Goldbaker-Reinz:\n*  Increased compensation beyond typical insurance payouts;\n* Multiple years' worth of discounted policy coverage;\n* Voluntary resignation from the Council of 108;\n* Formal containment.\n\nPenalties for contractual violation by the Foundation:\n* Increased insurance premiums (this will affect Foundation-wide compensation);\n* Surrender of SCP items as collateral;\n* Forcible recruitment of senior leadership;\n* Formal designation as a Threat Entity by the GOC.\n\nIt is currently not diplomatically viable to classify any members of the Council of 108 as SCPs.\n[[/div]]\n------\n[[=]]\n+++ Additional Policies Available At Your Clearance Level\n[[/=]]\n------\n\nAll payments are made monetarily and charged monthly, unless otherwise stated.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ SCP-6987-E1-E3: Anomalous Humanoid Medical Insurance\n\nSCP-6987-E1-E3 cover routine medical procedures for humanoid anomalies. \n\nAll medical procedures upon humanoid SCP objects, including for health, experimentation, or containment, will be covered.\n\nGoldbaker-Reinz does not cover life insurance  for contained humanoid SCP objects unless said objects are classified as full employees of the Foundation.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ SCP-6987-E16: Essential Personnel\n\nIn the case of loss of specialized or otherwise valuable personnel, the Foundation will be compensated for the loss of expertise.\n\nThe Foundation has received payouts under this policy associated with persons believed to have never existed.

A multidisciplinary team of Foundation negotiators will attempt to buy the most coverage for the lowest price.\n\nIf Goldbaker-Reinz quotes a figure that is greater than the Foundation's estimated final price by over 100% or less than the Foundation's estimates by over 50%, their figure is to be accepted without negotiation.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ SCP-6987-E18-E30: Natural Disaster\n\nThese policies cover damages from natural disasters,  both anomalous or non-anomalous. \n\nFoundation sites are covered by relevant policies for their geographical location. \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n++++ SCP-6987-E31-E50: Anomalous Terrorist Organization Activity\n\nThe Foundation is covered by specific policies for antagonistic actions by specific GoIs.

Typical insurers have cash inflows of  consistent low-value payments and cash outflows of unpredictable infrequent high-value payments. However, payments exchanged between the Foundation and Goldbaker-Reinz under SCP-6987 suggest that Goldbaker-Reinz must have net negative cashflows, suggesting that Goldbaker-Reinz should have gone bankrupt in the 1900s given historical payouts to the Foundation. \n\nIn this paper, we provide our best estimates for Goldbaker-Reinz's cashflows given historical premium payments and policy payouts, extrapolated across all clients. We find that Goldbaker-Reinz's net worth is unlikely to be explained by fraud but can be explained by the non-monetary value of exotic premium payments such as holy relics or rare biomass. We posit both a mechanism by which Goldbaker-Reinz converts esoteric value into monetary value and the necessary specifications of any predictive model employed by Goldbaker-Reinz to schedule stochastic future cash inflows to avoid financial default.\n[[/div]]\n> You are viewing Level 3 documentation (2 of 4 required approvals).
