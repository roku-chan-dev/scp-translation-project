Interaction with SCP-5293 is prohibited.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ VIEW OUTDATED CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nSCP-5293 is held in standard anomalous item locker 06B at Area-179. All interactions with SCP-5293, once permitted by the Research Head, must take place in an environment with a degree of separation between the researcher and the object. An intercom system, two-way glass, or a barricade that otherwise prevents SCP-5293 from directly viewing personnel are approved environments.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Descripton:** SCP-5293 is a red, rubber ball, measuring 0.5 meters in diameter. SCP-5293 is capable of circumrotary movement, and can accelerate its gyrations to speeds of up to 643 kilometers per hour, if left uninterrupted. (See Addenda)\n\nSCP-5293 is sapient, and has demonstrated an understanding of English. SCP-5293 vocalizes using an interstice that runs along the center of one half of the object, which moves similar to a mouth and jaw. The object's vocabulary is limited, taking pauses for a number of seconds in between words. When SCP-5293 is distressed, its coloration will change to a shade of green.\n\nSCP-5293 has expressed a fixation on Foundation Researcher Eric Sauls, who recovered the object from Lake Erie, Pennyslvania, after reports of its discovery by a group of local fishermen. SCP-5293 continuously expresses the desire to kill Researcher Sauls, and has little interest in communicating about other topics.\n\n**Addendum.5293.01:** Interview Log\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Foreword:** Second interview with SCP-5293, conducted by Researcher Sauls two days after discovery and containment of the object.\n= **BEGIN LOG**\n----\n\n//Sauls removes SCP-5293 from locker. A two-way glass separates SCP-5293 and Researcher Sauls. An intercom system is used for communication.//\n\n**Researcher Sauls:** Good morning, SCP-5293. Can you hear me?\n\n**SCP-5293:** Yes.\n\n**Researcher Sauls:** Excellent, and how are you today?\n\n**SCP-5293:** I. Am. Fine.\n\n**Researcher Sauls:** We talked yesterday. Do you still feel the desire to kill me, SCP-5293?\n\n**SCP-5293:**  I. Want. To. Kill. You.\n\n**Researcher Sauls:** Ah, gotcha. That's okay, SCP-5293. Why do you want to kill me?\n\n**SCP-5293:** I. Want. To. Kill. You.\n\n**Researcher Sauls:** Alright, that's fiâ€”\n\n**SCP-5293:** (//Object becomes green//) Sorry.\n\n= **END LOG**\n----\n\n**Closing Statement:** //Interview continued for another half hour. SCP-5293 refused to discuss topics other than killing me, even when enticed with the prospects of being able to do so upon compliance. Upon being asked to elaborate on how it would do this, SCP-5293 responded that it would \"have to think about that\", but \"[was] going to kill Researcher Sauls\" regardless.  Object was returned to containment upon conclusion of the interview. - Researcher Sauls//\n[[/div]]\n\n**Addendum.5293.02:** Incident-5293-01\n\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n[[size 140%]]INCIDENT REPORT[[/size]]\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=https://live.staticflickr.com/5188/5787021923_6a0e71ed12_b.jpg|align=right|width=40%|caption=Destruction caused to  Area-179 by SCP-5293's acceleration]]\n\n//The following recollection of events has been compiled from a source of surveilance footage and summarized below.//\n\nOn 2021/4/03, SCP-5293 breached containment by rotating itself within its containment locker to achieve a speed of 643 kph. The object then accelerated with enough force to break through the walls of its locker, and continued on a trajectory that broke through the northeast wall of Area-179's anomalous items wing, four hallways, a research lab, a fueling silo, 12 containment chambers (resulting in three containment breaches) and a garage before ricocheting off a stop sign outside Area-179 in a southwest direction. SCP-5293 broke through the windshields of 5 cars, 7 trees, a restaurant, and continued in this direction before reaching the upper-left second story window of the residence of Researcher Sauls. SCP-5293 shattered the window and accelerated through a wall before reaching the residence's bathroom and making contact with the back of Researcher Saul's head, who then died upon impact.\n\nUpon recovery, SCP-5293 stated the following:\n\n> **SCP-5293:** Told. You.\n\nSCP-5293 was compliant upon being returned to containment. Containment procedures have been updated accordingly. Further interviews with SCP-5293 have resulted in the object displaying difficulty communicating about topics other than killing Researcher Sauls, despite having done so. A transcription of an interview four hours from Incident-5293-01 has been provided below.\n\n> = **BEGIN LOG**\n> \n> **SCP-5293:** Where. Is. Researcher. Sauls.\n> \n> **Dr. Dune:** You- You killed him earlier today. You've been wanting to do that since you were contained.\n> \n> **SCP-5293:** (//Object turns green//) Oh.\n> \n> **Dr. Dune:** How does that make you feel?\n> \n> **SCP-5293:** Upset.\n> \n> **Dr. Dune:** You wanted to kill him though. You remember that, right?\n> \n> **SCP-5293:** (//Coloration returns to red.//) I. Want. To. Kill. Him. Again.\n> \n> = **END LOG**\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n------\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-5292]]] | SCP-5293 | [[[SCP-5294]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Aron Christow and Anonymous]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Ball.jpg\n> **Name:** Red Rubber Ball\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/11375837@N05 whoohoo120]\n> **License:** CC-BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/11375837@N05/2207740504 flickr]\n\n=====\n> **Filename:** exp.jpg\n> **Name:** Gibraltar Explosion\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/45967589@N03 josh13770]\n> **License:** CC-BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/45967589@N03/5787021923 flickr]\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
