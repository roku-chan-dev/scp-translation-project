SCP-5269 remains in an immobile position with its arms outstretched. Rock and lunar soil have completely covered SCP-5269's lower limbs, securing SCP-5269's position in the Moon's regolith. The object has not been observed to decompose, age, or exhibit any other phenomena associated with life or death. Thus, the biological state of SCP-5269 is unknown.\n \nSCP-5269 is capable of transmitting radio signals. The origin, purpose, and intended receiver of these signals is unknown. The contents of an SCP-5269 communication are presented in an anomalous, universally digestible system, capable of being comprehended and understood regardless of the listener's known language. SCP-5269 has been observed to transmit messages once every two years since the object's discovery in 2016.\n \nAll attempts to communicate with SCP-5269 have failed.\n\n**Addendum 5269.1:** SCP-5269 Signal Transcripts\n\n> **Date:** 6/19/2018, 20:36:02\n> ----\n> \n> I don't miss it.\n> \n> There are no crowds, no mirrors, no pressures or expectations.\n> \n> Final escape.
