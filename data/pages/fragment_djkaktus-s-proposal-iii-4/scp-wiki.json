There was a time when the darkness would have impeded him -- but that time had passed. Now, he found it comforting. Colors distracted him from his work.\n\nHe turned to the next page of the report -- despite not needing to ‘see’ the words to read them. Old habits, he supposed. With each successive sentence, his calm gave way to cold, calculated purpose.\n\nThe door opened. A blade of light pierced the room, illuminating the man and his desk. It cut across his forearm and highlighted an old burn scar. He instinctively moved his hand out to cover it.\n\nHe looked up. A woman stood at the doorway, hesitating. It was only then that he realized his face was twisted with rage. \n\nHe forced himself to relax, acknowledged her with a nod, and motioned her in.\n\nShe took two steps forward and spoke: “You’ve heard?”\n\n“Yes.” He closed the report. “Do we know who yet?”\n\n“Not yet.” She moved to approach, but stopped -- as if a wind forced her back. “Whoever found the Pinnacle did so with the use of mnestics, and there’s a limited supply. We’re looking.”\n\n“And the Contract?”\n\nThe woman didn’t respond.\n\nHe sighed. “Felix?”\n\n“We didn’t find him. If he fell, or was pushed, he might still be falling. We have to assume the worst.”\n\nThe man stood, his eyes fixed on the backs of his own knuckles. “I don’t understand how this could happen. I don’t understand who would do this. Who //could// do this. Do they even know what they did?” He looked up at her. “This is bad.”\n\nHer expression did not change. “The rest of the council has been alerted. I just came here to make sure you knew.” She took another step forward; her hand fell to his desk. “Maybe… maybe if we just-”\n\n“Whatever you were about to say, don’t.” His voice was flat; something trembled just under the surface. “Whoever they are, they got lucky.”\n\nShe frowned. He could see the weariness in her face. There was something she wanted to tell him; there was something she wanted to say. Instead, she just closed her eyes and nodded. \n\nHe reached for her hand upon the desk, taking it into his own. His palm was like worn, scraped leather. Hers was ice. “I know you’re tired. I know. God, I know. I’m…” \n\nHe forced himself to stop. He took a breath, turned her hand over, and traced the scars along her wrist and forearm. She looked so frail, now. “We can’t stop now. We can’t give up now.”\n\nHer eyes were still closed. “I know.”\n\n“Go, now. Go back to the Garden. You know the way in. You’ll be safe there. I'm going to call up the task forces and we’ll figure out what this is. I’ll call you when it’s clear.”\n\nShe squeezed his hand back. At last, her eyes opened. “What about you?”\n\nHe smiled. “I just need to figure some things out, and then I’ll come for you.”\n\nHe came around the desk and held her; she held him back. After a few moments of silence, she turned her head up to his. “I--”\n\nThe phone rang. \n\nHe grimaced. His grip on her loosened. “I’m sorry. I…”\n\nHer expression hardened. She released him, nodding. “I know.” Without another word, she turned and left him alone. \n\nHe reached for the phone.\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]]**NOW**[[/size]]\n\n-- - --\n\n[[image tokyo.png style=\"border: solid 2px #141414;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n“//The// Accountant.” Anthony found the title amusing. “Do they only have one?”\n\nOlivia laughed. “That’s a lot of math. He must be some sort of uber-nerd.”\n\n“A dire nerd,” Adam offered, his eyes never leaving the screen of his laptop.\n\nThis comment drew blank stares from Olivia, Anthony, and Calvin. \n\n“You know, like a dire wolf? From D&D? Or //Game of Thrones//? Or…” Adam looked up. He immediately scowled, then went right back to typing. “//Fuck//, you people are old.”\n\nAnthony took a drag of his cigarette and eyed Calvin from across the room. “Alright. So, how are you planning on finding all these fucks? I doubt they’re just hanging out at the local pub. They’re probably holed up somewhere with enough anomalous ordinance to make Mordor look like the Shire.” He gave Adam a look, who -- without raising his head -- lifted two fingers in appreciation.\n\nCalvin nodded. “Yeah. This is where it gets tricky. Our mystery agent wrote a lot about the Overseers, and a little bit about where they live, or where they’d be hiding, but a lot of it is situational and might not be helpful. That’s why we’re going after the Accountant first. He’s the one who pays the rent. Take him out, and the list of possible safe-houses gets that much smaller. ”\n\nOlivia leaned back in her chair. “Perfect. We just need to find this first one, then. The first one of these gods-on-Earth that know we’re coming for them. Do you even have a plan?”\n\nCalvin gestured to his right. “I’ve got Adam.”\n\nAdam leaned away from his computer. “Oh, yeah. Right. Yeah, I can find him.”\n\nAnthony snorted. “This’ll be good.”\n\nAdam ignored him: “The Accountant is, as far as we can tell, a mathematical prodigy who specializes in statistical analysis. He’s a data-sponge -- he soaks up information, analyzes it, and finds hidden correlations no one else can see. Everything he does, he does based on these invisible relationships. His entire route -- what he wears, what he drinks, his day-to-day activities -- they’re all based on predictions derived from these correlations.”\n\nHe turned his screen around to show the others. Several tabs were open in his browser; the current one was a graph of current stock prices. “Now, I probably don’t need to tell you what a person like this could do in stock markets. He analyzes data faster than computers; he can predict the boom and bust of a Fortune 500 based on a goddamn train schedule. And although his ability to //see// these correlations is anomalous, the correlations themselves aren’t -- they’re just impossible for anyone else to understand or decode.”\n\n“Alright,” Anthony said. “But that doesn’t tell us how to--”\n\n“Train schedules,” Olivia cut him off. She was focused on one of the unopened tabs on the screen. “In Tokyo?”\n\nAdam grinned and nodded. He opened the tab, revealing a translated train schedule. “The journal mentioned it. I’ve been having Alexander crunching numbers for a few weeks--”\n\n“Alexander?” Anthony narrowed his eyes.\n\n“It’s the name he gave his laptop,” Calvin replied. “What did you find?”\n\n“Basically, there’s some sort of weird correlation between international housing markets and train schedules printed in Tokyo on the fifth day of every third month,” Adam said. “And based on how deliberate this guy is, I’d be willing to bet money he goes to Tokyo himself to examine those schedules the day they’re printed.”\n\n“Hang on.” Olivia leaned in to examine the screen closer. “You said this guy is able to make predictions based on correlations no one else can see, right? Wouldn’t that lead him to realize he shouldn’t be where we expect him to be?” \n\nAdam cocked his head. “Are you asking me if he can see into the future?”\n\n“Well, yeah. Isn’t that basically what this is?” Olivia turned from the screen and focused her attention on Adam. “If he’s able to magically see connections no one else can, isn’t it possible some piece of information he’s encountered will tell him that we’re coming? Or even who we are?”\n\n“I don’t think so,” Calvin said. “I mean, the numbers can be wrong.”\n\nAdam shook his head. “No, she’s -- well, //mostly// right. The numbers can’t be wrong. They’re just data. He can’t know anything for sure, though. He just makes predictions, and those predictions have varying degrees of certainty. That’s the hiccup, here: He can know there’s a 75% chance that today, someone will attack him. He can know there’s a 30% chance it’ll be five people, a 25% chance it’ll be four people, a 20% chance it’ll be three people… so on.”\n\nAnthony massaged his brows. “Look, do we really need to take a probabilities course to kill this guy? I get that he’s smart, but last time I checked, train schedules don’t stop bullets.”\n\n“But bullets won’t stop someone who isn’t even there,” Olivia replied. She turned back to Adam. “So, basically, he can predict extremely complex systems based on seemingly random bits of data. Right?”\n\nAdam nodded. “Right.” \n\nOlivia gave them all a very crooked grin. “In that case, I think I know //exactly// how to beat him.” \n\n[[=]]\n-- - --\n[[/=]]\n\nThe black car pulled to the side of a street in the Tokyo financial district. The man who stepped out was so extraordinarily unremarkable that, under normal circumstances, even his lack of remarkability failed to generate a remark. \n\nHis high end tailored suit and dark glasses blended with the well-to-dos of the region; his skin was a shade of amber-gold. Despite being aware of the time, he checked his wristwatch, closed the car door, then took three steps down the sidewalk. The vehicle drove away. \n\nThe Accountant was a man of precision. He slept for exactly seven hours; when he woke, it was on the hour. Each footfall was calculated -- each step predetermined. He made no mistakes, took no chances, and accounted for //every// significant possibility.\n\nThat’s why, when he first noticed the young man approaching him from across the street, he took immediate action. The man was in his 20s; short hair, open coat -- Slavic, if he had to wager a guess. Based on the color of the man’s shoes, the Accountant determined he was here to kill him. Based on the current market price of peaches, the Accountant determined he was not alone.\n\nHe took a step to the left. A crowd of businessmen had just emerged from a nearby diner; this put at least fifteen people between him and the would-be assassin. One of the fifteen was Japanese -- in his mid-50s. He walked with a slight limp and was going bald. This meant the second assassin was in the third story window of the small wine-shop across the street. \n\nThe Accountant adjusted his watch, reflecting sunlight off its surface and into the window. The sniper was briefly blinded. Now that neither assassin could see him, he moved to enter a nearby office building. \n\n“Fuck. Glare,” Anthony growled into his mic. “You see him?”\n\nAdam fought his way through the crowd, shaking his head. “No. Lost him. He’s anticipating everything we’re doing. I think -- he’s gotta be in that building with the blue glass. Heading for it.”\n\nOlivia peeked out from around the corner and touched her ear-piece. “Calvin, should I go in with him?”\n\nThere was a brief pause before Calvin replied: “Yes.”\n\nOlivia jogged toward the financial office. Adam pushed his way through several more people to follow her. \n\nThe interior was a sprawling three-story lobby framed with marble. A grand staircase extended up to each level, with glass elevators providing an alternate route. Adam’s eyes darted between the various levels. \n\n“Which level?” Adam asked. \n\nShe yanked Adam by the arm and pulled. “Neither. This way.” \n\nThe two of them took off toward the far-end of the building. An emergency exit led to an alleyway out back. Olivia shoved the door open and stepped through; Adam followed. As soon as they stepped outside, they were greeted with the sound of muffled gunfire. \n\n“Shit!” Olivia shoved Adam between two dumpsters; she soon followed him, dropping to a crouch. She flipped out her compact mirror and held it out, using the reflection to search the alley ahead.\n\nTwo men in suits stood where the alley emptied out into the street. Between them, the Accountant checked his watch. \n\n“Hm. This will work,” he announced. “We’ve got about a minute before I leave to catch my train. So, what can I do for you?”\n\nOlivia examined the reflection in her mirror. Adam squinted at the image, frowning. “He’s just standing out in the open,” he whispered. “We could just--”\n\nShe reached to touch her ear-piece again. “Calvin. Do we go for it?”\n\nCalvin’s reply came almost immediately: “No.”\n\nOlivia looked to Adam. “Keep him talking.”\n\nAdam nodded. He turned to the side of the dumpster and hollered: “You’re the Accountant, right?”\n\n“You know, I //do// have a professional title. And a name, if you’d rather--”\n\n“We know who you are,” Adam yelled back. “We’re here to kill you.”\n\n“Yes, I’m aware. Well, here I am. Go ahead. Take a shot.”\n\nOlivia gestured for Adam to keep going. \n\n“Uh-huh. But do you know //why// we’re here to kill you?”\n\n“Twenty nine seconds. You’re very likely the ones I received word about, just this morning. You’re responsible for terminating our contract with Death. I presume you want to murder me over some sort of ideological quibble.”\n\n“An ideological //quibble//?” Adam’s voice nearly hitched up an octave. Olivia reached to touch his shoulder. “You know how many corpses your organization is built on top of? How many people die every day just so you fucks get to run the show?”\n\n“I’ve never killed anyone. Of course, I’m certain you’ve killed a few. How many? A dozen? A hundred? Did you bother to learn any of their names?” the Accountant asked. He checked his watch again. “Were any of them children? Just curious.”\n\nAdam jerked against Olivia’s grip. She squeezed him, hard. “Don’t,” she whispered. “He’s trying to get a rise out of you.”\n\n“Fuck him,” Adam growled. His grip on his pistol was tight enough to force the blood out of his knuckles. “Like he hasn’t killed--”\n\n“Well, if you’re not going to try and murder me, I suppose I’ll just have to leave early,” the Accountant said. Again, he looked at his watch.  “Seven seconds.”\n\n“We’re going to miss our chance,” Adam hissed. “I’m going to--”\n\n“No, Calvin said--”\n\nAdam was already lunging to his feet -- and Olivia was lunging to tackle him. Her arms slammed into his legs, forcing him to buckle. In the next instant, a deafening //pop// rushed out to fill the alleyway. A fist-sized crater appeared in the dumpster behind them -- right where Adam’s head had been. \n\nWisps of smoke swirled up from the hole. Adam and Olivia both stared at it, their backs pressed against the other dumpster.\n\n“Shit,” Adam whispered.\n\n“Sniper,” Olivia replied.\n\n“One,” the Accountant announced. “Everyone down.”\n\nSeveral more //pops// echoed out through the street -- accompanied by distant screams. Olivia and Adam caught the sound of glass shattering; the popping sounds were followed by additional gunfire.\n\nAnthony’s voice boomed over the earpiece: “I’m covering you. Go.”\n\nOlivia and Adam ran for the door. In the distance, they could hear the sirens -- along with the squealing rubber of the Accountant’s car as it drove away.\n\n[[=]]\n-- - --\n[[/=]]\n\nSometimes, the Accountant wondered what it was like to live in uncertainty; to exist in a world where you could not predict the most likely outcome based on the data in front of you. He imagined it was a dreadful, unbearable state -- like being trapped in a nightmare where nothing made any sense. The thought often prompted a feeling of tremendous pity. \n\nHe felt no pity at this moment. \n\nAs he approached the boarding station, he checked his watch and revisited the alleyway in his mind. He had replayed the events that unfolded there twenty three times; each time, none of it made sense. None of it fit the //model//.\n\nHe correctly predicted the arrival of the two assassins; he also correctly predicted the arrival of their comrade. But his models had shown that, by standing out in the open and addressing them, there was an overwhelming likelihood that at least one would emerge and be immediately struck down by his stationed sniper.\n\nNothing was truly certain, he knew. Every rule had its exception; every absolute hid a sliver of doubt. Everything he understood was merely an approximation of something he did not.\n\nBut the chance of both assassins emerging from this conflict unscathed were, by his calculations, comparable in magnitude to a tornado arranging a deck into a house of cards -- then back into the same ordered deck. It was beyond ‘unlikely’; it was nothing short of //miraculous//.\n\nWas that what he had witnessed? A miracle of probability? An event as rare and near-impossible as the emergence of life itself? \n\nHe stepped on-board the train, providing his ticket. He moved to one of the private rooms, sliding the door aside and taking his seat. As the city began to slip past, he ran through the model for the twenty fourth time, then decided that he would simply need to let it go. \n\nThe sliding door rattled open. A not-quite middle-aged man with dark, faintly greying hair stepped in, taking the opposite seat. He casually reached into his coat pocket and pulled out a revolver, aiming it squarely at the Accountant’s heart.\n\nThe Accountant stared, uncomprehending. This wasn’t possible. This couldn’t be possible.\n\nTwo miracles? In one day?\n\n“How?” he croaked.\n\nCalvin reached into his pocket with his other hand, withdrawing a small, unremarkable coin. He perched it on top of his thumb and proceeded to flip it, before snatching it out of the air. He then showed it to the Accountant.\n\nTails.\n\nThe gears in his head started to turn. “You…”\n\n“You’re good at predicting complicated systems,\" Calvin said, \"but only when they behave the way they’re supposed to. You can’t predict them if all their decisions are inherently unpredictable.”\n\n“But how did you know I would be--”\n\n“We overheard you say you had a train to catch. There were two train stations nearby. So I flipped a coin.”\n\nThe Accountant closed his eyes and smiled. “How utterly boorish. You got //lucky//.”\n\n“Yeah. But it worked, didn’t it?”\n\n“So it did.” His eyes opened; he focused his gaze on Calvin. \"Well. Now you've got me here. What do you want?\"\n\nCalvin laid a piece of paper in front of him and pulled out a pen. He slid them across the table between them towards The Accountant.\n\n\"Names,\" he said. \"Locations. All of the rest of them.\"\n\nThe Accountant sighed. \"You want me to give up the names and locations of the other Overseers? What -- do you want their PIN numbers, too?\"\n\nCalvin tapped the revolver on the table. \"This probably isn't the time to get smart.\"\n\nThe Accountant sat back in his chair and loosened his tie. \"I'm not going to do that. You used a funny trick to put me in a compromising position, and that's clever. But now that we're here, I know //exactly// how this plays out. Why would I compromise my associates when you're just going to kill me either way?\"\n\nCalvin shrugged. \"There's a difference between being shot and being dragged behind this train.\"\n\nThe other man swallowed. \"That's barbaric -- and either way, it's not particularly likely. We're not too far from our destination, and there will be too many people around. The way I die is at the end of that gun.\"\n\n\"That doesn't bother you?\"\n\nThe Accountant rolled his tongue across his teeth. \"Of course it does. I haven't thought about the idea of dying in such a long time, and to now be sitting here looking at it, it's nothing short of horrifying. But I'm not going to beg for mercy from a terrorist.\" He leaned forward. \"Do you truly understand what it is you're doing?”\n\nCalvin didn't answer. The Overseer sighed.\n\n\"Go ahead. We both know what you're going to do next.\"\n\nCalvin squeezed the trigger.\n\n-----\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n**- [/djkaktus-s-proposal-iii/offset/1 BACK] -**\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[image 12.png]]\n[[/=]]",
