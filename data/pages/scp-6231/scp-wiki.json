These include filtered freshwater, a diet of crickets, mealworms and Dubia roaches, a 20°-30° Celsius, damp and humid environment and UV lighting[[footnote]]This should be replaced every 5 to 6 months.[[/footnote]]. Consumption of ice cream offered to personnel by SCP-6231 is allowed and encouraged.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6231 is a sentient male //Agalychnis callidryas// (Red-eyed tree frog) that is capable of producing ice cream from its salivary glands. This ice cream has no inherent anomalous effects and is safe for consumption. The ice cream does not harm SCP-6231 like it would for a member of the same species.\n\nSCP-6231 has thus far proven capable of producing twelve different flavours; coconut, chocolate, vanilla, cookies and cream, strawberry, blue raspberry, mango, mint, mint chocolate chip pistachio, maple, and french vanilla. When asked for a flavour, SCP-6231 will produce an amount of ice cream that is capable of filling an entire cone in one to four minutes, depending on the flavour the subject had asked for. SCP-6231 appears capable of utilizing its mouth to prevent the ice cream it produces from melting. SCP-6231 has also been seen to communicate using small notes.\n\n**Addendum.6231.I: Discovery**\nOn 16/10/2021, Agent Ronald Hudson responded to reports of a frog giving ice cream to children in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When Agent Hudson arrived, SCP-6231 had been producing ice cream for children at a playground. Soon after this, SCP-6231 was taken by one of these said children. Upon questioning the other children on SCP-6231's location, they pointed at the child who had taken SCP-6231, who was at that point eating ice cream. Shortly after this, SCP-6231 was confiscated and moved to Site-250. It is unknown how SCP-6231 arrived in said playground, as //Agalychnis callidryas// is native to Central and South America. Witnesses say that SCP-6231 was left at the playground by a child who then ran away. The identity of this child is unknown.\n\n**Addendum.6231.II:** Incident Log\nOn 28/11/2021, a raid on Site-250 was conducted by the Chaos Insurgency for unknown reasons. During this raid, an insurgent entered SCP-6231's containment chamber. The following is a log of the camera footage of the altercation.\n\n> \n> **<BEGIN LOG>** 2:12 AM\n> \n> ------\n> \n> //SCP-6231 is seen sleeping inside its terrarium.//\n> \n> //An Insurgent enters SCP-6231's containment chamber.//\n> \n> **Insurgent:** The fuck is that smell?\n> \n> //SCP-6231 awakens and looks intrigued by the insurgent.//\n> \n>  //The insurgent looks toward the side to see SCP-6231 labelled on the door.//\n> \n> **Insurgent:** 6231 huh? \n> \n> //The insurgent searches the room for any documentation.//\n> \n> //SCP-6231 begins to expand its mouth, to create ice cream.//\n> \n> **Insurgent:** Nothing.

After this various tests were conducted to get a full grasp of SCP-6231's abilities and limitations.\n\n**Addendum.6231.III:** Experiment Log\n> \n> **Personnel Involved:** Dr. Avery Cado\n> \n> **Foreword:** The following is a log of an experiment conducted on SCP-6231.\n> \n> -----\n> \n> **<BEGIN LOG>** 3:44 PM\n> \n> ------\n> \n> //Dr. Cado enters SCP-6231's containment chamber//\n> \n> **Dr. Cado:** Alright.\n> \n> //Dr. Cado places a small pencil and paper inside SCP-6231's terrarium.//\n> \n> //SCP-6231 is not visible and is suspected to be hiding.//\n> \n> **Dr. Cado:** Don't be shy, I won't hurt you!\n> \n> //SCP-6231 slowly approaches the note and picks up the pencil and writes something down.//\n> \n> //Dr. Cado picks the note up.//\n> \n> **Dr. Cado:** \"Hi\".

This morning, it got worse. It's still reacting positively and making ice cream, but it isn't as active as it was before. It's lost a lot of weight too and isn't writing notes to staff. We'll try giving it some remedies for that disease that's been going around in the amphibian anomalies, but I just wanted to inform you what's happening beforehand, just in case things go south.\n\nWith regards, Avery.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum.6231.VIII:** Third Note Found\nOn 25/02/2022 a third note was found.

Dr. Cleo Ares determined that SCP-6231 had bacterial dermatosepticemia (commonly referred to as \"Red Leg Disease\"), a disease common in amphibians, which had been seen in other amphibian-based anomalies before. When given the proper treatment for it, SCP-6231's condition remained the same. This is because of SCP-6231's changed anatomy from that of a regular //Agalychnis callidryas//.\n\nOne day later, SCP-6231 was transferred into the Department of Fauna and Flora Anomaly Care unit of Site-101 and the following events transpired:\n\n> **Foreword:** The following events were recorded via surveillance cameras.\n> \n> **<BEGIN LOG>** 6:09 AM\n> \n> //Six researchers enter SCP-6231's room in the Fauna and Flora Anomaly Care unit and surround SCP-6231.//\n> \n> //SCP-6231 is visually distressed in its terrarium and is watching the researchers.//\n> \n>  //Dr. Avery Cado enters the room and begins examining SCP-6231.//\n> \n> **Dr. Cado:** The \"Red Leg Disease\" has gotten worse.

You may know us through [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6922 Agent Lou], an agent of ours who is unfortunately in your containment. I have contacted you today to inform you of another agent of ours in your containment. Agent Sticks is a loyal member of our organization. Now, following Agent Sticks' death, we would like to thank you for caring for him. He was the one that volunteered, knowing he wouldn't make it back, in one way or another. He had to say goodbye to his family and friends for the last time, and I know that must've been difficult. He just wanted to make people happy with his ice cream. \n\nNow that we have gotten to know how your organization functions internally and your motives, we hope we can get on friendly terms. We will be contacting you again shortly for the conditions of these terms and to tell you a little bit about our past. Again, we and Sticks' family would like to express our complete gratitude to you for caring for him. We hope our organizations can work together sometime in the near future. May Sticks rest in peace knowing that what he did wasn't for nothing.\n\nSincerely, Secretary Nuts\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6230]]] | SCP-6231 | [[[SCP-6232]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** Red-eyed tree frog 1.jpg\n> **Name:** Red-eyed tree frog 1.jpg\n> **Author:** Danel Solabarrieta\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://www.flickr.com/photos/danelu/10422494474/\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
