The voices and words that rang out through the room were reduced to mere murmurs, hushed tones, and chairs creaking. Everyone’s eyes were trained upon the stage in front of them, thick curtains blocked view from what laid behind it.\n\nIris Dark, beloved daughter of Mr. Percival Darke, sat in the front rows of the hall. For Mr. Darke, the sights of the hall with its exquisite delicacies from beyond the third dimension (so kindly sponsored by Ambrose Restaurants); the thick curtains, worth more than entire states; and guests that could only be vaguely described as humanoid, dressed in their world’s most costly attire, was not a new, nor unfamiliar sight for him.\n\nFor Iris, though, none of it was familiar. She stared at those sickly human abominations, wearing dried snakes’ skin, woven into geometrically impossible shapes. The smell alone of these culinaries were enough to drive her into an ecstasy beyond any of her body’s or mind’s senses.\n\nThere was one particular individual -- she couldn’t quite place what felt so off about him. He was tall, but not too tall. Wearing a red-striped suit and a fancy big tophat, so big that she was amazed that he could balance it on his round head. He was definitely obese.\n\nA little earlier during the festivities, every guest had introduced themselves -- as one does. Even Iris did, and she really didn’t need to, considering her father was the head of one of the most powerful anomalous agencies on the entire globe. But she did it anyway, out of formality’s sake. And she practised in front of a mirror for hours without end for the perfect introduction -- she couldn’t show any faulter in her power and image.\n\nBut the man she was staring at hadn’t introduced himself. No name, not even a nickname, no identification, nothing. Just the occasional smile and glance around the room -- awfully quick ones, too -- standing in a corner for most of the time. A strange man, indeed.\n\nThe curtains opened. Iris’ irises were fixated upon the stage.\n\nThere was an odd device standing in the center of the stage. A bright orb, surrounded by magnifying glasses made out of zinc and bronze, entranced the young Iris Dark so much, she almost forgot what it felt to blink. A control panel, equipped with various buttons and levers, was affixed to the side of the machine.\n\n”Ladies and gentlemen,” a resounding voice sounded. Noises of metal clanking and gears spinning became audible. ”I welcome you to the presentation of the greatest device you’ll ever witness--”\n\nFootsteps. A proudly standing man, clad in thick robes, stepped in. Gears, metal spikes and pulleys extruded out of the man’s every patch of skin. Each step was heavy, with a scent of rust in the air. The noises of ticking and grinding gears, hisses of steam and metal hitting metal only grew louder with his presence. Iris was amazed.\n\n”--the //Kaleidoscope//!”\n\nIf one’s eyes weren’t trained on the curious device in the center of the stage already, now they definitely were. Bouts of mild clapping sounded through the hall. Iris thought she was the loudest.\n\nThe mechanical man raised his arms, equally as converted as the rest of his body, to quiet down his audience. ”Please. I haven’t even demonstrated my machine yet!”\n\nThe man hurried over to the control panel, flicked a few levers under the curious gaze of the audience. Iris held her head up high to see each movement the metal man was making with the device’s flurry of settings. He pressed a button and turned back to the audience. ”The omniverse is a vast expanse of infinite possibilities; have you never wished to see every one?”\n\nThe device started spinning.\n\n”With the Kaleidoscope, the struggle of transport across universes, pocket dimensions and non-dimensions will be a thing of the past!”\n\nEach of the magnifying glasses positioned themselves downwards in a straight line. The light of the orb shone through them. A sight never before seen by the young Iris, strange tiny dots began to converge into a rectangular shape where the device was pointing at.\n\nSoon enough the shape became clearer and clearer, until it was a fully fledged, mahogany doorway. Every attendee was holding their breath (or an equivalent thereof) -- her father smirked, nodding silently.\n\n”This, my dear guests, is a Way. Portals, if you will,” he gestured theatrically, ”There are such Ways all around you, immaterial to your every sense. But they’re ther--”\n\nPercival Darke raised his hand. ”A hundred billion dollars,” he said, his pride radiating in his voice.\n\nIt was silent for a while. The metal man spoke up again: ”... With all due respect, Mr. Darke--”\n\n”200 billion!” a fleshy nightmare of tumours and eyestalks reverberated from the back rows.\n\n”Sir, please--”\n\n”A trillion dollars!” another person shouted.\n\nThe entire hall soon erupted into waves of shouting, raised arms, and higher and higher sums. Iris looked around, taking a certain joy from seeing all of these individuals, so friendly and cordial upon arrival, go at each other at their throats. She watched as the metal man’s expression turned from that of worry into a small smirk.\n\nPercival Darke remained calm and composed. He placed his hand on his daughter’s shoulder, looked at her and smiled. Iris smiled back.\n\n”350 quintillion dollars!” was the final offer, made by a walrus-sized 8-ball that was only partially intersecting with this universe.\n\nThe metal man looked about the crowd of people. His metal joints creaked and whined as he did so, before resting again. ”Well... anybody who can beat that offer?”\n\nThe room was silent. Not even his joints creaked. ”It’s settled, then--”\n\nPercival Darke raised his hand once more. Iris could feel the weight of a thousand pair of eyes settling on them. ”400 quintillion dollars, as well as the fifty percent of the profit made by Universe #34B86954620.”\n\nThe room was silent again, but now for a different reason. At least a minute passed -- Iris knew, because of the metal man’s ticking.\n\nA man stepped forward. The strange, morbidly obese, tophat-wearing man. The fat-ass had been standing in the corner of the hall for the entire presentation, just silently observing the proceedings. He stepped to the stage with a raised arm, everyone’s gaze fixed upon him now.\n\nUpon seeing him from up close, he was uglier than she first thought -- a greasy beard, adorned with deep crevices, lips dry as the desert, pimples all over. He was smiling, though -- a wicked smile.\n\nFat-ass spoke: ”What did the robber say to the clock?”\n\nMetal man was perplexed. ”... Excuse me, sir--”\n\n”HANDS UP!”\n\nFat-ass threw a ball onto the floor, which burst into a million pieces. Black smoke leaked out of the shards that quickly tightened around the lungs of anyone nearby. Eyes became watery, coughs for air being the only sound one could hear for some time.\n\nPercival enveloped his daughter in the giant velvet cape of his, and held onto her tightly. He retrieved a gas-mask from his literal pocket-dimension on his pants, and pressed it against Iris’ face. Through the thick lenses of the mask, she saw Fat-ass dashing forward with surprising agility, tackling the metal man to the ground, and taking his device with him. \n\nHe opened a doorway and stepped through. The doorway closed and the man was gone. The device was gone with him.\n\nAfter the smoke dissipated did Percival Darke dare to peek from beyond the safe boundaries of his cape. Iris took a peek as well, the ramsacked stage and the faultering stance of the metal man slowly rising to his feet. She took the mask off, breathing in the still sickly sweet air.\n\nA cry of pain rang through the room. So loud, it reached another frequency entirely. It was the metal man, hunched over, on his knees, clasping at his face. ”No, no, no!”\n\nHe was kneeling right where his creation lied moments prior. What Iris could only presume to be years of work had been puffed out of existence. There was a flyer with grease and thick oil marks on the stage. The metal man, upon spotting it, held it up to the light, the words //”Herman Fuller’s Circus of the Disquieting!”// still clearly visible on the faded colors. And in the middle the Fat-ass’ face, grinning mischievously.\n\nThe other participants converged around that single sheet of paper, and looked at it with such hate and anger, Iris thought the flyer would disintegrate into dust. She stared at those faded, yet colorful words and that ugly visage for some time.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n**[[[Hell Hath No Fury than a Clown Scorned|Now]]]**\n*\n[[/=]]\n\nLolly hid behind a corner, her hot breath dissipating in the unfeeling air surrounding her. Her heart was thumping in her chest, she could feel it sounding in her ears. Footsteps echoed down the hall. Lolly fiddled around with a door control panel, while her back was pressed tightly afgainst the wall. The footsteps grew nearer and nearer, Lolly squinting her eyes to not witness the oncoming bloodbath of her blood and guts.\n\nBut the door finally opened, and Lolly hurried inside, the door sliding shut behind her. In the darkness of the room, her ears were piqued by the sounds of footsteps growing closer, before converging right outside the room--\n\nAnd they went on. She let out a long exhale, as she could feel her breathing slowing down, her heartbeat slowly beating at a normal pace again. She fumbled for a lightswitch. Her hand went up and down along the wall, ’til it eventually hit the switch, and flicked it on.\n\nEverything was plunged into a stark white, her squinting to make out anything in the blinding brightness. There were shelves. Rows upon rows of them. Lolly took a second to admire the vastness of the room and the items on them.\n\nShe walked past them, continuing on on her mission, but never averting her eyes from the flurry of curious items fully -- an inside-out plushie, a red super-ball, and something that reeked of bananas. She wasn’t here for any of those items, though. She was here for the Kaleidoscope.\n\nThere was a heavy metal door marked with ”Vavluable Items Storage”. Looking to the door’s right, there was yet another control panel. She didn’t have the skills to hack into the panel -- heck, she was surprised it worked just then. With no knowledge of circuits, she opted to just type in numbers and hope for the best. Surprisingly (or maybe not so much), the door slid open. The Kaleidoscope was behind that door, inside of that room, she could feel its presence. All of those nightmares of the past weeks would be gone, Manny would be okay again, and--\n\n//Him.// He’d be released from his prison. She didn’t know what he was truly capable of, but there was a reason why Manny and Fuller had locked him up for good. Maybe, just maybe, it was for the best that he stayed locked up, if she didn’t do what she planning on doing. Never to see the light again, to feel wind brushing past his skin, that sensation of--\n\nElectricity sparked through her body. The figure of a man, holding some sort of weapon in his hand, turned into a haze of images. Lolly tumbled to the floor unceremoniously.\n\n”Lock her up now,” a female voice sounded.\n\nHer eyes became heavy, her limbs went limp.

The tears welled-up in her eyes, her hands clenching onto the carpet below. She couldn’t move, nor could she breathe; her eyes wide open in an expression of sadness, anger and disgust.\n\nTabernackle watched as Icky fell to the floor. She didn’t know how to respond to any of this -- whether to be reassuring, angry at her for scaring her customers away, or if she should just leave through the back entrance. Tabernackle the Great gave out an ethereal sigh and moved closer to the folded-in stance Icky’s back was doing.\n\nTabernackle looked at Icky. Really looked at Icky, down to her heart and soul. There was nothing, but pure pain. She had clients and customers before from worlds far weirder than those of the circus. They came to her for help or just for a nice chat. People came to her spilling out all of their deepest secrets, problems they never could tell anyone. Icky was one such person -- a rude one for simply barging in during a session -- but one such person nonetheless.\n\nTabernackle took a deep breath in and approached Icky. ”Geez... okay. Uhm...” it sounded in Icky’s head. She briefly turned to look at Tabernackle. ”So, eh, well, how do I put this, I //could// help you find her.”\n\nIcky jumped to her feet. Her fingers embedded themselves deep into Tabernackle’s soft tissues, that sensation causing her to wince slightly. She lost herself in Icky’s eyes for just a moment, before she snapped out of it.\n\n”You can do it?” Icky said almost too fast for the ear to hear.\n\n”Y--yes. But only if you compensate me enough for my troubles. I gotta pay rent. You know how the library is about this sorta stuff,” Tabernackle stammered slightly.\n\n”The circus got all the wealth in the world. What do I need to do?”\n\nTabernackle pointed with her fingers at the glassy orb. ”Think about her. Good memories.”\n\nIcky finally let go of Tabernackle, who stepped away just in case she came close to her again. Her soul stopped beating when Icky inched just a few inches closer to her again, but she only placed the orb on the table next to her. Icky sat down at the table, her breaths stammering.\n\nIcky placed her hands on the orb, her hands feeling as cold as they looked.

Her wails vibrated through the fabric of the tent, as near blinding light shone out of her wounds. Purple blood began to stain the tool and Manny’s clothes.\n\nTinkles rushed into action, all of the adrenaline and clown milk rushing through his nervous system. He placed a kick in Manny’s chest. Manny tumbled to the ground, where he thrashed around like an infant, crying and manically laughing all the same.\n\n”R--recite them...”\n\n”What?!” Tinkles’ eyes darted from Manny to Tabernackle.\n\n”Recite t--the incantations...”\n\nHe could think straight again. The ice in his brain thawed out. Manny rose up from the ground, bloodied scalpel in hand. He looked at him with a twisted smile, his eyes lit up brighter than the most fiery pits of hell.\n\n”Ch--chir...” he stuttered, his tongue frozen in place.\n\n--Manny-- Bobble smiled a wicked smile, before he charged at Dr. Tinkles. His arms and legs wailed wildly through the air. The image of a marionette was what came to Tinkles’ mind, and that of Chucky the killer-doll with that little knife of his.\n\n//”Chirgarroh llorum buddrll!”// Tinkles screamed from the bottom of his lungs. Manny tumbled to the floor. Like an infant tumbling down a flight of stairs. The scalpel left his hands all the same.\n\nFor a moment, Manny just laid there, face-down. But then he rose to his feet again. Tinkles grapped the scalpel, pointing it at his colleague and friend. The bloodied scalpel was shaking in his two, way too large hands, his eyes never leaving Manny out of his sight.\n\nManny grunted, rubbing his temple. When Tinkles looked him in the eyes, the darkness that had filled them seconds prior had disappeared. Life had returned in those eyes. ”What... what is--” Manny’s words were quickly cut off by Tinkles wrapping his arms tightly around him.\n\n”It’s good to see you back, Manny.”\n\nTinkles looked over his friend’s shoulder, only to be greeted with the stagnant figure of Tabernackle the Great on the cold floor. He immediately stood up and rushed to the magician’s side. Tabernackle coughed out purple drops of blood, floating on the ceiling. She had a smile on her face. ”You d--did a pretty fine job there...”\n\nShe coughed out more blood. More than should have passed through her mouth. It seeped into the earthern ground below, staining the deepest of water reservoirs, before Tabernackle moved the edges of her mouth into one last smile.\n\nTinkles gave her a farewell in his head. Manny was just confused and horrified.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nBobble screamed into the metaphysical void. He screamed, and screamed, and screamed with no end. Ripples were sent all throughout it.\n\nThen he saw a man. A little man sprinting through some corridors. Physically, he was fine. But his heart was broken. Shattered into billions of fragments\n\nHe had one last trick up his sleeve. In the end, Bobble would have the last laugh.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\nA bullet here, a bullet there. A bullet everywhere. She charged down the corridors. The smell of cream pies, bubble gum, iron blood and so much more flew into her nostrils. It was almost mesmerizing.\n\nThe Kaleidoscope was exactly where she remembered it being. She looked around for a while, before spotting the simple carabiner mechanism of how the device was strapped down. She broke open the clamps. Once unlocked, she had to figure out a way of how to move--\n\n”LOLLY!”\n\nIt was Icky’s voice. But not as vibrant and confident as it had been just minutes ago. No, it sounded booming, as if her ears were about to pop out of her skull. Lolly realized too late that that wasn’t a result of Icky’s voice, but the shot of a shotgun unloading right in front of her.\n\nLolly tumbled to the floor. She reached for her chest and there was no blood. No innards. No gaping hole or whatever else she had imagined. Quiet, heaving breaths unfolded on the ground right next to her. And the smell of blood.\n\nIcky convulsed, blood spurting out of a gaping hole in her chest. Seconds turned into hours. She could see each contortion of her partner’s soft, pink flesh, each sound of a drop of blood. She snapped out of it. And without even thinking, Lolly grabbed Icky’s gun and unleashed a hail of bullets on their assailant.\n\nMatt Mattson leaked out blood from every orifice imaginable. He stumbled to the floor, just like Icky had, and crashed his head against the Kaleidoscope’s console. Lolly was too worried to notice. She cradled Icky’s warm, wet body in her arms. She waived away a streak of Icky’s jet black hair to see into her beautiful eyes. Tears built up in her eyes. Icky herself waived aside some of Lolly’s hair. They stared into each other’s eyes, near motionless, locked in silence.\n\n//He heard a voice in his head. In the darkest pits of his mind. He didn’t know who the voice belonged to, but it told him of a chance. A chance to avenge his loved one.//\n\nThere was still some life in him left. Twitching fingers, blinking eyes. He neared himself toward the device. Inch by inch, he crawled toward it like some maggot on a corpse. Rotten, near dead.\n\n”B--behi...” Icky stammered out.\n\nThere was this moment, where Lolly couldn’t understand anything Icky was saying. Like white noise on a TV. Too late did she realize what her partner was uttering. And when she did finally realize, a Way had been opened.\n\nThe entire room was consumed by every color unimaginable. Up-beat music straight out of the circus’ calliope boomed in their skulls. Lolly pressed her hands against her ears, but not even that was enough to drown out the noise.\n\nAnd then Bobble stepped out of the Way, in all his glory. Everyone laid there, frozen. He righted his fly, looked around, and let out the most soul-quenching scream ever heard. It was a scream of joy, of celebration.\n\nFrom the top of his lungs, Bobble yelled: //**”GUESS WHO’S BACK!”**//\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n*\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n**« [[[Hell Hath No Fury than a Clown Scorned|Episode 1: Hell Hath No Fury than a Clown Scorned]]] | [[[Dread & Circuses Hub|HUB]]] | [[[bobble-the-last-dance|FINALE: Bobble - The Last Dance]]] »**\n[[/=]]\n\n------\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n\n@@ @@",
