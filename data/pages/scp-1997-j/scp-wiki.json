SCP-1997-J is to be informed that the Foundation is inflicting the maximum amount of human suffering possible with the weapons that are purchased from the entity. MTF Beta-17 (\"Princes of the Mountain\") have been stationed at Site-47 for the purpose of responding to any threat posed by SCP-1997-J and other nearby anomalous activity.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1997-J is an anomalous human male. It is capable of manifesting what appears to be an infinite number of weapons[[footnote]]These weapons include firearms, blunt weapons, bladed weapons, incendiary devices, cryonic devices, nuclear warheads, and energy weapons that do not appear to have their origins in technology currently available to humanity.[[/footnote]] at an average rate of two weapons per hour. SCP-1997-J stores these weapons in a close proximity to itself for the purposes of the sale of said weapons.\n\nSCP-1997-J is capable of speaking English, and it does so with a Texan accent. When interacting with humans, SCP-1997-J often attempts to sell its manifested weapons with the other individual interacting with it. SCP-1997-J is generally amiable[[footnote]]Although, it has been noted that SCP-1997-J struggles with anger management.[[/footnote]], and individuals it interacts with have no obligation to purchase SCP-1997-J's goods. SCP-1997-J has expressed no desire to exit Foundation custody under the condition that the Foundation purchases, and causes human suffering with, the weapons the entity manifests. \n\nSCP-1997-J often cites the infliction of pain as its purpose in the sale of its weapons. SCP-1997-J also often fixates on the infliction of pain when conversing, even if its weapons or their sale are not the topic of discussion. SCP-1997-J also often claims that it engages in the sale of its weapons to support its family financially and to stimulate the economy of the local community.\n\n**Addendum.1997-J.1:** Interview Log\n\n> **Interviewed:** SCP-1997-J\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Agent Robert Gribble\n> \n> **Date:** 09/13/2009\n> \n> //Note-Audio begins as Agent Gribble is in a standing position adjacent to SCP-1997-J.//\n> \n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Hello, SCP-1997-J.\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Hey there! What's your name?\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Robert. I go by-\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Ah, hey there Bobby! I've got a few rifles you suit boys might like.\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** I go by Rob, SCP-1997-J. And we'll be buying out your stock on Tuesday, as usual.\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Alright then. Those guns really hurt if you hit a man in the knee, I'll tell you what.\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Don't worry about it, we know how to hurt people well enough. I actually have a few questions for you, if you don't mind.\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Alright, fine. You people are always asking me questions.\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Well, I thought that you of all people could appreciate me just doing my job.\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** You're right about that, mister. This country was built on honest men doing honest work. \n> \n> //Agent Gribble sits in the chair directly opposite of SCP-1997-J.//\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Alright, first question. How would you describe your daily life before you entered Foundation custody?\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J** Well, I like to think I lived a good life. I woke up, I kissed my wife, ate bacon, ran my store. Some days, I'd stand on the street and have a beer with a couple of old friends of mine.\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** And you don't...miss them at all?\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Well, I'll say that I do miss my town and the shop and all that...but I'll tell you what, sometimes, a man has to make sacrifices to do what he needs to do. I myself sell guns and knives to hurt people, because that's what I need to do.\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Yes, and we're sure to use your weapons to the best of our abilities. Next up, why do you want to hurt people?\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Now, that's a very personal question. What if I asked you what you do with your wife at night?\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** It's just a question on the sheet, we just gotta get-\n> \n> //While speaking, one of Agent Gribble's gesticulations causes his arm to make contact with a glass placed on the table separating the agent and SCP-1997-J. This causes the glass to fall onto its side, and the water it contains pours out from the glass's interior onto the table. This causes a portion of the water to stain SCP-1997-J's shirt, which agitates the entity.//\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Damn it, Bobby!\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Oh, shit, I'm sorry-\n> \n> //SCP-1997-J rises from its seat and leans forward. It begins to aggressively point its finger at Agent Gribble.//\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** Now, let me tell you something. You people have a problem with respect! I'm just an honest man trying to cause pain in this country, and all I get is a bunch of questions every week like I'm at the doctor's office!\n> \n> **Agent Gribble:** Dude, I'm sorry, we try to help-\n> \n> **SCP-1997-J:** No, you listen to me, mister, or I'm going to kick your ass! I am a decent American man. I am pro-pain, and I provide the people of this community with pro-pain accessories. And when I see you government suit types spending my hard earned tax dollars on a bunch of interview paper sheets and nagging questions, oh, it just makes me, it just makes me wanna...\n> \n> //SCP-1997-J rubs its head. It then anomalously manifests a revolver. It does not attempt to assault Agent Gribble with the firearm. Due to this action, and the agitated state that SCP-1997-J had entered, Dr. Hill concludes the interview, and Agent Gribble was permitted to exit the interview room.//\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** weapons.jpg\n> **Name:** Dangerous weapons seized from holiday flights at Manchester Airport\n> **Author:** ukhomeoffice\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [[[https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dangerous_weapons_seized_from_holiday_flights_at_Manchester_Airport.jpg|Wikimedia Commons]]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
