When not in use for testing, SCP-1239-1 and removable instances of SCP-1239-3 are to be kept outside of SCP-1239-2 in dedicated storage lockers to prevent accidental activation. SCP-1239-2 should be soundproofed, with all windows obscured from the outside.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1239 consists of 3 (three) components:\n\n* SCP-1239-1, a lamp with a standard low voltage power cable, containing artificial flora with 4 (four) flower-like lightbulbs. The words “Hey Kids!” are engraved on the lid.\n\n* SCP-1239-2, a residence in ██████████, ███████.\n\n* SCP-1239-3, a specific set of objects present within SCP-1239-2 at time of recovery.\n\nThe anomalous effects of SCP-1239 manifest if SCP-1239-1 is powered and viewed by a post-pubescent human subject while both are within SCP-1239-2. Following this, the subject will experience a series of conditional hallucinations until exiting SCP-1239-2, as follows:\n\n* Subjects will perceive samples of SCP-1239-3 to be different objects. This is apparently consistent between subjects, as all subjects tested have perceived respective SCP-1239 samples in the same way.[[footnote]]For an extensive list of SCP-1239 samples and their respective hallucinated appearances, please refer to Document 1239-B[[/footnote]] Objects present within SCP-1239-2 other than SCP-1239-3 will be perceived normally by affected subjects.\n\n* Subjects will perceive any prepubescent or pubescent individuals present within SCP-1239-2 as highly amiable, despite the subjects' prior dispositions or relationship with children, and will express a desire to engage in play activities.\n\n* Subjects will perceive all expressions of discomfort, pain or displeasure produced by pre-pubescent and pubescent individuals within SCP-1239-2 as expressions of pleasure or enjoyment.\n\nUpon exiting SCP-1239, the hallucinatory symptoms caused by exposure to SCP-1239-1 will cease, and are removed retroactively (i. e., the subject will remember observing SCP-1239-3 samples as they would normally appear, and will be unable to recall experiencing the hallucinations previously caused by SCP-1239). Behaviour caused by SCP-1239, however, will be recalled with an expected degree of detail. As a result of this, subjects are able to recall actions made under the influence of SCP-1239, but are unable to recall the motivation for said actions.\n\n**Summarised Recovery Log:** SCP-1239 was first identified shortly after an incident occurring in SCP-1239-2 on ████-07-██, in which the respective parents of 10 (ten) children, who had agreed to meet as part of a social event, were exposed to SCP-1239-1. The affected individuals (of which there were 6 (six)) were interviewed and dealt with as per Recovery Protocol 8. A cover story regarding a toxic gas leak was later circulated, and the remains of the children incinerated after analysis.\n\n**Note:** Testing regarding SCP-1239 has determined that no direct or compulsive behavioural alterations result from exposure to SCP-1239-1.\n\n**Excerpt from Document 1239-B**\n||~ SCP-1239-3 sample ||~ Description ||~ Hallucinated Appearance ||\n|| SCP-1239-12 || A kettle composed of plastic and stainless steel. || A polystyrene sword. ||\n|| SCP-1239-13 || A large oven. || A cardboard box, with the words “FORT” written on it in felt-tip pen, and an apparatus with the words “FUN CONTROLS” written above it which corresponds to the dials. The text representing the maximum temperature (200°C) the temperature dial can be set to has been replaced with the word “MAXIMUM FUN”, and the words “FUN BUTTON” have been printed above the button activating the device.||\n|| SCP-1239-14|| A Glock 19 pistol. || A toy handgun, which produces a low-energy red laser upon the trigger being pulled.
