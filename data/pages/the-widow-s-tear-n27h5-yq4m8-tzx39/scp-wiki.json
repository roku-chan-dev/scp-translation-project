Curious, we decided to dig and uncovered a metal cylinder containing fifteen copper vials and a piece of paper with writing on it. _\n _\nWe carefully sawed open one of the vials and found it contained water. After running tests, we were shocked to discover that the water was still in pristine condition, even though the vial and cylinder were about 110 years old. _\n _\nOne of our friends drank the water and later reported feeling noticeably better, and his cold had even disappeared. Intrigued, we injected the liquid into sick animals, such as rats and stray dogs, and saw them recover instantly. Realizing how unique this discovery was, we decided to halt further testing after confirming these results. _\n _\nWe also attempted a rough translation of the paper, which was written in Russian. In English, it read: _\n _\n//\"Dear wife, this is for you. I wish to give you this gift that I have prepared. I searched for a cure for your face and found magical water from// (unreadable) //in Astrakhan. This water relieved my pain, and I thought it might cure your disease as well. I must gather the// (unreadable) //from the farmers, and I hope you will find my gift helpful.\"//||\n||||~ File Opened Under:|||| N27H5/YQ4M8/TZX39 ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Darke, Ltd.||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||~ Inventory Information||\n||||||~ N27H5/YQ4M8/TZX39 ||\n||~ Owner ||~ Quantity ||~ Comments||\n|| Leonard Shaw || 15 (vials) || Initial Discovery ||\n|| Marshall, Carter and Dark Ltd. || 4 || Items kept in storage until next auction. ||\n|| Biological Research and Mass Storage Corporation (BRMSC) || 2 || 2 vials purchased by BRMSC for undisclosed research purposes. ||\n|| Customers || 2 || Items purchased by customers for personal uses. ||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n\n---------------------\n\n||||||||~ Auction Record 01||\n||||||||~ N27H5/YQ4M8/TZX39 ||\n||~ Date || February 23, 2011 ||~ Location || London ||\n||~ Auctioneer || Marcus Locke ||~ Lot || 1 of 8 ||\n||~ Listing |||||| Marshall, Carter & Dark Ltd. proudly presents The Widow’s Tear, a vial of pure, untouched perfection that has remained sealed for over a century.

To prevent suspicion, Foundation operatives manipulated records and implanted false memories, ensuring that each affected individual believed they had instead spent their money on rare and extravagant artifacts, none of which had any anomalous properties. _\n _\nThe liquid contained in the vials were later identified as SCP-006.||\n||||||||~ Marshall, Carter and Dark, Ltd.||\n\n---------------------\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
