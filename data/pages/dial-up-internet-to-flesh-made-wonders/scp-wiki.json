They expect us, because of the powers they have constructed, because of the god they prostrate themselves feebly for, to abandon our women without wombs, to shame them for holding the title of mother within our societies—all because they cannot give birth, considered most frontal in their minds of the value a woman brings. Children to them only exist for the family, for work, for money—can’t you see how little they know of freedom from this?\n\nTheir systems are set in place by the laws and machines of which they control.

Sixteen cycles at minimum—”\n\nThe woman pushes up her glasses, running her hands over her cold briefcase stoically. Stolidly.\n\n“Sir Amos requires your craft for a fresco to be displayed at a gathering in Prague. It will occur within the next fortnight—shipping from this location will take three days.

Heraldā trips, but is lifted up by the other believers, cooing and encouraging her with warm, gentle aphorisms.\n\n“There is potential in her.” The woman’s hair is darker than night in the shrouded, throat-like walls of the sanctum. “And she would have been killed in a raid had she not come here, by the way.”\n\nKarcist’s Iuyanā reels. “What—?!” A long, scaled wing finds its way to cover her mouth. \n\n“…Surely you jest—”\n\n“The Foundation and G.O.C just razed one of the Saint’s Facilities,” the woman replies coolly. “That snake—the worship of her led to bloody murder.”\n\nA printer begins whirring.

Their technology lay scattered, crushed, broken and beaten, glittering like ugly stars. Many have suffered caustic burns in an attempt to separate them from their body-modifications.\n\nA smile forms on the woman’s face as she watches Karcist Iuyanā shudder and skip a breath.\n\n“This could have been her. Her parents were caught in this, do you understand that? She would have been left to her own devices, her body strewn along gunfire, flash grenades, and—”\n\n“//Please,//” that deep, dual-toned voice snaps.

They will not show you mercy simply because you take in the beaten and the damned.”\n\nKarcist Iuyanā shivers.\n\n“…Enough. Please,” she whimpers. Her heart aches at the thought of their newborn convert splattered aimlessly against a granite wall.\n\nShe shakes her head at those who stumble at her uncertainty, pointing to Heraldā. \n\n“…We will have something ready as soon as possible…” she mutters to the woman.\n\n“Wonderful.” That black lipstick smile smirks. “I’m glad our arrangement will continue. The company would hate to see your beautiful coven dashed to pieces…”\n\nShe smiles as Karcist Iuyanā holds back tears, these to pour black as tar. Had she let them fall, the good air of the ceremony would have been broken, their scent unbearable and like leaded adder’s flesh—she could not allow that. Not again. Such was an affront to the Great Shepherd, the Ionian Hands which guided them. Which saved them. Which saved this wastrel.\n\n“I…I understand…”\n\nThe woman quickly packs up her things.\n\n“Thank you.
