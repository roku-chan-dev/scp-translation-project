This has no meaning whatsoever to the article. Enjoy!\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:theme:last-frontier]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-7928\n\n**Object Class:** Ticonderoga[[footnote]] Cannot be contained, but does not need to be contained[[/footnote]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-7928 is located far enough outwards from Earth so as to pose zero threat whatsoever. --In the event that SCP-7928 does pose a threat (predicted chance of 0.1%) to Earth, utilize Tau-Rho Exclusion Protocol. Beholder-15 is currently observing SCP-7928.-- See Transcript 3. Due to this, Binary_Star.aic has manually separated a copy of itself into Beholder-15 to prevent malfunction. Beholder-15 is imbued with reconstruction properties in case of damage.\n\n**Description:** SCP-7928 refers to a Tau-Rho (“eldritch”) entity referring to itself as “Tr’Kxladi, the outer god of interruption and mortal foil.” SCP-7928 mainly appears yellow, with magenta eyes shaped like human eyes.\n\nSCP-7928 has several hazardous effects typical of Tau-Rho entities. These effects include, but are not limited to:\n* Cognitohazardous effects such as causing derangement, fervor in regards towards SCP-7928’s worship, and agitation.\n* Antimemetic properties, causing some individuals to have no perception of SCP-7928. SCP-7928 takes both pride and shame in this ability.\n* The ability to remotely rearrange some organs, as well as instantly drain the blood of most living organisms. [[footnote]] Based on records on Tau-Rho entities that reference SCP-7928[[/footnote]]\n\nDue to Beholder-15 being mechanical, none of these hazards affect it. Furthermore, SCP-7928 has many non-hazardous abilities, being:\n* The ability to shapeshift\n* Ability to view and edit text\n* The ability to speak several languages, including some that originated on Earth\n\nSCP-7928 frequently attempts to speak with Beholder-15 about a variety of topics. These are recorded in the transcripts below.\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"\\beholder15\\\\Files\\\\\\Transcripts\\\\\\\\7928encount1\" hide=\"\\beholder15\\\\Files\\\\\\Transcripts\\\\\\\\7928encount1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n<Begin Log>\n\n//Beholder-15 is scanning the surrounding area for spatial anomalies.//\n\n//SCP-7928 is spotted in the form of a large orb with several eyes.//\n\n**BEHOLDER-15:** GREETINGS.

It has been amenable to sharing information that would otherwise be nigh-impossible to obtain, as long as it is repeatedly reminded that it poses a significant threat to life in the universe. BEHOLDER-15's mission has been altered to include maintaining SCP-7928's mood.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7927]]] | SCP-7928 | [[[SCP-7929]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=Everturning]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
