Functionally, it is a region of memoryspace with extreme specificity, preferring its affected sectors be filled with whitespace at any given time. Because of this, any blackbox data constrained to this area will invariably prompt an event to occur. The nature of this event remains unclear, however, the following factors are known:\n\n* At the moment of activation, all blackbox data in this region immediately converts into whitespace\n\n* The effect will \"ripple\" outwards, converting blackbox data into whitespace in adjacent sectors\n\n* This will continue until all overwritable data is removed from the Database, leaving read-only materia intact \n\n* The event then ceases and will not occur until the next activation response \n\nDespite the appearance of chaotic behavior, SCP-{{NaN}} adheres to a rigid internal logic. Notably:\n\n* The response region does not expand, nor does its behavior evolve\n\n* Random activations correlate inversely with the availability of writable whitespace. This equilibrium dynamic suggests SCP-{{NaN}}’s purpose may involve maintaining Database stability, albeit through destructive means\n\nDespite this destructive tendency, SCP-{{NaN}} is paradoxically indispensable for long-term data preservation. Deletions agents have theorized its function as an evolutionary failsafe, designed to \"reset\" informational entropy within complex data ecosystems.\n\nSCP-{{NaN}} therefore represents the only known method for permanent and complete removal of dormant Deletions personnel without reliance on natural overwrite protocols. While such usage is officially discouraged due to the collateral damage risk, SCP-{{NaN}} has been deployed experimentally to eliminate certain \"[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_swan_theory black swan]\" anomalies. This process ensures irretrievability while circumventing conventional containment limitations.\n[[span style=\"top:3px; right:5px; position:absolute;\"]][[size 50%]]//{{preserved via 'ACCUMULUS' backup system}}//[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"▼\" hide=\"COLLAPSE THIS SEGMENT\" hideLocation=\"top\" folded=\"yes\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"darkpanel storm large thin\"]]\n[[span style=\"top:3px; right:5px; position:absolute;\"]][[size 50%]]//{{preserved via 'ACCUMULUS' backup system}}//[[/size]][[/span]]\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]ADDENDUM {{NaN}}/{{NaN}}[[/span]] \n@@ @@\n[[<]]\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8909/DD.png width=\"75%\"]]\n= [[size 90%]]SCP-{{NaN}} during [[span class=\"bd\"]]OPERATION FIREWALL[[/span]].[[/size]] \n----\n@@ @@\n[[span class=\"bd\"]]OPERATION FIREWALL[[/span]] is an ongoing effort by the Department of Deletions to promote both external Database cohesion and internal departmental stability. Specifically, its primary mission is the eradication of SCP-{{NaN}}-Alpha through usage of ALG-{{NaN}}.[[footnote]]Algorithm {{NaN}} is a series of targeted actions by Deletions personnel that, when executed in sequence, triggers a localized activation response from SCP-{{NaN}}.

However, their corrupted Semblance renders them incompatible with standard Database operations, including safe incorporation in an unaffected gestalt, necessitating their erasure via SCP-{{NaN}}.\n\nOperational personnel must recognize that the Semblance corruption is irrecoverable.
