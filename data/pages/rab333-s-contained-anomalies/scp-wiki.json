My first article, clocking in at almost 3k words, I spent about two months writing, refining, rewriting this piece, with about a dozen people looking over it from the beginning to the end. Now, I can't say that it did too well, but I'm ecstatic for the simple fact that it survived. Who doesn't like Jesus?

From inception to posting it took just a few (I think three or four) short days, and people seem to have quite enjoyed it. It's also based on one of the shittiest jokes I've ever come up with, so there's that.
