It devours all forms of heat, and wields it as a devasting weapon. Many caught in its path are quickly turned to ash. It serves the Scarlet King under the fearsome rank of cadre, faithfully spreading death and destruction wherever it may go.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Illustration**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/dc/Blotter_explosion-spin_art.jpg]]\n\nA painting titled //Death Below// by Qul-Eifi the Teal Feathered Mage of Kul-Manas.

See Observations & Stories for an excerpt.\n\n[[=image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/ce/Soft_explosion_I.jpg]]\n\nAn untitled painting of Plaunedas detonating itself.[[footnote]] \"With all due respect, it doesn't really look like it. I thought it was a bad coffee stain. It needs a mix of orange and red to look more like fire.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"Based on the information I could find, I think the artist just perceives color differently.\" - M [[/footnote]] It was made by an anonymous individual who survived an encounter with it during a Scarlet Horde invasion. However, thirty-four of their eyes were blinded, and they suffered terrible burns. See Observations & Stories for their testimony of the encounter in //A Collection of Art Commentary//.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Knowledge**\n[[/=]]\n\n**Traits:** Plaunedas is an amorphous, grey-colored creature resembling an amoeba. It is capable of forming limbs such as pseudopods or mimic shapes. The size of Plaunedas can vary by using heat to facilitate its growth. It is incapable of speech. Furthermore, the beast can reproduce by splitting, which share a single mind across Creation.\n\n**Nature:** Plaunedas is a dangerous being loyal to the cause of the Scarlet King. Its mind is like that of a common war beast. Therefore, reasoning with the cadre is a futile effort, and it will slaughter without mercy.\n\nThe creature's strength is the absorption of heat. It allows it to grow, multiply, and unleash immense explosions that can devastate worlds. There are no known limits to how much it can consume.[[footnote]] \"It would be too dangerous to find out.\" - L.S. [[/footnote]] Merely touching the creature can be dangerous. A mortal being can be robbed of their body heat, causing their swift demise. The creature can also be boiling hot or engulfed in flames. Inhospitable temperatures within its vicinity is another concern. Areas can become infernos or unusually cold. Fortunately, Plaunedas and its duplicates can eventually be depleted of heat.[[footnote]] \"Only if you are extremely lucky to survive until then. It could probably take years for all we know. There is also the issue of other heat sources that could prolong it. Overall, it's a long battle of attrition that isn't worth it.\" - H.J.[[/footnote]]\n\n**History & Associated Parties:** Plaunedas was born in the Darkness Below[[footnote]] Also known as Y'gashot by its inhabitants. [[/footnote]] from the aftermath of two nameless gods that fought to the death. One mastered absorption while the other was heat. Their blood mixed together to spawn Plaunedas, and it feasted upon the warmth of their bones to become a great sea. When the Scarlet King rose to power Plaunedas was conscripted into his army, and quickly received the rank of cadre for its destructive power.\n\nMany beings in the Scarlet Horde work with Plaunedas. The children of A'tivik and A'nuht[[footnote]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20240421171919/https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dust-and-blood A'tivik and A'nuht are the first and sixth brides of the Scarlet King, respectively.] [[/footnote]] are known to command it. The latter provides assistance against enemies who are powerful in the ways of magic. Other members of the Scarlet King's cadre occasionally collaborate with Plaunedas. For example, there are accounts of [[[Ero'Vahk]]][[footnote]] Ero'Vahk is a defector who now worships the Almighty. Notably, he founded the Christian theme park known as JesusLand. See his entry written by the Hand for further information. [[/footnote]] unleashing it behind enemy lines. Higher ranking subordinates of the Scarlet King regularly use Plaunedas in their campaigns such as [[[General Moloch]]], [[[Lord Goran]]], and [[[Lord Jeser]]]. [[[General Hatter]]] in particular has incorporated Plaunedas into some of his mechanical forms, utilizing it as a shield and fail-deadly.[[footnote]] \"This is the worst scenario. You can't destroy Hatter's body in certain ways (e.g. explosions) or you end up with a deadlier Plaunedas. However, you will still have to fight it even if you didn't use anything with heat. You have to get a bit creative.\" - Kunj [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"We are fortunate that Hatter holds back thanks to his obsession over Everett Mann.\" - L.B.[[/footnote]] It is reported that the Scarlet Horde would feed stars to the creature when they aren't given to the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/factory-hub Robber Barons].[[footnote]] \"In case anyone is wondering, stars are worth a lot to the Robber Barons.

Thus far the Fae have been successful in fending off the creature. However, they occasionally invoke their goddess Yash[[footnote]] Yash is a goddess worshipped by all Fae.

However, there was still chaos everywhere as one would expect. I immediately took flight over the Great Shallow Sea where a battle was taking place. For the first time in ages, Wandering Striders and Ta'avi fought alongside each other against a common foe. It's a shame that was also the only time they could. As I soared through the sky there was a great fiery explosion emerging out of the sea below me, nearly knocking me down. Its red hue was blinding, and large waves rippled throughout to flood every shore nearby. Clouds of hot steam filled the sky. When the explosion finally faded away I saw Plaunedas, a creature bestowed with the scarlet rank of cadre. Its massive form was writhing across a flaming crater.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //Loss: Realms Ravaged by Scarlet Hordes//\n\n------\n\n//\"The last thing I saw with all my eyes together was a tear in the sky. A dark ooze started to leak out of it to the ground. Then, there was a bright flash that roared like thunder. Everything that was nearby became nothing. I had witnessed the power of Plaunedas, the explosive cadre of the Scarlet Horde. Thirty-four of my eyes were burned away while my skin sizzled. I experienced profound agony while the sound of war drums started to play in the distance. Fortunately, a stranger took me to safety along with others who were injured. Defense legions began to mobilize against the threat. After my recovery I felt the need to paint about the ordeal.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //A Collection of Art Commentary//\n\n------\n\n//\"When the Scarlet Horde came to our realm, the strongest warriors were assigned to confront a cadre. I was tasked with subduing Plaunedas. For the battle my arrows were cursed with ice, and I casted a flame resistant spell on my body. An entourage followed me to keep whatever company Plaunedas had with it occupied. At first the battle appeared to have been going in my favor. The arrows gradually extinguished the raging heat within the creature, trapping parts of it in ice, but it retaliated by burning everything to rejuvenate itself. The flames grew greater and greater, forcing me to seek higher ground. In hindsight, the damage could have been minimized by calling upon [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1936 Ssvlssr, the Shivering Mist of Constraints],[[footnote]] Ssvlssr is a benevolent god associated with containment.

Everything down below was burning. Plaunedas then assumed a new shape with two legs, and multiple tendrils that threw heated clouds of debris at me. Meanwhile, small pieces of my foe tried to sneak up on me to latch onto my body and explode. Overall, my arrows struggled to reach their intended target. I was quite surprised that the creature was capable of thinking in such a manner.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //War Testimonials: Volume 54//\n\n------\n\n//\"My master fell in battle when he confronted Plaunedas, the explosive cadre of the Scarlet Horde. His frosted sword brought forth a great storm of ice, and the dreadful creature responded in turn with raging heat. Me and my peers could only watch as our master fought with all his might. Meanwhile, floating high in the sky, a child of A'nuht was also spectating the battle. The landscape was devastated by exploding glaciers. Ice and fire struggled to overtake the other. Soon the battle reached its end inside a crater. My master was about to plunge a final blow, but a fragment of Plaunedas stealthily emerged from out of the ground. At some point it must have burrowed.//\n\n//\"The fragment quickly swallowed our master before unleashing a great fire. We had to avert our gaze for how bright it shined. By the time it faded away our master was gone; only his broken sword remained. Plaunedas had emerged triumphant, writhing. I wanted to at least retrieve the sword, but the child of A'nuht started to open Ways. We had no choice but to evacuate. If we did not then the teachings of our master would've perished alongside us on that terrible day.\"//\n\n- Excerpt from //History of the Wandering Ice Warriors, Students of Frosted Sword Master Ui'easlo M'poegr//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #112211; background:#EEF6EE; padding: 20px; margin-bottom: 3px;\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n**Doubt**\n[[/=]]\n\nSome firmly believe that there may actually be limits to how much heat Plaunedas can absorb. However, there's no way to verify the claim without endangering oneself or others. Furthermore, such knowledge is most likely not going to be beneficial in battle. Plaunedas will still be able to cause harm based on the fact that it already wields immense power. A hypothetical limit would not make much of a difference, which is already evident by its path of destruction. It also begs the question about what would happen if it reached a limit. Plaunedas could simply unleash all of its accumulated heat without any detriment.[[footnote]] \"It would be strange to assume something bad would happen to Plaunedas. What do they expect? It will explode itself to death? Melt? It doesn't make much sense if you think about it.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]][[footnote]] \"There is nothing wrong with wishful thinking.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]] Another issue with the belief of a limit is that it disregards the divine origins of Plaunedas. It is a remnant of two gods with a specialty. There are typically no limits to what such beings can do within their domain. Assuming otherwise is simply underestimating a powerful foe.\n\nThe loyalty of Plaunedas to the Scarlet Horde has also been questioned. There appears to be no particular reason for the creature's compliance.[[footnote]] \"Fearing the strength of the Scarlet King should be enough of a reason. Even a simple minded creature like Plaunedas should understand.\" - H.J. [[/footnote]] Therefore, it's believed that the creature could somehow be placated and controlled. The latter has raised concerns about others utilizing Plaunedas for their own nefarious purposes.[[footnote]] \"Nothing would really change in that scenario.\" - L.B. [[/footnote]] Notably, Qul-Eifi the Teal Feathered Mage has proposed corrupting the nature of Plaunedas with advance alchemy. Whether or not his proposal will succeed is unknown. As mentioned previously, it is difficult to conduct experimentation with Plaunedas. In the battlefield the Scarlet Horde will seek to foil any attempts against them.[[footnote]] \"When it comes to defeating the Scarlet King and his armies anything is worth a try.\" - M [[/footnote]] Regardless, one must do what is necessary to defeat Plaunedas.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock title=\"\"]]\n~~~~\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** Blotter explosion-spin art.jpg\n> **Author:** Señor Codo\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Blotter_explosion-spin_art.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** Soft explosion I.jpg\n> **Author:** Ezequiel Jimenez\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Soft_explosion_I.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
