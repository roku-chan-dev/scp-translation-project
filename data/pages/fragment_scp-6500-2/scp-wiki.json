These items are to be designated Non-Disruptive Anomalies, and their containment will be discontinued or reduced to simple observation. Operationally, this shall include, but is not limited to the following measures:\n\n* Humanoid anomalies with a record for cooperative behavior are to be injected or fitted with tracking devices (if their biology/anomaly allows for such measures) and released. Each may be provided with a new identity on a per-case basis;\n* Religious and mythical artefacts will be returned to their respective cultural lands or peoples;\n* Animals and other organisms will be released into the custody of Wilson's Wildlife Solutions or similar Groups of Interest with the means to care for them in a less restrictive environment;\n* Tomes and grimoires are to be turned over to Serpent's Hand operatives for return to the Wanderer's Library. An ambassador from the Library has granted the Foundation temporary immunity for overdue items;\n* Anomalous locales are to be afforded the same level of agency granted to Nexuses. Policing of their borders will be severely reduced.\n\nIt should be noted that the above actions have thus far been insufficient at reversing the effects of SCP-6500, but have somewhat slowed its process. \n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\n|name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/fragment%3Ascp-6500-2/2521remains.png\n|caption=The remains of  [*/scp-2521 SCP-2521].

Personnel accessing Protocol Sixth Sun materials should expect drastically atypical presentation formats as a necessary side-effect of these rituals, and of the thaumaturgical mechanisms protecting their contents.\n\n[[span class=\"bt\"]]__DESCRIPTION:__[[/span]] SCP-6500 is a process of entropy exclusively targeting the anomalous. This primarily affects, but is in no way limited to, various forms of thaumaturgy (colloquially known as \"magic\"). SCP-6500 is responsible for over 1,500 neutralizations of anomalous persons, items, areas, and phenomena over the past decade.\n\nSCP-6500 takes many forms; for example, a process of accelerated senescence in organic anomalies, including those heretofore considered immortal. Objects which are foreign to baseline reality -- whether it be through temporal displacement or transference from alternate or higher planes of existence -- have either faded to the point of intangibility before complete non-existence, or suffered violent structural collapse due to their incongruity with our physical laws.\n\nSince its formal recognition and study, it has been determined that SCP-6500 is hastened by containment efforts. Without intervention, the complete neutralization of all known and undiscovered anomalies is predicted to occur within a five-year period, irrevocably altering the state of the universe and rendering our organization obsolete.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\nFROM THE OFFICE OF O5-1\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[div class=\"paper\"]]\nQuiet days are upon us.\n\nOne would be forgiven for viewing this as a desirable goal. To be free from the anomalous. To usher in a new age of reason, where there can exist nothing outside our realm of understanding. A world where we would not have to watch our brethren die in the dark, unaccomplished and forgotten.\n\nOne would be forgiven for wanting to go home to their family, to look them in the eye and assure them everything is going to be okay. That there is nothing left to go bump in the night.\n\nOne would be forgiven.\n\nSince our inception, countless generations of noble men and women have dedicated their lives to the suppression of that which eludes understanding. They have stood stalwart on the precipice of the unknown, staring defiantly into the abyss. They mocked its gaze.\n\nWhy then, should we not honor their tradition? Why spurn their sacrifice? Why should we move to proliferate that which we've so stubbornly locked away?\n\nSCP-6500 represents the end of magic. The end of stories, and of dreams. The utter desolation of countless sapient, feeling lives. The destruction of communities. The fracturing of whole cultures and religions. It is an unnatural and intolerable eradication of untold worlds.\n\nIt is condemnation, unforgiving in its totality and unflinching in its march towards oblivion.\n\nTo allow for it to continue on its course is to fail in our mission to Protect. To cede to its influence would be to permit it to rob our world of wonder. To stand by would be tantamount to genocide.\n\nAnd that?

The only aspect of their tenure widely regarded to be factual is that the moniker \"O5-0\" was applied to them as an offense due to their refusal to hold a seat of leadership among the other Overseers. The following apocryphal accounts describe potential O5-0 candidates according to various sources:\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation table2\"]]\n= **\"The Ragged\"**\n\nAmong the primary accounts of O5-0 is the personal journal of the first O5-4. In it, O5-0 is described as a middle-aged Caucasian man hailing from an uncertain Nordic country, named Norris Arklay. He is described as an \"//aloof collector of curios with an air of affluence about him, all in tattered cloth ill-equipped to conceal his manhood. Had he been accompanied by mutts, one would think him Diogenes!//\"\n\nThroughout his writings, O5-4 characterizes Arklay as a madman, continually critiquing the burgeoning Council's decisions and directives while simultaneously distancing himself from a position of actual power. Only begrudgingly does O5-4 compliment Arklay, after an unnamed incident which saw Arklay devising a containment protocol for a self-replicating anomaly that had claimed two Foundation lives.\n\nOf Arklay's split from the Foundation, O5-4 writes: \"//We can only be better off without [him] ...the others seem to be bothered by the loss of his personal collection of artifacts and antiquities, but it is of no concern to me if he took his toys like a petulant child.//\"\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"notation table1\"]]\n= **\"The Florist\"**\n\nFrom the records of the Global Occult Coalition come a series of letters drafted by a member of the Bavarian Illuminati named Bertram Suthmeer, who had been tasked with spying on the early Foundation's members. Bertram tells of a young, olive-skinned woman named Nur who \"//holds no office, though her words nevertheless hold weight.//\" She is described as an accomplished botanist, seeking to explain the existence of the anomalous and their place in the natural order.\n\nDue to Bertram's focus on the more audacious actions of the main Council members, little attention is given to Nor over his years of observation. Though he admits to being unaware of the exact situation surrounding Nor's departure, he notes:\n\n\"//It is funny. I had always felt an unnerving sense of unease, and of danger, in my time documenting the actions of these animals. It was as if there was a weight about the air, a cold blanket of malaise and fear that fell upon me while in their presence.

Beyond the moral incentives for ethical treatment of the anomalous, its efficiency is undeniable.//\"\n\nHowever, their communications grew less frequent as the Ethics Committee became a self-governing body. In the months following their last communication, the Chair reports the internal arrest and trial of a high-ranking Foundation operative whom they identify by voice as Zero.

Surviving personnel were able to recover several dozen notes regarding four anomalous artifacts (collectively designated SCP-6500-α), alongside notation from O5-0.
