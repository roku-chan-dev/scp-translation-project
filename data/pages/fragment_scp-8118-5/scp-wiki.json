Room's one big window. Pitch black outside, from where I'm standing. I don't think there's anything past the glass.\n\n@@ @@\n\n//Footsteps.//\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** Haven't really caught my breath yet. It's all one piece of glass, spherical. There's a loveseat in the middle of the room, which I am not touching with a ten-foot pole.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** I don't see any way back out of the room that isn't where I came from, and I'd rather camp out here forever than go back.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**OBSERVER:** It was- It was really a sight, Archie.
