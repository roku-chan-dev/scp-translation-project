Agent ████ Bryce (MTF-B7) made a visual inspection of the area and noted three (3) bodies, all male, between the ages of ██ and 40 years. Dr. ███, also on-site, surmised from the relative position of subjects that Mr. ██████ (Age 32; hereafter referred to as Subject Zero) was the origin point of [REDACTED]. Subsequent subjects are presumed to have been exposed to SCP-009 while attempting to help Subject Zero back to the wreckage of the boat. During standard perimeter sweep, Agent ██████ Hewes located what appeared to be humanoid tracks leading Northeast. After brief deliberation, a three-man team consisting of Agents Hewes, Whitmore, and Cassidy was dispatched to investigate potential security breach.//\n\n**<Begin Log -  6:42:43 EST>**\n**Agent Hewes:** We’ve found something, Control. It’s a cave. The tracks lead inside.\n**Control:** Copy, Hewes. What do you see?\n**Hewes:** Looks like a crack in the ice, it's… maybe a meter tall. The opening’s not very wide.\n**Agent Whitmore:** Cap’n, we got a body!\n\n[Unidentified shuffling noises are heard.]\n\n**Control:** We didn’t copy, Hewes. Repeat.\n**Hewes:** There’s a subject here, control. Frozen in the Skip. Male… about 15. Looks like he was trying to crawl away from something. There’s a spear-gun here… also frozen. It’s been fired.\n**Control:** Any signs of trauma?\n\n[There is a pause.]\n\n**Agent Cassidy:** Without touching him, I can’t be sure. But it looks like he was stabbed by something. See how he’s gripping his chest here? Right where this spike is growing out… he might’ve been attacked.     \n**Hewes:** Did you hear her, control?\n**Control:** Affirmative. Tag the coordinates for recovery, and proceed into the cave.\n**Whitmore:** We usin’ live fire, cap’n?\n**Hewes:** There might be hostiles, so yes. But keep ‘em in single-shot mode. Don’t want the guns getting too hot.\n**Cassidy:** Good call. Don’t wanna’ end up like this guy.\n**Whitmore:** [unintelligible] ... that’s for sure.\n\n[Agents ready their weapons and proceed. Approximately two (2) minutes pass.]\n\n**Whitmore:** [unintelligible].\n**Control:** Please repeat, Hewes, we didn’t copy. \n**Hewes:** It's… there’s a chamber in here, control. I’d say… 5 or 6 meters in diameter. It’s filled with red ice. In the middle… there’s a pool. Looks about 3 meters wide. Depth unknown. \n**Cassidy:** ‘The fuck hap- [screams are heard]\n\n[Gunfire]\n\n**Control:** Hewes, come in! Are there hostiles?\n\n\n[There is a brief pause]\n\n**Hewes:** Fuckin’ hell… negative, control, just- … Jesus, a fucking polar bear. It's dead. There’s dozens of bodies here. Not human. I see a few seals, a snow fox… and a... What the hell?\n**Whitmore:** ‘Da fuck is that?\n**Cassidy:** No, no, no, no… oh, god. \n**Control:** Hewes? Do you copy?\n**Hewes:** Cassidy found a… um… a spider. A giant spider.\n\n[There is a pause, during which shuffling and hard breathing are heard]\n\n**Control:** Is it alive? What do you mean by giant?\n**Hewes:** I mean fucking huge, control! At least a meter leg span. It's frozen… wait, no… shit, I don’t see anything inside. It almost looks like it's //made// of this stuff.\n**Cassidy:** [unintelligible] not possible… we’re nowhere close to Germany.\n**Whitmore:** What? What about Germany?\n**Cassidy:** Cap’n, I’m pretty sure that’s thirty-twenty-three.\n**Control:** Repeat, captain?\n**Hewes:** Cassidy said the spider is [[[SCP-3023]]], control.\n\n[There is a pause.]\n\n**Control:** That’s not possible, Hewes. Why would she think that?\n**Cassidy:** [Voice elevated] I’m sure, Control! I’ve worked with 3023. It’s an instance made of Skip-Nine!\n**Whitmore:** Wait, what’s 3023?\n**Control:** That is classified. Agent Cassidy, you are to speak no more of this. If the specimen is destroyed, there is no reason to worry about it. Please continue your search.\n**Cassidy:** [Mumbling] But how the fuck did it get here?\n**Hewes:** We copy, control. Cassidy, sweep the perimeter. See if there’s any side tunnels.\n**Cassidy:** But-\n**Hewes:** ████, that’s an order.\n**Cassidy:** [Unintelligible].\n**Hewes:** █████, check these corpses. See if there’re any humans. \n**Whitmore:** On it.\n**Control:** Agent Hewes, how deep is the pool you mentioned?\n**Hewes:** Can’t see the bottom. God… I’m having [[[SCP-354]]] flashbacks… this is not cool.\n**Control:** Focus, captain. Is there anything nearby you can use to measure the depth?\n**Hewes:** [Pauses] Well, the spider has a spear sticking out of it.\n**Control:** Can you safely retrieve it?\n**Hewes:** The suit should protect me, right?\n**Control:** All the same, try not to touch the affected material. \n**Hewes:** Alright… I’ve got it… should work. Looks to be about 1.5 meters long. \n**Control:** Copy that, Hewes. Proceed with caution.\n\n[There is a pause.]\n\n**Hewes:** Well, it’s definitely more than a meter deep. I could go further, but I’d have to get my hand closer to that stuff… suit or no suit, I’d prefer not to do that.\n**Control:** Affirmative, Captain. We’ll dispatch some D-Class with gear to test that out. Continue your search. \n**Hewes:** Copy that… Well, I guess I’m-\n**Cassidy:** [Voice distant] Captain!\n**Hewes:** Stand-by, control. What is it, Cassidy?\n**Cassidy:** [Voice distant] I think you’re going to want to see this, sir! I think I know where the spider came from!\n**Hewes:** Control, I’m going deeper in the cave. \n**Control:** Affirmative, proceed.\n\n[Approximately one (1) minute of boots crunching on ice and packed snow]\n\n**Hewes:** ... Oh, that's not good.\n**Control:** What do you see, captain?\n**Hewes:** A... an aperture. About a meter in diameter. It's covered in the stuff... Cassidy! \n\n[10 seconds of silence]\n\n**Hewes:** ████, report!\n**Control:** Do you have a visual of Agent Cassidy?\n**Hewes:** No. Shit, she must've gone inside! \n**Control:** Please remain calm. Describe this aperture.\n**Hewes:** I- uh... it just looks like a tunnel, but there's no ice past the mouth - red or otherwise. I can make out a dim light coming from somewhere inside. Might be Cassidy's torch. \n**Control:** Is there anything else unusual?\n**Hewes:** Cassidy! Cassidy!\n**Control:** Captain Hewes, please respond. Is there anything else unusual about the tunnel?\n**Hewes:** Yeah, it's... it's wet. The walls are... and the floor. There's a puddle about a meter down. Shit, it's... the puddle is red.\n\n[A few minutes of breathing and shuffling noises]\n\n**Hewes:** Control, did you get that? \n**Control:** Affirmative. Stand-by.\n\n[30 seconds of breathing, followed by approaching footsteps]\n\n**Whitmore:** Yo, what's up? Where's Cassidy?\n**Hewes:** She went in there.\n**Whitmore:** ... Yo, Cassidy! Holla' back, girl!\n\n[30 seconds of Silence]\n\n**Hewes:** [unintelligible], Control, I'm going in there.\n**Control:** Negative, Hewes! We're rerouting a team of D-Class for recovery. Your orders are to withdraw the rest of your team and await further orders.\n**Hewes:** [DATA REDACTED]\n**Whitmore:** Whoa, hold up! Take it easy!\n**Control:** You have your orders, Hewes. I don't think I need to remind you [DATA EXPUNGED].\n\n[45 seconds of silence]\n\n**Hewes:** Copy, control... let's go, █████,\n**<End Log>**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
