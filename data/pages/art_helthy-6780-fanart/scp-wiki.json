Vikander-Kneed. I was wondering when I would be drawing an art piece on them.\n\nLet me say this right off the bat: I enjoy reading VKTM articles. The combination of batshit hijinks and disturbing playoffs is very entertaining, and I really do think more authors should take the chance to read some of them. I especially like the images that accompany the articles. Really gets you immersed into the world of VKTM, though that could probably apply to any other story with artistic depictions.\n\nAnd yup, this is another digital drawing. Freaking beautiful, I know. I gotta say, it's been some time since I drew something for the wiki, orâ€¦ at all, really. I haven't had the chance to doodle and I quite honestly miss spending hours of my time creating pieces like these. I'm glad I can share them to other people, too. \n\nWith that said, though, I'll be returning to my drawing tablet. Peace for now.\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ //For A Better Tomorrow!//\nCheck out my other 'doodles' [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/winkwonk-doodles here.]\n@@ @@\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/=]]",
