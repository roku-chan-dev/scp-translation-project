We are here today regarding the actions taken by Researcher Valentina Gonzalez on 06/20/2023, that were in direct contradiction of Containment Procedures as established for SCP-8887. This action resulted in a breach of the veil of secrecy, and completely interrupted research into the SCP-8887 anomaly.\n\n//Barr looks around at the gathered individuals. SCP-8887-1 is looking down at its shoes - after a second, it is clear that it has fallen asleep.//\n\n**Susanne Barr:** Let's begin with establishing the Containment Procedures that were breached. Supervising Researcher Michael Chan, please explain the anomaly and the reasoning behind your established procedures.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Yes. SCP-8887 is a pocket dimension created by SCP-8887-1, a dangerous reality bender with no known limit to its abilities. I would like to lodge a formal complaint that SCP-8887-1 is in attendance of this disciplinary hearing, especially without any SRAs present.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** Your complaint is noted - Researcher Gonzalez has established to me in advance that there is no latent danger and that SCP-8887-1's presence is necessary for her testimony. In addition, I have been told that they had both surrendered themselves to Foundation custody willingly and without conflict. Is that correct SCP-8887-1?\n\n//SCP-8887-1 is still asleep and does not reply. Researcher Gonzalez slowly nudges SCP-8887-1 into consciousness.//\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Huh? I'm sorry, I'm having a really tough time staying awake today. What was the question?\n\n**Susanne Barr:** I was confirming that you willingly surrendered yourself to Foundation custody.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Oh yeah, Valentina told me that we should just come in willingly and that she'd be able to help me.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** Understood. It is my opinion that her presence here is not a danger at the present moment - Supervising Researcher Chan, please continue.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Are you kidding m-\n\n//Chan pauses to take a breath, and continues.//\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Very well. Research was ongoing into SCP-8887, with the establishment of a research base and exploration of the dimension. Restrictions on communicating with SCP-8887-1 were in place to ensure that we would be able to best contain the anomaly, and allow us to better understand the dimension.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Understand it? You were destroying it! You didn't care about what was there at all! We had to hide from you!\n\n**Susanne Barr:** SCP-8887-1, please keep any future comments to yourself, you will have time later to give testimony. Supervising Researcher Chan, is it correct that you were 'destroying the dimension'?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** No. We were simply doing our best to establish containment facilities to identify and locate SCP-8887-1.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** So the whereabouts of SCP-8887-1 were unknown?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Yes, that is correct.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** Right. So I have your memo dated 06/16/2023 where you outlined newly established containment procedures. Can you help me understand why you felt it necessary to specify that Researcher Valentina Gonzalez not be informed of any developments on the anomaly?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** It was my belief that Researcher Gonzalez had been influenced by SCP-8887-1, and was prioritizing the anomaly's wellbeing over further research and containment. I was concerned that if Gonzalez heard anything, that they would betray the Foundation further and inform SCP-8887-1. And look what happened, Gonzalez found out and did exactly that.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** That actually brings me to my next question - Researcher Gonzalez, the Foundation research team for SCP-8887, including MTF members were unable to identify or locate SCP-8887-1. How were you able to find her?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Honestly, I got lucky. She lived in my apartment building, and I recognized her one time in the hallways, but I didn't realize who she was until later. That was after I had been suspended.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** So to be clear - you had no unique knowledge that would have allowed you to locate SCP-8887-1 better than any other member of the research team?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** The only factor was that initially, we believed that I was the only individual able to access SCP-8887. In reality, it was due to the fact that I lived only a few apartments down from Aura. So no, I had no unique knowledge, it was truly random circumstances that I discovered the anomaly, or identified Aura and approached her.\n\n**Susanne Barr:** Understood. Supervising Researcher Chan, it appears that your limitation on informing Researcher Gonzalez was not motivated based on professional concerns, but rather personal ones. Can you justify why you felt it necessary to single them out?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Gonzalez had a clear relationship with SCP-8887-1 that was no longer unbiased or professional. Given that we were concerned that SCP-8887-1 had the capabilities to cause a ZK-Class End of Reality Scenario, it was my number one priority to ensure that SCP-8887-1 was not informed of any reality-bending abilities; its belief that it could only manipulate SCP-8887 was tantamount to continued containment efforts.\n\nWhen Researcher Gonzalez contacted SCP-8887-1 directly, that constituted an action that could have ended the world. I don't see why we're even having this hearing, it's obvious that the actions taken by Researcher Gonzalez endangered the world, and the only response is full amnesticization and transfer to D-Class duties.\n\n**Tad Trainor:** Hey, jumping in here really quickly, Tad Trainor, HR. Ummm. Yeah, we don't do the whole 'demoted to D-Class' thing anymore.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Thank you, Mr. Trainor. Back to Dr. Chan, however, I have a question I would like you to answer. When Researcher Gonzalez contacted SCP-8887-1, you had to assume that she was informed of her reality-bending abilities; I have here a report by the MTF team you directly tasked with finding and containing SCP-8887-1 and Researcher Gonzalez by any means. However, SCP-8887-1 and Researcher Gonzalez could not be located until they turned themselves in. So I ask you, why didn't the world end? Why aren't we in the midst of a ZK-Class 'End of Reality Scenario'?\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** Oh. Uhh. I'm afr-I don't know.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** That will be all, thank you Dr. Chan. Next I would like to talk to Researcher Gonzalez.\n\n//Supervising Researcher Chan goes to sit down - he glares in the direction of Researcher Gonzalez and SCP-8887-1. Researcher Gonzalez approaches the podium.//\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Researcher Gonzalez, can you explain why we are not in a ZK-Class Scenario?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Right, I had honestly forgotten that you were scared that would happen, Michael. So - I don't know when Chan came up with this idea, but one day he walked in and said that it would happen. I was the only one who had directly seen Aura's reality-warping abilities, and from my understanding, it was clear that her reality-bending was limited to SCP-8887. For example, in our discussions, she had established to me discontent with their life outside of SCP-8887, and her feelings of helplessness and the inability to change anything. To me, it just didn't seem possible that she could bend reality in baseline reality.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** So, in your professional assessment, was there any chance that SCP-8887-1 could have caused a ZK-Class event?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Any chance? Sure. But it was as likely as myself causing the ZK-Class event simply by interacting with SCP-8887. Her ability to end the world was about on par with any Foundation researcher, so I didn't really see that as a danger. Chan never managed to convince me, he was always waffling about his reasoning.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Thank you Researcher Gonzalez. Now it appears to me that a number of the containment procedures were overly restrictive and not established from a scientific basis. Howe-\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** This is outrageous! I was trying to protec-\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** However. This does not change the fact that Researcher Gonzalez acted in opposition of the Foundation's fundamental objective to protect the veil at all costs. Researcher Gonzalez, do you have anything to say for yourself in this regard?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Right. Well... oh! I wasn't employed by the Foundation.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Expand.\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** Yeah. Technically, I wasn't employed by the Foundation at that time. I was acting as a private citizen when I reached out to Aura. I wasn't taking actions that were against the Foundation - sure, you might not have been happy about it, but it was never part of my job. And you never told me not to interact with Aura. \n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Mr. Trainor, can you confirm this?\n\n**Tad Trainor:** Right. Yes, we have in our records that Valentina Gonzalez was fully suspended on the day they contacted SCP-8887-1. HR policy doesn't specify the effects of a suspension, but given that we don't report employment records to any governing bodies, we have no language regarding that specific potential. Given that when an individual is suspended, any protections afforded to them as a Foundation employee are no longer available or recognized, then yes, you could argue that Gonzalez was not an 'employee' at the time of the incident.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Understood. I think we will consider that a technicality and-\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** A technicality? You're going to let her get off on a technicality? This is bullshit! There's no way that she should get away with this! She disrespected me, disobeyed orders, and put the world in danger! She deserves to be punished for her crimes an-\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Cut it out! Valentina didn't do anything wrong, she was just trying to look out for me! And I don't know what you're talking about with this whole destroying the world bullshit, I have narcolepsy, I can barely take care of myself! How could I do anything dangerous, let alone, Zeekay or whatever you're talking about.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Researcher Chan, please do not speak out of turn. And you, SCP-8887-1, I would ask you to calm down and do the same. That does remind me, however, that I haven't heard from you yet.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** You're really going to let an uncontained reali-\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** //Researcher Chan//, what did I just say that was unclear? Speak out again and I will have you moved to a temporary containment cell as we wait for your disciplinary hearing. Now, SCP-8887-1, can you tell me about what happened when Researcher Gonzalez appeared at your door?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Right. So Valentina told me about what I was doing and how Chan was trying to contain me and force me to stay awake, forever. My narcolepsy and other health issues cause me severe pain and suffering as I'm awake - my dreamscape is the only place where I can be at peace. Keeping me from my escape would destroy me. After Valentina told me, I didn't want to believe her. Me? Able to control reality? That sounds insane.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** So you don't have any reality-bending abilities outside of SCP-8887?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** That's my dreamscape, right? Yeah, I can only change reality there. Valentina even did some testing on me, trying to see if I had any... uhhhh... she called it ontokinesis I think? And I couldn't do anything, I didn't even register on her devices.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Researcher Gonzalez, can you expand on that?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I took readings of the stability of base reality both away from and near Aura. I also took readings while she was sleeping and within SCP-8887. There were no deviations, beyond standard fluctuations - she just couldn't affect reality.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** So how did you two escape Foundation search teams?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** I can answer that. From what I've been told, Supervising Researcher Chan ordered MTF teams to exclusively search anomalous enclaves, nexi and dimensions outside of baseline reality.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Your disappearance was not anomalous?\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** We were at the Motel-6.\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Right.\n\n//Suzanne Barr is seen pinching the bridge of her nose and closing her eyes for approximately 3 seconds.//\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** I've made my decision. Despite your argument, Researcher Gonzalez, I feel like your argument of not being an employee is purely a technicality. However, I am reminded of the long history we have as an organization of allowing scientists to get away with far worse things through 'technicalities'. As such, I have determined that while Researcher Gonzalez may have contravened Foundation orders, those orders were neither ethical, nor enforceable, and therefore, you will remain unpunished. In addition, this hearing has further illustrated significant unprofessional and immoral conduct by Supervising Researcher Chan. Not only did you fail to support the Foundation with your work, but your containment procedures would have been fundamentally unethical, and could even be considered a war crime given the cruelness you would be displaying to a human being.\n\n**Supervising Researcher Chan:** War Crimes? Ethics? Why are we talking about ethics when we are talking about an anomaly? It is supposed to be contained, and neutralized - this article was supposed to make my career, demonstrate that I have the knowledge and ability to avert an apocalypse. To show that I can make the hard decisions for the betterment of humanity!\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Researcher Chan, that is //enough//. It appears that you need a reminder - the Foundation today is no longer the Foundation of the past. We consider anomalous individuals as individuals first, anomalies second. You seem to be clinging to something that the Foundation at large has moved beyond the need for. It will be my suggestion that you be stripped of all management credentials and demoted to a basic researcher position if not fully dismissed from employment.\n\n//Researcher Chan staggers backward, going silent and stumbling backward into his seat. He is silent for the remainder of the recording.//\n\n**Suzanne Barr:** Continuing. To you two - Researcher Gonzalez and SCP-88... Aura Roberts. Despite arguments, I believe that it is in the best interest of the Foundation that we consider both of your actions as supporting the Foundation's newest directives and regulations, showing us that if we push for change as a group, we can grow and learn. Researcher Gonzalez especially, you have demonstrated not only empathy towards anomalous individuals, but you also have not betrayed your personal code of ethics for the sake of 'containment'. We are always moving forward - we need more researchers like you who can make sure that we are trying to give human anomalies their best lives possible. I am putting you in charge of continued efforts to Research SCP-8887 and authorize the surrender of Ms. Roberts to your custody.\n\n**SCP-8887-1:** Does that mean you'll help me with my narcolepsy?\n\n**Researcher Gonzalez:** It means that I'm going to do my best Dreamy.\n\n[END LOG]\n\nFollowing the disciplinary hearing, Researcher Chan was demoted and removed from the SCP-8887 research project. Researcher Gonzalez was elevated to the position of Supervising Researcher Pro Tempore until containment procedures and documentation were updated for SCP-8887.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[<]]\n[[=]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8887/offset/-1/|The current revision of this document is available.
