No extraneous maintenance is needed except for occasions of routine performance checks. All personnel with a clearance Level 2 or above could apply for using SCP-CN-1357, however, all terminal devices that are ready to connect with SCP-CN-1357 must be thoroughly secure-checked to avoid any potential damage.\n\nIt is prohibited to connect SCP-CN-1357 to the public Internet before its anomalous property has been thoroughly researched.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-1357 is a cubical electronic apparatus with a size similar to a common broadband router, with a silvery-gray metallic case. Presumably, it does not require any external power supply.\n\nWhen an electronic device with a basic computer operating system and web-browsing function is connected to the WAN port on the side of SCP-CN-1357 by a standard net cable, the terminal device (hereafter designated SCP-CN-1357-1) will show that a wired network connection is established. Afterward, Internet can be accessed normally via browsers or other web applications installed on SCP-CN-1357-1. Web pages that are loaded in this way could be interacted with. Further observation shows that the system time of SCP-CN-1357-1 will stop passing, and this was later proven.\n\nIf the system time and date on SCP-CN-1357-1 are intentionally changed, it's still possible to visit the web. However, the actual content of websites will become its previous version at the given time. Tests performed on other web applications indicate that the web access provided by SCP-CN-1357 is a completely mirrored version of the public Internet at the system time set on SCP-CN-1357-A.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Addendum: Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide Addendum\"]]\n**Test 1**\n> **Time:** 04/01/2019 19:23\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** A ██████ laptop.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** Time hadn't been changed manually after the test began.\n> \n> **Result:** No apparent abnormalities. The operator claimed that \"Not feeling any different from surfing online as usual\". The discrepancy in the system time remained to be unnoticed until the operator was reminded about it. Test ended.\n\n**Test 2**\n> **Time:** 04/02/2019 10:07\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** A handheld computer of Field Agent ██████.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 04/02/2019 09:00\n> \n> **Result:** The operator visited an online forum [REDACTED]. A reply previously deleted by Agent ██████ at 09:40 was found under their instruction. The news on the home pages of several popular websites was compared and then confirmed to be different from the real-time version. Test ended.\n\n**Test 3**\n> **Time:** 05/11/2019 23:45\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** An all-in-one PC in the office of Dr. ████████.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 01/01/1990 00:01\n> \n> **Result:** No Internet. Test ended.\n\n**Test 4**\n> **Time:** 05/12/2019 08:44\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** A ████ desktop computer.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 05/12/2009 08:44\n> \n> **Result:** A dialog window for logging on to dial-up internet access (with an empty username and password) popped out and then automatically closed after a few seconds. The operator searched \"united states election\" in a search engine. The search results showed that the president was [REDACTED], instead of the incumbent president.\n> \n> Then the operator visited ████████, a video website founded in 2007, which appeared in its classic layout style in its earliest times. Some videos couldn't be loaded. They proceeded to the ██ Blog site, founded in 2010, and it returned to be a nonexistent address. The operator reset the system time to 05/12/2015, and then refreshed the page to load it successfully. They tried to sign in to a blog account created in 2017, and it said \"Wrong username or password.\" Login failed. Test ended.\n\n**Test 5**\n> **Time:** 02/08/2019 20:30\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** A versatile television in the staff relaxation room.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 02/05/2019 02:00\n> \n> **Result:** The operator visited the [*https://tv.cctv.com official website of China Central Television] and played the full recording of the //2019 Spring Festival Gala//. After the video ended, the operator changed the system time to 02/██/202█ (the lunar New Year's Day of that year). The internet connection broke down. Test ended.\n----\n**Incident CN-1357-a**\n> **Time:** 10/24/2019 16:10\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** Personal computer of [REDACTED].\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 10/24/2019 00:00\n> \n> **Incident Details:** Close to the end of a regular performance check, [REDACTED] opened the \"Network and Sharing Center\" on SCP-CN-1357-1 to turn on its bluetooth, attempting to establish LAN connection with his own PDA. 5 seconds after pairing, SCP-CN-1357-1 started to make noises with a significant temperature rise. After a while, its screen turned black and shut down. The test was forced to stop, and after disconnection SCP-CN-1357-1 was rebooted. Following investigation suggested the cause to be hidden malware within the terminal. After being cleaned up and repaired by technicians, this device was forbidden from future interactions and tests with SCP-CN-1357. Fortunately, SCP-CN-1357 did not appear to be damaged.\n----\n**Test 6**\n> **Time:** 10/31/2019 11:19\n> \n> **Terminal for Test:** A workstation of ███████.\n> \n> **System Time Set to:** 09/29/2018 21:00\n> \n> **Result:** This test was proposed by Chen ██, the captain of MTF-[REDACTED]. An instant message application [REDACTED] was downloaded to SCP-CN-1357-1, and Chen's account, deactivated in March 2019, was successfully logged in using the username and password provided by him beforehand.\n\n[[include component:coltop show=Below are the most recent chat logs recorded before he deactivated his account.|hide=Below are the most recent chat logs recorded before he deactivated his account.]]\n> Li █ and Chen ██ are presumably collateral relatives[[footnote]]Cousins.[[/footnote]].\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n+++ Li █\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]hello[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n=  **<Set system time to Today 21:10>**\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]yes?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Whats up[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]will u be back by the national day?[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Nope[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]Too much work to do.

The operator tried to reset the system time to earlier than 00:00, but the application reported an error and refused any further login. Attempts to reinstall the app and repeat the test procedure had failed. The log documented above thus became the only remaining information on this account. Test ended.\n\n> Additional note: Chen ██ was KIA during an assault mission on ████████ reality bending ████ in March 2019.\n[[include component:colend]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-CN-1356]]] | SCP-CN-1357 | [[[SCP-CN-1358]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
