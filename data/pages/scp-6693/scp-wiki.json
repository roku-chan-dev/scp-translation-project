The entity, having arrived without warning in the central staff parking lot via a rideshare service, agreed to be placed within an Alsatian thaumaturgic circle in order to speak with containment staff.\n> -----\n> = **<BEGIN LOG>** \n> \n> **THOMAS:** Sorry to keep you waiting. My name is Yolanda, I'm the Assistant Director of Containment Operations at Site-88. Welcome to our humble facility. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Humble it may be, but a shining beacon on a hill will always betray the darkness for the light of home. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** Right. Well, I have to say, when reception told me someone just dropped off a demon, I was not expecting literal fire-and-brimstone. You're not here to drag me downstairs just yet, I hope. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** //<Scoffs.>// Fire-and-brimstone? Your close-mindedness is unbecoming. Also, that's a stereotype. These hands have never touched an implement of torture. Leave that to the poker-pushers. I prefer the feel of nice vellum and the burn of a strong rye, you know?\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Sure. So, what brings you in today? You must understand this is an... atypical occurrence. //<Pauses.>// And we're all quite busy. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Please. You think I want to do this any more than I have to? This realm reeks of salted butter and petroleum, and I just took a twenty-seven hour Uber to get here. I'm tired and nauseous. Even all that considered, my services are above you lot. Can't sell what you don't have.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Are you insinuating I don't have a soul? What, by virtue of my employment choices--?\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** I was talking about value. I don't need to do an appraisal of something I know is worthless. But--\n> \n> **THOMAS:** My soul is worthless?\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** //Yes//. I just said that. I don't like repeating myself, we're wasting time! I'm running out of options while Hell is literally on fire as we speak!\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Okay, alright. Calm down. You're going to need to give me more context. I thought Hell had plenty of fire on a good day, up until now.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** //<Wipes brow.>// You're right--apologies. //<Takes a breath.>// I'm usually more professional and... put together than this, but the past few months have been challenging. I stopped wearing a three-piece entirely back in June. Couldn't afford the dry-cleaning costs. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** And... how can we help, exactly?\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Well... //<Looking around.>// It's a nice place you've got here. This chair is pretty luxurious. I hear all sorts of good things about the quality of Foundation infrastructure. Worlds better than that facility in Yuma--\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Er-\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Arizona.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Right. Uh-\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Look, I'll be honest with you. Things aren't pretty on the other side right now. Haven't been for a while. Still, no sane being would choose Arizona when we have ferries and the [[[scp-7005|Lampeter]]] as options. That's the thing, though. Desperation. I'm not exactly here on a temporary visa, if you know what I mean. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** Sorry, I'm not following. Are you saying Hell is in Mexico? \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** //<Pauses.>// What? Hell is in //Hell//. You should know that Mexico is a completely separate location. Sheesh. //Anyway//. My flatmate and I couldn't make rent. He decided to move back in with his parents. I've tried the same before and it's like 'I'm living in Hell, but that's //living in Hell//.', right? Ah, besides, they got out before things went really bad. I didn't have much of a choice. Still, I think this place will do just fine. I am a creature of compromise, and I bet you guys have working plumbing and everything. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** You must be confused. This is a containment facility. With two active onsite nuclear reactors. Not the Marriott. It's more like a jail with complimentary tumors.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** No, I know. And I know how this sounds, but hear me out--I'm offering to make you a deal. It's quite the bargain, too. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** Why? How? You can't be permanently contained. If my understanding is correct, our wards are only as effective as people believe they are, which is not as much as I'd like. Even the circle would break down if you fought against it, over time. These methods are not the chains they used to be. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** True. But I'm not fighting your chains, I'm asking for them. Willing to sign for them, even. There's no place for someone like me over there, not without the value of souls. One of the many consequences of your organization's existence is the death of faith, as you may be aware. Thus, I do believe we could mutually benefit from this situation.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Hold on, are you saying what I think you're saying? Foundation intervention has led to an influx of souls in Hell, which has caused them to lose their value via overpopulation? \n> \n> //<SCP-6693 laughs for several seconds.>//\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Oh, you're not joking, of course you aren't. That's on me. No. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** No, Hell is a ghost town compared to its heyday. Everyone jumped ship for greener pastures, once they learned such things exist. Psychopomps began running folk both ways, doing double the work to meet the demand. Slowed down the whole system, of course. Then, the Lampeter connection appeared downtown and made all of that obsolete. Ferrymen went from overworked to out of work overnight. The ones that remained had to upsell their services, and the damned only ever get one coin when they die, so you can imagine how well that played out.  \n> \n> //<The office door opens, and an intern enters with a tray of various beverages.

My business is one of soul commerce, after all, and I'm //not// going back into retail.

You guys have cryptocurrency here, right? That was us, sorry. Well, we didn't gift you the technology, but we should've known you'd 'adopt' it, anyway. This is more like... xenocryptocurrency, to you. Artificial Pneuma, stored via hash strings on the blockchain. //<Snorts.>// Counterfeit souls--Wait, I just remembered, don't you guys call them thetans, nowadays?\n> \n> **THOMAS:** //No//, we expressly do not. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Huh. Must've been some other scientists I was thinking of, maybe?\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Still incorrect. Just use literally anything else.\n>  \n> **SCP-6693:** Well, they called it PneumaCoin, can't be much better. It takes the truly airheaded to manufacture that which fills a nonexistent vessel. Not long before Hell was approaching end-stage Capitalism, and, even worse, we were catching up to you guys faster than ever. Insult to injury, but I digress.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** So, how did you end up in Arizona?\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Ah. Right. So, there's a portal between Arizona and Hell under a portion of the US-Mexico border wall, don't ask me why. It leads from a tar pit to a patch of non-arable land along the edge of Yuma. If you don't pay attention, you could almost miss it--except for that smell. Butter and petrol. Unmistakable. It was an open secret where I lived, but no one in their right mind would leave the safety of Hell for the gun violence center of the multiverse.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** I'm sure that's an exaggeration.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** You'd be surprised, as was I when I learned that the nearest Foundation site I could approach was halfway across the damn country.\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Why would //we// be your closest option?\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** You have a public-facing front company with an address that shows up on a GPS, rather rare for you guys, plus there's state-of-the-art humanoid containment specialization, minimal defenses, and, of course, not a single blessing along the perimeter since it first opened. Site-88 is perfect. It even has an on-campus crossroads, should I need one. Unfortunately, the travel ban included crossroads networks, necessitating my extensive pilgrimage from Arizona. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** Interesting. You seem well-informed, you know. \n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Information flows easily when you can offer things people sell their souls for. Some would understandably skirt policy to [[[scp-7700 | skirt death]]] when learning Hell exists. Far be it from me to correct them on their notion that the outcome of death is a binary one or that Hell wouldn't at least be a step up for them. \n> \n> **THOMAS:** If this is a step down, why not flee the country yourself? I know South America is lovely this time of year.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** I made the mistake of trying to get out once in, believe me. Your country has a… strangely archaic policy for asylum-seekers.\n> \n> //<Agent Thomas' phone buzzes on the table briefly. She flips it over and studies the screen.>//\n> \n> **THOMAS:** //<Clears throat.>// Okay. I think I get the picture, for the most part. I have more questions, but they will have to wait. I will say, this is highly unusual. However, I see no reason to believe we can't accommodate you, as long as you don't pull anything funny.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** //<Claps hands together joyfully.>// Excellent news. You have no idea how much that eases my mind. I will get out of your hair and grab my things. Expect me back this evening so we can hammer out the fine print. There's that sidewalk junction between the reactors out back, the crossroads. Meet me there at three hours past midnight. Bring these items. Come alone.\n> \n> //<SCP-6693 retrieves a small parchment from under the table, sliding it across to Agent Thomas.>//\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Al-Alright. I will see you then.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** I'm looking forward to working with you. I think you will find I'm very reasonable. \n> \n> //<SCP-6693 promptly stands, pouring the remainder of its beverage onto the floor, breaking the protective circle and stepping out of the incomplete perimeter.

It doesn't represent the level of societal or technological progress shared by the rest of the country.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** I know. It's kind of sad, if you think about it. Should we get this show on the road? Or should we wait for the jousting to commence? Grab a flagon of Pepsi and a grilled cheese?\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Okay, now I know you're just being a dick. Also, they don't serve grilled cheese.\n> \n> **SCP-6693:** Why have tomato bisque but no grilled cheese?

Anyway, did you bring me what I asked for?\n> \n> **THOMAS:** Yes, though I am rather disconcerted by your request.
