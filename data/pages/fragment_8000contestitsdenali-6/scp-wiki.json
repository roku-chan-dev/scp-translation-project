Overwatch Command is contacted and appraised of the situation.\n\n##firebrick|**{{[13:47:]}}**## Shortly after the contingency protocols are activated, //Volos// crew discover all five members of Sigma-0 unconscious on the deck of the ship.

Two, you have the room.\n\n**O5-2:** Thank you, One. I trust everyone has had a chance to look over their briefing materials?\n\n**O5-3:** Of Ten's little get-away behind the Council's back, yes.\n\n**O5-6:** Mind yourself, Three.\n\n**O5-9:** Oh, as if Two wasn't complicit in this. Don't act as though she didn't help Ten run off to convene with and become a //god// without even informing the Council, never mind obtaining approval.\n\n**O5-2:** These were excepting circumstances. You heard what Sorenson said in the dream. He was at the end of his power, and if Ten hadn't answered his summons, there likely wouldn't still be a reality in which we can argue about it.\n\n**O5-8:** Be that as it may, it was extremely unwise for her to proceed with such minimal backup and only one measly taskforce.\n\n**O5-2:** Sigma-0 put their li--\n\n**O5-1:** (//Interjecting.//) Settle down, all of you! Bickering amongst each other will not change what has already happened. We are here to discuss what happens next.\n\n(//The video call is silent for a moment.//)\n\n**O5-3:** Twelve, has there been any word from Pataphysics?\n\n**O5-12:** Well, the entire Department has been turned on its head for the last week, but the numbers are mostly within the ranges they should be.\n\n**O5-6:** Mostly?\n\n**O5-12:** There are slightly elevated levels of... how did they put it... //narrative plasticity//.\n\n**O5-7:** Meaning what? Humanity isn't going to turn into a race of Type-Greens or something, I hope.\n\n**O5-2:** No, this is different. Reality bending is its own category, pataphysics is more... fundamental. With reality bending, you get to decide every detail of how you get from Point A to Point B. Pataphysics on the other hand is deciding where Point A, or B, or even //C// is, or whether you even have to go there at all.\n\n**O5-8:** Which would mean that Ten has likely manually expanded humanity's free will. But still, between the changes we've observed and with the Halcyon's power divided eight-billionfold, the impact on normalcy shouldn't be detectable. You wouldn't be able to tell something had changed unless you explicitly knew what to look for.\n\n**O5-12:** Precisely. Moreover, the Pataphysics Department ran the numbers on a series of hypothetical scenarios a while back, narrative plasticity increases among them. (//She displays a data file in the video call.//) Current numbers considered, this would manifest as a greater freedom regarding which paths a person pursues throughout their life. Individuals with a particularly strong force of will should be able to break more easily from the mold, so to speak, and acquire a more active role in determining the course of their lives.\n\n**O5-4:** But why would Tenâ€” rather, should we even call her that anymore? Why would Altasha hand over the keys to the kingdom, so to speak?\n\n**O5-5:** I wouldn't say she's gone that far. If that was her intent, she would have just abdicated the Throne entirely. She likely plans to continue directing the general course of history while still allowing individual human will to flourish. According to the numbers, though, that freedom of will is likely greater than any permitted by any of the heritors throughout history. She's beyond our reach now, regardless. We can only hope that she chooses a prosperous path for humankind.\n\n**O5-1:** And do you trust her judgement?\n\n**O5-2:** God did. That's good enough for me.\n\n**O5-11:** But what does that mean for us? Our duty is to maintain normalcy and contain the anomalous. We've had our share of Archon anomalies before, but are we supposed to just not act in the face of something like this?\n\n**O5-2:** That's exactly what we do.\n\n**O5-6:** Should we catalogue this all away under Archon then?\n\n**O5-2:** I considered it, but ultimately, SCP-8018 is fundamentally different. While something like an Archon can just sit there and not be a threat as long as we don't interfere, it's still an anomaly, a blemish on normalcy in one way or another. However, 8018 is intimately, innately a part of our reality. You remember what Sorenson said in the dream. The Halcyon's fantasies were not bendings or alterations of reality, they were reality. I won't say that SCP-8018 is non-anomalous, but it is essentially the next closest thing.\n\n**O5-8:** That is a reasonable enough distinction, I suppose. I wager you'll have quite a time trying to convince the Classification Committee of this when we're done here, though.\n\n**O5-2:** I already took the liberty of consulting the Committee earlier this week. After some deliberation, they have created just such a designation. (//She displays a memo from the Classification Committee in the call.//) Object Class: //Halcyon//.\n\n**O5-4:** (//Mutters.//) Subtle.\n\n**O5-1:** Not to mention jumping the gun a bit. You assume the Council will even decide to move forward with a plan like this that doesn't involve containment.\n\n**O5-2:** Can we even contain something like SCP-8018 and Altasha though? If it is as Sorenson said, then that would be like a fish trying to get rid of the ocean.\n\n**O5-12:** To even try would be the height of folly.\n\n**O5-4:** Agreed. Under these terms listed, SCP-8018 is \"considered exempt from Foundation containment initiatives,\" among several other things. The Classification Committee was thorough, I'll give them that.\n\n**O5-1:** I propose a vote. The designation of SCP-8018 as a Halcyon-class anomaly and the observation of all procedures contained therein. All in favor?\n\n**O5-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -10, -12:** Aye.\n\n**O5-1:** All oppose?\n\n**O5-3, -6, -7, -9, -11:** Nay.\n\n**O5-1:** Thirteen abstains. The measure passes.\n\n(//A grumble goes up from the dissenters, but quickly fades.//)\n\n**O5-1:** All information regarding SCP-8018 is to be dispensed on a strictly need-to-know basis. Are we clear? She might be on our side, but we don't need word about something like this getting out.\n\n(//A murmur of affirmation passes around the video call. O5-1 sighs.//)\n\n**O5-1:** I know it's been a busy week for everyone, so thank you for your time. I will close with this: god is on our side now. For our sakes, that's one less deity for us to have to worry about. Now go get some rest, all of you.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n----\n++++ __Addendum 8018.3__\n+++++ **Classification Committee Report**\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nIn light of the unique properties surrounding SCP-8018, the Classification Committee has designated a new item class to be applied to the anomaly to more aptly communicate its nature for the purposes of documentation, containment, and recordkeeping.\n\n[[div class=\"classification_memo\"]]\n\n= __Update to the SCP Foundation Classification Committee Guide to Esoteric Containment Classes__\n= - Revision #27, 2024 -\n\nHalcyon-class denotes an item or phenomenon that is to be considered exempt from Foundation containment initiatives due to said anomaly constituting a critical part of overall normalcy and/or baseline reality.

No further containment measures are considered necessary.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8018 denotes the pataphysical concept comprising the narrative structure of reality. This concept is maintained by SCP-8018-1, a complex eigenconstruct referred to as in historical records as \"The Glittering City.\" Access to this construct was permanently lost following Incident 8018-Alpha.\n\n**History:** SCP-8018 was originally created by an apex-tier pluripotent entity referred to in historical attestations as \"the Halcyon\" sometime approximately 4.5 billion years ago. Due to the circumstances of this creation, the narrative reality of Earth and its surroundings[[footnote]]The exact extent of which remains unclear, though largely unimportant.[[/footnote]] developed as a part of this entity's own established narrative, leading to global events following its will up until its death approximately 800,000 years ago.\n\nThe entity is thought to have been discovered by members of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1000 SCP-1000] a relatively short time before its demise, and constructed SCP-8018-1 alongside other anthrospecies[[footnote]]Refer to the Dr. Cindry's //__Of Hair and Ash: A History of Anomalous Human-Adjacent Species__// for more information.[[/footnote]] as a means of sustaining the narrative which would otherwise collapse without its creator.\n\nDue to the nature of SCP-8018-1 and its interaction with SCP-8018, a viable individual was required to preside over the former and facilitate its functions. This position was inherited by several members of different anthrospecies, including humans, throughout SCP-8018-1's history.\n\n**Incident 8018-Alpha:** On 10/2/2024, the base functionality of SCP-8018 was altered and the bearer of SCP-8018 became transferred to Overseer Councilwoman O5-10, Altasha Ilgovich from its previous inheritor, Gregory Sorenson. This transfer was facilitated by O5-10 following her arrival on the island containing SCP-8018-1 , and by extension SCP-8018 itself.\n\nThe exact consequences, outcomes, and implications of this transfer remain unclear; however, data points collected from various Foundation divisions, including the Onierics, Thaumatology, and Pataphysics Departments indicate no signs of any ill effects on the physical or conceptual structure of reality. While no hazardous phenomena have yet manifested as a result of this transfer, this event coincided with a massive spike in vivid and lucid dreaming worldwide.\n\nGlobal pataphysical and narrative conditions are being monitored for significant changes at this time.\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"memoblink\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Notice: (1) File Has Been Appended To This Document\" hide=\" - Displaying File -\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\nWhen I met Gregory Sorenson in 1923, over a century ago now, I hated him at first. He touted his prowess with the esoteric arts, his cunning skills of intelligence gathering, all with the pompous flare of someone who acted like they knew everything. To his credit, Gregory very nearly did.\n\nHis time working alongside the Foundation changed that. The more Gregory began to witness the complexities of the anomalous world, the more he began to consider others. It humbled him. From the gruesome rites of the Sarkic cults, to the voracious appetite of Mekhane, and more, each encounter gradually shaped him.\n\nBut Gregory was ultimately just another servant to the tide of life and fate, like the rest of us. He was aware of it, of course. As arrogant as he could be at times, people as smart as him always eventually come to notice such philosophical elephants in the room. Yet it was that selfsame arrogance that would change everything.\n\nWe still aren't completely certain who orchestrated the attack on Altasha and two of the other Overseers during the time, but Gregory divined it in a dream the day before it was set to begin. He saw her lying there on the floor of the meeting hall, drowned in her own blood beside the bullet hole-ridden corpses of her fellow Overseers. He had seen it, this vision of the future, a fate set in stone. So Gregory did the unthinkable: he fought it. What could be more arrogant than thinking you knew better than destiny?\n\nAnd yet that is exactly what he did. He warned us, blew the whistle, even physically intervened. Many people have taken a bullet for Altasha, and Gregory had become no exception. It was the //reason// behind his act that fascinated us most of all. He acted not just to save her, but to challenge our story itself. And there they both stood, alive, with fate broken at their feet. They grew close after that. Together, the two of them were unstoppable.\n\nThen one day, he was gone. We had no idea what had happened to him at the time of course. Little did we know he'd been summoned to the ends of the Earth to bear the weight of godhood. We lamented. Altasha mourned. And then we moved on. But that whole time, he was out there, turning the wheel of the sky as we danced and dreamed beneath it. All the while, preparing the way for the next step of in humanity's grand tale.\n\nAltasha came to me that night, when she ascended. She comforted me, explained to me what she had to do, and apologized for not being able to continue our story alongside one another. Altasha spoke of a beautiful world, an age of prosperity where the shores of mankind rise up against darkening waves of horrors beyond imagining. A world where no one dies in the dark, and all thrive in the light.\n\nSo whether you're a fellow Councilmember looking to refresh yourself on this immutable truth of our grand story, or a clever researcher who managed to bypass the security measures in place on this document, I will leave you with this:\n\nWe live in a new world now. Yes, a world that may be just a fantasy, but why should that be cause for remorse? For anything less than utter jubilation? Our future is sustained, our victory assured, the ending already written. God watches over, and she is on our side.\n\nThis is //our// fantasy now. Realize this, and rejoice.\n\n//-- Lilia, O5-2//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
