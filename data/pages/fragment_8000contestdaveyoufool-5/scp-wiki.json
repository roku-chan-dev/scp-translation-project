[[/footnote]], bagpipes, concertina, clay recorders, eunuchs trained to bark like dogs, a church bell, two mating goats\n\n------\n\n//(Her Majesty sits in the middle of an empty field, curled over as a living corpse in twisted agony. Mankind assembles around her, dancing slowly in a solemn procession.)//\n\n**MANKIND**\nO Shepherdess, wherefore your tears so stain\nthe sterile soil with your innocence?\nA steady hand and unforgiving calm\nbefits the herdsman's crook that spurs us forth.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nMy children, pay no mind to my distress;\nit's nothing to your lot when thus compared.\nThe crook you speak of isn't mine to bear,\nand he who seeks my leadership as such\nis led astray to pastures blasphemous.\nTo answer you: I weep for humankind,\nsuch bondsmen as yourself to fourfold lash.\nI hate myself, for I am powerless\nto free you from the agony I swore\nto hide behind a hundred thousand doors --\nto die in darkness, that you live in light.\nThe darkest darkness triumphs evermore.\nNo vault is large enough to dam the flood,\nto stow you far from cataclysm's grasp.\n\n**MANKIND**\nWe wish we'd die to stump back one more tear\nto ne'er escape your blameless eyes again --\nO, this, and this alone, would us console!\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nYour selflessness outshines the golden Sun,\nfor that, too, warms us to no recompense.\nBut soft, your masters come to fetch their prey!\n\n//(Enter the Four Tyrants to clamorous song. Mankind cowers before them.)//\n\n**TYRANTS**\nThe life you lead is inescapable!\nThere's but a single trough to feed you all,\nwhich we refer to as a chamberpot.\nYou'll eat of it, for there is nothing else.\n\n**TYRANT OF VANITIES**\nThe Tyrant of the Vanities am I,\nthe lord of every empty, fleeting thrill.\nI've silly games and bright, convenient toys\nto drive the fattened beast to shrieking bliss.\nAnd so, when good Sir Butcher comes to call,\nyou'll lie and say you're anything but meat.\nBut one without the other can't exist --\nso, death, or drudgery? The choice is yours.\n\n**TYRANT OF FEAR**\nThe kingdom of my Tyranny is Fear,\nthe omnipresent blade upon your neck.\nWith fingers lean and wide-apart to sift,\nI hold your safety in my careless grasp.\nI cannot be ignored on pain of death.\nYou'll act upon my every childish whim,\nfor I'm the charlatan of promises\nthat dangle at the other end of hope.\n\n**TYRANT OF SHAME**\nI am the Tyrant Lord of Shame and Guilt,\nwho ever will peruse your base receipt.\nHistorian and slaver both am I,\nthe witness of your heart's iniquity.\nNo soul is pure, in this world or the next,\nand therefore, if you ever try to change\nthis nightmare you've created for yourselves,\nremember that you aren't qualified.\n\n**TYRANT OF DEATH**\nI AM THE TYRANT OF DEATH! \nI'LL FUCKING KILL YOU!\nIAMBIC PENTAMETER IS FOR LOSERS!\n//DIE!//\n\n**MANKIND**\nFor ages have they been our overlords.\nO, Shepherdess, your knights have ever worked\nforestalling ev'ry dark invading host\nand giving limit to catastrophe.\nAnd yet, alas, the four remaining lords\nremained immortal while the others fell,\nand nothing can be done by Man or God\nto stop them, for their evils are our own\nand we created them in our disgrace!\n\n**FOUR TYRANTS**\nWe are your castigation given flesh!\n\n//(The Tyrants disrobe, cavorting amidst the chorus with abandon. [Note to players: Pan-settlement laws against murder and injury may be waived if committing said crimes is productive for purposes of cavorting.])//\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nThough reason firmly pleads me to concede\nyour suffering beyond salvation's grasp,\nmy heart is breaking open as I bear\ntrue witness to your miserable fate.\nMy foolish desperation's chains I loose,\nfor once again, I seek to end this pain,\nignoring all impossibility!\nNow, let my voice reach stars beyond the stars,\nto cosmic voids behind the head of God,\nbeyond what can be conceptualized!\nWill no one intercede for humankind?\nO, someone -- something -- //anything// -- I charge\nyou answer, break your silence, and appear!\n\n//(Enter the Great Bøyg and his train of knights. The Tyrants back away, hissing.)//\n\n**FOUR TYRANTS**\nO, horror! Holy light confounds our souls!\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nAre you the answer to my anxious prayer?\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nI want a gift.\n\n//(He draws a knife and severs one of Her Majesty's fingers and swallows it whole. [Note to players: please rehearse this part carefully. There have been incidents of death from blood loss and/or choking on the finger interrupting otherwise seamless productions.])//\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nReceive my offering, O Noble One!\nAnd in exchange, what is your Lordship's name?\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nMyself.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nYou know yourself? I cannot say the same.\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nYou are to be the queen of this world.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nNot I, my liege! I'm of Foundation stock,\na herder of the flock unspeakable.\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nBe quiet.\n\n//(The Bøyg points to the Four Tyrants. The Tyrants fall down one by one.)//\n\n**TYRANT OF VANITIES**\nWhat heresy! Without me, they are lost.\nTheir lives will be worth living nevermore.\n\n**TYRANT OF FEAR**\nO, how I die! Without my guiding hand,\nthey'll wander blindly into cleansing flame.\n\n**TYRANT OF SHAME**\nMy strength, it leaves me! But without my help,\nthe saints will all descend to wickedness.\n\n**TYRANT OF DEATH**\nI'M A UNIVERSAL CONSTANT AND CAN'T DIE,\nBUT NOW I'M NO LONGER EVIL ROYALTY.\nWELL, SHIT!\n\n//(Exit the Four Tyrants.)//\n\n**MANKIND**\nWith tempered joy and wary sigh, we cheer,\nfor every miracle must have a price.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nI thank you, mighty stranger from beyond.\nAs newfound queen, I've all my realm to give,\nso what, praytell, expect you for this boon?\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nYour humanity.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nForgive me, but I do not understand.\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nA human cannot lead.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\nBut you appointed me a human queen!\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nYou will be corrected.\n\n//(The knights pounce on Her Majesty. She is disrobed and laid out on the ground. From a silver ewer, a mixture of honey and olive oil is poured over her body. A shallow grave is dug close nearby. She is taken to the grave and buried neck-deep in dried and flattened mouse carcasses. The knights sing the first 50 verses of the Hymn to the Great Bøyg as they take turns throwing pine cones at her exposed head. Once the song is over, she is pulled out of the pit with gilded chains and made to swallow whole a large figurine of a chicken's egg made of ash-wood.)//\n\n**THE GREAT BØYG**\nThe Occultation has begun. \nEverything that ever happened before this moment is cast into the void, never to return.\nHistory is dead, and Myth dances on its grave.\n\n**MANKIND**\nSo be it. \nSo be it. \nSo be it.\n\n**HER MAJESTY**\n...a Troll-Queen am I.\n\n//(Exeunt.)//\n\n------\n\n...\n\nYou're a nice guy, Hammie. You made it through most of this adventure without grousing.\n\nBut damn it all, you were promised that this play would be about hamburgers!\n\n++++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8005/act5.html Let's be honest: you've got every right to complain to someone about it...]",
