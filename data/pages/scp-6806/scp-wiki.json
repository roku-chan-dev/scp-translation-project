SCP-6806 is visible right of center.\n| align=center\n| width=100%]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Site-58 as a whole is considered the active containment zone of SCP-6806, although it primarily manifests within the Site-58 break room. All personnel stationed at Site-58 are to record SCP-6806 manifestations whenever they occur; any observed deviations from standard behavior are to be reported immediately. In the event of a containment breach, the compromised location is to be considered an extension of Site-58 and treated accordingly.\n\nOne or more episodes of the //Spongebob Squarepants// television show are to be screened in the Site-58 break room for the viewing of at least three individuals on a weekly basis. These individuals are to be considered the SCP-6806 containment committee, and rotated out monthly. They are to remain under surveillance during their weekly screenings.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6806 is an entity which inhabits live video footage recorded within and nearby Site-58[[footnote]] A Foundation secure site located on the Pacific seafloor.[[/footnote]]. It primarily appears in security camera feeds, although it has also inhabited videos recorded by mobile phones and body cameras on occasion. SCP-6806 bears significant visual similarities to the title character from the televised cartoon program //Spongebob Squarepants;// the exact reason for this resemblance is unknown.\n\nSCP-6806 manifests in video footage at irregular intervals. When active, it behaves as if it is physically present in the location being recorded, avoiding obstacles as appropriate. As such, alterations of the environment such as the sealing of all exits will temporarily arrest its movement. However, it has shown an ability to transport itself between live video feeds in order to escape locked containment cells.\n\nFootage inhabited by SCP-6806 will display a number of abnormal alterations to the environment being recorded. These alterations commonly include:\n* Presence of auditory phenomena commonly noted in marine environments such as seabird calls, bubbling, and liquid splashing and trickling.\n* Appearance of acorn barnacles //(Semibalanus balanoides)//, stalked kelp //(Pterygophora californica)//, and California mussels //(Mytilus californianus)// on exposed surfaces.\n* A layer of water at the lowest visible elevation in the environment.\n* Distant laughter similar to that of the character Spongebob Squarepants.\n\n--These alterations only appear in footage and are not present in reality.-- //Debated; see Addendum 02.//\n\nAlthough extensive testing has not been authorized due to security concerns, the ability of SCP-6806 to transport itself between camera feeds does not appear to be limited by distance. Additionally, on two occasions, it has manifested in the camera feeds of oceanic vessels outside the bounds of Site-58. Due to this, SCP-6806 poses a high theoretical risk to secrecy should it appear outside Foundation custody.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that SCP-6806 displays a preference towards occupying camera feeds which depict certain individuals. When interrogated, these individuals consistently claim either to have recently watched an episode of the //Spongebob Squarepants// program or to express an overall interest in the program. This behavior may be exploited in order to confine SCP-6806 to a certain location — namely, Site-58.\n\nIt is not known if SCP-6806 is sapient, or if it is aware of events outside its immediate vicinity. Attempts to communicate with SCP-6806 have failed. The entity does not interact with personnel or objects in any way, save for avoiding them if they are blocking its path.\n\n--To date, SCP-6806 has not displayed signs of hostility.-- //Debated; see Addendum 02.//\n\n**Addendum 01:** On 03/01/2020, Researchers Adam Smith, George Kinley and Mark Vanderbilt were assigned to the SCP-6806 containment committee. They attended the weekly screening of //Spongebob Squarepants// episodes as requested, and their activities during this time were recorded by security cameras in the Site-58 break room, as is standard for SCP-6806 containment protocols.\n\nThe content of these recordings is relevant to an ongoing investigation -- as such, they have been transcribed and attached below.\n\n> **Subjects:** Researchers Adam Smith, George Kinley and Mark Vanderbilt\n> \n> **Time:** 20:41\n> \n> **Episode:** Help Wanted\n> \n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> ------\n> \n> //(Both Smith and Kinley are seen sitting on a couch within the Site-58 break room.

During this time, all attempts at communication with the Site from outside failed, and all exits and entrances were inoperable.\n\nAfter one hour, all power systems spontaneously reactivated. During subsequent interviews, Site-58 personnel described losing consciousness at the exact moment of the power failure and reawakening afterwards, with no recollection of the intervening events. Furthermore, during a full canvas of the site, Researchers Smith, Kinley and Vanderbilt were found to no longer be present in their living quarters. Their location and status remain unknown.\n\nFootage of the event could not initially be obtained, as security cameras site-wide were severely water-damaged for unknown reasons. However, database inspection discovered several fragments of coherent security footage that had apparently been saved and logged during Incident 6806-PARICIA. This footage is the only source of information as to what occurred during Incident 6806-PARICIA; it has been transcribed and compiled into an assumed timeline of events below.\n\n------\n\n[[=]]\n++++ **[BEGIN VIDEO TRANSCRIPTS]**\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n||**Break Room Camera**||\n[[/=]]\n \n//(20-second clip.
