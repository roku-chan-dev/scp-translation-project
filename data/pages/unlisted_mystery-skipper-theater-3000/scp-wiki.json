I'm not sure how long I've been up here but don't worry -- at no point has it gotten any less tedious.\n\n**GENERAL BEEP:** It almost makes you want to see what the Kon has in store for us next.\n\n**NAVARRO:** Yeah, almost... but not quite.\n\n**ROBO-DUDE:** INCOMING TRANSMISSION! SITE-19 DOCTOR KONDRAKI! I AM MAKING AN ANNOUNCEMENT! \n\n**NAVARRO:** Whelp, speak of the devil, I suppose...\n\n[ A screen appears, upon which DR. KONDRAKI'S face is displayed.

How's the weather up there?\n\n**NAVARRO:** Same as yesterday... a nice hot slice of nothing.\n\n**KONDRAKI:** Well, I've got something for you today that might liven things up a bit. Are you ready? It's a doozy, this one...\n\n**NAVARRO:** Yes. I am so excited. Please. Give it to me. Send your SCP signal into my Satellite of Love.\n\n**KONDRAKI:** You're feeling snippy now, but you'll be lucky to have any feelings left after watching... //[[[scp-foundation-the-movie| SCP Foundation: The Movie!]]]//\n\n**NAVARRO, BOTS:** OH NO!

Comparing the directing to drunken, headless chickens stapled together to act as a steadycam operator was completely over the top. I also did not appreciate the repeated comparing and contrasting of my cinematic skills to other scientists with my name. I demand that this be expunged from the record!\n\n> Lighten up, Edison.
