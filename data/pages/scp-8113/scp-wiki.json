Instances in earlier stages may be contained in cryogenic stasis upon request. Cells may contain up to 4 Stage 1 instances or 2 Stage 2 instances.\n\nStage 1 and 2 SCP-8113-1 instances may request items for personal use to be placed within their containment chamber. All requests must be approved by Bio Site-37 Director and SCP-8113 Research Lead Dr. Kaivalya Veritas. Instances may additionally request contact with a psychiatric specialist.\n\nFurther action such as the provision of medication must be withheld.\n\nAny personnel handling SCP-8113 must adhere to Class-4 Biohazard procedures. Personnel with wounds deeper than their epidermis may not make contact with any surface that has been interacted with by an SCP-8113-1 instance for 48 hours. Individuals found breaching these procedures are to be quarantined for another 48 hours - after this time period, they must be medically assessed before returning to previous duties. If during their time in quarantine the individual shows signs of SCP-8113 infection, they are henceforth to be classified as an SCP-8113-1 instance regardless of previous standing in the Foundation. The purposeful infection of D-Class with SCP-8113 for further research purposes must be explicitly approved by a member of the O5 Council.\n\nAs SCP-8113-1 instances cannot be reverted back to their original state, containment of SCP-8113 instead focuses on preventing further spread. In the case of an outbreak, Mobile Task Force Beta-7 \"Maz Hatters\" are to be deployed to the affected location, taking SCP-8113-1 instances into Foundation custody and clearing affected areas of anomalous matter. Following this, deployed Task Force members are to be amnesticized.\n \n**Description:** SCP-8113 is a transmissible symbiont which spreads between humans upon contact of its pollen byproducts with any wound to the dermis or deeper tissue. Hosts of SCP-8113 are designated SCP-8113-1 and exhibit anomalous effects in three stages.\n\nStage 1 occurs immediately upon initial contact and lasts between 3-14 hours depending on the area, depth and location of the site of infection. Speed of progression increases with the host's bodily movement. SCP-8113-1 instances at this stage will not notice any changes. SCP-8113 vines begin to grow beneath the surface of the site of initial contact. In Stage 1 instances, SCP-8113 has an average growth rate of 5cm^^3^^/h, with the maximum rate recorded as 18cm^^3^^/h in SCP-8113-1-██. It follows a similar growth pattern to the nervous system, forming most prominently around large nerve structures. During this stage, SCP-8113-1 instances may still cease life function. In this case, the SCP-8113 matter within the deceased instance will be rendered inert.\n\nThe transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 is considered the point where the vine structure has ceased to actively spread without damage to the SCP-8113-1 instance. At Stage 2, the site of initial contact produces a bud which takes from 1 - 3 days to flower. The inflorescence of SCP-8113 is a compound umbel arrangement, the individual flowers resembling //Lycoris albiflora//[[footnote]]Commonly known as the White Spider Lily.[[/footnote]]. The vines themselves match no known species, possessing anomalously high tensile strength and a fibrous composition. SCP-8113-1 instances at this stage no longer distinguish between standard strength and what is known as 'hysterical' strength, often resulting in self-injury. When an SCP-8113-1 instance experiences injury or other dysfunction within bodily systems, SCP-8113 adapts to ensure the instance's optimum health by spreading vines to the affected area. SCP-8113 draws kinetic and thermal energy from both the body and surroundings as required, converting it for use via anomalous means.\n\nStage 3 is reached when upwards of 50% of the SCP-8113-1 instance's body mass is comprised of SCP-8113. By this stage, the mental state of the SCP-8113-1 instance will have deteriorated. Cryogenic stasis is recommended for instances at this stage to prevent further degradation in both mental and physical condition.\n\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n _\n\nUpon initial discovery, the Site's life support systems were deactivated. Exploration teams were equipped accordingly.\n\nThe Site contains three wings adjoined to a central structure, with all architecture, equipment and resources consistent with that of a Foundation facility. An active access terminal is located two meters from the entrance. Exploration teams noted that it appears to have been re-located from a different region within the Site. Along with the Special Containment Procedures and Description documents, the following information was available.\n\n _\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=basaltcompliant\n|unique-name=lowercase-nospaces\n|display-name=TRANSCRIPTION COMMENCED.\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n**UPDATE: 2001/03/16**\n\nAt 08:03, Agent Alexis Rendira alerted the Foundation that he had become infected with SCP-8113. By this point, Agent Rendira had progressed to Stage 2 and was designated SCP-8113-1-BE. The abrasion it had received during initial contact was determined to be the cause of the infection. It was subsequently transferred to isolation within a Biohazard Humanoid Containment Cell.\n\nInitial psychiatric evaluations by Dr. Stoker lacked notable content. BE appears to be satisfied with updated containment procedures, stating the importance of biohazard protocols. It retains the notion that containment, as stated, \"is not as bad as it could be,\" and cites other Mobile Task Force members' experiences when queried.\n\nFollowing further discovery regarding the nature of the anomaly, remaining members of Mobile Task Force Theta-4 \"Gardeners\" were checked for wounds to their epidermis and released from quarantine.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n**UPDATE: 2002/08/02**\n\nAt 15:02, numerous containment cells within Bio Site-37 were compromised due to a detonation of larger scope than intended during testing. BE's containment cell sustained significant damage, along with BE itself. Due to the nature of SCP-8113, BE's condition remains stable with approximately 16% of its bodily mass comprised of SCP-8113. Its right arm was severely damaged, resulting in almost complete loss of function. Surgery was performed to remove bone fragments in order to minimize pain and enable SCP-8113 to replace the missing tissue.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\n\n**UPDATE: 2008/12/19**\n\nBio Site-37 experienced a major containment breach of 8 Stage 2, now Stage 3 SCP-8113-1 instances. The instances, which had been contained together whilst the Site was expanded to increase capacity, assaulted security personnel when the door to their containment cell was opened. Involved personnel were forced to retreat when engaged in close-quarters combat to mitigate the spread of the anomaly. At this time, BE was outside of its containment cell with Dr. Wilkinson on a scheduled appointment.\n\nAfter approximately 9 minutes, the SCP-8113-1 instances intercepted BE and Dr. Wilkinson. Dr. Wilkinson successfully incapacitated an SCP-8113-1 instance with her handgun, receiving severe injuries in the process. Due to the damage to her dermis and therefore high likelihood of contamination with SCP-8113, Dr. Wilkinson proceeded to self-terminate. BE utilized her weapon to incapacitate 4 more instances and resorted to hand-to-hand combat to immobilize two others. Security personnel arrived soon after, subduing the last SCP-8113-1 instance with no further incident.\n\nContainment procedures have been revised accordingly to mitigate the risks associated with SCP-8113-1 instances acting as a group.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n _\n\nUpon accessing the terminal, a site-wide alert was heard over the integrated PA system. This alert consisted of a male voice repeating the phrase \"Hello and welcome. Please [UNINTELLIGIBLE] take care of yourself, and seal [UNINTELLIGIBLE]. Thank you in advance!\" for 5 minutes. After no further activity was confirmed within the facility, exploration teams proceeded with their mission.\n\n180 outdated cryogenic stasis pods [[footnote]] Construction dated to the year 2000 [[/footnote]] are located within the rightmost wing. 129 of these pods remain active, storing anomalous humanoids within. Almost all power from the on-Site generator is rerouted to sustain these systems. All humanoids contained match descriptions of SCP-8113-1 instances in Stage 3 of progression.\n\nA single humanoid of the same nature is positioned at the control panel for the stasis pods with a stack of printed documents nearby. Automated transcription processes have commenced.\n\n _\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=basaltcompliant\n|unique-name=lowercase-nospaces\n|display-name=[NEW MATERIAL LOCATED, TRANSCRIPTION COMMENCED]\n]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n\nSCP-8113 was originally brought to Foundation attention through local news outlets in 2001.

PROCEDURE BRINY DEPTHS is an AIC-operated screening procedure allowing the potential for undesirable ideation to be identified within personnel and acted on accordingly. It has been proven able to detect the following:\n\n* Belief in extending life over increasing quality of life\n* Belief in or desire to reach any afterlife which involves immortality as a key feature\n* Capability for or existence of strong emotion regarding a relative or friend with a terminal illness\n* Capability for or existence of strong emotion regarding a relative or friend who is recently deceased\n* Desire for immortality / extended life\n* Pro-natalist ideologies\n* Fear of death\n\nIt has been determined that all personnel with knowledge of SCP-8113 and/or Bio Site-37 must have passed PROCEDURE BRINY DEPTHS. If the procedure is not cleared with a positive result of a minimum of 95% alignment rate, personnel are to be amnesticized and removed from the premises. Due to the nature of PROCEDURE BRINY DEPTHS, any personnel who clear may not request amnesticization.\n\nThe following individuals with knowledge of SCP-8113 did not clear the procedure.\n\n||~ Name ||~ Alignment Rate ||\n|| Dr. Māra Gundersen|| 38.8% ||\n|| Dr. Aliisa Sauter || 09.2% ||\n|| Agent Vivian Ward|| 71.7% ||\n|| Researcher Trinity Armine|| 13.9% ||\n|| Junior Researcher Levi Browne|| 43.0% ||\n|| Dr. Gray Stoker || 93.2% ||\n|| Researcher Tonalli Chaudhary || 39.4% ||\n|| Agent Juan Fylan || 57.2% ||\n|| Agent Punita Parri || 10.5% ||\n|| Researcher Ronita Steele || 83.1% ||\n|| Researcher Rodrigo Miyajima || 46.6% ||\n|| Agent Sílvio Ivers || 61.9% ||\n|| Junior Researcher Alojzia Järvinen|| 20.8% ||\n|| Agent Bilal Acharya || 58.1% ||\n|| Agent Rana Mero || 71.3% ||\n|| Agent Caleb Zion || 85.9% ||\n|| Dr. Harmonia Wong || 18.0% ||\n|| Agent Quinn Davis || 09.5% ||\n\nDue to the toll that PROCEDURE BRINY DEPTHS takes on Foundation resources, containment procedures have been updated to include the amnesticization of Mobile Task Force members responsible for handling containment breaches external to Bio Site-37.
