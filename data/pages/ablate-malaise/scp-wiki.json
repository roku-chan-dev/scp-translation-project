Protect MIDSIGHT from contamination stemming in PATIENT CROW suite\n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135011N)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: FID-384100\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: FID-561002, FID-51081, FID-55982, FID-580003, FID-592103\n> __Date__: 04/06/2056\n> \n> **0637** – SEPARCH and BERATE arrive inside security perimeter via unknown means, pinging MIDSIGHT conglomerate on standby. SEPARCH comments on MIDSIGHT awareness (likely via feedback with individuals tied to Foundation empathetic networks). BERATE makes several infohazardous statements. Abrasion zone modified.\n> \n> **0645** – SEPARCH and BERATE approach S03-B10-8180 and buzz for entry. Both admitted after several minutes by personnel inside. MIDSIGHT further tuned to penetrate CIF shielding, reducing clarity to 25%. \n> \n> **0648** – Conversation with personnel refers to pressure on SERUM BLACKBOX operations, noting that its objectives (mentioned in both engineering and medical contexts) are several months from completion. SEPARCH comments on continued MIDSIGHT awareness.\n> \n> **0651** – MIDSIGHT cohesion lost due to an infohazard exceeding acceptable MIR ranges.\n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135130N)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: FID-384100\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: FID-561002, FID-51081, FID-55982, FID-580003\n> __Date__: 05/31/2056\n> \n> **0640** – SEPARCH and BERATE detected at last known entry point. Modifications to underlying MIDSIGHT structure evade detection, SEPARCH comments on absence. BERATE responds, implying current membership in an MTF (likely Nu-76 or Rho-53).\n> \n> **0648** – SEPARCH and BERATE enter B10-8180. Refined MIDSIGHT tuning achieves 55% clarity without alerting targets. Discussion begins with staff on the status of ABLATE MALAISE with frequent references to the collection of \"slurry.\" Discussion ends with reference to a leader or leadership body nulled to MIDSIGHT by severing from all accessible networks (flagged for context analysis). \n> \n> **0706** – BERATE remains in intermediate CIF areas while SEPARCH enters containment area. MIDSIGHT clarity reduced to 15% by interference from ABLATE MALAISE. Excessive strain placed on all Foundation-anchored empathetic networks over this period (see: //KERN BULLETIN-931 (Disruption to Senses of Self and Otherness)//). \n> \n> **0830** – BERATE and SEPARCH exit B10-8180.\n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135145G)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: FID-384100\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: FID-561002, FID-51081, FID-55982, FID-580003\n> __Date__: 08/03/2056\n> \n> **1510 (approx.)** – Long-term interference prevents immediate detection of BERATE and SEPARCH. Emergence has been estimated via past timelines.\n> \n> **1518** – BERATE detected in B10-8180 by passive MIDSIGHT surveillance, SEPARCH has already entered ABLATE MALAISE containment area. Regular spikes of disruption to local empathetic networks coincide with Foundation personnel entering the CIF over the following two hours (28 identified, verified).\n> \n> **1726** – BERATE also enters ABLATE MALAISE containment, coinciding with severe disruption to local network. MIDSIGHT clarity approaches 0%.\n> \n> **1728** – The following message is broadcast across the sublayer-3 QWEX mental construct implanted in all Foundation personnel:\n> \n>> //Extensive psychic noise, filtered as fine tuning begins.//\n>> \n>> [Urgent signal for attention. Stop non-essential work]\n>> \n>> [Sense of approval from higher powers (tuned as \"Overseers,\" modified as \"deities\")]\n>> \n>> [Sense of support from colleagues, confidence in overcoming current challenges]\n>> \n>> //Second round of tuning occurs, hijacking positive channel overload to penetrate the secure sublayer-5 NORG construct. Focus on individuals with conceptual awareness of the \"Department of █████████████.\"//\n>> \n>> [Sense of overwhelming dread for the Department of █████████████]\n>> \n>> [Sense of overwhelming dread for 3,185 locations within Foundation facilities, 295 programs under Foundation control]\n>> \n>> [Conditional relief: disbelief, rejection of concept]\n>> \n>> [Sense of awareness by higher powers (tuned as \"Overseers,\" modified as \"watchdogs\")]\n> \n> **1730** – SEPARCH exits B10-8180. BERATE unobserved by MIDSIGHT. High levels of disruption to all accessible empathetic networks continues.\n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135189G)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: FID-384100\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: FID-561002, FID-51081, FID-55982, FID-580003\n> __Date__: 08/04/2056\n> \n> **1502** – SEPARCH escorts three unidentified individuals into B10-8180, then into ABLATE MALAISE containment area. Direct observation lost.\n> \n> **1506** – A message is transmitted across the QWEX mental construct identical to the one described in AMAR-135145G. Average clarity of MIDSIGHT reduced to 30% by continued disruption.\n> \n> **1509** – An identical message is broadcast on identical channels. Average clarity of MIDSIGHT reduced to 20% by continued disruption.\n> \n> **1516** – An identical message is broadcast on identical channels. Average clarity of MIDSIGHT reduced to 12% by continued disruption.\n> \n> **1522** – SEPARCH exits B10-8180. MIDSIGHT clarity reduced to unreliable levels by continued disruption.\n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135193F)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: FID-384100\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: FID-561002, FID-51081, FID-55982, FID-580003, in addition to 103 other nodes sublet from SALIENT CROW projects.\n> __Date__: 08/07/2056\n> \n> **1454** – SEPARCH escorts five unidentified individuals into B10-8180, then into ABLATE MALAISE containment area.\n> \n> **1455** – Enhanced MIDSIGHT array achieves 100% clarity of ABLATE MALAISE containment area, including related anomalies (eighteen MIDSIGHT nodes are nulled as a result). Assorted human remains are identified as an amplifying apparatus after five individuals are added through the central orifice. BERATE identified as a focal point for specialized network.\n> \n> **1459** – A message is transmitted across the secure sublayer-5 NORG mental construct via the methods described in AMAR-135145G, maintaining selective target. Transcript of the modified message is as follows:\n>  \n>> [Sensation of breaths down nape]\n>> \n>> [Sensation of fingers on throat, nails through esophagus, breathing through blood]\n>> \n>> [Sensation of hands on chest, fingers through ribs, counting heartbeats directly]\n>> \n>> [Sensation of teeth through vertebrae, enamel scraping against bone, gnawing on nerves]\n>> \n>> [Conditional relief: use of a targeted amnestic (triggers included to assist acquisition)]\n>> \n>> [Sense of awareness by higher powers (tuned as \"█████████,\" modified as \"secrets in coffins\")]\n>> \n>> //Extensive noise follows, likely tuned to disrupt any subsequent signals.//\n> \n> Local empathetic networks are rendered temporarily inaccessible. Thirty-three MIDSIGHT nodes are nulled as a result. SEPARCH tracking lost. \n\n> **MIDSIGHT SUMMARY (AMAR-135223A)**\n> __Supervising Analyst__: N/A\n> __Subordinated Nodes__: N/A\n> __Date__: 08/08/2056\n> \n> **1300** – SEPARCH enters B10-8180 with a janitorial cart.
