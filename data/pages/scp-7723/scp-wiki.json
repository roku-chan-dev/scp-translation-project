Foundation clairvoyants assigned to SCP-7723 have sole discretion over its containment and handling, and access to the relevant facilities at Overwatch Command.\n\nFoundation clairvoyant **{{Conduit Λ-3}}** is allotted a comprehensive set of lifelong provisions, which includes:\n* hazard pay,\n* health benefits,\n* living accommodations,\n* a personal security detail,\n* three weeks annual vacation, and\n* expedited passage into an afterlife of their choosing, post-death.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]After extensive coordination with the relevant Macrocosmic parties, traversal along a secure transcosmic trajectory has been assured.[[/span]]\n**{{Conduit Λ-3}}** must fulfill their designated responsibilities until their natural death. This role must be conferred to a new clairvoyant in advance of their death. Accepting the role of **{{Conduit}}** remains a voluntary action; prospects must undergo the process with clarity of mind.\n\nThe search for auxiliary clairvoyants in fulfilling Project HOMEBOUND continues. Selection of clairvoyants must occur outside Foundation operational hierarchy.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-start= --]\n|color-family=dark\n|unique-name=description\n|display-name=DESCRIPTION\n]]\nSCP-7723 is a primeval energy source encased in a crystalline membrane.\n\nMaterials analysis has determined the membrane is fractally complex and supports the continued operation of SCP-7723. Breaching the membrane in any fashion renders SCP-7723 inert. Short of neutralizing it, however, the continued operation of SCP-7723 will persist only after the source of the breach is removed. SCP-7723 autonomously predicts breaches; researchers conclude through spectral analysis that the source becomes inert before any disruption takes place, but this always precedes a planned physical incursion. If the membrane takes superficial damage, it undergoes a brief period of self-repair before returning to its full protective capacity.\n\nThrough the coordination of a team of Foundation clairvoyants, the energy source provides direct observation of a pivotal future event, designated Prime-Terminus. Sensory data produced by the event is conferred to a single clairvoyant (currently **{{Conduit Λ-3}}**) via psionic connection.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:blacklight-box-source |inc-section-end= --]]]\n\n[[div class=\"lite-heading\"]]\n----\n++ ADDENDA MATERIALS\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote lightweight custom\"]]\n++++ DEEPWELL SERVER FILES ACCESSED\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box secure\"]]\n+++ UTILIZATION RECORD\n----\nBy the prolonged use of SCP-7723 across several decades, each **{{Conduit}}** has not only gleaned credible visions of the future, but has also developed an extrasensory perception of a pivotal past event to a sufficient resolution. The use of SCP-7723 in this manner proves painful. The assigned Foundation clairvoyants are currently developing this past-sight technique in Project HOMEBOUND.\n\nPrime-Terminus presently denotes the impending and forcible dissolution of The Foundation, and remains fixed. The Foundation has no known means of averting Prime-Terminus. The gap closes, day by day, and the possibility for aversion may one day shut.\n----\n++++ SECURE\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box contain\"]]\n+++ HISTORY\n----\n[[div class=\"limit\"]]\n[[div class=\"anchor\"]]\n[[div class=\"sidecontainer\"]]\n++++ Foundation of Thirteen\n++++ Unification Congress\n----\nHeld in 1893, the Unification Congress was a series of meetings that marked a watershed moment in the history of The SCP Foundation.\n\nIn these meetings, the Unification of The SCP Foundation was officially declared. The Unification involved thirteen of the most prominent normalcy preservation organizations in the world combining their resources and aligning their operations according to a unified shared interest.\n\nThe Unification also established the following.\n* The inauguration of the first Overseer Council.\n* The binding pact of Security, Containment, and Protection.\n* The preliminary development and implementation of the Veil of Normality.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nThe Foundation has been in the possession of SCP-7723 since the **Foundation of Thirteen Unification Congress** in 1893. During these meetings, a hitherto unknown party presented SCP-7723 to Foundation Administrator Willhelm Fredericks as a gift of confidence.\n\nA full account of the item's history before Foundation containment does exist. It cannot, however, be stringently verified in line with prevailing Foundation consensus: Accounts exist according to a robust genealogy of oral history.\n\nIn 1973, amidst a period of declining health, then-121-year-old Administrator Fredericks[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]] [[span class=\"bt bb\"]]BORN[[/span]] Willhelm Fredericks, 19 July 1852, South African Republic. [[/span]] had devised specialized Class-V Mnestic drugs to protect against the loss of memories about the object's history. Only by “committing the history to memory,” he stated, could he assure the information “would not stain the Veil.”\n\nIn the summer of 1976, shortly before his death, Administrator Fredericks relayed the object's history to his chosen successor. This summons involved the transference of other top-secret materials, including the bequeathal of [[[scp-262|SCP-0262]]], and access to Class-V Mnestics.\n\nRecognizing the primacy of the knowledge Administrator Fredericks relayed, his successor would later relax the associated informational security protocols. A living record of SCP-7723's known history now exists within the Archival Office database, encrypted within its DEEPWELL servers. His successor would also begin formal research into SCP-7723 and enlist Foundation clairvoyants to the task.\n\nConsidering the task singularly burdensome, these clairvoyants would soon appoint one of their own to the role of **{{Conduit}}** -- a role only three have held to-date.\n----\n++++ CONTAIN\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"report-box protect\"]]\n+++ LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT\n----\n[[div class=\"blockquote lightweight justified\"]]\nOn 21 June 1976, a fatigued and bedridden Administrator Fredericks made his final recorded appearance.
