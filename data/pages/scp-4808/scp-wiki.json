Foundation personnel disguised as animal patrol are to bring SCP-4808-1 to the nearest Foundation site.

The cadaver will be replaced with a specimen of //Canis familiarus//[[footnote]]Species name for the domestic dog[[/footnote]], designated SCP-4808-1.\n\nIn all cases observed, SCP-4808-1 is a non-anomalous, healthy dog of average age. However, all specimens of SCP-4808-1 thus catalogued have been of breeds with blue, thick coats.\n\n**Additional Notes:** Demographic data of the 309 recorded subjects of SCP-4808 have revealed certain patterns, listed below.\n\n* 81% of subjects are unmarried.\n * 93% of subjects do not have children.\n* 95% of subjects are described as \"introverted.\"\n* 85% of subjects make yearly salaries of less than $30,000.\n * 70% of subjects are unemployed.\n * 51% of subjects have some kind of disability that makes it difficult to find employment.\n* 89% of subjects die from old age or another age-related malady.\n * 34% of subjects have one or more failed suicides in their history.\n* 96% of subjects either dropped out of or failed secondary schooling or college.\n* 98% report feeling unfulfilled in their lives\n* 100% are reported to have called their lives \"a joke\" at some point on social media.\n* 100% are mildly allergic to dogs.\n\n**Addendum:** Incident Report\n\nPoI-3281 [[footnote]]Legal name ████████ ████, had a known history of failed businesses, early employment terminations, and in one case, an attempted connection with GoI-9272 (\"Potz Blitz\"). Lack of employment often cited as a \"lack of motivation\"[[/footnote]] was found dead in their home due to self-termination by hanging. An instance of SCP-4808-1 appeared; however, its throat was slit and the specimen was dead. Investigation of PoI-3281's apartment found several other suicide implements, all broken. PoI-3281's suicide note is as follows:\n\n> It's all a joke, just a long, unfulfilling joke. The punchline isn't worth it. No matter what, it never will be. Why not just cut it short?\n> \n> If my entire life is a joke, it's not even a good one.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include more-by:notgull]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4807]]] | SCP-4808 | [[[SCP-4809]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
