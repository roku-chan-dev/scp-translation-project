It is extremely diverse in terms of modern ecosystems. However, this does not mean that the island itself is not at risk. Dozens of corporations throughout the Americas have been gunning for the natural resources of the island.\n\nMoving onto the arguably most important part of the island, VNP-8007-322, also known as Fallen Scales, Shimmering Obsidian, holds the island upon her back.^^[((bibcite draws))]^^ It has been noted by multiple studies upon the island that it is intensely lush, even for its tropical location. This has led to the idea that landmasses with VNP-8007 underneath lead to greater ecological diversity in some manner. There have been multiple theories on the cause of this, be it life-giving thaumaturgy given off subconsciously or the waste products of VNP-8007 being akin to fertilizer on an extremely large scale. More research into this topic will have to be conducted to come to a true answer, as the topic is scarcely studied. From her position as the one holding the island, Fallen Scales, Shimmering Obsidian also holds a more well understood role in the ecosystem of Scale Island. She acts as a primary producer, feeding off of the energy generated by VNP-8007-Î± and providing a place for minerals to form on her back.\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/doctorlilithsophia:ecosystem-report:scale-island/Chrysomallon_squamiferum_2.png|caption= Helix dracarys squamiferum.|width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n\nAs we focus in on her scales, we can find not just the mineral buildup you may expect, but a peculiarly adapted subspecies of //Helix dracarys//, more commonly known as [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/vnp-111 VNP-111] or dragon snails. //Helix dracarys squamiferum//, which we have dubbed scale-feeders, only exist on the back of Fallen Scales, Shimmering Obsidian, who is noted to try and care for the species. They subsist on a diet of the minerals grown on her back and seem to have a minor ability to subsist off of thermal energy generated deep in the Earth. The methane sacks, usually used for the fire-breathing of VNP-111, seem to have been repurposed to help clean their mouths, due to the mineral-rich diet and the possibility of food getting lodged in their mouth. It's been theorized that Scale-Feeders evolved in a very short amount of time from the Goowyvern lineage.^^[((bibcite wond))]^^ Wondertainment-Made species seem to have an extraordinary ability to adapt to their environments in a miniscule amount of time, displayed well with [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1550 VNP-1550].  \n\nA less extreme version of VNP-111 is found above-ground, where it lives a docile life of feeding the various non-paranormal flowers and berries that make up the majority of the vegetation. Each examined specimen has shown traits from multiple of the domesticated dragon snail lineages sold by Dr. Wondertainment, and are considered as wild dragon snail breeds. Their defense mechanisms in the wild are a miracle of behavioral adaptation, going from domesticated to wild successfully. They fend off predators, such as crows, beetles, rats, and [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-098 VNP-098], using their minor flame breathing ability as a warning sign. This strategy has proved effective, with many less intelligent predators moving to easier targets instead of risking an attack on VNP-111. Truly, their defense mechanisms in the wild are a real miracle of adaptation. Insider reports from Marshall, Carter, and Dark claim that all strains of VNP-111 will be harvested from the island to produce methane for fertilizer and steam generators.\n\nOn the topic of VNP-098, known otherwise as surgeon crabs, they have achieved an astounding population on Scale Island. Their method of hunting has proven to be quite effective in taking down some of the larger mammals on the island, such as the sizeable deer population, as well as some of the fruit that grows prominently. They also feed, occasionally, on dragon snails. Due to the methane content that is produced by the animals, it is believed that they have adapted to be able to utilize the methane within dragon snail organs in their own internal processes instead of a waste product.\n\nUnfortunately for VNP-098, they have recently been preyed on by hawks. The species, red-tail hawks, have a strategy of swooping into a swarm of the crabs and grabbing one with their talons, before retreating. This, coupled with biting off the arms of the crab in flight, have proven effective in becoming a consistent food source for the animals. Their population is likely going to decline in the future, until they gain better methods to defend or fight this predation. Our sources have noted that multiple restaurant chains, including Ambrose Restaurants, hope to take and breed populations as a delicacy.\n\nOther than the non-paranormal fauna, we also have two distinct species that fulfill herbivorous niches on Scale Island. [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4445-ex VNP-4445-EX] is more spread through the island, with a larger population to boot. They have not adapted much since the population on the island began flourishing, though a new behavior has been noted in their symbiotes. When a predator approaches their host, if they are not ready to defend themselves or flee, the symbiote will screech a high frequency call. When stegosaurus hear the call from their own or other symbiotes, they will flee with their pack. While stegosaurus meat is rather unpalatable to humans, their symbiotes are said to be delicious. There are many reports of high-class restaurants in America and Britain attempting to bid on rights to harvest this delicacy. Stegosaurus, when they have their symbiotes removed, will either perish because of their nervous system connection, or be much less likely to survive due to loss of warning system and sustenance derived from their symbiotes.\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/doctorlilithsophia:ecosystem-report:scale-island/1200px-Phalaropus_fulicarius_MHNT.ZOO.2010.11.119.14.jpg|caption= Two Diogen Eggs.|width=350px|align= left]]\n\nThe most populous species of the dedicated carnivores is [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3199 VNP-3199], also known as //homo gallus berus// or diogens. When it was first discovered that they had somehow gotten to Scale Island, there was concern that they would overtake the other species and result in extinction on the island. When further research was conducted, however, it was found that they have settled into the ecosystem of the island without too much trouble. Instead of the theorized horde hunting, VNP-3199 was found to instead fill the role of scavengers.^^[((bibcite chic))]^^ They will consistently attempt to eat from a corpse instead of try to kill another animal, with only a few instances of diogen hunting being recorded. The population is controlled by the two other main predators of the island. The population of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-939 redwolves], with around a dozen packs being recorded, has been noted to prey upon them. diogens, despite their danger toward humans and wildlife, are sometimes taken in as high value exotic pets. As this is written, there are multiple listings for diogen eggs in the Marshall, Carter, and Dark auctions. A common practice is releasing them when they get too large, which comes with expected dangers. Eggs are often sourced from the wild.\n\nExpanding upon the ecological role of redwolves, scientifically known as //hyla copia//, they will often prey upon a wide variety of animals. The mimicking behavior of redwolves has been found to also expand to other species outside of humans, with known distress vocalizations of squirrels, hawks, deer, and diogen. There has been one recorded instance of a Redwolf vocalizing the distress call of [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-966 VNP-966]. They have been observed to somewhat prefer hunting diogens over other prey. Turgenev theorizes that this is due to the at least partially human genome, as VNP-3199 are known to contain portions of human DNA.^^[((bibcite hunt))]^^ Redwolf body parts are known to be used in various pseudoscientific remedies.\n\nFinally, we reach the apex predator of Scale Island, VNP-966. They are known more simply as sleep killers, though scientifically as //Pan somnus//. They are endangered outside of Scale Island and are known to prey upon diogens and redwolves commonly, though they will occasionally settle for prey such as deer. Outside of their feeding habits, sleep killers have been seen to have extensive social lives inside of their pack, as well as the ability to build primitive homes for themselves. Much of their day, when not following prey, will be spent grooming each other, much like other primates.\n\n[[div class=\"grid-item\"]]\n[[include component:image-block name= http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/doctorlilithsophia:ecosystem-report:scale-island/Wood_Art.jpg|caption= A Sleep Killer made shelter.|width=350px|align= right]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nTheir relationship with redwolves is complex. While they very commonly feed off of them, they seem to have adapted a defense mechanism for their young. Redwolf newborns often resemble human children, though on Scale Island, their young instead hold some traits of VNP-966, such as a slightly elongated face and longer fingers, meant to resemble the claws of Sleep Killers. They are not yet on the level of brood parasitism as regular redwolf young, though it has been noted that some sleep killers are caring for known impostor children. Unfortunately, sleep killers are poached at a frankly astounding rate by corporations such as Marshall, Carter, and Dark. They are used for traditional medicine, eaten, and used as ornamentation despite their status as endangered.\n\nThe simple biodiversity of Scale Island is a beautiful testament to the paranormal and mundane co-existing. While these animals are paranormal, it is good to remember that they are still animals. They have instincts that they will follow, and they will evolve and adapt to their environment. If you want to help preserve this beautiful ecosystem, at risk because of the workings of corporations, you can donate at [[[www.scaleisland.com]]], or you can lobby your local government to see change. We are counting on you, dear readers, to help make a difference.\n\n[[bibliography title]]\n: draws : Draws, D. (2017).
