My name is KeeLee, the creator and admin of Just Girly Things. I created JGT because I had a mission: To introduce girls to the great world of girlhood. Unfortunately, so many lovely ladies have gotten lost due to the corruption of our cruel world. With Just Girly Things, our mission is to bring girls back to their roots. Everyone needs some help sometimes, and I'm here to provide it. I have a great team of girls to help me as well, so feel free to contact any of the other girls here if you need some help! Just a reminder- you are not enough. Not until you've accepted the true ways of girlhood into your heart. So many girls think that they know how to be a girl, or not be a girl if you ask them. But my way is the true way. I promise you that you can be happier once you give it all up. You'll find what you're missing. I hope you can find something that interests you on our little site. We've got tons of blog posts and articles that share how you're supposed to think. So just listen to those, and you'll be fine!

First and foremost, JGT is a psychological horror series meant to capture the horrors of the real world and real people. Transphobia, eating disorders, misogyny- they're all things we deal with on a daily basis. I wanted to take something that is close to me- girlyness and loving cute things and pink and make it a creepy commentary of the way some people are treated in society. While JGT mostly covers girls, these are issues that are prevalent to all of us of any group. JGT is meant to be realistic horror, in the sense that it is almost something you could see in real life. It is supposed to make your skin crawl, make you gag, want to break your computer, the likes. If you hate the characters, it means the author is doing it right. \n\n**I do NOT agree with the views stated by Just Girly Things in any shape or form, and neither do any of the authors writing for it.**\n\nJGT is a blog site that in-universe has existed since 2006, and existed online since 2010, and still runs to this day. If you want to write in the past or present is up to you.\n\nTo include the site theme for JGT in your article, put this:\n\n> @@[[include :scp-wiki:theme:just-girly-things]]@@\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Articles]]\n\nIf you have an article to add, please add it under the appropriate section.\n\n**SCPS:**\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4319|SCP-4319]]] By [[*user DianaBerry]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7906|SCP-7906]]] By [[*user DianaBerry]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8319|SCP-8319]]] by [[*user Mew-ltiverse]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6679|SCP-6679]]] by [[*user Miss Lapis]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8519|SCP-8519]]] by [[*user DianaBerry]] and [[*user VapidPoem]]\n\n**Tales:**\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/standing-on-the-shore-at-dusk|Standing On The Shore At Dusk]]] By [[*user NotOrteil]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/she-s-worth-it-i-promise|she's worth it, i promise]]] by [[*user LOVEMARGINAL]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/ella-s-sickly-sweets| Ella's Sickly Sweets]]] By [[*user DianaBerry]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/filled-to-the-brim-with-girlish-glee|Filled To The Brim With Girlish Glee]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-remove-glitter-from-a-polyester-dress|How To Remove Glitter From A Polyester Dress]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-remove-human-blood-from-a-polyester-dress|How To Remove Human Blood From A Polyester Dress]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-remove-kerosene-from-a-polyester-dress|How To Remove Kerosene From A Polyester Dress]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/how-to-remove-spinal-fluid-from-a-polyester-dress|How To Remove Spinal Fluid From A Polyester Dress]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/polyester-woman|Polyester Woman (Epilogue)]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/losing-my-colors| Losing My Colors]]] By Alan Daris (User deleted)\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/a-crack-in-the-porcelain|A Crack in the Porcelain]]] By [[*user UraniumEmpire]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/we-can-t-plan-out-our-lives-or-can-we| We can't plan out our lives, or can we?]]] By [[*user DianaBerry]]\n♡[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/girly-girlz-be-just-like-your-doll|Girly Girlz!

If you have a character you feel should added to this list, please message me and we can discuss it. \n\n------\n\n##violet|**Jess Landons:**## Around 19 years old, Jess is the most unique member of JGT. She is JGT's problem child, meaning that she doesn't always conform to every single rule set up. Jess has high resistance to KeeLee's reality-bending effects, which obviously upsets KeeLee. KeeLee finds Jess as a challenge, so that's why she never gives up on her. She is kept under a very close watch by KeeLee. Jess is a victim of sex trafficking and child abuse, which has been hinted at in her featured works. \n\n**##deeppink|KeeLee:**## The creator of JGT, an abusive control freak reality bender with a thing for pink, PoI-4319, KeeLee is all of these things. KeeLee wants everything to be exactly as //she// wants, and will **make sure** it goes that way. It seems easy to look at her and go \"Have her show transphobia there that's her character.\" Keep in mind that not only is KeeLee transphobic, but she is so many other shades of horrible. Explore one you haven't seen done yet. \n\nOne thing to remember is that KeeLee is **smart**. She's not easily fooled or easily tracked down. She **gets** what she wants. Most of the time.\n\nIf you ask me, KeeLee is not a physical person, but a digital entity. However, this is up to interpretation. First and foremost, KeeLee is a mysterious person who pretends to be a close friend of anyone who talks to her. She wants you to think you're best friends who know everything about each other. When in reality, no one has scratched the surface of KeeLee.\n\n**###49CC80|Ella:**## Ella is Landon's older sister. She owns a bakery and is a very ditzy traditional housewife. She is also KeeLee's right-hand woman. Ella was a good sister to Landon before JGT brainwashed her. It's up to you if she is beyond saving or not. \n\n**##coral|Landon/Cora:**## Landon is Ella's younger brother. He is around age 14 and is a trans man who has been brainwashed into believing he is a girl by JGT. Despite the influence of JGT, if put in the right situation, Landon is capable of temporarily remembering his true identity. \n\n##black|**PINK FLY/Theresa:**## Theresa Petrucci is a chemist who does graphic design work for JGT. Prior to falling into JGT's orbit, she had been an organizer of a TERF art collective; sometime in 2009, however, [[[how-to-clean-a-polyester-dress|Theresa met KeeLee]]]. Though she's generally pleasant to talk to, she can be remarkably cruel, even for a member of JGT. Has a naturally high psychic resistance threshold, due to a traumatic brain injury sustained in high school. Rarely on the website.\n\nIt's important to note that Theresa is //not// brainwashed; everything she does for Just Girly Things, she does of her own free will.\n\n###f299af|**Madeleine von Schaeffer:**## A wealthy ex-aristocrat who provided much of the initial funding for Just Girly Things. Though she doesn't engage with the magazine or site, she's kept close correspondence with KeeLee since at least 2005. Proper, polite, and always smiling; most don't register why her skin doesn't seem to crease correctly, and fewer still recognize the callous manipulator beneath that porcelain smile.\n\n------\n\nAgain, there are other characters, and of course, you can create your own, but these are the main characters. It is not necessary to include any of them in your JGT piece.\n\nAlso, depending on when it takes place, the characters may be older or younger. \n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab How to Write]]\nI got into this a little bit in the what is section, but I will fully get into it here. \n\nJGT can be SCPs or tales, though currently there are mostly tales. JGT is not meant to be physical horror. You can do it, but it needs to be mixed in with psychological horror. JGT should contain some sort of sensitive theme, and your piece needs to take this and explore it. Character-based pieces are the main thing of JGT, SCP or not. \n\nIf you want to do an SCP, it needs to be something that can be linked to JGT. Generally, accounts of JGT don't warrant their own SCP pages. If you want to do an SCP, do something such as a product, or perhaps a particular person if they have more than just being a member of JGT to offer.\n\nJGT currently has no GOI format, so tales are where you can see most of the blog posts. However, tales do not have to be chat forums or blog posts. If you show a blogpost, you should try to explore your topic through the characters, comments, and content of the post. If you want to do a normal story format, you also need to share the story through the characters and what they go through.\n\nYou do not have to tackle something JGT has done before, feel free to add new bigotry to JGT. The only thing they really aren't is racist, as they'd like to brainwash people of every race and culture. \n\nJGT members essentially talk like brainwashed aliens pretending to be human women, as that is the effect JGT has on the mind. The mindset JGT sets is not something just anyone can break out of, and it takes a special person to be able to do so due to how it works. JGT is highly contagious, anyone who looks at the website will become infected as long as they are AFAB. AMAB are not affected by JGT, however, there are possible ways they can still be affected. They are just not affected by the website.\n\nEveryone brainwashed is bigoted, and you're meant to hate them- they're terrible people. However, remember they used to be normal people, and the only one currently that isn't human is KeeLee. If you'd like to write another non-human member of JGT, that's up to you and your creativity. This does not mean you should hate them any less. \n\nAn important thing to note about JGT is that it has no canon. You do not have to follow the continuity of other pieces. If you want to do a portrayal that is different from another one you've seen, even different from mine, go ahead! \n\nOne thing is that KeeLee is not meant to be defeated. People can and should be saved, but she will always be there, mimicking the fact that some real-life evil never goes away. \n\nIf you'd like help writing for JGT or have any questions, feel free to contact me, [[*user DianaBerry]] or [[*user UraniumEmpire]].\n\n++ UraniumEmpire's Advice\n\nJust Girly Things is, fundamentally, a group that advocates and enforces toxic gender expectations. Not every JGT article has to be about memetic hazards or peer pressure turning people into drones; however, this coercion is an essential bit of background information, and should be kept in mind when writing for the GoI.\n\nNew characters are encouraged; as with many cults, JGT operates as a pyramid scheme of cruelty, delegating the task of management and recruitment to subordinate members. Memetic hazards are convenient, but they are not enough on their own; they must be //distributed//.\n\nLike any cultic movement, members can and do occasionally get out. This is rare, however, and almost always requires outside support. JGT enforcers understand this; one of the best ways to ensure a member's continued loyalty is by alienating or assimilating their support network. Grifts work best when they play on what the dupe hasn't yet achieved -- take away their security, and you've got at least four back-up plans.\n\nJust Girly Things is a syncretic organization. Theresa's Catholic convictions must contend with the paganism of Madeleine von Schaeffer; Ella's orthorexia exists alongside Monica's binging; Jess must be \"available\" to every man who buys her, but Ella may only be a faithful wife; and while disagreement with the party line is unacceptable, KeeLee has no problems subcontracting ideologically-opposed workers as long as they don't stir the pot. Simply put, JGT's \"traditional femininity\" means whatever its members need it to mean, a cult of tradition that is both radically inclusive and uncompromisingly xenophobic. Just Girly Things is thus [[[https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/umberto-eco-ur-fascism|ur-fascist]]].\n\nAs evangelists, every character possesses a vocabulary that reflects the nature of and familiarity with their personal ideology. For some possible examples:\n* Landon as \"Cora\", a teenage boy who had transphobia forced upon him, would be familiar with pithier transphobic slogans such as \"adult human female\" and \"trans-identified [wronggendering]\", but would be unlikely to use the more politically motivated \"gender ideology\". He would most certainly not quote academic and Catholic ethicists such as Janice Raymond.\n* Theresa's prior experience as a transphobic mainstreamer would have taught her to use more \"acceptable\" rhetoric; meanwhile, years of performative cruelty may cause her to be cruder and more hateful when she believes she can get away with it, or when experiencing a nervous breakdown.\n* Ella is effectively an influencer. Her goal is engagement and sales, and she'll speak whatever languages gets her the most eyes and wallets. However, her strong beliefs may cause her to drop something that she believes to be normal, but would sound especially ghoulish to the average person.\n\nWith regards to writing characters that may be a bit more complex, my thoughts are under the collapsible.\n[[collapsible show=\"+ CW: abuse, disordered eating, rape and genocide apologia, conversion therapy\" hide=\"- Don't say I didn't warn you.\"]]\n+++ KeeLee\nKeeLee should never come across as a human.\n\nI repeat: //KeeLee should never come across as a human.//\n\nIs KeeLee a human? Did KeeLee Auburn //used// to be a human? That's up for you to decide, but KeeLee works best when she acts as a //force// rather than a character, an agent of the JGT ideology with little if any self-awareness. This is not to say she's not clever -- KeeLee is capable of old-fashioned manipulation and gaslighting when the situation calls for it -- but this is not someone that can be intimidated or reasoned with. Practically speaking, this is not even //someone//.\n\nBefitting of someone who believes in the virtues of 50s housewifery, KeeLee is a hacker and a programmer.[[footnote]]Programming was traditionally a female vocation during the 50s and 60s.[[/footnote]] If there is information that can be accessed from the clear web, KeeLee is more than capable of finding it. However, she most likely doesn't possess the qualia to be creative; she instead relies on contractors to do anything more complicated than data structures.\n\nWhile other characters can and do appear outside JGT spaces, KeeLee's appearances are uniformly through JGT mediums, whether that be the magazine, the site, the IRC, or a two-story suburban home converted into a biomechanical Hill House. Within these mediums, KeeLee exerts an immense amount of control; outside of this, KeeLee must rely on her followers to accomplish anything. Additionally, she is limited by her infrastructure, and a throttled connection or jammed press is more than enough to slow her down.\n\n+++ Jess Landons\nJess is a character stuck in limbo: KeeLee cannot brainwash Jess, but Jess is dependent on KeeLee.\n\nUnlike the other members of Just Girly Things, Jess is capable of recognizing when Just Girly Things does something evil. Even so, JGT is the best she's ever had, and provides some modicum of emotional and material support to her. No matter how much she pushes against KeeLee and the others, there's always a way to make her fold.\n\nJess's contributions to Just Girly Things are most likely to be benign. You're looking at inane personality tests, mundane recipes, fashion advice, and what vivariums go best with your furniture. Any irregularities in her content will most likely be reinforcements of her own shame disguised as \"tough love\" advice. Even this, however, would be tightly controlled by KeeLee; too much emotional vulnerability would expose her as a victim of abuse.\n\nWithin JGT, Jess functions as an oasis of reason and compassion. A word or two from Jess might be just what someone needs to break out of KeeLee's grip. Additionally, even if she can't save herself, KeeLee's obsession with breaking her in is a significant sink of time, resources, and attention.\n\n+++ Ella Romero\nAs both victim and perpetrator, Ella occupies a special space in Just Girly Things. Her abuse and function in Just Girly Things is inextricable -- she is, essentially, an //example//.\n\nElla is motivated by a sense of belonging. She wants to be physically appealing, wants to fit into groups she doesn't necessarily believe in, wants to shack up with a man who treats her like shit just to have //someone//. JGT may have implanted other desires, but Ella is ultimately dependent on the approval of others.\n\nDue to their proximity, Landon is the main target of Ella's abuse. She believes that as her sibling, Landon will have no choice but to accept her, and she will do anything to keep him away from the people who might take him from her. As a minor, Landon cannot be overtly abused into detransitioning without getting in shit with CPS; Ella must convince him to detransition on his own, or at least implant that urge in his head.\n\nElla is a useful tool for KeeLee, but a lack of life experience limits what she can actually do. Ella's emotional development was stunted at 16 due to Theresa's grooming, and was further hindered by her brainwashing three years later. Moreover, her time is split between running her business, attending to her shitty husband, and being KeeLee's hatchetwoman; she simply doesn't have the time to live in the real world.\n\n+++ Theresa Petrucci\nIf Theresa can be said to be \"brainwashed\", then it is not due to some pyschic beam or cognitohazard, but because she constructed her beliefs around selectively-provided information intended to trigger her conspiracism and middle-class disaffection. She //chose// to be this way.\n\nDue to a traumatic brain injury sustained during a high-school wrestling match, Theresa has an extremely high psychic and memetic resistance threshold. KeeLee therefore cannot compel her to do anything the \"traditional\" way. Theresa is instead motivated by ideological and career incentives, and is further kept in line by the knowledge that KeeLee can make her life very, //very// painful if she wishes. Because Theresa is both loyal and immune to the mind-altering effects of JGT, she makes for an excellent enforcer whenever KeeLee needs someone to act as a \"face of reason\" for a suspicious non-member, or to keep a problem child in line.\n\nTheresa's worldview is simple: men are built to be soldiers; women are to be homemakers; Feminism is the root of \"female hysteria\"; simply being LGBTQ is ontologically evil, and there is nothing that is not justified in its eradication; all sex is rape and all rape is sex; there is no salvation outside of the Catholic Church, which, by the way, is the rightful heir to all of Europe and Anatolia; the world should be split into a series of eternally warring empires; the Holocaust happened, but the Jews deserved worse; and ideological dishonesty is a cardinal sin.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Theresa's brain damage did more than make her immune to KeeLee. Theresa suffers from an extreme deficiency in her self-preservation response. This can translate into anything from a disregard for laboratory safety, to a failure to plan for uncertainty, to simply failing to account for force in her movements.\n\n+++ Madeleine von Schaeffer\nThere are exactly three instances where Madeleine von Schaeffer should be physically appear in your article:\n* She is manipulating, radicalizing, gaslighting, intimidating, or preying upon a major character that has stumbled into her life or business.\n* She is negotiating a deal between her family trust and a major organization, under the guise of being a \"secretary\" to her \"boss\".\n* Your story is non-canon.\nWithin the context of the Trashfire, Madeleine is an agent of the Violet Archon; regardless, as one of the major investors of JGT, she should believe that it's part of some bigger plan, whether that be monetary, religious, ideological, or a combination of the three. KeeLee and Theresa are loud[[footnote]] Compared to Madeleine. [[/footnote]] and actively dangerous, and whether or not that was her plan, that noise draws attention away from Madeleine. She understands the value of anonymity //quite// well.\n\nMadeleine von Schaeffer was born an aristocrat, but in this day and age, she must act as a businesswoman. One of the most important aspects of running a business is knowing when and how to delegate work to your subordinates -- and when your designs are as grand as Madeleine's, you cannot hope to be everywhere at once. Madeleine is intelligent, charismatic, and capable in a fight, but why get her hands dirty?\n\nMadeleine's biggest weakness is her inability to grapple with her own sexuality. Regular use of BLACK FLY has convinced her that she has eliminated the \"threat\" of her lesbianism; as such, she has never learned to rein in her attractions, and is prone to mistakes, poor judgement, and emotional dysregulation in the presence of women she has a personal investment in.\n\n+++ Landon Romero\nFor the love of G-d, give him a personality other than \"brainwashed trans dude\".\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nOh, and uh... don't feel the need to laser-focus on the transphobia. We've got a lot of those already.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Character profiles]]\nThese character profiles are from a currently deleted SCP about a JGT virtual world game, but I worked too hard on them to let them go to waste, so I'm putting them here!
