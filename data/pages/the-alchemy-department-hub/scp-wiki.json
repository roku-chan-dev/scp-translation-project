A department much-maligned by the usual research staff, very few people really understand just how much it does.  Alchemy isn't poking around with chemicals, and turning lead in to gold; it can, but it's more than that.  Alchemy is the manipulation of the Aetheric forces which generate reality around us.\n\nThe men and women of the Alchemy department, are few and extraordinary.  Lead by Director Ruslav Diaghilev, they are tasked with containing threats beyond rational science, in places most Foundation personnel can only dream of.\n\nThey do so without thanks, or respect from the majority of The Foundation.  \n\nIf you ever encounter something so fantastic that you just can't explain it, you just may need to consult an Alchemist.\n\n-----\n\n+++ Tales Series in this Setting\n* **The Great Seal**\n * [[[Finding Balance]]] - Director Diaghilev, one of the most senior personnel in The Foundation, acquires a new student.

[[size 70%]]**//by Alwaid//**[[/size]]\n\n-----\n\n+++ Writing for this Setting + Characters\nAlchemy, at its base, is a pretty loosely defined thing. It involves manipulating elemental forces all around us, be it water, fire, earth, metal, gravity etc.  Its effects are not unlike thaumaturgy.  \n\nThe actual application of alchemy is severely limited on earth, and within 2 light-years of it, due to actions caused by Director Diaghilev alongside Foundation assets in the early 20th century.  They enacted a working known as the \"Great Seal\" which reduced alchemic influence over local space-time as a protection against a significant number of hostile entities.  As such, Alchemy is sharply limited by most people.  Notable exceptions are Director Diaghilev (who cheats, more or less), and any alchemist outside of two light-years from earth. \n\nThis includes alternate realities that didn't implement the Great Seal, and anywhere distant from earth.  \n\nOverall themes of this setting are the past catching back up to you, and using your power and influence to help the world move on from its past.  \n\nImportant to note, \"Alchemy\" is not a stand-in for \"Magic\".  You can't just poof things out of thin air.  There's definitely magic-like abilities, but try and use your best judgement.  My yardstick is: does it involve elements, and/or does it serve the story?  No flinging Ray of Disintegration around, basically.\n\nHave fun, and let me know if there's any questions!\n[[>]]\n//~Magnus//\n[[/>]]\n\n,,//**...Turns out I was right.
