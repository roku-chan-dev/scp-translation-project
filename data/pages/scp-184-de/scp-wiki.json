Researchers inside the testing area must remain cautious and should only move slowly. In case of emergency, the effect may be reversed by holding the subject in place and carefully bending one of their legs until it breaks. In this case, at least one employee with medical training should be nearby to immediately treat the injury.\n\n**Description:** SCP-184-DE is a Himation [[footnote]]A piece of cloth worn as mantle over the Chiton or Achiton in classical antiquity.[[/footnote]] made from spider silk. If SCP-184-DE is worn by a person as their only piece of clothing around their torso, it instantly transforms itself and the wearer into an arachnid of the order //Araneae// (Spiders). The body's centre of mass is preserved throughout, resulting in the subject dropping about 1 m in height. The precise species appears to be random, but stays constant for every person over multiple uses.\n\nSubjects retain their cognitive abilities, but their perception and instincts become those of a normal spider of the same species. Test subjects transformed this way are capable of understanding research personal and communicating with them (e. g. by pointing on letters).\n\nUpon being injured in spider form, subjects transform back and will feature wounds analogous to those that caused the transformation. The circumstances of the transformation often lead to further damage to the subject.\n\nThe only other known method to transform a subject back is a honest expression of deep affection towards the subject.\n\n[[=]]\n**Addendum: Identification of the transformations**\n[[/=]]\n[[div]]\n||||~ D-Class ||~ Result ||~ Notes ||\n|| D-08-153 || f., light-skinned, brown-haired, green-eyed || //Alopecosa trabalis// ||  ||\n|| D-08-279 || m., light-skinned, blond, brown-eyed || Autumn Orb Weaver (//Metellina segmentata//[[footnote]]Formerly also knowns as //Meta segmentata//.[[/footnote]]) ||  ||\n|| D-09-202 || m., light-skinned, black-haired, blue-eyed || Caterpillar Jumping Spider (//Uroballus carlei//) || First known sighting of this species[[footnote]]//Uroballus carlei// was discovered in 2018 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and officially acknowledged the following year.[[/footnote]] ||\n|| D-09-111 || f., dark-skinned, black-haired, green-eyed || Fencepost Jumper (//Marpissa muscosa//) ||  ||\n|| D-07-431 || m., dark-skinned, black-haired, brown-eyed || Lace-webbed Spider (//Amaurobius similis//) || Subject had dwarfism, the spider was about 1.3 mm shorter than common for males ||\n|| D-07-234 || m., light-skinned, brown-haired, brown-eyed || Diadem Spider (//Araneus diadematus//) ||  ||\n|| D-02-410 || f., albinotic  || //Thanatus formicinus// || It could not be determined whether the animal's colouration was natural or caused by albinism ||\n|| D-09-656 || m., light-skinned, brown-haired, blue-eyed || Brazilian Wandering Spider (//Phoneutria nigriventer//) || The subject was sentenced for aggravated double murder of his ex-wife and her lover ||\n|| D-08-312 || f., light-skinned, red-haired, blue-eyed || Fairy-lamp Spider (//Agroeca brunnea//) ||  ||\n[[/div]]\n**Discovery:** SCP-184-DE was discovered 01/08/2009[!--this is DD/MM/YYYY, deal with it!--] following an emergency call due to a spider bite in █████████. The caller, J██████ M████ (aged 26 at TOD) was found dead in a forest cabin. The corpse of a woman (later identified as A██████ W████, aged 29) clothed in SCP-184-DE was found lying nearby, the left half of her body completely smashed. The causes of death were determined to be liver failure caused by the venom of the Chilean Recluse Spider (//Loxosceles laeta//) for the man, and severe contusions and resulting internal haemorrhage for the woman. It is of note that the response to the call was immediate, yet the victim was already found with livor mortis.",
