Bohart,\n\nAfter going through our animal behaviour files, there's one thing I noticed. Although there are numerous observations of unusual conduct on animals throughout Nexus-36: groups of bats raiding casino buffets, that period of time where every single soup along the boardwalk had a fly in it, the beach being overrun by crabs every March, plus that whole thing with the sperm whale getting stuck in the Ferris wheel we had to deal with -- no animal shows up as consistently in our records as the seagull. \n\nIt's shocking how much of the zoology department has just been cataloguing seagulls. I mean, I knew I commented thinking a bunch of them were smoking, but this rabbit hole goes so much deeper than that. All my predecessors, as far back as I can tell, have commented on the aggressive, possessive, manipulative behaviour seen by Atlantic City seagulls. I think we've stumbled upon something big, maybe the largest documented animal behavioural anomaly in the Foundation's history!\n\nI'm including my findings in the following document and will be sending it to zoologists stationed at Foundation sites around the globe for peer review. \n\n[[div class=\"generic blue\"]]\n= **[# SEAGULL_ANOMALOUS_BEHAVIOUR_333-REPORT_final_draft_v2_final.dox.pdf]**\n[[/div]]\n\nI'm sure this is just the sort of cutting-edge fieldwork that RAISA will want to have on hand, and to think I may never have clued into it had we not gotten that review!

I furthermore analyze these sightings within frameworks for folkloric tales and urban legends, establishing the commonality between the Jersey Devil and other cryptids, whose existence has been verified by the Foundation. In doing so, the likely nature of its presence is affirmed and validated. To respond to inquiries as to why the Jersey Devil has not yet been formally acknowledged by the Foundation, I include a ficto-critical account of the creature's methods of operations, aims, desires, and interpersonal relationships. This evidence-backed narrative account provides an objectively-informed and data-supported method of understanding the cryptid's relationship to human society, the Foundation, and the art of dance. It is my belief that this work will revitalize the Foundation's attempts to understand urban cryptids and their complex interplay with the individual researchers who study them.\n-----\n[[/=]]\n[[>]]\n{{Page: 1 / 5,286}}\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n@@ @@\n\n++ __SCP-7399 REPORT -- 03: Tony Catalano__\n//24/09/2022//\n\nVincent,\n\nI've been reviewing the Site-333 finances, really taking the time to sit down with them and pour over everything closely. \n\nI expected it to be messy, but my god, it's so much worse. Vincent, I cannot stress this enough: Site-333 should, by all accounts and metrics, not be financially viable to run for a period of three weeks, let alone several decades. \n\nNothing about this makes sense, I could talk your ear off about how this transgresses the most basic, fundamental rules of accounting -- hell, it practically dances on their graves, but I know you wouldn't listen. Instead, I've pulled some examples from a long, long list: \n* We've somehow taken out a triple mortgage on the property, two of which are from the //same// bank; \n* Legally we do not own the 2nd-floor washrooms -- those were sold in 1985 and I don't even know to whom, it just says \"Plumers;\"\n* Every Site-333 employee receives a voucher for 50% off purchases from [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7997 Brachistone Shoe Polish Company]. In exchange, the company receives a small portion of any footwear purchase made by one of us. I have no idea how this is enforced or monitored; \n* 35% of the gift store's revenue is listed as deriving from purchases of 'saltwater taffy.' I have not found a single invoice of us ever buying or stocking saltwater taffy; \n* We owe over $120,000 dollars to the Atlantic City Fire Department for \"services not yet rendered;\"\n* There are several hundred payments that are clearly laundering money, but whoever set that up has the receiving account //as// Site-333's; so both the actual payments and the 'dirty money' flows directly back in, minus the laundromat's operating costs;\n* Noah Patel is the sole employee who has had income tax regularly deducted from his pay, and it's listed as paying to the South Korean government.\n\nI tried to enter most of what I found into our accounting software and got the error message: \"INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR MEANINGFUL ANSWER\" before it froze up and the computer started to smoke. \n\nI know this goes against your instructions to compile the information, but I made an executive decision on behalf of the accounting department. I tossed the computer into the dumpster outback as it caught fire and piled all the papers on top of it. We're going to start over because I literally cannot begin to deal with any of that shit. \n\n- Tony\n\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=Birds2.jpg|width=100%|align=center|caption=Nx-36 -- \"Atlantic City\" -- Promotional Photo -- Update Caption Before Use.]]\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote table4 tableb\"]]\n[[table class=\"wiki-content-table\" style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n**__{{Site-333 -- Interdepartmental Communications Log:}}__**\n{{23/09/2022 -- 11:17 am}}\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n* ##blue|**Vincent Bohart**##, Director;\n* ##red|**Tony Catalano**##, Accounting & Tourism;\n* ##green|**Leonora Morales**##, Wildlife Specialist;\n* ##orange|**Noah Patel**##, Cryptozoologist & Museum Curator.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell]]\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##:** Well done everyone, I'm proud of you all. \n\n##orange|**Noah Patel##:** Thank you, sir I--\n\n##blue|**Vincent Bohart##:** Is what I would say if you hadn't all fucked this up.

Honestly half the time I don't even read what I'm signing. \n\n**Jones:** Are you sure this is information you wish to disclose?\n\n**Bohart:** Hang on, if you knew this was a test, and if I remember one thing from high school right, 'F's are 'bad,' why'd we get a green light? What does a 'situational pass' mean? \n\n**Jones:** Director, the purpose of this assessment is to determine areas of improvement for Foundation sites' recordkeeping and information security. We intended for this to be an opportunity for RAISA to identify overlooked pitfalls or redundancies, in order to improve the efficacy of current operational methods. \n\n**Jones:** Site-333 has underperformed at previously unseen levels.

We believe that attempting to resolve the identified issues would be less beneficial for the Foundation than continuing to endure the poor recordkeeping and substandard information security emblematic of your site's operations. \n\n**Bohart:** I think I follow.
