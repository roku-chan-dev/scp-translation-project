Galileo.aic is also tasked with monitoring social media and video-sharing platforms for any mention of SCP-5106, or its associated activity. All evidence is to be discredited or removed, and all direct witnesses are to be amnesticized.\n\nIf SCP-5106 is located, a joint task force comprised of [http://www.scpwiki.com/task-forces MTF Eta-4 (\"Begone Thoth\")] and MTF Victor-17 (“Nature Boys”) members is to track and attempt to contain the anomaly.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **Description**\nSCP-5106 is an avian entity resembling a Canada Goose (//Branta canadensis//), capable of communication in fluent English. SCP-5106 has heightened intelligence, though the extent of its cognitive capabilities is unknown. SCP-5106 displays a rudimentary understanding of subterfuge, slang terminology, interpersonal relations, and the barter system.\n\nSCP-5106 is capable of commanding non-anomalous fauna to follow basic commands. It is unknown whether SCP-5106 uses some form of anomalous influence or if faunae follow the orders of their own volition. Though the full extent of this ability is unknown, SCP-5106 seems incapable of using it to affect humans and other species of higher intellect.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **Discovery**\nSCP-5106 was initially discovered by civilians within Cattus Island State Park in Toms River, New Jersey. Following a drastic increase in theft-related incident reports, patrons of the park began reporting strange behavior in the local avian population. On 2020/08/13, a video depicting SCP-5106 related activity was uploaded to the media-sharing platform YouTube. The following is a transcript of the aforementioned video evidence which was flagged and transcribed by Galileo.aic:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"❏ Video Log 5106/1 ❏\" hide=\"❐ Video Log 5106/1 ❐\"]]\n**Date:** 2020/08/13\n\n**Depicted:** Carlos Vega (M 18), Randall White (M 19)\n------\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Carlos Vega is walking in front of the camera through a dimly lit playground.]//\n\n**Carlos:** Man, when you said we was goin' to see the birds, this isn't what I thought you meant.\n\n**Randall:** Nah dude, I told you, the birds sold me this camera.\n\n**Carlos:** The fuck you mean though?\n\n**Randall:** I was eating lunch with Daniele over there. //[Randall points around the camera toward a pavilion in the distance]// and a fuckin' goose came up offering to sell us an iPhone, and I didn–\n\n**Carlos:** How's a goose offering you shit, bro? You trippin'.\n\n**Randall:** 'Ight, bet. You'll see when we get there. \n\n**Carlos:** Yeah, I'll see you're dumb as fuck.\n\n**Randall:** Over here, this way.\n\n//[The two men walk through tall underbrush and several trees until they reach a small clearing.]//\n\n**Randall:** //[Speaking loudly.]// Hey man, it's uh, it's me again. I brought my boy to come see you.\n\n**Unknown:** Check em!\n\n//[Several dozen squirrels emerge from the treeline and encircle Carlos and Randall.]//\n\n**Carlos:** The fuck man, what are the– back the fuck up!\n\n**Randall:** It's cool, they're just checkin' us out.\n\n//[The squirrels can be seen running over the two men and checking their pockets, waistbands, and ankles. After removing a pocket knife from Carlos's left sock, the squirrels retreat back into the trees.]//\n\n**Carlos:** On some real shit– did I just get robbed by a bunch of squirrels?\n\n**Randall:** I don–\n\n**SCP-5106:** Don't worry, they'll give it back when we're done with our transaction.\n\n//[SCP-5106 is seen entering the clearing encircled by eight Canadian geese.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** How can we help you, boys?\n\n//[Several of the geese honk in the two men's direction. Carlos is visible confused.]//\n\n**Carlos:** I, uh– I...\n\n**Randall:** Yeah we wanted to do some business with you, ma– you got a name bro?\n\n**SCP-5106:** Yeah, I got one. But you can call me Don, kid.\n\n**Carlos:** My man, what was in the blunt before, this goose just– Is this for real?\n\n**SCP-5106:** Oh we got wise guy, huh? //Your boy// is eyein' me hard– he better quit gawkin' before //my// boys get squawkin'.\n\n//[Several of the geese flap their wings and honk in response]//\n\n**Randall:** Nah Don, we cool– right C.\n\n//[Randall nudges Carlos.]//\n\n**Carlos:** Uh– yeah, we good.\n\n//[SCP-5106 and its accompanying geese walk several meters closer to the two men.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** We've been here too long, what do you want?\n\n**Randall:** My boy needs a new phone.\n\n//[SCP-5106 extends its neck towards Carlos and inspects him.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** Android or iPhone?\n\n**Carlos:** Uh– Android.\n\n//[SCP-5106 turns its head toward Randall.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** You got the bread?\n\n//[Randall holds a stuffed manila envelope toward SCP-5106.]//\n\n**Randall:** Five big ones, just like you said.\n\n**Carlos:** 500? Bro, that's a lot of doe, wher–\n\n**Randall:** Don't worry man, Ma gave it to me.\n\n**SCP-5106:** Flaps, go get it.\n\n//[One of the geese flies into the treeline. It returns approximately one minute later carrying a plastic shopping bag in its beak.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** Galaxy S20. \n\n//[The goose drops the plastic bag at Carlos's feet before waddling back to SCP-5106.]//\n\n**Carlos:** Yeah, okay.\n\n//[Randall makes an exaggerated coughing noise.]//\n\n**Carlos:** I mean– good looks man, thanks.\n\n**SCP-5106:** Yeah, just pay up and scram– we've wasted enough time on you already.\n\n//[Randall opens the envelope revealing five slices of marble rye bread; he gently removes them from the envelope. Randall rips the bread into small chunks and spreads them on the ground. SCP-5106 and the other geese honk and flap their wings; in unison, they swarm and consume the bread pieces. After finishing the bread, SCP-5106 and its geese fly away.]//\n\n**Carlos:** That– that was some, I don't ev– who the fuck's gonna believe this shit.\n\n//[Randall shakes the camera towards Carlos.]//\n\n**Randall:** Everyone, man, I got that shit on here.\n\n//[The two men walk out of the clearing and back through the underbrush.]// \n\n**Carlos:** Yeah but, even on film, I don't know if I'd believe that shit– and I was there, man.\n\n**Randall:** Yeah, we'll see.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nFollowing a brief investigation to confirm anomalous activity, the Foundation deployed a two-man detachment of MTF Victor-17 with a five-member avian pursuit team as support. The following is a transcript of their encounter:\n\n[[collapsible show=\"❏ Video Log 5106/2 ❏\" hide=\"❐ Video Log 5106/2 ❐\"]]\n**Date:** 2020/08/18 \n\n**Depicted:** Agent Lazzo Finch, Agent Dillon Crane, Site-51 Avian Unit 3\n\n**Foreword:** The agents set a live animal trap rigged with rye bread within the clearing SCP-5106 was previously encountered in. Finch and Crane are to remain hidden in the tree line for SCP-5106 to appear, at which time it will be tranquilized. Avian Unit 3 will remain on standby within the treetop and will pursue SCP-5106 if it attempts to escape.\n------\n**[BEGIN LOG]**\n\n//[Agents Finch and Crane are crouched in the underbrush facing towards SCP-5106's clearing.]//\n\n**Finch:** How long is this gonna take? Do you think they're on to us, Crane?\n\n**Crane:** No, I don't think so, the bird unit hasn't noted any movement.\n\n**Finch:** Maybe they're off trying to sell people stolen junk.\n\n//[Both agents laugh.]//\n\n**Crane:** What a fuckin job. \n\n**Finch:** You can say that again. Shit, this is probably one of the least weird cases we've had in months.\n\n**Crane:** Yeah, I know– \n\n**Finch:** Shhh. Look, over there.\n\n//[Finch points towards the western end of the clearing, movement can be seen in the underbrush. A total of 14 geese exit the tree line and enter the clearing.]//\n\n**Crane:** That trap isn't holding all of them. How many tranq rounds do we have?\n\n**Finch:** Five.\n\n**Crane:** Shit, run back to the truck, grab another case of rounds. And be quick about it, we don't want them getting spooked.\n\n**Finch:** You got it.\n\n//[Finch crawls through the brush for several meters before standing and running towards the truck.]//\n\n**Finch:** Just cause he's old as shit I gotta do the grunt work–\n\n//[Agent Finch stops several meters from the truck, the back doors are open and a large quantity of geese footprints can be seen on the ground. Finch quickly sprints to the back end of the truck and looks inside.]//\n\n**Finch:** //[Over radio.]// Uh, Crane, we got a problem.\n\n//[The truck previously filled with various equipment is now empty; the five parrots composing Avian Unit 3 are unconscious and bound together with vines.]//\n\n**Crane:** //[Over radio.]// Hurry up, I think they're on to us.\n\n**Finch:** //[Over radio.]// Avian Unit 3 is down, and I– I think we've been robbed. \n\n//[Finch unties the unconscious parrots.]//\n\n**Crane:** //[Over radio.]// What?\n\n**Finch:** //[Over radio.]// All of our equipment is gone!\n\n**Crane:** //[Over radio.]// Those little fucks! Get back here.\n\n**Finch:** //[Over radio.]// Coming.\n\n**Crane:** //[Over radio.]// I'm sending a backup request to command.\n\n//[Agent Finch sprints back to Crane.]//\n\n**Finch** What's the plan?\n\n**Crane:** We don't even know if one of them is the one we need. If we scare them off we won't have a pursuit team.\n\n**Finch:** Why don't one of us wait here and the other go out there and try talking to them? If one of them answers we shoot that one with the tranq.\n\n**Crane:** Since backup is 40 minutes out, it's worth a shot.\n\n**Finch:** OK, take this.\n\n//[Agent Finch hands Crane the tranquilizer rifle. Finch stands and walks into the clearing.]//\n\n**Finch:** Okay, guys, looks like we got off on the wrong foot, how about we just talk this out?\n\n//[The geese immediately face Finch and begin to honk.]//\n\n**Finch:** I know at least one of you can talk– let's just work this out.\n\n**SCP-5106:** I think this has worked out just fine for us.\n\n**Crane:** Finch, I can't tell which one is talking– you gotta get it to step out of the group.\n\n**Finch:** As far as I can tell you're a business ma– goose, so let's do business.\n\n//[One of the geese steps from the group, a black rectangular object can be seen on its back.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** Okay then, let's make a de–\n\n//[Crane fires two tranquilizer rounds into the goose after several seconds of stumbling the goose falls to the ground. The remaining geese fly away in response.]//\n\n**Crane:** Got it.\n\n//[Crane exits the treeline and the two Agents approach the fallen goose.]//\n\n**SCP-5106:** Only thing you got was played! //[Various honks can be heard in the background.]//\n\n**Finch:** What the fuck...\n\n//[Finch pushes the goose over revealing a Foundation issued handheld radio attached to its back. Honking can be heard from above. The two Agents look up in time to see a Foundation issue electrified capture net falling on them.]//\n\n**Crane:** Ah shit.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n------\n[[/collapsible]]\n\nContainment Team Alpha 4 arrived within a half-hour; the two MTF Victor-17 agents were discovered unconscious within the clearing. The entirety of Cattus Island State Park's Goose population, as well as SCP-5106, could no longer be located. The tracking devices within the stolen Foundation equipment were found in a trashcan within the park. The Foundation Parazoology Division is currently formulating possible migration patterns for SCP-5106 and its flock.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5105]]] | SCP-5106 | [[[SCP-5107]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
