We just kinda throw words at you. Basically, Site-58 is the place all the anomalies capable of thinking and communicating //politely// go. Doesn't matter how outwardly horrifying or gross they are.

You're so brilliant and smart, can you tell me why we're dumping all these guys in one spot?\" Well first, thank you I know I am. Second! Site-58 is the home of the Department of Anomalous Ambassadorship. They're a group of trained agents and researchers hand picked for their skills in diplomatic communication. The idea is that since these anomalies are willing to work with us, or at the very least //talk// to us, we've got a group willing to work and talk with them in return. Clever, huh?\n\n[[=]]\n[[div]]\n[[image Screamy1.png width=\"75px\" style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nSo I'll be honest with you, since you're on our team now. This isn't all just done out of the kindness of their hearts. Our goal at 58 is, at the end of the day, to cut containment costs where possible. Anomalies that are kept happy (within reason!) are less likely to breach containment. That means less money spent on cleaning up damages.\n\n[[=]]\n[[div]]\n[[image Screamy10.png width=\"75px\" style=\"margin-left: 20px;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWe've been working pretty hard with the Integration Committee as well.

The site's development and mission statement became the pet project of [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6404 Talla████ ██████], otherwise recognized as O5-5. Nanticoke, Pennsylvania was chosen due to the town's existing familiarity with the anomalouse, with a myriad of local myths and legends permeating public consciousness. This general pre-existing awareness of the anomalous would make disinformation campaigns in the event of a breach easier to perform.\n\nOn August 31st, 1990, several low-risk humanoid and zoological anomalies were formally transferred to Site-58's custody. Site-58 began its work in earnest, though at this point it was more in line with traditional Foundation modus operandi at this point. While 58 was notably easier on contained anomalies, it still more closely resembled a prison than thee site we see today.\n\nOn September 17th, 2006, the site saw a large-scale containment breach. While there were minimal fatalities, the breach did result in a partial veil lift for the town of Nanticoke. Then director O5-5 was forced to re-evaluate the site's primary goals, which set the Foundations for the Site-58 we see today. Two new directives were established-\n\n1. Site-58 would aim for as humane of a treatment of contained anomalies as possible, communicating with them directly to see to it that their needs are met within reason.\n\n2. Part of Site-58 would become publicly accessible in an effort to eventually eliminate the need to contain low-risk anomalies at all.\n\n3. Site-58 would be the point of relation and diplomacy between the Foundation and diefic anomalies originating from the Dreamscape.\n\nWhile actively reducing security efforts were seen as insane by the majority of Foundation personnel, a test run of these new initiatives proved successful. Since these initiatives began, Site-58 has seen exactly three containment breaches in total, all related to zoological anomalies. The team that formed to communicate with anomalies to determine their individual needs would eventually go on to become the Department of Anomalous Ambassadors on January 1st, 2012.\n\nFollowing the untimely death of O5-5 on October 4th, 2007, a new Site Director was assigned. Dir. Scarborough would continue with O5-5's initial vision for Site-58, and went forth to also establish the remaining departments we have in our modern day. He also started the Foundation Diversity Initiative, an initiative that specifically seeks out employees from minority and marginalized backgrounds in order to encourage a diversity of thoughts, perspectives, and lived experiences on site.

There you are!\"\n\nA terse, older woman with graying brown hair and sharp frown lines approaches your desk. Her movements are careful and precise, carrying a certain level of stern poise. She adjusts the glasses on her face before speaking again.\n\n\"My apologies. You're the new hire, correct? My name is Dr. Parker, I'm the head of the Artificial Intelligence Department. I've been hunting for that .aic there on your screen for a few hours now.\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #404040; padding:5px; margin: 10px; background:#f4f4f4;\"]]\n[[=]]\nH-hi, mom-\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[image Screamy10.png width=\"130px\" style=\"margin-right: 20px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\"Do NOT 'hi mom' me, Screamy!\" Dr. Parker snaps at the icon on your screen, \"You do realize you are by definition breaching containment at this moment, correct? The only .aic that should be on this computer is Rosetta, who politely informed me that the network to this wing has been down and she can't deliver the dossier. Care to explain why that is?\"\n\nYou sink into your chair, fruitlessly trying to escape the feeling that you're caught in the middle of family drama. At some point, Dr. Parker pushes you aside to access the computer. She practically screeches when she sees the documents on screen.\n\n\"What in the HELL is this, Screamy?!\"\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #404040; padding:5px; margin: 10px; background:#f4f4f4;\"]]\n[[=]]\nThe... site dossier?\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[image Screamy10.png width=\"130px\" style=\"margin-right: 20px;\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\nScreamy's response is tinged with anxiety, but something about its tone read as sincere.\n\n\"The... Screamy this is a //mess//! Spelling errors, incorrect information... I mean you listed the Vice Chairman of the Department of Practical Debunking as 'that guy who leaves the door to the IT room open and lets the rats in.' It's missing a floor plan!

Screamy lets out a small \"eep!\" before vanishing, taking all of the documentation with it. Dr. Parker sighs and pinches the bridge of her nose, sitting on the edge of your desk.\n\n\"Sorry about that. Screamy really tries its best to be helpful, but unfortunately doesn't seem to have much of an idea of what 'helpful' actually means. I'll get the network back up and send Rosetta your way in a few minutes. Thanks for your patience.\"\n\nShe rises to her feet and struts off before you can say a word. You look back to your computer, now completely empty of Screamy and its documents. Leaning back in your chair, you turn your gaze to the ceiling above.\n\nWhat an odd little group. You turn around and take a proper look at your surroundings. They weren't anything unfamiliar, this section of the building resembling a corporate office pretty faithfully down to the water-stained ceiling tiles. It was plain, mundane-\n\nYour thoughts are quickly interrupted as a tall horned man rushes by. He flashes you a quick, toothy smile and accidentally drops the [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6968 horned hare] he previously held. The creature runs off, and the man lets out a small yelp.\n\n\"No, NO! THAT'S WHERE THE FEMALES ARE!\" he shouts as he continues the chase, nearly running down two other people who jump to the side as he passes. Another person is less lucky, the rabbit darting between their legs and the horned man colliding with them face first, knocking them both to the ground. What appears to be a [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6059 plastic ball pit ball] rolls from the person's hand over to your seat. You pick it up before immediately throwing it back down, the smell of stale vomit hitting your nose.\n\nOnce your coworkers find their feet again, the horned man continues his chase. The other person walks over, picking the ball up off the floor. They notice the disgusted look on your face and laugh.\n\n\"Trust me, you get used to it after they've hit you in the face a few... hundred times.\"\n\nThey walk off, gently tossing the ball in the air as they go.\n\nThere's a small ding from your desktop that catches your attention, and you turn around. A new icon is visible on your screen, this time a young woman, and it gives you a gentle smile.\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 10px #264a56; padding:5px; margin: 10px; background:#f4f4f4;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\nHi there!
