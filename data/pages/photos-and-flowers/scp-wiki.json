Your nature \nbetrays you, child of Lilith; your,\nprogenitor, her vengeance, lives on \nin you. You are as she was-- \nuntamed, more creature than person;\nyou're nothing more than an infernal offspring \nof the mother of monsters. \nHow do you believe you can be anything else?\n[[/>]]\n\nI am a child of the earth, \nborn from the bones of the mother I have  \nmet only in dreams, and in the image\nof a distant father, whose words do little to\nfill the aching silence. I know only in memories \nthe warmth of a hug, and the calloused \ntopography of a hand \nnever quite ready to let go. \nI know only in the leaves the sussurating aria\nof the one to whom I bear resemblance.\nForgotten is her melody; wrapped in crimson \nwho is left to sing for her? \n\n[[>]]\nThe hands of the father are stained \nin blood, but they are not so \ndissimilar to the ones that are meant \nto care for you.\n[[/>]]\n\nMy body is nothing more than the \nstorybook reinterpretations of ancestors past,\nor burdened by the perceptions of those \nperceiving me. Their eyes trace the\nmuddled mixture that always labels me either\n'monster' or 'man'; their hands treat me as the latter. \nThere is little of me left untouched by \ngloved hands. Sedated, despite protestation,\nthey prod and grab and grope, taking vial and measurement,\njabbing me with the medicine I so desperately wish to \nbe the cure. Only wildfire patches of hives and \nthe phantom sensation of touch remains. \n\n[[>]]\nAnd what of eyes? \nYou are an oddity, black sheep by birth;\nyour flock is elsewhere, //child//, and \nstill you remain. What fulfillment is there in a \nlife like yours? \n[[/>]]\n\nTo be seen is to be realized, acknowledged;\nI wish so dearly for no one to acknowledge me. \nEyes are inescapable, windows to the thoughts\nand minds of their owners. \nA deer's eyes are nervous, \npeering through grass and trees for the hungry wolf. \nTo be seen is to be hunted. \nThe wolf's eyes are focused, vigilantly glaring at its prey.\nI know intimately what it means to be hunted. \nA Shadow grows eyes within the cattails and reeds,\nbeckoning me like a siren to the water so I may perceive myself. \nElsewhere, I feel the analytical eyes that separate me into my\ncomponent parts, pieced together and deconstructed, or\nthe well-meaning glances of those //just like me//\nthat are always just out of reach. \nTheir gazes feel as though thorns are being driven into me,\nwaiting for me to falter before delivering the killing blow. \n\n[[>]]\nBut you cannot die. \nYou lack ephemerality; you are a\nuniversal constant, a spoke supporting a shattered \nwheel that has broken lovers and martyrs \nmuch stronger than you. \n[[/>]]\n\nI am weak, skin over tattered bones,\nribs visible, buttressing the chest where \nmy heart beats and beats and beats; \nsometimes the only reminder I am still alive.\nI am the living embodiment of life and death, \na timeless thing, standing like a willow in a storm. \nMy hands bring both bloom and decay,\nthough I am at once both and neither. \nFear runs through me as blood does, and \npulsing adrenaline feels diminished in its returns; \namplified brings about numbness, numbness fades into nothingness.\nI am not strong, but I am \ngenerations of hopes and dreams, the slow\nerosion of the river bank, rushing rapids \nthat threaten to drag me under so that one day,\nsomeone, may break the cycle. \nI hope to sit by the oxbow then, maybe with a book,\nor with someone I love, and watch life begin anew. \n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n++ Photos and Flowers\n+++ [[size 50%]]by SynthPanda_[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n\nOn a cork-board in my mind are pinned photos,\nmemories\nin a vinyl sheen,\nwhich dance and change as your warm hand inches closer,\nentangling,\nwith my fingers.\nThe shapes flicker, but do not change,\nthe meaning moves to the drum of your heartbeat\non my chest.\n\nI remember walking with you on an evening in\nAugust.\nIn the humid air,\nwe forgot the tragedy of our births, if only for that\nmoment.\nYou pulled a flower\nfrom the earth, and smelling it, said its fragrant beauty\nwas much like mine, you smiled like a woman gone wild,\nan idiot in love.\n\nI laugh, my chest heaved, I picked you up, and stared into\neyes,\nbrown and vibrant,\nfull of unrepentant love for me, creases from smiling,\nbeautiful,\nas all of you is.\nI love you, even though you do not believe you are pretty.\nEven then, I wanted nothing more than to have you here,\nasleep in my arms.\n\nYou breath softly as you sleep, I run my hands through your\nhair,\nholding you,\nyou are safe.
