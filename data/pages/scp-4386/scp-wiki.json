This includes the town of ███████, where undercover Foundation operatives are tasked with identifying local civilians that raise suspicions about Foundation activity in the region. Any civilians suspected of attempting to investigate Foundation activity will be apprehended and administered a Class C amnestic following standard interrogation procedures. \n\nThe single entrance to SCP-4386 located at the western extreme of ███████ is surrounded by a chain-link fence and is guarded by at least four security personnel at all times. Any civilians seen approaching the area will be lead off-site by at least two security personnel and exposed to Cover Story #601-A[[footnote]]See standard issue //The Advanced Cover Story Guidebook by T.M. Williams// for further information.[[/footnote]].\n\nThe main power supply for SCP-4386 should be checked for signs of degradation every 2 hours and at least 2 backup power generators will be on standby at all times. Significant fluctuations in the local power grid are to be logged daily and cross-referenced with SCP-4386-01's recorded input readings.\n\nSCP-4386-02 through 05 are to be under constant observation. Any dissociative disorders or suicidal tendencies recognised in SCP-4386-02 through 05 are to be reported immediately, and psychological countermeasures should be employed to ensure none are able to cause any significant self-harm.\n\nThe simulation hosted on SCP-4386-01 is to be policed by the assigned CyTF, and all instances of VSCP-01 are to be removed from the simulation on sight, excluding instances directly in the vicinity of SCP-4386-02 through 05.\n\n**Description:** SCP-4386 consists of six separate but interlinked components contained within a large man-made cavern hidden 500m beneath an abandoned farm on the edge of a rural town known as ███████, UK. \n\nThe six components are as follows:\n* **SCP-4386-01:** A network of 55 interlinked computer and medical systems consisting of:\n * 1 single cylindrical relay station that dominates the center of the cavern, measuring 15.3m in height, and 7.1m in diameter.\n *  46 interconnected parallel data processing units of custom design, connecting into the relay station. Each provides a terminal to allow interaction with the entire SCP-4386-01 array.\n * 8 sub-stations that resemble standard operating tables, surrounding the relay station. Each is connected to the relay station by numerous cables, tubes and intravenous devices set in place to supply necessary nutrition and nourishment to any humans residing on the sub-station tables. As of 20██-09-01, SCP-4386-02 through 05 currently occupy 4 of the sub-stations. The remaining 4 are unoccupied.\n\n* **SCP-4386-02:** A biologically male human, estimated to be ██ years old. Currently resides on the 1st sub-station of SCP-4386-01.\n\n* **SCP-4386-03:** A biologically male human, estimated to be ██ years old. Currently resides on the 3rd sub-station of SCP-4386-01.\n\n* **SCP-4386-04:** A biologically female human, estimated to be ██ years old. Currently resides on the 4th sub-station of SCP-4386-01.\n\n* **SCP-4386-05:** A biologically female human, estimated to be ██ years old. Currently resides on the 8th sub-station of SCP-4386-01.\n\n* **SCP-4386-06:** A bulbous metallic mass that resides on top of the relay station section of SCP-4386-01. It measures 8m in diameter and 4m in height. Printed on its side is the phrase \"BIG-B.A.D.\" (see SCP-4386-01 Retrieved Documents - bigbadintro.txt). The internal mechanism of SCP-4386-06 is still unknown.\n\nSCP-4386-02 through 05 are currently unconscious relative to the physical world, and instead, have their consciousness manifesting within an accurate simulation of modern Earth hosted by SCP-4386-01. The simulation has shown to follow the exact same event cycles present in the physical world. As events occur in reality, they subsequently occur within the simulation following an average delay of 23 hours. SCP-4386-02 through 05 are unaware that their observed world is a simulation.\n\nCurrently, only two known significant differences exist between reality and the simulation. They are as follows:\n# The complete lack of anomalous entities, including the presence of the SCP Foundation and other known GoIs. \n# The presence of virtual species VSCP-01, known in-simulation as the \"bee\"[[footnote]]VSCP-01 is not considered an anomalous entity in-simulation.[[/footnote]].\n\nAnalysis of non-simulation data located within SCP-4386-01's databanks has revealed that the intended mechanism of SCP-4386-06 poses a substantial threat to humanity and standard reality laws. Gathered data indicates that should SCP-4386-02 through 05 be awoken simultaneously, SCP-4386-06 will begin its activation cycle, leading to a complete CK-Class Reality Restructuring scenario and at worst, a ZK-Class Reality Failure event. However, as long as at least one of SCP-4386-02 through 05 is connected and present within the simulation, SCP-4386-06 will remain inactive.  \n  \nSo far, no means to deactivate SCP-4386-06 safely have been discovered.\n\n**SCP-4386-01 Terminal Access:** On 2003-11-13, the Foundation Security Penetration team managed to successfully obtain root access to SCP-4386-01's operating system and establish administrator privileges. Accounts have since been distributed to various Foundation researchers holding adequate clearance levels. Terminal access may be permitted to Level 3 and above personnel only. To apply for an account on the system, please contact the project director, Dr. Harsky.\n\n**SCP-4386-01 Retrieved Documents:** Since establishing access to the SCP-4386-01's database via the terminals, the following public files have been discovered:\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open /public/bigbadintro.txt\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\n[[div class=\"terminalBlock\"]]\n[[span]]@<> ##################################>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> ##### The BIG-B.A.D.

We are involving ourselves in things that could surpass whatever deity you may or may not believe in! To ensure we don't accidentally destroy the planet, or turn all of reality into a giant carton of milk, the following guide will walk you through all the safety procedures required when working on the BIG-B.A.D. project.>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> ##### Candidate Safety #####>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> YOU MUST NOT WAKE UP THE CANDIDATES!![[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> The Candidates will wake up naturally when the Simulation is complete. In the event that all eight of the candidates are awake, the BIG-B.A.D. is designed to interpret this as a final and lasting representation of an ideal reality and will activate with the variables currently held at the time the last candidate awakens.[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> Should all of the Candidates wake up prematurely by any means, the BIG-B.A.D. will form a Brane collision with the incorrect setting and what it creates will most likely be an unstable mass of primordial goop where space and time are less than a memory.[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> So whatever you do, do not do anything that might wake up the candidates! They will do so themselves when it is time to wake up.[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> In the event that the candidates do manage to awaken prematurely, we would advise first attempting to come to terms with the consequences of your failure, followed by the remembrance of an old Better Earth mantra: \"Better to have No Earth than to have This Earth!\"[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> ##### Simulation Safety #####>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> When tailoring the Simulation, you may feel the urge to make the Candidates as happy as possible. Despite how it may seem, this is the exact opposite of what is required!>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> In the event a Candidate is happy, they will not seek further happiness and will become ignorant to the plight of their fellow human beings. For this reason, the Simulation should always ensure the Candidate is in a state of longing for happiness at least 60% of the time.>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> While this may seem cruel, we must keep in mind that the mental suffering of these eight Candidates is what pushes them to dream and long for a perfect world, a dream from which we can then extrapolate the required reality we wish to create!>@[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> In the event that a Candidate achieves a height of happiness that causes them to long for nothing, we run risking their mind outright rejecting the simulation, which could potentially lead them to awaken prematurely.[[/span]]\n[[span]]@<> >@[[/span]]\n[[span]]> But don't worry too much about it! Such a situation is considered so dangerous that the Simulation actually has a safeguard system in place to ensure this never happens: The Mood Dampener Module.

The remaining 2 expired between mid-2001 and early-2003.\n\nUpon initial discovery, 5 persons, now designated SCP-4386-02 through 05 and 1 additional (see file Dissociation Event 01) were connected to SCP-4386-01 via 5 of the 8 sub-stations. 3 other bodies amongst the 32 deceased are believed to have previously been connected to the remaining vacant sub-stations, having become disconnected following events that lead to the demise of the cavern's total population. All 3 had died due to severe brain hemorrhages.\n\n**GoI-809/4386 Employee Logs:** Following the successful gain of administrative privileges on the SCP-4386-01 network, GoI-809 user profile security was overridden, allowing access to various personal logs of former GoI-809 personnel.

Check it out yourselves, search for \"B_letter_english\" in the Entity Evolutionary Event Log from 2000. The Entity Evolution Simulation module has written an entire history for an insect species called \"B\", spanning back 120 million years, including an era where humans simply started spelling the creature's name as \"bee\". It's insane how much it has written for it, there's a whole load of branching species, superstitions, and everything. The people who wrote this module were really dedicated, that's for sure.\n> \n> To be honest, these \"bee\" things seem pretty innocent. They're like slightly less intimidating wasps. So ultimately, they're not really a threat to normalcy in the simulation, but since the file was originally written to be //the concept of the letter 'B'// and not a bloody //insect//, I figure it's making them act in some peculiar ways the candidates are picking up on that we haven't noticed yet.\n> \n> So I don't suppose we can just remove it now, can we?
