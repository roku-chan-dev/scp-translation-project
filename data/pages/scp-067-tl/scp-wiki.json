The wood that makes up the object is identified as //beechwood//.\n\nSCP-067-TL's anomalous properties manifest when playing with it; where subjects who fail to catch the ball with the string unto the wooden spike and the ball deviates either to the right or left, results in a one-centimeter shift to the planet's axis in accordance to the direction the ball goes. The mechanisms on how the object is capable of altering the planetary axis remains undetermined, and additional research into the object's other possible anomalies are pending for approval.\n\nExperimentation has revealed that anomalous properties do not manifest under specific conditions, including intentionally throwing the ball to the left or right, improperly handling the ball or string, and that the object is dependent on the playing with it correctly for the object's anomalous effects to occur.\n\nThe appropriate classification of this anomaly is currently under discussion. Until directives are issued by the overseeing Site Director of Site-██, the anomaly will retain its classification as a \"Safe-class\" anomaly.\n\nExperiments conducted on SCP-067-TL are detailed below.\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nSCP-067-TL Test\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nPersonnel\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-5423\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProtocol\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nInstructed to play with SCP-067-TL for a duration of three minutes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nResult\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nPlanetary axis shifts by one centimeter in the direction corresponding to the side where the toy ball goes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\nNote: The shifts in planetary axis is dependent on playing with the object, it is capable of moving the planet and is what makes it dangerous.\n\n[[table  style=\"border-collapse:collapse; max-width: 600px;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold;padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver; width: 20%;\"]]\nSCP-067-TL Test\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"font-weight:bold; padding: .3em .7em; text-align: center; border: 1px solid black; background-color: silver;\"]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nPersonnel\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-243\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; padding: .3em .7em; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nProtocol\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nInstructed to play with SCP-067-TL in an incorrect manner for a duration of five minutes.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; border: 1px solid black\"]]\nResult\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 1px solid black; padding: .3em .7em;\"]]\nD-243 played with SCP-067-TL incorrectly as instructed, no alterations to the planet's axis were observed.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\nNote: Movement of the axis is dependent on correctly playing with the anomaly. No further experiments will be conducted with this object due to uncertainty regarding potential effects to our planet. - Dr. Cardo Dalisay\n\n**Addendum 1:** At present, this anomaly will remain unused until authorization is granted by the Site Director. The object's properties pose a significant risk as they have the potential to disrupt the balance of our planet. Just simply playing with this object has the capacity to destabilize the planetary balance. - Dr. Butobakal\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-066-TL]]] | SCP-067-TL| [[[SCP-068-TL]]] >>\n[[/=]]",
