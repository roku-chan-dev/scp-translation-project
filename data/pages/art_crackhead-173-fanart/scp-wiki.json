After about two decades, the image has finally been removed. Hats off to Izumi Kato — the creator behind Untitled 2004 — for letting the photo stay up for so long in the first place.\n\nI rarely draw anything humanoid 'cause I'm shit at the anatomy, but I think it's at least decent. This may be influenced by other designs I've seen on the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/peanut-gallery big gallery,] but regardless, I'm proud of what I drew. Pretty snazzy.\n\nLove how the community banded together to wave goodbye to the iconic snapper and even organized an artist event to challenge their creativity. Seriously, great artwork, everyone. And hey, with that said, I might as well see it off too. Call this post another commemoration.\n\nSee you, peanut. Have fun in neck-snapping heaven!\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ //Farewell, Peanut!
