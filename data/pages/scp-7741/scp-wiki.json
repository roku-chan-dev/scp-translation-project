Taken by Foundation Beechcraft Model 50 Twin Bonanza pilot shortly before being shot down. May 1st, 1962]]\n----\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Documentation from Pentagram[[footnote]] Codename for the United States Paranatural Warfare Command, the occult combatant command of the Department of Defense[[/footnote]] sources indicate that ionizing radiation such as that originating from nuclear weapons, X-ray emitting devices and radioactive waste is the only effective means of subduing SCP-7741 for prolonged periods. Reconnaissance imagery suggests that the United States has made extensive use of all three methods. The Foundation’s efforts to secure and contain SCP-7741 for research have been violently and consistently hindered by United States military assets in the Pacific region. \n\n--The Foundation will continue efforts to conduct aerial reconnaissance of the Runit Dome, and will explore the potential of deploying a ground team via submarine for collection of soil samples.-- Due to the potential for extensive loss of materials and personnel, direct containment efforts have been halted as of August 16th, 1964. \n\nStationary Task Force Columbia-1 “Novus Ordo”[[footnote]] A Stationary Task Force charged with monitoring electronic and signal intelligence on US Government devices, primarily in and around Washington D.C.[[/footnote]] will continue to monitor US Government devices to collect electronics intelligence (ELINT), imagery intelligence (IMINT) and signals intelligence (SIGINT) potentially referring to SCP-7741 from their safehouse in Fairfax, Virginia\n----\n**Description:** SCP-7741 refers to the entity currently stored within the Runit Dome, located on the Enewetak Atoll of the Marshall Islands. Foundation aerial reconnaissance after the initial discovery of SCP-7741 has revealed little due to obstruction of imaging systems via smoke, blinding light due to nuclear detonations, and deliberate destruction of reconnaissance aircraft through military means. Imagery and footage that does exist is often grainy, damaged and difficult to analyze.\n\nThe few eyewitness descriptions that exist come from Veil Clearance documents recovered from Pentagram electronic documentation via monitoring and breaching of US Government devices and communications. The eyewitness accounts, cross referenced with the imagery that the Foundation does posses, indicate that SCP-7741 is amphibious, capable of sustained low altitude flight, and resistant to most forms of mundane ballistic weaponry, most especially that from small arms. Analysis of still imagery that the Foundation does possess places SCP-7741 at approximately 76 meters in height, although length and wingspan are currently too difficult to determine based on available imagery and eyewitness account. The body shape and color of SCP-7741 closely resembles that of a Long-Tailed Clawed Salamander (Onychodactylus fischeri).\n\nIt is likely that SCP-7741 remains dormant for extended periods of time once its caloric intake demands are met. Whether SCP-7741 meets its caloric demands via ionizing radiation cannot be corroborated at this time, however, it is currently hypothesized that this is the reason SCP-7741 remains dormant under US Government containment. As of April 3, 1990, no clear imagery or footage of SCP-7741 has been recovered from SCP Foundation aerial reconnaissance or United States Government sources. Efforts to secure a more reliable physical description or image of SCP-7741 are currently ongoing.\n----\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=view.png\n| caption=Image pulled from Pentagram archives, July 1958.\n]]\n**Discovery:** Evidence of the existence of SCP-7741 was discovered on May 13th, 1958, one day after the FIR and BUTTERNUT barge tests during [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Hardtack_I Operation Hardtack I]. The Foundation had been monitoring radio traffic originating from the Pacific Proving Grounds since the start of the nuclear weapons tests on April 28th. Approximately 19 hours after the detonation of FIR and BUTTERNUT, intercepted radio traffic referenced a massive, unidentified creature moving below the surface of the ocean. Shortly after, radio traffic between observers and military personnel on the ground erupted into panic as the creature had “shot out of the goddamn [//sic//] ocean like a missile” according to an unnamed observer. Pentagram documentation indicates military personnel present at the time of its surfacing began engaging SCP-7741 with small arms fire, anti-aircraft weapons and naval artillery for several hours. \n\nAt 0630, shortly following sunrise on May 13th, military personnel engaged SCP-7741 with the KOA nuclear weapon as it made landfall on the island of Dridrilbwij. Pentagram documentation indicates that following the detonation of the 1.37 megaton nuclear weapon, SCP-7741 retreated into the ocean. The detonation of the KOA device had caused the complete destruction of the island. On the morning of May 14th, the Foundation authorized the dispatch of a single, unmarked DHC-3 Otter, purchased from the Indian Air Force and launched from a makeshift airfield in Micronesia. \n\nAt approximately 1330, the crew of the DHC-3 was able to capture a still image of a silhouette under the Pacific Ocean near the coast of the Arno Atoll, as well as several images of US naval vessels staged around SCP-7741. At 1335, the crew of the DHC-3 reported flak detonations near their aircraft. Contact with the aircraft was lost less than one minute following this report.\n\nAt approximately 2130 the same day, May 14th, a recovery team from Mobile Task Force Theta-5 \"The Bigger Boat\" arrived at the estimated crash location to secure the DHC-3’s blackbox, crew and film roll under the guise of a civilian fishing vessel. After one hour, the team was forced to retreat with only the film roll following interdiction by US naval vessels. The after action report of the Theta-5 recovery team, as well as other expedition logs, eyewitness statements, and Pentagram documentation can be found below. Physical copies of all documents are available upon formal request to site RAISA liaison.\n----\n++ Addendum 7741-1\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ After Action Report-05/15/1958\" hide=\"- Collapse\"]]\n\n**The following is a transcript taken from an audio tape. Recorded 05/15/1958**\n\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n**Theta 5 Team Leader - Martin Spencer (MS)**\n**Interviewer - Dr. Albert Lewan (AL)**\n\n> [AL]: Recording has started. This is Doctor Albert Lewan on behalf of the Administration Department. Please state your name and position for the record, sir.\n> \n> [MS]: Martin Spencer, Theta-5 Team Leader. Forgive me if I’m a little slow today, I’m pretty exhausted.\n> \n> [AL]: Mister Spencer, I can understand why you’re likely a little tired after the week you’ve had. Feel free to stop whenever you need a break. Now, if you’re ready, we’ll get started. (Shuffling of papers) Please walk me through what happened when your vessel arrived at the estimated location of the DHC-3 crash.\n> \n> [MS]: Right, well we arrived under the cover of darkness around 9:30 PM. I had my guys practice strict light discipline. Even a lit cigarette would get the Navy all over us for sure.\n> \n> [AL]: I understand you could only actively search the site for an hour, is that correct?\n> \n> [MS]: It is. We’re lucky we even had that much time to search. If you ask me, the American government had completely focused their efforts underwater, waiting for that monster to come back around. They let us listen to the American radio traffic when it first surfaced, you know. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t nervous the entire time I was out there. Real horror movie stuff. I think the Navy was the least of our concerns.\n> \n> [AL]: We’re calling that monster SCP-7741 now. But, anyway, the Navy was the least of your concerns until they eventually found your team poking around.\n> \n> [MS]: Yea, definitely gave us all a shock. Bright spotlight from an H-34 Choctaw shining down on our ship. No doubt they had their guns pointed right at us from behind it.\n> \n> [AL]: Were you fired upon?\n> \n> [MS]: Not initially, no. I think the civilian fishing vessel cover bought us a couple seconds. We weren’t exactly dressed the part, as I’m sure you know. Wearing all that diving gear made us stick out. They fired some warning shots into the water around us. Could’ve laid into us right then and there. I guess either they weren’t too sure who we were or whoever was behind the trigger was feeling merciful.\n> \n> [AL]: Your team was armed, correct? Why not fire back?\n> \n> [MS]: Because it would have been a death sentence. One helicopter would have turned into an entire fleet on top of us. We’re lucky we made it back as is. To be frank, I wasn't going to be the one to spark a flashpoint between us and the States, and I realize the nature of our work transcends ideology and all that, but firing on my own countrymen is a big ask. One of those Marines on that Choctaw could've been my brother or my cousin.\n> \n> [AL]: I understand. Thank you for your time, Mister Spencer. We’ll see about dispatching another team to recover the crew of the DHC-3, I’m sure. You’re free to return to your quarters.\n**END LOG**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n++ Addendum 7741-2\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Recovered Pentagram Documentation\" hide=\"- Collapse\"]]\n**The following document is a Close Air Support Summary obtained from Department of Defense Occult archives by STF Columbia-1 \"Novus Ordo\"**\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n> \n> __**VEIL CLEARANCE REQUIRED TO VIEW**__\n> -----\n> United States Marine Corps\n> \n> CASSUM\n> \n> - 19580514 || 2230\n> - One[1] H-34 \"Choctaw\"\n> - One[1] fishing vessel spotted idling just beyond Danger Zone and Restricted Area perimeter\n> \n> - Additional Notes: Aircraft crew chief observed crew aboard fishing vessel operating underwater retrieval and diving equipment.

McElroy (Secretary of Defense)\n> \n> FROM: Justin Sullivan (Chief, Naval Operations for PARAWARCOM)\n> \n> SUBJECT: Recovery of downed aircraft near the Marshall Islands\n> \n> Secretary McElroy,\n> \n> Concerning the situation in the Marshall Islands, we have recovered the aircraft shot down by our  anti-air defenses yesterday. Last night at approximately 2230, a United States Marine Corps helicopter chased away a fishing vessel snooping around in the area where the aircraft was recovered. Alongside the badly damaged DHC-3, we have recovered two bodies that have yet to be identified, water damaged maps, and a black box flight recorder. This was not, as we had initially thought, a Soviet attempt at reconnoitering our nuclear test site as initially believed.\n> \n> The black box is still being analyzed on site, and will be sent back to Washington soon, but what we have already recovered indicates that this aircraft likely belonged to the SCP Foundation. The vessel encountered by our Marines last night was likely a recovery team. Luckily, we beat them to the punch. Twenty years ago, I would have advocated that we send the bodies back to them with a lengthy apology. After what happened at Woodvale, I'd argue that we send the bodies back piece by piece.\n> \n> I am formally recommending that we continue to pull personnel from JTF-7[[footnote]] JTF-7 was collaboration between the US military and federal civilian employees from the Department of Defense and Atomic Energy Commission[[/footnote]] and replace them with our own. If they want to play hardball, maybe we can see about deploying that weapon we used during Inchon.

Despite this, the Foundation will conduct its mission in the region normally, and threats, violence and strong-arming that will more than likely be leveled toward us will not discourage us from performing our mission to secure, contain, and most importantly, protect all humanity, regardless of nationality or political ideology. Our mission transcends these insignificant concepts. Whether you decide to act with us or against us, we will continue our operations regardless of the risk involved.\n> \n> The Foundation is still waiting for the United States to send us the bodies of the air crew mercilessly gunned down in 1958 by your air defenses, without warning or due cause. While the pilot of our Twin Bonanza was returned in 1962, he showed clear signs of physical and mental torture, not to mention an alarming presence of experimental drugs in his system. Until an effort is made to return the bodies and personal effects of these men to the Foundation, or compensate us in some manner for this unacceptable loss of life and equipment, I do not wish to further discuss this topic with you or your people.

We are well aware that responsibility of the Runit Dome is about to be passed off to the Marshall Islands government. Admiral, I'll be frank, you and I both know what is being held in that concrete dome, and it isn't just toxic waste. An island nation with a GDP that doesn't even come close to a single American state is not equipped to handle this responsibility.\n> \n> I implore you to speak to your leaders. The Foundation has the resources and determination to secure and maintain the dome and the creature stored within. I'm sure I don't have to tell you the disaster that awaits us all if a monsoon destroys the dome. We believe it is only a matter of time. Please make the right decision. My predecessors have been less than friendly, and I apologize for disparaging language used in the past.

I've no doubt you've written the Soviets regarding similar matters, with all this talk of Glasnost. Despite my best efforts, Reagan is not going to budge. The United States Navy still feels that monitoring the Runit Dome is in the best interests of national security. Any activity on the island such as armed guards or construction equipment would open a can of worms that nobody in Washington wants. The President has no desire to upset the balance struck by the 1982 Compact. We're still seeking to repatriate many of the natives, and that effort will be shattered if we start digging up skeletons of the past, literally and figuratively. Congress is discussing a payout to the Marshall Islands government. You couldn't have picked a worse time to press for this. \n> \n> On a more positive note, however, Washington has decided to return the bodies of your DHC-3 crew killed in 1958. We will arrange them to be flown to neutral ground where your people can retrieve them. Most of the folks in D.C. would prefer to keep those bodies as some kind of leverage. I know it's not everything you hoped for, but even that took me some convincing. There isn't exactly much sympathy to go around these days, especially when we start talking about the Foundation. Sometimes it feels like a dirty word here in the Pentagon. Your people haven't left the greatest impression since scrambling your assets to non-aligned countries.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> \n> Admiral Michael Lawler\n> Chief of Naval Operations\n> Paranatural Warfare Command\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n> TO: Adm.

Regardless, I can't understand why there's such a vested interest in the dome. What your people have housed within, it's not as if anything is being done to study it or even weaponize it as far as we can tell. If the issue is avoiding causing a stir with the locals, everyone in the White House and the Pentagon is well aware that we can be discreet. \n> \n> I know Reagan won't budge, but we appreciate your attempts nonetheless. Getting our pilots home will go a long way with mending some of the sour opinions about your people around here, whether that was the intent or not. I'd like to say I'll be in touch, but you and I both know it would be a waste of time to press the issue. Maybe one day we can come to an agreement, but I imagine the Soviet's would sooner disarm their nuclear arsenal. Regardless, one can hope.\n> \n> Regards,\n> \n> Melissa Bouras\n> Director\n> DACR\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"darkdocument\"]]\n> TO: Dr. Melissa Bouras (Director, Department of Anomalous Communications and Relations)\n> \n> FROM: Gen.

As you, and the rest of the world are aware, communism has been all but defeated in Germany. For the first time since 1961, the people of Berlin are free to travel as they please. We are well on the way to reunification, and for the first time in a long time, I feel that true peace can be achieved. \n> \n> As such, I would like to revisit the longstanding issue of the Runit Dome that has stood in the way of diplomacy between our organizations for decades, among other things. As I'm sure you understand, the situation on the Marshall Islands is a delicate one. We mustn't upset the fragile state of the Compact of Free Association between the United States and the Republic of the Marshall Islands. In a few weeks the Department of Energy will be present on the Runit Island to collect sediment samples and test radiation levels. I would like scientists from the Foundation to be present alongside the DoE team.\n> \n> There will no doubt be a laundry list of rules and regulations to follow, and I'm sure your people won't be allowed to get too close to the dome itself, but this is at least something to ease the obvious tension between us. The Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union feels like it's finally winding down, if only a little. Let's see if we can work to end the one going on between us.
