Staff are advised to not get their hopes up.\n\n**Description:** SCP-700-J is a plastic bag containing a seemingly unending amount of fortune cookies.[[footnote]]No, holding the bag upside down does //not// work.[[/footnote]] These fortune cookies are entirely mundane and are safe for human consumption. SCP-700-J’s primary anomalous properties are within the slips of paper contained within these fortune cookies. The information described on SCP-700-J’s slips of paper provide 100% accurate descriptions of events in the future. Unfortunately, all of this information is utterly useless and serves absolutely no purpose to any breathing human on the planet. Examples of SCP-700-J instances include:\n\n* “You will buy a new pair of pants.”\n* “You will be hungry again in one hour.”\n* “There will be a containment breach at some point.”\n* “Upon the next conjugation of Jupiter and Saturn, John Wilson will have a cold glass of orange juice.”\n* “This fortune cookie will taste about the same as all the other ones.”\n* “There will be light rain in Chicago on 08/07/2325.”[[footnote]]Awaiting confirmation.[[/footnote]]\n \n\nA poll in [REDACTED] confirmed that out of 1,283 staff members surveyed, 98.68% rated the fortune cookies produced by SCP-700-J as “Okay, I guess” or lower. As a result of this and of SCP-700-J’s truly pointless fortunes, using SCP-700-J to cure world hunger has been denied by the O5 Council.\nFurther testing on SCP-700-J is permitted, but is unlikely to lead to anything interesting.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
