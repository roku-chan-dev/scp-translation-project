The Wi-Fi chip within SCP-3604 is to be disabled at all times. Following Incident-3604-1, Foundation Webcrawlers are to monitor private messages of Soundcloud rap musicians with fewer than 100 followers. Access to the entity is restricted to personnel with Level-2 clearance or higher.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3604 is a sapient //Procambarus digueti// [[footnote]] commonly known as a crawfish [[/footnote]] with an ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip located on the interior dorsal side of its shell, near the heart. SCP-3604 possesses the ability to communicate via the Internet using instant messaging programs, online forums, private messaging services, etc. However, it appears to mainly upload recordings of an unidentified male voice (hereby referred to as SCP-3604-1) rapping onto the music publishing website, Soundcloud. Twelve Soundcloud accounts have been confirmed to be associated with SCP-3604, though it primarily uploads recordings under the account 'craydaddy.'\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-3604 was discovered on 14/7/2012 in The Broads National Park in Norfolk County, England when several wildlife researchers noticed a crawfish showing symptoms of //Aphanomyces astaci// infestation[[footnote]] A highly infectious fungus which affects crawfish[[/footnote]]. Upon bringing SCP-3604 to an on-location veterinarian, one of the wildlife researchers noticed that nine emails had been sent to her phone, from an anonymous sender.\n\nAfter receiving the emails, both researchers contacted local authorities who were able to track the IP of the emails back to SCP-3604. Nearby Foundation implants were notified of SCP-3604 and were able to recover it without incident. After recovering SCP-3604 one final email was sent to the researcher, though it was shortly intercepted. All civilians involved were administered Class B amnestics. (See Log of Recovered Emails)\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Log of Recovered Emails\" hide=\"- Close Log of Recovered Emails]]\n\n**Message-3604-1**\n> Yo I seriously got to thank you, you are truly my biggest hero.\n\n**Message-3604-2** \n> Seriously if you want to collab any time at all I will drop everything I'm doing to help. Like I really don't know how else to thank you.\n\n**Message-3604-3**\n> Can you tell my family I'll miss them. They live about a mile upstream, from where you got me. Mom always gets worried about me. She doesn't need to, I know I'll go big one of these days.\n\n**Message-3604-4**\n> I really can't say thank you enough. I hope you'll live a great a life.\n\n**Message-3604-5**\n> I'm sorry for sending another but I was just wondering if you would like to get coffee sometime after this. I know this is a bit soon but you seem like a chill type of girl.\n\n**Message-3604-6** \n> Don't feel obligated to, it's just a small suggestion. You're a great person, I would love to talk some more.\n\n**Message-3604-7**\n> Your shoe's untied be careful. I don't want you to trip.\n\n**Message-3604-8** \n> Hey can you like hold me up a bit higher... I've only ever gotten to see a bird's eye view once... it was pretty.\n\n**Message-3604-9** \n> Though all of this works too. I mean I guess this still is a bird's eye view. You know I think this is some of the most fun I've had in a long time. Thank you.\n\n**Message-3604-10**\n> I guess I'll see you later. Tell me if you ever want to collab. And if you don't, don't worry I won't forget you on my path to stardom. I'm sorry if I ever did anything wrong in these messages.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum-3604-A**\nOn 6/12/2018 Foundation Webcrawlers noted that a Soundcloud account, 'round$huckles', began to upload several raps involving SCP-3604-1 and various aquatic themes. Upon investigation, several chat logs with SCP-3604 were recovered. (See Incident Report-3604-A)\n\n  \n[[collapsible show=\"+ Incident Report-3604-A\" hide=\"- Close Incident Report-3604-A]]\n\n**Foreword:** The following chat logs were recovered from SCP-3604's internal Wi-Fi chip.
