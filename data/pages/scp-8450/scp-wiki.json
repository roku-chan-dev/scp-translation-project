If it's something I do and practice for the rest of my life, it'd be great! But, I'm not even sure if I'll commit to this yet. Alas, I'm going to try.\n\nSo, basically, ##orange|a very close friend of mine## brews his own wine. He's sort've been an awakening for me. Whenever he finishes a batch, he invites me over and we have a drink. I've bought and read a few books on fermentation, and I think I've got this sorted out. Main thing I'd be worried about are preservatives, but I don't think they're that big of an issue.\n\n\n----\n\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|What the fuck is wrong with you?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWhat?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|I talked to Mrs. Golde on the phone.

Do you want to end up alone and dying in your 50's?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo. Of course not.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|Then why won't you give that Golde girl a chance? Mrs. Golde says her daughter is very delightful.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nBecause I haven't even met her before now. Whenever I meet a girl, I want it to be something natural. Not-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\nHenry, ##42a1ff|I want grandchildren.

It comes out to about $50 a month.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|You're forgetting bills, food, and transportation! As opposed to just living on campus and having most of those reduced, if not gone.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI'd rather have the peace of mind of my own house than dorms.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|You're being an idiot!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n##42a1ff|Mom!##\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##42a1ff|You're- If you don't listen to me, you will regret it!

We used to go to school together until he moved, but we've been in contact and found out we're both going to Blackwater.

Love you, ##42a1ff|Mom...##\n[[/<]]\n\n\n----\n\nI was helping my neighbor the other day get his groceries into his kitchen. My idea of home-fermenting came up while we were talking, and I walked away with 3 pounds of blackberries from his daughter's farm. It's going to be a few days before I can start fermenting, but I guess I decided on which flavor it is.\n\n-----\n\n[[<]]\n##turquoise|Davey!##\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\nHenry!\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nJesus, man. It's been so long.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Yeah, it took me all of yesterday and today to get moved in.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHow'd that go?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Eh. It's a lot easier than getting everything packed and moving it into the truck, but still hard work.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI feel you.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|How much more stuff do you have in your car?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nUh, about a box full.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Only that?!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHey, not everyone's some trillionaire who chose to bring every little trinket they own to university.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I wish I could bring everything. There's so much cool shit I wish I remembered to pack.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYou are a lost case, Davey Whittaker.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Well, if you have nothing to unpack then why don't you help me with my stuff?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWell... I do have that //one// box, after all-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Man-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHell yeah, I will.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Thanks.##\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\nSupposedly, this will be pretty easy. I get an equal part of sugar to the berries, a packet of brewers yeast, and 1 and 2/3rds parts of boiling water. Mixed up the sugar, berries, and water in this plastic bucket they sold to me as a \"jug\" and waited for the water to cool down.\n\nIf the water's too hot when you put the yeast in, all of the yeast will die. So I ended up waiting about half an hour to put in the yeast so the whole thing was room temperature. Then, I had to wait //another// 10 minutes for the yeast to bloom before I could mix it all up.\n\nNow, it's just a whole lot of waiting around...\n\n----\n[[=]]\n+ Blackwater University\n++++ Not chosen for financial assistance.\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nHello, Henry. \n\nCongratulations on successfully applying to attend Blackwater University next year!

Batch.\n\nIt's probably closer to 2/3rds, honestly. It doesn't matter. It's still like 1-2 pounds. I'm adding some more water and sugar to it. I'm also going to add another... Half-packet? Something around that - of yeast. Hopefully, I can save it. But, I don't know. I'll just have to see.\n\n----\n\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Welcome back.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHey.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|How was your day?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nPretty good. Had a lecture this morning and was almost late to work.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I mean, they don't really care about that if it's only a few minutes. Do they?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo, no. Not usually, at least. ##orange|Gary## is really relaxed with stuff like that.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|So bad news is that we're out of pasta sauce. The good news is that I'm making us pasta.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI got paid the other day. I can run down to the store and get some.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|We don't need to. But, we do need to focus on saving money.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nSave $2 on a jar of marinara?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|It adds up.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI've been putting in arguably way too many hours at that mill. A few bucks off of my check every week for stuff like that isn't going to hurt.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I know. But,## Henry-\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWhat?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Have you ever considered dorm rooms?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n...\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|...##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Come on-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI'm not going to live in some rowdy-ass dorm room where people keep me up until 6 a.m. with how loud they are.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I can always cover your half.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nDefinitely not!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|-only for a few months. It wouldn't be forever.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI can't do that!\n[[/<]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nAlso, remember ##orange|Gary?##\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Yeah?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nTurns out, he's gay!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|He's gay?!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYeah. Just confessed to me. The strangest thing is - he tried to hide it! Just kept it casual.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|What? Did he say something like \"Oh, hey## Henry. ##turquoise|Over here! Did you move that wood like I asked? By the way, I'm super gay! Also, did you secure it properly?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNothing like that, no. Well, sort of. He just said he had a boyfriend and moved on.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Huh-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIt's really weird. You know - to just hide something like that. I don't know if I-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Actually, think you could get us that sauce?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nMarinara?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Yeah, from the store.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nAre you sure? What about wasting-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I'm sure. I have a $10 bill on the table. Use that.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nAlright. Thanks. See you in a bit.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Bye.##\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\n\nIt's summertime! Which means that hours are going to start to get really, really competitive. I'm not too worried, usually ##de2cc6|Paul## schedules the supervisors decently. But, it still is noticeably less hours. Then you got the stress of the raised sales, training new people, and a bunch more work.\n\nYesterday, I siphoned the blackberry wine from the \"jug\" into a glass bottle for their second fermentation. Well, first I had to strain out all of the berries. But then I was able to siphon it. Once again, I'm left to wait for stuff to start happening.\n\n-----\n[[>]]\nHenry! ##orange|You're on the clock?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYep.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Great! I'm going to put you on the forklift for now. At least, for an hour or so. Might have you cycle around a bit while people go on breaks.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nOkay.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Fermín's going out later to buy snacks for the next week. If you want to request anything.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI think I'll pass.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Make sure they last - we need to still have some of them left over for all of next week.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI will. I think I'm being scheduled around 50 hours next week. I'm motivated enough to leave some behind.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|I'm working 72, here.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI don't even get why ##de2cc6|Paul## is making us do this.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##de2cc6|Paul## ##orange|says it's so the workload is easier for us year-round. I think it's just some promotional crap to get building companies into business with him.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI feel like there are better ways for publicity than doing the buyout every year.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Probably. But, at least the pay is great.## ##de2cc6|Paul## ##orange|gives anyone who works more than 48 hours a $3 an hour raise for the week.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo shit?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|The downside is that whatever time in your shift that isn't a break is spent doing constant labor.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIf I'm being honest, I'll probably start asking for more hours that week.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Why?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWhat?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|What's the point in overworking yourself more than you need to?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI need the money. Don't want college debt to loom over me.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Yeah, I get you. Took me like 10 years to pay mine off. But, trust me, putting in an extra few hours isn't going to help you that much. Especially compared to how much more work you're going to do.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nEh, I really need the money.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Whatever you choose to do with your own time is up to you. But I think you might want to think about it a bit more before asking for extra hours.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nDo you have a problem with it?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Hell no. An extra pair of hands are always welcome.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nThen there's nothing wrong with it.\n[[/<]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[>]]\nHenry! ##orange|Over here for a second. I have a quick question.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYeah?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Is me dating Lee a problem to you?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWhat?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|I mean- you acted weird when you didn't even know for sure. Then you acted weird when I told you I was gay. So, I need to know - is it going to be a problem?##\n[[/>]]\nHell no. I'm fine with it.\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nI'm sorry.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|About?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nJust - how I reacted to finding out. You're like- the first person I've ever met that was... yeah.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|It's fine.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI don't know. It's just been on my mind since then. I should've reacted differently. I don't know why I reacted like that.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|If I remember right, we're both off at 6? I'm probably going to stay until 6:20/6:30, anyway. If you stick around, I can get you a beer and we can talk it over. Alright?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIf you want to do that.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|Great. Now, stop loitering around and get working.##\n[[/>]]\n\n----\n\nBeer is a strange thing. 99% of the time, it tastes like piss. But the thing is, the more you keep drinking beer, the more you start to remember it as tasting good. Then, when you drink enough of it, it starts tasting really good. The reason I'm saying this is because there was a deal where I could buy a six-pack and get one for free - which I am only partially ashamed to have bought.\n\nThere is a reason hanging out with your buddies drinking beer until you're all wasted is popular. Well, three reasons. A great time, hanging out with the boys, and waking up the next day hungover. Specifically when you start to piece together everything that you said, thought, and realized the night before and make sense of it. Because that starts to make you come to certain realizations about yourself and a specific person around you.\n\nI'm worried about the wine - how it's going to turn out. It's a very passive process. But, a whole lot can go wrong. What if I made it wrong? What if it becomes something nasty in the end? What if I followed a bad recipe? What if I made one of a million mistakes I could've made?\n\n\nI'm just anxious about it, but I really want this to come out right.\n\n----\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Welcome back.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHey.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Are you ready?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo, not yet. Give me an hour or two. I need to take a nap and get some water first.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Alright. Just tell me when you're ready.##\n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nOkay. I'm ready.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Where is this spot, anyway?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIt's on some old hiking trail an hour out of town. It leads to a clearing and you get a perfect view of the sky.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|If we want to watch a movie, we've got to pick it up now. We might not be back before the Blockbuster closes.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nPick anything, yet?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|//The Thing.//##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHuh. Isn't that like... A shitty-ass horror movie?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I've heard it's good.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nFrom who?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Film students. They know their shit.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nLet's hit the road.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|After you.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI spent a lot of time picking this spot. I think you're going to love it.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Can't wait!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nLet's see if we can catch the northern lights.\n[[/<]]\n-----\n\nI hate the weather in Oregon. You go through the extremes of everything. Blizzards, rain, floods, heatwaves, droughts, fires, earthquakes, and all of the nasty days you can imagine.\n\nBut, there are a few weeks hidden in the year that are //perfect.//\n\nToward the end of summer going into fall, you have such beautiful weather. Nights go down to just-chilly-enough, days go to barely being warm, and it has the most beautiful sunsets you could imagine. A day where you can hike out into the middle of nowhere, pour a cool glass of wine, and just enjoy the beautiful sky.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n##red|We need to see it. At least a glimpse of it. Anything!##\n\n##red|We'll see it. I __know__ we'll see it. We just need to drive a bit more.##\n\n##orange|I thought we'd see it by now. But, we aren't at the spot yet.##\n\n##orange|When we get there, we should see it.##\n\n##yellow|No. No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck! Where is it? The forecast said we should be able to see the lights up here.##\n\n##yellow|I- I fucking scouted out this spot for 3 weeks!##\n\n##yellow|.####red|.####blue|.##\n\n##green|It's alright. It's just- infuriating. I guess.##\n\n##green|I put so much effort into finding this spot.##\n\n##blue|I need to tell you something...##\n\n##blue|And I'm not too sure I'd be able to tell you this in any other way, in any other place.##\n\n##de2cc6|I wanted this something to be special. For you, and me.##\n\n##de2cc6|And I wanted where it was to be special. A alone place in nature, where we can hear the crickets and the night sky.##\n\n\n\n##blue|.####yellow|..##\n\n##red|D####orange|a####yellow|v####green|e####blue|y####indigo|,## ##violet|I## ##red|l####orange|o####yellow|v####green|e## ##blue|y####indigo|o####violet|u####red|.##\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nFuck it, I'm starting over. Too many things have gone wrong to spend so much money on it - on something that probably won't end up tasting good. I've been thinking about everything that could've gone wrong for a while, that will go wrong. And I've decided it's not worth it to try something I know for a fact won't work out.\n\nSo, I'm starting from scratch. I'm going to try to use blueberries this time. Same recipe and everything else. I might put a bit of honey in later on - see how it works out. But, this time, it will be good. It will work out. I know it will.\n\n\n-----\n\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|You're going to do //**what?**//##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI can't keep this up, ##turquoise|Davey.## At least, not right now.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|You //know// I've always offered to help pay. If you just said yes! I don't know how much my family would pay, but-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI can't! I don't want to spend the rest of my life in debt to people.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|They're my family! And they know you, they like you!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nThat's not the point. It's not my money! For all I know, they'd come knocking for me to pay it back anyway in a decade or so.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|They won't do that!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYou don't know how much I want to believe you. But, I can't know that!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Let's say they want the money in a few years, which they won't, then it's the same amount of money. But, no interest! Isn't that good enough?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nOr- I could take a gap year. Get a good head start and save up enough to get me through the rest of college. Pay off the debt over the next decade or so - then be debt-free without the possibility of being asked for tens of thousands of dollars all at once!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|How do you know that'll work?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI just- I need more time to think on it. But, I think it's a good plan.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Or, you can take the help and they'll let you finish college with barely any debt at all. And, you'll finish college faster!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIt's not-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Just-## Henry, ##turquoise|please. My parents are coming down in 2 weeks. When they're down here, we'll tell them-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNo! We are not-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|We'll tell them about us, and they'll be willing to help you!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nWe are not telling them. What if it goes wrong? What if they tell people?!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|They won't do that!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nIf they do, it's over! I go from maybe finishing college 1 or 2 years late, to not even being able to finish college without reasonably thinking I might get fucking lynched!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|You know my parents. Do they seem like the type that would do that bullshit?!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nI don't really remember them! A lot can change over 5 years. As far as I know, your mom and dad might be homophobic!\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|My aunt is a lesbian! My dad is a politician! Let's say he does freak out about it and doesn't support it - do you think he'd go around making a big show that he has a gay son? That'd fucking ruin his career if he did. And, he's fine with gay people anyway! He won't do anything.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYou're sure?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|They'll be fine with it! At worst, they don't help you with it.

I think I have a serious shot at it this time around. I've been reading the same books, buying new ones, and asking for advice. \n\nI think this is a solid bet. I'm looking forward to it!\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\nYou know, I took a picture that night.\nA really, really pretty one. \nIt wasn't able to capture everything - especially not any of the lights.\nBut, it was beautiful.\nThat night was the most beautiful night of my life.\nThis is the most beautiful picture I have ever taken in my entire life.\nAnd, I want you to have it.\nMy beauty, my star, my beautiful night.\n//Our special night.//\n\n...\n\nBut, I don't want it to just be a regular picture.\nEspecially for you?\nNo.\nI want it to be something different...\nA way it can remind you.\nRemind you of //our special night.//\n\n...\n\nThank you.\nFrom the bottom of my heart, thank you.\nThank you, ##turquoise|Davey Whittaker.## For letting us be together.\nFor letting us love each other.\nThank you, for how much I love you.\n\n...\n\nI found a girl who makes custom watches at the uni.\nThey're pretty good quality.\nReal silver and a bunch of other fancy things - she assures me.\nBut what's most valuable is what the background is.\nWe can choose what we want it to be.\nSo, I got you a watch with the background being //our special night.//\n\n...\n\nAnd it's for you.\nIt's a gift - from me, to you.\n//A special night// spent with me and you.\n\nI love you.\n\nAnd I'll always remember //our special night.//\n\n[[/=]]\n----\n\nOne thing you'll find a lot of in Oregon are breweries. Especially in Blackwater. I think there are something like 30 across the entire city. When I first moved here, I remember that you could get beer from employees who bought a bunch to sell to you at like 3 times the price.\n\nDon't know if that's still a thing. It probably is. Back in Coeur d'Alene, my cousin used to buy alcohol I wanted - so long as I paid for it. I got to send him a bottle one day - a homebrewed one. As a thanks.\n\n----\n[[<]]\nBabe, is this yours?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Yeah. I mean- it was. But, I was going to give it to you.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nJesus- how much is it?

We'll use it, I guess. No point not to. But, this isn't becoming a regular fucking thing.\n[[/<]]\n\n----\n\nMy favorite thing to eat is probably sliced tomatoes. They were something my ##lime|Dad## used to make all of the time. He used to slice them and coat each slice in olive oil, vinegar, and salt. They were, and still are, the best way to eat raw tomatoes. Even then, I used to hate when ##lime|Dad## made pasta sauce from scratch. I'd be less mad if he used way, way less onions. Also if he used any other seasoning than a little bit of salt. \n\nOne night, I remember him coming home with a bottle of ##yellow|red wine## - a gift from one of his neighbors. I think I was... 10? 9? Around that. He picked two tomatoes, gave them the Murders family treatment, and gave me one. Then, he gave me a mason jar filled with ##yellow|red wine.## After I tasted it, he asked me how it was. I told him it was awful, because it was at the time, and he laughed. Told me to remember that taste any time in the future when I wanted to start drinking.\n \n----\n\n[[>]]\nHenry! ##turquoise|Come here, real quick.##\n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nYeah?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I made you a special something.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nOoh.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Orecchiette pasta, I remember you teaching me how to make it by hand like your ## ##lime|dad## ##turquoise|taught you. I also made chicken parm, and tomato sauce.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nYou didn't need to-\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\nHenry, ##turquoise|I'm sorry about yesterday. I should've asked you first. And, I want to apologize.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nThank you! But again, you didn't need to do this.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Bitch! We still need to eat.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHah, I guess we do. I mean, I'm not complaining.\n[[/<]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nThis is really good.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Do you like it?##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nHm? Oh, no. I hate it. Hate it so much. I think you should try to make this again - because this was so bad that you need to keep making it. \n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|Well, if you hate it //so// much I might as well not do it again-##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nNow, now. Don't just give up!\n[[/<]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[<]]\nHow'd you make the sauce?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I used at least half of a head of garlic in it. Fried it with a single shallot before putting a few canned tomatoes in it and cooking them until they fell apart. I don't even remember what seasoning I used. I think salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, paprika, basil, thyme, oregano, rosemary, lemon zest, and a bunch of other things. Toward the end, I also poured in a bit of fancy## ##yellow|red wine## ##turquoise|I got as a gift yesterday.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nOh? From who?\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|A guy named## ##yellow|James## ##turquoise|from the university.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nThat's nice of him.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##turquoise|I'm glad you like the sauce.##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\nOnly thing I could genuinely say is, that I wish you put a bit more onions in it. But that might be my ##lime|dad## talking through me.\n[[/<]]\n\n-----\n\nBlackwater's going through a bit of a cold snap right now. I was panicking, trying to make sure that the wine was in a warm room. Somewhere that will be warm for the next few days. Over the weekend, it might hit the 20's.\n\nIf the wine freezes, it could explode the bottle. Even if it doesn't, I am worried about it killing off anything inside of it.\n\nI mean, realistically I shouldn't worry about it. It's not going to get anywhere near cold enough to freeze it to the point of exploding. But, I'm still going to worry about it, anyway.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n\n//Ingredients://\n\n1x pumpkin pie (Storebought)\n1x bottle of champagne\n2x wine glass\n1x video rental of //The Thing//\n1x set of skills learned from ##lime|dad##\n1x whole chicken (Manually deboned.)\n2x chicken thighs (Seasoned.)\n1x pan\n12x minutes (Constantly flipped.)\n2x potatoes (Sliced.)\n1x boil\n80x minutes in the oven\n1x couch\n1x blanket\n1x tv\n2x boyfriends (Secretive.)\n\n//Creates://\n\n2x servings (Containing chicken thigh, roasted potatoes, and a slice of pie.)\n1x romantic night (Born from worry.)\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\nThe wine's looking good. I checked on it today and moved it to a different container to finish fermenting in. Just been checking up on it every now and again. I don't think you need to change containers, though? But, I don't know. I'm just nervous about this whole thing. I want to make sure it goes right.\n\nIt does have a bit of an off-smell to it, however.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n##green|... //Mr. Murders,## ##de2cc6|Paul## ##green|would like to have a brief word with you at his office whenever you are done with your current workload.// ...##\n[[/=]]\n\n[[<]]\nAh, shit.\n[[/<]]\n[[=]]\n...\n[[/=]]\n[[>]]\nHenry! ##de2cc6|Have a seat!##\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n##de2cc6|Mr. Chance-##\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##de2cc6|Come on, everyone else calls me Paul.

And I love that he's caring about that and worried for me. But, I can pay it myself! I'm already uncomfortable having his parents pay for my college - mostly because I'm worried that they're going to want me to pay it back. Again, I know he means well. But... I don't know what I'm going for here.\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##orange|It's up to you what you do. I'd take the money, personally.

About my new girlfriend...\n[[/<]]\n\n-----\n\nIf I'm being honest, the best type of wine is a $5, highly-suspicious bottle of wine that you bought at the grocery store and forgot in your cupboard for a week. I blame, or rather thank, my ##42a1ff|mother## for this. She used to cook with it all the time. Left opened bottles after, which I eventually snuck drinks of.\n\nBut, she quit using them right before I started high school. I don't know why. I do know she never really drank, unlike my ##lime|father##, who loved ##yellow|red wine.## \n\n----\n[[<]]\n##lime|Dad?##\n[[/<]]\n[[>]]\n##lime|... Huh? Yeah, no. I heard you.

Whenever you're having the best days of your life, they seem to just slip on by. Nothing notable. Just you slipping on through life.\n\nBut then, whenever something big happens, time starts to get really slow. Whenever you're expecting something, your days double in length. They just get so unbearably long and it's a chore to get by them. And it just lets you think a lot about what's at the end of it. Get really excited for the good things that are coming of it, or really worried for any bad things that could happen.\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n##violet|It's a long drive home.##\n##violet|A long, long drive.##\n##violet|Through rivers, over mountains.##\n##violet|Across 3 states.##\n##violet|All to get back home.##\n##violet|I need to do something.##\n##violet|Something nice.##\n##turquoise|He## ##violet|deserves it.##\n##violet|I could take him skiing?##\n##violet|I could take him on a hike?##\n##violet|Or, I could buy him his favorite movie and favorite wine.##\n##yellow|Red wine's## ##violet|on clearance.

Currently, it is pending analysis for potential clues as to the whereabouts of \"Randy Murders\".\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n----\n++ How to make vinegar.\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nA few months ago, I thought I would be able to make wine. I at first tried blackberry wine, but realized that it wasn't the type for me. Then, I tried to make blueberry wine. Now, it was most certainly a type of wine I would have loved. However, the batch went sour. It didn't work out. Ultimately, I thought it was a failure. And it killed my winemaking aspirations, at least for a while. I'm not too sure if I will try to make wine again.\n\nBut, what I did make, is vinegar. A sour, repulsive, beautiful batch of blueberry vinegar that I catch myself using quite frequently. There was this film on top - the \"mother of vinegar\", as it's called. Apparently, I can put that in other wine and it will transform into vinegar after a few weeks. It's a bit more complicated than that, but that's the gist of it.\n\nI didn't really think I would walk away from this with anything. Anything useful, that is. I thought I'd just walk away with no experience, a bunch of dirty containers, and all of my sugar wasted on something ugly. But, I persisted through it, stumbling upon something great.\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n##violet|Here we are...##\n##violet|Where it all started!##\n##violet|I remember driving out here.##\n##violet|After //that night.//##\n##violet|It was a perfect night.##\n##violet|A perfect, feel-good, all-and-entirely beautiful sorta night.##\n##violet|The clouds were nowhere to be seen.##\n##violet|The moon was full.##\n##violet|The stars shined especially bright that night.##\n##violet|I hiked there, and laid there.##\n##violet|And I stared into the infinite abyss that is the beauty of our night sky.##\n##violet|I remember it being a sleepless night.##\n##violet|One where I had to force myself to blink.##\n##violet|And I thought only about //our special night.//##\n##violet|The best night of my life.##\n##violet|Reflected upon on the worst night of my life.##\n##violet|//Our special night...//##\n\n##violet|...##\n\n##violet|I think about it a lot.##\n##violet|//Our special night...//##\n##violet|Especially recently.##\n##violet|So, congrats!##\n##violet|On our anniversary.##\n##violet|About 10 months off...##\n\n##violet|...##\n\n##violet|Anyways-##\n##violet|I'm really happy for you.##\n##violet|Wherever you are...##\n##violet|Whoever you're with.##\n\n##violet|...##\n\n##violet|I would really like to say that I hate you.##\n##violet|Being able to would mean the world to me.##\n##violet|But-##\n\n##violet|...##\n\n##violet|You know, it's funny.##\n##violet|I think I might have finally saved up enough to finish college.##\n##violet|Go back in my 40's, finally get that degree and start living life.##\n##violet|Guess I didn't need you after all, huh?##\n##violet|But, it's too late.##\n##violet|Besides, I'm happy with what happened.##\n##violet|If I could change it, I would in a heartbeat.##\n##violet|But, I like it.
