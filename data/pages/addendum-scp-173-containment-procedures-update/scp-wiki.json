And why rabbits? Fish don't blink, why not line the statue's containment with a tank? How are your proposed changes more cost efficient than the current containment procedures?\n\nHead Researcher L.

The statue would remain in place if something was watching it at all times uninhibited.\n\nRabbits rarely blink and consume grass. The resulting compost from the rabbits would be taken to the on-site vegetable gardens and would cut the cost overall on fertilizer. Furthermore fish care is more costly than rabbit care (please see attached document animal-care-expenses.pdf). \n\nIn regards to staffing, animal handlers already working at Site-19 will be given the task to oversee the rabbits' care in tandem with the statue's research team. This leaves us with 3 D-Class who clean the statue's cell. Instead of cycling through 5-7 D-Class every year due to negligence, my estimate is <2 every year if the procedures are updated. Attached are documents of my findings.\n\nResearcher Leah Królik\nSite-19 Anomalous Art Research Team\n19 1221 ex: 31\n\n##cyan|[prospective-budget.pdf]## ##cyan|[test-log_summary_SCP-173_2017-05.pdf]## ##cyan|[pet-care-expenses.pdf]##\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n**To:** Researcher Leah Królik\n**From:** Head Researcher L.
