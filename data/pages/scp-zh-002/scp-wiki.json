When a record of witness of item occurs, The Foundation should activate **Protocol MT. JADE**, along with the reacting procedures of natural disasters in The Foundation, and the extensive concerns toward the datas of Central Weather Bureau of Taiwanese Government. Details of **Protocol MT. JADE** are limited to personnel with clearance 4 or above. Personnel with the clearence below 4 should follow the Type IV and Type VII Response Code of Anomalous Entities and inform the associated Security Director of the nearest Site under the circumstance of witnessing the item.\n\n**Description:** SCP-ZH-002 is an anomalous biological entity which presents basic thaumaturgic ability and divine radiation. SCP-ZH-002 has been confirmed, under morphological examinations, to carry at least 13 compartments and features of Taiwanese zoologic species. These characters include:\n\n* The antlers of Taiwanese Sika Deer[[footnote]]//Cervus nippon taiouanus//[[/footnote]]\n* The feet and hoof of Taiwanese Sambar Deer[[footnote]]//Rusa unicolor swinhoei//[[/footnote]]\n* The V-shaped white streak of Formosan[[footnote]]\"Taiwanese\" in Dutch.[[/footnote]] Black Bear[[footnote]]//Ursus thibetanus formosanus//[[/footnote]]\n* The fur prints of Formosan Clouded Leopard[[footnote]]//Neofelis nebulosa brachyura//[[/footnote]] and Leopard Cats[[footnote]]//Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis//[[/footnote]].\n* The feather of Formosan Blue Magpie[[footnote]]//Urocissa caerulea//, a well-known crow-like bird with indigo feathers.[[/footnote]] grows out of the skin around scapula, along with the long tail feathers of Mikado Pheasant[[footnote]]//Syrmaticus mikado//[[/footnote]]\n* The scales of Taiwanese Pangolin[[footnote]]//Manis p. pentadactyla//, a kind of mammal with scales, residing among southeastern Asia area.[[/footnote]] covering the hips and ankles\n* The eyes of Taiwanese Macaque[[footnote]]//Macaca cyclopis//, a kind of monkey majorly living in islands of Taiwan and Japan.[[/footnote]]\n* The ears of Taiwanese Flying Fox[[footnote]]//Pteropus dasymallus formosus//, a kind of huge bat with long snout like fox.[[/footnote]]\n* The fang that matches the morphological traits of the ones on Taiwanese Wild Boar[[footnote]]//Sus scrofa taivanus//[[/footnote]]\n* The streaks and spots of Sakura Hooked Salmon[[footnote]]//Oncorhynchus masou formosanus//[[/footnote]] show at the sides of torso of the item with significant humid surface.\n* The coccygeal traits similar with the extinct species //Balaenoptera taiwanica// (Taiwanese Whale).\n* The incisors of Taiwanese Field Mouse[[footnote]]//Apodemus semotus//[[/footnote]]\n* Six forked tongues of serpents from unknown species.\n\nApart from the characters above, the item also has a transparent, straight, blue crystalline horn lengths 30cm on the forehead. The horn is confirmed to be the organ used to demonstrate thaumaturgic ability. The item also carries the divine radiation in the range of 130~533 akivas, and is classified into the category of Natural Divine Entities under the standard of Thesiologic Division.\n\nSCP-ZH-002 has been witnessed for numerous times since 17th Century. The recorded date of emerge of the SCP item always corresponds to the date of one critical catastrophe in history of Taiwan. Currently, The Foundation has retrieved several documents associated with the SCP-ZH-002 entity from several historic groups of interest among different colonizing eras in history of Taiwan. It is highly suggested that the emerge of SCP-ZH-002 entity could be regarded as a sign, or at least strongly related to the occurrence of local catastrophes.\n\n**Addendum ZH-002-1: An Extract of Retrieved Documents**\n[[collapsible show=\"[3/CLEARANCE ACQUIREMENT]\" hide=\"-VISIT IS PERMITTED-\"]]\n\n> **Incident:** Approx. 17th Century. A landslide event occurred in Yujing, Tainan.

They also implied that the creature somehow induced a massive landslide event by the bank of Ho-Ku River, causing casualties of the tribesmen. The disaster forced the Tapani Tribe of Taivoan People to migrate to where Yujing Township currently locates. Whether the unidentified entity was SCP-ZH-002, and whether the entity indeed induced the landslide event, are still under investigaion.\n\n> **Incident:** 1653.7.13.
