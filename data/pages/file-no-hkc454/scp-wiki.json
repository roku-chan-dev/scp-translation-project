It has been shown that 0.032% of migrants have anomalous effects, and of these, 78% understand their own effects. This huge influx overwhelmed Zero Team's detention room. Therefore, a temporary detention centre is needed for the containment of the anomalous entities.\n\nSecondly, some of the boat people have been affected by the anomaly. Another location is needed to find their medical treatment and nursing under the Veil Protocol. According to the MI666 obtained record, [[[scp-2350|the paramilitary branch of the USA Department of Defense (code name: Pentagram) had used weaponised memetic agent in Vietnam War.]]] and the British government signed the Geneva Convention that Hong Kong is appointed by UNHCR as Port of First Asylum and responsible for the related medical treatment. [[footnote]]Note from RAISA: See Global Occult Coalition's annex for detail.[[/footnote]]Since the treatment involved paratech, the custodial wards for these patients are needed to separate from the regular custodial wards and public hospital wards.\n\nUntil now, there have already been 3 cases of anomalous effects that occurred in the detention centre, while the deployed CSD[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: Correctional Services Department, former named \"Prisons Department\", which is responsible for managing the detention centre for the Vietnamese migrant in the British administration.[[/footnote]] staff have no awareness of anomalies. As a result, 5 CSD staff have already died in the line of duty. At the same time, these incidents also cause disruptive situations in the confined living conditions of detention centres, which lead to a total of 16 boat people being injured.\n\nWith the influx of Vietnamese boat people, the above three situations directly affecting Hong Kong correctional services, public security and the Veil Protocol, therefore need to be handled immediately.\n\n[[=]]\nPOLICIES\n----\n[[/=]]\n1. Approved Zero Team to allocate 20 (including informal members) to organise a task force to evaluate related issues.\n\n2. Building temporary detention centres.\n\n3. Develop a quick test for identifying anomalous humanoids.\n[[=]]\n(2)\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Policy Implementation Report]]\n[[div style=\" background:#ffffff; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ CLASSIFIED\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\nRegarding the Implementation of the Policies\n[[/=]]\nTo encounter more and more serious Vietnamese boat people issues, three instructions is proposed by the Special Branch. The following is the detail of the practical implementation:\n\n__Temporary Detention Centre:__\n\n[[[new-cha-ling|At present, site selection of the temporary detention centre is located in New Cha Ling.]]] In addition to resembling the design of the ordinary detention centre[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: At that time the communities responsible for hosting Vietnamese boat people, for example, Tai A Chau Detention Centre for Vietnamese migrants.[[/footnote]] with public bathhouses, office and detention quarters, there are 20 special custodial wards. In addition, activity rooms for religious activities will be built in order to account for the potential special religious needs of the relevant abnormal communities which boat people need to apply for it every single use.\n\nThe whole detention centre would be covered by a mini-type Scranton Reality Matrix, and there are miniature-type Kant counters attached to the office. It is estimated the construction will be completed in half a year, there will be able to accommodate up to 100 boat people waiting to be repatriated or transferred to other countries.\n\n__Extrastaff Recruitment:__\n\n20 staff are recruited from the police force and CSD and completed three months of abnormal community and response training. These personnel have entered two two-month internships, it is estimated they can finish the internship before the centre construction is completed and put into service officially.\n\n__Rapid Test on Anomalous Humanoid:__\n\nThough the internal application of paratech is effective currently, further research and retrofit are rather uncommon. Therefore, the research is currently contracted to Prometheus Labs. However, the bottleneck is encountered and further funding is required. Please refer to Addendum 1 for details.\n\n[[=]]\nP.A\n14.12.\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n(3)\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 1 Reply from Prometheus Labs 10/12/1982]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #36648B; background: #E3E7EA; width: 84%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n**From:** Dr William Kars, Researcher of Memetic Department, Prometheus Labs\n\n**To:** Officer Ming Fai CHEN\n\n**Subject:** Regarding Memetic Rapid Test on Anomalous Humanoid\n----\nHi,\n\nAs approved in an outsourcing contract with us, a scientific research company, we carried out technological research, in order to achieve memetic transmission through broadcasting towards the boat people, and at least to screen the Vietnamese boat people intending to conceal their special situation. After the tireless efforts of our employees, the memetic audio developed has passed the trial successfully: Listener would develop some harmless red rashes on the body, and these rashes would remain on the entity for approximately 10 to 20 days.\n\nHowever, the production of radio is extremely complicated. Since the memetic effect is spread indirectly through the radio rather than to the radio itself, both rerecording and copying of the radio cannot inherit the prototype’s effect. On the other hand, the preparation of embedding the memetic effect into the radio already takes three to four months in the current funding situation, which is not enough for a mass broadcast by the marine police.\n\nAs our contract expires in January of next year, the test version has been sent to the police station. If it is necessary to develop a version with reproducible effects, it is suggested a further investment into the projects to facilitate the operation of the R&D team in the future.\n[[/div]]\n\n> The related funding was approved by MI666.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Addendum 2 Reply from Prometheus Labs 12/12/1987]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #36648B; background: #E3E7EA; width: 84%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; box-shadow: 2px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n**From:** Dr William Kars, Researcher of Memetic Department, Prometheus Labs\n\n**To:** Officer Ming Fai CHEN\n\n**Subject:** Regarding Memetic Rapid Test on Anomalous Humanoid\n----\nAfter a long period of effort, mixing and editing of the memetic effect and audio is finally done. It now works even in the radio broadcast.\n\n50 copies have been prepared. Please contact us if more are needed.\n\nI'm looking forward to working together next time.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n> Since 1988, the 44s-length recording of \"Comprehensive Plan of Action for Vietnamese boat people\"[[footnote]]Note from RAISA: known as 'Bat lau dung laai' (//Translator's Note:// Transliteration from Cantonese \"不漏洞拉\" which is mishearing of Vietnamese \"bắt đầu từ nay\" mean \"start for now\".), broadcasted after the 10 pm Evening News between 1988 to 1997.[[/footnote]] broadcasts through radio with the humanoid entity screening meme. However, the effect is unsatisfactory with an encounter rate of about 38%. The audio will keep broadcasting while the alternative solution is developing. [[footnote]]Note from researcher Zhang Daoshi: There is no memetic effect in the rerecording audio found on the internet, the investigation for the original is ongoing.[[/footnote]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n@@ @@\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=minmasterqw, translated by Mang Gwan]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
