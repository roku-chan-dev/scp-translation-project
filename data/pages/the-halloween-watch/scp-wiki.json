I spoke just enough halting Japanese to ask what she was doing, and though I couldn't exactly keep up with what she told me, it was clear from what I could understand that she thought she was dreaming. I was just able to speak enough to ask her to leave me in peace. She laughed but did as I ask, walking further into the woods. I immediately noped the fuck out of there, and I haven't really thought about it since.\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##cyan|**Wiz0765**## 10/28/26 (Wed) 08:08:31 #92543792\n------\n> I instantly recognized it as a Rokurokubi\n\nweeb\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##olivedrab|**wonder5truck**## 10/29/26 (Thu) 07:19:42 #19926525\n------\n\nRokurokubi are yokai whose necks elongate.

Fine, if you insist. Let me tell you about my experience with Lorelei.\n\nLorelei is a rock on the Rhine and is the subject of countless legends. The most well known one involves a Siren who is also named Lorelei that combs her golden hair and lures sailors to their deaths. That's mostly just based off of writers in the 18th century messing up the lore because it made a more interesting story. The original lore involved dwarves muttering deep in the caves of Lorelei which is at least a little more interesting, but leaves something to be desired motivation wise.\n\nThe truth is far more interesting than either of those. I believe Lorelei whispers deep truths about the universe.\n\nI've only been there once, but it's a surreal experience. You hear this constant murmuring in the background, and you can't explain it or figure out where it's coming from. But slowly, words start to take shape. Words meant to get your attention. Maybe not directly addressed to you, but words that will pique your interest. And as you try and find the source, it gets louder and louder as you approach an edge. And you start to hear fragments. \"The limit of the universe...\" \"Human suffering is for...\" \"Consciousness is simply...\" Fundamental truths of the universe, right there, so you can just barely hear them. You're not being enticed by them, you're simply curious. And you can know the truth, the answers behind all of the universe's biggest question. You just have to fall to the river below. \n\nNo wonder writers thought there was a siren there.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:78%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 80px\"]]\n##magenta|**RenTasunder**## 10/29/26 (Thu) 12:41:04 #19277648\n------\n\nFrom the wikipedia page on Lorelei:\n\n> The murmuring is hard to hear today owing to the urbanization of the area.\n\nBut you were able to hear it perfectly murmuring, despite the urbanization and all of the scientific explanations?\n\nSure, Jan.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##tomato|**s0sp00ky**## 10/29/26 (Thu) 11:36:15 #27734655\n------\n\nDude, what the fuck are you on about?

Not the movie, but the real deal?\n> \n> The legend goes that a long time ago in New Mexico, there lived a beautiful widow who had two children. Though she loved her children, she hated being alone and longed to have another man to love her. One day, a handsome man came to the village, and he took a liking to her. But he refused to propose, as he did not like children. Distraught at this revelation and thinking herself clever, the woman took her children to the river and left them to drown. When she told the man what she'd done, he was horrified, and left, never to return. With the man gone, the woman quickly realized her mistake. She ran back to the river, weeping, but it was too late. They were gone. As she ran, looking for some sign of them, she tripped and hit her head on a rock, killing her. She was rejected from heaven for her sins, and made to be stuck on earth until she finds the souls of her lost children. \n> \n> [[div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:{$width}; margin-top: 1.2em;\"]]\n> [[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-halloween-watch//Rio-Grande-Cropped.png style=\"width:{$width};\" link={$link}]]\n> [[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:{$width};\"]]\n> Where it happened\n> [[/div]]\n> [[/div]]\n> When I was like a sophomore in high school, and I was at a halloween party near the rio grande. It had gotten too loud and busy for me, so I decided to take a stroll by the riverside (I took a photo of where I was a few days ago in anticipation for this). As I walked, I heard a crying in the distance. I hadn't heard the tale of La Llorona in years, and it was Halloween, so I assumed it was somebody having halloween merriment in the distance. As I walked, the sound got louder. It was really unsettling. I started to think of everything it could be, even the supernatural explanations. \n> \n> Eventually, I came upon a woman wearing a white dress and weeping by the riverside. In that moment I was certain it was La Llorona, and my heart stopped. I couldn't move, I was so scared. I wanted to get far away from there, but I was frozen to the spot. Eventually she looked up. She looked at me, and in the dark I could only just make out her face. She looked... excited? I couldn't tell. She begged for my help, and I found the strength to take a few small steps backwards. She lost her children, she continued, and was scared they'd fallen in the river, and would I be kind enough to help her look. I thought I was going to die for certain. It took all the strength I had to run away. She gave chase, but after a while I heard her fall. She screamed in pain and begged me to help her, but I kept running until I could no longer hear her. As I ran, I swear I heard children whispering and laughing. I left the riverside, deeply unsettled, and didn't sleep at all. \n> \n> It wasn't until the next day I heard that a woman and her two children had gone missing. I tried to put it out of my head that police were searching the river near where I had been. To this day, I'm not sure what I saw by the river. And I'm scared to know the answer.\n> \n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; background:  var(--bg-dark); border-width: 2px; border-style: solid; border-color: var(--bg-light); float:center; width:81%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 60px\"]]\n##Dodgerblue|**Violaorchestranerd66**## 10/30/26 (Fri) 11:44:16 #82637192\n------\n\nHey, uh, that's a cool tale and all. I mean, I'd never heard that variant of La Llorona but it was different and I liked it. And I don't mean to doubt the authenticity of your post, but, uh, that's my photo.

The point is that it's a robot afterlife.\n> \n> And to clarify, I don't mean a human afterlife filled with robots, I mean an afterlife //for// robots that have died. \"Died.\" Shit, I don't know, the terminology is gonna have to be a bit weird here.\n> \n> It's said that deep within Forest Park, a portal of mist will take you to a forest of black and white, where you can just barely see in front of your face. If you're very careful and quiet, the robots won't notice you. And you definitely don't want to be noticed by them. See, they don't really like humans. It seems that while they were alive, they felt trapped and tormented by humans, and being dead, they'd like to not be bothered by humans anymore.\n> \n> I was a little skeptical at first. Don't get me wrong, I buy that AI exists in a much more advanced state than they want us to know. I could even buy portals to other realms. But robots having an afterlife... it just seemed unlikely.\n> \n> So I went myself. It's real. I saw drones that were acting like birds, I saw robots just walking around. I didn't stray too far from the portal, but it seemed to go on forever. And it really is black and white, like somebody just put a black and white filter over the whole forest. \n> \n> Unfortunately, I was spotted by the robots. I knew I should run, but I had to know more. I asked what this place was. The robot asked if I would like to find out, and began charging at me. I only stopped running once I safely reached my car. I almost laughed at myself, because how could robots escape the afterlife? Still, I think we're witnessing the birth of a folktale.
