I basically didn't want to draw an actual fish skeleton so i looked up some references and made my own! That's how davy bones came to be. That's my process actually: the image comes first, and after some sketching THEN I start writing! Veeery slowly. Writing isn't my strong suit lol.\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/plwvM4g.png]]\nThis is a comic I did right after I finished the draft. I really like the colours and how vague it is.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**__Theatre Troupe__**\n[[[http://www.scp-wiki.net/a-good-actor | The Theatre Troupe]]] is a group of characters who lived during the Renaissance. My pals Mel, Pepsi (<3) and I have had this idea for awhile and I drew a lot of art and stuff for it, as well as an animatic.\n[[collapsible show=\"Blanche and Francine\" hide=\"My girls...\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/mRbi75q.png]]\nHere they are in their costumes! \n[[image https://i.imgur.com/0vucuhk.png]]\nThis is a more recent image of them as.. just them <3\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/kaGz93L.jpg]]\nThe concept/older ver.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Barnaby\" hide=\"Barnaby as a character belongs to mellowmisfit!\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/HlwetdP.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Giorno\" hide=\"His name actually used to be Gio but I didn't check and now it's too late\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/MN4WVSO.jpg]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/1AzcdAG.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/9fK0Ku9.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[collapsible show=\"035 and them\" hide=\"they r all together :-)\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/yjineU9.png]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/SAyPYQu.png]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab About Me]]\n\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/T0xBvjN.jpg]]\n\n**[[size large]]Hello![[/size]]**\nI'm Tropia and I do the draws and the funnies. I got into SCP April 2019 and I drew a lot of art for it, and now I joined here so I was like hm. Tis a good idea.\n----\nI usually get inspiration for my art from the music I listen to and I do this really cool thing where if I don't have the song on loop and change to another one I'll leave the drawing unfinished and move on to another one. With SCP at first I wanted to be funny and hey it worked, some of the comics I did are sort of funny.\n\nI use Procreate for all my digital stuff, and sometimes I go back and forth between the two. Sketching is definitely the most fun part of it all for me and you can tell, with the over-abundance of sketches and lack of actual finished pieces in here.\nMy go-to canvas is just the standard Instagram square, 1080x1080, but sometimes I like to stretch that sucker out if I know I want to make a bigger piece. \n\nMy inspiration for my style comes from mainly cartoons (duh) and rubberhose cartoons (those old and vintage ones). I like drawing fluidly and quickly and I don't like to spend too much time on one piece, though at times the finished product is worth it.\n\nI'm looking forward to drawing more scps yeehoo!\n\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[=image https://i.imgur.com/xihqD0p.gif]]",
