Found instances of SCP-7052-1 are to be monitored and, if displaying unusual or dangerous behavior, contained in standard humanoid cells at the closest Site.

Although this action initially appears as irrational, it will result in numerous anomalous effects beneficial to the subject (hereinafter referred to as SCP-7052-1). These effects typically manifest within five to ten minutes after the insertion. The anomalies vary, although the following effects are always present:\n* Increased sexual attraction towards SCP-7052-1 affecting people of gender based on SCP-7052-1's sexual orientation[[footnote]] This effect will likely be absent if SCP-7052-1 is asexual[[/footnote]]\n* Improvement of SCP-7052-1's physical and mental abilities\n* Sudden healing of SCP-7052-1's wounds, infections, and carcinomas\n* Various ontokinetic effects that result in the enhancement of luck in SCP-7052-1's life - such as higher probability of winning lotteries and other chance-based competitions\n* Improvement in mood\n\nThe intensity of these effects depends on the depth of the insertion, as well as the number and size of spoons inserted. The most intense effects, reported at 12 standard silverware spoons, had strong ontokinetic properties. This instance, referred to as SCP-7052-1-9, was formerly a D-class member known as D-952674 (see Addendum-2).\n\n**Addendum-1:** List of known instances of SCP-7052-1 (excluding D-class personnel)\n\n|| **Date of discovery** || **Location** || **Note** ||\n|| 07/08/2015 || Moscow || Monitored; a successful Russian wrestler||\n|| 01/22/2016 || Site-19 || An adult film actress; contained due to apparent anomalies ||\n|| 11/19/2018 || Site-19 || A researcher at Site-19 ||\n|| 11/20/2018 || Site-19 || A researcher at Site-19 ||\n|| 09/15/2020 || Portland, OR||Monitored; an American bus driver||\n|| 01/15/2022 || Osaka ||Monitored; a Japanese billionaire ||\n|| 05/27/2022 || Site-83 ||A criminal; contained||\n|| 09/01/2022 || UNKNOWN ||A former researcher at Site-19||\n**Addendum-2:** \n__**Incident Iota**__\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Subject:** D-952674  \n\n**Procedure:** Experimentation with high-intensity SCP-7052\n\n**Results:** D-952674 had to be terminated due to extreme anomalies.\n\n**Report:**\n\n------\n\n**Dr. Lorenz:** You will enter this room.
