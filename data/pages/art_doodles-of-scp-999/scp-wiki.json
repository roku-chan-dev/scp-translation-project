I didn't want to directly copy any particular version that I've seen, so I tried a few different body shapes just to see what would happen. The shape I ended up liking most is reminiscent of Stormtrooper helmets from the original Star Wars trilogy, though I'd like to try more in the future.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ SCP-999 Doodles\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n[[<image 999%20doodle.jpg size=\"medium\"]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** 999%20doodle.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user Animaniacal]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:doodles-of-scp-999 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
