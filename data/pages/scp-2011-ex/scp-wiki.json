SCP-2011's lyrics depict the singer's requests to 'Mister Marks' to send them a 'Temporary Secretary' for reasons unstated, detailing the various requirements which she would not have to fulfill.\n\nA remastered version of SCP-2011 was released on 2011/01/01 and subsequently endangered the life of O5-4. It has since been declared a Class-4 audiohazard, and made provisionally inaccessible to the public. Research as to its anomalous nature is ongoing.\n\n[[table style=\"width: 100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n\n[[div class=\"modal\"]]\n= [[span class=\"bigtext\"]]ADDENDUM 2011-EX-1:[[/span]] Context\n\nWhen questioned as to why he wrote SCP-2011, McCartney stated:\n\n> //\"It's like a disposable secretary, and it struck me as being funny.

It's not often we drag in civilians, especially not here.\n\n**PoI-2011:** I haven't broken any laws, I'll tell you that much, so if you're with the government or something, you can piss off.

And we needed another song for the record, we were runnin' out of studio time, an' I thought back to how John and George would usually take over when that happened. I had some pretty alright ideas but they'd always shoot 'em down, and it always rubbed me wrong.\n\n**PoI-2011:** So, I just said 'fuck it', right? What if I just went with whatever came to mind and wrote a song without second-guessin' myself? What if I ignored John's voice in my head? What could possibly go wrong?\n\n= //<There is a long pause. O5-4 reaches into his desk drawer, producing two glasses and a bottle of whisky. He pours them each a glass.>//\n\n**O5-4:** I'm sorry. I understand how that feels.

And some people quite like it, I guess.\n\n= //<O5-4 nods, taking a sip from his glass.>//\n\n**PoI-2011:** Why's it got you so bogged down, anyway?
