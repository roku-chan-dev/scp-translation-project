This is my interpretation of both SCP-007 and SCP-191, if their descriptions had been reversed. At first, I thought of drawing three entries but I ended up taking too much time with SCP-191. I hope you'll like it.\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n\n----\n[[=]]\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-007 SCP-007]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=image SCP-007.png]]\nInstead of being a human that happened to have a planet in place of his abdomen, his entire body was intensively modified with cybernetics specifically to sustain the planet he houses in his body.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n[*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-191 SCP-191]\n[[/=]]\n----\n[[=image SCP%20-%20191.png]]\n[[=]]\nThe Carrion Child\n[[/=]]\n\n...is what I call her. Instead of being fused with cybernetics, her body is assimilated with the flesh and body parts of multiple unknown, anomalous organisms. I have also made two alternate versions of my SCP-191 artwork, with only slight color and characteristic differences.\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"SCP-191: Alternate hair\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[=image SCP%20-%20191%20Alt.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"SCP-191: Wingless\" hide=\"Close\"]]\n\n[[=image SCP%20-%20191%20Wingless.png]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n\n\n[[/div]]",
