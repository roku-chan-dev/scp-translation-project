The Foundation universe captured her imagination at some point between her reading SCP-3008 and exploring various Canon hubs. She created a Wikidot account and joined the site at the start of June in hopes of making her own contributions to the community.\n\nHer username is perhaps a bit of a mouthful, so she'll readily respond to the nicknames \"Rio\" or \"Riolu\". \n\nShe is very rarely present on the IRC chat #site19, but will eventually reply to a Wikidot PM. Her works in progress may be found in [https://scpsandbox2.wikidot.com/rioludoodle her Sandbox].\n\n**Other Information:** Rio has taken music lessons in piano [[footnote]] which she is good at [[/footnote]] and guitar [[footnote]] which she is terrible at [[/footnote]]. She does digital art as a hobby on those occasions when she finds the motivation to draw. She adores animated movies, dogs, and chocolate, not necessarily in that order. \n\nIt is with cult-like fervor that Rio declares her love for the FIRST Robotics Competition. She is currently attending the University of Michigan. \n\n//\"Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a human disagrees with you, let them live.
