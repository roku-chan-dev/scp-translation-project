Any unauthorized personnel attempting access to SCP-6665 are to be detained and questioned, regardless of clearance. \n\nThe continued lobotomization of SCP-6665-α will retain the functionality of SCP-6665 and the Foundation as a whole. One subject -- designated 'Caretaker' -- will be selected to perform daily medical examinations on SCP-6665 and its components, in order to ensure its continued complicity. Caretaker must perform the following medical routine for SCP-6665. Precise amounts specified are subject to increase. \n\n||~ {{**WEEKDAY**}}  ||~ {{**REQUIRED MEDICAL INTERVENTION(S)**}} ||\n|| Monday  || Beginning of starvation period; SCP-6665-█ and its chamber are to be thoroughly examined.

On the former two dates, procedures can be performed with marginal effectivity if a chocolate cake with several candles is present.\n\nPersonnel unable to recall vital and/or personal information as a result of SCP-6665 will be discreetly given replacement information; their memories are to be altered to accommodate this change. All civilians in contact with afflicted personnel will undergo similar memory alteration to apply the replacement information. Civilian databases will be adjusted accordingly. \n\nAny vomiting by affected personnel is to be attributed to common food poisoning. The vomit is to be thoroughly removed and incinerated. \n\nNARM0.0.aic -- the Foundation grammatical assistance intelligence construct -- has been updated with additional protocol measures allowing for it to repair data loss from SCP-6665 errors whenever possible. Such reparation, however, is usually futile.\n\n-----\n[[include component:image-block name=BLACKBOXWTBK.png|caption=Project BLACKBOX insignia.|width=250px]]\n\n###c75d5d|**Description:**## SCP-6665 is Project BLACKBOX, which is currently responsible for all classified information redaction in Foundation databases. \n\nSCP-6665 consists of a 15m tall, biomechanical, conical apparatus, affixed in a position of vertical levitation within Site-01. SCP-6665 predominantly resembles the shape of an orbitoclast[[footnote]]The instrument used to perform transorbital lobotomies.[[/footnote]], which gradually tapers down from a diameter of 2m to a small point at its end. \n\nAt the top of SCP-6665 -- in place of a normal orbitoclast handle --  is a 2m tall black chamber of unknown composition. Atop this chamber is a large glass tank, which feeds directly into the chamber's only opening. While internal imaging indicates this chamber is hollow, nothing can be seen inside. This nothing is designated SCP-6665-█.\n\n[[[SCP-5666|SCP-6665-α is former Foundation Co-Administrator Malorie Auguste]]]. SCP-6665-α is in a constant state of being lobotomized by SCP-6665, puncturing through its thought. SCP-6665-α has been integrated into SCP-6665; further details are strictly indeterminable. \n\nPeriodically, the tank atop SCP-6665 will begin to fill with a viscous substance from no apparent source; a liquid which is black yet colorful. After approximately one week of continuous use, the tank will be filled completely, its contents are then dispensed into the chamber of SCP-6665-█. The chamber will violently vibrate for the next hour, a behavior which gradually subsides. \n\nFollowing this, SCP-6665-α will vomit nothing out of its mouth, which will then become something. \n\nSCP-6665 causes the instantaneous replacement of classified information in Foundation databases with black boxes or other appropriate redaction techniques, with said redactions cognitively registering only when the observer is under the clearance level of the obscured data. SCP-6665 affects physical documentation by obscuring information with lines of black ink, which appears as if printed directly into the affected documents. \n\nInformation expunged by SCP-6665 is subject to loss of remembrance by Foundation personnel, an effect which correlates to security clearance in relation to information confidentiality. While some information can be temporarily remembered through non-Foundation sources, it will quickly be once again forgotten. \n\nSCP-6665 is prone to frequent errors. SCP-6665 will expunge extraneous information, such as names, dates, numerical values, and locations, even when such information is not entirely classified. This affects all levels of security clearance, and retroactively alters all former revisions of affected documents, causing Foundation recovery of most of this data to be impossible. Due to this, small pieces of data are wholly unmemorable by Foundation personnel of any clearance. Personnel heavily affected by this information removal occasionally vomit nothing, which usually remains nothing. \n\nIt is unknown if SCP-6665 can be disconnected from Foundation databases or otherwise deactivated, as the O5 Council has forbade any such action.\n \n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+++ {{###c75d5d|**Addendum 6665-1 -- Project Creation**##}} \n[[/=]]\n\nOn 2020/20/01, Project BLACKBOX was commissioned by O5-2 with assent from a majority of the O5 Council. This directly followed the deaths of both original Administrators Malorie and Maddison Auguste, the cumulative result of their respective long and arduous battles with dementia. Upon recovery of the former's body and the containment of the latter's persistence, precise plans for SCP-6665 were created, utilizing each Administrators' existing states as the main components of its operation. \n\nThese plans and their justification were sent to an O5 Council vote for approval. \n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"ebbox\"]]\n[[div style=\"border: solid 2px #c47070; padding: 10px 15px 15px 15px; background-color:#291e1e;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ [[span style=\"background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #a12d25, #730000); color: #ffffff; padding: 5px; padding-left: 40px; padding-right: 40px; line-height: 1.9;\"]]{{**Project BLACKBOX Vote Summary**}}[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n\n-----\n\n\nIt was all a matter of time. \n\nMalorie and Maddison were great people, greater leaders. Their bond, it bonded the Foundation into the organization it is today. Peacekeepers, protectors. It's a shame, as it always is, they got old, lost their way, their minds. No amount of love -- personal or otherwise -- can stop the infernal creep of the mind's melting. \n\nWith tragedy comes opportunity, like a phoenix fueling a fire. A new age begins, one of flourishment for our mighty organization. One where we //truly// realize why 'protect' is only the last word in our motto. Securing knowledge, containing absolute reality; what need is protection when the horrors are forgotten? Erased from memory? Purged from thought?\n\nThis will only be the start of the beginning. Our Foundation, the test ground for true security, true containment. We can live burning in the light of all past knowledge, while the world remains sheltered in the dark warmth of the black boxes. \n\n= **COUNCIL VOTE SUMMARY**\n||~ {{**YEA**}}  ||~ {{**NAY**}}  ||~ {{**ABSTAIN**}} ||\n||  || **O5-1**      ||          ||\n|| **O5-2** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-3** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-4** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-5** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-6** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-7** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-8** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-9** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-10** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-11** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-12** ||       ||          ||\n|| **O5-13** ||       ||          ||     \n@@ @@\n||~ {{STATUS}} ||\n|| ##lime|**APPROVED.**##||\n= @@@@\n-----\n\n\n\n[[div style=\"border-left: solid 4px #a12d25; background: #422c2c; margin: 2em; padding: 10px;\"]]\n\"//This is not who we are.

Gosh-- I have so much to talk about--\" \n\n\"What is this?\" \n\n\"Well-- sorry, I know it's work hours, but me and Mal just have a //lot// to take care of still, it's hard to juggle this place and the \n\nEvaline puts on a vividly colorful dress. \n\n\"Is this--\" \n\n\"Hmm? Oh-- sorry, I should've let you finish, that looks great on you. Did before-- does now! Yes, Jennie, are you still getting ready?\"  \n \nJennie walks out of the changing room. \n\n\"Eva!\" \n\n\"I know, right? She-- wait, am I being too much? I'm just... excited? Yes, excited! You both look beautiful. This is perfect, This is going to be perfect. Sorry -- I'm bouncing off the walls -- this is going to be the best\n\nFlower petals dance. A voice whispers over the vibrant chimes of the church organ.\n\n\"Eva!\"\n\nJennie spins in her pew, to the face of Evaline behind her. \n\n\"You did it, you...\"\n\nTears stream, as two dresses stream down the aisle. They are worn in both senses, yet they stay pristine, cascading over settled petals speckling the ground. \n\nOver the black spots of the crowd sit the facadeless facades of things that can only be described as angels, yet despite any previous ravenous malice, they sit in a strained calmness. They are sated.\n\nAs the church organ fades into words and laughter and tears and joy and all else the world could lend to each savorous second, the words of Malorie and Maddison each ring, they each ring a bell, they each ring true. \n\n\"Till death do us part.\" \n\n\"And for forevermore after.\"\n\nA foreign voice to the scenes kicks out from the pews. Skipping the needle on the record, halting the needle sewing two lives together.\n\n\"No, no, what is going on, this-- this isn't now-- it isn't right. The world needs closure, peace, we all do-- //I// do-- we--\"\n\nMaddison looks, she takes his eyes into hers, locking them inside, as she has many times before. Her mouth moves in an unfamiliar familiarity. \n\n\"This... this was never what you wanted. I know. I know it's all so hard for you. When you confessed your love... so long ago, it was hard for me to tell you too, probably as hard for you to hear it.\" \n\nHe cannot look away. \n\n\"But this is how the world is, was, will be.\" \n\nHe cannot look away. \n\n\"You're the only one stuck in the past.\"  \n\nHe cannot look away. Caught in retrospective bliss, the past becomes his only present, stuck shuttered in the closure of a flytrap symphony, orchestrating in the orbits of two fluttering eyes. Eyelid-jaws close, eyelash-teeth interweave, before they open again to the sight of Malorie. \n\n\"You may now kiss the bride.\" \n\nAs they kiss, their lips twirl like propellors in the embrace of eachother's folded wings. The pews whirr alive with floating applause. Nothing is now nothing, as they walk to the plane. \n\n\"Are you ready?\"\n\n\"I-- I won't lie... I'm kinda afraid of heights.\"\n\n\"I won't lie too Mal, I'm a bit of the same. But we have each other, I'll be here, you'll be here. Anything up there-- nothing won't stand a chance against us.\"  \n\nTheir laughter takes them to the stars. As they fly off forevermore into the oscillating blues of the cloudlessly clear sky, the Sun shines like a burning memory. \n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[image plntextnew.png alt=\"I hope it's nicer wherever we land.\" width=\"100%\" style=\"margin: auto;\"]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6664]]] | SCP-6665 | [[[SCP-6666]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** adm.png\n> **Author:** [[*user estrellayoshte]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [/scp-6665 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** BLACKBOXWTBK.png, Mal?
