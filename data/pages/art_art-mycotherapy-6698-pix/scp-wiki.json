But what had ACTUALLY happened was that in middle school I read a very Christian fanfiction about l4d and one of the characters was scared of cockroaches and at that age, I still thought you could pick things you were scared of so I was like \"I guess I'm scared of cockroaches now\"\n\nThen at one point someone asked me why I was scared of cockroaches and just replied that one time a bunch of them came running out of a box and over my feet in the garage. That had happened way before the fanfiction thing and didn't actually freak me out that much but I was way too embarrassed to say it was something I'd copied from a fucking left 4 dead fanfiction. So... when people asked I kept saying that\n\nBut because I kept saying that over and over again I FORGOT WHY I was doing it originally... but kept pretending to be afraid of cockroaches. This lasted until senior year when I re-discovered that fanfiction and went through all 5 stages of grief at once before eventually collapsing in on myself like a dying star and promising to never speak of this again. Like I'm doing right now. Sorry past me.\n\nAnyways this article's really good. I like that the Agent and the D-Class are familiar with each other. I think it should be done more often. It really gives it some weight to it.\n\n+ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy More Art Mycotherapy]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
