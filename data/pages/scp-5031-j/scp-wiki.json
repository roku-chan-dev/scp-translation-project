This was supposed to be out a whiiile back but  I got busy and then kept procrastinating on it. I'm really happy with how it turned out. I really hope you guys enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed making it.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:author-label-source end=--]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-5031-J\n\n**Object Class:** Keter\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-5031-J is to be contained in airtight Iron Cell no. 345 in Bio-Site 59. The structure must be inspected for imperfections on a bi-weekly basis. No other interaction necessary. \n\n**Description:** SCP-5031-J is yet //another// creature that literally just goes around killing people and not much else [[footnote]] Not unlike everything else we ever get to contain nowaydays. [[/footnote]], measuring 2.5 meters in height. Its body structure is humanoid and unnaturally elongated, with disproportionately long limbs and fingers ending in sharp, claw-like appendages. The entity's skin is a pale gray color, with irregular patches of darkened tissue.\n\nSCP-5031-J lacks a nose, mouth, eyes, and redeeming qualities, having no discernable facial features. Despite this, it frequently produces shriek-like vocalizations. Unlike other, cooler anomalies, the entity's primary method of attack involves using its sharp appendages in order to maim its victims by literally just ripping their face off.[[footnote]]In order to learn more about face ripping-anomalies, please refer to: \"Face Ripping and you, a basic guide to face ripping anomalies in the Foundation.\" For information about SCP-5031 specifically, please refer to: Volume 12, Chapter 23 of \"The Comprehensive Face-Ripping Encyclopedia, 15th Edition.\" (Not to be confused with the \"Comprehensive Face Stealing Encyclopedia, 15th Edition.\") [[/footnote]]\n\nAdditional testing was deemed necessary to assess if SCP-5031-J exhibits any alternative methods of attack or noteworthy abilities beyond standard face-ripping, such as the ability to perform a cool skateboard trick after the fact, but no such potential has been found.\n\n**Addendum:** SCP-5031-J was first discovered in suburban neighborhood after having recently ripped the face off 6 people.  A 911 call detailing the entity was intercepted by the Telecommunication Monitoring Department which alerted the Foundation to its underwhelming existence. Despite efforts from Foundation investigation teams, its origin is a mystery, with the possibility of an intriguing backstory for SCP-5031-J remaining uncertain as of yet.\n\n\n-----\n\n**[5031-J-1: Discovery Log TMO Transcript - 911 call.]**\n\n[[include :snippets:html5player\n|type=audio\n|url=http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/jorgemtzb4/AnotherOneOfTheseStupidAssFuckingThings.mp3]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Transcript\" hide=\"- Hide Transcript\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\" style=\"border-radius: 10px; margin: 10px\"]]\n\n\n**[Addendum 5031-J-1: Discovery Log Transcript - 911 call - TMO]**\n\n**[START LOG]**\n\n**911 Operator:** 911, what's your emergency?\n\n**Caller:** Oh my god, oh my god. There's some kind of monster outside my house?\n\n**911 Operator:** Please stay calm, ma'am. Can you please describe the monster?\n\n**Caller:** It's... it's tall, really tall, and its limbs are long. Like it's all stretched out. Its skin– it's gray, but it looks... wrong, like it's all burnt or something. And its face... it doesn't really have a face, it's– it’s just smooth!\n\n**911 Operator:** Where are you right now? Is this monster trying to enter your house?\n\n**Caller:** Not yet, but it was just standing there, staring at me through the window. I’m hiding in my bathroom right now. Oh god, I hear it moving. It's coming closer! //[Silence]// Hello?\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Hi! Your call has been transferred. I’m your new operator, please stay calm\n\n**Caller:** Please, is help coming? What should I do?\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Just, give me a sec. Let me see.... //[Lip smacking]// stretched out, gray, burnt... Ahh. Ugh, I see. \n\nMa'am if you could please tell me: On a  scale of 1/10 with 1 being \"Cuddly Baby” and 10 being “Merciless Killer” how dangerous did the creature look?\n\n**Caller:** Uhm... uhh... what?\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Please answer the question ma’am, it is of vital importance.\n\n**Caller:** Well... it's tall. It has really sharp claws, so like– like a 10?\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Oh... Damn... Ok. Would you say it kills people though?\n\n**Caller:** What!? \n\n**Foundation Operator:** Well, did the monster perhaps give you that vibe that it just really fucking likes to kill people? Maybe a small hint of a particular fondness for... I don't know, eviscerating innocent civilians?\n\n**Caller:** I– I don’t know! All I know is that this //thing// is out there and my daughter is coming home any second. I tried to warn her earlier but the call didn’t connect. I don’t know what to do–\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Fondness for eviscerating… inconclusive. And is it still there, ma'am?\n\n**Caller:** Yes, it's still there! \n\n//[A muffled sound of glass shattering is audible in the background.]//\n\n**Caller:** That was the window! That was the window, that was the– Oh no. //[Panicked breathing]//\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Okay. Hold on for a minute while I confirm something with my supervisor. \n\n**Caller:** What!?\n\n//[Telecommunications Department hold music begins playing.]//\n\n**Caller:** Oh, you've gotta be kidding me– \n\n//[A door opens and closes in the background, followed by demonic screeching and the fairly standard distressed, agonized cries of a small child.]//\n\n**Caller:** OH MY GOD STEPHANIE. IT’S RIPPING HER FUCKING FACE OFF!! OH MY GOD!!\n\n//[The child's screams abruptly cease, followed by a thumping noise.]//\n\n**Caller:** STAY BACK!\n\n//[Sounds of slashing are followed by more screaming, abruptly stopping with a thud. A door can be heard slowly creaking open. Hold music stops.]//\n\n**Foundation Operator:**  Okay ma'am sorry for the wait. Did the monster's eyes carry that recognizable glint of murderous intent? You really can’t miss– Oh right, it didn’t have eyes, did it? Uhh…\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Foundation Operator:**  Ma’am?\n\n//[Silence.]//\n\n**Foundation Operator:** Figures.\n\n**[END LOG]**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n-----\n\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box |author=JorgeMtzb]]\n> **Filename:** AnotherOneOfTheseStupidAssFuckingThings.mp3\n> **Author:** JorgeMtzb\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** \n> **Derivative of:** Squeaky Door Hinge Opening SFX:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TspuiaFX2YQ&t\n> Young Girls Screaming SFX:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEmnSqDQocQ\n> Flesh Ripping SFX: https://www.fesliyanstudios.com/royalty-free-sound-effects-download/flesh-ripping-and-gutting-78\n> Demonic Woman Scream.wav SFX: h_ttps://freesound.org/people/nick121087/sounds/333832/\n> music elevator by Jay_You: h_ttps://freesound.org/people/Jay_You/sounds/460432/\n> Heavy Phone Up and Down_near_mono.wav: h_ttps://freesound.org/people/_stubb/sounds/406233/\ndorm door opening.wav: h_ttps://freesound.org/people/pagancow/sounds/15419/\nwindow breaking.mp3: h_ttps://freesound.org/people/m1a2t3z4/sounds/112213/\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
