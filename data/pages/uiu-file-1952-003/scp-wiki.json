Object was discovered in Utah after civilian reports of a large explosion. Initial team killed by massive amounts of radiation, but brought by Special Agents. Object taken shortly after capture. Location currently unknown.\n[[/div]]\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Suspect Description/Capabilities]]\n\n**Name:** N/A\n\n**Irregularity Cross-reference:** Animal, Canine, Radioactive, Soviet\n\n**Physical Description:** Creature appears to be a terrestrial mutt resembling a terrier, with no notable identifying marks. \n\n||~ Sex ||~ Height ||~ Weight/Build ||~ Race ||~ Hair ||~ Eyes ||~ Identifying Attributes ||\n|| Female || 18 in. || 13.23 lbs, small || N/A || Brown/White || Brown || Intense Radiation, Collar ||\n\n**Capabilities:** The creature is a small dog capable of generating extreme amounts of ionizing radiation without negative effects to itself. This ability appears to be linked to the emotional state of the creature, with minimal emissions during states of contentment or playfulness and maximal emissions during states of fear or aggression.\n\n**Purpose/Motive:** Unknown/Survival\n\n**Modus Operandi:** Suspect is highly mobile, and responds to stress with its anomalous effect.\n\n**Behavior:** Behaves as a normal canine would, but releases huge quantities of radiation when provoked. It does not appear to be able to use this intentionally, as evidenced by the abduction.\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Evidence]]\n\n**A: One (1) sample of hair, white:** Shed by creature during quarantine, does not emit any radiation.\n\n**B: Metal wreckage:** Remains of the spacecraft which it was found in. It is composed of unknown alloys which have been resistant to sampling attempts. Stamped with Soviet hammer-and-sickle symbol.\n\n**C: Photographs:** Three photographs depicting agents investigating the initial crash site, losing their lives to the animal, and unknown third parties, possibly Soviet agents, interacting with the animal.\n> [[=image UIU_1952-003-c3.png]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Bureau Record]]\n\n**Current Status:** Captured by agents, but lost. Current whereabouts unknown. Last sighted in Washington, D.C on 8/11/55. Nonlethal force authorized to recapture, lethal force is authorized against current captors. Believed to be in enemy hands. \n\n**Crimes:** N/A, as animals cannot be charged with crimes. However, the attributes of the beast have caused the deaths of several men associated with the Agency, which the Director has deemed to be an unacceptable loss of security. If applicable, the charges of manslaughter would be applied, in accordance with the Utahan county in which the crime was committed.\n\n**Sentencing:** Indefinite Detention.\n\n**History of UIU Action:**\n\nInitial contact was made when an unknown object carrying the animal impacted the Zion National Park in Utah. UIU Agents were on the scene within 12 hours and secured the scene at that time. Due to the remote nature of the location, civilian contact was minimal. Agents acquired assistance from local contractors and Park Service Rangers to approach and investigate the object. Approximately 30 minutes after contact occurred, the animal began to exhibit deadly radioactive waves, causing the contractors to liquify, and pressurizing the suits to the point that their liquified remains eject from the facial viewing pieces. It is not known if this was solely due to radiation.\n\n3/3/52: After strong amounts of aerial reconnaissance, with assistance from the deceased contractors who had taken photographs at the scene, agents were able to locate and recover the animal. Once retrieved, agents were instructed not to provoke it, and it was taken in safely. Interred in a FBI facility manned by the UIU, who took over full responsibility for its incarceration. Director took personal interest in the utilization and possible weaponization of the beast.\n\n4/10/52: Disturbance reported, involving a possible break-in, after patrolling security note a damaged window. Bureau agents discovered that the animal was missing from its cell and that the observation chamber was heavily radioactive. Isotope isolation work is currently underway. Agents have been assigned to recover this beast, and improve security. Director has given all agents TOP SECRET clearance for their work.\n\nIF CONTACT IS MADE WITH THE ANIMAL, DO NOT PROVOKE OR ATTEMPT TO COME INTO PHYSICAL CONTACT. EVACUATE ALL AMERICAN PERSONS, AND PROCEED TO INCAPACITATE IT USING NON-LETHAL METHODS. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO INTIMIDATE THE ANIMAL, YOU WILL DIE AND COMPROMISE THE LIVES OF YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
