The method by which it speaks is unknown.\n\n**Discovery:** On February 14th 2023, SCP-7782 spontaneously manifested on Doctor Yellowstone's desk alongside a valentines day card with the text \"You are the apple of my eye!\" The following interaction was recorded by security cameras in Doctor Yellowstone's office.\n> **<Begin Log>**\n> \n> **SCP-7782:** Hey there, doc. Some might bake you into an apple pie, but I'd bake you into a cutie pie.\n> \n> **Doctor Yellowstone:** Oh, hello. Thank you, I guess. How did you get in here?\n> \n> **SCP-7782:** I fell from the tree right into your basket[[footnote]]There are no trees nor baskets in Doctor Yellowstone's office.[[/footnote]]. Speaking of which, if I saw you on a tree, I'd climb to the top just to pick you.\n> \n> **Doctor Yellowstone:** I'm flattered, but no thank you. Have you heard of the Smith-Malus anomalous scientific law? It states that \"an apple a day keeps the doctor away.\"\n> \n> **SCP-7782:** Dang. Well, it was nice to meet you anyways!\n> \n> **<End Log>**\n\n**Addendum 1:** As of July 17th 2023, SCP-7782 has made romantic advances towards fifty-three Foundation Personnel, twenty-two sapient SCP objects, and one picture of a potted plant. None of these individuals have reciprocated SCP-7782's advances, and it has not made advances towards individuals who have declined previously. Researcher Wadsworth offered to introduce it to one of the Foundation's artificial intelligences. However, SCP-7782 declined, as the artificial intelligences do not run on Apple-branded computers.\n\n**Addendum 2:** To test how SCP-7782 interacts with mundane objects, a non-anomalous //red delicious// apple was placed in its containment locker. The following was recorded after.\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**<Begin Log>**\n\n**SCP-7782:** Hey, Wadsworth. Who's that?\n\n**Researcher Wadsworth:** That's an apple[[footnote]]SCP-7782 has not seen any other apples since its original manifestation.[[/footnote]].\n\n**SCP-7782:** She's the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I'm gonna go talk to her.\n\n//SCP-7782 rolls closer to the apple.//\n\n**SCP-7782:** Uh, hi. I'm Johnny.\n\n//The apple is silent.//\n\n**SCP-7782:** I, um, just wanted to say I think you're beautiful.\n\n//The apple remains silent.//\n\n**SCP-7782:** Do you want to get to know each other?\n\n//The apple continues being silent.//\n\n**<End Log>**\n[[/div]]\nThe mundane apple remained in SCP-7782's containment locker at its request, and it continued to talk to the mundane apple despite the fact that the mundane apple has yet to verbally respond.\n\n**Addendum 3:** Two engagement rings were found embedded in SCP-7782 and the mundane apple a year following Addendum 2. Nine months after the previous event, an apple seed with a tiny pacifier was found in SCP-7782's containment locker.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7781]]] | SCP-7782 | [[[SCP-7783]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Heart Apple.jpg\n> **Author:** Greg Hartley\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Heart_Apple.jpg\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
