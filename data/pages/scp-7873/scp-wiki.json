Saves time translating.\n  \n//They settle at the kitchen table. Mr. Vermeer has made tea and brought out some speculaas[[footnote]]Dutch spice shortcrust cookies similar to gingersnaps[[/footnote]] and oreos.//\n\n**JACOB:** Do you mind if we record this?\n\n**VERMEER:** Not at all. You’re here to talk about what happened to Janneke?\n\n//Gijs takes a speculaas, which he dips in his tea.//\n\n**JACOB:** Yes. Specifically, we’re investigating ferry safety.\n  \n**VERMEER:** She crossed that river twice a day by ferry for years. I still don’t understand how she could fall into the water.\n  \n**JACOB:** I understand this must be difficult to talk about. The police said they were pulled down by the current, right?\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\n**VERMEER:** Yes. They all were. She was with her friends when it happened. They must’ve tried to pull each other out and failed. At least\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=she wasn’t alone. | content=they’re together now.]]\n[[/div]]\n  \n**JACOB:** I’m sorry for your loss. What can you tell me about Janneke? What was she like?\n  \n//Jacob dips an oreo in his tea.//\n  \n**VERMEER:** You know, kids her age. She was just working out who she was. Trying out different clothing styles, switching favorite music. It all happens so fast around that age, doesn’t it?\n\n**JACOB:** How was she at school?\n\n**VERMEER:** She was – she found it difficult to fit in. Choose to be a loner for a while, but I think she found it hard to make friends. It was like she was looking for the right moment to open up.\n\n**JACOB:** She only recently made friends?\n\n**VERMEER:** Yes. They knew each other for a while, but they really connected during a music workshop they followed together at school.\n\n**JACOB:** Those were the days.  I didn't really make many friends either until I started playing the trombone.  \n\n**GIJS:** I don't think that's what he meant.\n\n**VERMEER:** I could show you?\n\n//They follow Vermeer up the stairs to a girl’s bedroom. An American flag is pinned to the door, covering stickers of horses. The rest of the room is filled with American merchandise, including more flags, posters of famous landmarks, and a pair of cowboy boots.//\n\n**JACOB:** She has another country’s flags in her room?\n\n**GIJS:** [Shrugs] Kids think that’s cool sometimes. I had a Union Jack for a while when I was a teenager.\n  \n**VERMEER:** She recently really got into American stuff. Wanted a Stetson for her birthday, and cooked a turkey for us last November. That’s Thanksgiving, right?\n  \n//Gijs examines a guitar on a stand. The brand logo is covered by an American flag, but the letters '[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3775 Sy(...)mphony]' are still visible.//\n\n**VERMEER:** She'd always wanted to move to America when she got older, to \"make it big in music.\" Felt that the Netherlands was too small for her ambitions. She wanted her music to be heard by the entire world.\n\n//Jacob picks up a notebook with song lyrics in it. He flips through it as Mr. Vermeer talks, the pages visible in front of the camera. The first third of the book contains teen poetry in Dutch, but later entries are in passable English. A picture falls out, which Gijs picks up.//\n\n**GIJS:** [Holds up photo] Is this all of them?\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\n**VERMEER:** That’s her band. She’d printed so many versions of that picture, to try out different artwork for her demo album.\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=Katotje, Manon, Dirk, and my Janneke. | content=Billy, Kate, Matthew, Dean, and my Jacky.]]\n[[/div]]\n\n//Vermeer’s voice quivers.//\n\n**VERMEER:** I was so glad she’d found a group of kids she could connect with. [Sob] I… I’m sorry.\n  \n//Gijs places an arm on Vermeer’s shoulder and nods.//\n\n**JACOB:** I’m so sorry for your loss. She sounds like a wonderful kid.\n  \n**VERMEER:** [In Dutch] I miss her.\n= ##14303a|She isn’t alone anymore##\n//Vermeer turns his head to hide his tears, and steps out of the room. Gijs and Jacob follow.//\n\n**GIJS:** Is it okay if we keep this? It would give the article more personality.\n\n//Mr. Vermeer nods.//\n\n**JACOB:** I think that’s all we need. Thank you for your time.\n\n//Gijs and Jacob walk downstairs. Jacob pauses in the hallway to look at the Stetson on the coat rack, before leaving the house.//\n\n//They walk down the street, back to the car.//\n\n**JACOB:** Did I do better this time?\n\n**GIJS:** Better?\n\n**JACOB:** Better than at the ferry, I mean.\n\n**GIJS:** You did great at the ferry.\n\n**JACOB:** I did?\n\n**GIJS:** You were quick thinking and able to connect with a 14-year-old kid. Bit unconventional, but it worked. It's why I let you take the lead here.\n\n**JACOB:** [Frowning] Then why did you mock the ghost hunting bit?\n\n**GIJS:** I was taking the piss! [Chuckles] You called me old, //lijer//.[[footnote]]Dutch curse meaning: asshole. Literal transl.: sufferer [of illness].[[/footnote]]\n\n**JACOB:** You //are// old, boomer.\n\n**GIJS:** I'm from 1976. That's Gen X.\n\n**JACOB:** Alright, pops.\n\n**GIJS:** [Winces] Anyway. What did you notice?\n\n**JACOB:** He was doing fine until he went to her room.\n\n**GIJS:** Seems fair enough. Seeing all those reminders would trigger me, too.\n\n**JACOB:** Apart from that, Janneke felt she didn’t really fit in, until she went through a change in personality.\n\n**GIJS:** You think that could be related to the anomaly?\n\n**JACOB:** Well, between that and the sudden new friend group, I think it might be.  It could be coincidental, though. Not enough data to link that to an anomaly at this time. The only connection are these other kids. Specifically Billy.\n\n//Gijs looks at the picture a second time, before slipping it in his pocket.//\n\n**JACOB:** Should we talk to the other kid’s parents? See if they have an idea who Billy is, and maybe why the anomaly locked onto them?\n\n**GIJS:** Seems like a plan. The Van Diep family lives about five minutes from here.\n\n**JACOB:** I’ll update the file in the car.\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:acs-horm-lite-source\n|item-number= 7873\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= pending\n|secondary-class= none\n]]\n----\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Site**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Site Director**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Research Lead**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Task Force**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Site 312[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Anna Dubois (Interim)[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Gijs van Oosterbeek[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]N/A[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n##5BCEFA|SwanTran: Description updated by {{Jacob Banks}}##\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** TBD\n\n**Description:**\n\n||~ Designation ||~ Name ||\n|| SCP-7873-A || Billy ||\n|| SCP-7873-B || Janneke Vermeer ||\n|| SCP-7873-C || Katotje van Diep ||\n|| SCP-7873-D || Manon Dijkstra ||\n|| SCP-7873-E || Dirk van de Waal ||\n\nSCP-7873 Victim Profile:\n* Difficulty fitting in?\n* Change in personality\n* Music?

We have arrived at the residence of Ktjah-tot-hey van Deep.\n\n**GIJS:** Kaa-tohw-tjuh, not Chakotay. This isn’t Star Trek. Katotje van Diep.\n\n**JACOB:** We have arrived at the residence of Katutje van Diep.\n\n**GIJS:** That’s… closer. But at least you’re getting better with my name.\n\n**JACOB:** I need to get this right! They lost their daughter, I want to be respectful.\n\n**GIJS:** They’ll appreciate you trying. We’re Dutch, we get it, our language sounds like a coughing fit.\n\n**JACOB:** Kattottche.\n\n**GIJS:** Alright, you want to practice? Let’s practice.\n\n[Several minutes cut for brevity]\n\n**JACOB:** Katotjuh.\n\n**GIJS:** [Chuckles] I am going to get your visa revoked if you don’t figure this out.\n\n**JACOB:** You know what?  I just won’t say her name.\n\n**GIJS:** I’ll cover for you if it comes up.\n\n**JACOB:** European competence to the rescue once again.  Where would we all be without you?\n\n//Gijs takes a sharp turn into a dead-end street with modern semi-detached houses. He parks the car in front of the garage of number 7, blocking in a vintage DAF 66 with an open hood.//\n\n//They get out and ring the doorbell of number 6. A woman in her mid 40s opens the door and welcomes them in. Several mandala pattern tattoos peak out from under the sleeves of her black dress. In the living room, a man with shoulder-length hair and a tank-top is lighting some incense.//\n\n**JACOB:** Thank you for meeting with us, and I’m very sorry for your loss.\n\n**KEES:** Thank you.\n\n**JACOB:** My associate and I work for the New Amsterdam Times, and we’d like to write something in memory of Ka- [clearing his throat] your daughter.  Could you tell me a bit about her?  What was she like?\n\n//Kees looks at the display of pictures of his daughter on the living room table, positioned alongside burning incense and obsidian gemstones.//\n\n**KEES:** Katotje was a force of nature. Passionate about cooking. She wanted to run her own restaurant when she’d grown up. Most weekends she claimed the kitchen for herself. [Chokes up] I miss the smell of her – what was that American stew she made?\n\n**MARIEKE:** Gumbo. She came up with a vegan version. [Squeezes his hand, then turns to Jacob] Katotje was a fighter. Would carry the world on her shoulders if she could.\n\n**JACOB:** I’d love to include that in the article. Could you tell me a little about that?  How did she try to help?\n\n//Marieke smiles wistfully as she touches the jade statue displayed on the kitchen table. It has Katotje's name inscribed on it.//\n\n**MARIEKE:** Last year, she went to a slaughter house with a protest group. They’d made a deal with the workers: they were allowed to give water to the pigs arriving in those hot, overcrowded vans. One last moment of kindness before the slaughter.\n\n**KEES:** She was destroyed after that. Said they were just like Max, our dog. Never ate meat again.\n\n**MARIEKE:** She was always so compassionate. I was so proud of her.\n\n//She holds the obsidian stone on her necklace as she tears up.//\n\n**KEES:** It could be a bit intense at times. She’s done a lot of Extinction Rebellion protests. Schalleveen and Benedam are below sea level, we’re surrounded by levees. Once they break under the pressure of rising sea levels, our homes will flood as well. And she’ll tell that to anyone, whether they wanted to hear it or not.\n\n**JACOB:** She sounds so passionate.  It's a tragedy that she passed so soon.\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\n**KEES:** She was.  It often scared people off. That bothered her. [Sigh] She had so much love to give to the world, but that\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=wasn’t seen through her harsh exterior. | content=was welcomed.]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**MARIEKE:** She was getting better at it. At least I thought she was.\n\n**JACOB:** She found her people?\n\n**MARIEKE:** I thought so. There was a new boy at school, I think he was an American exchange student. Or maybe an expat’s kid? [To Kees] What was his name?\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\n**GIJS:**\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=Billy. | content=They almost forgot. But they're starting to remember now.]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**MARIEKE:** Yes, I think that's it.\n\n[[div class=\"inline-colmod\"]]\n**KEES:** All her friends gave themselves\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:inline-colmod show=an American name. | content=a name to be heard.]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**MARIEKE:** It was silly, but they seemed to enjoy it.\n\n//Gijs pulls the photograph from his pocket.  He nudges Jacob before passing it to him.//\n\n**JACOB:** Do you recognize the people in the photo?\n\n**MARIEKE:** I'm, I-\n\n**KEES:** I do. Those were Katotje's friends.\n\n**JACOB:** And do you remember what their American names were?\n\n**KEES:** That's Jacky, Matthew, Dean, and Kate of course.\n\n**JACOB:** Which one is Billy? Do you see Billy here?\n\n**KEES:** I-I’m not – I\n\n**GIJS:** Kate, that was your daughter’s American name?  I just want to make sure we've got this written down correctly.\n\n//Kees nods, though he seems a bit distant.//\n\n**JACOB:** So, Kate. Got it.  She was a fighter for a greater cause. She sounds lovely.\n= ##183642|Now you say her name. Finally she’s heard.##\n**MARIEKE:** She was. She just needed something to believe in.\n\n**JACOB:** Thank you both very much for this.  I know this is a difficult time, and I really appreciate your cooperation.\n\n//Van Oosterbeek and Banks leave the house. Jacob takes his jacket off and waves it in the wind in an attempt to get the incense smell out.//\n\n//They get in the car and drive off.//\n\n**JACOB:** I think our victim profile is shaping up. Both Janneke and Katotje felt they weren’t seen for who they //could be//.   They wanted to make an impact on the world.\n\n**GIJS:** And they both knew Billy.  //Don't// forget about Billy.\n\n**JACOB:** Oh, yeah, there's something going on with Billy for sure.

Kids weren’t happy with how they were perceived, right? Read up the American names again.\n\n**JACOB:** Jacky, Kate, Matthew and Dean?\n\n**GIJS:** Versus Janneke, Katotje, Manon and Dirk.\n\n**JACOB:** So?\n\n**GIJS:** Manon is a girl’s name.\n\n**JACOB:** [After a long pause] //Oh.//\n\n**GIJS:** On the off-chance that wasn’t handled well, I’ll sit this one out.

They get it the first time, don’t dwell on it!\n\n**JACOB:** I’m being considerate!\n\n**GIJS:** You know how you call us Dutch folk rude when we’re direct?

My mother sat in the witness box, next to Billy, who-\n\n**JACOB:** No.  He wasn’t.  Billy wasn’t there.  Think hard.  Do you remember Daniël?  You used to eat herring after school ended in the summer. Do you remember that?  \n\n**GIJS:** [Quietly] We served herring at the wedding. Hired a food truck from Spakenburg.\n\n**JACOB:** You gave me herring today.\n\n**GIJS:** [Chuckles] It made you gag.\n\n**JACOB:** You bastard.\n\n//Jacob’s camera captures shadowy figures surging from the water.

We’re //cute//. We’re insignificant.\n= ##7d8e94|You don't have to be so small.##\n**JACOB:** Harrit sent me here because they were worried about you. You know how much they were gushing about you when they prepared my laptop this morning? How you got them through the immigration process, how you helped them accept who they are. They look up to you!\n\n//Gijs is silent, staring at the water.//\n\n**JACOB:** And when I logged on, I got a message from Dr. Demir. She hasn’t even met me and she welcomed me to the team. Told me to keep an eye out for the grouch, and that I should count myself lucky to have you mentor me. If you really wanted to leave this place, you would've taken her spot at Site 43.\n\n//Gijs gasps for air.//\n\n**JACOB:** Agent Claessen forwarded the invite for the Vrijmibo.[[footnote]]Vrijdagmiddagborrel, Friday afternoon drinks[[/footnote]] Why do you think he keeps coming back, even though he’s retired?\n\n= ##465e67|They will forget.##\n\n**JACOB:** I’ve been here for only one goddamn day and I have learned more about fieldwork than during my time at Site 873. You trusted me to take the lead here. You saw my strengths and allowed me to show what I can do. I’m not some faceless, nameless number in a massive crowd. I actually get to be seen here. I get to matter.\n\n//Gijs pulls himself a bit closer to the railing.//\n= ##2F4A54|They always forget.##\n**JACOB:** You know how Site 312 is described in the Exchange Program dossier? “A site built by its head researcher, with a tight-knit, dedicated team that stands watch over the lower lands.” You built all that. //That// is the mark you leave on the world. You leave it through us.\n\n//Gijs finally turns his head away from the water.//\n\n**JACOB:** I got the chance to be part of something greater, and I used that to come here. My Dream led me here.\n\n**GIJS:** You’re sure?\n\n**JACOB:** I’m proud to be a part of this.\n\n//Gijs is panting.//\n\n**JACOB:** What do you say, pops. You wanna get out of here?\n\n//Gijs nods and turns around. His hands are shaking. Jacob pulls him back over the railing. They stagger when the ferry moves to the side, and sit down on the edge. A glimpse of shadow is visible on camera, crashing against the ferry like a wave. Neither Gijs nor Jacob seem to notice it.//\n\n//Gijs wipes his face.//\n\n**GIJS:** Your profile didn't mention \"dramatic speeches\" as a talent.\n\n**JACOB:** I'll have to update it.  [Laughing] You almost got yourself killed on my first day. Asshole.\n\n**GIJS:** Must be that American influence.\n\n//They both laugh. Gijs takes a deep breath to calm himself.//\n\n**GIJS:** [Shaky voice] You’re good at thinking on your feet. Identifying what the anomaly was attached to, and crafting an effective countermeasure. I knew you’d pull this off.\n\n**JACOB:** I meant every word I said.\n\n//Gijs looks at Jacob for a moment in disbelief, then starts to tear up. He buries his face in his hands and stammers “embarrassing” in both Dutch and English several times, before being overtaken by emotion again. Jacob places an arm around Gijs’s shoulders and looks over the water until the ferry arrives on shore.//\n\n//There is nothing in the water.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size large]] ##5BCEFA|SwanTran4.6 Update## [[/size]]\n\n##5BCEFA|New file uploaded to the SCP database by {{JACOB BANKS}}.##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 7873\n|clearance= 2\n|container-class= euclid\n|secondary-class= none\n|disruption-class= keneq\n|risk-class= danger]]\n----\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Site**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Site Director**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Research Lead**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 90%]]**Assigned Task Force**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Site 312[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Anna Dubois (Interim)[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border-right: 1px solid #AAA; text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]Gijs van Oosterbeek[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center; width: 25%;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]N/A[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7873/Ferry%20Lek%20Shadow.jpg |\ncaption=The ferry crossing the River Lek between Benedam and Schalleveen. |\nalign=center |\nwidth=100%\n]]\n@@ @@\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Foundation webcrawlers are to monitor Dutch online spaces for references to SCP-7873-A.

They express desire to 'leave their mark on the world', and mourn missing their chance to 'live the (American) Dream’. This desire will escalate and eventually draw an affected individual to a body of water, where they will drown.\n\nSCP-7873 consists of 5 known entities, 4 of which were former students at the Benedam Middelbare School voor Voortgezet Onderwijs[[footnote]]Benedam School for Secondary Education[[/footnote]] in Benedam, Netherlands. SCP-7873-B to -E drowned while crossing the River Lek by ferry on the way home to Schalleveen.

Witness reports describe it as an American boy of approximately 17-years-old, with a 70s style haircut. When captured on visual media, a faint figure resembling a masculine humanoid is visible. Observing this entity while matching the psychological profile has a cognitohazardous effect on the observer.\n\nIn June 2019, Agent Banks led a large scale amnestization protocol, focused on the parents, friends and classmates of SCP-7873-B to -E, to remove implanted memories of \"Billy\". Lead Researcher Van Oosterbeek underwent specialised anti-cognitohazardous treatment as a precaution.\n\nNo new sightings of Billy have been reported since.\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n= ##1B1C1F|Remember me##\n@@ @@\n[[module css]]\n.footnotes-footer {\ndisplay:none;\n}\n[[/module]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7872]]] | SCP-7873 | [[[SCP-7874]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=scalykitty and FlyPurgatorio]]\n\n> **Filename:** Pont over de Lek bij Culemborg.jpg\n> **Author:** jeroen struyk\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pont_over_de_Lek_bij_Culemborg_-_panoramio.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** Lek Ferry Shadow\n> **Author:** [[*user Flypurgatorio]]\n> **License:** Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported\n> **Source Link:** tba\n> **Derivative of:** Pont over de Lek bij Culemborg.jpg; Radium Hot Springs.
