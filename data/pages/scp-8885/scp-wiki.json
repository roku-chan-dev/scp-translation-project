Foundation Web Crawler Portia2 is to restrict all access to SCP-8885 beyond the SCP-8885-1 instances with pre-existing registered accounts. All SCP-8885-1 instances that still retain access to SCP-8885 are to be located, apprehended, and contained.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8885 is an online dating site titled 'Plenty o' Fish,' used by species of aquatic organisms. SCP-8885 users, classified as SCP-8885-1, are a group of sentient, English-speaking aquatic organisms with the ability to access SCP-8885 through anomalous means. SCP-8885-1 instances typically use the site to attempt reproductive activities when such activities fail to be successful in the wild, using SCP-8885 as an alternative.\n\nSCP-8885 was initially created by an unidentified PoI in late 2022 as an attempt to combat declining aquatic biodiversity on the East Coast using anomalous means. However, data suggests that SCP-8885 is not a successful means of accomplishing this.\n\nNon-anomalous aquatic organisms have been found to become SCP-8885-1 instances after acquiring knowledge of SCP-8885's existence, typically through interactions with other SCP-8885-1 instances.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-8885 was first discovered on 12/2/2024 when Foundation WebCrawlers recovered images of Junior Researcher Dr. James Hutson's pet goldfish and apartment online. It was found that his goldfish[[footnote]] Later designated as the first SCP-8885-1 instance [[/footnote]] had registered an account with SCP-8885. Following this, its activities on the site were analyzed and recorded, leading to the discovery of SCP-8885. The mentioned activities are available below.\n\n**Addendum 1.1: Initial Registered Account:** Aforementioned SCP-8885-1 instance's account\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[image  fish1.jpg]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Garry:** 23 [[/size]] \n5 Miles away\n-----\n\n**Home:** United States, California\n\n**Sexuality:** Bisexual\n\n**Bio:** Looking for something genuine, don't try to catfish me haha.

The following was recovered:\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n[[image  fish2.jpg]]\n\n[[size 150%]]**Samantha Willberry:** 22 [[/size]] \n5 Miles away\n-----\n\n**Home:** United States, California\n\n**Sexuality:** Straight \n\n**Bio:** Just here for a quick suck and fuck 😊.

It's grim unless we prepare. My preparations have thus far been inadequate. I will be dying soon, but before I do, it's imperative that this truth does not die alongside me.\n\nIf you are reading this, you may be worthy of carrying this truth and ensuring our survival. The light you seek is within you, my worthy successor. With love and hope,\n\nGood luck.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 1.3: Conclusion:** Using SCP-8885-1 instance \"Garry\" as well as other monitored accounts, the following analysis was produced to determine if SCP-8885 is a beneficial means of combating declining biodiversity to potentially facilitate less restrictive containment procedures.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Open\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n\nUpon concluding the research, it has been found that \"Garry\" is not an outlier in relation to attempted breeding. It's determined that SCP-8885 is an ineffective method for countering declining aquatic biodiversity within its area of effect. Only roughly 25% of matches resulted in successful in-person meetings, and of those, only 25% led to successful reproduction.\n\nIn comparison with leading non-anomalous dating sites, this puts SCP-8885 at a similar success rate in terms of finding a successful mate to Tinder or Grumble. \n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8884]]] | SCP-8885 | [[[SCP-8886]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n\n> **Filename:** fish1.jpg\n> **Name:** File:Gold fish1.jpg\n> **Author:**  לינה אבוגוש\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Gold_fish1.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish2.jpg\n> **Name:** Northern Stargazer.JPG\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Canvasman21 | Canvasman21 ]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Northern_Stargazer.JPG\n\n> **Filename:** fish3.jpg\n> **Name:** Red-lipped Bat fish.jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://www.flickr.com/people/67396014@N00 |\tRein Ketelaars]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Red-lipped_Bat_fish.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish4.jpg\n> **Name:** Monkfish.jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Haplochromis |\tAlexander Mayrhofer]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Monkfish.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish5.jpg\n> **Name:** Head_of_a_pacific_Viperfish.jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://www.noaa.gov/digital-library | David Csepp, NMFS/AKFSC/ABL]]]\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Head_of_a_pacific_Viperfish.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish6.jpg\n> **Name:** Semicossyphus reticulatus Marinepia1.jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Totti | Totti]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Semicossyphus_reticulatus_Marinepia1.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish7.jpg\n> **Name:** Anarhichas-lupus-Atlanterhavsparken.jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Uspn | Bjørn Christian Tørrissen]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 4.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Anarhichas-lupus-Atlanterhavsparken.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** fish8.jpg\n> **Name:** Subaqueous pillow lava, Pearl and Hermes (Expn4917 27329252523).jpg\n> **Author:**  [[[*https://www.flickr.com/people/51647007@N08 | NOAA Photo Library]]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 2.0\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Subaqueous_pillow_lava,_Pearl_and_Hermes_(Expn4917_27329252523).jpg\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
