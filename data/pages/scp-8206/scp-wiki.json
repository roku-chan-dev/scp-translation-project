The entire area has been fenced in, with one gated entry point. This gate is to remain closed, save for a period of time each year ranging from March 21st to June 21st. During this period, the gate is to be attended by at least two concealed Foundation personnel.\n\nAny persons outside of Foundation personnel who enter the gate and move into SCP-8206 are assumed to be the targets of a Nascita event, and are to be tailed by the concealed personnel. As soon as the Nascita event has been resolved, the personnel are to reveal themselves and debrief the subjects. The full debriefing script and parameters can be found in document 8206-H44.\n\nThe O5 council has ruled that due to the self-censoring nature of SCP-8206-2 instances, the potential interference of SCP-8206-1 and the low threat level of SCP-8206 in general, allowing Nascita events to resolve without seizure of the involved persons and SCP-8206-2 instances has been deemed a lesser risk to the Veil than the potential for a containment breach following such a seizure.\n\nMonthly check-ins are to be scheduled with past targets of Nascita events and their related SCP-8206-2 instances. If the subjects indicate a likelihood of reneging on the deal made during the Nascita event, Foundation psychologists are to provide immediate counseling. In extreme cases, amnestics may be applied to subjects in order to remove their memories of the Nascita event.\n\nAs of August 2nd, 1983, the Foundation aided in the opening of the Saint Claire's Protection orphanage and fostering organization in the town of Faranello, located 9 km from SCP-8206. The frequency of Nascita events following this date have dropped by 79%, with no response from the anomaly. Reclassification to Euclid approved, owing to the decreased activity and the self-censoring aspects of the anomaly.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8206 is a temperate forest located in Southwestern Tuscany, Italy. The forest is primarily composed of several local pine species, along with other local flora. Fauna are consistent with the local environment, although it is noted that SCP-8206 demonstrates a higher-than-average population of several insect species in the //Ensifera//[[footnote]]A suborder primarily consisting of crickets and katydids.[[/footnote]] suborder.\n\nPeriodically, SCP-8206 will undergo a Nascita event if the following conditions have been met:\n* The date falls between March 21st and June 21st.\n* The moon is in a full phase.\n* At least one human adult within a 12-km radius[[footnote]]Early containment attempts focused on relocating civilians outside the target radius, but this practice was abandoned after the radius was observed to increase in response until it encompassed a sufficient population. The current 12 km radius was calculated based on local residency to provide minimal threat to the Veil.[[/footnote]] of SCP-8206 both has no living children and desires a child.\n* At least 9 months have passed since the last Nascita event.\n\nWhen a Nascita event begins, the aforementioned human subjects will undergo a series of minor probabilistic anomalies over the course of 4-27 hours that result in them entering SCP-8206. The terrain of SCP-8206 will shift in order to facilitate entry if it is otherwise prevented, primarily through the forest floor spontaneously rising to submerge physical barriers before receding. All current attempts to halt an in-progress Nascita event have been met with failure. After an average of 14 minutes have passed since the subjects entered SCP-8206, they will be approached by SCP-8206-1.\n@@ @@\n\n> **Event Log: Nascita Event 15B**\n> ----\n> **Date:** 5/2/1996\n> **Subject:** Agnese Pacelli, 33\n> **Notes:** Subject had been married to one Giorno Pacelli for approximately 9 years, until his death during a boating accident. When interviewed, the subject disclosed that during this time neither of them had desired a child and had not attempted to conceive one. After her husband's passing, the subject voiced regret towards this decision.\n@@ @@\n\nSCP-8206-1 is an anomalous entity of unknown origin. SCP-8206-1 stands at an estimated 2.6 meters tall, and bears similarities to feline and simian lifeforms. Other primary physical traits include blue pigmentation of skin and fur, bioluminescence, and a human-like face. SCP-8206 is capable of selective tangibility and invisibility, which it uses to avoid capture or detection by persons outside of Nascita events. It is unknown if SCP-8206-1 causes Nascita events, but the entity has been observed to be required for the completion of a Nascita event and the generation of an SCP-8206-2 instance.\n\nOnce SCP-8206-1 has approached the targets of the event, it will begin to converse with them. The entity primarily displays a relaxed, sardonic personality.\n@@ @@\n> [BEGIN LOG]\n> \n> //The subject has entered SCP-8206 in pursuit of her hat, which was blown off by freak winds.

All recorded instances have demonstrated a curious and playful personality, occasionally hampered by their lack of understanding of various aspects of existence.
