SCP-7534 is to be given a regular meal every day[[footnote]] SCP-7534 is also authorized to consume items in Foundation Cafeteria without charge as long as it does not affect his health. [[/footnote]]. SCP-7534's interactions with Foundation Staff remain limited.\n\nSCP-7534 is authorized to accept SCP-7534-2 and activate SCP-7534-3 instances; however, subject is to report the contents of the topic being told on each SCP-7534-3 instance.\n\nSCP-7534 was isolated from 39.272838°N 96.580745°W[[footnote]] SCP-7534 was captivated by Site-68e due to its remote distance from 39.272838°N 96.580745°W. [[/footnote]]. Site-68e could have left SCP-7534 uncontained; however, Site-68e decided to captivate SCP-7534 due to mundane reasons[[footnote]] Item is contained, but the methods and purpose of containment are unknown. Damballah [[/footnote]].\n\n**Description:** SCP-7534 is Adrian Belcher, a 22-year-old Caucasian male of American descent. SCP-7534 possesses dark hair and green eyes. SCP-7534 was captivated by Site-68e on February 21, 2017.\n\nSCP-7534 claims to have been isolated from his family ever since his birth. SCP-7534 claims to have traveled 200 miles in search of its family. SCP-7534 suggests that its family is within, adjacent, or residing in 39.272838°N 96.580745°W.\n\nSCP-7534-2 instances generate throughout areas SCP-7534 is adjacent to. SCP-7534-2 resembles a package containing a note stating that it is intentionally for SCP-7534[[footnote]] All packages contain a note written \"For Adrian\". The note is often written on paper emanating from the 2000s. [[/footnote]]. SCP-7534-2 instances contain Sony Cassette Tapes, designated SCP-7534-3.\n\n**Addendum 7534-a1:** SCP-7534 possesses the capability of activating SCP-7534-3 instances, while other individuals remain incapable of activating such instances. SCP-7534 reports that SCP-7534-3 instances depict four voices of elderly and young individuals when activated, which it suggests that it is its family.\n\nDue to the beliefs of SCP-7534, it left its adoptive parents and roamed a colossal region of New York City in aid of the recovery of its family. SCP-7534 has been receiving SCP-7534-2 instances prior to captivation.\n\n**Addendum 7534-a2:** SCP-7534 was sent to an orphanage after two Belgian explorers discovered the subject inside a cabin in █████ Forest, New York City. SCP-7534 was adopted by ████ Belcher and ██████ Belcher on March 17, 2004, and given the name \"Adrian Belcher\".\n\nOn May 3, 2007, SCP-7534 abandoned its adoptive parents and explored a colossal region of New York City due to DNA test results and the presence of SCP-7534-3 instances. Despite the efforts of SCP-7534, SCP-7534 has never relocated its family. SCP-7534 believes that its family is roaming adjacent to 39.272838°N 96.580745°W.\n\n**Addendum 7534-a3:** The SCP-7534-3 instances observed by Dr. Olin\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ View 7534-3-5 Audio Dialog\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n------\n= **Tape Number:** 7534-3-5\n------\n> \n> = [[image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/garry-corona-7/7534.jpg]]\n> = **SCP-7534-3-5**\n> \n> **Foreword:** SCP-7534 authorized Dr. Olin to observe it while observing a one minute SCP-7534-3-5 cassette tape.

It seems that some information his family gives is redacted and cuts off when they attempt to say that redacted information. I also noticed that his mother was panicked, so I suggest that they are all alive and being held captive by something else... Probably anomalous. I theorize that Adrian's family is reaching out to him so he can help them out. We're lucky that he did not do whatever his family asked him to do.\"// -Dr. Olin\n----\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 7534-a4:** Fifi Delina, the head researcher of Site-68e initiated a 20 minute interview with SCP-7534.\n\n> **Date:** March 17, 2017\n> \n> **Interviewer:** Dr. Fifi Delina\n> \n> **Interviewed:** SCP-7534\n> \n> **SCP-7534 and Dr. Fifi Delina were both seated in the 4-F Interrogation Room in Site-68e.

Why am I here?\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** I conducted a 20 minute conversation with you, and I would like to use this time at its fullest potential. How shall we begin?\n> \n> //SCP-7534 widens its eyes//\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** I don't know. You are the Einstein here, not me.\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** We'll start an introduction, then. Greetings, Adrian Belcher, I am Fifi Delina, but you may call me \"Lina\" for short because I am used to it. Please tell me some necessary information so I will know how to communicate with you.\n> \n> //SCP-7534 sighs//\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Hello, Lina, I am Adrian. I am 22 years old and I usually like to talk to chill people. I like playing games, especially Chess and RPG genre.\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** I see. Note that I may be //strict// with the actions of my interviewees. Alright, Belcher. My first question is how are you feeling here? Are there any requests or suggestions I need to know?\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Okay, first of all, I am //NOT// a Belcher. They horrible pigs!\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** Okay. How are you feeling here, Adrian?\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Eh, it's chill. I don't really care about how the place looks, tho. Just keep a Nintendo Switch glued to my hand and I'm fine.\n> \n> //Dr. Lina smiles//\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** Okay. I was expecting you to... Complain a lot but, I guess you're not that type of guy. Anyway. Why did you leave your parents in the first place?\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Didn't the staff here look into my files and history before you captivated me?\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** MTF-Units did; however, if I'm not wrong, our agents stated that the record relevant to your escape was missing. So, here I am asking this.\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Ah, I see. Well, the simplest explanation for why I abandoned those bitches was because we took a DNA test in school and my DNA did not match with my former parents'. Because of that, I made the hardest decision to abandon them and start a search for my family. By myself.\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** Did those cassette tapes also force you to leave?\n> \n> //SCP-7534 pauses//\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Yeah. Speaking of those tapes, I noticed something very... odd...\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** You may continue. I'm listening.\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Remember that road? That road where I suggested my family was in?\n> \n> //Dr. Lina leans in her chair, she nods//\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** I was so tired and shit, so I decided to rest on that road. When I woke up, there was another mysterious package right next to me. \n> \n> //Dr. Lina nods//\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** And as usual, there is a cassette tape, which you identify as S-C-P seven-five-three-four. I played the cassette tape with the player I brought, and I heard those voices again. Those voices said stuff like \"You're Close To Us\", \"Don't Give Up, You'll Get To Us\", \"We're Excited To Meet You\", and the like.\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** You mean to say that in 39.272838°N 96.580745°W, your //parents// sent you an audio tape in which they say they're there?\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** Exactly! But, there was one problem. After I listened to that tape, I got too excited and decided to search that whole area. There were no signs of them. I don't even know if they exist...\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** Our agents actually searched that whole region. There were no signs of your family. In fact, that area is too warm to sustain life. So, if your parents are really there, they would or already have passed away because of heat.\n> \n> **SCP-7534:** It makes sense, I guess. I just really want to see them again. I have never met them ever since I was born. I don't know why they had to let me go like that.\n> \n> **Dr. Fifi Delina:** Alright, Adrian. I think the time is up. We can-\n> \n> ------\n> \n> = **<END LOG>**\n> \n> ------\n> \n> **SCP-7534 seemed confident while communicating with Dr. Fifi Delina, although it lost focus on some questions. MTF Gamma-5 (“Red Herrings”) was re-deployed to 39.272838°N 96.580745°W to search SCP-7534's family; however, agents concluded that its family is absent or non-existent.
