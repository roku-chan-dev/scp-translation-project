Any radio communication from SCP-5979 must be dismissed as hoaxes from local conspiracy theorists and discredited sources. Live broadcasts of the observable universe must also be censored until such a time that SCP-5979 enters our solar system.\n\nDue to the sheer size and mass of SCP-5979, containment is impossible. SCP-5979 must remain under Foundation observation in the event of any further changes in regards to its velocity and location.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5979 is the designation given to a celestial body approximately 1,200 times the volume of Earth. SCP-5979 is currently traveling at 252,792 km/h and is on a direct collision course with planet Earth. SCP-5979's trajectory adjusts periodically in direct correspondence with Earth's orbit. At this time, there is no known method of obstructing SCP-5979's trajectory.\n\nSCP-5979 is able to communicate through radio waves, which have been translated from German (See ##red|Transmissions##). Attempts to establish two-way communication with SCP-5979 have proven ineffective, as SCP-5979 is either unable or unwilling to respond to outbound transmissions.  \n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Transmissions\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\nThe following transmissions were received by Site-57's deep space communication device and have been translated from German to English.\n\n> **DATE:** January 3, 2045\n> **TIME:** 02:35\n> I do not hear from you anymore. Is everything okay? Have the stars aligned for you, or have you fallen ill from your star's radiation? Are you looking at the same stars that I am? I hope so. I miss you more and more with every passing cycle. Please, I just want to know if you're okay. \n\n> **DATE:** January 16, 2045\n> **TIME:** 12:35\n> Do you remember that time in the Milky Way? It must have been billions of years ago by now. I've never felt anything like that since I was with you. Have you? You're far too important, too busy, to reflect on the memories I'm sure. But they will live on with me forever.\n\n> **DATE:** February 9, 2045\n> **TIME:** 16:45\n> I'm sorry I left you. You told me you were okay with it, but I know you better than that. I hope you can forgive me, starlight. No other planet fits my orbit quite like you did. I never should have listened to Saturn.\n\n> **DATE:** February 14, 2046\n> **TIME:** 1:21\n> It has been too long since we last spoke, even longer since I've had you in my orbit. I miss the way we used to talk. I miss how much you affected my tides, my gravitational pull, even the breeze that floats through my surface. I miss the way the stars made your atmosphere glow. Do you miss me at all?\n\n> **DATE:** August 9, 2047\n> **TIME:** 16:00\n> I've left my system. I'll be there shortly. I love you, and I'm sorry I didn't show it well enough before. Please forgive me.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Update\" hide=\"- Close File\"]]\nThe following transmission was intercepted by the I.S.S. [[footnote]] The International Space Station[[/footnote]].\n\n> **DATE:** August 10, 2047\n> **TIME:** 00:00\n> I loved you too, but you had your chance. I have a moon now, it's time to let go.\n\nThe message did not come from any known transmitter on Earth, and no records of the transmission being recorded have been found. SCP-5979's velocity has since stopped entirely, and its location in the galaxy has remained unchanged.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-5978]]] | SCP-5979 | [[[SCP-5980]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** planet\n> **Name:** Solar Textures\n> **Author:** [[*user Marceline_Raynes]], Solar System Scope\n> **License:** CC BY 4.0\n> **Source Link:** [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5979 SCP Foundation Wiki]\n> **Derivative of:** [https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/ Solar System Scope]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
