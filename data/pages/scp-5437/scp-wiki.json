Standard security and trespassing protocol is enforced.\n\nThe carcass of SCP-5437-1 has been transferred to Foundation Facility Site-40 for research purposes.\n\n**Description:** SCP-5437 is a prehistorical religious complex located ~30 kilometers west of Paraguarí, Paraguay. The exterior of SCP-5437 combines known elements of primitive Fifthist and preclassical Mesoamerican architecture. It is hypothesized that SCP-5437 was constructed some time between 4100-3100 BC, and saw usage until the start of the 3rd millennium BC. Research has shown that SCP-5437's sole anomalous property is its ability to preserve biological matter for abnormal amounts of time, causing it to decay at an excessively low rate.\n\nThe approximate size of SCP-5437 is unknown. The majority of the structure is located underground, and several hidden chambers and hallways have been uncovered behind the complex walls. Aside from these branching rooms, SCP-5437 is mainly composed of a spiraled staircase that leads to a spacious foyer ~86 meters beneath the surface.\n\nColored parietal art lines the foyers walls, arranged in sequential order to display a religious narrative. An analysis of these petrographs can be found in Addendum.5437.1. An unknown syllabic and logographic writing system is engraved underneath the artwork. They remain untranslated, leaving analysis of the paintings contents largely to speculation. The hypothesized purpose of this cathedral area is to serve as a place of worship for SCP-5437-1.\n\nSCP-5437-1 is the carcass of a massive, ophiuroidic entity, catalogued as a Large-Scale Aggressor (LSA). The entity is green in coloration, and has five thin arms that sprout from its center, each measuring ~20 meters in length. SCP-5437-1 largely resembles an ophiuroid, but possesses hundreds of eyes on its central body disk. Dating techniques have failed to provide any discernible information regarding SCP-5437-1's age. SCP-5437-1's skin is incapable of being penetrated, even by anomalous means. As such, all attempts to dissect or examine the biological structures of SCP-5437-1 have failed. No secondary anomalous effects have been observed.\n\n**Addendum.5437.1:** Petrograph Analysis\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶ACCESS ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Petrograph-01**\n-----\n**Description:** An entity resembling [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/nx-03 LSA-Brasil-01] is engaged in combat with an out-of-frame tentacled entity, of which only four tentacles are painted.

At the center of the painting is LSA-Brasil-01, standing over a [http://www.scpwiki.com/nx-03 human settlement]. At the bottom of the calendar, LSA-Brasil-01 is depicted as deceased. Several figures gather around the carcass of the entity, each holding an item associated with occult rituals, such as a human skull, a ceremonial knife, and a cup of blood.\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n**Petrograph-05**\n-----\n**Description:** Scenes of man-made structures burning and being destroyed by LSAs frame the mural. In the center, LSA-Brasil-01, larger than before, is now shown engaging in combat with the LSA entities that were depicted as resting. A thunderstorm is painted above the battle. Beneath this, LSA-Brasil-01 is shown tearing a serpentine entity apart with its tentacles and throwing its body into the sun. Several entities who are not pictured as deceased stand around LSA-Brasil-01. In the final sequence, LSA-Brasil-01 sits atop a large settlement, as human figures venerate themselves before the entity.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.5437.2:** Interview Log\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶ACCESS ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n= **AUDIO LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 1998/04/17\n----\n**Forward:** After [http://www.scpwiki.com/fifthist-hub Fifthist] motifs were observed during the exploration of SCP-5437 and analysis of its artwork, Site Director Dr. Tobias Ithelo consulted with retired Foundation historian, Researcher Emile Metcalfe. Metcalfe specialized in the study of Fifthism for nearly three decades, following the belief systems discovery in 1969. Metcalfe was put on paid leave following an incident in 1991 wherein he exhibited signs of being neurologically affected by Fifthism. In the years that followed, Metcalfe has been given significant psychological therapy and treatment, being declared fit to work in 1997.\n----\n\n= **>>BEGIN LOG<<**\n\n//Dr. Ithelo enters the room. Metcalfe stands to shake his hand, but quickly retracts himself and sits back down.//\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** It's been awhile, sir.\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** I've already been briefed. I know where this is going. Toby, I told you I don't want anything to do with this garbage. Not any more.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** It... wasn't my call. They wanted an expert on Fifthism, you're the closest thing.\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** And what makes you so sure this is Fifthist? I've seen the pictures. Five murals, the corpse of a brittle star. It's surface level, it's superficial, it's not Fifthist.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** That's why you're being called in. We want to bring you aboard, help us analyze this anomaly, figure out what it really is. You have to admit, you can make aesthetic connections —\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** And that's exactly why I don't believe this is a Fifthist creation. I'll come along, but your superiors won't get what they're expecting. Some grand Fifthist revelation about the anomalies' ancient origins. Something so counter-intuitive to the very idea of Fifthism it's laughable. I have to wonder if my work on the subject has even been read, if it's the mere sight of a starfish that's calling me in.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** Well sir, I've read a bit back in Brussels, that was years ago but it stuck with me. What about Hy-Brasil? You've seen the paintings. That's the crocosquid. Five tentacles, five eyes? Come on.\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** I was there. That's why I'm //really// here, aren't I?\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** You were... there? In 1988?\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** Before you ask, my... my incident happened later. I'm alright.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** (//Pause//) I'm sorry to hear that sir. I didn't have any idea.\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** Do you think it's a tragedy? Hy-Brasil.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** Come again?\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** Do you think it's better they had died together, with others?\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** I'm not sure what you mean, sir.\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** You wouldn't, Toby. I guess I'm here for a reason. Maybe you'll come to a conclusion in the coming months.\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Researcher Metcalfe:** You have my assistance. Whatever you need me to do, I can help with. When I saw it... yes. (//Pause//) There's something here, perhaps.\n\n**Dr. Ithelo:** Thank you, sir. How does research head sound? There's about 25 of us here, give or take. Not a lot to manage, it'd take a workload off me. I mean, we can even set your office up in the foyer, if you'd like.\n\n**Researcher Metclafe:** Whatever accommodation allows me to carry out tasks in the most efficient way is fine.\n\n= **>>END LOG<<**\n-----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n**Addendum.5437.3:** Collected Journal Entries of Researcher Metcalfe\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶ACCESS ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n-----\n1998/04/19\n\nDarnell helped me move the majority of my possessions to the cathedral area. I have a bed, a desk, my archives, and all the proper equipment I'd need. I'm still not entirely sure what my purpose here is. I've toured through half of the structure, taking photographs, notes, and placing markers. \"Find a Fifthist angle,\" I was told. Find, or create? I remind myself of the inexplicable ties this structure has to the souls who perished 10 years prior.\n\nAs heaven poured out below, I could not see its eyes or its arms. Despite my life's work, my thoughts weren't on the virus of the mind, or the way it transmutes, or a world above our own. I was faced with the terror of the Aztec, bearing witness to the technology of European conquerors. Of the man who entrenches himself in the world of the anomalous for the first time. Of the neanderthal, seeing beasts larger than he can hunt. I did not think in terms of anomalies and normalities.

Eventful night? I've walked all that we've uncovered, even the curious 'hidden' passages and chambers. Most of my time is spent cataloguing, dating, and observing artifacts we unearth. It's quite comforting work, given my former fields. Maite, a clearly green, kind girl, assists me by bringing objects to my office, which I do not leave for hours at a time. Its situation in between the arches of a long hallway makes me feel as if I've lived here my whole life. I'm surprised the request to move it here was even approved. It's possible, given my tendency to absorb myself fully in my tasks, that previous experience was taken into account.\n\nThere is little difference between this site, and a regular archaeological dig. Like a jungle film serial or comic, I feel as if I'm living out the fantasies of my youth. Instead of the brave safari leader, I've taken the role of the aged professor.

I've put off my duties for the day, as a research head can, to study them. The story they tell is evident. A legion of beasts cast from heaven descend to earth to be worshiped as gods. For whatever reason, they collectively hibernate. Do they become victims of time, or are they awaiting judgement? Upon the arrival of a greater beast, they awaken. A war is waged, and the lesser beasts venerate their new leader, as does humanity itself. I, of course, observe this through the eyes of a historian as I would any religious myth. However, that is a luxury seldom achieved by someone who entrenches themselves in the unknown.\n\nI looked at the corpse.

Maybe to myself, um (//laughs//), probably to whoever is going to transcribe this, and make... and make this into a document. I'm standing in front of the corpse, by the way. I'm sorry, the object (//laughs//). I forget where I am sometimes, and that I have to downplay what this thing actually is.//\n> \n> //I'm Researcher Metcalfe, by the way. My writing's a little flowery, so that's... that's why I'm doing it this way. So you don't get the wrong impression and, uh, you can hear that I'm fine. I got called here because I'm an expert in Fifthism. There's some, um, connection between this anomaly and Fifthism, or so they say. I don't know, honestly, and I don't really care. Because you see — (//scraping noises//) when people think of Fifthism, they have this idea in their head about what it is really and not what it... uh, what it actually is.//\n> \n> //They see the number five, or a starfish, and they think you start talking nonsense, but that's not the case. It never really is. I haven't said or wrote any nonsense. Go check. I'm clearly distressed, but I'm making sense. I think that... speaks volumes about the state I'm in.//\n> \n> //(//distortion//)//\n> \n> //You see the truth is, Kimberly. When Kim, and... when Patricia died that night, I was lying to myself. Would you believe how many people I talked to today? The number of people I talked to today? (//laughs//) I won't even say it. It's unbelievable how much things start making sense when you want them to.//\n> \n> //I'm looking at this corpse right now. This giant... aquatic creature. It's dead, or at least it has been for a long time. What do you want from me? To start saying that it's talking to me and telling me things? That it's alive? That I'm prophetic? That's bullshit. It all is. The reality of... the reality of the situation is that it's dead. Every soul in this temple is dead. There is no beyond, there is no fifth world for you to transcend to, there's nothing. I'm in a sarcophagus, and the death is... it's palpable. It's on the walls, especially.//\n> \n> //(//scraping noises//) Damn it.//\n> \n> //I write like an old man, because I am one. That's why I'm doing this in this way... through this medium. So, in a house of the dead that still, uh, prolongs death, do you know what really scares me? The idea of something coming back. That's why I'm scared of that beast. Because I saw the... the GOC blow it to pieces. I saw its guts splattered across the land, and well, and what used to be the land. I saw all that, and it's still going to come back.//\n>  \n> //Fifthism is... uh, if I had to put it to words, it's the sight of your little girl being crushed by debris while you stand there unable to move. It's a beast that uses these arbitrary numbers and symbols to taunt you. It knows what it's doing by... by having that number of body parts. It's a tomb filled with dead built to prolong life. It's two forgotten societies doing the exact same thing halfway across the world from each other. It's the power to resurrect the dead. It's the power to awaken the sleeping. It's their blood mixing together and the coloration is clearly distinct in parts but... but you're still able to tell them apart.//\n> \n> //It's knowing that there's a reckoning, and running from it with open arms. I fear... I fear for you all. I'm the coward here. I don't want to live in the world you're going to be, so call me weak (//laughs//).//\n> \n> //There are... so many different, um, anomalies that I've seen. How many world-enders have we seen before? There's a lot. It's a little different when you know it's real, and when you know it's about to happen, and there's nothing you can do, and you know that because it already happened once. I'm staring it in the face. If I were you, I'd kill myself too.//\n> \n> //I think that's about it.//\n> \n> (//distortion//)\n> \n> //Chalk it up to the right place, and the right time.//\n> \n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.5437.5:** Incident-5437\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"▶ACCESS ADDENDUM◀\" hide=\"▷CLOSE◁\"]]\n[[div style=\"display: block ; border : solid 1px #444444 ; background :#F5F5F5 ; margin-left : auto ; margin-right : auto ; width : auto ; padding:10px\"]]\n= **INCIDENT LOG**\n----\n**DATE:** 1998/06/27\n----\n[[include component:image-block name=DSC_0350.jpg|caption=A portion of SCP-5437 following Incident-5437]]\n\nAt 00:12 on 1998/06/27, SCP-5437-1 released a large emission of Elan Vital Energy (EVE), killing all personnel stationed at Provisional Site-5437, and destroying the significant portion of SCP-5437. It is assumed this occurred shortly after Researcher Metcalfe created the above recording. Further investigation found Metcalfe's intact, unharmed corpse within the body of SCP-5437-1.\n\nThis incident occurred within the same time-frame of Prometheus Lab's revival of LSA-Brasil-01 and subsequent awakening of several LSA-class entities across the world. [http://www.scpwiki.com/scp-5391 This event is catalogued as SCP-5391.]\n\nAs decided by the Hyperion-5 Committee, SCP-5437-1 has been transferred to Foundation Site-40 for research purposes. Precautions related to the petrographs depicted in SCP-5437 are being taken.\n\nObject class reclassification to neutralized is pending.\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:earthworm\n| first=false | last=false | hub=yes\n| previous-url=/critter-profile-cappi | previous-title=Critter Profile: Cappi!\n| next-url=/reviviscence | next-title= Reviviscence\n| hub-url=/anastasis-hub | hub-title=War on All Fronts: Anastasis\n]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n------\n[[=]]\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n<< [[[SCP-5436]]] | SCP-5437 | [[[SCP-5438]]] >>\n[[/div]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:**temple.jpg\n> **Name:** 8778 XAMAN-HA Mayan Ruins Playa Del Carmen Mexico\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/10966541@N02 bsabarnowl]\n> **License:** CC-BY-2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/10966541@N02/4448810235 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:**foot.jpg\n> **Name:** Tulum Mayan Ruins Mexico\n> **Author:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/20581458@N00 GollyGforce - Living My Worst Nightmare]\n> **License:** CC-BY-2.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://www.flickr.com/photos/20581458@N00/4090191656 flickr]\n\n> **Filename:** aftermath.jpg\n> **Name:** N/A\n> **Author:** stormbreath\n> **License:** CC-BY-SA-3.0\n> **Source Link:** own work\n\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
