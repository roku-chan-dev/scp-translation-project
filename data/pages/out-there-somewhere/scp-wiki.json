The victims were all found with their throats slit by a kitchen knife. A strong, permanent smell of iron impregnates the crime scenes afterwards. Three murder cases have happened in these circumstances in 1999, 2001 and 2006. \"The serial killer has yet to be found\", the police says while rejecting to share more details with us.\n> \n> But I know better. Here's the truth:\n> \n> __**Case #01 - 1999, Concord, Vaughan:**__ Total of five victims. Security footage of Bell Industrial Complex shows a group of workers finishing a round of tire curing, when one of them leaves to go to the bedroom. He does not return after 20 minutes, and two of his worried colleagues go search for him — eventually, the remaining men agree to do the same. They do not come back.\n> \n> __**Case #02 - 2001, Chinatown, Toronto:**__ Total of two victims. Charlotte Gallant and her boyfriend Noah Cote were found dead in their bedroom. Post-mortem analysis indicates they were murdered in their sleep. No signs of forced entry were identified.\n> \n> __**Case #03 - 2006, Ellwood, Ottawa:**__ Total of four victims. Security footage shows Benjamin Miller and his husband Logan Leblanc entering their car with their children Samantha and Liu. The car remains still for a few minutes before being driven to Pinhey Forest, where the family was found dead with minor signs of a struggle.\n> \n> This serial killer may make no sound when she moves to sneak into other places and hide... what if you're next?\n> \n> Happy Halloween!\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##green|**jeff09**## 10/30/2008 05:03:31 #answering #somethingawful\n------\n\nForgot to attach this image...

He told me something a couple years ago, 2004 iirc, that got stuck with me to this day, believe it or don't.\n\nToby was studying at his house, for college and all that. It was 11 PM, October 31st. You know the drill: he began to notice this nauseating scent of iron, but dismissed it — he was too busy, after all. But after some time, he got tired of it. He looked everywhere, but found nothing. \n\nIt was when he went back to his bedroom that he saw her. She had been staring at him through the window all this time. \n\nHe was so freahed out he couldn't even describe what she looked like when he told me this story — he only said that she was smiling and somehow disappeared whilst he was looking at her. \n\nWe agreed to not talk about that with each other ever again.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##green|**yknowsally**## 10/30/2008 22:59:01 #answering #MyStory\n------\n\nThere's something I wanna share as well. I'm from Vanier, Ottawa. It was October 31st of the last year when it all happened...\n\nI was fired from my job two weeks before and my frustration went to the drugs I would find at the local bar. On that night specifically, I was in a bad trip, so when I got back home and that smell kicked in, I wondered if it was really there or if I was just hallucinating. I ended up roaming around a bit trying to look for the source. And God, it was everywhere.\n\nI couldn't find anything, so I just went to my bedrom. I was exhausted. I lay down in complete silence until a sudden creaking came from my left. Keep in mind my closet was very, very small, but she was inside it somehow. One of her eyes wasn't even looking back at me; it seemed blind, oblivious — I don't know how to put it. But she was looking //directly// at me with the other one. \n\nShe had this ghost-pale skin, black lips, dark long hair, no eyebrows, and a couple incision scars across her arms. She was wearing a white jacket and ripped blue jeans and was holding a kitchen knife. But the worst part was her body odor — Jesus, that scent of iron was HORRIBLE, it melted my nostrils.\n\nI ran to the door immediately — thank God I hadn't locked it earlier — and went down the stairs. Meanwhile she made no sound, she didn't even breathe; I only knew she was coming after me because of her shadow.\n\nI slammed myself against the front door with all the strength I had. The moonlight shined upon me and I began desperately calling for help. That was when a young couple passing by rescued me. The shock made me spend the next week at the hospital, because I wouldn't stop vomiting.\n\nSinve then, I go to sleep at around 6 AM and wake up at 8 AM to start my day. A nail falling to the floor is enough to make my whole body shiver. What if she comes back to finish the job tomorrow? There is nothing I can do. \n\nI feel I will never be alone again.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply3\"]]\n##green|**anonymoususer**## 10/30/2008 23:49:11 #answering #art\n------\n\n\nHad some free time to draw.\n\n[[include component:image-block |name=https://i.imgur.com/E13Wua6.jpeg |caption=unnamed.jpeg|width=200px]]\n\n~~~~\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply4\"]]\n##green|**yknowsally**## 30/10/2008 23:56:18 #answering\n------\n\nJesus that's her.
