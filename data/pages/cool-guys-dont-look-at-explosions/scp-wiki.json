You know pyrokinesis is my jam. Explosions are totally cool. Come on, I know you want to watch it! It's got Mekhane in it!

I could spend all day listing the things wrong with this train wreck of a film you have sent me, but for the sake of brevity, I will only list out the most blatantly offensive bits for you. Not because I want you to take this and improve it, but because I want you to really sit down and think about the bullshit you've presented me.\n\n* The explosions. By G-d the explosions.\n* This is incredibly misogynist. The women in the film might as well be objects.\n* Your depiction of the [[[SCP-217|Clockwork Fever]]] is laughable. A cube? It manifests as just a cube? This is pathetically uncreative.\n* Why did you include so many explosions?\n* The Mekhanites are portrayed as mindless brutes amidst a civil war. Yes, the Cogwork Orthodox Church may not get along with the Maxwellist sect, but this is really tasteless.\n* The worst part about this civil war thing is I can't even tell which faction each is supposed to represent.\n* This film depicts the corpse of Mekhane. The CORPSE of Mekhane. Don't you think seeing your deity dead would be distressing to the Mekhanites in the audience?\n* Do you get hard when you see an explosion, Bay?\n\nIn short, this was a terrible filmgoing experience and I refuse to show it at this year's exhibition. You should feel bad for the careers of the actors you will inevitably ruin with this film.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #444444; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n**From:** M.Bay@torchmail.drk\n**To:** nobodysacritic@torchmail.drk\n**Subject:** Re: Fuck's sake.\n\nYou know what?
