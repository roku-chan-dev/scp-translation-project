The weather has almost always affected my mood; even though I love Autumn and the passage into Winter, it always fills me with sadness. That sucks, because these times of year are so beautiful.\n\nI like to think I've gotten better at managing my mood. I catch myself being very mean to the people I love sometimes, and I try to step back and deescalate if I can. I never used to do that, so I think it's a sign of maturity.\n\nThis poem is vaguely about that. Choosing to be kind in the face of adversity.\n\nI got inspiration for this poem way way early in my time on this site, while I was running from the weather to the coast. This and [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/cognitohazard-reception-test The Locked Box] were going to be part of the same poetic epic; a tale about [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-952 Veronica Fitzroy] from childhood to where we meet her in The Trashfire.\n\nThe full tale was... really bad and overly complicated. Before I knew I had OSDD, I also tried saddling Veronica with [*https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-682 SCP-682]'s lore, presenting 682 (who used it/its) as an alternate personality she used when stressed, or when dealing with overtly supernatural circumstances.\n\nI'm glad I cut the epic into these two pages. They're both far more effective that way. I guess if you wanted to look at this as an in-universe story, it's Veronica writing a ballad about 682 -- maybe they're kindred spirits, representing the same response to trauma and abuse but in different ways.\n\nBut what if the world was kinder to them when they first arrived? What if the world was kinder to all of us? Even when the weather is effecting my head, I try to be kind. I think we all deserve that. Treat each other kindly, please. ~[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/beneath-the-floorboards Shuck & Roxy]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]",
