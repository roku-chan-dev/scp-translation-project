Using this data, it is also capable of generating complex and detailed battle strategies both for said other projects and Centre agents to utilize when in combat with Selachian Entities.\n\n**Project Components:** SPC-001 consists of the ERSATS Type ASEL8N Computational Engine, built by the Centre in 1955. For its purpose, it has been supplied all information from the Centre’s expansive database, which contains both highly detailed notes on every observed Selachian species and most projects used to ensure effective combat against them. Several screens, including one within the primary Oracle meeting room, have been remotely connected to SPC-001 to allow for it to easily communicate computed data with the Centre.\n\n**Augmentation Summary:** SPC-001 was originally designed to catalogue previously undiscovered species of Selachian Entities which had not been seen in combat, but whose existence was suspected by data analysts. Through studying data given to it from the Centre’s database, it was proven to be able to calculate the existence of hypothetical Selachian Entities. To this end, it could provide advanced blueprints of their biology and, in some cases, complete genome sequences. It would then list their possible locations on to a variety of screens it is connected to. SPC-001’s hypotheses were observed to be correct 57% of the time.\n\nDue to the efficiency of SPC-001’s previous calculations, it was eventually theorized that SPC-001 could formulate the most effective strategies for combat with Selachian Entities by utilizing its collected data. Following Oracle deliberation, a new sub-project, codenamed BLUE AEGIS, was approved. SPC-001 was connected to more significant external hardware and given a direct channel with the Centre’s High Pugilord to present its ideas for effective Selachian pugilism. The final goal of BLUE AEGIS was for SPC-001 to develop a method to eventually eliminate [[[spc-140 |the Mistaken Beast]]].\n\n**Addendum 001.1:** Documentation\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spc-001-ex/spc-logo-trans3.png) top right no-repeat; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= [[size large]] {{BLUE AEGIS LEVEL 5/001 FILE – ERSATS SUGGESTION-001}} [[/size]]\n\n----\n\n**{{CORRESPONDENCE:}}**\n\n> **SPC-001:** {{yo, wassup}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Oh, hey 001.

Furthermore, can fish even be castrated?\n> \n> **SPC-001:** {{yes fish have balls. you just can’t normally see them}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Okay, but even if they do, how would this help us?\n> \n> **SPC-001:** {{trust me bro, it will. i have a good source}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Who’s your source?\n> \n> **SPC-001:** {{it’s me. trust me bro}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Alright. I guess we can try it.\n\n**{{RESPONSE:}}**\n\nFollowing SPC-001’s suggestion, the Centre purchased approximately 7,000 male tunas. After testing to ensure the fish had not been contaminated by Selachian Entities, they were disseminated to all facilities currently in operation alongside instructions for them to be castrated and hung onto the walls.\n\n**{{RESULTS:}}**\n\nDespite detailed instructions on how to do so, the majority of personnel assigned to castrating the fish could not locate the testes, resulting in them entering a rage-state. Facilities with personnel who were successful in the castration and subsequent hanging of the fish only reported a terrible stench permeating throughout the buildings.\n\nHowever, it was later discovered that a hostile sect of the [[[spc-140 |Sharkic Cults]]] had been planning to purchase the same amount of tunas for a significant thaumaturgic ritual that would have increased the power and hostility of all Selachian Entities within the Atlantic Ocean. The purchase of the tunas at SPC-001's suggestion depleted the local supply, resulting in the sect being unable to perform the ritual.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spc-001-ex/spc-logo-trans3.png) top right no-repeat; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= [[size large]] {{BLUE AEGIS LEVEL 5/001 FILE – ERSATS SUGGESTION-002}} [[/size]]\n\n----\n\n**{{CORRESPONDENCE:}}**\n\n> **SPC-001:** {{yo pugilord i have another idea}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Oh?

We don’t want to shoot them.\n> \n> **SPC-001:** {{no you didn’t let me finish}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Oh, okay. Go on.\n> \n> **SPC-001:** {{the bullets have little fists painted on them}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** …alright, fine. We can try it.\n\n**{{RESPONSE:}}**\n\nDue to the success of SPC-001’s first suggestion being attributed to coincidence, a meeting between the High Pugilord and Oracle to discuss whether to follow SPC-001’s latest proposal. After seventeen hours of deliberation, it was eventually decided to follow through with the suggestion on a small scale in order to both please SPC-001 and test whether its proposal was an effective method.\n\n**{{RESULTS:}}**\n\nEight agents were transported to a beach known to be a habitat for Selachian Entities and given modified AK-47 rifles loaded with bullets that had been painted to have small fists on them. The rifles were heavily effective in dispatching the Entities, but had the adverse effect of terrifying all civilians present at the beach during the testing. The civilians believed the agents to be eco-terrorists and alerted local authorities to their activities. Following successful bribery and bargaining with the law enforcement, the agents were released, but with the stipulation that the Centre would no longer be able to utilize rifles in Selachian combat.\n\nHowever, the day after SPC-001's proposal was followed through with, a recorded video of the incident began spreading on social media, with many finding it humorous. The Centre's online accounts managed to spin the debacle into an opportunity to both advertise the Centre's values and its recruitment opportunities. This has resulted in a 10% increase of new recruits in the past month.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/spc-001-ex/spc-logo-trans3.png) top right no-repeat; color: black; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 5px 15px 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin: 2% 4% 4% 4%\"]]\n\n= [[size large]] {{BLUE AEGIS LEVEL 5/001 FILE – ERSATS SUGGESTION-003}} [[/size]]\n\n----\n\n**{{CORRESPONDENCE:}}**\n\n> **SPC-001:** {{dude i have the best idea to punch sharks}}\n> \n> **High Pugilord:** Are you sure, 001?
