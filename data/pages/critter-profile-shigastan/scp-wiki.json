As for why he's called \"Shigastan\"...I'll explain later.\n\nWhat's so strange about Shigastan? //An excellent question, my dear Watson!// Of course, [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1710-jp| since the July 12th incident]]], the world is abundantly full of the bizarre. Our own little shelter has been in the limelight too, receiving many large donations and five times the amount of requests as before.\n\nObviously, it's not all bad. Thanks to this support, we've rebranded to Wilson's Wildlife Solutions. We’re still expanding, and have opened our doors to find talented people(?) like Mr. Wellington. We were so lucky to find such a person(?) - though I'd be a liar if I said I wasn’t surprised to see his horse-face at the interview.\n\nBesides, our overall goal remains the same. We take care of, care for, and protect our critters -- enthusiastically!\n\nBack to the explanation. You wouldn't be able to pick out Shigastan's quirk just by looking at him. He is skinnier than most horses you see, though. Still, what makes him stand out from the rest are his super senses. Shigastan is very good at finding hidden things. Just as an example, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-vizzie|Vizzie]]], another critter of ours, is very good at moving around without being seen, but Shigastan can find her with ease.\n\nIt appears that Shigastan's talent works with things that people near him want to find. Why, when a needle got lost in a haystack a little while ago, I told him and he immediately found it. He seems like he's always ready to help. Apparently, his talent can also work on people, so if you've got a ninja you need caught, just ask Shigastan!\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 15px;\"]]\n[[>]]\n**History！**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px;\"]]\n\n[[=image http://scp-jp.wdfiles.com/local--files/critter-profile-shigastan/%E9%A6%AC2.jpg width=\"500px\" style=\"border:1px solid #665731\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 80%]]//Shigastan galloping. A photo so spectacular that it could be used for matchmaking!//[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n\nWe first encountered Shigastan in Poland, in 1998. Even after the Foundation and those UN folks managed to defeat that huge deity, the chaos continued. Relief supplies were sent from across the globe, and simultaneously, tons of organizations moved into Poland and its surroundings to give aid and do research. [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/manna-charitable-foundation-hub|The Manna Charitable Foundation]]], the Red Cross,[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/imbw-hub|the Institute for Human Education and Development]]], Doctors Without Borders, [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/beyond-entropy-hub|The Engelbert Corporation]]], etc…\n\nAnd of course, we at the Wilson's Wildlife Solutions were also there! We evacuated animals from the zoos and protected wildlife from the ensuing cicadas. These activities were done by volunteers, but the shelter received a commendation from the Polish government , and we became famous and got a bunch of donations. -- I myself was personally part of a scuffle between [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/do-elwiry|an evil Chopin cult]]]（or the Bloody Chopin Cult, as they called themselves）and [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-pl-052|the ARGUS Corporation]]], and helped prevent an outbreak at the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/s-b-1998|Polish Fungal Research Institute]]], but I won't bore you with the details or you'd likely fall asleep faster than [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/critter-profile-bakugo|Bakugo]]].\n\nWe had rented a room in an old Church of the Broken God camp in Poland, where we helped with the reconstruction efforts, but the camp had a difficult encounter with the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/fsa-data-arc|Logos Corporation]]], so after some discussion, we moved onward to Babiogórski National Park. It was on the way there that we came across [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-186-jp|an abandoned truck]]].\n\nIt looked like a normal truck at first -- Except inside the truck's back was a grassy meadow that seemed to go on forever. There was no driver (I don't even want to think about their fate!), but they'd left some paperwork behind.\n\n[[div style=\"float: center; border: solid 3px #FFFFFF; width: 85%; padding: 1px 15px; margin: auto; margin-top: 10px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n[[table style=\"width:100%\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border: 0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;background:#f0f0f0\" colspan=\"4\"]]\nCargo Information\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Date of reception**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@July 11th, 1998@@\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Recipient\nof delivery**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@ Sushi Dark（Pseudonym under client's request）@@\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Address**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@Three Portlands, 83-24 Prometheus Plaza via Isle of Portland, England@@\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Postage expenses**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@ @@Sender's cost @@ @@\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Sender**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\nToueisha Sisimula Kulau\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Shipping\nMethod**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@ Standard delivery @@\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\"]]\n**Shipping\ncondition**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n--Undelivered--@@/Delivery in progress/Complete@@\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:10%;background:#f0f0f0;text-align:center;\"]]\n**Transmission\nletter form**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;width:40%\"]]\n@@ Paper @@\n[[/cell]]\n\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;background:#f0f0f0; text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n**Shipping number**\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"border: 0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;\" colspan=\"2\"]]\n**MCDE/Bio-H13001304**[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;background:#f0f0f0\"]]\nDelivery\nType\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;\" colspan=\"3\"]]\nFlora and/or Fauna (alive)\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;background:#f0f0f0\"]]\nStandardization\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;\" colspan=\"3\"]]\n2.8m length, 532kg weight, single animal\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border:1.0px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;background:#f0f0f0\"]]\nPackage\nDetails\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;\" colspan=\"3\"]]\n@@@@\n\n\"Shigastan, Omi's Bone Horse\"//^^Where's Shigastan?^^//\n\n@@@@\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n\n[[row]]\n[[hcell style=\"border:1.0px solid silver;padding:0.2em 0.5em;background:#f0f0f0\"]]\nSpecial\nMeasures\n[[/hcell]]\n[[cell style=\"border:0.5px solid silver;padding:0.2em 1em;\" colspan=\"3\"]]\nBy request of the client, please remember these following points\n* Delivery must be alive, to ensure freshness.\n* Please avoid stressing the delivery so as to not spoil the taste.\nTo accomplish these goals, these subspace delivery trucks are manufactured by Tou-HeiHeavy Industries.

Because the truck quite literally exploded as soon as he was freed from the back. Well, I'm of the opinion that us finding him was better than him getting eaten. So we gave him the name of \"Shigastan\" after his hometown (or something like that). Not too cheesy, right? Well as you can see from our other Critter Profiles, we're the kind of place that operates cheerfully with critter wellbeing in our hearts.\n\nHmm. Well, anyway, that's how Shigastan came to us.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 15px;\"]]\n[[>]]\n**Special Needs and Accommodations!**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px;\"]]\n\nAside from his special talent, Shigastan's a normal male horse, so just take care of him like one. However, according to Wellington, he seems very lonely as he stares eastward. Perhaps what Shigastan really wants to find is his home. To the best of our ability, we want to help with that.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #c8e293;padding: 15px;\"]]\n[[>]]\n**Notes about Shigastan!**\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div style=\"color:#665731; background: #d1ed9a;padding: 15px;\"]]\n\nTo combat his loneliness, Caleb from the Terrestrial Team suggested that we find Shigastan a mate. Shortly afterwards, [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-cn-707|a TV station called Olter Base Media]]] reached out to me with an idea for a television series called \"Shigastan ♡ End of Century Matchmaking Program\" (“A name that makes me question my sanity!” said [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/coming-out-to-the-woods|Fae]]]. I hope we can find a good mate for him......\n\nEdit 1999/5/02: //The response has been huge! Our organization received an overwhelming amount of potential mate profiles. With Wellington thoroughly screening them, we've narrowed it down to five beauties for matchmaking.//\n\nEdit 1999/5/02: //The first was a mare from London named \"Amy\". She was intelligent, and Wellington took a shine to her; however, it seems Shigastan doesn't like her. So, unfortunately, the date was broken off.//\n\nEdit 1999/5/09: //The next matchup was recommended by Dr. Wondertainment, a [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1194|Wonder-Pony]]]^^TM^^. She couldn't talk, and Shigastan turned his back on her… What a terrible matchmaking session! Later, I discovered that Dr. Wondertainment may have underestimated the value of life.//\n\nEdit 1999/5/16: //The third was a mare named “[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1211-jp|Inanaki]]]”, who came all the way from Japan. She’s a chestnut-colored girl with a vigorous way of speaking, the apparent daughter of a prominent family, who wanted a child to succeed her. With how energetic she was, I thought she'd be perfect for Shigastan. However, she didn't like him, claiming she “wanted someone with a more vertical face.”//\n\nEdit 1999/5/23: //The fourth（Or is 4.5th more accurate?) candidate was most eager to jump in! Emerging from the forest's Springwater Corridor Trail, [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-805|her]]] body was made of twisted, tangled roots and branches with hollow insides. She seemed a bit temperamental, though Shigastan seemed interested in her (though, looking back on it, we haven't actually been able to confirm if they were female or not). We were ecstatic to have a new critter to care for!//\n\n//But then an OB Media staff member scrambled over after hearing about it, and accidentally touched the poor critter, causing a huge ruckus. The staff member got a lacquer rash, and so he hastily called the Foundation [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/nexus-homescreen|with some device of sorts]]], causing them to take him and the critter away. I guess this is what they mean by star-crossed lovers.//\n\nEdit 1999/5/30: //Now, our next match-up is \"[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-1610-JP|Camille]]]\", recommended to us by the [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/SCP-088-FR|Order of Light.]]] She is an absolutely charming unicorn, with a white coat with some brown spots on the back. However, she seemed pretty sleepy during her blind date, so we had to escort her out. I want Shigastan to feel better, but it's difficult if the other matchup isn't feeling well either!//\n\nPS: //The man who sold Camille to me was [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/koigarezaki-news-20160827|a suspicious mustached fella]]], who was a grifter exiled from the Order of Light ages ago! I tried getting back to him, but he never replied. Was he trying to get rich off this TV show? Unbelievable.//\n\nEdit 1999/6/06: //The last matchup, “[[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-973-jp|Ansei Gou]]]”, was a strong contender! She was another chestnut maned beauty, with a sexy demeanor. She has a great sense of humor, but is also fiercely intelligent. If it wasn't for Shigastan, she'd have one hell of a competition trying to find a suitable mate. Shigastan also seemed interested in her...until the afternoon.//\n\n//Because just as the blind date was about to end, Ansei Gou slipped on some feces and fell over. That's when I found out, for the first time..... that they were a male horse! Now, obviously, love transcends genders. And there are animals that can swap their genders, such as frogs and bears. But their profile clearly stated that they were female, so this is a serious blunder for us. I heard him mutter something to the tune of, \"I'll never lose a blind date race\", but I've become wise about these kinds of things with Camille, so I asked him to leave.//\n\n//By the end of it all, we couldn't find Shigastan a good mate. But I hope that all this commotion has been keeping him distracted so far.//\n\nEdit 1999/6/09: //Good news! Shigastan went out by himself today, and to our shock, he returned with a partner! [[[http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1304-jp|She's beautiful]]], with a white mane and a daintiness similar to a wild thistle. \"I can find precious things for myself, you know,\" I assume he's saying. He found one!//\n\nPS: //More good news happened that day. Wellington is getting engaged to our first blind date, Amy. Apparently, they've been meeting in secret and dating since the day they'd met. How shrewd of him! Guess that means matchmaking wasn't a complete waste of time, right?//\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"wilson-subtitle\"]]\n__For further information about Shigastan, please contact:__\nAddress: 31st North Deerway Avenue, Three Portlands\nPhone: (503)-555-0187\nEmail: info@wilsonswildlifesolutions.site\nVoid: Wilson's Wildlife Solutions! ⁂wilsons-wildlife\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\nSent by: [http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/secure-facility-dossier-site-64 Site-64] [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/on-the-radar|\"Wajima Moyumi\"]]]\nReceived by: Albert Westrin, Aquatic Team Leader\nDate: 2002/7/25\n[[>]]\n\n[[image http://scp-jp.wdfiles.com/local--files/about-the-scp-foundation/scp-logo-signature.png]]\n[[/>]]\n\nIt's been a long time, Al.\n\nSo I've heard that your shelter has a horse that's \"good at finding things\", and so my boss [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-3465|Edgar Holman]]] seems very interested in him.
