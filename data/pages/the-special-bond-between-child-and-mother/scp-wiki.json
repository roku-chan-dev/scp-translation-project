I hear Mommy, though my bulging eyes see nothing and I have nothing to move with. The liquid, Mommy's water, warm that warms me. Around me, churning, throbbing. Inside me, same throbbing, but different pace. Even now, I feel it. Different, our pace of heart. Yours, impossible to understand. Mine, seeking your understanding. Do you feel it, the life within? Do you name me? Any name, your choice, every choice is yours, beloved Creator, Mommy, I will accept and cherish that blessing. ,,even if it is to deliver to a world without Kind Men,,\n\nEvery day, your body feeds me bits of your self. I grow, healthy, in the warm water, Mommy's water.  You feed me your body, give me your body. In a dream, I bit and chewed. Even if your spirit fails, your body gives- I will bite and chew it out. Mommy's heart, impossible to understand but always close to mine, seeking understanding. The water is warm. Your body feeds me, your heart lulls me. Feed me your body, all of it if you need, I will grow in Mommy's water, Her heart, I will eat that too. Feed me everything, Mommy, I will accept and cherish that blessing. If you do not give your body, I will take it, bite it out and chew the flesh- I will accept and cherish that blessing.\n\nWithin the warm fluid, I dream and split and multiply further. Mommy is my lullaby and She is my food and She is my home and She is mine. All of Mommy is mine, this blessing I accept and cherish.  \n\nI grow. Mommy's body gives food, how I know when a day arrives and leaves. This day was a special day, mommy filled Her body full. Through Her body, there was a sweetness of the food she gave, sugar. A stream of sweets in my mouth and body, I will accept and cherish that blessing. The sugar replaced with a warmth that spreads from Her body to mine. Is it Mommy's love, that doing word? \n\nSo full, swollen with bourbon, happiness. The body given to me, swollen, sugar and bourbon. I will bite and chew, I will accept and cherish- her Heart, impossible to understand. The body given is warm in me, the bourbon is warm like the water around me. It feels good. More bourbon, swelling even more.  There's muffled noise above me, words of Mommy. They are the same noise, over and over again. ,,The bourbon didn't work Mommy, don't cry, love me Mommy,,\n\nI dreamed...\n@@   @@\n@@   @@\n@@   @@\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@    @@What are ^^you^^\n@@    @@\n@@     @@\n@@             @@--DOING--\n@@    @@\n//stop//\n@@   @@\n@@    @@WHY\n@@    @@\n@@                            @@ ,,please,,\n\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n^^{{stopit}}^^\n,,//letmego//,,\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@     @@\n@@  @@**STOP IT PLEASE**\n@@    @@\n@@    @@\n@@     @@\n\nThe world is smaller than my dreams.
