If I'm arranging them correctly, they spell out the coordinates for a convenience store in Liverpool, England (or, as the Brits say, a \"corner shop\").\n* An entire clown costume, including a red nose and wig. Notably, the wig has been torn apart and covered in dye.\n* A sealed jug of grape juice.\n* Three baby possums. When I picked them up, they looked up at me and said something in Spanish. I don't know what they said, but they sounded angry.\n* A middle-aged, completely hairless man.

Usually, there's only a toilet or some plumbing, but occasionally you can find one with a full shower or sink.\n\nIf you do come across one, use it. You won't regret it.\n\nA wild bathroom's not like a man-made one. You aren't just dumping your waste in it and moving on. When you shower or pee or wash your hands with a wild bathroom, it's like you're part of its ecosystem, of nature.\n\nIt's like gardening, you give it the right soil, the right water, care and attention, and you feel like you're a part of it -- a part of something real and living.\n\nI've heard if you keep coming back, keep giving yourself to it, you can watch it grow, year after year. You'll see tiles poke their heads up from the ground like spring buds, watch copper piping crawl up a sink sprout, witness the first time the shower erupts into a fountain of clear water.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathrooms/Wild1.jpg\n| caption=One with a new sink, see how the facets haven't bloomed yet!\n| width=550px]]\nThey're beautiful.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##Lightgreen|**ShowerGremlins**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 20 Hours Ago\n------\nthat's explicitly not a room\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##darkgreen|**BathroomGardener**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\nIt is if you make room in your heart.\n\n<3\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# ENTITYone]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nThreat Entity | ##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 21 Hours Ago\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathrooms/threat1.jpg\n| caption=Threat Entity!\n| width=150px |alt=\"threat.jpg\"|]]\n\nTHREAT ENTITY\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# conspiracy]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nI messed up. | ##brown|**ThreeFace**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 20 Hours Ago\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/conspiracy.jpg|\n| width=300px | caption=too much in there now. | alt=\"a photograph of the doorway to a bathroom, taken in a dark room.

But I've spent so long thinking about haunted cisterns and cursed flushes... I think I somehow imbued my own sanctuary with psychic energy. Is that possible?

I smoked my first cigarette in the stalls behind me -- or, at least, where the stalls used to be. They had to tear up that whole half of the room, after what happened. I can still remember the exact spot you had to whack, with the palm of your hand (still got the callouses) to make that vent window on the right pop out of its hinge, so you could wriggle your way out to sweet blessed freedom. I might even know which of my classmates wrote that bit of grafitti that says \"GACY,\" and what their frame of mind was at the time. Standing here in the dust and grime, it's not hard to feel a little homicide in the air.\n\nI grew up in this place -- not the bathroom, specifically, but it played its part -- and all these years later, I still can't forgive it for that.\n\nThe nuns had funny ideas about theology. Something about the modern institution of plumbing really resonated with them: suppressing the unclean and poisonous, pushing it down as far as it would go until you could forget it was ever a part of you to begin with. Sister Adeline started the ritual back in the sixties, they say, and it caught on fast. Here's what we did, what we all did: every time we had an impure thought, every time we longed for something beyond our institutional white brick \"home,\" every time we had what I might characterize as a slender ray of almost-hope, we were to write it down on a piece of toilet paper in black ink and flush it down the johns.\n\nI wish I was joking.\n\nThe things I put into those pipes, man... Some of them were pretty tame, because of course it didn't take much to offend that big jealous fella up in the sky, and some of them make me blush to think about even all these long years later. I had friends who wrote down much, much worse things, things that if they hadn't been kept between us, the toilet paper, and the flushing confessionals would have precipitated some pretty severe lashings (and I'm not talking about tongue-lashings, you understand). That's what I mean when I say that I'm not surprised to see someone came back here with a can of spraypaint and a serial killer's name on their mind. I'd be surprised if some of these kids didn't end up on the evening news, the shit they put us through in here...\n\n...until the pipes burst. All of them. Every pipe in the entire building just EXPLODED, all of them, all at once -- while everyone was away on summer vacation, visiting friends and family. When we got back, there was practically nothing left worth salvaging, because of what came out of those pipes.\n\nToilet paper dissolves pretty fast, and the ink we used was nothing special. Why, then, do you suppose that all the toilets turned out to have been filled with caustic acid?\n\nKinda nice to imagine, in some twisted and perverted way, that buildings are haunted by our experiences just the same way we are.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nlol u doxd urself\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##purple|**sink_or_swim**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nWhat?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply3\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nur a skyler\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply4\"]]\n##purple|**sink_or_swim**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nSo, in your mind, the Skylar Reformatory was a place that reformed people named Skylar into people //not// named Skylar?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply5\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nlol ur right sorz, ur name is diffrent now so ur fine\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply5\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\nas long as u graduated\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply5\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n\ndid u graduate\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply5\"]]\n##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 11 Hours Ago\n------\n\nhi\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# theshining]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nFound one in the wild | ##orange|**NumberTwo**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 18 Hours Ago\n------\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathrooms/FILE_DELETED_red-bathroom.jpg\n| caption=The red bathroom.\n| width=200px]]\n\nLong time lurker, first time poster here.

Did you know Kubrick swapped Nicholson's place on the screen with Charles Grady (played by English actor Philip Stone) 50 seconds into the scene? It's both symbolic of Nicholson's arc as well as jarring for the audience. The red of the walls also relates to the repeated themes of horror, anxiety, and paranoia (we see this in the blood elevator and even Danny's costuming!)\n\nAnd then when Jack enters the empty gold room and sits at the bar, he says \"God, I'd give anything for a drink. I'd give my god-damned soul for just a glass of beer.” Then Lloyd appears at the bar wearing a red suit!

After about 20 minutes of the sound I couldn't keep ignoring it so I got dressed, packed my self-defense EDC (every-day carry if you didn't know) and had a look around. The room was completely empty, but that's not particularly unusual for these types of places. The door was unlocked - again, not surprising. Security isn't really a concern, there's hardly anything to steal. So I slowly push the door open, as quiet as I can, and the noise stops. Pretty suddenly, in fact. I thought for sure there was someone there, but my phone had no signal and the motel reception was shut for the night, so I figured I had no other choice but to go it alone.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/television.jpg|\n| width=250px | caption=The tv was on. | alt=\"A television in a wood-paneled motel room. It's turned on, but there's no image on the screen.\"|]]\nI push open the door, with my rechargeable flashlight and my pen-knife in hand. Nothing. Empty room. The television in the corner is on, but it's just a blue screen. Not even static. Everything else is completley untouched: the beds are made, the cupboards and drawers are closed, nothing out of place. Except – just as the overhead lights flicker on – I swear I see a hand pull back under the bed.\n\nI wait a couple seconds, trying to calm my breathing, then I crouch down to the floor and point my torch under there. Nothing. A couple dust bunnies, some old receipts. Certainly nothing living.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/motelbathroom.jpg|\n| width=190px | caption=The bathroom. | alt=\"A shot of a motel bathroom from the main room.\"|]]\nWith all the lights on, it wasn't really all that creepy, but I'll be honest, I was pretty spooked. I didn't wanna stick around long. I figured I'd snap a quick photo of the bathroom for you guys (cause it was truly horrid lol), then I packed my shit and GTFO of there.\n\nI'm back home now, but I can't get that scraping sound out of my head. I still can't quite place it. Metal on concrete, nails on chalkboard, something like that. I'd know it if I heard it. Not that I ever want to hear it again, of course.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##green|**PurpleGoat**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\ntell us more about the bathroom pls\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# butttouchins]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nOld Country Shithole | ##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 16 Hours Ago\n----\non a trip with my gf to rome. saw this bad boy during a tour, guide said that it was an ancient roman toilet that hadn't been used for at least three hundred years. this is a once in a lifetime opportunity bathroombros. gonne sneak out of our hotel room tonight -- been eating gross italian street food all week in prep for this. will update soon\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/romanhole.jpg|\n| width=550px | caption=all lead pipes lead to roman toilet | alt=\"romanhole.jpg\"|]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 11 Hours Ago\n----\nfirst impressions arent great. its super dark here and theres no security guards, but at least that means no one to disturb my midnight tryst. i brought a flashlight to see what was down the hole, tried shining it down but couldn't see see shit (ha ha). just pure blackness.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 11 Hours Ago\n----\ngotta squat flat-footed to line up m'hole with the hole. reminds me of that time i dropped a fat one in delhi, but without the stench. in fact, it smells kinda nice, like licorice. brought my own roll of tp obv - bidetfriends, find another thread.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 10 Hours Ago\n----\nfinally feeling something, after like 15 minutes. was just about ready to call it quits but i feel like i gotta do this yknow. shouldnt be long now\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 10 Hours Ago\n----\nhaving a lot of trouble dropping a deuce. not sure why, felt like i was gonna pull a ##yellow|xyvhaser77## just before i dropped my cargo shorts. farted a few times but no brown matter yet. will update\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##yellow|**xyvhaser77**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 7 Hours Ago\n----\nit was ONCE\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##red|**OUTHOUSE**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 10 Hours Ago\n----\ni didn't hear it hit the bottom\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##teal|**PLUMBARIUS**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 9 Hours Ago\n----\nShithouse?

There's something weird going on for sure.\n\nI went for my scheduled 11 o'clock deposit followed by a quiet moment of introspection. 5 minutes passed, and I told myself I should get back to my desk. Yet, I didn't. I couldn't bring myself to leave the cubicle. I just sat in my little latrine fortress and killed time. I usually just play on my phone, but instead I asked myself the big questions. I thought about my family, my future, what I want from life. What makes me happy. What makes me sad. After half an hour in solitude it hit me -- my job makes me sad. All day I send email after email with no point or purpose. It's soul destroying. And bros, I'm not ashamed to admit it, I cried. I wept like a baby. The weight which was lifted off my shoulders was incredible. It took me another hour to compose myself and leave the cubicle. When I did, I walked straight up to my boss and quit.\n\nAs I walked away from him I caught sight of the clock -- it was only 11:05. I'd been in that bathroom for no more than a few minutes, yet I //swear// I'd been in there for over an hour AT LEAST! I don't know how, I certainly don't know why, but that bathroom saved me. It reached out and made that safe space even more the safer for me. //It saved me.//\n\nI've been a member of the site for over a year now and I can't be the only one with an experience like this.

I want you to picture it. The swath of swirling, unkempt hamburger meat covering my torso, chest, and back. The slight stench of a newly freed body exploring the most intimate of settings. The hard tile and cracked sinks of my nightmares contrasting with the loftiness of the nude form, plumbing out in the cool air alongside four other bathroom-ready men.

Something I thought might thematically fit well, but then never actually got around to doing because of... well, reasons. But those have also long since faded away, so I might as well share my story now -- before anything else happens.\n\nBack when I lived in the bum-fuck middle of nowhere of southern Indiana, there was this old Marathon gas station that I lived by. The place itself was nothing special -- just another roach-infested, smelly, ghetto gas station with a small countertop at the front. It was a tiny place too, somewhere you'd visit once on a roadtrip and never think about again. It was also the only nearby gas station for several miles, so I got used to making frequent visitations.\n\nThat Marathon gas station also had a single employee-only bathroom -- near the very back of the building, which they allowed the occasional customer to use. That occasional customer being, of course, me, since my naturally weak bladder causes me to have to use the restroom //alot.//\n\nMy first few trips to the bathroom were typical. Random wet puddles on the tile-floor, shredded toilet paper, the entire shtick. It wasn't until my fourth or fifth visit when I noticed something strange. The fake ceiling had a vent directly above the toilet.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/97/Ceiling_vent.jpg\n| caption=It's there. Watching from above.\n| width=200px]]\n\nIt was just a stupid vent. Nothing really special... right? That's what I thought too. But then I realized something peculiar. My bathroom visits started to get //longer.// And not by a few minutes or anything either. It was like, once I //knew// that vent was up there, suddenly it took me over half-an-hour just to get down to business at that stupid Marathon station.\n\nOf course, that's not all. You might also imagine that taking so many trips to shit and piss would make things easier over time, correct? But no, in that bathroom, the opposite was true. I'd spend nearly all of my time trying to just take a quick leak -- and that's not including all the weird sensations and feelings I felt underneath my soft thighs while I tried to dump Pearl Harbor. Almost like fingers were touching me, trying to grab for my ass while heaven and hell collided underneath.\n\nI couldn't understand what was happening in that bathroom. But then, one day, I really saw it... the two beady eyes staring down at me from the above. And then the cruel smile of something horrific. Something evil -- watching -- biding its time to strike.\n\nSomething inhuman, lingering above it's prey at their most vulnerable.\n\nI haven't been back at that gas station since.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##white|**PinkJPe**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 12 Hours Ago\n------\nno that's just hank making sure you're ok\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##brown|**Lomey**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 8 Hours Ago\n------\nthanks hank\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# immaculate]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nWeird Bathroom Story | ##yellow|**TeenageShitter**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 12 Hours Ago\n------\nSo the strangest thing happened to me the other day.\n\nI really really really needed to take a shit in between classes the other day so I rushed into the bathroom I usually use at school. No biggie really. I sat in the largest stall and locked the door.\n\nBut something seemed off. Something was weird. The more I looked the weirder it seemed.\n\nThe paint on the stall dividers was immaculate, no garish vandalism or scrapings. The floor was dirty, but it didn't looked stained with years of piss. The longer I stayed there the more convinced I got that something was terribly wrong. That I'd climbed up to a higher level of reality. That I was defiling some idealized plane with my fecal matter.\n\nWhen I went to wash my hands, the mirrors were polished clean without the usual permanent marker stain. I made sure to scrub my hands extra clean.\n\nBut when I left I was back in the hallway of my school and I was behind some girl I'd seen around once or twice.\n\nSo yeah. It was the girls' bathroom.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# ENTITYthree]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nThreat Entity | ##yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 11 Hours Ago\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/threat3.jpg\n| caption=Threat Entity!\n| width=150px |alt=\"threat3.jpg\"|]]\n\nTHREAT ENTITY\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##Yellow|**higgles**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 25 Minutes Ago\n------\nILL FUCKIN SHOW YOU A THRAET ENTITY\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##Yellow|**plywood**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 15 Minutes Ago\n------\nlol u just did\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply3\"]]\n##teal|**PLUMBARIUS**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 8 Minutes Ago\n------\nmooooom the yellownames are fighting\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply4\"]]\n##red|**__MODERATOR__ HoldOut**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Minutes Ago\n------\nsomething something go to your bathrooms\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# tooclean]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nWay Too Clean | ##orange|**SonofDora**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 10 Hours Ago\n------\n\nSup guys! On one of my urban explorations today, checking out this old nightclub that got shut down a couple years back. Apparently it had some kind of infestation: from what I could find, it seems it was cheaper for the owners to shut it down completely than it was to get the place cleaned up. I'm actually still here rn, so I can't do a full type-up of the history. I'll leave that for later, because it's pretty interesting – apparently this place used to be super popular in the 90's before it was the site of like three stabbings within a month. I digress.\n\nSo I'm here in the club checking out the worn-down dancefloor, seeing if there's any unopened bottles hidden away (no dice). It's a pretty cool spot: the club doesn't have any windows, so even in the middle of the day it's dark enough I have to bring out a flashlight. The acoustics in here are crazy, too. None of the noise from the street make it in here, and my voice barely echoes against the low ceiling and padded walls. Kinda feels like a party no-one showed up to. Smells like one, too - there's some kind of residue behind the bar that reminds me of nights I'd rather forget.\n\nI know I normally write up after-exploration reports on Parawatch, but I saw something you guys would love so I thought I'd pop over and shoot a quick update. Over in the corner of the club, down some stairs and lit up by a fire-exit sign, there's a door hanging off its hinges. I squeeze through, trying not to knock it or anything, don't wanna make too much noise. It's a bathroom, and it's //wild//. Pretty much every square inch of this place is covered in graffiti, which is surprising given it's only been three years, particularly since the signs on the fence outside suggest the club's got a night-watchman. Even the floor has scuffed-up paint marks alongside all the mud and rot that comes with dereliction in this town. Maybe it was already like this before it shut down – an in-joke, a gimmick for people to consider when picking where to go at night.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/tooclean.jpg|\n| width=190px | caption=The Toilet in Question. | alt=\"A toilet in an abandoned bathroom.

Nothing. I get to the end of the row and in the last stall, the toilet's //completely// clean. No marks, no damage, no graffiti. It's like new, there's not even any stains in the bowl. I've attached a picture of the last stall. And that's why I'm here. What do you guys think? Has some psycho installed this post-abandonment? Is it being obsessively cleaned? Is it a //magic// toilet?

I was brushing my teeth in the morning a few days ago, not really paying attention to much, when the fan in my bathroom started sounding off. I can't quite figure out //what// it was that sounded wrong, but it was something. No doubt about it.\n\nI had a go at recording the audio, but I still can't pick up anything in particular that differentiates it from any other fan. I headed straight here to upload it and have a chat, but I have NO clue how we post audio clips here lol. I resolve to keep my ears open whenever I'm in the bathroom, but I don't want to make it too obvious that I'm aware, in case there's some kind of malicious spirit causing this.\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/myfan.jpg\n| caption=Put it through a spectrogram.\n| width=550px | alt=A screenshot of the Audacity program, showing a spectrogram of an audio clipping. It's very loud, with most of the frequencies on display being active. There's no real shape to it, although the high end of the noise dips, towards the end of the clip.]]\nThen this morning, I'm going through the motions, and I hear it again. Or feel it. It's like the fan is itching, or I'm itching the fan, __or the fan wants to itch me__. I know that doesn't make sense, and I wish you could hear it. Will have to figure out a safe place to upload it where it can't get censored by the mainstream media. In the meantime, I've gone and made it into a spectrogram, see if I can pick out anything in the waveform.\n\nI'll be honest, I don't really know what I'm doing. I'm not an audio guy, and I'm not a bathroom fan guy, either: most of my wiki posts have been shower-tile based.

I should warn the weak among you, however -- this story is not for the kind of heart.\n\nLast week, during my voyage to the hell-like, demon-ridden landscape of Florida, I was suddenly imprisoned by Morpheus' grasp during my highway ride. To avoid a meeting with the God of Dreams in such a hostile environment, I ventured to the nearest inn (or, as the kids like to call it, a \"Motel\") and booked a room inside, resting upon the couch within in a matter of seconds. Soon after, I fell into the realm of the unreal, peacefully entering half-existence.\n\nHowever, halfway through the night, the foulest expression carried me out of my ecstatic state. A burning wound inside my stomach, the mouth of forever-hungry gods forced me into the nearest outhouse with a distant promise of relief. And so, resting my body upon a throne I sat, ready to get back to my sleep soon after finishing unpleasant business.\n\nBut that was when darkness engulfed me, filling the chamber with nothing but an absence of life (it had one of those shitty movement detectors that turned the light on and off). In a flurry, I hurried forward, trying to bring Prometheus' gift back to myself, only to suddenly experience the existence of an otherwordly creature within the room's drainage (I'm an empath).\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab:bathrooms/Sink.jpg\n| caption=A direct looking glass into the beast's lair.\n| width=300px]]\n\nSmelling around the once-again-lit room, with my nose full of nothing but wisdom I searched for this peculiar being, eventually coming to realize the rancid sight was coming directly from within the sink itself. With my keen eye I peeked inside, piercing the darkness within as if a sun entered through. And, dear reader, what I found was shocking.\n\nA demon I'd fail to describe as anything but horrid, circling through the pipes of my castle I thought of to be clean just like my soul. It swirled and it moved with its disgusting flesh, barely containing itself inside the drains and fluid buckets as it ridiculed my soul. \"You fucking idiot,\" it said, looking directly into my eyes with the mind of the devil. \"Don't stare at me, I'm stuck in the drains, just fucking help me.\" Not enchanted by its failed spell, I rippled backwards, trying my very best to back off to my suitcase to find my holy weapon against such creatures of the night.\n\nBut, banging on the doors to my new prison, I found that I was locked inside the Bathrooms.\n\nI cried out for help, only for no hero to meet my call. In a panicked attempt to not be consumed by the drain beast, I challenged it to a holy duel in which I'm sure the gods above would assist me, only to be met with mockery of the foulest kind. \"What,\" it said, not even kind enough to support its claim with a question mark.\n\nI ran forwards into the liminal walls around me, trying my very best to get away from this hellish fate I was doomed upon, but to no avail, for the building was quite well-made for American architecture. I attacked the bars of my prison with my fists until they bled, tainting the white tiles of the room with crimson. Before I could strike once more, I passed out.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathrooms/thetruth.jpg\n| caption=The words previously engraved on the walls of the Bathroom now gained new meaning.\n| width=300px]]\n\nAnd then, in a fever of the foulest kind, I awoke on the ice-cold floor of my relief chamber, once again within the standard reality, free of the unreal shackles of the Bathrooms. Carefully and with much caution, I peaked into the rat's nest for a second time this night, only for nothing to come out. Nothing aside from sacrilege words, near-silently terminating within my ears. \"Drain gaang.\" Yes, that's what it said.\n\nLegends say those that venture into this accursed room forever hear the beast speak of its foulest words.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##orange|**the_stoned_rallier**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 1 Hour Ago\n------\n\nBro, are you a church preacher, abysmally high, or just a bad Gesualdo cosplayer?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##lightblue|**DooDooDiva**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 2 Minutes Ago\n------\n\nhey that's my fucking photo i used that first on my post in the thread first asshole\n\nthat's fucking plagiarism you cock\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##red|**__MODERATOR__ HoldOut**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 3 Seconds Ago\n------\n\nThat's it, I've had enough of the shit from both of you.\n\n##green|**bob_the_builder_enjoyer**## and ##lightblue|**DooDooDiva**## have both received permanent bans from the Wiki due to a history of inflammatory, troll-like, and borderline nonsensical posts as shown above by both of them.\n\n[[=]]\n##red|__THREAD CLOSED:__ QUIT CLOGGING THE SITE##\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# craprat]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nCRAP RAT | ##orange|**ApplejaX**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathrooms/toiletrat.jpg\n| caption=AAAAAAAAAAH\n| width=250px]]\n\nHELP HOW DO I GET IT OUT\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##Lightgreen|**ShowerGremlins**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\nPee on it.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##purple|**RealRaven**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\npee on it\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**mxtoiletto**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\nBathroom friend :)\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**spirallll**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 4 Hours Ago\n------\npee on it.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ 🪥 [[# bloodshit]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\nSomething weird is going down | ##brown|**Gecco_Insurance**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 3 Hours Ago\n------\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scpdsandbox.wdfiles.com/local--files/collab%3Abathroomsordered/totoiletpic.jpg\n| caption=There's a ghost in this bitch\n| width=550px |alt=\"totoiletpic.jpg\"|]]\n\nThis is it. I can't deny it any longer. My bathroom is haunted. I didn't want to believe it at first but there is something seriously wrong with my place of shit.\n\nI've been more of a spectator to this community for most of my time here, I thought these were things I would hear about but never see. But now this stuff is happening I can't help but share my experience. It all began a few weeks back. I began to notice a really unpleasant pain in my stomach every time I sat on my porcelain throne. It was this really bad ache at first, like trying to stir a bowl of chalkboard with a whisk made of chalk. I tried to shrug it off but I began to realise that it was only ever when I was at home, the rest of the time my shits were completely normal.\n\nThe more time went on the worse my shitting situation got. My ass was ripping me a new one each time I tried to relieve myself. Sometimes shit wouldn't even come out, it'd just be the constant sound of farts rippling through the air as I desperately tried to push out my shit, to no avail. I've been trying to figure out anything that I could do to try and help my bowel movements: massages, dieting, I've even tried to pick up some basic exorcism skills, but I think this spirit is some nasty malevolent thing.\n\nI'm starting to get worried. Sometimes I end up shitting way more than I probably should, like it just feels like my ass keeps shitting and shitting and shitting. Worst of all, I checked my shit and there was even some blood in it one time. I asked some people in a server I'm in for their thoughts on it but they couldn't really give me the answer I was looking for.\n\nI was hoping I could maybe get some advice here on what you all think I should do.\n\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##teal|**PLUMBARIUS**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | Five Minutes Ago\n------\n\nUhhh OP I think you should maybe just go to the doctors about this one.\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"parapost reply2\"]]\n##brown|**Gecco_Insurance**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | Three Minutes Ago\n------\n\nNo you don't get it.

Should I keep checking it out, or...?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**TeenageShitter**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 5 Minutes Ago\n------\n\nboring\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**TeenageShitter**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 3 Minutes Ago\n------\n\nDid you find the gurgle?\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"parapost reply1\"]]\n##yellow|**TeenageShitter**## | 04/01/2022 (Friday) | 1 Minute Ago\n------\n\nFollow the gurgle back to the bathrooms and fuck this Narnia shit.\n[[/div]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n+++ [# < Page 1188/1189] | **Page 1189/1189** | Up to Date!\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n                     \n[[div class=\"parapost\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n----\n\n+ ##FFF3AD|**IN MEMORIAM**##\n++ 🚽 Lost in the Line of Dookie 🚽\n\n----\n\n+++ **Gone, but not forgotten:**\n\n**##white|420ply##; ##lightblue|BathrubNereid##; ##yellow|blevins##; ##pink|deadeye_dick##; ##purple|Cope_on_a_Rope##; ##yellow|Crapoholic##; ##red|__MODERATOR__ DownstreamDancer##; ##violet|Farrah_Faucet##; ##brown|Flushedaway(not_the_film)##; ##green|GetLostPro##; ##teal|grasp_the_handle##; ##gray| heywatchthis##; ##orange|I_bend##; ##lightblue|LOLoops##; ##green|LORDXVNV##; ##white|OoooOoooOoooOoooO##; ##teal|OverOverUnder##; ##yellow|pipedreamz##; ##yellow|pissant8##; ##cyan|pissant9##; ##chartreuse|pissant11##; ##teal|PlungeBand##; ##green|PM_ME_TOILET_PICS##; ##lightblue|portmanateau##; ##orange|put_er_there##; ##yellow|Roto_Looter##; ##red|Sisternhood##; ##green|septicus##; ##Lightgreen|ShowerGremlins##; ##brown|ShitblockHolmes##; ##brown|shiticus_maximus##; ##brown|shit##; ##orange|SonofDora##; ##brown|SupernovaShit##; ##blue|thedeadlyflush##; ##cyan|__JUNIOR MODERATOR__ Toilet_Humour##; ##pink|Toiletries&Pleasantries##; ##white|tpEnjoyer##; ##green|U-bendosaurus##; ##violet|__ADMINISTRATOR__ WholeDoubt##.**\n\n+ 🧻\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: Courgette; font-size: 150%;\"]] \"When he shall die take him and cut him out in little stars, and he will make the face of heaven so fine that all the world will be in love with night and pay no worship to the garish sun.\"[[/span]]\n\n**-- William Shakespeare**\n\n----\n**Support the memorial fund at [# GoFundYourself.com/GotOffThePot]**\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n-----\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"You Might Also Like...\" hide=\"Collapse Recommendations\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/michael-the-kiler michael the kiler] by [[*user ratking666]].\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/b-wylie-reviews-gato B.Wylie Reviews: GATO!] by [[*user JackalRelated]].\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author= [[*user AnActualCrow]], [[*user Deadly Bread]], [[*user DodoDevil]], [[*user Dysadron]], [[*user Elenee FishTruck]], [[*user Fishish]], [[*user GremlinGroup]], [[*user Grigori Karpin]], [[*user HarryBlank]], [[*user Its a Bad Idea]], [[*user JakdragonX]], [[*user LORDXVNV]], [[*user PlaguePJP]], [[*user R4_EX]], [[*user Ralliston]], [[*user ROUNDERHOUSE]], [[*user Trotskyeet]], all in all ]]\n\n[[<]]\nThis page contains a quotation from //Romeo and Juliet// by William Shakespeare, 1597, which is in the public domain unless he remembered to re-register his copyright.
