It happened so rarely, in fact, that he was always caught off-guard. The feeling took time to identify. Was it gas? Was it nausea? Was he under the influence of some malign... no, no, it was none of those things. He was simply, temporarily, in a good mood.\n\nThings that put him in a good mood, as would logically follow, also didn't happen often. One of the rarest triggers had nevertheless been pulled on this chill spring day in April which had otherwise seemed entirely unprepossessing, its two coincidentally-coinciding holidays aside. Something marvellous had happened as he'd stepped out of the subway at Grand Bend, spotted the car they'd sent to pick him up, and fished out his phone to check for any last-minute messages.\n\nThere had been one, from Harold Blank. His best friend. His //worst// friend. The president, if not hardly the founding father, of the Making Fun of William Wettle Fan Club. A man who prided himself on his intellect, despite possessing a humanities doctorate, and who loved little more than lording it over his accident-prone colleague. Harold Blank had sent him a text message, and wonder of wonders, within that text message Wettle had found a lovely little accidental Easter egg. A //typo.//\n\nIt hadn't had much room to hide.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"recv\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**H_Blank**\nWatch out for the Easter Funny![[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWettle had tried three times during the hour-long ride from Site-43 to Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin to show that glorious error to the agent in the driver's seat. The man had glanced in his direction the first time, winced, and fixed his gaze back out the windshield again without comment. The second time, he'd merely grunted. He hadn't even acknowledged the third attempt. Wettle couldn't remember if he'd offended this particular agent, whose name tag said 'Nicholas Ewell', on his last trip to Sloth's Pit; he barely remembered the trip itself, bound up as it was in an event both too embarrassing to want to dwell on, and not nearly as //memorably// embarrassing as several which had occurred since. So he contented himself with cradling the phone in his lap, observing the visible evidence of his friend's cognitive fallibility, and drafting up potential responses.\n\n\"How's this,\" Wettle said, typing on his phone with short, thick fingers.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**W_Wettle**\nLooks like your the Easter Funny today![[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe hit SEND. It lacked a certain something, and he felt like there was something wrong with it besides, but... well. It wasn't //bad.//\n\nEwell grunted again.\n\nThe message greyed out. Loss of signal, perhaps. Well, that was acceptable. Now he could do better.\n\n\"Okay.\" Wettle scratched his beard. \"Let's go deeper. He meant to type Easter Bunny, because it's Easter. He typed Easter //Funny,// which isn't //anything.// What would the Easter Funny be, if it... was?\"\n\nThis occupied the time until they crossed into Sloth's Pit proper. Wettle always had a hard time wrapping his head around the concept of humour.\n\n\"Aha!\" he shouted, and for a moment admired the agent's resolve in not leaping out of his skin, before continuing. \"The Easter Funny is the holiday mascot for every time Easter lands on April Fools' Day!\"\n\nThe fact that it was even possible for this to happen had never crossed Wettle's mind, even if it had already happened before in his lifetime. He didn't know that it had; he just didn't know that it hadn't, either. Many things happened around, in front of, even //to// him that he didn't notice, so it was possible. But it had happened today, sort of.\n\n\"Easter Monday isn't really a thing,\" Wettle mused. \"It's just a federal holiday. The real deal is Sunday. That's why they think it's fine to send us out on this bullshit, right? We're not federal employees, we're...\" He reached for a word higher up the totem pole than //federal,// and failed to find one. \"...yeah. Still, it's part of Easter, even if it //is// the ass end. That's the angle. //That's// the angle.\" His fingers resumed their narrow hunt-and-peck.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**W_Wettle**\nThe Easter Funny isn't real, unlike your tyops[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe muttered each word as he stabbed it into existence, though there was a minor deviance which he didn't notice at the end. It was closer, but it still wasn't perfect.\n\nIt still wouldn't send, either.\n\nEwell exhaled heavily, and looked out his window.\n\n\"What do you think the Easter Funny brings?\" Wettle asked him. \"Chocolate... jokes?\"\n\n\"We're here.\" The car swung into the approach to Site-87, perched on its hill overlooking the town where tales came to literal life. \"You ready for a walk?\"\n\n[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/saiaepa/SCAsterisk2.png]]\n\nThe tortuous route required for them to access the bottomless pit did nothing to crumple Wettle's spirits. It was Ewell's job to lead, since you could only find the thing once, and Wettle had found it once already; he'd wondered whether this would mean that he'd get lost and be eaten by a hodag or a goat man or whatever, but no, apparently the fact that he was still confused and disoriented when they stumbled into the clearing had been enough to satisfy the precondition. The agent took the drones out of their briefcase while Wettle continued to crow on what was by now the only topic his mind had room for.\n\n\"I bet the Easter Funny brings chocolate eggs with little notes inside. Little notes with jokes on them. Like fortune cookies, only... not.\" Wettle found himself strolling to the plunging edge of the pit, and stepped back again. \"Only the chocolate has laxative in it, right? Or maybe they just choke on the paper, because they //didn't get the joke.// Ha, ha. Because April Fools'.\"\n\nWettle did not care for April Fools' Day. In his unique condition, it meant watching a variety of pranks intended for other people falling flat, then generally bouncing back and knocking //him// flat.\n\n\"Or maybe it's a stand-up comedian. No, wait!\" Wettle assumed an illustrative t-pose. \"A //hang-up// comedian! Like Jesus. A big bunny nailed to a cross, who tells bad jokes. Joke's on you, Jesus bunny! There is no bunny god.\"\n\nEwell was putting batteries in the drones. Wettle walked over, and knelt beside him. \"There's no bunny god, right? That's not a thing?\"\n\n\"Do you have your tablet?\" the agent asked.\n\nWettle frowned. He didn't understand the purpose of this experiment, even though he'd dutifully signed off on it. The Director had passed it down, with a strict set of requirements, and he wasn't paid enough (even after all his years of excellent service) to bother interrogating the man's motives. They were going to confirm that the famous bottomless pit was still, indeed, bottomless. It had experienced a brief period of bottoming-out during Wettle's time in the limelight, back in 2022, and apparently the brass wanted to make certain it had merely been a fluke. \n\nTheir methodology for doing so was obviously flawed, and he had protested, but as usual his concerns had been swept aside without so much as an explanation. He was the Deputy Chair of Replication Studies at Site-43, and although the confusing phraseology suggested otherwise, there was no-one above him in that particular food chain. He wasn't a real Chair, but he was the undisputed king of doing things twice, three times, and more. Only these days he didn't do the doing himself; his bad luck anomaly was almost always sufficient to disqualify him from personally carrying out the tests. Since the 7000 effect had been documented he'd been stuck on supervisory duty only, to avoid contaminating the results. \n\nAnd yet, here they were.\n\nWettle removed his tablet from his labcoat pocket, only almost dropping it into the pit as he did so, and nodded. \"Go for it. But I'm not gonna stop talking.\"\n\nEwell tossed one of the drones into the pit. It sank below sight. The other man fiddled with a small control box as Wettle tracked its progress on his screen. He sat down on the grass, set the tablet down beside him, and pulled out his phone again.\n\n[[div class=\"text-container-wrap\"]]\n[[div class=\"text-container\"]]\n[[div class=\"sent\"]]\n[[span class=\"text\"]]**W_Wettle**\nI'm gonna cruxify you for that one when we get back, Mr. Easter Funny![[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nHe chuckled, then stopped. \"Fuck!\" //Still// the message would not send. He checked his connection. It was fine. He looked up. Clear blue skies. Maddening. Almost enough to wear off the buzz from witnessing a Harold Blank typo out in the wild.\n\nAlmost.\n\nHarry refused to admit that he was capable of making an error such as this. One time he'd even invented an anomaly just to weasel out of Wettle's righteous mockery. This should have been his chance for revenge. It wasn't fair. Even by his standards, it simply wasn't //fair.//\n\nThe drone was still falling. Wettle wrinkled his nose. \"I wonder if the Easter Funny likes being the Easter Funny. I bet it's really tragic, being the butt of a joke like that.\"\n\nEwell tossed in a second drone. They were meant to compare the relative trajectories and positions, to confirm the anomalous nature of the hole's depth. Wettle gave the new readout less than a quarter of his attention.\n\n\"Maybe the Easter Funny wakes people up in bed by telling them bad jokes?\" He'd just remembered that some people insisted April Fools' Day ended at noon, which would seriously reduce his theoretical holiday avatar's window of opportunity. In his experience, of course, April Fools' never ended at all. \"Maybe it pees the bed for them. Maybe it's a big, stupid bunny that pees in your bed. Maybe that's what the Easter Funny is. That sounds about right.\" He spat on the grass. \"That's the kind of--\"\n\nSuddenly, he was standing up. There was something fuzzy all over his face, even more so than usual. He couldn't see, and then, awfully, he could. A massive, narrow, beady-eyed leporine face glared down at him, and then a vast and clawed paw swept across his jaw, and stars blossomed in the noonday sun.\n\n\"STOP TALKING!\" the giant rabbit shouted, kicking Wettle in the stomach at the moment he struck the grass. \"STOP STICKING ME WITH ALL YOUR BULLSHIT! It's bad enough I only get to exist maybe four days every CENTURY, you're gonna make me piss on people's BEDS?\" Another kick. \"Feed paper to //children?//\" Another kick. \"Fucking CRUCIFY me?!\" Another.\n\nWettle's vision swam, but he could still clearly see the rabbit pick up the tablet, and Wettle's phone, and the briefcase full of drones, and chuck the entire mess into the pit, and then follow them down. He was almost certain he saw the creature pirouette as it plunged out of sight, flashing a single taloned digit at them both in a farewell salute.\n\nEwell removed his earplugs, and walked over to offer Wettle a hand. \"That //was// pretty funny,\" he smiled.\n\n[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/saiaepa/SCAsterisk2.png]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[=]]\n**Site-43 Replication Studies Subsection**\n**Experiment Proposal**\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Premise:** Nx-18, Sloth's Pit, Wisconsin, is among other things an engine for the generation of 'thoughtform' beings in direct proportion to the intensity of local belief in their existence. One manifestation avenue of interest is holiday traditions; after the 2013 [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/chapter-1-corvophobia 'turkey golem'/'Thanksgivukkah' incident], the Department of Nexological Studies has expressed interest in the possibility of replicable hybrid occurrences.\n\nDr. William Wallace Wettle, Deputy Chair of Replication Studies and [[[SCP-7000]]], experiences an intense constellation of negative probability effects on and around his person. On a [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/not-my-sloths-not-my-pit prior visit] to Nx-18, Dr. Wettle improbably [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/if-you-don-t-know-the-words encountered] one such thoughtform (Chapman-392, \"The Hum\") which had not been encountered for a long period of time and had been believed neutralized. It is hypothesized that this entity was in fact brought back into existence by the confluence of these two distinct anomalies and their interaction.\n\nIf there is a correlation, it should be possible to prove via the following experimental procedure.\n\n**Procedure:** 1. Introduce a promising thoughtform concept to Dr. Wettle, in a manner irresistible to his peculiar psychological makeup; 2. Arrange for Dr. Wettle's transport to Nx-18; 3. Isolate Dr. Wettle's ruminations on the concept to his person alone, 4. Observe the resultant manifestation, if any.\n\n**Experiment Lead:** Dr. Harold Blank.\n\n----\n\n**Results:** Hypothesis holds.\n\n**Followup:** Next St. Patrick's Day/Christmas Islands Labour Day, we will attempt to induce the creation of \"Laborechaun\" with Dr. Wettle's unwitting aid.\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=image http://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/harry-blank-2/AFD2024.jpg]]\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div]]\n[[=]]\n**[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/the-s-c-plastics-hub Hub]**\n\n[[div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n> **Filename:** AFD2024.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user HarryBlank]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> \n> Reference materials were created by the author using [https://www.daz3d.com/ Daz Studio].
