He's an acquaintance of **##7AB0C4|[an acquaintance whose name you know who is a bit outside your social circle]##**.\n\nThis is how you get into the Court of High Spring.\n\nFirst off, you need to climb. It doesn't really matter how you 'climb', but you have to climb in some way. Can be literal climbing, or something metaphorical like climbing the social ladder. All that matters is that you want to reach the Court of High Spring while doing so. My friend did it by **##7AB0C4|[doing something that would be hard for you to replicate]##**.\n\nSure enough, the boundary was crossed. It still looked a bit like **##7AB0C4|[the environment the friend started the climb in]##**, but there were plants intermixed. It was dark, from the trees above blocking the sun and [[[sc-05-321-05-335|there was no longer a ground below]]]. There are Fae here.\n\nMy friend was greeted by a [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nbut their call was answered. \"**##c29b0c|Did you not expect my attention?##**\", asked the voice in the woods. In truth, the visitors did not think they would have been heart. \"So can we do it? Can we be Namesmiths?\" The Authority of High Spring descended upon its future subjects. \"**##c29b0c|As springazgeyne Names are birthed once more.##**\" Sure enough before their eyes all tools necessary for the trade formed. Hurridly the future\n[[/span]]**Namesmith**[[/span]].\n\n\"What do you want from Spring?\", he asked. \"To change your Name, create a new one?\"\n\nMy friend responded. \"What price would I pay?\"\n\n\"One hardship\", was the answer. \"But it does not seem to be what you truly want.\"\n\nAnd so my friend climbed on. \n\nThe woods became lighter and more sun came through from above. In the distance the skyline of **##7AB0C4|[a city close to you. The friend is from there.]##** was visible. There were more Fae here. Some were gardening, while others were **##7AB0C4|[doing activities that both you and the speaker are familiar with from your shared surroundings]##**.\n\nMy friend was greeted by a [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nand the Fae Queen had died in it. Could such a place still serve as a garden? Would it have the nourishment for new flowers to bloom? No, a new garden must be built. One closer to the sun, with fresher air and Gardeners to tend to it. The old garden could serve as earth for what came after it. Here flowers could bloom, surrounded by\n[[/span]]**Gardener**[[/span]].\n\n\"What do you want from Spring?\", she asked. \"To change your Garden, create a new one?\"\n\nMy friend responded. \"What price would I pay?\"\n\n\"Hardships upon hardships\", was the answer. \"But it does not seem to be what you truly want.\"\n\nAnd so my friend climbed on.\n\nMy friend would not climb higher. The air was light, the skyline was gone, and beneath was the whole world. The trees stretched ever closer to the sun, though there was no way to climb them still. Though railways were growing out of the trees. Between them was a train station in **##7AB0C4|[various states of construction, depending on when this tale was heard. Most recently it was halfway done]##**.\n\nA swarm of butterflies formed into four golden spiders attached to each other, the foremost one with a flower on its head. The [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nthat the competition had never concluded, with the nameless forest having been burned and then destroyed by the Impasse. Who would rule the new Spring Court sprouted from it? Multiple candidates were still alive and interested in the race to the throne. \"**##c29b0c|Only I persist.##**\" said the last candidate still in the forest. \"**##c29b0c|The last two candidates will Become as well. Yet only I will lead the Climbing Woods.##** So spoke the newly ordained Climbing Monarch and as springazgeyne the new forest Became of Spring. It took not long for its new residents to see the truth in their monarchs words. Only High Spring would be their duty, the others\n[[/span]]**Climbing Monarch**[[/span]].\n\n\"**##c29b0c|Is this your Spring?##**\" they asked. \"**##c29b0c|To change the World?##**\"\n\nMy friend responded. \"What price would I pay?\"\n\n\"**##c29b0c|The World cannot be changed by one.##**\", was the answer. \"**##c29b0c|It is outside your ambitions.##**\"\n\n**##7AB0C4|[One of the three rejections in Name, Garden and World will instead be replaced with \"while it does seem to interest you, it is best to climb on for now.\" or in the case of the Climbing Monarch's rejection with \"Gather more.\"]##**\n\n\n**##7AB0C4|[The friend and the Climbing Monarch will climb back or stay at the level which would be of most interest to you. Here the Climbing Monarch will give advice in their own way about a problem of the friend that is similar to a problem you might seek out the Court of High Spring for.]##**\n\n\"**##c29b0c|The hardships are little compared to before.##**\" finished the Climbing Monarch. \"**##c29b0c|This is not an age fit for war.##**\"\n\nThe authority of high spring then proceeded to lose some of their legs while the remaining legs grew shoes. They ran away on the not yet finished railroad tracks.\n\nAnd that's about what happened. But enough about my friend, what's been happening in your life?\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[size 80%]]//This story appeared on various forums at the spring equinox, only some of which were gaming-related and none to the game the guide is about.

[[/span]]**Will-O-Wisp**[[/span]] posted on 2022-03-20||\n[[/>]]\n\nFirst off this is only a guide about how to transfer something from Spring to Summer using the Late Spring Court. It is not a guide on how to transfer something from Summer to Spring or how to deal with dream connections when the First Guest attempts to do that for you. Those guides can be found among other [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nSorry, but there wouldn't be any fun in it if you just found it all just by stumbling on one, no? In this age, I'm sure someone collects all my posts to the paths for you to find without much effort of your own. So I better do my best, they're still tough nuts to crack. I'm sure you'll be able to follow my trail if you're really desperate. Consider this a freebie!\n[[/span]]**posts to the paths**[[/span]] and are linked as appropriate. \n\nYou can skip this guide entirely and make your case to Summer directly, but going through Late Spring first is recommended.\n\nYou should be familiar with [[[SCP-6471|A Midsummer Night's Game Online]]] and have the \"A Piece of Summer\" Quest finished. It helps your case if you choose a website/territory for your first sun anchor placement that is related to what you want to do.\n\nMake your way to the Twilight Castle and enter the floor of Springazgeyne. The door to this floor only opens if you are serious about this. As soon as you go through the door **__there is no turning back__**. Exiting the game until all trials are done will result in the **__permanent denial__** of your case barring exceptional circumstances. You will also lose your username, but that should really come as no surprise if you're in Twilight Castle. \n\nOnce you've entered, the [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nWhat a handsome fellow! Shame, he is always so busy. Did you know that players very rarely actually meet the First Guest? If it's as part of the normal game quests he'll likely just put a Doppelgänger to the job unless the player piques his interest. Not like a lot of people play the game for the game nowadays. Which is quite unfair, we put a lot of work into it, you know?\n[[/span]]**First Guest**[[/span]] will greet you. This is normal. It means that you will be under more scrutiny, but that is par for the course for a transfer to Summer. In the rare case where it's super clear your thing will transfer to Summer, you'll be dealing with a lesser Guest instead.\n\nAfter pleasantries are exchanged (I don't have to tell you that presentation also matters for your case), the First Guest will present you with your first trial: The Proof of Springbirth.\n\nHere the First Guest will interrogate you about what [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nMany choose their name. Some succeed if they were famous before. Idiots instead choose themselves. They all fail. Just as those who choose their company as their practice of being to be transferred for Summer. As if most mortal institutions were any fit for summer. Perhaps Late Spring was always their real aim? No, it is all the methods and processes where the curiosity for success lies. \n[[/span]]**practice of being**[[/span]] you want to transfer to Summer. The answer is supposed to come in the form of creating parts of the case which would answer the question. Prior knowledge about reality-bending is not required, it will come naturally to you. \n\nThe First Guest might invite others, like competitors, to further prod you with questions. You may invite others on your own, though it would be unwise to do so before the First Guest does. The same holds true for the later trials.\n\nThis is the easiest trial to succeed as you only need to prove that your practice of being is currently of Spring, or that it has plateaued. \n\nIf you find yourself failing this trial and a transfer to Summer is mentioned regardless, do not get your hopes up. This is just the procedure to get your decaying practice to Autumn.\n\nThe trial should be held with the other two in mind as each trial builds on what has been created before. As the change inherent in your practice of being has been established, the First Guest will move on to the second trial: The Proof of Rigour.\n\nThis trial coincides with a slow change of the environment, moving slowly from the floor of springazgeyne to an area in the night sky above Twilight Castle. Everything created in your first trial will still persist.\n\nThe First Guest will throw you into the many scenarios you created in the first trial and throw obstacles at it to see if the core of the practice changes or not. It is possible to negotiate what exactly the [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nMaybe read up on philosophy too! I know of trial-takers who never heard what the word quintessence means. Really would help against the First Guest giving them the run-around. Or just go in with a lawyer specialised in Fae Trials from the start.\n[[/span]]**quintessence**[[/span]] of their practice is.\n\nJust like the first trial, the last trial will build on your actions in the Proof of Rigour trial. After you have gone through the motions enough, the First Guest will appear frustrated and banish you from the scenarios he put you in, directly transitioning into the final trial: The Proof of Permanence.\n\nYour prior actions will become automated. The First Guest will continue to throw obstacles at your scenarios, though on a larger timescale and without you being able to intervene. Any time-dilation effects letting you experience centuries in seconds and yet in full are normal.\n\nAny of the invited by the First Guest may still influence the scenarios, by voicing their opinions about potential failures of the simulation or suggesting ideas for obstacles. You are able to argue against these suggestions, but it makes for a stronger case against the Summer Court proper for you to remain silent during this trial.\n\nOfficially this trial will not end. You may take the dismissal by the First Guest of any invited as a cue for having passed the trial. You may inquire about how much longer the trial will take. After a non-commital answer, you can excuse yourself using common courtesy. The questroom can now be left without repercussions.\n\n//Note: You will spawn under the Nightsky hanging over Twilight Castle. Depending on equipment and how far the main quest has progressed the falling damage may be lethal to your game character.//\n\nIn the rare case that the trial fails after this point the First Guest will contact you per [[span class=\"hover\"]][[span]]\nI so wish he would dreammail me. I know you are getting rejected but savour this chance. He is always in your mind now.\n[[/span]]**dreammail**[[/span]]. This does not usually happen, as the First Guest does not dismiss the invited without thinking there is nothing more to be done.\n\nThe third trial will progress indefinitely until your request for transfer is brought before the Summer Court itself. The longer you wait between \"completing\" the third trial and your audience with Summer, the better your chances of success. Waiting a hundred years will bring certain success at this point, though a decade will also do well for getting your case accepted.\n\n//For more Will-O-Wisp content, check your local forest.
