All staff of affected aquariums will be debriefed with a similar cover story.\n\nCoinage left by SCP-3375 is to be collected and stored in the nearest Foundation-owned facility. Writing left by SCP-3375 is to be removed using methods that are not obtrusive to aquarium inhabitants and onlookers. \n\n**Description:** SCP-3375 refers to an anomalous population of //Heterocongrinae// (garden eels) observed to spontaneously manifest in public aquariums in the North American and European continents[[footnote]]Of note, individuals of the //Heterocongrinae// subfamily are native to the Indo-Pacific region, as well as the Atlantic and East Pacific.[[/footnote]]. SCP-3375 instances appear and generally behave identically to their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\nAccording to the limited collected data, SCP-3375 instances will typically manifest[[footnote]]Though singular instances of SCP-3375 have been known to manifest, it is more common for two or more SCP-3375 instances to appear together.[[/footnote]] in large aquarium displays with sandy substrate ideal for burrowing, and emerge headfirst from the substrate during regular scheduled feeding times. SCP-3375, unlike their non-anomalous counterparts, will readily consume any small pieces of food present, and remain undisturbed by the presence of other animals[[footnote]]SCP-3375 instances will quickly retreat back into their burrows if a human approaches with the intent to extract it from the burrow.[[/footnote]] in the area.  \n\nFollowing the feeding period, SCP-3375 will retreat into the substrate, and after a period of 30 to 60 seconds, will reappear holding a single siglos[[footnote]]A silver coin issued by the Achaemenid Persian Empire from 520 BCE-450 BCE to 330 BCE, weighing approximately 5.40 to 5.60 grams.[[/footnote]] coin in its mouth. An SCP-3375 instance will then deposit the coin on the substrate and withdraw into the burrow it originated from. Once SCP-3375 is no longer in view above the substrate, any evidence of the burrow it apparently occupied disappears. Coins produced by SCP-3375, while in unusually pristine condition, exhibit no anomalous properties.\n\nIf no food is introduced to the tank at the time of SCP-3375 manifestation, SCP-3375 will remain at its burrow and placidly observe nearby fish. Should SCP-3375 be kept waiting for food longer than 10 minutes, it will retreat into its burrow without producing coinage[[footnote]]As of ██/██/██, this behavior has been observed in three public aquariums. Despite increased Foundation surveillance of the facilities, none of the three aquariums were visited again by SCP-3375.[[/footnote]].\n\nOn rare occasions, usually involving multiple instances of SCP-3375 manifesting in the same location, the first SCP-3375 instance to appear will leave its burrow and seek out the nearest flat surface. The SCP-3375 instance will then use its tail to deposit a layer of dark-colored mucus[[footnote]]Lab analyses currently cannot be performed, as the mucus dissipates upon attempt to collect samples.[[/footnote]] to form the script “سپاس”[[footnote]]Pronounced \"sepâs\", from Persian سپاسگزارم \"sepasgozaram\" (səpasgɔzaræm), translated “I am thankful” or “thank you”.[[/footnote]]. Upon such an act being performed, the SCP-3375 instance will return to its burrow, and all SCP-3375 present will each produce the typical siglos and collect the coins into a small pile, with the first SCP-3375 adding an additional siglos to the top of the collection. \n\nIt is noted that SCP-3375 manifest exclusively in water environments that differ widely in animal and plant population from those preferred by their non-anomalous counterparts.\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3374]]] | SCP-3375 | [[[SCP-3376]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
