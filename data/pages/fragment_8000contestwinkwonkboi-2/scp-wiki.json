Papers fall to the ground from the sudden awakening, scattering to the floor to slumber peacefully. Her groans pierce the silence even further as she tries to collect herself.//\n\n**Abigail:** Ugh, fuck… coffee… headache?\n\n//Sitting in a familiar place, Abigail looks around with a confused expression. The same cobwebs creeping in the corners, samples of unorganized messes sprinkled throughout her office, it's as if she's back where she started. Readjusting herself, Abigail notices her open laptop beside her.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"notation\"]]\n= You have an exclusive 15-minute lock that will stop others editing this page while you are working.\n\n= The lock expires in **98** seconds of inactivity.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Abigail:** Wait, what?\n\n//A sudden knock on the door startles Abigail as she jumps backward in her seat. Director Burgees enters the room with a faint grin on his face.//\n\n**Burgees:** Ah, Ms. Burntwood. I hope I'm not disturbing you.\n\n**Abigail:** //(Blinks)// Director Burgees? No, you're not disturbing me at all. How can I… help?\n\n**Burgees:** Nothing much, I'm only here to give my thanks for your volunteering.\n\n//Déjà vu, some would claim. Though in this case, it's a retread of territory, a retelling of a story. You could even say it's been rewritten. From another perspective, from another point of view. A way to recollect and put together what should've been.//\n\n**Abigail:** For… for 8245, right?\n\n**Burgees:** Correct, glad to see we're on the same page. I greatly appreciate your help in this considering the circumstances at hand. Not many people are willing to take the responsibility of standing within proximity of a reality bender, let alone interviewing them. They're quite the… //unpredictable// kind.\n\n**Abigail:** Oh my god, this is real.\n\n**Burgees:** Hm?\n\n**Abigail:** No, don't- don't mind me. Haven't gotten much sleep lately. I'm just happy to take the lead when it comes to people like these. I can't help but feel curious, I can't help but… want to see it up close.\n\n**Burgees:** Oh, uh… well, you know what they say about curiosity. Don't let it get to you, alright?\n\n**Abigail:** Right, right. Whatever you say. I'll be sure to head out in 15 with the rest of the crew. Don't worry.\n\n**Burgees:** //(Scoffs)// Would you look at that? Aren't you a commendable one, Ms. Burntwood? It's good to know we have people like you.\n\n**Abigail:** //(Inhales)// Yup, that's me… Miss Commendable.\n\n//He leaves as he enters, leaving a few departing words.//\n\n**Burgees:** Guess I'll take my leave, then. Best of luck.\n\n//With a sever and a cut, the conversation is already finished. Abigail, realizing the circumstances at hand—gears turning counter clockwise, a second viewing of a film—her eyes lay before her open palms. In a moment of hesitation, Abigail's thumb and finger touch before snapping. A sprawl of light bursts from within, colors of the rainbow and beyond, drowning her sights in an ocean of potential.//\n\n//The furniture grows and shrinks sporadically, being replaced the next second by animals and pastries. Ceilings and walls fold and crush and open and bend among other ways indescribable. Every second, Abigail sports a different palette of colors. From a golfing uniform and a chicken suit to a Barbie doll and a green statue, her wardrobe spins like a dial in a continuous motion.//\n\n//Even the sights from the window beside her change: An observing audience of Jim Henson Muppets, outer space bearing snowflakes as stars, a wall coated with unfinished drafts.

The colors bleeding from the buildings and skies, the sounds of leaves rustling in the wind. A chance to revisit times of old is a chance to collect all the finer details, whether it's a painting or a narrative. All you really need is a fresher perspective.//\n\n//Swinging by the opening scene, Abigail steps out of the vehicle for her encore. She holds her breath, hoping not to let go, as she turns to the agents wearing a stern but distracted expression.//\n\n**Abigail:** I'll go out there and interview him alone. Don't follow me.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8245/elfreth.jpg|caption=Elfreth's Alley, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|width=100%|align=center]]\n\n//The agents exchange looks of confusion. One of them raises a question.//\n\n**Agent:** Um, wha-\n\n**Abigail:** We'll just be alerting him otherwise, and we wouldn't want him to leave- //I// wouldn't want him to leave. So, you're all going to stay here and set up whatever you need to set up. I'll give you a heads-up if anything happens, bla bla bla. Got it?\n\n//She clasps her hands, the rush coursing through her veins. None of the others respond, apart from a silent nod between them.//\n\n**Abigail:** Okay, good.\n\n//Abigail wastes no time as she makes her way toward a second reunion. Every voice of doubt creaking through the entrance, peaking from the windows. Their sight is ungodly but unavoidable, their markings are a hassle to clean. But a clearer mind met Abigail as she hurries, her eyes set on a path she's been stepping from since forever. Her ideas form words and her words connect to sentences, then paragraphs, then something wholly new. Everything was coming together, everything was about to be.//\n\n//It was only a matter of time till she got rid of her implanted doubts.//\n\n//There it is, the sensation of soap water streaming past. Bubbles soar by, singing piano notes as they pop. Rubber ducks swim blissfully as the world begins to contort into beautiful strokes of paint. Hues of plum shower the surroundings, stars dance on the wind, and a humming sound wraps around the ears of a lone audience. Before long, a familiar figure can be seen whimsically circling in the air.//\n\n//A magician cloaked under a galactic robe and a wide-brimmed eclectic hat, a person wearing wonder on his sleeve and fervor around his belt, and above all, an artist sporting every hint of himself on the forefront. She sees this, she knows this. Abigail still recalls the ink on her palms, the paint on his face, the cracks in the boundaries. It's like she's actually standing beside him, like she's finally bringing sun into her view. She stops in her tracks as every memory pours themselves out once more, weighing harder on her heavy heart. She gulps, hesitating for a moment before muttering.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Sighs)// Here. We. Go.\n\n//She takes a leap of faith, approaching him with words of condolences lingering on her mind. William takes notice, meeting her for the first time again.//\n\n**Abigail:** Will! Hey, Will.\n\n**William:** Oh, hello there… hello-\n\n//William pauses, blinking repeatedly, being caught in the same ordeal. Racking his head in puzzlement, making cowbell sounds with his noggin, dusting off the clouding swirls and spirals. He opens his eyes again as he gets a taste of the same déjà vu, growing all the more confused.//\n\n**William:** Wait, how is this- how are we here? What?\n\n**Abigail:** Will?\n\n//He turns to Abigail, the events up to now finally catching up with him. A wave of irritation casts over William.//\n\n**William:** Did… did you do this?\n\n**Abigail:** Yes. I don't know how, but I did.\n\n**William:** How the- you know what, that doesn't matter. I should leave.\n\n**Abigail:** Wait, no! You can't, please. Just listen to me.\n\n**William:** I'm not going to listen to someone who's just gonna wreck my performance no matter where I go. You and all your troublesome folks can have your fun talking by the water cooler. I have better things to do than to stand here and listen to you.\n\n**Abigail:** Come on, Will-\n\n**William:** Here, I'll send you home myself.\n\n//William snaps his fingers, whisking Abigail away as nothing but a gust of wind. Turning around, though, he's met by her again. He stumbles back, startled by her sudden reappearance.//\n\n**Abigail:** Tada! See? I haven't lost my magic, I'm still an artist.\n\n//A moment of silence hovers above them.//\n\n**William:** I-I don't care. Call yourself an artist all you want, but I taught you all those tricks. You're just using them for the wrong reasons. You're… you're only using them to suppress me. I mean-\n\n**Abigail:** You don't think that. You don't think I would actually do something like that, do you? Please, Will… just listen to what I have to say.\n\n**William:** You were working with them this entire time, Abigail. Don't you get it? You came here, you pretended like you cared, acted like you're someone you're not. I almost let my guard down, too. How- how do I know you're not just going to pull strings again?\n\n**Abigail:** What'll it take for you to believe me?\n\n//Being presented with her question, William stops before he faces away from her, finger on his chin as he bathes in the thought. A response soon follows.//\n\n**William:** Oh, I don't know. Maybe you can piece together a tale on the spot, maybe you can phase something grand into existence, or even-\n\n//William swiftly turns back holding a finger gun, shooting a beam of laser nearing Abigail's direction. It strikes the road behind her, bouncing off into the horizon. She shudders for a second, but not a second more.//\n\n**William:** -a collaboration between us?\n\n**Abigail:** What are you… implying?\n\n**William:** Artists tend to thrive in the heat of the moment, creating the best of pieces when they're raring to go, when the heart is racing, when the mind is storming. What better way of doing this than to put your skills to the test? See if you're really as passionate as you used to be.\n\n**Abigail:** I am. I promise.\n\n**William:** Heh, sure. We'll see about that.\n\n**Abigail:** Will…\n\n//A ringing fills the air as the two stand across from one another. Making a stance, Abigail stares at William unblinkingly as her breaths grow ever more audible. His eyes as he looks back, their lights seem to have dimmed, though a shimmer of hope still remains. There's a hand holding a chance to reconcile, a hand she needs to hold.//\n\n//She has to.//\n\n//…//\n\n**Abigail:** I can't, Will. I don't want to-\n\n//No matter. William already bursts in with the first hit, throwing a fist at Abigail's chest, a force that propels her backward. Her body rolls down the road as her wardrobe switches to that of a hospital gown. She groans in pain, though she quickly recovers. As she stands, Abigail notices William running toward her.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Under breath)// \"Heat of the moment,\" huh? Alright, I'll prove it to you.\n\n//She stands in place, waiting as William closes the distance. Before he manages to reach her, Abigail rushes to a door beside her, painted with an ecstatic blend of pink and purple. He wastes no time to follow suit.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div class=\"box\"]]\n[[div class=\"table2\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//William comes to a halt as he is met with a surprise.//\n\n**William:** Wh-what the?\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8245/balloons.jpg|caption=Soaring the Skies|width=100%|align=center]]\n\n//A mountainous area, showered by sunset skies. Lands of green can be seen from far beyond, along with a string of hot air balloons soaring over the heavens. Some of them reach high enough to be obscured by the clouds, only the glistening of the flames they carry being visible from up high.//\n\n//It takes a moment for William to realize his change of outfit, sporting a hat with ear flaps, goggles, a buttoned sweater, and a pair of gloves. He pauses for a moment before catching a glimpse of Abigail hopping from one balloon to another, using an umbrella to lift her weight.//\n\n**William:** Running away from an altercation, are you?\n\n//One jump, then two, and a third takes him up and above. William lands on top of a hot air balloon and immediately makes his way to another, the wind blowing in his face as he does. He eventually catches up with a scurrying Abigail who, from a closer eye, wears a blue jacket and skirt, a buttoned blouse, and a bowler hat. Her hair is also tied in a bun.//\n\n**William:** //(Angrily)// Abigail!\n\n**Abigail:** Will! How do you like my prose? I tried to put a lot of detail into the descriptions as you can hopefully tell.\n\n**William:** Don't act as if you can weasel your way out of this. You're supposed to put your creativity on the forefront.\n\n**Abigail:** But I am. Everything around us, everything you see here. It's all my efforts balled into a story, just for you to see.\n\n**William:** Well, I'm surprised-\n\n//William leaps as high as he can in the air, hurtling toward her and throwing his leg back. Abigail doesn't try to move.//\n\n**William:** -you didn't bother showing me //any// part of it.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table3\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//Before he can land a hit, though, William tumbles and falls into a wheat field. He gets up, observing his surroundings in a frenzy. The lands stretch over infinity and beyond, surrounded by a forest. A single tree rests in the middle of the plains, where Abigail dashes toward. She is wearing all-white baggy clothes. William's attire is similar to hers.//\n\n**William:** Oh, you got to be-\n\n//He proceeds to run after her.//\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-8245/wheatfield.jpg|caption=Hide Away, Hide Away|width=100%|align=center]]\n\n//Soon, he reaches the tree. A door is present integrated into its base, floral and starry patterns having been etched into it. William swings it open and sees a hall leading to a ladder, stretching farther than the trunk allows. He rushes to the ladder and looks above, noticing Abigail as she climbs. The ceiling cannot be discerned whatsoever, being met with pure light.//\n\n//He takes a moment to take in the sight before pulling his head from the gutters. William hurriedly follows Abigail, ascending the ladder.//\n\n**William:** Where do you think you're going?\n\n**Abigail:** I'm going to show you I'm still a capable artist.\n\n**William:** By forcing me through a marathon?\n\n**Abigail:** I'm putting my skills to the test, Will. Like you said, I'm building worlds with a pen, constructing everything around us with care and soul. I really did put a lot of effort into writing this. Do you… do you not like it still?\n\n**William:** This is not what I asked for. I'm not looking for a goose chase.\n\n**Abigail:** Will, come on. You can't expect me to throw a punch at you. We've known each other since childhood, we've been friends for-\n\n**William:** Shut. Up.\n\n//William rotates himself upside-down on the ladder before letting go of the handles. He ends up falling in the opposite direction, hastily approaching Abigail as she tries to climb as fast as she can. They both end up colliding regardless, causing them both to fall out of the tree and into the clouds.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table1\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The sound of the wind makes its presence known as the pair fall and fall. William constantly tries to throw attacks at Abigail as she counters just as fast. He pulls out a wooden hammer for her to break open and free the candies inside. He whips out a baseball bat for her to blow into confetti. With every punch he throws, she whisks away what harm they have.//\n\n//William speaks through gritted teeth.//\n\n**William:** Why're you holding back? There's no point in holding back.\n\n**Abigail:** I don't want to hurt you, Will.\n\n**William:** I've been trying to hurt you this entire time, Abigail. Take it as a form of criticism or something, hit back twice as hard if you really want to call yourself an artist. Just- just DO SOMETHING ALREADY.\n\n**Abigail:** Will, please…\n\n//The two soon land on a clearing, walking on air before resting their feet on the luscious grass. Surrounded by pine trees and the hushed tones of wildlife, they stand across each other, sporting clothes of a knight. William, holding fists to his target, manifests a sword from bits and pieces of the air. He grips its handle and points its edge toward her, charging with a scream, his eyes glinting.//\n\n//Abigail stands in silence for the first few moments before laying her sights on a lonely rose below her. She kneels down to see its petals swaying ever so slightly. Picking it off the ground, she inhales its flourishing perfume and offers it to an attacking William. He lifts the sword high and prepares to strike her. As he does, however, his blade is met with an obstacle.//\n\n//The flower's petals have rapidly grown outward, forming a shield. William strikes it again to no avail. One more time, then again, and again.//\n\n**William:** Ugh-\n\n//He mysteriously vanishes before shooting toward Abigail from another direction. She manages to block him off, causing him to disappear and reappear from somewhere else to land a hit. William gradually picks up the pace, building and taking out steam while Abigail follows through.//\n\n**William:** Haha, sh-shielding yourself now? Isn't that just //poetic.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Pause)// You're stuttering.\n\n**William:** No… no, I'm not.\n\n**Abigail:** Yes, you are. You're hesitating, you don't actually want to fight.\n\n**William:** Please, you're the one constantly turning tail. I've been trying to pummel you this whole time, //I've// been hunting you down while //you're// just making a run for it. I'm literally ambushing you with a SWORD.\n\n**Abigail:** But you're holding back.\n\n**William:** I'M NOT.\n\n**Abigail:** You would've already beaten me if you weren't. You're the reason why I can keep up, why I'm even able to do all of this. Even then, even with all your experience with the brush, you can't land a single stroke on me. You don't want to, you… you don't actually hate me.\n\n//Pause. William stops striking, leading Abigail to put her shield down.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Deep inhale)// Look, I'm not trying to invalidate your feelings, but… can't we just talk things out-\n\n**William:** Oh, you want to talk?\n\n//Abigail raises her gaze but does not spot William. Tilting her head, she realizes his voice coming behind her. She turns around and sees him rushing in and tackling her, causing her to fall over.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table4\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Abigail:** //(Groans)// Ugh…\n\n//Abigail tries to get up but realizes her arms and legs are tied to a railway on a pebble terrain. What a fashionable way to end up in this situation, having worn Victorian clothing to the station. William walks up to her with a tuxedo, trousers, and a rather tall top hat.//\n\n**William:** Let's talk, then.\n\n//The sound of an oncoming train creeps in.//\n\n**Abigail:** Will, this is not what I meant.\n\n**William:** Abigail, I'll be honest: I admire you.\n\n//Abigail falls silent. The train makes its way in the distance, smoke escaping to the sea of clouds.//\n\n**William:** Yeah, it's pretty obvious, but still. Back then, I merely saw drawing as a hobby, something to pass the time. I didn't think much of it at all until we met. You gave me encouragement, you- you gave me a reason to pursue in the arts. It changed me, made me think that, \"Yeah, maybe I should try this out, see where it takes me.\" I couldn't have it any other way.\n\n//The train whistles. Neither of them bother to pay attention.//\n\n**William:** And yes, maybe I don't want to fight you.\n\n**Abigail:** Then-\n\n**William:** But, you're not the same person as before. No works, no drafts, not even an outline to show. It's like you became someone completely alien. I mean, you're taking part in thrashing my performance, my showcasing of all I have to offer. It just made me…\n\n//William lets out a deep sigh.//\n\n**William:** Now, you're coming around, acting like I can get over it.\n\n//The train closes the distance. Before it even reaches the pair, though, William picks up Abigail by the collar and lifts her to eye level. As he walks from the railroad, he switches the scenery and hangs her over a cliff by a canyon. The sun peaks from the lands below.//\n\n**William:** This isn't a fairytale, this isn't some fantasy. Even I know that, I know that some dreams aren't anything more than that.\n\n//He faces her, holding back a glistening in his eyes.//\n\n**William:** Maybe in another story, you didn't move away. Maybe, just //maybe,// we can sit in your room again. We can butt our heads together and… come up with all sorts of stupid ideas. I can read all the thought you put into every word, you can tell me your thoughts on every line I drew. Maybe we can even stay as friends, as //artists// pushing the boundaries.\n\n//William looks to the sky. Abigail takes a moment to process before responding.//\n\n**Abigail:** It's not too late, though.\n\n**William:** Huh? What are you-\n\n//Abigail snaps her fingers and the ground beneath them gives way, causing them to plunge. Biting her restraints away like gummy, she takes hold of William's hands and stares into his eyes with a hopeful grin.//\n\n**Abigail:** We can still meet at the top, we can still leave our marks.\n\n//They spin in circles, stars and diamonds lingering in the air.//\n\n**Abigail:** I know I've made my fair share of mistakes, but I'm still the same Abby from middle school, Will. I haven't lost my touch just yet.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table5\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//The pair lands on a bouncy castle encompassed by an indoor playground, launching them high again. Papers and canvases, inks of psychedelic hues, they spiral around them forming characters and objects and everything in-between. They both change through a multitude of outfits, too quick for the human eye to differentiate.//\n\n**Abigail:** We can still be artists, together. I know I'm being selfish, but I'm serious. I //still// want to be an artist with you… Please, give me a chance. Listen to what I have to say, just this once.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**William:** Why, then?\n\n//William grabs Abigail and throws her down onto a wrestling ring before they can even descend. Her eyes burn from the penetrating ceiling light. A crowd surrounds the ring, shrouded in darkness. She immediately scurries backward as William tries to punch her, hitting the ground instead with his boxing glove. Abigail wears white overalls with a black waistband.//\n\n**William:** Why aren't you one already? Why did you make up all this nonsense about being a novelist? Your \"big debut,\" your hesitance, your lack of commitment until now. Why, Abigail?\n\n//He approaches her slowly.//\n\n**William:** Why did you lie to me?\n\n//William pulls in to prepare another throw of his fist. Before it even touches her face, though, Abigail opens her mouth as her hardships lay bare before him.//\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"table6\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Abigail:** I was scared.\n\n**William:** …Scared?\n\n//The world around them shatters like glass, opening to a blank canvas. William and Abigail's clothes return to what they were before. The former stands over the latter as she sits and draws circles on the transparent floor.//\n\n**Abigail:** Scared of rejection, scared you'd hate me. Well, you probably still do, but- ah, nevermind that.\n\n//A momentary silence passes.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Deep inhale)// All my life, I've only known rejection. I've only wanted to show my crafts, to… to put my effort on stage for everyone to see. I want people to be inspired and make art, and I want them to inspire more people to do the same thing. Ever since I was young, I-I had a lot of ambition.\n\n**Abigail:** But it's like you said, Will: Some fantasies just stay out of reach. You were the only friend I had, you actually paid attention to me. That day we talked for the first time, it's like I was already there experiencing the dream. \"I can almost taste it,\" I told myself. //\"I can almost taste it.\"//\n\n**Abigail:** But that was the end of that. I moved away to some stupid private school cause my mom thought it'd be best.\n\n**William:** You didn't… you didn't talk back?\n\n//She clasps her hands together.//\n\n**Abigail:** I did, but she wouldn't listen. I even tried giving her some of the stories I was working on.\n\n//She lets go.//\n\n**Abigail:** She didn't care for them, found them too \"childish.\" Said that a career in literature won't \"buy you a house\" or \"pay the bills.\" Told me I should get a job that would keep me stable instead of following some pipe dream.\n\n**William:** Her? But she's your mom. I've met her, she seemed so nice.\n\n**Abigail:** Yeah, well… it's not like I could do anything about it. I was a child, young and naïve. I couldn't talk to anyone after transferring, they all were disinterested or outright mean. They made fun of me, sometimes even ripping my stuff apart to prove a point. To prove that…\n\n//Silence.//\n\n**Abigail:** …no one cares. No one cares and there's no point in even trying, that I should just give up and move on like everyone else.\n\n//Abigail holds her breath.//\n\n**Abigail:** And I did, I gave up. Focused on studying instead, landed myself a decent spot academically. Got into a good college far from home, not even looking the other way. That led me here… here.\n\n//She sighs.//\n\n**Abigail:** I don't know… I thought I wouldn't need it, that I was already satisfied enough with what I had. Then, it sorta came slithering back. Every so often, I'd break from the scientific technobabble and just write, my mind wandering off wherever it wanted. //(Chuckles)// My boss ended up sending me a complaint about it too. I couldn't move on at all.\n\n//She stops briefly.//\n\n**Abigail:** Then, you came along with that silly costume of yours. The thrill and joy in your eyes, the swiftness in your movements, they ended up rekindling the will I had all those years ago. I took initiative, I went and threw myself in trying to chase that pipe dream that once was.\n\n//Pause.//\n\n**Abigail:** And look at me now, I'm… I've lied to you, I pretended like everything was okay and there was nothing to worry about. I assumed you wouldn't mind, that you wouldn't care. Haha, I'm such a mess…\n\n//Another pause.//\n\n**Abigail:** //(Mutters)// I'm such a fucking mess.\n\n//She looks up to see William, standing silently with his mouth open and his eyes wide. He lowers his eyebrows, taking in all of her circumstances.//\n\n**William:** And I… I just pushed you away?\n\n**Abigail:** No, you have every right to hold a grudge.\n\n**William:** But I fought you, I tried to //hurt// you. I didn't even bother hearing what you've been through. You've been turned down this entire time… and- and I've-\n\n//William stumbles back, trying to keep balance.//\n\n**William:** -I've been shoving you off too.\n\n//He starts to pant.//\n\n**Abigail:** Will?\n\n**William:** //(Under breath)// I'm just as bad.\n\n**Abigail:** Will.\n\n**William:** //(Quickly)// I said all that about you not being an artist, that you're a fake, that you shouldn't be- it's, it's my fault too. I did all that without even reconsidering, without even thinking about, about, about-\n\n**Abigail:** WILL.\n\n//She grabs his arm.
