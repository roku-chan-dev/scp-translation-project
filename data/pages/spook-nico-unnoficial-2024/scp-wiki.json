Well done!\n\nMake sure to read the winning entry here: [[[SCP-8980]]]\n\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show Rules, Entries, etc.!\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[=image spooky.png]]\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+++ Hello!\n[[/=]]\n-----\nIf you know me at all, you know that I'm a tough nut to crack when it comes to horror on the SCP Wiki. I can count on one hand the amount of times articles here have scared me. So I decided to host a contest with the sole purpose of writing horror that //will// spook me! \n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+++ The Rules\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\n# This is a horror-themed contest, so your entry must primarily inspire fear, terror, those kinds of emotions. That doesn't mean you're not allowed to have silly or heartfelt moments, just make sure the primary theme is horror.\n# SCPs, Tales, GoI Formats, Creepypasta, whatever you want to write, its fair game.\n# This is a solo contest. No exceptions.\n# Entries will be subject to the usual deletion process.\n# Minor edits are permitted - grammar edits, formatting, etc. Try not to change the article fundamentally.\n# You must write something new. If you've got something close already on the site, you don't get to enter it just because the contest came along.\n# In order for your entry to be considered for the contest, tag it with {{spook-nico-2024-unofficial}}.\n# Old drafts ARE allowed, as long as they were not previously posted.\n# Any member who takes unusual and/or negative actions to increase their vote total, or decrease that of their competitors, will be disqualified for the involved contest and potentially banned from further contests. Site members who are not participating in the contest but do this sort of thing may be subject to Disciplinary action. Examples of shenanigans include, but are in no way limited to: Downvoting all of your competitors' work within minutes of them being posted, Spamming people with PMs about your work, and Spurring Malicious Upvoting/Downvoting, whether on your work or anyone else's. If you're not sure if something counts as shenanigans, then it probably does, but feel free to PM me asking.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ The Dates\n[[/=]]\n-----\n* Writing opens up the moment this hub goes live. \n* You will have until October 15th, 11:59 PM  EST (GMT-5) to post your article.\n* The voting period begins on October 16th 12:01 AM EST (GMT-5) and continues until October 30th 12:01 AM EST.\n* Winners will be announced on October 31st. \n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ The Prizes\n[[/=]]\n\nTo the victors go the spoils! \n\nThe entry with the highest number of upvotes total will receive a $25 Steam Gift Card.\nMy personal favorite entry will receive a $25 Steam Gift Card.\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ Have some help!\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nWhat fun would it be if I didn't tell you what the scariest article on the site (in my opinion) was? It's [[[SCP-3817]]] for me. I'll also throw you another bone. I like making my blorbos suffer, so if you think that making my characters suffer will get to me, it won't. \n\nNow go forth, armed with this knowledge, and scare me. I look forward to your entries!\n\n-----\n[[=]]\n+++ The Entries\n[[/=]]\n-----\n[[module ListPages category=\"_default adult\" separate=\"no\" tags=\"+spook-nico-2024-unofficial -hub -donotshowupinmodule\" perPage=\"100\" order=\"random\"]]\n* [[size 120%]][[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%title_linked%%[[/span]][[/size]] [[size 105%]]//by// [[span style=\"font-weight: bold\"]]%%created_by%%[[/span]][[/size]]\n[[/module]]\n[[/collapsible]]",
