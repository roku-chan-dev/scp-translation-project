She swipes the required clearance cards. One hers, the other borrowed from a long-dead director. \n\n\"You probably relate.\" \n\nThe swirling chemicals begin draining from the containment. An alarm rings out as several protocols and procedures are shut off. A massive organism slowly supports itself for the first time in decades. \n\n\"I don’t care what you did to us.

I watched them turn. The sound changed them. It hit every device across the globe at once.\n\nAnything that could play audio, that could pick up a signal. They hit each and every single one.\n\nIt took a few minutes, maybe a few hours for all those affected to transform. To get the full effect to take over but they’re all gone now. Well, any trace of what made them, well, them.\n\nOnly a few of us didn’t hear it. Couldn’t hear it. Still, I’m pretty sure I’m one of the last around.

Finding themselves suddenly in a crowd of violent, aggressive mind slaves.\n\nI’m sure someone, somewhere in a bunker is having a field day determining the memetic, cognitohazard, whatever it was that jammed the human signal and overwrote whole populations in minutes.\n\nMe? I’m currently riding a secret underground subway system across the continent. We’re lucky whatever hit everyone else rewrote everything in the human mind.\n\nCan you imagine? A massive army that can be hindered because they don’t even remember what the word “PULL” on a door means?

That, and some nutjob who thought that keeping an SCP that can rewrite the world around might come in handy.\n\nI hope I get there in time. The train is so far underground, I think I’m traveling under the ocean in places? Hard to tell.\n\nThere are some perks to being one of the humans squirreled away by the Foundation in the event of something like this.

You did what you did because it's probably best for you. At least your choices could have been shittier I tell myself.\n\nI thought we were escaping. Beating the odds. A team. You decided to close the door behind me and stay in that chaos of a life.\n\nYou choose data and technology. You choose locked doors and secrecy. You choose to secure, contain, protect, while I choose to try for something I wanted.\n\nWell this isn't what I wanted, but when do we ever get that?\n\nI hope you wanted what you got after you shut that portal.\n\nMaybe there were lies I didn't know. Maybe the stress was too much and I was just a distraction. Maybe you never really planned on going this far with me and I got ahead of you.\n\nI'm not gonna blame myself for your choices.

It's not that it's that top-secret, but to title the main body of my work would either be too depressing or too inhumane. \n\nI'm basically a glorified janitor. I clean out the desks of personnel who have died.\n\nObviously, it changes a little depending on the circumstances of their death, but we have a standard protocol we follow. Can't just put everything in a box and ship it to their next of kin or throw everything out as any normal office might do.\n\nThere's a work story that gets passed around about an anomalous stone that caused people to procrastinate that got thrown out once. Usually, the first thing we do is a sweep of their personal items for anything anomalous.\n\nSometimes I destroy sensitive documents. Sometimes I package stuff up for the next poor soul to get the deceased's workload. Got to make sure that, despite the \"creative mess\" they leave their desks, all the paperwork is accounted for and properly filed away.\n\nThen comes the personal items. Some of these people have families I can send stuff to. There are the families that are in on what we do in the dark and others that will never know what their loved one really did for a living.\n\nOther folks were right bastards in their lives. No family, no friends, no one to miss them. Well, that's not true. Even the crustiest and meanest SOB usually has someone who notices their absence.\n\nThey may not have been friends, but the security guard at the site parking lot or the project manager usually asks about them. I think most people don't realize how much someone's presence is felt just by being there. By sharing a space. Through shared experiences.\n\nSorry, I'm dragging my feet on the issue, as it's my least favorite part of the job. It's part of the reason why the task fell to me so many times it became my main responsibility around here.\nYou can really learn a lot about a person by the stuff they leave behind.\n\nPictures of family members or pictures of their birds. Whacky coffee mugs and desktop knickknacks. Cute post-it notes by loved ones or reminders for weekly game sessions. Sometimes I find stuff that tells a story while other items leave so many questions.\n\nI've broken down and cried many times from things left behind. Words left unspoken. Upcoming Anniversaries, trips that will never happen, love never expressed. It's a sobering reminder that none of us are promised tomorrow.\n\nI'm thankful the job hasn't hardened me to the point where I don't get misty-eyed. It's solemn work, shifting through another person's belongings to sort out what is Foundation property, what goes to loved ones, and what gets thrown out.\n\nSome secrets I've kept to preserve the person's memory. Affairs, personal journals, addictions. In my own way, I've tried to minimize the damage their departure has on those left behind. Not everyone agrees with that, but I try to be considerate of all parties.\n\nAnd I always try to rehome their plants, as sad a state as some might be. More than a few security guards have a mini garden springing up in their booth because of me. My own office has a corner that looks more like a jungle than an office in HR.\n\nI hope that when I die, someone doesn't just throw them all out. They deserve better than that. People deserve better than that. You deserve better than that.\n\nBut just, try not to put off too many things for tomorrow, as it might not always come, okay?\n\nStay safe, folks.\n[[/tab]]\n\n>[[tab Tab 3]]\n>Contents of Tab 3\n>[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n+ Contributed Work:\n||~ Page Title ||~ Work ||~ About ||\n|| [http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-035 SCP-035 - Possessive Mask] || Image Photoshop || //SPOILER//: Wanted to help push this SCP a little with a sneaky --gif--. Put a delay in there so that readers should be just about ready to scroll down the page when it changes.
