  "content": "Item #: SCP-8965\n\nObject Class: Safe\n\nSpecial Containment Procedures: SCP-8965 is to be kept in a fully furnished, living room-like containment cell with automatic cat food feeders and toys. SCP-8965 is allowed to roam the halls of the SCP Foundation during weekends for a few hours under strict supervision, with no access to restricted or important rooms.\n\nSCP-8965 Is to be not taken out of Site 19 As that is its containment site.\n\nIf SCP-8965 needs to be moved more than one mile away, it is to be placed in a vet carrier and transported with staff who are currently in the two-hour cooldown period after interacting with it.\n\nDescription: SCP-8965 is a fully white male cat with heterochromatic eyes, the exact colors of SCP-8965 change from day to day sometimes being orange and blue and sometimes being purple and green. the weight of SCP-8965 On a tuesday is 3.14 pounds on any other day SCP-8965 will Unexplanbly be 4 pounds. SCP-8965 has all normal features of a cat, including meowing and hunting.\n\nSCP-8965 appears to be connected to a remote that does not seem to function. The remote is designated SCP-8965-1 and will always remain within 20 meters of SCP-8965, teleporting if necessary to stay within range.\n\nAnyone who is within 20 meters of SCP-8965 and has viewed its face will, within 30 seconds, experience an uncontrollable urge to pick up the remote and pet SCP-8965 with it. This urge is not under the subject’s control; even when faced with life-threatening consequences, the subject will still proceed to pet SCP-8965 using the remote.\n\nThe method of petting is by sliding the remote up and down SCP-8965’s head. SCP-8965 shows joyfulness after the petting.\n\nAfter this interaction, SCP-8965 initiates a two-hour cooldown period during which the subject will not feel any urge to pet the cat. After the two hours have passed, if the subject views SCP-8965’s face again while within 20 meters, the compulsion will return.\n\nIf SCP-8965 has not eaten anything within 12 hours, 1 to 3 mice will automatically be summoned near SCP-8965. SCP-8965 will then consume these mice to sustain itself.\n\nTests show subjects who pet SCP-8965 are less violent and calmer. A 20% decrease in fighting, shouting, and violent tendencies, including murder, has been observed. This effect is presumed to last for life.\n\nIf SCP-8965 is made happy by being fed treats, it will release a high-pitched meow, causing its remote to turn green. This triggers stacks of cash to appear near the subject. The effect lasts for two minutes before wearing off.\n\nDiscovery: SCP-8965 was found a mile away from an abandoned shelter. Bins outside the shelter contained bottles with a mysterious green and purple gooey substance. This substance tasted like water and did not seem to cause any issues or changes in subjects who drank it.\n\nIt is suspected that SCP-8965's anomalous properties are linked to the mysterious green and purple gooey substance found in bottles near the abandoned shelter.\n\n\n\nAddendum Log 20/4/12\n\n------\n\nD-9876: Lets Just get this over with\n\nResercher Luke: You know the drill enter the room and do not touch the remote\n\nD-9876: Whatever\n\nSCP-8965: Meow\n\nD-9876: Its just a cat knowing this place its most likely going to consume me.\n\nSCP-8965:Purrrrr\n\nD-9876: I will pet this cat with the remote over anything\n\nResercher Luke: Do not pick up the remote and pet the cat or the guards will terminate you\n\nD-9876: I dont care kill me at least i pet the cat with the remote\n\nGuard: He petted the cat with the remote kill him\n\nResercher Luke: NO NO do not i think SCP-8965 Is making him do it.\n\nD-9876: I dont know why I petted the cat even tho I was aware I would die I dont think i was in control of myself.\n\nResercher Luke: hmmmm ok\n\nD-9876: Im so sorry to those i have killed i wish i never did it.\n\nGuard: hmmm whats this now at first you said no regrets for killing those people to get you sent here now you are calm and sorry.\n\nD-9876: Yes I regret it all\n\nResercher Luke: Hmmm SCP-8965 Must make people less aggresive and calm ill write that down\n\n                                                                            END OF LOG\n\n\n\n------",
