He shook the droplets off his hands and toweled them off, turning around. The living room in the stairway where clearly visible through the open door. His partner on this specific operation, Agent Konnicker, was standing over the prone corpse of the man he had taken down, his heavy sniping rifle slung over his shoulder. Blood and splinters of skull were alternatively splattered over and embedded in the fine oak planks of the stairs, and the stink of freshly-sheared copper hung in the air like a cloud of miasma. \n\n\"Hey Tom,\" the hefty Texan sniper mumbled through his impressive mustache, \"check this out.\" \n\nHe was waving a sheet of A4 paper around. McPhelty snatched it from him, frowning as he looked it over.\n\n\"...now what in God's blue heaven is this shit, Bill?\"\n\n\"I do believe he snapped and wrote hisself a little poem. Found it in his pocket.\"\n\nMcPhelty looked down at the fallen corpse of Richard Daublin, the dead spy. Their hacker would later discover there was at least half a terabyte of sensitive information pertaining to the Foundation scattered on various hard drives through his five laptops, but right now, with most of the top half of his head missing, he didn't look so smart.\n\n\"Wouldn't quit my day job, if I were him.\"\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
