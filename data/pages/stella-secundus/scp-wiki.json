The tone used by Mr. Van Hock in his letter gave the impression of a severe overreaction to something Corbenic's latent healing factor would quickly patch up.}}\n> \n> {{If anything, the petition was putting the state of things at Stella Secundus too mildly. Whatever happened here left the island worse off than a Strider harvest.}}\n> \n> {{Incident-5257GR4-Black in question has been confirmed to be a nuclear attack -- though I'm not sure what would warrant the use of such force against a minor target. And even then, the land and its people would heal, as they always have -- but the regeneration rate has been slowed to the point of indeterminability, if not stopped altogether. The bomb had to have been thaumaturgically enhanced.}}\n> \n> {{The fact that we're not the only ones in Corbenic capable of creating thaumokinetic weaponry is terrifying, at best. Identifying the attacker should be our top priority.}}\n> \n> {{The only major settlement that remains is a makeshift shelter in a derelict wooden boat. I've been informed by the locals that it used to be an early-19th century brigantine with the British Navy on Earth (Iteration 1M), and the settlement is still referred to as \"the //Jolie Regina//.\"}}\n> \n> {{The locals are barely even alive -- the transmutational effects of the bomb have reduced their flesh to a dark brown, gelatinous slime. Comparisons have been drawn with the [http://www.scp-wiki.net/shaggydredlocks-proposal unsalvageably FUBAR state of Earth-8F]. Fortunately, the causal agent is no longer active -- but I'm sure that's little consolation for Mr. Van Hock and his liquefied legs and pelvis.}}\n> \n> {{To make matters worse, the climate is dependent on PTHÅM's mood -- positivity brings warmth, and vice-versa. Being that PTHÅM Himself is screaming and crying [[footnote]] {{Additionally, He has //not stopped// screaming and crying, and is only likely to start calming down within the next three centuries. We clocked the screeching in at 105 decibels at the earliest. I'd include ear protection in the first round of aid packages.}} [[/footnote]] at the bottom of an irradiated crater, the island has gone into a deep freeze.}}\n> \n> {{Which means that the melting locals on the boat are the lucky ones.

Any statements to the contrary are inherently false.}} [[/footnote]] of the Red Crater, Third Prince of Corbenic, and brother of JALAKÅRA -- Father\n\n**Date of birth, if any:** Unknown\n\n**Appearance:** A locust, approximately two meters in length, with the face of a young humanoid.\n\n**Alignment:** Unknown/ambiguous\n\n**__Notes__**\n\n> {{PTHÅM is, in the politest terms possible, a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, He's a minor deity, and has interfered little with the rest of Corbenic. Public opinion is scarce. But from our surveys, what little there is of his reputation can be either \"PTHÅM is a cradle-snatching maniac\" or \"PTHÅM is mysterious, beautiful, and benevolent,\" with the middle ground all but extinct.}}\n> \n> {{Even among deities, there's only debate. Our Blessed Weaver had no knowledge of PTHÅM. We've sent an emissary to Lord ABBAD[[footnote]] {{Note -- Again: useless moocher, stinks, //et cetera//.}} [[/footnote]] and He refuses to even acknowledge His son's existence. The clearest answer we've received comes from the Marble Hall; in-between the Church's attempts to de-escalate the accidental meat orgies, Lord Ghantouris/Elephant King mentioned PTHÅM in passing. [[footnote]] //\"Yo, priesty person, did I ever tell you about PTHÅM? The stupid bug kid on that island in Al-Vathek? Most annoying bastard I've ever had the displeasure to meet. Piece of advice -- if you ever see him, and he asks you if you wanna hear him 'crow,' you get the mothalovin' hell outta there. Not exactly a Strider scream, but... nails on fuckin' marble, I tell ya. ...dunno, just thought of him. Somethin' about you reminds me, I guess. I'm gonna bite your dick off now.\"// [[/footnote]]}}\n> \n> {{The more problematic elements stem from his interaction with several different iterations of Earth. For the past few millennia, He's been in a regular pattern of frequenting parts of Europe to abduct small children \"for adventure.\"[[footnote]] {{**EMERGENCY CLARIFICATION:** the quotation marks are present because this was a direct quote from PTHÅM. Said adventures have been investigated by the Perdition Committee and have been ruled to be mildly dangerous, but ultimately both wholesome and **//__platonic__//**.}} [[/footnote]] In any iteration of Earth where there's a story about PTHÅM and Stella Secundus, it's written by one of these children when they're older -- with the names changed around a bit, so as to avoid unwanted attention.}}\n> \n> {{Hijinks and derring-do aside, PTHÅM is still carrying out a form of human trafficking.}}\n> \n> {{The more objectively troubling issue here is the exposure of adolescents to Compound-Anima-Ventus-8, an arcane substance present in the skin-sheddings of PTHÅM's larvae.}}\n> \n> {{• Pro: it temporarily grants the ability to fly. }}\n> \n> {{• Con: it has been clinically proven to induce acute runic cognitive pyroclasm in mortal subjects in as few as 20 years after exposure.}}\n> \n> {{In addition to His juvenile subjects, Stella Secundus also included two adult human populations in its prime: a tribe of PTHÅM cultists led by a senile shamaness named \"Lî the Unspeakable Black Tiger\" [now incapacitated], and, of course, Wilhelm Van Hock -- (\"Captain Van Hock of Her Majesty's Navy,\" back in his Iteration 1M) and his men, who were taken with their ship by PTHÅM some time ago.}}\n> \n> {{The reason for Van Hock's imprisonment in Corbenic is unclear, but nearly all of PTHÅM's interactions with them have been violent and hostile. Still, from what the old sailor has been telling us, it's more of a longstanding rivalry that they have come to treat as a game -- Stockholm Syndrome?}}\n> \n> {{In short, what we have here is an insectoid demigod with the mind of a 7-year-old. He is not only capable of taking organic matter to and from Corbenic, but also feeds His brain-melting skin chemicals to children He's consensually kidnapped.}}\n> \n> {{It is unfortunate that PTHÅM has been incapacitated, but imperative that He remains that way.}}\n> \n> {{//- Rachel Doppler, Holy Scribe//}}\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Document-5257GR4-3]]\n[[=]]\n++++ Scouting Mission to Incident-5257GR4-Black Ground Zero\n+++++ October 6th, 299\n[[/=]]\n\n> [Drone camera flicks on.

Never fear, for the treacherous crags of this island have been forever engraved upon the meaty cockles of my evil intellect -- and through this fantastic flying thingamabob, I shall part through the red sea of the your unfamiliarity!\n> \n> [Bravo gives a \"wrap it up\" hand gesture to the drone.]\n> \n> **Van Hock:** You're... twirling your hands together. The meaning of this manual maelstrom simply discombobulates me. ...another of PTHÅM's cryptic riddles, perhaps! Little does the fool realize that I, the great Captain Van Hock, am an alumnus of Eton College, where such brain-teasery is --\n> \n> **Alpha:** We have a job to do. Lose the poetics.\n> \n> **Van Hock:** Fie, if only I could, me hearties! But that accursed, wretched PTHÅM bade me be his ridiculous-sounding archnemesis, and so, maledicted my diction to pontificate as such for eternity!

PTHÅM's screeching can be heard in the near distance, drowning out all exterior sound.

Radiation? \n> \n> **Charlie:** 5.5 million μSv. This is definitely where it landed. \n> \n> **Bravo:** Those five rods - what structure was that? Looks like the bomb fell right on top of it.\n> \n> **Van Hock:** 'Tis a mystery, to be sure. Me first mate led a similar expedition to the invisible belly of this equally invisible leviathan of a conundrum -- but alas, the moment he lay his unprotected palms against the horrid metal disc in central terminus, a great malady of unseen chemical horror waylaid his broadside, and the poor fellow hasn't been the same a for moment since. \n> \n> **Alpha:** This disc - is it still here?\n> \n> **Van Hock:** Verily, by Blackbeard's gushing carotid, that it be!\n> \n> **Alpha:** Where is it?.\n> \n> **Van Hock:** HA!

These suits can't --\n> \n> **Bravo:** Fuck. Oh, fuck. This isn't happening.\n> \n> **Alpha:** What's wrong?\n> \n> **Bravo:** These markings -- research and development for the Global Occult Coalition, from Earth-7M. //My// Earth.\n> \n> **Alpha:** I'm not sure I follow -- hang on, you mentioned you were ex-GOC, right?\n> \n> **Bravo:** I was in R&D, too. These rods are blast-resistant surveillance pickups. Looks like they sent an extradimensional monitoring station after the bomb. ...Van Hock, I'm sorry, but my people did this to you. \n> \n> [The drone slowly turns to the direction of PTHÅM, then turns to Bravo. It draws slower to the ground in an apparent attempt to kneel.]\n> \n> **Van Hock:** Good sir, I am in your debt, for you have bested my hated opponent in--\n> \n> [Charlie disables Van Hock's comm again.]\n> \n> **Bravo:** They can probably see us from the other side.
