There was a light smattering of applause and well-wishes, which he waved off with relative good grace. \"Thanks, yeah, yeah. Thanks. It's not a holiday, go back to your microfilm.\"\n\nHe found it curiously difficult to focus on his work today. He had a few documents to review for release to Udo Okorie, scanned at the Wanderers' Library and mailed in an envelope stinking of camphor; he wasn't sure what kind of scanner the Librarians employed, but whatever the iridescent toner smudges were doing was doing a number on his head. There was a backlog of two SCP files to sign off on, but they were low priority and he wasn't at all in the mood. //What __are__ you in the mood for?//\n\nHe shook his head. That was the wrong question. //Since when does mood come into this? Do your damn job.//\n\nHe spent a few hours miserably toiling on things which just a few years ago would have been easy, breezy tasks before the accumulated Coke Zero in his system demanded release, and he stood up. \"Anybody need anything?\" he called out. \"Taking a trip down the hall.\"\n\nVeasna Chey raised her head from a microfilm reader, and quipped \"Oh, don't trip!

Eileen hadn't grinned at anyone, so far as Harry knew, for over a decade. She was wearing a nice suit, not the kind she should have been wearing -- a detainee jumpsuit. \"I'm in a special kind of jail,\" she told him. She held up her ID badge for him to see, and he walked over to examine it.\n\n\"Ethics Committee?\" he laughed. \"Wow, they couldn't just have executed you?\" He had to admit, however, that this inexplicable soft landing after her [[[/lost-in-the-translation|act of treason]]] seemed to have suited her. Her blue eyes were sharp where he remembered them wandering and dull, there were fewer worry lines on her forehead and her back was noticeably straighter.\n\n\"You know how it is,\" she smiled. \"Happens to everyone eventually. You break the rules, and they either break you back, or put you above them. And then you get a whole new set!\" She was practically glowing. He'd never seen her so content. \"Next time they'll probably make me an O5.\"\n\n\"Or a brain in a jar.\" \n\nShe shrugged. \"Either or. Hey, happy birthday. You're getting fat.\" And she poked him in the stomach.\n\nHe doubled over, and it was only half-performance. \"Thanks. Now tell me how old I am.\"\n\n\"We're both old.\" She adjusted her jacket. \"Like a retirement home around here.\"\n\n\"Well, we appreciate you visiting.\" Harry headed for the nearest vending machine, fishing in his pocket for his ID card. \"Don't forget to write.\"\n\n\"I'm not visiting.\"\n\nIt took until he had the next can of Coke open for the import of that statement to register. Something about the sound of fizzing bubbles always set his brain alight. \"Wait, you're //staying?//\"\n\nShe nodded. \"Apparently someone thinks you guys need some extra ethics down here.\"\n\nHe scowled. \"More like they think we need a tighter leash. You spying on anyone in particular, or just everybody?\"\n\n\"Probably just the new hires. All us fogeys are too set in our ways.\"\n\nHe sighed. \"We don't have any new hires, Eileen.\" He held his breath for a moment, then added: \"It's good to have you back. You look... good.\"\n\n\"I //feel// good.

The Chief of Administration and Oversight had the best seat in the house; though the architect had clearly intended them to lord on their underlings from atop it, most occupants of the post had preferred to mingle down below.\n\nElstrom was, as so often, the exception to this rule.\n\nHarry leaned on an empty desk and stared up at her. She managed to look like she was striking a pose, despite sitting down, the back of one hand providing only moral support to her sharp chin. \"Yeah, you definitely wear it well. Maybe //I// should try never smiling.\"\n\nElstrom did smile, though not with particular warmth. \"Our work isn't happy work, Dr. Blank, and I don't have time to uplift you.\"\n\n\"Hard to get leverage from that high on the ivory tower anyway, I imagine.\" He glanced at Elstrom's subordinates, beavering away at the tasks which kept the Site's internal hierarchy properly stratified, then back up at her. \"You end up going anywhere for your birthday?\" It had been just a week before his.\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \"My brother took me out to dinner. He proceeded to announce that his wife was pregnant, and regaled me with all the fascinating details. Did you know,\" and she leaned down conspiratorially, still several feet above his head, \"that human beings are still capable of reproduction? It's apparently a great feat of strength, worthy of repeated praise from all quarters.\" She leaned back, apparently satisfied with the fierceness of her complaint... and then a look of recognition flashed across her eyes, and she almost -- though not quite -- grimaced. \"Ah,\" she added, by way of apology.\n\nHarry waved it off. \"Alright, well. Won't bother you further. Tolerate the rest of your afternoon!\"\n\n\"Wait.\" Elstrom looked uncharacteristically uncomfortable. \"You... doing alright? You've got big ugly bags under your eyes.\"\n\nThis was Elstrom's equivalent to being considerate, so he inclined his head in appreciation. \"I'm fine.

It'll be obvious, when the time comes.\"\n\nOnce again Harry found himself scowling. \"You've been talking to Zwist too much. More cryptic every damn year.\"\n\nThe Director relaxed his posture, and smiled. \"Comes with the job, you know.\"\n\n\"No.\" He folded the paper and tucked it into his labcoat pocket. \"I barely know my own job, at this point. How do you do it, Al?\"\n\nMcInnis waited placidly for something firmer.\n\n\"How do you do the same shit, day after day, and not get worn down? How do you keep up the momentum?\"\n\n\"Oh.\" The Director shrugged. \"I suppose I keep my eye on the prize. I remember what it is I'm working toward.

It disappeared over the edge, hitting the carpet with a plastic //clunk.// \"Precisely as he means to be.\"\n\n\"Leaning into it, Gandalf? Acceptance is the last stage of grief.\"\n\n\"You're every stage of grief.\" He scrunched himself into the cushions, and closed his eyes. \"Happy birthday.\"\n\n\"Happy birthday.

Alright, so half. I don't have access to the top level version of that file, but I'd say, given twenty years of application at half dilution, starting when we were thirty-seven and continuing up to fifty-seven, and using what I can assure you is very complex and sophisticated mathematics well beyond your ken, biologically we're both around--\"\n\n\"Forty-seven, right, okay, yes.\" He grimaced. \"Honestly that's not a lot better.\"\n\n\"A spry forty-seven, though, when you factor in all the other health treatments.\" She leaned forward, squashing a few sheets of paper under her sock feet, and tugged on his long white hair very hard. \"Which makes this performative grandfatherliness a bit hard to take.\"\n\nHe swatted her hand away. \"How long has yours been white for, again?\"\n\n\"That's different. You don't let red like that wither away to nothing. You want people to remember it for how awesome it was.\" Her own mass of blank tangles was tied behind her back. \"Anyway, there's a difference between getting ahead of the curve and being a copycat -- not that I mind the flattery.\"\n\n\"I'm not copying you.\" He squirmed. \"I'm acknowledging the reality. Biology notwithstanding, I'm old enough now to //feel// old.

The whole world sucks. Everything turns grey and falls apart. Why should you be special?\"\n\nHe thought about that for a moment. \"Because I'm me,\" he said finally. \"I see it from the inside, so it's different. I'm //rotting,// Lillian.\"\n\n\"You never struck me as a solipsist. What's the issue? You expected never to get old?\"\n\n\"I don't know.\" He drummed the cushion. \"Maybe I expected to have gotten more done by this point. I've had the same job since before the millennium turned. I don't have any... Melissa can't...\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" Lillian bluntly offramped that tangent for him. \"Go on.\"\n\n\"I'm out of shape, and I've lived down here for so long I can't imagine living anywhere else.

He fell off the couch, knee striking the third laptop hard enough to audibly crunch the lid. \"Ow!\"\n\nShe leaned down over him, white hair on white hair, and snapped \"Or maybe you'll stop moping and //do something,// you whiny fuck.

He wondered who had access to the much faster version of this security theatre which definitely existed for emergency situations, and by the time that thought had passed, the door finally slid open.\n\nHe walked in.\n\nSCP-001-A was sitting on the edge of his simple cot, holding a paperback novel: //Finnegan's Wake.// Harry winced at it. \"Little light gibberish of an evening?\"\n\n\"Chaos keeps the mind sharp.\" The barrel-chested old man smiled up at him. \"To what do I owe the pleasure, Dr. Blank?\"\n\n\"It's my birthday.\" Harry grabbed the visitor's chair and sat down. \"And I'm bored.\"\n\n001-A nodded sagely. \"Would you like me to tell you a bedtime story?

Why is that?\"\n\n\"I don't understand the question.\" 001-A spread his arms wide. \"Are you getting existential on me? Because that is //absolutely// my preferred variety of dread.\"\n\n\"No. What I mean is this: you're old as dirt.

To an empty cell. All your work behind you, and none ahead.

Your first go-around is all a muddled mess, but the second, and the third?

Has your life become so--\"\n\n\"What precisely did that mean?\" Harry asked, deadly calm, feeling his eyes focus in for the first time all day. \"'When you already know the script'?
