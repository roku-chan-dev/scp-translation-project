DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOMES.\"\n\nRING!\n\n“AN ANOMALOUS ENTITY HAS BEEN DETECTED. DO NOT LEAVE YOUR HOMES. THE UNITED STATES SUPERNATURAL PROTECTION AGENCY WILL BEGIN RESCUE OPERATIONS SOON.”\n\nRING!\n\n\"THIS IS THE EMERGENCY BROADCAST SYSTEM.\"\n\nTwo meters above a parked car on Woodland Street, a person popped into existence -- falling and hitting his back atop the windshield. \n\n“Agh, damn it,” moaned Junior as he rolled to his side and slid off the car.\n\n“Ouch, sorry. The calibration on your device is acting a bit weird…An old fashioned, please.” Duchamp's attention was divided as he spoke to a bartender and Junior at the same time. He wasn't paying too much attention to whatever was going on with Junior. \n\nAs Junior looked down the long main street, he finally became cognizant of blaring alarm. \n\n“Hey Duchamp, seems like a containment breach is happening over here.”\n\n“Hmm, shouldn’t be too much of a worry. I kinda know where you're at right now and its vibe. Besides, you'll be back soon, just after you catch that slimy bugger.”\n\n“I know he took Director Gallagher’s wig, but why don’t we just buy another one and pretend it’s the original,” Junior questioned. He started to walk down the street.  \n\n“Haha! That’s the first intelligent thing you’ve said all day. Unfortunately, not many people know this and I’m not supposed to either, but that slob Gallagher taped a key to the bottom of that furball. And that key opens up his desk drawer and with the weird shit in there, he won't ask any janitors to open it up.” \n\nIt was difficult for Junior to follow Duchamp's words as it felt as though the siren began to ring louder. \n\nThe main street was in complete disrepair. Some cars were overturned, others crashed into storefronts. Corpses were littered on the ground here and there. A dead middle-aged man was lying on a bench. He had a //pipe// in his hand.\n\nTowards the south was a colossal plume of black smoke. Despite the obvious eeriness, Junior wasn’t that perturbed. After all, he //was// a member of the SCP Foundation, despite his admittedly low qualifications. \n\n“Hey. Hey! Over here!” A voice came from an alleyway to Junior’s left. He looked over. \n\n“Ugh, it looks like Castro is calling me. I’ll be back in a bit.” Junior’s earpiece disconnected. \n\nFrom the alleyway emerged a middle-aged woman. She grabbed Junior by the hand. \n\n“What’s wrong with you?!” She whispered-shouted and dragged him back towards the alley.\n \n“The mold will eat your damn face off. Idiot! UGH! And now, it might hear us,” quaked the woman. \n\nShe had short-cut auburn hair and wore a bloodstained camo shirt with khaki pants. She was taller than Junior and, noticeably, more muscular. \n\nShe, along with Junior, rushed forward and came upon a van hidden deep within the abandoned alley. The woman slammed opened the van’s side-door and stepped in, still holding onto Junior. \n\nShe threw Junior into one of the seats. He observed that the van was filled with food, guns, army helmets, and other such knick-knacks.\n\n“Did you come from the outside?” she asked still in a whisper. She came up close to Junior. \nHe leaned back. \n\n“Umm, yeah. I’m not quite sure what’s going on actually. I’m looking for someone.”\n\n“Oh, you're one of those. Surprised you made it this far, the relatives of those who live around here get eaten by the mold as soon as they enter the county. How far has it spread? Did you see any army men coming? Wait, first, do you have food with you?”\n\nJunior was perturbed. She was acting erratic, but that was probably just from the ongoing catastrophe around them. Regardless, Junior kept his guard up. What if she was an anomaly in disguise?\n\n“Uh, I’m not too sure. I just arrived here,” he said with caution. \n\nShe sighed and laid back. The woman began speaking as she closed her eyes. \n\n“Its so crazy actually. I haven't talked or seen anyone alive for 2 weeks so I'm not sure what's the situation... Huh... So you didn’t see anything… I might as well escape this damn town…. But I’m worried that they’ll kill anyone who tries to escape, like the government usually does.” \n\n“Yeah, uhh You should definitely do that... I have to leave now. I’m looking for something of mine,” Junior was steady, avoiding the woman’s pleading gaze. \n\n“Wait, before you go. Look at this in my hand.” Junior turned his head. He saw a crystal bracelet in the woman’s hand.\n\n“This is my sister’s bracelet. She managed to take it before the mold took her. Hah…I know there’s so many cases like mine throughout the world. And it’s not even my first sibling to have been killed. I just wish that one day, we will figure out how to get rid of these things, kill them, or even //contain// them. I don’t know.”\n\nThe woman put the bracelet back into her pocket. \n\nJunior felt a twinge of sadness, but he decided to ignore the feeling. He opened the van door and the woman left alongside him. She sat back against the van as Junior began to walk out of the alley. \n\nSuddenly, the goblin appeared a few meters high on the building to Junior’s right, skidding across the brick wall. Something was off. It was abnormally fast this time. \n\n“Damn it! Come over here!” Junior pointed towards the thief, in a futile attempt to attract its attention. \n\nSoon he realized that something was chasing the creature, swallowing the building along the way. A rapid slimey, poofy, moss-like substance was trying to engorge the goblin as it ran along the wall with its sack. \n\n“SHIT!” The woman screamed. She drew a handgun from her back pocket and let off a few rounds into the moss, although she didn't seem to register the futility of her actions. \n\nThe goblin ran deep into the alley and soon jumped onto the woman, snatching the bracelet right out of her pocket.\n\nJunior ran towards the pickpocket, but it jumped right over his head as he tried to grab it. The woman kept shooting at the moss which was trying to consume everything and everyone.\n\nThe goblin fled the alleyway and Junior followed. The woman followed after. \n\nJunior grabbed the goblin’s sack right as they were in the middle of the street. The hooded creature turned around and slashed Junior’s face with its little, sharp claws. The cuts were not deep but it was enough for Junior to jump back. \n\nThe woman ran down the street shouting, \"Good luck,\" to Junior. The moss had finished digesting the alleyway and was now moving towards the two fighting creatures. \n\nThe thief ran off, jumped into a nearby pile of rubble, and vanished. \n\n…\n\nA flash of light overcame everything and transcended even the sun. Junior swiveled towards the source and witnessed a massive, angry mushroom cloud breaking through the sky.  \n\nAnd before the shockwave and heat of the nuclear blast destroyed the moss, the town, and all things in a 50 mile radius, Junior disappeared.\n\n**//[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/dying-in-an-ocean-of-money-was-worth-it/offset/3|Follow Junior?]]]//**",
