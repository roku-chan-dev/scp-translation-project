I, I'm not sure I can do that.\"\n\nYou tell her she can. That you'll be here, you'll help her out. You try to motivate her as you focus on hiding the waver in your voice.\n\n> \"Okay. I- I can do this.\"\n\nShe smiles.\n\n> \"Thank you.\"\n\nIt's so real it feels like you could reach through the TV screen. You wish you could so you could help more.\n\nShe makes her way upstairs to retrieve her weapon.\n\nSneaks into the kitchen. No sign.\n\nShe retrieves a knife, drawing it from the block. You notice another is already missing. \n\nShe turns around. \n\nIt's there. Waiting.\n\nShe charges, knife held with both hands. She swings from the right.\n\nIt dodges.\n\nIt responds by lunging its own knife forward, but she dodges too — its knife ends up embodied in the drywall.

She sees the opportunity and takes it, rushing forward.\n\nIt's a ruse. The entity turns around and sidesteps, grabbing her knife as it does, swinging the girl into the wall. She falls to the floor.\n\nIt raises the weapon.\n\nYou dig your nails into your palms and scream with frustration.\n\nThe girl screams too.\n\nThe tape cuts to black.\n\nYou scream till your throat is hoarse in a futile effort to expel your frustration and sorrow. Blood drips from your palms.\n\n= //[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/it-always-ends-the-same/offset/6 |Continue?]]]//",
