Say that again?\"\n\n\"Christ, it does make sense.\" Ibanez was staring at the ceiling, lost in thought. \"He didn't have it bad as the other ones, he wasn't //immediately// forgettable, and of course his credentials were actually real…\" Her eyes refocused. \"They //were// actually real, weren't they?\"\n\nAlis nodded. \"Far as I know.\"\n\n\"And the lack of security in his quarters.

Anyone monitoring would have had trouble keeping focus for too long…\" Ibanez glanced at her friend, probably her best friend, //when did __that__ happen,// who was still standing and quivering with rage. \"Well, you never had trouble keeping focus on him.\"\n\nUdo looked like she was going to scream.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/53-those-who-cant/DL_53_01_Okorie_Disbelief.jpg]]\n\n\"Neither did Willie,\" Harry pointed out. \"With Alis.\"\n\nAlis winked at him. He blushed.\n\n\"If Dr. Deering was indeed a //geistschreiber,//\" McInnis began, not the faintest trace of surprise or uncertainty in his voice, \"what was his purpose here?\"\n\n\"That part confuses me,\" Alis admitted. \"Going through the records, it looked like he was here to spy on an enemy.\"\n\nLillian looked at the table.\n\n\"What enemy?\" Nascimbeni asked.\n\n\"Del Olmo,\" said Lillian.\n\nThey all looked at her, not that she could see. Her hair fell between them and her own eyes.\n\n\"That's right,\" Alis agreed.\n\n\"What about Del Olmo?\" Harry was looking at McInnis, now. \"I know he had to leave 43, back in, what was it? 2001? While Lil was also gone.\" The coral curtain wobbled agreement. \"What was he doing? Allan, you must know.\"\n\nThe Director nodded. \"I do know. Dr. Del Olmo was our primary agent in persecuting the Forgotten War.\"\n\nLillian's head snapped up. \"Explain.\"\n\n\"He was responsible for seeding the globe with countermemetic counterterrorist cells. Fighting the //giftschreiber// wherever they appeared.\"\n\n\"They call it the Forgotten War,\" said Lillian, her voice tight, her words precise, \"because nobody remembered it. So it //stopped.// You can't forget a war you're still fighting.\"\n\nAlis scoffed. Lillian glared at her.\n\n\"There has been no outbreak of overt hostilities in Canada since the 1980s,\" McInnis nodded. \"But abroad, the reprieve is very much due to Dr. Del Olmo's work. As one of the most accomplished cryptomancers in our employ, he was a vital interlocutor for the Foundation. He kept the war from flaring up again elsewhere.\"\n\n\"Why?\" Lillian's blue eyes were somehow burning.\n\n\"Because we wanted to be the first ones to understand what had happened. What had been forgotten. What had been lost. So that when the fighting began again in this territory in earnest, we would have the upper hand.\"\n\n\"And now he's fucking //dead,//\" Lillian spat. \"So that's going to work out just great.\"\n\n\"Except he isn't dead.\" Alis looked back and forth between them. \"Not here. Not in this, what did you call it? This timeline, anyway.\"\n\n\"Please tell me you didn't tell her what we call them,\" said Harry.\n\nUdo, abruptly, sat back down.\n\n\"I didn't tell her what we call them.\" Lillian seemed to collect herself. \"Okay. Deering was spying on Del Olmo.\"\n\n\"Bullshit.\"\n\nThey all turned to look at Udo. All except Alis, who was visibly trying to figure out what she wasn't being told.\n\n\"Bullshit bullshit //bullshit.// Dougall was on our side. He wasn't one of them.\"\n\n\"I didn't say he wasn't on your side,\" Alis offered in a low, soothing voice. \"But he was definitely one of us.\"\n\nWithout another word, Udo stood up and left the room. The door slammed behind her.\n\nLillian sighed. \"Deering was spying on Del Olmo, //maybe.// And then what? When he didn't die, what happened next?\"\n\n\"Weird way to put it. Having trouble understanding what you told me. Still.\" Alis shook her head slightly. \"He disappeared almost immediately after visiting the Site again in '02. Said he had an assignment abroad. Nobody thought anything of it. He'd disappeared before, all the time.\"\n\n\"Wait a second.\" Harry scooted his chair forward. \"Lil, you have these memories too. Don't you? Why are you making her explain it?\"\n\n\"Because I want to know if she's a liar.\" Lillian's voice was low, scratchy, and dangerous.\n\n\"What, like you?\" Alis asked, sweetly.\n\nThis next silence was thick with the threat of violence.\n\n\"Because that //was// a lie. You don't want to examine your own memories because you don't want to see your mentor running off and doing horrible, awful things to innocent people, and actually own those images. You want me to explain it, so you can, I don't know. Use it as a //working theory.// A //functional fiction.// And put off having to—\"\n\nLillian slapped the papers in front of her across the table, and they fanned past the other woman's face. \"Finish the story, you fucking drama queen. You're pretending to be a wizard, not a psychologist.\"\n\nAlis' smile was still in place. \"Sure. Del Olmo left Site-43, and almost immediately, the Forgotten War came back with a vengeance.\"\n\n\"How much vengeance are we talking?\" Harry asked.\n\n\"Enemy number one. Worse than the Insurgency. Worse than the Sarkic cults. Worse than anything. They've been actively trying to dismantle the Foundation, and they've suddenly been equipped with all the tools to make it work.\"\n\n\"Equipped by who?\" Nascimbeni glanced at Lillian, and shrunk away from her sudden stare. \"Del Olmo?\"\n\n\"No,\" snapped Lillian. \n\nAlis opened her mouth, obviously to say 'Yes', but Lillian suddenly continued. \"Yes. Fine. Yes. But it wasn't really //him.// He's possessed, like the rest of those fuckers. It's using his body, his memories, his abilities, but it is. Not. //Him.//\"\n\nAlis shrugged. \"Same difference, from my perspective. But it's not as personal to me as it is to you.\" She frowned. \"At least, it wasn't. Before he put my husband in a coma.\"\n\n\"Del Olmo did that?\" McInnis asked. \"You're saying he's here, again? At Site-43?\"\n\nAlis nodded. \"He'd been back a few times over the years, but he came home for good a few months ago. That's when all this started. The chaos. The… exhibits.\"\n\n\"Have you any conception of why?\" the Director pressed.\n\n\"All I can tell you is he's here, he's crazy, and he is //crazy// pissed off.\" Alis pursed her lips. \"Tore through this place like a hurricane. Turned almost everyone mad like him. Turned the whole Site upside down. It started slow, but that only lasted maybe a week. People turned up in the hospital, complaining they had gaps in their memories. New memories, old memories. Treasured memories. Traumas. All gone.\" She shook her head. \"Some people had nothing left. He took everything from them.\"\n\n\"And then?\" McInnis asked.\n\n\"And then,\" Lillian finished, \"he started smearing their memories on the fucking walls. That's him. The voice in your head when you look at the murals. That's him, judging them. Judging //everyone.// The ultimate art critic, judging your performance in life. But of course, it //isn't// him.\"\n\n\"It's… //it,//\" said Harry.\n\nLillian nodded.\n\n\"This entire facility,\" she sighed, \"is a six-sevenths-dead half-god's splattered, toxic grey matter.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was a creative couple of months.\n\nIbanez retrofitted the empty offices in M&C as containment chambers, and the Survivors began corralling anyone and anything remotely receptive to corralling into them. At all hours she stalked the safer halls, looking for stragglers who had wandered out of the art world and into her more rationalized one. She was by now dressed to the nines in combat armour liberated from private lockers in the dorms, where a few of the Pursuit and Suppression agents who were regularly on call kept themselves prepared for the worst; she could be found on any given day tackling hollering lunatics, knife-wielding cultists, and aggressive graffitists, hauling them back kicking and screaming, or drooling, or singing, or most often unconscious and/or bleeding. The sapient anomalies, she negotiated with. For the most part. She disintegrated the werewolves on sight.\n\nUdo continued to scrub the corridors, with increasing effectiveness, under Ibanez's watchful eye. When a space was made fully secure, McInnis, Blank and Nascimbeni combed it for the pieces identified in the stolen manifests. Lillihammer and Sokolsky divided their time between constructing their SCRAMBLE goggles and attempting, without much success, to find the combination of memetic triggers that would awaken the thunderstruck personnel. Their preferred test subject was Wettle, as nothing was quite so docile as a coma patient, but they spread the attention around whenever Alis got too testy. She was very possessive of her husband, and nobody liked to think about that too much, so they tried to keep out of her way.\n\nIt wasn't much fun, but it was functional. They still had no means of contacting the outside world, and the brief glimpses they got of the admin sections suggested that protective eyewear would be needed to secure such means. There was food, and there was water, and there was no end of privacy; plenty of empty rooms, and not very many people in their right minds to fill them. Only Ibanez and Nascimbeni took regular advantage of this.\n\nThere was the brief incident with the enormous horde of tiny hippos, but it wasn't like they hadn't seen that coming.\n\nAll told, it could have been much worse. It //had// been much worse, in the first deadline. With enough distance and the right perspective, it could have even been a little entertaining.\n\nIf not for the dreams.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"flashboss\"]]\n[[=]]\n+ ##990099|2016##\n----\n[[/=]]\n\nLillian flipped through the file with such viciousness, McInnis was surprised her nails didn't leave gashes in each page. \"Waste of my time.\"\n\n\"Very possible,\" he agreed.\n\nWettle looked over her shoulder, as very nearly only he could do. \"I've never heard of this before. What is this?\"\n\n\"It's nonsense.\" Lillian slapped the file on the table. \"Complete nonsense. I have too many projects already, Allan.\"\n\n\"You'll forgive me,\" he murmured. \"I'm unfamiliar with your precise availability, or workload. As you'll //recall.//\"\n\nHe saw the extra emphasis do its work. The fact that Lillian had a calling over which he had no direct authority did not bother him; he trusted the Director of the Antimemetics Division implicitly, even though he wasn't entirely sure who was filling that post these days. His memory told him it ought to have been a man, but he couldn't picture the man's face. Marion Wheeler was doing the job, however, and Marion Wheeler was unimpeachable.\n\nStill, it was a little inconvenient being in the dark about the details of his most valuable researcher's portfolio.\n\n\"It doesn't matter,\" she snapped. \"Nothing I've ever worked on is less up my alley than this. That makes it unimportant. It would be unimportant if all I had on my schedule for the day was a bratwurst sandwich.\"\n\nWettle pulled the folder to him. After removing the contents from his lap, and briefly attempting to put them in the right order, he began to read.\n\nMcInnis put on a face. Neutral. Not unapproachable, but not wholly amused. Definitely unruffled. \"Anomalies created by Vikander-Kneed Technical Media,\" he said, \"have affected an ever-increasing proportion of the human population since they first came to our attention. They have branched out to a variety of broadcast and home media, the effects of which range from terror to catatonia to traceless disappearance, and they represent a serious threat to the Veil. I know of only one more vital issue under the umbrella of memetics, and—\"\n\n\"And I'm already on that one. The gift-givers. Sure. That's just one more argument not to dump this in my lap, then. Bus factor.\"\n\nWettle glanced up at her. \"Bus factor?\"\n\n\"If I get hit by a bus, nobody's managing the three biggest memetic threats in the world.\" She winced. \"Two. I meant two.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/53-those-who-cant/DL_53_02_Wettle_VKTM.jpg]]\n\nShe hadn't meant two. \n\nLuckily, Wettle was again not paying attention. He tapped the sheet he was holding, and his finger went right through it. \"Fuck. Uh, why am I in this?\"\n\n\"What?\" Lillian craned her neck, then snatched the sheet out of his hand. \"What're you talking about?\"\n\nHe pointed.\n\nShe blinked.\n\nShe read: \"'Episode Forty-Three: A Star is Born!

Wettle hadn't quite gotten them in the proper order. \"'Vikander-Kneed Presents: Che and Tadeusz! A romance of praxis, in forty-two acts. Anomalous drama.

No, okay. //Okay.// Pardon //me.//\"\n\n\"I don't remember being filmed,\" said Wettle.\n\n\"Permanent memories begin somewhere around three years of age,\" McInnis explained kindly.\n\n\"This is bullshit, though.\" Lillian stared accusingly at the page. \"It's bullshit, right? I mean, what a farce. Twenty-five hours.\" She frowned. \"No, I believe that, actually. He probably got lost on the way out.\"\n\n\"Doctor said she'd never seen a head so big,\" Wettle chimed in. \"Mom told that story for years. Probably still does.\"\n\n\"Hmm.\" Lillian tapped the page thoughtfully, catching her nail in the hole Wettle had poked through it. \"Hmm.\"\n\n\"Yes?\" McInnis prompted.\n\n\"Weren't you on this file, at some point?\"\n\nWettle blinked. \"//He// does //files?//\"\n\nMcInnis kept up the façade. \"A long time ago.

Allan, what are you…?\"\n\n\"Good.\" He breathed in deep, blocking out the voice with the buzzing in his skull. \"Good. Terrific. I'll make sure all the files are sent to your office.

That always got on his nerves. Nascimbeni wasn't old enough to be her father, but they were definitely on that side of the age differential. She had no business even implicitly lecturing him…\n\n\"Well.\" She tapped a button on the machine, and it presumably stopped whirring. He hadn't been able to hear it for years, though from time to time he fancied the bones in his ear were vibrating just //slightly// in tune. It was probably the youth juice doing that. \"It's a good thing you never miss an injection, I'll say that much.\"\n\n\"Say more,\" he sighed. \"Spit it out, so this can be over before we're both in our dotage.\"\n\n\"Fine.\" Forsythe crossed her arms. \"If you didn't have anomalous medical treatment, you'd be dead of a heart attack already.\"\n\nAt the end of the bed, examining his chart, Billie looked up in surprise. Nascimbeni tried not to look at her.\n\n\"You're burning the candle at both ends, and probably in the middle too. Last I checked — and I've got very good records to check, here — you're not the only technician in this facility. Do you want to see your granddaughter make it to high school?\"\n\nNascimbeni frowned. \"She's already in high school. I told you that last time.\"\n\nForsythe bit her lip, and Billie looked away.\n\n\"What?\" he said.\n\n\"Nothing.\" The portly doctor punched a button on the monitor, and it began an old-fashioned printout. \"Never mind.

She'd always been very pale, but this was something else.\n\nShe reached down, past the edge of the bed, and when her hand came back up it was clutching a telephone receiver. Old style.

It had been purchased from the Canadian government for certain privileges which Harry was not yet cleared to fully know about, and plied the waters of Lake Huron for decades before being mothballed, sunk, and kept in storage at Site-246 at the bottom of Lake Superior. Foundation vessels were never scrapped, because then they'd have to monitor all the scrapyards for anomalous occurrences. The old boat had been re-floated, restored, and brought back into service for this specific task, because old-timey people on an old-timey ship were less likely to draw attention, and if they did, it could all be explained away as a botched historical reenactment.\n\nThe costumes certainly didn't match the setting.\n\nAs the passengers debarked, Harry checked them against his manifest. \"Name?\" he asked, as a portly man in a Victorian conductor's outfit strolled toward him.\n\n\"Dudley Belcher.\"\n\nHarry stifled a laugh, and found the name. \"Right. Bandleader. Do you know 'Those in Peril'?\"\n\nThe other man scoffed. \"Bad taste, chap. Bad taste. Jinx the whole thing. Need to learn from history, wot wot?\"\n\n\"Right.\" He smiled, because it was either that or laugh after all. \"Wot wot. Get on the truck.\"\n\nBelcher looked past him at the first of several transportation vehicles. \"What make and model is //that,// if I might ask? It looks…\" He sniffed disdainfully. \"It looks distinctly //Gallic,// to my eyes.\"\n\n\"Teutonic, actually.\"\n\n\"Ah.\" The man's expression brightened. \"Well, that's alright then. Cheerio.\" And off he went.\n\nOver the course of the next half-hour, Harry catalogued the crew and passengers of the late //RMS Gigantic,// a vast ocean liner which had never even existed. A bafflingly ornate public prank by a long-dead novelist had caused the thing to manifest anyway, year after year, steaming down the English channel and necessitating wide-ranging coverups that became increasingly unwieldy in the age of amateur video. It had been Harry who'd proposed the ultimate solution, waylaying the ship, unloading its passengers, and seeing it off to the conceptual afterlife. The whole thing had turned out to be a particularly effective exercise of the public imaginary, and with a little, okay, more than a little fudging of the historical record and some choice media insertions, they'd been able to redirect the plot.\n\nNow all that was left was disposing of over five hundred brutal British caricatures — disposing was the wrong word, totally the wrong word — and then treating himself to a celebratory tour of Yorkshire. He'd never been out of North America before, and he was looking forward to it.\n\nThere was only one man left on the ship, now, and he staggered down the gangplank with exaggerated ease. He was pale, barrel-chested, and his eyes were black as night. \"What ho!\" he called.\n\n\"Don't look at me,\" Harry called back. \"Name?\"\n\n\"Oh, I don't have a name.\" The man reached the pier, and clapped Harry on the shoulder. \"Lots of titles, no name. But you know that. We're already acquainted.\"\n\nHarry turned over the last page of the manifest, then turned them all back down again. There were no more passengers or crew to cross off. In fact, all the sheets were now heavily redacted. \"Who are you?\"\n\nThe old man took his other shoulder, too. \"Who are we, you mean. We're brothers!\" He turned Harry to face the trucks, which began moving off down the road without him. \"I'd know your work anywhere.\"\n\n\"What?\" Harry wanted to cry out, to make the trucks stop, but they were already gone.\n\n//Like trains down the rail,// the man growled in his ear. //Off for the camps.//\n\nHarry spun. The old man's face was drawn, the skin paper thin on a grinning skull. \"It isn't like that,\" he protested. \"We're just going to freeze them.\"\n\n//Freeze, cook, it's all the same to you people.// The spectre's breath was like a dead swamp. //Human beings are so much __meat__, eh? Wot wot.// The hands clapped, and Harry's shoulders shook with the impact. //Maybe between the two of us, we'll get the whole lot, next time 'round!//\n\nOn the pier, the //Honoré Beaugrand// was sinking. They both walked to the edge of the pier to watch it go.\n\nEven at the bottom of the bay, Harry fancied, he could still see every inch of the thing with perfect clarity.\n\nWhich, of course, he had to.

In another, it was like trading a life-giving breath for the flat, dry sterility of space. She was covered head to toe in blood; smeared across her visor, smeared across the plates of armour, seeping into every joint and crevice. She couldn't wait to pull the helmet off and suck down the free, clean oxygen. But she also wished that the fight had been longer, the competition more fierce, and most of all, that there had been more Insurgents to face in the twisty, trap-filled corridors of the now very silent Firebase.\n\n//Both glasses half full,// she decided, as she headed out the front door.\n\nThe front door opened on a cave. This wasn't the way she'd entered, blowing the bolts on an access hatch at the bottom of a narrow crevasse she'd created herself, but it was the designated exit point for when the job was done. The front-facing security was so much smouldering rubble, and there wasn't a soul left behind her who could operate a weapon, or so much as press a button. There were prisoners, of course, but they wouldn't be a problem. None of them had arms that bent the right way anymore.\n\n\"Rozálie?\" she called, but there was no answer. Of course there wasn't. She wasn't down here…\n\nThe cave sloped down to a shallow pool, or rather, what she had taken at first to be a shallow pool. It was meant to be shallow, but now it seemed deep. Very deep. And very wide, and as she looked up from the crimson water, startled, she saw fire on the horizon where she knew a cave wall ought to be.\n\n//You're too late,// said Rozálie, and Ibanez looked back down at the pool and the body floating face-down within it.\n\n\"There were more of them than we thought,\" said Ibanez. \"It took… it took longer than I thought.\"\n\n//I went on ahead.// The body bobbed up and down in the water. It spoke in a voice like planes overhead. There was an ugly, dark red hole in the back of its skull, wide enough that it probably went all the way through to the front.\n\n\"I thought I'd have enough time.\" Ibanez reached up to remove her helmet, but it wouldn't budge. She suddenly felt that she really would like that gulp of fresh air, after all.\n\n//You'll never have enough.// Was the voice even Rozálie's? It didn't sound very much like her. But the corpse, the corpse was definitely hers. Spindly limbs and a visible spine. //You never add. You only subtract. Subtract. Subtract. There's already nothing. Soon there will be even less.//\n\nShe tried the helmet again. Damn, but it was on tight. She was having trouble breathing.\n\n//You left me.// In her panic, struggling against the suit clasps, Ibanez had a crazy thought: was that her voice? Her own? //You ran inside. You left us all. We're still there, Fina. We're all still there. Where are you?//\n\n\"Yésica?\" she cried, as the corpse sank into the pool and her helmet began to fill with water. \"Yésica?!\"\n\n[!-- [[=image Ibanez_Astrauskas_Pool.jpg]] --]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"udoflashback\"]]\nThe sky was coming for her.\n\nUdo stood nude in the desert sands, the moons baking her skin, and she watched the black clouds roil and rage. \n\nThere was hatred there, hatred older than the first slight, the first mistake, perhaps even the first coherent thought. \n\nRage that had risen from the pullulating amygdalas of ancient lizards on shores that had long since dried to dust, rage that had cultured like bacteria in the warm waters of the runaway noöspheric rhizome, rage that would consume and subsume the world, however she cared to define it.\n\nAnd the rage spoke:\n\n\"Freak.\"\n\nIt spoke with her voice.

CLIO was meant to manage the archives, of course.\"\n\n\"Of course.\" Blank had been pressing for help with his extensive catalogue of documents, anomalous and anomalous-adjacent, for decades. Most of the time Veiksaar had been working on her .aic, she'd been dating the man. \"Why do you wish she'd finished it?\"\n\n\"So I could test out some of the worse ones.\" She slapped the deck on the workbench, for emphasis. \"Some of them work on electronic life. They were //developed// with electronic life.\"\n\nNascimbeni vaguely recalled the details; he'd provided some of the hardware Veiksaar, Lillihammer and Euler had used. But the science of memetics was nothing he particularly cared about. He preferred constructs he could actually see, set hammer to, put nails in. His heart was pounding when he asked, nevertheless: \"What would you test first?\"\n\nLillian considered. \"Sleep agent, probably. Same sort of thing that hit Willie. We're pretty sure we've already got those licked, but it would be nice to get total confirmation.\"\n\n\"I could try it out, if you want.\" She turned to face him fully, and raised a brow. He leaned on his own workbench, which was spotless in the absence of anything much that needed carpentry, welding, or nonspecific tinkering, and shrugged. \"I mean, you've got all the filters installed, right? Even if it doesn't work properly, I won't get it full force. An extra night's sleep, is all. Right?\"\n\n\"Right,\" she agreed, though there were enough extra vowels in it to convey a little uncertainty. Not in the facts, but in his intentions. \"You that eager to get us out there, Chief?\"\n\n\"Yes.\" He sighed. \"I'm sick of being stuck here. I want to know what's going on topside. I want to see if my family's okay.\"\n\n\"They're not your family, though.\" Lillian picked up the cards again, pulled off the elastic, and shuffled them absent-mindedly. \"Your family is back in baseline.

Ibanez was the first to give it a test drive, for multiple reasons; most pertinent was her long experience moving through hostile territory in armour, least pertinent was the fact that this first set was too small to fit on Harry's head. Lillian pretended this was merely inconsiderate, but Ibanez knew better. The canny memeticist had intentionally cut off the option of using her best friend as a test subject.\n\nIbanez wasn't offended. She wouldn't have let anyone else get dibs anyway.\n\nAfter running her through a series of defanged murals in M&C, Lillian led her on a course through several more difficult passages. The goggles occluded each affected surface before her conscious mind could see what was on them, and she wondered at the vague disappointment in her gut for a moment before she understood. She'd imagined, stupidly, that the scrambler would enable her to see what the halls really looked like. She'd imagined they must look quite beautiful. But of course, all that was rendered on the screen was a pastel blur in every direction. She could navigate the three-dimensional space with ease, but she couldn't make hide nor hair of any single decoration.\n\nBecause that was the point, wasn't it.\n\nLillian left her at the extent of their demesne, with no words of encouragement but a gentle pat on the back, which she needed to stoop to deliver. Ibanez stepped into the haze of colour, set her shoulders high, and placed one hand on the stun baton at her hip.\n\nIt was time to tour the gallery.\n\nIt would have taken much longer to wend her way to Nascimbeni's concrete kingdom through the dormitories, so she was heading past Eileen's office in I&T instead. As always, there was new work on the walls they had previously scoured; more novel was the presence of the artists, engaged with rapt attention in their work.\n\nThe occupants of the Site had scattered like centipedes in the light whenever the Survivors had entered their space. Harry had compared it to a line from //The Hobbit,// something about how the little folk still existed on the fringes of society but could hear the elephantine gallumphing of humanity a mile off; this had occasioned a brief argument over to what extent Ibanez herself qualified as a hobbit, and whether this made it more or less appropriate to send her into the Shire.\n\n//Focus,// she thought. //Or, rather, __unfocus__ in the right direction.//\n\nThis time, without the scrubbing screen to spook the natives, she caught occasional glimpses of the lost personnel of Site-43. There was an orgy in the I&T boardroom, with pairings she was certain wouldn't have worked out back in baseline. The SCRAMBLE unit conveyed wavelengths of warbling which almost seemed musical, and probably in their base form actually were. She was glad she couldn't hear it, though it looked like everyone was having fun. Sandy Holt, one of her agents — no, one of //Pensak's// agents — was putting the last touches on a photorealistic depiction of a pair of bright red denim shorts on a computer lab window. She winked at Ibanez, and Ibanez smiled tightly. She wondered what that looked like on the other side of the visor. Four men she didn't recognize were standing next to a photocopier, and a Māori woman from Pursuit and Suppression named Kiri Ngata was smashing their faces into the copy plate, over and over, while it printed an endless catalogue of increasingly bloody bruises. The man were laughing. At least one was missing all of his teeth, and the smile was gushing blood.\n\nAs always, there were signs of the catastrophic decontainment that must have taken place on the first sublevel. One of the printing rooms was filled with the bloated bulk of a gelatinous worm, and Ibanez could see the hole where it had burrowed down through all the membranes, half-floors and bedrock to coil around the wreckage of the press. Nascimbeni was going to have his work cut out for him when it was time to do the stability survey…\n\n//God __damn__ it, Noè.//\n\nOne of the meeting rooms was full of I&T techs in their proper outfits, talking animatedly. There was a slideshow on the projector, and the goggles dutifully blocked out its contents. They were speaking loudly enough that the sound made it through the thin glass, and she tapped a button on the side of the visor. The goggles reported that their speech was identical to natural language English with information technology terms sprinkled throughout, as might be expected from such a setting. There was, apparently, no underlying grammar.\n\n//So, nothing new there.//\n\nI&T put her in mind of one of those maze screen savers that had been popular in the 1990s, all right angles and brightly coloured walls, though of course the reality would be somewhat more complex. It was tempting, so tempting, to reduce the scrambling effect and see what was really going on, and that of course explained why virtually everyone in the Site had already fallen to madness.\n\nBut though the public art show ran through the once-drab Back End to no lesser extent than it had R&E and H&S, there were far fewer signs of life. Something about the space had always been oppressively bland, and perhaps it had been deemed less conducive to ongoing creative works. It was just a guess. Ibanez hadn't done anything creative since the late 1990s.\n\nNobody tried to stop her. Nobody stood in her way. The occasional painter or singer or dancer or smasher-of-tiles-into-powder or indecent exposer waved, or smiled, or nodded, or in one memorable case gave her a big bear hug and ran away giggling — it was good to see that Yancy was still alive, and still in beyond excellent shape — but if they considered her a threat to their way of life, which she most certainly was, it didn't show in their reactions. They probably thought this was show-and-tell.\n\nWell, she'd show //them.//\n\nIt was tempting to swing down south through one of the Security and Containment satellites, but she figured she ought to pass through as few unique biospheres as possible on this first trek, so she took the direct route into J&M instead. This brought her first past the massive water tanks, which looked like bright green, yellow, and purple cylinders to her, though the goggles informed her they were actually immaculate representations of cucumbers, bananas, and eggplants; the septic pools, which shimmered in waves of iridescent colour she could only glimpse in the hyperabstract; and then the heating plant, where strange clouds of condensation bobbed in the breeze and formed images in Socialist Realism style of workers at work, and union members on the march, though from her perspective it was all just so much red and black mist. Lillian's shortlist was comprised entirely of ventilation shafts for the Site's geothermal plants. Her reasoning was derived not from Rydderech's cryptic hints, which she passed on to the group, but rather from some personal understanding she was reluctant to share. Ibanez visited the first location on her way to the fabrication plants: one of the shafts, a small one, was accessed via a back passage she had used over a decade ago to get the literal drop on one of Ana Mukami's clones. Cool air rushed up around her from the pit, and she couldn't see the bottom from the encircling rail. If there was anyone down there, they had almost certainly suffocated to death.\n\nHer road ended finally at the fabbers, which to her tremendous relief were still mostly intact. One of the massive machines had been disassembled, its parts cannibalized to create an enormous metal robot which turned to watch her as she approached the main conveyor unit and scanner; she took her hand off the stun baton and slung it over her shoulder in what she hoped looked like a casual gesture, though her fingers closed over the butt of the Bremmelgun.\n\nTwo electronic headlamps, probably pilfered from one of the cars parked in AAF-A's garage, blinked placidly at her, and then the robot resumed its survey of the empty fabrication hall.\n\nShe sighed.\n\nThe other reason she'd been chosen for this mission was her background in engineering. The tour was over; the remainder of her duty would be less artistic, and far more technical.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n\n++ 25 February\n----\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"muddle\"]]\nAcroamatic Abatement Facility AAF-C is the least hands-on and least specialized of the three still-active refineries at Site-43. The majority of its plant is a series of parallel tanks, with only a small factory floor wherein water from Lake Huron is chemically and ritually purified, esoteric effluence from various sources is analyzed for matter state and toxicity, and both are pumped through a targeted subset of the twenty treatment vats for reduction. The average shift size for AAF-C is four: two experts in Acroamatic Abatement, one stationed at the water tanks and the other at the testing array, and one technician prowling each set of ten vats on the lookout for leakage, breakage, or plugs.\n\nThere is no emptier space in the entire Site, and no station on the Inter-Sectional Subway is less frequently patronized. The trains don't even stop, outside of shift change, unless a rider makes the request. New members of personnel are often confused by the homonymous local terminology for a person who's drifted too far from companionship: \"Out to C.\"\n\n[[>]]\n-- Blank, //Lines in a Muddle//\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\nLillian Lillihammer was not one for small talk.\n\nShe initiated it sometimes, when she had something to say, or wanted to ingratiate herself with someone she expected to do something for her. But she had no patience for it when it ran in the other direction, and anyone prone to chatting up a storm would see her sailing away more often than not.\n\nShe was fond, however, of big talk masquerading as small talk.\n\n\"This is boring,\" she said. It was boring. AAF-C was the least-adorned space they'd moved through yet; she and Alis were headed for the end of the tank sequence, on the weakest of her hunches, and though there was still plenty of art to not look at, there wasn't a soul around and the ones whose occupancy was evidenced hadn't hung around very long. There were long stretches of maintenance tunnel with no paint on them at all, and none of the //bric-a-brac// of everyday living they'd seen elsewhere: sleeping bags, cardboard boxes, trash and used prophylactics. She expected their journey to be equally unedifying. Nineteen of the twenty tanks were still churning away, full, but the twentieth, right on the end, was empty. It was sunk deep into the bedrock, in a natural niche, and it could theoretically contain their target.\n\nBut it wouldn't. So, she pretended to chatter harmlessly. There was a topic of conversation she'd cut off at the stem over a month ago, because she'd heard all she needed to know at the time. She was determined that she wouldn't leave AAF-C without learning something new, and since an empty tank manifestly did not count, well, it was time to revisit.\n\n\"So, they're dead.\"\n\nAlis glanced at her, which required actually turning her head. It took the SCRAMBLE sets a second to determine what to do when you pointed one at the other; the other woman's face was momentarily rendered as a low-poly model of itself, like something out of a PlayStation game, before resolving into the usual banal visage. \"They?\"\n\n\"The twins.\" As always, Lillian had made determining the whereabouts of the three //geistschreiber// one of her first priorities in the new deadline. Alis had dropped nearly into Nascimbeni's lap, and once it had become obvious she was already on their side, the question and answer session had been brief and to the point. No small talk.\n\nAlis grimaced. \"Yes. Like I told you. They're dead.\"\n\n\"How?\"\n\n\"Stopped being alive.\"\n\n\"I don't like your impression of me.\"\n\nAlis shrugged noncommittally, and shone her flashlight over the walls. The colours on Lillian's screen brightened, and for a moment she wondered whether the light filters would be able to adjust for the sudden change, or if her companion had found a novel new way to betray her… but no, no, they held. It was difficult, judging how much paranoia was too much.\n\n\"How did they die?\"\n\nAlis sighed as she climbed the wire mesh stairs ahead, and glanced down at the pipes far below. Lillian looked, too. They were painted, her display informed her, to resemble tree roots. \"Imogen killed Madchen, and Del Olmo killed Imogen.\"\n\nLillian stopped walking. //So much for doing this casually.// \"What?\"\n\nAlis sighed again, deeper this time, and leaned on the railing at the top of the rise. Lillian waited below, so that the other woman's head was a few feet higher than hers. \"I told you the //giftschreiber// are the biggest threat the Foundation is facing, now.\"\n\n\"Uh huh.\"\n\n\"Well, they're not an //existential// threat. They're a threat to the Veil. Because they haven't had the chance to really let loose with all barrels. Because—\"\n\n\"They're fighting a civil war.\"\n\nAlis regarded her curiously. \"How'd you know that?\"\n\n\"Extrapolation.\"\n\n\"Huh. Well, yeah. The sisters were on opposite sides of that. I always thought they were close. Too close, even. More committed to each other than the cause. Kind of like you guys.\"\n\nLillian let that pass without comment.\n\n\"I thought that right up until the day Imogen told her sister's heart to stop beating. She tried to blow up the Site, too. Did you know there's shaped charges… you did. Alright.\" Lillian had begun nodding immediately. \"Well, it came as a shock to the rest of us. That was at the start of the troubles. Del Olmo took her in for questioning, the first time he came back, and nobody ever heard how that came out. Never saw her again.\"\n\n\"So how do you know she's dead?\"\n\n\"I checked the AcroAbate logs, and cross-referenced with Imogen's last physical. Plenty of markers make the transition cleanly for the first few steps of titration. It was her.\"\n\n\"Dumped in the sump.\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well, that's cheery.\" She tried to picture Bernabé Del Olmo murdering a woman in cold blood, then immediately stopped trying because it was almost too easy. He'd been a gentle, curious, clever man, but he'd also been driven and mysterious. He could certainly kill, possessed or not, if the need was great.\n\nThey had that in common.\n\nShe'd learned that by murdering the exact same woman, only in her case, the murder had stuck.\n\nThat didn't bear thinking on, but it was also the obvious end of the tangent. As they made their way to the south end of the complex, Lillian found herself so starved for distraction that she nearly gave in and attempted actual small talk… before something that had been nipping at the coat-tails of her mind finally got up the gumption to take a sizeable bite, and she physically shuddered. \"Okay. Wait. Why do you think he came back?\"\n\n\"What, in 2002?\" They were almost to the final tank.\n\n\"No. Last year. Why'd he come back to Site-43, if he was out there managing a war on three fronts?\"\n\nAlis shrugged as they approached the thick glass window of Plasmic Abatement Tank Bravo. \"I dunno. Maybe they won?\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nTo reach the foyer of Habitation and Sustenance, where the wreckage of the topside elevator glowed a cardinal red that would not fade, McInnis had to slog an interminable winding path through clogged arteries and dorm rooms with the connecting walls knocked out. He interrupted no less than four copulating couples, and one very complex octuple. He waded through garbage immaculately catalogued with an old-time label maker. He was compelled to dance a jig to pass one particular choke point, and while the vague memory of a scene from Monty Python contextualized the experience, it made it no less embarrassing. But the foyer itself? The foyer was safe.\n\nMemetically speaking.\n\nHis SCRAMBLE set told him that nothing on the cubic surfaces was projecting a measurable memetic effect. Ibanez's set agreed. If anything was being projected here, humans and humanoids were outside of the target audience. They tuned down the filters a little, and what they saw on the walls and floor and ceiling was only marginally less striking than what they saw walking between, on top and beneath them.\n\nThe seal of Site-43 was gone, and in its place was a startlingly complex floral pattern branching out from the centre of the room and cobwebbing across the massive space, festooned with amber and carmine flowers. The walls featured a cavalcade of mythological creatures, lifelike despite their stylization, interacting and posing and most often gazing out at the inhabitants of the foyer. McInnis recognized the style immediately, of course: bright primary and secondary colours, separated by thick black lines, forms abstracted but recognizably themselves. Anishnaabe art, in various regional permutations.\n\nWhich made sense, since the Anishnaabe were here as well.\n\nThe people of Kettle Point had decamped in one of the Site's largest expanses of flat floorspace. Woolen blankets and painted tarpaulins designated living, eating, and congregating spaces. What he could only assume were family groups clustered around campfires on the tiles; the smoke detectors had been removed from the ceilings, and the sprinklers apparently rerouted, since there was no trace of the gas that had otherwise permeated the dorms. The electric lights had all been put out, though whether this was in approximation of night, required for some ritual purpose, or simply permanent, he couldn't tell. The ceiling was thick with smoke. The people were laughing, telling stories, singing, dancing, sitting in quiet contemplation, or extending the reach of their art. They paid no heed to their visitors, which also made sense, since they were already hosting much stranger ones.\n\nThe lords of the beneath-world strode between the fires, or sat close to them for warmth, copper tails flicking this way and that as a subtle reminder they were nobody's pets. Strange, spined things lurked at the edges of the firelight, their forms bending and distorting with each flicker and crackle. Tiny humanoid figures flitted from cover to cover, nimble fingers relieving the former occupants of Kettle Point of their belongings or else being brushed aside with good humour when they were noticed. At the central fire, a tall and beautiful woman with cloven hooves was speaking to a rapt audience of fellow females, who periodically shooed apparently entranced males away whenever they approached.\n\nEvery manner of anomalous creature known to inhabit Nexus-94 had come back to the stolen land to roost.\n\nPerhaps literally; there was the occasional ominous rumbling, and a shuffling of what sounded like thousands of vast feathers, from the shaft of the ruined elevator.\n\nThe All-Sections Chief stood near the Hiring and Regulation offices. He was still wearing a silk dress shirt, his wing-tip shoes, and his tie. He hadn't changed a bit, except perhaps around the forehead and eyes.\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/53-those-who-cant/DL_53_07_ASC_Happy.jpg]]\n\n\"He seems happy,\" Ibanez offered.\n\nMcInnis nodded.\n\nThey decided not to bother him.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nNever being wrong was less efficient than it sounded.\n\nNot because being wrong conveyed more valuable lessons than being right; if that had been the case, Lillian would have contrived to be off base as often as possible. \n\nNo, it was because never being wrong meant considering the possibility that you //could// be wrong, before it mattered, and taking steps to make that eventuality also play out in your favour.\nThere was no vent in Archives and Revision, but the salt caves ran deep. The fact that she sent Harry suggested she thought it was possible, if not likely, that Del Olmo would be back there; of all their number, he was the one she most trusted to run back and fetch her rather than tackling the problem himself.\n\nThe fact that she sent Udo meant she still found their decaying cosplay entertaining.\n\nThe Replication Studies office had been painted with recursive images of itself. This both required an incredibly sophisticated understanding of both perspective and draftsmanship, and a painfully literal mind. The AAF-D approach was a good distance off, but the SCRAMBLE units suggested that where there was a mural of the Victims back in baseline, here there was a ceiling-to-floor splash of geometric shapes somehow collectively conveying the single semantic concept of Bernie Del Olmo.\n\n\"What I want to know,\" said Harry, \"is how they programmed these things to know all that shit.\"\n\"Remember my part in making the memorial?\" Udo was waiting for him at the double doors to the Salt Mines. \"Breaking down memory cubes into paint? They did a lot of work reconstituting that stuff into code. Memes are almost entirely online now.\"\n\n\"Appropriately enough.\"\n\n\"Sure. So, they've got a massive database of effects meticulously documented. The goggles are just drawing on that.\"\n\nHe almost asked how it was possible that this database had been replicated, since it probably didn't exist in the same form in this deadline, and then he remembered Lillian's unique talent, and didn't. \"Still.\" \n\nHe glanced back the way they'd come. \n\nA man in a bathrobe was walking barefoot down the hall, leaving bloody footprints behind him. Another man with smaller feet followed, blue paint on his soles, matching the strides and flood filling the existing trail save for the outlines. \n\nHarry shook his head. \"It's amazing what those two got done in a few weeks, when a thousand of these idiots have accomplished less in half a year than the average half-decent street artist.\"\n\nThe furniture in the main office space hadn't been moved, but it had been covered over. Every surface, including the desks and chairs, was wrapped in a papier mâché of what was almost certainly his most dangerously anomalous documents, the ones kept in the dark on laundry lines and never viewed with the naked eye. It was a guess, but an educated one; the protective laminations were piled in a corner of the next room, glowing like radioactive waste.\n\nThe archives were full of sound, but neither of them could hear it. Their display would only offer a cryptic \"Choral variations on the subject of the number five\" as a description. \n\nThe sound wasn't being piped in, but the singers, if they were real, were invisible.\n\nThe actual salt mines had been ransacked, which was no mean feat. It would have taken hundreds of people weeks to dismantle the archives so fully. Boxes were strewn everywhere, tens of thousands of them. Many were piled up in makeshift art studios full of craft supplies. Several of the towering racks had been pushed over. One of the conveyors was running, feeding a single sheet at a time into a standing flame with agonizing slowness. \n\nA woman in engineer's blues and nothing else — Harry looked away, but it looked like Joanna Bremmel — was crawling on all fours and placing printed sheets side by side on the floor, then standing up to scrutinize the results, presumably attempting to create ASCII art with found materials.

The deepest of the geothermal heat vents was producing no heat; according to a LIDAR survey he'd managed to get half-done before some loon noticed the drone, plucked it out of the air, and started using it to spatter the bedrock with paint like an industrial sprayer, the reason for this was a massive series of new caves carved beneath the existing ones. \"Probably the water cats,\" he'd shrugged. \"Back at work at last.\"\n\nSo, that was where Del Olmo would be hiding.

They were tunneling through bedrock, and being very careful not to create a path that was in any danger of collapsing — particularly since there was a very good chance they would need to flee back down it in the near future. Mostly the cuts were so smooth, and the rock so solid, that the curvature kept everything upright without the need for supportive stanchions. It wasn't all the gun doing that heavy lifting; Del was, after all, a trained engineer herself. Occasionally she left standing columns where the stone was more prone to crumbling or other deformation, or just because she felt it had been too long since the last one. In the far distance, an air pump was whining as it pressed the Site's atmosphere down into this new offshoot of the tunnels the Mishepeshu had been carving beneath the redirected shaft.\n\nThey were almost there, and Del had dialled the gun down so low that it was barely audible as it obliterated the stone ahead.

But Harry suspected it wouldn't go down quite that way. Nevertheless, it had been decided that she would be the one to make the first overture. Del had assured everyone that if it showed even the faintest trace of going south, she was going to put a targeted ray right through the rogue memeticist's forehead, and set them on the path to a happy September without remorse.\n\nHarry knew Lillian would almost certainly position herself so that this was impossible, but he didn't say so. He trusted his best friend's motives and capabilities, and anyway, Del probably knew it just as well.\n\nThe little agent carved a wider space for them all to stand abreast, which took a few more minutes, then looked up at Lillian with what might have been the grimmest face Harry had ever seen on her. She was waiting for the order to proceed.\n\nLillian nodded, and moved to stand beside her.\n\nDel took careful aim, and removed the final obstacle between them and the architect of Site-43's museum of metamodern art.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nHe was leaning on the far wall of the enormous cylinder, pounding his fists into a slurry of wet blue paint. He was weeping. The floor was littered with foul-smelling debris in every colour of the spectrum, bones and gristle sticking up out of the slop piles, surrounded by paint-spackled flies. Lillian tore her eyes off Del Olmo's tattered meme coat and looked up, up, up, and saw trails of blood and paint running down from the observation railing some two hundred metres above. She wondered if the corpses surrounding her on all sides had belonged to amateur painters whose scaffolds had failed, or if they'd simply been making very simple statements on the artistic power of absolute freedom by leaping to their deaths on purpose.\n\nNot that it mattered.\n\nNothing else mattered but the hunched and weeping figure which had not so much as twitched when the wall opposite him had suddenly evaporated, and Lillian had walked into his final exhibit.\n\nHe had been painting, she saw. The entire circumference of the shaft bottom was covered in breathtakingly beautiful Mandelbrot sets; the SCRAMBLE unit dulled the edges and abstracted the contents, but even then she could tell that she was looking at the work of the master, not the students. The topographical display showed her where niches had been hammered into the rock, to allow Del Olmo to climb up higher and continue his //pìece de résistance,// which towered over her to a height of about fifty metres. She couldn't imagine how long it would have taken him to create it, or how dangerous the process must have been. His coat was covered in gore, however, and she suspected he'd fallen down a few times in the process. Perhaps he'd arranged the viscera to soften the blow.\n\nIt was hard to see him now, between what the unit was doing and what her eyes were doing, so she took a deep breath and corrected both issues.\n\n\"What are you //doing,//\" Harry hissed from behind her as she placed the unit on the bedrock floor, and finished wiping her eyes with the sleeve of her jacket. At the sound, Del Olmo finally turned to face her.\n\nShe stood up, and met his eyes for the first time as truly herself.\n\n\"You,\" he said. His voice was weak. He was visibly emaciated, his hair an irrecoverable disaster, his beard long and covered with dried food — there were empty cans all over the floor, she saw now, and a tarpaulin with a pile of clothes in the middle that he must have been using for a bed and pillow. \"You.\"\n\nShe summoned a smile from somewhere deep down inside of her, some place of affection that couldn't be touched by the nightmarish scene and the knowledge of what it must mean, and nodded. \"Yes. It's me, Bernie.\"\n\n\"//You.//\" He blinked, rapidly. \"It //would// be you. Of course. Who else?\" He laughed, and even as a brief burst of noise, it sounded unhinged. Lost. \"Who else.\"\n\nShe reached into her coat's breast pocket. He flinched, and she kept the hand in place. \"Don't be afraid. It's just me. I'm here.\"\n\nShe hoped the others had the sense to stay put. She hoped they weren't filing in behind her. She'd told them not to, but it was sometimes difficult to decide between what someone said they needed, and what you thought you had to do.\n\nDel Olmo extended his arms and raised his hands, palms up, to encompass the extent of his creation. \"Welcome to my failure, brother.\"\n\nIn an instant, the smell of the place, the oppressive glow of the fractals on the wall — her conditioning had defeated their insidious intent immediately, but now they seemed to be throbbing like veins — and the sting of her tears nearly doubled her over. She hunched down, clutching her stomach, and in the instant that she knew what this must look like to the others, she saw Del Olmo's head snap up, and she knew they had come in to rescue her.\n\nShe spun on her heels, still crouched, and held out a hand. \"No!\" she hissed. \"I'm fine! I'm fine.\"\n\nHarry, Del, and Udo were standing in the breach. Udo had one hand in her reagents pouch. Del had the gun fixed on Del Olmo. Harry, bless him, was wielding Alis' pistol as if he knew how to use it.\n\n\"Brother,\" Del Olmo rasped. \"Brother, brother… and do I see you back there, too, brothers?\"\nMcInnis appeared behind his subordinates. He nodded without obvious import.\n\nDel Olmo laughed. \"Your cowardliness is in retreat.\" Wettle was almost certainly fleeing back up the tunnel, after Sokolsky. \"Can't stand to see what we've become. I understand.\" And then, he was weeping again. \"Oh, I //understand.//\"\n\nLillian heard the internal rotors on the gun spinning up. Her left hand was still in her pocket. She raised her right hand, both to warn Del and plead with Del Olmo. \"Bernie. Come back up with us. We can still fix this.\"\n\nHe laughed again, harsher this time but no less manic. \"Fix this? FIX this?! It was never anything but broken. All these people were only ever BROKEN. Broken is their NATURAL STATE!\" He reached up and tore at his hair, and some of it came out. \"They're //useless,// brother. Useless. Useless. USELESS.\"\n\n\"Ber—\"\n\n\"USELESS!\" Del Olmo screamed. \"All FUCKING USELESS! I took off their blinders, I showed them the light, and what do they do? Nothing. NOTHING! Sex and drugs and rock n' roll, statues of Gary fucking Busey that bring a tear to your eye. Fucking fucking //trash!//\" He tried to throw his coat off, but the sleeves caught, and he stalked around the edge of the shaft with it hanging around his waist like a ridiculous half-cape.\n\n\"Bernie…\" Lillian pleaded.\n\n\"It's over, brother.\" Del Olmo was breathing fast and heavy, flapping his arms uselessly, beard shiny with fresh spittle and eyes wild with rage and hurt. \"It's over, and there's worse to come after.\"\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/53-those-who-cant/DL_53_12_Del_Olmo_Mad.jpg]]\n\n\"I'm not your brother, Bernie.\" Lillian took her hand out of her pocket, and opened the envelope she was holding with her other hand. Her coat slipped off to the floor. \"I'm not your brother. This is who I am. You said I could show you when the time was right.\" She held it up; the pen sketch looked like a red smear through her shining eyes, but she hoped he could see it. She needed him to see it. \"You said I'd //know// when the time was right. Please look. And then //let me help you.//\"\n\n\"I'm not your fucking //Bernie,//\" he snarled, \"and you can't even help yourselves. This is what you do with boundless creativity? I paint the world with inspiration, and you spit in my //fucking// face! You don't deserve those incredible machines inside your heads.\" He slammed his index finger into his skull until the bones audibly //snap//ped, and he didn't even seem to notice. \"The gears could sing, but instead they sound like a dot-matrix printer haemorrhaging out a black-and-white photo of Paris Hilton on fucking //cardboard!//\" He was close enough now that she could feel the spit landing on her scalp.\n\n\"Please,\" she almost wept, hand still outstretched. \"Please //look at me.//\"\n\nHe looked at the sketch. He shook his head. He shook his head again, harder. There was nothing in his eyes that looked like him. \"Crude. Inartistic. //Amateurish.//\" He walked over to her — she heard the gun whine — and swatted the paper from her hand with a rough flourish of his coat. She caught a glimpse of something sudden and impossible inside the lining…\n\n[[=image https://scp-sandbox-3.wdfiles.com/local--files/53-those-who-cant/DL_53_13_Lillian_Bowled.jpg]]\n\n…and he was gone.\n\n\"FUCK!\" Del screamed. \"What the fuck was that?!\"\n\n\"The delay,\" Udo was saying. \"It worked //through// the delay. I can't see anything.\"\n\n\"Some assistance please,\" said McInnis. It sounded like a pained grunt.\n\nThere was more shouting behind her, but Lillian didn't hear any of it. Her ears were ringing from the haemorrhaging of her throat, and a keening like nothing she had ever let loose before in her life.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nThere was no time to mince words, and no time for compassion. \"Get her up,\" Ibanez told Harry, and she shoved him into the shaft. McInnis was on the ground too, but he only looked winded, not wounded. She hefted the gun, and ran down the tunnel.\n\nWhatever Del Olmo had done, her vision had already cleared. She could only hope he hadn't affected her more deeply, in ways she couldn't sense. If he had, well, they were fucked anyway. So she ran, and she ran, and she vaulted over the prone form of William Wettle who lay face-down on the stone, and she heard a sort of //crunch// as she misjudged the distance and put her steel toes on his collarbone, and he screamed in agony, which meant he'd probably fallen down as per usual as opposed to Del Olmo //putting// him down, so that was good, and she ran.\n\nShe couldn't hear it herself through the muffling effect of the SCRAMBLE unit and the pounding in her ears from the sprint, but her display reported footsteps behind her. Keeping pace. That would be McInnis, with a second wind; the Director had always been in immaculate shape, was the Site swimming champion, had access to health technology even the other Sampis did not. She still wasn't sure what good he'd be when they caught up with Del Olmo. All he could do was talk, and talking had already failed.\n\nAs though able to hear her thoughts, he spoke over the SCRAMBLE intercom. \"I may still be able to convince him. I have… certain suspicions… about my faculties. Of speech.\" He didn't sound like he was tiring, but even an athlete needed to take a breath now and then.\n\nShe'd had suspicions of her own, but this was not how she wanted to test them out. She didn't say anything. They'd keep their options open.\n\nBack into H&S. She caught a glimpse of bloody dazzle coat whipping around a corner, and resisted the urge to fire. She could have taken him, and the entire dorm block, out in a single shot, but destroying the facility's superstructure was a bad idea. It was how they'd gotten into this situation in the first place. So she kept running, and McInnis kept up.\n\n\"Wait!\" a tortured voice wailed from farther behind, and she heard the Director's footsteps falter. Ibanez didn't wait. She plunged into the foyer.\n\nThe foyer was chaos. They'd made no effort to move the First Nations out of their cozy corner; it hadn't been the most practical of their several reasons, but the fact that Harry had pointed out the uncomfortable historical parallels had been one of the most convincing. The mythological creatures were flitting here and there, not obviously under any sort of compulsion effect but merely reacting to the sudden frenzy of activity from their human counterparts. The room was in an uproar, the people were howling and clawing at their eyes, the fires were scattered and ash and sparks filled the air. The ceiling tiles were ablaze. She kept running.\n\n\"He tried to take… the elevator,\" McInnis said in her ear. She still couldn't hear his footsteps, nor see them reported on the screen, but then she was leaving rather a lot of activity behind her right now.\n\n\"Must've been down there… a long time,\" she agreed. An animal screech reverberated down the empty elevator shaft as if in response, and the floor briefly shook. \"Only… one way out… now.\"\n\nThe nearest subway station was the connector between Health and Pathology, Psychology and Parapsychology, and the dorms. It fed into the central terminal that had once linked up with AAF-D, and the Blue Line that led to the lake. Her SCRAMBLE unit flashed a whole panoply of warnings as she vaulted the turnstile, and she closed her eyes until the beeping ceased. When it did, and she reopened them, she was almost to the train. The doors were open. There were voices shouting behind her. The walls were painted with photorealistic depictions of the staff of Site-43, living and dead, and even through the filters she could feel their eyes turning to watch her as she ran. The train was cerulean blue, soothing and unbroken by detail. She felt her legs giving out. She was stalling. Something… was…\n\nShe pushed through it. She leapt, she slid, she made it through the doors. She threw herself up the nearest pole, and hammered the button that would hold the doors for the others. Not because she needed them. Because she didn't want them left behind as the Site destroyed itself in Del Olmo's wake.\n\nShe took a moment to catch her breath, and there was a clattering of feet. Then the doors swished shut, and she knew her target had made it into the engine. She took a deep breath—\n\nLillian crouched down in front of her, face streaked and soaked. \"He's mine,\" she said. \"It still has to be me.\"\n\nIbanez pressed forward and kissed her, on the lips. When she drew back, the other woman's blue eyes shining with fluorescent light reminded her of the old Windows 95 error screen. \"It's not all about you. Remember?\"\n\nShe left Lillian still crouched on the floor, shell shocked, and saw that McInnis, Sokolsky, and Udo had made it onto the train. \"Harry?\" she rasped, only now realizing that her lungs were practically on fire from the long haul.\n\n\"Missed the doors,\" Lillian muttered. \"Out of shape.\"\n\n\"Caught the caboose, though.\" Harry staggered from the back of the train, wheezing. \"Is that… what it's called?\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt wasn't a long ride, but it felt like one.\n\nThe math was pretty simple. They all needed time to get their strength back, and Del Olmo had almost certainly left traps for them down the length of the train. All the doors would open at once, and there was nothing he could do to stop that, so everything would be equal when they arrived at the station. So, they waited.\n\n\"Good thing the windows are painted over,\" Harry said. \"I'm sure there's awful shit on the tunnel walls, too.\"\n\nLillian grunted.\n\n\"It'll take a long time to clear,\" Udo agreed. \"But we've got the best experts in the world.\"\n\nLillian grunted again.\n\n\"I'm confident we'll be able to cure the rem—\" McInnis began.\n\n\"Would you all shut the fuck up?\" Lillian shouted.\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nHe was already gone when Del sprang from the train. It wasn't difficult to see why, though she of course didn't, since she'd already sprinted far ahead. Lillian staggered out almost drunkenly, heart still pounding, and saw that Del Olmo had actually not spent most of the ride preparing nasty surprises for anyone who came looking for him, but instead simply smashing the engine's right-hand window and clearing the glass so he could escape before the train had stopped. There was blood on the floor in a nasty smear, like someone had dropped and rolled, and streaks leading off to the turnstiles. This time Del slid under instead of going over, using the blood to grease her way, and she was at the far door before the rest of them reached the checkpoint.\n\nHarry was beside her. \"You don't need to be there.\"\n\nShe took his hand, and as they passed through the stile, pulled him into a run. \"Allan and Harry at Grand Cove.\"\n\n[[=]]\n@@ @@\n[[image http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-b-b-decommission/Asterisk43.png]]\n@@ @@\n[[/=]]\n\nIt was a dense reference, equal parts //Star Trek: The Next Generation// and the vigil in his car as they had waited for Scout to pass, but he got it immediately, as she'd known he would. He squeezed her hand, and nodded.\n\nShe'd put her SCRAMBLE unit back on, which was good. AAF-A's lower levels were filled with fractals that read, according to the filters, like an early draft of the masterpiece Del Olmo had been assembling in the geothermal shaft. \"This was all him,\" said Lillian. Her voice was very tired. \"He did all of this.\"\n\n\"Reynders,\" said Udo. \"I wonder what—\"\n\nThere was a scream from ahead, and suddenly Udo was in front of them. She was short, but her legs were long enough to do the job with the sudden burst of energy, and she made it around the next corner before the others. She was already kneeling beside Del, who was sprawled on the floor and thrashing and screaming, when Harry's SCRAMBLE set reported the contents of the latest set of murals.\n\nA tree-lined landscape on fire, an army of female dwarfs mowing down a fleeing crowd of duplicates of Ana Mukami. The sigil of the Chaos Insurgency was everywhere. The floor was a turbulent pool of red water.\n\n\"Zevala in abstract,\" McInnis noted.\n\nDel's helmet was off. She must have been ambushed at the corner.\n\n\"Stay with her.\" Lillian pushed past Udo, and tried to shake Harry's hand off.

Or maybe it was just mist, and the apparitions were actually there. They heard weeping and cursing as they reached the ground floor, where a portrait gallery of obscene proportions stretched from junction to junction to junction, none of it apparently anomalous. Del Olmo's lab, or teaching hospital, perhaps. As they rounded the final bend one of the portraits seemed to leap off the wall and attack them, but it was only that the fleeing memeticist had tore it off the wall and flung it as one final inelegant obstacle before the foyer, and the front door.\n\nThey didn't even see what there was in the foyer.
