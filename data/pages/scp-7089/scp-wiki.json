  name=SCP-7089SelfStorageExternal.png|\n    caption=The exterior of Provisional Outpost-7089 on 18th June 2028.|\n    align=center|    \n    width=650px|\n]]\n\n**SPECIAL CONTAINMENT PROCEDURES:**\nPer protocol, Provisional Outpost-7089 is to be maintained by agents as an operational self-storage facility in order to mask on-site Foundation activities. The wing containing SCP-7089 is to remain closed to civilian clients under the cover of \"long term refurbishment\". As all non-anomalous storage units have been removed from the wing, the resultant space is to serve as an operations and living complex for on-site personnel.\n\nSCP-7089's exterior is to be monitored via closed circuit camera surveillance in case of unauthorised civilian access. SCP-7089-1 is to be assigned a rotating guard detail at all times to accompany any research expedition and provide an immediate response to any alteration to the interior space.\n\nAny proposed test involving SCP-7089 must be signed off on by the research lead, Dr. Frederick Munroe, then approved by Site-44 Director Carter before any action is taken.\n\n**DESCRIPTION:**\nSCP-7089 is a personal storage unit (number 7089) with an external footprint of 25 square feet, built into the ████ ████ Self Storage facility - hereafter referred to as Provisional Outpost-7089 - in ████████, Yorkshire, England. The interior of SCP-7089 exhibits an acute spatial anomaly wherein its size is many times larger than the exterior. Educated estimates place its size at roughly 140 square miles. As the interior layout changes regularly and does not correspond to linear spatial limitations, this value is subject to ongoing reassessment.\n\nThe interior of SCP-7089 - hereafter referred to as SCP-7089-1 - contains a storage facility of similar design to the external complex, though a lack of additional decoration and presence of reinforced internal structure and cutting edge [REDACTED] indicate its purpose for either private or military usage, rather than civilian.\n\n------\n\n**RECOVERY LOG 7089:**\nSCP-7089 came to Foundation attention on 14th May 2028, following the filing of five (5) missing persons reports in connection with staff and clients of what would become Provisional Outpost-7089, then a privately owned self storage facility. Shortly after this, assets based out of Site-44 bought the facility via a shell company and dispatched first response MTF Psi-42 (\"Misfits\") to investigate.\n\nFollowing contact with SCP-7089 and confirmation of its spatial anomaly, Psi-42 received clearance to enter SCP-7089-1 for the purpose of recon.\n\n[[div class=\"alert_interviewvideo\"]]\n//**Log No.** Psi-42/7089//\n//**Date/Time:** 15th May 2028 - 1325 Local Time//\n\n//**Involved Agents:**//\n//Sarah \"Tyke\" Tucker// (2IC, MTF Psi-42)\n//Otto \"Omen\" Thornton//\n//Harvey \"Wiz\" Kilner//\n//Louise \"Noble\" Phelps//\n\n//**Further Information:** Agents on-site were monitored from a surveillance van outside the structure, and from Site-44 by Psi-42 Commander Haley \"Hammer\" Wilson, who had been unable to lead the operation due to routine medical exams. Agent Wilson requested a line of communication be kept open.//\n\n------\n\n//[Transcript begins.]//\n\n//Psi-42 have been inside SCP-7089-1 for ten (10) minutes. Agent Omen's body camera turns a corner to a hall of storage units similar to previous halls.//\n\n**Omen:** Geez, this place goes on forever. You reckon we're past the city limits, yet?\n\n**Tyke:** Eyes forward, Omen.\n\n**Omen:** Right, right...\n\n//Two (2) seconds of silence.//\n\n**Tyke:** ...And no, not //quite// yet.\n\n//Light chuckling can be heard between agents.

I'm being told it's //spooky// how well we can make you out.\n\n**Wiz:** What's the catch?\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** None yet, but that means jack shit.\n\n**Omen:** Wanna bet something's using the great reception to lure hapless shits in?\n\n**Noble:** If it's another slimey, tentacled rat-bastard I swear to God...\n\n**Tyke:** I'm gonna try my luck on that. \n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Noted. Keep your eyes open.\n\n**Tyke:** Roger, ma'am.\n\n//Agents proceed further into SCP-7089-1. This transcript omits six (6) minutes of footage for brevity, during which time nothing of note is recorded.//\n\n**Noble:** Shit...\n\n**Tyke:** Do I wanna know?\n\n//Agent Noble's body camera is facing a storage unit. The number above its door reads 2743.//\n\n**Noble:** I've seen that number before.\n\n//Two (2) seconds of silence. Agent Tyke can be heard humming.//\n\n**Tyke:** Come again, Noble? Where?\n\n**Noble:** There! I mean, uh...\n\n**Wiz:** ...Don't tell me, you saw it earlier?\n\n**Noble:** Just after we came in, above the same door.\n\n//Agent Noble turns. Their body camera shows three (3) units reading 7383, 134 and 1332.//\n\n**Noble:** Those ones, too.\n\n**Omen:** Wish my memory was that good...\n\n**Wiz:** No pattern to them to notice. Weren't we going straight?\n\n//Muttering can be heard between agents.//\n\n**Tyke:** ...Crap. Hammer? We're being looped around! Probably some sort of closed space.\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Knew it was too good to be true. Noble said she saw this place just after you came in. Can you see the exit from here?\n\n**Wiz:** I see it, ma'am.\n\n//Agent Wiz's body camera shows the open unit door the agents entered through approximately 45 meters away. The hall of the non-anomalous self-storage facility is visible beyond it.//\n\n**Tyke:** Not trapped, then, unless this place is playing for giggles.\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Never know what's gonna happen with a non-linear like this.\n\n**Tyke:** Ma'am?\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Pull out, Tyke. We can come back with proper mapping tech and save a //load// of hassle.\n\n**Tyke:** Roger. Alright, folks, let's get gone. No sense getting lost when we're so close... to... Wait.\n\n//Agent Tyke trails off. Both her body camera and others' record her staring wide-eyed at a storage unit.//\n\n**Tyke:** What... What the //fuck?!//\n\n**Omen:** Tyke? You good?\n\n**Tyke:** ...Yeah, I... It caught me off guard.\n\n//Agent Tyke can be seen glancing at the other agents.//\n\n**Tyke:** Please tell me you're all seeing this?\n\n//Agents Omen, Wiz and Noble turn toward the storage unit.//\n\n**Wiz:** Not sure what I'm looking for, boss.\n\n**Tyke:** The number above the door, Wiz.\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I can't make it out from here, Tyke. What's--\n\n//Agent Hammer is cut off by Agent Noble.//\n\n**Noble:** Oh. Oh! That's, uh...\n\n**Wiz:** More than a little invasive, yeah? But since when have these things ever cared for boundaries?\n\n**Omen:** Too much to hope it's just a shitty coincidence, right?\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Tyke, either get the heck out of there or get closer! I can't see what you're looking at.\n\n//Agent Tyke moves closer to the unit. The numbers above it come into focus, reading 060699. Agent Hammer can be heard cursing (specifics unintelligible).//\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** ...Ah.\n\n**Tyke:** That's my fucking //birthday//, ma'am.\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I'm well aware. Non-Euclidean //and// telepathic. Command's gonna //love// this...\n\n**Tyke:** We still pulling out?\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** I'd say yes, but given the implied intelligence I think the researchers will to want a threat assessment before they go poking about in there.\n\n**Tyke:** Not exactly ideal.\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** When is it ever?\n\n**Tyke:** Alright, alright... Noble, Wiz. Either side of the door. If it's angry or has teeth, fill it with lead.\n\n//Agents Noble and Wiz can be seen to nod, moving to flanking positions on either side of Unit 060699.//\n\n**Tyke:** Omen, with me.\n\n**Omen:** Of course we're opening the damn thing. It's only asked for you //personally//, at this point...\n\n**Tyke:** Better us than another poor sod, right?\n\n//Agent Tyke moves to the unit door, grasping the handle. Post-mission audio analysis registers the sound of a lock turning. Agents Omen, Noble and Wiz can be seen raising their firearms to ready positions.//\n\n**Tyke:** You got my back?\n\n**Omen:** Always.\n\n//Agent Tyke can be heard taking a breath and counting back from five (5) seconds before pushing the unit door upwards. She takes six (6) steps backwards as it opens, raising her firearm. All body cameras take a moment to adjust to the limited light levels inside of the unit. Agent Noble can be heard gasping.//\n\n**Noble:** ...Shit.\n\n//Agent Tyke lowers her weapon.//\n\n**Tyke:** Keep on alert, but... Maybe try not to look so threatening?\n\n**Hammer //(via radio)//:** Tyke, report! What is it?\n\n**Tyke:** Not what, ma'am. //Who//.\n\n//Agent Wiz's body camera adjusts to the lack of light. A pile of three (3) unmarked cardboard boxes are visible. Five (5) human figures are huddled together next to them.//\n\n**Omen:** ...People.\n\n//[Transcript ends.]//\n\n------\n\n//**Mission Debriefing**: On recovery, the individuals inside Unit 060699 were identified as accounting for all staff and client disappearances. After a full medical check-up, all were determined to be in perfect health with no lasting issues barring minor disorientation. As they lacked clear memories of the time between disappearance and recovery, minor Class B amnestics were administered.//\n\n//The boxes recovered contained photographs identified by Agent Tucker as being from a family collection of her grandmother's.[[footnote]] Per her account, presumed lost in a house fire in 2023. [[/footnote]] The photographs appeared to lack anomalous properties. An appeal by Agent Hammer to release them to Agent Tucker --is pending approval-- has been denied.//\n[[/div]]\n\nFollowing Psi-42's expedition, a long-term research group was assigned to Provisional Outpost-7089 to investigate SCP-7089-1. Psi-42 would remain on-site as support.\n\nIt was observed at this time that the unit number above the exterior door of SCP-7089 matched the number automatically assigned to it by the Foundation database. No evidence of tampering was detected.\n\n[[div class=\"alert_bulletin\"]]\n//**Date:** 19th May 2028//\n\n//**Sender:** Haley \"Hammer\" Wilson// (Commander, MTF Psi-42)\n//**Recipient:** Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)\n\n//**Clearance:** Level 2//\n\n------\n\nI'd like it on record that if this box //is// precognitive also, it probably knew we were going to find it.

When the first of these tests (see //#7089.5//) proved that SCP-7089 - while capable of being direct - was prone to responding with symbolism or recovered objects, the nature of questions shifted further to accommodate this.\n\nAn additional line of testing would be carried out in parallel by Researcher Townes on Dr. Munroe's approval. These tests were intended to determine whether objects recovered by SCP-7089 were created for purpose or relocated from elsewhere.\n\n||~ Test No. ||~ Date ||~ Test Details ||~ Result ||\n|| #7089.5 || 31/05/2028 || Dr. Munroe, accompanied by Agent Hammer, enters SCP-7089 while imagining a question, 'How big are you?'. || Unit 140 encountered.

SCP-1230 recovered and returned to Site-12. 1230 vanished from its off-site storage location the moment Townes entered SCP-7089. ||\n\nAfter Test //#7089.12//, experimentation would again be put on hold as Dr. Munroe - responsible for devising test parameters for SCP-7089 - was called to Site-44 for a quarterly review of his research. The review was without issue and testing was scheduled to resume upon his return to Provisional Outpost-7089 on 15th June 2028.\n\nPrior to this, the below described containment breach attempt would occur at Site-44.\n\n[[div class=\"alert_incident\"]]\n//**Incident Log No.**  ████/140528//\n//**Date:**  13th June 2028//\n\n//**Involved SCP(s):** SCP-████//\n//**Key Personnel:**//\n//Site-44 Defence Force// (FSDF-44)\n//Florence Wing// (Asst. Director of Containment, Site-44)\n//Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)\n\n------\n\n**Incident Summary:**\nAt 1454 local time, SCP-████ would attempt to breach containment at Site-44 by exploiting an undetected weakness in its containment chamber. Though significant damage was inflicted to the chamber - necessitating extensive repairs and SCP-████'s temporary relocation - a rapid response by the Site-44 Defence Force was successful in recontaining the entity with minimal injuries and zero (0) casualties among personnel.\n\n**Post-Incident Analysis:**\nThe neutralisation of SCP-████'s breach was enabled by material recovered in tests performed with SCP-7089 by Dr. Frederick Munroe. During Munroe's quarterly research review, Site-44 Asst. Director of Containment Florence Wing recognized elements in photographs recovered in Test //#7089.10// pertaining to [REDACTED], allowing for an accurate prediction of when SCP-████ would attempt to breach containment.\n\nThis allowed a response force to be prepared twelve (12) hours before the attempt was made.\n[[/div]]\n\nDue to the importance of SCP-7089 in detecting a potential containment breach, its Disruption Class would be upgraded from Dark to Vlam as a precaution. Dr. Munroe would return to Provisional Outpost-7089 one (1) day early on 14th June 2028 on the grounds that testing to determine the motives and limitations of SCP-7089 was vital to its containment.\n\n[[div class=\"alert_bulletin\"]]\n//**Date:** 15th June 2028//\n\n//**Sender:** Florence Wing// (Asst. Director of Containment, Site-44)\n//**Recipient:** Dr. Frederick Munroe// (Research Lead, PO-7089)\n\n//**Clearance:** Level 3//\n\n------\n\nDirector Carter has recommended to the O5 Council that we proceed with further testing on SCP-7089 immediately, and so far there's been no stated objections. Given we can now be certain it is - as a baseline - self-aware, precognitive and unable to remove objects from inside Foundation sites, determining further what we can glean from it and what its intentions are //must// be a priority from here onward.\n\nWe //need// to know whether this box is actually trying to ingratiate itself or whether it just wants our guard down. That first kidnapping to get our attention aside, it's done nothing even remotely hostile, and going by your reports on those keepsakes and intel, it's actively attempting to make us //like// it, the unhelpfulness of its unwillingness to communicate in //words// aside.\n\nPut simply, you have a blank cheque for whatever you need on this one provided you run it by Carter first, though he's probably going to want to write up a few questions of his own.\n\nYou have our ear on this, Fred. Don't waste it.\n[[/div]]\n\n ###ffffff00|.##\n\n**EXPERIMENT LOG 7089-C:**\nFollowing extended planning, testing with SCP-7089 resumed on 17th June 2028, two (2) days later than originally scheduled. Tests would first consist of a series of questions intended to improve intel regarding SCP-7089, or regarding how SCP-7089 would view itself. After this, the previous lines of research would continue, with a view to understanding what SCP-7089 was and was not capable of.\n\n||~ Test No. ||~ Date ||~ Test Details ||~ Result ||\n|| #7089.13 || 17/05/2028 || Dr. Munroe, accompanied by Researcher Townes and Agent Omen, enters SCP-7089 while imagining a question, 'What is your purpose?'. || Unit 19216 encountered again.

It //wants// us to like it, between the shows of good faith, not stealing shit from inside secure facilities - if it even //can// - and //other// matters.\n\nYou know my family history, Wing. What we lost in service. You //know// what that photograph means to me.\n\nWhat I have doubts of is //why// it feels the need to ingratiate itself if it knows we don't care. //Why// it needed our attention in the first place when it could have just as well skirted under the radar. It's //sapient//, can see the future, pull matter from anywhere - even the //future//, apparently - like it's nothing, store pretty much anything securely within it and seems to have a mentality designed to be cryptic but fundamentally //comprehensible//.\n\nAfter the picture of the safe, I'd almost say it wants [REDACTED].\n[[/div]]\n\nTesting with SCP-7089 would once again be suspended per Agent Wilson's recommendation, pending another full review of its motives. On 30th June 2028, the O5 Council would convene for a routine meeting, among which SCP-7089 was one (1) subject among a number discussed.\n\n[[div class=\"alert_o5\"]]\n= **The following extract has been declassified for personnel of Level 3 or higher.**\n\n//**Log No.** O5-██████-███/300628//\n//**Date/Time:** 30th June 2028 - ████ Local Time//\n\n//**Involved:**//\n//Overseer Council// (SCP-O5)\n\n//**Further Information:** [REDACTED]//\n\n------\n\n//[Transcript begins.]//\n\n**O5-2:** Next order of business.

Another life even at that point, with all the shit the spooks pumped us full of to keep our hearts going. You wouldn't believe by looking at me that I'm past ninety.\n\nI went back, you know, after I put the pieces together. Took a jeep and went cross country, told the Director it was recon. Still don't know how I managed to sell that, with how messed up the world was starting to get.\n\nBut it wouldn't have mattered: Entire city was ash by then, along with most of the county.

Still won't, really.\n\n//The shuffling of papers can be heard again.//\n\n**Hammer:** I think you're still out there, sometimes. Comms are patchy, so I wouldn't even know if you were in the next town over, but you knew what was coming better than most of us. If anyone's gonna weather this shitstorm, it'd be you. Not like there's anybody else left I haven't already got a bead on. Not Omen, not Noble... //Definitely// not Wiz...\n\nThere's... not many of us here at 44, now. A lot of the effort this side of Europe's moved out to 54. They need most of the remaining personnel - few of us that there are now - to keep the lights on.

Don't ask me how it works, you'll have more than enough time to study the thing. They just wanted me to oversee the project, but it's been ready on our end for a long time, now, and we're almost out of time to send it back.\n\nBecause the world is //well// past the brink.

The box was meant to be a safety measure, to make the war easier on containment, but I don't think that was //ever// what it was actually intended for.\n\nNot that it matters either way. With everything spiralling, now, it's only a matter of time before something gives and I have to write a risk assessment for a //Tenth// Occult War that no-one will ever read. \n\n//Five (5) seconds of silence.//\n\n**Hammer:** Do you think they //knew//, Fred? That it'd get this bad? The O5, I mean. They'll be hearing this, too, so they //had// to, right?\n\n//Agent Hammer can be heard breathing deeply.//\n\n**Hammer:** Or did you already know, Two? Made your plans based on some inevitability. Maybe you thought you could avoid it, or outlast it. Even now that's above my paygrade, not like I'll ever know, and it wouldn't affect my loyalties either way. The Foundation runs too deep in my blood - in my //family// - for that. But... make this worth it, alright? Find a way through the madness.\n\nIf you're still out there, fix this. Make it right, I'm //begging// you.\n\n//A light thudding sound can be heard, followed by Agent Hammer sobbing.//\n\n**Hammer:** Because otherwise all this was for naught, pointlessly prolonging a world that's godless and hollow.\n\nLeft to fend off the rats for scraps.\n\n//[Transcript ends.]//\n[[/div]]\n###ffffff00|.##\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n ###ffffff00|.\n.##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7088]]] | SCP-7089 | [[[SCP-7090]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n[[<]]\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-7089SelfStorageExternal.png\n> **Name:** Lane Cotton Mill Self Storage, Uptown New Orleans 1 June 2022 - 06\n> **Author:** Infrogmation of New Orleans\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en CC BY-SA 4.0] (Minor alterations made to colour of image.)\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lane_Cotton_Mill_Self_Storage,_Uptown_New_Orleans_1_June_2022_-_06.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-7089SelfStorageApple.png\n> **Name:** Wild Twist apple cultivar\n> **Author:** Relspas\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en CC BY-SA 4.0]\n> **Source:** [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Wild_Twist_apple_cultivar.jpg Wikimedia Commons]\n\n----\n\n> **Filename:** SCP-7089SelfStorageDoc.png\n> **Name:** SCP Documentation - Department of Occult Warfare\n> **Author:** [[*user Wixelt]] (Makes use of SCP Foundation Logo.)\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en CC BY-SA 4.0]\n\n> **Name:** SCP Foundation Logo\n> **Author:** Far2\n> **License:** [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en CC BY-SA 3.0]\n\n----\n[[/<]]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
