P. Crow\n\n**Project Aims:** To recommission, further upgrade, and utilize SCP-244-ARC for the purpose of allowing Professor K. P. Crow to remain beneficial to the Foundation indefinitely.\n\n**SCP Utilised:**\nSCP-244-ARC - as the base construct\nSCP-447 - as a raw material\nSCP-500 - as a raw material\nSCP-914 - for the altering of raw materials\nSCP-890 - for altering of materials and the finished product\n\n**Raw Materials:**\n\n* One pill of SCP-500.\n* Five hundred liters of slime produced by SCP-447 as a biological preservative, disinfectant, and lubricant.\n* One heart-lung machine.\n* One dialysis machine.\n* 250 kg of bulletproof glass.\n* [[[new-buteo-series-mechanical-exoskeleton|One Anderson Robotics Neural Adapter]]]\n**Refining and Altering Procedures:**\n\nHeart-lung machine, dialysis machine, and bulletproof glass to be refined using SCP-914. The installation of these devices will allow for respiration and prevent cerebral/respiratory atrophy. \n\nSCP-890 to assist with further shaping the resultant machine to integrate with SCP-244-ARC chassis. This will be necessary in order to contain the slime produced by SCP-447. Though the slime does not pose a threat in the advent of ΩK, its preservative properties will reduce the physical deterioration of the body and prevent the onset of further musculoskeletal pain. \n\nThe Anderson Robotics Neural Adapter will function as the control system of the refurbished SCP-244-ARC.  A highly skilled neurosurgeon trained in the attachment of cerebral neuroreceptors to appropriate technologies will be required as well.\n\n**Additional Changes of Note:**\n\n* Removal of previously installed weaponry - //no longer necessary//\n* Removal of emergency self-destruct system - //no longer necessary//\n* Removal of manual control system - //no longer necessary//\n* Removal of aerodynamic propulsion system - //no longer necessary//\n* Installation of four accessibility limbs - //to assist with productivity//\n* Installation of a gyroscopic camera with occipital support - //to facilitate vision//\n\n\n**Notes:**\n\nProject Proposal approved. - //March 19th, 2022//\nRefurbishing of SCP-244-ARC complete. - //September 21st, 2023//\nTest Trials Begin- //January 24th, 2024//\nTest Trials Conclude - //October 20th, 2024//\nSurgery Scheduled for March 1st, 2025- //February 19th, 2025//\nSurgery Delayed, requested by Professor Crow- //February 28th, 2025//\nSurgery Scheduled for June 12th, 2025- //March 18th, 2025//\nSurgery Delayed, requested by Professor Crow- //June 11th, 2025//\nSurgery Scheduled for July 30th, 2025- //July 12th, 2025//\nProfessor Crow was connected to the device on  July 30th, 2025. - //August 1st, 2025//\nCalibration test passed- //August 15th, 2025//\nMaintenance performed- //October 23rd, 2025//\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n[[div class=\"pseudo-tags\"]]\n* acoustic \n* archived \n* ectoentropic \n* electronic \n* mechanical \n* metallic \n* scp\n* kain-pathos-crow\n* project-proposal\n* ΩK\n[[/div]]\n[[>]]\n@@                         @@ [[size 75%]]page revision: 83, last edited: 28 Oct 2026, 23:32 (5 days ago)[[/size]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[size 0%]].[[/size]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"outside\"]]\nHe stopped, the muscles in his right cheek twitching in annoyance.
