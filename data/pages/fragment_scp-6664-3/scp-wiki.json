SCP-6664 is not to be climbed, for fear of damaging its branches.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6664 is a tree of the species //##blue|Prunus spinosa##//, more commonly known as the ##blue|blackthorn##, currently located at ##blue|Site-91##. SCP-6664 is identical to other trees of its species, save for its anomalous effects.\n\nSCP-6664's anomalous effects activate whenever ##blue|a human is pricked## by ##blue|its thorns##. When ##blue|a human is pricked by the thorns of## SCP-6664, instead of ##blue|a feeling of discomfort or pain## as expected, ##blue|the individual in question will experience a feeling of intense euphoria, as well as severe auditory hallucinations. These hallucinations have## been designated SCP-6664-1.\n\nSCP-6664-1 ##blue|are auditory hallucinations experienced by individuals under the effects of SCP-6664##. SCP-6664-1 ##blue|consist of voices, usually of individuals close to the subject, praising the subject for their decision to be pricked by SCP-6664. This will happen regardless of if the subject chose to be pricked by SCP-6664 or not.##\n\n-----\n\n[[=]]\n+ **Addendum 6664.01: Discovery**\n[[/=]]\n\nSCP-6664 was discovered on January 28, 2014, after ##blue|Martin Kos##, a ##blue|local salesperson##, reported ##blue|accidentally pricking himself on SCP-6664, and experiencing its effects. Kos reported the incident to his therapist, an embedded Foundation agent, who noted his description of## SCP-6664-1 and reported it as a possible anomaly. SCP-6664 was subsequently moved to ##blue|Site-91##.\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n//This file has been flagged by Site-43 staff as containing incorrect information.
