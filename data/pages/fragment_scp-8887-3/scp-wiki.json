  "content": "**Item #:** SCP-8887\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-8887-1 is to be kept in a standard humanoid containment cell. Each morning, SCP-8887-1 is to be administered 200 milligrams of Modafinil. SCP-8887-1 is to be given freedom to move between it's containment cell, Researcher Gonzalez's office, and other non-restricted site recreational areas.\n\nWhenever SCP-8887-1 enters REM sleep, Foundation Dream Recording technology is used to archive SCP-8887-1's perspective within SCP-8887. All recordings of SCP-8887-1's dreams are to be reviewed by the research team for any deviation from standard behaviors, and archived accordingly.\n\nResearch into medication or anomalous treatments to better nullify the symptoms caused by SCP-8887-1's narcolepsy is ongoing.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8887 is an anomalous pocket dimension, colloquially called 'Dreamspace'. SCP-8887-1 is 26-year-old Aura Roberts, a reality bender, who suffers from narcolepsy. SCP-8887 was created by SCP-8887-1 at some point during its infancy and exists outside of baseline reality. Within SCP-8887, SCP-8887-1 possesses the ability to manipulate the world around it, as well as modify fundamentals about itself, including appearance and physical health.\n\nSCP-8887 can be accessed by individuals who enter the REM phase of sleep, while within 50 meters of SCP-8887-1 while it is also asleep. The likelihood of an individual being able to enter SCP-8887 seems to be regulated by a number of factors; predominantly, emotional syncope with SCP-8887-1 and SCP-8887-1's level of desire for the individual to be present. Further research into the full list of factors is ongoing.\n\n**Addendum-1-Proposal to Update Containment:** On 07/20/2023, a proposal was received from Supervising Researcher Pro Tempore Valentina Gonzalez requesting updated containment facilities.\n\n[[div class=\"email-example\"]]\n[[=]]\n------\n[[<]]\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Foundation Containment Update Proposal Review Committee\n**From:** Supervising Researcher Pro Tempore Valentia Gonzalez\n**Subject:** Proposal for Updated Containment of SCP-8887-1\n[[/div]]\n------\nHi,\n\nIf you've looked back at previous versions of SCP-8887's document, you might be thinking that it seems like we spent an awful lot of time and resources, getting opinions from across the Foundation, with minimal results. What you're reading is not an attempt at containing an anomaly - it was the vanity project of a cruel individual who was willing to harm others in the name of 'science' and 'control'.\n\nLook through the versions. We had no idea what was happening, and we didn't figure anything out by getting more experts. We made progress by talking to the anomaly directly.\n\nSCP-8887-1 is a woman who suffers from Narcolepsy, and as a result, had somehow created SCP-8887 as a defense mechanism. I want to highlight - they are a person affected by an anomaly, no matter how we classify them as part of it. Her name is Aura, and she has been containing this anomaly on her own for **years** before we even discovered it.\n\nWe were out of our depth with SCP-8887. Chan was aimless trying to control it, because there was no way we could understand it as well as Aura. Nobody else is as much of an expert on SCP-8887 as SCP-8887-1.\n\nIt's funny - once Aura came with me and entered containment, suddenly, we knew exactly how to manage it. How to make it predictable. How to influence it without destroying it. I don't think that Dr. Chan was incorrect; his containment procedure of keeping SCP-8887-1 awake would have worked to contain SCP-8887. But so does what we've been doing.\n\nSince the containment of SCP-8887-1, the SCP-8887 research team has noticed that Aura's mental and physical health is directly tied to the stability, safety, and control they exert over SCP-8887. The better her mental health is, the easier containment is for everybody. While the medication we've been administering is only partially effective, with a combination of therapeutic and holistic methods, we have helped better manage SCP-8887-1's physical symptoms. We are, however, lacking when it comes to managing her mental ones.\n\nAs you may know, I have a close bond with SCP-8887-1. Maybe it was that I was the first person she saw in there, maybe it was just that we lived on the same floor in the same apartment building. But despite the initial reasons, it is clear to me as Supervising Researcher Pro Tempore that I have become fundamentally integral to supporting the mental health of SCP-8887-1, and that is a position that I hold with pride.\n\nI propose a modification to the adjoining containment cell, into a standard Foundation dormitory, such that it can be converted into a permanent residence for me to live in. This proximity will allow me to enter SCP-8887 every night. This way, I can keep an eye on both the anomaly and its victim at all times. I truly believe that having somebody that Aura trusts with her at all times within SCP-8887 will not only help her mental health, but also further our understanding of the anomaly, and how to best deal with similar situations in the future.\n\n-Supervising Researcher Pro Tempore Gonzalez\n\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Researcher Gonzalez, Foundation Containment Update Proposal Review Committee\n**From:** Suzanne Barr, Ethics Committee\n**Subject:** Re:Proposal for Updated Containment of SCP-8887-1\n[[/div]]\n------\n\nSupervising Researcher Gonzalez,\n\nIt is my pleasure to represent the Foundation Containment Update Proposal Review Committee and to inform you that we have reviewed your proposal and the attached supporting documentation. After examining the data, you are correct; it seems that your presence would improve the containment of SCP-8887. As such not only have we decided to approve your proposal, but to permanently promote you to the position of Supervising Researcher on SCP-8887.\n\nAs lined out in your document, the adjacent cell will be modified as proposed and should be ready for you to move in within a week. Just make sure your cat doesn't cause a containment breach once he's moved in.\n\n-Suzanne Barr, Ethics Committee Adjudicator\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/<]]\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\nContainment Protocol and other details related to SCP-8887 are currently undergoing updates by Supervising Researcher Gonzalez and her research team. Any requests regarding future research may be sent to her directly.",
