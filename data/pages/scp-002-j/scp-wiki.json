Testing of SCP-002-J is suspended indefinitely.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-002-J refers to individuals of varying age, sex, and ethnicity all suffering from some manner of memory loss.  Up until 20██, SCP-002-J instances were employed by Foundation personnel as tools administered to civilians exposed to anomalies and/or who have gained undue knowledge of Foundation activity as a means of preventing the leak of classified information.\n\nWhen employed properly, SCP-002-J instances between 4 and █,██4 swarm targeted individuals, typically invading individuals' personal space and engaging them in a series of questions to distract and befuddle the person(s) long enough for Foundation personnel to vacate the area.  Questions frequently asked have included \"who are you?\", \"where am I?\", \"are you alive?\", \"this isn't where I parked my car?\", \"where do whores go?\", \"you're not Alan?\", and \"how am I trespassing?\"\n\nWhile proven effective for ██ years, instances of SCP-002-J began to inadvertently reveal information regarding the Foundation to civilians.  In many cases, SCP-002-J instances had gained knowledge of several memetic SCPs and caused █ containment breaches as a result.  \n\nThis event necessitated a mass-recall of all Foundation amnesiacs while a more effective tool was developed.  In the intervening period, personnel were authorized to use Agent-PBR, Agent-1800, and Agent-MD20² to induce memory loss in civilian witnesses.\n\n\nAttempts to discern how SCP-002-J gained knowledge of sensitive Foundation information were largely unsuccessful.
