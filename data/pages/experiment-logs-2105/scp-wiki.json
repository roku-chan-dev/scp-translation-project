Additionally, further research into the other ritual types has been deemed necessary. As such, D-993 has been instructed to choose 5. Projection for this test. Room has also been furnished with a handful of new items for use in rituals. This includes: A dining room chair. A house key. Mid-sized pair of speakers. A box of 48 crayons. A love-seat couch. A standing lamp. _\nAdditional Notes on Subject: D-993 was chosen randomly from a pool of D Class meant for free experimentation. D-993 professes to have been treated poorly during her detainment with The Foundation but suggests the poor treatment came from other D Class personnel. D-993 is an average height, average weight middle aged woman.// ||\n|||||| **Generated Ritual Facsimile: SCP-2105-4** ||\n|||||| {{Ritual created.

[\"We can never be too careful.\" -O5-█] D-2129 and D-990 are familiar with each other, sharing the same domicile while in custody of The Foundation. D-2129 is a tall, muscular man of European descent. Previously administered Class A Amnestics, D-2129 has no memory of his life before acquisition by The Foundation. D-990 is a tall, diminutive man of Colombian descent. He claims to have known D-2129 before their capture. _\nObjects in room remain identical as before.

Lasting approximately 45 minutes, the creature spoke a language unfamiliar to both the subjects and the supervisors. The creature became increasingly more frustrated until it grabbed D-2129 and reverted back into the tendon. D-2129 reverted back with the creature, showing no signs of distress during the reversion.||\n||||||= **Post-Results Supervisor Notes** ||\n|||||| //D-2129 and D-990 were initially extremely reluctant to perform the ritual. While Subjects argued over whether or not to follow orders, objects were gathered for the ritual. Dr. Marberry located a pair of scissors on the floor above the observation room. Eventually, subjects agreed to perform the ritual citing \"fear of known more than the unknown\" as their reasoning. _\n _\nThe ritual itself was significantly more severe than past rituals. The tendon from the bottom of D-2129's foot had to be removed before the ritual. D-2129 was administered local anesthetic before Dr. Marberry surgically removed the tendon. Once removed, the ritual began. Throughout the ritual, anomalous events occurred. _\n _\nThe first step adhered the heels of D-2129 and D-990 together. When the tendon of D-2129 was placed next to D-990's foot, it stretched, wrapping around the circle formed by the subjects' feet. When period key was placed into D-2129's eye, it fused with his existing eye, completely replacing it. During the time that the subjects stared into each other's eyes, the entire room morphed into a room Dr. Marberry recognized as a standard D Class dormitory. The observational window continued to exist, but surveillance video ceased as cameras merged with the walls. _\n _\nSubsequently, D-990 picked up the scissors, moving mechanically and with much purpose. D-990 spoke out-loud: \"Marching through the high of March, I found what I believed to be the cog that turned the world. But I was mistaken. It was not a cog, it was not made of any alloy found in this world. It did not turn the world, it consumed it.\" _\n _\nD-990 then cut the stretched tendon which snapped back into place next to his foot. D-2129 then spoke: \"It was me, I am the miraculous one that calls for you to answer me.\" The mechanical creature then grew from the tendon. A recording of the creature's speech has been submitted for analysis and Dr. Marberry is optimistic of its chances of being translated.// ||\n\n||||||~ **Experiment-2105-α5** ||\n|| **Name:** D-990 || **Date:** ██/██/████ || **Supervisor:** Dr. Forsyth [Clearance Level 3] with assistance by Dr. Marberry ||\n||||||= **SCP-2105 Parameters** ||\n|| **Lethality:** No |||| **Ritual Type:** 3.

Parts formed haphazardly around the object until a figure D-990 recognized as D-2129 was formed. D-990 and D-2129 conversed in the dialect spoken during Experiment-2105-α4, currently still unfamiliar to researchers. D-990 was then converted into parts from a Commodore VIC-20 as well. D-2129 and D-990 then escaped Room 382-C and together attempted to breach Observational Room 382-C. Both subjects were shown to be in much distress until Observational Room 382-C was breached and the subjects terminated both Dr. Forsyth and  Dr. Marberry.

All wounds and lacerations were cleanly cauterized before blood-loss. 500 GB and 750 GB Hard drives were both found to be empty when connected to Room 382-C's computer.// ||\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
