I am Nightcoffee; an on-and-off creator in both chronology and site. I creep for years then show up unbidden, but have since broken into the offsite community. I had a POI self-insert once, but that POI was a POS so away it goes! I've been several other more interesting people since (but we'll get to that soon enough).\n\nI’ve written 4 SCPs, three of which involve Biological Research Area-25. I like keeping my pieces alive with updates and in-universe research as it happens.\n\n__UPDATES DUE__\n//*chemical structure of 1099; easier to describe now that we can achieve it irl with friggin uv lasers or something\n*1289 reacts: Covid\n*The mind of 3042\n*1199: sarkic?//\n>\n> My pieces each embrace a theme that fascinates me.\n> [[[SCP-1099]]]: //Hidden dangers of the natural world//\n> [[[SCP-1199]]]: //chemistry as biology as chemistry//\n> [[[SCP-1289]]]: //Fate, do we choose or are we chosen//\n> [[[SCP-3042]]]: //The cute becomes terrible; too much of a good thing//\n>\n> Hopefully, you’ll find something you get a kick laugh or shudder out of, and I believe there's more to come\n\n[[Collapsible show=\"+I'll confess its a short resume...\" hide=\"...on paper\"]]\n\n[[=image Ascension%20logo]]\n\n> Businessman. Boss. Bastard. Desmond Isaiah Greivs was called many things in his storied time at Marshall, Carter, and Dark. What does a man who has everything truly desire? The one thing he cannot buy: KNOWING. While once only concerned with his wallet, the SCP Foundation provided him what he craved… but at the cost of becoming 05-11. Who are you when everything that matters turns upside down? When you glimpse the face of god and it’s a middle aged grocery stocker, is your Tuesday boat the flex you think it is? Desmond silently seeks  these answers with aplomb, a product of a lifetime of cultivated ego. \n\nASCENSION is a TokTok Cosplay canon featuring O5-11 Desmond Greivs aka “METATRON”. A former Marshall, Carter, and Dark “Customer Privacy Specialist” (MC&D InfoSec), He was recruited to RAISA under Maria Jones. Thanks to his dealings with Dr. Alto Clef on a matter concerning a reality Bender outbreak, Desmond was called to top office as an experimental social face of the O5 among staff. \n\nThe details and events that occur in the Ascension canon may or may not be depicted on the wiki, and may be safely considered an AU, a palisade, or whatever makes you comfortable 😆\n\n[[span style=\"color:gray\"]]{{Reach out to the image and see our irreality…}}[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"color:white\"]]Be warned… death works just fine over here.
