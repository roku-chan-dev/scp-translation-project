This may include information about what you may eat or drink before you arrive, what medications to take, or which anomaly classes to avoid. Make sure to check your information packet for the correct arrival point—traveling with someone else is advised, as SCP-8002’s on-site Way may be confusing for first-time users. Personnel and AiCs will be standing by in the atrium to direct you to your appointment.\n\nFor more information about your visit, please consult the instructions given by your provider. The remainder of this file will follow standard SCP Foundation anomaly documentation guidelines.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8002 is the SCP Foundation’s primary hospital and medical center, a vast subterranean complex incorporating both outpatient clinics and inpatient treatment facilities for up to 150,000 simultaneous patients.\n\nMany of the mechanisms employed in SCP-8002’s operations are either mundane or commonplace among Foundation facilities. Its core anomaly, however, is CLERIC, an anomalous life support system and biological regeneration engine created by the Medical Division. CLERIC emits a variety of electromagnetic energy in the far ultraviolet range known as Cleric Radiation (CR), which provides a variety of benefits to the exposed:\n\n* Faster and more efficient hemostasis\n* Rapid tissue proliferation\n* Reduced incidence of infection\n* Reduced incidence of infectious disease transmission\n* Reduced incidence of cancerous cell growth; fewer cellular transcription errors\n* Reversal of, and recovery from, otherwise-untreatable anomalous conditions\n\nWhen combined with SCP-8002’s industrial-scale quick care systems, CLERIC allows the Foundation to facilitate mass, rapid, and discreet treatment of civilians affected by anomalous events, admitting and treating as many as 12,500 patients per hour. CR is the first-line method of treatment for a large variety of anomalous conditions, and forms a vital part of the organization's operational infrastructure.\n\nFor staff, the Foundation operates SCP-8002 as a healthcare conglomerate under the name Aeonian Health Systems, Inc (AHS). AHS is a core part of job security plans for many Foundation personnel; current estimates predict as many as 86 percent of Foundation staff members will visit SCP-8002 for CLERIC therapy at least once during their careers, as exposure to anomalous harm remains commonplace despite the organization’s efforts to improve containment security.\n\nCLERIC itself is housed deep beneath SCP-8002 in a secure area of the facility. The system is self-maintaining, and access is forbidden. A full description of CLERIC, as well as its design, location, and the suspected reasons behind its gradual failure over the next 18 months, are available later in this document to personnel with Level 4-8002 clearance.\n\n _\n\n[[/<]]\n\n[[image aeonianlogo.png size=\"medium]]\n\n[[<]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:black; background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/8002contestbigslothonmyface/aeonianwingfade.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n\n**PROVIDER PROFILE**\n//Maslov, Andrea.

Six months.\n> \n> **Maslov:** We will fix.\n> \n> //[Maslov consults his chart.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Tried sinus treatments?\n> \n> **Peck:** Yeah, it’s not my sinus.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Obviously not.

Hardly feasible in our line of work. Did you see the one they have now that is like giant samurai in hat which men can ride inside? And here I thought we were in budget crisis. You would think—\n> \n> **Tech:** Doctor.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Ach. Apologies. But you do not want the CR therapy?\n> \n> **Peck:** Well no, it isn’t that.

I’ve heard— I’ve seen some things from other people. Other staff at -19.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Da. There are rumors around it. Natural given the miracle of the thing. Also, Foundation is masterful generator of conspiracies. Half my staff are convinced gumball machine in the atrium is actually the site director. I wish I were inventing this.\n> \n> //[Maslov turns to her tech.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** It is inanimate!\n> \n> **Tech:** I saw it move, doctor.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Pah!\n> \n> **Maslov:** Well... All is to say, if you want to try medical therapy I will not blame you. A drug called oxcarzantine works on your condition somewhat. It will bring a little relief. But I…\n> \n> //[Maslov looks at her hands.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** I want to heal you. To take care of you fully.\n> \n> **Maslov:** And so I suggest CLERIC. I believe it to be safe for you, in small doses, despite these rumors. It is my recommendation.\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Can I show you?\n> \n> **Peck:** Ok.\n> \n> //[Maslov stands. She goes to the wall and retrieves a small, bright orange box on a cord. It has a black button on it. Maslov puts Peck’s hand on the button.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** This switch, lowers shielding around this room. It will expose us to CLERIC and allow its radiation to enter. Just for a moment, ok? We can cut off any time.\n> \n> //[Peck looks at the switch, then at Maslov.]//\n> \n> **Peck:** Just for a moment?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Da, da.\n> \n> //[Peck pushes the switch.]//\n> \n> //[The room is bathed in white light.

The pain is gone!\n> \n> **Maslov:** Yes. Isn’t it something?\n> \n> //[Both Maslov and Peck settle back into chairs, burning.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** This is much like it, you know. What I could do before.\n> \n> //[Maslov closes her eyes.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** It won’t cure us. CLERIC, it does not work on chronic harms, which—sorry to say to you—is what you and I both have. But it holds them at bay. We must simply return and be re-treated.\n> \n> **Maslov:** For now, you would return twice weekly. Should keep you without pain.\n> \n> **Peck:** Twice… Weekly?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Da.\n> \n> //[Peck hesitates for a moment, looking at the fire on Maslov’s side. He licks his lips.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** It’s all right. Will get used to—\n> \n> **Peck:** No.\n> \n> //[Peck pushes the switch. The light and fire fades.]//\n> \n> **Peck:** No, I don’t want that.\n> \n> //[Peck stands, putting on his coat.]//\n> \n> **Peck:** How it felt, I—I don’t want that. What they said about it.\n> \n> **Peck:** I’ve seen them, doctor. I’ve seen how their eyes look. How they sweat, how they breathe. I do not want this.\n> \n> //[Maslov sighs.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** I understand. Still, please allow me to offer you at least some treatment. I will prescribe oxcarzantine. Is an antianomaly seizure medication, a mild drug. Will you try this much?\n> \n> **Peck:** Yes.\n> \n> **Peck:** Thank you, doctor. I—\n> \n> **Peck:** I’m sorry you couldn’t help more.\n> \n> //[Peck leaves.]//\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Ach. Well.\n> \n> //[Maslov turns to her tech.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** His loss, eh?\n> \n> **Tech:** Yes, doctor.\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** How, ah, how long was he to be here for?\n> \n> **Tech:** Until 3:30, ma’am.\n> \n> **Maslov:** 26 more minutes. Da. Well, I’ll be… working here on charts. Return at 3:28, yes?\n> \n> **Tech:** Yes, doctor.\n> \n> //[The tech leaves. Maslov is alone in the room.]//\n> \n> //[She waits for a moment, then picks up the CLERIC exposure switch. In a moment, she is burning again.]//\n\n**Incident 2023-06-23-1**\n\nOn 2023-06-23, a critical  containment breach necessitated mass treatment at SCP-8002. Affected population included 24,019 civillains and 146 Foundation personnel. Per CLERIC access protocol, civilians were prioritized; among staff, urgent personnel were queued behind civilians to be revitalized and returned to field work, while others were waitlisted for Aeonian Health provider availability with 4-6 months.\n\nCivilians were triaged for access and placed into SCP-8002’s Mass Treatment and Amnestic Processor (MTAP). [[footnote]]MTAP, designed in conjunction with the CLERIC system, is a group of mass conveyance elevators with a capacity of 8,900 riders per hour. It subjects passengers to increasingly-concentrated CR as they descend; when all passengers have been normalized, amnestics are dispensed and passengers are returned to the surface. MTAP has saved 970 million lives since its installation in 1988.[[/footnote]] However, while MTAP successfully resolved at least 17,000 cases, the system concluded its descent without fully treating the remainder. Recognizing this, MTAP refused to reset to its starting point, trapping the civilians on board and allowing their infections to worsen for 38 minutes before staff took notice. Anomalously-affected passengers subsequently broke free of their restraints and harmed one another, resulting in ████ casualties and partial contamination of SCP-8002 and the MTAP system.\n\nAnalysis has determined that CLERIC failed to subject passengers to sufficient CR during MTAP’s descent, despite routinely providing sufficient radiation in the past. Testing has since determined that the total CR submersion of SCP-8002 has been dropping sitewide since at least 2019. Containment specialists and armed security personnel have been dispatched to CLERIC’s security chamber in an attempt to reinvigorate the system.\n\n> //Note to site administrators: I’m sure you’ve all seen those estimates prepared by the Financial Office about the huge financial losses that we’d suffer if we lost SCP-8002’s Cleric Radiation. Rest assured that we’re on top of it. Caregivers are being asked to make overtime hours available to meet the demand, and we’re looking into rationing CR access for nonessential staff. This isn’t a popular choice, since it leads to long wait times—so, please let me know if you or your families need care. You can contact me, and we’ll work around the lines.//\n> //- Dir.

I should have known better than to joke with opsec.\n> \n> **Tuck:** All right, all right. It’s just… It’s command. They’re not really adjusting.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Adjusting to?\n> \n> **Tuck:** Well, I think they’re used to having 8002 on hand to stitch us up. Dunk us in their radiation, then right back in the field.\n> \n> **Tuck:** You’ve read a thousand MTF after-action logs. They’re in every file. How many of them actually had a trained medic along?\n> \n> //[Maslov grunts.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Few.\n> \n> **Tuck:** But even now that CLERIC’s on ration… They’re still just throwing us in wherever they want.\n> \n> **Tuck:** Like, ok, here’s an example. On our last trip, we got to the drop point and pretty much immediately, Delta goes down.\n> \n> //[They share a knowing look.]//\n> \n> **Tuck (simultaneously):** It’s always Delta.\n> \n> **Maslov (simultaneously):** It’s always Delta.\n> \n> **Tuck:** We radio command and they say move him outside and leave him and Beta out there, they’ll send a pickup. Delta’s our comms guy, so someone grabs the kit and we keep going forward. We get a good ways in, three hours maybe, and another two more guys go down. Nasty memetic stuff, we have to get them out right then, so we pull back. It’s three hours to the entrance, plus another 90 minutes because we’re carrying these guys who can’t really… use their appendages, I guess is how I’d put it. By the time we get out, it’s been maybe eight, nine hours since we saw Delta and Beta.\n> \n> **Tuck:** Doc, they were still there. Pickup never showed. We found out later command radioed 8002 dispatch rather than the closer site they were supposed to, and dispatch is so overloaded they deferred it and it got lost in the network.\n> \n> **Tuck:** Pretty damn near cost Delta his leg.\n> \n> //[Maslov spits—then hastily wipes it up.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Fuckers.\n> \n> **Tuck:** Yeah, that’s pretty much how we felt.\n> \n> **Tuck:** They approved CR, and it covered their ass, but…\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Tuck:** I wonder if that’s all 8002 has been doing all this time. Covering their ass.\n> \n> **Tuck:** There’s no medics at other sites, no training increase. They’re still //cutting// budget.\n> \n> **Tuck:** And now, without CLERIC, I don’t think they know what to do for us.\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> //[Maslov’s tech knocks.]//\n> \n> **Tech:** Doctor Maslov, two minutes.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Ach. Thank you Maggie.\n> \n> //[The tech leaves.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Four more patients this hour.\n> \n> **Tuck:** But... it’s already 4:30.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Da.\n> \n> //[Maslov stands.]//\n> \n> **Tuck:** Doc, do you think… Will they fix CLERIC? Do they know how?\n> \n> //[Maslov considers him for a while.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** I believe they will.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Is not an excuse for this. Throwing you away. Forever they are tainted by this.\n> \n> **Maslov:** But I believe they will fix it. I believe we can depend on help from them.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Well, no. That is not what I mean. Do not think of it like— depending on them. What I mean is... The Foundation, it is one of the places to look. It is not a bad place to look. But ultimately we are caring for ourselves, finding the resources which we can.\n> \n> **Maslov:** By accepting help, we care for ourselves. Da?\n> \n> **Tuck:** ...Sure, doc. I'll keep that in mind.\n\n**Incident 2023-07-10**\n\nAs CLERIC function has continued to deteriorate, staff care wait times have exceeded one full year. To reduce waits, Aeonian Health has extended its night and weekend hours for non-CLERIC care, and required providers to attend to more patients per floor, leading to environments in which multiple anomalous hazards may be mixed without full staff attention. On 2023-07-10, outpatient clinics in memetics wing sublevel 8d were filled nearly to capacity when a hitherto unrecognized interaction occurred between two different infohazards in adjacent rooms, spreading a hostile memetic and physiological effect throughout the floor. This effect partially degloved victims’ hands and feet, causing distress and leading to a crush for the exits before command ordered sublevel 8d sealed and protective antimemes fired. These antimemes erased the memories of all providers and patients on sublevel 8d (roughly 3,600 people) for the past three weeks. This likely contained the anomaly; however, per protocol 8002-CASK, sublevel 8d will remain sealed until CLERIC can be fully restored.\n\nRestoration of full CLERIC functionality is now an alpha priority Foundation-wide. MTF resources and firefighters have been recruited from other sites, and ballistics engineers are currently awaiting clearance upgrades to Level 4 so they may begin work in the chambers beneath SCP-8002. \n\n> //Note to site administrators: We've gotten repeated asks from care staff to recruit and train more medics while the CLERIC problems continue. These requests are denied. While I understand your concern, our estimates suggest we may revive CLERIC fully within the next few months. Please also do not reduce your activity for fear of injury to personnel—though we do urge you, as always, to keep financial outcomes in mind in this uncertain period. To ensure that CLERIC hours are available to priority administrators and MTF, care staff have been asked to select 16 weeks in the next calendar year for additional overtime hours.\n> - Dir.

Is a hospital, who knows what goes on here!\n> \n> **Nurse:** Um, yes… Ma’am, you’ve got an emergency call from a Mrs. Lam? I know it’s your break, so we asked Gates, but he—\n> \n> **Maslov:** No! Do not send Liz Lam to Gates. I will take her.\n> \n> **Nurse:** Thank you, ma’am. I’ll send her in.\n> \n> //[The nurse leaves. Maslov sighs, rubbing her eyes.

Forgive me for writing while you talk. Have to take my own recordings. My tech Maggie often does, but is away. Her father was one of those trapped in 8d, that floor sealed off by management. Perhaps you heard of it? Questionable choice, highly questionable, but—\n> \n> **Mrs. Lam:** I want CLERIC.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Oh, ach, well—\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** There’s not much available, honey. We have to stop it for now.\n> \n> **Mrs. Lam:** I need it to live. I need it to live.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** Well, we’re going to find another way. You’ll see.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Vivi, do not worry, we prescribe this very carefully in small doses.

She always wants to be back here for the next submersion. She has shaking and sweats, and her communication is getting even worse.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Hmm.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** She never stops asking to come back for more. Just this morning she wouldn’t even look at me, or our daughter, until we told her we’d take her back here and ask.\n> \n> //[Maslov is silent.]//\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** I looked into it in the SCP-8002 records, and it just describes the impacts of increased immersion? There’s no public information on any risks or testing or anything else I’d expect to see, especially in a Foundation file.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Yes. It is assumed to be so-called “anomalous medicine” and typical tests often are not performed.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** So you don’t know if it’s addictive?\n> \n> **Maslov:** The Foundation has been relying upon it for years. It heals many people. But to tell you true… I am not sure.\n> \n> **Mrs. Lam:** I want CLERIC!\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** If you don’t know whether this treatment is harmful—if you don’t even know how it works—how can you keep prescribing it in such high doses to my wife?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Well, I— Well hold a moment. In reality my prescriptions are quite moderate. I follow guidelines for dose reduction. I would not prescribe such if I believed it would do harm.\n> \n> //[Pause.]//\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** Doctor… Oh god, you know, don’t you?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Know?\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** You all know what it’s doing to her. And you keep giving it.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Vivian, my dear. I am a physician. I would under no circumstances bring hurt to—\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** I thought when we switched to a female provider it would finally be different.

Maslov looks coldly back.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** I would never do this. You think I am in a conspiracy? To give more of something I know does harm?\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** ...\n> \n> **Maslov:** The Foundation… Well— pah, they are not perfect. But CLERIC, it is a miracle, an unthinkable thing. A treatment with benefits we are lucky to have.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Addiction? There is simply no—\n> \n> //[Pause. Maslov rubs her side briefly, then drops her hand.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** …I am not prescribing a high dose today, and I will monitor carefully.\n> \n> //[Maslov writes her orders and gives them to Mrs. Xi. Then, she grasps her hands.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Ma’am, I promise you, I am on your side. For now, however, I must get your wife out of pain.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** …Ok. I understand.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** We just… I’m so scared of what this might do to her.\n> \n> **Mrs. Xi:** We need you to do better, Dr. Maslov. All of you.\n\n**Incident Log: 2024-01-17**\n\nThe Foundation has been unsuccessful in restoring CLERIC’s functionality. With SCP-8002's CR immersion at near zero, SCP-█████ broke containment on 2024-01-17 and made its way to downtown █████████, New York, USA. Initial casualties were 13,409, with exposed persons fanning out to the surrounding countryside and creating additional instances. Full casualties to date are unknown. The anomaly remains uncontained.\n\nCLERIC exposure is the only known treatment for victims of SCP-█████. Until CLERIC is restored, site personnel in the US-East region have been placed on lockdown to await further instructions. The Overseer Council has authorized SCP-8002 site staff to use any means available to reinvigorate the CLERIC engine.\n\n[[div style=\"color:black; background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8002/aeonianwingfade.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n\n**Care log**\nPatient: Richards, Oscar\nProvider: Maslov, Andrea\n\nPatient is a 47-year-old male with mundane lower back pain.

Instead, it is emitted by **SCP-8002-1**: a gargantuan biological entity, superficially similar to a flaming bird, around which SCP-8002 is constructed.\n\nFor at least 3,000 years, SCP-8002-1 has lain inert, buried beneath the Earth. Researchers believe the entity is regenerating itself, apparently after suffering a critical injury at an unknown point in the past. As it regenerates, the entity radiates tremendous energy from its body, healing any life near it in addition to itself. This effect has been a boon for the Foundation, leading the organization to construct its main hospital around the entity.\n\nThe energy SCP-8002-1 emits is primarily beneficial, although estimates suggest it forms dependence with repeated exposure. However, given the massive financial and logistical benefits of relying upon it, the Foundation has chosen to accept the risk of dependence. In fact, it █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.\n\nHowever, as of 2023-01-19, SCP-8002-1 is estimated to be nearing the end of its regeneration process. The entity now releases measurably less energy each day, greatly interfering with Foundation medical efforts. Estimates suggest that SCP-8002-1 may fully regenerate as early as 2024-02-12, ceasing CR emission entirely and emerging as a fully-formed deific threat beneath the organization’s largest hospital.\n\nThere is currently no known way to force SCP-8002-1 to produce additional radiation, or reproduce it independently. The Foundation has attempted numerous methods:\n\n* Producing energy at the specific wavelength and eV of 8002-1’s generation (failed; no effect)\n* Producing the energy within the same room as 8002-1 (failed; equipment incinerated)\n* Producing the energy using a generator implanted within 8002-1 (failed; equipment incinerated and entity impervious to damage)\n* Re-injuring 8002-1 to prolong its regeneration period (failed; entity impervious to damage)\n* Continuously re-injuring the entity to produce lasting damage (failed; entity rapidly healed)\n\nWhether a mechanism exists to injure SCP-8002-1, or if this method would indeed result in renewed energy production, is not known. However, one final strategy has been devised by Dr. Harold Sams and SCP-8002 Site Director Anthony Torres, involving recruitment of a key member of SCP-8002's medical staff.\n\n\n> **Maslov:** No.\n> \n> **Sams:** Andrea, please consider—\n> \n> **Maslov:** You do not know where of you talk. Do not hurt things without reason or sense. Nothing comes of this.\n> \n> **Maslov:** When you hurt, you do not know how much hurt you will do or when to stop. Once you begin hurting it is never ending. Soon everything is hurt. You will destroy things you love.\n> \n> **Maslov:** I am a doctor. I do not hurt. Hurt is done to things and I repair. I get them out of pain.\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Torres:** You lost that power, doctor.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Do not insult me.

If you want to help, this is the best way to do it.\n> \n> **Maslov:** I am…\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** I do not think so. Nothing good will come of this. How do you know hurting it worse will do any good? I was hurt badly and lost it all. You want to do the same to it?\n> \n> **Sams:** We want to try. We have nothing else to lose.\n> \n> **Maslov:** That is what you think.\n> \n> //[Silence. Torres and Sams exchange a glance.]//\n> \n> **Sams:** There’s another side to it, too. The bird, the radiation. We know you…\n> \n> **Torres:** You rely, on it. Yourself.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Pah, I am treated occasionally.\n> \n> **Torres:** We’ve seen the cameras, the feeds.

The core of the project is Dr. Andrea Maslov, a former MTF medic and “Type Red” healer who was injured in an anomalous confrontation. Her injury left her unable to utilize her healing abilities; researchers believe afflicting a similar injury on SCP-8002-1 will prevent its natural healing factor from trivializing the wound, forcing it to continue emitting Cleric Radiation in a longer-term attempt to recover. Maslov's tissue will need to be sampled and fashioned into a weapon for the attack to succeed.\n\nDr. Maslov was initially resistant to this proposal. However, as of 2024-02-08, she has agreed to participate.\n\n\n> **[BEGIN LOG]**\n> \n> **2024-02-12, 22:17:** SCP-8002 has been evacuated save for essential staff, security and patients who cannot be moved. Life support and anomalous stabilization is prepared for patients should Cleric Radiation production be altered by Project 8002-Marrow. Radiation detectors across SCP-8002 show that CR generation has fallen to a trickle. The facility is dark on all floors above the core.\n> \n> **22:31:** MTFs Alpha-1 and -2, Beta-2, -4 and -8, and Gamma-4 are in position around the anomaly and building, supported by on-site staff. The payload, a 14-meter tungsten cylinder, hangs near the top of SCP-8002-1’s chamber, suspended from a shielded, jet-black mechanism. It will be dropped, not fired; it cannot be adequately propelled due to its semi-reality and at least one other indescribable, intrinsic quality drawn from the anomaly reproduced from Dr. Maslov’s blood.\n> \n> In the observation room just beyond 8002-1's chamber, Drs. Sams, Torres and Maslov are seated. Maslov is in a wheelchair. The room is protected by successive layers of reinforced glass. All three watch the interior silently.\n> \n> **22:39:** Zero hour. MTF are advised SCP-8002-1 regeneration is imminent. All hands stand by for emergency action.\n> \n> **22:40:01:** Seismographic and Hume sensors fire simultaneously. The chamber is bathed in a burst of white-hot flames. Glass warps and metal bends, but the payload and supporting device hold.\n> \n> **22:40:06:** For the first time in nearly 3,200 years, SCP-8002-1 moves.\n> \n> **22:40:38:** Slowly, the entity stands. It is over 30 feet tall at the shoulder, with a peering, mobile neck examining its surroundings. Its head moves like a marionette’s, constantly stable, not unlike that of a large hen. Its wings are folded at its sides: huge, red-and-gold folds awash in liquid fire.\n> \n> It is otherworldly, bright, and curious, raising its neck to peck at the roof of the tungsten dome, then swinging down to peer inside the observation room.\n> \n> It lets off a squawk, with a sound somewhere between a goose and a car’s horn, amplified louder than a jet engine. Sams and Torres jump.\n> \n> **22:41:01:** MTF command gives the order to drop payload. Antimatter strings retract; the missile is about to fall.\n> \n> **22:41:04:** SCP-8002-1 pauses. As the payload disengages slowly, the entity suddenly looks more closely into the observation chamber. It peers, clearly and intently, at Maslov, cocking its titanic head to one side. Its eyes flicker in the twilight.\n> \n> **22:41:06:** For a fraction of a second, sensors in the observation chamber detect a burst of Cleric Radiation. Exposure exceeds a thousand times the normal dose for SCP-8002 critical care areas, enough to sustain the entire facility for weeks. Maslov gasps and chokes; her entire body is momentarily aflame in white-hot cinders.\n> \n> **22:41:09:** The payload falls. It contacts SCP-8002-1 precisely on its left shoulder. There is a single, blinding flash as the entity’s flames go out.\n> \n> **22:41:10:** The deep, underground room is now pitch black. SCP-8002-1 emits a piercing, resonating cry. It falls to the ground. Around it, the payload delivers its next attack: swirling, black poison which pour over it like molasses, submerging it. This is acroamatic sludge, the random aftergunk of other magic, intended to worsen whatever damage the initial payload was able to cause. The entity rises, jerkily, to its feet, then collapses, then rises again. It jolts to the right, then to the left, trying to shake off the freezing horror which drips thickly from its body.\n> \n> It cries out again, writhing and contorting its head and neck, pecking savagely at the wound on its shoulder. It staggers, slamming into the reinforced tungsten dome, shaking the observation room beyond. Then it raises its wings, beating them against the rounded edge, trying to find a way out. Or, at least, a higher place to perch.

Right now, we don't know of any way to get it back online. I wish I had better news for you. We're working hard to devise an alternative as soon as possible, but for now, it might be wise to hold back your MTF from the field.//\n> \n> //The crisis on the East Coast is only getting worse. Our inpatient care facilities here are nearing max capacity—we've got 107,000 beds filled, the most we've ever had—but we don't know how to treat these cases without CLERIC. Thankfully, we're managing a little better this morning because of a small miracle: Dr. Andrea Maslov. Many of you might know Andrea as the legendary \"Red's Red\" for her time as a field medic with MTF Alpha-1. For everyone else: Dr. Maslov is a Type Red—a healing reality bender, a powerful one—and she's on our side. She lost her abilities for years, but yesterday, something happened. We don't know why, but she woke up this morning with all her healing power returned. The O5 have put her in charge of our floor operations while those of us in administration work on digging out of the CLERIC hole. Welcome back, Andrea. We need you now, more than ever.//\n> //- Dir.

The two men briskly walk behind her. She does not look back.]//\n> \n> **Sams:** Um... Dr. Maslov, we need to speak with you.\n> \n> **Maslov:** You’ll have to keep up, then. Walk and talk.\n> \n> **Sams:** It’s about the, ah, CLERIC system.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Mmm.\n> \n> **Sams:** Yes. As you, ah, know, there has been an error with the system which demands immediate attention. As a powerful healer yourself—congratulations on your rejuvenation, by the way—we believe you may be able to help with this.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Is that so.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Yes, well, ah…\n> \n> //[Sams looks around at the nurses, then leans in close.]//\n> \n> **Sams:** We think there’s a patient who needs your attention.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you know?\n> \n> **Sams:** Ah… What?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you know you were addicting your own staff?\n> \n> **Torres:** Doctor, please be careful of what you say in the presence of your nurses. We can’t vouch for their safety if—\n> \n> **Maslov:** Perhaps you cannot, but I can. You are here to ask for help from me, so answer my question. Did you know?\n> \n> //[The men look at each other.]//\n> \n> **Torres:** You’ve read the file, doctor. We considered that there might have been a moderate risk of—\n> \n> **Maslov:** So you knew?\n> \n> **Torres:** Yes. We knew.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you exploit it?\n> \n> **Torres:** …What?\n> \n> **Maslov:** Also in your file.\n> \n> //[Maslov puts her hand out. Her tech hands her a photocopied document. She shows the men; it is a copy of SCP-8002-1’s documentation. She hands it to the men and points at a highlighted passage:]//\n\n> //__The energy SCP-8002-1 emits is primarily beneficial, although estimates suggest it forms dependence with repeated exposure.

In fact, it █████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████.__//\n\n> **Maslov:** This redaction. What is? “In fact, it” what?\n> \n> **Sams:** You gave a copy of this to your staff? Look, I can’t—\n> \n> **Maslov:** You can. In fact, I am insisting upon it at this moment. Tell me now.\n> \n> **Torres:** Doctor—\n> \n> **Maslov:** Foundation does not simply redact secrets. It redacts secrets which are bad for it. How many it has killed, how it hurts people, what goes on at worst of its black sites. You know this?\n> \n> **Sams:** Er—\n> \n> **Maslov:** This is secret which is bad for it. Here in the middle of paragraph about how it knows its people are addicted to its treatment, redacted paragraph beginning “in fact.” As in, “on the contrary, we may think of this addiction differently than you might expect.” I have seen maybe, 2,000 classified files in 18 years on Red Right Hand. I am right, yes?\n> \n> **Maslov:** So, how might one think of widespread addiction differently? Positively, maybe? When one controls something many employees now want badly and cannot find elsewhere?\n> \n> **Torres:** Doctor, if you continue, I’m warning you that—\n> \n> //[Maslov rounds on Sams. Her entourage stops, looking on, filling the hallway. Everyone is silent. Maslov raises a finger in front of Sams’ nose. It glows white with pale heat.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** You cannot threaten me anymore.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you exploit this addiction?\n> \n> **Sams:** We knew, ah. We knew that, perhaps, since the radiation was harmless and even beneficial, it might be an effective incentive. On rare occasions, when needed.\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you evaluate MTF risk differently because of radiation?\n> \n> **Torres:** Now that’s—\n> \n> **Maslov:** Because you can just heal them up, da? Throw us in. I saw it when I was in the field. Since I was there, we were given worse dangers, because it was assumed I could fix. That is how…\n> \n> **Maslov:** That is how four of my team died. And how I lost healing for three years.\n> \n> //[Silence.]//\n> \n> **Maslov:** Did you do?\n> \n> **Torres:** …Yes. Of course.

No part of it is ever to be classified for any reason.**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:cd-ver2\n|lv=1\n|item=SCP-8002\n|class=Thaumiel\n|site-responsible=SCP-8002\n|director=Maslov, Andrea\n|research-head=Maslov, Andrea\n|assigned-task-force=MTF Phi-12\n]]\n\n[[<]]\n**Item #: SCP-8002**\n\n**Object Class: Thaumiel**\n\n**Description:** SCP-8002 is a 503-acre subterranean megastructure operated by the Foundation. The entire complex was previously taken up by the organization’s main hospital and medical center. As of 2024-02-19, it also serves an additional purpose: regeneration and medical support for SCP-8002-1, a deific entity superficially similar to an enormous golden pheasant //(Chrysolophus pictus).// This entity was the source of the radiation which once permeated the facility; its current injuries, inflicted by the Foundation in an effort to force higher radiation output, prevent it from emitting more than a trace amount.\n\nSCP-8002 remains the Foundation’s primary hospital. However, without the benefit of Cleric Radiation, much of the institution’s previous operations are critically compromised. This situation has been further complicated by strikes and coordinated organizing by hospital care staff, largely supported by newly-appointed site director Andrea Maslov. Due to a preexisting agreement between the Overseer Council and Dir. Maslov—made as a condition for the director's care of SCP-8002-1—the following measures have been approved for staff:\n\n* Increased hiring budget by 600%\n* Increased training budget by 800%\n* Increased overtime pay and sick pay for all staff\n* Newly-introduced measures to reduce unnecessary deployment of MTF\n* Updated facilities and infrastructure to support operations less dependent on CR\n\nThrough increased staffing and careful rationing of CR access, Dir. Maslov succeeded in resolving an ongoing care crisis at the facility and across the U.S. East Coast. Her paradigms have since been implemented to begin more sustainable care for anomalously-afflicted patients.\n\nAt present, SCP-8002 is operating sustainably at approx. 26% of its previous capacity, without relying on more than a passing amount of SCP-8002-1's healing radiation. When SCP-8002-1's abilities are used in care, rigorous protocol is in place to ensure limited and transparent employment of its effects. Dependence is monitored, and staff are trained in appropriate prescription. Most importantly, patients are informed of the risk associated with long-term exposure.\n\n[[div style=\"color:black; background: url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8002/aeonianbluefade.png) center no-repeat; float: center; border: solid 1px #000000; padding: 15px 15px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); width: 84%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; margin-bottom: 4%; margin-top: 4%;\"]]\n\n**Proposal: 8002-Soul**\nThe lower third of the SCP-8002 complex has been redesigned as a containment and rejuvenation facility for SCP-8002-1, in hopes that the creature may be restored to its previous capabilities. However, regardless of its ultimate contributions, the Foundation is dedicated to sustaining and supporting SCP-8002-1 for the remainder of its natural life.\n\nIn creating care for such a complex entity, the Foundation invested heavily in a wide variety of state-of-the-art support for anomalous beings. It has been suggested that these systems may be used for care of other injured anomalies, incorporating care for such entities as part the organization's hospital system. This proposal has been designated Project 8002-Soul.\n\nAs of 2024-02-29, Project 8002-Soul status is: APPROVED. 36 anomalous entities are now cared for on-site, with more scheduled for admittance in the near future; consult appendix 416.4.a for a complete list.\n\nSCP-8002-1 remains in good condition. It has begun to emit an increasing quantity of Cleric Radiation, growing at a rate of approx. 0.01 milliwatt/cm2/day. The entity is alert, calm, and—per Dr. Maslov's reports—warm to the touch.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:colend]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/<]]\n\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n _\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8001]]] | SCP-8002 | [[[SCP-8003]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** aeonianblue.png\n> **Name:** (if different from filename)\n> **Author:**  LaShonda1980\n> **License:** Creative Commons Zero 1.0 Public Domain License\n> **Source Link:** https://openclipart.org/detail/312355/wing\n\n> **Filename:** N/A\n> **Name:** Fire hole\n> **Author:**  Antonis Lamnatos\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0 \n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/74f5eea1-2842-474a-a76e-115179801a15\n\n> **Filename:** N/A\n> **Name:** old russian woman\n> **Author:** JKD Atlanta\n> **License:** CC BY 2.0 \n> **Source Link:** https://openverse.org/image/e07ace01-e6e1-4460-b079-7b9329f949da\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
