The [[span class=\"hilighter\"]]Vulnerability Exposure Index (VEX)[[/span]] database provides a centralized catalogue for disclosing and documenting known threats to **SIMULACRUM**'s environment, inhabitants, items, virtual sandboxes, and external infrastructure. VEX records are enumerated by their entry IDs (VEX-YYYY-NNN) which documents the year that the identified vulnerability was discovered in and a unique sequence numerical for categorization. \n\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Click here for more information...\" hide=\"Click here to hide information...\" hideLocation=\"bottom\"]]\n[[<]]\n\nVEX records provide in-depth information regarding specific vulnerabilities. This includes a description, impact, status, severity, related item(s), assigned authorities, mitigation procedures, and any repercussions determined to be directly or indirectly caused by the threat itself. All records are appropriately color-coded based on severity. \n\n[[span class=\"hilighter\"]]Severity[[/span]] indicates the perceived risk that a vulnerability possesses if left unmitigated. This metric is assessed by a numerical scale ranging from [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--accent-color));\"]]0.0[[/span]] (Informational) to [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--mutant-green));\"]]0.1 - 2.5[[/span]] (Low), [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--skylight-blue));\"]]2.6 - 5.0[[/span]] (Medium), [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--neon-orange));\"]]5.1 - 7.5[[/span]] (High), or [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--deep-crimson));\"]]7.6 - 10.0[[/span]] (Critical). Severity does not always suggest that an unmitigated threat will have widespread effects; rather it indicates the perceived damage that it can potentially cause overall.\n\nTo determine the scale at which a vulnerability can affect multiple systems or users, VEX records document a vulnerability's [[span class=\"hilighter\"]]Impact[[/span]]. Impact is measured as [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--accent-color));\"]]MINIMAL[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--mutant-green));\"]]LOW[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--skylight-blue));\"]]MEDIUM[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--neon-orange));\"]]HIGH[[/span]], or [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--deep-crimson));\"]]CRITICAL[[/span]], depending on the number of items (if any) that may be affected by a specific threat. Impact assessments are not all inclusive, and may incorporate additional considerations such as **SIMULACRUM** sandbox size, Site structure, player capacity, or [[[/scp-4523|physical resource utilization]]].\n\nIn order to assist operators and personnel utilizing this database, VEX records will also display the last known [[span class=\"hilighter\"]]Status[[/span]] of a vulnerability. Status documents whether a vulnerability is [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--accent-color));\"]]PENDING[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--mutant-green));\"]]ERADICATED[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--skylight-blue));\"]]REMEDIED[[/span]], [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--neon-orange));\"]]ACTIVE[[/span]], or [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--deep-crimson));\"]]FUTILE[[/span]]. As status only reflects a vulnerability's last known activity, any outstanding impact or repercussions caused by a particular threat are not considered in this metric.[[footnote]]For example, a successfully executed malware signature that was quarantined and [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--skylight-blue));\"]]REMEDIED[[/span]] by intrusion prevention systems (IPSs) would not be considered [[span style=\"font-weight: bold;color: rgb(var(--neon-orange));\"]]ACTIVE[[/span]] even if impacted data or systems are still currently affected.[[/footnote]] \n\nIndividual VEX records are documented and supported by an assigned [[span class=\"hilighter\"]]Authority[[/span]]. Authorities can be comprised of **SIMULACRUM** operators, administrators, or other third-party organizations and Groups of Interest (GoI). Assigned authorities are responsible for reporting, and classifying cyberanomalous threats as they manifest. Multiple authorities may also collaborate together in order to properly document discovered vulnerabilities, improve relations, and/or enhance cooperation efforts made between other virtualized or physical parties.

Players exploiting this vulnerability could disrupt these simulations through physical interaction or by executing elevated commands.\n\nPlayers with internal system access to their own sandboxes could also \"piggyback\" off their instances and into other remote sandboxes. In one case, several unknown attackers were able to sabotage the SCP-6882 virtual instance and hijack its noospheric platform interface, causing connected players to undergo rapid mental and physical deterioration before an unexpected sandbox crash later occured.\n\nAttackers were able to successfully input coordinate commands to bypass detection; however, improper values resulted in threat actors falling out-of-bounds and missing subsequent bound checks.

Continued conflicts could cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute additional root-level commands.\n\nIn some instances, players experiencing multiple requests between both SCP-6872 and SCP-2718 could also be afflicted by both conditions simultaneously, leading to corrupted reference caches and other errors. \n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"6\"]]\n**REPERCUSSIONS:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"6\"]]\nDuring the rapid deployment of sub-simulations within SCP-6872, an increased strain on incoming state requests resulted in players being incorrectly assigned to SCP-2718. During this period, players experiencing the \"DECEASED\" state would not be transported to their simulated death sequences-- rather, affected individuals would either be terminated from their hosting simulation entirely or remain permanently immobile and unable to disconnect from their sessions. This resulted in players being in multiple states of \"DECEASED\" between several sandboxes.\n\nIn other circumstances, physical players would be completely ejected from all sandboxes. Excessive electric discharge caused by the vulnerability sent uncontrolled shocks through sensitive neural interfaces, physically disabling players and locking their player pods indefinitely. Players would still report active heartbeats despite being clinically deceased, bypassing all system monitoring tools for extended periods of time. This resulted in player pods being contaminated with excess organisms, including bacteria, mites, mold, and flies.\n\nAll later attempts to remove players from their pods universally ended in failure.\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell colspan=\"6\"]]\n**MITIGATION:**\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell colspan=\"6\"]]\nAdditional software-level checks against possible overflows have been implemented to prevent any issues with SCP-6872 and SCP-2718.

Due to issues with {{cron}}, Docker version number strings would sometimes be misinterpreted as invalid character strings when updated.\n\nBecause of this, severe momentary failure for all SIMULA instances that depended on the legacy system time occurred.
