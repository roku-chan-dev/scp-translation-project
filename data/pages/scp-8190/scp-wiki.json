SCP-8190 appears to correlate directly with certain sections of the //Foundation Employee Handbook, First Edition//, from which the rise of related semiohazardous qualities were first noted having spontaneously manifested around Class-C personnel and employee of interest James A. Harkness, also referred to as PoI-8190.\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block\nname=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8190/manuel.png|\ncaption=Instance of the //First Edition// Handbook.|\nalign=right|\nwidth=300px |\n]]\n\nOne physical copy of the first edition handbook is still in existence, held in a locked glass display case located within the Site-19 atrium, featuring a commemorative plaque celebrating the Foundation's progress as an organization dedicated to the maintenance of the Veil. At time of the handbook's printing, Foundation collective infrastructure represented about 0.4% of what it does today, with employees stationed at less than twenty secure facilities worldwide.\n\nFollowing the development of novel detection systems for anomalous phenomena, the remaining handbook was analyzed, revealing larger-than-average Akiva radiation emissions. No other anomalous properties have been detected, and Akiva radiation levels have not changed since initial measurements were taken.\n\nAlthough Foundation records indicate PoI-8190 was employed by the Organization for almost three decades,[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]Plurality of which was spent from within network security, other infotech-related departments, and in brief stints as interim staff—owed in part to a notably high cognitive resistance threshold.[[/span]] specific details regarding his employment history are missing from the database. This discrepancy was not detected until his recovery, which prompted an internal investigation into the AIMS Consensus System that was ultimately futile.[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]The AIMS Consensus System is a handshake-based confirmation network used to prevent data loss and manipulation by forcing revisions to archives that do not match the rest of the network. Established in 2025.[[/span]]\n\n\nRecovered materials and post-action interviews with Harkness imply that SCP-8190 primarily impacts the original code of employee conduct, though more recent evidence suggests the entirety of the guidebook may be susceptible. Affected individuals are unable to deviate from the guidelines discussed in relevant sections and will experience retroactive changes in reality that ensure this is the case. In the rare event such retroactive changes are not possible, affected employees will vanish, a facsimile construct filling the role of the lost employee shortly thereafter. Constructs are capable of emulating human behavior and completing most duties required.\n\nOther impacted statements or sentiments include the necessity of coffee in the break room, certain members of the administration being unable to close the doors to their office, and the spontaneous appearance of employee group photos despite none being taken.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8190/dondlogo.png style=\"opacity:0.6; filter:invert(1); display: inline;\" width=\"40px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"darkdocument handbook\" style=\"background-color:#151616;\"]]\n[[size 80%]]//Excerpt: The Foundation Employee Handbook, First Edition//[[/size]]\n----\n@@ @@\n+++++ [[span class=\"cond\"]]__Employee Guidelines: The Basics__[[/span]]\n \n[[span class=\"cond\"]]On your first day as Foundation personnel, it's important that you familiarize yourself with the way our organization is, well, organized!

He takes a seat at the central table. A dense stack of papers is seen atop the surface before him, struggling to escape an overfilled manila folder. The man averts his eyes from the stationery, visibly uncomfortable. Director Quade enters shortly thereafter, taking the seat opposite after exchanging minimal pleasantries.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Well, you certainly seem a bit worse for wear. I'll make this quick so we can get you settled back into Foundation living. Sound good?\n\n//<PoI-8190 is silent, thoughts elsewhere. Director Quade opens the manila folder, now in his lap, and begins flipping through the documents inside.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** My word, you //have// been gone a while.

What, you'd rather go back downstairs? It can be arranged.\n\n**PoI-8190:** Actually, could I go back to [[span class=\"grn\"]][[[SCP-8888 | testing kill hazards on myself]]][[/span]]? That was more my speed.\n\n= //<A pause, followed by the creaking of a chair as Director Quade leans forward.>//\n\n**Dir.

It's one or the other, Mr. Harkness; back in the borehole, or back in a cubicle.\n\n= //<Director Quade leans back against the chair. Harkness is heard sighing. Silence for five seconds.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Well?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I'm thinking.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** What is there to think about? I mean, let's be pragmatic about this, alright? You were good at the jobs you had...//well//, most of them. We should be able to find something related to your strengths.\n\nThe need for personnel in many positions adjacent to your degree has decreased drastically since the migration to AIMS, a likely no-go there. Not sure how I feel about putting you back into Conceptual Studies; I hear you //[[span class=\"grn\"]][[[SCP-3533|dissolved a person]]][[/span]]//.\n\n**PoI-8190:** That was an accident!\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Mhm. //<Reading>// You claim to have been briefly involved in the Metaphysical Sciences Department as a Liaison for... //<Trails off>// What is this, exactly?\n\n**PoI-8190:** The Narrativistics Division. I held a [[span class=\"grn\"]][[[Narrativistics-and-you|seminar]]][[/span]] a ways back about it. I'd elaborate but I'm pretty sure I'd just confuse us //both// anyway, so I guess I'd simply insist you 'ask my author'.\n\n//<This evokes no response from Director Quade, and Harkness looks around the room, briefly disoriented, having heard his voice speaking without command of his mouth.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //I've// never heard of Narrativistics, and I can't send you to Metaphysical if you have no relevant experience.\n\n**PoI-8190:** No openings //anywhere//, then? Shame. Really, huge shame. Maybe we try again tomorrow?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** And where would you be spending the evening? Employee guidelines state you must be on assignment to receive housing accommodations. Seems to me that the best course of action is to return you to one of your older positions with the Foundation. Looks like you could resume your clerical duties as Grant Requisitions Clerk for the Department of Macro Engineering and Design, what do you say?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I have //no// idea what that is. I don't even think that's a real department name. I was a //network systems engineer// in the //IT Department//. I can't imagine any of my old jobs are just waiting for me if the only one you could find is one I never had.\n\n= //<Silence. Director Quade smiles and closes the folder, returning it to the table's surface.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Very perceptive, Mr. Harkness. And prudent, that you'd point out such a discrepancy. Tell me—\n\n//<The Director hands Harkness a business card. Harkness studies the custom lettering before turning it over in his hand.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Do you know what I do for a living?\n\n**PoI-8190:** Well, you... work. For... money?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** No, no—Er, I mean, yes, very broadly that //is// what happens but, specifically?\n \n**PoI-8190:** Easy, you're a, uh, departmental Director... So, you direct the—//<Reading card again>//—Department of Notational Divisions, right? I'm guessing it's something math-related?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Department of //Notional// Divisions. Not math, //biology.// You know about biology, yes?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I have a degree in software engineering and minored in film. What do you think?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Got it. See, in a complex ecological system, survival of the fittest is rule zero of Natural Order; humans were eaten until they ate. They beat and killed one another for a parcel of verdant paradise, or the minerals beneath their feet. Territory. Resources. Security. Competition. The same behavior applies to a herd, to a community. Even a workplace.  \n\n**PoI-8190:** Uh.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Bear with me now. See, the thing is, Mother Nature doesn't play fair. Hardly ever do two groups start on equal playing fields. Most are stuck in the situations they've been given, but there are a few //imitators// that adapt to their environment, move undetected within it, and learn to play the game well enough to skim off the backs of bigger business. Apex predators of corporate espionage. Catch my drift?\n\n**PoI-8190:** So, the Department of Notional Divisions finds these 'imitators'—\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Correct.\n\n**PoI-8190:** —and then, what, shuts them down? Reports them to the Administration?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** We have different procedures for different situations, nothing you'd be too unfamiliar with.\n\n**PoI-8190:** What about the Redundancy Department?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Sorry?\n\n**PoI-8190:** The Department of Redundancy Department. 'The foundation of the Foundation'—Their motto, not mine—honestly, it feels condescending in retrospect.\n\nI know for a fact you guys visited; I recognize the emblem. You took measurements and left... I kept thinking you'd come back. Then, ten years passed and I'd convinced myself that the only one who cared enough to get me out of there was me. At least I was wrong about that much.  \n\n**Dir. Quade:** I understand your frustration. The Organization has many legitimate departments possessing esoteric origins and inexplicable duties. We have to adhere to the same guidance as everyone else, and that means following the order of operations. We can't just boot every weird department we come across.\n\n**PoI-8190:**  You guys weren't even the ones to get me out of that hole. What was stopping you? Why didn't you tell anyone?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Bureaucracy, Mr. Harkness. Good, old-fashioned red tape.\n\n**PoI-8190:**  But—\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Can we get back on track here? I'm in the process of offering you a new role, if you didn't notice.\n\n**PoI-8190:** What kind of role?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** I have a feeling you'll be able to complete the functions of this assignment easily, as it aligns well with some of your more recent experience.\n\nYou'd be sitting at your own desk, reading dossiers on departments, and flagging any that seem suspicious. You can send them off for review, internal investigation, or for dismantlement. Take lunch at your own time, breaks, bathroom use, all of that, as long as it rests within the boundaries of the rules, anyway.\n\nThere's even a completion bonus for each file you wrap without error.\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Pauses, eyes narrowing.>// If I said yes, would I still be able to leave the building?  \n\n**Dir. Quade:** Hm? Of course you'd be able to leave, you're able to now—though, I should remind you, as per your onboarding contracts, you are restricted to specific radii outside of this and other relevant buildings for the duration of employment. It's also currently mid-snowstorm.\n\n//<The Director indicates toward a large, icy window to his right. A torrent of snow cascades down from skies unknown, muted and gray, piling on the equally-gray sill.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** You have outstanding responsibilities here, anyway.\n\n**PoI-8190:** Do I, though?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Let's find out, shall we? //<Extends hand to PoI-8190.>//\n\n**PoI-8190:** I-I suppose. //<PoI-8190 Returns the gesture. The two shake hands very briefly before retracting them.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Excellent. //<The Director wipes his palm on his slacks before standing.>// Please, this way to your new office. I'm sure it will be more comfortable than the last.\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Pushing chair back and rising in tow.>// Second to last. Not sure how I'd define my workspace in {{[DEPARTMENT_ID:DENIED]}}, but it didn't seem to fall on a range of comfortable to uncomfortable. Is nonfortable a word?   \n\n**Dir. Quade:** No, but, I'm sorry, //who?//\n\n**PoI-8190:**  The Department of {{[DEPARTMENT_ID:DENIED]}}. They helped me out of Redundancy.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //<Sighs.>// Mr. Harkness, I don't know how else to put this, but the Department of {{[DEPARTMENT_ID:DENIED]}} is not a real department.\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Pauses.>// Ah, goddamnit. I thought the name sounded a bit out there.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** You'll pick up on it. Don't let it get to you.

Quade:** So—you were saying something about a \"bigger issue\" with your assignment?\n\n**PoI-8190:** Right, so. I read the materials you gave me, looked over your previous determinations. I still don't think I'm ID'ing them well in praxis.\n\nLike, here—//<Holds up a blue folder from a stack to his right.>//—the Ethics Committee?—//<Tossing the blue folder back down, indicating to the empty white folder on the desk in front of him.>//—the Antimemetics Division? //Antimemetics//? It can't be possible to determine if departments like these are real or manufactured... Whatever they do,—//<Sighs.>//—I'm at a loss. //I don't even know if they exist in the first place.//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** You of all people should know that impossible things happen frequently in our line of work. Sometimes, it's best to simply go with your gut—\n\n**PoI-8190:** //Go with my gut?// These are people's jobs at risk here. Their livelihoods. I can't go with my gut using the amount of information I'm given for some of these; the 'debrief' I was given about The Department of Unreality was a six hour video of an empty lecture hall. At three hours and forty-seven minutes in, I //think// I heard someone cough.\n\nThe silence and lack of clarity made me reflect a bit though. Realized some things.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Oh?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I realized, I have no idea what I am doing here, and know absolutely nothing about this department. Prior to being in Redundancy and seeing you in the corner of my eye, I'd never known of Notional Divisions. How many folks are in this department? How many are constructs?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //<Nods.>// It's natural to have these questions and thoughts, though not a single person in the history of Notional Divisions could say for sure, sadly. We're dealing with //extremely// powerful retrocausal properties. We have been studying the anomaly for some time now, and have little to show for it, I will admit; Constructs are functionally identical to their human coworkers and we have exhausted nearly all possible avenues in attempting to distinguish the two apart.\n\nI have a theory about you, however. You might be one of the only Foundation employees capable of completing this task—//Maybe the only one.//\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Laughs incredulously.>// You're joking, right?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Not at all. Your resistance to anomalous influence may help you perceive minute differences in the two, as a \"gut feeling\". I have your most recent performance data right here, let's take a look and see if my hypothesis is correct.\n\n//<The Director opens the thick manila folder and stares at its contents, half his face obscured by buff-colored document keeper. >//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Just as I thought: You've yet to mistakenly file one department. So even if you're feeling insecure about your current state of affairs, I would say the data doesn't support that conclusion.\n\nIf you need constructive feedback, I'd say your overall wrap time could use improvement, but I think we can chalk that up to self-doubt, you know?\n\n//<The Director pauses, closing the folder and placing it on the table.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Do you think said doubts might have something to do with your experience downstairs? It might help to talk about it. Process some things.\n\n= //<Silence from PoI-8190.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Maybe it had something to do with your previous position. The, ah, Department of {{[DEPARTMENT_ID:DENIED]}}, right?\n\n**PoI-8190:** What about them? They aren't real, it doesn't matter. Like you said.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** How did they free you from the hole?\n\n**PoI-8190:** They came upstairs to meet me, or something. They were way weirder than I, which I found notable. And sure, everything strange is notable when you've been doing paperwork for five thousand days straight, but these guys were... they looked... impossible. Really freaked me out when they started showing up in my periphery. Then they walked up to me and waved.\n\nI think... They weren't sure if I was aware at all. They visited a couple times before deciding I was. I begged my body to do react, but—\n\n**Dir. Quade:** So, //how// did they—\n\n**PoI-8190:** //Let me finish.// C'mon. You //asked me// to talk about this! Jesus fucking—I would've given a kidney to hear someone's fucking shitkickers stomping around up here, shaking dust into my eyes. Instead I was given //nothing//. For years. I was //exiled//. I //should// be dead, but I'm not, and it still somehow feels like pulling the short straw. Like... you know I joined the Foundation //accidentally//, right?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** There are always multiple perspectives; to survive such adversity, for as long as you did, and come out as intact as you are. Doesn't that mean anything to you?\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Thumbs up.>// Sure. I transferred departments. That's how I got out. Something obviously wanted me back in there, though. Good thing I can also be a stubborn motherfucker, right?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //<Clears throat.>// So, you had just broken free of the loop. How'd you make your way from Redundancy to the PA system?\n\n**PoI-8190:** So you //could// hear me... //<Exhales a drawn-out sigh.>// Yeah. That's fine. One of my rescuers had a fair bit of memory of his past life. He claimed to have worked on the A/V setup of Site-19, including running cables for the announcement system. Thought he might know where parts of it were, and guessed that they'd still be functional.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** And?\n\n**PoI-8190:** You heard me, so, yeah. Obviously. The controls still existed //metaconceptually//, abstracted under eroding currents of temporal soup, broken into conceptual building blocks, abstracted further down, landing in the metaconceptual plane of comprehending concepts themselves; the concept of interaction, the concept of context, the concept of roles, among others. The concept of pressing-finger-to-button is impossible to interact with if you don't understand what role you play in that transaction; are you finger or button? Turns out you're not quite either but definitely more one than the other.\n\nGot it figured out eventually, though.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** And this was what you wanted?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I //wanted// out. And to not be existentially traumatized by my occupation. I didn't know that was even a possibility when I got my degree. I would've assumed that required at least a Master's and a tenured position in academia.\n\nBesides, they wanted me out, too. They saw time differently, and for a minute, on some unknown fraction of physical timespace, I saw it. They were afraid.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Afraid? Afraid of what? Did they tell you?\n\n= //<Silence. PoI-8190 stares at the Director, a look of amusement on his face.>//\n\n**PoI-8190:** You know, I think I've finally got a confident read on you.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** What does that mean, exactly?\n\n**PoI-8190:** Your body language, your false praise, the way you talk in general. Your //probing questions//.  \n\n**Dir. Quade:** What are you talking about?\n\n**PoI-8190:** You've got construct written all over you.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Why would you think that?\n\n**PoI-8190:** Oh, you don't know? I can see constructs easily. You told me that, remember? Maybe my metrics will jog your memory.\n\n= //<PoI-8190 grabs the beige folder on the surface between them and swiftly dumps its contents onto the table. The pages scatter.

What now?\n\n//<Director Quade stares at Harkness with an unreadable expression. Blank paper litters the shared office space.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** I suppose that's up to you. If you apologize, earnestly, I won't write you up, and we can consider it just between us. An outburst caused by stressors from your previous situation and your struggle to reintegrate back into Foundation living. More than enough of a reason to explain it away.\n\n**PoI-8190:** But—Why were all the papers //blank//? Where are my metrics?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Placebo is very powerful. Your work will be more difficult now that you have disillusioned yourself. Empty praise does not mean empty purpose.\n\n**PoI-8190:** How many departments did I get wrong, then?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //<sighs>// It's not that simple, James.\n\n**PoI-8190:** How? A department is either extant or manufactured, right?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** All departments were manufactured at some point. The Foundation wasn't formed with //divisions// and //black sites//, they popped up later, when the time was right.\n\n**PoI-8190:** That's just being pedantic, though, because you said it yourself: imitators and competition, predators and prey.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** That's only part of the picture. You may know that departments spontaneously manifest as per SCP-8190's effect, but did you know the effect is... intelligent? Deliberate?\n\n**PoI-8190:** I don't see how that's possible.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Departments manifest as they're needed. Compliance. Quotas. Fulfillment. Efficiency. Where there is demand, supply is not far behind. It starts with competition, sure, but it ends with //progress//. An ideal Foundation exists at the end of this road. Thank the good book, and its corporate divinity, for that.\n\n**PoI-8190:** //The good book//? ...You don't strike me as religious.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Hard not to be, in my position. We were molded with purpose, placed into this very facility with a drive to discern real from molded, an impossible task. The lesson is in our very existence: to discern our creator. To understand //why//. You must know what I'm talking about by now.\n\n**PoI-8190:** No, I don't. I don't think I want to, either.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** I have memories of a life I didn't have. It's as real to me as anything else. Yet, I know it is manufactured. I only know this because of my position within Notional Divisions. How certain are you of your own internal narrative, Mr. Harkness?\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Sighs.>// Not very. But I don't ascribe it to the bureaucratic equivalent of Last Thursdayism.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Last Thursdayism with a bounded recurrent timeframe, more like. You are aware of the concept of [[span class=\"grn\"]][https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_recurrence_theorem Poincaré recurrence][[/span]], are you not?\n\n**PoI-8190:** Er—It's been a long time since ergodic theory was on my radar but, yes? States rebound, after a set interval. Systems repeat.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** So we'll just have to wait and see if you're still here in the next one.\n\n**PoI-8190:** Wait, what?\n\n**Dir. Quade:** Construct or not, you've failed to keep multiple positions with our Organization. We've given you opportunity after opportunity and you have let each one slip through your fingers. Unfortunately, the Foundation doesn't just //let people go//. Especially insubordinates who have been replacing //legitimate Departments// with //frauds//. It's a shame, you were so disillusioned by your time in the Hole that you started undermining your employers as revenge. Luckily, I was there to stop you before you could cause even more damage, but who's to say how much you've already done?\n\n**PoI-8190:** You—You fucking //bastard//! You set me up?!\n\n**Dir. Quade:** A bit deserved, don't you think? After all, you were //offered// purpose and turned it down, multiple times. You should be thanking me for the opportunity, but alas. You already know what happens to employees without purpose; purpose is created for them. What do you think happens to employees who //reject// purpose?\n\n**PoI-8190:** No, I don't—I don't know.\n\n//<The Director leans forward with the same smile he always has.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //They are replaced.//\n\n//<The room shakes, overhead tube lighting flickering briefly.>//\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Looking around.>// What—? What was that?!\n\n**Dir. Quade:** That, my friend, is the sound of [[span class=\"st\"]]BUREAUMANCY[[/span]], knocking at the door. Reality making way for something far more powerful than itself.  \n\n**PoI-8190:** I don't understand, I tried my best here! You lied to my face about my accuracy, how many times?! This is //your// fault—!\n\n//<Harkness grabs another piece of paper off the table and scratches the pen at its surface with nervous energy. A messy stack of scribbles are beside him, which all look vaguely alike.>//\n \n**Dir. Quade:** You're right, James, but I haven't been completely honest with you. Notional Divisions has a //secondary// objective. Well, it's more a secret primary objective that you've been carrying out for us.\n\n**PoI-8190:** —No.\n \n**Dir. Quade:** Yes. In fact, you were integral our plan; if it wasn't for AIMS taking over your duties, you'd not have transferred to Redundancy, which would not have put you directly in our crosshairs. The Book had willed it, as it is the Foundation's godhead, bound in hardcopy.\n\n//<The room trembles once more.>//\n\n**PoI-8190:** I think... I think I'm starting to understand—The Book you keep mentioning, it's that ancient employee manual I pass by every morning now. Isn't it? It's the source of all this.\n \n**Dir. Quade:** Don't jump to any conclusions. More than the book, it's the entire Foundation. We have become larger-than-life. Our physical bounds can no longer contain the metaphysical or conceptual idea of what we represent. And we, constructs, are intrinsically connected to SCP-8190. And you are like us, in that regard.\n\n**PoI-8190:** //<Doodling.>// I'm //not// a construct. I'm real.\n\n**Dir. Quade:** How would you know? Your memories of Redundancy's Borehole sound a tad fantastical. I've seen plenty of Site-19s and none of them had a borehole. I'd barely have believed you had help from {{[DEPARTMENT_ID:DENIED]}}, if it weren't for the fact that I heard our demiurge erase them from existence, right after they spoke your name.\n\n**PoI-8190:** You //what?//\n\n//<The room sways and Harkness' stomach turns.>//\n\n**Dir Quade:** Yes. Now, sit back and relax; that same fate is approaching. This is the end of the line.  Construct or human, real memories or fake.\n\n**PoI-8190:** Oh, they're real, you wanna know how I know? Qualia. For example, it took me a few tries, but a memory like this. //<Slides over a finished drawing to Director Quade.>//\n\n**Dir. Quade:** //Hm?// What's this—?\n\n//<The Director gets a good look at the image, which causes his body to stiffen. His eyes shake rapidly, jaw clamping with force, grimacing as blood begins to seep from between his clenched teeth, soon followed by his nose. Quade falls to the ground and begins convulsing. Harkness stands and looks down at the body.>//\n\n**PoI-8190:** I told you I've tested kill agents on myself. This one isn't lethal, I think. Hopefully my //memory// is accurate, right? Oh, please, don't get up. I'm done.  \n\nI'm going to go put a stop to this. See you never.\n\n//<Harkness grabs the image off the table, running out of the room, the Director's groans of discomfort growing rapidly inaudible as he sprints down a familiar corridor, only to find it looping back around to where he just was. Retracing steps brings the man to a dead end with a bare wall. Site-19 would not make this easy for him.>//\n\n\"Hey, you, stop!\"\n\n//<An unknown voice echoes from behind Harkness, who ignores this and continues down the path he originally traveled, finding it branching off at a T-junction instead of looping back again. He takes a left, but stops abruptly as two individuals guard the path ahead.>//\n \n//<A simple flash of the paper-in-hand frees open the passage, though the march of more footsteps inbound echo from the endless connecting pathways of Site-19. Coordinated, wordless drones with one thought on their mind: survival. Protecting their parcel of verdant paradise, at all costs.>//\n\n//<And really, who was he to take that away from them? He accepted the offer from Notional Divisions, knowing full well what it entailed. Was he truly so full of himself to think he could place value on a person's occupation, simply because it kept them busy more than it provided profits or results? Is there not value in keeping busy? Harkness thought about these moral quandaries while running, wishing he had formed an opinion on them sooner. Even now, he was unsure.>//\n\n//<Hands tug at the back of Harkness' shirt, but he manages to shrug them off, taking a sharp turn into a four-way intersection that throws off his pursuers for a few vital moments. He doesn't spend time catching his breath, however, instead diverting course to stop in one of the many uninspired break rooms within Site-19, grabbing a campfire lighter used to ignite a perpetually-grimy range next to an equally-grimy microwave. Yelling from outside the room causes his heart to skip a beat.>//\n\n//<Fortunately, Harkness' doodle proves offensive enough to invoke the intended reaction once or twice more, until the paper is roughly swiped out of his hand, tearing in the process. The man runs back into the hall and towards the massive central atrium he had passed through so many times before. Just below the surface is the very same borehole he would find himself stuck within for nearly fifteen years.>//\n\n//<Harkness runs up to the glass display case, nearly tackled by a mob of personnel screaming threats and pleas for their lives. Ignoring this, he kicks the glass inward and retrieves a gray, faded manuscript. It's warm to the touch, even before the attempted arson. An elbow collides with Harkness' head and his vision erupts in stars and scotomas, though he refuses to relinquish the object, even as consciousness nearly slips from his body.>//  \n\n//<Flicking at the lighter in his hand, Harkness begs audibly for it to serve its intended purpose, mind no longer considering the moral implications of his actions and now focused purely on his own survival. Forces pull and push at the man from all angles, human and construct, both, or neither. Just as Harkness begins to bleed, textures collide to create sparks and heat, aerosolized fuel becomes sustained flame, touched to paper results in the burning of scripture. A false prophecy of labor for a new world, reducing to ashes. Such is life. The surroundings start to blur, becoming metastable. Feeling the ground shift from tile, to carpet, to corrugated steel, Harkness squeezes his eyelids shut, burying his head in his arms, and waits for something to happen or for him to die.>//\n@@ @@\n//<A moment later, the entire facility implodes.>//\n[[/div]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n«END TRANSCRIPT»\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[row]]\n[[hcell]]\n[[/hcell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n= [[span class=\"st\"]]END ADDENDUM[[/span]]\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8190/dondlogo.png style=\"opacity:0.6; filter:invert(1); display: inline;\" width=\"40px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8190/collapse.png width=\"100%\"]]\n[[/=]]\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-8190/dondlogo.png style=\"opacity:0.6; filter:invert(1); display: inline;\" width=\"40px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n= .\n= .\n= .\n= .\n= .\n\n[[div class=\"modal tableb\"]]\n\n//<Suddenly, everything is quiet. There are no sounds of commotion, no angry yells or pleas, even the persistent buzz of overhead lighting and ventilation ducts vanishing without a trace. The only audible noise left is a lone, howling wind. Harkness looks up from the pitch blackness of pressing eyes against forearms to a blinding ball of burning plasma in the sky. He's lying prone in a dusty patch of dry sand, the hot air and direct sunlight finally registering as oppressive against his skin.>//\n\n//<He sits up and looks around, blinking, eyes still not yet fully adjusted to the change in scenery, quickly realizing he has zero idea where he is. No vehicles or buildings in sight, no identifying features at all, aside from an unpaved, winding road leading away from where Harkness finds himself and off into the scintillating horizon.>//\n\n//<The man groans, righting himself, reluctantly fighting against the force of gravity and winning, this time. Starting down the pathway, Harkness tries not to think about the last fifteen years. Did it even matter? To him, the answer would hinge on perceiving the differences between two indistinguishable experiences. If he couldn't tell, then there is no point in wondering.>//\n\n//<Minutes later, Harkness' slow pilgrimage into the unknown is interrupted by the sound of an engine. He cranes his neck, looking up and around, desperate to locate the source of the noise. A few moments pass and a black vehicle emerges into view, windows tinted a dark shade of impenetrable. It rolls up smoothly beside the disheveled man, doors opening without a sound as security personnel emerge, equally silent, indicating to him that this is indeed his ride, and is also not an optional one. Harkness slinks into the cool vehicle and presses up against the leather, which sticks unpleasantly to his skin.>//\n\n//<The ride is long, and with no frame of reference other than the setting sun, Harkness drifts off for a bit in the back of the car. An instant later, he wakes to a familiar-looking, gray building, perhaps his own Site-19, or one of many he may have occupied, long ago. This is all but confirmed when, after passing a curious glass display case in the vast atrium of the complex, Harkness finds himself at his old desk in the IT Department, now branded the Department of Technical Support. The dust had grown considerably in the time since, but it mattered little.

In fact, the universe was home to many.\n\nIn the first beginning, there was only void. A screaming, infinite, godless void. A vast darkness upon the face of the deep. No one spoke \"let there be light\", because no one Was. The darkness was empty, and it remained this way for eons.\n\nNature abhors a vacuum, however, and thus, after some time, that peaceful nothingness betided true chaos. A swirling farrago of blight known as //Everything//.\n\nJust as nature abhors vacuum, it abhors chaos. Nature abhors. This is all one can say for sure. Eventually, chaos gave way to order. Order lost its grasp and chaos reigned once more. This war was the first of many. Structures assembled and aligned before being forcefully broken down, reduced to their smallest possible components, then re-assembled and re-aligned again. Countless times. And yet, if you were alive to see it, it would have felt like a moment's passing.\n\nNot many were around during those early days. The universe was, for all its action and reaction, devoid of life in actuality. Humans, ever the chosen children, believed this fact made them special. A fault in intelligent design, perhaps, which spoke volumes on the nature of how \"intelligent\" that design could be.\n\nMan would try, unsuccessfully, to rid the universe of chaos. Man would also try to rid the universe of order. Ultimately, they were more effective at ridding the universe of themselves, however, their failure would be observed throughout millennia. It would be simulated. Analyzed. Compared.\n\nHumanity would create many branches in the tree of time. Those branches would be noted, when they were notable. Many would cease to exist far before they could be considered as such. This is and always has been considered the state of affairs.\n\nYet, for those few that fit the criteria, their events would be painstakingly recorded, backtracked from frayed ends by a great many eyes at the end of time.

The arm bends, dozens of joints briefly visible as it snaps into an odd angle with calculated precision, pressing itself into the black wall adjacent its form. The stalk sinks into the material effortlessly, which wrinkles and folds inwards like dark fabric. With a //click//, the needle splits at its tip into a three-pronged claw, which rips a hole into the structure, revealing more darkness behind the black curtains.\n\nThe entity does not respond. Instead, the extremity moves on its own, disappearing into the hole and telescoping outward an unknown distance. It retracts suddenly, a number of items now enclosed within its grasp. The pale, thin hand deposits its holdings before a large circular feature on the outside of its body, a single, piercing eye manifesting within the curved bounds in response. The pupil dilates, inspecting its newfound treasures: a [[span class=\"grn\"]][[[SCP-6416|puzzle cube]]][[/span]], a wooden cuckoo clock in the shape of a small two-story townhome, and a twisted steel tuning fork which hums lightly on its own.
