But a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do to stay alive sometimes, and even as I gazed at the tank containing Mr. Fish, the final capture of my assignment, all I could do was give him a sad look and walk away. What else could I have done for the poor guy, without putting my own neck on the line?\n\nThe part that really sickened me about myself was the ease with which I went through with it. I've done a few things that people would consider extreme, but I've never //betrayed// anyone. I mean, they all came. All I had to do was set up some traps, maybe a firing squad with some tranqs and bam, they were all contained. Yeah, whatever. I'm sure they all hated me before anyways - ever since what I did with Sweetie, everybody's been wanting me dead. \n\nYet, it wasn't that difficult when I captured her this time. There she was, walking through the forest, a gun in her hand that seemed so out of place in such dainty little fingers. She was searching for me. I came out from my hiding spot and looked her over. She was still as beautiful as she had ever been, and I couldn't help but feel a little flustered.\n\n\"Hello.\"\n\n\"Afternoon.\"\n\nAnd she began to pull the trigger. But no one is quicker than me. Even as her first shot whizzed by my head she collapsed. I'm not sure why I risked myself like that. Maybe I just wanted to talk with her one more time.\n\nI leaned over and pulled out the dart from her neck. And then I just stood there for a moment, looking over her prone body. When I touched her it still sent shivers down my spine. I even took out my knife and held it less than an inch from her skin, considering cutting her again. But I didn't. I'm not rolling that way anymore. And I did need to drop some old habits.\n\nWas it really my fault in doing this? I didn't have a choice. I mean, I was discontinued, and then Stripes comes after me. Me being on his list and all. My only way to live was to join the guys who would Protect me no matter what the cost. They helped me get Stripes, so I guess I owed them a favour after that. A favour big enough to keep me catching all the others. Like the one that was behind me.\n\nI walked down the long hallway from the containment chamber to the office of my new boss. A true mastermind, if there ever was one, and always dedicated to his cause. It was really a silly cause. \"Secure, Contain, and Protect.\" What kind of bullshit was that?\n\nI opened the door to his office.\n\n\"He's caught, boss,\" I said to the man behind the desk.\n\n\"Ah, good work,\" said the man.\n\n\"I suppose I'll be taking my leave now.\" I nodded to the man. \n\n\"Ah, not so fast. We can't just let you go like that.\" Can't say I wasn't expecting that. Still, there were other ways out.\n\n\"I've done my job.\"  I could give less of a shit about how much they want to study me, I was getting out.\n\n\"Ah, yes, but you're an SCP object yourself.\"\n\n\"Boss, please.\" I placed a look of desperation on my face. Just biding my time.\n\n\"Listen, you've done us good, you'll get your own furnishings and cell with the best service.\" The man walked over to me as he spoke. Good. I placed my grip on my knife.\n\n\"Boss, I'm asking you from the bottom of my heart.\" I began to pull out my knife, ready to place it at his throat.\n\nI saw a flash of movement towards my thigh, followed by a sudden pain. I looked down to see a needle sticking in it. Quick guy. Quicker than me. I hadn't thought anyone was quicker.\n\nI stumbled and collapsed against the doorway. The man watched me as I closed my eyes and drifted away.\n\n\"Sweet dreams, Mr. Redd.\"\n\n[[collapsible show=\"_\" hide=\"\"There's a charming young woman dying to meet you.\"\"]][[/collapsible]]\n\nPrevious: [[[mr-fish|16.
