Note that this ##green|FILE## has been strictly organized such that non-abstract information concerning ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## and/or ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## instances is not directly communicated via identifiers. For the sake of clarity, correct identifiers for ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## and ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## have been made distinct via blue and green coloration (respectively). Updates to this ##green|FILE##, if any, are encouraged to remain consistent with these principles.\n\n##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## instances that do not possess sapience are to be contained at Site-15. Access to such instances for research of semiontological anomalies (a.k.a. semiohazards) may be permitted to personnel possessing Level 4 clearance or higher. With regards to ##green|SCIENTIST## instances, ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## instances possessing sapience need not be contained unless, as a result of their properties or otherwise, they inhibit the containment of ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##.\n\n----\n\n**##green|EXPLANATION##:** ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## is a ##blue|HAZARD##[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]A semiontological anomaly (semiohazard) is a disruption of the Semiosphere (the medium through which information about reality travels before it is perceived or measured) which results in reality's apparent adherence to some non-real axiom.[[/span]] ##blue|COMPLEX## that simplifies 'incorrect' designations and classifications of itself and instances of ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT##.

This is also true of ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## instances.\n* Incorrect identification of the ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##, from baseline perspective, has never occurred, due to retroactive creation of objective fact. However, the state of this ##green|FILE## indicates that it has been published with incorrect designations multiple times, and subsequently became an instance of ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT##.\n\nDue to its tendency to make useful labels and categorizations redundant, ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## poses significant nomenclative difficulties to Site-15 documentation and personnel. Due to its semantic nature, ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## shares similarities with memetic hazards, and a single incorrect designation could lead to the rapid propagation of ##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## throughout Site-15 and its documents, crashing file systems and potentially causing several other containment breaches by preventing effective communication.\n\nOther known 'correct' identifiers for ##blue|SCP-INTEGER## include:\n\n* '##blue|THING##'\n* '##blue|CONSTRUCT##' (when referring to semantics)\n* '##blue|CHALLENGE##' (when referring to containment)\n* '##blue|INFLUENCE##' (when referring to potential disruption)\n* '##blue|VOLATILITY##' (when referring to immediate risk)\n* '##blue|HAZARD##', '##blue|HAZARD COMPLEX##' (when referring to semiontological phenomena)\n* [##green|RESTRICTED## //PER PROTOCOL [*/taboo 4000-ESHU]//][[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]**##red|FORBIDDEN##**[[/span]] (when referring to narrative and/or pataphysical elements)\n* '##blue|ISSUE##' (when referring to difficulty)[[span class=\"fnnum\"]].[[/span]][[span class=\"fncon\"]]See **##green|ADDITION INTEGER-LETTER##**[[/span]]\n\n##green|SCP-INTEGER-DIGIT## is the designation for ##green|THINGS##, including both ##green|ITEMS## and ##green|BEINGS##, that have served as a medium of communication for an incorrect designation or classification of ##blue|SCP-INTEGER##.
