I have read of him in the Gita. The revelation surprised me somewhat; Vishnu is often described as nigh-alien in appearance, but the entity that guides me seems like a man. But I learned not to question it; he is a god, and gods appear as they please. His appearance is irrelevant. I feel his power, his love, his wisdom. Being near him is like entering a warm home, after walking in the snow. Indeed, his wisdom stands in stark contrast to the ignorance of the world.[[/size]]\n@@ @@\n[[size 125%]]His words are soothing, and happy. I have never felt more inspired than when Vishnu speaks to me. My mind expands tenfold. I see the infinite capacity of science, but I see the even further knowledge of what is beyond.
