The epicenter of ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## infection in our reality, SCP-##22a400|**VATHEK**##, has been placed in a hermetically sealed, lead-lined containment cell at the center of the facility. \n\nAll personnel at the facility are to undergo twice-daily pasteurized lemon juice baths to test for contamination. Any subject found to even partially be contaminated with ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## is to be summarily terminated, and their bodies are to be contained in the same manner of ##22a400|**VATHEK**##.\n\n**Description:** ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## refers to a predatory, pluripotent consciousness that uses all ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A as its collective body. While ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## could hypothetically thrive as a single ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A, it seeks to create as many new instances of ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A as possible.\n\n##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A is a zooid[[footnote]](Mundane zooids are individual multicellular organisms that act as one modular part of a single animal, i.e. the various sections of a Portuguese man o' war. Whether or not ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A's bodies contain cells is not yet known.)[[/footnote]] of ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##. It is capable of changing its shape, color, size, mass, and texture at ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##'s will. The extent of this ability is not known. In its original form, a ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A takes the appearance of a white nematode, 1 cm in length.\n\nWithout sustenance, a single ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A is only able to exist for two hours after birth, after which its body calcifies in a similar manner to coral.\n\nA ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A reproduces through physical contact with solids or liquids, replacing what it touches with a copy of itself over the course of three hours. The matter copied is absorbed as the original ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A's food source. \n\nAdditionally, a ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A assimilates information about whatever it has consumed.\n\nThere are only two known means to destroy a ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A: starvation, and to scald it with acidic liquid heated to a boiling point. The pH of this liquid must be 3 or lower, i.e. lemon juice. Acids at lower temperatures aren't able to harm a ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A, though it causes them intolerable pain and forcibly separates colonial ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A structures from one another. \n\nThough there is no way to stop the flesh-replacement process once started, a living host being consumed by ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A can slow the transformation by consuming large quantities of lemons and lemon juice. \n\n##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A colonies use their ability to assimilate and imitate matter to infiltrate biomes for reproduction and sustenance. Organic, inorganic, liquid matter can be consumed, with the only real exceptions appearing to be acids, gases, and calcium carbonate.\n\nAccording to ##22a400|**VATHEK**##, entire planets can and have been consumed by ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## in this manner. SCP-8702[[footnote]](The cavernous environment inside SCP-8702 was likely due to ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A running out of sustenance, and the movement of the cave floor and ceiling was the work of still-living ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A within the rock walls.)[[/footnote]] was one such iteration of Earth that had been consumed in an NK-class \"Grey Goo\" scenario. \n\nThe plethora of information consumed by ##cc0000|**THESEUS**##-A is used as one of many means for ##cc0000|**THESEUS**## to tempt uninfected organisms into cooperation with its plans.\n\n------\n\n++++ Addendum - SCP-##22a400|**VATHEK**##\n\nOn 4/29/2043, two months after ##22a400|**VATHEK**##'s containment, his body was found to be completely calcified in his reinforced cell. Using his keyboard, he left behind the following document.\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 5px #22a400; background:#FFFFFF; padding:15px; margin-bottom: 10px; margin-top: 10px;\"]]\nNever thought I could keep a job long enough to write some big, drippy letter of resignation, but here we are. \n\nDon't worry too much about finding my replacement; something tells me that everyone else on the planet is about to be a candidate for the new Vathek. \n\nLong story short, Theseus is seriously pissed off at me about the swimming pool incident -- and I'm honestly not too surprised that he is -- so he's decided he's going to order the worms in my body to kill themselves one at a time.\n\nAnd since there's no longer any flesh in my body that hasn't been replaced with worms... yeah.\n\nEverything below my waist is a bleached coral statue of my lower body. (At least I was in a sitting position when it started so I could still write this.) It doesn't hurt. I haven't experienced real pain in a long time. I mean, the lemon juice hurt, but that was the worms feeling bad, not my body -- like my whole body is someone else's.\n\nNow that I think about that, that's a lie. I //have// felt pain, just not in a way I can understand. It's like...\n\nWhen my uncle was a kid, he lost his right hand. He tried to clench his fist over a firecracker to keep it from exploding. Y'know, typical dumb kid shit. And for a long time after that, even when he grew up, there were days when his missing right hand still hurt, even though it wasn't there anymore.\n\nI think I'm feeling //that//, but for my whole body. Some nights, the pain's so intense that it keeps me from sleeping. But I've been feeling it for so long that I didn't even think to mention it at first.\n\nGod fucking damn you, Theseus.\n\n...\n\nMy hands are gonna go full statue within the hour. Typing with my nose is what a bird would do. I'm not a fucking bird. I'm not about to spend my last moments looking like that pigeon that shows up for like half a second in the //Ren & Stimpy// intro. \n\nSo let's get a few things out of the way before I lose my hands. \n\nConsider this your last Oracle Event. And it's got the one piece of forbidden knowledge I've kept hidden from you all this time...\n\nThis is all my fault.\n\nLike, obviously I didn't //plan// to turn into a fucking me-shaped stack of worms. But the day I lost my left arm, when I lost consciousness -- before I woke up again, I saw Theseus. The //real// Theseus. \n\nIt was in a dream. I was naked, floating through the darkness of space. There was this bright, white moon below me. And when I landed, the moon's surface sprouted a fluffy feather bed to catch me. \n\nEverything about this moon could change. But the texture was dusty -- there was this white desert full of flowing dunes of the same white powder that comes off me. \n\nThis moon was a representation of all the Theseus worms at once, gathered together in the same place. Maybe this was the first incarnation of Theseus. Who fucking knows.\n\nIt's hard to describe. Maybe I can oh Jesus fuck not this bullshit aga**{{AND THESEUS SPAKE UNTO ME: \"JAMES.
