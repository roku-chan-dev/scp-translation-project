If non-Foundation individuals attempt to use SCP-1100-KO, it is strongly recommended to dissuade such behaviour while providing sufficient reasons. However, information that can compromise the integrity of the veil policy, such as the Containment Procedures for SCP-1100-KO, or the possible threat caused by the item, must not be mentioned. The same rule applies to non-Foundation organisations that try to utilise SCP-1100-KO, and personnel must provide sufficient reasoning, excluding confidential information, which includes this document.\n\n**Description:** SCP-1100-KO is known as the Infinite Monkey Theorem to the public. The theorem is not anomalous by itself, and this document does not differ from any publicly available description. However, due to the potential threat that unrestricted, public usage of SCP-1100-KO may cause, the containment procedures mentioned above were established.\n\n##skyblue|Random text strings generated by SCP-1100-KO could match anomalous text strings that may have been contained by the Foundation. Id est, SCP-1100-KO is completely non-anomalous, but it is theoretically possible to produce an anomalous SCP object using it, which can cause a containment breach or, even worse, a breach in the veil policy.##\n\n##skyblue|To make matters worse, SCP-1100-KO is widely known to the public. Even if one is oblivious to the designation SCP-1100-KO or the more widely known name of the Infinite Monkey Theorem, it is intuitive to anyone with the most rudimentary knowledge about infinity. Therefore, complete containment of SCP-1100-KO is currently impossible. The Containment Procedures above result from an effort to minimise the use of SCP-1100-KO despite the circumstance.##\n\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-1100-ko/offset/2 Additional information limited for current security clearance.]",
