[!-- Always start with AO- --]\n\n**Threat:** None. [!-- None, Benign, Irascible, Enraged --]\n\n**Classifications:** Botanical, Archaeological, Thaumaturgic, Metallurgy, Artefact. [!-- Brief descriptions of anomaly --]\n\n**Stored:** Dome 02, Hall 08, Site-Red. - //Note: wild cases remain under monthly observation.// [!-- Where is the anomaly kept or located --]\n\n**Identifiers:** Anomaly is outwardly identical to members of the Alnus Glutinosa species, with the biggest height recorded at 33 yards. The species are identifiable by their colouration and material properties. The wood of the tree is of a tainted, metallic grey colour, not unlike tarnished silver, whilst its leaves and catkins are pigmented a deep, russet red. [!-- How does the anomaly usually look --]\n\n**Abnormality:** Observations by botanists and horticulturalists have found that whilst the species' cellular structure is nearly comparable to other members of the Alnus genus, this species possesses a high quantity of iron and silver particles within its structure, especially in the wood of the plant. This is believed to be why the species possess a metallic pigment and the leaves have a red hue. As silver is not an element abundant in soil, it has been theorised that the species can perform an alchemical process to transmute metals within the soil into silver.\n\nWithin the structure of the plant, the iron and silver particles form an alloy that is currently impossible to replicate. This alloy is a natural deterrent to thaumic workings, being capable of disrupting and blocking all forms of theurgy within its presence. Whilst this property has also been seen in iron and silver, the alloy formed within the plant can prove a much greater counter-effect than the two elements. This property is found throughout the anomaly's makeup, including the leaves, catkins and sap. This disruptive property will continue even if materials are removed from the main body, though the range and strength of this property will weaken as the sample ages. [!-- How does the anomaly usually behave and what makes this unusual --]\n\n**History:** The species' existence is not widely known outside of cryptobotany and thaumaturgical circles. This has been theorised to be because of the anomaly's rarity within the botanical world. However, some researchers have theorised that the species' existence may have been remembered in pieces of Eurasia superstitions and folklore. The Northern European area is especially rich in beliefs surrounding iron, silver and the Alnus family, all of which relate to their abilities to deter unwanted or harmful magic and beasts. Further research into the anomaly's cultural history is ongoing.\n\nHer Majesty's Foundation became aware of the anomaly in 1846, during a Marshall, Carter and Dark auction, where cuttings were auctioned off. Successfully purchasing the cuttings, investigators were able to trace their source to that of the famed horticulturist and occultist, Joseph Merit. According to Merit, he and several of his colleagues in the cryptobotany circles had recently been able to domesticate the species successfully and were already receiving requests from businesses for cuttings and timber for use in industry. Her Majesty's Foundation purchased all of Merit's domesticated samples, as well as his studies of the species biology. See their attached paper for details. [!-- How did the anomaly come under the control of HMFSCP --]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Oranienbaum';color: #000000; font-size: 20pt\"]]**The Armoured Forests**\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Oranienbaum';color: #000000; font-size: 16pt\"]]A Summary of the Botany of //Alnus argentum//\n[[/span]][[span style=\"font-family: 'Oranienbaum';color: #000000; font-size: 12pt\"]]By Joseph Weatherbee Merit\n[[/span]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Oranienbaum';color: #000000\"]]In the world of elusive botany and strange mycology, there are several rare specimens considered famed. The lightning-generating //Phiotacea electrica//, the vile //[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-679|Aspergillus ocularis]]]//, and the carnivorous //Crinoida dajeeana//. But none compare to that of the //Alnus argentum//, the //Silver Alder//, a tree truly worthy of the description of mythical.\n------\n= **Distribution**\n\nAt face value, //A. argentum// is very much like the rest of the //Alnus// genus, with //A. glutinosa//, the //Black Alder//, believed to be its closest relative. This is evident by both //A. argentum's// phytomorphology and habitat, as the species looks and grows in similar structures and has only been seen growing in northern and western Europe. Like //A. glutinosa//, //A. argentum// grows in the moist ground near rivers, ponds, lakes or areas of nutrient-poor soil.\n\nThe first characteristic rendering the species unique in its genus regards //A. argentum's// method of germination and colonisation. All members of the //Alnus// genus function as pioneer species; resilient plants that are the first to colonise new and disturbed environments and assist in the repopulation of other species. Where //A. argentum's// works differently in what type of ecosystem it pioneers in.\n\nCompared to other member of its genus, //A. argentum// has difficulty germinating against its competitors, even in environments plentiful in nitrogen and water. However, due to developing a body rich in iron and silver, when present in environments exposed to powerful or constant mysticism and theurgy, the species gains the upper hand. In areas which had been exposed, many species of flora often find it difficult to adjust and reproduce to the imbalanced ecosystem. Because of the metal within its body, //A. argentum// can shield itself from mystical effects, redirecting it away from itself and back at its contenders. This continues as the body grows, which it does very quickly, gaining a meter almost every month. As it spreads around, the theurgy is forced into a more ordered state, allowing newer species to be introduced without threat.\n\nAs the ecosystem grows, as with most //Alnus// species, //A. argentum// will typically settle in thickets at the edges of forests or near sources of water. However, it has been noted that these thickets tend to form in a formation of sorts. If drafted on a map, a straight alignment can be illustrated between thickets. Coincidentally, these lines also align with nearby holy or historical landmarks. It is the belief of //Reverend Edward Duke// these lines are examples of his \"//holy leylines//\" hypothesis, with the trees acting as a kind of pillar in the lines network.\n[[/span]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 306 (A):** Cultural History\n\nThrough the investigations carried out by Intelligence and Observation operatives, Her Majesty's Foundation made several discoveries regarding AO-306's historical significance in various cultures in the known world. A summary is written below.\n\n-----\n\n**The Kingdom of Hy-Brasil:** To the Tuatha Dé Danann, the flora, known as the \"//An Plionta Airgid//\", meaning \"The Silver Plinth\", is considered both a hindrance and a help. Due to their biology, the fibres of the anomaly are a moderate irritant to their flesh and are dangerous, if not deadly, if exposed to them for too long. Despite this, the Tuatha use the tree as a form of defence, growing them around locations of importance for further security against thaumaturgical attacks or beings such as Aos Sí, [[[SCP-3456|Nuckelavee]]] or [[[anomaly-243-the-neamh-mairbh|Neamh-Mairbh]]]. Some blacksmith would go further and use logs of the tree to shape their blades, as the metal particles within the wood would react with the forged metal to form a thin layer. This weakness and application have propagated a superstition, with many of the Tuatha still considering the plant an omen of bad luck or danger and will actively avoid interacting with samples if encountered in the wild.\n\n**The Daevite Empire:** As horticulture, occultism and plant life were an essential commodity in Daevite culture, Daeva viewed AO-306 as nothing more than a problematic weed, referring to them as the \"//Vihe Tinhezuke//\", meaning \"The Tarnished Desolation\" in [[[old-daevite-language|Old Daevite]]]. Likely due to the anomaly's ecology and accelerated growth, the Daeva often had trouble managing the plant's spread, with some of their passages referencing great fires set to destroy the anomaly to prevent famines from breaking out.\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n\nThe Tarnished Desolation, a threat great, going unwitnessed until too late and once bloomed, spreading sickness with every touch. Many of our [[[SCP-5297|fruit]]] and [[[SCP-3140|armies]]] have rotted in their roots and whole colonies of [[[scp-5280|maidens]]] have died within its pollen. Our farms and gardens are our life. Our food. Our way. Such threats are not taken lightly, but as its wood is poisonous to our flesh, only the harshest of flames must be used to vanquish its foul reach.\n[[>]]\n- [[[SCP-140|A Chronicle of the Daevas]]]\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**The Church of the Broken God:** As the Alder family prefer damp, cool climates, the anomaly is rarely seen in South Europe and West Asia. However, according to representatives of the Church of the Broken God, their order's predecessor, the [[[SCP-2406|Followers of Mekhane]]], considered the anomaly proof of their God's divine influence, having grown from His broken body to aid humanity in its early development. According to some archaeological digs, many followers offered valuable trade or made pilgrimages to the northwest territory just for a single piece of its bark.\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\n21. And with their might did God cleave His Enemies. But battle had rendered God tried. His Anvil, His Stylus, His Hammer, His Form. All broken.\n22. Broken, and tried, God was claimed by the Earth, Skies and Seas, His Body spread among the lands. Lost.\n23. Lost. But not powerless.\n24. His Form, though broken, remained strong. His [[[SCP-217|Ichor]]], though diluted, remained flowing.\n25. And from these, and the rich soils of Earth, did spring new form. Forms in the shape of gifts.\n26. //\"Here me,\"// cried God, //\"Though broken, I remain strong. Though broken, my love prevails. Though broken, I shall still defend you.\"//\n27. //\"Take my new Form. My strength remains within it. My might stored in its body. Take it and build. Build and forge. Build, for I shall be with you again.\"//\n28. And so the people built and made, and grew strong. In strength, the found power.\n29. Power to fight the beasts that plagued them. The vile Flesh. The accursed Daeva. The guileful Kobaloi.\n30. With God, they found strength. With God, they grew.\n[[>]]\n- Book of Forge, Chapter 2\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n**Insular Celts:** Despite little being known of the ancient Celts' workings and lifestyle, surviving pieces of evidence recovered from archaeological digs at Brythonic and Pict sites have suggested that AO-306 played a significant role in their life. Several pieces, mostly armour, jewellery and weapons, have been identified as being created from the anomaly's wood, implying that the tribes were skilled in both cultivating and utilising the anomaly. Furthermore, analysis of woad dye found in digs has identified samples of resinous gum taken from the plant and mixed into the dye, possibly suggesting attempts were made to incorporate the anomaly's thaumaturgical deterring effect into their clothing and war paint. Whilst the Brythonics and Picts appeared to have habitually used the plant, the same cannot be said for the Gaels, though this can be likely due to the influence of the Tuatha and their view on the plant. However, AO-306 appears to have contributed to many pieces of Celtic mythology and folklore, symbolising the mysterious Otherworld, where it is believed to have come from.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 306 (B):** Studies\n\nA report written by metallurgist, Jonas Thorn, and biologist, Monty T. Howards, on the chemistry of AO-306.\n-----\n\n**Experiment:** Reverse Engineering Samples of AO-306\n\n**Results:** //Through our study of the species, we have determined several key properties that illuminate both its chemical and physical capabilities.//\n\n//When dried, like most woods, the wood of the anomaly becomes much stronger, harder and more durable. However, in the case of AO-306, the strength and durability of the wood exceed what ordinary wood should be capable of achieving. Our material analysis found the wood of AO-306 to possess a compressive strength of 15,000 psi and a bending strength of 21,000 psi, rivalling that of the Acacia genus' wood.//\n\n//Knowing the durability of common alder wood hardened when introduced to water, we submersed several samples of AO-306 to observe if a similar effect occurred. To our surprise, we discovered if the wood is treated in water, the process of strengthening not only accelerates but results in an even stronger timber. Material analysis found the wood possessed a compressive strength of 41,000 psi and a bending strength of 63,000 psi, comparable to that of steel. When observed under a microscope, the fibres of the wood are found to have developed a metallic coating. We have yet to identify why this is occurring.//\n\n//Further chemical analysis of the wood, both before treatment and after, has identified that, whilst durable, it is still flammable, though it appears to be somewhat resistant to ignition, and burns with a golden flame with a green heart. It has also been determined to be nontoxic and safe to handle. Thaumaturgical analysis has also found that the anomaly's disrupting effect is greatly enhanced if the wood is treated with water. This may be due to the more structured form the metals take when exposed to moisture.//\n\n[[>]]\n-  **Monty T. Howards**\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 306 (C):** Archaeological Findings\n\nA report written by archaeologist, August Leonerd, and biologist, Monty T. Howards, on the discovery of several artefacts relating to AO-306, found at the Dozmaré Pool, Cornwall.\n\n-----\n\n//The grove at the pool was unusual. In most cases, we've come across AO-306 growing in relatively large numbers, twenty or so. Here, there were only four, and rather than growing on the banks, all were growing from the lake bed. Furthermore, the grove does not reside on any of the \"holy lines\" our cartographers and dowsers mapped out. Either this grove has been created artificially or the force in the area has long since faded away, implying this patch of AO-306 is one of the oldest on record.//\n\n//Regardless, such an unusual location warranted further investigation, leading to our discovery. Entangled within the roots of the anomalies were several water-damaged metallic artefacts, encasing the skeletal remains of a believed adult male. Though the roots of the anomaly made it somewhat difficult, we managed to remove the remains unscathed.//\n\n//Inspection of the body did not provide any substantial information about its origin or reasons for its location. However, we noticed the body was in a fetal position while buried. The bones appeared to have experienced a significant impact on the chest and abdomen, mostly likely from a projectile or bladed weapon. A majority of the artefacts, including those worn by the body, were found to have been pieces of armour, most of which were damaged seemingly by incendiary or chemical devices. Strangely, many of these pieces possessed intricate mechanics, such as rudimentary clockwork or pneumatics. In the cases of the body, some of the mechanics within the armour were found attached to the bone, specifically those of the arm and shoulder. Based on design and evidence from other archaeological findings, we believe them to be of 5th-century origin.//\n\n//Outside of this, the only other item that was recovered was the remains of a [[[scp-2307|long sword]]], which was found clasped within the body's hands. This sword itself is quite unusual. Though it was recovered slightly damaged due to the lake's water, it has been \"regenerating\" since its recovery, shedding rust and \"growing\" metal as time goes on. Curiously, this regeneration accelerates when in contact with a piece of AO-306. Due to this property, I have had the item posted to Site-Red for further examination and possible designation.//\n\n//Though the design of the artefacts, including the sword, was not unusual, the composure is somewhat similar to those we discovered in Celtic sites and made by Tuatha blacksmiths, though these artefacts appear to be of a more refined make. And after getting the metallurgist and dowsers to have a look at it, I can confirm my theory. The artefacts, armour and sword, are constructed from the same material found within AO-306, a silver-rich steel, and in this case, of rather high purity.//\n\n//This leaves us with two interesting mysteries. The first is the manufacturing of the alloy. Given the earliest known method of mass-producing steel was recorded in 11th-century China, it is highly unusual to find a similar material being produced and used centuries early, in a society nowhere near capable of producing such materials. Who made this material? How? Why is it so pure? The clockworks and pneumatics also further confuse things, with neither being crafted in such condition, even in the modern day.//\n\n//Secondly, why was the body there in the first place? Given the location, the wounds and the layout of the body, it is unlikely this was an intentional burial. However, when we discovered it, the body was surrounded by various pieces of armour, as if entombed. Moreover, a grove of AO-306 was growing directly above the remains. Why? Given the fact the sword was within the body's possession and its anomalous properties, along with the condition the body was found in, I am inclined to theorise that this burial was spontaneous, possibly self-imposed, with the intention of either protecting the sword from something or protecting something from the sword.//\n\n[[>]]\n-  **August Leonerd**\n[[/>]]\n-----\n\nThe sword recovered at the site was given the designation AO-237 and stored at Site-Red, three weeks following its discovery by Howard and Leonerd. Further examinations of the item are pending.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n[[=]]\n**Proposal: Request the right to outsource the production of Compound 113 (\"Alderwood Iron\") for the creation of arms to be used in imminent conflicts.**\n[[/=]]\n-----\n\nAs you gentlemen of the Operations Council are aware, there has been a continual growth in the use of anomalous weaponry in warfare in the past decade. You will recall the Russian forces' use of Sarkic cytomancy in Crimea, the temporal slips of the Battle of Khushab and the loss of the Kowloon Peninsula. Furthermore, we have seen a growing number of cases, both nationally and internationally, of blacklisted occult trade, either through black markets or corrupted government sectors. We have already had reports from our allies in the States, the American Secure Containment Initiative, of the Confederates use of Kabbalah clay for the manufacture of [[[SCP-011|artificial soldiers]]]. Our organisation is trying its hardest to mitigate and contain these issues, however, resources remain sparse. And with the likelihood of another full-scale war occurring within the next decade, we must find new ways of continuing our cause.\n\nYou will be aware of Jonas Thorn's recent developments in alchemical practices thanks to his study of AO-237, Hy-Brasil's \"Cold Iron\" manufacture and his successful incorporation of Mekanite metallurgy and Brand alchemy with the modern Bessemer process. You may also be aware of our numerous discoveries concerning AO-306, specifically its application within thaumic workings when refined to Compound 113 (\"Alderwood Iron\"). Given the growing threat and looming issues, it is, for this reason, that we request our organisation look into the possibility of producing Compound 113 for its use in furthering our subbasement of anomalous activity, as well as its use in manufacturing arms for the upcoming conflict.\n\nCompound 113 has already shown it possesses all the practicalities of steel, as well as the ability to negate and redirect thaumic workings, be it occult or theurgy. You will recall the tomb uncovered by August Leonerd a few months ago. The process of its production //(**Procedure 306-113-G:** Bessemer-Thorn Argyropoeia)//, is also not overly expensive, with the only financial issue coming from the need to introduce copper into the manufacturing to undergo the required argyropoeia. Whilst this could prove a problem if we were to request a local steelworks such as Dowlais or Scunthorpe to produce the compound, this would not be the case in America. A newly established ironworks, under the ownership of Anderson Factories, has been established in Pennsylvania, and given the rise of the northern Michigan copper district, they would be able to suit our demands easily.\n[[>]]\n\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left;\"]]\n+++++ - Ishmael Cabot  \n++++++ Head Military Operative\n++++++ United Kingdom Branch\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n+++++ - Nathanial Henry\n++++++ Head Intelligence Operative\n++++++ United Kingdom Branch\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n+++++ - Paul Farr\n++++++ Deputy Head Science Operative\n++++++ United Kingdom Branch\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/>]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 60%]]DO NOT WRITE BELOW THIS LINE, OFFICIAL USE ONLY.[[/size]]\n-----\n+++ //##navy|Proposal approved.##//\n+++ //- ##navy|Chamberlains 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.##//\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div_ class=\"newspaper-border\"]]\n[[div_ class=\"newspaper-main\"]]\n[[size 570%]]**THE FLEET GAZETTE**[[/size]]\n[[div_ class=\"newspaper-body\"]]\n[[div class=\"unmargined\" style=\"border-top-style: solid; border-bottom-style: solid;\"]]\n[[table style=\"width: 100%;\"]]\n[[row]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: left;\"]]\n[[size 200%]]**Vol, XCII No. CLXXII**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: center;\"]]\n[[size 200%]]**FEBURARY 13TH, 1866**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[cell style=\"text-align: right;\"]]\n[[size 200%]]**ONE HALFPENNY**[[/size]]\n[[/cell]]\n[[/row]]\n[[/table]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div_ class=\"newspaper-body\"]]\n[[div class=\"twopanel\"]]\n[[div class=\"bit\"]]\n[[size 150%]]**ANDERSON FACTORY REVOLT! COORDINATED ATTACK RESULTS IN THE DEATH OF HUNDREDS.**[[/size]]\n------\n[[size 150%]]**ONLOOKERS CLAIM WITNESSING GHOSTS AND DEMONS FIGHTING IN THE FIRE ABOVE PENNSYLVANIA.**[[/size]]\n------\n[[div style=\"text-align: justify\"]]\n[[size 150%]]O[[/size]]n the 23rd of May, a coordinated attack was carried out on several of Anderson Factories facilities. In the late hours of the night, explosions and gunfire rang out as conflict erupted between the employees and the invading force, whose goal and organisation are yet to be revealed.\n\nAnderson Factories, colloquially referred to as [[[system:page-tags/tag/factory|The Factory]]], were located across the Eastern United States. Under the ownership of James Anderson, the notorious engineer and businessman, Anderson Factories produced everything from fabrics to mechanics, to foods, to papers, to artillery. Born in Oxford, England to arms dealer, Charles Anderson, Anderson emigrated to the United States in 1834, and successfully established his first factory in Massachusetts in 1835 at the age of 20.\n\nTaking advantage of the state's growing industrial proficiency and immigration, Anderson's factory soon became a powerhouse in the heavy industry market, helped by the experimental nature of his facilities layout, in which accommodations for workers were provided. By 1843, Anderson had established a small empire for himself, spanning eleven facilities.\n\n[[image James.jpg style=\"width:100%;\"link=#]]\n\nOver the next 10 years, Anderson's industry remain prosperous, until the California gold rush. Though initially reactive, establishing a further three facilities on the West Coast, the strain of industry began to take its toll on Anderson. Further upheaval such as political tensions, embezzlement, westward migration, and an outbreak of consumption sent him into a further depression. This pressure is said to be the cause of Anderson's change in behaviour and tactics, with many reporting a definite change in his consideration for safety and work ethic. Some even claim Anderson was dabbling with occult forces and demonic beasts. Whether these rumours were true or not remains unknown, though, despite employment rates for Anderson's Factories growing low, production remained unusually high, even with the arrival of the American Civil War, where he went on to produce weapons for both Union and Confederate armies.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"bit\"]]\n[[div style=\"text-align: justify\"]]\n[[image https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Bethlehem_Steel_Pennellb.jpg style=\"width:100%;\"link=#]]\n[[size 150%]]L[[/size]]ate on the night of the 23rd, Anderson Factory's Pennsylvania Steelworks and Heavy Industry plant experienced a full frontal attack. The facility, headquartered outside Easton, Pennsylvania near the banks of the Lehigh River, erupted into a frenzy when several unknown individuals attacked the main steelworks facility, destroying much of the machinery and equipment. By the time local authorities arrived at the scene, the facility had erupted into flames, with a lake of molten metal flowing from the facility.\n\nAs a result of the attack, only seventeen of the ninety-eight workers survived. When our journalists attempted to interview said survivors on the events of the attack and the identity of the attackers, however, most failed to prove any substantial information, with many still under medical supervision. \"//Confederate rioters//,\" according to Sheriff Lovelock of the Easton Police Department, \"//Anderson's been dealing with them ever since Robert surrendered Virginia. So many of the miners blame him, you see for what he did, and who he helped. Some folk just can't let go of the past. They'd rather hold on to a grudge.//\"\n\nDespite the police department's claims, local opinions differ. According to some eyewitnesses, there had been several unusual incidents before the attack, such as sudden illnesses, missing people and the loss of shipments from the nearby mines. In addition, several people confirm that a few days before the attack, several soldiers from the U.S. Army, as well as members of the Pinkerton National Detective Agency reported to the facility, claiming their reason for their arrival was to assess the new artillery manufactured at the facility. However, the local word says otherwise.\n\n\"//This wasn't a random attack,//\" says Mary Kidds, \"//this was justice. Something was happening at that factory and it wasn't some fancy bullets. You know they have gardens in there? Why would a factory that makes steel need gardens? And why can't the staff leave? There's something unholy about that place. Something secret. It's punishment, I say. Punishment for the sins of Anderson.//\" Journalists attempted to interview the U.S. Army about the visit, though they refused to comment.\n\nDespite survivors being unable to remember the ordeal and the authority remaining quiet, accounts from onlookers have revealed some striking details regarding the night. Bobby Bulter, a coachman in Easton, came forward regarding what he witnessed during the night of the attack. \"//I was just riding along, having just dropped off the last night's owls, when my horse was all stiff and panicked. Right outside the forest, near the river bank. He just stood there, refusing to move. Tried everything but he wouldn't go. But then I heard it. This shrill whistling, coming from the woods. Like a sharp wind. I didn't like it.//\"\n\n\"//Then something moved, above us. Quick it was. Didn't make it out in the dark, but I knew something was there. Now and again, something would shoot past. Never saw them but I heard them. Maybe a strange windy sound, like when knife swishing in the air. The horse lost it then. Poor thing kept shaking and crying before it just ran off towards the town.//\"\n\n\"//When I reached the river bank, I saw the factory, on fire. Not a normal fire, though. It was gold, blue and green, and it moved like it was waves in the sea. There were screams too. These awful screams. Men begging and crying, but also other things. Like cats howling but shrill and long. I was about to run, but then the whole place blew up, metal flying everywhere. I ducked for cover and I saw this chuck of hot metal on the ground. In it was a body. Now I've fought in battles, and I've seen my fair share of horror, but this was sickening. It was all mangled, covered in this molten silver, its fat burning in a green flame. Something was wrong with it too. Its back was all twisted, with these jagged things pointing out like wings. Six wings. And it had these pointed ears, like some demon. I ran then. I know I should've helped but I won't be part of that. Anderson was making monsters in there. Making things from hell!//\"\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\" style=\"background-color: #f3cea1; text-color:black;\"]]\n= **[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 20pt\"]] American Secure Containment Initiative [[/span]]**\n[[>]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]] American Secure Containment\nInitiative's Office of\nInternational Diplomacy\nLocus 17\n███████████\nPennsylvania\nUnited States of America\n\nFeburary 27th, 1866[[/span]]\n[[/>]]\n[[<]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]] Her Majesty's Foundation\nfor the Secure Containment\nof the Paranormal's Administration\nDepartment\nSite-Blue\n█████\nYorkshire\nEngland[[/span]]\n[[/<]]\n\n------\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Monotype Corsiva';color: #000000; font-size: 14pt\"]] To the Chamberlains of Her Majesty's Foundation,\n\nThis letter comes to you in light of the numerous attacks our country has been receiving in recent months. You should already be aware of these attacks, as a good number of them have occurred at establishments where you have arms dealerships and engineering contracts. Given the current political climate, international conflict and pressure experienced by our organisation, you should understand that these interruptions are costing us. We have already had to carry out seven cleanup operations and nine misinformation campaigns just to prevent public discovery and government inquiry. Not only that, but these attacks are also costing us a great deal of resources. Many of the establishments lost produced goods vital for our country's businesses and corporations, including our organisation. The latest attack meant one of our most delicate procedures had to be put on hold.\n\nYou may also be aware of the rumour circulating about the type of people who are conducting these attacks. I would like to say that these rumours are nothing but the result of fantastical embellishments, but our morticians and agents, who have had to clean up your mess, know them to be gospel. These beings. Sourcery. Shapeshifting. Allergy to iron. These are not creatures who are easy to deal with, nor do they care for our kind's way of life. They are dangerous and powerful, and for whatever reason, your requests have angered them.\n\nTherefore, we have no choice but to cancel all current production this country is doing for your organisation as well as prohibit any future projects. We understand you made these requests because you too were facing issues related to the current conflict but we should not have to deal with the consequences of your solution. Should you wish to challenge this ban, your appeal will be dealt with by our lawyers after the current political climate is over.\n\nYours sincerely,\n[[/span]]\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]] Major Adolphus V.

At half-nine, the staff of Hall 08 were greeted by Brigadier Ab Ifan, who had previously thought to have gone missing along with his platoon, Force ξ, in action in German last year. Upon entry, staff were subdued by an unseen force, whilst 10 further individuals entered the hall. 9 were later recognised as former missing members of Force ξ, whilst the 10th identity remains unknown. After subduing and binding the staff, the attackers made their way through the halls, returning with several test samples of AO-306 and Compound 113. In addition, Ab Ifan retrieved AO-237. After this, the attackers left the site. Attempts were made by the staff of adjacent halls to subdue the attackers, though they were unsuccessful. All staff involved in the attack were unharmed.\n\n**Witness Statements:** //By the time I noticed something was wrong, it was already too late. Something grabbed me and held me down before I could reach for my baton. It must have been something invisible because Ifan kept talking to it. He told it, \"Kept them out of the way, they are not our enemies. They're not a part of this fight.\" We were bound and gagged quickly by the other members. I recognised one of them as Logan. He apologised for what they were doing. Said that this was necessary for their new mission. That's when I noticed the paint. All of them had this purple paint on their face and arms. Shaped into swirls and curves.//\n\n//They left us and went to the halls, taking all the test samples we'd made of the Silver Alder wood, sap and catkins, as well as the piece of Compound 113, and several documents. Whilst they moved, Ifan started talking with this brown-haired man I did not recognise. He was painted too but he wasn't dressed in our uniform. Instead, he wore this old armour, made of leather and chainmail, and had a long red cape. His hair was long and he wore a golden helmet. At some point, I think Ifan said his name. I think it was Arnold or Arthur. Maybe Asher. He and Ifan argued for a while before one of the men gave him AO-237. He cried when he held it and kissed its handle.//\n\n//As they left, the man with the golden helmet came to us and spoke. He said he was sorry. He said, \"This is for the future. Foretold by Embreis. We're sorry. Forgive us.\" That's when I noticed his arm. His left arm was all metal and shining. As if his skin was made of armour. After speaking to us, he left, taking Ifan and 237 with him. Nothing happened after that until someone from Hall 6 came and freed us.// - **Marvin Lucas, Security Officer**\n\n**Evidence:** Nobody was killed during the incident, leaving plenty of witnesses. The identities of all bar one were confirmed to be members of the missing Force ξ. During the investigation, seer Enlli Majors claimed a clairvoyant impact within the area, implying that the force experienced by the witnesses was the result of unseen spectral entities. Majors could not give a definitive answer on the number of entities present.\n\nFragments of the paint covering the attackers we found on some of the ropes used to bind personnel. When this paint was examined, it was found to be a mixture of woad dye and the sap of AO-306, not unlike the dye found by archaeologists at the Insular Celts sites.\n\nAccording to witness statements, the accompanying, crowned individual was known as \"Arthur\" and likely possessed some form of artificial, mechanical prosthetic. Some witnesses claimed, however, that when he spoke, they heard him communicate to them in French, Welsh and Gaelic, as well as English. His involvement with the attack has resulted in his addition to the Suspect list, designated Suspect 651.\n\n**Conclusion:** Since the attack, sightings of the group have been reported across Great Britain and Ireland, including around known anomalous sites and locations. Due to this, their hostile behaviour and their theft of AO-237, samples of Compound 113 and documents referring to Procedure 306-113-G, their arrest has been assigned to Force δ and priority level Yellow.\n\n[[>]]\n+++++ - Ashley Moore\n++++++ Observation Operative\n++++++ Communication Sector\n[[/>]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"document\"]]\n[[>]]\n[[image HMFSCP2.png style=\"width:10%;\"link=#]]\n[[/>]]\n-----\n**Manifest 306 (D) :** Suspect 651\n-----\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/King_Arthur_MET_DP158298.jpg |caption=Suspect 651, Arthur.

As of writing this document, it is yet unknown what the goal of //Arthur// or Force ξ is, though so far, they have not taken any offensive action against any other party. Instead, the majority of the sightings of //Arthur// have been around areas or locations of great historical importance in British culture. //Arthur// has also not been seen undertaking many anomalous actions either and usually presents himself as a public citizen.\n\nOnly two anomalous events relating to //Arthur// have been recorded by Her Majesty's Foundation. The first occurred off North Berwick, where holidaymakers witnessed //Arthur//, in full armour, walk towards the sea, before becoming engulfed by the [[[SCP-6916|waters]]]. Later visitations by Her Majesty's Foundation's theurgists and seers claimed there was a subsiding thaumic workings and clairvoyant impact in the region he'd supposedly vanished from.\n\nThe second event occurred near the ruins of the Dolaucothi Gold Mines, Carmarthenshire. In this case, //Arthur// was not only accompanied by two members of Force ξ, but also by three large dogs, all of whom possessed red-tipped ears. Upon subduing the caretakers, the party entered the mines and did not emerge until 3 hours later. At this point, the caretakers released themselves and alerted the authorities who arrived in time to see the party exit, though the authorities were unable to prevent the party from leaving. It is unknown what the party gained from the mines, though the area was later found to possess several anomalous properties and was passed on to Analytics for further investigation. After both of these visitations, Arthur appeared to gain improvements in physical condition.\n\nDespite usually witnessed with members of Force ξ, one report from Manchester claimed //Arthur// had been witnessed conversing with members of [[[SCP-1917|The New Ferrous Brotherhood]]], a small religious order known by Her Majesty's Foundation, whose practices share many principles with the Church of the Broken God. The context of the conversation was unknown, though during the time together, //Arthur// was seen exchanging samples of AO-306 with the order's leader, //[[[SCP-6917|Father Loom]]]//. A few days after this meeting, Force δ came under conflict with //Arthur// and Force ξ in Nottingham, though this time, they were joined by several members of various branches of the Church of the Broken God. In addition, the weaponry used by the group appeared to have improved in quality. AO-237 had also seemingly had to undergo an alteration in design and also displayed several, previously unknown, anomalous feats. These events have led to the conclusion both Force ξ and //Arthur// have allied with various sects of the Church of the Broken God.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"jotting\" style=\"background-color: #f3cea1; text-color:black;\"]]\n= **[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 20pt\"]] Incident Report 0111/1870[[/span]]**\n------\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]] **Note:** This report is only to be viewed by personnel assigned Level 4 clearance, who are part of the newly formed **Records, Archival, and Information Security Administration** (**RAISA**), and have received direct permission from O5-1.

It has since been redrafted to fit the current standard. [[/span]]\n------\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]]**Incident Report ID #:** 71f6\n\n**Summary:** Incident 71f6 occurred within the Yorkshire Dales, North England, from the 31st of October to the 1st of November, 1970. Lasting approximately 6 hours, the incident concluded with 130 sq. km of the region undergoing a sudden geological and ecological alteration.\n\nThe incident is believed to have started at approximately 2100 hours, which is when police in the village of Newsham received a report from locals claiming they heard screaming and shouting coming from the forest. Three officers were dispatched but found that any attempt at entering the forest would result in the individual failing unconscious, only regaining it once they'd been removed from the area. At the same time, a similar event occurred near the town of Richmond and the village of Langthwaite. Upon recovery, through the use of ropes and hooks, the individuals should signs of memory loss, having forgotten certain details regarding themselves and others. They also consistently claimed that they were being watched or hearing faint whispers. One officer exited the area sporting deep cuts in their left arm.\n\nUnable to understand the situation, Darlington's chief of police contacted GoI-011-8 (**British Occult Service**), whose transmission GoI-ω-008 intercepted. Investigation personnel from Site-Blue were dispatched, who arrived at the area at around 2330 hours. After confirming with their superiors, the two groups agreed to work together to monitor the area, which was discovered to be around 13 km in diameter. During their investigations, many personnel reported feeling uneasy, with some claiming they were being touched by an unseen individual or that humanoid shapes were moving in the shadows of the forests.\n\nSounds and voices continued to be heard coming from the area, though no attempt to communicate with the speakers was successful. Sounds included the crushing of wood and plant matter, fires burning, metal straining or creaking, humans and unknown animals screaming or shouting, and the occasional explosion. Occasionally, vocalisation could also be heard, though most was either do distant to properly understand or done through an unknown language. In addition to sounds, metallic items near the area underwent rapid corrosion and electrostatic charge.\n\nIn an attempt to understand the induced unconsciousness caused by the area, psychics Ryan Monk and Enlli Majors were asked to enter the area to gain any extrasensory information. The two did not fall unconscious upon entering the area, though both appeared to be experiencing moderate pain. The two provided the following statements:[[/span]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\nThere was nothing to begin with. Only pain. Then there came the fire. A snaking blaze that burnt with a golden colour. A whole forest burning. Above, there were creatures, dressed in thin fabric and jewels. Swift and lithe, with great wings that shimmered like glass. They were shouting in a language I couldn't understand. It seemed like they were repeating something. Like a rhyme or an incantation. Occasionally, lights would shoot from them or brambles would twist as they spoke. But nothing worked when the fire reached them. And when it burnt them, their flesh burnt a green flame.\n\nBut there were others. From the fire emerge men. Women too, but not as many. Pale men and women painted in purple swirls, wielding crude blades and shields. They were all soldiers, but dressed from different periods. I remember seeing King's Troop cavalry fighting alongside knights in armour and neolithic tribal men. Some were on foot but some were hovering. Like mist on a cold morning.\n\nThey fought. They fought and fought. And then there was just fire.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\nThere were visions. Two of them going round and round in my mind.\n\nFirst, it was raining. Not just water but ash too. It fell onto a ground barren of life, just cinders and mud. In the mud were these human-shaped things with petals on their backs. Their flesh was slipping and squeezing like wet clay. They were crying, begging and shouting. I don't know what they were saying but they kept saying a word repeatedly. //Gwynn//. As they begged, I saw another man, standing above them. He had petals too but had form. He wore fine silks and gold jewels and had a horned headpiece. He was so angry, it was almost tangible. As the things sank into the mud, he rose into the sky and vanished, shouting something. I think it was a swear.\n\nSecond was in the forest. A man with long hair and dressed in broken armour was kneeling by a large tree. A silver one. He held up his left hand, which was made of metal and withdrew a sword, which was glowing with shapes and symbols. As he held it, he started crying, whispering to it. The words were all different languages, but he did use English and French. He said, \"My lord, Mekhane. My teacher, Embreis. Hear my plea. Help me slay these beasts, these kobaloi. I beg you. Help me.\" Then from the forest came these figures. The people with petals. Many of them were stained with blood and glared. One stepped forward and threw a severed head at the man's feet. At the sight of it, the man held up his sword, drew blood with it and screamed, \"For my kingdom, my friends. I curse you.\" He then stabbed the tree. In the sky, a lightning bolt shot down and hit the tree, breaking the sword. The creatures all screamed as the lightning shot into them. And I swear I heard it speak. A voice came from the lightning, whispering one word. //\"[[[SCP-4000|Outis.]]]\"//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]]After a further 4 hours of unchanged activity, at around 0300 hours, staff reported the forests and the surrounding area were \"warping\", with sections of the forest seemingly vanishing and reappearing in rapid succession or distorting and altering in size. All on-hand psychics and thaumaturgists experienced great pain, with some experiencing nasal and ear haemorrhage. After around 10 minutes, a thundercloud quickly formed above the area. Second later, a lightning bolt struck the area, resulting in a flash of brilliant light. When the light had cleared, a whole affected area's forest and wildlife had vanished, leaving nothing but a muddy landscape. The only piece of wildlife remaining was a single instance of AO-306, though it had been badly burnt. [[/span]]\n------\n[[span style=\"font-family: 'Special Elite';color: #000000; font-size: 11pt\"]] **Forward:** Following the incident, the area was sectioned off and an agricultural blight cover story was created to ward off suspicious. A recultivation plan is currently underway. None of the anomalous effects that occurred during the incident have been reported occurring since. When studied, a moderate fissure was found within the AO-306, with the fissure's interior found to be a smooth steel.\n\nDuring the two organisations' excavation of the area, several bones, heavily charred and damaged, were discovered. Many of these bones were found to have enlarged Scapula, each with three joint appendages near the vertebral column. Fragments of a thin, flexible nacre-like, calcium-rich material were found attached to the joints. Furthermore, fragments of cloth, ceramic and metal were found on or near some of the bodies. A command item found was a GoI-ω-008 identification ring, many of which were identified to belong to members of Force ξ.\n\nWhilst performing the required disinformation campaign on the event, it found that documents were missing titles and names for landmarks that had been present in the area before its disappearance, with maps showing blank spaces where the area had previously been. In addition, when questioned, members of the public were also unable to recall the names of specific landmarks. Due to this, a mass documentation alteration campaign was required to be undertaken alongside the disinformation campaign. With the absorption of GoI-ω-008 into the Foundation, both campaigns were added to the ongoing assignment merger roster.

Once assessed, the area is to be purchased, closed off and registered on the country's Habitats and Species of Principal Importance roster. Once registered, the specimens are to be visited on a bi-monthly basis to check for any damages, vandalism or illnesses.\n\nA maximum of 4 instances of SoI-019 are kept at Site-44 for study and treatment purposes. The specimens are to be kept in a wetland ecosystem greenhouse in Sector 5. If research at the site requires thaumaturgy, theurgy or occult workings, it must be carried out at least 1 km away from SoI-019. As of this document's writing, the use of SoI-019's wood for manufacturing and production purposes is banned, as decreed by O5-12.\n\nCurrently, in line with the Dartmoor Agreement, members of GoI-004 (\"The Church of the Broken God\"), including all branches, may visit Foundation-registered areas containing SoI-019. All visitations must have at most 20 members and all visitations must be accompanied by at least 2 members of MTF Stigma-9 (\"Evolved from Naturally Occurring Gears, Levers and Pulleys\").\n\n**Due to further discoveries regarding SoI-019 and related anomalies, all special considerations are awaiting updates and transfer, along with all documentation relating to SoI, to the management of Project Caliburn.**\n\n------\n[[size 150%]]\n= **Description**\n[[/size]]\n\nSpecies of Interest 019 is the Alnus argentum, a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Northern and Western Europe. It thrives in wet locations such as rivers or marshes, or environments with high levels of thaumactivity. SoI-019's xylem cells are capable of performing an alchemical process known as //argyropoeia//, where it converts copper and iron absorbed from the soil into silver. It does this process whilst also performing another anomalous chemical process that produces thin lamina of steel around the xylem cells. The two procedures result in a lamina made of an alloy composed of iron, carbon and silver. This lamina surrounds the xylem, which results in the wood of SoI-019 appearing metallic and tarnished, with its leaves taking on a red hue due to high moisture and oxygen content. When cut and dried, the lamina reacts with the chemicals within the drying wood to bind together, forming a strong layered fibres within the wood, vastly increasing its durability and strength. It also results in SoI-019 acting as a natural thaumaturgical deterrent, as the alignment and composure of the lamina obstruct the surrounding Akiva Radiation flow.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"smallmodal\"]]\nOn 10/06/2000, during their scheduled visit to a registered SoI-019 area near Morpeth, England, researcher Eric Scarlett discovered a note, made from parchment paper and written in cursive, nailed to the instances of SoI-019. As no security videoing system was in place around the area, it is unknown who placed the note. No DNA was found on the note. It read the following:\n\n[[div class=\"papernote\"]]\n\nTo the Foundation,\n\nYou will know who I am. I know who you are and who you were. Before, in the days when your work was focused around this small island. You have grown stronger since then. I have, however, just grown weaker. I'm not sure I will be here much longer.\n\nWhen I was king, millennia before your time, my knights and my allies fought alongside me in a great war, against a powerful enemy, led by a hateful, wild king. The war lasted years and took many things. My wife, my friends, my kingdom, my beautiful son. In the end, even I was claimed, but not before I managed to subdue our enemy into a schism, diving them into tribes built on loathing and distrust. My people survived and some victory was achieved. I faced death with some peace.\n\nHowever, my sage and priests had known our victory would only be temporary. In the time to come, the wild king, blessed with long life, would bring his people together once more, along with monsters and traitors. Wishing for our victory, my sage placed me in a sleep, mere breaths away from death and my priests and remaining knights took my sword, to be hidden among their blessed flora and waters. Years later, I awoke amid another war, far greater than one I'd ever fought before. Knowing my quest, I found my sage's family and my priests' church and together, we weakened the wild king once again.\n\nI wish that could've been the true victory, but no. This was merely another pause. Another battle, one which will have a true victory, was yet to come. So yet again, I entered sleep, with my allies vowing to prepare.\n\nI have awoken once more. I know this to be the last time. I must be ready. We must be ready.\n\nThey are coming. And I do not know if we can win.\n\n[[/div]]\n\nTwo days following the discovery of this letter, an incident occurred in another registered SoI-019 area in Penicuik, Scotland, in which the entire grove of SoI-019 was burnt. By the time Foundation agents arrived, the specimens were destroyed. Nearby the grove, two deceased individuals were discovered. One was recognised as a GoI-004 paladin, who appeared to have died as a result of incineration and electrical discharge. The other was recognised as Jilly Adams, a member of the City of Edinburgh Council, whose autopsy confirmed she'd died from multiple organ failures. A small carved blade made out of a piece of SoI-019 wood was also found in her lower back. Whilst medical examination could not find how SoI-019 could have resulted in such a visceral, fatal reaction, genetic testing found that Jilly Adams had been an unregistered [[[SCP-6796]]] instance.\n\nLater examination of surrounding security footage found that during her journey to the area, Jilly Adam had been tailed by the GoI-004 paladin, along with another unknown male individual. Other footage in Edinburgh, set two hours after the death of Jilly Adam, saw this unknown male individual boarding a train to Inverness. Whilst boarding, the individual appeared to look towards the camera and gazed for 10 seconds. Whether this was deliberate or done as a means of messaging someone is unknown. For this footage, the Foundation were able to search their Persons of Interest record for similar individuals. Though no results could be found on the Foundation record, the SCiPNet flagged a similarity between the individual and a subject registered on GoI-ω-008's Suspect roster. The subject, Suspect 651, was added to the PoI roster and registered as PoI-4918.\n\nSince the incident, a further 5 registered SoI-019 areas have been attacked, with almost all specimens being destroyed in the process. An increase in SoI-019's security is currently pending approval. No further sightings of PoI-4918 have been confirmed.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/King_Arthur_MET_DP158298.jpg\n> **Name:** King Arthur\n> **Author:** Julia Margaret Cameron\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:**\n=====\n> **Filename:** https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f8/Bethlehem_Steel_Pennellb.jpg\n> **Name:** Bethlehem Steel works, \"Watercolor in sepia brown, white and gray, on buff paper.
