Since it is a prototype, it does not possess any clear armament in its design. However, according to Prometheus' internal documents, the primary intended use was as a weapon.\n\nDue to the rapid growth of the paratech industry during the Cold War, automatons were attracting attention as a labor force in various industries such as the military, manufacturing, and services. The development of general-purpose humanoid automata intensified, and in later years Anderson Robotics' high-performance small humanoids, \"[[[scp-1360|Peregrine]]]\" and \"[[[no-matter-what-mask-you-wear|Saker Series Android]]]\" were becoming popular, and miniaturization was becoming mainstream.\n\nPrometheus Mechanics took the route of designing giant aircraft as their niche in the industry. During this process, the Hephaestus model series was developed. Among them, the latest was the RX-78, designed with the assumption that it would be mass produced, as it far surpassed any android of the same size at the time in terms of performance.\n\nHowever, due to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and the bursting of the Paratech bubble following the end of the Cold War, the entire Prometheus Labs Group fell into financial difficulties, and Prometheus Mechanics' top management cancelled the project. Accordingly, the three prototype aircraft, RX-78-1, -2, and -3, were stored in a warehouse owned by Prometheus Labs. Subsequent records are unclear as some documents were lost when Prometheus Mechanics went bankrupt in 1996.\n\nThe next time the RX-78 appeared on record was in 1999. The [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/1998-hub Collapse of the Veil]  brought on by [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-1710-jp the Persephone Event] and the accompanying second paratech bubble caused the Prometheus Labs Group to make a major recovery in business performance. During the financial review process, it was discovered that three prototype machines had been stolen from the warehouse.\n\nA later investigation by the Foundation revealed that after Prometheus Mechanics went bankrupt, the three prototypes were leaked onto the black market by members of [[[marshall-carter-and-dark-hub|GoI-012 (\"Marshall, Carter & Dark, Inc.\")]]], who had infiltrated the company prior. PoI-2912-JP-A purchased the RX-78-2, the second of the three prototypes. Of the remaining two aircraft, it has been revealed that the RX-78-1 is owned by Toei Heavy Industries, who reverse engineered the RX-78-1 into the \"TH-G Mk-II\". It is believed that the creation of this object is the reason why the main parts of SCP-2912-JP-1 and SCP-2912-JP-2 are completely compatible. The whereabouts of the remaining RX-78-3 is currently under investigation, as there are signs that the purchase records have been tampered with.\n\nSince the Foundation's discovery of [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/scp-1518-jp SCP-1518-JP], the United Diocese of Manhattan-Staten has been under total surveillance. However, its members secretly obtained RX-78-2 without being discovered by the Foundation, stored it in a hangar beneath a church facility on Manhattan Island, and modified it. Additionally, PoI-2912-JP-A stated that the purpose of purchasing and modifying it was to \"prepare for the coming [[[scp-2217|Flesh Calamity]]]\".\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶︎Access: Record Witness - Fillmore-1\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:95%; padding:15px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ **Record 2001/09/19**\n+++ Interview record: Fillmore- 1\n[[/=]]\n\n__**Interviewed:**__ PoI-2912-JP-A (Nathan Fillmore)\n\n----\nFrom the day [[[the-heresy-of-disassembly|His Holiness Bumaro]]] first revealed the \"scourge of the flesh,\" we began to prepare.

Although preparations were underway for an invasion operation from outside Manhattan Island with reinforcements, the expansion of the trans-dimensional area designated [[[SCP-2911-JP]]] failed to be effectively suppressed due to lack of supplies and personnel. As a result, the number of demonic entities exploded, and 75% of Manhattan Island, in addition to the Hudson River coastal area, became an anomalous zone.

This meant that the Jefferson Miller Church, which had previously been behind the front lines, was now completely isolated among the enemy forces.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶︎Access: Record 2001/09/13 - Maxwellist Log-7\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px ; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top; width:95%; padding:15px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ **Record 2001/09/13 - Maxwellist Log-7**\n\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[Begin Log]\n\n**[00m00s-]** Members of the Jefferson Miller Church attack UE-1110 using a weapon which appears to be a steam engine-powered trebuchet, but they are interrupted by crow-shaped demon entities with human heads and fail.\n\n**[02m44s-]** Multiple [[[scp-3008|SCP-3008-2]]] entities appear from surrounding buildings, shouting the phrase \"Customers, please refrain from playing with the displayed items.\", approaching the trebuchet and its operators with hostile intent.\n\n**[03m34s-]** To protect the trebuchet, members of the Jefferson Miller Church, including PoI-2912-JP-A who is equipped with a war hammer, engage the SCP-3008-2 entities.

The man took out a sword-like object from his own shadow and slashed at the demons around him, or tore them apart with his bare hands, wiping them out. Everything was over in an instant, and the blown hatch finally fell to the ground with a loud metallic sound.\n\nThe hatch had just one word written on it: [[a href=\"*http://scpclassic.wikidot.com/scp-076\" class=\"color-green\"]]__Able.__[[/a]]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"▶︎Access: Record 2001/09/13 - Maxwellist Log-8\" hide=\"- Access Granted\"]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border-radius: 10px; border:dashed 1px #444444; background:#F5F5F5; float:top ; width:95%; padding:15px\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n+++ **Record 2001/09/13 - Maxwellist Log-8**\n\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n//[Note: The text below is a transcription of what appeared on a slip of paper that was included in the Cogwork Orthodox Church's Steam Cannon Communications.

In other words, even if you are a piece of junk, if we all come together you can fight like a hero.\n\nThis opinion can also be applied to humans. Maybe we just think of ourselves as junk. Have you ever thought, \"Compared to other people, how insignificant and small I am as a person'?' All things are parts that make up the world. There is very little difference between you and other people. After all, both are parts of the world.\n\nAll people are just unfinished individuals. The history of humankind is that things that are nothing more than minute parts in various shapes that have survived drastic changes in environments by coming together.\n\nOur world is currently exposed to a threat unprecedented in human history. [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/early-summer-1998 Divine rampages], [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/r-sinano-chuo-co-jp-2038-05-18-1730hk1 terrorism], [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/tokyo-incidents various disasters], and [http://scp-jp.wikidot.com/scp-2041-jp abnormal diseases]. All of these problems are difficult to solve, and we will continue to have to deal with them. If we remain divided, humanity will not escape destruction from these threats. Now is the time to unite against the great enemy.\n\nIs that an impossibility? Will the followers of MEKHANE continue to tussle with the Nälkä until the end of time? No, I do not think so. Ladies and gentlemen, please pay attention to me one last time. Manhattan's Mekhanite is already nothing but a broken machine. But it is a symbol of the unbreakable spirit that all those who believe in love, peace, and freedom can unite across the barriers of organization, faith, and interest.\n\nLet's help each other. If we do that, nothing is impossible for us.\n\n//[Applause]//\n\nThank you. Lastly, I would like to say a word to the people who will come here in the future.\n\nWelcome to Manhattan, the melting pot of the human race and existence. No matter who you are, we welcome you.\n\n//[Even louder applause]//\n\n[[/div]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n\n[[include component:image-block\n|name=http://scp-jp.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-2912-jp/%E3%82%BB%E3%83%B3%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AB%E3%83%91%E3%83%BC%E3%82%AF2.jpg\n|align=center\n|width=600px\n|caption= Image taken from Central Park, Manhattan, which returned to the baseline reality on 2001/09/15.\n]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n@@@@\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"Footnotes\"hide=\"-Hide\"]]\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]",
