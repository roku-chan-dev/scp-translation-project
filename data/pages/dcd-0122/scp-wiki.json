Setting up a scenario explaining the events to the British soldiers, supported by several false testimonies. Requisition of aircraft and crew from Group 224 of the Royal Air Force (including B-24 Liberators and B-25 Mitchells), 150 tons of phosphorus bombs.\n\n**__Problem Case:__** On the night of February 19th to February 20th 1945, during the Battle of Ramree Island in British India,[[footnote]] Present-day Burma. [[/footnote]] close to 900 soldiers from the 54th division of the Imperial Japanese Army were forced to retreat through the swamps at the center of the island. This same night had a manifestation of --SCP-224--[[footnote]] Document declassified after neutralization. The current report no longer corresponds to the phenomenon referenced here. [[/footnote]]. From the start of the phenomenon at the end of the evening, Lieutenant Burnett, an agent of the SCP Foundation, managed to convince General Lomax to not continue the attack and to fortify the positions at the entrance to the swamp.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dcd-0122/body.jpg|caption=Royal Marines getting ready to incinerate the partially transformmed corpses of Japanese soldiers.]]\n\nLieutenant Burnett informed the British soldiers of the nature of --SCP-224-- and organized defenses around the zone. He then led the 3rd Brigade of the Royal Marines until the end of the phenomenon. Only 58 British soldiers were killed in the combat against --SCP-224-1-- and ---2-- instances before the arrival of bombers urgently requested by Lieutenant Burnett at approximately 03:50.\n\nTrapped in the middle of ██ █████████ ██ ██ ████ ██ ████ where ███ █████ █████ ████████ ██ ██████ were gathered, the Japanese soldiers were quickly overwhelmed and █████ ██ █████ ██████████, ████ █████████, ████ ████ ████████ ███ ███ █████ █████ █████ ███ █████████. ██ █████ ████ ███ ████ ███ ███ ██████████ ███ ███████. ███ ██████ ██ ████ combined with the incendiary bomb drop on the area left only ██ survivors, including ██ ███████ ███ █████████ █████ ███ ██████████ and were successfully neutralized. The remaining 20 soldiers were captured without resistance the next morning.\n\nDespite the end of ██ ████████, and on the orders of Lieutenant Burnett, access to the area was strictly forbidden. The soldiers who came into contact with --SCP-224-2-- instances were isolated and individually inspected for ██████ █████ █████████ ██████████ (█ cases were identified and immediately eliminated).\n\n**__Proposed Protocol:__** The corpses of fallen British soldiers were collected and incinerated. The area affected by --SCP-224-- was heavily bombed in the following days in order to erase all traces of ████ ████████ ██ ███ ██████████ ██████████. Unfortunately, these efforts proved to be insufficient to completely destroy the ████████ bodies of Japanese soldiers, although their condition did not allow for their cause of death to be identified.\n\n[[include component:image-block name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/dcd-0122/raf.jpg|caption=Group 224's aircraft flying above Ramree Island (D+3).]]\n\nThe absence of amnestic substances on location and the Burma Campaign's difficult conditions didn't allow for the British soldiers to be treated for three weeks. They were retired from combat, isolated from the rest of the troops, and were forbidden to write letters during this period. The Japanese soldiers' disappearances were explained by the presence of several thousand saltwater crocodiles in the marshes, who would have attacked and devoured the Japanese, thus explaining the more than mutilated state of the bodies. False testimonies by several members of the 3rd Brigade of the Royal Marines who had agreed to join the Foundation were also set up to finish convincing the soldiers.\n\nLater in the conflict, Group 224 of the Royal Air Force's crew and British India's general staff were also amnestized. The Japanese soldiers were executed.\n\n**__Addendum:__** [Update 16/08/████] Numerous historians have questioned the explanation that the Japanese troops were wiped out by crocodiles, arguing that such a concentration of adult crocodiles within the Ramree Island ecosystem was impossible. The specialists of the DCD managed to find a coherent explanation to replace the previous scenario. The currently accepted hypothesis is that the Japanese succumbed to tropical diseases, venomous animals, and crocodiles, as well as a lack of water and food.",
