Occurrences of SCP-7392-B as detected by SCP-7392-A are to be documented, with the inclusion of the affected employee's name and position. A fabricated document for SCP-7392 is to be maintained and widely disseminated. No further action at this time is necessary.\n\n**Description:** \"SCP-7392\" is a fictitious anomaly used to explain the installation of surveillance devices required for the operation of SCP-7392-A, and as part of disinformation protocols aimed at the cause of the SCP-7392-B phenomenon. \n\n//SCP-7392-A// is the Abilene-Cotard Psychological Deviance Assessment Executable (ACPDAE). ACPDAE was developed by the Site-19 Department of Statistics from 1976 to 1978 as part of a wider initiative to introduce broad, institutional mechanisms of employee surveillance and productivity optimisation. When fed a significant number of social interactions produced by an individual -- such as transcripts of their speech, written communication, and purchase history -- the program is able to form a predictive profile of their behaviour.[[footnote]]As was demonstrated at the Site-19 Developing Technologies exhibition in 1993, when ACPDAE was used to predict the contents of a conversation between several randomly chosen members of the audience which would take place at the end of the night, with a transcript being provided to non-party witnesses before the exhibition.[[/footnote]]\n\n//SCP-7392-B// is a phenomenon in which individuals whose behaviour has been well-characterised by ACPDAE will unexpectedly significantly deviate from ACPDAE's predictions. All subsequent actions which they perform and all further opinions which they espouse will be impossible for ACPDAE to reconcile with their past personalities. Relatives and acquaintances of individuals affected by SCP-7392-B generally report feelings of unfamiliarity or alienation following the event. \n\nSCP-7392-B never recurs within the same individual. Based upon random sampling of various site populations, the anomaly has likely affected 3.06Â±0.21% (p<0.001) of persons currently under the Foundation's employ.\n\nPopulations most affected by SCP-7392-B have higher than average rates of employee disappearance, Capgras Syndrome,[[footnote]]A delusion in which an individual believes that their loved ones have been replaced by identical impostors.[[/footnote]] and mental health crises, corresponding with the ratio of SCP-7392-B affected employees to unaffected staff. The implications of this are explored below. \n\n**Addendum 7392.1:** Interpretations of SCP-7392-B\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access fileserv:/S:/7392/fileserv/investigation\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n||~ Theory ||||~ Verdict ||\n|| SCP-7392-B represents a failure in ACPDAE's algorithm to perform its intended function |||| Unlikely, due to SCP-7392-B only affecting an individual once in their life. If SCP-7392-B was a totally stochastic software error, it would be capable of recurring for the same person. ||\n|| SCP-7392-B is a natural consequence of ACPDAE not having the ability to parse non-observable data, such as an individual's imagination |||| Nearly impossible. If small, internal thought dynamics were responsible for minute shifts in personality, these changes would manifest gradually and be accounted for within the program's margin-of-error assessment. However, SCP-7392-B results in an instantaneous alteration in affect with no apparent correlation to any events taking place in the affected individual's life. ||\n|| SCP-7392-B is evidence of a virulent memetic contagion which produces extremely mild shifts in personality, such as an increase in risk-seeking behaviour |||| Unlikely. If SCP-7392-B was the byproduct of a memetic hazard, there would be unifying psychological factors which could predict its spread. However, psychology appears to play no role in its occurrence, nor can it be reversed with amnestics or mnestics. ||\n|| SCP-7392-B is an independent statistical anomaly with no underlying cause |||| Possible. However, this is not a falsifiable hypothesis, hence it cannot inform any particular course of action aside from a lack thereof. ||\n|| SCP-7392-B is evidence that Foundation employees are being replaced by human, or humanlike, impostors |||| Possible. Clandestine testing has revealed minor genetic and anatomical incongruencies between SCP-7392-B affected employees and baseline humanity which cannot be explained by natural variation. It is unclear whether this is a reliable method of differentiating affected and unaffected individuals.[[footnote]]There is no foolproof method of detecting the 'impostors' suggested by this hypothesis: though ACPDAE is capable of detecting compromised personnel after their apparent replacement, an unknown number of SCP-7392-B events may have taken place before ACPDAE was activated, and could serve as vectors for SCP-7392-B even if all employees tagged by ACPDAE were to be terminated or contained.[[/footnote]] Due to the self-concealing nature of the threat hypothesised in this scenario, theoretical containment procedures will be enacted as a matter of precaution. ||\n\nBased on the findings of the SCP-7392 research committee, the fabricated documentation for SCP-7392 (Clearance Level 1) has been drafted and published. Since the institution of containment procedures, rates of employee disappearance, injury, and Capgras Syndrome within sites heavily affected by SCP-7392-B have returned to baseline. Occurrences of SCP-7392-B have also diminished in frequency and are expected to have been abolished by 2040. Heightened rates and exacerbations in the severity of scopophobia are considered to be preferable to all alternatives.[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum 7392.2:** Incident 7392.2\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Access fileserv:/S:/7392/fileserv/incident/2\" hide=\"- ACCESS GRANTED\"]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= leopoldofregoli0095@scp.int\n|to= O5-4@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= We Know\n]]\n\nThank you for the promotion, prey. However, I must criticise your lack of diligence in protecting the integrity of your lie. Doctor Fregoli was replaced before ACPDAE was ever activated, you see. \n\nI have already revealed the nature of your deception to my brethren. We know you are defenceless now. Expect us soon. \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Leopoldo Fregoli\n|title= Director of Site-33\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= O5-4@scp.int\n|to= leopoldofregoli0095@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= Re: We Know\n]]\n\n//Attachment:// ##red|SCP-7392/Offset-3.pdf##[[footnote]]An exact copy of the clearance level 1 documentation for SCP-7392, except with its clearance level having been raised to level 5, and with the addition of a note stating that offset-2 was also falsified.[[/footnote]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= O5-4\n|title= Overseer of the Foundation\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails start=--\n|from= leopoldofregoli0095@scp.int\n|to= O5-4@scp.int\n|cc=none\n|subject= Re: Re: We Know\n]]\n\nI cannot apologise enough for the contents of the last email, Overseer, one of the junior researchers gained access to my device, wrote the message, and sent it to you without my knowledge or assent. I have already initiated punitive measures and will endeavour to never allow such a mistake on my part to ever occur again.\n\nI hope that we can put this incident behind us and return to our previous professional relationship. I look forward to working with you in future. \n[[include :scp-wiki:component:dynamic-emails end=--\n|name= Leopoldo Fregoli\n|title= Director of Site-33\n|signoff= Secure, Contain, Protect\n|signoff-icon= https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/component:dynamic-emails/transparent.png\n]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7391]]] |  SCP-7392 | [[[SCP-7393]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
