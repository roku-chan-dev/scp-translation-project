Provisional diet is one tablespoon of nutrient-supplemented fruit mix[[footnote]]Note to containment technicians: same as the mix given to [[[SCP-1192]]] housed on the shelf above.[[/footnote]], twice daily. One fresh, living mealworm larva is also to be offered as food once a week, dependent on good behaviour. \n\nAllowing SCP-3121 to craft tools and structures reduces outward signs of distress. Dependent on good behaviour, raw materials such as straw, small sticks, and leaves may be introduced into SCP-3121’s cage. SCP-3121’s stick hut, which it has constructed using enrichment materials, is not to be replaced when cleaning.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3121 is a sapient humanoid measuring 9.8 cm in height. In addition to its small stature, the entity displays other deviations from standard human morphology. SCP-3121’s skin is sea green in tone, and covered in wart-like nodules. It also possesses exaggerated facial features, including a heavy brow, prominent cheekbones, and markedly pointed ears, nose and chin. Its overall appearance is reminiscent of an imp or hobgoblin in European folklore.\n\nAside from its appearance, SCP-3121 is not known to exhibit any other anomalous traits at present[[footnote]]Note: SCP-3121 was only recently brought into containment, so the full extent of its properties is yet to be determined through testing.[[/footnote]]. Its biological functions and requirements appear to be as expected of a similarly sized non-anomalous mammal. SCP-3121 displays both primary and secondary masculine sexual characteristics.\n\nSCP-3121 speaks in a dialect similar to Middle High German, a form of the German language spoken between the 11th and 14th centuries. Dr Lena Reiterer, a Foundation linguist with some fluency in a later form of the language, Early New High German, is able to hold conversations with the entity. SCP-3121 is currently uncooperative in interviews, displaying behavioural signs of distress and continually asking for the whereabouts of its “wife”. \n\nSCP-3121 was originally found in the Forest of Fontainebleau in northern France on 2005-10-13, inhabiting a crudely constructed hut made from sticks. Materials found within suggest inhabitation for two entities; it is believed that the “wife” mentioned by SCP-3121 was near the site at the time of initial retrieval, but evaded capture without being seen by containment personnel.\n\n**Addenda:**\n[[collapsible show=\" ▶  Show: SCP-3121 Interview Log \" hide=\" ▽  Hide: SCP-3121 Interview Log  \"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; color:#332222; border:dashed 1px #99AAAA; background:#F7F7F7; width:90%; float:center; padding:8px 25px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n\n||= **DATE** || 2005-10-15 11:29 UTC ||\n||= **INTERVIEWER** || Dr Lena Reiterer ||\n||= **SUPERVISED BY** ||  Senior Researcher Jacob Currie (Sentient Containment Specialist) ||\n\n------\n\n= {{Dialogue translated from archaic High German unless noted otherwise.}}\n\n------\n _\n\n[[==]]\n\n**DR REITERER:** Hello, SCP-3121.\n\n//{{[SCP-3121 runs to the corner of the cage and cowers.]}}//\n\n**DR REITERER:** How is it going?

Foundation data crawlers are to monitor mentions of possible SCP-3121-B activity in all surveillance vectors, including internet traffic, civilian phone messages, security camera feeds, and emergency service radio. If an SCP-3121-B sighting is suspected, the nearest available Mobile Task Force is to be immediately deployed to SCP-3121-B’s last known location. All surviving witnesses of SCP-3121-B activity are to be located and amnesticised at the earliest opportunity.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3121-A (previously SCP-3121) is a sapient humanoid measuring 9.8 cm in height, similar in appearance to imps or hobgoblins of European folklore. SCP-3121-A has masculine primary and secondary sexual characteristics, and is capable of speech in a dialect similar to Middle High German. The Foundation currently holds SCP-3121-A in containment.\n\nSCP-3121-B is a sapient humanoid similar to SCP-3121-A. SCP-3121-B is uncontained, hostile, and dangerous. According to video evidence, SCP-3121-B has the anomalous ability of travelling long distances instantaneously by entering the cranial cavities of human beings.\n\nIt is believed that SCP-3121-B is the “wife” character previously mentioned by SCP-3121-A.\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\" ▶  Show: SCP-3121 Video Log 1 \" hide=\" ▽  Hide: SCP-3121 Video Log 1 \"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; color:#332222; line-height:150%; border:dashed 1px #99AAAA; background:#F7F7F7; width:90%; float:center; padding:20px 35px; margin: 20px 10px 30px 40px\"]]\n\n||= **LOCATION** || Zagreb, Croatia ||\n||= **DATE** || 2005-10-23 09:13 (07:13 UTC) ||\n||= **SOURCE** || Security camera footage ||\n\n------\n\n= {{//NOTE: NO AUDIO.//}}\n\n------\n _\n[[include component:image-block\n        name=cctv1.jpg|\n        caption=Still from 09:13:50|\n\twidth=270px\n    ]]\n\n[[==]]\n\n__**09:13:43 – 09:13:52**__ Pedestrians walk on the street.

A middle-aged woman in a green shawl carrying a shopping bag jogs into view from the bottom of the frame. She stops next to the man and leans towards him, apparently concerned for his well-being.\n\n__**09:14:19 – 09:14:31**__ A young man in a black coat walks over to observe the situation and exchanges some brief words with the woman in the green shawl; he then begins to make a call on his mobile phone. The bald man crouched against the wall begins to shake violently. Witnesses report him moaning loudly at this point.\n\n__**09:14:32 – 09:14:40**__ The bald man, still facing away from the camera, stops shaking and falls still. Three seconds later, the woman in the green shawl stands up abruptly, falling onto her back. The view shows the apparent reason for this: the back of the bald man’s scalp has been suddenly split open by a large gash. Rhythmic movement of a small light-coloured object can be observed within the wound, which coincides with the bald man’s head jerking slightly, as if his head is being opened from the inside.\n\n__**09:14:34 – 09:14:39**__ Three more persons approach the scene from various positions. The wound is increasing in size and bleeding profusely; all bystanders appear to be reacting with panic.\n\n__**09:14:40 – 09:14:45**__ The wound in the man’s head bulges. A small figure about 10 cm in height bursts from the gash and leaps to the ground. Chaos ensues. All bystanders jump and run to move away from the small entity – except for the middle-aged woman in the green shawl, who is still lying on her back after having fallen.\n\n__**09:14:46 – 09:14:56**__ Two male bystanders flee the scene. The small figure looks around, pointing at several individuals. Witnesses report it repeating a phrase in an unknown language as it does so. The figure then clambers up onto the face of the middle-aged woman lying on the floor.\n\n__**09:14:57 – 09:15:10**__ Blood quickly pools on the pavement below the woman as she clutches at her temples and throat. Autopsy examination indicates that the small figure used a slashing implement to sever several arteries in the woman’s neck and face while climbing onto her head. The small figure stoops down over the woman’s face; it is not clear from the footage, but witnesses report the small figure at this point slicing at the woman’s left eye. \n\n__**09:15:11 – 09:15:19**__ The woman paws weakly at her throat, which is still gushing blood. Remaining bystanders shout and gesture in distress, but none step forward to intervene. The small figure stops slicing and disappears into the woman’s face, apparently entering through the left eye socket.\n\n__**09:15:20 – 09:15:25**__ The woman’s head jerks slightly, and is then still. Dark fumes rise out of her head.\n\n__**09:15:26 – 09:15:30**__ A can rolls out of the dead woman’s shopping bag and onto the road. It is run over by a car.

It seems that the anomaly was correct to state this.\n\nThe activities of this wife, SCP-3121-B, are described as follows.  It cuts into the heads of humans, through the eyes most often, and penetrates a thin segment of skull.  Witnesses report that the anomaly uses a large metal nail to do this.  It enters the brain and performs an unknown action.  Then, SCP-3121-B and a perfect sphere of cerebral tissue disappear, leaving a hot, cauterised hole in the human’s brain.  \n\nSCP-3121-B reappears in the brain of another human somewhere else on the planet and exits by cutting through the back of that person’s head.  It can then repeat the above process on a different individual.  The travel between brains is instantaneous.  No distance limit or pattern in the travel of SCP-3121-B has been observed. Analysis indicates that the human SCP-3121-B manifests in is chosen randomly.\n\nWe have audio samples of SCP-3121-B speaking to witnesses.  Ms Reiterer tells me that the anomaly speaks the same language as SCP-3121-A, and the speech translates to questions about the location of SCP-3121-B's “husband”.  Curse words are also present.\n\nContaining SCP-3121-B is of high importance.  SCP-3121-B activity is frequent and unpredictable.  The activity often occurs in public places.  Only two of the forty-eight civilians who have been host to SCP-3121-B’s ability have survived. Both suffer from extreme and permanent brain damage due to the large volume of missing tissue. \n\nConcealing the many deaths and amnesticising witnesses is a drain on resources.  SCP-3121-B activity occurring on live broadcast or to a high-profile individual would be major emergency.  The current situation represents a severe information breach.\n\nSCP-3121-A has not been compliant in providing information on SCP-3121-B and its anomalous travel ability.  To increase the likelihood of obtaining this information, I have deprived the anomaly of all privileges and instituted more stringent interrogation techniques.\n _\n\n{{– Acting Head of SCP-3121 Containment, SR Jacob Currie}}\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n _\n\n------\n\n _\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#1e6ec3; font-size:16px; border:solid 1px #005BBB; background:#F0F7FF\"]]\n\nYou are viewing the edit history of this page.\nThe version shown below is revision {{**9**}} from  {{**2005-11-01 08:51**}}.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n _\n\n**Object Class:** Euclid\n\n[[include component:image-block\n        name=map.png|\n        caption=Locations of individuals known to have hosted SCP-3121-B's travel ability prior to containment|\n\twidth=300px\n    ]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3121-A and SCP-3121-B are to be contained separately. Each is to be contained in airlocked chambers suitable for high-risk intelligent anomalies. Human contact is to be avoided when possible, in order to minimise the risk of the entities utilising their anomalous travel ability.\n\nAdditional care is to be taken with SCP-3121-B, which is hostile and aggressive. SCP-3121-B should be physically restrained at all times, with additional restraints added during interviews or other necessary close interactions.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3121-A and -B are small, sapient humanoids measuring approximately 10 cm in height, similar in appearance to imps or hobgoblins in European folklore. According to sexual characteristics, SCP-3121-A is of male sex, and SCP-3121-B female. Both entities are capable of speech in a dialect similar to Middle High German.\n \nSCP-3121-B has demonstrated an anomalous ability to travel instantly between the brains of human beings. It is unknown whether SCP-3121-A also possesses this ability. \n\nSCP-3121-A was originally acquired alone at a location in the Forest of Fontainebleau, France, on 2005-10-13. It is presumed that SCP-3121-B observed the containment of SCP-3121-A without being seen by containment personnel. One week later, on 2005-10-21, SCP-3121-B began utilising its anomalous travel ability in an apparent search for SCP-3121-A, which it describes as its “husband”. 141 individuals across 48 countries are known to have been affected by SCP-3121-B’s travel activity, of which 135 subsequently died due to traumatic brain injury.\n\nSCP-3121-B was contained in rural Bangladesh, having manifesting in the head of a woman wearing a motorcycle helmet and being unable to break through the headgear. The female victim was then admitted to a local hospital as an apparent stroke victim, where medical staff noticed scraping sounds and muffled shouts emanating from her helmet. Mobile Task Force Xi-8  (“Spearhunters”) were able to capture the entity at the site.\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\" ▶  Show: SCP-3121-B Interview Log \" hide=\" ▽  Hide: SCP-3121-B Interview Log  \"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; color:#332222; border:dashed 1px #99AAAA; background:#F7F7F7; width:90%; float:center; padding:8px 40px; margin: 10px 10px 20px 40px\"]]\n\n||= **DATE** || 2005-10-31 15:05 UTC ||\n||= **INTERVIEWER** || Dr Lena Reiterer ||\n||= **SUPERVISED BY** ||  Senior Researcher Jacob Currie (Head of Containment, SCP-3121) ||\n\n------\n\n= {{Dialogue translated from archaic High German unless noted otherwise.}}\n\n= {{//NOTE: For the duration of this interview, SCP-3121-B had been restrained to a chair capable of delivering electric shocks to the occupant.//}}\n\n------\n _\n\n[[==]]\n\n\n\n**SCP-3121-B:** {{//[Continued from previous unrecorded dialogue]//}} —devil, you are unspeakable deformities, both of you.

Senior Researcher Currie placed SCP-3121-A into the shock chair used in the interview logged above. SCP-3121-B was also restrained in the same room, and forced to watch as Senior Researcher Currie applied increasingly strong electric shocks to SCP-3121-A. Notably, this was the first time since their containment that SCP-3121-A and SCP-3121-B had seen each other.\n\nTwenty-five minutes into the exercise, SCP-3121-B broke free of its restraints and incapacitated Senior Researcher Currie before subjecting him to [REDACTED]. After this, SCP-3121-B used Senior Researcher Currie’s corpse to activate its travel ability, and disappeared with SCP-3121-A. As of this incident, SCP-3121-A and SCP-3121-B are now considered to be uncontained, and their whereabouts unknown.\n\nDr Lena Reiterer, previously translator in SCP-3121 interviews, has been promoted to Head of Containment for SCP-3121 in the light of Senior Researcher Currie’s death.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n _\n\n------\n\n _\n\n[[=]]\n\n[[div style=\"color:#1e6ec3; font-size:16px; border:solid 1px #005BBB; background:#F0F7FF\"]]\n\nYou are viewing the edit history of this page.\nThe version shown below is the **current revision** {{**21**}} from  {{**2017-11-02 10:15**}}.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/=]]\n\n _\n\n[[include component:image-block\n        name=aerial.png|\n        caption=Aerial photograph with SCP-3121's containment site outlined|\n\twidth=210px\n    ]]\n\n**Object Class:** Keter (see Addendum: SCP-3121 Object Class Status)\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** SCP-3121-A and -B are to be contained on-site at their current location in the forests of Småland, Sweden. An exclusion zone 400 m x 400 m centered around SCP-3121’s main habitation structure is to be maintained, patrolled by two guards and surrounded by antimemetic fencing to dissuade passersby from entering.\n\nContainment activities are to be carried out so that Foundation personnel are not seen by SCP-3121-A and -B, as experience to date suggests that they remain non-hostile as long as they do not witness human beings.\n\n**Description:** SCP-3121-A and -B are small, sapient humanoids measuring approximately 10 cm in height. The entities resemble imps or hobgoblins from European folklore. According to morphological sexual characteristics, SCP-3121-A is male, and SCP-3121-B female; the entities describe each other as “husband” and “wife”, and display a strong emotional attachment.\n\nThe entities have human-level intelligence, speaking a dialect similar to Middle High German. They display high proficiency in tool-making and wilderness survival, which they use to practice a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. Their diet consists mainly of berries, tubers, and insects.\n\nPrevious interviews with SCP-3121-B suggest that the entities are at least 800 years old. The same interviews suggest that SCP-3121-A and -B are one of the few – possibly only – surviving members of what was once a more numerous population of similar beings.\n\nSCP-3121-A and -B were previously contained at Site-66, before an incident in which a Foundation employee, Senior Researcher Currie, [REDACTED] [[footnote]]For further information, see //[[[Ketergrams]]] 2005//. In a post-incident review, Senior Researcher Currie's conduct during interrogations of SCP-3121 was found to be in breach of the Foundation's ethical guidelines for intelligent anomaly containment.[[/footnote]].\n\n[[include component:image-block\n        name=newshack.png|\n        caption=Abandoned hunting shack used by SCP-3121 as their main habitation structure|\n\twidth=250px\n    ]]\n\nTwo years later, on 2007-08-03, the SCP-3121 entities were discovered at their present location in Småland, Sweden, and current containment procedures were implemented.\n\nNo hostile activity has been displayed by either SCP-3121 entity since their escape together from initial containment. All observations of SCP-3121 at their current site have shown them engaging in domestic activities, creating handicrafts, and taking walks around the containment site, usually while holding hands.\n\n**Addenda:**\n\n[[collapsible show=\" ▶  Show: SCP-3121 Object Class Status \" hide=\" ▽  Hide: SCP-3121 Object Class Status  \"]]\n\n**2017-11-05:** Senior Researcher Lena Reiterer, Head of SCP-3121 Containment, has applied for SCP-3121 to be downgraded from Keter to Euclid after 12 years of docile behaviour. The application has passed the first round of review.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-3120]]] | SCP-3121 | [[[SCP-3122]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
