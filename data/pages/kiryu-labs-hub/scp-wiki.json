Kiryu \n> Head Assistant Researcher: R. Mercer\n> \n> Kiryu Labs is a Site-19-based collection of experimental rooms designed to process low-priority anomalous items of varying properties. Personnel associated with Kiryu Labs are required to have substantial laboratory training and proficiency in experimental design and documentation. Personnel from all specializations welcome.\n> \n> The Foundation designates caches of anomalous items to be examined by Kiryu Labs each week. Occasionally, personnel may be assigned to leave the site to investigate an anomalous object and report on further containment action. During these tasks, transportation and requisite provisions will be provided accordingly; further specific travel-related resources are available upon request.\n> \n> Any general questions may be directed to Dr. Kiryu. For new assignments relating to department transfer and/or temporary lab research work, please contact Researcher Mercer.\n\nThere are 18 rooms total that make up Kiryu Labs.\n\nExperimental Room 217’s color scheme is a cold, clinical white, and the brushed steel supply cabinets gleam dull silver under the fluorescent lighting. Temperature controls and other such machinery panels buzz imperceptibly near the three doors. Mounted security cameras are positioned along each wall, eight in total. In the center of the rectangular room is what looks like a small pit; it is three feet deep and wide enough for several people to walk around in it fairly comfortably.\n\nExperimental Room 205, affectionately known as \"the combustion lab\", is a patchwork of concrete and calcium silicate paneling. Neat racks of fire-resistant clothing, fire blankets, and fire extinguishers are located on each of the four walls. Supply cabinets and wheeled tables are scattered evenly throughout the relatively large space; the few machines in the room are concealed behind fireproof barriers.\n\nExperimental Room 208 looks like it'd be more suited to an old-fashioned dojo or martial arts school, instead of a research facility. Wood paneling lines the walls, rectangular sections of the floor are padded, and the assortment of tables around the room are scattered with various tools used for antique maintenance.\n\nThese and the other rooms are where a few of the Foundation’s caches of anomalous items (not quite interesting enough to merit special containment, not quite harmless enough to be stuffed in a broom closet) are processed.\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Introductions]]\n\n> **Dr. Mark Kiryu** - Level-3 Senior Researcher/Lab Director\n> **Background:** Attained PhD in Psychology, successful career as a therapist. \n> **Historical Note:** Mark joined the Foundation after having being selected as a primary caretaker of SCP-1457. He's worked with 1457 for half of his Foundation career and is responsible for nearly all of the Foundation's records involving it. \n> **Current Role:** Head of research for several projects involving SCP sapient entities. Maintains Kiryu Labs. Listed as emergency contact for employee grief counseling. Enjoys wearing elaborate costumes for Halloween and other occasions.\n\n> **Researcher Riven Mercer** - Level-2 Researcher\n> **Background:** Recruited from university graduate student lab studying animal behavior.\n> **Historical Note:** Riven's (rather eccentric, just look at his name) parents made a living training service dogs in England, hence his professional interests and area of study. Riven's family moved to the United States while Riven was in high school. \n> **Current Role:** Aids in research of Safe-class SCP objects and oversees personnel assignments and timetables for Kiryu Labs. Working towards veterinary degree. Has a small streak of blue dyed into his hair. \n\n> **Agent Tai Yang Shen** - Level-3 Field Agent\n> **Background:** Immigrated to the United States from China. Recruited from an American university, was studying social sciences and criminology.\n> **Historical Note:** His name is a Foundation-assigned alias, and can be translated to \"Sun God\". This is a reference to his time in training as an agent, when he kept a money tree plant named \"Mei\" and would often talk about it as if it were a person. His cohort thought Mei was his girlfriend, and upon finding out Mei was a tree, jokingly gave Shen the nickname \"Apollo\" after the Greek god who fell in love with a nymph who turned into a tree. The nickname stuck and eventually factored into Shen's alias.\n> **Current Role:** When not on outside missions, handles most outside investigations assigned to Kiryu Labs. Has taken martial arts classes. Will politely refuse snacks if they are not fruit-based.\n\n> **Researcher Zyn Kiryu** - Level-2 Researcher\n> **Background:** Recruited from a university biology lab. \n> **Historical Note:** [CLASSIFIED]\n> **Current Role:** Researches biological SCP entities, occasionally does clerical work for Kiryu Labs. Working towards doctorate specializing in biological engineering. Likes butterflies.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Day 1\" hide=\"Day 1\"]]\n“Hey, Riven?”\n\n“Yes, Dr. Kiryu?”\n\n“Call me Mark. Riven, if you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be and why?”\n\n“…are you serious? I just got assigned here and we’ve got a month’s backlog of anomalous items to process.”\n[[/collapsible]]\n---\n[[collapsible show=\"Day 17\" hide=\"Day 17\"]]\n“Riven. Riven. Hey hey Riven Riv Riv Riven hey hey.”\n\n“What is it, Mark.”\n\n“Riven if someone burst into this room foaming at the mouth and waving a butter knife at you, which item on your desk would you use to defend yourself?”\n\n“Stapler. Or your potted bamboo.”\n\n“But that’s on //my// desk.”\n\n“I know. If you want to psychoanalyze me, then you’ll have to get proper documentation for it. That Agent Shen guy will be on-site tomorrow. We’ve got work to do.”\n[[/collapsible]]\n---\n[[collapsible show=\"Day 34\" hide=\"Day 34\"]]\n“Happy morning to you, you’ve got research to do, it looks like a long day--”\n\n“Mark, why are you singing?”\n\n“I think I mixed up the decaf tea. My sister's fault, she did all the backlog paperwork yesterday. What’s your favorite constellation, Rivs?”\n\n“It’s Draco. Did you book the experimental room for this afternoon?”\n[[/collapsible]]\n---\n[[collapsible show=\"Day 100\" hide=\"Day 100\"]]\n“Morning, Riven.”\n\n“Morning, Mark.”\n\n“…”\n\n“…Hey, Mark?”\n\n“Yeah?”\n\n“If you have any bird as a pet, which one would you choose and why?”\n\n“Tough question. Probably a nice little song sparrow or something else that sings and is little. Or a Peregrine Falcon. Fastest animal alive, beautiful plumage, and can take out birds in midair. Raptor. Dinosaur murder-birdie.”\n\n“Right. I’m having trouble reconciling the two. You sure you don’t have a split personality?”\n\n“What about you, Riven? Birds, I mean.”\n\n“I like lizards more.”\n\n“Lizards, huh?”\n\n“Yeah.”\n[[/collapsible]]\n---\n[[collapsible show=\"Day 101\" hide=\"Day 101\"]]\nAnd that was how Kiryu Labs came to own a somewhat-grumpy Bearded Dragon named Crellan, who now lives in a terrarium in the sitting room.\n[[/collapsible]]\nεїз εїз εїз εїз εїз\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Processed Items of Note]]\n++++ On-Site Processing\n* [[[More than Ever]]] - anomalous book\n> //My first interview.
