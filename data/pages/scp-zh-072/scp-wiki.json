We followed clues from the //Biography of Nagarjuna// and travelled to India, where we discovered a prescription for a green pill composed of 70 different medicinal herbs. We then modified and developed it into its current form. To use the 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】, divide it in half, with one half swallowed and the other half ground into a powder with 20 mL of water. Then, apply it to behind both ears and the back of the neck. After waiting for five minutes, the effects take hold.\n\nAs the name suggests, the 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】 is capable of concealing the user's presence. By stimulating the user's potential, it eliminates both the user and accompanying items from sensory triggers (including visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and certain extrasensory perceptions). The pill's effects also include the ability to erase any evidence of the user's presence during its effectiveness.\n\n[[div style=\"border:double 5px red; padding:1em; margin-bottom: 10px;text-align:center;\"]]\n\n++ **##red|CAUTION:##**\n\nThe effect of 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】 is to conceal the user, but it does not provide protection against the dangers associated with invisibility or eliminate physical traces left behind.\n\nMoreover, the invisibility effect is essentially irreversible until its effectiveness wears off.  If you need to use the 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】, please make adequate preparations for emergency measures such as first aid and evacuation.\n\nPlease note that before using it.\n[[/div]]\n------\n\n@@@@\n++ Q&A\n> **Q:** What is the size of one pill, and how is it packaged?\n>\n> **A:** Each pill weighs approximately 15 grams with a diameter of about 3 centimeters. Both the two-pill and ten-pill packages are enclosed in a covered wooden box, and the expiration date is printed on the individual oil paper packaging of each pill.\n\n> **Q:** Does 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】 contain any allergenic ingredients?\n>\n> **A:** Since natural ingredients are used, they may unavoidably contain allergenic ingredients. If you have allergies to nuts, gluten, or shellfish, we strongly advise against using the product. We recommend visiting a nearby medical facility for an oral provocation test.\n\n> **Q:** Does【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】have any side effects？\n>\n> **A:** Based on our tests, there are currently no significant side effects. However, some users have reported perceiving things that are normally invisible in daily lives.\n\n> **Q:** Can 【Nagarjuna Stealth Pill】 help me bypass machine detection?\n>\n> **A:** Yes, based on our tests, it can effectively eliminate all recorded images, sounds, and physical interactions.\n\n\n[# View 12 additional Q&A >]\n@@@@\n\n------\n\n@@@@\n++ Rating & Comments\n++ ★ 4.6\n421 Comments\n@@@@\n@@@@\n[[image https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-zh-072/standard-icon.png width=\"30px\" height=\"30px\"]]　[[size 120%]]**N.J.**[[/size]]\n★★★★★\n+++ Successfully infiltrated GOC\nThis is the most effective product I have used among all similar ones.
