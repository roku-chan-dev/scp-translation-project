It is not visible through conventional means, including direct observation via telescope or other non-anomalous equipment. SCP-6695 is composed of several orbiting panels that collectively have a total area of 50 000 000 square kilometers. SCP-6695 is inhabited by an alien civilization focused on both religious and economic interests. Most members of this civilization identify themselves as followers of the [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/second-hytoth-hub Ortothan Religion].\n\nSCP-6695-A, also known as \"Tomorrow Diamonds\", refers to a manufactured product built from the resources of BPM-37093. SCP-6695-A instances are being sold across civilizations in the Milky Way by an extraterrestrial business known as PARAGON.co. This company is comprised of several Ortothan merchants devoted to a deity known as Yorun-leusan. SCP-6695-A instances are charged with high amounts of nuclear energy without any successful estimated measures.\n\n@@ @@\n\n**Addendum 6695.1:** On 1994/05/03 at 15:23, the IAU received an anomalous radio signal originating from a distance of 50 light-years, within the Centaurus Constellation.
