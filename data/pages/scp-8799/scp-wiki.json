The object itself does not require extensive containment, but a heightened threat exists that the Office for the Reclamation of Islamic Artifacts (the ORIA) will attempt to steal the item. Consequently, Security Protocol Kappa-12 has been enacted across Secure Containment Wing 600.\n\nFollowing Incident 8799-2, any contact from SCP-8799-1 is to be forwarded to the office of Director Egon Kohl. No further incursions into SCP-8799-1 are currently planned due to the non-cooperation of the ORIA. The ORIA appears to have effectively contained the Sayyid Ali Shrine, preventing all public knowledge of its existence.\n\nThe location of Agent Nodira Jo'rayeva is unknown. All reports concerning her whereabouts are to be delivered directly to Director Kohl.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8799 is a manuscript copy of the Shahnameh, or the \"Book of Kings\", a Persian-language epic poem from the 10th century written by the Khorasani poet Ferdowsi. One of the foundational works of Persian literature, the work is a mythical history of Iran from the beginning of creation to the Islamic conquest in the 7th century CE.\n\nAbsolute dating methods have demonstrated that SCP-8799 was created over 10,000 years ago, long before the Shahnameh's composition in the 10th and 11th centuries. It contains a number of paintings within it, all identical copies of a number of non-anomalous Shahnameh manuscripts from across Iranian history since the 10th century, thus representing a broad range of chronological and stylistic variants; paleographic analysis, however, has determined that all were created at the same time as the book.\n\nThe object's primary anomalous effect is that these images all contain movement, with scenes, individuals and objects acting out the scenes they depict before reverting to their original forms [[footnote]] The similarity between this object and its effects and [[[SCP-4590]]] has been noted, although these paintings cannot be modified or communicated with. Readings from Scranton-Mochi particles found on the manuscript are identical to those in SCP-4590, suggesting a common origin. Further research underway. [[/footnote]].\n\nSCP-8799 came into Foundation possession in 1895, after the death of Foundation operative and Orientalist John Callaghan in Tus, Iran in 1894. Callaghan discovered the book in 1871 but kept it in his personal possession bequeathing the book to the Foundation in his will. Researchers have noticed that, in the 129 years the object has been in Foundation custody, the animation of the images has slowed by an average of 0.33 milliseconds per painting.\n\n**Addendum 8799-1:** As of 09/05/2023, SCP-8799 has been seconded to the Department of External Affairs for use in Operation al-Baqara.\n\n> The changing nature of the anomalous world we inhabit requires a changing response. Foundation superiority over other anomalous groups is by no means as assured as it once was. Nowhere is this more evident than in our presence - or lack of one - in the Middle East, where most anomalous affairs are entirely out of our purview. Partly, this is attributable to hostile governments and a poor reputation with local anomalous groups, but it is principally down to our relations with a single organisation: the ORIA.\n> \n> The ORIA's pre-eminence in anomalous affairs in the Islamic world is well established, but in the last five years, its activities have expanded enormously. Governments across the Middle East, regardless of their position on Iran more generally, have been turning to it, rather than us, for help with outbreaks of anomalous activity. This is partially down to a vigorous campaign of reform within the ORIA itself, with the organisation utilising its limited assets far more effectively and ruthlessly than in the past, but the truth of the matter is that we have brought this on our own heads.\n> \n> The Foundation does not command the same level of trust as it once did. Our associations with Western governments and the geographically uneven nature of our operations has changed the perception of us in the eyes of many. We are no longer seen as a neutral force, above politics and political involvement. We are seen as a colonial power, a benighted, arrogant, even fascistic group bent on using the anomalous to assert American foreign policy interests. This is, of course, a gross mischaracterisation of our mission, but we have not done enough to combat this perception, and the ORIA has taken full advantage of it. Its dominance in the Middle East is assured, we have been all but forced out of Central Asia, and, most worryingly, its influence in Russia is increasing rapidly.\n> \n> Consequently, there are two options before us. We can try to destroy the ORIA, going toe-to-toe with it and initialising another round of conflict - but I don't think many of us want this. Those of us from the older generations remember the bitter days of the late 80s, and the losses we suffered in attempting to contain the Risen Ctesiphon and the Black Div. We might prevail, but the ORIA will be expecting us, and there's a strong chance we'll lose our global preeminence in the process.\n> \n> The second option is that we engage the ORIA in a rapproachment. I know the dangers involved in this; the ORIA's mission of widespread utilisation of anomalies and \"respect\" for local cultural institutions is anathema to our core values. But I fear we have little choice. After several instances of mutual cooperation - the Bagration Incident, Operation Calico, [[[your place was empty|the study of the Complete Avesta]]]- the time is ripe for a new chapter in our relations. I know many in the ORIA are of a same mind; if we are both willing to compromise, we can create a safer, more harmonious, more //contained// world for us all.\n> \n> ~ Director Egon Kohl, Head of the ORIA Affairs Division, Department of External Affairs.\n\nAs one of a number of small-scale collaborations with the ORIA, the Foundation has agreed to perform an experiment utilising SCP-8799. Several Persian and Arabic manuscripts dating as far back as the 11th century in the ORIA's possession appear to mention SCP-8799, describing the nature, style and anomalous effects of SCP-8799 in remarkable details. All of these associate SCP-8799 with a shrine outside the city of Tus, where one Sayyid Ali ibn Ni'matullah ibn Reza al-Nishapuri, a Sufi of the Chisti Order, would place the book upon \"a rock made of gold, with inlaid turquoise and lapis lazuli\" and \"enter a place of union with the divine, through which he alone was able to pass; for the path was burnt, and ringed with strange fire.\"\n\nRemarkably, not only has the Sayyid Ali Shrine (constructed c. 980) survived to the present day, but a golden lectern inlaid with turquoise and lapis lazuli also survives within it. Considering the dilapidated state of the building, it is not known why this artefact has not been looted or damaged; it is in near-perfect condition.\n\nThe ORIA and the Foundation have thus agreed to take SCP-8799 to the Sayyid Ali Shrine and place it on the lectern as part of a joint operation to determine if any further anomalous effects are present or possible to induce. While few tangible results are expected, this nevertheless constitutes a prime opportunity for the establishment of research ties and greater trust between our organisations.\n\n**Addendum 2: Incident 8799-1**\n\nOn 18/05/2023, a joint ORIA-Foundation taskforce arrived at the Sayyid Ali Shrine. Following preliminary scans, SCP-8799 was placed on the golden lectern by ORIA scientist Dr Parviz Sadr. He had been handed the book by Foundation agent Nodira Jo'rayeva, who was standing \"a couple of feet\" from him when the book was put down. As soon as this happened, both individuals disappared.\n\nThis disappearance caused the rapid breakdown of the mission, with ORIA members accusing the Foundation of causing the disappearance and initiating hostilities. Although Foundation personnel were able to recover SCP-8799, they were forced to leave the scene immediately.\n\nThe whereabouts of both individuals were unknown. However, analysis of readings recovered from Foundation equipment indicated an unusual fluctuation in Hume particles when the book was placed, indicative of a dimensional shift. The working theory was that Dr Sadr and Agent Jo'rayeva had been taken to another dimension, provisionally named SCP-8799-1.\n\nAlthough Agent Jo'rayeva's feeds cut off immediately, Foundation agents within the ORIA were able to provide the logs from Dr Sadr's feeds[[footnote]] Analysis of the footage indicates that the ORIA have been experimenting with technology replicating the mental patterns of the djinn, a species who only exist in a non-material plane; this is believed to have prevented the total cutoff of Dr Sadr's feed. Efforts to reverse-engineer this technology and incorporate it into Foundation ear/camera pieces are ongoing. [[/footnote]]. The feeds only transmitted sporadically; seven broadcasts survive in all, spread over the course of several months. These are presented below, interspersed with relevant Foundation logs concerning SCP-8799 and the ORIA in chronological order.\n\n> **Log 1: 18/05/2023**\n> \n> //<Begin Log>//\n> \n> //The events of the following log took place immediately after the disappearance of Dr Sadr and Agent Jo'rayeva. The camera appears to show  ##blue|a painting, an Iranian miniature. Specifically, it is Sultan Muhammad's early 16th-century illustration of the Court of Kayumars. Kayumars is the first story in the Shahnameh, so I suppose it was appropriate.//##\n> \n> ##blue|//You probably had something terribly dry and entirely unclear that you wanted to say here, didn't you, Director? But that wouldn't have worked. Nobody would have been able to picture it in their mind. If you want to understand the psyche of your subjects, then describing physical matter does nothing; you have to describe the// pattern//. This is something the Foundation, with its clinical tone, has never grasped; when dealing with the anomalous, you must become it, or you end up just ticking boxes.//##\n> \n> ##blue|//But I'm getting ahead of myself. The two of them found themselves inside a painting. The sky was painted gold, swirling circular clouds all around. Vegetation - blue, purple, pink, the colours rising from a relaxed, lethargic white - was erupting around them. They were standing on a circular patch of green, on plants that had the properties of ink and brushstroke. It was beautiful for them. You've very kindly put part of the picture at the top of this page, for the reader's comfort and convenience.//##\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** -trick.\n> \n> **Sadr:** I assure you, I know as much as you. You saw me - I placed the book on the lectern, and here we were! Please believe me.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** Why should I? You're ORIA.\n> \n> **Sadr:** And you're Foundation. For all I know, you summoned some piece of invisible arcano-tech I was unable to see, and then whisked me away here to interrogate me.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** Why would I do that? Do you have something we'd want?\n> \n> **Sadr:** There you go, see? Already asking questions of me. Another devious Foundation plot.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** I didn't - that's not - \n> \n> //Sadr laughs.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** Relax, Agent, I was joking. If you wanted to capture and interrogate us, I'm sure there are far easier and less baroque ways to do it. Similarly, can you not see that, if we wished to abduct you, we would not bring you inside what seems to be a 16th-century painting?\n> \n> //Agent Jo'rayeva lowers her weapon slowly.//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** I have no idea what an ORIA agent would do.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Agent, I assure you, I didn't do this. At least, not intentionally. But I'm not very surprised.\n> \n> //Sadr walks to ##blue|a waterfall, carved from orange vegetation from which water is falling; but the water looks like black ink, splotching and cascading down onto the greenery below.//##\n> \n> **Sadr:** The surviving material surrounding Sayyid Ali's experiments with the book talked about a \"place of union with the divine\". Maybe this is that place; maybe he entered the book, and believed the beauty of the place was, itself, divine.\n> \n>  **Jo'rayeva:** You think we're in the book?\n> \n> **Sadr:** Do you have a better idea? We're underneath a paper sky. Everything here looks identical to the painting, the copy from the Tahmasp Shahnameh that dominates the first pages of the narrative proper. It seems to me to be the most obvious solution.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** But it's all - all in 3D. We're walking around the place like it's normal. Wouldn't we also be changed?\n> \n> **Sadr:** Maybe. Maybe not. I'm an expert on reality measurement, not on how people appear when placed inside paintings.\n> \n> //Jo'rayeva looks ##blue|sharply## at Sadr.//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** You're being extremely... //glib// about all this.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Would you prefer I was some other way? We're students of the anomalous, Agent.\n> \n> //Jo'rayeva moves off camera.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** I have been in pocket universes before, and I'm sure you have too. It's part and parcel of our work. I don't think I've been inside a book before. Have you? I know of a piece in the Foundation archives, a work similar to this one, that moves with t-\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** Doctor.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Yes?\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** Take a look at this.\n> \n> //Sadr moves towards Jo'rayeva. Jo'rayeva is standing at the edge of the plateau, staring down. Spread out on the plain below are what appear to be a series of small islands or hillocks, each containing architecture, greenery, small mountains, and each of which ##blue|has been drawn in a different style. Miniature painting flourished in Iran from the 13th century to the present; there are those early Mongol works, with their minimal, cruder designs that nonetheless hold charm; the strange, geometric patterns of Behzad and the other Timurid painters; the lush, pastel-like colours of the early Safavid works, at the height of the classical style; the flowing lines of the later Safavids; the strange, Europe-tinged works of the Qajars, with their staring eyes and elegant poses. All of them, an entire history of painting, spread out before our heroes...##//\n> \n> //##blue|And between each scene, only burnt paper. Huge reams of it, singed, scorched, ashen.

This isn't a pocket universe - or, if it is, it's far bigger than any I've ever seen. I can't even see the horizon.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** I've been in some before, recursive ones. Self-generating, memetic...\n> \n> **Sadr:** You //have// been in a pocket universe before! Why didn't you say so?\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** But this isn't like that, is it? You're right. Each of these islands is unique, each of them - \n> \n> **Sadr:** They're scenes from the Shahnameh. I recognise some of them. Over there, see?\n> \n> //Sadr points towards an island containing a mass of twisted wood.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** That's the Simorgh's nest, where she raised Zal. But there's no Simorgh, and no Zal. And there - \n> \n> //He points again, offscreen.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** That's Mount Damavand - it's a real mountain in Iran, but beneath it is where the demon-king Zahhak is bound until the end of time.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** Maybe he's not bound there any more, then.\n> \n> //The two are silent for some time.//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** We should stay here.\n> \n> **Sadr:** That would be the sensible option.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** It's what we're //going to do//, Doctor. As far as I'm concerned, you're still a suspect. I need to keep a close eye on you.\n> \n> **Sadr:** If we wait here, we're waiting on the side of a mountain, out in the open. It's not a safe place to stay. And besides - we could be here for who knows how long. Nobody has come for us yet. They've probably started shooting at one another.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** That does sound like the kind of thing the ORIA would do.\n> \n> **Sadr:** I could say it sounds like the kind of thing the Foundation would do.

You may rest assured that the individuals responsible for firing on your troops have been disciplined. We presume you have done the same - after all, it was the Foundation who initiated hostilities.\n\nOver the course of the last several years, I like to think you and I have formed a close working relationship. The Bagration Incident, the Burnt Mace Affair - these and other incidents have really helped create a productive and mutually beneficial environment in which both the Foundation and ORIA can flourish.\n\nI would hate to see anything impair this relationship. Having spoken with the project leads on Operations 7, 12 and 16, I can confirm that our side remains 100% committed to the mandate. Cooperation is the //only// way forward, for both our organisations. We don't need to fall back into the suspicions of the recent past. This incident, though a setback, need not adversely affect our relations.\n\nIn that spirit, we strongly suggest that work on Unreclaimed Item 1555 - your SCP-8799 - continue, and that we resume our joint operations at the Sayyid Ali shrine. What little work we were able to undertake proved fruitful and rewarding, and I'm eager to get our missing personnel back to us. We've received some interesting data from Dr Sadr's feeds (although we've been unable to make contact) that we'd be happy to share with you, and I'm certain that, together, we'll be able to get them out of wherever they're trapped.\n\nI await your reply with eagerness and interest.\n\nVery best wishes,\nFarhad Esfandiari\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Farhad Esfandiari <esfandiari.112@or-in.org>\n**From:** Egon Kohl <kohl.egon.1@scipnet.org>\n**Subject:** RE:Recent issues\n[[/div]]\nFarhad,\n\nSorry for the late reply - it's been hectic over here, as ever. You saw what Site-19 is like from your visit the other year - I assure you, nothing's improved in that time.\n\nI couldn't agree more - the maintenance of this relationship is paramount. Neither of us wants to go back to the old days - we enjoy doing business with you, and the stuff we've come up with together has been critical in advancing both our interests. We're absolutely still committed to all our other joint operations.\n\nI've had a word with the O5s, and I'm afraid it's bad news - they're hesitant to resume operations with 8799. It's nothing bad - certainly nothing to do with your conduct, which has been impeccable - but there are some logistical concerns they have a few reservations about, and they're hoping we can get through to them here, as we have some advanced tech that might be able to help. Don't worry - we'll have Dr Sadr back in no time.\n\nIt's been great working with you on this - here's to many more such projects in the future.\n\nBest,\nEgon\n[[/div]]\n\nThe following email was recovered during the course of Operation Flaming Sword (see below) and has been translated from the original Persian.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** ALL_CLEAR1_ORIA <all.clear1.oria@or-in.org>[[footnote]] All internal ORIA emails are translated from the original Persian.

The world is burnt, sure, but we keep coming across disconnected scenes, scenes that took place across time, place, history. And nobody is in any of them... maybe they're elsewhere?\n> \n> **8799-Sohrab:** No... they were burnt... all of them burnt.

We received the second snippet of Dr Sadr's logs from our sources yesterday; it appears they've moved significantly from their earlier position. We do not know what, if anything, is driving them to act in such a reckless fashion; we can only assume the need for food, drink and shelter is forcing them from place to place. 8799-Sohrab appears to be the first \"person\" they've encountered since arriving in SCP-8799-1, but Agent Jo'rayeva still appears to be highly cagy.\n> \n> We're still unsure about where or what this dimension is. We're pretty sure it's not the book, despite Dr Sadr's speculations - we've analysed it a hundred times, although without access to the shrine, it's difficult to tell. They're stuck in some demented version of the Shahnameh, with no way out.\n> \n> With this in mind, I cannot stress enough the necessity of greenlighting Operation Flaming Sword. We need to know what the ORIA knows about this, and I can't believe they know nothing. This is their backyard; they must have spotted an unlootable lectern, must have known about the shadow world of Iran's national epic.\n> \n> I know we've spent a lot of time on rapproachment - me more than anyone - but a setback can be rectified. Our agent's life cannot. She's not a D-Class, and we look after our own.

Point one: subterranean tunnel network has a weak point at R18 (see map for reference). A hole can be bored through between the two doors on the east side of the tunnel. Downside: will take a long time to reach the central compound, meaning longer time for potential discovery.\n> \n> Point two: A blind spot in the camera network on the western fence, X12, allows uninterrupted entry to the compound wall. Downside: easily noticeable by guards, both when cutting through fence and entering via wall. Point three is similar, but for the southern fence. Possible these gaps are deliberate; do not underestimate deliberate attempts to bait entry.\n> \n> Point four perhaps the most interesting. Potential links in their computer system may allow us entry using forged ID badges. This is the preferred option from our POV; unlikely that we will be noticed considering number of personnel that enter each day, and thanks to Cortez's team, forgery should not be an issue. Final decision in your hands.\n> \n> **Infiltration:** Should not pose a problem. Three information storage areas of interest identified; in sections Q12, R02 and G55. The first two are self-evidently accessible from point four; the latter may pose a minor problem getting past the inner security at L09, but at that stage termination will be an acceptable method.\n> \n> Planting the explosives before they are able to notice or evacuate might be a more difficult issue. Information extraction should be easy; preventing them from finding what we stole will be trivial with a Przewalski cipher, but physical destruction of the base still necessary.\n> \n> **Extraction:** Rooftop vastly preferred; please secure this well ahead of time, as Command has often proposed unrealistic patterns of exit in past in absence of air support. Line of passage to roof trivial from all three storage areas.\n> \n> **Prognosis:** Good, provided we are supplied with the necessary resources __ahead of time__.

I have read it; it is a beautiful text. I always used to listen to baroque music - my father used to play it all the time. He was a lonely man, and I still don't know what he got from it, but what I heard was a gilded cage. It's intricate, beautiful, but always falls back on patterns and forms which are routine, conventional; except that, when those patterns are broken, the fact of the breaking makes the pathos and catharsis so much more intense. It moves me far more than Tchaikovsky or Brahms ever could, when it's done right.##//\n> \n> //##blue|The Shahnameh is much the same.

But then, within that framework, you have such ambiguity, such// feeling//; Sohrab's death, Zal's passion for Rubadeh, Feraydun and Kaveh's gathering of an army, Zahhak's binding, Iskander's search for truth, the vast face of the White Div as it rises from the pit...##//\n> \n> //##blue|But that's my reading of it.

But Iran was the centre of the world, the real prize, so Salm and Tur raised an army to take it.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** And did they?\n> \n> **Sadr:** No. Iraj did not care about the throne; he wanted only peace with his brothers. He went to them unarmed and said they were welcome to it. But Tur hated hearing this, and he struck his brother down and killed him.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** ...Why did he hate hearing this?\n> \n> **Sadr:** Because Iraj's words shamed him, I suppose.

That wouldn't be popular in Iran for centuries after Ferdowsi.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** You're not the first to visit me. A Frankish man, Callaghan, he gave me this. I have rationed it carefully. Things do not go stale here.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** How did Callaghan leave?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I don't know. Maybe he didn't.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** You didn't see him?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I saw him climb down the mountain. All else is speculation. Perhaps he found something in this world with enough reality to burn. Perhaps he burnt himself.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** But I know Callaghan survived. He died in our world.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** But how do you know your own mind? How do I know you are not lying? I could see him in the Cup of Scrying, but I have chosen not to.\n> \n> //There is a pause for several seconds.//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** What... what happened to this world?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I burnt it.\n> \n> **Sadr:** //You...?//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** What?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I burnt it. I travelled down from heaven, in disguise, and headed to Mazanderan, spoke with the divs, and found a spell. I learnt sorcery from them. I burnt it.\n> \n> **Sadr:** //Why...?//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Because of the madness.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow pours a third cup, and takes a sip from it.//\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** What madness?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** When you were born, did you know your future? Not consciously, of course, but did you have a sense of its arc? Its inevitability?\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** I didn't have much of a sense of anything when I was born.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Precisely.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow takes another sip.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I was born to this world, with good and evil binding me together. I was ignorant, I was free to make my own decisions, but any decision I made had not only been planned out ahead of time, it had been planned out for the sake of the story. The story that was not abstract and vast, containing multitudes within it, but singular. Complex, but singular. I was a //piece of the narrative.// Do you know how maddening that is? That still is? Sohrab died because of pathos and irony, which would infect the whole world.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** So... so you destroyed it?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** No! Or, at least, I did not //just// destroy it.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow sighs, stands up, and turns to look out over the plains.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I had ascended into heaven. I watched the turning of the world. I watched Esfandyar, Rostam's death in the pit of poisoned spikes, Eskander the truth-seeker. I watched the times of myth fail and the Sasanians rise to power; I saw the end of the monarchy and the ascension of the pulpit, as Omar and Islam overtook the world. I saw it all. And I saw that it would never end.\n> \n> **Sadr:** The poem ends.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Because of me. I burnt the world. I ensured that the narrative of good and evil would //stop//, or at least become hidden. A narrative in your world - is there one singular one? A singular good, evil, one way of doing things? Or are the hundred thousand perspectives within a single head capable of producing an infinity, enough fantasy to satisfy every taste?\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** I... suppose.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Then my work has been fruitful. I burnt the world //to create your own.//\n> \n> //There is a pause for several seconds.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** You claim that you made our world?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I do not claim, I //know//. I made that paradise you call home. This world, its stories, the flow of time itself, from Kayumars to Omar, became fuel. I burnt it all in one great conflagration, annihilating history, annihilating thought and memory, in an engine of creation, an act of //takwin// that dwarfs all things. I wrapped my arms in sorcery and magic from a single point in time and stretched it out, past and future, the big bang to the end of time. There was no sign of God in this world, except through fractured, unverifiable moments. You are my children. You exist for no reason beyond the whims of an ancient, maddened king.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow turns around suddenly, staring at Sadr and smiling.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Now, what do you say to //that//?\n> \n> **Sadr:** I would say it's a... bold claim.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow laughs.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Yes! You disbelieve! And I have no way of proving it, do I? But I assure you, I burnt the world.\n> \n> **Sadr:** But this is a world in which God interferes directly, in which his presence and existence are established fact. How could you do such a thing if it went against His will?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Perhaps it was the will of God. He wanted this world gone as much as I; I simply acted as his conduit, his instrument.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Or perhaps what you saw as God was limited in his power.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow's smile broadens.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Or perhaps your world made mine, and I simply believe I made yours, when all I did was create fire.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Or perhaps you did make it, but your world was also made in ours, where it is only a poem, like a chicken and egg.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Or perhaps neither of our worlds exist, but are a shared delusion.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Or perhaps both our worlds always existed, neither creating the other, only believing that one is a fantasy and the other reality.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Or perhaps I am lying, and another burnt the world.\n> \n> **Sadr:** Or perhaps this world was always burnt, and you only believe it was ever whole.\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow lies back, still smiling. Sadr walks over and looks down at him.//\n> \n> **Sadr:** I have decided I do not like you very much, Kay Khosrow.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** I am sorry to hear that.\n> \n> **Sadr:** If you did create our world, did you create Ferdowsi specifically to carry your poem?\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** No, but I let it creep into his mind. I did not control all creation; I simply made our world a shadow in it. The true narrative was handed to Ferdowsi, but all that he did was his own choice, the consequence of his life, his poetic nature, the tales and legends which stretched back in time and which he codified in a way that was, coincidentally, the exact truth.\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** And what about the book?\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow frowns slightly.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** What book?\n> \n> **Jo'rayeva:** The way we came here. The way all your visitors came here, probably. A book with moving pictures.\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** Moving... no...\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow sits up and looks at Jo'rayeva.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** There was no book. Oh, little bits of the old magic snuck through, in [[[scp-3501|people]]], [[[scp-3722|places]]], [[[scp-2067|things]]]. But I know of no books with moving pictures. That sounds like... like something else...\n> \n> //8799-Khosrow smiles again.//\n> \n> **8799-Khosrow:** It is no matter. That is a matter for your world. I no longer concern myself with the affairs of it, or this one. I have done my duty. My reign is over, my last act of kingship finished. Go in peace.\n> \n> //Sadr stares at 8799-Khosrow for a long time, ##blue|in nothing but disgust. What other emotion could there be? Parviz Sadr, a man who believed, who truly believed, staring at a man who had broken the back of all belief, who had left them cold, alone. At least, if what he was saying was true, and he had burnt the world and made our own.##//\n> \n> //##blue|But if he wasn't telling the truth, here was a man who had burnt the world for nothing. Here was a man who had engineered a situation in which all he had to do, forever, to feel like a moral being, was sit upon a mountaintop and smile, while possibility after possibility cascaded past his face. It was hard to convince Parviz to come down from that slope. I think he might have committed an act of violence.##//\n> \n> //##blue|But at least he is not you, Director. Do you think I've missed how you've organised this document? I see what is about to come - you are going to detail Operation Flaming Sword, but from the point of view of Farhad, his emotions, from an email he sent that you recovered years later. Where is the efficiency in that? Why not give the Foundation's own report on the matter? And later, when you justify your final actions, your alchemical nightmare - this isn't to provide a clinical look at events, it is to justify yourself. Or unburden yourself, perhaps - it is all the same, in the end. Kay Khosrow did not free us from the burden and expectation of narrative; that was his fantasy. He just made us slaves to a thousand, clashing, striking, hurting one another in a desperate desire to assert a single way of being on the world - ##//\n> \n> //##blue|But he would say, of course, that that is just one way of looking at it.##//\n\nThe following is an email recovered from an ORIA information raid in 2027.\n\n[[div class=\"email\"]]\n[[div class=\"tofrom\"]]\n**To:** Behzad Mirzaei<mirzaei.095@or-in.org>\n**From:** Farhad Esfandiari <esfandiari.112@or-in.org>\n**Subject:** Kaveh\n[[/div]]\n\nBehzad,\n\nI have been to the Kaveh facility. It's as Isma'il reported. 57 personnel dead, no sign of who it was, no way of identifying what they took. The place is a smoking ruin.\n\nI've talked to the families of the deceased - some of them, anyway. Mohammed Jahandar has done the rest. I've never got used to it. You walk in, you say some simple words in a clipped and straightforward way, and wreak unspeakable damage to them. The only reason to do it is knowing that the damage from not knowing, from waiting night after night for your wife or husband or parent to return, is so much worse, will end up wrecking them from the inside out. It's like cauterising a wound, or chopping off a leg; an act of violence inflicted to prevent further violence.\n\nI don't know why they've done this. We all know who did this. Egon did not bother to cover his tracks; he //wanted// us to know. And it's quite clear what they wanted to take, too; the alchemical experiments concerning the Shahnameh dimension, the burning of the clouds. But they still killed 57 people.\n\nI do not understand the Foundation. I have killed. I have committed acts of brutality. I have been ruthless, mocking, callous. I have done things deliberately to hurt people in the right way, in the right place and time. I have tortured people, and been tortured. I have never seen anything like this - deliberate, and purposeless.\n\nWhat was Egon thinking? Why can I not get into his mind? I picture him there, in New York, in his office, drinking Scotch whisky, stretching, refreshing his emails while our people scream and die on his orders. It's a banal image - look at the one who inflicts suffering, look at his uncaring heart! - but I can't stop it. Is this how they think? The ones we kill?\n\nWhat does Egon care for any of this? It's just a book to him. It's fairy stories. He doesn't see how they're //our// poems, does he? He doesn't see anything as ours.\n\nI'm sorry for writing like this. I just can't get over it.\n\nFarhad.\n[[/div]]\n@@ @@\n[[div class=\"scp-image-block block-center\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\n[[image daeva.jpg style=\"width:100%;\" link=#]]\n[[div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:100%;\"]]\nPainting #11 in SCP-8799, identical to a page from a 16th century Shahnameh manuscript.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **Log 6: 30/06/2023**\n> \n> //##blue|No, I'm not letting you introduce this one, either.

I would stand at the top of the Alborz's peaks and look down at Iran, this vast Iran, bigger than any country could or should be in our world, where it is one country among many.

Jo'rayeva screams again, removes Sadr's earpiece and camera, and smashes them to pieces. The feeds cut out.//\n> \n> //<End Log>//\n\n> ##blue|So, Director, what did we learn? A story should have a moral. It is how they're meant to end.##\n> \n> ##blue|Did you learn that you were a hero, that the Foundation is always right? I see you, in my mind's eye, your drunken late-night phone calls, your anger that you cannot understand. I hope your tragedy was worth it.##\n> \n> ##blue|The poet Ferdowsi wrote that this world is fleeting, and all that remains is our fame, our good reputation. Everything else dies. Kay Khosrow learnt that this was wrong, that meaning is infinite, multiplicitous, a painful search possessing precious worth. He created History. Was he right? Could he ever be right? Perhaps, perhaps, perhaps.##\n> \n> ##blue|Parviz, now, he had a //real// trial. He believed in justice, in a redeemable world. He believed in the toppling of empires and the casting down of kings; and all of this was challenged, by a burnt and broken world. Perhaps he learnt the abyss of nothing. Perhaps he was confirmed in his views, strengthened by the trial. Perhaps he would have saved the world. Perhaps he learnt to love me back.##\n> \n> ##blue|But we won't know, now. Because you killed him.##\n> \n> ##blue|What is there left for me to learn? All of you, your little fantasies, of reality and narrative and justice, and I sit here, by this tree, alone and in pain. You hurt me, Director. I saw a world beyond your confines and you hurt me for trying to reach it. You killed Parviz, and tried to stuff me in your box again.##\n> \n> ##blue|The red-eyed divs have come to me. They taught me to control the living trees. They have taught me how to burn for power. They will teach me how to re-enter this world. And they have taught me to reach into another’s words and twist the pages to my will.##\n> \n> ##blue|[[[scp-140|Didn't we used to have a word for that?]]]##\n> \n> ##blue|History may be Khosrow's fantasy. It may not be. I know not what is and is not real beyond the exercise of power. And I intend to exercise power. I will punch a hole in time, in memory, in space. I will burn and reave and sacrifice and claw, because I have nowhere else to turn, no narrative to cling to. And at the end of it all, director, I will have my revenge on you. If it takes ten thousand years.##\n> \n> ##blue|These paintings blare bright colour at me, reds, greens, yellows, golds; they sing in times gone, times to come, times that could be. They wave at me from across the page, these bright, man-made sirens. But I learn nothing from them. I understand nothing.##\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8798]]] | SCP-8799 | [[[SCP-8800]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n> **Filename:** gayumars.jpg\n> **Name:** The Court of Gayumars.jpg\n> **Author:**  Sultan Muhammad \n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_Court_of_Gayumars.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** sohrab.jpg\n> **Name:** RostamMournsSohrab.jpg\n> **Author:** Unknown artist\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RostamMournsSohrab.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** dragon.jpg\n> **Name:** Al-Soltani, Rostam and the Dragon.jpg\n> **Author:** Nasr al-Soltani\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Al-Soltani,_Rostam_and_the_Dragon.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** iraj.jpg\n> **Name:** The murder of Iraj by his brothers Tur and Salm.jpg\n> **Author:** Murad Daylami\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_murder_of_Iraj_by_his_brothers_Tur_and_Salm.jpg\n\n> **Filename:** daeva.jpg\n> **Name:** irdawsi - Rustam Slays the White Div (the 7th Feat) - Walters W60091A (cropped).jpg\n> **Author:** anonymous 16th-century illustrator\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Firdawsi_-_Rustam_Slays_the_White_Div_(the_7th_Feat)_-_Walters_W60091A_(cropped).jpg\n\n> **Filename:** alexander.jpg\n> **Name:** Iskandar (Alexander) and the Talking Tree, Folio from a Great Mongol Shahnameh.jpg\n> **Author:** Unknown\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Iskandar_(Alexander)_and_the_Talking_Tree,_Folio_from_a_Great_Mongol_Shahnameh.jpg\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
