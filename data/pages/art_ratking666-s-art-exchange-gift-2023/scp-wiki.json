Because I'm updating it to be more up-to-date with who I am as a person nowadays. Thanks!\n[[include info:end]]\n\n[[include component:image-block\nname=scp6777.jpg|\nwidth=700px|\nalign=center|\ncaption=I beg you! Not this time!]]\n----\n> Art Exchange has been a lot of fun. 2023 had me tasked to do an art exchange for -JP author [[*user Karathh]], who requested something involving [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6777 SCP-6777]. I was happy to oblige and wondered how it would turn out, since I don't often draw anime-stylized characters.\n\n> I ended up drawing this, which is a interpretation of the ending where Bakuu realizes her transmission has been cut off. I imagine that no matter what kind of god you are, if you're having a rough time, your panicked state will not look pretty at all. \n\n> Originally, I wasn't going to draw this article in this context. It was mostly going to be just a normal drawing of Bakuu, but while I was working on it, I kind of got carried away and started playing around with the more unsettling side of the article, which I feel is a bit underrepresented in the art of it. \n\n> I'm happy with how it turned out. It was a lot of fun to work on. I did find myself wanting to do another article by Karathh because I've really enjoyed their articles. This lead into...\n\n----\n[[include component:image-block\nname=scp-7103.png|\nwidth=700px|\nalign=center|\ncaption=Name: Gyggel Gleokg]]\n----\n> A drawing of SCP-7103! Yes, I really love this one. When I had the idea to draw this, I looked through other interpretations of SCP-7103, and I found myself a bit wondering why some didn't go for a weirder look. Since this article is inspired by 173, which has a pretty strange appearance, I wanted to make Gyggel look a bit odd too.\n\n> I gave him weird eyebrows hung up by stone lines, a funny little scared expression, and a few sculpted hairs. I'm really happy with how he turned out. \n\n> I did want to draw other articles, like [http://scp-int.wikidot.com/scp-2434-jp SCP-2434-JP], but I would probably have started overworking myself at that point. Maybe I'll draw it at some point, I really like it as well. The point is, Karathh is a really nice person and you should check out their work. Thanks for looking at my art!\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** scp6777.jpg\n> **Author:** [[*user ratking666]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Aratking666-s-art-exchange-gift-2023/scp6777.jpg SCP Foundation Wiki]\n\n> **Filename:** scp-7103.png\n> **Author:** [[*user ratking666]]\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/art%3Aratking666-s-art-exchange-gift-2023/scp-7103.png SCP Foundation Wiki]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
