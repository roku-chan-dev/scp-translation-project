Information Science, B.S. Mathematics, 19██, University of [REDACTED]; M.S. Information Science, 19██, University of [REDACTED]\n\n**Biography:** Mr. Halifax was recruited straight out of graduate school by the Foundation at a job fair in [REDACTED] and was offered a position as a staff archivist. In addition to adding, expanding, revising, and updating numerous primary and secondary SCP-related documents, he has also helped develop and implement data redundancy and disaster-recovery protocols across multiple sites.\n\n**Personal:** Mr. Halifax lives by the credo, \"A place for everything, and everything in its place.\" He is anal-retentive about organization almost to the point of compulsion, keeping himself and his office freakishly tidy, uncluttered, and well-organized.\n\nMr. Halifax tends to spend long hours in his office working on documentation, with his office sound system blaring most any type of music at high volume. Visitors are advised to ring the doorbell to his office, as knocking will most likely not be noticed.\n\n----\n\n> **Excerpt from Interview █████████**\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** Now, Mr. Halifax, about your name...\n> \n> **Mr. Halifax:** Mmm-hmmm.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** How, exactly, did—\n> \n> **Mr. Halifax:** Hippies.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** I’m sorry?\n> \n> **Mr. Halifax:** My parents were hippies.\n> \n> **Dr. ███████:** Ah. So what, um, what does your name mean?\n> \n> **Mr. Halifax:** It means that my parents were stoned out of their gourd when I was born. And when I was conceived. And the whole time before, during, and after!\n\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Quik-Inbox-040620.png|link=\"*/local--files/quikngruvn-personnel-file/Quik-Inbox-040620.png\"|align=right|caption=This was not photoshopped.]]\n\n**Primary Archivist of:**\n[[[SCP-829]]], Bloodthirsty Nail Polish\n[[[SCP-743]]], A Chocolate Fountain\n[[[SCP-153]]], Drain Worms\n[[[SCP-602]]], The Sculptor of SoHo, inspired by [[[The Loft]]], with significant contributions from [[[researcher-voct-s-personnel-file|Voct]]]\n[[[SCP-292]]], Egg Timer of Déjà Vu\n[[[SCP-027]]], The Vermin God\n[[[SCP-364]]], Ionian Drop Point\n[[[SCP-931]]], A Rice Bowl\n[[[SCP-1024]]], The Basic Set\n[[[SCP-2899]]], A Collection of Debris in the North Pacific Gyre\n\n[[[SCP-420-J]]], The Best ████ in the World, man! @@[goofy grin]@@\n[[[SCP-1013-J]]], Tree Rats @@[duck and cover]@@\n\n**Project Lead for Update and Revision of:**\n[[[SCP-241]]], __Good Home Cooking__ (original author unknown)\n[[[SCP-070]]], Iron Wings (formerly \"Razor Winged Angel\"; original author: LBD)\n[[[SCP-094]]], Miniature Event Horizon (original author unknown, first revision by [[[agent-rapp|Dave Rapp]]])\n[[[SCP-129]]], Progressive Fungal Infection (original author unknown)\n\n**Lead Editor for Documentation of:**\n[[[241-tl02|Supplemental Testing Log for SCP-241]]]\n[[[Extended SCP-420-J Experiment Log]]] @@[oh ████, not again]@@\n\n**Speculative Works:**\n[[[The Loft]]], written for [[[gears-birthday-contest-2009|Dr. Gears' birthday]]]\n[[[A Chance Encounter]]], written for [[[the-great-short-story-contest-archives|the  Post-SCPocalypse Short Story Contest]]]\n[[[Recurrence]]], written for [[[the-great-short-story-contest|the SCPs in War Short Story Contest]]]\n[[[Incident Report 334-2178]]], written for my inner Peabody, apparently\n\n**Process Documentation:**\n[[[Random But Useful]]] information that doesn't have a home elsewhere.
