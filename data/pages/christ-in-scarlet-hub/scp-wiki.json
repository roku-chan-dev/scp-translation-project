It is you who makes the Father's miracle's manifest, who beats back the corrupting miasma blown over us by the vile Serpent. For your all-consuming love, we faithful are forever in your debt.]]]//\n\n> //[[[SCP-4370|Righteous Angel, made eunuch by the blades of Canaan, lead the flock to righteousness.
