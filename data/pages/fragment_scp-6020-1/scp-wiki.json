However, following an extensive evaluation of SCP-6020-A’s beneficial properties, Bio-Unit J4-88 was subsequently expanded and re-designated as Site-171.[[footnote]] Details of Bio Unit J4-78, including the original Special Containment Procedures for SCP-6020 have been archived. They are available upon request to relevant personnel.[[/footnote]] As such, SCP-6020 and SCP-6020-A are protected from discovery or disruption by standard Foundation Site security measures.\n\nSCP-6020-A is to be maintained at a diameter of between 6,000 meters and 6,500 meters at all time, with appropriate adjustments made to gardening schedules whenever necessary. A wooded area has been planted around the perimeter of SCP-6020-A to limit the possibility of external observation. SCP-6020 itself is immobile and requires no additional physical containment. SCP-6020 has been deemed a Non-Hostile Sentient Entity (NHSE) and has proven willing to assist Foundation researchers when its mental state permits.\n\nWhile Site-171 staff members are permitted to discuss their work with SCP-6020,[[footnote]] SCP-6020 has been given a nominal Security Clearance Level of 2.[[/footnote]] it is recommended that they avoid mentioning particularly unpleasant or distressing events such as mass bloodshed or torture. Such topics have a strongly negative impact on SCP-6020’s mental well-being and can result in extended periods of non-communication. SCP-6020 should especially not be informed of incidents where the actions of the Foundation might be considered morally dubious, or have resulted in high levels of casualties or extensive suffering. SCP-6020 should not be informed of the existence or purpose of Class-D personnel. SCP-6020 has an extremely sensitive disposition, and it is believed that such revelations may damage the Foundation’s ongoing relationship with it.\n\nAny significant changes in SCP-6020’s attitude or behaviour should be reported immediately to a member of Site-171’s supervisory staff.\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**Description:**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n++++++ SCP-6020\nSCP-6020 is an parametic entity that identifies itself as “the Earth God Hepolokoli”. It is presently housed within a sandstone pillar (or “standing stone”) which measures 4.7 meters in height above ground and has a further 0.5 meters below ground. The pillar is coated with lichen and moss, and its upper area appears to have been partially eroded by weather. Two other smaller stones, measuring 4 meters and 3.8 meters in height, have been placed nearby. SCP-6020 reports that these are the remnants of 9 stones which were originally placed around its pillar.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n    name= SCPBody.png|\n    caption=SCP-6020 shortly after its initial discovery.\nSCP-6020-A has a diameter of only 7 meters.\n]]\n\nSCP-6020 professes to have been the deity of a small tribe that lived approximately 4,000 years ago. This is consistent with radiocarbon dating of human remains unearthed near the pillars.[[footnote]]Lab Analysis ID: FaM-V-5718-77 | Material Dated: bone, human //(homo sapiens)// | Calibrated date: cal BCE 2230 to 2050[[/footnote]]\n\nSCP-6020 is able to communicate through an adaptive form of telepathy, which it claims also enables it to converse with non-sapient animals and plants. So far, it has been largely cooperative with Foundation personnel. However, SCP-6020 suffers from poor mental health and is prone to long periods of silence when upset. It has found certain enquiries about its history extremely distressing, and frequently believes that Foundation personnel are asking it questions out of a sense of obligation or politeness rather than genuine interest.\n\n++++++ SCP-6020-A\nSCP-6020-A is the designation code given to SCP-6020’s range of anomalous influence. It is a roughly spherical area of space that extends outwards from SCP-6020 in all directions. Living organisms within SCP-6020-A are subject to the following anomalous effects:\n\n* Any flora planted within the soil of SCP-6020-A will grow rapidly until it has reached a state of maturity. At that point, its biological aging will abruptly slow. Flowers will grow from seeds in a matter of days and then remain in bloom for months at a time. This occurs regardless of whether or not the plants are provided with sustenance such as sunlight, water, or nutrients. Plants within SCP-6020-A also appear to be unaffected by most external factors, including climate, soil type, and disease.\n\n* The majority of sapient life forms, including all humans so far exposed to SCP-6020-A, experience increased feelings of happiness, pleasure, and contentment, and reduced feelings of anger, hatred, and hostility. Individuals struggling with mental health concerns such as stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD report that their symptoms are lessened while within SCP-6020-A. In most cases, some degree of these effects persist even after a subject leaves SCP-6020-A, with longer periods of exposure resulting in longer and more intense aftereffects. SCP-6020's influence on sapiens is especially pronounced in it's immediate vicinity. Within approximately 20 meters of it, subjects are prone to a sense of euphoria. This area is designated SCP-6020-A2.\n\nThe diameter of SCP-6020-A is determined by what SCP-6020 describes as \"acts of worship\". Providing SCP-6020 with \"worship\" will expand the size of SCP-6020, while providing it with less or no \"worship\" will cause it to contract.\n\nSCP-6020 can be \"worshiped\" by performing devotional gardening-related activities within the boundaries of SCP-6020-A. This effectiveness of this \"worship\" is completely irrespective whether the \"gardening-related activities\"  would actually be beneficial to normal flora. Activities that have been found to support SCP-6020-A's expansion include pouring buckets of water into a single patch of soil, digging holes for \"imaginary seeds\" and then filling them in again, and running a child's toy mower across the grass. Conversely, using an automated water sprinkler system did not promote expansion – although the act of installing the system did.\n\nSCP-6020 states that it does not chose what actions are counted as worshipful, but that it is able to feel if a particular action is or is not. It claims to have no personal control over the size or effects of SCP-6020-A.\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**Addendum 1 – Site-171:**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div class=\"x-log\"]]\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"top\" show=\"Level  2 clearance required – site overview\" hide=\"access granted – site overview\"]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"center no-repeat ; float: center; border: solid 2px #000000; padding: 1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 30px; box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\"]]\n\n[[=]]\n[[image logo.png width=\"140px\"]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[=]]\n+ SCP Foundation Secure Facility\n\n+++ Site-171\n\n[[/=]]\n----\n\n[[include component:image-block name=Site-171.png|align=right|caption=Part of Site-171's residential area, pictured beside the then-edge of SCP-6020-A.|width=300px]]\n\n**Site Identification Code:** JPALP-Site-717\n\n**Site Category:** B-3t\n\n**Site Director:** Chiaki Mori\n\n**Associated Task Force(s):** N/A\n\n**Capabilities:** Standard humanoid containment; standard animalia containment; sapient entity containment; specialised flora containment; standard laboratory access; botanical research; psychological research; on-site staff accommodation; psychological care\n\n**Purpose and Objective(s):** Site-171 was established primarily to take advantage of the beneficial properties of SCP-6020.

This includes both anomalous and endangered flora.\n* To provide containment for sentient anomalous entities that require mental health support, or whose hostile behaviour might be curbed by SCP-6020.\n* To provide assistance to Foundation personnel who require mental health support.

Good afternoon, Dr. Stanworth. How are you feeling today?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Oh, um, fine. Thank you very much. Fine. Um, sorry. I’m, you know, not very used to being on this side of the interview desk, as it were. Or, that side, I suppose, actually, come to think about it. Sorry, never mind.\n\n**Dr. White:** That’s quite alright. It can take a little getting used to, Now, do you think you could expand a little bit on “fine”?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Oh yes, yes, of course. Sorry. Um, I am {{[pause]}} well. In good health, or as good health as I was when I went in, I suppose. Um. As far as I can tell, there have been no negative side-effects of my time at the Honeysuckle Unit. Or none that have developed yet, I suppose I should say. Touch wood. No, you know, brains dribbling out of ears or howling at the moon so far. Hah, no, but yes. I feel fine. Distinctly fine. I mean, you know, good. Goodish, I suppose. Unwound. Refreshed.\n\n**Dr. White:** I see. And tell me, how would you describe your time in SCP-6020-A?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Oh it was, well I mean, if not //the// most pleasant experience of my life so far then definitely, you know, right up there. I can’t remember the last time I felt so relaxed. I’m not sure I ever have been. And the garden they've put in? Gorgeous! I’ve never been much of a, you know, a garden person, but palm trees, in that climate! And those beautiful big purple flowers, oh, the, um {{[pause]}} Sorry, I forget the name.

Good point. Must keep on task.\n\n**Dr. White:** Alright. So while you were in SCP-6020-A you felt, in a word, happy?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Yes? Well, I mean, yes, of course, definitely. But not, I mean, not quite in exactly the same way I’d usually think of happiness, I suppose? {{[pause]}} I’m sorry, I’m being rather confusing.\n\n**Dr. White:** No, that’s very interesting. Can you explain what you mean?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Right. Well, normally, I suppose, you, um, well get happy when something good happens, don’t you? You, I don't know, get the job you want, or eat food you like, or see a picture of some baby otters holding hands or something. Happiness is sort of {{[pause]}} put into you. But in SCP-6020-A, it’s not like that. It’s more like {{[pause]}} like going into space and finding that your body has become weightless. Not that I’ve ever been to space, you understand, but it’s how I imagine it must feel. You get outside the Earth's gravity and you suddenly realise that you’ve been living all your life with this //thing//, this weight on you, and now it’s gone. And you'd never noticed it was there at all until you feel it missing. You never {{[pause]}} You never considered that it was something separate from you, that it could be taken away while leaving you still there.

How are you feeling today?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** And an extremely good afternoon to you Dr. White. As a matter of fact, I am feeling even better than when you asked me same question yesterday. Would you like to know what I did this morning? Don't worry, I won’t make you guess. I woke up without feeling tired. Not one little bit. You know, I was beginning to think that waking up and not wanting to immediately roll over and go back to sleep was something I'd invented in childhood. But today, just bam! Up and at ‘em, what’s for breakfast? Incidentally, it was poached eggs. I don’t know if this place makes food taste better, or they've just hired some truly excellent cooks, but as eggs go these were belters.\n\n**Dr. White:** I take it that you're still enjoying your return trip to SCP-6020-A?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Immensely. Truth be told, I wasn’t much of a, you know, what's the word? Social butterfly, on my first visit. I stayed in my room for most of the day, just, well, soaking it all in, I suppose? Now I feel like I know the place a little better. I've arranged to go for a bit of a ramble after lunch with a few of the staff members. They've extended the gardens since I was last here, or the forest part I suppose, and they're going to show me the trees. There are some beautiful varieties here. Which I'd probably have said was an odd thing to say about trees before I came to visit, but it's true. My grandmother was always a tree fan. When I was growing up she was very keen that I learn the names of trees and the shapes of their leaves, but I’m afraid I was never a particularly attentive student. The only ones I still remember are Oaks, because they're everywhere, and Monkey Puzzles, because they sounded so silly. You know, I think that higher ups should give some thought to expanding this place. SCP-6020-A, I mean. Not just the Bio Unit. \n\n**Dr. White:** {{[pause]}} Expand SCP-6020-A? And what makes you think that, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Well I’m not being mind controlled by the talking rockery, if that’s what you’re worried about. But then I suppose that’s just what I would say if I //was// being mind controlled, of course, so I suppose you’ll have to decide for yourself when I get back. But this area is deserted for miles around. You could accommodate, oh, hundreds of people here, easily. And the garden could do some some room to grow. They've been testing out fruit trees. They've got apples and pears and plums and cherries so far, but it seems like you can grow anything here, from anywhere. Oh, hold on! Wasn’t there a type of banana that went extinct or something a few years ago? I'm sure I heard something like that. Do we know if anyone has any seeds left? We could bring it back with this place, start a whole new crop.[[footnote]]Dr. Stanworth is likely (mis)recalling the near eradication of Gros Michel bananas from disease in the 1950s, or recent concerns about a similar event befalling Cavendish bananas. The threat was to their industrial production, not to the persistence of their species, and as such preservation is unnecessary.[[/footnote]] Hold on, is that the right word for bananas? A crop? Or do they have some silly name like a murder of crows?\n\n**Dr. White:** I’m afraid that I’m not especially well acquainted with the particulars of banana farming, but I’m sure that your suggestions will be given due consideration when I hand in my report.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Oh goodness, I’m so sorry. You must think I’m terribly rude. Here am I blathering on about breakfast and bananas and you probably have a clipboard full of questions to ask before you can get to your lunch. Please, do go on. I won’t interrupt again.\n\n**Dr. White:** That’s quite alright. I believe this conversation has more or less covered everything I was going to ask anyway. I'll schedule our next talk for the same time tomorrow. Have a pleasant rest of your day, doctor. And thank you for your time.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** And the very same to you, Dr. White.\n\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[End Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"◆ Interview Log 6020_3 – [6020-B2-17/07/2018] ◆\" hide=\"◇ Interview Log 6020_3 – [6020-B2-17/07/2018] ◇\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{Interview Log}}\n++++++ {{6020-B2-17/07/2018}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Interviewee:** Dr. George Stanworth\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Samuel White\n\n**Foreword:** The following interview was conducted 76 hours after Dr. Standworth exited SCP-6020-A, following 168 hours of exposure.\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[Begin Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n\n**Dr. White:** Good afternoon, Dr. Stanworth. How are you feeling today.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** I'm well, thank you Dr. White. Quite well.\n\n**Dr. White:** Could you expand on that a little?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Certainly, I’ll do my best. Um, so, like before, as far as I am aware, I have suffered no negative side effects from prolonged exposure to SCP-6020-A. No one has remarked upon a change in my behaviour, except that my sister said I sounded happier on the phone, which was nice. I suppose I am, really. Thought of course it may be somewhat psychosomatic. I haven’t had a panic attack since I returned from Honeysuckle, but then it has only been three days, so I suppose I shouldn’t make any firm statements about that.  \n\n**Dr. White:** Thank you, that’s very helpful. Now, when we spoke at the beginning of last week you suggested that SCP-6020-A should be expanded, and more people should be housed within its boundaries. Are you still in favour of that?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Um, I still think it could be a good idea, yes. Following all proper evaluation and whatnot, of course. I mean, well, it's just rather nice having an anomaly that just seems to make people feel better, After all the {{[pause]}} unpleasantness we have to deal with most of the time, it just seems a waste not to make use of something that actually seems to do some good. And I do understand your position of course. I think we've all been waiting for the other shoe to drop, and Honeysuckle to start spewing forth mutant fruit trees or something. Whoever's up there doesn't usually seem very keen on giving us an easy time of things.\n\n**Dr. White:** Are you a religious man, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** {{[laughter]}} Not especially. But then I have just spent a week with an actual god, tending to a heavenly garden with a plastic lawnmower, so I suppose I should try to keep an open mind. And if SCP-6020-A really is just what it seems to be, well, why not use it, you know? I think we wretched mortals deserve a little paradise once in a while.\n\n**Dr. White:** I see. Tell me, doctor, how did you feel when it was time for you to leave SCP-6020-A? Did you feel disappointed, for example? Upset? Did you want to stay longer?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Um. Well, I think it's {{[pause]}} it's quite hard to feel disappointed by things like that, while you're up there. That stuff doesn't seem to matter all that much, when the whole world seems to be opened up in front of you. I suppose I felt {{[pause]}} content. Honestly, very content. I mean, it is lovely up there, but anywhere else can be lovely, too. Hepolokoli just makes it easier to see that.\n\n\n**Dr. White:** SCP-6020 please, for the record.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Pardon me, quite so. SCP-6020. And I mean, when I was about to come back I wasn't thinking, oh no, what happens when I leave here, am I going to be all miserable again? I was thinking, why don't I feel like this all the time? I felt ready to, well, //do// things.. It's, um, it's hard to explain. Look, do you remember what I said the first time we met? About it being hard to remember exactly how things feel to you in there? You can remember what the feeling was, but not, um, how you got there? I'm not sure if that's the best explanation, but I can't think of a better one right now.\n\n**Dr. White:** I remember.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Right. Um, but I bring it up because I think it's the same when you're inside, but the other way around. I mean, I could //remember// everything. The panic attacks, the anxiety, the, you know, bad days. But I don't think I could quite understand how those feelings worked. It's like one of those optical illusion pictures of two things in one, but once you see one of them you can't make your brain switch back to seeing the other. When I was about to leave SCP-6020-A, I don't think I really believed the bad stuff would come back. It just seemed too incomprehensible to feel that way. But, well, actually, um, no, look. There's something else but I've just realised I've been going on and on and on, and you're the one who's meant to be asking me questions. Sorry. I mean, not sorry. I mean, yes, no, I do mean sorry in this case, I’m just trying to cut down on saying sorry so much.\n\n**Dr. White:** Since your second visit to SCP-6020-A?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Well, yes and no. I mean, it’s been something I’ve wanted to stop doing for years now. But when you get into the habit of something like that it’s hard to shift. But I didn’t seem to say it at all while I was up at Honeysuckle. Well, hardly ever. So I thought, you know, while the iron’s hot and all that. I’d try extra hard to keep it going. But, I'm going off on a tangent again. Sorry. I mean, sorry, you know what I mean. Look, I'll shut up, you ask questions.\n\n**Dr. White:** It's quite alright. Everything you've provided us with has been most informative. You said there was something else?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** There was? Um, about what?\n\n**Dr. White:** You were talking about remembering, and said there was something else you wanted to tell me.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Oh, yes, of course, right. I was just going to say that, that //thing// I told you about after my first visit. The weight you think is just an inseparable part of you until SCP-6020-A takes it away. Well I still can't properly remember it, not the way I think I could in SCP-6020-A. But I'm {{[pause]}} I'm more aware of it, I think. As something that's repeatable. I can feel it like a slightly loose tooth. And yesterday, I just sat down, and closed my eyes, and for a few minutes, I think that I pushed that weight off myself. It wasn't quite like being there, back in Honeysuckle I mean, but it was something like it. \n\n**Dr. White:** Thank you doctor. That's extremely interesting. I think we might have to schedule a followup interview with someone who's a little more of a specialist than myself. \n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Of course. Any time. I mean, you know, within my schedule, of course.\n\n**Dr. White:** Of course. Can you tell me how you feel towards SCP-6020-A now? Do you want to return?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Hah, well if that’s an invitation I definitely won’t say no. But I suppose it feels a bit like a long holiday, really. Or a vacation, your lot would say. It makes for a wonderful break, but you don’t really //expect// to keep going back there every few weeks. It feels too special.\n\n**Dr. White:** I see. And how would you feel if I told that that you could not go back, ever? That I had decided to ban you from Bio Unit J4-78 because we wanted to study the effects long-term withdrawal?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Is this the part where you expect me to jump over the desk and threaten to throttle you to death with your tie unless you take me back there?\n\n**Dr. White:** Is that what you’d like to do, Dr. Stanworth?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** No, no. Just a bad joke, I promise. Poor taste. Absolutely no homicidal urges to report, I assure you. And no compulsion effect demanding my return, as far as I'm aware. In fact, quite honesty, I would have expected to feel a lot worse at the prospect of never going back than I do. But I suppose it's a bit like visiting the northern lights. You wouldn't //not// want to see them again, but it's really the first time that feels {{[pause]}} fulfilling. You know it's going to keep on existing and being admired, and you've made yourself a little part of that story.\n\n**Dr. White:** Thank you, doctor. Just two last question, then. Earlier, you mention SCP-6020 by name. Did you spend much time speaking with it? And what was your relationship like?\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Well, relationship might be a bit of a stretch. I think everyone up there spoke to it, at some point. When you get really close to it the feeling is just, you know, incredible. Euphoric. But it seems a bit rude to just stand there silently and enjoy Hep- I mean, in SCP-6020’s happy-vibe anomalous thingummy without at least saying hello. We didn’t talk all that much, quite honestly. Poor chap. We spoke a little about how he was feeling, and the garden, I believe. It kept telling me about flowers and plants on the outer edge of SCP-6020-A. I rather got the impression that it wanted me to push off. But also that it didn't, if you know what I mean. Wasn't happy being alone, wasn't happy being with others. Very, ah, familiar. As I say, poor old chap. It was all recorded, \n\n**Dr. White:** Thank you, doctor. I think we'll end things there. You have been most helpful.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Very glad to be of service.\n\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[End Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"x-log-head\"]]\n+++++ {{**Interviews with SCP-6020**}}\n[[size 85%]]{{**Preface**: SCP-6020 speaks through a form of telepathic projection and as such cannot be recorded with audio equipment.

I hope that you’re doing well today!\n\n**SCP-6020** {{[silence]}}\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Would it be alright if we had a conversation?\n\n**SCP-6020** You do not have to speak to me, you know. \n\n**Dr. Alderman** I know I don't //have// to, but I’d really like to talk to you. Wouldn’t you like to talk to me?\n\n**SCP-6020** No.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Well I'm sorry to hear that, and I apologise if I've done anything to upset you. If you wouldn't like to talk with me, we could get Mark instead. The guy you spoke to yesterday?\n\n**SCP-6020** No. No, you have done nothing. I simply have no desire to burden you further. Any of you.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Talking to me wouldn't be a burden, it would be a favour. Please, Hepolokoli? It would really, really help me out.\n\n**SCP-6020** {{[long silence]}} Very well.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Thank you so much, that really means a lot! So, um, I’m going to ask you some questions, if that’s OK, and my friend here is going to write some of the things you say down. Some of them may be questions you’ve answered before, but we’d really like to get them down on paper for our records, in your own words.\n\n**SCP-6020** I do not have my own words.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Oh? Well, uh, hold on a sec, I wrote these down somewhere because I knew they'd feel terribly unimportant when I was here. OK, right. All ready Aj? So, first of all Hepolokoli, you describe yourself as a god, is that right?\n\n**SCP-6020** No. Your kind describes me as a god. I do not {{[pause]}} think the way you do. I do not think in labels. Words. Language. I speak with you by finding the words in your minds. Your word for what I am is god. {{[pause]}} Pathetic, miserable little god.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Well hey, I would certainly never call you pathetic.\n\n**SCP-6020** Then you do not yet understand.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Maybe not. There’s lots of things I’d love to understand about you. Could you tell me when you were born? Or, started to exist.\n\n**SCP-6020** That is {{[pause]}} complicated. You would not understand.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Try me.\n\n**SCP-6020** You would not understand. You do not have the words to describe it. None of you do. \n\n**Dr. Alderman** Please. You can dumb it down for me. Even if I don’t understand all of it, I’d still really like to hear you tell me what you can. Honestly, it's fascinating learning about you.\n\n**SCP-6020** {{[long silence]}} I was {{[pause]}} begun here, a very long time ago. A woman came to this place. Hungry, and thirsty, and tired. And she prayed as she walked to all that was around her. She begged the air and the trees and the sun and the soil for food. And just here, she found it.  and here she found it. Bushes of black fruit. You do not have a name for them. She knelt, and ate, and thanked the earth beneath her feet for the miracle. To her, the bushes had seemed to sprout from the soil at her request. She left, and when she returned, she brought more people. They ate. They settled. And soon, they brought the stones. They began me and moulded me and named me. Hepolokoli. God of earth, god of soil, the immortal, the life-protector, the fruit-giver. They wove me out of dance and song and prayer. And belief. So much belief. And yet {{[pause]}}. And yet, once they had done so, once I had a mind to think with, I immediately understood that I //had// always been here, that I //would// always be here. I //had// been the one to tug upon the wind and bring the fruit seeds. I had bent the earth to bring them water, spread the trees to give them light. It had been I, Hepolokoli, that had brought forth fruit for the woman after all. I began on the day she visited my soil, but I existed then at all times, from the very start to whatever may come after. My people were right to believe in me. They believed that I tended their plants, chased away their sorrows, cleansed their pain. And so I did. {{[pause]}} I was vain. Pathetic, wretched little god.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** But that sounds lovely! You brought them what they wanted. Why does that make you pathetic?\n\n**SCP-6020** I am tired.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** Please, Hepolokoli. Help me to understand.\n\n**SCP-6020** No. No. I am ashamed. So very ashamed. {{[pause]}} I am tired now.\n\n**Dr. Alderman** I'm sure it couldn't have been all that bad. And not here, of all places.

But I do not deserve to. It sullies them.\n\n**Dr. Sax:** I think everyone deserves to miss the people that they’ve loved.\n\n**SCP-6020:** No. It could not have been love.

But you're definitely not the first patient who's said that to me when we first met, and I'm sure you won't be the last. Its completely understandable to be skeptical, especially when you're coming from a very unique set of circumstances. But I have rather a lot of experience supporting patients with unique circumstances. I can't make you any promises, but what do you say we give it a go? You never know, it might surprise you.\n\n**SCP-6020:** It will not. You do not have to waste your time. I am sorry to have troubled you.\n\n**Dr. Shann:** Waste my time? Not at all, not at all.

And all this is because of //you//. Magnificent. And don't you see? You have eternity to //figure all this out//.

What is there, when you really think about it, to be so down about?\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[pause]}} A world, rotting beyond my boarders, The bones of my people. The failure I regret every moment of this endless existence-\n\n**Dr. Shann:** {{[interrupting]}} No, no, I do understand all that, believe me. I've had so many regrets too, so many questions about whether I was making the right choices in life.

The offer was emphatically declined.\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"◆ Interview Log 6020_7  – [6020-A1-21/06/2018] ◆\" hide=\"◇ Interview Log 6020_7  – [6020-A1-21/06/2018] ◇\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{Interview Log}}\n++++++ {{6020-A1-21/06/2018}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6020\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. George Stanworth\n\n**Transcriber:** Dr. Eva Kelly\n\n**Foreword:** The following is a spontaneous conversation between SCP-6020 and Dr. George Stanworth, a visiting Founation researcher with a history of mental health difficulties. Dr. Stanworth had been enjoying the intensity of SCP-6020-A's effect while standing beside SCP-6020.\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[Begin Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Hello, SC- I mean, Hepolokoli.\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[silence]}}\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** How are you feeling today? If you don't mind me asking, of course.\n\n**SCP-6020:** You do not wish to know.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** I do! I mean, that's why I asked. \n\n**SCP-6020:** You are being polite. It is unnecessary.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** I don't think that politeness is ever really unnecessary, you know. My grandmother certainly said so. But then you should have heard the things she used to say about Nancy Baker at number 22. {{[laughter]}}\n\n**SCP-6020:** Ah. Deception. Your kind have the ability to delude themselves in order to be happy. You are very fortunate.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** I'm not sure that's how I would put it, but I certainly feel very fortunate to be here. Really, Hepolokoli, tell me how you're doing.\n\n**SCP-6020:** It would only upset you.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Well, first of all I'm not sure if I //can// be upset here. But if it does upset me, then that would rather blow your theory about us not caring about you out of the water, wouldn't it?\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[silence]}}\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Aha, got you there, haven't I? Not that being logical tends to help when you're, you know, going through this type of stuff. At least, that's how I remember it. I always hated when people tried to be obnoxiously logical about everything. Even if I can't quite remember what was so unpleasant about it. {{[pause]}} I do understand, you know. What it's like, I mean.\n\n**SCP-6020:** You do not. You cannot begin to conceive of it.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Well, I suppose I can't know what its like specifically for you. Even if I could remember exactly what it felt like for me. But I know I've felt something similar.\n\n**SCP-6020:** Have you? Have you spent thousands of years in solitude? In regret? Surrounded only by the remnants of your failure, the victims of your inferiority. Every moment weighed with the guilt of your worthlessness and the knowledge that all of this shall never, ever end.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** No. No, you have me beaten there. Although, aha, life with my father might have been a close run thing. But that's in the past now. And we can't be ruled by the past forever.\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[silence]}} You enjoy the flowers here. There are new flowers in the east, by my border.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** {{[pause]}} I'm sorry, that wasn't very empathetic of me, was it? I'm afraid, you know, this place. Being this close to you. It makes it hard to {{[pause]}} understand some things. No, you are quite right, and I apologise unreservedly.\n\n**SCP-6020:** The trees in the west have grown since this morning. They have three hundred and forty-four new leaves. You will find them interesting.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Hepolokoli, I can't talk about what you've been through. But the feelings of, well, of misery, of self-hatred, of depression. That //is// something I've known. Something a lot of us have known. Especially the people who come here. What I mean is, just, well, I don't want you to think you're alone in all this.\n\n**SCP-6020:** I am alone. I am always alone. I am not like you. You have hope.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Yes. Right now. But only because you gave it to me, Hepolokoli.\n\n**SCP-6020:** No. Not that. Your kind. You stop. You have endings. No matter what you endure, you have the hope of it stopping. You are safe from eternity.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** You mean death?\n\n**SCP-6020:** Yes. Death. Finality. Cessation.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Do you want to die?\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[pause]}} It has been such a very, very long time since I last wished to be alive. I am tired. So tired of my punishment.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Your punishment?\n\n**SCP-6020:** I do not deserve to cease. I deserve this. It is my fault.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** That's not {{[pause]}}. Sorry. I mean, why do you think you deserve to feel this way?\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[pause]}} The fruit trees are heavy again. You will enjoy the apples.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Alright, I won't pry. But I mean {{[pause]}} Well, look, obviously no one here wants you to die, but are you so certain you're going to around forever? What would happen if the garden was gone? Or your stone was broken?\n\n**SCP-6020:** Then I would no longer be able to speak, or to see, but I will remain here, just the same. My people wanted an immortal god. That, at least, I have done right.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** I'm so sorry. But there must be something we can do to help you?\n\n**SCP-6020:** {{[pause]}} There are White Egret orchids in bloom in the south. I am told they are most beautiful.\n\n**Dr. Stanworth:** Yes, yes, right. You're right. {{[pause]}} Um, look, I really don't want to leave you, or for you to think that I'm leaving because of you, but this spot is {{[pause]}} I think I'm getting a little too buzzed out. And if I stay here and keep talking, I'm going to start telling you that things aren't really so bad when you think about it, and I still have enough sense to know what a horrible thing that is to hear. So, I'm going to go, but, I don't know, can I do anything for you at all? Get anyone?\n\n**SCP-6020:** No thank you, doctor. Goodbye. I {{[pause]}} am glad that you enjoy the garden.\n\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[End Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"◆ Interview Log 6020_8  – [6020-A1-09/05/2021] ◆\" hide=\"◇ Interview Log 6020_8  – [6020-A1-09/05/2021] ◇\"]]\n\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; border:dashed 1px #999999; background:#F5F5F5; float:center; width:84%; padding:1px 15px; margin: 10px 10px 10px 40px\"]]\n----\n[[=]]\n+++ {{Interview Log}}\n++++++ {{6020-A1-09/05/2021}}\n[[/=]]\n----\n**Interviewee:** SCP-6020\n\n**Interviewer:** Dr. Monica Gail\n\n**Transcriber:** Dr. Ajda Buchanan\n\n**Also Present:** Dr. Lisa Chu\n\n**Foreword:** The following conversation took place after 27 days of non-communication from SCP-6020. A trigger for this behaviour has not been determined. Staff members had been visiting SCP-6020 each evening to attempt to speak with it. On this occasion, SCP-6020 called out to doctors Gail, Buchanan, and Chu as they approached it. This is the first and so far only occasion on which SCP-6020 has initiated communication.\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[Begin Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n\n**SCP-6020:** Take the bones away. \n\n**Dr. Gail:** Hepolokoli? What’s wrong? \n\n**SCP-6020:** Please, take the bones away. I cannot bear them. I cannot hold them.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** It’s OK. Hey, hey, hey, it’s OK. We can take the bones. What’s happened, Hepolokoli?\n\n**SCP-6020:** Wretched! Miserable! Weak! I do not deserve them!\n\n**Dr. Gail:** Hepolokoli, please calm down. We’re here to help you.\n\n**SCP-6020:** No! You still do not understand. If you understood you would despise me. I cannot be helped. I should not be helped. Take the bones from me.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** We can get people to dig them up right now, OK? Lisa, look, tell Aidan what’s going on.\n\n//{{Dr. Chu leaves}}//\n\n**SCP-6020:** Too late!\n\n**Dr. Gail:** They’ll be here soon, I promise.\n\n**SCP-6020:** It’s all too late. Nothing but bones. You all leave me. I hate them for leaving me behind. Wretched things. Wretched bodies. Wretched, wretched god.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** What’s happened, Hepolokoli? We want to help- I mean, to do whatever it is you need from us, but you have to tell us what’s wrong. Please?\n\n**SCP-6020:** Miserable, worthless god. Make the plants grow. Make the children smile. Make the pain less. Silly little god. It was nothing. Nothing. I could not shake mountains. I could not make the wind carry more than seeds. I could not turn a spear, or knife. I could not break a strand of their hair.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** Whose hair?\n\n**SCP-6020:** I could have given them food. All the food, had they wanted.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** Who are you talking about? Your people?\n\n**SCP-6020:** No. {{[pause]}} No. They came for my people. Broke their skulls. Tore their skin. My happy, trusting people.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** Hepolokoli, I’m so sorry.\n\n**SCP-6020:** Do not pity me! Loath me! Hate me! It's my fault! All of this. They came to me and I killed them. My people. When the killers came, they ran to me. To my fruit and flowers and stones. They could have scattered into the forests but they came to me instead, and prayed and sang and knelt in the soil as they were hunted. They believed I could save them. They asked their silly little fruit-giver, life-blesser, their miserable, stunted god, to turn aside the invaders, to save their land. They begged me. They begged as they were cut and smashed to pieces, right in front of me. They would not run, because of me. And all I could do was to make them smile. Despicable. All gone. All smiling. All my fault.\n\n//{{Several researchers begin to approach with shovels.}}//\n\n**SCP-6020:** No! No! Leave them. Leave them alone. I deserve them. Leave the bones. Let them hurt me. Let them hurt.\n\n**Dr. Gail:** Hepolokoli, we won't touch them if you don't want us to, but would it help to have them gone for a little while?\n\n**Dr. Buchanan:** We can always put them back later?\n\n//{{SCP-6020 refused to resume conversation.}}//\n\n----\n= [[size 135%]]**[End Log]**[[/size]]\n----\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n\n------\n[[=]]\n[[size 125%]]**Addendum 3 – Dr. Nasmyth's Proposal:**[[/size]]\n[[/=]]\n------\n\n[[div style=\"color: black; border: solid 1px #000000; background:#e7f7fb url(https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/the-great-hippo/scp_trans.png) center no-repeat; padding:1px; margin-bottom: 10px;box-shadow: 5px 4px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2); \"]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 104%]]__NOTICE FROM THE FOUNDATION RECORDS AND SECURITY ADMINISTRATION__[[/size]]\n\n//All information pertaining to Dr. Nasmyth's Proposal has been removed from this page.\nAuthorised personnel may continue to access this information via the the [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6020/offset/1|O5 Proposal Database]]].//\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[footnoteblock]]",
