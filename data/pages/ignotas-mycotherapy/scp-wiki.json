The attic is mostly empty apart from a desk sitting just below the circular window looking out the front of the house as you reach it.\n\nThere's less of that neon-colored fungus here and a strange sag in the center of the attic where the weight of //something// heavy sat atop it at one point. You step around it, fearing it may not be able to support your weight.\n\nYou know you aren't welcome here. You climbed up the ladder without asking.\n\n Sticky notes with scrawled writing cling to the wall behind the desk. There are several empty energy drink cans on the desk and the laptop is open to a browser you don't recognize with some strange URL made up of jumbled letters at the top. The site looks like something the person who was looking at it wasn't supposed to see.\n\nYou swear for a moment you could hear a low guttural growl shake the room.\n\n+++ [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/art:art-mycotherapy >Go to the Waiting Room?]\n+++ [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/ignota-s-mycotherapy >Go to the Office?]\n+++ [https://wanderers-library.wikidot.com/art-mycotherapy >Go Outside?]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div style=\"border-radius: 10px;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-position: center;\nborder:solid 2px var(--accentColor);\npadding:15px;\noverflow: hidden;\nmargin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n++ Bookmarked Tabs\n[[div class=\"divcontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"divimg1\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/WV1edVu.gif alt=\"SCP-5584 by IronShears\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-5584 SCP-5584: Griefing]\n> \"The reason for its absence was described by SCP-████ as an event resulting in it \"constantly being watched\".\n> \n> The full archive of all data taken from accounts connected to SCP-████ is available on request from Dr. Riley Ellis.\"\n> \n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"divimg1\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/lKjDjzv.png alt=\"SCP-6634 by IronShears\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-6634 SCP-6634: where the flood couldn't reach.]\n> --\"Due to minimal risk and the breathability of the atmosphere, only small teams with minimal equipment are necessary.--\n> \n> So much for that.\"\n> \n> (This is an HTML5 game you can play.)\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div style=\"border-radius: 10px;\n  background-repeat: no-repeat;\n  background-position: center;\nborder:solid 2px var(--accentColor);\npadding:15px;\noverflow: hidden;\nmargin-bottom: 15px;\"]]\n\n++ Writings Scribbled onto Sticky Notes\n\n[[div class=\"divcontainer\"]]\n[[div class=\"divimg1\"]]\n[[image https://i.imgur.com/SgDCywV.png alt=\"Kuobach's Eyes by IronShears\"]]\n[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/kuobachs-eyes Kuobach's Eyes]\n> \"Well… there's a thought that happens when you're healing.
