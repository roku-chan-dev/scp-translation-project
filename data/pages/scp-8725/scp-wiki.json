Image taken prior to SCP-8725.]]\n\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-8725 is the designation assigned to the event resulting in the loss of an unknown aspect (SCP-8725-A) of Junior Researcher[[footnote]] Prior to ██/██/████, Everwood was a Foundation PhD candidate operating under Director Emily Adler. [[/footnote]] Jay Everwood (SCP-8725-B) following interaction with an unknown entity during a containment breach on ██/██/████ in Site-55.\n\nAs a result of SCP-8725, SCP-8725-B is unable to speak of how she lost SCP-8725-A, and the aforementioned claims to possess no memory of the event. Additionally, as a result of SCP-8725, SCP-8725-B was able to finish her Foundation PhD. When exposed to footage from SCP-8725[[footnote]] See Addendum 8725.1. [[/footnote]], SCP-8725-B claims she is unable to perceive it.\n\n**Addendum 8725.1:**\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n**Foreword:** The following is a log from the Site-55 Personnel Offices, where Everwood was conducting her thesis research. At this point in the recording, the localized breach of SCP-████, SCP-████, and SCP-████ had been ongoing for approximately 4 minutes and 32 seconds. A shelter in place order had been issued for all research personnel, and Everwood was alone in her office. \n-----\n@@@@\n= **<BEGIN LOG>**\n\n//[Everwood is sitting underneath her desk, hiding. The Site alarm blares in the background, warning of a containment breach.]//\n\n**Everwood:** God damn it.\n\n//[Thirty seconds pass. The alarm continues.]//\n\n//[[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] enters the room, slamming the door shut behind them.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Who's there?!\n\n//[Everwood crawls out from underneath the desk.]//\n\n**Everwood:** What, like Odysseus? Haha, very funny. I assume you're with security?\n\n//[Everwood stands and turns to face the door.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Holy shit, what the hell happened to your arm?\n\n//[Everwood approaches [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] and puts an arm around them. She helps them towards the desk.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Okay, so you can't tell me who you are, or what happened to your arm. I get it. Working this job, I have accepted the fact there are things I am not meant to know.\n\n//[Everwood moves things from her desk and allows [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] to sit on top of it.]//\n\n**Everwood:** But I am only helping you out of basic human decency. You would do the same for me, right?\n\n//[[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] lays down on the desk.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Okay. So tell me what you need. Aside from like, a medical doctor. \n\n//[Everwood opens the first aid kit in the office, grabbing gauze.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Huh?\n\n//[Everwood drops the gauze, her jaw agape.]//\n\n**Everwood:** ...\n\n//[[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] sits up.]//\n\n**Everwood:** N-no. How did you even know that? \n\n//[Everwood steps back.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Fine. You got me. But it's not that I hate myself, I just don't know that I feel like myself. Or rather that I don't know myself.\n\n//[Everwood folds her arms.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Yeah. Like I'm not genuine. Like everything I do is a farce. Ever since I was a little girl, I didn't get it, and it's only gotten worse the older I get.\n\n//[[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] gesticulates.]//\n\n**Everwood:** Fine. I'll do it. But in exchange, I want to know everything there is to know about you.\n\n//[Everwood steps forward.]//\n\n**Everwood:** You have a deal.\n\n//[[[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] glows. SCP-8725-A disappears and [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]], now with both arms, puts a hand on Everwood's shoulder, thanking --her-- them. [[span style=\"filter: blur(8px);\"]]The Presence[[/span]] opens the door and waves to Everwood before leaving, shutting the door behind --them-- her. As this happens, Everwood falls to the floor, unconscious.]//\n\n\n= **<END LOG>**\n[[/div]]\n@@@@\n[[div style=\"border: dashed 2px #b00010; border-radius: 10px; min-height: 116px; width: 400px; margin: 0 auto; padding: 0 20px; background: #fcfcf0 url(/local--files/heritage-collection/hatch-black10i.png); color: #331010;\"]]\n[[=]]\n++ __NOTICE__\n\nThis file has been flagged as memetically tampered-with.
