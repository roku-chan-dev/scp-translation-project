All attempts to do so are to be postponed indefinitely. SCP-6051's movements are to be observed via satellite, while Foundation monitoring stations within Siberia are to monitor for any abnormally low-temperature shifts in the region. \n\nIn the event SCP-6051 is observed moving towards a populated area, MTF-Epsilon 6 \"Village Idiots\" are to intercept and draw SCP-6051 back into a more sparsely populated area. In the event, this fails, and SCP-6051 does enter a populated area, MTF Epsilon-9 \"Fire Eater\" and MTF Pi-1 \"City Slickers\" are to be deployed to force SCP-6051 to flee. All witnesses are to be amnesticized and a cover story regarding freak snowstorms is to be circulated through the media. \n\n**Description:** SCP-6051 is a humanoid entity formerly known as Senior Sergeant Viktor Kuznetsov of the 3rd Guards Rifle Division. The entity is 6ft3 in height and suffers from severe albinism. Despite being born in 1911, SCP-6051 has not shown any visible signs of ageing since 1941. SCP-6051 possesses potent cryokinetic abilities. SCP-6051's internal body temperature has been recorded to be as low as −5°C.[[footnote]]23°F[[/footnote]] SCP-6051 is capable of lowering the temperature of its immediate surroundings to −50°C.[[footnote]]-58°F[[/footnote]] With concentration, this effect can be amplified to being able to almost instantly freeze an object or individual within one mile and when within SCP-6051's line of sight. \n\nSCP-6051 effects can be hampered and even completely stopped with high temperatures. According to GRU-P testing, temperatures of 600-800°C[[footnote]]1112-1472°F[[/footnote]] or less did little to impede SCP-6051's capabilities. Temperatures of 1000°C[[footnote]]1832°F[[/footnote]] were shown to be effective as slowing down SCP-6051, though this could be overcome given enough time and concentration on the part of SCP-6051. Only temperatures of 2204°C[[footnote]]4000°F[[/footnote]] and above were capable of completely stopping SCP-6051 in its tracks. \n\n**Addendum-6051-1:** __History and Origin of SCP-6051__\n\nBelow is a collection of GRU-P[[footnote]]For information on the operations and origin of the GRU-P please consult files on [[[http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/gru-p-hub|GOI-16]]].[[/footnote]] documents that were provided by the GRU-P during the initial containment efforts of SCP-6051. These documents outline the history of Project: Red Flea, which created SCP-6051, though most of what was related to the creation of SCP-6051 was destroyed in 1948.\n\n> **{{@@OSI \"SILENT NIGHT\"\t\t\t\t\t DIVISION \"P\" DEPARTMENT II@@}}**\n> **{{@@APPROVED 11.III.1935 PRINTOUT NR: 1@@}}**\n> **{{@@SIGNED .................. \t\t\t\t\t@@[[size larger]]S[[/size]]}}**\n> **{{@@DEPARTMENT HEAD III-P-9-GRU                 D.NR: 14-III-1936@@}}**\n> {{**RESPONSIBLE PERSONNEL:** Mefodiy Kuzmin к.т.н.[[footnote]]PH.D[[/footnote]]}}\n> {{**DETAIL:** OSI \"SILENT NIGHT\" is the designation of a previously unknown Vila [[footnote]]Equivilent to a 'Fairy' in western cultures[[/footnote]], which has been frequently sighted and documented by both high and low ranking military personnel over the last century.

Analysis of the footage indicated they died of frostbite. EP-9 Daniels and Pushkin open fire upon SCP-6051 with limited effect. EP-9 Pushkin throws a Thermite grenade which detonates and causes SCP-6051 to flee.//\n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** That should keep him at bay. Got a plan, Pushkin?\n\n**EP-9 Pushkin:** If we're quick, maybe we can make a break for it.\n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** Into Siberia? \n\n**EP-9 Pushkin:** Got a better idea?\n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** Ready when you are. \n\n//Before this plan could be executed, SCP-6051 returned and activated its anomalous properties, killing EP-9 Pushkin and gravely wounding EP-9 Daniels with his death only averted due to the timely burning of Thermite.//\n\n**SCP-6051:** That will not last long, we should talk before it runs out. There is not much else we can do while we wait. \n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** You don't have to do this. You'll be safe with us. \n\n**SCP-6051:** I gave you a chance to leave, but you did not take it. Regardless, being locked up in a room for the rest of my existence? I have no intention of being sealed away again. Not that you can but this saves us all time and manpower. \n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** If you want to be left alone, why are you attacking us? You can just as easily force us to leave. \n\n**SCP-6051:** Why does fire burn? Or water drown? Simply a side effect of too much of it. I cannot control that. \n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** Then what do you want?\n\n**SCP-6051:** Your Foundation wants to put me in a box because they fear I will turn into a monster and plot world domination. I have no such grand plans. //At this point SCP-6051 changes its gaze and looks towards the camera on the transport.// I'm sure you have read up on Red Flea. I did not storm the Kremlin or the White House. I do not belong anywhere but here. You can continue to try and contain me, costing you greatly in money and men. Or you can simply allow me to remain where I belong, and I promise not to take one step in any of man's cities. If I break this promise, you may deploy all the Napalm you want on me. \n\n**EP-9 Daniels:** So what? You want to be left alone?! That's it?!\n\n**SCP-6051:** In short? Yes. I see that Thermite is almost gone, this was delightful, I don't often manage full conversations. It is a shame we cannot keep talking. I bid you, прощание.[[footnote]]Farewell in Russian[[/footnote]]\n\n//As the cold weather intensifies, the recorder's view is blocked by the snow until the footage cuts out.//\n\n[END LOG]\n\n**Closing Statement:** While it is in theory possible to eventually secure SCP-6051, given the manpower and financial costs of failed attempts to do so, along with the fact it is effectively self-contained within the Siberian wilderness, this has been deemed unnecessary. It is ruled that containment protocols would be updated to observe SCP-6051 rather than attempt to capture, through direct intervention is to remain an option if containment were to be breached. - Dr Vasily Kuzmin, head of SCP-6051 research.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-6050]]] | SCP-6051 | [[[SCP-6052]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[include component:license-box]]\n[[include component:license-box-end]]",
