The 247^^th^^ sample is under indefinite evaluation at the Site-87 research facility. Due to natural degradation, location, and/or several decades of nuclear testing conducted by the USSR, further containment of SCP-7307-1 is deemed unnecessary.\n\nAll media containing depictions of SCP-7307-2 has been expunged from public record. --An agreement between the Foundation, Roscosmos, and NASA has been reached to classify the existence of SCP-7307-2.

These objects spontaneously appeared in Semipalatinsk, Kazakhstan starting on 1945/06/16 and ending on 1975/11/24. Analysis of core samples indicate that all SCP-7307-1 instances originate from Semipalatinsk, but did not form from existing materials found at the location. The sites at which each SCP-7307-1 instance was discovered, as well as each core sample tested, registered a unique concentration of Boerhiemer Radiation[[footnote]] A type of radiation typically associated with extra-universal contiguity and/or displacement.[[/footnote]], indicating a probable extra-universal origin for these phenomena. An additional 143 SCP-7307-1 instances were detected and are theorized to exist 4.8 km underground in the Archuleta Mesa near Dulce, New Mexico. \n\nSCP-7307-2 is a 3.4 km ovaloid structure consisting of various inorganic and organic components including but not limited to: sand, metal, fauna, asphalt, concrete structures, substratum, flora, glass, and wood. SCP-7307-2 is surrounded by a cloud of oxygen, nitrogen, helium, natural gas, propane, water vapor, and approximately 26,000 human corpses. \n\n--SCP-7307-2 is currently orbiting Earth approximately 400,000 km from the Exosphere and has a trajectory which will eventually remove it from Earth's gravitational influence; estimated to occur between 1970-1980.-- On 1974/02/23, SCP-7307-2 was incinerated by the Sun and no longer exists. Samples collected by a Foundation probe prior to its incineration indicate the place of origin to be Hiroshima, Japan circa 1940-1950.\n\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-7307/SCP-7307-2.png\n| caption= SCP-7307-2, circa 1965.\n| width=100%\n| height=20%\n| align=center]]\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block\n| name=http://smlt.wikidot.com/local--files/drakimoto:prelude/SCP-7307-3\n| caption= Perspective view of SCP-7307-3.\n| width=60%\n| align=left]]\n\nSCP-7307-3 is the island of Cuba, including topsoil, flora, fauna, structures, ~7 million humans, and substratum; compressed into a complex array of non-euclidean overlapping cubes that is partially embedded in the bedrock of the Atlantic ocean.

Upon arriving at Kustanay station, Sultanov contacted Soviet military command and explained the phenomena. On 1945/06/18, a Soviet military convoy and several scientists arrived to investigate the SCP-7307-1 instances. Though initially considered to be some form of German subterfuge, the response team was unable to definitively ascertain its origin. Two weeks after its initial discovery the Foundation was contacted by a liaison within the Kremlin to assist with the investigation and concealment of the phenomena. In accordance with the Beria Compromise[[footnote]]USSR, Foundation.[[/footnote]], the USSR officially took control of nearly 18,000 km² of land surrounding the initial instance to be used in the Soviet atomic bomb project. The Foundation was regularly updated on the SCP-7307-1 phenomena until its conclusion in 1975.\n\nSCP-7307-2 was initially detected by researchers at the Alabaster-Reece Observatory[[footnote]] A Foundation installation located on O‘ahu, Hawaii. [[/footnote]] on 1950/04/14, though visual confirmation could not be ascertained until 1952/11/26. In conjunction with visual confirmation, the distinct Boerhiemer Radiation associated with SCP-7307 was registered and Project Lighthouse began its investigation. Though discovered in 1950, it is theorized, based on the extent of radioactive decay, that SCP-7307-2 originally entered Prime Reality shortly after the SCP-7307-1 instances began to appear.\n\nOn 1962/10/18, Atlantic Research Substation 4 detected a surge in Boerhiemer Radiation 3.6 km from the Puerto Rico Trench. Due to the Cuban missile crisis[[footnote]]1962/10/16 to 1962/10/29[[/footnote]], Foundation facilities in North and Central America were operating under emergency standby procedures and could not immediately investigate the disturbance. Subsequent to the conclusion of the crisis, Project Lighthouse in conjunction with the crew of the USS //Morpheus// began a three-month excavation and exploration of SCP-7307-3.

Though limited in primary resources, Project Lighthouse has learned of several deviations in human history, specifically surrounding the actions of the USSR and United States of America, including their inability to achieve nuclear fission. The heightened political instability between these two countries, as well as the open use of anomalous weapons, has led to Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25 being deemed a potential threat to Prime Reality. \n\nProject Lighthouse speculates that a series of events leading to mutually assured destruction within Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25 would instantaneously initiate a XK-Class End-of-the-World Scenario on Prime Earth.\n\n@@ @@\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"addenda-header\"]]\n++++ **__Project Lighthouse Report Summary -- 1968__**\nOn 1968/01/12 12:32 GMT, local reality sensors at Site-51 alerted Project Lighthouse liaisons to a surge in Boerhiemer Radiation[[footnote]] Specifically, the unique signature associated with Universe 11.5.14.14.5.4.25.
