Our team chose Captain Ahab from Merville's Moby Dick.\n\nThe series itself follows the Ortothan Fae having fled from the Fae Empire to the moons of Uranus finding themselves eons later in a Space Race with the Yeren's Whaleships in the past, and Isma's attempts to uncover the story of Ahab and the white whale of that Space Race in the present.\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n> **Filename:** Sirius.png, derived from Sirius_A_and_B_artwork.jpg\n> **Author:** Original by NASA, ESA and G.
