I'm not the most prolific or skilled artist, but I sure have some things to show, even if they are not as wonderful as I wanted them to be. I was really thinking if I should create that and the idea that I could reunite some feedback on my things by doing this convinced me to finally do this.\n\nMost of my work is digital art as I don't have anything SCP-related made on paper yet. It will probably change as I return to drawing and creating things!\n\n------\n\n++ My stuff\n\n[[tabview]]\n[[tab Art for my things]]\n\n\n+++ SCP-5452 Characters\n[[collapsible show=\"+ L is for Levin\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image l.png]]\nLevin is based on the Tsundere boys that I loved as a teenager and that I really feel like they are just toxic right now. His main inspiration is My Candy Love's Castiel.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ O is for Orion\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image o.png]]\nOrion is this Kuudere prideful boy. He is mostly based on a previous version of himself made by [[*user Dr Whitney]] that was to be used on the actual skip but was changed due to some changes in the narrative. I hate his hair and he will be the first that I'll remake when I return to this SCP.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ V is for Vivi\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image v.png]]\nI wanted a catgirl. Why? I don't know.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ E is for Eve\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image e.png]]\nEve was the first character that I made for the skip and was to be the protagonist. Before the last version, she was the one that should go crazy.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ R is for Ramiel\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image r.png]]\nThe angel, the God, the demon. R is my favorite character and the one that I like the design the most, even if I think I should improve some things on them anyway. They are a psycho and godlike version of characters like Regina George and Heather Chandler, but with a bit of Monika and White Diamond.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ D is for Diderot/Daniel\" hide=\"-\"]]\n\n[[image d.png]]\n[[image d2.png]]\nWell, that's a spoiler, but... yeah, Diderot and Daniel are supposed to be the same character. Diderot is highly inspired by Glacon and Daniel is literally a cute recolor of Ramiel.\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[tab Logos]]\n\n+++ Task Forces\n[[collapsible show=\"MTF Beta-777 (Hecate's Spear)\" hide=\"-\"]]\n[[image Beta777.png]]\nI'm a fan of [[*user Grigori Karpin]]'s [[[Hecatoncheires Cycle Hub]]] stories. I was planning to add Beta-777 to a tale, so I've created this and sent it to Grigori to see his opinion. Even if the draft was scrapped, the Logo is being used at the Hub and I can't be happier!\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"MTF Epsilon-8 (The Midwives)\" hide=\"-\"]]\n[[image Epsilon8.png]]\nI really think this MTF is really underused. I was thinking about using them too, so I made this logo for them. I think is very fitting.\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"MTF Pi-15 (Supernannies)\" hide=\"-\"]]\n[[image Pi15.png]]\nThis was part of an idea that I was planning to do. Right now it is in a strange limbo but I'll manage to do this anyway. It's an MTF related to a GoI that involves a child orphanage/school for anomalous children. \n[[/collapsible]]\n+++ Canons\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Daybreak\" hide=\"-\"]]\n[[image CotBS.png]]\nI was very excited when [[*user S D Locke]] made the [[[Daybreak]]] Hub, so I made it. It's a cute and simple logo for my favorite 001 proposal.\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/tab]]\n\n[[tab Fan Art, I guess?]]\n\n+++ Miscellaneous\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Scarlet Baby\" hide=\"-\"]]\n[[image babyscarlet.png]]\n[[image babyscarlet2.png]]\n\nA concept inspired by a video by Cimmerian about SCP-999 and the discussion about that video on the channel's Discord server. It's my headcanon on how Scarlet King would look like as a baby, a Lovecraftian scarlet blob baby!\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[/tab]]\n[[/tabview]]",
