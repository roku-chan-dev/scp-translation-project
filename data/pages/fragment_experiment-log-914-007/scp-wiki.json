Labeling states it is a \"Russian nesting Darby.\" The doll splits vertically into consecutively smaller Darbys. The final doll contained a small inanimate wooden honeybee. Notably, the Darbys were painted and modeled to look further injured as the layers were opened, progressing into a nearly unrecognizable corpse.\n\n//Note: I'm not sure if 914 is threatening me or Darby, but either way it's terrifying. - Stan//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0701**\n**Name:** Dr. Cleveland\n**Date:** 28/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One copy of the Green Day single \"21 Guns\", two copies of a photo of Dr. Nukea dated 27/03/2019, one AK-47\n\n**Input:** AK-47\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Two LAR Grizzly Win Mag MkV pistols. Testing showed that all bullets fired from these pistols attain speeds of 3████ m/s.\n\n//Note: Grizzly, again? You've got to be kidding me. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** \"21 Guns\" single, photo of Dr. Nukea\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A single called \"17 Guns\", ostensibly by a band named \"Suns of O'Donnel\". The lead singer's voice has been confirmed to be that of Dr. Nukea, while two of the backing vocalists have been identified as Prof. Wren and Researcher Darby.\n\n//Note: I've heard the music, and I'm literally weeping right now! - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Good God but that man could sing! If we could isolate Nukea's vocals from this and Darby's up for it, I would love to perform this at the funeral. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Normally I don't sing in front of people, but I can make an exception for Nukea. - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** Photo of Dr. Nukea\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate photo with a note written at the back stating an expiration date of 05/05/2019. The photo contains a short message from the Grizzly entity (dressed in a black gown) to Dr. Nukea, stating that despite having never interacted with him beyond hello/goodbye, she believes that Dr. Nukea has \"always been a kind person\", and that he will \"forever be missed\". This message repeats itself once every three hours.\nWhen asked, the entity stated that she does not know of the photo, but that her feelings are similar to that implicated by it. She also made a request to attend Dr. Nukea's funeral.\n\n//Note: I would like to propose renaming the break room in honor of Dr. Alexander Nukea. He deserved much more than he had. Everyone involved in 914 will remember him for his contributions. And I mean everyone, not just us researchers. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Why is everyone making such a big deal over Nukea dying? We work at the foundation. Our saftey records are hardly infalliable; researchers dying here isn't exactly a rare occurance. - Dr. Trandfir//\n\n//Note: How long did the others work on 914? How long did Nukea work here? Ask yourself, Trandfir, before you make such a heartless comment. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: The fact that our work is dangerous doesn't mean we have to be heartless about it. If anything it's all the more reason __not__ to be. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Sympathy isn't my strong suit. -Dr. Trandfir//\n\n//Note: I never really met the man besides passing in the break room, but, he was a good man *Blows Nose* - Researcher Darby//\n\n//Note: I'm pretty sure all he did was sit in his office and watch 17 again on loop. -Dr. Trandfir//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0702**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One 800-piece puzzle depicting a flower, with 60 pieces missing\n\n//Note: The 60 pieces were stuffed inside Jeff the mug cat. Last time someone did an experiment with amnestics, Jeff appeared to have knowledge of SCP-914's experiment history. This is to test the hypothesis that they are somehow linked. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** Puzzle\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A 800-piece puzzle depicting Intern Lunar placing a porcelain mug in the input booth with the former 'additional panels' set to \"Animal\". A different set of 60 pieces are missing.\n\n//Note: 914 appears to be able to see and depict past events. I am keeping this personally for additional testing, and verification of the picture's accuracy. - Jane Cho\nEdit: This makes no sense. I wrapped duct tape around Jeff and locked him in a box to stop the pieces from falling out, but somehow the pieces ended up on my desk in an extremely damaged state. They're still part of the flower, by the way. - Jane Cho//\n\n//Note: If any one sees Jane Cho with Jeff, stop her and tell me. I have told her about this and asked nicely for her to stop, yet she hasn't. I think Jeff is very angry right now as he dumped hot tea on my shoes again. Can someone watch my room or something so this doesn't happen again? thanks -Intern Lunar//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0703**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren, D-914-613\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One synthesizer keyboard\n\n**Input:** The synthesizer.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A synthesizer with 12 white keys and 7 black keys on it. D-class instructed to test the instrument out. The keys produced the following notes from left to right (number denotes octave, with 0 being the lowest the human ear can detect): E-flat 0, A-sharp 1, F 3, etc. Each key also had a progressive volume increase of 19 decibels and was accompanied by a 361hz square wave; D-class was given earplugs before pressing the 4th key, and sound dampening equipment was moved into the room before testing continued. D-class complained of an earache after pressing the 8th key, then began bleeding profusely from multiple facial orifices. D-class terminated, testing ceased. Upon being switched off, the synthesizer folded itself into a cube, 19cm in diameter on each side.\n\n//Note: 19 keys. A lowest note that plays at 19 hertz. Accounting for sharps and flats, each progressive key went up 19 notes from the previous. The volume went up 19 decibels with each key, and was accompanied by a square wave whose frequency was 19 squared. Its dimensions after powering down. At this point I'm not sure if I should be scared, or convinced that 914 is just [EXPLETIVE] with me. -Prof. Wren//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0704**\n**Name:** Dr. Matism\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 5 ███████ brand chocolate bunnies, 1 pocket watch\n\n//Note: Wow, everyone's bringing this back - Dr. Matism//\n\n**Input:** Above mentioned items\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** An animate contraption resembling a very distorted rabbit. It approached Dr. Matism, Vocalizing, \"Kill Me\". Security guards terminated the subject, which exploded into various pieces of chocolate and clockwork\n\n//Note: I'm not gonna lie, that was disturbing. But that chocolate was some of the best I've ever had - Dr. Matism//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0705**\n**Name:** Dr. Matism\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Items:** One copy of 17 Again\n\n**Input:** One copy of 17 Again\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One DVD with a montage of funny and notable moments from Dr. Nukea's lifetime.\n\n//Note: I've had a member of Eta-10 scan for memetic hazards, and we're all good. Can I show this at Nukea's funeral? - Dr. Matism//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0706**\n**Name:** Dr Clocks\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Items:** One note reading '19'\n\n//Note: Due to SCP-914 taking on a new approach, that being including '19' everywhere, I've decided to write a new test log on it. -Dr Clocks//\n\n**Input:** One note\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One note emblazoned with a single yellow star. The note appears to be emitting the song '19' by Paul Hardcastle, which seems induce PTSD upon those in its hearing range, with stronger cases held by those who have already fought in wars or other battles beforehand.\n\n//Note: This sadly does not prove anything on why SCP-914 has chosen this number, instead opting to cause more havoc, typical. -Dr Clocks//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0707**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 60 heavily damaged puzzle pieces depicting part of a flower\n\n//Note: Let's see if 914 can turn them into the missing pieces of the new puzzle. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** Puzzle pieces\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A small paper nameplate with the words \"Junior Researcher Lunar\" printed on it. --Foundation personnel viewing said nameplate will be compelled to believe that Intern Lunar has been promoted to Junior Researcher on 29/04/2019.--\n\n//Note: Apparently not. Also, 914 seems to reference Lunar a lot lately. - Jane Cho//\n\n//Note: The memetic property of the item appears to have been absent immediately after the test. The security personnel who were present in the containment chamber during the test have not been exposed to the effect, despite security footage clearly showing them having visual contact with the item. Upon further inspection, this property has been proven to be the effect of a memetic pattern that was overlaid on the printed surface some time after the test. Exactly when or how this happened is unknown and is a subject of further investigation. Personnel are to be reminded that Lunar has never been officially hired by the Foundation. - Security Chief Ozark//\n\n//Note: I blame Jeff for that, He has been behaving odd lately. If all goes well I will try to apply to be a Junior Researcher but for now I'm more than happy to be a intern -Intern Lunar//\n[!-- Sorry for doing stuff to Jeff, by the way. --]\n[!--It's fine, just realize that gave me the reason I need to have Lunar to try to make a turret--]  \n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0708**\n**Name:** Researcher Darby\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One memorial letter for Researcher Nukea\n\n**Input:** Above mentioned\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One letter addressed to Researcher Nukea. Address on said letter is \"Apartment 17, 4539 Beezlebub Drive, Lower Hellpit, Hell\" and the post mark on letter contains a minor cognitohazard that causes those who view it to attempt to deliver said letter.\n\n//Note: I opened the letter, or rather had a D-Class open the letter, and i'm going to read out its contents \"Dear Nukea, due to a rather unfortunate series of events your application to 17 Again has been denied. Your constant use of black magic has made it impossible for you to pass your toxicity screening and be accepted through Immigration. If you still wish to Immigrate to 17 Again you must wait a period of 666 years and fill out forms 17-A-Bez-45, 17-B-Luc-69, and accompanying forms. The Government of 17 Again thanks you for your time and hopes to see you in the future\". On another note, No one has died yet so maybe my curse has been broken? Well, Im going to be drowning my sorrows in the Break Room with a Pint of something British and Strong, anyone care to join me? - Researcher Darby//\n[!-- Veritas, I know that I'm talking about hell here, it's meant to be a joke --]\n\n//Note: The D-Class sent to open the letter has contracted a extremely virulent and contagious form of the Black Death and is expected to die within the next few hours. Researcher Darby and others who have been in contact have been put into quarantine and some other D-Class have contracted this plague. Dr. Veritas and Site Director Hackett have been notified about this epidemic and proper procedures are being initiated. - Medical Director of Site 19//\n\n//Note: At this time, it is impossible to determine if the letter is genuine or that SCP-914 fabricated the result. Leave that to the philosophers. And of course, when you think he can't surprise you, Darby almost infects the Site with the Bubonic Plague. - Veritas//\n\n//Note: Fortunately, we have a near-literal unlimited supply of antibiotics - Dr. Matism//\n\n//Note: Maybe we should stop putting 17 again into this thing -Dr. Mensa//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0709**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Items:** 1 front passenger side door from a 2001 Ford Explorer.\n\n//Note: We've had 13 instances of the number 19 crop up in my experiments the past few days; I can't tell if Dr. Clocks' instance was part of whatever's causing this or the result of inputting something with a 19 on it, so for the purposes of my own notes I'm leaving it out. 914's interactions have shown to vary from researcher to researcher anyway, so I'm fairly sure this is somehow aimed at me. Either way, let's see if 914 can keep that crap up with something completely random. As for how I got this? Nothing major, cost me $80 at a junkyard. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** The door.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A metal case made out of the metal of the door, held shut by the door lock and handle. Inside was a katana 1.329m in length. Analysis of the blade shows it was somehow folded 19 times, leaving it highly durable but with no usable edge. The handle is wrapped in leather made from the inner door handle.\n\n//Note: 1.329 meters comes out to 52.31 inches, or, to get exact, 4.35889894 feet...which, you guessed it, is the square root of 19. Additionally, I measured the case it came in, and wouldn't you know it, it's 361 cubic inches in size...19 squared. That brings my own count of \"19\" instances up to 16. I'm beginning to get rather excited about what will happen when it gets up to the 19th... I also just noticed the blade has some markings on it that resemble a music line with notes on it. Between that and the \"folding metal\" construction, that also throws in the recurring themes of music and origami. Interesting. In any case, given that it's not sharp enough to cut warm butter, requesting permission to keep it for decorative purposes. -Prof. Wren//\n\n------\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 071X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 071X Test Logs\"]]\n\n**Test 914-0710**\n**Name:** Dr. Matism\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Items:** 1 kg of ground beef\n\n//Note: Testing cleared - 05-█//\n\n**Input:** 1 kg of ground beef\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A model of an empty foothill, the words //__Ground__ Beef// are seared into the meat.\n\n//Note: Oh, ground as in the floor, ground beef. This was utterly pointless - Dr. Matism//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0711**\n**Name:** Dr. Peters\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Items:** 6 portions of 30 grams of table salt\n\n//Note: Due to the inherent unpredictability regarding SCP-914, I have abandoned my original line of inquiry. Having said that, I have no intentions to cease experimentation with SCP-914. Instead, I am going back to simple with table salt. I am skipping rough and coarse to avoid the possibility of chlorine gas.//\n\n**Input:** 1 portion of salt as above\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 30 grams rock salt\n\n//Note: Keeping it simple doesnt provide for much variation as expected. Now a repeat for confirmation. -Dr Peters//\n\n**Input:** 1 portion of salt as above\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 30 grams pickling salt\n\n//Note: SCP-914 only changed the size of the crystals for these two tests, I would expect some crystaline structure changes on the fine setting. -Dr Peters//\n\n**Input:** 1 portion of salt as above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 1 Cube of salt\n\n**Input:** 1 portion of salt as above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** 1 tetrahedron of salt, microscopic analysis shows the crystal structure has been forced from cubic to tetrahedral. Specimen has been sent to the geology department for further analysis.\n\n//Note: Just when I feel I'm starting to find a trend it unravels, how did it create a stable change in the crystal structure? I will have to await the geology department's report. -Dr Peters//\n\n**Input:** 1 portion of salt as above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** 1 salt viking weilding an axe that, when the output opened, leapt out and began swinging at the face of the D-class charged with collecting the specimens. Specimen was destroyed when Dr. Peters dumped a full mug of coffee over it.\n\n//Note: Good thing salt dissolves in water. I'm going to need more coffee if 914 keeps giving me puns though. -Dr. Peters//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0712**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Stan\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One note reading \"I love you 3000.\"\n\n**Input:** Above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A cognitohazardous picture of [[[SCP-3000]]] that bore similar, albeit considerably weakened effects to the actual SCP. There was a doodle of a \"heart\" next to SCP-3000. It took two hours and 10 agents, but the image was eventually burned.\n\n//Note: I woke up in the amnestics bay with a bunch of agents. I don't remember what happened, and I had to piece this together using what was left of security footage. I don't have a wife and daughter, but my memory says otherwise. Requesting a short leave while I try to figure out what memories are mine and what aren't.// - --Evan-- Stan\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0713**\n**Name:** Dr. Beiderman\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One photograph of Dr. Beiderman.\n\n**Input:** Above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One crumpled photograph of Researcher Darby. Exited booth at speeds upward of 120 M.P.H. and passed straight through Dr. Beiderman, who was pronounced dead when medical personnel arrived. Of note, Dr. Beiderman did not appear to have human organs when dissection began. Investigation into the fate of the \"real\" Dr. Beiderman, if there ever was one, is ongoing.\n\n//Note: Right under my nose... I quit. - Security Chief Ozark//\n\n//Note: Really? If so do you want a goodbye present? -Intern Lunar//\n\n//Note: Lunar, I am afraid he is already gone. Walked into the medbay muttering something about \"body-snatchers\" and popped the little white pill before I could stop him. - Medical Officer Lawrence//\n\n//Note: Oh, goodness. We've lost two relatively high-profile researchers in three days, and then Ozark as well... - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0714**\n**Name:** Dr. Cleveland, D-5808\n**Date:** 29/04/2019\n**Total Items:** A sketch of SCP-085 in the Austrian Alps (i.e. not SCP-085 itself); a photo of Dr. Cleveland; a photo of Junior Researcher Rasclon; a copy of the Owl City EP //Of June//\n\n**Input:** Sketch\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A monochrome photo of a woman skiing near Graz, Austria, dated 08/08/2008. The appearance of the woman matches that of Cassy as depicted by SCP-978.\n\n//Note: Someone is going to have to look up surveillance footage dated August 8, 2008... - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n**Input:** Photo of Dr. Cleveland\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A photo of Dr. Cleveland travelling in Riga, Latvia, prior to joining the Foundation. The photo was dated 19/04/2013, with \"19\" being in boldface. The photo has a memetic property which causes people to remember what they were doing exactly four years before joining the Foundation, and what they were doing exactly nineteen years ago, as vividly as possible.\n\n//Note: That would be the eighteenth time \"19\" shows up. I have to wonder... - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Why do I remember a firing squad aiming at me? I feel that I would remember that normally - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** Photo of JR Rasclon\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A cognitohazardous photo depicting three JR Rasclons mauling one another. When viewed, the viewer splits into three entities. The effect lasts for nine hours before two of them vanish.\n\n//Note: That's why we need to use D-class. I am not going to risk splitting myself into three. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Having seen the results of other recurring themes, I really hope this doesn't become one. 9 being 3^2, it seems similar to Prof. Wren's recurring \"19\", which so far seems fairly benign. That said, I'll be refraining from winding the mainspring for a few days. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** //Of June//\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A CD, containing a recording dated 06/06/2026. The recording details (purportedly the President of the United States) Elizabeth Warren's reaction to a series of nuclear strikes.\nFrom the recording, the targets were as follows:\nCranbrook, British Columbia, Canada: On target causing widespread destruction. No other information is known.\nMissoula, Montana: Off target, destroying [[[scp-3300 | Clear Water, Montana]]] but heavily irradiating Missoula in the process. SCP-3300 presumed neutralized as a side effect.\nButte, Montana: On target, Silver Bow County obliterated.\nPocatello, Idaho: Off target, hitting Fort Hall, Idaho but failed to explode due to a preemptive EMP attack encompassing all communities from Pocatello to Idaho Falls.\nEvanston, Wyoming: On target, Uinta County in complete anarchy.\nGrand Junction, Colorado: Shot down. Four people are killed by debris.\nDurango, Colorado: On target but failed to explode. Eight people are killed in the impact.\nMoab, Utah: Shot down. No casualties were reported.\nFarmington, New Mexico: Off target, striking a Foundation facility near Beclabito, New Mexico causing [DATA EXPUNGED] in the Navajo Nation.\nResearch into the recording is underway.\n\n//Note: Regardless whether Clear Water is anomalous or not, nobody would want a nuke to go off in their territory, much less a series of them. Or a very bad pun of June. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0715**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 1 5-gallon bucket of paint.\n\n//Note: Counting Doctors Clocks' and Cleveland's experiments, we are now at 18 instances of \"19\" in recent tests. I suspect something will happen here involving a final instance, as I felt inexplicably compelled to use a bucket of paint for this experiment. Dr. Veritas, I've left a file in your office containing an updated version of my last will and testament. If nothing comes of this, I ask that you destroy it. If, on the other hand, this goes as I feel it will...well, it's been fun, everyone. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Prof. Wren forewent usage of D-class personnel for this experiment, stating that she was \"ready for whatever 914 throws her way.\"//\n\n**Input:** The bucket.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A plastic urn, Grecian style, filled with white paint. Upon the output booth opening, the urn fell over, causing a series of small paint-creatures began crawling out of it en masse; the object and its behavior proved consistent with that of SCP-019. The creatures proved immensely hostile, attacking Prof. Wren on site. Hostilities were thwarted by security personnel 2 minutes later when the object and the creatures were destroyed via a full-power blast from the \"H2O-9000\" water gun created in a previous experiment. No further anomalous properties noted in the paint or the remains of the urn. Security personnel treated for minor injuries caused by recoil from the water gun.\n\n//Note: That...was unpleasant, to say the least, but I think you can scrap that file I left for you, boss. Whatever connection this might have to SCP-019 definitely merits examination, though...regardless, I got one last thing to do here before we get to cleaning all this paint up. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** The urn's remains.\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** A pile of plastic dust.\n\n//Note: Okay, I'm good now. Hopefully this puts an end to all this \"19\" BS. Good __Lord__ I'm gonna need a shower and a change of clothes, though. Those little bastards got paint in places I didn't even know I __had__. - Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Scrap what I said about this 19 thing seeming benign before, 914 doesn't seem to know the meaning of the word. Glad you're alright, especially in light of 914's apparently higher than usual lethality as of late. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: Just to remind you, Nukea's funeral begins in an hour or two. If you're coming, you need to change fast. On the other hand, I'd hate to see another of us pass away. Looks like luck is on your side, Wren. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Indeed. Thanks for the reminder, just got finished. On my way; bringing the amp-Stratocaster and a recording of Dr. Nukea's vocals from that song so that Darby and I can work with him one last time. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Why is it that 914 researchers all seem to be suicidal? - Dr. Trandfir//\n\n----\n\n**Test 914-0716**\n**Name:** Dr. Hort, D-914-714\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total items:** 50 grams of boron, 50 grams of silicon, 50 grams of germanium, 50 grams of arsenic, 50 grams of antimony, 50 grams of tellurium.\n\n//Note: I just got assigned to 914. You guessed it, I’m a chemist. -Dr. Hort//\n\n**Input:** All of above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A cube of 300 grams of a black material, which expelled a black toxic gas.\nFurther research revealed that the material was a compound of all the previous elements.\n\n//Note: How is that even possible? -Dr. Hort//\n\n//Note: You are very new here. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** Results from the last test\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A large specimen of corvus corax (common crow), apparently composed of the previous material.\nWhen the D-class tried to retrieve it, the bird transformed into gas, escaping from D-914-714’s hands, and proceeded to float to Dr. Hort’s arm and become solid again.\n\n//Note: I think it likes me. I’ll name it Reepicheep. -Dr. Hort//\n\n-----------\n\n**Test 914-0717**\n**Name:** Dr. Peters\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Items:** Chainmail hauberk\n\n//Note: I was going to send 17 Again through 914 in memory of Nukea, but I can't seem to find a copy of it anywhere. I found this chainmail in one of my drawers so I'm using it instead. It's the thought that counts, right? -Dr Peters//\n\n**Input:** 1 chainmail hauberk\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** 17 steel envelopes each containing an embossed letter written in the style of \"send this to so many people or...\" chain letters. Notably, each number has been replaced with 17. Each letter has the memetic property where the reader believes the contents and tries to \"forward\" the letters to others. 1 D-class and 3 guards were affected before anmestics were administered and the letters moved to specimen storage.\nExerpts follow:\nNukeamail is running out of usernames and inactive users will be removed. Forward this to 17 people to keep...\nThere are 17 weekends this month. This only happens every 289 years. Forward this to 17 friends for...\nFWD:FWD:FWD:NUKEA:FWD:FWD KEEP READING OR YOU WILL DIE!!@! ... 17 people.... Bloody Mary will...\n\n//Note: It seems the thought really did count this time. -Dr Peters//\n\n//Note: It really does. -Intern Lunar//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0718**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 300 grams of aquamarine beryl\n\n**Input:** 100 grams of aquamarine\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A small cup made of aquamarine containing aquamarine powder\n\n**Input:** 100 grams of aquamarine\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A disc made of aquamarine that will induce hallucinations in whoever comes in contact with it, causing them to percieve everything as being 'made of aquamarine'. Actual vision is unaffected, and opaque objects will not become transparent under the effect.\n\n//Note: I'm never touching that again. - Jane Cho//\n\n**Input:** 100 grams of aquamarine\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A perfectly formed hexagonal aquamarine rod. When one end of the rod is pressed with a human finger, a high-energy beam of infrared light will be emitted from the other end, which almost ignited the opposing wall.\n\n//Note: That was... unexpected. At least nobody got hurt. - Jane Cho//\n\n//Note: Good thing Darby wasn't in charge of this test -Dr. Mensa//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0719**\n**Name:** Dr. Hort\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total items:** 3 glasses, 90 ml of human tears.\n\n**Input:** One glass, 30 ml of human tears.\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Pieces of glass, a small block of sodium and a mixture of hydrogen, chloride and oxygen gas.\n\n//Note: testing was paused for 5 minutes due to the risk of breathing chloride gas.//\n\n**Input:** One glass, 30 ml of human tears.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** The liquid was unchanged, but the glass had the words “sea water” engraved on it’s surface.\n\n**Input:** One glass, 30 ml of human tears.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One glass, 30 ml of blood.\nApparently, the cells that the tears contained were changed genetically to act like blood cells.\n\n//Note: So... It’s blood without a blood type? - Dr. Hort//\n\n//Note: Not exactly, the blood type is already imprinted on the DNA. What likely happened was 914 converted the cells to stem cells and then into blood cells.//\n\n//Note: So I spent some time in the lab looking at a sample of this \"blood\" and my analyzers aren't seeing any RBCs, WBCs, or platelets, so it cant be blood. I believe 914 rearranged the lactoferrin naturally present in tears and combined them with skin cell fragments to create pseudo-RBCs leading to the red color. Or something entirely different since 914 doesn't make sense. -Dr. Peters//\n\n------\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 072X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 072X Test Logs\"]]\n\n**Test 914-0720**\n**Name:** Researcher Darby\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** Multiple copies of \"101 Ways to Boil Eggs\" and \"Thai Food Recipes\"\n\n//Note: Surely this cant end up with me hospitalized? Right? - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** 101 Ways to Boil Eggs\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Ripped pile of paper.\n\n//Note: Okay, still safe, no explosions yet - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** \"Thai Food Recipes\"\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Pile of paper and a puddle of ink.\n\n//Note: Again, nothing new or unexpected, also I'm going to put both books in to see what happens. - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** \"101 Ways to Boil Eggs\" and \"Thai Food Recipes\"\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** \"101 Ways to find a Curse\" and \"Curse breaking for Dummies\".\n\n//Note: Curses? What? Where did curses come into the equation? - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** \"101 Ways to Boil Eggs\" and \"Thai Food Recipes\"\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** \"101 Ways to boil a chicken man\" and \"[[[SCP-3199]]], A detailed explanation\"\n\n//Note: Bloody hell, That Chicken man is going to give me nightmares. Hopefully the amnestics I will have to take after reading the SCP-3199 book will nullify my reading of the chicken book. - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** \"101 Ways to Boil Eggs\" and \"Thai Food Recipes\"\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A \"Cookbook\", recipes included are \"Researcher Alfredo, Wren Waffles, Calloway Chops, Vodka Veritas Cocktail, Stan Steak, Lunar Cheese, Darby Dumplings, Jeff Cake, Hort-Burgers, Beiderman Brautwurst, ect.\" At the back of the book is a list of Discontinued Recipes such as \"Anton and Anchovies, Nukea Nuclear Cocktail, and Wasabi covered Westrin\". On the front and back cover is a memetic symbol that causes viewers to attempt to create the recipes included. Due to a possible similarity to [REDACTED] \"Cookbook\" was sent to incinerators to be destroyed but vanished mid-transit along with D-35456 who is presumed to be at large.\n\n//Note: It really gives you some perspective when you try to cook yourself. Thankfully, Medical Officer Lawrence stopped me from chopping anything important off. - Researcher Darby//\n\n//Note: I found the thing in the trash bin outside of [REDACTED]'s containment chamber, and seriously 914? Matism Miso? The recipe had the broth made from my vitrious humor. I don't even have enough of that to fill a water glass! - Dr. Matism//\n\n//Note: Not sure if I should be offended or happy I'm not included in those recipes. -Dr. Peters//\n\n//Note: Oh you're in here alright, you're Peters Pineapple Upside Down Cake. Fortunately, it actually contains pineapple, and isn't made from your spleen - Dr. Matism//\n\n//Note: Annnnd we have a death, one of the recipes is \"D-Class disaster\", when D-35456 found that recipe he managed to obtain a gun and blow his brains out onto a plate. -Researcher Festiv//\n\n//Note: a \"Mensa Martini\" made out of my own plasma? I think Researcher Darby should take a break from SCP-914 -Dr. Mensa//\n\n//Note: \"Cleveland Chowder\", made from my fingers. And then we have \"Grizzly Grill\", \"Boston Borscht\", \"Thawed Thompson\" etc. near the back. Is 914 planning to torture or murder everyone? Also, it's just plain luck that we only lost one D-class to it. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Mine is a tier cake with three tiers, each requiring a heart that is \"a genetic match\" of mine. Looks like this **is** going to be a recurring theme. I'll start being a lot more cautious with my tests. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: The Vodka Veritas Cocktail sounds lovely, we just need to replace my blood with a substitute. I get that 914 might have a jab at my average blood/alcohol concentration, but as with most things, I won't give it the satisfaction of getting upset about it. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0721**\n**Name:** N.C.E.\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total items:** One Sample of the tissue present in the Doctor Beiderman entity.\n\n//Note: Testing proved the entity was made out of colored wax, and animated through anomalous means. - Medical Officer Lawrence//\n\n**Input:** Tissue sample\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One wax sausage.\n\n//Note: Huh, Beiderman Brautwurst. 914's showing a correlation between this and a previous experiment - Dr. Matism//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0722**\n**Name:** Dr. Mensa\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** A Mucus Sample of Dr. Mensa in a large glass petri dish suspended in alcohol\n\n//Note: My first experiment here. Let's hope it's good! -Dr. Mensa//\n\n**Input:** Mucus Sample\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A martini glass full of a clear liquid. When given to a D-class personnel the subject immediately collapsed and was pronounced dead, however on the way to the morgue the subject regained conciseness and started impersonating Dr. Mensa. Subject was later terminated after an interview. Analysis of the drink reveals it is composed of one half Dr. Mensa's DNA and one half a substance with an impossibly high alcohol content that would immediately cause alcohol poisoning.\n\n//Note: I was hoping to clone myself but I think this is the Mensa Martini from the cookbook Darby made. I wonder what the other recipes do? -Dr. Mensa//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0723**\n**Name:** Jr. Researcher Sionur, D-1904, D-0431\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 5 stainless steel rods (0.5 cm diameter, 30 cm of length).\n\n//Note: Just been assigned here, apparently multiple spots opened up. I'm gonna start with something simple, hopefully my first experiment won't result in any kind of frightening thunderbolts or lightning. -Sionur//\n\n//Note: The only reason spots open up is because we're all suicidal maniacs, with the exception of Wren - Dr. Matism//\n\n**Input:** One of the above\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Multiple small fragments, at a temperature of -123°C. From the way the fragments are broken it appears the rod has been chilled, reheated, then put under high pressure on both ends.\n\n//Note: Good thing I felt that the air was cold before I touched them, would have left some skin otherwise. I'll send D-Class next time to limit risks. -Sionur//\n\n**Input:** One of the above\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:**  4 rods of variable sizes , analysis identified them to be made of Nickel, Iron, Chromium and Carbon. Each rod kept the same proportions as the original.\n\n**Input:** One of the above\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 1 steel mug on which is engraved the face of Freddy Mercury. Mug is smaller than average, likely due to material restrictions.\n\n//Note: Wait, does this thing read what I write on my report? Also can I please keep the mug? The engraving is surprisingly detailed. -Sionur//\n\n//Note: You're new, so I'll explain this once: You can keep the results if they seem harmless, but remember that if that thing causes a containment breach, causes casualties or makes your favorite toe explode, it's your responsibility, not mine. - Veritas//\n\n**Input:** One of the above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A shrapnel explosion, noise reportedly similar to a thunderstrike, D-1904 suffered broken bones and bleeding, both internal and external and was sent to medical emerency.\n\n//Note: Dodged a bullet here, I dread what comes next. -Sionur//\n\n**Input:** One of the above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** The rod, apparently unchanged, when put in contact with anything, the rod will halt all electric circulation . When D-0431 picked it up, she promptly collapsed and died, due to necessary muscles not being activated and to the complete cessation of brain activity. Rod was successfully recovered with the use of gloves, as it seems to only apply to what directly touches it. Now placed in anomalous containment.\n\n//Note: Huh, I guess 914 took my request of not having thunderbolt or lightning quite literally... Could be handy as an emergency power breaker... -Sionur//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0724**\n**Name:** Junior Researcher Roa\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** Four standard Bic brand mechanical pencils\n\n//Note: I'm excited to perform my first solo test. Researcher Lombardi suggested I start with mechanical pencils as they have a variety of materials to refine and clear functions to improve. - Roa//\n\n//Note: Apologies in advance for the deception - I'm actually testing a hypothesis that 914 reacts not only to the operator's state of mind, but that of any individuals nearby. I need the operator to be unaware so as to avoid subconscious influence. I have interns Humber and Lewis with me - we'll all be thinking vividly about fire during these tests. Extinguishers are nearby in case we are too successful. - Lombardi//\n\n**Input:** One mechanical pencil\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One 'Pilot' brand mechanical pencil. The pencil's body is colored red.\n\n//Note: Bic to Pilot? I'd expect that on 'Fine'. - Roa//\n\n**Input:** One mechanical pencil\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One unbranded mechanical pencil with a transparent body. The spring is located at the tip of the pencil rather than near the eraser. Pushing in the eraser activates the pencil, causing the spring to visibly heat up. This reaction melts the loaded graphite rod, allowing it to flow and mark surfaces similar to ink. How the spring manages to heat, or how the graphite is able to melt in standard pressures is still unknown.\n\n**Input:** One mechanical pencil\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One candle-shaped object. The body is made of plastic, while the wick is a composite of rubber, graphite, and metal. When lit, the candle quickly melted and spilled over the table. On examination, the melted remains had formed into what Junior Researcher Roa was thinking of writing next - this output log.\n\n//Note: I seem to be getting a pattern of heat or fire-based results. I've heard of 914 having 'themed' reactions with certain researchers. Why is it giving me fire? I don't want to be the fire guy. I will attempt to derail this by concentrating on ice. - Roa//\n\n**Input:** One mechanical pencil\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One intricately crafted pencil, inlaid with fine patterns of rubber and metal. The word 'Freezer Burn' is imprinted along the side. Graphite automatically extends from the tip to maintain a constant length of 2mm. Markings made with this pencil spontaneously erupt into grayish flames after approximately 15 seconds. These flames cause a super-cooling reaction with any materials they touch, but do not appear to spread beyond the initial contact point. The markings shrink as the flames burn until both disappear.\n\n//Note: The D-Class operating the pencil had to be treated for topical frost-bite. - Roa//\n\n//Note: The disturbing implication here is that this could be linked to the recent rise of Staff accidents and deaths. It would only take a single bad actor daydreaming just a little too hard about a coworker they dislike. - Lombardi//\n\n//Note: Don't tempt me, Lombardi. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0725**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** 1 ream of A4 paper, 1 inkwell\n\n//Note: No word on what compelled me to bring a bucket of paint in last time. Regardless, toning it back down a bit for this one; while we hit a 19th instance of \"19\" in total, 914's shown its interactions to be a bit more personal to whoever's using it. Calloway gets trolled, Darby gets damn near killed, and I get some inexplicable music/origami/19 mix, so for all I know I may have at least 2 more coming. Guess we'll see. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** 3 sheets of paper, 5 ounces of ink.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A monochrome, photo-quality image of an adolescent girl at a party.\n\n//Note: I remember this. This was the party my family threw for my 19th birthday. Guess that makes number 18 for my own list. Hoo boy... -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** 19 sheets of paper, 19 ounces of ink.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n\n//Note: You know what, may as well go for broke on this one. Suggest everyone clear out in case it decides to make a copy of another SCP again. Won't deny I'm nervous as hell, but whatever's going on with this \"19\" crap will, hopefully, come to an end. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Output:** A single 915.37cm x 1294.59cm sheet of paper, folded into a self-interlocking shape that took Prof. Wren 22 minutes to fully unfold. Upon being fully opened, the inside was revealed to contain only a note, reading as follows: \"Paranoia test concluded.\"\n\n//Note: What. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: That makes two times this 19 trend has concluded, which leans towards the idea that these trends we're seeing are based on our perception of what 914 is doing. This could to a feedback loop where it produces results related to that and fuels the idea, which is why seemingly significant events happened in both conclusions. In that case, it seems like these could end up being quite dangerous, especially if the increased lethality we're seeing is one of them. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n//Note: Either that, or the previous \"conclusion\" was part of whatever this \"paranoia test\" was. I just want to know who or what was behind it. Was this 914's doing? Was something else controlling 914's outputs somehow? Either way, on the possibility that you're right, I've got no problem staying off the Very Fine setting for a good long while. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Wise words, Wren.//\n\n//Note: So now it's the one testing us? Great, just great. -Dr. Mensa//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0726**\n**Name:** Dr. Cleveland\n**Date:** 30/04/2019\n**Total Items:** One photo of Prof. Wren, one photo of Dr. Beiderman\n\n**Input:** Photo of Prof. Wren\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** Photo of Prof. Wren and Researcher Darby singing onstage at Dr. Nukea's funeral. When shown to anyone who were present at Dr. Nukea's funeral, he or she would recall all memories shared with Dr. Nukea.\n\n//Note: That was plain unexpected. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Really nice, though. I don't think I've had that much fun or cried that hard in my whole life. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** Photo of Dr. Beiderman\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** What can only assumed to be a photo of Dr. Beiderman and D-1618 sharing a kiss in Wollongong, Australia. The photo is dated 12/05/2019.\n\n//Note: Well, I never. Send someone to Australia for some confirmation. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: Field trip? -Intern Lunar//\n\n//Note: Sure. Anyone who is interested in flying to Sydney? Our missing researcher and D-class are probably located. - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: I'm not paying for your road trip, I'm paying through the nose for that cleanup crew alone. Ask Norton from Accounting, and good luck trying to convince him that everything you need is absolutely required for official Foundation business, or just pay for your own Mojitos. - Veritas//\n\n//Note: I'm going to Sydney this summer; maybe I should check it out. -Dr. Mensa//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0727**\n**Name:** Dr. Tanger\n**Date:** 01/05/2019\n**Total Items:** Three copies of  //Where the Sidewalk Ends// by Shel Silverstein.\n\n//Note: I want to see if 914 understands simple poetry. If it does well on this test, we might move on to more advanced writing. - Dr. Tanger//\n\n**Input:** One item mentioned above\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One copy of //It's Raining Pigs and Noodles// by Jack Prelutsky\n\n**Input:** One item mentioned above\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One copy of //The Foundation's Follies// by Alexander Tanger, detailing the major failures of the Foundation in poetry form.\n\n//Note: Why is this machine trying to get me fired? - Dr. Tanger//\n\n**Input:** One item mentioned above\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A plain-looking paperweight / That changes the linguistic state / Of the author to write /\n Anything that they might / In a poetry form that they hate.\n\n//Note: A break is what I need now / If Veritas would ever allow / 914 has me done / So I have to run / Limerick poems are horrible - wow.   - Dr. Tanger//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0728**\n**Name:** Dr. Hort\n**Date:** 01/05/2019\n**Total items:** 3 vials, 60 ml of krypton.\n\n**Input:** 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A pile of aluminium nitrate, a pile of strontium.\n\n//Note: Even though you switched the protons, it doesn’t mean it’s equal, 914.//\n\n**Input:** 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A cloud of a compound of silicon, oxygen and krypton.\n\n//Note: This machine just altered the laws of physics. How is this gas even stable?//\n\n**Input:** 1 vial containing 20 ml of krypton.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Upon opening of the output booth, a white flash of over 13,000 lumens filled the room, burning Dr. Hort’s corneas. The vial was empty and unchanged.\n\n//Note: Luckily, I will be able to recover after a cornea transplant. Also, ouch. -Dr. Hort//\n\n//Note: This is why I wear sunglasses indoors Hort. -Dr. Mensa//\n\n//Note: It's also why it's standard procedure to use D-Class when testing 914 - Dr. Trandfir//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0729**\n**Name:** Dr. Clocks, D-07431\n**Date:** 01/05/2019\n**Total items:** Five copies of Macbeth\n\n//Note: Due to the whole 'cursed' nature of the aforementioned play. I've naturally sent a D-Class in for cover, just so I don't turn into another Darby. -Dr Clocks//\n\n**Input:** One copy of Macbeth\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Lumps of leather alongside piles of shredded and burnt paper.\n\n**Input:** One copy of Macbeth\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** One standard white paper cup filled with a reddish type of liquid. Chemical analysis shows it to be a sample of 'bad luck'.\n\n//Note: This is exactly what I was expecting with this test. Lets just hope it doesn't get any worse. -Dr Clocks//\n\n**Input:** One copy of Macbeth\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One copy of Titus Andronicus.\n\n**Input:** One copy of Macbeth\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One altered copy of Macbeth titled //'Clocks'//. Analysis reveals it to be almost identical to the original play aside from several assets being changed and the characters being replaced with Foundation personnel. Macbeth has been replaced with Dr. Clocks, Lady Macbeth has been replaced with Prof. Wren and King Duncan has been replaced with Veritas.\n\n//Note: Weird. I get what 914 was going for, but why am I married to Wren? I'd also like to notify that the characters 'MacDonald' and 'The Thane of Cawdor' have been replaced with Researcher Darby and Dr. Nukea. Both of whom have been killed off in the play beforehand. -Dr Clocks//\n\n**Input:** One copy of Macbeth\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Three miniature models of what appeared to be witches made entirely out of paper and slight traces of leather. When Dr Clocks approached them, they yelled out 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Senior Researcher.', 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Site Director.' and finally 'Hail thee, █████ Clocks, Foundation Administrator here on out!' before being immediately being terminated by security personnel.\n\n//Note: No, just no.

I started to see it too but later realized that it will stop around 12 hours after Nukea has been produced. -Vand//\n\n//Note: Just to be safe I had \"Nukea\" placed in a humanoid holding cell with food and water untill we know if it's really him or something else. -Researcher Festiv//\n\n------\n\n**Test 914-0735**\n**Name:** Prof. Wren\n**Date:** 01/05/2019\n**Items:** One pair of prescription glasses.\n\n//Note: As much as I'd love to claim that I'm trying to develop a countermeasure or safety against optical memetics like that thing trying to pass itself off as Dr. Nukea, the simple truth is I lost a bet with the acting Security Chief. Lucky for me the optometrist was having a BOGO sale that weekend, so I got away with sacrificing my spares for this. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input:** The glasses.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Same pair of glasses, initially appearing unaltered except for the frames and lenses being lightly tinted blue. Further testing revealed that, by rubbing a finger along the top of the frames, a variety of visual modes could be accessed, including infrared vision, a \"life-force vision\" that showed an \"aura\" around living creatures, and over 200 modes that serve no useful purpose, including what Prof. Wren described as \"Bacon-vision\" which functions similar to the \"life-force\" vision but showed the aura around pieces of bacon instead. Tapping the sides of the frames returned the visual mode to normal.\n\n//Note: ...Okay, now I __know__ 914's just screwing with me, but you know what? I'll take it. Switching view modes is gonna take some practice, though; I slide my finger a freaking millimeter and it rotates through about 60 different modes fast enough to make me want to vomit. Definitely touchy, this one. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Upon discovering that one of the visual modes blocked the effects of optical memetics and cognitohazards, security forces confiscated the glasses to ensure they were not misused.//\n\n//Note: [EXPLETIVE DELETED]. -Prof. Wren//\n\n//Note: Does anyone know if this thing could block the effects of infohazards like The Eleventh Hour (the result from 914 the first time I used it) nullified 1128's? - Dr. Cleveland//\n\n//Note: I'm willing to bet that's classified above our pay levels now. I was just getting to like those, too. -Prof. Wren//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0736**\n**Name:** JR. Rasclon\n**Date:** 02/05/2019\n**Items:** Four 10g chunks of natural uranium, each consisting of 99.3% uranium-238 and 0.7% uranium-235 by mass.\n\n//Note: After some painkillers and therapy, I've managed to get over my previous test. I want to test if common refinement processes can be carried out by 914, as well as see if the easier to predict Rough and Coarse settings can be semi-reliably used to, say, enrich uranium by splitting the isotopes into discrete chunks. I've got the proper clearance to do this, as well as the necessary safety equipment. I'll also be avoiding Rough, to hopefully prevent any particulate uranium from being created or inhaled, and will terminate the test before Very Fine if things start to get particularly dangerous. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** Chunk of uranium\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Three 3.33g chunks of uranium, each retaining the original ratio of isotopes.\n\n//Note: Not the 238/235 split I was hoping for. Also, three identical chunks. So far, nothing dangerous though. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** Chunk of uranium\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One 10g chunk of uranium, in a different shape to the input.\n\n//Note: Both of these first two outputs were disposed of with standard radioisotope handling equipment.//\n\n**Input:** Chunk of uranium\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A 10g chunk of uranium --with a fluctuating ratio of isotopes--. The chunk of uranium possesses the anomalous property of constantly shifting the position of the uranium-235 inside it. This has been observed to work even when the chunk was separated into multiple discrete pieces, with the uranium-235 apparently moving between the pieces.\n\n//Note: Weird, but ultimately no more harmful than normal uranium. The Very Fine test will be going ahead, but the test will be conducted by D-5396 while the testing chamber is observed remotely. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n**Input:** Chunk of uranium\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A chunk of uranium, which was glowing brightly enough to blind D-5396. The glow dimmed considerably in the next two hours, and researchers entering the chamber found that the uranium was emitting electromagnetic radiation near-equally across the electromagnetic spectrum between the wavelengths of 1cm and 1nm. This emission reduced the half-life of the uranium to only 20 minutes, causing it to glow intensely and decay rapidly. D-5396 is being treated for radiation poisoning. The short half-life of the material caused it to decay into non-anomalous isotopes quickly enough to be stored in the same manner as non-anomalous radioisotopes.\n\n//Note: Well, I didn't get the result I wanted, but there are a few things to be gained from this. For one, the fact that 914 can anomalously affect and accelerate transmutation effects like atomic decay, despite not being able to cause it directly. As an aside, the half-life was a third of an hour. However, no escalation is yet present in the \"three\" trend, thankfully. -JR. Rasclon//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0737**\n**Name:** Researcher A.

Dross after an attempt to remove it from the output booth. The object promptly turned on, displaying what appeared to be the eyes, mouth, and nostrils of the protogen.\nNo adverse effects observed during and after attachment.\n\n//Note: Despite efforts by medical personnel to get the visor off, it cannot be removed. Further attempts are discouraged, due to it now being R. Dross's face.//\n\n//Note: Researcher A. Dross retains the ability to breathe, eat, and see through anomalous means.

Music was played at 120 decibels inside the input chamber before starting 914, with the objective of cooking the burrito using the kinetic sound energy.//\n\n**Input:** Burrito\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A burrito filled with smashed vegetables. A bright flash of over 9.500 lumens was visible when the output chamber opened, injuring the retina of D-7438 (who was used to open the output chamber) permanently.\n\n-----\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ Show 074X Test Logs\" hide=\"- Hide 074X Test Logs\"]]\n\n**Test 914-0740**\n**Name:** Researcher Darby\n**Date:** 07/05/2019\n**Total Items:** Six Boeing 737 jet engines\n\n//Note: I obtained military grade blast shields, so hopefully if things go wrong, I will not get hurt - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** One Boeing 737 engine.\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** One mangled and scorched Boeing 737 engine.\n\n**Input:** One Boeing 737 engine\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Several piles of engine components and a bucket of fuel\n\n//Note: Did I forget to flush the fuel from the engines?

I do like that it is completely anatomically correct, it even has fuel for blood. - Researcher Darby//\n\n**Input:** One Boeing 737 engine\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** Seven miniature jet fighters that upon SCP-914's output door opening, flew out and attacked Researcher Darby to no effect due to crashing into Researcher Darby's blast shield. Inside the output booth, 13 more planes were found. They seemed inoperable until Researcher Darby attempted to collect them, upon which they self-destructed, fracturing several bones of both Darby and surrounding security personnel.\n\n//Note: I think maybe I'll try something simpler next time, like a teddy bear, or a log. That can't possibly hurt me right? - Researcher Darby//\n\n//Note: The log (if wood) would probably explode giving everyone splinters, and the bear probably would find some magical way to hurt someone.

The interior of it has been altered to function as a short-range radio that broadcasts and receives on a frequency of ████ Hz and has a maximum range of 17 kilometers. Increased functionality causes the battery life to run down significantly faster.\n\n//Note: I'm gonna get this thing tweaked to work on Foundation frequencies and replace the battery with a better power supply so that it can actually be used. After that, I call dibs, though I'm sure we can reverse-engineer a few more for anyone else. -Prof. Wren//\n\n**Input::** A wrist-comm.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** The same wrist-comm. Upon putting it on to test communications functions, the D-class disappeared in a beam of orange light that shot off towards the western United States. Satellite tracked it for 27 minutes until it reached the Brandeis-Bardin Campus at the American Jewish University in Sim Valley, California, where the D-class rematerialized and impacted the roof. D-class terminated.\n\n//Note: I was baffled by this until I looked at satellite photos of the place he wound up.

The bees proceeded to attack Junior Researcher Stan, who was waiting to conduct a test at the time. Upon reaching him, the swarm melted around his wrist, before taking the shape of a wax bracelet. The bracelet stung him several times before becoming inert.\n\n//Note: It seems the bracelet stingers were made of diamond, likely made out of carbon impurities in the honeycomb. Also, what about that other bet we made Stan? You know, the one about what was going to happen with the output to this test. -Researcher Festiv//\n\n//Note: Both Festiv and Stan are cleaning dishes and have cleanup duty for a week or two. They were treating my testing area like a bloody betting range rather than a professional testing environment.

The exterior of the grenades is labelled as \"Barr's Edible Gas\". D-51215 tested the grenades, which created a thick cloud of orange mist. When breathed in, the mist would condense on the tongue and form into carbonated Irn Bru.\n\n**Input:** Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** A spherical, translucent orange lump, carbonated gasses visibly bubble and move inside of it. The inside of the object sparkles, due to aluminium flakes floating inside of it. The object is the size of a Soccer Ball. It possess a clear membrane, that is permeable if pressed on, and becomes sticky. D-51215'S left hand sunk past this permeable layer and suffered chemical burns, while extracting his hand.\n\n//Note: I think 914 increased the acidity of the components that made up the Irn Bru. Not exactly the kind of improvement I was hoping for. We managed to extract it from the output booth, using a shovel. The Result was incinerated, I don't want to chance this thing developing a taste for human flesh or becoming the blob.//\n\n**Input:** Twelve 330ml cans of Barr's Irn Bru\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A 66.6cm tall aluminium statue of Mel Gibson, dressed as William Wallace from the movie, Braveheart. Standing on a small mound of girders. In one hand it held a smaller can of Irn Bru and in the other, it is holding a Scottish flag. The statue is coloured orange, white and blue, like the cans. The statue was held together by a sugary residue, made from the Irn Bru. It fell apart, shortly after being removed from the output box.\n\n**Input** The Result of the previous test\n**Setting** Rough\n**Result** A pile of scrap aluminium. An orange mist from and a small puddle of blue, white and orange paint.\n\n//Note: It deserved to be destroyed. That movie was an affront to historical accuracy. - Assistant Researcher Jack Dickie//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0795**\n**Name:** Dr. Matism\n**Date:** 17/05/2019\n**Total Items:** 5 Maps of Australia\n\n**Input:** One map\n**Setting:** Rough\n**Output:** Shredded paper and ink smeared all over the output booth\n\n**Input:** One map\n**Setting:** Coarse\n**Output:** Folded paper and a pool of ink\n\n**Input:** One map\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** One script of the song //Down Under// by Men At Work.\n\n**Input:** One map\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** One map titled //Where are things that want to kill you?//, with all of Australia highlighted.\n\n**Input:** One map\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** One origami button. When pressed, gravitational and magnetic fields within 200 meters of the button are reversed. Object incinerated.\n\n//Note: Since the cafeteria was in range and it was lunchtime, the entire ceiling is smeared with food. You get one guess who is cleaning that. - Veritas//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0796**\n**Name:** Assistant Researcher Erickson\n**Date:** 17/05/2019\n**Total Items:** 1 Desert Eagle (Loaded).\n\n**Input:** 1 Desert Eagle.\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** 1 Desert Eagle. --Changes unknown.-- Induces schizophrenia in the holder, at the expense of increased accuracy and stopping power.\n\n//Note: It tried to convince me to shoot Darby. Despite putting it in a secure storage locker 50 meters from where I am now, I can still hear it. I've barricaded myself in my room until the effect wears off. I left a slot under the door for people to slide in food and messages. - Assistant Researcher Erickson//\n\n//Note: Object incinerated. Someone let Assistant Researcher Imbecile out.- Veritas//\n\n-----\n\n**Test 914-0797**\n**Name:** Researcher Jane Cho\n**Date:** 17/05/2019\n**Total Items:** 3kg amethyst quartz\n\n**Input:** 1kg amethyst\n**Setting:** 1:1\n**Output:** 1kg citrine\n\n**Input:** 1kg amethyst\n**Setting:** Fine\n**Output:** A large quartz crystal with a rotating handle, labeled \"RAINBOWAMETHYST\". Turning the handle will change the color of the crystal through unknown means.\n\n**Input:** 1kg amethyst\n**Setting:** Very Fine\n**Output:** A clockwork machine shaped like a boat, composed entirely of amethyst. Two rotating handles are present on each side(herefore referred to as L1(left front), L2(left rear), R1(right front), R2(right rear) by their relative positions). L1 and R2 can only be rotated counterclockwise, and L2 and R1 can only be rotated clockwise. Rotating any handle individually does not result in anomalous behavior. However, when two or more handles are rotated simultaneously, the machine will act in various anomalous ways. Behavior is recorded below.\n||~ L1 ||~ L2 ||~ R1 ||~ R2 ||~ Behavior ||\n||= ##green|ON## ||= ##green|ON## ||= ##red|OFF## ||= ##red|OFF## || All subjects in contact with the object will be unable to see through their left eye for approximately 23 minutes. ||\n||= ##green|ON## ||= ##red|OFF## ||= ##green|ON## ||= ##red|OFF## || A focused beam of red(600~650nm) light will be emitted from the front of the object. The light is not powerful enough to significantly affect any surface. ||\n||= ##green|ON## ||= ##red|OFF## ||= ##red|OFF## ||= ##green|ON## || All subjects in contact with the object will simultaneously manifest a saline solution from their eyes.
