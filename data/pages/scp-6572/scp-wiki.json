Therefore, containment efforts are to be directed towards falsifying reported causes of death for SCP-6572's victims and explaining damage to infrastructure.[[footnote]]As of 9/12/2017, these containment procedures no longer apply.[[/footnote]]\n\n**Description:** SCP-6572 is a sword labelled as being able to cut through anything. It is not affected by friction. SCP-6572 also appears to be resistant to high temperatures and pressures. \n\nNo visual descriptions of SCP-6572 prior to classification exist. Cross-referencing characteristics of SCP-6572 with those of swords historically possessed by Marshall, Carter, and Dark has been deemed infeasible.\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-6572 was one of several unnoteworthy anomalous items seized in a raid on a Marshall, Carter, and Dark warehouse on 6/24/2002. \n\nDuring initial transit to the nearest Foundation site, the storage unit of SCP-6572 (later determined to utilize electromagnetic suspension) failed. SCP-6572 pierced its storage unit, destroying its MC&D unique identifier label, and proceeded to fall into the ground. SCP-6572 was presumed lost. \n\nOn 12/1/2002, witnesses in Perth, Australia reported that a man \"exploded into viscera\". High-speed camera footage suggested that the cause was SCP-6572. SCP-6572 travelled in a parabolic arc, reentering the earth approximately 30 meters away.\n\nIt is presumed that SCP-6572 will remerge in Bermuda, the antipode[[footnote]]Point on Earth directly opposite to another [[/footnote]] of Perth. SCP-6572 has been classified as Euclid.\n\n**Update 4/30/2003:** On 4/10/2003, witnesses reported that Donald Duck at Disneyland had been scattered across the park. Surveillance footage indicated that the cause of death was SCP-6572. It was determined that while SCP-6572 does not appear to be affected by friction, it is affected by lateral forces from convective currents present within earth's mantle and core, altering its velocity. As such, without a comprehensive model of the earth's mantle, it is impossible to accurately predict the trajectory of SCP-6572. SCP-6572 has been upgraded to Keter.\n\nA full list of SCP-6572 emergence events is available upon request. Over 50 emergence events have been directly observed. \n\n**Update 6/30/2010:** SCP-6572 appears to be accelerating. At every emergence event, SCP-6572 travels further before reentering the ground. It is estimated that SCP-6572 will escape from earth's gravity by 2020.\n\n**Update 9/30/2017:** SCP-6572 left earth's gravity well on 9/12/2017. Containment efforts are no longer necessary. SCP-6572 reclassified to Neutralized.\n\n> //No more dangerous than other space junk now. --Dr. Solstice//\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n[[=]]\n[[collapsible show=\"You Might Also Like...\" hide=\"Feel free to add this collapsible to your own articles!\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n[[[SCP-572]]] by [[*User DrClef]]\n[[[SCP-5792]]] by [[*User SleepSpell]]\n[[[SCP-5871]]] by [[*User aismallard]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:more-by:lordxvnv]]\n[[/=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** dustboom.jpg\n> **Author:** Sgt Armondo Monroig, USA\n> **License:** C0 (released to public no copyright restriction)\n> **Source Link:** https://nara.getarchive.net/media/dirt-and-debris-flies-into-the-air-as-an-artillery-shell-explodes-upon-impact-3bf7da\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
