While a reality warper, SCP-8590 does not currently pose a threat to the veil. Containment procedures are to be focused on tracking and documenting SCP-8590’s manifestations and behavior until it can be successfully, permanently contained.\n\n**Description:** SCP-8590 is a 32-year-old human male with reality-warping abilities, including teleportation, manifestation of objects, manipulation of a person's memory, and omniscience.\n\nSCP-8590 uses the combination of its incredibly powerful abilities to work menial, low-paying jobs. \n\nSCP-8590 appears throughout the contiguous United States, usually in the Midwest. How SCP-8590 chooses its locations is unknown; there does not appear to be a pattern. Identification on SCP-8590’s person (name tags, driver's license, etc) only displays the name \"Dale.\" The positions SCP-8590 holds change rapidly based on no known factor; most likely, SCP-8590 simply decides to have a new job and does so.\n\n**Addendum 8590.1:** Discovery and Initial Interactions\n\nDuring an unrelated investigation in Wisconsin, Foundation Agent Sarah Palmers encountered SCP-8590 when attempting to pick up a check from a local Goodwill.\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n= **GOODWILL SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TRANSCRIPT**\n-----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n//(Palmers approaches SCP-8590 in an aisle. She is holding a vase.)//\n\n**Palmers:** Excuse me?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Hm.\n\n**Palmers:** Is your manager here? I made a drop-off last week and needed to pick up my check.\n\n**SCP-8590:** He's not here today.\n\n**Palmers:** He said he would be here. Do you know when he'll be back?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Not in my job description to know that.\n\n**Palmers:** Alright. //[...]// Can you tell him to give me a call when he gets back?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I don't really like talking to him.\n\n**Palmers:** You're not being very helpful.\n\n**SCP-8590:** That's your opinion.\n\n**Palmers:** Uh... okay. I was looking at this vase. There's no sticker on it, do you know the price?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Take it.\n\n**Palmers:** Huh?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I wouldn't care if you burned this place to the ground with me in it. Take the vase.\n\n**Palmers:** Okay. Are you sure?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I do not care.\n\n**Palmers:** Alright. Thanks?\n\n//(Palmers moves towards the exit.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** //(Shouting.)// The manager's not gonna let you back in the store if you steal that.\n\n//(Palmers stops, then turns towards SCP-8590.)//\n\n**Palmers:** I'm not stealing anything.\n\n**SCP-8590:** You didn't pay for that.\n\n**Palmers:** You literally told me to take it.\n\n**SCP-8590:** I'm not gonna stop you from stealing. I'm just letting you know the manager isn't gonna be happy. He'd probably ban you.\n\n**Palmers:** Then let me buy the fucking thing!\n\n**SCP-8590:** There's no need to use that language, ma'am.\n\n//(SCP-8590 and Agent Palmers walk back to the cash register.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** Is that all today?\n\n**Palmers:** Jesus fu— yes. That's all.\n\n//(SCP-8590 scans the vase 100 times. Palmers stares, clearly losing patience.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** That'll be two thousand dollars.\n\n**Palmers:** Are you out of your mind?\n\n**SCP-8590:** No.\n\n**Palmers:** Two //thousand// dollars?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Yeah.\n\n**Palmers:** That's not odd to you?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I scanned it a hundred times.\n\n**Palmers:** Why the hell would you do that?\n\n**SCP-8590:** You didn't stop me. I thought you wanted a hundred of them.\n\n**Palmers:** I don't //want// a hundred vases. I want one.\n\n**SCP-8590:** You should have said that. \n\n**Palmers:** This is absurd!\n\n**SCP-8590:** Ma'am, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the store.\n\n**Palmers:** No no no. Don't worry. I'm on my way out anyway.\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n= **PARKING LOT SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TRANSCRIPT**\n-----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n//(Agent Palmers' car is being towed.)//\n\n**Palmers:** You've got to be kidding me!\n\n//(Palmers jogs to the tow truck. SCP-8590 is driving.)//\n\n**Palmers:** The hell? Are you towing my car because I didn't buy your vase?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Ma'am, that wouldn't make any sense. You double parked in the handicap section.\n\n**Palmers:** No— I... did I? I guess I did. Can you just help me out?\n\n**SCP-8590:** There's going to be a fine.\n\n**Palmers:** How much?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Do you want a hundred cars or just the one?\n\n**Palmers:** Oh my god. Just //my// car.\n\n**SCP-8590:** Two thousand dollars.\n\n**Palmers:** Are you serious?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I'm just doing my job.\n\n**Palmers:** //(Mumbling)// Stupid goddamn— Here.\n\n//(Palmers retrieves 2,000 dollars in cash from her handbag and hands it to SCP-8590.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** Would you like a bag?\n\n**Palmers:** What? //[...]// Sure?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Okay.\n\n//(SCP-8590 exits the tow truck and wraps the car in a car-sized plastic bag.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** Have a nice day.\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"interview\"]]\n= **PALMERS STATION SURVEILLANCE VIDEO TRANSCRIPT**\n-----\n= **<<BEGIN LOG>>**\n\n//(Agent Palmers' arrives home. She walks into the kitchen and places the very large plastic bag under the sink. Palmers steps in a puddle, then looks up. Her upstairs shower caused a leak in the kitchen.)//\n\n**Palmers:** Goddamn it!\n\n//(Agent Palmers calls a plumber.)//\n\n-----\n= **[25 minutes of extraneous footage redacted.]**\n-----\n\n//(A doorbell is rung. Agent Palmers approaches the door. SCP-8590 is waiting on the other side.)//\n\n**Palmers:** There's no way! Not you //again//!\n\n**SCP-8590:** I was called about a leak.\n\n**Palmers:** How many jobs do you have?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I'm just trying to feed my family, ma'am. \n\n**Palmers:** Do you know what you're doing? \n\n**SCP-8590:** I'm a plumber.\n\n**Palmers:** Are you accredited?\n\n**SCP-8590:** I am a plumber.\n\n**Palmers:** Oh my god. Oh my god. //[...]// Whatever.\n\n//(Agent Palmers guides SCP-8590 to the location of the leak.)//\n\n**Palmers:** Here.\n\n**SCP-8590:** Hm. Interesting. \n\n**Palmers:** What is?\n\n**SCP-8590:** You have a leak.\n\n**Palmers:** I think I'm losing my mind.\n\n//(SCP-8590 looks at the leaking ceiling.)//\n\n**SCP-8590:** Mhm. Alright. I see.\n\n**Palmers:** What? What do you see?\n\n**SCP-8590:** There's a leak here. I said that already.\n\n//(Agent Palmers cups her head in her hands.)//\n\n**Palmers:** Can— can you fix it?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Yes. This is just a routine pipe replacement.\n\n**Palmers:** Perfect. Thank you.\n\n**SCP-8590:** Wait. \n\n**Palmers:** What's wrong?\n\n**SCP-8590:** One more thing.\n\n**Palmers:** What?\n\n**SCP-8590:** Do you want a hundred pipes or just the one?\n\n= **<<END LOG>>**\n[[/div]]\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n-----\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-8589]]] | SCP-8590 | [[[SCP-8591]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n-----\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]",
