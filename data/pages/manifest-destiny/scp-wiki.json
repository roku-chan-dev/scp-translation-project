He takes the body up under the armpits and hoists it into his lap, so that it is held between his legs and within his arms like a lover, close enough to kiss. He is shirtless, and the red drips onto his skin in stains that dry black and grimy, grime upon grime, as he brings the knife forwards, forwards to cut.\n\nCome away the ears, into the flame, away the lips, into the flame, away the nose, into the flame, slide the steel into the damp flesh above the teeth and glide away through the muscles of the cheek. Draw, draw, draw in single smooth strokes, draw and rend, draw and cut, cut and cut and cut away in smooth strokes the taut skin, like a glove, a little of the stubble clinging on, until the dead eyes staring up at you shine like round pebbles dropped into tomato soup. Your hands are sticky to the elbows, and around the skull a neat little circle forms like a cap or a crown. Press your lips to that red-yellow grin, to that lipless smile, to that lover’s grimace as the smoke rises invisibly into the night. Draw, draw, draw, into the night. Draw, draw, draw.\n\nThey’ll find your camp in the morning, a while after your leave, and hard men will vomit into the sand and pray loud prayers as the ashes of your fire stir in the sullen wind. Ride into the desert, ride shirtless and bare and sticky and smiling a double man’s grin. Ride, ride, ride, ride hard, iron on your hip. Ride hard, American. Ride hard to die.\n\nFind you next on the field, wearing no uniform but the rifle in your hands, no flag but glory, no country but God’s country, God’s beautiful country of prairie and scrubland and mesa and fire and oil and smoke.  Thunder in the distance, thunder on the horizon, thunder in your boots, the cavalry rides for you. Thunder, thunder, thunder, and the line shakes like leaves in the wind. Hear now the shrill yipping, the hollering, the howling, wolves on horseback, hear now the sergeant bark stand to, a hundred rifles raised before the storm, a breathless second, two, before\n\n[[div class=\"fire\"]]\nFIRE\n[[/div]]\n\nand hear now the report, to drown their thunder with your own, FIRE, again, FIRE, again, FIRE, again, at will now, and then they are amongst you before a man can scarce breathe. Drop your gun and run as the wolves tear through the line, with pistols and shot and swords and long knives and lances and a thousand painted leather affects and totems and run, laughing as you go, laughing like the wind, for the man beside you is slow, and you are fast.\n\nThey’ll build statues of you and name parks and plazas in your honor and teach their children of the heroes, the men that tamed the West, who slugged that bitch in her pregnant stomach to teach her silence and civilization and good Christian calm. They’ll build statues of you for this, for killing and dying and running but now you run, uniformed and sweaty and laughing like the wind, run, run, run, run hard, American. Run hard to die.\n\nFind you next with four cups of whiskey boiling in your gut and iron in your hand and jangles a jangling’ on your boots as they kick in the saloon doors. It’s high noon, if it matters. It doesn’t matter. The whiskey burns like fire in your gut. The sun is warm on your skin. The boots feel good on your feet. The iron is good in your hands. The iron was made for your hands, it fell out of the sky three point two two million years ago and was buried in a mountain and then brought up and broken and smelted and poured and forged and cooled by Smith and Wesson Corporation in a line an eon long, unbroken express transit to you. One two three four five six and you laugh as you do it. One two three four five six. It doesn’t even matter if he’s there or not.\n\nOur table is set, our cup runneth over. The quiet waters run hot, the rivers are aflame. Our enemies are dead. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow us all the days of our lives.\n\nFind you next on some overpass, six lanes of red meeting six lanes of white. Some smoker, some bum, bent over the railing, stained hoodie aflutter in the exhaust and exhumation and ha ha, your hands are already in motion, giggling madly, and this time you don’t even do it for yourself, you don’t do it for the pleasure, you don’t do it because you want to, no, you do it for the land, for the system, for the one two threes and A BEE SEEs, maybe you’ve always done it for them even if your laughter is all your own, and he doesn’t even struggle as he tips neatly over the side and there’s a great squealing like the squealing of pigs in the temples at Babylon and Sodom, and you’re laughing with the wind as you walk, not run, walk, because who has time to stop?\n\nYou really didn’t do it for yourself this time, you really didn’t do it for yourself, you really didn’t do it for yourself, not yourself, you did it for the bones and veins of this great glorious country, for the god we raised from steel and stone, for the concrete god, for the howling god, for the god that never sleeps. We built him out of love, this great god of ours. We built him out of love, and pray that he may love us back. Your act was a prayer, American. Pray, pray, pray, pray hard, American. Pray hard to die.\n\nFind you next with a billy-club in your hand and a song upon your lips, standing in front of locked factory gates. Find you next kneeling in the hot earth before a roaring black geyser. Find you next with spittle flying from your lips as you cajole and command in the humidity and the stink of a closed-air tent. Find you next in a pressed Armani with a Blackberry in your hands, two of them held up to either ear. Find you next with a belt and a bottle of Tennessee blue. Find you next kneeling on his neck. Find you next laughing with your neighbors. Find you next peering at dim gray boxes as the kill-chain screams through your earpiece like the voice of God. Find you next.\n\nFind you next.\n\nGod Bless America.\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[div class=\"president\"]]\nI have walked in white halls of power,\nbeneath thrumming veins of gold,\nSeen the sun rise, Canaveral,\nTread that aching dreamer’s road-\nStood astride the green colossus,\nWith its brazen wing'd frame,\nNot just Liberty, but prosperity,\nThat we've claimed and aim to claim,\nI've sat side by side with superstars,\nMet men of wealth and fame,\nEaten longhorn steak off the grill,\nIn a ranch house beneath the shade,\nFired .50 BMG\nAnd in the mighty deserts ascertained\nTruth, and saw God\nWhat more cathedrals do we need?\nCages of truth and history,\nfrom such things\nWe, in this land, \nare free\n[[/div]]\n------\n= **<< [[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/greenlight| GREENLIGHT]]] ||MANIFEST DESTINY|| [[[gaslight|GASLIGHT]]] >>**\n------\n[[=]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box\n|author=Intercedent]]\n=====\n> **Filename:** Buffalo_skull_pile_edit.jpg\n> **Author:** Intercedent\n> **License:** Public Domain\n> **Source Link:** [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bison_skull_pile_edit.jpg]\n\n> **Filename:** PENTOSTAMP.png\n> **Author:** Anorrack\n> **License:** CC BY-SA 3.0\n> **Source Link:** [https://imgur.com/a/budl6AE]\n=====\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]\n[[/=]]\n[[module css]]\n\n#page-title {display: none;}\n\n:root {\n    --header-title: \"IN GOD WE TRUST\";\n    --header-subtitle: \"\";\n    --link-txt-color: rgb(var(--accent));\n    --logo-img: url(\"http://scp-sandbox-3.wikidot.com/local--files/strikefall/PENTOSTAMP.png\");\n    --header-txt-color: #d61c0f;\n    --misc-txt-color: #d61c0f;\n    --logo-opacity: 70%;\n    --link-txt-color: #d61c0f;\n}\n\n.hovertip {\n  color: #000000;\n}\n\n.licensebox {\n  color: #ff0000;\n}\n\nbody {\n  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, #660000, #000000 120px);\n  color: #F5F5F5;\n}\n\n#toc {\n  background-color: #000000;\n}\n\n#header h2::before {\n    text-transform: capitalize;\n    font-style: italic;\n}\n\n.notation {\n    border-width: 4px;\n    width: 75%;\n    margin: auto;\n    border-color: rgb(var(--accent));\n    text-align: justify;\n}\n\n.separation {\n    margin: 1ex 15%;\n    padding: 0;\n    border-top: 0.2rem solid #275495;\n    display: block;\n}\n\n.dictation {\n   font-family: Garamond, serif;\n   color: #F5F5F5;\n   font-size: 21px;\n}\n\n.fire {\n   font-family: monospace;\n   color: #FF0000;\n   font-size: 35px;\n}\n\n.elaimal, .president, .al-fine, .vanguard, {\n    width: 85%;\n    margin: auto;\n    padding: 15px;\n    box-shadow: 0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,.2);\n}\n\n.elaimal {\n    border: solid 2.5px #fff0ba;\n    background-color:#fff0ba;\n    color: #4B0101;\n    font-family: Times New Roman;\n}\n\n\n.president {\n    font-family: monospace;\n    border: solid 2.5px #FF0000;\n    background-color:#000000;\n    color: #FF0000;\n    text-align: center;\n}\n\n.al-fine {\n    border: solid 4px #275495;\n    background: #F2F7FB url('https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/theme%3Agoc/goc-fade.png') center no-repeat;\n}\n\n.vanguard {\n    border: solid 4px #275495;\n    background: #F2F7FB center no-repeat;\n}\n\ndiv.blockquote {\n    padding-right: 2rem;\n    padding-top: 1rem;\n    border-right: solid 7px rgb(var(--accent)) !important;\n    margin: 1em 1.75em;\n}\n\n.blockquote .image-container {\n    padding: 0em;\n}\n\n.characters {\n    margin-top: -1em;\n    margin-bottom: 1em;\n    margin-left: 15px;\n    margin-right: 10px;\n}\n\n.characters-top {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-flow: row nowrap;\n    align-items: center;\n    gap: 16px;\n}\n\n.bar {\n    width: 12px;\n    height: 85px;\n}\n\n.characters-info {\n    flex-grow: 1;\n}\n\n.characters-info p {\n    line-height: 200%;\n}\n\n.bio {\n    margin-top: -20px;\n}\n\n.goc {\n    --color: #5f95e6;\n}\n\n.us {\n    --color: #404d7e;\n}\n\n.joicl {\n    --color: #d7003a;\n}\n\n.phoenix {\n    --color: #d68300;\n}\n\n.mcd {\n    --color: #8c148c;\n}\n\n.van {\n    --color: #4b2;\n}\n\n.bar {\n    background-color: var(--color);\n}\n[[/module]]",
