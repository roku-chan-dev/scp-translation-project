In light of the public profile of SCP-4709's planning and construction, a cover story about the resort's financial troubles and ultimate failure was disseminated.\n\nFringe media and web postings regarding the existence of SCP-4709 or its history are to be either discouraged, ignored, or destroyed as per the guidelines set forth by the 'Iron-Curtain-IV' information protocols.  Consult the Department of Miscommunication's External Communications Handbook for additional guidance.\n\nAll personnel assigned to SCP-4709 are to be equipped with a passive listening device which has been configured to detect Frank Sinatra's 1967 rendition of 'The Girl from Ipanema'.  Any positive identification of the song is to trigger an evacuation of SCP-4709 to a minimum safe distance of 30-meters.  Normal activities may resume at the discretion of the ranking safety officer or after 60-minutes.\n\n\n**Description:** SCP-4709 is a temporal and spatial instability within 'The Grand Tahoe Resort & Hotel', near Tahoma, California.  Although the effects of the anomaly are wholly contained within the building, the presence of the hotel itself is anomalous and is to be considered an inert component of the object.  //See Discovery.Log.4709 for additional details.//\n\nExposure to SCP-4709 results in the rapid fluctuation of baseline reality including the inconsistent passage of time, an inconsistent internal topography, alterations to fundamental constants, and involuntary ontokinesis[[footnote]]The ability of a person to manipulate reality according to their own beliefs.[[/footnote]].  As no pattern or consistency in such events has been established, these incidents are collectively designated as SCP-4709-1.\n\nA humanoid entity designated as SCP-4709-2 has been observed within the boundaries of the anomaly and demonstrates broad ontokinetic control over SCP-4709.  As the nature and disposition of this entity are currently unknown, further contact is inadvisable and is to be reported immediately.\n\n-----\n\n**Discovery.Log.4709:**\n\nIn the Fall of 2005, POI-4709 Jacob Pendleton announced the acquisition of several acres of real estate on the California shore of Lake Tahoe.  An already-established real estate developer, Pendleton was able to secure a number of investors in order to break ground on construction in early March of 2006.\n\nDuring excavation, crews reported to the job site on the morning of 2006-03-23 and observed the presence of a seven-story hotel fully completed to the specifications set forth by the developer, despite having broken ground only three days prior.  A number of calls were made to POI-4709 as well as various third parties before Foundation assets in the area were made aware of the event.\n\nMonitoring Task Force Rho-3 (\"The Hills Have Eyes\") was able to control and stem the flow of information and affect containment.\n\n-----\n\n[[collapsible show=\"Open Exploration.Log.4709.1: Reception\" hide=\"Close Secure Connection\"]]\n> **[Dateline: 2006-04-09]**\n> **Assignment:** MTF Epsilon-6 (\"Village Idiots\")\n> **Foreword:** MTF reconnaissance agents equipped with standard-issue field gear.

The drone is equipped with digital and optical cameras as well as .22 caliber firearm with rubber bullets.\n> \n> //Drone footage begins as the device takes flight and heads toward the hotel.  MTF agents standing near the door remove a locking mechanism.  The drone is allowed egress into the interior and the door is closed behind it.  The camera pans left to right before drifting further into the main lobby.//\n> \n> //The lobby features a vaulted ceiling with ornate bronze molding, marble pillars, and a polished granite floor.  Numerous lights are on and music can be heard coming through overhead speakers, although distortions have made the sound quality insufficient to distinguish.//\n> \n> //Drone continues onward, checking behind the reception counter and the remainder of the lobby and encountering nothing of note.  The camera pans to observe block-letter words that spell 'Continental' above an open double door within the lobby.  The drone enters the room.//\n> \n> //The interior of the 'Continental' room features cracked and warped wood paneling, showing signs of advanced decay inconsistent with new construction.  These pieces of paneling sit next to and blend with other pieces that appear to be new suggesting either a serious fault in manufactury or the consequences of an unobserved environmental anomaly.//\n> \n> //The drone approaches the paneling to take pictures.  As it does so, the space around the drone begins rapidly expanding.  Walls, ceiling, and floor rush away at tremendous speeds until they are no longer distinguishable from the horizon.  The sounds of plastic and metal stretching and being warped are heard as the housing of the drone sheers.//\n> \n> //The digital camera mounted to the drone separates from its housing and falls away.  As it falls and begins to tumble, the drone can still be seen above.  A red haze enters the frame from the right, moving left, and obscures the drone.  The haze continues to advance, eventually reaching the falling camera as small droplets begin to collect on its lens.  Soon, the lens becomes occluded.//\n> \n> //The falling digital camera impacts something unseen and begins to move at a high rate of speed in a perpendicular direction.  The velocity is such that the material covering the lens begins to thin, bead, and run off of the glass.  The distorted image of the hotel reception desk is visible through the red material for a split second before the camera strikes the counter and stops broadcasting.//\n> \n> //The digital camera and recording device were successfully recovered from the lobby having apparently been ejected from the 'Continental' room.

If you want, you can stay here and dream with me too.\"\n> \n> **Kerig:** \"I have no idea what that's supposed to mean so if you could just rephrase that I'll be--\" //Kerig is cut off by a sharp cough and choking sound.  Some sort of thick liquid is expelled from her mouth and cascades down past the camera.  Agent Kerig collapses onto her hands and knees vomiting a thick, off-white substance onto the floor.//\n> \n> //Kerig sits back up slowly, regarding her own hands which tremble severely.  She clears her throat and spits out another mouthful of the substance.//\n> \n> **Kerig:** \"What's happening to me?\"\n> \n> **SCP-4709-2:** \"Let's call it the check-in procedure.\"\n> \n> **Kerig:** \"...I don't feel well...I need to go, stop this, please.  Right now.\"\n> \n> //SCP-4709-2 uncrosses his legs and stands up, continuing to stoke his pipe as he slips a hand into his pants pocket.//\n> \n> //Kerig further regards her own hands; the white material which had splashed onto her skin is spidering and expanding covering more of her body.  The sound of the material tightening, hardening, and cracking becomes louder and more pronounced.  Agent Kerig screams, leaping to her feet, and runs from the room.  She takes a right down the hallway at a full sprint.//\n> \n> //As she continues to run, her stride is frequently interrupted by loud crunching and cracking sounds which are punctuated by sharp cries of pain from Agent Kerig.  A window and the end of the hallway both come into view.  Her pace continuing to slow, Agent Kerig pulls her bodycam off and holds it in her hand.//\n> \n> //The camera captures several additional frames of Agent Kerig's face, now mostly covered in the off-white substance which is hardening into a porcelain-like finish.  As Kerig nears the window, she pulls back her right arm and attempts to launch it through the glass but her arm snaps, detaches, and falls to the ground still holding the camera.  She screams out in pain, collapsing onto the floor next to the camera but she is unable to cry any further.//\n> \n> //As the last visible portion of her face hardens, she uses her still-mobile left hand to pick up the camera.  Agent Kerig approached the window and auto-defenestrates.//\n> \n> //Recording ends as Agent Kerig collides with the ground.//\n> \n> //Agents Brown and Mariota have yet to be recovered.//\n> \n> [[=]]\n> **[End Log]**\n> [[/=]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n@@ @@\n-----\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-4708]]] | [[[ManyMeats]]] | [[[SCP-4710]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
