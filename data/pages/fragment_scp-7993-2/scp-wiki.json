Changes from the previous version are in ##blue|blue##. There are newer versions available.\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= 7993\n|clearance=  2\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= argus\n|secondary-icon= http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/zackvmk-s-acs-icon-page/Argus.svg\n|disruption-class= vlam\n|risk-class= caution\n]]\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Radio and television broadcasts across North America are monitored regularly by the Telecommunications Department, headquartered in Site-84. ##blue|Foundation containment efforts are limited to monitoring for SCP-7993 activations. All reports of SCP-7993 are to be forwarded to PENTAGRAM, headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Non-Foundation individuals that view or listen to an SCP-7993 broadcast shall be detained and amnesticized.##\n\n**Description:** SCP-7993 is an anomalous radio broadcast emitting from the current center of population in the United States[[footnote]] Currently, St. Clair County, Illinois [[/footnote]]. SCP-7993 possesses the ability to hijack radio and television receivers. SCP-7993 tends to hijack receivers that were previously relaying media related to or covering discussions about the United States##blue|, NATO, the United Nations, and military operations relating to these subjects. SCP-7993 has become sparsely active, only broadcasting on average every six months. Individuals targeted by SCP-7993 have no common traits other than being citizens of North America.## \n\nAll individuals are susceptible to SCP-7993's anomalous effects regardless of cognitohazard resistance. SCP-7993-A is the designation given to any individual under the influence of an SCP-7993 broadcast. SCP-7993-A instances maintain an anti-war, anti-militarization stance, regardless of prior opinions. ##blue| SCP-7993-A instances dedicate a significant portion of their time to protesting or protesting-related activities. Protests involving SCP-7993-A instances are frequently hostile towards government personnel, United States citizens, and U.N. officials. Despite this, SCP-7993-A instances have yet to cause any bodily harm to any human being.##\n\nSCP-7993 contents are often outlandish, frequently featuring both urban and non-urban combat footage,[[footnote]] No footage has been linked to any real-world events, as is the case with the majority of SCP-7993 broadcast footage[[/footnote]] recordings of nuclear weapon tests, audio of incoherent speeches, and unidentified symbols[[footnote]] To date, April 12th, 1969, no symbol has shown any anomalous properties outside of their original SCP-7993 broadcast [[/footnote]].\n\n**Discovery:** SCP-7993 was discovered on December 12th, 1949, when reports of unusual protests near White Sands Proving Ground [[footnote]] A USAAF Atomic Bomb testing ground[[/footnote]], New Mexico. It was later discovered that between the times of 1630 and 1730, all thirteen SCP-7993-A individuals involved were driving to their residences after work[[footnote]] All thirteen instances worked various civilian jobs on the base [[/footnote]] and were all listening to their car radios before they all were subject to an SCP-7993 broadcast. However, due to the spontaneous nature of SCP-7993 and the technical limitations of the dispatching field office, only one interview was recorded on tape.\n\n**Addendum:**\n##b01| + Interview-7993|12/12/1949##\n##b01| + Level 3-Project Protector brief##\n\n**Addendum.b|Interview-7993|12/12/1949-Closing Statement:** ##blue|On October 27th, 1967, all thirteen individuals involved in this incident began to protest more in line with recent SCP-7993-A instances, featuring a more direct and hostile approach. As such, all thirteen individuals have since been detained by PENTAGRAM officials.##\n\n\n[[collapsible show=\"+ 1967 United States-Foundation Operational Cooperation Agreement\" hide=\"- Hide\"]]\n\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n+ United States-Foundation Operational Cooperation Agreement\n\n++++ APPROVED BY PRESIDENT L.B. JOHNSON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES & DIR. OF PENTAGRAM.\n\n------\n\n**Classification:** Classified, Urgent\n\n**Parties Involved:** United States Federal Government, The Foundation.\n\n**Foreword:** The following agreement was established as ordered by the current President of The United States via Executive Order 11310, which declared the actions taken by the Foundation on the 27th of October in the year 1967 as a direct attack on the United States, thus requiring the annexing of all Foundation assets located in the United States. \n\nActions taken by the Foundation against the United States are numerous, but the primary offense was the deliberate assistance of the USSR via the neutralization of all NATO nuclear warheads. This directly led to the deaths of approximately ninety million civilians and was a part of a previously established program by The Foundation, documented as \"Project Protector\".\n\n**Action Plan:** All Foundation assets in United States territory must be appropriately transferred to Federal control. All contacts with foreign Foundation assets are to be controlled by the United States Department of State. \n\nAnomalous objects contained by the Foundation deemed a risk to the United States or considered too expensive with no outstanding scientific value are to be neutralized. Along with this, United States Auditors are to inspect the necessity of every Foundation Site to identify any excess expenditures and are to recommend any beneficial liquidation of Foundation assets. \n\nThe Foundation's range of operation is also to be limited to North America and will be monitored by the United States Federal Government's paranormal containment agency, PENTAGRAM. Following this, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Unusual Incident Unit will be given a budget increase of two hundred billion dollars and will be expected to work closely with both The Foundation and PENTAGRAM.\n\n**Resulting Action:** All Foundation assets in United States territory were transferred over to the United States Federal Government with expected complications, which were dealt with equal military force. A review of Foundation assets has led to a fifty-five percent cut in expenditure as a result of the neutralization of two-thousand four hundred and fifty-four anomalies and the closure of thirty sites. UIU operations in the United States have increased due to a higher budget as well as the utilization of newly acquired Foundation assets previously unobtainable to the United States. \n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Site-84 Incident|10/27/1967\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **INCIDENT REPORT**\n----\n**DATE:** October 27th, 1967\n\n**NOTE:** \n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**2130:** Outer security breach detected at Site-84, identified as United States Military personnel.\n\n**2131:** Initial aerial bombardment of Site-84's MTF wing begin, superficially damaging the outside. At the same time, the U.S. Military personnel, led by Gen. Bowe demand Site-84's surrender. Site Director Cassilo denies this.\n\n**2134:** MTF Stigma-84 is mobilized and orders Gen. Bowe to leave the area. As this order is issued, several members of PENTAGRAM are spotted inside Site-84. Site-84's telecommunications wing is hit and severely damaged by a missile strike. In response to the missile strike MTF Stigma-84 fires on U.S. Military personnel.\n\n**2140:** MTF Stigma-84 has at this point sustained significant casualties, and calls for backup. This request is denied due to a lack of available MTF units. Site Director Cassilo declares a security breach as PENTAGRAM agents are spotted in Site-84's telecommunications wing, they appear to be searching for a specific object.\n\n**2145:** Site-84's external defenses are compromised as the remaining MTF Stigma-84 surrender. Site Director Cassilo orders all remaining Foundation personnel to surrender peacefully. PENTAGRAM personnel find SCP-7993's documentation, securing it on their persons before reporting to the U.S. Military personnel that are now in Site-84's main lobby.\n\n**2210:** Site-84 declared as compromised when Site Director Cassilo surrenders the Site to United States control.\n\n-----\n\n[END LOG]\n\n[[/div]]\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n**Addendum.c:** The following was recovered from the GOC archives and serves as an example of overseas SCP-7993 influence. Reminder, the following document should not be used outside of this document.\n\n\n[[collapsible hideLocation=\"both\" show=\"+ Recovered GOC document, partial\" hide=\"- Close\"]]\n[[div style=\"border:solid 2px #112211; background:#f4f4f4; padding:25px; margin-bottom: 25px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n+++ **[PHYSICS] ANALYSIS COMPILATION**\n+++++ **FOCUS : LTE-8491**\n+++++ **[EXTRACTS #2]**\n+++++ @@---------------@@\n[[/=]]\n\n= **ANALYSIS OF LTE-8491 EMITTED FROM THE POPULATION CENTER OF THE UNITED STATES.**\n\nAnalysis of LTE-8491 proves it is inconsistent in what broadcast frequency it uses. Individuals subject to LTE-8491 display changes consistent with previous tests, which are rapid personality changes that cause an individual to protest all military activity, emphasizing nuclear weapons. Individuals remain consistent in disliking countries based on their military activity, as such an emphasis is often put on the United States and the USSR, along with their pacts.\n\nReports of LTE-8491 reaching outside of North America have yet to be proven. Efforts to exchange information on LTE-8491 and the Foundation's SCP-7993 have been offered by the GOC but have been denied.\n\nConflicts caused by the United States, specifically those in Europe and Asia, have significantly hindered GOC operations due to a lack of funding from the United States and the majority of U.N. resources going towards the conflict. Research into LTE-8491 has been hindered as a result of this, but nonetheless, it has proven that LTE-8491 remains relatively unchanged, save for a noted decrease in activity.\n\n= **END OF EXTRACT**\n\n[[/div]]\n\n\n[[/collapsible]]\n\n[[div style=\"border:solid 1px #999999; background:#f2f2c2; padding:5px; margin-bottom: 10px;\"]]\n[[=]]\n\n[[<]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7993|PREVIOUS ITERATION]]]\n[[/<]]\n\n[[>]]\n[[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-7993/offset/2|NEXT ITERATION]]]\n[[/>]]\n\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]\n\n\n\n\n\n[[footnoteblock]]\n\n[[div class=\"footer-wikiwalk-nav\"]]\n[[=]]\n<< [[[SCP-7992]]] | SCP-7993 | [[[SCP-7994]]] >>\n[[/=]]\n[[/div]]",
