Sorry I couldn't *exactly* follow what you requested. I am godawful with CSS, and I couldn't think of anything to write that would expand hunter industries.\n\nInstead, I drew this. It was stressful but I'm thankful it's out by now. So, uh, here you go! If you do write any more of HI, hit me up and I might draw something else for it.\n\nThank you,\n\nYour gifter, TroutMaskReplica\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n----\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n[[include component:wikimodule |ratings= --]]]",
