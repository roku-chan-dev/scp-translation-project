The electronic archive data is synchronized and verified once a year to ensure that the archives in each archive are intact. The condition of the film will be checked once every 20 years. If there is any damage, the site must immediately request a reprint from Site-19.\n\nIf the observer array is offline, each storage branch must receive confirmation from Site-19 and reprint the film based on the current available capacity of each branch. The fastest way to implement this is to send a copy of SCP-CN-2999 to Site-19 to assist in restoring or rebuilding the observer array within thirty minutes to reduce the probability of a \"loss of focus\" event. The Ministry must immediately enter a state of emergency in preparation for a possible \"Broken Veil\" scenario and the implementation of the Ganymede Protocol.\n\nPersonnel other than Level 5/CN-2999 are prohibited from obtaining any information related to SCP-CN-2999 or the Observer Array.\n\n**Description:** SCP-CN-2999 is the design document of the current internal classifier of the Observer Array, including the complete artificial neural network design and list of neuron parameters. The complete list of editors is no longer available, but the last editor was Dr. Cheng Jiuzhang, director of Site-CN-25 of the Foundation's China branch (-1 relative iteration). After lossless compression using a special algorithm, the size of SCP-CN-2999 is 162TB, and it is currently used in a total of [[span class=\"redacted\"]]XX[[/span]] observer arrays around the world.\n\nThe OBSR-3 observer array that implements SCP-CN-2999 can complete the complete semantic classification of all vector image points in an observation within 42ms, with a classification accuracy of 99.99963%. In conjunction with the Foundation's global monitoring system and the biological monitoring chip that has been implanted within the genetic material of all human beings, it is sufficient to replace the previous observer and stabilize the current consensus reality.\n\nSCP-CN-2999 was designed in the previous iteration. According to the instructions of the Yellowstone Commission, all original documents that have been obtained have been sealed, and only the following appendix is ​​provided for basic reference.\n\n**Addendum I - Observer Death Event:** 10/02/2021 (-1 relative iteration, the same below), the previous observer died in the Site-19 intensive care unit at 08:45:57. O5 Command held an emergency meeting three hours later to discuss how to respond to the ZK-class Reality Failure scenario. 11/02/2021, the Foundation announced that \"the veil has been broken\". 17/02/2021, the Foundation has completed the suppression of all opposition armed forces, 21 surviving human settlements have been established, and the Foundation has taken over the global order.\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock \"]]\n[[size larger]]**Audio Log - Last Words of Previous Observer**[[/size]]\nSite-19, 10/02/2021\n\n-----\n\n= **<Begin Log>**\n\n**O5-1:** How ​​is he doing?\n\n**Medic:** It's about time…He can still talk, but he won't make it through the day…I'm sorry, sir, //(sobs)// We've tried our best…\n\n**O5-1:** Don't be sorry, Sibyl, we all knew this would come, and no one will blame you. //(pause)// He can still talk, right?\n\n**Medic:** Um… he can, do you need to see him alone?\n\n**O5-1:** Yes, Sibyl, thank you, you can go back first, I'll be fine here.\n\n**Medic:** Yes, sir…\n\n//Sound of electric door opening and closing.//\n\n**O5-1:** Can you see me?\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**Observer:** //(heavy breathing)// I can… child… just the same… just like when you were born.\n\n**O5-1:** //(laughing)// My mom said I gave her a hard time when I was born.\n\n**Observer:** Yes, I saw you. I watched you being born… watching you grow… watching you love, hate, step by step, to where you are today, at this moment… just like everyone else, just like all life, just like all… all…\n\n//(Coughing.)//\n\n**O5-1:** I'm sorry… we screwed up, all of us screwed up, it didn't have to be like this. This is all our fault, my fault…\n\n**Observer:** //(interruption)// Don't apologize, don't… say such things.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**O5-1:** Can you still see now? What do you see?\n\n**Observer:** I… I see a fish swimming in the ocean. It… its body is blue, its red fins are like fans… it slowly exhales a bubble… I see a magnet the size of a finger trembling… I see St. Peter's Basilica under the clear blue sky… I see a citrus tree bearing fruit, the green fruit slowly ripening… I see thirty-four grams of gold melting… I see a spider in the Amazon rainforest spinning its web… I see roses, roses are roses, are roses… are roses…\n\n//(Coughs.)//\n\n**O5-1:** No… no more.\n\n**Observer:** Don't worry about me, child… I will do my duty until my last moment.\n\n**O5-1:** I never doubted it. It's just that we have to deal with this, after you—and we don't have time.\n\n**Observer:** I believe you can do it.\n\n**O5-1:** But we are too slow. We need more time.\n\n**Observer:** Not right away. The world will not forget me so quickly.\n\n**O5-1:** Less than two years... I am afraid we will be too late.\n\n**Observer:** Are you abandoning your faith, Aaron?\n\n**O5-1:** Maybe. I have been in this position for a long time... This is the worst I have ever expected.\n\n**Observer:** But you can always handle it. Always have faith in your men, Aaron... They need you, the decisive you... You will find a way to replace me, and the world will continue...

I believe you have received the news that the Observer passed away three hours ago. Relevant instructions have been issued to all branches. All non-emergency work is suspended and all MTFs are on standby. I don't think I need to emphasize that we don't have much time. We need to deal with a ZK-Class Reality Failure Scenario caused by the death of the Observer. At this meeting today, we will immediately decide on the next step...\n\n**O5-2:** //(interrupts)// Before that, Aaron, please let me clarify one thing.\n\n**O5-1:** …Of course, Sophia, what is it?\n\n**O5-2:** I would like to resign from the O5 position, effective immediately.\n\n**O5-1:** What?\n\n**O5-2:** I think it's obvious, isn't it? I take full responsibility for what has happened. It was me and the Strategic Theology Department that I led that made this unforgivable mistake. It was us… no, it was me, who broke down the door to the Temple and brought the Observer down from his throne. It was me who ignored the warning to \"Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the test,\" and on me shall be the blood that is to be shed. This is it, Aaron. I am unworthy of the position of O5 any longer, and I… I must leave, while I still can.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**O5-1:** He never blamed you.\n\n**O5-2:** He?\n\n**O5-1:** He never blamed you, Observer. Even without you, this would still have happened, just a hundred years later at most, and he told us so long ago.\n\n**O5-2:** But we could have had more time to prepare…\n\n**O5-1:** //(interrupts)// We always need more time. We always work well under tight conditions, and I don't think this will be an exception. Sophia… I don't want to hear you talk about resigning again. We need you now more than ever. We can't make it through this without you continuing to use your talents in your position.\n\n**O5-9:** He's right, Sophia, we need you.\n\n**O5-5:** Oh, it's not the first time we've screwed up. It's nothing, Sophia, stay strong.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**O5-1:** If there is nothing else, let's resume normal procedures. //(pause)// Omar, have we observed any \"loss of focus\" events?\n\n**O5-12:** Yes, unfortunately, there are four suspected. The first was in Antarctica, at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, where a researcher discovered that his coffee had turned into oil. The second was in Brasilia, where a kid just walked out of a mall onto the street, and his newly bought soccer ball turned into a barred owl in front of everyone. The third - and this one resulted in casualties - a 14-year-old girl in Omaha had her dental braces turn into nitroglycerin, which immediately exploded, and she was not recovered. The fourth was just before a meeting, when the dial of my Rolex watch turned into expired blueberry-flavored jelly. There may be more, but they happened in remote areas and cannot be found for the time being.\n\n**O5-1:** Can we confirm that they are indeed \"out of focus\" events, and not caused by other anomalies?\n\n**O5-12:** I can't say for sure yet, but my instinct tells me that they are.\n\n**O5-1:** Trust your instinct. Where are these objects now?\n\n**O5-12:** They are being moved. I asked Red Right Hand to retrieve them as soon as possible. I will move them all to Provisional-Area-3706. Donna suggested it.\n\n**O5-9:** It's in the middle of the Sahara Desert, nowhere in the world, and we'll use the best adaptive containment chambers, the largest. But if it's really a \"defocus\" event, it won't contain them for long. No one knows if one of them will suddenly turn into a black hole of equal mass or something.\n\n**O5-1:** It won't turn into a black hole. The observer said it was out of range.\n\n**O5-9:** You know what I mean. There are enough things in range to end the game right away.\n\n**O5-1:** I know. Thanks, Omar, Donna. //(pause)// How's the veil now, Sam?\n\n**O5-11:** No problem yet. Those four incidents were just a piece of cake, just a little cover story and some fogging to get by. //(pause)// I know what you're thinking, Aaron, what you have to worry about is what happens next. According to the predictions given to us by the Observer before his death, with the resources we have now, we can only keep it a secret for one to two years, at most two and a half years, that's it.\n\n**O5-1:** I don't intend to keep it that long, the risk is too great, and it's a waste of resources. I propose to declare \"The Veil Broken\" immediately, does anyone have any objections?\n\n//(Silence)//\n\n**O5-13:** Have we finally come to this point, haha.\n\n**O5-7:** This has always been a possibility, as we saw clearly more than a decade ago.\n\n**O5-6:** That's right. Fortunately, we are not empty-handed and unprepared.\n\n**O5-2:** There will be resistance... There will be people who don't want us to take over like this.\n\n**O5-6:** What's the saying? \"It's not a dinner party\", no, it seems different in this context... Never mind, it's not important. We have enough military power to ensure that there will be no problems.\n\n**O5-1:** Looks like everyone is on the same page. Jean, you know what to do.\n\n**O5-4:** Got it. I'll call the UN when this meeting is over.\n\n**O5-1:** Don't rush it, but don't let them dwell on it for too long, lest they think they can handle it.\n\n**O5-4:** Got it.\n\n**O5-1:** Next item, then. //(pause)// We need to conserve our resources, and delay or even eliminate their \"defocus\" as much as possible. We need to prioritize. Diane, what do you think?\n\n**O5-10:** You're asking a question you already know the answer to, Aaron.\n\n**O5-1:** I need your confirmation.\n\n//(Silence.)//\n\n**O5-10:** [[[SCP-2000]]]. This is top priority. If it's \"defocused,\" nothing we can do will help.\n\n**O5-8:** I thought you were going to say us.\n\n**O5-10:** You know it all, Leeman. Our bodies don't matter. If it's gone, even if we solve the observer problem, we alone won't be able to restore normalcy. Besides, Yellowstone can always produce a batch of us if needed, and this wouldn't be the first time.\n\n**O5-8:** Okay, okay, stop it, Diane, the thought still keeps me up at night sometimes.\n\n**O5-10:** Shh. //(pause)// The only problem is, fast, the faster the better.\n\n**O5-1:** Just as I thought, thanks, Diane. Kid? How's your side? How's the progress on the replacement observer?\n\n**O5-3:** The answer to that question is the same as I gave you last week: artificial intelligence. There's no other way.\n\n**O5-1:** Has human body modification been confirmed to not work?\n\n**O5-3:** It was confirmed two weeks ago that it wouldn't work, and there's a lot of experimental data. No body can withstand this level of thought intensity, and that's not even considering eating, drinking, defecating, and urinating. Homo sapiens is not developing in this direction. It's no easier to turn a living human into an observer than to build an AI that meets the requirements. It may even be harder.\n\n**O5-5:** Then why was our lovely former observer fine?\n\n**O5-3:** Stupid? He's not human.\n\n**O5-1:** Got it, Kid, just do what you want. The first goal is to stabilize SCP-2000, and we should prioritize development in that direction. It's a non-living thing, and developing an observer AI for it should have fewer restrictions. But we still have to deal with observing everything, including ourselves. //(pause)// We have to make a new observer, it's up to you, Kid.\n\n**O5-3:** Oof.\n\n**O5-1:** That's all I have to say, does anyone have anything to add? //(pause)// Okay. I know this is a difficult time, and it's just the beginning. As Sam said, we can only withstand \"out of focus\" for two years at most. While the Observer Effect has not completely dissipated, we must seize these two years and not waste a single minute. I need everyone to be at their best. Do what needs to be done, and I wish you all good luck. Meeting adjourned.\n\n= **<End of Log>**\n[[/div]]\n\n**Appendix II - Data Collection:** The following data was collected from the previous iteration of Foundation sites and human settlement sites. It is believed that it records the \"out-of-focus\" events and the operation of the Foundation from 2021 to 2022 due to the continued dissipation of the Observer Effect. Most of the people involved in the data are no longer traceable.\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock memo\"]]\n**Type: Human Settlement Broadcast**\nHS-EU-01, 04/03/2021\n\n-----\n\n[Electronic Synthetic Music]\n\nAttention residents of the settlement.

No \"defocus\" that has been recorded so far has exceeded two kilograms. Is there any evidence?\n\n**Man A:** No, he lives alone. He's making a lot of noise here now.\n\n**Man B:** I think it's likely that he's trying to cheat for supplies.\n\n**Man A:** I think so too, there are similar things happening in other settlements. We told him that the Foundation will not compensate for any losses caused by \"defocus\", whether there is evidence or not. It seems that this will soon become a new measure broadcast globally.\n\n**Man B:** So you still can't trust human nature...\n\n**Man A:** Don't think so.

After thinking about it, I reported it. They took the gold chain. I asked them if they could give me a Switch back, but they said I had no proof that it was a Switch before, and even if they could, they wouldn't give me a replacement. Damn it, the whole week of Pokémon protein was incubated.\n\nIt's been almost four months, and it feels like yesterday. I still remember that day. Suddenly, all social media stopped. The Internet and TV were all filled with that big logo, three arrows inserted into a circle. The group of people who called themselves the Foundation suddenly became the Big Brother of the world, and everyone who tried to resist was wiped out. I heard that it was so clean that it was as if they had never appeared in history. There are so many conspiracy theories, saying that they were the ones who caused the \"loss of focus\", saying that they are the Freemasons, or the Communists, or the Great Magicians, and their goal is to destroy the United Nations and all political systems and take control of the order of the earth.\n\nAlthough to be honest, life in the settlement is not that bad, the food is okay, and there is some entertainment occasionally, but you can't go online and there is a curfew at night. But anyway, my Switch is gone, and my gold chain is gone. What a shitty day.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock memo\"]]\n**Type: Research Memo**\nSite-RU-17, 24/10/2021\n\n-----\n\nIt is believed that the subject was originally a notebook, and when it arrived at the lab it was a bathroom duck approximately 6cm in length.

The ukulele is gone! Even the submachine gun is gone!\n\nI have to find Konny. I can't live like this.\n\n[[/div]]\n\n**Appendix III - OBSR-1 Observer Classifier:** On 10/2021, the Foundation's Artificial Intelligence Department successfully developed the OBSR-1 Observer Classifier. After training with a special data set, a single OBSR-1 can complete the semantic classification of a specific static non-biological object in a 480p shooting screen within 42ms, with an accuracy of 90.87%. Using an integrated learning strategy, multiple OBSR-1s trained separately are boosted, and the accuracy can reach 98.438%, which initially meets the observer's needs. The Foundation immediately put it into the work of stabilizing SCP-2000. The work was declared completed the following month, and SCP-2000 entered a dormant state.\n\nSubsequently, OBSR-1 was widely used in various Foundation sites and human settlements. It is believed that the existence of OBSR-1 has allowed some of the data in the sites and settlement ruins to be preserved.\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - Observer Classifier**[[/size]]\nDr. Kacper Darlin, 20/03/2021\n\n-----\n\nThe basic research direction has been determined: the main body of the artificial intelligence observer will be a classifier. It makes sense, after all, this is the responsibility of the observer: his observation understands the category of the observed object, thereby stabilizing the existence of the observed object. In terms of specific hard conditions, according to the information provided by O5-3, the previous observer gave four:\n\n# The observer must be able to understand the observed object.\n# The observer must be able to achieve complete semantic classification.\n# The observer must spend no more than 42ms to classify.\n# The candidate observer must ascend to the throne in no less than 33 minutes.\n\nThe third is a hard time requirement, which is easy to understand. After the current observer effect completely dissipates, the object without the observer can be 100% stable for 42ms, and then there will be a probability that it will transform into something else due to \"loss of focus\". We can optimize it after we get the design done, and at worst the hardware will be hard-coded, so there is no need to worry about it now. The fourth item is not within our authority, that is the responsibility of O5-2, we just need to hand in the machine, and the higher-ups will return the observer who has ascended the \"throne\" to us. Our primary goal now is to figure out the first two items.\n\nRegarding the first point, \"understanding\", we have not yet established specific parameters. This seems to require the classifier to have \"consciousness\", a true \"artificial intelligence\". This is very difficult to do, as our research on human consciousness is difficult. As for the \"complete semantics\" mentioned in the second point, O5-3 unlocked the [[[SCP-1539]]] permissions for our research team. It seems to be related to \"description of things\", but there is too much confusing information, and it is a cognitive hazard. We are still trying to understand it. According to the previous observer, this seems to be a very emotional thing, and he has no way to give a better explanation. This has become instinct for him, and instinct is difficult to explain.\n\nIn short, we still have to continue researching, and transform this kind of emotional understanding that is difficult to describe in words into rational design. I hope there is enough time.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - Recent Research Findings**[[/size]]\nDr. Kacper Darlin, 05/09/2021\n\n-----\n\nThere is one direction that is absolutely not acceptable: a classifier that cannot give any other classification. We tried to make a machine that would classify everything it saw as \"apple\", and only let it see apples. The probability of them \"losing focus\" did not change at all (one of them turned into an Akita dog and became my pet for two weeks). In the end, we found that the classifier model needs to have a certain degree of complexity, it must not be a simple few layers, and it must be able to output more than one label. If we think in this direction, it means that as long as the output of the classifier is obtained after a series of analysis and reasoning, it is considered to be \"understanding\" the observed object.\n\nWe have also deepened our understanding of \"semantics\". We successfully prepared a prototype machine that can output the label \"apple\" in accordance with the requirements. It can indeed stabilize \"apple\", but it does not stabilize a specific apple, but everything that can be related to \"apple\". We can let it observe an apple, but this apple will still be \"out of focus\", but it will become various things related to the concept of \"apple\", most of the time it is another apple, bigger, smaller, green, with wormholes, half-eaten, and sometimes it is something else, such as an oil painting with an apple, apple juice, or apple-red cardboard.\n\nIf the same prototype is used to observe a snow pear, its probability of \"out of focus\" will not change. But if it is \"lucky\" to become an apple, then its subsequent performance will be the same as the original apple. Based on these words, we can draw the following conclusion: wrong and incomplete semantic classification will lead to the occurrence of \"out of focus\" events. Wrong classification is no different from no classification, and incomplete classification will affect the probability of transformation to a certain extent. But in any case, our goal is still the \"complete semantic classification\" mentioned by the previous observer. The example of apple is unacceptable.\n\nMoreover, the result that the \"out-of-focus\" pears look like apples is consistent with the original apples further confirms our understanding that \"out-of-focus\" is not a change in the appearance of the object, but a change in its essence. What has changed has changed, and the past can never be restored.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - OBSR-1 Observer Prototype**[[/size]]\nDr. Kacper Darlin, 01/10/2021\n\n-----\n\nThe results of the OBSR-1 prototype are out, and they are not satisfactory, but now is not the time to be picky. The input of the classifier is now 480p, the network has 847 layers, and there are 102 layers of convolution. It has been a long time for us to solve the problem of error back propagation. As for the \"complete semantics\", our temporary approach is to make the output labels as detailed as possible. To use the example of the apple I mentioned earlier, it has to be \"an apple with a mass of so-and-so, an average RGB value of the surface color of blah blah, and a 3cm Foundation logo drawn with a Paint Pen, and blah blah\". But I believe there is room for optimization. Now we write the labels ourselves, and the longest one seems to be 80KB, which is barely enough for now, but it is definitely not a long-term solution. I have already divided a group to study GAN of semantic labels, and I will see what they do.\n\nOf course, there are still many problems to be solved. To ensure accuracy, the classifier cannot support too many labels, and it is best to have only two: A and non-A. This means that we cannot stabilize active things at the moment. Once they move, the results given by the classifier may be wrong. Once they are wrong, there is a probability of \"losing focus\". OBSR-1 can only stabilize dead objects, and they are completely inactive dead objects. But we have to do it. A few days ago, one of SCP-2000's SRAs \"lost focus\" and turned into a large group of plastic pink flamingos. I heard this is the largest \"loss of focus\" ever recorded. O5 is concerned that the previous observer effect will dissipate faster than expected, and we can't delay any longer.\n\nWe have already started preparing the training set for stabilizing SCP-2000. Almost all of it has to be typed by hand, which reminds me of my first PhD, which happened yesterday. Everyone is working overtime, but no one is complaining. Also, now is the apocalypse, even if we don't work overtime, where can we go?\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**RESEARCH MEMO - OBSR-1 OBSERVER YELLOWSTONE ARRAY**[[/size]]\nDr. Kacper Darlin, 20/11/2021\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"myImageBlock\" style=\"width: 25%; float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 1em\"]]\n[[image yellowstone.png]]\n[[div class=\"myImageCaption\"]]\n**Our last trump card.**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nWe did it. The Yellowstone Array, 3,500 OBSR-1s, watching every corner of SCP-2000. We stabilized Yellowstone, the first step to success.\n\nUnfortunately, we had to put it into hibernation. Only able to stabilize inanimate objects. No one is allowed to set foot in Yellowstone again until the stabilization issue is resolved, O5 orders. In a limited time, we used BZHR to clone 50 batches of Foundation employees in preparation for possible future needs. They are now dormant in the newly built basement of Site-19, and the OBSR-1 array responsible for them is already being prepared. Humans in hibernation are not actually dead objects, but OBSR-1 can still play a role to some extent, and it is better to have it than not. But yesterday, the oxygen storage liquid in a hibernation machine \"lost focus\" and turned into corn paste. The staff spent nearly three hours digging in the pipe...\n\nThere are still many things to do, such as preparing arrays for stabilizing sites and settlements, and investing in the research and development of OBSR-2. GAN is still behind schedule... There is no time to rest.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Appendix IV - Data Collection:** In 2023-2024, as the observer effect continues to dissipate, the probability and harm of \"out of focus\" events continue to increase.

We don't know what it became. Judging from the mixture after the reaction with hydrochloric acid, we speculate that it is something like metal.\n\nDifferent people have different opinions on this. Some people think it has finally died, some people think that \"losing focus\" cannot be called death, and some people think that it planned it by itself and it escaped. \n\nReports of abnormal \"losing focus\" are received every day. Most of the time, it can be regarded as a kind of \"neutralization\". It has never been tried that \"losing focus\" becomes another anomaly. Most of the responsible employees are happy because there is one less thing to worry about. But this time... This time is different. Any idea is good, I know that everyone feels bad. How to say it? When the thing that you thought would never die \"dies\", you will always feel... something is wrong with this world.\n\nAnd this is a very large \"losing focus\"...

Due to the lack of timestamps and database corruption, it is no longer possible to locate the location of Area-303 in the current iteration. \n\nThe OBSR-2 Observer Classifier is believed to have been developed shortly after the closure of the artificial observation and training ground. A single OBSR-2 can semantically classify an object in a 4K frame in 42ms with an accuracy of 97.46%, but the object must be in a fixed behavior pattern. Due to the lack of timestamps, the exact time cannot be confirmed.\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - OBSR-1β Artificial Observation and Training Site**[[/size]]\nDr. Jesse Fang, 28/07/2024\n\n-----\n\nThe artificial observation and training site is located in Area-303. There are currently 1,500 OBSR consoles, and we expect to increase this to 5,000 within three months. The early test results are not good, with stability improvement of only 37.2%, but we can't give any other solutions. The development of OBSR-2 requires a massive data set, and this is only the development stage. When it comes to the formal training stage, the amount it requires will definitely increase by several orders of magnitude. There are only eight human settlements left, and the global population is less than 200,000. We urgently need to find a way to bridge the gap from OBSR-1 to OBSR-2.\n\nThis is the solution given by Dr. Darlin. In the final analysis, what we need is an \"artificial intelligence\", and the most intelligent thing on this planet is us humans. The human body cannot bear the intensity of the observer's thinking, but we can transfer the difficult part to OBSR-1 and use human intelligence to give it the final improvement. It is not as simple as it sounds. Difficulty is only relative. The work assigned to people will still bring an extremely heavy burden to the mind. They will sit in front of the operating table, fix the nutrient delivery fluid, wear the electrode cap that stimulates and enhances brain waves, and then start working, twenty hours a day, and rest with anesthetics for the remaining four hours. They have to work until they \"lose focus\" or we solve everything before that. I sincerely hope it is the latter, but the actual experimental data tells me that this is wishful thinking.\n\nOBSR-1β is a very basic improvement of OBSR-1. We added an additional module at the end of the model. The core part is an RNN, which can accept additional inputs, expand the input into a sequence combined with old records, and use this to continuously adjust the parameters of the entire model. RNN is used because no matter how fast a person's processing speed is, it is impossible to reach 42ms, but we can use algorithms to expand and supplement it, just like predicting the following text based on a word. The console is equipped with a manual labeler and a series of trained GANs. Each person is responsible for 50-100 OBSR-1βs, expanding, processing and labeling their raw data, and then sending them back. In this way, OBSR-1β can modify its parameters to a certain extent based on the actual situation observed, stabilizing the moving objects, rather than giving fixed labels. At the same time, the data generated in this process is also good training material, and we will compile it as a data set for R&D. But I have written that the results are not good at all.\n\nWe have already invested in the first batch of backup employees. People from all departments must participate, regardless of rank. All employees are very cooperative, and the amnestics prepared in advance are unnecessary. They know why we serve and remember the oath we have memorized on our first day of work. I am exempt because I am in the development team, but to be honest, it makes me feel guilty. I have seen them. The moment the training ground started, they trembled, as if someone threw a nearly suffocated fish into a pond, and the console glowed blue. I went back a few days later and -- I've never seen so much bloodshot in the whites of someone's eyes -- I'm sorry, I shouldn't have written that in a research memo.\n\nI'm so tired, sorry, there's so much to do.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - In Memory of**[[/size]]\nDr. Jesse Fang, {{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"myImageBlock\" style=\"width: 25%; float: right; margin: 0 1em 1em 1em\"]]\n[[image copper-sulphate.png]]\n[[div class=\"myImageCaption\"]]\n**A Small Piece of Dr. Kacper Darlin**\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\nKacper is gone. The last of him. He is now a two-meter-tall cluster of copper sulfate crystals. I took it upon myself to place it at the front of the training grounds, on a cylindrical marble block, covered in glass, with an OBSR-1. No one objected. He's given so much. I can't even remember what he was like before he got involved in all this. I sometimes wonder what Kacper is like now. I always think of dragonflies. Kacper used to like dragonflies. But even if he did, it wouldn't be for long.\n\nO5-2 came. I lost my temper. I grabbed her and asked her a lot of things. She didn't blame me. She told me everything, didn't hide anything. There are only six O5 left. There are two more in the human settlement. I'm not the Jesse Fang from the beginning, I'm the sixteenth.\n\nThere are out of focus in the training grounds every day. There were eight the day before yesterday, six yesterday, and twelve today. We still have nine backup staff left.\n\nI don't want to write about this.\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Research Memo - OBSR-2**[[/size]]\nDr. Jesse Fang, {{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\nOBSR-2 is done, -- its model is -- no need to explain, just read the documentation. Accuracy is good, but not enough. Its observer effect can stabilize moving objects, but they can only have fixed behavior patterns. Go wrong if you cross the line. No need to worry about the machine losing focus anymore, it works well in stabilizing the machine. It can also protect us, as long as we treat ourselves as robots and only do things described by the parameters, research can continue. Jacob had a breakthrough last night, yelled \"Eureka\", out of parameters behavior, he lost focus. Security stabilized him with an OBSR-1, the thing that used to be his, and swept him into a shoe box. I don't know where they're taking him.\n\nThere are no human settlements anymore. The training ground is closed. If OBSR-2 could be completed a little earlier, we might have twice as many people as before. But it doesn't really matter, whether it's fast or slow.\n\nOnly the last batch of backup staff is left. There may be survivors out there, people with extremely good luck, but it doesn't matter. The outside world has nothing to do with us.\n\nWe just need to complete OBSR-3. That's all we can do now.\n[[/div]]\n\n**Appendix VI - Data Collection:** The following data was collected from the previous iteration of Foundation sites and human settlement sites, and is believed to record the conditions of various places at the end of the previous iteration.

Very good progress! I've finished reading the latest research document, and I've listed all the changes I need to make. But it may be a little slower than I expected. The latest version of the assembly language is updated, with several new instructions, which are crucial to the optimization of the entire model. I need to spend some time to familiarize myself with them. But don't worry, we have arranged enough time in our plan, and this little thing is nothing.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI never worried about it. You did a good job, Cheng.\n[[/div]]\n\nThank you for the compliment. Haha, if you told me when I was a graduate student that I would use assembly to write ML in the future, I would definitely think you were drunk. At that time, almost everyone was using Python, and at most writing CUDA. Assembly was really unthinkable, not to mention the hardware was hard-coded. At that time, we didn't even think that one day we would squeeze out performance and squeeze everything into 42ms. The change of times is amazing.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt has always been like this, especially at the Foundation. After the curtain was lifted, after the illusion was gone, everything was accelerated. We are all heading straight to heaven, we are all heading straight in the opposite direction.\n[[/div]]\n\nThat sounds familiar... Dickens?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nYes.\n[[/div]]\n\nNostalgic. When this is all over, I'm going to find a nice day, lie on a beach chair, drink coffee and read a book all afternoon.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThat sounds great.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat about you, Aaron? What will you do when this is all over?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI haven't thought about it yet. There probably won't be much free time. I need to reorganize the council, the various branches need to be rebuilt, there will be a lot of paperwork, and there will be a lot of business trips...I haven't had a vacation for a long time, and my position does not allow me to have much personal time.\n[[/div]]\n\nThat's a pity, so why not take this as a vacation?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhat do you mean?\n[[/div]]\n\nYour main job now is just to supervise my progress, right? I can't go anywhere, so you can relax.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhat can I do?\n[[/div]]\n\nRelax your brain, that's already much better. Relax your tense nerves. It's worth a try.\n\nAaron?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nOkay, I'll try.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Communication Record**[[/size]]\n{{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"comm\"]]\nHey Aaron, I'm thinking of something and want to confirm with you.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhat is it?\n[[/div]]\n\nI checked a lot of out-of-focus records while waiting for the model to compile. I kept thinking of one thing: the out-of-focus is too complete. Every time we record the out-of-focus of an entire object, a person becomes a tree, a flower becomes two dice, a TV becomes three parrots. There are a few cases where a person's hand is out of focus, but compared to big data, it's rare.\n\nOur model now handles it this way. Although the labels are long, we have always been doing semantic classification for macroscopic large objects. The effect is very good, so I am not complaining, but... why is it like this? Why don't atoms go out of focus one by one? I want to ask, is it true that there is nothing, or that it was not recorded? Do you know?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt's true, Cheng. I don't know why it's like this.\n[[/div]]\n\nOkay... and we haven't seen anything go out of focus and become something more deadly. For example, black holes, such as antimatter. Logically speaking, these should be probabilistic, and after all these years, it has never happened once.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThis situation will not happen. This is out of range.\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Out of range\"? What does it mean? Who said this?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThe former observer. But I don't actually know what this means. <ai=74> [[/div]] Ah yes! Have you met the former observer?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nYes.\n[[/div]]\n\nIt's enviable. What is he like?\n\nAaron?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nHe sometimes reminds me of Sophia's father.\n[[/div]]\n\nSophia?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nO5-2.\n[[/div]]\n\nOh oh. I think I've seen her before. She was responsible for bringing our classifier to the throne.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nYes.\n[[/div]]\n\nThis is actually something I want to ask. What exactly is a throne? I didn't find any relevant information.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI can't describe the throne to you in words.\n[[/div]]\n\nI don't quite understand...\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI've seen the throne, I've even touched it briefly, with my fingertips. But it is not something that can be described in words. I'm sorry, Cheng. It's not that I deliberately wanted to hide anything from you this time, but it's just such a thing.\n[[/div]]\n\nWell...\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThe Foundation has dealt with many things that are far beyond human understanding. The Observer and the Throne is just one example.\n[[/div]]\n\nI understand.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Communication record**[[/size]]\n{{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"comm\"]]\nOh my gosh, Aaron, I think I got it all.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhat's going on?\n[[/div]]\n\n\"Semantic classification\", I have thought about it for a long time. I even read the ZK-001-Alpha Containment Protocol. Then, I got it. Everything makes sense.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThat doesn't seem to be within your authority, right?\n[[/div]]\n\nOh come on, Aaron, do you still care about permissions at this point?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt depends on the situation.\n\nTell me about your findings.\n[[/div]]\n\nWe have been using the wrong way to understand the world in the past... No, it cannot be said to be wrong, the model is correct, molecules, atoms, quarks, these physical models can work. But this doesn't really get to the essence of things. The essence of things is discourse and narrative. Everything is so obvious, even our predecessors have told us directly. Jehovah's words \"let there be light\" realized the creation of the world. Laozi called the ultimate existence \"Tao\", which is λόγος in ancient Greek philosophy. Everything is a discourse, a narrative, a story, a novel, a song in the wind.\n\nThis is our world, a world formed by words. That’s why the former observer said this was a “semantic” classification, because what he saw was always discourse, and what he understood, and what his observations were stable, was the semantics of discourse. The words in a sentence are reversed, modified, and eliminated, and the semantics change, which is reflected in the change of things. So we don't see the defocusing of quarks in molecules and atoms because words don't describe them! The words that describe us have changed. This is out of focus!\n\nRemember the throne you mentioned before? You said you had no words to describe it. I understand now that this is because it does not belong to our world, it is not made of words, and naturally cannot be described in language we can understand. It all makes sense.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI admire you very much, Cheng. But I guess I have to tell you something.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat happened?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nZK-001-Alpha Containment Protocol may not be true.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat does \"not necessarily\" mean?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nSorry, I can't tell you that.\n[[/div]]\n\nOkay, but no matter whether my understanding is different from the real nature of the world, at least it is now used in practice.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhat does \"real place\" mean?\n[[/div]]\n\nI added human language data to the original training set, and filled the training set with all the corpus I could find. The model needs to understand language, it needs to understand discourse. This is the last piece of the puzzle. The corpus data and the model fit perfectly, as if waiting for this final epiphany. I already have some basic test results. Let's just say they're better than all previous test results combined.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI'm glad to hear that.\n[[/div]]\n\nMe too, Aaron. OBSR-3 is almost here. And I have another idea.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nTell me about it?\n[[/div]]\n\nYou said before that defocusing will not produce things like black holes and antimatter, because they are \"outside the range\". If the essence of things is indeed discourse, if the whole world is a grand narrative, and \"out of focus turns into a black hole and then ends directly\" is not allowed by this narrative, then we will definitely succeed.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhy?\n[[/div]]\n\nBecause no one likes a story that involves hardships, blood, and tears, but then ends abruptly. <ai=77> [[/div]] [[/div]] [[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n\n\n\n\n[[size larger]]**Communication Log**[[/size]]\n{{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"comm\"]]\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nCheng, are you still there?\n[[/div]]\n\nI'm here.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nGood. I hope you're okay. I haven't heard from you for a while, and I'm a little worried.\n[[/div]]\n\nEverything is fine. I'm preparing the final training set, which is purely physical work. The model is compiling. I have a separate module for formal verification, and it works after training with the corpus. Everything is fine.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIs everything okay? You don't sound as cheerful as before.\n[[/div]]\n\nNothing, Aaron, I'm just thinking about the day when all this happened.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nTell me about it.\n[[/div]]\n\nThere's not much to say. I'm a backup employee of BZHR, and I didn't actually experience that day, Dr. Cheng Jiuzhang, so I don't actually remember it. But it was actually the Chinese New Year. I was just thinking... if nothing had happened, our site would have had a long holiday, and those who stayed behind to work overtime would have had a lively party, and they might have sat in front of the TV and complained about the Spring Festival Gala, which was getting more and more unbearable every year. I should have gone back home as well.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI heard that you would have a very lively celebration.\n[[/div]]\n\nMy family actually didn't. We would just have a simple meal with relatives who lived in the same city. But the most troublesome thing was that the relatives asked this and that. My parents never knew what my specific job was... Of course, the whole world knew it the next day.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nK-level scenarios would not be based on the human calendar.\n[[/div]]\n\nI know, so I was just thinking about it.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nDo you miss these things?\n[[/div]]\n\nIt would be a lie to say that I didn't miss them. But they are all very distant things. So distant that they have become blurry like an out-of-focus photo.\n\nOh sorry, I didn't mean to say that...\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt's okay, that fits in.\n\nIf you want, we can pick a date to start over, in Yellowstone. We can do the necessary history to ensure that you, your friends, and your family can enjoy your holidays without worry.\n[[/div]]\n\nWell... that's not for me to decide.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt's not for anyone else to decide now, and it's not my call. We have to pick a day. So, do you want this?\n\nCheng? Are you still there?\n[[/div]]\n\nI am. I was just thinking... okay, that sounds great.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThat's it.\n[[/div]]\n\nThank you, Aaron.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIt's okay. You've given enough. You all have given enough. You deserve this, it's all I can do.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n[[div class=\"myBasicBlock\"]]\n[[size larger]]**Communication Log**[[/size]]\n{{TIMESTAMP MISSING}}\n\n-----\n\n[[div class=\"comm\"]]\nAaron, it worked. OBSR-3 is done.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nGreat! How is it now?\n[[/div]]\n\nI got the final formal verification, which has proven that its observations are complete semantic classifications, truly complete, and this is true understanding. I am now doing the final simulation test, and the data is very beautiful, so beautiful, just like when you take apart the dial of a mechanical watch and see every gear, every spring, every component, tightly interwoven with each other, so smooth, so accurate, so efficient...\n\nThe test results are in, 42ms, and this is the result of the soft run stress test, it's perfect. When it is installed, this speed will be even faster. We did it, Aaron, this is all over.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nYou did a great job, Cheng.\n[[/div]]\n\nYeah... Although I always believed that we would succeed, I was still shocked when I actually saw it... It's hard to believe that we have pushed machine learning to a level that no one could have imagined in the past. The input is also a completely new specification. We abandoned pixel processing and directly analyzed vector image points. And the hardware has been improved, with sub-nanometer accuracy... It's hard to believe that I have the opportunity to touch such an amazing machine. When normalcy is restored, human technology will really increase by several orders of magnitude.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI don't think so. We have to protect the historical process, and these technologies will not be made public all at once.\n[[/div]]\n\nHaha, it doesn't matter. After all, these technologies are still in the hands of the Foundation, which is good enough.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nYes. Okay, Cheng, send me the data, and I will do the rest. It won't take too long, and then you can have a good rest, I promise.\n[[/div]]\n\n<ai=74> Actually, Aaron, I came to say goodbye to you as well.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\n...What happened?\n[[/div]]\n\nNothing, it's just that... my console can't send OBSR-3 to you.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nWhy? Is there a problem?\n[[/div]]\n\nThere's a firmware missing. I have to physically connect my console to another transmitter.\n\nDon't worry, it's not far away, it's actually next door to me, and it's not very complicated, I just need to run a cable.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\n...But this is not in the parameters of your OBSR-2, right?\n[[/div]]\n\nYeah...\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nThis sounds like a mistake that shouldn't have happened. Why is this happening?\n[[/div]]\n\nYeah...things happened too quickly, the defocus spread quickly that day, and I didn't have time to train, and I had to fix it...The data transmission should be fine, and I can connect the cable before the effect disappears, I still have this confidence. But after that, the defocus will not let me go.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\n...I'm sorry, Cheng.\n[[/div]]\n\nNo, Boss. I took classes at the Foundation, and I know exactly what I'm up against.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nIn fact, it's the same situation here.\n[[/div]]\n\nWhat's the same?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nI'll be out of focus, too. I need to bring OBSR-3 to the throne, which is also outside the parameters of my OBSR-2.\n[[/div]]\n\nThis sounds like a mistake that shouldn't have happened, just kidding. Is it too late?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nNo. There's no way to train, this is not something OBSR-2 can understand. Maybe -3 can't either. This is something I have to do myself.\n[[/div]]\n\nIs that so...\n\nthen it seems that neither of us will see the dawn.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nDo you need to wait a little longer? We still have plenty of time.\n[[/div]]\n\nNo, Aaron, the end of this is already in our hands, there's no need to play the inner drama here. No, wait...\n\ngive me a few minutes, I'll find myself a dose of adrenaline. After all, this is the time to test your hand speed.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nDon't worry.\n[[/div]]\n\nOkay. I'm ready. That's it, nice to meet you, Aaron.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nMe too, Cheng, me too.\n[[/div]]\n\nAre you ready too?\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nReady.\n[[/div]]\n\nThen let's do it, you and me. I will send you the data from OBSR-3, and you will take it to the throne.\n\n[[div class=\"aaron\"]]\nAnd the world will continue to be beautiful.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n@@ @@\n@@ @@\n\n[[div style=\"font-size: 87%; color: transparent;\"]]\nSo, they succeeded?\n\n//Yes.
