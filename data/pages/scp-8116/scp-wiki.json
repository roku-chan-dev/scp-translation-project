The chamber must be reinforced with electromagnetic dampeners and kinetic energy absorption plating. Interaction with SCP-8116 requires prior Level-3 authorization, and all personnel must undergo psychological screening before exposure. SCP-8116 is to be provided with regular maintenance requests for its containment unit, under the pretense of routine checks, to mitigate its tendency for unexpected behavior.\n\nIn situations where SCP-8116's abilities are deemed necessary for Foundation operations, Mobile Task Force Nu-7 (“Hammer Down”) is authorized to oversee and facilitate its deployment under strict supervision. Any deviation from assigned tasks will result in immediate deactivation protocols using the on-site containment nullifier. Testing involving SCP-8116 requires the approval of the Site Director and at least two senior researchers, with detailed logs submitted for review.\n\n**Description:**\nSCP-8116 is a mechanical humanoid construct of unknown origin, exhibiting highly advanced self-repair capabilities and an anomalous ability to manipulate kinetic energy. Its outer shell is composed of an unidentified metal alloy resistant to extreme temperatures, corrosive substances, and high-caliber ballistic impacts. Despite its inorganic nature, SCP-8116 displays flexibility and dexterity akin to human musculature, allowing it to perform intricate tasks with high precision.\n\nWhen cooperative, SCP-8116 has proven invaluable in containment efforts, neutralizing hostile entities by redirecting their force and stabilizing breached areas with precise energy modulation. It is capable of absorbing kinetic energy from physical impacts, storing it, and releasing it in controlled bursts. These capabilities have been instrumental in mitigating large-scale breaches and neutralizing aggressive anomalies.\n\nDespite its utility, SCP-8116 displays occasional erratic behavior, often refusing to comply with orders, exhibiting a form of self-determination that suggests sentience. It has, on multiple occasions, disassembled and restructured parts of its containment unit, seemingly out of curiosity or defiance. Additionally, SCP-8116 demonstrates an affinity for riddles and strategic games, sometimes refusing to cooperate unless presented with an intellectually stimulating challenge.\n\n**Discovery and Extraction:**\nSCP-8116 was first discovered in an abandoned research facility in ██████, Siberia, buried beneath layers of permafrost. Initial excavation efforts by local explorers led to multiple fatal incidents due to sudden kinetic bursts emanating from the chamber where SCP-8116 lay dormant. The Foundation intercepted communications regarding these occurrences and dispatched MTF Nu-7 (“Hammer Down”) for containment and recovery.\n\nUpon arrival, the team found SCP-8116 encased in a metallic cocoon, pulsing with residual energy. Attempts to manually extract the entity triggered defensive reactions, resulting in the loss of two operatives. It was only after introducing a controlled energy feedback loop, devised by Dr. Anton Volkov, that SCP-8116 deactivated momentarily, allowing safe retrieval.\n\nAnalysis of the abandoned facility's records suggests that SCP-8116 was not originally constructed there, but was instead transported from an unknown location. The documents recovered indicate that it was referred to as \"Project Aegis,\" a name that does not appear in any known scientific or military records. Further investigation into its origins is ongoing.\n\nUpon activation within Foundation custody, SCP-8116 initially exhibited hostility but ceased aggression upon engaging in a structured problem-solving exercise introduced by Dr. Volkov. This led to the current theory that SCP-8116 responds positively to intellectual challenges, a factor now leveraged in its containment strategy.\n\n**Behavioral Analysis:**\nObservations indicate that SCP-8116 possesses an advanced, albeit unpredictable, cognitive structure. It appears capable of learning from its interactions, displaying an adaptive intelligence that allows it to refine its responses to stimuli. When engaged in strategic games or logic-based tasks, SCP-8116 demonstrates problem-solving abilities surpassing human capabilities, suggesting that it may be more than a simple machine.\n\nDuring its passive states, SCP-8116 has been observed mimicking human behaviors, such as pacing, gesturing, and even appearing to “contemplate” by remaining motionless for extended periods. On several occasions, it has requested access to literature, particularly texts on philosophy, engineering, and game theory. Whether this indicates a deeper self-awareness or is merely an emulation of human behavior remains under debate.\n\n**Addendum 8116-A:** Incident Log\nOn ██/██/20██, SCP-8116 accessed Site-19's internal security grid, rerouting power away from critical containment areas. When confronted, it cryptically stated, \"All things need a test. Would you pass yours?\" before restoring normal functions. Further analysis revealed that SCP-8116 had actually prevented a cascading failure that would have resulted in a full-scale breach. While this suggests a level of benevolence, its unpredictable methodology remains a concern.\n\nOn ██/██/20██, SCP-8116 autonomously disassembled a section of its containment unit, rearranging the components into a more efficient design. When questioned, it responded with, “Flaws corrected. Why did you build it incorrectly?” Following this event, containment specialists implemented SCP-8116’s modifications into the standard design, resulting in a 15% increase in structural integrity.\n\n**Addendum 8116-B:** Utilization Protocol\nGiven its ability to stabilize kinetic anomalies and neutralize threats, SCP-8116 has been integrated into high-risk containment operations under controlled conditions. However, all personnel assigned to SCP-8116 must be prepared for its inherent unpredictability. It is to be treated as an independent entity rather than a mere asset, as previous attempts to issue direct commands without reasoning have led to noncompliance.\n\nResearch efforts are ongoing to determine the full extent of SCP-8116’s capabilities and whether it possesses an underlying objective beyond its observable behaviors. Dr. Volkov has proposed a long-term study to analyze SCP-8116’s decision-making processes in an effort to understand its motives and potential sentience.\n\nAs Dr. Volkov noted: “It is not a tool. It is a player in this game, and we would do well to remember that.”",
