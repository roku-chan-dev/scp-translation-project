Due to SCP-6298-β's membership of a network of interconnected polyamorous relationships in the Seattle area, roughly 18,000 discrete instances of SCP-6298-β now inhabit the city and surrounding regions. Attempts at Black Swan Scenario modelling had proceeded on the prior observation of bilateral secondary infection.

However, the scale and diffusion of the epidemic hampered containment efforts. A mass scale information control campaign in conjunction with local news networks and government proved ineffective at limiting the spread of SCP-6298 awareness. Mass termination of newly-infected SCP-6298-1 instances within the Greater Seattle Area proved infeasible, as the scale of operations would invariably constitute a full collapse of the Veil as it currently exists.</p>\n\n        <p><span style=\"color:red;\">As a result of Foundation inability to prevent or limit SCP-6298 transmission, current R0 observations indicate 19 days until all extant humans represent SCP-6298-1 instances. Following the submission of these findings, the containment class has been upgraded to Apollyon. Faced with the choice between a BK-Class \"Broken Veil\" Scenario, and an IK-Class \"End of Individuality\" Scenario, a full quorum of the O5 Council has voted to abandon SCP-6298 containment measures.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n[[/html]]\n\n\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
