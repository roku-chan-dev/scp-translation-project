Often used as a profile picture by PoI-8902 (\"Jonswords\")]]\n\n**Item #:** SCP-4688\n\n**Object Class:** Artifact \n\n**Containment Class:** Safe\n\n**Special Containment Procedures:** Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76. This container is to be reinforced with a Faraday cage to prevent possible interactions with internet-based devices. SCP-4688 may not be stored in the vicinity of electricity-based SCP objects, nor should it be allowed to come in contact with electrical wiring of any kind.\n\nTesting of SCP-4688's suggestion effect may proceed with permission from Project Head/4688[[footnote]]Currently Dr. Westrin[[/footnote]]. Testing must be carried out in an electronically isolated testing chamber with no electronic devices. As of the cessation of Incident 4688-Omega, Testing of SCP-4688's interactions with electronic devices is forbidden. \n\n**Description:** SCP-4688 are a series of Bell-brand children's bike helmets. Although the design of SCP-4688 instances vary, the word \"[[[SCP-066|ERIC]]][[footnote]]An anomalous person (or persons) capable of producing anomalous objects, such as SCP-066 and [[[SCP-168]]]. True identity unknown.[[/footnote]]\" is always written in a child's handwriting with white marker on each helmet's inside.\n\nAnomalous properties begin when SCP-4688 is worn by a sapient being capable of understanding language. The wearer of SCP-4688 will enter a trance state where several parts of the brain related to critical thought are either shut down or suppressed. Outwardly, subjects will experience slurred speech, impaired motor control, and susceptibility to suggestion. Subjects under the influence of SCP-4688 will not refuse any order given to them, except if it will obviously bring harm to the subject in question.\n\nThis suggestion effect appears to be the primary purpose of SCP-4688, given the fact that \"MIND CONTROL HELMET\" is also written inside of some instances of SCP-4688 alongside the aforementioned \"ERIC\". Notably, subjects will still retain personality while wearing SCP-4688 and, if left alone, will go about their routine without interference.\n\nIt is of note that some instances of SCP-4688 were recovered with rusted copper wiring attached to the frontal area and sides of the helmet. In accordance with the containment procedures developed in the wake of Incident 4688-Omega, this wiring has been removed.\n\n**Addendum:** Abridged Testing Log\n\n||~ **Subject** ||~ **Suggestion** ||~ **Result** ||\n|| D-60193 || D-60193 was asked if he would mind baking Agent Wells some chocolate chip cookies. || D-60193 informed Agent Wells that he had no baking skill, but would be happy to follow a tutorial if given access in order to carry out the suggestion. ||\n|| D-35556 || D-35556 was requested by Dr. Diamond to clean Researcher Crane’s office. ||D-35556 explained her appreciation for Dr. Diamond’s “act of selflessness”, quickly carrying out the request with no difficulties. ||\n|| D-20091 || D-20091 was asked to eat escargot, previously established by D-20091 as his least favorite dish. || D-20091 explained that there was no reason he could not give the dish a second chance, and ate the entirety of the presented platter with no hesitation. ||\n\n**Incident Report:** Incident 4688-Omega\n\n[REPORT PENDING SUMMARIZATION]\n\n> //I'm not taking this one, no way, no how.

Actually offered me some chocolate chip cookies just for visiting (whatever deity made me allergic to chocolate is going to get my foot up its ass). We had a conversation. Apparently, her husband was an hedge fund manager, and left her a good sum of money. Explained why she was able to afford a flat in the middle of Cupertino.</p>\n<p>Eventually, I guided the conversation over to why I came; the helmets, and her son. He was around 40, never left home. He'd gotten a comp-sci degree but never used it for anything much. Never could keep down a job, either for his social awkwardness or his tendency to babble about machines. Only ever came out of the basement for food and the occasional WiFi fix. Other than that, he was, and I quote, \"a sweet boy\".</p>\n<p>I didn't have the heart to tell her he was a Maxwellist.</p>\n<p>For those who haven't seen 'em yet, Maxwellism is like the Church of the Broken God, but instead of thinking that their God is all in the machines, they think it's all across the internet. For the most part, they're the same. Same augmented cultists, same machine worship, same shit all around. However, when your God's on the internet, you're obviously gonna spend a lot of time there searching for 'em. As you can probably tell, that attracts a certain demographic.</p>\n<p>First, I asked her about bike helmets. She said she had some, but her son took them all down to the basement for some LARP-related reason. Then, I asked her to go to the basement, so I could meet him. She said sure, but he doesn't like being disturbed. She led me to the back of the house and opened up a cellar door; she gave it a good three-meter berth. I smelt three things: old food, piss, and— the real kicker— dead bodies. You can smell 'em from a mile away, once you've worked with <a href=\"http://www.scp-wiki.net/scp-447\" target=\"_top\">four-four-seven</a> enough.</p>\n<p>There were these shitty wooden steps leading down to the basement. Every time I took a step down, it made a creaking noise. I swear to God, the smell got worse every time I went down; I had to plug my nose by the fifth step, and not just because of the dead body smell. By the time I got to the door, the <i>stench</i> was so rancid, I was thinking about leaving and coming back with one of the air recyclers the breach specialists use to deal with toxic environments.</p>\n<p>Then I opened the door, and I had to step back, I got hit with a fucking wave of death. I think my brain kinda blocked out the memory of the shebang, but from what I remember, there was a shit ton of food on the floor. Rotting, decaying food, with legitimate rats crawling all over them. There was shit on the floor; I'm not sure where it came from. The walls were smeared with some kind of fleshy crap; if you looked close enough, you could see the <i>Star Wars</i> posters underneath. They had a pretty nice computer, I remember that well enough. It's such a shame that three fucking cadavers were hooked up to it, and one of 'em had a big hole in his stomach from the rats making a nest there.</p>\n<p>I'm no chicken, but I got out of there as fast as I could. I yanked the helmets off of all of 'em, turned tail and ran back up the stairs. Oh yeah, one more quick detail. The wires were burnt out, and they had the same fleshy shit all over. I got some of it on my hand, and I didn't notice 'til I got back to Site-34 and it set off a quarantine alarm.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vanished selTab2\">\n<center>\n<h3>Incident Report: Incident Po1ntyB1rd</h3>\n</center>\n<p><b>Report Summary:</b> On 2017-10-3 a Foundation web tracker spotted an instance of SCP-4688-1 installed in www.██████████.net, a forum site dedicated to the discussion of the cartoon <i>Steven Universe</i>.</p>\n\n<p> The following is the abridged set of forum posts which the SCP-4688-1 instance was initially detected:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p><b>Topic: Re: Diamond Authority Shitpost Thread</b></p>\n<p>17:22 <b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> hrjwjw o18&n jo k</p>\n<p>17:25 <b>Redangersmol:</b> wha</p>\n<p>17:31 <b>Midnight8181:</b> Haha me @ Pink being Rose</p>\n<p>17:32 <b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> Im&cn2sha gona h7h bpels</p>\n<p>17:33 <b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> t0sh3sjs is5hes aai@&nt7to ajol jp</p>\n<p>17:39 <b>TheCh33teeo:</b> k</p>\n<p>17:44 <b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> whaii9@& ii hd</p>\n<p>17:47 <b>Redangersmol:</b> uuuhhhhhh are you okay</p>\n<p>17:51 <b>Meowpow:</b> Guys Pointy mighta been hacked :/</p>\n<p>17:55 <b>TheCh33teeo:</b> i dont think hacks cause that</p>\n<p>18:00 <b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> whhhaots haipinp</p>\n<p>18:04 <b>Redangersmol:</b> pointy what</p>\n<p>18:06<b>Meowpow:</b> Is your keyboard broken?</p>\n<p>18:07<b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> wjweird keeybo@ard itg nort brwpkn</p>\n<p>18:09<b>Melobun_:</b> its not working?</p>\n<p>18:10<b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> Weird maxw kyegboard ssry idk whete I am</p>\n<p>18:13<b>Melobun_:</b> what? u okay?</p>\n<p>18:13<b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> inc pmoputer</p>\n<p>18:14<b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> im inmy computer</p>\n<p>18:16<b>TheCh33teeo:</b> uuuh haha i feel like that too</p>\n<p>18:16<b>Po1ntyB1rd:</b> l iterally</p>\n\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vanished selTab3\">\n<center>\n<h3>SCP-4688 - Revision 2017-09-30</h3>\n</center>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<!-- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Bike_helmet_with_Google_logo_1.jpg -->\n<div class=\"scp-image-block block-right\" style=\"width:300px;\"><img src=\"https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-4688/helmet2.jpg\" style=\"width:300px;\" alt=\"destruction.jpg\" class=\"image\" />\n<div class=\"scp-image-caption\" style=\"width:300px;\">\n<p>SCP-4688</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<p><b>Item #:</b> SCP-4688</p>\n<p><b>Object Class:</b> Artifact/Online</p>\n<p><b>Containment Class:</b> Euclid</p>\n<p><b>Special Containment Procedures:</b> Instances of SCP-4688 are to be stored in a standard anomalous item containment unit in Site-76, reinforced with a Faraday cage.</p>\n<p>When not undergoing testing, SCP-4688-1 are to be stored on separate airgapped servers physically stored out of the range of any wireless connection.

Once you got used to being free in the internet, it was an awakening to be brought back into your rotting, decaying, paralyzed corpse of a body. If I looked too far to the left, I could see the corpse of George. A rat had made a nest in his stomach. Like the rest of us, he was still wearing the helmet.</p>\n<p>After an eternity of being trapped, I heard footsteps. <i>Finally</i>, I thought, excited for the prospect of something, <i>anything</i>, to shift my current scenario. The door flew open, and I saw a man in business semiformal stagger through the door, obviously upset at the sight of our decaying bodies.</p>\n<p>I don't know what I would've thought, but I wish I could've shouted, could've blinked, or even done anything to symbolize the fact that I was still alive in there. My consciousness didn't die on the internet. But I could not. As I threw myself against the bars of my fleshy prison, he walked in, took the helmets, and walked out as fast as he came. The stairsteps went up, up, up... and he disappeared forever, returning the life in the dull, grayed room to the status quo.</p>\n<p>With my mind decaying into something beyond torture, my last thought to myself was, <i>is everybody else alright?</i> Or at least, that's what I suppose it would be.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"vanished selTab2c\">\n<center>\n<h3>Incident Report: Incident <span style=\"color: blue;\" class=\"glitchy\">èÄÿ'ê%êŒ</span> - Lvl5 Clearance</h3>\n</center>\n<p>\nOn 2017-10-31 a Foundation web tracker spotted <span style=\"color: blue;\">anomalous activity related to SCP-4688 on www.<span class=\"glitchy\">èÄÿ'ê%êŒ</span>.com, a forum site dedicated to the discussion of occult activity.
