Personnel surveilling SCP-6432's containment locker are to be changed every 2 weeks. Direct physical contact with SCP-6432 is not permitted except during testing. Individuals who make direct contact with SCP-6432 are to remain isolated under surveillance for 15 days, or until SCP-6432's effect wears off. All but 1 SCP-6432-1 instance have been incinerated.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6432 is the corpse of an avian creature, measuring 110cm from beak to tail, with wingspans of 130cm, 80cm and 50cm. While superficially resembling a bird in most respects, SCP-6432 differs in that it has six wings and no legs. Limited accounts prior to its termination observed it moving when on the ground by hopping on the 10cm talons found at the elbow joint of each wing. These 6 talons and SCP-6432’s beak are significantly sharper than the talons of ordinary birds of\n[[>]]\nprey.\n[[/>]]\nSCP-6432 exerts an anomalous effect on any living creature that comes into direct physical contact with it. Physical contact with the anomaly induces intense visual hallucinations, usually of flora and fauna typical of where the victim grew up, or other locations associated with significant memories. In addition to the hallucinations, the victim experiences disembodied sensory input, most commonly through only one sense. Examples of reported experiences are as follows:\n* Smelling woody or floral scents\n* Hearing indistinct speech or whispering, often perceived as very nearby\n* Feeling weather inconsistent with the victim's physical location\n\nSCP-6432-1 instances are the corpses of SCP-6432's victims, carrying pseudo-portals in all areas of the body fed upon by SCP-6432. These pseudo-portals appear as areas of bright, prismatic light, and when viewed through a specialized lens, act as windows to a hereto unidentified forested area. Five SCP-6432-1 instances were discovered in SCP-6432's initial area of destabilized reality, with pseudo-portals located in the facial and chest regions. It is hypothesized that SCP-6432 attacked the eyes first, as suggested by the most fully realized portals always being located in the region of the corpse's eye sockets, and as observed firsthand during the\n[[>]]\nattempted\n[[/>]]\nrecovery of the anomaly.\n\n**History:** SCP-6432 was discovered as the source of a small splinter reality centered on an abandoned house near Millinocket, Maine. Mobile Task Force Lambda-5 (“White Rabbits”) was assigned to investigate but failed to return the anomaly\n[[=]]\nalive.\n[[/=]]\n _\n _\n------\n _\n _\n[[div class=\"blockquote\"]]\n\n= **RECOVERY LOG TRANSCRIPT**\n----\n**Team Lead:** Commander Steven Conley\n\n**Team Members:** Ryan Powell, Katherine Reid, Alexa Hewitt, Ira Watts\n\n**NOTE:** Video footage from is taken from Agent Powell's body camera, as other footage suffered became heavily corrupted as a result of SCP-6432's unreality field.\n----\n\n[BEGIN LOG]\n\n**Conley:** Comms check.\n\n**Reid:** Check.\n\n**Powell:** Hoo-rah.\n\n**Hewitt:** Check.\n\n**Watts:** Check.\n\n**Conley:** Sounds good.

Plant life grows through the walls and floor.]\n\n**Powell:** We found a staircase. Heading- well, heading sideways. See you at the top-or-bottom.\n\n**Conley:** Roger that.\n\n[Footage corrupted, staircase only partially visible.]\n\n**Watts:** Ugh.

The area behind him, previously the top of the staircase, is now a solid, flat wall. Agent Watts is not visible on camera.]\n\n**Hewitt:** Hey, Conley?\n\n**Watts:** Powell, a door just shut on me. Can you grab it?\n\n**Powell:** What door? There’s no door. Where are you?\n\n**Conley:** Eyes up, everybody, we have spacial fluctuations. Keep moving and keep those anchors ready.\n\n**Watts:** Powell has the anchor.\n\n**Powell:** Yeah, Watts doesn’t have one.\n\n**Reid:** I don’t have one, either.\n\n**Hewitt:** I’ve got you, Reid.\n\n**Conley:** Watts, your priority is to find your way back to Powell, got it?\n\n**Watts:** Got it.\n\n[Agent Powell's camera angles down to a male corpse, face entirely missing.

Not gonna hurt you. I’m here to get you out of here safe, alright?\n\n**Reid:** …Did you just take your helmet off?\n\n**Powell:** Jesus Christ, Watts, put your fucking helmet on!\n\n[Powell has begun running through the hall, quickly checking doors.]\n\n[Each door seems to open to an unseen portal, Agent Powell visible from different angles through each.]\n\n**Watts:** She’s just a kid!
