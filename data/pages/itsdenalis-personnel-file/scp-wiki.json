Behind Their Creation\"]]\n[[<]]\n+ [[[SCP-4997]]] -- Cauldros\nSCP-4997 was my first successful dive into the SCP Wiki, and with geology being as much of a fascination for me as it is, writing about a geological entity was an inevitability for me. Cauldros was actually my third or so SCP conceptualized and wasn’t finished until shortly after the 4000 Contest had ended. Two weeks of research, graphic designing, and critique later, SCP-4997 was published and has thus far managed to remain afloat! I’m still kind of shocked that I managed to grab an SCP slot so close to SCP-5000, but I’m still thrilled I got there just in time!\n\nHuge thanks to **[https://www.reddit.com/user/jeandepain/ u/jeandepain]** for their amazing fan art of SCP-4997 which can be found **[https://www.reddit.com/r/SCP/comments/ci1osw/imminent_breach_at_yellowstone_national_park/ here]**! Don't forget **[https://www.deviantart.com/toonholt ToonHolt]**'s fan art of 4997 **[https://www.deviantart.com/toonholt/art/Monsterverse-Tephradon-821310510 here]** too!\n\n\n+ [[[SCP-4870]]] -- Something’s Wrong With Site-17\nOne day I was down by the Canaveral National Seashore, saw a gopher tortoise, snapped some glamour shots of said gopher tortoise, and went on my way. I was so impressed with how the photo came out I used it as SCP fuel. What exactly this anomalous tortoise was going to do, however, managed to evade me for a good few weeks, bouncing around from pataphysics, to memetics, to pataphysics again, and eventually to what it is today. Odd as it may be, it stands as my second successful SCP and was even featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast’s// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/01/25/recap-2019-week-3/ Recap: 2019, Week 3]** episode!\n\n+ [[[SCP-4961]]] -- All Dogs Go to Heaven\nI don’t remember too clearly how I came up with the idea for All Dogs Go to Heaven, but I do remember that a good friend of mine losing her dog while she was thousands of miles from home helped motivate me to actually write.\n\nThe fun in the park may be over, the real Quin, Ruta, and Rad sure made the time worthwhile.\n\n+ [[[SCP-4685]]] -- Every Man Must Pay His Due\nI’ll be completely honest; I wrote this one while hopped up on *way* too much caffeine as a means of procrastination on an important assignment. Some folks over on the SCP subreddit and a bit of SCP Fuel helped the idea come together, so without them I never would have been able to create this. I’m glad I got it put out exactly on Halloween too, I suppose that adds to the effect if you like it. Since being posted I've bounced some tweaks around on it but think it sits nicely as is, though future overhauls have not been entirely ruled out, admittedly. SCP-4685 was also featured in the //SCP Cafe Podcast’s// **[https://scp.cafe/2019/11/14/recap-2019-week-45/ Recap: 2019, Week 45]** episode, albeit critically, but featured nonetheless!\n\n+ [[[SCP-4845]]] – Great Food, No Atmosphere [[size 65%]]//(Or: Tacos That Are Literally Out Of This World)//[[/size]]\nAn offhand comment by a good friend in the middle of nowhere planted the conceptual seed for this one. Taco Bell also represents a sort of social holy site in the lives of friends and I, so it’s incorporation into an SCP was bound to happen eventually. I originally intended to have it placed on Mars but shifted it to the Moon after some careful reconsideration. It’s a shame too, since I’d planned some Martian Taco Bell item names with some folks on Dr. Cimmerian’s Discord server, --rest in peace to //Olympus Mounds//, the //Doritos™ Martian Dust Shell Taco// and //Martian Dew// shall never see the light of day--.\n\n+ [[[SCP-5700]]] - So Says I\nA combination of misinterpreted //Shins// lyrics and a Yellowstone history magazine I picked up while I was working in the Park over the summer inspired this one. Drawing on local myths and legends, additional song lyrics, an assortment of gift shop items, a reference to the nice lady that always gave me an extra shot of espresso, and mixing in an SCP I had planned to write separately, I painstakingly pieced this article together. I stopped working on it for a while after the summer but picked back up when the SCP-5000 Contest was announced. Coffee, Christmas cookies, and a few nights of binge-writing later, I had completed it. Looks like I landed in 46th place too, not bad!\n\n+ [[[SCP-5888]]] - Pariah King\nOriginally I was in the mood for a lore-building article, so I figured I might as well expand on the SCP-1000 canon and refresh an old SCP idea I had a while back, but decided to rewrite the ending a little while after. It came together in a surprisingly timely fashion too, and I'm very happy with it overall. Hope the new version reads better.\n\n+ [[[SCP-5082]]] -- {{Blackline}}\nWritten for the Exquisite Corpse contest using containment procedures so skillfully drafted by my co-author, [[*user YellowCorp]], this article changed a lot. From an [[[SCP-3310]]] sequel that was so similar I almost got in trouble, to what it is today, I am very happy with how it came out. This also functioned as an adventure in image licensing and finding out just what I could and couldn't get away with on the wiki. In the end, I like how it came out!\n\n\n+ [[[SCP-6014]]] -- All For The Better\nAnother thousand SCP slots come and gone since the last K-ontest, and the whiplash from realizing that I had missed the SCP-6000 Contest's announcement by nearly two weeks turned out to be just what I needed to shatter my writer's block. With a theme as broad as \"nature\" my early ideas for my contest entry bounced around from a decidedly fergalicious iteration of Teddy Roosevelt, to anomalous geographical surveys, to what it eventually ended up as today. I chose the truth of the natural world's ultimate victory over our artificial one as my article, and managed to weave in a story about the Overseers and a hopeful protagonist. (It's a shame I had to go and turn her into a tree.) If I had not been in the process of travelling to the literal polar opposite of the United States during the later stages of the contest, the article would have included some audio files voiced by yours truly.\n\nAll For The Better ended up in 58th place with a rating of +41, but regardless of the outcome I'm happy to have been a part of it --and I knew Rounder had it in the bag from the second I saw his entry--. It was a great contest though, and I am grateful to all who participated in it alongside me.\n\n+ [[[SCP-7106]]] -- Voiceless\nI mulled over how to present this one for a long time, finally landing on this interpretation of the concept. Derived from a good friend's nightmare of all things, I found SCP-7106 to be a great vehicle to express my fascination with the [[[scp-3790|Department of Abnormalities]]], one of my favorite GOIs on the Wiki. Paired with a burst of caffeine-laden inspiration, I created the dark hallway of the facility as seen in my own mind's eye using Unreal Engine just the day before publishing it. I am highly satisfied with how everything turned out!\n\n+ [[[SCP-7952]]] -- Miserere Eorum\nSome moments in life can so utterly change you as a person that nothing is ever quite the same afterwards. Yet as altering as these events can be, they are not always a bad thing. They crack us, break us, shatter us, so that we may be reborn better than we ever could have imagined before. I suppose this article is a love letter to one of these moments, and both the pain and the joy that it wrought. Nothing could ever do it justice, but I guess this is as good a place to start as any. Onward, to the edge of the world, eh?\n\n\n+ [[[SCP-8018]]] -- While You Were Dreaming I Was Turning The Sky\nMy grandfather passed away a week after my mother was diagnosed with cancer. Words can't describe how difficult of a time it was. She slept through a lot of her treatment, and she dreamt the same dream nearly every night. It was of my grandfather and God in a high and mighty castle beyond the world itself; protecting her, healing her, watching over her. In the end, she won her battle, though it took a literal miracle. I can't help but think my grandfather may have had a hand in making that miracle happen.\n\nI've thought about those dreams much since that time and pondered about that high and mighty castle. Perhaps it looked something like this.\n\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n----\n\n[[=]]\n++ Graphic Design Stuff\n[[collapsible show=\"And Those ACS Icons You're Probably Looking For\" hide=\"I Gotchu\"]]\n[[<]]\n\n@@ @@\n[[=]]\n+ ##darkgreen|Esoteric Object Class Icons##\n[[/=]]\n\n\n++ **Ragnarok**\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:anomaly-class-bar-source\n|item-number= XXXX\n|clearance= 6\n|container-class= esoteric\n|secondary-class= ragnarok\n|secondary-icon= https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/itsdenalis-personnel-file/ragnarok-icon-ring.svg\n|disruption-class= amida\n|risk-class= critical\n]]\n@@ @@\n[[include component:image-block\n    name=https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/itsdenalis-personnel-file/ragnarok-icon.svg|\n    caption=The Ragnarok-Class Object Class Icon|\n    width=100px\n]]\n\nRagnarok-Class anomalies (or anomal//y//, since I only made this as a one-off thing for a specific article that I eventually abandoned) appear to exhibit similar characteristics as Apollyon-Class SCPs, but in reality are merely influencing their document's writer.

Due to their role in maintaining normalcy, Halcyon SCPs are except from Foundation containment initiatives. These anomalies are differentiated from superficially-similar esoteric classes such as Archon, Chhokmah, and Ticonderoga in that Halcyon anomalies are seen as virtually native to reality. Essentially one step over from non-anomalous.\n\nHalcyon was originally designed for [[[SCP-8018]]], but potentially applicable elsewhere.\n\n----\n[[=]]\n\n+++ [[[scp-4242|SCP-4242: Foundations]]]\n\n[[=image https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/itsdenalis-personnel-file/SCP-4242.png width=\"500px\"]]\n[[=]]\n[[div style=\"display: inline-block; width:75%;\"]]\nSCP-4242 was one of my favorite contest entries in the 4K Contest and also the first thing that popped into my head when my professor assigned us a pop culture poster project.
