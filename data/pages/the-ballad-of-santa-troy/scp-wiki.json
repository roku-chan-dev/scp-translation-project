  "content": "[[>]]\n[[module Rate]]\n[[/>]]\n\nTwas the night before Christmas, and all through the site\nEveryone was busy, typing up skips (well, except Bright).\nPixel and Moose fought to keep peace in the chat,\nFor the Christmas trolls had awoken; poor ones at that.\n\nKalinin was writhing, though snuggled in bed,\nFor fears of awful skips were dancing through his head.\nDrewbear sharpened his paws, and Zyn fluttered her wings,\nPreparing for the newbies (among other such things).\n\nWhen out from the wiki, there arose such a clatter\nAnd Kaktus yelled \"By my spines, what on Earth is the matter?\"\nTo the forums they flew, Reject and Gaffney in a flash.\nTo see to their horror, SCP-231 musings like a rash.\n\nThe questions of [DATA EXPUNGED] briefly fluttered on the page;\nFor an eternity these would come, but must never be allowed to age.\nWhen suddenly there came, to the mods beleaguered eyes',\nA man in an ornate sled that made them cry (with joy, of course).\n\nTwas an English professor, clad in red that would soon get him laid,\nI don't know what his shoes looked like, so I'll assume they were suede.\nHis writing was indistinguishable; it was dope as hell.\nThey knew immediately his identity: it could only be TroyL.\n\n\"Santa Troy!\" the staff all called with glee.\n\"What have you brought us? Unfinished Business Three?\"\nSanta Troy stood there proudly, majestically sporting his beards.\nFrom his sack came fresh articles that quickly dissuaded our fears.\n\n\"On Clef! On Sorts! On Soulless! On Kate!\" \n\"I got you these articles, now read them and rate!\"\n\"On Eric! On Weizhong! On Anqxyr and Crayne!\"\n\"Prepare your eyeballs, 'cos I'm makin' it rain!\"\n\"On Esko! On Vivax! And the rest of them too!\"\n\"I gave you the articles, now you know what to do!\"\n\nWe all were in awe of Santa Troy's swag.\nHe got back in his sled and shut up his bag.\nTroyL grabbed his pen and refilled it with ink.\nAnd then he was gone, before we could blink.\n\nEveryone sighed sadly, for Santa was gone.\nBut then we heard a voice, from the great beyond.\n\"All right you lazy fucks! It's time to write!\"\n\"Merry Skipmas to all, and to all a good night!\"\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
