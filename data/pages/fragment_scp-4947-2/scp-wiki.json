Subject was chosen on account of loyalty and wildland navigation skills. Subject had a history of violence against the elderly and 2nd degree murder. D-947 was equipped with standard wilderness exploration gear, climbing equipment, three days worth of rations, a disposable camera, an audiovisual communications headset, and a GPS tracking device. Dr. Rivka Yarkoni, the former head researcher of SCP-4947, oversaw the exploration.//\n\n//Footage from Exploration III has survived [DATA LOST] days thus far. The significance of this is unknown.//\n------\n[[div class=\"body-text\"]]\n//D-947 is dropped off 100 meters east of SCP-4947-A24, a Leaf Point[[footnote]]As of [DATA LOST], SCP-4947-A24 is no longer a Leaf Point.[[/footnote]].// \n\n**D-947:** [EXTRANEOUS COMPLAINTS EXPUNGED]. This place looks freaky, doc.\n\n//D-947 stands in a meadow, filled primarily with patches of meadow-grass and various flowers. Several patches of grass are missing, replaced with shallow holes in the ground.//\n\n**Dr. Yarkoni:** Noted. D-947, please examine some of the plants in detail.\n\n//D-947 bends down to pick up what appears to be a white tulip in the process of wilting. Its petals bear several holes of varying length. An examination of the other flowers reveals that most flora in the area are in a similar state.//\n\n**D-947:** Do these things even grow here? Never seen a wild tulip out in these parts. Christ, you'd think I'd get one day in a quiet forest. [DATA LOST] but really, can you blame me?\n\n**Dr. Yarkoni:** I don't know if I can. Please proceed.\n\n//A treeline is visible a few hundred meters from D-947's location, which he proceeds towards. Within three minutes, the edge of SCP-4947-A-24 comes into view, beginning as a series of shallow fractures in the ground. Plants adjacent to these fractures are visibly dead/dying. Ambient sounds associated with animal activity are notably absent.//\n\n//D-947 shows notable aversion to stepping on SCP-4947-A's fractures, despite receiving little warning of SCP-4947's anomalous properties. Much of the video footage in this stage is directed towards the ground, suggesting that this action is deliberate on D-947's part. D-947 eventually stops to examine a log approximately 20 meters from the treeline.//\n\n//[DATA LOST]//\n\n//D-947 hurries away towards the treeline.//\n\n**D-947:** Damn worms. They'll eat you alive, fall asleep for too long in the wrong place.\n\n//Fractures in the ground become significantly more common once D-947 enters the forest. From here, each fracture visibly radiates from a much larger fracture, approximately .4 meters deep and 1 meter wide. Vegetation within the main fracture appears heavily decayed. No trees grow along the edges of or within the main fracture.//\n\n**D-947:** Doc, if I didn't know better, I'd say this is some kind of fungus. It's a goddamn cemetery for plants out here. \n\n**Dr. Yarkoni:** Noted. Please proceed.\n\n**D-947:** Assuming that means \"further west\".\n\n//As D-947 continues west, missing patches of vegetation increase in frequency. Aside from the previous [DATA LOST], no signs of animal life are present.//\n\n//**NOTE:** At around this time, the video feed cuts out. The audio feed remains.//\n\n//D-947 remains walking, occasionally whistling a fragment of 'The Lord is Good to Me'. Around two minutes and thirty seconds after video feed cuts off, the sound of walking abruptly stops, and D-947 appears to stumble before audibly swearing.//\n\n**Dr. Yarkoni:** Don't worry about that. The holes won't kill you.\n\n**D-947:** No offense, doc, but you say that like they're going to kill me.\n\n//Video feed cuts back in around this point. Video quality is heavily degraded, and a small blind spot develops in the top-left corner of the feed.//\n\n**D-947:** Either way, what's wrong with this place? Holes don't just spring out of nowhere like this.\n\n//As D-947 continues into SCP-4947-A, an instance of SCP-4947-B that had previously been hidden behind the video feed's blind spot comes into view. Said instance, [DATA LOST], had yet to be recorded as of the exploration. D-947 fails to acknowledge [DATA LOST], continuing west.//\n\n**Dr. Yarkoni:** D-947, please stop to examine the structure to your left.\n\n//As D-947 stops and turns to face the structure, the right audio feed spontaneously cuts out.//\n\n//D-947 stands in front of [DATA LOST], resembling a small toolshed. The entrance consists of a double door, the right half of which has been ripped from its hinges, presumably neutralizing its effects[[footnote]][DATA LOST][[/footnote]]. [DATA LOST] appears empty from this perspective.//\n\n**D-947:** Some kind of gamekeeper shack? Doc, I'd say this place's just about fucked. Gamekeeper's lucky if he keeps his job.\n\n//D-947 soon enters [DATA LOST] unprompted[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 14%. **Justification:** Prior to exploration III of SCP-4947-A, D-947 had shown exceptional compliance with exploration protocols.[[/footnote]], specifically through the hole where [DATA LOST] been. After a delay of three seconds, D-947 shines a flashlight across the interior. Much of the typical toolshed equipment is missing; what remains has been haphazardly piled into the southeast corner of the building.//\n\n//[DATA LOST] inconsistent with [DATA LOST]. Given [DATA LOST] infestation in SCP-4947-B7[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 34%. **Justification:** SCP-4947-B7 has not been mapped.[[/footnote]], this is most likely the result of [DATA LOST] early discovery.//\n\n**D-947:** You've put me up against quite a bit, doc, but this is just curious.\n\n//D-947 stands silently for a period of six seconds, before exiting [DATA LOST] unprompted.//\n\n//After 13 minutes of continued walking[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 100%. **Justification:** [DATA LOST][[/footnote]], D-947 comes to a crevice in the forest, approximately 6 meters deep. Much of the surface area is covered with spotty patches of moss, growing sparser as it descends the wall. Aside from this, all plant life within a few meters of SCP-4947-A appears to have died.//\n\n//At around this time, the right audio feed cuts back in. D-947 stares silently into the crevice for several seconds, occasionally shaking their head.//\n\n**D-947:** Doc, you can't expect me to...\n\n//D-947 continues shaking his head, occasionally muttering something before cutting himself off. This continues for forty seconds before D-947 abruptly falls into the crevice.[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 71%. **Justification:** D-947 observed enough safety protocols to significantly reduce the chances of a fall.[[/footnote]]//\n\n//Audio completely cuts out during the fall.//\n\n//D-947 lands face up in the crevice. Heart-rate [DATA LOST] suggesting significant spinal trauma. Camera feed remains fixed in this position until 27:19:12, when video transmission cuts out. Medical readings cut out at approximately 58:22:01, but do not suggest death during this time.//\n\n//From the camera's position, D-947 is stuck inside of a narrow crevice approximately 3 meters wide. D-947 has a clear view of the sky, as most of the trees in this area have already shed their leaves.//\n\n//During this time, video feed captures several abnormalities://\n* //At 3:14:28, a hole in the video feed appears on the edge of the crevice, and extends laterally until it reaches the other end. This hole remains for 2 hours and 18 minutes, until it suddenly begins laterally shrinking.//\n* //[DATA LOST]//\n* //As expected, night falls at approximately 9:13:00. ƟU-736 automatically flags several incomplete areas in the expected starscape.//\n* //The date of exploration suggests a full moon. However, the appearance of the moon from the crevice[[footnote]]ƟU-1875 estimates that this statement represents a database consistency error to a certainty of 22%. **Justification:** Given the current coordinates, the lunar position on [DATA LOST], and the angle of recording, the moon should not have been visible.[[/footnote]] is that of a waning crescent.//\n* //Audio briefly cuts back in at 16:41:22. In addition to the expected wilderness sounds, a low frequency hum can be heard in the left audio feed. Audio cuts back out at 16:43:59.//\n* //At 21:00:00, nothing happens[[footnote]][DATA LOST][[/footnote]].//\n[[/div]]\n[[=]]\n[[size 150%]][[[https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-4947/offset/2|DOCUMENTATION UPDATED; PLEASE REVIEW AT THE NEAREST OPPORTUNITY, RESEARCHER YARKONI]]][[/size]]\n[[/=]]",
