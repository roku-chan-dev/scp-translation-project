Poor fashion choice for outfits worn during Selachian combat is defined as any combination of clothes not described within SPC-001. The contents of the document are directly decided upon by Oracle, with possible collaboration from the Centre’s High Pugilord when warranted.\n\nThe document directly outlines that any clothes with Selachian iconography are not to be worn, including but not limited to: costumes, hats, shirts, masks, underwear, socks, rings, bracelets, watches, wigs, casts, gun holsters, boxing gloves, regular gloves, gardening gloves, surgical gloves, winter gloves, and skirts. The penalty is not directly dependent on the article of clothing worn, as punishment for the violation of any article of SPC-001, under any circumstances, is death.\n\nAlongside the prohibitions laid out within SPC-001, directives for the articles of clothing which should be worn have also been provided. However, by unanimous Oracle consensus, a majority of standard clothing items have been banned due to the high likelihood the clothing in question was created by Selachians. Despite concerns towards this policy, the lack of clothing has been shown to allow personnel to showcase their muscles at an accelerated rate. Alongside the increased breathibility, this serves to be threatening towards Selachian Entities and Groups of Finterest.\n\n**Addendum 001.1:** Examples #1\n\nFor the purposes of this file, various examples of SPC-001 violations by both Centre personnel and civillians have been compiled into an image gallery. Personnel are advised to wash eyeballs both before and after viewing this gallery should they do so.\n\n[[collapsible show=\"[ACCESS GALLERY]\" hide=\"[HIDE GALLERY]\"]]\n\n----\n\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:image-block name=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0a/Leopard_Girl_Dislikes_Santa_Shark_%284274956253%29.jpg/1200px-Leopard_Girl_Dislikes_Santa_Shark_%284274956253%29.jpg?20190423135456|align=center|width=100%|caption=Why is this fucker doing this in public?
