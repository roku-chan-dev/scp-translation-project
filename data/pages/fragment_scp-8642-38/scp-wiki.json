  "content": "As an Epic Gamer yourself, you feel perfectly confident asking Greg about the games on his computer. He seems taken aback by your sudden interest in his games, but acts much friendlier talking about this than about work. The two of you discuss casual and competitive gaming in all sorts of genres. You learn that Greg has a particular affinity for story-driven games, such as point-and-clicks with multiple endings, but is skilled in all sorts of games. He offers to 1v1 you in a game of your choice, and an Epic Gamer like you doesn’t back down from a challenge like that…\n\nSome hours later, the entirety of the The Department of Everyday Anomalies and Disinformation of Explained, Neutralized, and Decommissioned SCPs is watching two Epic Gamers duke it out. Some are cheering for you, others for Greg, and some are just cheering in general. You think a few might be placing bets, but you’re too focused on the game to be sure. The atmosphere is electrified with both the energy of the crowd and the competition between you and Greg. You feel adrenaline rushing through you; you’ve never played a game so well in your life and never faced an opponent so tough. All your skills are shining through as you go toe-to-toe with Greg in a game closer than you’ve ever…\n\nYour Foundation-issue phone buzzes forcibly in your pocket. You want to ignore it, but you remember that, unfortunately, you are an adult with responsibilities. You pick up the phone and, to no one’s surprise, your boss begins yelling at you to either return immediately with the auditing information or not return at all. You sigh, telling him you’re just finishing up and will be right there. You’ve barely hung up when Greg hands you your clipboard with everything filled out. You aren’t sure when he had time to finish it, but you thank him profusely and apologize that you couldn’t finish the game.\n\n“No worries,” Greg responds, “I know how work is. But hey, we have a gaming night every Saturday at five, and you’re more than welcome to come back for a rematch!”\n\nYou tell Greg that you’ll be there, and, having made new friends, walk out of the D.E.A.D.E.N.D. and back to your job as an auditor.\n\nCongratulations! You found the Epic Gamer ending! You are an Epic Gamer, and you can look forward to hours of gaming with your new friends! In true Epic Gamer fashion, you will now…\n\n||= Page 38 - Epic Gamer Ending||\n||= [https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-8642/offset/0 Try again to get all 7 endings!]||\n||= or||",
