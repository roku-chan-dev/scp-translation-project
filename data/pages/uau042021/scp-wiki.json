What's the blurb for?\n\nAs part of the associated UaU initiative, each month we'll be picking an element of SCP lore that people outside the general gestalt might not know about. We're also hosting writing challenges involving said lore!\n\n+++ may i suggest [blank] for the topic?\n\nSure! Do note, however, that anything with a dedicated hub[[footnote]] Meaning a hub dedicated exclusively or primarily to the topic. GoI Formats would //not// count unless the primary content for the GoI is its formats.[[/footnote]] above +100 in rating can't be made topic. Sorry! D:\n\nSuggestions should be PM'd to [[*user UraniumEmpire]]!\n\n+++ oh cool how do i participate?\n\nJust PM [[*user UraniumEmpire]] a link to your piece and she'll post it on next month's \"Last Month's Pieces and Topic\" section!\n\nFor artists: try to link to whatever social media page is hosting the art. It saves us space and ensures we have a solid reference.\n[[/<]]\n[[/collapsible]]\n[[/=]]\n\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nLast Month's Pieces and Topic\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[endless-light|Some Are Born To Endless Light]]] and the Tales of Anomalous Items\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThe best of the past.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"content-panel centered\"]]\n[[div class=\"panel-heading\"]]\nTopic + pick of this month!\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-body\"]]\n++ [[[The Eternal MxTape]]]\n[[/div]]\n[[div class=\"panel-footer\"]]\nThis month's piece.\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n[[/div]]\n\n> **The Eternal MxTape** is a series about Gamers Against Weed, its political activism, how the SCP Foundation attempts to peel it open, and how all this affects the lives of Wren Masterson and Penelope Gore.\n\n> **The Eternal MxTape** is a breakout series that hit the ground running, its punchy premise driven forward by excellent character writing and tight dialogue.\n\n> **The Eternal MxTape** is deliberately not presented with an introductory piece; as a \"mixtape\", there's multiple ways to read through the series.\n\n> **The Eternal MxTape** is highly underrated. Give it a read!\n\n+++ This month's challenge:\n* **For writers:** Write a GAW article featuring Wren and/or Penelope.\n* **For artists:** Draw a scene from the series.",
