Could she be the Queen?\nThat wasn’t what she’d heard.\nThe Raven spoke, “I sense you’ve come\nFor knowledge from the Tree”\nJay nodded. “Then it seems that I’m\nThe one you’ve come to see.”\n\nThe Jay was clearly startled\nBut she bowed before the Queen\nAnd soon began her story\nOf the things that she had seen\nAnd finally the reason\nShe’d approached the Queen that day\nThe Queen thought for a while\nAnd then nodded at the Jay\n\n“The Rook lives in a castle\nJust a cliff or two away\nYour journey here took long\nBut this one only takes a day”\nThe Jay was grateful for her help\nBut still she was confused\nShe asked why she received it\nAnd the Blackbird looked bemused\n\n“Your father left you young,\nYour mother raised you all alone\nYour life has not been easy;\nIt reminds me of my own.”\nThe Queen gave one last warning\nTo the Jay before she flew\n“The bird that you will find there\nWill not be the one you knew.”\n\nJay rested up and flew out\nAs the sun began to rise\nShe finally saw the castle\nWhen she stopped to close her eyes.\nThe castle was mechanical,\nYet somehow overgrown\nIt seemed so unfamiliar\nFrom the Earth the Jay had known\n\nShe snuck past their defenses\nBut did not know where to look\nShe wandered and by happenstance\nShe ran into the Rook\nShe suddenly was speechless\nAnd did not know what to think\nEmotions filled the poor young Jay;\nThe Rook could only blink.\n\nShe wanted to be happy,\nBut instead was hurt and mad\nThe bird that she had found\nHe could not truly be her dad\nAnd yet it clearly was him\nStanding still before the Jay\nShe finally cried “How could you?”\nBut he had nothing to say.\n\nShe yelled at him and pleaded, too\nBut to her great surprise\nThere was no spark of anything\nBehind his dead black eyes\n‘Twas then the Jay remembered\nThe wise words of the Queen\nHer Father was no Rook,\nHe was a cog in a machine.\n\nEmboldened by this knowledge\nAnd embittered by it too\nShe realized she had found the Rook\nBut not the one she knew\nEmotionless, the Rook looked down\nUpon the tearful Jay\nShe looked up and bid him farewell\nWith that, she flew away.\n\nBut as the Rook watched after her\nHe sensed something inside\nAnd though he knew it could not be\nIt almost felt like pride\nThe world had held Jay down\nBut now she soared into the air\nAlthough she’d reached the hidden grove\nQueen Blackbird was not there\n\nSo Jay guarded the trees\nAnd all the knowledge in between\nYears after she arrived there\nShe proclaimed herself the Queen\nAnd finally as for the title\nTall Queen Blackbird took\nShe’d never be a Raven\nFor her father was a Rook\n@@ @@\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box]]\n[!-- N/A (No Images)  --]\n[[include :scp-wiki:component:license-box-end]]",
