Jr. Researcher R███ is to be kept on a diet including 700 grams of glucose in acceptable forms [[footnote]] Sugar, honey, candy [[/footnote]] as well as 3000 miligrams of water daily. Two guards are to be stationed outside containment armed with steel tactical swords and boxing gloves. Agents stationed on all islands of Hawaii are to continue investigations into reports of abnormally large protea flowers.\n\n**Description:** SCP-6K-J is a large red protea flower growing from the head of Jr. Researcher R███. SCP-6k-J was first discovered three weeks following Jr. Researcher R███’s return from a vacation in Hawaii, when a sprout began growing from his head. SCP-6k-J sprouted in full approximately 4 days later. The anomaly causes Jr. Researcher R███ no pain, but has a noticeable impact on both appetite and behavior. \n\nDespite being genetically identifiable as a Hawaiian protea, SCP-6k-J has a minor cognitohazardous effect on certain individuals. This effect causes these individuals to visually perceive SCP-6k-J as a physical manifestation of the color pink, or sometimes white. Viewers who perceive this anomaly often report headaches or nosebleeds after the experience, as well as a mild craving for citrus.\n\nSCP-6k-J is partially carnivorous and shows a preference toward human meat, but violent outbursts can be prevented if the anomaly is fed “unlimited candy,” as reported by Jr. Researcher R███. Should SCP-6k-J not be fed sufficient candy, Jr. Researcher R███ will attack and attempt to consume any human or living creature it can. This behavior has been described by witnesses as “mean” or \"scary.\" Tests have found that leaves and petals from SCP-6k-J are entirely bulletproof, and cannot be destroyed by any means, excluding sharp blades. Blunt force applied to the main bulb of the flower, primarily by punching or kicking, halts any aggressive behavior and renders SCP-6k-J dormant.\n\n\n**SCP-6k-J Initial Briefing** \nSCP-6k-J was initially studied and contained by MTF Tau-4's (\"A Real Life Preschool Class\"). The following transcript is taken verbatim from a snack-time briefing led by Agents S███, K██, A███, I███, C███, L███, Me███ and Ma████.\n\n> \n> **[Begin Log]**\n> \n> **Prof. Raddagher:** First.
