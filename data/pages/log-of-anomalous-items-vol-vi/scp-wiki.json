Bowl and lid are painted black with yellow question marks. When the lid is removed, the bowl will contain objects of the time the person who touched it was thinking of most recently.  Unique items, such as SCP-level objects, art pieces, or anomalous items, cannot be replicated.  Only items capable of completely fitting in the bowl can be replicated.  The items can be removed and used as expected, and appear to remain in existence indefinitely.  When the lid is replaced, any items still in the bowl demanifest.\n**Date of Recovery:** 1/28/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Richmond, Virginia.\n**Current Status:** Being tested.\n\n**Item Description:** Small wind-up music box containing a figurine of a ballerina.  When wound by a human subject, the box plays a song with a meaningful connection to the subject's childhood, typically one invoking positive memories.  Subjects often prefer to hear the music to completion, but this is believed to be due to nostalgia rather than anything anomalous.\n**Date of Recovery:** 1/14/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** An estate sale in Boston, Massachusetts.\n**Current Status:** Available at Site 26, for use by all personnel.\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1371 - 1380\n\n**Item Description:** Wooden box of a size typically used for jewelry boxes.  The lid is decorated with a painting of cherry trees in traditional Japanese style. The underside of the box has the words \"property of Wilma F. Greyson\" written on it in black marker.  All subjects display reluctance to open the box, saying that it's \"not theirs\" and that \"Mrs. Greyson wouldn't want me to.\"  This occurs even if the subject has not read the words written on the underside of the box.  If pressed to open the box, subjects refuse to remove anything from it, insisting that doing so would be stealing.  Box contains inexpensive jewelry.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2/1/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** A storage unit in Key West, Florida.\n**Current Status:** In storage.  Investigation into the Wilma F. Greyson in question is ongoing.\n**Note:** //The owner of the storage unit had bought the entire unit and its contents, sight unseen, at an auction.  He claimed not to know anyone by that name, but maintained that he was \"keeping the box until Mrs. Greyson comes back for it.\"  When it was pointed out that he knew no such person, he was unable to explain the oddity.// - Researcher Somerset\n\n**Item Description:** Black cotton/polyester blend T-shirt printed with the Batman logo.

The goose is shown near the left edge of the frame.  Any human subject viewing the painting for longer than 3 1/2 minutes becomes convinced that the goose is trying to escape or has already done so.  In the latter case, the effect extends to a belief that the goose is pursuing them, for reasons which cannot be articulated.  This typically ends after 24 hours, but can occasionally last longer.  █ subjects required psychological counseling to end the effect.\n**Date of Recovery:** February 6th, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** An art gallery in New York City.\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n\n**Item Description:** A \"cheap\" --36 33-- 32-pack collection of common sports equipment, such as balls, bats, rackets, paddles, gloves, helmets, and other items of unknown brand.

When observing, it will stay immobilised.\n**Date of Recovery:** February 29th, 2024\n**Location of recovery:** Inside an empty dumpster outside an abandoned house in Columbus, Ohio.\n**Current Status:** Inside a high-security storage locker at Site-81.\n\n**Item Description:** Item is a ████████-brand pack of cigarettes that contains no cigarettes. Any cigarette placed inside the pack will no longer be visible when the pack is opened again. D-Class personnel involved in testing have observed feeling the pack slowly return to its empty weight while being held, but it will rapidly returning to the weight to which it was filled if observed again before the pack completely returns to its empty weight. This phenomena does not apply to non-cigarette objects, such as coins, paper, lighters, stone, meat, or vegetable matter, which retain their weight and will always remain in the pack. It does, however, apply to other tobacco and nicotine products, such as cigars, chewing tobacco, and paraphernalia such as pipes and electronic cigarettes, so long as they are small enough to fit inside the pack.\n**Date of Recovery:** March 19th, 2024\n**Location of recovery:** Found discarded in the parking lot outside of Foundation Site-19's Outpost-Gamma.\n**Current Status:** Contained in low-priority object storage.\n\n**Item Description:** A Kennedy half dollar, minted 1994.

When batter is poured into the pan and baked, paper liners suitable for muffins or cupcakes will be found when the pan is removed from the oven.  If liners are inserted beforehand, no others will manifest.  How this occurs is unknown.  All forms of watching the pan, including remote methods, have proven inconclusive.  This typically operates through coincidence, such as the person watching the camera is distracted by something at the moment the anomalous effect occurs.  Testing to find out if a probabilistic anomaly causes this is awaiting approval.\n**Date of Recovery:** April 14th, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** An estate sale in Springfield, MO\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n\n**Item Description:** A screw composed of an unknown metal alloy, floating approximately five meters above ground level.

This occurs approximately once every fifty-five days (± 14.66 hours) and persists for precisely fifty-one minutes, at which point the text reverts. Images remain unaffected. Text is limited by the number of characters on a page (including punctuation and excluding spaces); for example, there are sixty-nine characters on the title page of //The Noble Cat//, which are replaced with sixty-nine characters from the half-title and title pages of //The Ultimate Dog Book//. Characters exceeding the given limit for a page overflow to the next, often in the middle of a word. Text of //The Ultimate Dog Book// repeats following conclusion of the picture credits.\n**Date of Recovery:** 5/20/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Junior Researcher Lauren's home, where it and a non-anomalous copy of //The Ultimate Dog Book// had been serving as decoration. Junior Researcher Lauren discovered the anomaly after deciding to read both books and subsequently leaving them open on the floor; the altered text was observed several days later.\n**Current Status:** In the Sector-25 break room.\n**Notes:** //That was my mom's. Can I at least keep it at my desk? - Jr. Researcher Lauren//\n\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1411 - 1420\n\n**Item Description:** Fountain pen, no manufacturer's information visible.

Damage to the lid suggests that an attempt had been made to reseal the item prior to recovery.\n**Date of Recovery:** 06-03-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Cedar Springs, Colorado\n**Current Status:** In an opaque storage locker within Site-31.\n\n**Item Description:** A chocolate bar decorated with bubble patterns, under the brand name \"Chocolotsacoco\". This brand of chocolate bar, as well as its manufacturer Cometica Confections, does not exist. Bar is covered in tiny pockets, which the packaging claims is air bubbles filled with cocoa powder. Any carbonated liquid stirred with the candy bar is turned into chocolate milk through unknown means. During this transformation, all solid objects completely submerged in the liquid turn into ice. The resultant chocolate milk is perpetually carbonated, but otherwise considered non-anomalous and safe to drink. This effect extends to liquids generally deemed unsafe for human consumption. Attempting to eat the bar, however, has proven fatal, as any living creature that produces CO² will have their blood turned into chocolate milk after digestion.\n**Date of Recovery:** May 31st, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** █████████ Chocolate World Gift Shop, Hershey, PA\n**Current Status:** In low-value storage.\n\n**Item Description:** Hinged wooden box, the size of most standard jewellery boxes, painted with images of ducks in flight.

If the box is opened after hearing the voice, the voice will stop speaking immediately.  Nothing has been found in or on the box that could cause this, and the voice does not respond when spoken to.\n**Date of Recovery:** May 31st, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** A thrift store in Eureka, California\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n\n**Item Description:** Small plastic comb, visually similar to most commercially available pocket combs.  Despite having clearly been mass-produced, no manufacturer's information is visible.  Anyone touching the comb hears multiple voices whispering in an as-yet-unidentified language.  If the subject pays too much attention to the voices or addresses them in any language, the voices stop speaking, as though aware that they were being overheard.  The source of the voices has not been determined, seeming to be somewhere behind the subject.\n**Date of Recovery:** June 1st, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Abandoned at a BART station in San Francisco, California\n**Current Status:** Being tested.\n\n**Item Description:** Wooden mug decorated with a painting of a wooden sailing ship of 17th century construction under full sail.  Any liquid poured into the mug will become whichever variety of alcohol the intended drinker most prefers at the moment.  It is unclear how the item is aware of this information.  If the item is passed to another person, the liquid contained will be transmuted.\n**Date of Recovery:** June 3rd, 2024\n**Location of Recovery:** At a garage sale in Kalamazoo, Michigan.\n**Current Status:** Available for use by personnel.\n**Note:** //This item is only to be used after working hours.  Drinking alcohol on duty is not permitted.//\n\n**Item Description:** One adult female //Gallus domesticus//[[footnote]] Chicken [[/footnote]] of the Plymouth Rock breed. Whether an egg produced by AO-1426 is fertilized or unfertilized is immediately apparent to any human observer despite possessing no visual distinction. Sapient nonhumans are unaffected.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2024-06-07\n**Location of Recovery:** Private business ostensibly portrayed as an animal research lab, Springfield, Massachusetts, USA.\n**Current Status:** Held in Poultry Enclosure 3 at Site-25.\n\n**Item Description:** One Lianhua Supermarket shopping bag. All testudines[[footnote]] Turtles, tortoises, and terrapins [[/footnote]] within a 5 kilometer radius of this item are selectively intangible to all forms of plastic. Prior to containment, this ability was observed being used by local testudines for avoiding suffocation, obtaining food from sealed containers, and restraining or evading mates, rivals, and predators who had only recently entered the area and thus were unaware of how to use this ability.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2015-09-07\n**Location of Recovery:** Drain pipe in ████████ ████ Subdistrict, Pudong, Shanghai, China\n**Current Status:** Held in a Size-III object storage locker in Site-109-D's Biohazard Exclusion Wing.\n\n**Item Description:** A floret of brassica oleracea[[footnote]] Broccoli [[/footnote]] with the stem painted brown. Any observer, sapient or not, that sees this floret in the presence of a tree believes that the floret is, in fact, a tree, and behaves accordingly. This memetic effect ends only if the exposed specimen does not see a tree for approximately 24 hours, though it ends early if the specimen becomes aware that the floret isn't a tree (for example, someone taking a bite out of it). Nothing has caused the memetic properties to dissipate; removing the paint, eating parts of the floret, and even the floret rotting haven't stopped specimens from identifying it as a tree in the presence of another tree, even when the rotten bits were arranged into the shape of an entirely different object. After the pieces were mistakenly taken from Dr. Frisk's office to the incinerator and destroyed, the memetic properties transferred to the site incinerator.\n**Date of Recovery:** April 8th, 2023\n**Location of Recovery:** ██████ Elementary School, Rising Sun, MD, United States\n**Current Status:** Incinerator deemed safe for use by approved personnel for non-organic matter only, as even tree branches and leaves trigger the memetic effect.

All attempts to trace the anonymous reportee have thus far failed.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2024-04-02\n**Location of Recovery:** A warehouse in Albany, New York\n**Current Status:** In storage at Site-19. The canvas has been covered in black masking tape.\n\n**Item Decryption:** An audio recoding of \"Tourniquet of Roses\" by the Residents,[[footnote]]An American art connective and experiential rock band founded in 1969.[[/footnote]] which contains six attritional verses not present in the original song.[[footnote]]Partial transcript: //And all the colors green / Have been replaced by machine / And all the trees have been forgotten in the dream we dream//[[/footnote]] Any human subject who listens to these extra verses becomes increasingly prone to the use of malapropisms[[footnote]]The incorrect use of a word in place of a similar-sounding one; for example, \"fade into Bolivian\" rather than \"fade into obsidian\".[[/footnote]] in speech and writing, with the frequency ingressing upon repeated exposure. Transcripts of the song's lyrics remain unaffected, however. This affect typically subsets after one week, though rare exceptions have been discovered through expensive tasting.\n**Date of Recovery:** 06-13-2024\n**Lactation of Recovery:** Uploaded to YouTube under the title \"The Residents - Tourniquet of Roses (EXTENDED CUT)\". Uploader was identified as █████ ███████, a resident of Cedar Springs, Colorado who discovered the song on a CD he had purchased at a flea market and was unaware of its anonymous properties.\n**Currant Status:** Stored on a flesh drive at Site-27.\n\n**Item Description:** A 30th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray of //Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan//. --Viewing-- Being in a 500m proximity of the item while it is being played induces the production of adrenaline, cortisol, and other stress hormones in human subjects, causing individuals in the area of effect to enter a heightened emotional state. Physical altercations are common when the anomaly is active; however, the film must be played on its original medium, and playing the raw file which contains the data for //The Wrath of Khan// after its extraction produces no anomalous effects.\n**Date of Recovery:** 6/19/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Port Huron, Michigan, at the first (and last) annual \"Wrath of Con\", a //Star Trek// fandom convention.\n**Current Status:** Under consideration for use in a study on the prolonged effects of adrenaline and cortisol exposure on D-Class personnel.\n\n**Item Description:** A 12 oz. can of salted peanuts with a nondescript white label reading \"pee nuts\". Human subjects who consume the can's contents initially report no anomalous effects; however, approximately two weeks after consumption, subjects begin to report a number of symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, and blood in their urine. These symptoms continue to increase in severity over the next several days, culminating in the passage of a whole, unshelled peanut through the subject's urethra. This process has been described as excruciatingly painful, with many subjects losing consciousness as a result. However, actual physical damage is minimal, being consistent with kidney stones of average size. Resulting peanuts do not share AO-1430's anomalous properties.\n**Date of Recovery:** 06-19-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Recovered at a King Soopers in Cedar Springs, Colorado by Agent Clement, who suspected that the item was anomalous in nature due to its unusual appearance and placement within the store.\n**Current Status:** In a low-value item storage locker within Site-343.\n\n**Item Description:** One (1) bag of sunflower seeds that, if a seed is peeled, will contain another identically sized unpeeled sunflower seed within it.\n**Date of Recovery:** 05-06-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** A supermarket near Site-75.\n**Current Status:** Kept in the Site-75 break room.\n//Notes: How do you even eat these?

During this time, equivalent damage is inflicted on the device that the video is being broadcast from, which continues until the device becomes unusable. To date, all attempts at viewing the contents of the video beyond the 1:53:03 mark have proven unsuccessful, and have invariably resulted in significant mechanical failure.\n**Date of Recovery:** 07-29-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Uploaded to YouTube under the title \"Gently Breaking Your Computer ASMR 😏💥💻\" by the channel \"Glitch City ASMR\" in February 2020. The uploader has not yet been identified.\n**Current Status:** Video and channel removed from YouTube under the guise of a copyright violation; further action has been deemed unnecessary due to the video having less than 500 views at the time of its deletion. An archived copy of the video is stored in Site-10's digital archives.\n\n**Item Description:** An oil painting depicting a camel standing in a desert. When the painting is viewed by a human subject, they will automatically believe that the current day is a Wednesday regardless of what the actual day of the week is. The effect ceases when the subject is shown proof of what the actual day of the week is.\n**Date of Recovery:** 06-30-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** A thrift shop located in Columbia, South Carolina.\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1431 - 1440 \n\n**Item Description:** A BluRay of Věra Chytilová’s 1966 film //Daisies//, physically resembling the non-anomalous edition as distributed by The Criterion Collection.[[footnote]]Criterion did not offer BluRay editions of this film when this item was recovered, however, despite the identical design, research has confirmed the standard Criterion copies to be entirely non-anomalous[[/footnote]] Has a mild “feminising” effect when viewed in its entirety by an individual assigned male at birth, increasing the estrogen levels in the subject’s body.[[footnote]]It should be noted that this is not an instant “transmogrifying\" effect, such as seen with [[[SCP-113]]] or [[[SCP-6113]]], but a more subtle alteration akin to a single standard dose of feminising HRT as prescribed to a transgender woman[[/footnote]]\n**Date of Recovery:** 04-27-2019\n**Location of Recovery:** Seized during a raid on ███████, a British Columbia, Canada-based eBay seller found to be selling home videos of numerous anomalous films, as well as anomalous copies of non-anomalous films\n**Current Status:** In storage.\n\n**Item Description:** A printed world map whose marked borders change in real time to display the current de facto territorial control of the world.\n**Date of Recovery:** 10-20-2015\n**Location of Recovery:** A charity shop in Essex, United Kingdom \n**Current Status:** In storage.\n**Note:** Beginning on ██-██-20██, the map began displaying Bir Tawil, an officially unclaimed and uninhabited area of land along the Egyptian-Sudanese border, as belonging to “The Tongue Eaters”. More recently, this area has been observed to grow in size, and now encompasses significant portions of land publicly believed to be under the control of either Egypt or Sudan. Research into the implications of this is ongoing.\n\n**Item Description**: A music box that continuously plays --an unidentified tune-- 'Yesterday' by The Beatles without any source of propulsion. It can be stopped by holding the musical cylinder still with hand, but resumes immediately upon release.\n**Date of Recovery**: 01-21-1964\n**Location of Recovery**: Room 102, George V Hotel, Paris, France\n**Current Status**: --In storage at Site-██-- Transferred to Site-██, in possession of Dr. Foster.\n//Notes: Agent ██████ has been reprimanded for using expired Class-A amnestics, as his mistake caused the tune to be published as one of their most iconic songs the following year.

Upon visual contact with the object, individuals experience an overwhelming compulsion to insert their hand into the blender and activate it.\n**Date of Recovery:** 16/08/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Dr. Arya Roy's office, Site-██.\n**Current Status:** In Storage.\n**Notes:** //\"That blender was the only useful thing my mom gifted me.\"// –Dr. Arya Roy.\n\n**Item Description:** Approximately 22.9 liters of a water-like material, which shifts between solid and liquid state once every 28 seconds, without any change in temperature. Any solid it touches while changing from solid state to liquid state will liquefy with it, and likewise, any liquid it touches while changing from liquid state to solid state will solidify with it. These changes move quickly through tightly-packed solids substances and liquids, but slowly though loosely packed materials like dirt and snow. Non-anomalous water acts as an extension of its abilities, anything touching a body of water containing the water-like material changes with it.\n**Date of Recovery:** 16/08/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** ██° ██′ █″ N, ██° ██′ █″ W, Nunavut\n**Current Status:** Provisionally Neutralized.\n**Notes:** //While transmuting surrounding soil and rock into glass served as a temporary containment method, due to glass's amorphous state, the item would eventually dissolve it in several hours. Due to being launched into the sun with SCP-████-█, it can no longer cause any further damage. It is being monitored for any further activity, but is believed to have been destroyed or rendered ineffective due to being immersed in plasma indefinitely.//\n\n**Item Description:** A copy of the CD single for \"Kiss Me Thru The Phone\" by Soulja Boy. Audio is consistent with other official recordings of the song, except the phone number mentioned in the prechorus is replaced with the personal number of the person who decided to play the song. If the person does not have a cell or home phone number, the song plays as normal.\n**Date of Recovery:** 17/09/2010\n**Location of Recovery:** ████████ Records warehouse in Fayal, Minnesota.\n**Current Status:** In a storage locker at Site-55.\n**Notes:** //What happens if you have more than one cell phone?//\n\n**Item Description:** Mid-20th century painting, in realistic style, depicting an unknown woman with blonde hair, wearing a blue dress consistent with styles popular in the 1960s, shown standing in a field of grass with a large wooden box to her left.  The painted figure remains stationary while observed by a human subject, but is often found in different positions after being left unobserved, even briefly.  The wooden box is filled with objects, which are also found to change or become absent from the painting entirely.\n**Date of Recovery:** 9/9/2022\n**Location of Recovery:** An art gallery in Rochester, NY\n**Current Status:** --In storage.--  Being evaluated for SCP classification after objects missing from the Site were found depicted in the painting; under 24-hour video surveillance.\n**Note:** //Methods for recovering the items found in the painting are being discussed, including use of other anomalous items or SCP-level objects, but nothing has been approved yet.// - Researcher Wyndham\n\n**Item Description**: A 64GB SanDisk USB 2.0 flash drive. Upon removing the “case”, a microscopically scaled set of anomalously functioning and connected internal human organs (with the exception of the brain or bones) are revealed in place of expected technology, encased by a translucent thin sheath identified as a cell membrane that connects to the USB port. DNA testing has concluded the organs belong to ███ ████ Roy, a former IT teacher who went missing on 01/15/2020 in the Everglades National Park. The flash drive otherwise functions as expected.\n**Date of Recovery**: 01/17/2020\n**Location of Recovery**: The home of  ████ ███ Walker, in Anchorage, Alaska, who uploaded a video on the platform YouTube titled “😱LIVING USB AT BEST BUY????😱”, garnering only 102 views before deletion.

If pressed between two objects, such as the pages of a book, this bookmark ceases to experience friction until removed, or more commonly, it slides out from between the two objects. Testing suspended after Incident AI-1461-a, where the bookmark was placed in a hydraulic press to determine how effective its friction-countering capabilities were. After the press reached approximate 5,000 kg of force, the bookmark shot out violently from between the press's plates at approximately ██ m/s, breaking through the observation window, killing Junior Researcher Haslo, and injuring 5 other personnel. It's unknown how the item distinguishes objects as \"different\", which has caused varying results during testing.\n**Date of Recovery:** 10-29-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** B█████ ███ █████ Book Store, Baltimore, Maryland, United States \n**Current Status:** --Held in low-value storage at Site-322-- --Permanently embedded in an observation room wall in Site-322. Despite its anomalous properties, it's theorized that the bookmark is experiencing normal friction because the wall is only one object, and not two.-- Returned to low-value storage after a sticker was applied to the object.\n\n**Item Description:** A scrap of paper torn from a larger document, with the phrase \"Have you **//__signed__//** the oath?\" printed on it in purple ink. Written over the previous contents of the other side is the phrase \"I sign this oath to thee\" written in blood. Anyone in a formal marital relationship that views this side of the document is subjected to the item's cognitohazardous properties, as follows. Immediately upon exposure, the affected person(s) will seek to renew their wedding vows, or make such vows if none have been made yet, in writing. They will be compelled to write said vows in their own blood by any means necessary, and will then present them to their significant other(s). Whether they accept or decline the gesture, the effect ends. This effect can also be ended early if the relationship, formally or informally, is brought to an end, or if an affected viewer is amnesticized. Additionally, anyone not in a formal relationship is entirely unaffected, even if the relationship is permanent.\n**Date of Recovery:** 10-31-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Found in a trash can at a gas station in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, United States\n**Current Status:** Held in low-value storage at Site-322.

The topics and complexity vary wildly, from basic math and the alphabet to doctorate level science, and even some rather strange topics like anomalous art, getting away with felonies, and basic functions like how to breathe. Anyone that attempts to use any of the learning programs in a subject they understand will have their capabilities in that subject matter diminished. These decreases in knowledge occur instantaneously, dropping understanding to a level expected from someone that was learning the subject matter for the first time.\n**Date of Recovery:** 11-11-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Washington D.C., United States \n**Current Status:** Website intercepted and deleted before it could be hosted.

The branding is covered with clear tape, with \"merecool whatr\" written on it with permanent marker. Opening the packet and pouring out the contents causes the water to turn into coinage worth approximately 1 US cent, in whatever currency the local area uses. Stepping on the packet or pouring the contents into one's mouth causes the water to immediately boil into steam measuring approximately ████⁰C. No matter how the packet is opened, it reseals itself and refills with water when not observed.\n**Date of Recovery:** 12-9-2024\n**Location of Recovery:** Found in a restroom at the New York Stock Exchange, Manhattan, NY, United States\n**Current Status:** --Held in low-value storage-- Kept in a secured safe in Dr. Frisk's office.

It then disappears, and once the envelope is closed, a new copy of the letter appears within. The signed version of the letter automatically appears in the presence of the reader's manager or an employee the individual deeply hates. If the reader is unemployed, the signed letter simply ceases to exist.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2024-12-05\n**Location of Recovery:** A█████ Warehouse, Salt Lake City, Utah, United States\n**Current Status:** --Held in low-value storage-- Neutralized after Junior Researcher Lannery sealed the envelope using its gum seal. Junior Researcher Lannery is currently on occupational probation following this incident.\n\n**Item Description:** Small 1,000cm³ cardboard box. Bottom is taped shut with F███ T███. Opening the top of the box will cause it to fold into a 50cm³ sphere comprised of pure glass. Sudden impacts to the sphere cause it to invert back into a cardboard box. Items inside box when it is made a sphere vanish without a trace.\n**Date of Recovery:** 2021-12-31\n**Location of Recovery:** Boxing Day Festival, Montreal, Canada\n**Current Status:** In low-value storage.\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1461 - 1470\n\n**Item Description [Archived]:** A small piece of yellow color paper with the name \"OLIVIA\" stenciled on, glued to a piece of cardstock, glued to Researcher Timothy Green's Foundation-Issued Identification Card lanyard. The lanyard has withstood all attempts of separating it from the piece of paper, and the piece of paper has become completely indestructible.\n**Date of Recovery:** August 29, 2019\n**Location of Recovery:** Site-27, [REDACTED]\n**Current Status:** --Researcher Green has been allowed to keep his lanyard, and has been offered a new one, but declined to the offer.-- See Current Status of AO-1468.\n\n**Item Description [Archived]:** A small piece of lime green color paper with the name \"TIM\" stenciled on, glued to a piece of cardstock, glued to Junior Researcher Olivia Sinclair's Foundation-Issued Identification Card lanyard. The lanyard has withstood all attempts of separating it from the piece of paper, and the piece of paper has become completely indestructible.\n**Date of Recovery:** August 29, 2019\n**Location of Recovery:** Site-27, [REDACTED]\n**Current Status:** Following a \"breakup\" between Junior Researcher Sinclair and Researcher Green, both AO-1467 and AO-1468's anomalous properties have ceased. Both Anomalous Objects' logs are to be considered Archived.\n\n**Item Description:** A standard test paper which changes its content every 24 hours. Content varies from Kindergarten to College-level examinations in subjects including, but not limited to: English, Mathematics, Science, and History. When physical contact is made by a non-anomalous human being, they will immediately gain the intelligence level of an average person of the age level that the examination is created for. When said individual completes the examination, they will retain the intelligence level that the Item gave them, but with an extreme mastery of the subject matter of the test paper, even in matters not included in the age level that the examination was designed for. This effect typically dissipates during REM-stage sleep after 24 hours of initial exposure. \n**Date of Recovery:** October 17, 1996\n**Location of Recovery:** ██████ State University, Philippines.\n**Current Status:** In a zipper storage bag designed to easily show accidental punctures made to it.

Instead of humans, the films’ cast consists entirely of anthropomorphic specimens of Vulpes vulpes.[[footnote]]Red fox[[/footnote]] The language used by the characters is also slightly different so as to match the fact that everyone is a fox, apart from their abnormal content, both the film and blu-ray are non-anomalous.\n**Date of Recovery:** January 17, 2000\n**Location of Recovery:** A rental video store in Jacksonville, Florida, United States.\n**Current Status:** On a shelf in the Site-19 break room.\n**Note:** //Foxes or no foxes the movie is still good and funny, I’m happy that it’s free to use.// - Dr. ███\n\n**Item Description:** A blue binder sketchpad, visually unremarkable. When any human or humanoid entity is drawn within its pages, regardless of the subject's ability to conceive, the drawing is modified by unknown means to make the subject drawn appear to be in the third trimester of pregnancy. Effect does not manifest if subject is already drawn undergoing pregnancy.\n**Date of Recovery:** February 9, 2025 \n**Location of Recovery:** ██████ Art Supplies Store, Philippines.\n**Current Status:** In low-value item storage.\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1471 - 1480 \n\n**Item Description:** A video whose contents had been entirely replaced mid-viewing with an advertisement for the home improvement store chain Home Depot. While the contents of the ad itself are identical to the contents of a non-anomalous ad posted a day prior, anyone who watches this video in particular is compelled to acquire a Home Depot brand bucket. Once such a bucket is acquired, that individual will no longer operate a vehicle without putting their head inside such a bucket and wearing it like a hat. Despite the fact that they cannot see through the bucket, however, they drive with a comparable skill level to a professional stunt driver, and are fully aware of their surroundings while operating a vehicle. The only way to neutralize these effects is to put the affected individual's head inside of a Lowe's brand bucket, ending the anomalous effects.\n**Date of Recovery:** February 8th, 2025\n**Location of Recovery:** YouTube.com; uploaded with the title \"How 2 DRift a Train MULTITARACK DIRIFITNG\" (sic)\n**Current Status:** Source video deleted from YouTube. A copy is held on a flash drive in low-value storage. \n\n**Item Description:** A series of five signature model guitars based on musicians Synyster Gates, Angus Young, Kurt Cobain, James Hetfield, and Frank Iero. When used the player will play the instruments perfectly regardless of previous experience with playing guitar. Additionally the only songs that will be played are by the musicians' respective bands (that being Avenged Sevenfold, AC/DC, Nirvana, Metallica, and My Chemical Romance). When music not by a guitar's respective band is played no audible noise will come from it. Disassembly of the guitars show no anomalous internal modification. Replacement of components does not nullify the anomalous effects. The back of each guitar's headstock features a number between one and five followed by “out of 15”.\n**Date of Recovery:** 11/10/2024\n**Location of Recovery:** An abandoned instrument store outside Boston, Massachusetts. \n**Current Status:** Four of the guitars were distributed to different sites to be used for recreational purposes in personnel break rooms. The Synyster Gates one is in the possession of Jr. Researcher Bard who requested to keep it in his personal quarters. Research into the implied ten missing guitars is ongoing.\n**Note:** //While the effect does not transfer between the guitars and non-anomalous guitars, playing the Synyster Gates guitar has helped me get better at playing A7X songs on my normal guitars. So that rules.// - Jr. Researcher Bard\n\n**Item Description:** A standard █████ brand pen. The pen functions like any standard pen and can be refilled. Its anomalous properties manifest whenever someone tries to describe its current status, causing said person to describe its current geographic location. This effect manifests both in written documents and via verbal communication. The geographic location cannot be redacted in writing by any means.\n**Date of Recovery:** 17-09-2018\n**Location of Recovery:** ████ elementary school, ███████, Poland\n**Current Status:** Contained in a standard low security locker located 43°35'14\"N 104°31'56\"W. Item is located far away from foundation sites due to safety concerns. Item is monitored through use of its anomalous effect once a week.\n**Notes:** //Request for use by MTF to track down GOI's is currently pending.//\n\n**Item Description:** A Sony branded Discman portable CD player. When a disc featuring music is played while the listener is wearing headphones they will believe they are the singer of the song and will speak in the voice and cadence of the song's original singer. This effect will wear off six hours after the listener has stopped using the device and does not occur at all when the device is plugged into any speakers other than headphones. The anomaly only occurs when music is played on the device as audiobooks or non music media do not trigger the anomalous effects. Individuals affected by the anomaly may exhibit knowledge about the singer's personal life that is either obscure or completely unknown to the public. Information retrieved from this has been found to be either correct or unconfirmable. \n**Date of Recovery:** 1/10/2021\n**Location of Recovery:**  Apartment in London, England.\n**Current Status:** In storage\n**Note:** The original owner claimed to have found it on the side of the road and was using it to make money impersonating various dead musicians.\n\n**Item Description:** A wheeled recycling bin with a blue lid issued by the city of Remscheid, Germany. Upon closure of the lid, the bin always generates documents taken from the recycle bin file directory of any computer within a radius of 800 meters from its location.\n**Date of Recovery:** 4-2-2025\n**Location of Recovery:**  Remscheid, Germany.\n**Current Status:** In storage. The lid is stored separately to prevent data leakage.\n**Note:** Item is still under study for potential use by Foundation Field agents.\n\n**Item Description:** A book titled, \"How to Become a God\", with the subtitle \"Become the omnipotent ruler of a universe in only 23 steps\".

Otherwise functions normally.\n**Date of Recovery:** 01/14/2008\n**Location of Recovery** Buffalo, New York\n**Current Status:** Held in a storage locker at Site-██\n\n**Item Description:** A Hamilton Beach bread maker. --Only capable of producing cat-shaped bread.-- While the bread maker is seemingly normal, any bread produced by this machine carries a memetic property. This property manifests in the belief that the loaf of bread looks like a cat \"loafing\"[[footnote]] Loafing is an internet term used to describe the natural relaxation habits of animals, wherein they lie on their paws to show they feel comfortable in their environment. [[/footnote]], and viewers will be inclined to take pictures of it and share it with close friends.\n**Date of Recovery:** February 28th, 2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Elkton, Maryland, United States\n**Current Status:** Held in low-value storage.\n\n**Item Description:** A vehicle license plate issued by the Republic of Italy, bearing the combination ███████. The combination has been deemed anomalous, as any media portraying the license plates with its Italian format (two blue bands on each side)  and affixed onto a vehicle causes any speed trap to activate. The recorded speed will always be 7 km more than the speed allowed by the trap, no matter the actual speed registered by other instruments. Effects do not happen if the combination is written in any other format or issued by other countries.\n**Date of Recovery:** 26-04-2022\n**Location of Recovery:** Dr. Arman's vehicle, parked in Site-446\n**Current Status:** Held in low-value storage\n**Notes:** \"Unbelievable that such a combination has been issued to my car of all the cars in the world. And I had to get new plates without Foundation reimbursement because of this discovery.\" - Dr. Arman\n\n**Item Description:** A pile of pancakes on a plate. People observing the pancake pile will claim that it is so beautiful that \"It would be a crime to eat it\". Attempts at trying to eat a pancake have resulted in complete failure. The pancakes do not seem to rot or get moldy, and result always fresh.\n**Date of Recovery:** 09-03-2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Orlando, FL.\n**Current Status:** At Site-446's cafeteria as a decorative element.\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1481 - 1490 \n\n**Item Description:** A reverb guitar pedal that when used will force the user to look down at it at all times.

Thompson. When read the subject will experience the effects of the drugs taken by the novels protagonist Raoul Duke. The drug in question is dependent on the page and scene of the book the subject is on. The effect on the subject will cease at either the conclusion of the chapter or two hours later if the subject stops reading while the effect is active.\n**Date of Recovery:** 03/19/2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Bookstore in Woody Creek, Colorado. \n**Current Status:** In storage at Site-45.\n**Note:** Woody Creek, Colorado was the hometown of Hunter S. Thompson. No other significant connection between the location and the object is known at this time.\n\n**Item Description:** One (1) severed, blackened hand, in a set condition appearing similar to charcoal. Its thumb has been detached and is missing. Skeletal analysis has determined bone age of four hundred seventy-six (476) years, yet decomposition has entirely halted within the subject. The hand was brought in for testing on seven (7) occasions. During each of which, the subject was eventually found missing, and reappeared back at the discovery site the following  sunrise.\n**Date of Recovery:** 06/03/2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Durant, Oklahoma, United States\n**Current Status:** Durant, Oklahoma, United States\n**Note:** Due to the lack of information or interest in the object, and its anomalous properties of returning to this location, subject was buried where it was discovered.\n\n**Item Description:** A red 1970 Chevrolet Caprice. Inside its trunk is a suitcase of miscellaneous drugs and alcohol. Whenever someone drives the vehicle they will be compelled to take the drugs and drive to Las Vegas, Nevada. Attempting to remove the items in the trunk without using them will cause the items to disappear within two (2) hours and reappear in the trunk. Turning on the radio will play several songs from the late 1960s and early 1970s despite the radio lacking a signal receiver or similar system. Anomalous effect of compelling the driver to take drugs and go to Las Vegas ceases while the vehicle is inside the aforementioned city. \n**Date of Recovery:** 05/22/1998\n**Location of Recovery:** An auto body repair shop in Barstow, California. \n**Current Status:** Inside the Site-45 parking garage. --Staff may request to drive the vehicle for the purpose of running errands for the Site.-- Following the discovery of the drugs reappearing in the trunk of the car, use of the vehicle by staff is no longer permitted. The trunk is also to be kept locked at all times.\n**Note:** At an unknown point in time the song Bat Country by Avenged Sevenfold was added to the rotation of songs played on the cars radio. It is the only song not from the late 1960s or early 1970s to play on the cars radio.\n\n**Item Description:** A 5ft tall plastic skeleton decoration (can be disassembled) that occasionally lets out a quiet laughing sound, similar to the cartoon character \"Skeletor\" from the \"He-Man\" show (still active when disassembled).\n**Date of Recovery:** 05/28/2010\n**Location of Recovery:** A Spirit Halloween in Yorktown, Virginia.\n**Current Status:** Kept disassembled in an anomaly storage locker at Site-76.\n**Note:** Brought out of containment and reassembled around Halloween and kept in the breakroom of Site-76 until the end of October, at which point the anomaly is promptly disassembled and put back into containment.\n\n**Item Description:** Resembles boots of armor from the medieval period. These boots smell strongly of fresh bread. When worn by a person, they gain the immense urge to dropkick someone, even if they don't know how or have the strength to do so. Upon successfully dropkicking someone with the boots on, the dropkicked takes immense amounts of physical trauma and force, with people being torn in half at the minimum.\n**Date of Recovery:** 9/19/2000\n**Location of Recovery:** New York, Massachusetts. Found inside a persons apartment. The person was reported missing and upon a welfare check these were found.\n**Current Status:** Locked up in anomalous storage at Site-96\n**Note:** //Why bread? Please I’ve run so many tests. All of them. Why do they smell like bread? - Dr. Merry//\n\n**Item Description:** A gum wrapper of indeterminate origin and age with the phrase \"War never changes\" written in all capital letters in what appears to be blue ink on the paper.

These locations all share the fact that USB cables have been unintentionally left unattended in them long-term, without any intention to do so. Any USB cables left in these locations, except those made with a specific device in mind, will transform into a seemingly identical cord with the newest standard. This transformation takes approximately three (3) months to take affect, the period of which is interrupted if anyone directly interacts with the cable, but the transformation itself is instantaneous once it happens. The cable will look exactly the same as it once did, even having the exact same length, but upon closer inspection, any connectors will have been replaced with the modern standard, USB C.\n**Date of Recovery:** 03/04/2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Anomaly first reported in Hamburg, Germany. Anomaly confirmed in Site-19.\n**Current Status:** Designated storage areas being enforced, when appropriate, in affected locations.

It has been painted light blue with magenta frames and doors and yellow panels over the windows, and has a road sign saying \"JUICE\" that lights up from 12:00-13:00 precisely. During this time, if someone knocks on the largest window at the front of the building, a window opens, and a cup comes through the window, containing one of the four classical humours.[[footnote]] Blood, phlegm, yellow bile, and black bile. The four humours encompasses an outdated medical practice in which these four parts of the body were \"balanced\" to promote a healthy life and heal the body. [[/footnote]] The building has no interior access, and nothing can be seen through the window when it opens. Additionally, anything placed within disappears if it's inside after the hour is over. Dispensed liquids appear non-anonymous. \n**Date of Recovery:** 05/16/2025\n**Location of Recovery:** Essex, Maryland, United States\n**Current Status:** Relocated to hangar at Site-██.\n\n+++ Anomalous Items 1491 - 1500\n\n**Item Description:** A container of Tic Tac branded mints. Taking the mints will cause any addictive tendencies or substance abuse disorders in the subject to cease.

Individuals that hold the phone while bedtime mode[[footnote]] causes the screen to become grayscale [[/footnote]] is on will experience altered perception until they sleep for a full 8 hours. Animated media, such as movies, TV shows, video games and YouTube videos will appear in grayscale to them during high-stress moments, primarily when themes of death are involved. This effect grows more profound if extended contact is made with the device while bedtime mode is on, and if someone holds the phone for 8 hours while it's in bedtime mode, they will proceed to enter a comatose state where they only dream in black and white, and suffer from near constant nightmares. This state has been observed to last up to approximately 24 hours. Other display modes have been observed to have other effects as well. Color inversion causes the individual to perceive events around them in a pessimistic matter until the mode is turned off, night light [[footnote]] temporarily applies a red tint to the screen [[/footnote]] causes a red tint to the subject's vision until morning, color correction causes everything to look vibrant until the subject sees something that's pure grey, black, or white, and auto-rotate causes the subject's eyes to rotate in orientation with the phone, and when the phone is flipped, their body [REDACTED].\n**Date of Recovery:** 02/08/2025\n**Location of Recovery:** The Boardwalk, Atlantic City, New Jersey, United States\n**Current Status:** --Held in low-value storage with all display modes turned off.
